Jean G.,"Bullhead City, AZ",86,267,143,4.0,1/5/2018,"***PROS*** * Short wait for table - 10 mins * Attentive waiter - never hungry, thirsty, or wondering where he was * Great food! We had 4-cheese pasta which tasted like a pizza with so much flavor, herb-crusted, grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes that were wonderful, and tempura-battered fish tacos with chipotle sauce, pickled red cabbage, salsa and guacamole that was delicious.  * Complimentary bread at table was warm and fresh, served with large pats of butter * Strawberry lemonade had real strawberry seeds in it, sugar rim on the glass, and wonderful sour flavor.  * Cheesecake to go was packaged with extra whipped cream and plenty of napkins & forks ***CONS*** The only ""con"" was that the waiter mentioned the computers were slow because of a Christmas coupon that was difficult to enter yet many customers were using. I wish we knew about the coupon. I'd say check their website for details, get on their mailing list, or follow their social media accounts for details."
Joyce T.,"Honolulu, HI",61,570,687,4.0,12/31/2017,"What a success this place this is! Every table is taken, people willing to wait for up to an hour for a table and the patrons look happy. Used a gift card for chicken potstickers and mixed veggie salad with added chicken. The potstickers were actually tasty and the shoyu sauce pleasing. Pal commented on how pure and unburpy the meat was. Loved the green onions on it. The mixed salad had a lot of cheese chunks and mixtures of salad, asparagus and stuff. Don't remember a heavy or creamy dressing, but it was flavorful enough not to miss it. Great service."
Brian W.,"Las Vegas, NV",227,135,31,2.0,12/24/2017,"First and foremost, Cheesecake Factory is not kid friendly. Yes they have a kids menu, but nothing to keep the little ones distracted. I took my daughter there for a lunch date and felt pressured to order as fast as possible. We ordered our drinks and went to use the restroom to wash up. By the time we came back, the table was cleared and setup for someone else.  I asked our waitress why they cleared the table and she said that she thought we left, even though we ordered drinks and had bread on our plates. It is not the worst place on the planet for food, but there are about 25 other restaurants in the area that I would choose before going back to The Cheesecake Factory."
Heather A.,"Henderson, NV",113,338,335,3.0,11/28/2017,"Everyone knows Cheesecake Factory.  You are going to find an extensive menu and you'll have to decide what you are in the mood to eat. Depending on the day and time, you may have a wait.  Attempted to go here on a discount cheesecake night and the expected wait was 45 minutes to an hour.  I'm not sure how long it was because we bailed after 20 minutes. Back to the last time my family and I ate here this past week.  The food looks amazing.  (See my pictures). The taste is OK.  The side salad was supposed to have balsamic dressing and I tasted none, so I left it.  The chicken salad sandwich is delicious!  Should have gotten the full size instead of the lunch special, as the soup was also only OK. The men in my family enjoyed their burgers, which was big enough for my teen to also have for dinner.  Daughter liked, not loved, her grilled cheese."
Shelly M.,"San Fernando, CA",235,40,44,5.0,12/23/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory was at the district in Henderson. The food was great, the service was even better. Our waiter (didn't catch his name, but he had a distinct handlebar mustache), mentioned the daily specials and was very accommodating to our customized orders.  We didn't wait too long to be seated, and our food came out pretty fast too.  We've eaten at many cheesecake factories before, but what made this review and experience so yelp worthy, was our fantastic waiter."
Justin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",68,197,3724,5.0,9/15/2017,"Great spot for a birthday dinner with a plethora of dessert options! The wife and I met a couple of friends here for her birthday dinner and only waited about 15 minutes before being seated (at 6:15pm). We started with waters all around and a couple of cocktails: the strawberry martini and the factory peach Bellini, both drinks were very good 5/5.  For appetizers we ordered the avocado spring rolls 5/5.  The bread was also delivered with butter and the wheat loaf is always delicious.  For entree's we ordered the Orange Chicken: deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in sweet and spicy orange sauce accompanied with rice (white or brown) and veggies, usually lots of snow peas and some carrots 5/5, shrimp jambalaya delicious flavors 5/5, shrimp pasta 4/5, and the chicken salad with extra chicken 4/5. For desserts we tried the white chocolate raspberry 5/5 and the Craig's crazy carrot cake cheesecake 5/5! Honestly I think all of heir desserts are 5/5! Service was on top of everything and even came to sing 8-D. Thank you for a nice birthday dinner!"
Mike V.,"Henderson, NV",48,85,208,4.0,1/3/2018,Not only am I fan of the cheesecake but also the food. As of late I've found myself sitting at or in the bar area so I don't have to wait for a seat. It seems this location is always busy. Happy hour is M-F 4-6pm with reduced price drinks and appetizers.
Eiprheel E.,"Henderson, NV",40,123,455,5.0,9/6/2017,"This is my and my family's go-to Cheesecake Factory. It's also one of my favorite restaurants to eat at and we've come here for birthdays, anniversaries, holiday meals, meetings, meet-ups, and to satisfy cravings. My family and I have always gotten good service at this location and their list of meals on the menu dose not disappoint.  Will continue to go this location and this restaurant."
Poco P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1616,372,2558,5.0,7/14/2017,Sheryl & Stephen are awesome!  4pm Happy Hour w/ them is fantastic & the crowd is very friendly.  Mostly locals.  I have to leave a new review because I had the Beet Salad for the first time here & I highly recommend it!  Super beautiful salad!  Mmm mmm!    My friend got the Dynamite Shrimp & Spicy Chicken.  I tasted both & the only thing dynamite on both were the sauce on the side.  The batter on each were not spicy whatsoever.  My girlfriend got the Tomato Basil Flatbread & Adam's PB Chocolate Ripple Cheesecake & both were absolutely delish to share!!  I have to say the PB Cheesecake blew our socks off lol!  Wow!  The Reese's PB Cheesecake is mixed layers of cake upon Cheesecake so not an all Cheesecake FYI.  Mmm!
Jordan I.,"Las Vegas, NV",68,130,763,4.0,10/11/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my family's go-to restaurants, whether it be for dinner on the weekend or when we're celebrating a special occasion. The menu at The Cheesecake Factory is very extensive, a bit overwhelming at that! With the menu consisting of just about 20 pages, everyone is bound to find something they'll enjoy. The food is consistent, always fresh, and the portions are ridiculously huge. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day! A few of my favorite dishes include the Barbeque Ranch Chicken Salad and the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  If you have room, there are over 50 cheesecakes and various desserts to choose from! We normally come to an agreement (which can be hard) and share a slice! Seriously, after a meal here, a slice of cheesecake will push you to the edge. During our most recent visit, we received the most outstanding service from Aiden! He was on his A-game from start to finish, exceptional to say the least. He was very informative when we had questions about items on the menu and even recommended a few of his favorites! Aiden was constantly checking up on my family and always made sure that our waters (and bread basket) were filled. Not to mention, he can really carry a tune! We were very impressed! Thank you, Aiden! Now, if only it wasn't so dark inside the restaurant! The ambience is nice, don't get me wrong, but I wish the lighting wasn't so dim! There was a single light shining down from the high ceiling in the middle of our table, and everyone was taking turns using it to read the menu. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but it's true. With the sun going down sooner in the day, there's not much natural light left to come through the windows before dinnertime. Overall, great location, great service, and most importantly, great food!"
Joshua W.,"Henderson, NV",224,387,524,4.0,12/5/2017,The wife and I decided to try this location again (with some friends) even though we know the wait times are usually ridiculous. We were able to get a seat immediately on a Tuesday evening. I had the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and it was amazing! I was so glad I was able to figure out what I wanted since their menu is huge. The service was excellent. No one had a empty glass all evening. Very courteous and consistent all night long. We will definitely be visiting this location again soon.
Nevada Bolt N.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,45,16,2.0,12/7/2017,"This place in general is average. Never exceptional.  I arrived for lunch at 10:59 doors locked. 11:02 doors open. Why not open 10 minutes early?? Don't make customers wait outside.sat down was not served for 10 minutes. Had various waiters help us then after 20 minutes of waiting watching others getting their food , people that had arrived after us, our food arrived with apologies that a take out order took all their time.  The enchiladas we had ordered were cold. After waiting another 5 minutes to flag down a waiter we were told they could reheat it.  They took the food away and brought the salad bowls back asking us if we wanted to eat that while we waited. They had offered my salad to my guest and hers to me, wtf... I then told them to start from scratch and remake it all and she proceeded to look at me with a totally bewildered look. I repeated this and she just went ""but, but,but"". Having had enough and 40 minutes into this circus I left 5 bucks for the ice tea and told her to tell the manager to get their s$$t together then left. Who has hours to mess around at lunch."
Mihya P.,"Henderson, NV",0,6,17,5.0,11/13/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite restaurant ever. It is the perfect place for any occasion.  My favorite things about this restaurant is how it is dimly lit. It adds a more intimate atmosphere and makes the room feel more luxurious. The music they play definitely makes the experience a lot better. It can be quite busy every night as it is perfect for a casual dinner or more special dinner. The servers have always been great and very friendly!  The menu offers you so many different choices. My personal favorites is the fried calamari for appetizer, of course the delicious complimentary bread basket, the herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes with asparagus and a lemon sauce, I made the mistake of switching it up one night and got a rice dish, nothing compares to the salmon, then finish it off with, of course, cheesecake! The classic strawberry cheesecake is not too sweet and fresh, but still satisfying for any sweet tooth.  I was always come back and have had great memories every single visit."
Amber V.,"Las Vegas, NV",567,239,499,4.0,5/14/2017,"Ronny and Phillip are excellent waiters. Very friendly. The food here is always consistent. No matter how busy it is this restaurant is able to get your food out hot, fresh, and fast.  They always cook their steaks right the first time which I really appreciate.  Highly recommend this location and restaurant if you are looking for large selection of dishes and cheesecakes"
Remelyn S.,"Las Vegas, NV",378,82,592,4.0,6/1/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite. I do, however, get really overwhelmed with the amount of pages there are on their menu. But that's just more options! I like ordering appetizers cus I can get full off those rather quickly. My absolute favorite is the loaded baked potato tots. It's exactly what it's called and the flavor is delicious! I also like ordering the egg roll sampler -- because I can't choose just one type of egg roll lol.  When I'm on my lunch break with co-workers, we sit at the bar and get quick service. The lunch specials are amazing and so are the prices. I love the crusted Chicken Romano lunch special!  On a normal visit with no time restraints, we get seated anywhere. The most recent time, our server, Sayem, took really good care of us. He had a lot of recommendations and was very friendly. He even had some staff sing to my friend for her birthday! Now that's customer service!  Now for the best part: dessert. Anything is delicious, really. I like the lemon merengue cheesecake, Oreo dream extreme cheesecake, the snickers cheesecake, even the original is yummy! But you have to remember to save room for dessert!"
Love G.,"Henderson, NV",78,55,64,5.0,6/16/2017,"This is my second time at this location, and definitely not the last. The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant, I am always at the location in Los Angeles which is where I'm from.  Since it was a Friday night it was about a 30-minute wait and I got there around 6:15 PM. There were a lot of parties waiting - for graduations, and also it's Father's Day weekend. The 30 minutes went by quick though, as I was looking through the menu and picking out a cheesecake to order for dessert in their display. 30 minutes is such a nice waiting time, and didn't seem that long especially because the one I go to in LA has a wait time that goes almost 2 hours! It's crazy.  I ordered a strawberry lemonade with a Chicken Marsala with Mushrooms - it was in a wine sauce with bow tie pasta around it! It was delicious and I loved the plating. My uncle got the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with shrimp and chicken and it was so yummy. Not too spicy at all! We also ordered the carrot cake cheesecake. I liked it. I've tried almost every cheesecake and this just crosses it off my list! Took two bites and had to take it to go because I was too full.  Our waiter Brittany was very attentive and nice and checked up on us! Definitely a plus when waiters/waitresses come and check on us every so often rather than waiting for one to come by.  Wish it wasn't so hot outside, maybe next time I'll sit outside and enjoy the view! (And all the cars driving by lol)."
Your100poundlife 1.,"Monrovia, CA",3,11,20,4.0,11/9/2017,"Calorieake Factory, Henderson, NV 250 lbs - Drawn like fat little moths to our glittering temple.... If you're going to visit a restaurant that more than lives up to its reputation for dietary madness, go on an unrestricted night, because it's stupidly futile to observe gustatory rigor at The Caloriecake Factory. Their well-honed formula will suck dollars from your wallet and pack pounds on your waist.  And it is a successful formula, at least as best I can tell: each dish is savory and well prepared if not totally inspired, and most spill over the sides of large plates. Gracious, competent staff, expensive drinks, and no room for dessert, which you will order anyway.  Chicken Madeira: Heavy and comfortish, with nicely cooked chicken breast slathered in peas, carrots, heavy cream/chicken/cheese sauce, stacked on top of a George Foreman fist sized serving of creamy potatoes. Because this setup is too low carb, Caloriecake adds two standard sized buttery biscuits on top of all this, which is good because I totally didn't get enough bread before the meal. With butter. And beer.  Total calorie weigh-in: 1650 for just the dish alone.  Bacon-bacon burger: perfect sear over hot pink beef. Soft, sweetish french roll, fresh crispy veggies, and a joyfully disgusting amount of cheddar cheese and mayo. Man, what a good burger! Alas, sidekicked by fries with a sadly low crunch halflife. The fries could be better.  Calories: 1500. This is so much naughty fun that it'll come with a hangover.  Caramel Salted Cheesecake: 1000 calories for one slice. I'm laughing as I type this.  Back on program tomorrow. The Caloriecake Factory adds just enough pleasure to your guilty to keep busting diets like belts. Go enjoy. Occasionally."
Trebor G.,"Reno, NV",10,24,36,4.0,9/22/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is an excellent choice whenever you're not quite sure what you have a taste for.   Every location seems to be as popular as the next and there's almost always a wait. However, it's always well worth the wait.  We arrived and it seemed as if the parking lot was completely full. Upon entering, we were told there would be a 10 minute wait. This was perfect, a 10 minute wait gives an opportunity for winding down just prior to your meal. The hostesses Michelle and Kelli greeted us with a huge smile's and we're very cordial.  After about five minutes of waiting our name was called and we were seated.  Our waiter, Todd was nothing short of amazing.  We didn't have drinks however ordered right away.  I was considering something different so I tried the Shepherds Pie. Yum Yum!  My friend had Shelia's Chicken and Avocado Salad.  Both meals were absolutely amazing. I can hardly wait to try the Shepherds Pie again. This location is just outside Las Vegas (The District), is tucked away nicely and I encourage everyone to try it."
Betcy W.,"Henderson, NV",31,54,186,4.0,12/2/2017,"Tried their Miso Marinated Salmon, such a tasty and beautiful dish. I loved the white sauce that gives it a sweet taste. Comes with brown or white rice and snow peas. Portion was great too I was able to take leftovers. I recommend this dish if you're in the mood for some seafood. Our server was great, made sure our drinks were refilled and was very attentive. I like the dim lighting and atmosphere is quite romantic. This place gets pretty pact and although they don't take reservations until after 8pm I would call ahead and ask what the wait time is. We were able to get seated right away on a Wednesday night though. I'll definitely be back!"
Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1000,3186,5.0,4/11/2017,"This is one of the only chain restaurants I frequent because I think their cheesecake and their selection is absolutely amazing. Hubby and I usually share an appetizer and then two cheesecakes. Our favorites include any of the egg rolls, fried Mac and cheese balls and lettuce wraps. And for dessert either the Reese's, the Oreo, the S'more or the the Chocolate Hazelnut (although there are a TON more awesome options)! Another cool factor, if you have a baby they give you complimentary plate of banana slices. Who knew?! My baby boy certainly enjoyed those."
Jacqui C.,"Henderson, NV",53,170,116,5.0,10/18/2017,"If you're willing to come to The Cheesecake Factory for a bite to eat one day, coming during Happy Hour is a must! It's from 4-6 PM every weekday and it's half-off alcoholic drinks and select appetizers. My two friends and I came here during Happy Hour and we were expecting it to be a little busy, but it really wasn't once we walked in...of course it's a Wednesday afternoon. I tried the fried Mac and Cheese, which was excellent, along with a $5.95 margarita. What a deal that was. I'm glad I came during Happy Hour."
Keoni B.,"Henderson, NV",5,67,245,4.0,9/10/2017,Best thing about Cheesecake Factory is that the variety their menu is so big that there is a very good chance that you will find something you will like. The last few times we have come here it seems the server takes a long time to take our order but once they get it things go by pretty fast. Our food was delicious and prepared to our request and the staff friendly.
Michele M.,"Henderson, NV",92,251,403,3.0,4/15/2017,"I love this restaurant and the service inside is fine but take out is horrible! I've had many issues with being put on hold for 10 minutes and my order is wrong 90% of the time. I've started going inside and checking my order before I leave, so I can ask for the items they forgot. (Every time!) It's annoying because they offer curb side takeout but when they forget stuff, you have to wait for them to go back inside and get it.  If I was rating the food, I would give them 5 stars but since I order takeout 95% off the time, my rating is based on the takeout service, which is lacking.  They get super busy, pretty much every day of the week, so be prepared for a wait. They are open until midnight on the weekend and it's way less busy around 10pm."
Stacy E.,"Las Vegas, NV",98,43,16,5.0,11/4/2017,"All you are in need of a good happy hour with decent food, good drinks and Brittney (our waitress). She's what made this happy hour experience 5 stars! According to her she's always there in the bar area...so if you want 5 star service and a good happy hour experience...give Brittney your tip money...you won't be disappointed!"
Edward K.,"Henderson, NV",1,8,4,1.0,12/17/2017,"What a shame-after waiting two hours for our meal we were told just another 10 minutes, new manager in pink shirt is ignorant, we walked out"
Ploi S.,"Las Vegas, NV",83,128,191,4.0,10/26/2017,"I mean if you have a thing for Cheesecake, you go to the factory! I never had bad Cheesecake from here. The atmosphere is quite romantic, at dinner time, you don't have to worry about seeing the real face of your date, cuz the light is really low, guarantee anything would look better in that lighting they set up for ya.  The food is also pretty good, huge portion!! I can't never finished my food. Cheese bread appetizer for $9 is ridiculous when I comes in 6 pieces and the cheese doesn't even melted all the way. I expected more from $9 appetizer.  Big parking lot with specific 15 mins parking spot for pick up order."
Moi M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,3.0,1/7/2018,Nice place.. but.. don't expect good stake..  for meat go to stake restaurant.. here the stake is little  and half of the little stake  is just fat... even the manager said that is nothing to do about it.. it is what it is.. well.. nice place but.. don't ask for any meat..
David M.,"Henderson, NV",0,3,,2.0,1/6/2018,"I suggest not ordering 'To Go'...didn't want to wait an hour for a table on a Saturday night, so we decided to order and pick up. Every single time I order for pick up at this location they get my order wrong or forget something:/ Tonight they forgot the fries to my daughter's kids meal and got my order wrong.. I ordered the teriyaki chicken with brown rice but with boneless chicken breasts instead of the bone in. The rice was undercooked and still hard and they gave me the bone in chicken.. I know they are busy, but if I'm paying $100 including tip for our meal, it should be right."
Lisa ..,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,3,2.0,12/24/2017,"I normally go to the CCF in Boca park, but a friend and I decided to try this location. It was around 2pm and upon entering we saw an older woman at the hostess stand. She glanced up at us, then looked back down. No greeting whatsoever! So I said hello there is 2 of us and she never spoke to us. How rude! CCF needs to realize in a huge way that the hostess is your first point of contact to your guests, and if they don't acknowledge or greet your paying customers, well.... Fast forward a month or so we decide to give this location another try (December 6, 2017). We see the same older woman now working with a hispanic looking young girl. Let me say this...the young girl couldn't even speak proper English and had no personality. That's it CCF, get your act together. Hire people on your front line who are personable, friendly and know how to greet the public!! It's not that hard to do!"
Eliza B.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,25,79,5.0,12/17/2017,Great food and service! Ask for Deann she is very attentive and has great customer service. She was great with my 4 year old twins.
Mark L.,"Lafayette, LA",88,475,580,5.0,7/16/2017,"I am a fan of The Cheesecake Factory chain and I think they must have a secret record for the largest menu in a chain restaurant.   There isn't much you can't get here and there is something for everyone.  Chicken, steaks, seafood, burgers(which are incredible), pasta, Mexican and the list goes on and on.   The best part is their huge range of desserts and cheesecakes.  I can't remember the exact number but there are 20 or so flavors of Cheesecake with each sounding better than the last.  They also have ice cream and lots of other desserts.   My latest visit was for a party of 8 and we had a wonderful time.  I didn't mention the drinks but they do have a nice wine selection, a full menu of mixed drinks unique to their franchise and of course they can make you a cocktail of choice.  If you want a great restaurant with awesome desserts, be certain to stop here."
Edith G.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,13,23,4.0,10/23/2017,"I come here a lot just because of the cheesecake.   I just love it.  But dining here sometimes makes you don't want a come back. The reason why is my food never come out right sometimes.  The tables inside are so close to each other.  That's why I like seating outside. The food is a lot.  This place is always busy too.  Anyway, overalI I will still come back hehehe.  Can't stay away from those cheesecake."
Mickey A.,"Dallas, TX",52,87,90,3.0,8/6/2017,"I gave thrm 3 stars because of the horrible service we got. I rarely give 3 star reviews , none of the food we ordered arrived on-time to our satisfaction. I had to ask for the bread-and-butter more than 3 times . And I was given the excuse that it's in the oven , which I can understand because it was a busy night. We ordered some beers that came without the foam on the top , and we got a horrible excuse that beers don't come with forming the on the top. Like always the food was very good. I would still recommend this place I just hope you guys will get a good service. DO NOT ORDER BEER"
Jay J.,"Las Vegas, NV",175,539,427,3.0,4/21/2017,"We just ordered to go.  It was easy and fast, service was great.  I asked for a to go menu, the guy gave me the restaurant menu.    I ordered the garden salad and pizza.  Hubby loves there meatloaf.  So when we got it home, my pizza wasn't even a little warm, it was cold.  We don't live that far from this place for that pizza to be that cold, so that was a disapointment.  The salad just had tomatoes in it.  So I had to come home and doctor it up.   Yeaaaa, I wouldn't ever order this again"
Monique A.,"Pittsburg, TX",930,324,1175,4.0,3/24/2017,"Really no complaints, we arrived here at 11am and there was no wait. We got seated immediately.  Server and manager both came by table immediately being seated. Service was excellent, we had Traci, she explained a few items on the menu we were interested in and check on us through our meal. I ordered the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Tacos, husband got the skinny Chicken Pot Pie, and our friend got the Ahi Tuna Salad.  Only downside I encountered was the bathroom, certainly was clean but they used a very dirty mop. Left a mad smell in the bathroom."
Bekah S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",49,141,272,4.0,5/31/2017,I adore CF's Thai Lettuce wraps.  It's an appetizer but filling enough for a meal and the sauces that accompany the chicken satay are amazing!   All in all I don't usually go for anything else on the menu.  My husband likes the Louisiana chicken and we both like the fresh bread served as an appetizer.  CF is usually crowded and loud.  But the service is typically good and the portion sizes are huge!
Brian F.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,117,261,5.0,9/29/2016,"I don't know what it is about this place, but Cheesecake Factory just seems to always be on point. No matter if it's this location or any other location across the country, Cheesecake Factory is just consistent and delicious.  This place is pretty much a great restaurant that caters to all. You come here and always see large groups of families, especially little ones. If you come for lunch, this seems to be the spot for moms/wife's lunch dates with their friends. High school kids date nights. Or, for myself, just your casual Friday night date spot with the girlfriend. There is always a line here and usually always a wait. However, it's so big and they have such a big staff and kitchen, the wait is never that long. The food here seems to always hit the spot. They have something for every taste bud. Not the greatest, but they a pretty good job for every kind of dish for a place that doesn't specialize in one thing. The portions are huge. Some of my favorites are: Red Sangria Chinese Chicken Salad Salmon Kale Salad Beet and Goat Cheese Pear Goat cheese flatbread (substitute blue cheese for goat cheese - thank me later) Chicken Nachos Chicken Gyoza  Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken Orange Chicken Spicy Cashew Chicken Egg rolls  And of course - the cheesecake Just overall a great spot."
Brian S.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,251,80,4.0,4/9/2017,"It is a Cheesecake Factory so you know what to expect.   -massive menu -huge portions of food -consistently good presentation and taste -pricey food costs -decadent cheesecake dessert  -take home boxes galore -loud / crowded / insane dining room Not much else to say.  You either are OK with Cheesecake Factory or you aren't.   It isn't for me but I get the appeal so putting aside my personal views, it gets 4 stars from me."
Isaac D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,2,5.0,8/11/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is in a great location right off of the 215 and Green Valley. Lots of available parking, comparatively speaking to the Summerlin location at Boca Park. We arrived at 6:30pm this Friday night and waited for about 30 minutes. Even though it was really busy, none of the servers seemed to be running around with no remorse for guests who were waiting in the lobby/hostess area. I've been to Cheesecake Factory's in the past where this has happened. After we sat down we were greeted by our waitress Andrea R. Very knowledgeable, very friendly and patient. DEFINITELY, three important qualities needed for working here as a server.  We started with avocado egg rolls and buffalo blasts. Avocado egg rolls, as always were fantastic. Buffalo blasts were great as well, however it seems there's a little too much extra breading around the outside. I'm sure for the cooking style it's beneficial, and they are still very delicious otherwise and definitely a sufficient enough portion.  Since the dishes are so plentiful, I chose to order an additional appetizer, the Crabcakes. They were fantastic (even though I only enjoyed one of the three) and served fairly well. The only adjustment to this dish I would make is how the Crabcakes are served. They are presented on a bed of Chinese noodles (little foam type noodles). As you cut through the Crabcakes the noodles stick to the Crabcake and it changes the consistency of the bite. The crabcake itself was DELICIOUS. But, it would have been far better if I didn't have to fight noodles through every bite!  After dinner I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Cup Ripple Cheesecake and it is wonderful. Not too sweet, very satisfying if you're a chocolate lover.  The service here is excellent, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere like any Cheesecake Factory is comfortable. I will come back here again and I would recommend any one else too as well."
Jae B.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,13,1,3.0,12/6/2017,There is no baby changing station in the Men's restroom. You know how very upsetting that is for a father to change their child's diaper on the dirty floor?? Why is there not a baby changing station? Yes the food service is great. The food itself is wonderful. But to not have a baby changing station in the men's restroom is very very upsetting. In fact I was livid......
