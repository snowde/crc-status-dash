Robyn W.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,37,59,4.0,12/26/2015,"One of my favorite restaurants! Their big menu has a lot of variety and it's truly a blessing if you're a vegetarian! Their avocado eggrolls are yummy and their eggplant parmesan is amazing!!!!! The eggplant is cooked perfectly and is crispy on the outside and tender in the center - not soggy. The pasta for the eggplant parm has pesto in it that is so delicious! Their cheesecake is my all-time favorite dessert ever. OK, some cons to be fair: this location is usually busy, tables are really really close together (feels like you're all in one party with your neighbors), and they do not clean the booth-style seating or their floors very well - you will find bread crumbs 9/10 times because they simply wipe the tables really quick in between patrons and a lot of the the bread crumbs seem to land on the floors/seats. Otherwise, great place to eat! I def. recommend!"
Mari L.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",200,35,227,5.0,6/11/2015,"First off I love Cheesecake Factory!! This location is great and never too busy!

Tracy was very friendly and always smiling making sure everything was good. Overall, phenomenal!"
Danielle F.,"Henderson, NV",186,1,,2.0,8/13/2016,"Food is always good here although the service is usually good from Jeffery and Sara . Jessica was my server today and she took 15 minutes to ask for our drink , another 20 to ask if we wanted an appetizer and so on throughout the meal . she had attitude and rarely checked on us. She never brought us anything until we asked we had to interrupt her to get the things we should have been offered . overall bad experience . But will continue to come for the food and other servers ."
Mindy O.,"Henderson, NV",2,40,33,5.0,7/5/2016,"Great food, excellent service! The staff will go out of their way to make your meal exactly what you want!"
Krissan J.,"Las Vegas, NV",235,16,14,5.0,4/4/2016,Went to dinner with family that was from out of town and we all had the best dinning experience. Our server Katia was very informative with every question we had and just made it an awesome time!!
Chrystee Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",283,190,134,5.0,3/30/2016,"Hello everyone!!! I just want to say that if you want a truly amazing dining experience, eat at this cheesecake factory location!! I'd recommend the Alfredo or steak tacos! The chocolate cheesecake is creamy and perfect as well! To top all of this off, the staff is gorgeous and super friendly!"
Tommy D.,"Las Vegas, NV",346,290,459,4.0,6/2/2014,One thing about cheesecake factory that I love is that they stay consistent with food..their menu is always the same and each dish is prepared the same every time. When you come here the only thing that may bug me is their service.It's like one day I'll eat here and the server is awesome and the next time it's the total opposite.But I will gladly take it for the food is key. I normally stick to a couple things here but I've tried alot of things that are amazing. My faves are Ahi tempura roll Shrimp and bacon club Rib eye steak with garlic mashed potatoes that comes with one delicious onion ring( I wish they came with 5 of them..lol) Miso salmon (sometimes the rice is too hard and uncooked) Cabonara  Of course the red velvet cheesecake is the best (Ive tried alot of other dishes here like breakfast stuff like the chicken hash and the Monte cristo sandwich but they weren't really memorable) Oooh and don't forget about that bread! Yummy! I will always have cheescake factory as an option for a meal any day of the week
Cesar M.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",109,106,111,5.0,6/26/2015,Came in for lunch. The service was awesome! The food was delicious and of course the cheese cake was amazing! Our waters were always filled. Restrooms were super clean. you can never go wrong with cheesecake factory! I loved how some servers are out at work. Wearing rainbow ties. :)
Keila O.,"Sunrise, Las Vegas, NV",18,30,20,4.0,9/25/2015,"The food is delicious! Except for the hosts, one of the girls were kind of rude not smiling and just made me feel uncomfortable. Overall I would defiantly come back. Also Amy our server was super nice, very fast, kept our drinks filled asked us questions about our order to make sure it's correct, great friendly girl. If I come back I'm going to ask for her, she was amazing. Great great customer service."
Debra S.,"Las Vegas, NV",55,64,200,5.0,8/22/2015,"The packed parking lot speaks for Henderson locals who flock to this place well ahead of the dinner hour. We arrived at 5pm and still had to get on a waiting list for a table. The service, the menu and the atmosphere are top notch. My first visit because I thought it was a dessert place because of the name! Much more than could be anticipated and the appetizers, entrees and desserts were definitely a photo opportunity here."
Holly F.,"Henderson, NV",6,8,1,5.0,6/23/2016,Absolutely love Cheesecake Factory especially the happy hour.  My favorite place to celebrate my birthday every year.  Something for everyone.  Love the Godiva Gluten-Free Cheesecake!
Jessica C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1075,275,379,5.0,8/13/2016,"I came here for my 21st birthday back in May. I was seated 10 minutes after arriving. They have a bar where you can just sit down at and drink a bit. They also have a to-go station where you can also order cheesecake by the slices or by whole! The server (I can't remember his name sadly) was really amazing! He made sure that my birthday was special. I got the shrimp summer rolls to start off. Sooo delicious. The sauce was amazing! Even the plating was beautiful! For the main plate I got the Chicken Madeira. I now know why it's the most popular plate. It's so big and just amazing. So many flavors. I could not find one bad thing about it. I also got a tall blue moon. That was a little weird because it didn't have any foam which means it was sitting out for a while. I was way too full to even get cheesecake but the food was definitely worth it. All in all, amazing! I love the food, layout, and service here!"
Anna P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,11,5.0,1/26/2016,Second time going to this location both times I been there I had the best servers. I recently went there for my husbands birthday. The young man was very polite and helpful he answered all the questions we had about the menu and even recommended some of their popular plates. He was right our food came out on time and hot didn't have to wait long. Staff was super friendly I just loved it !  I want to thank them all!  I will be coming back for my mothers birthday!
Darrell S.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,149,248,4.0,6/25/2015,"Stopped by for lunch and drank a green iced tea that I couldn't get enough of. Sat at the bar with Jennifer who was just the sweetest thing ever. I had tuna tartar and a salad, it's in the triple digits outside so thank you for having the ac cranked up. I haven't had  cheese cake in a while but know they are awesome , wouldn't mind one now."
Tracy S.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,47,87,4.0,5/8/2016,Always pretty good service. They have a very large menu with a lot of variety. Something for everyone. We've come for breakfast items as well as dinner. Never disappoints.
Tina K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,5.0,1/2/2017,We had Dontae as our waiter tonight. He was very polite and explained everything very well to us. Very good waiter. The food was excellent. He helped me decide on what dessert I should get and his choice was perfect. The place was jam packed. Great atmosphere. Great job Cheesecake Factory.
KT N.,"Henderson, NV",4,43,6,3.0,8/8/2015,"Food is always fresh and delicious... But I'm just tired of the service.  Been at this location three times.  1 out of 3 was decent.  The last time, my fiancé and I just walked out.  We were seated to the left in a little circular room.  The waitress was busy, but I was very hangry.  It's not her fault; we all have been in an overwhelming situation... That didn't put me in a bitter mood.  What put me in a bitter mood was the host.  When he guided us to our table, there was food debris on the booth.  I asked him if he could wipe it off, he stood there for 5 seconds looking at me like I was pulling his teeth...  I wouldn't mind brushing off a few crumbs off a table, but I will not when it's wet and someone's butt was on it and I'm about to eat with my clean hands. Anyway, it'll take some time for me to come back to this location...  But kudos to the chef and food runner."
Natasha N.,"Henderson, NV",6,26,15,1.0,5/25/2015,"ONLY GIVING ONE STAR BC THE FOOD TASTED FINE.  The curbside to go service is a complete joke. I had problems last time with them forgetting half my order. I figured it was a fluke mistake and thought I'd try the curbside pick up again. I placed my order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 mins. Great!  I go to pick it up, park in the designated curbside pick up parking spot, and call to let them know I was outside waiting. I WAITED 18 MINUTES!! They never brought out my food. My husband, growing more and more impatient, went inside to pick it up. They asked for the name of our order and when he told them, they were like ""oops you're orders been on the counter this whole time."" How professional. Apparently the workers here can't do there job. Won't be back."
Ginger P.,"Henderson, NV",737,10,,1.0,12/10/2016,"I only rankn1 star because wait staff if awesome,  management couldn't be worse....I went with my kid and his girlfriend,  we sat at a 4 top. 11 people came behind us, kept getting pushed and elbowed, asked 4 manager. She, Alicia said it was fine,  I asked sincenonlyb4 chair's shouldn't that matter, she said there was enough chairs, treated us horribly....no one cared how we were mistreated...as we were leaving asked 4 manager again, another man came up said he would put is at a table,  wouldn't share bhhs name of other managers name....wow,  where is this considered customer service?"
Micah O.,"Henderson, NV",1062,66,1485,3.0,1/21/2016,"So many people give the cheesecake factory such a big hype! I don't get it. Decent service, but mediocre food. I've only been here a couple times, so maybe it's not just for me to have such a strong opinion yet. I recent when for a kid's birthday party there. We arrived at 5 pm ( they don't take reservations), there were only 20 of us to which they said It'd be a half hour wait. An hour and fifteen minutes later we are finally seated. The service was great. Very fast paced, they got us what we needed. The cocktails were nice! The bread was just bread, nothing spectacular. I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta for the main course. It was decent, but I had to order a side of Buffalo sauce and chili flakes. Barely any spice to it. I was rather satisfied with the portion though. Dessert was great of course. Who can go wrong with red velvet and lemon raspberry cheesecake. Overall this place wasn't bad, I just don't see myself coming here anytime soon."
