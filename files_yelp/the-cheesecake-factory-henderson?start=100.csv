Laura M.,"Henderson, NV",143,124,73,5.0,12/9/2016,"Came here with a party of 8 for my friend birthday! The wait wasn't horrible for Friday (about 45min) but I have to say that the server nick was absolutely Amazing! He attended to our entire party well (refill in timely manner, always asked if we needed anything else CONSTANTLY) this guy is awesome! Great job Cheesecake Factory :)"
Casey Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",64,15,1,2.0,7/8/2017,"We've been to this location multiple times over the years.  The food is typically delicious and service great.  The biggest problem is getting a table. Our most recent experience was a Saturday night during dinner time with a group of 10. We understand that makes it more difficult, but the restaurant didn't handle it correctly. We were told the wait for a table would be 45-50 minutes, but we're not seated until over an hour and twenty minutes elapsed. The worst part was that it was clear that the restaurant was not properly staffed for a Saturday night. They had an entire section of tables empty while the lobby was full of people waiting.  We suspect that the kitchen was understaffed because f he amount of time it took to get food out. Again, food was delicious and waiter was great but the mismanagement of the staffing is almost enough to make me not want to come back."
Danielle K.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,11,,4.0,6/17/2017,"I typically order to-go as it's always super crowded. My order is always right, portions are huge, and they deliver curb side which is great when you have kids"
Shirley S.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",19,10,6,3.0,6/29/2017,"The food is good. The service was all over the place, but mostly bad. We were forgotten and remembered too many times. We wanted to order cheesecake at the end of the meal, but got so sick of waiting we just said check please. We waited for that too for far too long. Again the food was really good. Service not so much."
Jessica W.,"Henderson, NV",2,157,83,5.0,4/28/2016,Food: my go to is on the Skinnylicious Menu - Lemon Shrimp. I always request a side of lemons to make it extra lemony. Cooked perfectly and just the right serving size. Service: we grabbed hi-top seats in the bar area and our server was attentive. Location: in The District - very convenient and parking was easy. Would come back!
Gloria W.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,22,,2.0,7/16/2017,"I had the chicken salad sandwich with the side salad.  The sandwich was cut into very narrow portions maybe 1 inch by 3 or so inches long.  I saw a lot of tomato and lettuce between those little strips of bread and very little chicken salad.  Hard to eat without it spilling out all over the place.  The chicken salad itself was very disappointing.  Very bland with virtually nothing in it. And that poor side salad - looks like a bagged salad mix of baby greens and other lettuces that came to me looking like the dressing had been poured on it and it had sat awhile,   it was completely wilted and limp.  Very unappetizing. I wound up eating part of my husband's Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich which was pretty good.  We decided to split a key lime cheesecake which is very good.  I think this restaurant's forte is in the desserts."
Jane J.,"Henderson, NV",0,32,,4.0,4/3/2017,"I love, love the food here.  The food quality is superb. However the downsides are this place is almost always loud & crowded. It is difficult to have a quiet meal here. They never take a reservation for any reason. I wish they did. Wait times; u will have a 30 minute or more wait outside the restaurant. I personally think they should offer a discount to regular customers or locals, on entrees or specialty meals. I would come more often if it werent for the high price tab. It is also very expensive to get a drink at this place. Therefore this can be an expensive date night"
Michael M.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,134,166,4.0,1/7/2017,"Had a great meal , Andrew had the Bistro Shrimp Pasta, he said it was amazing, I had Fish and Chips that were pretty good. Bernardo was our server, he was great, fast and friendly, we have been to this Cheesecake Factory quite a few times and he was the best server ever. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for such a great employee. I hope this review is shared with him."
Kristal L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,2,5.0,11/29/2016,"Came here tonight and had a great experience! Heather was the best server that we've had here. We brought our 1 year old son with us and when she dropped off our drinks, she brought him sliced bananas. Our son is very impatient and likes to eat as soon as we sit. That was the kindest gesture that a server has done for us.  Thank you, Heather! You are awesome!"
Angel H.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,37,9,2.0,5/28/2017,"My first time going here...First and last! I was not impressed. I didn't want to send my plate back, but it was not good. The Steak Diane had 3 small pieces of steak that was cold about a fork full of caramelized onions and 2 mushrooms with very little sauce. I get that it was a combination plate hence the extra small portion. The Herb Crusted salmon was dry and a little burnt. I don't like to send food back, especially when it takes almost an hour to get food! I also fear that someone may spit on my food. The dessert and service were decent. For the price, the meal was lacking."
Junior C.,"Oxnard, CA",46,1,,5.0,7/2/2017,"Last night we decided last minute to rush over to the Cheescake Factory located on Green Valley Pkwy.  We made it in just before closing time at midnight we were greeted with smiles and very courteous staff. Our server was Shawna. She was absolutely the sweetest person and treated us with excellent customer service. Our food was delicious and we were there to celebrate my sister in laws birthday, by the time we were finished with our dinner the restaurant was completely empty. The staff brought over a complimetery ice cream and sang happy birthday to her. I would highly recommended this restaurant to anyone  taking the time to read this review...my hat off to you the staff at Cheescake Factory for making our dining experience a memorable one for us. Thank you again from our family!"
Rita M.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,6,,2.0,6/30/2017,"If wasn't for the manager Don I would be giving this place zero stars if that was possible, my burger was so raw I couldn't eat it, my food came out at least 5minutes after my wife's so there was no point in having them remake it since my wife had already ate half of hers. Our waitress Brittany  H was by far the worse and rudest waitress we have ever had. From throwing our bill on the table to overcharging us then when I asked about it she refused to honor the price and said it was my fault she over charged me. Luckily Don the manager was working because she at least put some positive experience into going there in fixing our bill, apologizing for her waitress, even gave us free desert for our constant troubles."
Kim D.,"Las Vegas, NV",119,4,,5.0,7/31/2016,"Hands down always delicious!!! Consistency is definitely key here.  You'll never be disappointed.  Vanilla Bean Cheesecake!!! The BEST!  Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane, to Die for!  Jambalaya & Gumbo BOMB.COM"
Sara B.,"Las Vegas, NV",146,4,,1.0,1/28/2017,"MOST RUDE RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES AT THE DISTRICT. First, I called to make an order for pick up and I was put on hold for 12 minutes until I hung up and called again. The second time I was hung up on. The third time I spoke to the manager, Ashley(?), and she was abrupt rude and acted as if I was an inconvenience for calling. She transferred me to make the order and the girl who tried to take the order was rude as well. I gave up on calling AS YOU COULD IMAGINE! I love cheesecake factory but this one is just a complete mess. Saving you a trip, people!! I went to Sammy's Restaurant down the street instead and it was great(:"
Mr Photo Mtb F.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,94,33,5.0,7/9/2017,Today we're having avocado rolls and chicken salad and cheesecake the service is good and great bread love it
Catherine C.,"Anaheim, CA",6,5,,5.0,3/23/2017,"Illyana is the best!!!! After having an absolute terrible experience a few months back at the Boca park location, this was such a great experience to have!!! She was super attentive, always made sure our drinks were full and she just looks like she enjoys what she does! Thank you illyana!!!!"
Vicky H.,"Henderson, NV",37,17,,1.0,9/30/2017,The hostess squeezes 7 people into a small booth and did nothing when was told its too small She adds a chair to the end if table for an adult to sit in the aisle and got bumped and had to get up multiple times We were all very uncomfortable especially after waiting 40 min for a table and it was not very busy This was at 6 pm on fri 9/29 We spent over $200 and had a horrible dinner This was our second large party in 2 months We will not be coming back anymore
Michel F.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,12,29,1.0,7/5/2017,"1 star for the dirty restrooms. Some photos I took are tasteless to post, but the ones I am posting will suffice."
Bethany E.,"Henderson, NV",915,947,3691,4.0,2/15/2015,"Huge improvement over the last few years.  I have been to different Cheesecake Factories.  Upon first visiting this location in the District, I wasn't impressed.  After giving them another shot, I was pleasantly surprised of the vast improvement of service and food.   Service here has been very attentive and friendly.  Drinks are refilled and food is served promptly.  Even the girls at the hostess station are more welcoming.   The food dishes such as the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is becoming my favorite dish served here.  There are plenty of chicken and shrimp surrounding the rice.  The spicy Thai sauce is filled with flavors of curry, peanut, chile and coconut.  Every bite is delicious.   Of course it's hard to leave here without ordering cheesecake.  It is an extensive variety to choose from.  I have yet to try one I didn't like.  Plus the slices are so huge and easily split with someone.   I'm happy to say I'll be back soon for more."
Ashley V.,"Las Vegas, NV",142,18,35,5.0,2/13/2016,"I've been here a couple times, just haven't really gotten around to writing a review until now. This place is a substantial restaurant; clean, friendly staff, and good food.  Tonight was our early valentines dinner, my boyfriend got the garlic pasta and I got the stuff chicken tortillas. 5/5 for the both of them!! At the end of our dinner we got a strawberry cheese cake (who doesn't get cheesecake here??) and a smoothie. Overall experience was pleasant, our food was good and the service was comfortably quick. No complaints about tonight!"
