Leon P.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,49,17,5.0,12/8/2016,Great place to eat with the family. Excellent service and you're seated quickly. The food is always great and there are a ton of things to choose from. I highly recommend their Louisiana Chicken Pasta! Always on point. Love this place.
Rachel T.,"Irvine, CA",67,969,239,4.0,7/29/2016,"This place was really good. Went to celebrate my moms birthday here. I like how big the booths are perfect for large parties. Also we came at a great time, before the dinner rush. The service was great and the food was good. I tried the crab cakes which were great. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. Huge meatballs with great flavor and very moist. We had the lunch entrees which were huge. Enough for leftovers. Most commercial chain restaurants do not offer their lunch menus on the weekends .Cheesecake Factory you still got it."
Charlene F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",107,4,,3.0,12/15/2016,"On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair, the smell of the Cheesecake Factory was rising up through the air, OK I will focus now, bus seriously I am living in Henderson Nevada now and it kind of felt that way Tried the happy hour here on a Tuesday night. Nice, comfy chain place, bar area was well lit, bartender was attentive and professional, definitely not lacking in service, 5 stars here. Stayed for 2 hours had a couple glasses of house Chardonnay, $5.95 & yummy. Going to go back and do another Happy, this time with the food. Driving home I could have sworn I heard the nightman say we are programmed to receive, you can drive home anytime you want but you can never leave..."
Nelson Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",2738,1403,29290,4.0,11/19/2014,"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(312/365) ""The Default Dinner"" Brain Fart-when you can't recall something that you wanted to say or mention, and its at the tip of your tongue, but still can't remember? Food Fart-my term for when you are hungry, but you can't decide even with the HUNDREDS of dining options and cuisines in the 702 AND the Yelp App where you want to grab a bite to eat???? Anyone else run into this problem?  Anywho, we were on this side of town and we didn't care for anywhere on the strip(don't think anyone who works on the Strip cares either)and we were Chinatown'd out (also a famous area for Dirty Dining lately...looking at you, Joyful House!) Prices are very reasonable here and the portions are HUMANGOUS which is why I like to order off their Small Plates Menu and I always get the Pear, Bleu Cheese,  and Pecan Flatbread which has always been consistently good. I also got the Veggie Fries Combo which came with Portabellos, Zucchini, and Avocados. The avocados were my least favorite because they have no business being in the fryer IMO. These are one of those things that are great as-is. Totally stuffed from dinner, we had no room for dessert, but we were pleased with our meal.  This is the first time though that our server kinda sucked. She just looked like she didn't want to be there...lucky we didn't let her ruin our visit. Next time you find yourself having a food fart, Cheesecake Factory may just be a good option!   ALOHA!!!! Shaka Meter:  \uuu/   \uuu/   \uuu/   \uuu/  4 *Sorry for the dark photos...CF's lighting ain't the greatest and I didn't want to be ""that guy""..."
Demi T.,"Henderson, NV",27,20,6,4.0,5/18/2017,"Beautiful restaurant that's very large inside. The place was packed with customers around 5pm, so it was pretty loud inside. The cheesecakes are sold by the entrance, where you can purchase whole cheesecakes or slices. The pricing for them was surprisingly high. Some of the whole cheesecakes ranged from $20 to $50 or more. The slices were $7 to $9, which are small in length, but a lot taller than the normal cheesecake you would find somewhere else so the slices are still very fulfilling. When we first came in, the hostess wasn't very welcoming, but the servers were great throughout the entire time we dined there! They were attentive and friendly. The food was awesome, it was freshly cooked and hot. The wait time for the food wasn't long at all, approximately 10 minutes. Overall, I do recommend trying this restaurant."
Jaymi U.,"Henderson, NV",119,2,,1.0,5/15/2017,"Bad service on this particular visit. Was there to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. Told the waiter we were there to celebrate her birthday.When it was time for dessert, my girlfriend picked out her cheesecake. I got my phone ready to record the singing celebration but it didn't happen. Instead the waiter brought the cheesecake over with the bill and left. This upset me because other tables got sang to. My girlfriend did not want to make a big scene of it but I know she was hurt. Thank you to the waiter for the bad service and making my girlfriend feel less special."
Kathryn T.,"Milton, FL",61,2,1,5.0,5/13/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of our very  favorite restaurants.  The closest one to our town is 4 hours away. When we travel we always search Yelp for one to stop and eat! Love starting off with their delicious crusty bread.  I enjoy their enchilada with corn cakes and black beans.  My husband always gets burrito grande!  The food presentation is beautiful and the food delicious.  Portions are very generous.  There is hardly ever room for the delicious dessert they are known for.  If that is the case,  I get it to go."
Tara G.,"Henderson, NV",5,57,21,2.0,1/12/2017,"The salmon was gross. Had it simply grilled and it tasted extremely fishy.  I eat fish almost every night (out) and this was unacceptable.  Waiter asked how it was, I told him, tasted bad, no response.  Veggies also came with butter.  Ordered no butter. Never again.  I'll go to Bella Vita for fresh fish:)"
Anne S.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,186,148,1.0,10/10/2015,"I come here often and I usually come here for the good service but tonight.. everything just went wrong!  First off, we got our bread we only got the sourdough. I know, for someone who comes here often, That were supposed to get both wheat and sourdough. We had to chase someone to get us wheat bread since that's the only bread I eat.  Then we finally ordered. Good thing we got there before it got busy. As it was getting busy, we saw each table getting sat. We patiently waited for our food that took ALMOST 30 MINUTES without the server even telling us that our food is coming up or updating us or whatever. We saw the table over (who got there about 7 minutes after us) get their food first!!!!!!!  Then upon getting boxes, our server goes, ""okay KIDS can I get you anything else"". That's soooooo rude! I don't go to a restaurant saying ""okay GRANDMA this is what I want"" to my server. So since I was a ""kid"" we tipped like we were ""kids"". Maybe that's why we didn't get the service we deserved cause we were ""kids""  NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN! I would rather spend my money somewhere else! Thanks cheesecake factory for ruining our date tonight. We'll make sure to recommend you to someone who wants to have a horrible night."
Renee B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,2,5.0,3/28/2017,"I know - it's a chain.  I live walking distance to the Cheesecake Factory.  I love that they offer a HUGE reduced calorie menu.  They have a whole menu of skinnylicious items, that are all delicious and under 590 calories.  If you want to splurge, of course, they have a HUGE regular menu, and incredible cheesecake.  Don't skip going to Cheesecake Factory if you think you will ruin your diet - trust me - they have a lot of healthy options."
Lisa J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,1,2.0,3/26/2017,"We are visiting Las Vegas for my sisters birthday and decided to go to my favorite restaurant back home and celebrate. Why did we go here, Chris the waiter is rude and is unhappy with his job. We were treated so cold. He was glaring at us and purposely slow with service the whole time. I'm sorry he was not pleased with us just on sight for no reason( we are black), but I left him a nice tip anyway hoping he will treat the next group with respect. ( Beware folks never again)!!"
Jamison G.,"Las Vegas, NV",411,127,786,4.0,9/7/2015,Decided to go here and mix it up a little since we had a gift card today.  They were pretty busy since it is Labor Day.   First I tried the Fried calamari that was  light and Crisp served with garlic sauce. Decided to go with glam burger. It was served with french fries and green salad sweet potatoes I wanted to try that Kobe burger which was a American-style Kobe be with sautéed mushrooms and spicy mayo and onions. The food was great but the service declined as the place got busier.
Larissa C.,"Albuquerque, NM",101,100,18,3.0,6/22/2016,"The good: My favorite appetizer here are the Buffalo Blasts, they taste so good, but are so bad for you. The food was good, as always. I really liked the smores cheesecake we had for dessert.  The bad: I was here on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Service ran quite a bit slower than normal; we had to ask auxiliary staff for water and bread to tide us over until our food came. Our server seemed overwhelmed, so that made her more short (but not rude) than maybe she usually is.  I usually get great service at the Cheesecake factory, hopefully things will be better next time."
Jamie P.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,430,758,4.0,9/16/2014,"I forgot how much I like this place. I wish they didn't have so many items on the menu though. I'm horrible at deciding what to eat, and with a million choices it makes it that much harder for me. I looked at the menu for a good 20 minutes. I finally chose the bbq bacon burger. It came piled high with crispy onion rings, bbq sauce and bacon. It was deelicious! I got a side of the ranch to dip my fries into and it's the best Ranch I've ever had. It's garlicky and has a bit of a kick to it. So good. You can purchase a jar to go, FYI. My other half had the pasta carbonara with chicken and he really liked it. Others in our party had bbq chicken pizza, fettuccine alfredo, corn dogs and a club sandwich. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Now you can't go to CCF and not order cheesecake. I spent another 20 mins deciding which flavor I wanted. I finally chose the oreo and it was amazing. I also got to sample the smores, reeses, and banana cream pie cheesecakes. They were all pretty good. The reeses has an over powering peanut butter flavor which I didn't really care for. The smores one was really good and the banana cream was good as well. I can't wait until they have their pumpkin cheesecake. I love that you can walk in and just purchase cheesecake by the slice without having to dine in. I will be back."
Judy W.,"Henderson, NV",361,13,5,5.0,4/15/2017,I come here just for their variety of cheesecakes. And I always end up taking them home to my kids too. Love their desert menu.
Ed A.,"Long Beach, CA",2,14,39,1.0,10/19/2015,"Food wasn't that good and very expensive. Thank God we had a gift certificate  Orange chicken was dry, and tasteless. Bang Bang chicken for $18 was not very good.  Won't be back"
Justin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,20,19,4.0,2/18/2017,Great food can't say much more. Flat out great food and the bar service was great. Thanks for the great time. Waiting area sucks took a -
Kevin G.,"Henderson, NV",389,68,199,4.0,7/14/2015,"If you are hungry and not sure what kind of ""food mood"" you are in, the cheesecake factory is your spot! The menu must be at least 10 pages and includes almost every type of food.   Some of my favorites on the menu are the cobb salad, clubhouse sandwich, bbq chicken sandwich, fish tacos, chicken penne pasta, and grande burrito.  I have had almost every type of dessert that they offer and by far my favorite is the snickers cheesecake.   The service at this location has always been excellent and although it gets extremely busy towards dinner time, they are prompt and never have too long of a wait until you sit down.   Overall, I have had nothing but great experiences and delicious food at Cheesecake factory and I recommend it if you are looking for a wide variety of food and large portions for a reasonable price."
Rocco P.,"Henderson, NV",18,56,131,4.0,7/17/2015,"We went here for dinner last night and had a great time, the atmosphere was very nice and inviting. Our waitress was very fast and knowledgeable of the menu and knew what she was doing. While the service was great, the food left a little to be desired. We started with the crab and artichoke dip. This was served with buttered pieces of toast. The dip was just drowning in oils and grease. It was like dipping grease into grease, not very good in my opinion. For our main corse I ordered the chicken madeira. For being the most famous dish, it was not really what I had my expectations set for. It was a great dish none the less and was prepaired flawlessly. The chef plated it very beautifully aswell.  My fiancé ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combination. Again the presentation was very beautiful and the only critic she had was that the scampi was a bit tangy for her taste. For desert we ordered the tiramisu and lemon meringue cheesecake to go, both were very good. We will be coming back here forsure, it was totally worth what we had spent and the items left us very curious about other items on the menu."
Chris M.,"Henderson, NV",1,20,20,5.0,10/30/2016,I had the pepperoni pizza and small salad lunch combo. My wife had enchiladas. We had lemonade that was pretty strong. We both enjoyed our food.
