Tim W.,"Henderson, NV",0,21,,3.0,2/22/2017,"Ordered delivery thru one of those services.  Got a burger, fries and cheesecake.  Even though food arrived 15 minutes before that what they said, which was great, the fries were cold. Hamburger was cooked as I requested, most places get that wrong, but it was nothing special. Never had their cheesecake before and I thought it was average, which was disappointing considering the name of their company. Delivery driver was super nice."
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,4.0,5/5/2014,"Staying in Henderson this Cheesecake Factory was the first I've visited which I didn't have to wait for seating at dinner. I was seated at a booth which I requested and was comfy. My friendly waitress greeted me asap and gave me a menu with the large variety of choices to choose from. I ended up going with the Salmon Miso which was topped on steamed rice and served with pea pods. The fish was fresh & moist and the miso sauce went good when combined with the rice and pods. Instead of going with a fancy cheesecake I chose the original which was served with whipped cream. The cheesecake was silky smooth and creamy and not overly rich but filling. Overall for me - the large variety of choices, good quality in a pleasant atmosphere make Cheescake Factory a solid choice to dine."
Gil C.,"Henderson, NV",2,13,6,5.0,10/17/2016,My favorite place for great food day or night hands down. They have what must be the worlds best passion iced tea ever. Well my world at least. But pretty much anything on the menu is fantastic. I love the Renee's special with the chicken salad sandwich and salad AND soup. I can barely finish this. The lemon chicken piccata is amazing. The factory burger is amazing. The Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos are great as a light meal. Oh yeah cheesecakes are great too lol but I rarely order.
Lu C.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,28,75,3.0,7/28/2017,"This restaurant is average. Decorations are good, quality of food is correct. But is so cold inside !!! My   meal wasn't the same than my order and the server didn't let us finish our plates ... my friend wanted to eat a cheesecake inside restaurant that the server gives her a bag with the cheesecake inside... we really felt oppressed ! Others places of this franchise are better."
Courtney C.,"Las Vegas, NV",726,497,1157,5.0,8/25/2015,"I am writing this review for John S. in the bar, was so personable! We came in late after a Rebel game and welcomed us with stellar service and always ensured our glasses were full and our food was hot. While we were there, I noticed some regulars who he was greeting by name and vice versa. Hospitality at it's finest - thank you John!"
Laura L.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,1,1.0,12/23/2016,"I do not recommend take out service! It's a shame to call back the restaurant on an item that wasn't put  into your order & you paid for it - and be told ,"" well you can come back and get it!!"" Not an apology or anything! It's Christmas time ... I'm a cool person. It's the holidays - I get it -- your busy but for goodness sake a little sincerity would have been nice...  bah- hum-bug to you to Cheesecake Factory!!! I will not be back !!!"
AnnaBelle J.,"Henderson, NV",28,59,,5.0,10/2/2016,I love this place. I love this company. No matter where you go in the US this brand is consistently giving their all to customer service. There's always a little wait but the food is phenomenal and the variety of all the items on the menu is awesome! There's something in it for everyone.
Michelle S.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,320,1111,5.0,6/2/2014,"Carissa was our cashier & guide to the wonderful world of cheesecake. We told her we all had different food allergies,  mine being wheat.  Mom is lactose intolerant & bf can't have certain fruits like strawberries.  She informed us it's cheaper to buy a cake by the half sizes but we couldn't do it.  She was understanding.  We left happy & boy that chocolate mousse cheesecake was mMm! Thanks Carissa D! :D"
Irma A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Table 92  Server: Clayton H Decided to take my two kids for dessert, started off ok. All we ordered was a chocolate milk, a coffee, 3 waters and two slices of cheesecake.  After waiting about 13 minutes, we get our water, chocolate milk and coffee.   ...he brought creamer but no sugar and walked away.  After about 5 minutes I managed to flag him down and ask for sugar...took about another 5 minutes to get that.  Coffee was cold.  Tried to flag him down but would pass our table quite quickly, finally got his attention and said it would be about 5 minutes there was a new pot of coffee brewing...so now we've been sitting close to 30 minutes and STILL have no cheesecake, my daughter is done with her chocolate milk and I'm still waiting for my coffee...  he now comes out with my coffee and no creamer, I ask for creamer...when he comes back with the creamer...he plops it down on the table and states, ""are you okay ma'am, you don't seem okay?""  I tried to give him the short version of this and his response was, well i'm sorry but as you can see I'm very busy....i state...but all we ordered is cheesecake and after 30 minutes we STILL don't have that.   It was fairly uncomfortable...what was supposed to be a treat for my kids and I turned into this uncomfortable, unnecessarily frustrating situation."
James T.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,29,,2.0,10/16/2016,The food was all right at the best. For a Saturday night wait was kind of long. This place is lower compare to chilli's  with double price. Very disappointed.
Candy R.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",478,92,797,4.0,4/8/2015,They have a really great happy hour I hate that it's only 4-6 most places are 3-7 but the food is very good and the drinks are cheap I'll definitely come back
Amelinda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",957,641,6517,3.0,3/25/2014,"I've only been here a handful of times since I'm not in the Green Valley area often, so it's typically to meet other friends halfway or the location of birthday dinners, etc. I haven't been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory for several years now, however, I've been impressed during my last two visits. One big factor of my newfound respect is the addition of their SkinnyLicious menu. The primary reason I stopped dining with them was because of their calorie-heavy menu (they have pasta dishes that exceed 2,000 calories!). The menu features a list of items that were specially curated to not exceed 490 calories for appetizers and 590 calories for entrees and some items from their regular menu that happen to be under those thresholds. However, as I'm sure you've guessed, the portion sizes are cut dramatically. They apparently don't know how to cook filling and healthy dishes. Off their SkinnyLicious menu, I've tried the Santorini Farro Salad (farro, cucumbers, tomatoes, beets, red onions, feta cheese, tzatziki, and vinaigrette) and Chicken Samosas (crispy wrappers filled with spiced chicken with cilantro sauce). Both surprisingly delicious and not overly terrible for you. The salad was ridiculously small and there were four tiny samosas. The prices weren't bad, but it's sad considering the fact that those dishes were still loaded with calories and fat. I was surprised that their Fried Calamari (served with garlic dip and cocktail sauce) was really good. Also, I've had their Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad (grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, grilled corn, black beans, cucumber, and Romaine) with the dressing on the side. It was tasty and it was such a large portion that I couldn't finish it. The SkinnyLicious menu is great, however, it's really hard to love a place that serves dishes that have more calories than you should consume in a day. It's a shame that a lot of diners are really oblivious to restaurants' nutrition information and obviously, restaurants don't want to be transparent about it. So, although I don't advocate dining at these restaurants, if you do, as I'm sure I will in the future (even though I won't want to), definitely order off the SkinnyLicious menu. Side note: their Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake (seasonal) and many other cheesecakes are really good. Share it with 1-2 people and don't think about the calories."
Lizzy M.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,,5.0,1/16/2017,"Can never go wrong at the Cheesecake Factory.  Awesome service and good, just need to remind myself that need to call ahead to minimize the wait time."
Kate C.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,4,,4.0,9/15/2016,Cheesecake is delicious. Very creamy and soft. The pasta in this place is not that bad as well. Definitely will eat here again.
Melissa C.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",244,581,1664,4.0,4/25/2014,"Sunday brunch is popular here. The menu is like 1,000 pages and extensive. They really could make it more compact. Anywho, I really liked my California omelet, it had lots of toppings and was a generous portion. My family also enjoyed their meals, and we got a comped menu item due to the long wait for it (the manager stopped by to surprise us with this). That was nice of him and certainly appreciated. Good place for large portions and huge variety."
Bradd F.,"Las Vegas, NV",299,295,172,2.0,8/7/2016,"I don't want to give a long term bad review if I have not had long term bad experience, so I suspect I will update this later after my next dining experience there.  Typically we love cheesecake factor however, this trip we had an issue and I was taken back as to how it was handled.   I ordered spaghetti and meatballs for my kids to all share, the first few meatballs were perfect, but the last one I cut into was significantly harder than the others when I did finally break thru, it was a dark brown inside, almost black in some areas.  As someone who cooks, I can not fathom how this kind of a thing happens other than it being an OLD meatball that somehow stayed in the pot well after its expiration date.  I could be wrong on this, but it was not explained to us and I cannot fathom how this could have gotten this way from being overcooked because the outside was not overcooked in any way.  -So, this makes me really disgusted on how this could happen.  The kicker for me is...there was not explaination, no visit from the manager, and no reduction of the bill either.  I was really taken back by it all.  So, I am not sure what happened but it scared me about eating at this location, wondering what their health standards are."
LN W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,357,36,2.0,9/19/2017,"We have been going to this location for about 2 years, with most of our visits in the last year.  The servers, while nice, are not always the brightest and not always the fastest, but they try hard and the food is good.  I was completely shocked today when I went in and asked for a patio table, as we had been allowed to have our two dogs with us (sitting outside of the patio) for several prior visits.  An older lady with a fake tan, a lot of make up, and a shorter blonde bob was completely rude about it and eventually pointed me in the direction of a manager, who was nicer but said only service dogs were allowed and, to my comment that we had been allowed there w/ our dogs many many times before, ""Well, I'll have to train my staff better.""  It may seem like a small sticking point, but I will not be returning to this or any CCF in the future.  Arbitrary rules and rude employees are not my thing."
Brandy S.,"Panama City Beach, FL",137,18,1,5.0,5/28/2016,"I ordered a plate with salmon the plate came out the salmon was raw sent it back and they re-cooked the same piece of fish, I knew this because the big piece I cut in the middle and took a bit out of was still there ! It was now very dry a little crispy I was upset and sent it back and didn't eat dinner and it was my graduation dinner for college and my family was In town I was very upset with the situation and the manager not really doing much about the situation and not being that sorry. However they gave us two slices of cheesecake free but it was a dinner of 6 of us. UPDATE GOT A CALL FROM THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY AND THEY TOOK CARE OF ME FOR THIS INCIDENT, therefor this being my first bad experience they deserve a 5?"
Teri W.,"Henderson, NV",134,833,390,3.0,2/25/2015,"We had dinner at Settebello recently and nothing on their dessert menu interested us. So we decided to walk over to Cheesecake factor to share some cheesecake. It was a Saturday night and the place was jammin. Although, it seemed as if maybe they were short staffed, because at least 1/2 the restaurant was empty, but we had to wait to be seated (along with 3 or 4 other parties in front of us). Once we were seated, it took between 10-15 minutes for our server to approach the table. This wasn't a big deal, because we had already eaten and it gave us time to decide on what slices to order. But if I were hungry, I would have become hangry real quick. We decided to order 3 slices (all cheesecake): Banana cream, key lime and Kahlua Cocoa.  Our server returned a short while later and let us know that they were out of the banana cream and key lime, which were the 2 we really were excited to try.  We were pretty disappointed and I wish he would've known this when we ordered originally. We then decided on the mango key lime and lemon meringue instead. Now, it has been quite a long time (at least a few years) since I have been to Cheesecake Factory. They have a very large menu, and not many places can pull that off. However, the service was painstakingly slow.  We shouldn't be there more than an hour when we just ordered coffee/water and dessert. Although our service was very nice, I just didn't expect to be there as long as we were. It probably took 20-30 minutes just to get our order.  I mean, come on! For 3 slices of cheesecake, which is obviously pre-made? A bit ridiculous. Everything was really tasty, even if it was basically not what we originally wanted. We each had a different favorite - I actually quite liked the lemon meringue, which is not what I thought my favorite would be. The Kahlua Cocoa was really rich, but good as well. The mango key lime was probably my least favorite - I thought the mango over powered the key lime, but it wasn't bad by any means. The prices were reasonable. Our check was $28 for the slices and drinks (1 coffee). Overall, I remembered why I hadn't been in so long, since there are SO many other options in the area. But I would definitely go back!"
Gina K.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",14,11,5,1.0,3/12/2016,"Hit the horrible service trifecta. Place is crazy busy. Our server, Melissa J, is super rude and snotty. Bailey asked for a plain bacon cheeseburger- she told him to look at the menu because they don't come plain and for him to tell her item by item what he DIDN'T WANT on his burger. What part of plain is so hard. I looked at her and said ""plain"" meat cheese and bacon. Got another snotty comment.  Now I know why I hate this place. Thought I would give it another chance, figured a couple of years gave them enough time to get their crap together. guess not! Server should thank her lucky stars she doesn't work for me - cuz she would be on the street quicker that you can say fired! Server heard the kids talking about me writing the monster of a bad review, so she stood around when his burger was delivered and asked if it was plain enough! Seriously!"
