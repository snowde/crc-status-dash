Rosie T.,"Las Vegas, NV",274,183,537,3.0,1/24/2016,"I forgot to update this but after we ate here, I took home my leftovers and when I heated it up the day after, there was sooooo much grease in the bottom of my plate. And if I tilted it over to the side as if I'm draining it, even more grease accumulated- like a quarter cup of it. Needless to say, I threw it out. The pasta is good but I'm pretty sure the dim lighting is what covers up people from seeing the grease."
Shab N.,"Las Vegas, NV",176,15,30,4.0,8/9/2015,"I went out to eat with my family tonight to eat at Cheesecake Factory. My family and I often choose to go here when we do go out. This location is always busy. I highly recommend to get there early if you have big groups. We were only four people and waited 10-20 minutes. You have the option of sitting inside, outside, or whatever is first available. We chose to sit inside. Once seated, our server, Nathan, came by with waters and bread. The bread basket consisted of sourdough bread, a wheat bread, and white bread. I ordered a raspberry lemonade and it was pretty good. I definitely like the strawberry one better but it's not bad if you want to try something new. My family and I ordered the avocado egg rolls as our appetizer being that it's our favorite whenever we come. It was perfectly fried and the avocados inside were delicious and ripe. I chose to order a new dish tonight so I went for the farfalle pasta with chicken and roasted garlic. I'm a huge fan of bow tie pasta so I had to try it. Once I received it though I was a bit underwhelmed. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the chicken was okay. They also left huge chunks of garlic in the pasta so if you're not a garlic fan, ask for it without it. The pasta wasn't horrible but it definitely wasn't the best I've had there. I feel like I've had better farfalle at other restaurants. Besides the pasta, everything relate else was great.   We ordered dessert to go (red velvet cheesecake and cherry cheesecake). Red velvet is THE best! It's part cake and part cheesecake--perfect combo!  Our server Nathan was awesome and made sure we were always taken care of during dinner. It made the experience much more enjoyable. I will be coming back for sure because I just love Cheesecake Factory :)"
Bethany C.,"Henderson, NV",1,11,1,1.0,7/22/2016,"I've been sitting here for over 20 minutes waiting on my slice of cheesecake.  I came in and ordered, according to my receipt Shannon helped me.  It's pre-cut.  I understand a slight wait, but 20 minutes when there is only 1 other woman waiting and she is waiting on food to be made....  What is the hold up?!  I'm currently looking at 3 of them back behind the counter.  One is on the phone and the other is getting slices out to take to tables.  I understand serving tables first, but seriously?!  Over 20 minutes?!?! Not to mention woman just came in after me and got hers right away?!  Seriously?!  Am I invisible right here in your line of sight?!"
Gaby A.,"Pinole, CA",199,111,656,3.0,4/2/2016,The cheesecake is always great and most dishes!  Tonite service was a little slow when i finally got seated.  The bar service was excellent!   Do not get nachos!! Ordered chicken it had maybe 10 little pieces of chicken a dab of sour cream a little more guac No beans very little cheese!  Basically got chips!! Will not order again! Calamari appetizer was excellent!
Louisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",890,1080,6699,3.0,3/15/2014,"I really dig this place. It presents a lively atmosphere with huge portions of food that are reasonable for the prices you pay. Don't be alarmed by the $14 cheeseburger, it's a nice portion and higher quality ingredients than your average chain restaurant. The cheesecakes are amazing, and they even have an Atkins-friendly low carb cheesecake that's made with Splenda and a crushed nut crust! It's crazy good.  Why do I frequent this restaurant? They have an understanding of special food and diet requests. I live a low carb lifestyle and it's so easy to make substitutions here. Salad, broccoli, spinach or green beans instead of fries? No problem. No bun? They'll lettuce wrap it! My new ""thing"" is to get the chicken pasta with spinach instead of pasta. Yes, the kitchen will easily accommodate special orders. It might take a lot longer to get your food (my last visit there resulted in a wait time of nearly 55 minutes from the time I placed my order 'til the food arrived), but at least the cooks get it right.  Minus a star because of three problems: 1. The usual slow service: it shouldn't take nearly an hour for food to come out of the kitchen when the restaurant is 3/4 full 2. The always dirty and gross bathrooms: Yuck, clean up more often, please! 3. The tables: if you get stuck at a tiny one, get ready for the nosy snobs next to you to be all up in your eatin' business."
Harold C.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",4,9,13,5.0,4/27/2016,"The food and service was great! The servers name is Deann D she was one of the best polite, courteous, professional gave great suggestions. when food was delivered by food runner he checked to make sure the order was correct, the server who was very busy also came by to check to make sure the order was correct. It was nice that the food tasted as good as it looked. The taste, texture and presentation were spot on. The atmosphere was great a little noisy however that's too be expected at times.  Also spoke to manager that was on duty that evening agin polite, cretinous and happy to get our feedback.    We loved it.  will definitely come back.  All this being said I wish to say to the people who gave bad reviews shame on you!  In my opinion some of you were simply trying to get a free meal. I am glad you didn't get it until you have worked in the food service business you have no right to complain.  Just because you have had a bad day there is no reason to take it out on someone who has a very difficult job dealing with people like yourself"
Jessica M.,"Compton, CA",64,34,38,5.0,2/29/2016,Speedy service as usual Priscilla was awesome came in around lunch. Food was nice and hot. And had a great view of the dock. Never dissatisfied. Thanks cheesecake factory!
Tiffany W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,25,,5.0,6/18/2017,"I loved the Cheesecake Factory and esp our server David!! He was AWESOME!! The wait was short, the food was great (I only had calamari but it was the best I've had in a long time and I loved their mint iced-tea!).. above all the service was absolutely the best! Thank you David and thank you Cheesecake Factory! :)"
Christian S.,"Henderson, NV",46,41,49,5.0,6/13/2015,"What a classy place! The Cheesecake Factory is awesome because it can be treated as both a high class restaurant or a casual hang. It's definitely a multipurpose restaurant. The staff is beyond friendly and the vibe of the restaurant is really relaxing.  The one thing I'd be aware of is the wait. At dinner time, the wait can be pretty obnoxious so call ahead of you can. Other than that, this restaurant is top notch in my eyes."
Danielle G.,"Henderson, NV",334,630,1691,5.0,4/15/2015,"My kids love CF.  The menu is ginormous, there's bound to be something on there for everyone. I personally like the Baja chicken tacos or Thai salad, they are on the lite menu. My hubby enjoys a few things, chicken masala, the burgers or the jambalaya are his usual picks. My daughters usually get the kids marinara pasta, the chicken dumplings (an appetizer, but they eat it as a meal) or nachos, which 2-5 can share.  Of course, the cheesecake is what they really want, and it is pretty delicious if I do say, all 3577326786 calories a bite. It's not like we eat cheesecake everyday though, so it's okay. The chocolate lava cake is quite good, as well.  Service has always been consistent and friendly, however, weekend nights be prepared to wait at least 30 for a table. Prices are average for that type of restaurant, a couple cocktails, 4 meals, a cheesecake or ice cream is around $100. Minus tip.  It's s go to for us on a Friday night after the kids sports stuff.  And as the infamous quote by Marie Antoinette says, ""let them eat cake."""
Leslie C.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",1,57,86,1.0,3/21/2017,"Nice location and busy even on weekdays like Monday night. Overall service was good until my son is served with his order or pepperoni pizza with burned pepperonis. And you can tell coz the edges and the middles part of pepperonis are totally black. If you're the chef and the server/waitresses, would u still serve it?. It's not just over cooked its totally burnt... so think about that. Their utensils like knives, forks and spoon are just sitting on top of the table, who knows how dirty the tables are. Should be placed on top of a cloth or just leave it  on top of the plate and napkins... how DIRTY. When we complained abt the pizza the waiter just said do u want the manager... no apologies or like let me just get U another one. My son ended up only eating the pizza itself. We don't want to re order it since we're in a hurry... their water tastes so bad too. And the mugs needs to be replaced you can tell they have been using it for more than 2 decades lol!!! So experience for me is one star. Will never go back to this location. Ceasars palace would probably be better. Don't go to this location so disappointing.."
Aspire H.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,8,,4.0,4/27/2016,"We were seated quickly even with a long wait at lunch time. Our sever was patient even though we took turns ordering beers every time she came by  . We had the meatloaf and the veggie burger... Both perfect.   My only complaint when I come here is just they the tap water is disgusting! (Worse than any other Vegas restaurant.) no problem, it's my fault for ordering tap water . Lesson learned.  On the way out we ordered a cheese cake slice to go.  I've never tasted a fresh Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. IT WAS DELISH!"
Avery C.,"Henderson, NV",0,8,,5.0,5/17/2017,"I had a very good experience with Cheesecake Factory and didn't even dine in. I called to place an order over the phone for pick up and spoke to a lady named Chris and she was amazing! She answered questions I had about their amazing streak tacos that they have and was so nice about everything. She even allowed me to have the sauce on the side because I preferred it to be on the side. 5 stars for Cheesecake Factory and for Chris. Thank you for your wonderful customer service, I hope you see this :)"
Domnick C.,"Henderson, NV",193,38,161,5.0,2/29/2016,"Had a five star experience last night. Robert was our server and his service was on point. Our drinks were always full, and we were always being checked on.  We started with a Caesar salad and some lettuce wraps. Salad was very basic, but flavor was amazing. Perfect start. We had the portobello mushroom, garlic, ginger wraps. So amazing. Mushrooms sautéed to perfection. My boyfriend was very happy with the start of our meal.  We had the steak with medallions off this skinnylicious menu and we also had the chicken Alfredo.  The steak on our plate was amazing. Mashed potatoes with asparagus, roasted tomatoes, and steak medallions all layered on top made a perfect combo. Steak was cooked medium rare as requested. Juicy chicken and perfect al dente noodles mixed with the amazing flavor of the Alfredo sauce.  So happy. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri. It was blended all the way through with no ice in the bottom like I experience from most places. Deliciously fresh flavor with just a hint of rum.  We had a slice of caramel cheese cake to finish it all off. Dinner was amazing. Great date night. Boyfriend was happy. So I am extremely happy."
Desirae Z.,"Henderson, NV",3,5,9,5.0,6/2/2015,"Always the best service here! And legendary cheese cake   Almost always busy busy, but i've never had a problem with my food or waiting too long! Loveeeeee it here always been a favorite"
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,4.0,9/21/2013,"Who says that Cheesecake Factory has to be busy with long waits? Who says you can't find something somewhat healthy at a Cheesecake Factory? Nutrition wise, I've been trying to clean it up for the last 10+ weeks. Sometimes eating meals prepped at home can be a bit of a grind.  So, it's good to eat out every once in awhile to break up the monotony. I recently met up with the gf and a friend for lunch here. I discovered their Skinnylicious menu a couple of months ago, so I knew I'd find something clean. Just a reminder, this is a Cheesecake Factory and that means big portions.  Their Skinnylicious menu is no different.  You can get a range from salmon, turkey, lean steak, and chicken off their healthier side of the menu. But don't expect super low calories due to the portion size.  My advice, split your meal.  But for me, I'm going to be all I can be and eat all I can eat...in moderation that is.  If you do that, then expect a calorie range between 490-590.  Still...this isn't too bad. Like the rest of the Cheesecake Factories out there, there's always something for everyone.  Since I've only had something off their Skinnylicious menu at this location, I am not able to comment on the rest of their food.  I have been to other Cheesecake Factories and pretty much tried everything. I have never been disappointed.  Service was great here and ironically, we didn't have to wait too long to be seated and served.  I'll most definitely be back.   YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (417/500)"
Leo A.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,45,5,2.0,4/12/2016,Still good food but when you want to get a banana cheese cake you also get rotten bananas. I love balut but this is gross for Cheesecake Factory.
Sessa L.,"Las Vegas, NV",605,60,24,1.0,1/13/2016,"Service was POOR !!  Me & my best friend came in to eat , waiting was minimum . Got sat down with drink orders , ordered our food , asked for bread .  Our servers name was SCOTT B.  The second time around we asked for bread again , I was already done with my plate by the time he noticed that we didn't have the bread we ordered.  Then I asked him if we could get a split check then he rolled his eyes !  Poor poor customer service! Took him long enough to even give us a refill as well ."
Jaime B.,"Las Vegas, NV",109,101,402,5.0,1/12/2016,"Nice food, friendly service, low prices, nice drinks, cool atmosfere,not bad for a early dinner!!"
Cindy J.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,79,188,5.0,6/9/2016,Had dinner with my son tonight. We had great service. Our server Dante was on it all nite. We got our food fast and it was delicious.  We love The Cheesecake Factory. This location is awesome and so is the staff. Yum Yum
