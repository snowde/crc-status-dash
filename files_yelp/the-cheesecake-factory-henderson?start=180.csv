C K.,"Henderson, NV",0,1,,1.0,1/17/2017,Bar tender refused to seat is 15 minutes before the end of Happy Hour. We left for another restaurant who took care of us more professionally. Called Manager to notify him of how his regular customers were being treated and he said that he would need to verify our story with his staff. We have owned pubs in the past and would never allow this to happen.
Nicholas W.,"Las Vegas, NV",169,226,195,3.0,10/29/2014,"The Best Cheesecake on the menu is the Strawberry Lemon hands down.  Its got a bottom layer of cake that absorbs and holds the strawberry syrup.  Not too rich, and not too far from the classic cheesecake taste.  They can get too far away from cheesecake with stuff like the Oreo cheesecake, I'd rather just have Oreo ice cream at that point. This CCF is in a great location in the district at Green Valley.  It is your standard CCF with really dim lighting.  Sit outside if you can because it's a lot quitter and scenic. I tend to try to get Entrees that are more on the exotic side, it tends to pay off better than standard stuff.  The Jamaican Pepper shrimp is a celebration of flavors in your mouth.  I also like to get a post meal alcoholic shake like the flying gorilla.  Then sit around for another hour sipping it to annoy the waiter."
Mikey C.,"Henderson, NV",77,1,,1.0,6/11/2016,"Food was great, but unfortunately we experienced a rude server and had to wait to be seated at another section after asking to move. After 45 mins we were finally re-seated and had a great server named Brittany H. Spoke to the manager about the incident with the first server and he did not do anything."
Terri D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",35,18,6,5.0,9/30/2016,Awesome food and drinks. Great service. Generous portions. Even though it was a Friday night service was great she was an awesome waitress.
Dennis W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,2,1.0,4/19/2017,"I took my fiance to dinner last night for her birthday.  We arrived and checked in and were seated withing 5 minutes.  We then waited about 20 minutes for the waiter to come over who was pushing us to order.  I said that we'd first like to order some cocktails.  He took our drink order and left.  About 15 minutes after I caught him walking past and asked him what was going on.  He got all defensive and said the drinks weren't up at the bar yet.  I asked him why other tables had at least received water and bread, and then he got an attitude and came back about 5 minutes later with the drinks and bread.  Everything just kept degrading after that.  Thanks for ruining her birthday!"
Eric S.,"Henderson, NV",1,2,,1.0,4/9/2017,"The food was pretty exceptional and the service was well, but within 15 minutes of being seated a man at the table next to us began to vomit profusley for 30 seconds straight all over the place. The smell was pretty overwhelming and it made the meal pretty impossible to enjoy, yet the staff failed to apologize for the inconvenience and also did not offer to make part or all of the meal complimentary, which is the least you can do after something that disgusting happened. Kind of ruined the restaurants image for me."
Bernd F.,"Henderson, NV",2,15,,1.0,10/30/2015,"Wow, I have been to many Cheesecake factories and I usually love them. I have been  to this one a few times now and every time I leave I don't feel good ... Today again the food was very mediocre. Had chicken Marsala (Usually very good) and the meal was just terrible. The noodles tasted floury mashy ... The sauce was not done well and the quality of the chicken was just terrible. Ate half and returned it. At least the guy took it off the bill. Waiter was very friendly  Now I am thirsty, have a head ache and a stone in my stomache ... Just horrible. I won't go back to this one ... Done with it. Do not recommend!"
Scott B.,"Henderson, NV",165,19,2,4.0,6/17/2016,"I had the most amazing falafel salad. The vegetables were fresh and the dressing was fantastic. It was my first time trying something like this at Cheesecake Factory, but since I love Mediterranean food I thought I'd give it a shot. The only downer was that I was seated on the other side of the ice machine and I guess there was a leak because the area under my seat became wet with dirty cold water. I let the waitstaff know and they alerted the manager, but that didn't stop the hostess from seating another group in that same puddle. This is an isolated occurrence, however so I only docked them one star. Generally the dining experience there is exceptional."
Katie R.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,13,,5.0,9/11/2016,My husband made reservations for my birthday. Service was great and quick. Everything we tried from the appetizers all the way to the desserts were delicious. We recently moved out here from Texas so we're not familiar with the area and absolutely will be returning.
Shirley B.,"Las Vegas, NV",182,501,2931,3.0,2/27/2013,"Wow what an improvement this place has made with the service issues since the last time I was here over a year ago and previous visits before that. Dinner hour was pretty busy but I didnt get handed a beeper and wait like always. This time I was able to walk up and hostess seated us right away.    Like I said the place was pretty slammed, but there was never a lag in wait time, and servers never doubted themselves, something that I had a problem with on previous visits. This time our server and the runners did a great job with taking our orders, getting our drinks, food and desserts to our table in a timely manner. We were always checked on, our drinks filled. Staff was attentive, everyone was friendly. No one seemed stressed out.  Only minor issue I had was when it got dark outside, the ambient lighting in the restaurant was too low.  We were cracking up because I was not the only table using their cell phone light to read the menu. The SkinnyLicious menu was new to me and I'm lovin it!  A lot of the items are low carb or low cal most under 500 calories. I would so order their Kale Salad and the Flatbread with Pear, Blue Cheese and Arugula again. Flavors tasted really fresh and it is noted on the menu they hand make these items to order.  Hard to imagine that healthier choices can taste so good and be low enough that I can have a slice of the delish Kahlua Cocoa cheesecake (better than the Tiramisu!)  and not feel to guilty having it since Im still under my calorie intake for the day. Sweet I can have my cheesecake and eat it too!  On the other hand the burrito and the chicken dish that were also ordered in our party didn't live up to the prices they charge for this (13.95 and 16.95) ..it looked and tasted blah.  With a very pleasant dining experience I had tonight, I wont be hesitant now coming here for lunch or dinner. Stars for improved service, healthier choices on menu and star rating for the killer dessert!"
Audrey G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,22,11,4.0,3/30/2017,This was our first time at the cheese cake factory in Henderson Las Vegas. We were seated promptly  The   staff was courteous and very welcoming. Our waiter was attentive and very informative regarding the food on the menu. We ordered shrimp gumbo on noodles. Very tasty and a little spicy. Would highly recommend  the Cheese Cake Factory in Henderson Las Vegas
Julie B.,"Zumbrota, MN",21,4,,4.0,9/6/2016,We love eating at the Cheesecake Factory. The grand kids love their menu. The food is great and they have low carb options. The portions are large and we enjoyed the food.
Leah J.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,3,5.0,11/12/2016,"My husband and I went to the Cheesecake Factory late last night for a date night. It wasn't our first time there, but it was by far our best time. We were seated right away and was welcomed with smiles. Our server's name was Aiden and he was AWESOME. So funny and personable. Very informative. Right away he told us of the specials and the soups of the day. He gave us great recommendations and both my husband and I tried something new on the menu. He even talked us into getting his favorite cheesecake: white chocolate and raspberry!!! It was amazing. Thank you Aiden for a really nice night"
Minja R.,"Henderson, NV",17,20,8,1.0,10/25/2015,"Can't leave less than 1 star. Wow.  What can I say? Don't come here if you don't look like white bread America..  Waited for 15 minutes to grab a couple slices of cheesecake in front of the case. Saw and made eye contact with 7 employees, but we got passed by and ignored..  So... F this place, homemade is better anyway"
Avner M.,"Henderson, NV",2620,535,34,3.0,7/30/2014,"Went for a late dinner last night, there were a good amount of people but the place was not even close to being full.  Our server Cynthia was awesome however the kitchen was the slowest I have ever seen here. We were seated right away and waited a bit for her to come over, but once she did we got drinks really fast and order taken pretty fast an then waited and waited and waited. Our server had a great sense of humor an made sure our drinks stayed filled, offered more bread and really made the overall experience am enjoyable one even though it seemed like it took the kitchen forever to get our food out. Once the food came, everything was prepared just as ordered and was good.  I would definitely go back as the food is good and our server, one of the best we have had there in a long time."
Science Lady B.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,24,17,2.0,6/4/2016,"I am a customer of over 35 years and have never had any problems EVER!!!!....I ordered vegan Cobb salad and it was absolutely horrible...They sent it out with the core of the iceberg lettuce in big hunks and it was yellow ....not fresh and certainly a disappointment..What was even more disappointing was the sorry behind of a manager Chris who never apologized and instead said we always use that in our salads....my reply no you dont...I have been a serious customer for 30 something years...planning parties, luncheons and events...I am deeply disappointed and will be contacting corporate on this location.."
Jeanette F.,"Henderson, NV",95,24,26,5.0,4/4/2016,"Claudia V was my server and she gave an excellent drink recommendation when I asked. She was so sweet and noticed my birthday was the day before. She surprised us with a birthday treat and sung happy birthday! She even spelled my name correctly on the receipt wishing me a happy birthday! She definitely made me love Cheesecake Factory even more, she was excellent!!!! This was our third visit and we always leave impressed!!"
James H.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,18,5.0,2/25/2017,"Great food and a Beautiful Atmosphere. The Booths where we sat were tall and private. and the waiter showed up when you needed him. unlike some places where they are on you like a fly, this place was comfortable and just a nice place to dine. Great place to bring your wife or girlfriend. Highly recommended."
Dave W.,"Henderson, NV",419,18,,4.0,1/14/2017,"We returned with a friend from out of town. The service was great, food arrived quickly and fresh. I will go back."
April D.,"Las Vegas, NV",856,818,981,4.0,6/10/2014,"Always a good stand by when you have no idea where to eat. The food and service is always good, never been to a bad Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone, plus the cheesecakes are delicious. Bistro Shrimp, Kobe Burger, Louisiana Chicken and Pasta are some of the dishes we always seem to get. Tuxedo Chocolate, White Chocolate Macadamia, Vanilla Bean are the cheesecakes we tend to drool over."
