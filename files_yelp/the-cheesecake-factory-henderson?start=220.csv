Arelys G.,"Henderson, NV",4,10,10,4.0,6/16/2015,Service is depending on how busy they are. They are pretty attentive though. Food always tastes fresh and servers are all friendly!
Roy W.,"Henderson, NV",5,47,3,2.0,5/1/2016,"I normally LOVE the Cheesecake Factory, but dang...  Today I ordered a dish with chicken and added an order for Sausage on the side and when I came in to pick it up (To Go), I was told that they'd put it into the dish itself.  Normally, I'd not worry since my plan was to add it anyway, but when I got home, I discovered it wasn't even in the dish!   Also, I nearly left before deciding to check to ensure the cheesecake was in the bag, and I saw they'd forgotten that, too!  I wish I'd have checked for the sausage...   Can't make the trip back - no time today.  For the $ I dropped there, I should at least get what I ordered!  Called back and was put on hold.  Waited so long that I could have driven back myself to pick it up!  I come here so rarely, and when I do, I'm looking for some quality for the higher price. Super disappointed. *Update:  I actually ate the dish and decided to add a star because it was pretty tasty.  ...just not what I'd ordered..."
Dustin E.,"Henderson, NV",79,198,54,4.0,2/14/2016,Very nice! Excellent food and service. Megan was a great server and very personable. We like this place.
Kindness T.,"Boulder City, NV",35,15,10,1.0,2/14/2016,"My experience at this place was not so good. I came on a busy Saturday night. Apparently the waitress forgot that I ordered a Macaroni Burger. By the time I got the burger, everyone I came with was done eating and ready to go home. I wasn't even hungry anymore."
Monique T.,"Henderson, NV",308,19,30,5.0,1/11/2016,"Everything about this restaurant is amazing. The staffs are friendly and sweet. I came here on my birthday after watching a movie at GV. I felt really bad for coming in late since they were about to close within an hour. I know how it feels because I work in the industry myself... Anyways, our waitress was really kind and she did a great job. The food was amazing and served well. I ordered Thai Glazed Salmon and I must say it was delicious and I'm not really a salmon fan. Kudos! I'm definitely coming back and bringing more friends with me! Time to try everything on the menu. Especially the cheesecakes!!!"
Vinny C.,"Las Vegas, NV",72,4,,5.0,3/15/2016,"I'm always weary coming to a place that has disappointed me in the past but it was years ago and it is much approved since, but the service from Skyler tonight was awesome made our experience amazing!"
Biglan C.,"Upland, CA",0,18,1,4.0,8/1/2015,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE the cheesecake factory. The menu is extensive something for everyone. The salads are incredible. Tell me that you don't love the bread, served warm and soft, and I'm not much of a bread eater but I must say I LOVE the bread at the Cheesecake factory.  Audrey was an excellent server recommend the Cajun pasta which was excellent with a spicy kick. The  barbeque chicken salad was incredible which Audrey also recommended.  I hadn't visited the cheesecake factory in a year. I truly must say I missed one of my old favorite standby restaurants and will  definitely be back and highly  would recommend that you stop in and enjoy a great meal with someone or alone.  Audrey, thank you for the incredible service . you rocked it!"
Nichole J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,16,,5.0,8/1/2016,"It had been awhile since my husband and I came here to eat. We were so glad we chose to come back because we loved it! We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese for an appetizer. The Louisiana chicken pasta for an entree. And our favorite part was the Cheesecake which we ordered the Kahlua and the oreo cheesecake to go. Everything was absolutely delicious! The portions are very large! We easily could have shared just the entree and been full, but at least we took so much of the food to go. Highly recommend!"
Jamie F.,"Henderson, NV",38,24,,4.0,3/31/2016,"The building and decor are great. There's something almost grand about it. Many of the tables have wicker arm chairs which I'm not a fan of. They aren't exactly uncomfortable, but at 6'3"", 250 lbs, let's just say I prefer to be a little less restricted. Most of the food is great and the menu is extensive. If you can't find something you're in the mood for, it must not exist. My wife jokingly refers to the menu as the bible; She'll say, ""turn to the book of desserts"". It may be a joke, but it's not far off from the truth. The menu has everything from pizza and pastas, burgers and sandwiches, steak and chicken, breakfasts, brunches, even a section called ""power foods"" with things like kale and quinoa salads. Even the dessert menu takes up 2 or 3 pages. Suffice it to say, if you've got a group with diverse tastes, The Cheesecake Factory is a safe bet to please everyone."
Deirdra S.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,87,70,4.0,3/22/2014,"We come here when we want to sit outside during the Spring & Summer --- Sunday Brunch... we love the Ahí Tartar, White Chicken Chili w Brown rice... sooo Yumm...

Your constant companion, ~deirdra"
Anna A.,"Las Vegas, NV",296,90,124,3.0,7/3/2015,"Very busy! And I don't think it's worth the wait or price... but if you want an absolutely god awful amount of food this is the place for you. I got the salmon, my friend got the blt and neither of us could finish our meals! So if there is one solid thing about the cheesecake factory it's the size of helpings you get!"
Summer W.,"Henderson, NV",57,2,,3.0,5/11/2015,This place is filthy...had sticky cherry or strawberry residue on the table and they lay out your utensils on the dirty table.  The utensils are filthy too.  They have food stuck to them and water spots.  A lady that was seating guests was not in any type of uniform and they picked up the extra utensils on the table that weren't being used and put them back on their drawers.  Gross...not eating here again unless they clean up their act.  The waiter was nice and the food was ok.  That's why I gave this review 3 stars instead of 1.
Kristen G.,"Henderson, NV",9,20,,4.0,10/16/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a favorite in our family. Great selections, and you can't go wrong ending your meal in cheesecake.  I've had decent service most times I go, but there have been a few times that have been sub-par."
Jolie D.,"Saint Louis, MO",277,405,108,3.0,1/7/2015,"Came here on New Year's Day, partly because it was one of the only places open. Had a very anti-climactic meal here. We ordered crab and artichoke dip, which they were out of, so we split the cheese and artichoke dip and a Chinese chicken salad. Both were just ok. I ordered a strawberry lemonade and it was sooooooo incredibly cloyingly sweet.  Also, our server, though nice, left in the middle of our meal and the replacement server didn't come by for a solid 15 minutes. Eh. Not the best experience."
Pk H.,"Henderson, NV",3,4,3,4.0,10/15/2015,Excellent food and service every time we go!! Ambience is so good and I look forward to my next visit!
Lisa R.,"Kansas City, KS",944,908,3948,3.0,10/18/2011,"I confess...I get jittery and awkward inside when I start reviewing chains on here.  *ducks* This is simply a review for the happy hour.  Since 2 nights ago we spent over $18 wasting money at China Tango across the street on soup and bad beef, I felt it relevant to tell the yelp world that Cheesecake Factory has a decent happy hour. The bad: It is from 4-6 PM.  This was the one day in 2 years of living near CF that Eric R. and I both were home before 6.  He was on the phone with a friend from 5:15-5:45 when I finally asked ""happy hour or not?!?!?"" We got there at 5:47 and our bartender Sam was cool and patient with Eric (he gets grumpy when hungry and wanted bread and a BIG water glass.  He says CF discriminates against water drinkers because my iced tea glass can eat his water glass). With a big debate between 2 or 3 appetizers, Sam assured us they, unlike the evil elephant bar, give FULL appetizer portions for the $5 price.  We ordered 3: chicken potstickers, shrimp summer rolls, and tamale corn cakes sans sour cream.  Full portions they were.  Lots of food, multiple dishes, and my tea = $18.  Nyah Nyah, China Tango! Therefore, when hungry near CF before 6 PM, meander to the bar area and have yourself a hearty meal at the hour of our grandparents.  There are deals on drinks too."
Sica J.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,105,1084,4.0,5/7/2014,"I had a small Fresh vegetable Salad it came with asparagus, green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, roasted beets, apples, Edaname, radicchio, romaine all chopped with vinaigrette. (So good it was lite nice for a Summer day) Herb crusted filet of salmon came with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus.   It Was A Lot Of Food! I only ate half of my salad and a couple bites of my meal. Our server was really nice I can not have any dairy and my salad came out with cheese once I let him know he corrected it and had another out within 5 minutes with managements apology."
Kelleen B.,"Mundelein, IL",0,15,5,4.0,10/7/2015,"Absolutely loved the sweet corn tamale cakes, great flavored. For dinner I had the crab cakes and Caesar Salad, perfect combination. And for desert, I took home a piece of banana cream cheesecake, I definitely will be returning, and I can't wait to have the sweet corn tamale cakes again!  Unfortunately I had to deduct a star cuz the hosts up front were very rude to us the the other customers waiting also. I actually felt horrible for an older lady trying to find out how much longer she had to wait. The hostess said there are other places around here if you have a problem waiting for good food."
Trace R.,"Las Vegas, NV",781,118,154,4.0,4/2/2015,"Excellent dessert of course ;) Great food, lots of choices! Never had a bad meal but service is sometimes slow. Friendly staff."
Rockne H.,"San Francisco, CA",765,639,2595,4.0,6/4/2012,"Don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I literally find myself going to this place a lot for work meetings.  Today, a bunch of us came by to hold a manager meeting.  Instead of using a boring conference room, why not hold it at a restaurant.  Can we say expense it! LOL. For my meal, I got the regular size Miso Salmon plate for $19.95.  Start off with big serving of grilled salmon on a plateau of brown rice (or white if you prefer), surrounded by a butter sauce with pockets of sweet Miso sauce and garnished with Chinese peas.  I LOVED the Salmon.  The fish was perfectly grilled and had a wonderful light char on the skin.  The flesh was juicy and flavorful.  Great accompaniment with the Miso sauce.  I personally found that the butter sauce was waaay too rich and appreciated having the Chinese peas around to break up the monotony of  the rich butter sauce.  Other than that, the dish is on point.   The ambiance was great.  Always a vibrant atmosphere with dramatic lighting and decor.  I feel like I'm in the middle of Europe, yet not.  LOL.  This is a place you must visit once in your life. I've always had great experiences and will continue frequenting this place."
