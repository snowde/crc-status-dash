Melissa C.,"Henderson, NV",1,17,,4.0,1/23/2016,We went to eat at Cheesecake Factory on 12/31/2015... We waited about an hour before we sat down. We are arrived at about 7 and got seated about 8pm...That was the only complaint I have. I do understand it was NYE. And it was packed..
Foodie F.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",1,37,16,4.0,6/20/2015,"I had a great experience coming here. It's such a casual restaurant that also has its own elegant flair and atmosphere.  Our waitress was very kind and helpful. I don't remember her name, but she always checked on us and was very patient with us when we couldn't decide on what to eat. The food was definitely delicious. I'm usually not fond of the entrées when I come here because 1) they're supersized and when I use them as ""leftovers"", they get soggy and I can't eat them anyway, and 2) they're usually not the best tasting even at the restaurant. However, I decided to order only small plates / appetizers to satisfy myself.  I ordered the crispy crab bites, which were decadent and had a lightly battered outside. The presentation was nice. It comes with six bites in a small skillet dish and a side of sauce and a lemon. I shared the fresh basil, tomato and mozarella flatbread with my friend. She got the beet and goat cheese salad. Overall, we finished all of the food and we were still satisfied. The appetizers, in my opinion, taste 10000x better than the entrées.  Now for the good stuff...the cheesecake. After several minutes of skimming through the endless list of various cheesecakes, I finally decided to go with Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake, which, in the words of the Cheesecake Factory gods, it is ""Layers of Moist Chocolate Cake, Chewy Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake."" Ohhhhh yes... My lovely waitress put this in a to-go box for me, and it was fresh the whole time I ate it. It was super sweet (which I love) and the coconut paired perfectly with the decadently rich chocolate and toasted pecans. And to top it all off, the brownie and cheesecake-y cream in the center made this cheesecake - eating experience all the more better for me. I'm definitely coming here again, but this time, for the cheesecake only."
Terri R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",167,805,9530,4.0,9/8/2013,"You'd think that clean eating and the Cheesecake Factory would not compute, but you can find clean eats most anywhere, even here at this chain restaurant.  Yes, it's a bummer not to indulge in their red velvet cheesecake at the end of the meal, but you don't always have to eat cheesecake just because it's the name of the place.  The Skinnylicious menu has many items to choose from that can be made even cleaner.  I'm a big fan of the turkey burger, ordering it protein-style (without the bread), hold the mayo.  The side salad it comes with is good with its balsamic vinaigrette dressing, too.  The b/f and I had lunch there today and he had grilled chicken breast with brown rice and broccoli, also very clean.  I'm a fan of being able to order our meals the way we want to here with no fuss from the staff.  Major kudos and it keeps us coming back!"
Wayne B.,"Henderson, NV",110,207,,5.0,3/27/2016,Went there for Easter dinner after a short wait we were seated. Our waitress was outstanding. My wife's chicken was overcooked and dry. She took it home for lunch. She knows how to salvage things like that. I had the factory grande burrito which was huge and very good. Plenty of avocado and sour cream. She kept the ice teas coming but why three flavors? The bread is always good here. Salads were huge for two others in the party of 5. Waiter recommended the catfish and it came with veggies and was delicious.
Sarah N.,"Pacifica, CA",21,53,64,2.0,1/30/2015,"I was so looking forward to having a good meal never did I think I'd be sending my food back for a refund. Appetizers were delicious, zucchini sticks, macaroni balls, crab cakes, stuffed mushrooms and sweet corn tamale cakes satisfied my hunger. I ordered the fried cat fish...WAY to fishy not mention bland as all heck! Our server was fantastic, Mike took care of us and constantly checked in. Great service mediocre food."
Paula R.,"Henderson, NV",43,7,8,5.0,7/29/2015,"We had a wonderful lunch.  The salmon with pesto, roasted green beans and artichoke was delicious.  The service and atmosphere were great.  Definitely someplace to come back again."
Vanessa M.,"Phoenix, AZ",53,19,,4.0,4/20/2016,Good chain restaurant. This location isn't as busy as some of the others I have been to. I had the fish tacos and they were excellent. The cheese cake factory is always a good place to go to with a large group since they have so many choices on their menu. Everyone is bound to find something they will like!
Jenny D.,"Las Vegas, NV",881,393,2599,3.0,12/4/2013,"It's date night with Hunnie Bunnie and we are trying to go to her fave spot, Cheesecake Factory. First I tried Caesar's palace but it was ridiculously busy so we drove all the way out to Henderson.  Would we like patio seating?? Sure why not, there are heaters outside. It was kind of a cool evening, but the heater really helped keep us warm and the ambiance sitting outside was actually fantastic, with the music playing around the village was a nice touch!  I dont' know why I stray from my Chicken Chipotle pasta because whenever i do, i am never satisfied! I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp pasta on the Skinnylicious menu. There really isn't any sauce accompanied with this dish so I asked the server for SOME kind of sauce for this... I think she brought me out some alfredo or something. It still wasn't very good. The shrimp were quite large though but this dish just didn't do it for me.  I must just stick with my Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta!  Hunnie Bunnie ordered her Mac n Cheese though and enjoyed it very much! And the Red Sangria hit the spot!  Our server was really nice too - Hunnie Bunnie even asked me why she ALWAYS had a smile on her face like that! I told her it's cuz it's her JOB!"
Li G.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,5.0,4/9/2016,"Amazing service!!! Even thought they were busy we only  waited about 2 mins for a table!! Our server I believe was Brittany, she gave us  amazing service!! She was attentive, and made us feel welcome, she makes you feel like if your her only customer, and to my fiancé that's a important quality on a server, definitely coming back to this location even if is a hour drive from home!!! Keep up the amazing service."
David R.,"Henderson, NV",1,6,3,2.0,8/19/2015,Got the shrimp and angel hair. Shrimp was overcooked and not very fresh. The pasta was completely dry on the bottom. Not worth $18. The waitress was also kind of aggressive with her up sell attempts.
Eder P.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,3,1,1.0,2/11/2015,"I really like The Cheese Cake Factory desserts, food is not that amazing but is not bad at all. Since I am a student from the Art Institute I use to take lunch in this restaurant but today service was denied to me because I was trying to take lunch on the patio area and have my dog with me, my dog is a 7 week Schnauzer mini toy puppy...That was RIDICULOUS! A 3 pound puppy inside her cage won't hurt nobody... But that's ok, I will never visit this place again."
Harold B.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,3,4.0,8/7/2015,"Treated 3 friends and we had great service, fantastic meals and a memorable time. We each ordered appetizers and entrees then shared a huge cheesecake four ways. My 3rd visit since discovering this place and will be back."

Amy H.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/29/2016,"Just finished having an early dinner. The server was one of the most inattentive and rude waitresses I've ever had. Food was ok, wine had an insect floating in it, bread came 20 minutes after we sat down and the coffee cup was taken to the back and refilled and brought back to the table."
S. Lopez T.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,24,27,4.0,5/8/2016,"The food and service was great!  Our server was Damire (Dee) G- great great VERY attentive. Thank you all from Andrew, to the runners n D. My mother in law had the Fish and Chips n House salad, S had the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp and I had the Old Fashioned Monterrey Jack Cheese  Burger w/fries...yummy yummy!"
Heather H.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,8,6,4.0,5/30/2015,"Ahhh(: yummy. Thai chicken wraps are so good!! Our service every time is great, Chris our server was attentive and on top of our drinks while we sat outside in the heat. That's key!! Cute food runner girl to stephine was so sweet made us feel at home(:  Good ol cheese cake factory has yet to let me down."
Sarah F.,"Clovis, CA",340,9,8,1.0,12/6/2014,Normally I love their sweet potato fries but today they served me burnt crispy fries and totally skimped on the fry sauce too. The customer service which is normally pretty good was lacking today as well. Don't know if they are just having an off day or what but I am totally disappointed!
Jeffrey F.,"Henderson, NV",1087,57,44,2.0,11/30/2014,"Great customer service but avoid the steaks! Went in tonight (party of five, two kids), service was great!  They brought out the kids meals first, no problem; then came two of the entrées, mine was still not brought out.  I ordered the Hibachi Steak (medium rare), it came out about 4 minutes after the other entrées.  The quality of the steak was aweful, very veiny with fat; also under cooked.   I buy better meat at Costco all day long.  I sent the steak back the next time the manager brought it out, same problem, it was just warmer.  The manager said that it was cooked to the internal temperature specifications to qualify it to be medium rare.  The server took one look at it, and agreed with me that it was still undercooked. They offered to redo it, or make me something else, I declined; I don't want to be the guy who sends food back just for a comped meal.  I'll go back, eventually; but I'll never order a steak there again."
Amanda J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,4,1.0,9/14/2016,The food was fantastic but it gets the one star for the terrible service. Hallie B was our waitress and she was terrible. She was so rude and had the biggest chip on her shoulder. I've never had such terrible service in my life. If you go make sure you don't sit in her section or be prepared for the worst service you've ever had. I just can't get over how obnoxious and how rude she was. I've never experienced anyone who was so unhappy to have a job in my life.
Irish C.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",5,16,30,5.0,3/22/2015,Went here for a steak Diane and crusted salmon... serve brown rice or white if you don't like mash potato...good cake for dessert and to top it off great service from Jaime!!!good job Jaime!!
