Jason R.,"Henderson, NV",3,111,12,4.0,4/6/2016,"Skyler Oliver treated us perfectly. Those drinks were outstanding and the food was spot on. Unfortunately, as badly as I wanted the desert, I wanted to be able to get to my car without having to be rolled!"
Norina D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",79,13,5,5.0,2/22/2016,"I only come here on special occasions. And for dessert, never fails, we always get the Strawberry shortcake"
Dianne O.,"Alhambra, CA",226,16,157,2.0,10/14/2015,"This cheesecake factory location is always a hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is great but the service is average. Other times the food is horrible and the service is up to par. Then there are those time where neither can make up for the other. In the last two times I went here I ordered the Diane steak and most recently the Margarita pizza (spelling).  The Diane steak was super salty that I barely nibbled it. It also took about 1 hour for our food to get to our table, but the server and the manager was very apologetic. The latest time I was here was for my best friend's birthday. The pizza was okay. It was a little drier than I'm used to, but it was fresh. The wait to from order was quick, bit the server was not up to par. We also had mentioned at several occasions that it was her birthday and the server also checked for her ID when she ordered her drink. In all honesty, it was the main reason we came here so we, plus the servers, could make her feel special on her birthday by singing her happy birthday -- but alas, our server did not do it and we left very unhappy. We even left a note saying the same thing to the server on the back of the receipt. Hopefully next time it will be a better experience."
Denise R.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,24,23,5.0,11/18/2014,My Lunch is fabulous. Strawberry Lemonade and a Tuna salad. I'm set for the rest of the Day. Great service.
Jennifer P.,"Las Vegas, NV",176,282,212,3.0,10/31/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a great option since there are so many selections on their menu and there is always something for everyone. I usually have one of my faves, which is the four cheese pasta which is sooooooo yummy! It's penne pasta, with mozzarella, ricotta, romano, and parmesan cheese."
Toni W.,"Inglewood, CA",25,4,1,4.0,2/6/2016,"Fine food for the right price, good portion. Wait time is a little rough but if you have the time, it's all good! Oreo cheese cake is a plus! Thumbs up!"
Andrea R.,"Henderson, NV",39,52,21,1.0,10/20/2014,"Ugh. I hate the Cheesecake Factory. I always try to give it another chance and I don't know why. It's not to the food, it's the service. Every. Damn. Time. Worst service ever.  My husbands birthday, we didn't make a reservation be it wasn't busy so we were seated right away. Ten minutes pass before the waitress takes our DRINK order. Just taking her time, talking to the table next to us, doesn't even look our way. So we wait ten more minutes to get the drinks. (Which were delivered by someone not our waitress) Ten more minutes pass and she still hasn't been back. We got up and left.  Not exaggerating about the times either! Every time. We're never going back. Not sorry"
Steph R.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,60,23,5.0,11/19/2013,"We had a party of 13 and Marilyn did an awesome job taking care of us.  Food and service was great! We all had a great time.  Chicken and Mushroom Lettuce wraps had really fresh crisp lettuce and the chicken/mushroom had a great balance.  BBQ bacon burger was pretty bomb.  Chicken Crusted Romano was good too!  Great night tonight, glad we chose Cheesecake Factory tonight."
Shauna B.,"Henderson, NV",0,10,,4.0,9/18/2016,I'm always a fan of Cheesecake Factory but tonight I have to drop one star because the hostess that sat us was not very pleasant. She rushed to seat us did not say anything after we were seated and just left right away. She looked like she was not happy to be there.
Paul B.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,1,5.0,3/16/2016,"Always a wait but now I've befriended my favorite server and I ask to be seated in his station...the wait isn't so long anymore!  Great service, good food and always a good time!"
LP P.,"Henderson, NV",0,17,6,4.0,2/18/2016,"One of my favorite restaurant's for happy hour or any other event lol. I decided to try the salmon mashed potatoes and broccoli which was Delicious! I then finished my dinner off with the dutch apple cheesecake, smh, Amazing! The chunks of apple with the crumble mixed in is sooo good. I usually switch my cheesecakes each time but I  may be stuck on this one for a while."
Troy M.,"Henderson, NV",0,40,12,3.0,2/23/2015,"Overall the food was very good, I really like their diverse menu choices and atmosphere.  The location is nice as well. However, attention to detail in service and meals is were this Cheese Cake Factory falls short sometimes. Today experience; -mashed potatoes were cold on the plate while other items hot -hostess, server, food runner or somebody should have cleared the extra 3 settings at our table (plates, napkins, 12 pieces of silverware) prior to finishing our meals. Preferable when seated or shortly afterwards, the norm in most restaurants.  Previous experience; -foreign inedible non food items should not end up disguised in the meal ( spit out 5-6 dime sized pieces of cardboard from a Hibachi Steak dinner from a previous visit) Most of my experience with this location have been great.  Yeah, I will be back."
Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",103,111,172,2.0,8/27/2015,"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory but this is the worst one I've ever been to. My fiancé and I were both disappointed in our meals.  His was so bad he had to send it back! I always get the chicken Romano and it was just not up to par at this location.  The only reason they get 2 stars instead of one is because there wasn't a wait,  the server was nice and the cheesecake was good.  My fiancé made me promise him that he never has to go to another cheesecake factory again after this experience.  I'll probably go back without him but certainly not to this location.  Do yourself a favor and go to a different one."
Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,27,17,3.0,12/18/2014,"Service is great the server was very friendly. However the food is not up to par as other Cheesecake Factory locations that I have tried. I was disappointed in the quality of food. They get 3 stars one for the server, one for the hostess and one for the backup singers who sang happy birthday to my mom. Great personalities but that cannot justify coming back here to eat. Great food makes me want to come back and my taste buds need to be tantalized in order for me to give a 4 star and up rating."
Vegas J.,"Henderson, NV",2370,87,7132,1.0,11/13/2012,"This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway. TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY! Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice. Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service. Neither was delivered on this visit. I may or may not go there again"
Shawn J.,"Henderson, NV",450,792,202,1.0,10/24/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory sucks. Ain't no other way to say it. Let me explain why. I pull into the parking lot and am waiting on my wife to show up as she's on her way. I call and speak to ""Frank"" who tells me the wait list is only 5 minutes. I'm only 5 spaces from the front door and can see both front doors so...I'm thinking we're going to be good to go. Well 4 min later we're walking in the door and I get told the wait is now 20 minutes. Wow, that's quite a jump in only 4 minutes and there wasn't a horde of people rushing the door. Either someone can't count or someone was lying...got a hunch the counting ability is just fine.... So we get on the list, get our pager and then cool our heels outside. And outside stinks. Literally stinks. Like has anyone emptied the trash by the benches? Finally after a 25 min wait someone comes out and calls for us by name...the pager never did go off. I got the excuse that it doesn't work outside. Hmm, I guess having equipment with a range of 100 ft from the base station is asking too much.  So we finally get seated. And service...well, it was slow. You wait for bread. You wait for drinks. You wonder if the waiter went to the bar to watch the baseball game on TV. You wonder if there will ever be peace in the Middle East. And then you get to place an order. When you finally get your food well quite frankly it sucks. My soon to be 3 year old wanted chicken strips and he wanted apple juice. He picks up the juice, starts to move the straw to his mouth and is rewarded with an apple juice shower as the lid was not snapped all the way down on the cup. Nice...now I got a soggy kid. And that soggy kid ate some of the french fries but spit out the chicken. As for my wife, she ordered Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta. She ate about 5 bites before she pushed it away. And I ordered a Mexico City Chicken dish that was marginally passable, but after a couple of bites it left my mouth feeling...well it's starchy...or like it's powdery..it's just weird. 2 hours after leaving the place my wife and I still have this strange aftertaste from their food. I've never really had an aftertaste like this before. Again it's just weird.  From walking in the front door until we left took almost 2 full hours. We spent $80 and ended up leaving well over 3/4 of our food for Republic Services to send to the Apex landfill. I can write that it sucked, but quite frankly that's understating just how bad it was.  My wife said to show mercy and give 2 Stars? Not a chance. If it sucks it sucks. Call it as I experience it and be done with it. 1 Star. And when you see penquins inside the gates to Hades, you might see me darken their doors again. Until such time...oh no Boo-Boo. Ain't going back here even if you tried to drag me in.  (With apologies to my wife who had a rough day and I thought a good meal with cheesecake might brighten her day, but instead these jackasses made it even worse! I waited a while to write this one so I could cool off but needless to say I was not happy when I left)."
Christine K.,"Santa Cruz, CA",59,93,390,5.0,12/10/2014,"Got right in - a true Christmas miracle at CCF!  Adore the Hibachi Steak and my guy loves the meatloaf!  We both really like the dark wheat bread...and butter...yummy  Great service, best menu choices, and yum yum food/drinks!"

Libby T.,"Las Vegas, NV",38,3,,5.0,8/1/2016,5 stars from my picky eater son. He loves the Alfredo Chicken Pasta and I love the Skinny menu....a win for us both!
Treasure W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,6,4.0,3/25/2015,"I love salad from this place taste fresh, crispy, just like a salad is supposed to. Our servers name was ebony she was wonderful.  Nothing bad to say."
