Kaitlyn T.,"Henderson, NV",69,89,12,4.0,12/27/2014,Went here today craving a salad. I was so surprised at the excellent service and fresh food for a chain restaurant- my only complaints- 1- I got a bowl of soup while my husband got a cup- volume wise they were the same- price wise $2 difference 2-the appetizer kale salad $595 and the entree salad $995- also same size  However our waitress was excellent! She vm brought us banana slices for the baby! Thanks for awesome service!
Joe L.,"Hesperia, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/11/2016,Usually my family and I love this place but that was not the case today. Our server Scott was terrible!  Took forever to bring our drinks and no straws. Never refilled our drinks and never bothered to check on us!  Food was great as always!
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,2.0,7/24/2012,"I'm not on a quest to go to CF every weekend, but coincidentally it seems like I am. We ""happened"" to be in the neighborhood so when all else fails, cheesecake seems to work.  I have to say this visit was not inspiring.  The Caesar salad is always a favorite and my mini foodie always insists we order it, so that's an automatic. We started off with an appetizer.  We got the sweet corn tamales and I was a little disappointed, bland despite all the flavors of avocado, parsley, tomato and sour cream, it just gets a two star. I ordered the shrimp tacos and the side serving of rice was so lame!  Usually I get enough to share so the serving was disappointing. My little one ordered a pepperoni pizza and this time it was greasy and slimy. YUK. Overall, I won't be visiting this Cheesecake, I'll stick to Summerlin or the Ceasar's Palace one instead:( Oh, BTW service was good but waiter a bit robotic."
Mike C.,"Henderson, NV",150,10,3,1.0,8/12/2015,"The order came out wrong and instead of them replacing the meal the server brought the missing ingredients... WRONG!!!!! Secondly a manager never came to the table to explain or apologize; I personally asked to speak to one. His explanation was that there was a new hire working in the kitchen .... Uhhhhh, okaaaay.... Anyway, Cheesecake Factory BAD on you and thanks for not comping even the $8 cheesecake slice. For your lack of consideration I am not ever returning to this location. Just a total shame because I love CF."
Jay A.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,5,,5.0,2/2/2016,"Our server was really nice and accommodating :) , food was served fast.. Will come back soon !"
Debbie N.,"Las Vegas, NV",693,352,1545,4.0,10/25/2012,"You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes. The food is consistent and come in large portions so leftovers are expected unless you share with you table.  Of course while in Rome.... You must try their cheesecake. Personally, I am a purist and like the plain vanilla cheesecake."
Bonnie P.,"Henderson, NV",217,600,120,3.0,3/3/2013,"3.5 stars We've been to this location once and only for cheesecake.  But, in general, we really do like the food at The Cheesecake Factory and sometimes even crave some of the apps and meals here.  But there are a few things that keep us from coming more often. The good:  The cheesecake is delicious, and there are SO many options.  I want to try them all but usually can't pass up Reese's or Red Velvet and my husband LOVES the Snickers flavor.  And the portion is very large.  I had to bring some of mine home!  The service was friendly and efficient.  When we sat down our server immediately brought us bread, and we thanked him but told him we'd only be having dessert.  He brought our cheesecake quickly, kept our waters filled, and brought the bill promptly.  Don't you hate going somewhere for dessert and waiting like an hour to receive your bill? So glad that didn't happen!  The not-so-good:  This place is just expensive.  Seriously.  Sometimes I wonder - what right do they have to charge these prices?  It's a good chain but our cheesecake cost as much as a small dinner somewhere else!  We knew that going in so it wasn't a surprise but just be aware that cheesecake costs a small fortune here.   The lighting is very dark.  I have excellent vision and I was squinting to see the menu.  It almost made me too tired to eat cheesecake.  But I found it in me to keep going.  I can't STAND the seating.  The table you get can make or break your experience.  They have these HUGE cushy booths that they do give to parties of 2 - I saw it.  But of course we get that small 2 person table crammed between two different parties on that really long booth.  Ugh, I could hear entire conversations of the people on either side of me.  And that awkward moment when you have to turn sideways to get in or leave the booth and hope you're not brushing someone's plate with your rear end... I know I'm making kind of a big deal about this but it really is annoying to me.  Please, spread the tables out more. Overall this is a restaurant that we enjoy coming to sometimes. They have a really great menu selection of food, drinks and cheesecake.  But it's just a once-in-a-blue-moon thing."
Jason D.,"Studio City, CA",0,20,,5.0,8/1/2016,"Ask for Chris. This guy was outstanding, attentive and thorough with his menu knowledge. We couldn't remember the salad we had so he explained the one we thought we had before and he nailed it. Because he knew the menu by heart. Service was maintained through the whole meal. My wife (not the easiest customer in the world ;) ) made a few modifications to our salad and everything came out perfect. We will be returning to this location at GVR. Thanks Chris!"
Bob J.,"Henderson, NV",12,26,3,5.0,10/15/2014,"Awesome dinner tonight with my wife. Our server David G was incredible.  His ability to read us to meet our needs is a 5 star. I just returned from NY last night and wanted to spend an evening out with my wife.  Kudos David G and the dessert after our dinner, wow, lemon meringue was a great suggestion."
Ashley P.,"Meadow Vista, CA",3,2,1,5.0,12/26/2015,I had to give these guys a great review for their excellent service! I have celiac disease and these guys went above and beyond to make sure my food didn't get contaminated. They even served my food seperate from everyone else's and bagged my food seperately. I rarely eat out anymore and wasn't even planning to eat at Cheesecake Factory but our waitress insisted on checking with the chef and I was assured that they took allergies very seriously and had special procedures to follow. They did a great job - I didn't get sick!
Elena P.,"Las Vegas, NV",152,19,2,5.0,1/24/2016,This place has great service and the pasta de vincci was delicious!  Oh and should I mention the banana cheesecake?  That was amazing!!!
Vinny P.,"Henderson, NV",0,10,1,5.0,1/19/2016,Took a client here for lunch . Great service provided by Amy. Salads were large and fresh. We skipped dessert though its hard to do this with a bakery full of Cakes displayed to entice you. Maybe next visit.
Catleya U.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,1,,1.0,7/28/2015,If I can rate this place a zero I would.  The hostess is very rude and very unaccommodating.  I've been through so many Cheesecake Factory and it's one of my favorite restaurant but with my experience on this Branch zero star for you guys!
Bob P.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,74,39,1.0,9/6/2015,Hostess suck next time I'll wait in Caesars palace were party of 10 got it early almost half of the place inside still empty hostess said just a minute after that went to 15minutes then end up 30minutes everybody came before us are all seated
Amber R.,"Victorville, CA",5,7,4,1.0,7/26/2015,Service was terrible waitress walked around table and never offered refills I had to literally ask her 3 times to get one. Got a dirty cup dried nasty food on it and she was rude about it and said ok so do you want another one or what? Took 30 mins to get check after I asked her for it. Will not be returning food wasn't even that good. Wish I could give it no stars at all!!!!
Carrie M.,"Henderson, NV",1,7,2,2.0,7/18/2016,"While the food was great, our server was less than caring about our 29th and our relatives 6th wedding anniversary!  The last 3 years previous to this, we had a wonderful waitress every year who made sure that the cheesecake had a little candle and happy anniversary written in chocolate or something like that.  This kid just verbalized it, that's it.  Now if it was a birthday, I'm sure there would have been a big deal made.... Guess what?  Achieving each year in marriage is way more of an accomplishment than aging.  I felt slighted and I think NEXT YEAR we will start a new tradition at a different restaurant!  Just because you get a different waitress does not mean your special day shouldn't be special.  Sorry but train your ""I've only been here for 3 month"" juvenile waiters to be compassionate.  Oh and nice how if you linger a little they start ""dropping hints"" .... Just a little compassion and patience would have gotten our server our normal 30% anniversary tip.  But he only got 20%."
Kelby B.,"Henderson, NV",10,24,2,1.0,10/16/2016,"going out to eat should be a treat, but it is SOOOO noisy in this restaurant you really can't hear others at the table.  our waiter - aiden - had to be asked several times to bring the dressing, refill the beverages, bring the check, etc.  we asked for 'to go' cups for our tea, and after 2 requests, he brought full cups.  usually this would be ok, except he brought the wrong drink.  thinking we would get home and enjoy our tea; we added spenda, and surprise surprise!  not tea!  you may think not a big deal, it's just tea.  but if you are looking forward to something, and you don't have any tea at home, it's disheartening.   a call to the manager, chris, resulted in absolutely nothing.  he could have cared less and gave some lip service about how he was going to speak to aiden.  not going back.  no need to give my business to a restaurant that doesn't care when there are so many others to choose from."
James S.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,38,9,4.0,10/5/2014,We love this place. The sweet corn tamales or Chicken Belagio are our favorites. Be prepared to wait for a seat. It's that busy. Worth the wait.
Norma H.,"Odessa, TX",5,38,101,3.0,6/15/2015,"Server Jamie was great and nicely changed the dry, greasy, tasteless fish taco with the Vietnamese summer roll which was ok. Never order the fish taco. Stick with the cheesecakes. That's why it's called Cheesecake Factory. Although, my granddaughter had ordered the Chicken di pana and raved how deliciously well made it was, so I guess your experience here really depends on what it is you ordered."
Julie T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,19,2,3.0,7/10/2016,"Ordered lunch portion Herb crusted Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus , salmon and asparagus was good but the mashed potatoes were gooey and gross. Service was good our waitress was friendly."
