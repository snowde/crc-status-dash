Michaelann B.,"Las Vegas, NV",1028,65,41,1.0,3/31/2015,"Worst service ever at this location!!  If you are in a hurry, stay away!  Management should learn how to service the guests.  Food takes way too long to come out!!  Go somewhere else."
Sarah M.,"Las Vegas, NV",18,43,2,2.0,7/28/2015,"Came here for my mom's birthday and was disappointed. My order came out incorrect, and the salads were drenched in dressing. Bummer I used to love this restaurant!"
Suzy H.,"Henderson, NV",625,204,2211,4.0,5/14/2012,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory many times, probably eaten at almost all the locations in Las Vegas. Overall, I'm very much happy with my experiences here. This chain has one of those menus that can please any palate. It takes quite a while to even go through the whole menu, it's about 6-7 pages long. They have breakfasts, sandwiches, salads, appetizers, pastas, seafood, meat, burgers, and of course, their infamous cheesecakes. We actually ordered salads, appetizers, and desserts to go on our last visit. I'd have to say if you do come at peak hours, they will be a wait to be seated.  I can't name all the foods I've eaten here, there's just too many. I'd have to say most of them are good and tasty. We've tried their salads recently, and were a bit disappointed. Just lots of wilted lettuce and not enough toppings. I'm not a big fan of their cheesecake, but I think it's because I prefer the denser version. Their other desserts, the Chocolate Truffle Cake and Carrot Cake, very yummy! Actually, all their other non-cheesecake desserts are phenomenal and huge-portioned. Definitely requires sharing! There's been good service, mediocre, and exceptional service on my visits. Overall, I'd have to say it's always decently good. Usually if it's bad, I remember it. I have tried to steer clean of chains these days, but Cheesecake Factory will probably always stick out in my mind as a go-to place to please many people because of their food and enormous menu selections."
Brian B.,"Las Vegas, NV",41,1,,1.0,3/28/2016,Went to lunch today with my family and was served ANTS in my lemonade but it was OK because they said sorry after I had drank some of it.
L C.,"Henderson, NV",0,32,9,1.0,6/1/2016,Why even bother to have curbside pick up?  If it takes 20minutes for you to get your order delivered at your car! And you ordered a one slice of cake? Very displeased.  Cheesecake Factory please do better.
Ron M.,"Henderson, NV",118,24,2,2.0,8/23/2015,I love this Cheesecake Factory however they DO NOT take reservations Friday - Sunday (what other days do you need reservations) unless you want to eat before 4:00PM?  Their website claims to accept reservations. When I called  was told I was incorrect and it didn't matter what it said on the website. Disappointment in the way it was handled is an understatement.   Still love the food just needed to vent about the true lack of customer service
Bobbi Jo C.,"Henderson, NV",14,10,,2.0,9/25/2015,"I always love the Cheesecake Factory, besides their long waits they always seem to have. My dad got me a gift card for my birthday and I was excited to finally use it. The place was packed so my boyfriend and I ordered our food to go, after a busy day at work I just wanted to relax. We waited half an hour-even after people who came after us already got their food and left. When we arrived home I pulled the food out and realized they had forgotten to put my cheesecake in the bag. I called and she asked if I wanted to come in for it and I declined. She didn't offer to do anything to fix the issue besides refund the money to my gift card. Not terrible service, but not enough to keep me going back."
Martin M.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,3,4.0,9/22/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is definitely a favorite of ours.  We love the pasta there every single kind of :) They have a huge selection, even have a skinnylicious menu where you can find really good food with less calories, more greens etc- good for the clean eaters out there :) The only thing that they could work on is the service. We've been there a couple times and always had rude servers.   Over all- thumbs up to the factory!"
Destinie K.,"Henderson, NV",0,13,,1.0,6/9/2016,"I would give it no stars or negative stars if I could. The last two time that I have come to this restaurant I have had the worst service.  I figured the first time it was just one of those days where things were just crazy, we have all had them, so I let it go.  However when you have two bad experiences in less than two months it's no longer just one of those days.  We say we have a party of 7 so you would understand if things were slower, however after we ordered it took over an hour to get our food, and than it didn't even come out all together.  Some of us had to wait another ten minutes while others were ashamed to be eating but didn't want it to get cold.  But wait more....  The food was cold for many of the meals and after we all had food we did not get service again unless we waived down someone.  But don't worry we got our check and of course we were charged for a big party service.  Well I can tell you we didn't enjoy our meal the service or the lack of attention we were given!!!  We will not eat here again.  Now I know it will not hurt them if they lose a few customers however it will save me from wasting my money on bad food, horrible service and  just plain my time!!!  Eat there at your own risk but know your time and food experience will be wasted on such a bad chain restaurant."
Carly J.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,67,12,2.0,4/7/2015,Good food but crappy service!!! We waited over an hour just to get our food!! Will not be back. Not worth the wait.
Ann T.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,5,1,2.0,10/23/2015,"Service was very slow.   Waited 3 X as long as they said we would.   Seated outside where there wasn't enough light to read the menu.   The meals did not come out together. Delay on drink refills.  No one checked on us until we were done eating.  And food was ok, but not as good as expected.  My scampi was strange,  fried with a crust rather than sautéed and almost no garlic.   The angel hair was a sticky lump in the center of the plate without any sauce.   Took about 30 seconds to congeal."
Rena L.,"Henderson, NV",408,24,,5.0,3/27/2015,The food is always  good and variety to choose from. Love the Chinese  chicken  salad and lettuce  wrap.  The fresh bread with butter is a winner and the avocado  rolls are amazing.  The only negative  is long long waite. It would  be great  if they'll  open another  location
Ashley A.,"Henderson, NV",46,301,623,2.0,10/23/2013,"MEH. Exactly how I still feel about it. My mother and I were trying to think about a place to go and have lunch. She lives in the Anthem area, and we were trying to stay close by. She brought up the Cheesecake Factory. I was neither excited, or sad. Good opportunity, right? This place was busy, but it wasn't full to the brim. We didn't have to wait long for a table... maybe three minutes. I told the hostess that there were 2 (meaning two adults,) and one highchair. Some how, this converted to three adult menus, and no high chair. Two different ladies told me that they would bring me a high chair, before a third one brought me one.....after she finished her conversation, of course. Our waitress comes by and asks us for our drink order (2 waters with lemon.) No straws. We ask for straws while we continue to look at the HUGE menu.  Now, I don't know how Cheesecake Factory's black straws come, but ours came UNwrapped, and the waitress felt the desire to put them in our drinks for us. I hope she washed her hands. She leaves us, and we decide on what we want. Menus closed, she passes us.  Passes us, again. aannnndd again.  My mom finally flags her down. The waitress said that she wasn't ""aware"" of our readiness. *sigh* whatever. My mom has appetizers, the tuna tar tar, and the white bean hummus. I ask for the Spicy crispy chicken sandwich. I ask what type of cheese is put on the sandwich. ""Jack"". Do you have Provolone? We have cheddar, blah blah blah blah. We can do a shredded mozzarella on it for you.  OKAY, so is that a NO, that you don't have provolone? Gotcha.  We wait a decent amount of time for our food. Thank goodness for their bread and butter, which you now have to ASK for. My mom's tar tar was small. Personal appetizer small. In my opinion, not enough to share. Her hummus was just thrown in the bowl, with a piece of the flatbread already in there, getting soggy, most likely. My sandwich was nothing special. Honestly, I've had a better one, out of a box, frozen. and it cost me $1 from my grocery store. It comes out, on a ""toasted"" brioche bun. With a rather large piece of fried chicken, that looks like it is missing from a red and white striped bucket. Why this is called ""spicy"", I will never know. Even with the entire side of chipotle mayo that  came with it, it was pretty bland. Blah Meh food, and meeeeeeeeehhhh service? Not so much."
Kayla K.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",47,60,1,5.0,5/9/2016,"My fiancé and I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. This was our first time visiting this location and it was our favorite experience thus far. The service was excellent, the food was cooked perfectly and the portions were great. We will be back!"
Jim S.,"San Diego, CA",0,42,12,4.0,10/17/2015,Love this place food is always great. Served hot fresh and in a timely manner. Most times service is great and the wait is never too long. If you do come here ask for the tamale cakes appetizers they are absolutely drop dead delicious! Its a bit pricey but once you try it youll forget that it costed $10.95. Lol
Elizabeth B.,"Henderson, NV",6,66,334,5.0,7/28/2015,Had the best tasting salad ..every time i have ever came here to eat i have liked what i got how it was made and the service i really don't have anything bad to say i enjoy meting my friends here
Oona W.,"Henderson, NV",817,97,1491,4.0,11/21/2014,"This particular location brings back the first time I ate here: I am down with the swirl, have jungle fever, a checkerboard chick, and all other silly names people come up with to express that they are open to all types of races. I love all guys--black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, European, tall, short, skinny, heavy, muscular, etc. I have no specific type. If you're hot, you're hot! RIGHT? So, one of my friends started this interracial meetup group and at the time I was NOT interested in dating. I am happiest being a loner. She talked me into accompanying her to the Cheescake Factory with the rest of the group that signed up. Now, I have enough common sense that groups like this rarely turn out the way you want because for one thing people in their 30s just don't sign up for stuff like that.  This was a Monday evening (happy hour) and it was fairly crowded. We were waiting for the RSVP's to show up and it was starting to crowd. While waiting a few males showed up and I could tell they were NOT her type. She was looking extremely irritated and I was having a blast, watching it all go down. LOL.... This man in his late 40's showed up and without any kind of greeting she jumped up from her seat and said, ""How old are you?!"" After he reluctantly said 47, she made it clear that this group was for no one over 40. I felt bad for him as he walked away and I secretly hoped he didn't return to shoot up the restaurant. Another male approached us wearing coke bottle glasses, a striped stained polo shirt, dirty, baggy bum jeans, and velcro snapper shoes. He looked just like Robin Williams in ""ONE HOUR PHOTO."" To make matters worse, he was hoarding several overused Walmart bags full of personal property! Maybe he thought he was gonna get lucky and have a place to stay tonight?! She tried to eliminate him by asking his age. He was a smart man, and he lied. Haha.....  Out of no where, I could see her hopes rising when two extrememly tall white males entered the restaurant. The kind of lads you see posing in an Abercrombie ad. She jumped up immediately and said, ""Are you here for the meetup group?!"" They looked surprised and said no. She slumped down like she had just completely given up. Inside, I was cracking up!  The happy hour menu is extremely cheap, nearly half off so I ordered a few appetizers. I got the calamari which is lightly breaded and extremely tender and juicy. It comes with 2 different dipping sauces, but the calamari is so good it can stand on its own with a little lemon juice. I like ordering off of their SKINNYLICIOUS menu which are items that are healthy and less calorie. The Arugula Salad containing Arugula, Marcona Almonds, Golden Raisins, Parmesan, Lemon and Olive Oil.....is sooooooo light and refreshing and is a great accompaniment to something that is fried.  So I sat there, watching some people make a connection and others look like they were ready to go. I chose to sit in a nuetral seat, meaning I sat between two females so that no one assumed I wanted to pair up. I wasn't there for a love connection--just a really yummy meal. This evening turned out to be hilarious--at my friends' expense. She didn't find anyone that fit her type.  Oh well! I left with a delicious OREO COOKIE CHEESECAKE! That's the ultimate love connection!"
Stephanie M.,"Albany, NY",3,12,1,2.0,3/14/2015,"My husband and I had lunch at this location today (a Saturday afternoon).  There was a short wait of about 10-15 minutes.  We were seated in the bar area.  It took our waitress a little while to come to our table, but I hate being rushed so I didn't mind.  Our server was very nice and courteous, and definitely the highlight of the meal.   My menu pages were greasy inside, like someone had butter on their hands and then touched the menu.  Gross.  Note to hostess desk - clean your menus! For an appetizer, the fried calamari was good, but a little too greasy.  For an entree, I ordered fish tacos, tortillas were very greasy and I had to send the dish back.  The second time they forgot to hold the cream, so I had to send my dish back again.  Coming from Los Angeles, I eat fish tacos all the time but these were just very bland.  I make them better at home.  I've had these before at another location and they were great, which is why I chose to order them.  By the time I finally got my food, I was already full from the appetizer and bread, so I just took them home.  If I knew I was taking a dish to go, fish tacos would be my last choice, since tortillas are obviously going to get soggy. My husband had to send his fettucine alfredo back because the pasta was all clumped together.  It's like they overcooked it, then left it sitting without the sauce so it all stuck together.  For $19 for pasta and chicken, that's just ridiculous.  The kitchen staff needs to raise their standards for the prices they charge.     I've never had a problem at other Cheesecake Factory locations, but this one was definitely sub-par, with the exception of our waitress.  She was terrific.  Overall, an experience I wouldn't want to repeat.  I'll probably stay away from Cheesecake Factory for awhile.  Waste of money."
Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1089,1716,2662,4.0,10/24/2011,"It's a chain. I tend to avoid restaurant chains as much as I can. But there is a special little spot of love in my heart for the CF. And it has everything to do with the Buffalo Blasts, variety of cheesecakes, and Lemon Drop martinis. What, you don't know about the Buffalo Blasts?! They are perhaps one of the greatest appetizers ever devised. No, seriously. It's like a chicken wing chopped up, tossed with hot sauce and cheese, then stuffed into this crispy, fried triangle thingy. And then served with sides of an awesome hot sauce and an amazing blue cheese sauce. Tip: Order extra sides of the sauces right from the start. If you are a dipper, you're going to need extra. The Buffalo Blasts are basically some of the most awesome hot wings you will ever have. Everyone knows about the cheesecakes. So many by the slice that choosing even just two or three becomes a challenge. I have been known to take home six different slices with me. My go-to fav, though, is the White Chocolate Raspberry. And, call it sad or not, but it is some of my favorite cheesecake of anywhere ever. And I don't know what it is that they do to their Lemon Drop martinis, but I love them. I love them more than any other Lemon Drops from anywhere else. Maybe it's their lemonade. Maybe it's their sugar. I don't really care. I just know they are strong and delicious, and I need a friend to supervise me so I don't down like five of them. This location can get busy, so be prepared for a wait. The bar area is on the small side. Overall, nothing particularly noteworthy or different - it's the same as the rest of the CF locations. Service is always good."
