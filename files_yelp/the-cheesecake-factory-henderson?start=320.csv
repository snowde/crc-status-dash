Brandy B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,35,3,3.0,9/27/2013,"In all our years, neither my husband nor myself have ever eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. So when my coworker gave me a giftcard, we decided to treat ourselves. Upon entering the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how busy it was. We had to yell just to hear each other. This was on a Thursday around 6:30 pm. I would hate to see how packed it gets on a Saturday. We were seated after a short wait at a part booth/ part table. My husband took the booth side, and I sat in the uncomfortable and not-so-fat-friendly chair across from him. Halfway through the dinner service I moved to the booth with my husband because my butt was going numb. It's hilarious to me to think that a restaurant that serves food like a macaroni and cheese hamburger would use chairs that only a child or Victoria Beckham could fit into. My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the chicken penne. We were surprised how huge the servings were, and ended up taking half our food home with us. Next time we will probably just share an entrée. Overall, the food was really delicious, which says a lot considering I'm generally a pretty picky eater. We ordered three cheesecake slices to go because we couldn't decide on which one we wanted to try the most. We ordered the red velvet, white chocolate raspberry, and the Reeses peanut butter cup. The Reeses we didn't care for. The red velvet was just okay. But the white chocolate raspberry was AH-MAZING. We didn't care much for our waiter. He hardly spoke to us the entire time we were there. I believe the only time he spoke was when we were ordering, which was minimal. The rest of the time he kind of just ignored us and the rest of his tables, and stood there looking at himself in a mirror or talking to the other waiters. Overall, we will still go back, not because of the service, but because of the food."
Anthony S.,"Seaside, OR",24,20,1,2.0,8/12/2015,"I'd say 2.5 stars would be more accurate... It was my first time coming in, and it started off pretty well. But, then service seemed pretty slow. Food arrived, and my bun of my burger was so soaked and soggy that I couldn't pick it up. The friend I came to dine with ordered a ""Chinese CHICKEN salad"". And the salad came out without single piece of chicken. 10 minutes later- Their remedy- bring the chicken out in a bowl. Not make a new salad, not take the salads back and toss it in, just bring out the chicken in a bowl..... Then, we had to request a manage to come speak to us about the whole ordeal, to which he apologizes, and walks away. Doesn't offer to buy a dessert, comp the meal, or do anything to fix the situation. Will not be back. Ever."
Jennifer A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",399,1028,609,4.0,5/14/2012,"While some may balk at the idea of eating at the Cheesecake Factory while in Vegas, I have at least one good reason to do so. NO CALORIE COUNTS ON THE MENU!! That means, Vegas is one place where I can eat at the Cheesecake Factory with a clear conscience.  Plus they have a pretty decent happy hour that happened to be going on right when I got into town. There are a bunch of appetizers and cocktails for $5 and beers for $4. The fried mac & cheese balls are great and you can never go wrong with calamari. I was also impressed with the made to order guacamole which was a huge portion! We ended up buying more chips at Whole Foods to eat the leftovers back in our hotel room. There are also quite a few options on the small bites menu including some healthier (ahem, not fried) items like kale salad and ahi tuna.  Yeah it's a chain and you can get Cheesecake Factory just about anywhere, but trust me their food is that much better when you don't know how many calories are in it."
Kirk V.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,36,2,2.0,1/30/2015,The young lady at the host desk was rude and said your next then called 5 other names wth? I hope to never return.

Carl O.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,27,6,5.0,7/5/2014,Cheesecake factory is one of the best to go to.  Walk in and have a great time. The hostes is nice and friendly. The wait is never long and if its to long for you you can just wait at the bar and have a drink :P The food .. well its going to knock your socks off. really its up to you on how far they go off . Anytime you go get some cake on the way out. you will love to have it for a little late night snack at the house

Royal B.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,43,221,4.0,1/20/2014,"Haven't been here in a while and I must say they are on their A game today. I had the fried cod sandwich and the buffalo blast , as well as some freshly made avocado dip. All of which tasted very good. The atmosphere was really nice and I love the selection of music. It was a nice cool vibe once the cool air came through. It was a bit stuffy at first. Great Monday evening."
Lara L.,"San Francisco, CA",152,42,12,4.0,10/16/2013,"It's been quite some time since I've eaten a meal at a Cheesecake Factory. I was taken out to dinner here to enjoy my first ""real"" meal after being on a very strict protein-and-pretty-much-nothing-else diet for the past two months. I didn't know what to order and ended up getting spaghetti and meat sauce. I wasn't really a fan. It was too sour and there wasn't any ""oomph"" with the flavor in the sauce or meat. As for my date's dish, he got grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Definitely looked a lot more appetizing than my spaghetti. He let me try some of the salmon and mashed potatoes. Salmon was okay. Those mashed potatoes though. Oh My God. I died. My taste buds were in heaven. The butter and the texture. The underlying kick of horseradish. I could have just eaten the mashed potatoes as my dinner. He even asked if I wanted a side of mashed potatoes to go since I was so clearly enjoying myself. I should have said yes.... hah! As for dessert, I thought about getting cheesecake, but I really wanted ice cream. I hear my date say  ""oh my god"" right before I'm greeted by a freaking goblet of chocolate ice cream with whipped cream and almonds and hot fudge. I did my happy dance while enjoying that. I do wonder if those mashed potatoes would taste different if I wasn't just coming off of a really restricted diet though. But it doesn't matter - that was a dinner date I probably won't ever forget. Haha!"
Gregory R.,"Henderson, NV",3,2,,5.0,11/4/2014,"I ate here earlier tonight with a couple friends of mine and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. The line to get in was pretty long but surprisingly enough I was seated within 5 minutes of my arrival. The atmosphere was amazing, and the food itself was even better. This is my new favorite restaurant and I would greatly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good food with a great atmosphere."
Stephanie F.,"Henderson, NV",16,19,5,5.0,7/8/2015,"We came here for my daughters birthday and had the best time. Our waiter Austin was amazing , he made my daughters cheesecake personalized for her birthday and made us feel at home. The food was amazing and we will definitely return to this location."
Jeff S.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,32,77,4.0,10/16/2013,The only problem I encountered here was that I got FULL!!! Everything was so good I wanted to keep eating!!!! The waiter was great and patient. Very kid friendly!!!
Lizenda J.,"Henderson, NV",1,9,5,4.0,6/4/2014,"Omg! I love this place, amazing food, service, and friendly staff. My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit you have to get the avocado egg rolls they are the bomb ! Served with chili line sauce and chicken pot stickers but I would ask for the sauce on the side.for some reason the potstickers are swimming in the sauce  if ordered in original form.  If you decided to get a strawberry lemonade make sure to ask for water because it's overly  sweet. Entrees I got the luau salad it's amazing very healthy and he got the teriyaki chicken so good comes with your choice of brow., Or white rice . Lastly our server was very nice and attentive but seemed to be overwhelmed so we felt bad asking for anything."
Allen O.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,186,8,4.0,5/17/2015,Good place for lunch. A bit overdone because they are everywhere but consistent.  Wait tone seems to be long but I think it's worth it.
Kristyn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",138,131,43,2.0,12/25/2014,Today I got the Cheesecake Factory and I had a pulled pork sandwich it was really good and so was the cheesecake but when I ordered my salad and it came with Thousand Island dressing the Thousand Island dressing literally tasted rotten and made me so sick I love going to the Cheesecake Factory but I will not return after this experience
Tony S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,1.0,7/30/2015,Cheesecake day here is a disaster  Slow unprepared for a major event they promoted  45 minutes in line then told a 25 minute wait Only 3 employees behind counter  High expectations for a great product but not worth the wait or frustrating time to get it Never come here again when they advertise a special  Poor follow thru Not organized  Don't come down not worth the wait And when I finally did get my order way past I was quoted it was wrong
Sabrina M.,"Henderson, NV",0,41,7,2.0,12/23/2014,"The food is always good but the service sucks. The first time I came here, my family and I waited for a good 20 minutes before a server even got to our table. Someone finally noticed but we just decided to leave. Unacceptable! On another occasion, our waiter rarely checked up on me and my friend. We had to ask for a basket of bread instead of him giving it to us in the first place. He was tending to everyone else except for us and I didn't really understand why. No tip for him!"
Susie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",101,84,95,3.0,6/17/2013,"I've probably been to TCF dozens of times in my life. I most recently went this past weekend on Father's day. Now there's a saying - You've been to one, you've been to them all. Quite fitting here.  The service is the same at almost all locations - pretty good. I'm not a big fan of the huge menu. I know TCF is a successful restaurant chain and the big menu is part of their schtick but sometimes you just need a restaurant to be great at a few things rather than just okay on a long list of things. Plus, the endless variety of items, makes it impossible for me to narrow things down when I have no idea what I want in the first place ----but that's probably just me. I have enjoyed their Chicken Picatta almost every visit - it's my favorite thing on the menu and it has a lunch sized-portion as well. Their cocktail menu has many great items on it as well. Not a big fan of their standard margaritas though.... All in all, if you've been to cheesecake factory before and loved it, this location is very much on par with the rest of them. But if you have an option and it's a special occasion, I really hope that with all Las Vegas has to offer dining-wise, I hope you do your due diligence and branch out. But hey, Cheescake Factory is A-Ok to me."
Kristie W.,"Upland, CA",4,64,1,4.0,3/21/2015,"One of the best Cheesecake Factories I've been to.  Service is always just ok, but here we had very friendly, prompt service.  Food was good as it usually is.  I had a small chopped salad, hubby had lettuce wraps & daughter had a burger.  Crispy onions weren't ready so they brought the burger out with the rest of the food with an apology.  Onions were brought out shortly after.  Went back after our daughters soccer game to try out curbside delivery for dessert.  That was easy and quick too.  All in all, very happy with this visit."
Sanjay S.,"Las Vegas, NV",91,2,1,5.0,7/8/2015,"Joe is an excellent waiter that made sure our glasses were always kept full and had recommendations when we were overwhelmed by the seemingly unending menu. The cheesecakes, salmon, romano chicken, and pizza were delicious. Skip the hot fudge when ordering the Oreo cheesecake!"
