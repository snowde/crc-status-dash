T H.,"Henderson, NV",0,5,,4.0,2/28/2016,I just finished eating at The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is so extensive. I'm a vegetarian and I got the veggie burger minus cheese. It had really good flavor but it was falling apart as I was eating it. I had to use a fork to eat quite a bit of it. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were delicious!  Not too sweet. Next time I want to try one of the super antioxidant salads.
Kari D.,"Caldwell, ID",13,30,,4.0,6/28/2013,"Completely impressed with our waiter.  I asked what seasonings were in the Chicken Samosas and he knew without skipping a beat, which deserves 3 stars in itself.  I got the Samosas (on the app menu) and my husband opted for a basic burger and fries.  I had iced tea and my husband ordered a green tea which was A-MAZING.  I wished I had ordered that and I hope I remember next time.  It came with a sprig of fresh mint and was just the perfect flavor. The samosas were wonderful and came with a really yummy cilantro sauce for dipping.  I could have used some more sauce though. (Not that they were skimpy with it, just that I like a good dipping sauce LOL).  My husband liked his burger, it was nothing special but he was just in the mood for a basic burger so he was happy.  The fries were just ok. Service was quick and very competent. We'll be back when we're in the neighborhood."
Lea G.,"Las Vegas, NV",1503,455,323,3.0,6/12/2013,I very much dislike how HUGE their menu is!!!!  My chicken caesar salad was okay.  My husband enjoyed the pork appetizers but hardly ate anything else not realizing that all of it was fried.  I suppose I will only be back for their cheesecake!
Damaris G.,"Henderson, NV",0,3,,5.0,6/24/2015,"A very big Thank You to the manager, Frankie and our server Josh! As busy as it was tonight, the service and food was excellent.  My son is getting ready to deploy and our goodbye dinner was generously complimented with a dessert for him in gratitude for his service. Well done!"
Natalie R.,"Henderson, NV",1,8,2,5.0,12/8/2013,Heaven= Avocado egg rolls & THE SMORE'S CHEESECAKE!!!!! yumm go to heaven lol =)
Mark D.,"Biloxi, MS",0,43,8,4.0,4/6/2015,"Food was nice and tasty as usual.  A bit on the expensive side, but that's to be expected.  Only complaint would be a slightly longer wait time for the food to be delivered.  Other than that, no issues."
Raymond B.,"Las Vegas, NV",537,229,200,4.0,4/6/2011,"Holy Hell, is that a menu or a novel, no matter how many times I go to the cheesecake factory every time they set down the bible of all menus on my table I start feeling like I should have shown up earlier to study my choices and then I end up ordering the same thing anyways. The overall feel of this place is great, yes it is a chain and yes they all look the same but one difference with this place in comparison to other chains is that they are always spot on with the food.  The other thing about this place is that it is obviously named due to it's insane cheesecake options but i never have room for cheesecake when we are done eating here due to the amount of food you are given when you order a normal size meal.  On this specific trip the food was fast, delicious and more than enough, i think for the time being this is our location of choice if we are going to be hitting the cheesecake factory."
Amber R.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,96,56,5.0,10/9/2014,"This place rocks my world! I have been here so many times and I've always had an awesome Expierence. The food the drinks, everything is so tasty and well done. It feels like a magic trick that the menu is so big but always executed so well. I try to get something new every time I go. The venue is always clean, the lighting is perfect, I love the ambiance of it all. Perfect for a date night or any night. Dress up or dress casual it all works here. Don't even get me started on the cheesecake!! Ugh get in my belly."
Kart P.,"Henderson, NV",285,211,829,3.0,10/22/2014,"My gf and I stop by to get our usual. She loves their stuffed mushrooms and I like their Chipotle Chicken Pasta. This location always hits the spot on these two things for us. Location is always busy on weekends, expect to wait 15-30 minutes if you are there with a big party."
Linda S.,"Henderson, NV",1687,192,645,4.0,4/2/2013,"It's really hard NOT to love Cheesecake Factory. This place has been an old favorite from years ago. The food is usually consistent for the most part and the portions could feed a small  village. What fluctuates seems to be service. Tonight wasn't bad as we had a newbie who had some things to learn but very polite. Funny how I sometimes expect a certain level of service at established restaurants and forget that every server has to start somewhere. After limiting myself to one slice of their signature warm brown bread, I feasted on the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. My fave! Large shrimp in a flavorful, Jamaican jerk-like sauce alongside white rice, fruity mango salsa, black beans and sweet plantains. I was a little piggy and ate all the succulent shrimp...because I could :) The sauce was plenty if you want to mix your rice into it. The other item ordered at our table that I usually get was the Crusted Chicken Romano in a creamy white Alfredo sauce (not tomato as it shows on menu...get the white, it's better) Served with pasta. Love how thin and crispy the chicken was in the Romano cheese crust. I recommend getting the sauce on the side or separating the chicken to keep it from getting soggy. We also like the frozen mango raspberry smoothie that is just like taking a bite of fresh ripe mango. Very refreshing but will fill you up. I don't recall having a bad meal here and the great part is there's something for everyone in your group and again portion sizes are big enough to share or take home for another meal."
Jill D.,"Las Vegas, NV",706,305,959,4.0,11/24/2013,"It's a cold night, walking in didn't feel warm enough.  We got sat right away at the booth closest to the door.  I mentioned it was cold here but we were not relocated.  Two of our menus at the table were greasy. There were some crumbs on the table.  The server Chris greeted us and listed the specials.  He brought our drink orders right away.  I always get strawberry lemonade $3.95.  It very sour and sweet!  He said he was going to come right back with bread.  He came back to take our order, no bread.  After a while he brought us water along with our bread. The Thai wraps $13.50 were nicely plated and arrived just as I finished my first piece of bread.  I didn't have any, but the boys finished it all and liked it. We were given hot towels after the finger food appetizers!   +!  My pasta da Vinci $16.95 tastes good as always.  Slightly creamy, chicken, mushrooms, fresh Parmesan.  I prefer to come in during lunch to order the smaller portion.  Cheesecake Factory servings are generous. The food here is always consistent, location to location.  The service was timely. Total for 3 of us with alcohol, appetizer, and a dessert was $146.75."
Shannon H.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,27,19,5.0,1/8/2014,"I love this place!! If you're on a date, having a girls outing, a family meal or a business meeting it can all be done here!! Always clean, always a great experience. The menu is rather large so it takes a while to decide on a meal. BUT... You will not be disappointed with whatever you chose. I've enjoyed every selection so far. You definitely want to do yourself a favor and order the Red Velvet Cheesecake to round off your meal. It is my go to dessert. I normally order it togo because the portions are huge and I don't wanna be knocked out in a booth. Please do yourself a favor and get there if you haven't already!!"
Kyra S.,"Union City, CA",505,410,1205,5.0,10/8/2014,"This was my first time in an out of state (California) Cheesecake Factory.  They were very nice and considering there was a concert nearby they were fairly quick.  The waitress was very nice and moved us when we told her the air was blowing freezing temperatures at us in our seats.  The place was clean and the food was good. I like the skinny food they offer, low calorie food that tastes good."
Candi P.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,,1.0,12/1/2015,"BEWARE OF BOOGERS!  Just as we were taking our second bite of food we observed the bus person that was cleaning the booth behind us picking his nose right in the middle of the isle!  As if that wasn't bad enough he went over to the  utensil station and grabbed clean silverware and bread plates with his snotty hands and put the items on the cleaned off table. Next customer is getting an unpleasant surprise......We complained to the manager and walked out and will never return....if you can't teach your bus people some cleanliness, can you imagine what goes on in the kitchen!  I will never go back.  Could be why some of you other reviewers don't feel well after eating there.  They probably don't wash their hands after using the restroom either."
Spencer E.,"Henderson, NV",6,16,2,5.0,11/4/2014,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory. The atmosphere is always incredible. Although it is busy most often, I find that I get seated very quickly. Their employees are always extremely professional. The food is exquisite. This is, by far, my favorite restaurant. Never once have I had a bad experience here. I am very big on customer service and I must say our waiter did an outstanding job at providing us with quality service throughout the night."
Mark T.,"Ocoee, FL",11,29,12,3.0,9/25/2013,"Went late (about 10pm) so no wait. Server was prompt and professional. We ordered a couple larger salads and food came quickly. Portions were quite large and so take home was necessary. They do have the full menu available, including a healthier 'skinnilicious' menu with smaller plates, apps and salads.  First visit to this location so an average score to start, they meet expectations, no compaints"
Danny I.,"Rochester, MI",1,47,32,3.0,3/29/2015,First off I am not a fan of Cheesecake Factory. I love Grand Lux and even though they are owned by the same parent company there is a huge difference. We ended up eating here for a work dinner and I must say I was surprised.  For the very first time I actually like my food and loved the service. We ordered chicken poppers and calamari for apps. Then I had the chicken pasta with sun dried tomatoes. Someone else ordered the jambalaya and one other guy orders the Cajun chicken. To our surprise we gave the food was B+ compared to D- in the past. I'm glad we have it another shot and now we will reconsider going back. Great job!
M D.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,164,560,5.0,1/6/2014,"Large menu, great food, fantastic service.  We'll be back~"
Angel K.,"Las Vegas, NV",337,242,287,4.0,10/9/2011,"I love everything about cheese cake factory except their prices. I love their cheesecake. And although the quality of food shouldn't make it so, their prices are a bit Much. If I do come here I usually have a couple items from their small plates section and a slice of cheesecake to go. I love their Tex Mex egg rolls and their clam chowder!  They serve the clam chowder on Fridays and it's really good! I always get a bowl and eat it with the bread basket.  I've tried a few of their entrees and when I saw what I was paying for, it definitely made my meal a bit less enjoyable. Their wait staff is usually very nice and professional but nothing extraordinary.  And PS their red velvet cake cheesecake is NOT as good as everyone claims. Way over rated. Try Kaluah cream, Dutch caramel apple streussel, lemon raspberry, white chocolate raspberry truffle, or tiramisu! They all have something more than just the cream over a crust."
Devin O.,"San Diego, CA",20,55,15,5.0,1/6/2015,"Great food and desserts as always. Had thai chicken wrap and avocado egg rolls to start. For dinner my family had garlic pasta with shrimp, bang bang chicken/shrimp and chicken bellagio. All very good and huge portions, so leftovers for lunch tmw. For dessert Carmel cheese cake and tiramisu. Great meal :-)"
