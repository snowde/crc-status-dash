Priscilla H.,"Monroe, MI",9,17,34,3.0,5/3/2015,"Really great food however we were greeted by a strange waitress who started by telling us "" whatever you do, don't order lots of food""....yes the serving sizes are big but never had I been pre-warned about ordering too much food before lol, great atmosphere!!"
Natalie L.,"Henderson, NV",5,31,1,5.0,12/24/2014,I'm obsessed with this place! I always get great service and the menu is HUGE. Their cheesecake is always delicious
Jamie R.,"Los Ranchos, NM",46,106,98,4.0,9/10/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory is as one would expect if you've been to one of their other  locations. Huge menu and portions, friendly service, food typically delivered to the table quickly and as ordered, and a lot of dessert choices...of course! The addition a while back of the Skinnylicious menu is appreciated; we often choose one appetizer and one main course and split the two as our lunch.  Then a slice of cheesecake to go for breakfast the next morning. Drink prices (especially the bellini or other speciality options) are ridiculously expensive so we tend to shy away from the adult beverages. We prefer this location over Cesar's Mall because fewer tourists, less wait for a table, and certainly time saved because there's no maze to find it in the first place."
Dave A.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,21,1,5.0,3/3/2015,"Always great food, and friendly service. The chicken Marsala is the best, have yet to find any place that could beat it. The cheesecake  is always great as is their tiramisu. The sister property The Grand Lux Cafe is just as good."
Amber K.,"Henderson, NV",8,12,,5.0,4/16/2015,"Went here for lunch today.  It's always great.  Today we got avocado egg rolls, and the pizza/salad lunch.  I got a Cesar salad and an everything pizza and both were amazing.  The avocado egg rolls are my favorite.  Oh, and my margarita was fabulous too!  Everyone was super friendly.  No complaints!"
Alana F.,"Round Rock, TX",295,109,62,3.0,10/12/2012,"I hadn't been here in years like over 10 yrs probably. Went here with the family the other day and I still like this place.  We went for lunch it was pretty busy but we got sat immediately.They accommodated the whole family as far as seating including my newborn which some restaurants do not have proper seating for. As I'm looking through the menu I see a wide variety of different options they have a pretty big menu! My mother in law ordered appetizers she ordered two different artichoke dishes one was the fire roasted fresh artichoke and the other was fried artichoke I'd never tried it so id figure what the hell ill try it. Hmmm I guess I'm not a fan of artichoke I didn't like it at all yuck which sucks because there were a lot of different appetizers that sounded tasty that i would have ordered such as avocado eggrolls, chicken pop stickers, fried Mac and cheese, tex mex eggrolls,crab wontons or the crab cakes hmm I might have to come here and just order appetizers one day lol. Now for my main dish I decided to stick with what I remember ordering and liking years ago the fettuccine Alfredo I did the lunch special since pasta is filling I ordered the tropical tea to go with it. The fettuccine was ok not great just ok I remember it being better but I guess they changed the ingredients, the tea was refreshing and delicious. My hubster and mother in law were happy with their dishes my hubster got the BBQ hamburger and she got some type of salad.  It pains me to rate it 3 stars because I'm pretty sure if I had ordered something else and a different appetizer it would of been 4 stars because the service was awesome and I just chose the wrong dish."
Maria F.,"Lahaina, HI",1,4,,2.0,2/17/2015,Very unhappy. I don't get out much for meals so I was hoping for a treat. This is a Tuesday and I had chosen my menu item last Saturday. I never order a drink but decided to on a whim. I ordered a mojito. They had no mint. Ok. I could live with that. I ordered THAI lettuce wraps. They couldn't provide them either. Don't they have buyers? It was the lunch hour !!
Danielle R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1210,879,2797,2.0,12/6/2012,"Ok I'm not a rocket scientist, but if you have outside seating you better be prepared, especially on a nice day, to have people want to sit outside.  I have to agree with other reviewers it's time for corporate management to take a look at who they have managing this place. We got to the restaurant, after we talked my co-workers husband into coming here kicking and screaming b/c they had had such a horrible experience at this location in the past that he vowed never to return, and asked to be sat outside. Guess what? No outside seating was available. WHAT? #epicfail!!!  Even if you don't have someone to cover the tables outside-FIND SOMEONE. [Strike 1] It's 11:30 am during the week, someone will take the table, make it happen. Instead we got shoved into a very small booth in the corner, where there was a waiter [Strike 2]. I'm a small person, 5'3 and it was a tight squeeze for me. They have a new Skinny-licious menu which is the only reason, besides their divine brown bread, that they are on the board. Everything is under 590 calories-they don't tell you the fat grams...so they are on their way but not there yet. If you have a craving for some good food and you are in this area try Settebello Pizza, The BBQ joint by GVR, or the Italian restaurant in GVR -skip this place and skip China Grille."
Raul T.,"Burbank, CA",503,229,573,4.0,1/29/2013,"I haventnt eat here for a while..Why? because I ate there way too often and kinda got tired of it. I loved CCF and this last trip reminded me why. We went as a big group and sat at a round table.Our server was cordial and attentive and as a former CCF employee I know the whole drill they must do. She missed a couple of things here and there but who cares...I never agreed with their long introduction anyways. Our order placement was simple and it went smooth..for the most part. She forgot to take my order and had to call her back ..no biggie it happens to be best. I really liked the fact that they have a Skinny ""B"" menu (as my gay best friend calls it) and I can get some very tasty food without feeling like I will end up like Jabba the Hutt. I had the tartar and it was delicious, fresh and tasty! Small yes..but that's the price of low calories. To close my meal I ordered the margaretha flat bread and it was delicious as well.. after eating my stuff of course I started eating my friends food and had a taste of the HUGE nachos..and when I say huge I really mean it..that was a mega plate ..priced very good as well! Salads were big and tasty! In general, CCF always tastes good , from its bread to the desert. Our server was super nice and attentive.she even split the bill in 8 without a single issue. I really liked that touch. As long as there is not a long waiting time (which there usually is) I will continue to come to their spot due the ambiance, music ,service and of course food. Well done CCF"
Melissa C.,"Vacaville, CA",2,16,,1.0,12/21/2014,"I will never eat here again. The business practices of this establishment (and every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to) are not customer friendly. They don't tell you a wait time over the phone and they don't take reservations. Even if you call ahead and try to let them know you're willing to drop a couple hundred bucks on a large party (because eating here isn't cheap) they don't respond with anything other than a ""I'm sorry, we don't want to disappoint people by quoting wait times that may not be accurate."" Well, Cheesecake Factory, you've disappointed me by NOT quoting me wait times. I guess you can't please everybody and in this case I am the one not pleased. WE CALLED THREE TIMES to work with this establishment. We were told three different things. Now, I'm saying one thing. No more Cheesecake Factory ever again."
Carissa C.,"Las Vegas, NV",96,143,173,5.0,11/5/2012,"A nice date night visit to Cheesecake Factory at the District on Saturday.  Only waited 15 minutes to get seated.  On a Saturday night-not too shabby.  The waitress was pleasant and very attentive.  We ordered the crab balls and they were so good along with the bread I was already getting full. LOL  For dinner I had went all out for probably the most fattening thing and got the fettuccini with chicken and sun dried tomatoes.  My BF got his normal - orange chicken.  His seemed too sweet for me but he liked it.  We both LOVED mine.  Amazing!  I think he ate at least a third of mine. haha  We ordered the pumpkin cheesecake to go and it was fabulous of course.  Both were way more than enough.  Maybe next time we will share the fettuccini! ;) At the end of the meal we both thought ""why dont we come here for often?""  The prices are good, the ambiance is ok-maybe a little loud, but the food is fantastic!  Big fan!"
Silvana F.,"Big Bear, CA",2,44,,3.0,1/9/2014,"The waitress was great, checked on us, refilled drinks when low and offered us a bread basket. My husbands lemonade was really good. I had the black tea, which was also good. The food, well it wasn't bad, nothing special. He had the Shepherds pie and I had the Chicken and biscuits. Maybe it was just us, not use to eating rich foods. Both of us felt a bit bloated after we ate. His didn't have much flavor, mine was just okay. It's not a bad restaurant, just not for us."
Andre B.,"Las Vegas, NV",112,13,6,5.0,2/8/2015,Amazing food amazing service. Everything was cooked perfectly and our service was superior!!! Good job Cheesecake Factory 5 plus in my book
Paige H.,"Henderson, NV",0,6,,2.0,12/13/2015,The food is pretty similar whatever cheesecake you go to. Their curbside- they made me wait til there was another car outside so she only had to make one trip with the food. Come on. If I had known they would do that I would have gone in to get it. Normally I would give 3-4 stars but they lost points for making me wait an extra 10min for no reason.
Martha M.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,16,3,2.0,6/16/2014,"We went there expecting to have a good Father's Day meal..We got our drinks and we told the server we were ready and he walked away and it was literally a good 12 minutes before he came back to take our order. I guess the table next to us was angry with him so he came back with an attitude towards then we find out most of the dishes we wanted were 86'd. We waited another 35 mins for our food..no exaggeration. We were very disappointed, the server was very rude and avoided us a lot. I understand having a bad shift or having guests treat you bad but don't take it out on the guests that are actually nice to you. Definitely won't be back."
Lalaine G.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,32,60,3.0,1/13/2011,"I go here for one thing. The Shrimp Scampi. I've loved it for years. It always stays the same. It's a plate of lovely angel hair pasta, that's garlicy, lemony, basily goodness. And the shrimp is huge. Some people don't like it but I love it- it's comfort food to me. Other than the Shrimp Scampi I don't think I'd go to Cheesecake Factory. That's the reason for the three stars. It is mass chain, so nothing is really special about it."
Susan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,4.0,3/19/2015,Great happy hour with a large selection and variety to choose from. Good drink specials too.
TT F.,"Henderson, NV",370,202,253,1.0,10/19/2014,"Brunch? Raw, doughy waffle? Really? Not like it was a Tuesday night ordering a waffle. Even asked for the toppings on the side, so it would not get soggy. This is AFTER we sat for 8 minutes with no hello. Suzy finally appeared. Asked her if the large table in this section was going to hinder our experience? She soooooooo snotily replied she could move us if we wanted. Continued a very condescending attitude. This was BEFORE the waffle issue. Manager offered something else, we declined. Didn't want FREE food. We wanted lunch and cheese cake. We got neither. Will not return."
Michael S.,"Henderson, NV",0,10,,5.0,2/8/2016,"Great restaurant. Service is generally pretty good, but not always. Best service is at the bar. Yes you can eat at the bar. We have been here over a dozen times, and are very critical of restaurants. The Variety of food here is excellent and everything is very well prepared. I would recommend all of the cheese cake factories we have eaten at. The food is consistently excellent. Very popular restaurant and you may have to wait to be seated, which is why the bar is a good choice since you can often get immediate service without waiting."
Andrew W.,"Westmoreland, TN",110,22,1,4.0,11/23/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but I hate dining there. I hate restaurants that are so loud that I can't talk to the person sitting in front or next to me. Plus the tables are way to close together so it feels like I am sitting with strangers. But I know that going into the restaurant, that is why I LOVE the take out option. The food is always hot by the time that I get home so there is no lack of heat or anything like that. It's almost as if I am eating there in the restaurant with the temperature and etc. The food is always on point. Food Chicken Samosas - 5 Stars - Full of Flavor, Nice Portion size, Sauce is to die for. Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls - 3.5 Stars - The filling needs more seasoning before being wrapped in the rice paper. The sauces can only go so far in seasoning the rolls. Bread - 5 Star plus - Enjoy the 9 grain bread the most. Shrimp & Bacon Club - 5 Stars - Love the bacon, shrimp and the sauce. I don't put tomatoes on the sandwich but sub onions and the flavor is so much better.  Fries - Always seasoned wel. Sometimes a little too well. Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake - 5 Stars Peanut Butter Cheesecake - 5 Stars If if wasn't for the take out option I would never dine there. The few times that I have dined in there were no problems. Servers are friendly and helpful. Just not my kind of atmosphere."
