Channele L.,"Henderson, NV",212,253,187,5.0,6/7/2011,"Every time I visit The Cheesecake Factory, I never have a bad experience!  The service is always good, the food is ALWAYS awesome, and the general atmosphere is nice. The one bad experience I had here was ordering the filet mignon.  I am not a rare kind of person and it kept coming out pink even when I told them they could butterfly it.  It took three times but they FINALLY got it right and the manager even came out and apologized profusely.  You know, things like this happen at restaurants.  While I wasn't excited about it, I took it in stride because it was a very busy Saturday night and every other time I have been here (~dozen) has been great. What to order: Grilled salmon with spinach, spicy cashew chicken, Kobe beef burger (delish!), tuna tartare, Asian pear martini, pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal makes me cry).  Their menu is so expansive that there are a million things to try, and a million ways to customize each order. P.S. Be prepared to wait if you go on a Friday/Saturday night unless you make reservations.  It is SUPER packed!"

Sarah A.,"Santee, CA",0,12,9,5.0,3/1/2015,"My husband, daughter, and I come here all of the time. The food is always great and the service is excellent. We have never once had a bad experience. Joe was our server today. He gave great recommendations on the new menu. The parmesan crusted chicken was amazing!"
Lilly G.,"Henderson, NV",9,80,25,3.0,10/10/2014,We had dinner here a few weeks ago and for $100 I'm not impressed at all. I was expecting better food for the price range. Our service was fantastic and the restaurant was nice but the food was a let down. Definitely not on the list of places I would return to.
Christina W.,"Madison, WI",31,104,6,2.0,5/24/2013,"I have a friend who only eats pastries that are made with love-either homemade or Madison, Wisconsin's Lazy Jane's scones.  Before I made more than two cheesecakes in my life I came here and I knew I could make a better cheesecake. Yeah they have some funky flavors and if a group of people all want a different cheesecake, then this would be the place.  They are very easy recipes for much tastier cheesecakes on ze internet. The service was ok. I was not impressed by my cardboard pizza."
Jose G.,"San Ramon, CA",0,10,,1.0,7/29/2015,"At this Cheesecake Factory the service was very good, the food tasted good, unfortunately my son and I had food poisoning after our evening meal. I had the southwest Chicken Sandwich, and my son had the Macaroni and cheese burger."
Dennis J.,"Las Vegas, NV",43,103,7,5.0,10/17/2014,"Can never go wrong here. The menu is huge, I'm sure you'll find Sumtin great. The bread is awesome. I love there burgers and burritos."
Janeth L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",25,187,93,4.0,9/15/2014,"I'm never disappointed at Cheesecake Factory. This particular location was a newer one. It was super clean., Everyone was friendly, our food was great and so was our waitress/server."
Cindy W.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,312,2,3.0,8/9/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has been around forever, but this was the first time I ate there. They had so many types of cheesecake that it was difficult to choose. Also, they were humongous and yummy! The food was what I would say is your average chain-food type of food--not great and  not bad. I liked their extensive menu with so many choices and know I'll be back to try some of their other things."
Ian A.,"Henderson, NV",410,201,1499,4.0,6/22/2012,Love this place! Been coming here ever since my high school days.. Love the ambiance love the food.. service is ok.. sometimes they have the tendency to neglect your table if they get to busy.. For starters i would order the spinach and artichoke dip for drinks order their starwberry lemonade Then for the entrees I would order the Herb crusted salmon salad if your feeling healthy or the KObe Beef is rediculuosly delicious..   For dessert i usually end it with a traditional starwberry cheescake if it wont fit take it to go and save it for later for a midnight snack.. Prices are about average sometimes a bit pricey but well worth it! I highly recommend this place!
Bryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",78,357,149,5.0,7/26/2010,"Had dinner here last night with a friend and the thing I love about this chain is that it's CONSISTENTLY good. From Los Angeles to Las Vegas, I have eaten my way across state borders via Cheesecake Factories. First thing is that this place doesn't take reservations but a table for 2-4 people averages at 15 to 20 minutes of wait time. That's reasonable on a Saturday night, most restaurants are terrible with wait times. Ordered the Four Cheese Pasta with Chicken and the Red Velvet Cheescake for dessert. Two words: REALLY GOOD. The portions are huge and really you can split it between two people. I had a ton of leftovers for later. Service was fast and good, the inside of the restaurant is classy and nice, no complaints. Will be back."
Albert R.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,9,,3.0,11/9/2014,"Just ate at the Cheesecake Factory. Where the food was good again. The service was terrible. Had the bread, then the drinks came 10-15 minutes after they were just ice tea, cokes and lemonade. Then refills never came till the food arrived after asking for more. The server wasn't paying attention messed up the split checks and how it was charged. The food was delayed between people and they forgot my cheesecake. Cheesecakes were amazing. Too bad service is a big part of a restaurant so I give it 3 stars. Hope you have a better experience. I hope next time when I come back its better."
Dyanna L.,"Las Vegas, NV",445,329,1179,3.0,3/17/2013,"This review is based on one visit, not my overall opinion, because usually I'm a huge fan of this place.  My daughter  chose this as her 11th birthday dinner location. We've always enjoyed their food and of course the cheesecake. We had a party of 9 on a Friday night. I called early in the week in attempts of making a reservation but they do not take them on weekends.  That was my 1st and main disappointment. I didn't want to have a large group (half kids) waiting long. I told my party to arrive at 7, I arrived about 15 min prior. Our total wait time ended up being about 25 minutes. Not too bad on a Friday night.  We were sat at a beautiful big round table where everyone could see everyone.  We ordered multiple apps and dishes including spinach dip, calamari, tex mex egg rolls, chicken picatta, garlic noodles, sliders, steak, shrimp, and more.  Everything food wise was 4 stars easy. It did take a full on hour before we were eating though. They served us basket upon basket of bread but took forever on the real food.  Service was 3 stars. Our waitress was nice, just overworked and slow.  Cheesecake selections were red velvet, Oreo, Hershey's, and strawberry.  Seriously can I say anything wrong? Of course not.  I will return to Cheesecake Factory. Overall they are a great ""chain"" restaurant."
Mai G.,"Henderson, NV",1,58,,4.0,1/18/2015,"I've eaten here a few times the past few years. It's not really a go to place because it's a little pricey. Usually I eat here either to catch up with friends, or if guests staying over wants to try it.  My experience overall has always been good with no complaints on service.  Though their menu is vast I think the entrees seem a bit boring. There seems to be more chicken entrees than anything else. I ordered a chicken shrimp jambalaya. It was good and they were generous with shrimp. Perfect meal for people who likes spice and who's not afraid of carbs. How can you not leave this place and not order a cheesecake? Well I did that. Between the appetizers and my entree I was way too stuff to order one. It's ok. I'm sure the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake will always be there for me."
David M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,121,201,5.0,10/20/2014,"Great food, friendly staff, and great service. Great place to get together with friends and family. They also have the best cheesecake in town !! There might be a bit of a wait, as this is a favorite place to go to after shopping in the area."
Nate W.,"Long Beach, CA",12,42,19,3.0,9/2/2014,"This was our second time at Cheesecake Factory. The first time do not go so well. We were there with neighbors for brunch on a Saturday. It was a please time. The wait staff was excellent and made some good suggestions on selections for breakfast items. The Bloody Marys were good also, very spicy, just as I like them. I have an omelette with chicken chorizo. I was surpised how good it was. Now nothing beats pork, but it was good and most likely healthier for me. Will we return? Most likely yes, at least for brunch."
F G.,"Clark, NV",46,299,183,1.0,6/7/2012,Shame in you CCF! Turning away a family of 4 because we had a toddler and a baby (sleeping) in a stroller!
Mary Beth C.,"Henderson, NV",0,19,,1.0,7/3/2014,"They got two out of three orders wrong, and the service was horrible.  It took over 20 minutes to get our check.  I am done with this Cheesecake Factory."
Gar L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,28,2,3.0,12/24/2015,"We really like cheesecake factory.... sometimes. It just seems like this location is hit or miss. Sometimes we come here and it's delicious, other times not as great. Our last experience here was a not so great one.The food was really greasy for some reason and I had an upset stomach for the rest of the night.  The waitress was pretty rude, when she decided to show up to the table, until the check showed then all of the sudden she was really nice and upbeat. We assumed she did that for a tip because she did it right in the middle of us signing the check. Ugh that really bothers me.  We are always nice to our servers and we are not hard to please. I wish I could say that maybe she just had a long day but she told us that she just got there and she was taking over our table from the other waitress who's shift was ending and I have to say she was so much nicer at the end of a shift than our new waitress at the beginning of her shift. Like I said at the start of this review, we like cheesecake factory but will probably not be returning to this location."
Virginia D.,"Henderson, NV",52,40,2,2.0,12/24/2014,"Been going to the Cheesecake factory off and on for many years. I agree with other posts that the prices are too high. At the same time, the size of the servings are getting smaller. I usually order Bang Bang chicken and shrimp. The last time we went - was the worst. I don't know if its the cook or they changed the recipe. Won't be returning any time soon. Service was poor and the food disappointing. Cheesecake still amazing just very expensive with smaller serving size."
