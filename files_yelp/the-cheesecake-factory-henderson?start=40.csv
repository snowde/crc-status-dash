Terry M.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,39,1,5.0,8/24/2017,"Great second time experience there about 2 weeks ago, playing catch up here on reviews! Our friend Polly wanted to try it and it was her choice via The dice  :D We each ordered an appetizer, I got the sweet corn tamale cakes and they were AMAZING!   SO YUMMY! Dinner for me was the cajun chicken/shrimp and sausage with brown rice, it was not listed on the menu so I am thinking they removed it but they made it for me, the first time around though they did not include the sausage so I had to have them make a bit for me and the waitress said no problem at all and within 5 mins I had my sausage  :) Dessert was amazing, I got the tiramasu cheesecake, my friend got the oreo cookie cheesecake and I liked his a lot better though, mine was just like the tiramasu, didnt really seem like 2 things to me, a cheesecake and a cake but thats ok it was still good.     Cant wait to go back and try more of the menu!"
Felicia N.,"Colorado City, AZ",0,8,15,5.0,12/7/2017,"I eat here every time I'm in Vegas.  It's truly a personal favorite.  The food is fantastic!  There's something on the menu for everyone.  For me, at The Cheesecake Factory, it tastes like somebody cares.  Love this location."
Jin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",279,1042,1684,4.0,7/30/2016,"I really appreciate cheesecake factory for what it is...they've got a broad menu, and despite how broad it is, the food tastes good. I've had my fair share of items over the years, and there's always something for someone. What keeps me coming back are the BUFFALO BLASTS.  I've since tried a couple items I've never had, such as the loaded tater tots. Not the typical tater tots, and they were good! My fave part about cheesecake factory is, no matter which location, the food is consistent. It tastes the same EVERY TIME i've gone.  And who doesn't love free bread. I love the brown bread."
Linda M.,"Henderson, NV",22,477,670,3.0,8/27/2017,This is a very popular and very busy restaurant. Ordered Chicken Piccata ($12.95 from lunch menu) side salad ($4.95) and slice of chocolate cake ($8.50)for takeout. The Chicken Piccata was a very good portion for lunch. It was okay but not something I would order again for takeout because the sauce lost its consistency and flavor by the time I got it home. Some foods are just not good for takeout and I've had this many times in the restaurant and its delicious. I was not a fan of the side salad. All it was was a bunch of weeds (no lettuce or romaine) 2 small tomato wedges and 2 cucumber slices. Slice of chocolate cake ($8.50!!!!) was just okay. Excellent to go service and excellent to go packaging.
Crystal M.,"Las Vegas, NV",167,265,14,5.0,3/23/2017,"Love their enormous menu, especially the 'skinny menu'.  Excellent service!  Fantastic cheesecake, it doesn't get much better!"
Allan N.,"Henderson, NV",8,118,104,3.0,3/28/2017,"I had thought that since Cheesecake Factory was closely related to Lux Cafe (which I love) I'd go there and be very happy. I ordered the closest thing to a Southwest Salad (that I normally get at Lux Cafe).  I was disappointed.  Tons of food on the plate.  It was just a little bland, and I felt like a cow in the pasture just munching away.  It really didn't have the kick I was looking for. Prices are pretty high. Service was good though. I think I will just stick with Lux Cafe..."
Jen N.,"Henderson, NV",124,473,969,4.0,7/7/2016,"We met up with my Mother-in-Law, as it was convenient. This was a first for me, as I have never been to The Cheesecake Factory. We were here at around 11am, and I had already decided on getting breakfast. Of course, on display as you walk in are all of their amazing looking cheesecakes. I was 'this' close to just saying 'forget the breakfast, bring on the cheesecake!!!'. Our waiter was awesome, and very professional. He was not wearing a nametag, but he must be the tallest guy there. I ordered an Eggs Benedict with regular bacon, as I always do, and my husband go the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. What I loved about both of these is that the condiments were in small bowls on the plates, rather than dealing with messy ketchup bottles. The lettuce and tomato for the sandwich were off to the side, so they stayed nice and cold. Nice touch. My bacon was not super crispy, but overall the benedict was pretty good.  We had no room for a cheesecake, but saw the monstrosity that the couple next to us got. It was enormous!!! But they finished it. Ha ha. Next time I think that I will come here just for a  piece of cheesecake. The problem will be deciding which one."
Lori S.,"Berlin, Germany",7,52,10,4.0,11/9/2017,"Someone please fix those outside tables! I enjoy coming here so much and when I do I like to sit outside with my family, but those tables are as unsteady as they come. Something is wrong when the waiter and you are adding menus and napkins on the bottom to avoid the table from being woobly. No concern with the food, everything is delicious and waiters are usually friendly, just fix those tables please!"
Brandan N.,"Henderson, NV",0,3,,1.0,11/28/2017,"Recently took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday night. Horrible experience overall. First, the silverware was filthy. I mean, one spoon was literally covered in hardened food. It was disgusting. I pointed it out to a manager and she didn't even apologize. She just took the spoon and we never heard from her again. She didn't even bring us a replacement spoon!! The service was slow and they screwed up our order. It shouldn't be that hard to serve four people correctly. I know a lot of people love the Cheesecake Factory, but the management at this specific location really lacks. Pathetic service and just a general terrible experience."
Geselle R.,"Henderson, NV",907,392,4626,4.0,6/26/2016,"My most recent visit since last year was two nights ago with my line sister! She invited me to eat Cheesecake Factory because she was craving it and staring at the menu while she was studying. So we ended up going there after my shift at work. Friday night. Busy night. We pull up and everyone's waiting to get seated. A whole bunch of parties ahead of us, but there were only 2 of us so the wait was about 30 minutes. Not bad. We waited. Got seated. On a tiny tiny table. Our server was quick and attentive. His name was Sayem or Sam I think? I'm not too sure but he's indian. I think..... Anyway, good thing we shared appetizers! We got four different plates. A house salad with mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes, and balsamic vinaigrette. Fried Mac 'N Cheese balls--macaroni put into a ball, deep fried, with creamy marinara and parmesan cheese sauce. Fried calamari (self explanatory)--however it's paired with cocktail sauce (I prefer marinara). Buffalo blasts-- chicken marinated in buffalo sauce wrapped in a wonton and deep fried. However, ours was SO breaded and there was literally a tiny bit of chicken in there......  Overall, our server made the experience an awesome one! :) Ask for him!"
Jared N.,"Henderson, NV",268,546,370,3.0,8/2/2017,"This factory was in full production mode when I came in on Monday afternoon.  I mean it was really hopping.  I came in at 2:00 PM thinking I would have missed the lunch rush and beat the dinner rush.  It did work out that way.  I had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  I guess that is what happend when they offer cheesecake slices for half price.  Thats what brought me in.  Oh, and the prospect of a good lunch. I was seated after waiting a while which I didn't fully mind.  I would have been fine sitting at the bar if it got me seated sooner but I had a nice table to myself when I was seated.  My serve came over right away and brought my bread and water out pretty quickly.  For my lunch I ordered the lunch size pasta DiVinci.  Afterall, it has MUSHROOMS!  It also has grilled onions, chicken and sauce.  I asked for some fresh grated cheese to top it.  This was not a bad bowl of pasta but it could have been better.  The pasta to chicken ratio seemed off.  The mushrooms were good.  The onion tasted burnt.  And there seemed to be a taste of burnt oil too.  It wasn't terribly off putting but it was noticeable.  The dish has a lot of potential but I think the kitchen was bitten by the mass crowds and suffered for it.  Regardelss, I saved some for later and also asked to have my left over bread packaged to-go.  This was a late lunch/early dinner.  I knew I would be hungry again before bed time.  So asking for a doggie bag was my way of planning ahead.  I also wanted to save room for the cheesecake that brought me in in the first place. For dessert, I ordered a slice of tiramisu cheesecake.  That combines two of my favorite desserts into one delectable sin on a plate.  Coffee soaked lady fingers for a crust, soft and fluffy cheesecake filling, a dusting of cocoa powder, and a dollup of chocolate whipped cream made this one delicious way to end my afternoon.  I'd order that in a heartbeat (possibly my last heartbeat at the rate I'm going with these dishes).  But there are so many other options to try.  This is the Cheesecake Factory, you know.  What kind of place would it be if it didn't have too many cheesecake options?  All the more reason to come back."
BJ A.,"Henderson, NV",2,126,23,2.0,8/21/2017,"When things go wrong here, they more than likely can go VERY wrong. We order this same meal a lot, and it usually takes anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes at most to be brought to the table. Last night after waiting just about twice that amount of time, we still had not been served. And during that entire time not once did we see our server to ask her what- the-f  was going on. After watching the next table get their food delivered.. (they had ordered AFTER us).. it was just TOO much. We asked to speak with the manager, told her our gripe.. and got up and walked out (went across the street and got a pizza in 10 minutes).  Our mistake was not sitting at the bar in the first place as we usually do.. servers there are captive in a smaller space, and glaring glances are not easily evaded."
Jud B.,"St. George, UT",99,8,1,1.0,11/10/2017,"The cheesecake is wonderful but the service was incredibly slow. We waited at least 15 minutes to get drinks and bread at the beginning and then we got half of our meals after what seemed like a pretty long wait. It took another ten minutes to get two more plates delivered. The final plate, however didn't arrive at our table until after we'd all finished eating. The manager did comp the seriously late plate, and it's easy to forgive a missed order but the overall slowness of the servers leads me to leave this one star review."
Moses H.,"Las Vegas, NV",205,352,366,4.0,2/4/2017,"I had the Louisiana pasta. Not a bad pasta dish but not great either. Chicken was crispy but the sauce on top was a little mediocre. The massive menu here makes it a challenge to find the dishes that they do well here. The wife had the chicken maderia, which she enjoyed the balsamic tasting sauce on top of the potatoes and chicken. The spicy spinach dip was tasty with nice crisp chips on the side was definitely a highlight. And of course washed it all down with a nice hunk of peanut butter cup cheese cake at the end, which was excellent. Service and ambience was great! I just gotta find a more suitable entree there for my palette."
Tiffany W.,"Inglewood, CA",125,89,191,4.0,7/28/2017,Today I had the Mexican Tortilla Salad and it was pretty good. Big portion but good. Ample parking. It was about a 15minute wait. Good service.
Karole R.,"Henderson, NV",486,148,1836,4.0,5/2/2017,Still love the cheesecake here though the prices seem to get higher as the portions get smaller service was excellent the wait staff could've done more suggestive selling and there was a lack of excitement it felt very commercial. Food was good and was timely drinks were never empty and left with a belly full
Marchell B.,"Long Beach, CA",3,6,17,1.0,4/22/2017,"The service has been awful tonight. Not only did it take an extremely long time to get our food in a non crowded restaurant they forgot my food and a friend's food. We had to tell the waiter that our food was missing and you cancel my order. Then the waiter informed the manager about the issues with our food and the manager was not professional nor did he apologize. Literally he walked up to our table says ""hoe does the food taste"" we reply good (because it did taste good, the appetizers we had gotten) then he walks away with not one other word. I will definitely be making an official complaint to their corporate. I can forgive the late food but for the manager to not even acknowledge the issues after the Waiter brought it to his attention he also did not even apologize for the issues.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! The manager on April 22, 2017 evening shift needs to be trained in how to provide good customer service."
Leah B.,"Las Vegas, NV",34,625,82,5.0,6/12/2017,Food and service here were great. Sat up in the bar. No complaints. Food came out fast. A+
Michael B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,5.0,10/15/2017,"Service by John was outstanding, top notch server. Food was cooked as ordered with a delay, but it was Sunday morning breakfast after all. Will be returning many times with service like that."
Brie G.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,4,2.0,12/16/2017,"TERRIBLE SERVICE: Where do I even start. Firstly, they attempted to seat us to a small table where if we were to have accepted we would have been sitting elbow to elbow to the person sharing the booth seat. No problem, and a quick fix. They quickly sat us at a booth, which was nice and we appreciated that accommodation. 5 minutes later our server D shows up to take our drink order, she grabs our drinks quickly, sets them down, and rushes away. We had in mind an appetizer we wanted to order and that would have been a great time to order however she didn't stop at the table for even a second for us to do that. Another 5-7 minutes later she shows up once more and asks us if we are set to order. As we order she seems rushed, and quickly leaves our table once again. After our appetizer gets to the table brought by I assume a runner she never once came by to ask if we need anything. Here and there she would grab our drinks to refill without asking and wouldn't say a word, never spending even a second at the table to give us a chance to ask for anything. Once our food arrived the runner put our food down and ran off before asking if we needed anything else before I could process that I had blue cheese, and not ranch on my plate. I was expecting our server to show up and ask us how everything was, or to ask if we need anything else but no nothing. Since we were seated near a server station my husband waved down another server who was standing around conversing with another server. She fingered hold on to my husband and finished her conversation. She finally came over and asked my husband if he needed something and when he said we needed a side of ranch, and buffalo sauce she ran off to get it. Another server (still not ours) brought the ranch, and said she'd be back with the buffalo sauce. 2 minutes later, the buffalo sauce finally arrived. After our meals were almost done another server saw that our drinks were low, and offered to refill them. Once completely finished, our server finally arrived and asked about dessert. The check arrived with our to go desserts because we couldn't stand to be in there any longer. Long story short, the service was terrible. My two stars are only for the food, that was better than the service."
