Debbie H.,"Gretna, NE",90,415,17,5.0,5/25/2012,"Met the girls here for lunch - it was super convenient to get to and I love the new skinnylicious menu.  Lots of yummy options and, while I didnt have it, it even includes a low carb cheesecake.  Seared tuna salad for one of us, Greek salad for one, and grilled turkey burger with side salad for me.  All very good."
Jerry T.,"Lake Arrowhead, CA",2,3,2,5.0,10/27/2015,"Food was fantastic, but our waiter Skyler is the best ever. What an outstanding personality for someone if his age. If I was still working I would hire him immediately. This young man is going far. I hope Cheese Factory recognizes his talents and promotes him ASAP"
Molly T.,"Los Angeles, CA",441,530,156,4.0,6/13/2012,"Two things I learned:  1. The Cheesecake Factory has prep cooks from 4am-12am every day. Everything they make is made fresh every day.  2. The Cheesecake Factory is actually somewhat tasty.  We had a really great server and the food was good and came out fast. Its portions are oversized, absolutely. Like most chains, it is advised to share.  The cheesecake really is fabulous but I'm not chomping at the bit to return here as it is kind of pricy for  chain food."
Vonnie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,328,519,3.0,7/30/2012,Cheesecake Factory is always a great go to place when you have several mouths to feed and you don't want to drive around to find a place to eat. This CF is well outside of the strip area of Las Vegas and is frequented by the locals from the Green Valley area.  We came here early on a Sat. afternoon (4-ish) and the place wasn't crowded at all. Service was a tad bit slow at first but with a little prodding (and departures by other tables) our waitress picked up the pace. For a party of 8 we were all pleased with our staple dishes ranging from Mexican to Asian to American fare.
Joel L.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,3,,4.0,8/28/2014,"I was worrying about the time response of the waitress because the restaurant was almost full but she was very nice and responded promptly to our request.. This isn't a fast food restaurant so keep in mind you'll spend $$ + tips, the menu is really big so ask what's the specialty. The food is delicious, hot and different from any other place. Remember to save space in your stomach for cheesecake time!"
Bradley T.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,1,,2.0,11/13/2012,"I visited this Cheese Cake Factory for a late lunch date.  My recommendation was a mistake. First we arrived at 2:30 PM and submitted our name to be told it would a 15 to 20 minute wait. I found that to be unacceptable considering the time of the day and considering that the restaruant was far from busy. We were finally setted and given a menu.  The waitress did arrive at our table in a timely manner.  We both ordered an Ice Tea as a beverage.  She returned timely.  We told her that we needed a few minutes to decide on lunch and she left, returning timely. My date ordered a Crab Cake appetizer, a Chicken Oriental Salad. I an old fashion Burger and Salad combo. My date told the waitress that the Crab Cakes were good, but the chicken in the salad was over cooked and very dry.  My burger was at best etable and the salad small.  So far, just lunch, not so good!    Then we were ask if we wanted dessert and my date ordered the Pumkin Spice Cheese Cake. It was delivered and as she ate the Cheese cake, I noticed a hair in it. I called the waitress over and she offered and it was accepted to get a new piece delivered. It was placed in a take home container.  It was never offered to take the item off the bill, which I felt should ahve been the case. I mean a hair in it? Issue number two.  We were never ask if we wanted a refill on our Ice Tea. although it was obvious that our glasses had been near empty throught out entree's.   So in a nutshell, we had a less than enjoyable dining experience and the tab? In my opinion, was to expensive. For a simple appetizer, oriental chicken salad. a burger and small-small salad, and two ice teas, came to $52.64.  then add a tradional tip of $12.00, it cost me $63.00 for a lunch!  I doubt that I will recommend or entertain another date at this place!"
K K.,"Henderson, NV",3,25,,2.0,2/19/2013,"Service was decent. Food was meh, You're pretty much paying for the atmosphere.  Everything can and should be better but, its not.  This is a rather pretentious place."
Nicole A.,"Henderson, NV",0,5,,1.0,11/29/2015,"Tonight my brother in law went to get our family dinner from here, and I must say it was a big disappointment.. Normally we eat there and have really good service, but tonight we decided to order and take out. To start off the charges us for the bread when I thought it came free with the meals but I'm not sure about that one. Also we ordered tacos and the side we decided on was rice and corn NO BEANS, and they gave us rice and beans. On that note it was also cold.. And then my dad ordered fish and chips and instead of coleslaw he asked for double fries and they didn't give him that, they gave him coleslaw... And the last thing was my mom ordered steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu and they're was literally barely anything on that plate. This entire experience was just so upsetting and I hope you tell your location staff to next listen to what we ask for next time. Thank you for your time."
Heidi M.,"Henderson, NV",9,165,78,4.0,7/20/2014,"Excellent! Be sure to sit in the bar in try the street tacos. Or outside in the later evening timeframe when it's not too hot,_"
David S.,"Las Vegas, NV",570,1050,274,2.0,4/8/2012,"I came here with two other friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. One of us does not do well with fish or anything too exotic, so the Cheesecake Factory was a safe bet.  The portions here are large, bordering on insane. Some items are average in price to quantity ratio such as the potstickers, but then there are ridiculously big selections such as their chicken nachos. We started with these two appetizers and a few drinks. Looking through their menu is daunting. Flipping through page after page, it all becomes a blur. It took us twenty minutes to settle on our meals.  Many of these plates could easily feed two and my friends did not want to split an entree with me. It definitely made me appreciate their Skinnylicious offerings. All of the items on this separate menu possessed less than 590 calories. It is not like other places that only have a few selections to choose from. No, this was a full blown menu with burgers, salads, pizzas, fish, and more. Looking at this was a task on its own. I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I am a huge fan of beets. The patty is not like a Boca Burger. It is not condense or have the texture of meat. It is made up of farro, a wheat grain, and the deep burgundy vegetable. After a few bites, I gave up on trying to eat it as a burger and just ate the contents between the bun. It just felt odd to eat all these carbs together. The farro was cooked well and I enjoyed its flavor. It would make for a good salad.  Now comes the real reason to come to the Cheesecake Factory, it is all about their... brownies. I kid, the only reason why I still come back to this establishment is for their cheesecake. The Red Velvet is my go to dessert. The white chocolate curls on the outside makes this treat even more decadent. Too bad, cheesecake does not make for a well balanced meal."
Sarah M.,"Henderson, NV",2,11,1,5.0,8/23/2014,I've always had great service here and the food has been excellent. Favorite thing to order is the tomato basil or the shepherds pie. The red velvet cheesecake is to die for.
Barbara F.,"Carson City, NV",24,47,3,4.0,3/27/2014,"My first visit ever and I was pleased by the service, décor and the huge menu. Although I don't eat cheesecake it was easy to see why so many flock to this establishment. My son loved it and so did his friends. I hear Reno will have a Cheesecake Factory coming soon! Wahoooooooooo!"
Andy B.,"Windermere, FL",63,278,103,4.0,10/14/2012,"We have eaten at this chain countless times - probably over 50, maybe more - the prices are very very reasonable (on entrees) and the portion sizes are huge - you really should share (especially if you want to make it to dessert). Their menu is as big as their portions - it is a ring bound folio.   We have tried a lot of the dishes and it is probably easier to list those that haven't quite lived up to expectations (as that is a shorter list): The meatloaf sandwich Their brunch menu (just order from the regular menu) Our favorite dishes are the miso salmon and the bang-bang chicken & shrimp.  My sister in law ate their calamari about 20 times on a recent vacation. Their passion fruit iced tea is great and the complimentary bread basket is excellent. Our favorite cheesecakes are the dulce de leche & pumpkin (only available for about 4 weeks a year).  The strawberry shortcake is very good if you don't feel like cheesecake. This location is great of you are staying on the strip & have a car (and don't want to wait a long time at the location at the back of Caesars Mall in Caesars Palace)."
Daniel V.,"Sparks, NV",2,17,,4.0,12/20/2011,"This may be the non-fast-food chain restaurant I have been to the most across the country and in Las Vegas in the last few years...and this location is by far my favorite. Just off the freeway in the Green Valley area of Las Vegas, lots to do in the area before or after eating, and no crazy tourists (like the one in Forum Shops) or  nouveau riche with entitlement issues (like the Summerlin location). Do I exaggerate? Yes. Is it completely untrue? No. Admit it, you've seen it on occasion if you've been to either of those other LV locations. Why return so often to this CF? Awesome food and service and rarely an unruly customer. We've visited for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner over the years and I think maybe twice there was a problem with the food, which was rectified quickly. We've been there as a party of two, with out of town friends, with a group, and each time have gone away happy.  So, consistency in quality (food and service) is one point in their favor. Another is the wide variety of menu items. Sure, there are several pages of variations on chicken, but there are also so many different meat preparations, salads, sandwiches, Asian offerings and tasty appetizers to fit the bill. A bread basket to start, and two pages of cheesecake variations to finish (key lime is #1!)...mmmm... I am a coffee snob, not so much (though a little) a chain snob, but even this is hard to find fault with at CF. Yes, it's a chain, but there are unique menu items (see other reviews, which I agree with) that other places don't have and can't reproduce in such surroundings. All that makes it kind of ""unique"" among chains and I've squared the circle as best I can here.  The reason for four rather than five stars is my own little entitled whine...bring back the Turkey Reuben, I say! Every time I ordered it, the waiter/waitress said ""great choice,"" so why did it vanish from the menu in 2009?"
Dawn C.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,331,6,4.0,3/11/2012,Brought my little boy here for lunch the other day since we were at a park on that side of town. It was lunch time and the place was packed but even so the wait for a table was only a couple minutes. Our server was very nice. She brought me my most favorite tea super fast..its a passion fruit tea that is just amazing. She even bought my little guy an apple juice in a sippy cup. I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp and he had a grilled cheese and fries. Both came out very fast..which is good since they have some really good bread there that can fill you up. She boxed everything up and even put my tea in a to go cup. Another amazing visit to the factory!
Michelle P.,"Henderson, NV",164,104,50,1.0,3/13/2014,Ok so I LOVE Cheesecake Factory but I was so unhappy with my visit today I could not post about it. The food was good as always and service was good for being so busy but when the girl asked to bag up my food I was like ok.... I wish I would have done it myself... I gave her a plate with 1.5 sandwich and full fries and ketchup and ranch... I look at my to go food once I got back to work and all I had was 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 fries... I had weightloss surgery so I cant eat a lot at 1 time but if im gonna pay full price for meals I want my WHOLE meal I didn't eat to go.... SUPER unhappy with CCF today!! Shame on the waitress!!
Greg K.,"Henderson, NV",493,520,688,4.0,8/18/2010,"All the reviews on the food are pretty accurate. You know it, it is a chain and has all the normal stuff that taste, well, like most other places. Something exciting about this place is that it is a really cool place to get desserts for your friends and entertainment. Not just cheesecakes. I haven't bought a cheesecake yet.  I am talking about LInda's Fudge Cake, the Tiramisu, the Black Out Cake. These are huge cakes, and very, very good. You just need a full day to let them thaw out as they keep them in the freezer. Very good, very decadent, and very fun to share.  Try it."
Thomas H.,"Colorado City, TX",45,99,11,2.0,6/14/2015,You know for a place that charges as much as they do you would figure they could at least come out with some really good entrees. I mean I'll give it to them on the chicken pot stickers fairly tasty item but it wasn't any better than day a ghengis grill where it costs half as much right? My gf got the skinny Asian chicken which she wasn't very impressed by at all and for something on a low cal memo the peon was ridiculous but I digress. My option was the Baja chicken tacos with rice and beans again I wouldn't mind the price of the meal was worth it but the tacos and rice had no flavor and the only hot sauce the carried was Tabasco which is awful on a taco. So needles to say we were both looking for a dessert to really pull the meal together and is the cheese cake factory so hell why not we ordered an oreo cheese cake and I was really excited for it to come only to be let down I wanted to give this place one star but our server was great and very attentive so I the an extra one in for him. Ladies and gentlemen there ate plenty of places in Vegas to spend your money on great food don't waste it here.
Lauren J.,"Henderson, NV",0,1,,4.0,10/9/2014,"For my mom's birthday, we sat outside. We ordered meatloaf, some salads and pasta. Everything was very good. The service was slow even though they were not busy. After we we done eating, we ordered a cheesecake. The cheesecake was delicious."
Kara W.,"Henderson, NV",7,12,,3.0,8/17/2013,"Love your cheesecake and your variety of fun drinks and dishes but WHY, WHY, WHY did you have to take Caramel Chicken off the menu????? It was the best entree and now I'm left to try and re-create it (fail horribly) at home! Tearz. If you love a variety of food with spot on flavor or if you just have an insatiable sweet tooth go to Cheesecake Factory. Personally, I love their thai chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer.  Sadly, I will rarely go here except for cheesecake because of the recent caramel chicken loss. Let me tell you that was a big loss!!"
