Tyler F.,"San Clemente, CA",0,15,,4.0,9/20/2014,Been to this location a few time.  Service has always been great. Food is just right and the red velvet cheese cake is irresistible. Will always return to this location when visiting las Vegas.
Anthony R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,6,2,3.0,9/6/2014,"I love the fried mac and cheese, and the mac and cheeseburger!  Booth 94 in the rotunda room has a beautiful view of the city. Its the only inside table with a view. The outside is pretty the lights twinkle like stars lok. The cheesecake while good is frozen and if you buy the cheesecake factory brand frozen ones at Walmart its the exact same cakes they serve in the restaurant."
Ashley L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3555,323,749,2.0,8/9/2013,"Food is mediocre at best but what I can't wrap my head around is this; why do the curb side workers that answer the phones don't know what's in the menu items (for allergies purposes) and have such thick accents you can't understand them, then you hear them yelling in Spanish in the background. Crazy"
Christy D.,"Las Vegas, NV",155,95,19,4.0,7/2/2012,"Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do.  We ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for.  My husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had.  Now for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake."
Earl C.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,54,,3.0,1/14/2012,"I don't remember the last time I visited a cheese cake factory but this visit made me realize there are so many other better restaurants out there for the price.  We ordered the flat bread with pears, blue cheese, pecans, and baby spinach. It was good but the portion was pretty small. We also ordered the herb crusted salmon salad. I expected the salmon to be warm but it came out cold. Most salmon salads I'm used to the salmon is nice and warm and cooked medium but it seems like cheese cake factory's salmon was pre-cooked, over cooked and sat in a refrigerator until served. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush and was not attentive. Overall I'd rather choose a mom and pop shop spend the same amount of money for better food."
Jennifer J.,"Henderson, NV",9,25,8,5.0,7/12/2012,The staff is so attentive and sweet! The counter take out is efficient and always ready to take your order! The bathrooms are clean and the booths are always wiped down. This is one of the nicest CCF on this side of town!
Chad B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,1,4.0,8/5/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites across the board due to the consistency of the food and service. Tonight I ordered the fried cheese starter platter, soup du jour (tortilla), and the Chicken and Biscuit entree. Let me start off but saying the fried cheese was excellent, about 8 little triangles perfectly breaded and crisped with Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses and melted to perfection. They were the perfect temperature. The soup was so-so, a basic bisque like consistency with corn and some other veggies. It had a nice spicy finish but at first bite the saltiness is a little  overwhelming. The entree is one of my favorite a good solid buttermilk biscuit, very flaky and buttery, with a vegetable melange (carrots were slightly undercooked) , mushrooms, and peas. The chicken however was moist and juicy, pan seared to perfection. It also had just the right amount of rosemary crust. And the gravy that they use is fantastic, not to rich or thick, and not overly seasoned. That's what I like about this entree it's not overly done so you can really enjoy each component. And our server, Nick, totally professional and nice and a real babe. Over all a great experience and will definitely be back!"
Roy D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,22,14,2.0,5/10/2015,"Good food, lousy service. If the server is named Stephanie L., ask for another server or risk getting the poor service we received.  We visited on a busy Mothers' Day weekend and the service was sub-standard. First, the server forgot our appetizer and brought it out only after we asked in confusion because our main entrées came out while we we waited for the fried calamari. Second, no refills were offered for our soda. Third, our take-home boxes was missing one of the entrées which probably didn't get boxed in confusion. Finally, I realized that the Cheesecake Factory is one of those establishments that calculates the customary 15% gratuity on the dinner + the tax instead of correctly on just the dinner itself. Anyone of these service issues by themselves would not have been a big deal, but all of them combined made our dining experience less than special for us. The only thing saving the Mothers' Day lunch was that the food was delicious."
Teri C.,"Henderson, NV",0,32,1,5.0,3/8/2015,Went for the first time to TCF..... I had the Cuban and salad it was delicious and so fresh.... Very big portion I had to take half of my sandwich with me. My friends had the soup of the day which was clam chowder which they loved. But the cheesecake was outrageous!!!! We split the dulce de leche and the peanut butter..... Now the only question is...... What will I have next time
Jerold G.,"Henderson, NV",54,38,1,3.0,3/2/2014,Since its a cheese cake factory its like all the other cheese cake factories. It has solid food but lacks the attention details you will find in the mom and pop shops. its good but not great in my oppinion.
Matt W.,"Colorado Springs, CO",15,138,90,4.0,1/30/2014,The menu has ads... That's pretty much the only negative thing I can say. The food is always spot on and very big. And cheesecake!
Mat J.,"Henderson, NV",88,149,13,4.0,4/12/2012,"I love this place! I have to admit that we eat the cheesecake more often then the food, but isn't that what the place is named after? My two favorite flavors are Pineapple upside down cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. I love that there are a ton of creative flavors and you aren't stuck with the boring East Coast Mentality of... plain cheesecake with cherry filling on top, its the only way because it tradition! (they do that have that one too)  As for this location, we like to sit at the bar. Its always easy to walk in and get a seat at the bar even when the place is packed. We find the bartenders full of life and very friendly. An important detail for me is that my drink is never empty... its just a good sign that your server is on the ball."
Michele H.,"Henderson, NV",167,152,55,4.0,6/2/2013,"I'm giving only four stars as this restaurant varies time to time with experience. But this experience was excellent, mostly in part due to our waiter Joe P.  From the beginning he was excellent with giving my daughter paper to go with crayons I brought (they don't give kids any), to giving advice on what to order based on the selections I was choosing between. He was quite attentive keeping our cups full and asking if we needed anything. He even brought the cheesecake in to go boxes as we weren't eating more than a few bites!  Then the food was better than usual, not sure if choices or chef of the day but food was good. I had BBQ chicken salad which is my fave at a competing restaurant, I liked it better here! He had some kind of chicken and shrimp in a warm PB sauce (I can't remember name) and he loved it. Then I don't like cheesecake but I eat the Adams peanut butter usually, Joe reccommended the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was decadent! He had red velvet as his fave!  The best part was the managers or owners or something were meeting with the chefs across from us and they kept saying how cute and wonderful my daughter is. That is the truth! Lol!"
Shelby O.,"Henderson, NV",0,5,,5.0,6/19/2014,"My go to take out restaurant. Whether I'm sitting at home and can't think of anything to eat Cheesecake Factory is always delicious with more then enough items to choose from. The Louisiana chicken pasta is my all time favorite menu item. If you are looking for a nice semi casual dinner with friends, family, or clients, Cheesecake Factory is always a great choice!"
K S.,"Henderson, NV",0,8,,1.0,11/30/2014,"We have visited the Henderson, NV location many times since 2007 and I have to say that tonight was the last straw. Our server, Deanna displayed unprofessional and inexcusable behavior towards my husband and I as well as our 4 guests. After we were seated we were greeted by our sever who unfortunately was about to leave for the day. She introduced Deanna as our new server while she made sure we had plenty to drink before she left. Deanna proceeded to take our food order and was very vocal when our friends ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with an extra order of fries. They told her that they were sharing the sandwich to which Deanna replied loudly ""that's it ? You're sharing a sandwich?"" She seemed irritated and it continued when my husband and I ordered the crusted chicken romano with a salad to share. She commented again ""you're sharing too?"" Then to cap it off when our friend's 5 year old told her father that she wasn't hungry she stated ""so she isn't eating anything!""  Honestly, I found her behavior apalling and I have no problem taking my business to Lucille's and/or Claim Jumpers which are both just across the street. The food here is good but I don't need to be shamed for sharing a dinner that is actually large enough for 3 people. We will not be back anytime soon!!!"
Lonely D.,"Rocklin, CA",11,109,3,4.0,8/9/2011,"In Memorium: Beef Ribs The Cheesecake Factory is a very expensive restaurant with many items to choose from...yet, stupidly, they lost the best choice on the menu, the Beef Ribs.  Yes, they were over $25 a rack, but they were the best damn beef ribs I've EVER had, period.  So how could they get rid of it?  I don't understand it. When I inquired about it, they said that they change their menus all the time.  It may be back.  They also mentioned that it was their most requested item off the old menu, which doesn't make any sense. This four-star review reflects their current menu options...if they ever decide to bring them back, the beef ribs make it an easy 5 stars. Also, be sure to check out their strawberry lemonade...it's served with sugar around the rim, and it's deliciously sweet and refreshing.  Seriously the best strawberry lemonade I've tasted (comparable to Lucille's Smokehouse, which is also pretty damn good)."
K M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,30,,1.0,4/8/2015,"What a disappointment! I don't mind waiting for a table when it's busy. If I didn't like the wait, I would go elsewhere. But when you are finally seated and then you get to watch servers run around you for 15 minutes and not even one stops to greet you, THAT is very annoying. I finally had to get up, go to the hostess station, and threaten to walk out in 60 seconds if a server didn't show up. Well, that got their attention, or so I thought. Then, the server comes and complains to us (!!) that he was taken out of his section and ""thrown"" at us. Thrown?? Sorry to be a burden, pal. Your comment directly affects your tip unless maybe you don't understand how a fleeting patron-server relationship works. You be nice - I be nice. It's that simple - not a long-term commitment. We haven't been back since and it would take a lot to get us to walk into another Cheesey-cake Factory. Why not just call it the ""Factory"" if that's how you treat people?"
Arianna R.,"Henderson, NV",20,28,19,4.0,7/7/2013,"9 times out of 10 I love my food, but every now and again I get a dud. Service is always pretty good. Great place to come if you have a party of people with different food carvings because the menu is so big it pretty much has everything one could want, including a separate healthy menu."
Jadie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,26,1,5.0,3/24/2013,"I had an excellent lunch with co-workers. I had a salad and cheescake. Everything was good. My friends enjoyed their lunch too. Our server David was fantastic. The service was fast, friendly and zero mistakes."
Brad T.,"Henderson, NV",35,29,5,1.0,6/14/2014,I was there one a date and lost the opportunity to bed one of the cutest little French spinners you have ever seen over the service we received.  We waited an hour and a half for our stinky meatloaf.  Followed by our 30 minute wait for cheesecake.  I have to admit the food was actually good.  The problem is the little hot French spinner had a curfew.  She had promised me a great time.  We were late for curfew when we left the Restraunt.  Thanks a lot.  She got back with her boyfriend of 4 years the next week.  I could have been her mistake.
