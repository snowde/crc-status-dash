Teresa H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,6,7,4.0,7/19/2013,Dined in at this location for the first time for happy hour. Bartender was great at suggesting items without pushing them on you. It is setup nicely for solo dining or small groups. Service was fast and the food was good.
Jeremy S.,"Las Vegas, NV",142,22,17,4.0,9/7/2013,"This is one of our favorites for satisfying a sweet tooth, and the food isn't bad either. Service is always attentive and prompt, sometimes to a fault. There are only so many interruptions I care to have during a sitting. That's just me, you may love the extra attention. We personally love the setting and just about everything about this place."
Mary S.,"Las Vegas, NV",146,23,14,3.0,12/2/2011,"We showed up at around 9pm on a Saturday and it wasn't even busy. We did have about 7 adults and 3 kids but our wait time was only about 10 minutes. The only good thing I can say is that our kids got their food faster than anything else. I just wanted a simple burger with bacon, the rest of their options weren't what I wanted. I got the bleu cheese burger WITHOUT bleu cheese...of course it was like an hour later they finally bring us our dishes and it had the bleu cheese. I was really disappointed because the waiter was kind of mean. He tells me ITS NOT and totally insisted i try it. If I don't like it, why would I eat it?! My husband tasted it and said of course it's bleu cheese. If it wasn't then there wouldn't be any cheese on the burger at all :( They sent it back and I had to wait another 10-15 minutes for them to make a new one...Considering our tab was over $280, I wouldn't go back there for the bad service I received and my burger wasn't even good to say the least..."
Mai D.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",11,12,5,5.0,11/25/2013,Came in for a late dinner for 3. We were seated right away! The waiter was cool! He was easy going and attentive! He made sure we had everything thing we needed without checking on us every 5 minutes. I ordered the filet mignon with a side of sautéed spinach. The steak was done just right. Real juicy. I forgot to mention that we started out with the chicken lettuce wraps and they were a 10 out of 10!! I had an overall good dinner experience. I'll be back sooner than later.
William S.,"Henderson, NV",0,14,,5.0,1/29/2014,My family loves the food here and the great service! Not to mention of course the cheesecakes! Keep up the good work!
Sharr E.,"Henderson, NV",22,85,6,5.0,6/21/2011,"Well, when my birthday plans fell apart, My roommate took me to the Cheesecake factory for dinner.  We started with Calamari which was very good, the calamari was NOT rubbery , it was easy to chew , and was perfectly breaded. Completely delicious. She ordered the Thai pasta ... and I ordered the Chicken Romano Both were delicious. I loved the Chicken romano, the chicken was crispy and the pasta was delicious. There was so much that I could only eat half my dinner. The Thai pasta.. I have to confess I kept stealing bites of my roommates dinner. The texture was good, the mix of flavors was just amazing ... I think I found a new favorite dish. I think my roommate was wishing she had ordered something else after I kept trying to distract her so I could steal bites. We drank the Passion Iced Tea. It was really complimentary to the meal.  Our server kept the glasses filled and even brought a huge glass of ice when ours melted too fast.  Then we ordered CHEESECAKE... She ordered the Tuxedo cheesecake . I tried a bite and the rich chocolate is definitely going to fit on my schedule from now on. It is perfectly chocolatey.   I ordered The Caramel cheesecake I can't remember what the fancy schmancey name is .. but it was yummy in my tummy.  They even sang happy birthday to me .. how rockin is that??"
Vicki D.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",59,102,42,4.0,8/19/2013,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a long time. Went there with friends for dessert after a movie. I had the 30th anniversary cheesecake which was really good, big portion that I was able to share with one of my friends. The service was good. The only complaint would be that it was very noisy from music playing from speakers in the ceiling. The server got part of our order wrong because he couldn't hear us unless we shouted."
Jennifer S.,"Henderson, NV",6,14,9,4.0,12/4/2013,"Love the atmosphere and food, my favprite is the cobb salad. usually has okay service but could definitely be better! Won't stop me from coming back."
Mike C.,"Las Vegas, NV",171,465,157,4.0,1/10/2011,"I have been going to this location for the last several years and have yet to be let down with any of my trips here. When family or friends come to town and are not sure what they are in the mood for i bring them here. They have such a diverse menu and there is always something from everone. here are a few of my favorites. -Grilled Mahi taco which i order %95 of the time -Calamari as an App. always good and love the dipping sauce -Chicken Costeletta- lighly breaded served with mash potatos and asparagus -I have tried or sampled most of the pasta dishes my wife has ordered and haven't had a complaint about one yet. -Corn fritters are delicious -Cheese cake of coarse. I like most that i have tried but didn't like the red velvet one. too much icing overwhelmed what little cake was there, just not a good balance - I always have a mojito or two or three... Can't wait to go back, this location is always busy so plan for that in advance"
Colleen W.,"Long Beach, CA",16,292,,4.0,10/1/2013,"When we are in Vegas we love to check out the surrounding areas too.  After visiting Green Valley Ranch resort and the Shops at Green Valley ranch we decided to go here to eat some lunch.  We ordered the Skinnylicious Mexican salad and the Chicken lettuce tacos.  The tacos were a-ok.  The salad was very good with  Corn Tortilla ... topped with Chicken Breast and Black Beans with Mixed Greens, Corn, Green Onion and Cilantro.  Tossed in a Vinaigrette and a little Avocado  , Salsa and Sour Cream.  After eating off of the skinnylicious menu and not feeling too guilty we ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake.  If you like Red velvet cake and Cheesecake this is a must have.  Moist layers of Red Velvet Cake (I hate when its dry) with cheesecake in between.  Cheesecake frosting.  Delicious.   After that we felt a bit guilty but very satisfied.  Service was attentive and friendly."
Angel L.,"Henderson, NV",1,17,,2.0,4/2/2015,"I want to start out by saying I LOVE the cheesecake factory. I would give the one in Anaheim, CA (in the Gardenwalk) 5 stars. With that said, I give this specific establishment 2 stars. The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes you will get a server that is right on point but most the time the servers are ""ok."" The food gets screwed up at this place on a regular basis. One of the mess ups out of many was burned French fries. At an establishment like this I expect high standards. First off the cook was a jerk for even putting it out there to be served. Second the waitress failed by bringing it to us after clearly seeing that it was burned. We had to tell her they were burned (it was obvious) and she didn't even apologize or seem sympathetic she just said ok i'll get you another one, in a quick fast tone. If you alter a dish, they will bring it to you wrong. And i'm not talking about an extreme alteration. I'm talking about asking for a different type of pasta vs. the one it comes with. If they mess up your dish it will come back more screwed up as if to punish you for having the audacity to correct the mistake. Take out is always a guarantee mess up and they always give you less food when you do take out vs. when you sit inside. I am speaking from 3 years of experience with this place. If you can, go to the one in Summerlin they are much better and more on target. its really sad that such an awesome establishment is screwed up and nothing is done to rectify it. I'm not going to list all the messed up incidents from this place because it will turn into a novel. Its a great food chain with wonderful food. There is something for everyone here and you will not be disappointed with the taste of your food, when made properly. I know a lot of flack is given to this place for the high fat and calorie content. I really don't think that people are looking at it from the proper perspective. You need to know they give you huge portions here. The fat and calorie content is based on the huge plate of food you receive. This place is giving you all this food with the intent of being able to have the consumer bring some home for later. You cant possible think that you are supposed to eat all that food in one sitting. The food you get on your plate is way more then what you would get on the appetizer plate. Appetizers are meant to serve 2-4 people and your entrée contains more food then that. So I will leave you with that food for thought ;). If you eat the proper portion its really not that bad in fat and calories. Have you ever seen the fat and calories in a marie calendars frozen meal at the grocery store?! Just think, the portion in a Marie Calendar's frozen meal is 1/3 to 1/4 less then what you would receive on your plate at The Cheesecake factory."
April F.,"Las Vegas, NV",212,101,65,3.0,9/26/2010,"I know this place is a chain, but I like it. It's a good go-to place for get-togethers. The menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so everyone can find something they like and leave full. First off, I love the bread. I can make a meal out of that bread and butter any day of the week. And the cheesecake. How can you deny a slice of heaven? My latest fave is the red velvet cheesecake. I'm not a huge red velvet fan, but when you layer it with cheesecake and top it with cream cheese icing? Aweeesumm. Other notable menu items: deep fried macaroni and cheese and the Chicken Madeira."
Katherine C.,"Henderson, NV",0,14,,4.0,12/14/2013,I love the fish and chips here and the carrot cake and the carrot cake cheesecake. Nice bar area that you can also dine at without waiting for a table. Good service too.
Chrystal Anne M.,"Irvine, CA",286,53,23,5.0,6/4/2011,"Moving Review from old Account]  The Cheesecake Factory Categories:American (Traditional),Desserts 5/29/2011 This place was incredible. Met by a friendly staff, quick, polite. Place was beautifully decorated and was playing awesome music. Our waitress was awesome. Very funny and on top of everything. We had the avocado rolls, it comes with a sweet and sour kind of sauce, was really good. Also the Shepard's pie ( to die for, srsly), and the fettuccine Alfredo. This location is the best cheesecake factory experience I had at one of those. If you are in LV i would recommend dropping by."
Jason r.,"Henderson, NV",521,116,186,5.0,6/3/2011,Very delicious and big portions and great cheesecake and the service is fantastic and it's a beautiful restaurant and very lively
Sheila B.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,96,,3.0,10/13/2010,"With the many choices available to Vegasites, it's always tough for me when a friend suggests a place like the Cheesecake Factory. I'm totally not a hater (okay... well, in this case, maybe I am a little bit)... but when you live in a foodies paradise, is that the best you can do? Anyhoo... I pull into the parking lot and there's a Semi Limo (as in, truck in the front, limo in the back) in the parking lot. Immediate thought: only in Vegas.... maybe I will be surprised. And, surprised I was. I went for the Spicy Chicken Salad (sub-ing the bird for the shrimp) and was surprised at the freshness of the mixed greens, the bite in the peppers and the distinctiveness of the cilantro. The spicy vinaigrette was also a nice touch. This salad was not the type that would have been made in the Cheesecake Factory I remembered.  Can I give CF higher than 3 stars? No, not when there are so many other fabulous restos in this city. But, for a good go-to place with lots of options and decent service, you can't go wrong with this place."
Jessie B.,"Henderson, NV",74,774,122,5.0,8/2/2010,"July 30th is National Cheesecake Day. What better way to celebrate this surely made-up holiday then by meeting some friends at The Cheesecake Factory? That is exactly what I did this past Friday. My group was made up of a coworker, his wife, their 2 year old son, and another coworker. Two of us arrived first, we decided to start out in the bar area because it was happy hour. $5 drinks!  Despite the crowd, we were seated within about 10 minutes from arrival. Our server, Paul, greeted us with an ""Aloha!"" and brought out waters and some bread for us to munch on while we waited for the rest of our group.  Once the rest of our group arrived, Paul came back over to see if we had any questions. A member of our group asked him for his personal suggestions and he rattled off his favorites for all parts of the menu, from salads to pasta to fish dishes.  Anyone that has been to The Cheesecake Factory knows that the menu is like a short novel, I was impressed with how knowledgeable Paul was about everything on the menu.  Since some of us were hungry and others were more interested in drinks and desert (namely, me!), we ended up splitting a few appetizers between the group, and then two people ordered entrees as well. First appetizer choice was avocado egg rolls. This is my must-order item at Cheesecake Factory, nothing compares to their avocado egg rolls. We also had the crab cakes and the sweet corn tamale cakes. They were all excellent.  Finally it was desert time. Since it was National Cheesecake Day, all slices were half price. Bonus! I ordered my usual, a slice of the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. It is unbelievable, the tartness of the lemon and raspberry are the perfect compliment to the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake. Paul ended up being the icing on the cake, the reason a 4 star review became a 5 star one. He was an exceptional server, he always seemed to know when to come check on us, and when to leave us alone. A member of our group was so pleased with the service he waited after paying the bill to speak to the manager and let him know just how happy he was to have had Paul serve us.  Will I be back? Yes, and I won't be waiting til National Cheesecake Day to go!"
Sarah V.,"Henderson, NV",17,28,156,4.0,2/22/2012,"Their ""Glamburgers"" are very good! Le Burger at the Paris Casino is still better, but I was pleasantly surprised! The last time I ate here was a year ago and my fish and my husband's steak were both grossly undercooked...and they MICROWAVED them and reserved them to us. A year later, I didnt get the fish, hahah! I got the Farmhouse burger, so good! Over-easy cooked egg on top. Cant miss it! Shephards Pie is OK but best shephards pie in the area is at McMullins Pub by the Orleans Casino."
Donna C.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",36,17,44,2.0,11/14/2014,"We came in here on a Sunday night and had the worst experience EVER. I love cheesecake factory but the service was horrible. We waited for 45 mins for our table, got seated & waited another 20 mins to get greeted. Our food came out cold and the server never came back once to check up on us once he delivered our food. We complained to the manager and he was nice enough to comped our dinner and apologized to us."
Gregg H.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,38,19,3.0,9/15/2013,"Usually have a nice time & meal, but today they seam to of had Sunday blues. They had no sugarless syrup when they said they do. They served an omelette that was incorrect. They dropped the onion rings on the floor. At least all the servers had their usual politeness. Hopefully they get through  the rest of today smoother than this morning."
