Jesse C.,"Henderson, NV",50,162,5,4.0,10/2/2012,"I really enjoy the food, the atmosphere and the service.  My only compaint is this place can be expensive.  I don't remember the name of the dish I got last time, but it was some chicken over angel hair with garlic cream sauce and it was fabulous.  I also really like the Nachos so anyone who isn't into pasta can order some things for them too.  Although I have never had one myself because I was too full, others I have been with have gotten several different cakes and they all look amazing.  So if you are a fan of cheesecake, I would definetly suggest trying a piece."
Samantha R.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,75,,1.0,6/7/2012,I had a really bad expiernce here they had us waiting for like two hours and when we finally got our table it took them another hour to take our order.  I mean really get some service
Michael J.,"Lakeside, CA",30,195,2,4.0,8/21/2013,Went at 6pm and though it was packed we were seated in 5 min. Staff was friendly and attentive. Our server Grant was very good!! Food was delicious and portion sizes were good.
Chase A.,"Provo, UT",1,99,14,5.0,6/26/2011,What a visit! Fantastic service. Best server I've had.  We find it's always good to skip a meal BEFORE eating here. The diet coke with lime; the bread; the Mexican corn cakes;  incredible! For dinner: the smokehouse burger. I dare say . . . The best burger I have ever had. Maybe it was the moment. The bun was perfect and toasty. Bacon was crispy. Beef was perfect. Onion rings on the burger. Yummy BBQ-ranch sauce. And then cabbage rather than lettuce??  Oh yeah!  Crunchy and fresh.  I would highly recommend this burger.
Robyn R.,"Henderson, NV",0,26,5,2.0,1/8/2015,"First timer the hostesses were STUPID told us 15 min waited 40 told us our table was being bussed sat 4 other people. Almost walked out, dinner was awesome- waitress kathia saved the day."
dan r.,"Las Vegas, NV",236,22,7,2.0,8/22/2010,The chain is great.   Cheesecake factory has a HUGE menu and prides itself on creating an amazing environment full of space.  This location (Green Valley) is really hit-or-miss from a service perspective.   If you are looking for something to eat around this area take the safe bet and go to Elephant Bar or PF Changs.    I have had servers at this location be real rockstars and then I have had folks who realllllllly seemed like they hated to be at work.   When you are spending almost $100 on a meal for you family you expect at least marginal service.
Sam N.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,28,192,1.0,11/19/2012,"First off, I'm a huge fan of The Cheesecake Factory and have been eating at different ones religiously throughout the years, but my experience at this location was a gigantic disappoint, to say the least.  When I suggested The Cheesecake Factory to one of my friends, he said that the food wasn't great and overpriced at that. Since this has always been one of my favorite places to go, of course I had to argue with him. Determined to prove him wrong, I insisted that we go here for dinner. We went in, put our name down on the wait list, and went outside for a cigarette. Now this is a normal practice, and typically restaurant hosts will always check outside for the next table to be seated if nobody answers their call from inside, especially if the waiting area inside is full! They didn't even try to look for us when we were literally standing just outside of the door (which we had also let the hostess know before stepping out), and it took a leaving customer to inform us that we were up for a table. We ended up having to sit outside because they sat somebody else at our table. Our waitress was friendly (which was the only pro of the night). I ordered a rare steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. When the food came out, my steak was COLD. Not even room temperature, but cold. When I informed our waitress, she had the audacity to tell me that in order for them to cook it rare, they could only throw it on the grill for a couple seconds which meant that it was normal for it to be cold. Are you seriously kidding me? I don't ever eat anything BUT rare steak, and I have yet gone to a restaurant and been served a cold one. Furthermore, if you don't know how the steak Diane at The Cheesecake Factory is, the steak is actually thinly sliced into little pieces, about three inches in diameter. So it doesn't take much for the meat to get heated up. As a reference, I have ordered this dish before at several other Cheesecake Factories, and not once have I encountered this problem.  At this point I was just bummed out, but my friend insisted on complaining to the manager, so that's who we asked for. It was a good 15 minutes before anybody walked past us or any of the tables around. We had to asked for a manager twice before our waitress came back with my steak re-cooked. The manager lingered in the background behind her and they both left after she gave me my steak. At this point we just asked for the check and a to-go box since our appetites were gone. I didn't even bother checking my steak to see if it was any good this time around. I didn't bother mentioning, but my herb crusted salmon was exceptionally bland. I had to season the life into it with salt and pepper myself. At least it was decently cooked, and with how they treated my steak, I didn't even want to complain about anything else. I don't remember what my date had to eat, but it's safe to say that we were just as impressed with his dish as we were with mine, which was not at all. I'm a very easy-going and forgiving person, so for me the big issue isn't necessarily the poor cooking, but the service and management (as I've seen other reviewers have pointed out). They should have just fixed the problem when it was presented, instead of making excuses. We were not being rude or unfriendly (in fact quite the opposite, despite of everything) and it's not like I was asking for the meal to be comped or discounted. In addition, I've never seen worse management skills. The manager never bothered to introduce himself or ask us how we were doing, even though we had specifically asked for him. Everything was a huge hassle and they made me feel like I was someone who was super picky or asking too much. My friend is right in that The Cheesecake Factory is a relatively pricey place to eat and based on my experience at this location, it is definitely not worth it. Worst $50 of my life, which doesn't even include tax and tip. It's a good thing our waitress was at least friendly and smiled through the night, because her other service skills were quite lacking. I don't even know how the manager was hired, because he showed no managerial skills whatsoever. I was so embarrassed that I insisted on going to eat here and defended this place when everything turned out to be horrible.  This particular Cheesecake Factory is definitely not up to par. Avoid at all costs."
Missy A.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,38,1,5.0,6/25/2013,Love it here. Always fun and great service! On this particular visit I decided to try the Pina Colada Cheesecake and it was an absolute delight to my taste buds. For my main course I had the Jambalaya... extremely yummy to my tummy!
Jeanette M.,"Medina, OH",0,15,,5.0,12/13/2014,"I love the lettuce wraps.  Garlic Bread  Was One Of The Best I Have Had.  Our server was great, not sure her name.  In fact I think there were two helping us. Jason and I enjoyed the chocolate peanut butter cheese cake after. With A Late.  We where going to go for drinks at a local bar, but decided to stay and sit at the bar.  So pleased we did.  Go just for the bar experience."
Ayla B.,"Henderson, NV",26,30,12,4.0,7/25/2010,"First things first- Host team, thumbs up! Very welcoming & sweet. I like it when the hosts address me, instead of me having to get their attention.  Michael H. was an awesome server, he was very helpful & attentive. It took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted- & he was very patient. Not to mention, he kept our glasses filled with water the entire meal...which is quite a feat, considering we drink like fish.  Shrimp Scampi Crostini- excellent, very rich in flavor & THICK for a ""small plate"".  White Bean Hummus- very refreshing, I think I might even prefer it prepared with white beans as opposed to chickpeas.  The red velvet cheesecake was TO DIE FOR. My goodness! My boyfriend isn't even a fan of red velvet, & he said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had.  Great experience, all around!!!"
Cintya P.,"La Quinta, CA",190,441,517,2.0,6/26/2012,"I do love the Cheesecake Factory, but I'm grading this one on a 2/5 stars because of the quality of food we received. I'm sorry but stale cold nachos with stringy and chewy cheese is just unacceptable. I'm sure it doesn't take long to make a good hot plate of cheesy melty hot and creamy nachos right to order....so why not of made it a la minute before making the other entrees and having the runner bring it out when it was hot and ready to go? Or perhaps it was the runner's delay of bringing the food? Also, if a customer wants their burger medium and you give them a burnt black burger...that's not good."
C L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,9/7/2013,"I'm giving one star strictly based on service. The food is great.  I had just moved to Las Vegas from California and have eaten at multiple Cheesecake Factory locations on many different occasions.  We decided to eat in the bar area rather than wait for a table. We sat down and our server, Melissa N., came up after a few minutes and took our drink orders but didn't ask us if we wanted to eat (we ordered 3 waters and a lemonade). She brought back our waters and walked away. We tried to flag her down for menus but she never stopped. One of us went to the host stand and got menus, 10 minutes later she came back and we placed our order and asked about the lemonade and she said she'd bring it right back and did.  While we were waiting for our food she brought us bread however she forgot bread plates and place settings. We waited for a few minutes and didn't see her so we asked another server if we could have silverware and she promptly returned with silverware, napkins, and bread plates.  Our dinner arrived via food runners and upon inspection 1 of the 3 salads had dressing and one of the sandwiches had mushrooms when we requested there were none. We waited and waited, no Melissa, so we stopped a host who was walking by if she could find her. She finally appeared and delivering another tables food and one of us had to walk after her because she never even checked on us.  She apologized for the mushrooms and said she'd have another one sent right out and also said she'd bring the dressing right back, ""I'll be right back with your balsamic"" however, I previously had asked for ranch.  It took another 10-15 minutes for someone to tell us that the sandwich was almost done. It was a manager and I asked for it to be packaged to-go because everyone was already done eating. We told him about the utter lack of service and he apologized and offered to buy us desert, we accepted. Melissa came back with the sandwich packaged to-go and asked what kind of deserts we'd like, we told her and requested no whipped cream be put on the cheesecake.  She said she'd get them packaged up for us and left the bill. The manager was kind enough to comp the meal but only comped one of the slices of cheesecake after he offered to buy it for us.  We paid the bill and Melissa returned with our cheesecakes, of course one had whipped cream. I would NEVER recommend this location to anyone strictly based on service, the food quality and portions are great but the service is absolutely dismal.  Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills, Glendale, Redondo Beach, and Thousand Oaks are a few of the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to and I'd give all of these locations 5 stars all the way around and have no hesitation recommending them to anyone."
Gabby F.,"Henderson, NV",0,16,2,1.0,8/8/2014,I used to LOVE this place. But the service was TERRIBLE. The woman was so slow and put her FINGER in my food!!!! I won't be coming back.
Ron F.,"Woodland, CA",16,164,35,4.0,10/1/2012,"My favorite was the Thai chicken wrap appetizer.  Great to share but don't plan on having room for dessert unless there are four of you sharing it. The menu here offers a huge variety. I ventured away from my usual favorite entrées (Meat loaf, asian or one of the pasta dishes) and tried the jambalaya pasta. The flavor was delicious but the chicken was dry,  as was the entire dish. It was probably overcooked. The flavor was so good that I may try it again after getting the waiter's opinion about the norm for this dish.  About the waiter,  he did a great job despite a very busy night. We spent $80 for 2, with alcohol. Norm is more like $20-$25 ea. Recommended"
Annie G.,"Spanaway, WA",265,96,283,5.0,2/28/2012,"After church, came to the District. We took the kids to the big carousel so that they could ride. The kids had a blast, shortly after, we walked around in the Whole Food market, and came to Cheesecake Factory. We had a little wait, but it was well worth it. We were seated as quickly as possible. The waiter was awesome. My son had a dish that consisted of meatloaf, mash potatoes, and a soup. I had a seafood sandwich dish that included the sandwich, salad, and a soup. Everything was fantastic. One of my nephews ordered the corn dogs and fries of the kiddies meal. My other nephew had kids pizza and kids Mac and cheese. My mom had a soup and salad dish. And my dad had an appetizer as his dish. The bill for the six of us came out to be about $87. We had a great time eating, talking, and taking in the ambient environment."
Sam T.,"Las Vegas, NV",139,185,15,5.0,3/29/2012,I have been here probably 5 times in the last 3 months. I can honestly say that out of every single experience we have had great service and the best food in Las Vegas. The menu is so diverse and anyone can find something to love here. I really think this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Service never disappoints and once when I made a mistake on my order the waitress had my entree remade to my liking and didn't even bat an eye. Priceless! I will gladly bring friends and family to the Cheesecake Factory anytime!! Can't wait to go back. BTW my favorite dinner is the Spicy Chicken Chiptole pasta!! Love it!!
Yasmin V.,"Kailua Kona, HI",2,24,5,4.0,6/3/2014,"My husband doesn't like chain restaurants so to get him to try Cheesecake Factory, I had to lure him in under the premise of Happy Hour. Happy to say, the staff at this CF did not disappoint! Fast, friendly service- awesome happy hour pups and great cocktails. $5 each? Wow. I have found something to like about visiting the Las Vegas area!"
Jae G.,"Las Vegas, NV",430,117,247,4.0,1/27/2010,I can never go wrong with cheesecake factory! The menu seems endless and with so much variety. The staff has been great. Red Velvet cheesecake is to die for.
Michelle C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",184,140,133,3.0,12/27/2011,Came here around 2pm to take a lil dessert back to the hotel! This place was crowded and hot. Outside was cooler! I didnt like this place because of it being crowded and hot inside.
Sandra S.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,15,1,5.0,2/28/2012,I am really happy that more restaurants have the lower calories menus now went here Sunday and they had a separate low Carrie menu. Since I belong to Weight Watchers but still like to eat out sometimes this helps me a lot Thanks
