Gordy Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,3,4,1.0,1/1/2013,"I had the worst experience. My family and I waited forever. The electronic device to let you know you're ready to be sat didn't work. They gave me another one but didn't program it. Another 25 minutes went by and nothing. If it wasn't my mother-in-laws favorite place to eat, I would have left already. When I went to the desk to see how long we had, our name was crossed off. I complained yet again. Then the girl who originally took our name said ""Sorry your next"". About a minute went by and she forgot and sat another party of 3. How can a 1/2 way Intelligent person forget something one minute later? ""Are you kidding me!!!""  I will never go there again and hope anyone that reads this takes warning of the bad service."
Mark P.,"Temecula, CA",17,271,11,2.0,6/26/2012,This is not my first CCF.  Lately I am afraid their quailty is going down.  I had a chicken sandwich and the chicken was tough and dry.  The fries were cold and tasteless.  For the cost of meals it really is not that great.  Service was good.
Brian W.,"Ridgecrest, CA",6,4,,5.0,6/15/2014,"Had to wait for a bit because most of the guests were celebrating with family and their recent graduates.  We ordered the Avocado Rolls for appetizers and they were awesome.  For the main meal, I had the Meatloaf and it's so much food, I couldn't finish it.  But I did have room for the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake and now I have diabetes. (Just kidding).  Definitely a restaurant I'd stop by again whenever I visit Vegas."
Paula S.,"Henderson, NV",117,18,3,4.0,6/5/2012,"The location is perfect, celebrated a birthday luncheon with a few co-workers and had the Miso Salmon plate with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed brocolli it was fresh, healthy and very tasty not to mention the strawberry cheesecake for desert. All four of us enjoyed our meal for less than $100. The service was excellent, no wait time and everyone is very curteous. We then strolled around the district before returning to work. This turned into a wonderful afternoon."
Kathryn D.,"Henderson, NV",18,123,17,4.0,11/26/2007,"No reviews?  Oh, my.  Well it is a chain, but it's a good chain.  It has saved our taste buds more than once from the likes of Chili's and Applebee's.  We love to eat here for a late lunch, when there isn't the hundreds of people waiting in line.  I could eat most any of the appetizers (except the fried macaroni -- too weird), but love the corn cakes.  I'm a Chicken Romano kind of girl and my husband varies from the Steak Diane to the Shepard's Pie to lots of other things.  I am so glad that they now have ""lunch"" portions.  They are still too big for me to finish, but at least I'm not leaving an entire cow on my plate.   We always wonder why they can have such a huge menu and still make most dishes taste terrific when other restaurants can barely make one thing well.  The only thing we avoid is the cheesecake.  I've never liked cheesecake and my husband can take it or leave it.  And after their huge portions, he generally leaves it. Oh, and did I mention the bar?  Great drinks.  I LOVE the smoothies.  The decor is interesting in a Vegas kind of way.  We come here a lot!"
Mike L.,"Hastings, MN",1,96,10,2.0,11/13/2012,"We arrived for a late lunch started off great but ended terrible. Bread good, southwest egg rolls good and the fried zuchini good. But then it just went down. My wife got a small pizza and it was undercooked and soggy, I got the fish and chips, they were very mushy and oily. My son got the alfredo pasta and he liked it. They comped the pizza that did not have a bite out of it and I got an eye roll about the fish. I guess my major problem is crappy food for $100. This was my first time there and unless my wife pays it will be the last."
Cassie H.,"Henderson, NV",26,4,1,1.0,9/9/2011,"Don't come here until they figure out their new menu. We ordered a couple items off the new skinny menu and supposedly they are now cooking their thousands of menu items on the broiler. Maybe they are ""skinny"" items because you will starve, it was an hour and a half till we got our food and all the manager could offer was 2 free cheesecakes (half of a normal portion) in return for a black and blue steak (which I sent back-it was ordered medium), cold fries, cold chicken tacos, cold burger with un-melted cheese, etc. It wasn't our waiters fault he did everything he could to deal with it and we tipped him accordingly. We ended up fighting our $150 bill and got our entrees removed since we ordered 3 rounds of drinks and there was something wrong with all of the entrees, the bill was still over $90. For tonight's performance, i would give no stars if I could."
Hope Y.,"Henderson, NV",23,7,,2.0,10/28/2012,"My husband and I went to the Cheesecake Factory for lunch. PROS- no wait, friendly waiter, large menu. CONS- atmosphere was very warehouse/industrial, food was overpriced. We will not be going back."
Nic D.,"Bullhead City, AZ",0,3,,1.0,5/28/2015,"Went to this place for lunch and what a mistake that was. I ordered the gluten free skinny ceasar salad. I was happy they had an option for me. I received my salad and 3 bites in I found a BUG in my salad. I was shocked and disgusted. The waiter was shocked as well and took my salad. About 5 minutes later the manager came over and gave me a fake smile and apology that was very procedural. She offered me something else but why on earth would I want anything else from this place. I am very limited as to what I eat and this was one of the only options for me. I sure didn't want another salad with BUGS in it. Yes, I get it- it's lettuce and bugs like lettuce but they should be washing their lettuce more thoroughly to avoid this disgusting situation. I had to sit the rest of the meal while others in the party ate their meals which were not salad. As a person in customer service, the manager did not go out of her way to rectify the situation. She could have offered a discount on the rest of the bill. She took the salad off the bill but of course she would, I did not eat it and this was their fault. When we left the same manager was standing near the exit and she turned her back when she saw us leaving. Did not say another word to us. This is horrible customer service at it's finest. I will not ever go back to this place and urge others to be aware of the BUGS in the salad. To all the restaurants out there, when it is your fault someone's meal goes terribly wrong it is your responsibility to make things right. Had they discounted the rest of the bill or heck even offered to cover the bill themselves maybe I wouldn't have written this review! Customer Service should be a priority to make the customer's want to visit again. Cheesecake Factory ruined my day with my family."
Truth Teller T.,"Henderson, NV",0,42,,1.0,6/27/2014,"What a HUGE disappointment!!!  I would never go back to this place for anything other than cheesecake!  Their food is absolutely pathetic!  And I sincerely mean that!  I don't believe people even know what ""good food"" is anymore.  And clearly the manager that was working 6/25/14 @ 1:00 pm, doesn't have a clue!!!  We ordered Fish Taco's & a Beef Sandwich similar to an philly cheese steak.  I kid you not....the taco's had ONE piece of fish in each taco the size of a nickel!  The rest of the taco was shredded cabbage!  The rice sat under a heatlamp so long that it was like biting into uncooked rice!  The sandwich that I ordered was beyond disgusting!  I ordered it without onion's.  When sandwich came it was loaded with onions....so I sent it back.  As well as the pathetic excuse of a fish taco!  Finally the incompetent waitress brought back the sandwich....and it literally had a cold piece of cheese in the roll....with cold raw fatty beef on 2/3's of the roll....and the other 1/3 of the sandwich was bare with nothing in it!!!!!  I couldn't believe they would serve this!  I called the manager over and he said ""Well that's how much meat we use and usually the onions bulk the sandwich up.""  I wanted to backhand this fool!  You serve me cold, raw, fatty beef on 2/3's of a sub roll with cold non-melted cheese and think that's acceptable????  He said well I can get you something else.  At this point I said no thanks....you can keep it....we're leaving!  He said ""what about your taco's we're re-making?""  I said ....Keep those too!!!!  He says...""the waitress feels really bad....she really does.""  The truth is....I could care less how the incompetent waitress feels!!!!!  I'm the one that feels bad here bud!  I just waited 45 minutes for food that I wouldn't give to my dog!!!!  Wow....this manager is in the wrong business!  And that waitress wasn't any better!  This place has NO STANDARDS for their food!  So do yourself a huge favor and go elsewhere!  I ended up going across the street to Capriottis and ordered a philly cheesesteak and it was great compared to the sandwich The Cheesecake Factory attempted to serve me for $13.95!!!!!  What a joke!  Ugh!"
Maria S.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,,1.0,5/16/2015,"So we were celebrating a late moms day/bday lunch & were a party of 13 & gave our name before the rush came in...we were told it'll be a few min...that was at 1230p...so people started coming in & they were called left & rt, & so after 25min we asked again how long & they said if u want to seat outside it'll be faster which was fine by us.  So again more ppl were seated & we were still waiting...so I asked & they said we're still waiting for tables to open up, which after a few min my DIL went to check outside & saw 3 tables open side by side so she told them why can't they put them together we've been waiting for so long & a few min later they put 2 ppl on 1 of the empty ones & my DIL spoke to the mgr & she said why didn't they seat us there & the mgr said she was waiting for these other tables to open up cuz she was thinking to sit  us at another spot & didn't realize she could've sat us at theose other tables...so again we waited even longer...yep a few min means an hour & 20 min...ridiculous....as a mgr she needs to organize the reservation desk & get it together...lack of communication...if u can't handle a large party setup u need to work elsewhere...then to top it off, the waiter forgot to put in the bday person's order in...unreal...thank god the food was good & we just shared with the bday person cuz everyone had already ate & he didn't wanna wait for his food...better to eat there for a small group or they'll tell u a few minutes & just pass u by no stars for me but it won't let me do it!"
Heather R.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,3,3,5.0,5/26/2012,"Finally!!! I loooove this place excellent food as always but the service is really what makes it so wonderful!! Our server Kaytee was absolutely amazing! She was so fast and stayed on top of everything, she noticed we weren't happy with our appetizer and immediately took action even the manager came out to apologize! Kaytee was so sweet and on top of her game all the tables around us were in awe and bragging about her.... Literally! I have been searching for a great spot and lets face it...Vegas has alot of places with great food but it is beyond hard to find good, fast and friendly service BUUTTT I think I finally found it! Great job Cheesecake Factory! I will definitely be back!!!"
Fred S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,2.0,3/16/2014,"It was the first time that I dined at a Cheesecake Factory and it will likely be my last.  The wait time wasn't bad at all even though it appeared very busy.  The waitress was pleasant but seemed rushed.  She filled our drink orders promptly which is a big plus.  It was very noisy but aesthetically pleasing.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was adequate.  We ordered the ribeye steak medium rare for our main course. It came out well done.  They offered to cook another one for us but we didn't think they the next steak would be prepared any better so we just ordered some pasta.  The waitress never apologized for this inconvenience. The pasta was pretty bland but edible.  Overall it was not worth the time or money that we spent there.  If your going to go to a chain restaurant stick to Outback, they at least know how to cook a steak."
Michell M.,"Irvine, CA",58,16,9,3.0,1/22/2011,"I love the cheesecakes here - my favorite is the Dulce de Leche!! The food is okay. I just wish there were more vegetarian options, so I can join my friends when they eat here."
Lanette B.,"Yuba City, CA",0,15,3,4.0,2/25/2014,We love this restaurant and have been to many different locations throughout the states. But this past wkend the service was weird. Our waitress appeared to be drunk or sleepy. It was so bad we asked her to go home. She was falling asleep while taking our orders and her behavior was not the norm for CCF staff. Long story short the  orders were wrong and confused her. (Service for 6) She was replaced with another waiter and we were told she was sent home. So to make us happy we received 3 free cheesecakes and one meal free since it arrived after everyone was finish eating. I can say this was the worst service we have ever had but thank goodness the food remained at its highest quality as we would expect. I must say we did appreciate how fast the managers stepped in to make sure our dining ended on a good note. Becuz we love CCF I can't give it less then 4/5 stars but I will give our waitress a 2 star. Sorry. Hope u get better sleep nxt time u work.
jason w.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,167,2,4.0,10/2/2011,"Went here with my beautiful and perfect girlfriend who is absolutely just a blessing in my life and ordered her whatever her heart desired for lunch. Portions were huge, waiter was awesome, we were full, and cheesecake was delicious even after being snuck into the movie theatres. I gave this place a 4 because it was like 60 bucks for lunch.."
Emmagelle B.,"Henderson, NV",243,96,256,5.0,5/13/2011,"to name a few of my faves: avocado spring rolls, pasta da vinci with sundried tomatoes, chicken bellagio, pasta carbonara, bbq ranch chicken salad, original cheesecake."
Timothy L.,"Henderson, NV",2,24,,2.0,11/24/2011,"I thought it was overpriced and it took forever to get seated. The pasta i ordered was ok, but there are better places for cheaper prices."
Brian C.,"Skokie, IL",44,7,8,4.0,11/10/2014,"good service, good food, good atmosphere. slightly too dark inside... hahaha no big deal though."
Kelly G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,2,2.0,2/14/2014,"Went for Valentine's a day early to beat the crowd. Christine was our server but I wish she wasn't. I ordered the mahi special it was disgusting. There was so much runny chunky tomato on top of the fish and mashed potatoes it was more like a soup. So if you like your fish, tomatoes, and potatoes all swimming together you might like it. I didn't say anything. I know the server noticed me trying to recuse my potatoes from drowning. So she said she was leaving and Jennifer would be taking over. Well I don't think Jennifer was even there yet. 10-15 minutes go by meanwhile Christine is still taking care of the table next to us. Finally Jennifer! She was only there to put in our cheesecakes to go and grab the check. I wish she had been our server the whole time. Night and day difference."
