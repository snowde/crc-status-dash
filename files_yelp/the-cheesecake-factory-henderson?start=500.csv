Jenna W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",38,124,16,4.0,5/17/2011,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories around the country and I was just as happy with my experience here.  We had a large party and were fed relatively quickly.  I do wish the wait staff would have cleaned our table more regularly and given us a bit more time between the appetizer and the mail course.  The pan fried Salmon and pasta was delicious, maybe the best restaurant cooked Salmon I've ever had."
John P.,"Henderson, NV",24,13,7,4.0,6/23/2009,"My favorite aspect of the Cheesecake Factory is its dependability and consistency.  The menu is large and incredibly diverse, yet everything I have there is always good to great.  We're not talking gourmet excellence by any stretch, but for the price point I always enjoy myself there. I'm also a huge fan of their curbside to go system, where you call in your order and they deliver it to your car.  Very convenient and I believe it was the first restaurant to provide the service (at least it was the first that I noticed). Oh yeah, and the cheesecakes are pretty damn good, too.  You have to love the variety offered."
Robert Jr E.,"Signal Hill, CA",216,216,,4.0,2/2/2009,"Before heading back home after our softball tournament in Las Vegas, we decided to come this Cheesecake Factory in Henderson. Wow, Henderson or the Green Valley Ranch area is pretty nice, lots of great stores and restaurants. Getting side-tracked momentarily, so we headed inside the restaurant and it is quite a nice place. Almost has that Las Vegas feel to it! This Cheesecake factory tasted like any other Cheesecake factory - Good Food. Pretty much anything that you order from the menu is gonna be quite delicious. I usually go with my favorite - the Lemon Herb roasted Chicken - simply amazing and a must. Although there desserts they specialize in Cheesecake (which is great by all means), but try there chocolate cake which isnt too shabby at all! If around the area again, definitely would stop by this place again!"
John M.,"Davis, CA",2,6,,4.0,8/19/2011,Food is excellent. Service. Bar. One of my favorite restaurants. I never had a bad meal. It gets crowded at the dinner hour.
Darren S.,"Cedar Park, TX",9,237,,4.0,4/21/2011,"I don't think that I have ever had a bad meal at a Cheesecake factory and this was no different.  Thai chicken pasta and fish & chips were great, as well as the cheesecake."
Sam U.,"Hancock Park, CA",1,89,,4.0,9/1/2012,"Good, solid tasty food, well prepared in sizable amounts for reasonable prices. Waiters were friendly. Bartender poured big glasses of wine. Always a good option at home or travelling."
B. C.,"Pittsfield, MA",110,168,8,4.0,5/30/2010,"I love cheesecake factory and grand lux cafes, so I knew coming in that this was a good choice... we did have a minor hickup with table seating... we were sat next to the POS machine and for the first 1/3 of our meal we got to hear all the personal conversations and happenings of the servers.....    i politely requested to be moved and the manager(didnt get his name) was so fast and efficient in moving us....   his efforts were appreciated...  our server was wonderful!   I would definitely return and feel safe recommending to other yelpers  :)"
Jaime W.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,25,,4.0,1/28/2013,"I took my mom here for her birthday  because she had never been and she's a Big Bang fanatic, so she had to go ""visit"" Penny. When we arrived we only had to wait 10 mins, but once our name was called there was a sea of people that filled the front. So I'm guessing it's a great idea to call ahead. service was fast. Our server Daniel was very nice and poise, looked like he had been serving for years. We started with a CUP of soup, it looked like a regular soup bowl. By the time out entrees arrived, we could barely eat. good thing, because i was so0o disappointed in how my entree tasted. I order a Smokehouse Burger, and it was so0 dry and bland =[ I figured i was a bit out of it, and my taste buds just weren't awake after that AMAZING clam chowder, but no. I brought it all home to my Hubby, and he was confused on when he was going to get some flavor. I don't know if it was an off dish or what, but next time I'm ordering a steak or some pasta, and if they can't get one of those tasting great, then Cheescake Factory will only be for Soup & Cheescake for this family."
Tom W.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,65,2,3.0,8/21/2010,Overdone and half baked concept food fare fosters a large belly with a check of equal size for what is now average food at a big box food factory. Far too dark at night - Just get dessert and head for the hills.
Russell A.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,8,5,4.0,3/7/2010,"Some people go here just for the dessert and I cant blame them. ADAMS PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE was honestly a harmonious blend of peanut butter and chocolate. Neither too strong or too soft, just good.  That's what we ate the next day. At home. Because I couldn't bring myself to even attempt the cheesecake, after the buffet we had at the restaurant.  We went unannounced on Valentine's night. The wait was an hour which was understandable.  AVOCADO EGG ROLLS and FRIED MACARONI & CHEESE.  Sound like a lot? No, me either, but I couldn't finish my meal. So I guess it was. We really underestimated those appetizers, because I'm dumb. And honestly that could've been our meal. And I don't why but I keep trying to find a suitable mac and cheese, but I guess I just like it simple. Because anything too fancy just doesn't do it. For me. CAJUN PASTA JAMBALAYA  was the dish across, and the SHRIMP SCAMPI & SALMON was the dish in front. Of me that is.  I know what shrimp and salmon taste like, but That salmon was perfect. Enough for me to mention it again here, I was just pleasantly surprised. Even with how full I was, I dominated that thing. Like a duck. (No chewing) If you've never been, then you should, at least once. It's one of those places that you wish you could call it you're favorite restaurant (because of the decor, the ambiance, the food) but then you see the people you're eating around with, because you decided not to get a booth. And sad face.  But it stills bare mention though, it's just not a place you want to go all the time. Just once in awhile."
Jamie T.,"Henderson, NV",298,7,,1.0,6/9/2013,"The only reason why I put one star is because the cheesecake is phenomenal. Me and my bf dined there one night he got the mac n cheese burger and I got like a western one , our server I think her name was Amanda talk blonde girl , never checked up on us and I watched every one else that was sat after us get there food and we sat for about 2 more hours with no food other parties that were there after us left already , then one guy comes up to us apologizing about the food delay , and that he would take care of it , well then the food came and finally.our server comes back apologizing for it taking forever , well the burgers were gross over Cooked, Mac n cheese was dry with rubbery noodles , we didn't even finish it , then we get the bill and we got no discount no nothing , they didn't take care of us at all , we paid the bill and left and will never be dining in there again ever just going in to get  cheesecake to go for now on. The only thing good there is the cheesecake , poor poor poor service"
La D.,"Henderson, NV",0,20,,4.0,7/30/2013,go for happy hour!  Full size app portions for less than 1/2 off. Assorted cocktails and specific wines also reduced.  Was pleasantly surprised by quality of the food as well.
Joanna F.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,30,79,1.0,5/4/2012,"I've been here 3 times before this last time. On August of 2011 I went to Cheesecake Factory with my family for my mother birthday (10) people. I understand that this place does get busy and there was going to be a wait. So they told us it'll be a hour wait which we were fine with. An hour past we still waited 2 hours are creeping by so we ask if our table was ready, no not yet. Still waiting and now 5 kids are getting inpatient and crying they are hungry. Now Im getting upset and whats taking so long to get a table. It seem as if they didn't care I had to ask for a manager to get anything done. The manager did try to make the situation better by comp some food but the damage was done for a 2 hrs and so wait. I with to order a cheesecake for my mother and some man that work there made a comment that I had to pay for that. I just brush it off and reply I know that. I will never return to this or any cheesecake factory. The service was bad and made to feel as dirt."
Kate W.,"Henderson, NV",11,8,5,4.0,11/20/2010,"Get yourself a Peach Bellini while waiting for the avacado eggrolls, so good!"
Hilaree B.,"Henderson, NV",2,12,,5.0,12/14/2012,"We visited Cheesecake factory for take out tonight. Isabel was so kind and accommodating! I had my baby in my arms and she promptly took my order and my food was ready in minutes. She walked around the corner and said, ""let me walk you to your car, clearly your hands are full."" It was pouring outside and she went above and beyond to help a mom. I appreciate the over the top customer service and will return. Thank you!"
Iven S.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,40,,4.0,10/9/2010,great for a midweek brunch treat. Nice location. did not appreciate that my waitress DID NOT tell me that cranberry is not part of the kids' meals options and costs an extra 3.00 a glass.
Dave D.,"Oakland, CA",47,192,,5.0,9/20/2009,"OMG I am in food coma still!  The service is great, the food wonderful and the dessert to die for!"
mvc j.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,145,,2.0,3/4/2010,"I can see how this would be a very popular restaurant - nice bar, large menu with lots of options and good cheesecake. My experience has been that the cheesecake here is good for dessert.  Fresh, well made, lots of options and flavors, etc.... Bar is good too with good beer and drink options (Fat Tire on tap is always a plus). Overall design of the restaurant is pleasant, albeit a bit loud due to very high ceilings. I just always find the menu, which is very large and varied in options and cuisine types, to be very middle of the road for the actual food.  Maybe because this restaurant tries to offer something for everybody - in my opinon, it results in lighty seasoned food (in large portions, in my opinion, that is not objectionable to anyone but just not that interesting. I did want to really like this restaurant (not typically a huge chain fan, but really like The District and all it offers), but based on my few visits here, I would have a drink or dessert here, but find the main meal options lacking."
Scott E.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,4,,4.0,10/24/2012,"We don't go here a ton but it is an every other month restaurant for us. Typically I can't finish my entire meal as the portions are huge and if I want cheesecake then I have to save room. The service is typically adequate to very good, but compared to the Plaza branch I'm used to in KC, MO it is missing a little bit of charm.  A few things I was very happy to see on this trip (October) were firstly a very expansive healthy menu that filled all of mine and my wife's needs and secondly a new cheesecake that was made to have hints of pumpkin pie. Both were welcome additions and both were full of very tasty bites!!  Things that would make this a more regular trip to me and my wife....more draft beer choices and super cold iced draw glasses, and lastly more intimate seating."
Jeff L.,"San Bruno, CA",2,91,,4.0,4/16/2008,"Yep it's a Cheesecake Factory alright.  Giant portions, decent food, standard upper-middle tier chain type prices. Expect to have enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Nothing is out of the ordinary for this this Cheesecake Factory. The wait staff is friendly, the building is huge and they have a lot of outdoor seating. It was very nice and a mildly breezy spring evening.  They have advertisements in the menu as if it were a magazine. I'm not offended by it, I just thought it was odd."
