Michael P.,"Las Vegas, NV",185,342,143,4.0,11/3/2009,Cheesecake factory is a great consistant chain. From Summerlin to Ceasars to Henderson this chain delivers on a diverse menu with great flavor and a very upscale setting for a very pratical price.
Stacy K.,"Henderson, NV",6,6,1,5.0,8/12/2010,I work.around the corner from here so when I get off every so often I stop by for lunch. I just ate here again yesterday. I love all their food! Make sure to try the mahi mahi! Its the bomb!
Jaymee L.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,77,9,4.0,6/29/2009,I love Cheesecake Factory period but The District location is my ultimate fave in Vegas.
Ann B.,"Vancouver, WA",98,138,,4.0,7/3/2008,"I ate too much.  But then again, that's why I love this place.  I've now been to about 6 different locations, and by far the service here is the best.  My food was fully cooked (which isn't always the case at other locations), we only waited 15 minutes (unheard of!), and the waitress was friendly and attentive.  As the Cheesecake Factory goes, you can't ask for anything more!"
Sterling H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/1/2011,The service was very slow at 10pm. The waitress was lost thence found her.  Great food when it arrived. I almost forgot I ordered
April C.,"Henderson, NV",17,1,,4.0,7/15/2011,"Food has very nice presentation, not just thrown together.  Staff if friendly and thorough, atmosphere makes you feel as though you're on vacation even if you're a local.  The Navajo sandwich fry- bread is as close to pow-wow fresh as you can get, and the Mai-tais are super smooth (dangerous!)  Will def come here again."
clifford c.,"Henderson, NV",6,51,3,5.0,12/1/2009,"My wife and i like this place But the prices is to much for the food we're paying for. The icetea yummy, service is very good and well trained."
Daniella S.,"Austin, TX",31,66,10,3.0,6/3/2008,"It is what it is.  I like the patio at this location.  We go every so often when we don't know what we want because the menu is huge & has something for everyone.  The waitstaff is fine.  Some are stars, some not so much.  I never leave saying wow that was great, but it fills the void in my stomach in a manufactured, corporate kind of way..."
