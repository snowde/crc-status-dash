Sam M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",10,39,8,5.0,1/7/2017,"We stopped here for desserts on Saturday, our server Robert was very nice and polite. The Caramel Pecan turtle and the Ultimate Red Velvet tasted just excellent. Will be back when we are in Vegas."
Kara L.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,16,,5.0,6/10/2017,"A great classic American fusion style of food! My boyfriend and I go here all the time and always have great, fast service and food! I love their pastas and appetizers and my boyfriend loves their steaks! So far never had a bad experience at this location. The food prices are fair and decent portioned, clean restrooms is a plus!  When coming on the weekends though, make sure to come 30 minutes-1 hour earlier than when you normally eat because this place is hopping with people and the wait can be taxing to those who are impatient.  Try the Avocado Spring Rolls! (Make sure to ask for two sauces not one, it's super delicious!)"
Makena M.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,3,1,2.0,12/12/2017,"i rarely ever take the time to write reviews, but this experience was so bad. i came here with my mom, grandparents & bf. i came here to celebrate dinner after i graduated cosmetology school. the only reason why i come here is for the french dip which i noticed they took off the menu so i asked our waitress, DEE, about it. she has the most ugly attitude and a horrible personality. she was RUDE every chance she got, making snide remarks like ""oh i'll just reach over all of you to grab this one plate"", throwing the bags for our boxes AT us. she was the most unpleasant person to be around, i almost asked for the manager and for a new waitress. If any of you get Dee as your next waitress, immediately ask for someone else. her attitude ruined my whole dinner. at least my food was good."
Bianca P.,"Henderson, NV",36,4,,3.0,10/14/2017,"Decided to come to Cheesecake Factory with the family to celebrate my bday. It was busy so I get why the hostess forgot to give us a pager. Fortunately we were able to be seated within 20 min after checking in twice to make sure we weren't called. I'm grateful they turned down the music cause I couldnt hear my family speaking. We ordered egg roll and calamari and the sauce was amazing with it. We ordered fettuccini, kids pizza, pork chop and veggie burger. All of which was just okay. Fettuccini was bland. Pizza did not have enough sauce, pork chop was overpowered by the Apple sauce. Veggie burger was different from last time where it consisted of beets while this time it was beans and brown rice. The server was under the weather and very curt but still friendly. Over all it was okay. Not a place I would go often but maybe once or twice year."
Gavriel M.,"Austin, TX",330,76,25,4.0,9/1/2017,For a chain this place is kinda amazing. So many options and even the specials are usually good. If you can't find something here to like them you are probably a terrorist
Adam B.,"Henderson, NV",22,40,56,5.0,2/13/2017,"HOLY MOLY - Sunday Brunch was so delicious yesterday!  The lemon ricotta pancakes were some of the best we've had in quite some time.  My lovely partner has been jonesing for those for quite some time and we finally found the scratch for her itch.  My spinach, bacon and roasted tomato eggs benedict was very tasty - nothing too out there but overly enjoyable. The munchkin went with fried calamari for an appetizer (shared by all, though we couldn't finish it - soooo big!) and then had the bacon bacon burger (sans cheese or sauce).  The bacon on this burger, though - TO. DIE. FOR.  I'm totally going back to the Cheesecake Factory soon JUST for that burger.  With cheese.  And sauce.  Because that's how I live."
Krys G.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,59,65,5.0,5/11/2017,Every thing was delicious. Only problem is my salmon had a few thin bones in it  and the wait a a little ridiculous. I will come back.
Nicole F.,"Las Vegas, NV",117,341,1446,2.0,8/13/2016,"Let me start by saying the food was amazing. It's always good here and we been here a few times. But today, the service wasn't that great.  Our server was Jessica F. She had no personality, no greeting and didn't smile. We had to keep asking her for refills, asked for bread, extra plates etc. after a few times it started to get ridiculous.  My family and I will be back, but we'll make sure not to get seated in her section."
Thomas Y.,"Henderson, NV",41,7,9,4.0,5/21/2017,Very good food and service. Good portions. The bread is great always refilling drinks without needing to ask. Would give 5 stars but my red velvet cheesecake tasted a bit stale for whatever reason.
Angelica C.,"Las Vegas, NV",134,11,3,5.0,8/19/2017,"Server Jessica was amazing! The place was packed, but we got lucky with self seating high-top tables. Because it was so busy, the bar was backed up. However, the cucumber mojito was well worth the wait. For an entree I got the parmesan herb chicken. It was *Donald Trump voice*  HUUUUGEEE and excellent. I will definitely be coming back!"
Melody M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,9/18/2017,"This place is awesome! Have not had a bad experience here yet. I come here with my friends all the time. The prices are really reasonable . For about $32 I got the fried macaroni balls , chicken picata  and a chocolate cake. The portions are huge. I always have so much left overs.The chicken Picata is always on point . Very moist, tasty, fresh, and hot. The servers are always very friendly also. They always made sure I was ok and filled my drinks on a timely manner. This is always my go to place when you family comes to visit. Highly recommended."
Brandon J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,19,16,5.0,7/12/2017,"Came here last month on the 26th a few hours before closing just supposing to grab a quick bite before we head in for the night and we were very glad we did! To start our server Clayton was Fantastic! A seasoned waiter who knew exactly when to stop in when we needed something, Great demeanor and Very friendly (sadly a quality missing among some wait staff in many establishments today).        The drinks were great! If you are a Bourbon fan make sure you try their Bourbon & Honey cocktail along with their Sausage and Ricotta flatbread (two of our favorites after many visits to the Cheesecake).       Most menu items are a generous portion, always food leftover to take home or share. Enjoyable atmosphere and beautiful designs inside restaurant itself, good place for a night out or casual date night! Cheesecake Factory is definitely a higher end casual establishment in which you will not regret paying a visit!"
Don G.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,37,3,5.0,8/17/2017,This Cheesecake factory location is worth the extra drive. The servers are very courteous and attentive. No long waits like strip location. Make sure to save room for the ultimate red velvet cheesecake.
Lauren C.,"Henderson, NV",284,981,2576,4.0,1/3/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains that I not only like, but I think is pretty good. This location is conveniently located inside The District. It's on the opposite side from most of the shopping so parking is easy. Just like most of their locations they have an enormous amount of seating and outdoor seating as well. The patio is a nice option when the weather is nice. The menu has a large amount of options and a large variety of options as well. There should be something here to please everyone. I like that a group could come in and order completely different foods. Surprisingly, everything I've had is really good. They are one of the few places that can pull off a large menu without sacrificing taste. The portions are always big enough to make into two meals. I love fun lunch leftovers. This is one of the few restaurants that make it easy for someone on a diet if you aren't looking to treat yourself. The Skinnylicious menu has some great options and the calories are listed on the menu. They couldn't make it easier for someone counting calories. The cheesecake lives up to the hype and just like the regular menu there are a ridiculous amount of options. My favorite is the Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake.  Pricing is reasonable for the portion sizes. As I mentioned, most entrees are big enough to be two or three servings for the average person. I've been to this location many times and service has always been great. Despite the fact that they are always busy it never takes long to get food and drinks are refilled promptly."
Denise P.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",45,116,2,1.0,3/15/2017,"Can't really review the food, but the hostesses in the two nights we TRIED to go hear were awful!! First time didn't expect an hour wait & the hostesses were not polite about the wait.   The second time we expected to wait an hour for a table, not wait an hour to talk to a hostess.  When we approached the hostess stand to put our name down, 3 young ladies standing there , 2 doing nothing.   I asked one girl (that was not doing anything) how long the wait was, she pointed to the girl doing something, and said ask her.  I tried multiple times to ask the other girl, but she ignored me.  Even when she was doing nothing she continued to ignore.  We left the second time & debating if there will ever be a third.  Did finally make it back, but doubt a return.  $150 for 5 people for burgers & 3 pieces of OK cheesecake.  No alcohol!  Food was ok, great service though. Not worth the hassle for the $$"
Arthur M.,"Henderson, NV",103,451,1748,3.0,6/9/2016,"We usually make it here at least a couple of times a year. This time, we were influenced by $50 in gift cards to dine on a Wednesday night around 7:30. Our party of seven waited about 15 minutes outside before we were greeted by our server who was kind enough to come outside and lead us inside to our table. The menu can be overwelming with endless choices. But that is good for our group which has a pretty wide spectrum of preferences. There hasn't been too many changes to the menu over the years with the small plates and Skinnylicious options being the most recent to me. For the rookies, don't go hog wild on the bread, because you won't be able to finish your three-serving portion entree. Our order was pretty varied which included two entree salads, three sandwiches, a pasta dish, and the filet medallion off the Skinnylicious menu for me. There was plenty of ""filler"" vegetables and not a lot of beef for my entree as expected, but the vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The pasta dishes have never really impressed me, but the salads are surprisingly good. If I don't get a steak dish, I'll usually get the tuna tataki salad which is a very flavorful salad. Everyone was happy with their meals with over half us needing take out boxes. We finished with two pieces of cheesecake. Over time, I've found that I prefer cheesecakes without any cake mixed in like the fresh strawberry, banana cream, and salted caramel. I do have to comment on our server who left a good first impression by greeting us outside, but everything else really wasn't up to par. To add to the rehearsed, corny jokes where the response was crickets chirping after each one, he had no organization of our orders. Stating that I was seat 1 when taking drink orders and my daughter was seat 7 sitting across from me at the end of the table, he had no clue who drank what when he brought the drinks out, auctioning each one and running back and forth across the table. He forgot my mother and wife's glasses of wine, didn't notice they were without beverage after three return trips to the table, and he had to be reminded by me to grab them at the bar after 15 minutes. Then he did the always annoying checking every three minutes if I had signed the receipt after he ran my credit card. Which meant he was cut and wanting to bolt, but you don't want to perturb the person that is signing off on your tip. Before gift cards were discounted, our check was a reasonable $163. What you'll get with Cheesecake Factory, as you will with other successful chains, is consistency. They need that consistency to handle the amount of volume that comes through the doors. The food and atmosphere in this location are also consistent with every other restaurant. The changing variable is the service, which is usually a hit. It comes down to whether you think that consistency is good, and I would tend to agree with most Yelpers that it is A-OK."
Cindylou Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,23,42,5.0,2/26/2017,"We had such a great experience here. We were seated in a comfortable booth near a window to look out of. Ambiance was very nice and food was very delicious. I highly recommend the peach smoothie! It was so tasty and refreshing. What made our dining experience special was the amazing service. Chris Newman was our server and he was able to recommend us items from the menu, made sure we always had everything we needed, and overall had a warm energy about him. Overall great experience at this location!"
Steve H.,"Henderson, NV",39,95,37,5.0,3/7/2017,L)Amazing that I have passed this restaurant ten thousand million time as its about 2 miles from my home. Well I was invited to a business lunch on Sat at noon....not a good time or day as this very large restaurant was crowded to the rim. Surprised at the great service. There is something for everyone on their giant menu. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. While is was super sized the quality was not up to pare. The  Cuban cafe off of the 215 and Eastern has the real deal. The other 5 guests all enjoyed their fare. The selections of cheese cakes were amazing and New York quality. My choice of the 2 chocolate Hershey was over the top. 5 stars and 5 million calories.The only downside was that prices tended to be somewhat higher then other similar fair
Kimora R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,45,5.0,3/30/2017,The desserts were soo yummi!!!! We had carrot cake and red velvet cheesecake! Definitely coming back!!  Our waiter was soo friendly and attentive!
Tara J.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,101,40,1.0,7/30/2016,"I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory location many times and have never had an issue with the service or food previously. However, I had an awful experience today that warrants a one star rating.  In honor of national cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory is offering half price cheesecake. What a deal! And it is. But who knew that you'd have to deal with snotty, rude and unprofessional employees in order to get your piece of the pie, or cheesecake, in this instance?  So I go in and it's busy. Like really, really busy. And of course it is! The best cheesecake on planet earth is half off! I go right to the counter line and after waiting for about 5 minutes (which was actually quicker than I thought it would be considering how busy they were) I got to the counter and get not so much as a hello, hi, what can I get for you? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Just a girl staring at me waiting for me to place my order. Ok-they're busy and she's probably stressed. I get that. No biggie.  I requested 4 pieces of cheesecake - 2 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. Alas, I was informed that it's only 1 piece half off per person. Since I'm there by myself, I'm basically only able to get 1 piece at the discount and the rest will be full price. No problem - it makes sense to put a cap on it so that people don't go crazy. I decide that I don't want to pay full price for 3 pieces and adjust my order to remove the salted caramel and just ordered 2 Reece's and 1 snickers.  I pay and even leave a small tip ($3) in the tip cup. I walk away from the counter and a couple minutes later she calls me back to get my cheesecake. I look in the bag and unfortunately there's 1 Reece's, 1 snickers and 1 salted caramel. NOT what I'd ordered, paid and even TIPPED for! This, my cheesecake loving friends, is how the rest of my visit went - verbatim: Me: Oh shoot, I didn't want the salted caramel. That was the one I cancelled.  Her: So what do you want then? Me: 2 Reece's and 1 snickers. I'm sorry.  * At this point she ROLLS HER EYES and SHAKES HER HEAD, takes out the salted caramel and walks away. I am so disappointed and feel like I'm putting her out when in all actuality, it was HER that made the mistake and ME that was being apologetic about it. Huh? * Me: (out loud and to no one in particular) Not sure what that attitude is all about.  The manager is standing there and overheard my comment and this is how the remainder of my visit went, again verbatim: Manager: Well you know what it is, ma'am? We're not even supposed to be doing this.  Me: You're not supposed to be doing what? Manager: Giving half price for take out orders. We're actually only supposed to be honoring it for dine in customers.  Me: Well I certainly appreciate that you're honoring it but I don't think the attitude that comes along with it is necessary.  And at that point I got my CORRECT cheesecake and walked out.  It's unfortunate that the manager chose to defend his employee ROLLING HER EYES and SHAKING HER HEAD at me rather than apologize for her completely unprofessional and unjustified behavior. Like I said, I get that they're busy. I understand that it's a stressful job. And I definitely appreciate that they honored the discounted price when, apparently, they didn't have to. But as a customer, I should not be treated that way, especially when the mistake wasn't mine and I was kind and gracious even when she made the mistake.  Shame on this employee and shame on this manager (both whose names I didn't get, dang it). Hopefully their attitudes improve-for the sake of other customers who don't deserve to be treated so poorly."
