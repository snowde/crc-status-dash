Christopher L.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,5,2,5.0,8/20/2017,"My family and I have been coming to this place for years, and for good reason! It is always packed because of the popularity but with the efficiency of the staff, they never have you waiting for too long. This time we had Gary as our server. Gary was very kind, funny and very engaging. My fiancé didn't know what kind of cocktail to have and he recommended a Georgia Peach cocktail which is pretty much now her favorite drink. The food came fast, drinks and service was spot on, and we ended the night with of course, their notorious cheesecakes. Always a fantastic place to go for any occasion!"
May P.,"Lynnwood, WA",3,5,,5.0,8/16/2017,"My husband and I highly recommend THIS Cheesecake Factory in Henderson, N.V.!! First of all, there is plenty of parking to be found and the area is very scenic as well! Now, onto the good stuff......The menu options and the customer service that we received from Terry Cola and Staff was OUTSTANDING!! You will be treated 'like royalty' here and the food is super-fresh (gotta try those Summer Shrimp Spring Rolls while they last!!) and the Cob Salad we had filled me up (and that's not easy to do since I have a big appetite and love to chow down!). Do yourself a favor....If you find yourself hungry in Henderson, stop on into the Cheesecake Factory for Lunch/Dinner! You will not be disappointed!!"
Michel T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Party of 10 , we were told wait is 45 minute ... after waiting for an hour and a half we were told by the manager that they are still waiting for 3 guests to leave in order to use their table. These guests have already finished eating, bill paid and table cleaned. They are just sitting there talking. We asked the manager to get us another table, he said no We asked him to move these guests to another table so they can continue talking and we can have our meal, he said no  We asked him to inform them that we are waiting, he said no After Waiting for 2 hours and no table , we left  Not sure who's at fault here, Cheesecake Factory for not training their manager or the manager himself for having no clue how to run a restaurant  Either way they lost a regular customer."
Sam D.,"Port Hacking, Australia",0,1,,1.0,11/13/2017,"This was the worst Cheesecake Factory experience of all time, mind you have visited many Cheesecake Factory locations across the country. Waiter couldn't be less interested, asked if I was ready to order just after I sat down, no bread was offered or provided all other tables had bread, no drink refill was offered either until check was brought to table. When I quizzed the waiter about the service he said he didn't know why no bread was offered, even though I saw him deliver bread to other tales."
Christian O.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,3/31/2017,"Came here for a lunch/dinner with my family. We were sat right away. Hostess were friendly and welcoming.  Our sever was Sarah J. And she was awesome. We were also being helped by a guy but we didn't catch his name. They were both really attentive, and took great care of us. They even brought out some bread with slices of bananas for our baby. The food was delicious!! I had the chicken piccata (I think that's what it was called) and I highly recommend it! Amazing!"
Karen M.,"Henderson, NV",88,28,5,5.0,7/22/2017,We had a great little family dinner last night! All of our food and drinks was fantastic but the best part was our server Rami!! He was so attentive and sweet and our son loved him!! Great job! We'll be back soon!
Ryo Hanalei Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",401,179,1405,5.0,5/23/2016,"It's been about 4 years Zapponians and myself have come here to team build - and it wasn't a disappointment! From the time we were brought to our table to the time we left, everything was a great experience! Tiffany, our waitress deserves a special shout out for being so attentive to our group! Every time I eat at a Cheesecake Factory, I typically order the same food dishes, starting off with the avocado egg rolls with the sweet cilantro dressing. If you've never had these, definitely order them as a starter! Ah - Maze - Zing! I'm also a burger lover and saw the Mac n cheese burger!? What?! My two favorites put into a burger! Now, I'll be honest, it was delicious to have Lk that extra cheese, I wish the fried Mac n cheese had more of a crunch. I feel the cheese sauce doused that crunch one would want for texture contrast. Minor detail, it was cheesy, beefy, and the sweet potato fries were delicious! With the amazing portions that you are served, you have to remember to leave room for dessert! To top off such an epic meal, a slice of salted caramel cheesecake is always a great closer! If you're in Henderson and want something to relieve that ""hangry"" pain, come here and spend time with the fam bam or your crew! They've got something for you! :)"
Janet M.,"Burbank, CA",43,209,49,4.0,11/19/2016,"Just like with all cheesecake factory, prepare to wait a LONG time to be seated and to actually eat. We were there with a large party to celebrate my uncle's bday. It doesnt make any sense for restaurants not to take in reservation on weekends for large party. Anyway we got there a little after 6pm and waited an hour to be seated. Once seated, we waited another 30mins or maybe more to get our food. Kudos to our server for (1) getting all 12 orders right and (2) providing excellent service to all of us.   I can't complain about our food as we all liked our food."
Jud B.,"Saint George, UT",0,5,,1.0,8/5/2017,"The cheesecake is wonderful but the service was incredibly slow. We waited at least 15 minutes to get drinks and bread at the beginning and then we got half of our meals after what seemed like a pretty long wait. It took another ten minutes to get two more plates delivered. The final plate, however didn't arrive at our table until after we'd all finished eating. The manager did comp the seriously late plate, and it's easy to forgive a missed order but the overall slowness of the servers leads me to leave this one star review."
Fuchsia Y.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",2,10,8,5.0,7/6/2017,I order take out from here at least once a week. The cashiers are always so sweet and friendly both on the phone and in person. I also love the variety of the menu and consistency of the food I order.
Allen S.,"Henderson, NV",337,97,251,4.0,9/22/2016,"I like coming here between lunch and dinner rush. You usually get seated pretty quickly. I've been here several times and the servers have always been friendly. The food always comes out the way it should, but there seems to be some consistency issues as far as how often the servers check up on you. Some seem to just disappear for a while and you end up flagging down the next one you see to get a refill.  Not a deal breaker for me but I don't like troubling someone else's server. I give this place a 4 for food value and service."
Steven H.,"Henderson, NV",85,297,887,4.0,6/25/2015,"Hungry, but don't know what you want? They have it here! The Cheesecake Factory has an enormous menu with every type of food you could crave. The service here is pretty consistent but there can be very long waits when it's busy.  Some of my favorites are the factory chopped salad, fish tacos, chicken and garlic pasta and the avocado eggrolls which I've never seen anywhere else. The food is always good and usually comes out quickly, even when they are busy. Of course I can't come here without getting a piece of cheesecake. The red velvet is delicious, loaded with cream cheese. I also like the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake. It's one of my new favorites. For being a chain restaurant the Cheesecake Factory delivers a great experience with good service and a wonderful selection of food."
Yuqi J.,"Las Vegas, NV",124,90,18,2.0,6/5/2017,"The 2-star is for their food, not their service. I don't have much to complain about the service, this is not fine dining so you def shouldn't expect a fine dining experience... I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan since I was 18... I'm so familiar with their menu and how the food should taste because I always order the same things every time. I ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane today as usual, the presentation was horrible. Steak was over cooked and fries were soggy. I've never been disappointed in my food in CCF but today was a first. I don't recommend coming here, maybe try a different location."
Nick D.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",1,17,4,3.0,10/24/2016,"The food is good, the service was excellent (thanks Bernardo) but they are so disorganized at the front door it's not worth going to this location when they are busy. We got there early 6pm but I'm warning you, if you see a line, get back on Yelp and find another place to go or commit yourself to waiting double or triple the time they tell you. Some may think the food is worth the wait, but it's Las Vegas- there are many, many restaurants to choose from.  Everyone in my party complained about the lighting and I noticed people at other tables using their cellphone lights to read the menu. The general experience was so annoying we took our cheesecake home. We had someone in town and I regret spending two hours there. Our server was so good it probably deserves another star, but the first impression really ruined it for me."
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",904,19,123,5.0,2/23/2017,"Best restaurant in Henderson. Consistent food and friendly service. Pro tip - open seating at the. At when it is busy. Love the brown bread, ask for the BBQ ranch to dip your bread in. You won't be sorry!"
Keith R.,"Las Vegas, NV",41,32,1,3.0,11/27/2016,"Good place, if you're a tourist.  I wanted to like this place better but it's just typical corporate.  Yeah food is good, you won't go wrong but - I will say this. They really should lessen the menu. It's overbearing to look through 50-60-70 things.  A great restaurant offers less but greater value.  Of course the cheesecake is good. But nothing beats grandmas.  I'll pass next time."
Red S.,"Henderson, NV",16,20,14,5.0,6/30/2017,We live down the street and come here often. Always love the food. Service is sometimes good. Sometimes great. The other night GREAT. Our server was David L. We've never been served by him before. I myself am a server and I take pride in providing great service. He was very prompt and polite. And his order timing was perfect. I accidentally spilled a few drops of sauce on my shirt and used my napkin with water to get it off. Before I know it he pops around the corner with some soda water for me. Wonderful. I will be sure to ask for him next time we go.
Misty B.,"Henderson, NV",49,2,,5.0,7/26/2017,Came in to get a whole cheesecake to go for the husband's birthday- our favorite! Bakery staff was extremely helpful and nice. Didn't discover until after we got home that we got the wrong cheesecake- one we haven't had before. It's too far out of the way to return and we haven't not liked a flavor before so we decided to try it- delicious!!!!
Miranda S.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,38,11,5.0,6/16/2017,"Totally blown away by the amazing customer service our extremely large party of 25 received from David L. and Dante W. They were spot on with the orders, extremely friendly and professional. They totally rocked as a team and made our dinner go by flawlessly. Well done!"
Lili K.,"Henderson, NV",103,28,19,5.0,9/4/2016,"Called last Thursday a To-Go Curbside order. The man who took my order was very cordial, let me know they had gotten pretty busy already. I got to the parking lot and the curbside attendant was getting someone's card and before I could even call them she came to my car for my payment because she already knew my order was packed up. Prompt polite service, food was delicious, and will be back to try a different cheesecake this week! (: Also I am kind of a salad freak- many places like Olive Garden and Chili's have that out-of-a-can dressing taste where there's either not enough or too much but CF has their Caesar salad down PERFECTLY. I'm not even a crouton person but whatever they use is amazing."
