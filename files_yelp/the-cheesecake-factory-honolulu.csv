Olivia P.,"Honolulu, HI",212,21,27,4.0,1/8/2018,"I love cheesecake factory. My friends and I come at least once a month. Today however, I came with my family to celebrate my brothers birthday.  Located right in Waikiki at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, this place isn't hard to find. Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian parking structure and the restaurant validates for you. The first 2 hours with validation is free.  We went around 3:30 so we were able to get  seated right away. I think anytime before 5pm is a good time to go. Anytime after that, the wait jumps to over an hour long. We ordered the crab & artichoke dip as our appetizer. It was so good that it disappeared way too fast. They give a pretty good portion size of the dip as well. For our entrees we ordered the farfalle chicken pasta, chipotle chicken sandwich, a burger, and a soup & salad lunch combo. Everything tasted great!  The minus 1 star is for the priceyness of this place. It's a little on the pricier side. Nonetheless, I enjoy the food here. Definitely one of my go-to places to eat."
David C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12,3,1,5.0,1/7/2018,This is a sensational location for dinner. Meals are HUGE and the desserts are awesome - best cheesecake on the planet You have to wait to get a table almost all of the time but it is worth it.
Lori Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",285,36,74,3.0,1/5/2018,"Would give a 3 1/2. It's extremely busy. 50 minutes wait, then another 10 to get seated. The check-in process can be improved. As the entrance is blocked with people waiting to get a pager; then the other side of the desk is crowded with people waiting to be seated.  Due to the great weather, outdoor seating is wonderful, especially when it's cool out with a light breeze.  It was Friday night, so live music was a bonus."
David T.,"Honolulu, HI",277,246,1907,3.0,12/27/2017,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory with friends on Christmas afternoon.  It was crowded and the wait was about an hour as we had expected. I decided on the Green Chicaquilles with pork.  They were good and the sauce flavorful. The plate was huge and was more than i could finish after having bread and butter while we waited for our orders. Everyone enjoyed their meal, however, there is some strange system of how they service a table by using multiple waiters.  We did have a large table, but we were never sure who was going to do what at the table. There were several order mistakes and some new person would show up and find that there was a problem, just to be followed by another person bring out the same mistaken dish again. Once our meal was finished, one got their checks right away, others had to wait 30 plus minutes before they could get someone to bring their check. I'm sure there is a method to the madness but we couldn't figure it out and neither could the waitstaff."
Jason G.,"Pasadena, CA",4426,2425,5439,3.0,12/24/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu, which at some point you have to wonder how they can prepare so many different things and keep all the required food or ingredients fresh. However, their cheesecake is very yummy."
Bryan W.,"Kaneohe, HI",32,88,1276,4.0,12/18/2017,"Timing is everything here. We came for a late lunch on Sunday and we were lucky that there was no line and no waiting.   Since we are trying to eat more veggies, this is a good place to go. There are a lot of salads here and some vegan choices as well. Our order arrived very quickly.  They were very tasty and the huge portions makes for a very satisfying lunch. Our waitress Beth was excellent.  The only problem is that their complimentary bread is so delicious!  We couldn't resist when it was offered. Definitely a place to go for great salads."
Jo-Anne S.,"Kaneohe, HI",10,179,169,3.0,12/17/2017,"We went to Cheesecake Factory today to celebrate my birthday. I'm not sure if this place is made for locals since it's in the heart of Waikiki. Most of the patrons are tourists, so locals like myself don't blend in.  We arrived at noon with amazing very little wait. Our server, was little disappointing. His name was Joe. He just took our order, refilled our drinks once, checked on us once maybe and handed us our check. I've seen other waitresses offering better service to the other tables.  Oh well, at least I got to eat my fave, the crispy won ton crab. We also ordered the everything pizza with salad and surprising the pizza was great! No room for cheesecake, but took one home. The original cheesecake, awesome! Will be back for more!  For the waiter, maybe a little more customer service skills.  Updated review:  service on Dec 16, 2017 I seem to find that the earlier you go to Cheesecake Factory, the better it is. There is no wait to be seated., but we did get seated all the way in the back and the tables are stacked so close together that it makes it feel Pretty darn uncomfortable like you are joining the table next to you!  Once again, our server as the greatest, but do-able.  And I'm not sure why, why in the world they took off my crispy crab won ton off the menu!!!! Oh gee!  I'm not sure if cheesecake is still a 3-Star!"
Nalani G.,"Honolulu, HI",516,150,897,5.0,11/20/2017,I can't believe that I've never written a review for this place. Well I'm definitely a creature of habit and I always get the Thai Lettuce Wraps! They are delicious and the serving is great for sharing or for taking the rest home for dinner. The staff is always friendly even though you can tell that they are always busy.  I really need to save room for dessert or just go there for cheesecake sometime! Maybe next time I'll try their new location.
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",218,288,1112,5.0,11/3/2017,"Did you know that if you shop & dine (sit down restaurant only, sorry food court) at the Royal Hawaiian Center and then take receipts to the information center to show them to get a ticket so that parking is only $8 for 5 hours. This is a great deal for parades and events going on in Waikīkī. That being said. FOOD: The Fresh Grilled Salmon was cooked to perfection, nicely grilled while still moist on the inside. The Factory Burger had a nice char to it on the outside while also being moist and juicy on the inside, the Sourdough French really went will with burger holding up to the juices from it. SERVICE: Great service!! Even though the waiter originally thought lunch ended at 4:30pm when I pointed out the menu said 5:00pm he still was able to put it in with 5minutes to spare. Our beverages were always topped off (free refills on the soda). He also checked on us several times during our meal to make sure everything was great."
April K.,"Honolulu, HI",113,112,919,4.0,9/24/2017,"Delicious food at a decent price, great service but a 1hr plus wait, lively ambience and validated parking in the heart of Waikiki is what you can expect at The Cheescake Factory. I don't know why they refuse to take reservations but that is the only thing keeping them from a five star review in my opinion.  Whenever my family has a special occasion The Cheescake Factory in Waikiki is one of our top go to places because the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you receive, plus it has to be a special occasion for me to agree on a 1hr plus wait time to eat anywhere! Every time I've come the service and food has been consistently good. Unfortunately the long wait has been consistent as well. Looking forward to the wait time shortening since a new location recently opened in Kapolei. I heard the wait over there has reached 5hrs! I don't think I'll be visiting them anytime soon.  Meanwhile I'll stick with The Cheescake Factory in Waikiki for my consistently delicious food, good service and 1hr plus wait, lol."
Bonnie A.,"Edmonton, Canada",160,444,841,2.0,12/11/2017,"This place is insanely busy, and HUGE! I can't imagine what it's like to work here. If you love the Cheesecake Factory, you'll be able to leave this location satisfied. My experience wasn't the greatest as the server input the wrong order for me, so I got my meal after my spouse was done his. Our bill was not compensated in any way, which I would expect after such a delay with my meal.  My mai tai was strong, so they aren't cheap on the booze. Overall, it's like any other Cheesecake Factory with perhaps a little hiccups in service, likely to sheer size of the place. Wow, just had to drop it down a star thanks to the lame generic response."
Marie C.,"Honolulu, HI",266,109,450,4.0,9/8/2017,"It is usually busy on the weekend, but surprisingly this past Saturday night, a few friends and I only had to wait for about an hour and 15 minutes! Pleasant surprise. After we were sat, our waitress was very prompt with out drinks. She gave us bread as well and then took our order. I ordered pasta without meat, when all of our food came out, as my husband had his flash on for Snapchat to record the well presented food that just arrived at our table waiting for fresh stinky cheese to me grated on top of it. As the flash of light went over my food I noticed little pieces of meat in my pasta. I told the man who dropped the food off that was grading the cheese and he said, Where??,"" as if I was lying or was mistaken. I know to check my food now because there has been countless times when there is meat in my food when I had already requested from the wait staff for there not to be meat in my food.  Anyhow, he took the food back, our waitress walked by and probably noticed that I did not have my food and failed to ask why. Then when they brought me a new meatless pasta, she came to our table asking why it took so long... Hm... She said very offensively that she is ""VEGAN! And it is not her fault!"" I was not blaming her. I simply stated that it had meat in my pasta.  As a result they took my food off the bill, thank you, and the food was good. No big deal. I wasn't expecting my food to be taken off. I was a little sad we didn't get a second serving of bread, but we probably didn't need it anyways.  I'd give this place 3ish stars closer to 4 so I just rounded up. Will probably be back, but won't order that pasta again."
James S.,"Ayase, Japan",1,34,21,5.0,12/22/2017,"I had the macadamia crusted ono fish with vegetables. The fish had good flavor but it was very dry. The server was extremely attentive despite how crowed it was. Immediately after my first bite he appeared out of thin air to ask how we liked it. I informed him of the lack of moisture and he immediately offered a sauce to remedy the dish. I suggested honey mustard, which sounds like an unusual combo with ginger fish but it turned out that it complimented the ginger perfectly. My lovely date had shrimp pasta which also had very good flavor. But, the highlight of the night was the red velvet cheesecake. It was well worth the wait."
Arlo G.,"Honolulu, HI",198,137,468,1.0,11/9/2017,"Hi Yelpers,     This a late post from Halloween 2017, decided to grab a drink and some food after walking the Waikiki strip and taking so many photos. So we decided to stop at Cheesecake Factory as the line was short for once. We sat at a table and moved to a bar table no boggy but if they we closing why it matter who knows lol.      And that's where it went downhill.... I won't say name just cause it was that bad but damn, she came by after a few minutes took our drink order and food order and I was first to order. She seemed nice enough or so I thought.       Let's just say in short she didn't put my order in and showed no remorse blaming me saying o asked her a quest not a statement.. question was can I get the salmon appetizer? She then told my friend that they were out of the crab artichoke dip so just get the artichoke dip as it's still a dip, and just be glad you have something! (Rude)      Then she ignored our table the rest of the night to the point where she literally walked around the section looking away from it and we had to ask silverware and water from other people as she was clearly ignore us and the other table, all they wanted to do was pay!       Needless to say I was upset at not getting any food or refill on drinks  or even water. I can understand making a mistake on an order but to be rude and ignore us was just in called for. Lastly to add insult to injury the bathrooms was disgusting!      I will never return to this location again which is a shame as I like their food and live close."
Brittney E.,"Kapolei, HI",197,62,165,4.0,9/9/2017,"I haven't been here since 2013 because the parking and the WAITING. But tonight I was actually surprise that the wait was only 40 minutes. Before it would be more than an hour till you're seated.  I do love that it's located right next to Forever 21 because that's an easy way to kill time. It definitely did because after I payed for my items our buzzer was telling us that our table was ready.  I am not a fan about the waiting to be seated part. After we turned in our buzzer we have to stand on the side and listen for our name to be called. In that corner where we're waiting  can get crowded and it's also very loud.  Our waiter's name was Austin and he was AWESOME. He's great at his job. My boyfriend and I ordered  crusted chicken Romano and I got the steak Diane with shrimp scampi combo. I was impressed how quickly our food came.  I knew ordering the cheese cake was going to be hardest part because there's so much choices! Austin recommended the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake and it was delicious. It's everything in one; chocolate, fruit, and cheesecake.  Can't wait to try the other flavors of cheese lake next time!"
Lily D.,"Honolulu, HI",114,190,564,3.0,9/5/2017,"Omg! Why is the wait here so ridiculous all the time! It's always an hour or more wait for a table even on a weekday! Your stomach will eat itself before you even get your meal. I guess if you eat at some abnormal time then you'd be lucky with no wait.  I tend to do take out more often now. They have a garage with validated parking, but the garage is so far! It's like a hike to get there and back! If you have a buddy it'll be better cause you can park on the side. I usually call it in as I'm doing my hike. Sometimes there's a wait at the cashier to pay anyway for a take out order.  Want anything extra? Like brown bread? Just ask! They'll gladly pack it up for you!! Today I was on hold for a bit but the cashier was friendly once I was able to place an order in, despite how busy they are!  You can also order a jar of dressing to go! But beware!! They're made fresh on the daily so they go bad within two days.. I mean really bad! And sour! So make sure you're willing to eat a lot of salad! Or have some kind of party! Their Caesar dressing is so good! But I can never eat that much salad in two days!"
Michael W.,"Honolulu, HI",428,285,522,5.0,11/9/2017,"You can always count on Cheesecake Factory to be packed every night of the week here in Waikiki. Wait time was about 20minutes so it wasn't that bad. Our waitress was very quick on service and friendly. Got us our drinks really fast.  I ordered this cocktail with ice cream in it. It was really good. You couldn't even taste the alcohol with the ice cream in it. The drink itself was pretty thick so it took a while to finish.  I ordered the miso salmon and it was perfect. The presentation was gorgeous! The salmon was perfectly cooked. It had a nice sweet and savory flavor and a nice flakiness to it. It was surrounded by this white sauce and some peas. The sauce was light and had a nice flavor. I couldn't tell what it was but it was good. I wish I had more peas though.  Of course, when you come here, you need to get dessert! I got the tiramisu cheesecake. It was awesome! Tasted like tiramisu and had the richness of a cheese.  The only hiccup was that they brought out the wrong pasta for my friend. A Cajun pasta instead of the Louisiana pasta. They were really nice though and came to apologize and offered a free soup or salad. They handled it well and brought it out in a reasonable time.  Definitely the best Cheesecake Factory experience I've had. Everything was spot on and efficient!"
Shewa M.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/10/2018,"We came here for dinner at around 5pm and was seated at 7pm. It took another 25 minutes to receive our food. The wait times are long, however that is expected for this location. This location is really nice and the food is great as always. Our server was very kind and attentive. The prices are fair for the amount of food given and for being in Hawaii."
Derek N.,"Honolulu, HI",87,30,84,4.0,9/4/2017,"The wait was a typical hour, even for the labor day weekend. The food was delicious as always but since it was towards the end of service, I don't feel like the server was too engaged or attentive. Me and the lady ordered the Farfalle with chicken and garlic and the Pasta Da Vinci, respectively. The Farfalle pasta was on point, the sauce was creamy and savory, and seasoned just right. The Pasta Da Vinci was alright, I feel that the sauce was to heavy on the wine side. The service was lacking. My friend Marie, is a vegetarian, but her order came with meat. The waitress was nice enough though to comp her meal. Water was refilled once, and we didn't even get a refill on bread.  Overall service put a damper on an otherwise delicious meal, put up with it if you are willing to wait. Food 5/5 Service 3/5 Overall 4/5"
Warren N.,"Honolulu, HI",107,101,109,4.0,8/2/2017,"We came here on a Wednesday to celebrate a birthday.  Food: After drooling all day over their exhaustive menu, we decided to order the avocado egg rolls (always a winner!) and I ordered the chicken and biscuits. Touted as comfort food, with the ""best"" buttermilk biscuits on the side, this dish was what I was craving. The portions of chicken, vegetables and mashed potatoes were generous, and the pan gravy was savory but not over-salted. Hints of sage and white pepper flavored the gravy nicely. But the buttermilk biscuits...? Maybe I haven't visited a lot of places in the South to know how true buttermilk biscuits should look and taste. However, I've made and had enough biscuits (just look at me) to know what I like in a good one: a crispy exterior, some layered flakiness, and some ""elevation""or height to show the baking powder and soda are doing their thing. Unfortunately, these were not the ""best."" While the exterior of these was crisp, their lack of height and rather doughy insides told me that they had wilted like a bouffant hairdo in today's high heat and humidity.  Dessert was a shock for me. Never before had I considered ordering the low carb cheesecake, but since I was full from the appetizer and entree I decided to try it. Mind you, it weighs in at around half the calories of the other cheesecakes so I was feeling quite sanctimonious... It was nice and light, almost mousse-like, with a thin walnut graham crust sweetened with Splenda. Nice! Service: Our server Brandi was awesome. She embodied friendly attentiveness. She was even sensitive to our birthday girl and asked if she wanted them to sing or not. B.G. opted for no song, but Brandi lit the candle on the cheesecake and said she'd wait to make sure B.G. made a wish. Thanks Brandi!"
Maahum J.,"Mequon, WI",0,2,1,2.0,12/31/2017,"Food was okay, just HUUUUGE portions. too big!!!! i could barely eat half of mine. the wait was so long just for some average tasting salad and chicken. i hope that they step up their game next time.. if i come back that is."
Trinity D.,"Honolulu, HI",33,68,299,4.0,10/14/2017,I love this place. They always have good consistent food and service is always great. I've only been here maybe like 5 times? I would love to come back more times but the dinner wait for this place is always 2 hours long. If you don't want to wait that long I recommend coming before dinner time for an early dinner around 5 pm. You get seated right away. And of course if you come to Cheesecake Factory you need to order their cheesecake for dessert! I'm not a Cheesecake fan but I would get the Oreo one it's so yummy. I always get the chocolate cake every time. It's really big and really chocolatey and it takes me three days to finish it but that's just me.
Irie R.,"Waipahu, HI",0,20,56,4.0,10/3/2017,"First time eating within the restaurant and ordering food.  Let's start off, We arrived unexpected to eat here, wait was only 20 minutes which was great.  We got seated maybe with in 25 minutes. Our server I wish I remember his name, he was awesome. He was on his A game. He was a pasta lover so he helped me decide what I should go for in the pasta menu.  He was honest on how certain foods would taste. He was always checking on us, seeing if we needed more water if our food was good etc.  Always we came just when the seasonal pumpkin pecan cheese cake cake out. We had a great time with great food."
Javier T.,"Honolulu, HI",3,97,75,5.0,12/14/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always great! But I won't review Cheesecakes food, or deserts, or ambiance, because it's always amazing! And love love going to cheesecake! Today I want to review the service! My family and I went to celebrate life at Cheesecake Factory, we had some gift cards lol! The young lady that served us was AMAZING! She was so helpful and so kind and attentive. I can't remember her name but she was a white girl, dirty blonde... I believe... super friendly! BEST server I have had in a LONG time!!!"
Jennifer A.,"Kailua, HI",8,15,4,2.0,12/18/2017,You guys gotta stop serving cold hard rock bread. I always have to ask for the warm whole wheat bread.
Debbie Y.,"Aiea, HI",29,17,30,4.0,10/27/2017,"Played tourist in Waikiki yesterday and walked past Cheesecake Factory right before lunch hour. No line! We got in with only a five minute wait. Service professional and friendly. Obvious that they do a good job hiring. Kale be and Quinoa salad was super fresh and tasty. My son had spaghetti and meatballs. He said it was the best one ever! Cheesecake was to die for! Yes, it's been a while since I've eaten here and I forgot just how good their cheesecake is. That's why they're called Cheesecake Factory, right? We had the oreo cheesecake and the chocolate truffle ball on the top and the huge oreo cookie was delish. Next time, though, I'm getting the classic. The cheesecake part was so ono! Hope to be back sooner than later."
Jenny N.,"Honolulu, HI",8,66,124,5.0,10/8/2017,I don't know about you guys... but The Cheesecake Factory NEVER fails... they've got a GREAT HUGE BIG selection of food! And alcohol. Haha. And endless amounts of bread! My go to menu is the farfalle roasted garlic chicken. Amazing... and my boyfriend gets the bacon bacon burger. I never finish my food. No matter how hungry I am. I always have left overs. I think it's the bread that does it. Amazing! I added menu pictures too for cheesecake. YUMMMMM!
Ann Y.,"Mililani, HI",30,62,130,4.0,7/5/2017,Their food never disappoints!  This time tried the Miso Salmon Lunch Special.  I was pleasantly surprised at the richness of the Miso flavor without it being too sweet or over powering.  And so very happy that they were able to replace the rice with a toss salad! This Cheesecake Factory is always busy and service was good considering how busy they can be.  We had to wait a while for our food and to have our drinks refilled but thankful for our friendly server.
Steven P.,"Ellisville, MO",88,44,320,3.0,6/11/2017,This cheesecake factory is always busy so make sure you plan an hour in advance. There is no reservations. The service could be better.  There is always live music which is nice.  The lighting is dim which makes for a relax feel. It's loud inside however because of the music and amount of people.  I ordered the Diane steak which is my favorite. The sauce is brown and sweet. The steak is sliced already. It comes with mash potatoes and asparagus.  I got the avocado egg roll for apps. The egg roll is crispy and taste good dipped in their homemade sauce. I always get the Oreo cheesecake for dessert to finish off the night.  Tell them it's your bday for a free icecream lol.
Jennie K.,"Washington, DC",95,263,455,2.0,3/30/2017,"I'm going to be very frank and tell you right away that 3 stars were taken away for inappropriate behavior. My server began speaking to me in a slow manner (immediately) and I know it was only due to my appearance (I'm Asian). I make this assumption, because I witnessed my server doing this to every Asian man and woman who walked in. What's even worse is that I ordered pasta as my entree and was asked if I needed chopsticks- what?  Anyways, let me start from the beginning. My bf and I came to Cheesecake Factory because the ones in California (specifically San Mateo) have been disappointing and we wanted this to be a redemption moment of some sort. We were seated immediately as it was past the lunch rush. Then comes our server being kind and racist at the same time. She slowly asked me if I wanted bread and water. At first I thought it was just her way of speaking, but it definitely wasn't. I ordered the pasta and my bf ordered the hawaiian pizza with a caesar salad. Again, at this point our server asked if I needed chopsticks. I'm eating pasta... so no.  Strangely enough, after our meal, while she waves goodbye to my boyfriend, she BOWS to me. What is that? I understand that there are a lot of Asian tourists (and even locals) running around Oahu, but that is just too much. While the food was great, the service was just inappropriate on all levels.  To the managers of this location- please teach your employees to behave appropriately to customers. I don't care how nice they may be, my server flat out made me feel super uncomfortable. It's 2017- please stop thinking in reverse."
Nellie F.,"Honolulu, HI",343,116,480,4.0,6/3/2017,"Cheesecake factory to me is a classic. Their food quality is as great here as it is in every other franchise of theirs I've visited in different states. The lunch menu has a lot of items from the dinner menu, however they are a bit cheaper and smaller portions. Which may not be a bad thing because their dinner portions are HUGE! My mom and I shared the Louisiana Chicken pasta and had avocado egg rolls for starter. And of course we indulged in the complimentary and well-loved fresh Brown and Sourdough bread.  The food was all fresh and hot. The pasta comes al dente (a bit chewy) unless you tell them otherwise. I prefer mine fully cooked but forgot to mention this time. The pasta dish was also nice and spicy with the chicken well seasoned and cooked. The servers also ask if you would like fresh Parmesan cheese on your food (love it)! The avocado egg rolls were so good! Fried but not greasy at all, and nice and hot. The dipping sauce for them is very unique - kind of sweet/herbal but a great compliment to the taste of the rolls. We didn't leave room for dessert that day, but I know from several previous visits that their desserts are magnificent! They don't have their own parking garage nor valet, but they do validate for the Royal Hawaiian parking garage. The restaurant also gets RIDICULOUSLY busy right around 5pm with wait times sometimes upwards of an hour and a half, so come early if you can. Bar seating is open, so that's a good bet if it's only a couple people and someone is standing vigil."
Karli H.,"Honolulu, HI",260,34,97,3.0,9/4/2017,"It's Labor Day madness here in Waikiki. Decided to come here for a lunch with 6 of our friends and since we got here when they opened we didn't have to wait a long time which was awesome. The hostess was nice and lead us to our table and let us know who our server was, gave us our menus and left. We were at our table for about 10 minutes before our server even greeted us and I get it, it's busy now so she took a little bit to get to us. Ordered drinks and the corn tamale appetizer which was delicious, however the drinks took about 25 minutes to get. I don't know what it is about Waikiki and everyone taking forever to make some drinks but I think this is why I never like to come here.   Food came out and we were missing multiple items but the kitchen didn't read it correctly or there was a miscommunication because we had about 6 extra sides of eggs (we like egg on pasta, we're weird) none the less we were missing items and our 2nd round of drinks took awhile as well for a glass of wine.  Lastly we ordered shots to end our lunch because why not it's a holiday but the server didn't ask if we wanted it chilled, salt, lime or anything. As soon as she heard the word shots she left and put it in.  Good meal but I hate Waikiki and there shitty service. Thanks for the gift card atleast."
Roo R.,"Melbourne, Australia",0,1,3,4.0,10/26/2017,"Great place to take the family. Food is fantastic, well cooked. Chef's know what they're doing here. Portion sizes seem just right for majority of meals. The steaks melt in your mouth and I was even surprised at how much flavour they got out of the vegetables. The drinks are made very well, possibly best Lava Flow in Hawaii.  The lighting is dim and sets a great mood. The only downside is expect a long wait time during usual peak meal hours (1+ hour)  And of course experiences are different with different servers.  Our first visit we had a great server that continued to top up drinks and check if we needed anything. The second visit we had to flag someone down for anything. Overall 4/5"
Kit W.,"Honolulu, HI",238,266,566,4.0,3/12/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants. Delicious food, generous portions, and cheesecake for days--what's not to love, right? As if that weren't enough, it gets better! They usually do a deal around Thanksgiving/Christmas time where for every $25 in electronic gift cards you purchase from their website, you receive two complimentary slices of cheesecake--to gift or to keep! Seeing how a slice of cheesecake costs between $7.50 and $8.95, this is a super sweet deal! I came here for lunch twice within the past month so I could redeem my complimentary slices (they expire by March 31). I ordered the regular portion of Pasta Da Vinci both times because it's just that good! It's simple--sautéed chicken, mushrooms, and onions in a delicious Madeira wine sauce tossed with penne pasta and Parmesan--but so undeniably unforgettable. I will totally order this again and again even though there are SO many tempting menu items! I don't think you can go wrong with any of their cheesecakes. I recently tried their fresh strawberry, mango key lime, and lemoncello cream torte, and all of them were divine. If you find yourself having a hard time deciding, your waiter/waitress probably has excellent recommendations. If you want a refreshing drink--the cucumber lemonade is fantastic!"
Zhili S.,"Honolulu, HI",23,2,2,1.0,9/4/2017,"The fork and knife are super dirty.  The server is super impolite, I feels like he want to kick me out of the restaurant. We was sitting there 20min without water. I come with my family with all Chinese and we using the Chinese manus. I thing their servers don't like Chinese. Every time I went there with Chinese family members the server is not good, but when I come with my English speaking friends, the server is awesome.  Anyway, the food is good. I like the food only. I still pay tips for the food. The server's name is Marc C"
WW429 ..,"Waipahu, HI",0,8,,5.0,1/4/2018,Always crowded. Skip the line and go to the bar area if with a smaller group.  Food is always well proportioned. Best value in town for quality and quantity.
Darin H.,"Aiea, HI",49,73,9,4.0,12/25/2017,"My family has a Christmas tradition of eating breakfast here. I suggest making reservations ahead of time or get here when it opens because it gets crowded fast especially on busy days. They serve complimentary honey oat wheat bread and white bread which are both delicious. I was surprised to find that the coffee here ain't that bad either. My family usually orders the cuts of steak and always recommend it. They have a wide selection of items to choose from so you have many choices. Service is always good, even when ordering takeout. Prices are what you would expect from a Waikiki restaurant. Fun fact, you can order their delicious bread for take out for just $3 and they give you a big loaf! The only thing that makes me take away a star is that takeout portions are much smaller than restaurant portions. Overall, never really had any significant problems with this restaurant and will continue to come back. 4 shakas out of 5!"
Diana S.,"Kapolei, HI",71,138,1128,5.0,2/23/2017,"Our large group of ten came in for dinner at 4:30p and got seated promptly on a Thursday.  It was crowded since Waikiki is always bustling with visitors who want to experience The Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time to The Cheesecake Factory and I was amazed at the abundance of dinner rolls such as Pumpernickel and Sour Dough that was served copiously with cold butter that made the rolls so savory. Next, Blayne our excellent waiter took our orders.  He was so friendly and had excellent customer service.  He constantly checked up on us.  He explained the menu.  He was always filling up our waters.  Actually, he was the best server that I've encountered in a while, considering, our large group and our orders as well as our group asking for separate checks. As for my entree, I liked it.  The ahi taco was cute.  The flavor was interesting for a taco.  It was more on the sweet side.  I would have preferred it to have been more flavorful and spicier. Overall, we had a wonderful dinner experience.  The service that Blayne gave us was outstanding.  Many of us left with desserts.  We had a fabulous time in Waikiki!"
Paula K.,"Kapolei, HI",7,105,217,5.0,8/30/2017,"Loud, fun and great people watching. Add this plus their extensive menu wonderful service and its my favorite family restaurant. Great for screaming kids and strollers everywhere. Eat outside and enjoy the waikiki madness. People from all over the world. Menu is overwheming and plates are huge for sharing. Prices are reasonable and yipppeee they brought out all the hot meals for all at once! We shared the miso salmon the steak and the lettuce wraps. All perfect...and Im picky. We dined with a grumpy 1 yr old but it was perfect. Definately share some meals as this place never fails me. Just save room for the cheesecake...cause thats the reason for coming!"
Desiree V.,"Honolulu, HI",205,135,314,5.0,1/1/2017,"If you can get pass the wait, you will not be disappointed.  That is my mantra when it comes to the Cheesecake Factory. They continue to provide excellent customer service and have added some awesome healthy options. Today I ordered the Super Antioxidant Salad- ""A Delicious Blend of Salad Greens, Spinach, Kale, Avocado, Broccoli, Grapes, Roasted Pear, Blueberries, Onion, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds with Lemon-Blueberry Vinaigrette.""  It was amazing.  The Lemon Blueberry Vinaigrette being light, but flavorful.  It was a great combination of salty and sweet which you got in every bite. Now, besides my mouth watering salad, I need to do a shout out to our man and best Waiter ever Mathew S.  He was quick, attentive, and even went beyond the call to ensure our needs were meant.  He not only got us fed, he somehow bonded with us as he wrapped with our sons about surfing and enjoying the simple things in life.  That boy needs a raise!  But till he gets that we have him a bit extra on top of the usual 20% because he deserved it. I'm again a full and happy girl.  Yay me. ------------------------------------------- The best customer service I have ever had here!  Havi gave us exactly what we wanted and more.  Since I'm always too full for dessert I did cheesecake first.  Went with the classic strawberry cheesecake.  Perfect as always.   For dinner we had Shrimp Scampi with extra garlic and cream.  Also with extra sauce on the side.  OUR FAVORITE!  A must for garlic and cream pasta lovers.  The shrimp was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Large shrimp- about 6.   I also did a falafel salad.  It was HUGE.  Very light and chopped well- very uniformly chopped.  The falafel a we're not tradition.  The chickpeas were finely ground and rolled into balls.  Not what I'm used to, but taste great.  Would do again.  BUT, so huge that if it isn't your main course you should share. PS- Arrived at about 5pm.  No wait and food came out pretty fast considering this is the busiest Cheesecake Factory in the nation."
