Cherita D.,"Honolulu, HI",69,4,2,3.0,4/29/2017,Food great but someone was playing with our lights. Went off and on about 6 times. Server was great and shepherd pie was Da Bomb!
Chris J.,"Naperville, IL",131,117,35,4.0,7/7/2017,"Classic food location - nothing too unique, but always good. Lots of food options so all will find something they enjoy. The food never disappoints the mouth (except for the high calorie count). Great go to for a family event."
Alice C.,"Honolulu, HI",98,63,51,4.0,2/11/2017,"Great service and great food! The wait was only 30 mins! Put our names at 830 got seated by 9! The server was awesome and whatever we requested it wasn't a big deal for her which is great! The only thing we had an issue was we got the water and drinks after we got our appetizers which was odd and we were seated above the AC and some of the water was leaking! They need to get that fixed! Other than that, we had a great time and it's been awhile since I came here!"
Shree B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,50,7,4.0,3/5/2017,"Love the vegan cobb salad. So awesome! I get this dish every time. If you like New England clam chowder, they serve that on Fridays and it's pretty good."
Julia A.,"Honolulu, HI",1,8,7,1.0,11/3/2017,"If I could rate this 0 starts I would. I usually like coming here and have decent service. But the service I just recently had was so horrible. There were so many horrible things that the server has done, her name's Nicole. First of all, when she was giving our water, she didn't come to our table. She passed it over the little gate they had between the table and walk way. Secondly, when we were ordering our food she didn't repeat our orders back to us, so when we received our meal it was wrong. My friend ordered sweet potato fries instead and my other friend got a well done burger but got a medium well. Also, when I got my pasta they didn't offer if I wanted cheese..since that's why they usually would ask. So when she came back she just DRAGGED my plate which pushed my utensils to the side and made a loud noise. Like excuse me?! After that I was just so irritated. It was my friend's first time at cheesecake so he wanted to order a cheesecake but our server DID NOT INFORM us that she's taking last call for food or cheesecake. She just gave us our checks so I asked her if we could order cheesecake and she says ""they just closed, sorry about that."" We was so pissed, HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW WHEN LAST CALL IS?! I don't know if she's new or what but she was so horrible. So beware for shitty service if you do get this girl. I love Cheesecake Factory but I don't know if I'm gonna go back to the one in Waikiki I'll just drive to the Kapolei location."
Thea K.,"Honolulu, HI",65,59,25,5.0,1/6/2017,Everything is fresh (not frozen) and made from scratch on the premises. Try the crab cakes....better than any I had in Maryland. The sesame crusted Ahi is da bomb and enough for two....brown rice instead of noodles is a good substitute.  Sit in the front or back Bar for a shorter or no wait.
Yirena K.,"Fairfield Heights, Australia",0,7,17,5.0,8/25/2017,"This was our first time at a Cheesecake Factory as we are visiting from Australia and I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised! We ordered the carbonara, steak Diane, calamari, herb crusted salmon and the Honey truffle Chicken. Everything was absolutely amazing and delicious ! The original cheesecake was delicious too! Make sure you come early as the line starts at about 5.30"
Tyler M.,"Honolulu, HI",188,18,120,1.0,12/13/2016,"Had dinner tonight with my girlfriend. We were seated right when we got inside. THEN our waiter, Kristy(?), acted a little unusual when talking to us. After we ate our food, we waited a good 30 minutes for her to offer us any dessert or if we wanted anything else. So we basically sat in our seats waiting for her. The two tables next to us were waiting for to-go boxes and their bill as well. She didn't come back for quite some time and we told the host. When she finally came back, we ordered dessert and it took her 15 minutes to come back to our table every time we needed something. We were always looking for her. Didn't like the service from her and probably won't come back."
Shilene D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",226,36,21,4.0,7/24/2017,What can I say - the service was super! Our server was outstanding... The food however was so-so/meh... Of course this was my first visit & this is Waikiki. I am excited about the new Kapolei location & will definitely give them another try.
Omri C.,"Lahaina, HI",66,1,,1.0,3/10/2017,"I love cheesecake factory, but the branch in Waikiki is not the right choice for me. I ate here several times and each time was not a good experience. I never got exactly what i ordered, and the food was rare.( even the boiled vegetables) the service was poor. And the manager is a joke and i cant believe is getting paid for what is doing there! Go eat somewhere else, in CF Waikiki you wont get value for your money."
Tammy C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,49,158,5.0,3/31/2017,Cheesecake Factory has always been our family's go-to restaurant in Waikiki. The staffs are very accommodating to our request to be seated at a booth. We tried almost all their cheesecakes already. Love the fact that they have quite a selections of ethnic cuisine and not just pasta pizza and burgers. Although all these are all sooo good too !!! Great food !  Friendly and cheerful greeters and servers.
Anthony S.,Australia,29,40,53,4.0,5/20/2016,"Would have to be...... The largest restaurant, the most varient menu and the biggest meal size! My girlfriend got the slider appetizer and she couldn't eat all of it i had to help her but still couldn't finish it. I got the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and left 20% on the plate i couldn't finish that either, the neiboring guest at tables around us also had very large serving sizes so if your hungry you can not go wrong here! The seating layout of the restaurant is one of the largest if not the largest in waikiki from what i have seen, its massive. it does get very very busy but we had lunch around midday and had to wait about 3 minutes for a table. The lighting inside of the restaurant is slightly dim and the design isnt so modern but fits the island feel with the pineapple style lamps lol. We ordered the oreo cheesecake to share as we both are pretty full, it was a big slice and very rich. Was really good though We ordered. 2 x cokes $6 (free free fills) 1 x oreo cheese cake $8.50 4 cheese pasta w/chicken $17.50 1 x chicken sliders delux $12.95 Total of $47.07 (without 15% tip) and we are FULL! Would definitely come back, was good food, good price and huge serving sizes"
Jessica P.,"Honolulu, HI",302,307,3396,3.0,9/11/2015,"It's been a couple years since I last dined in at Cheesecake and that was in Sherman Oaks, CA for lunch. On that particular visit, the complimentary bread and Chicken Marsala were very delicious. It was so good, it made my Instagram feed (104 weeks ago! Lol). So, I wanted to recreate the experience in Waikiki. At 6:45pm on a Wednesday, the quoted wait time was 30 mins. It was VERY CROWDED inside and out. But, there are plenty of great stores in the vicinity to check out. Or, you can stand in line at the Cheesecake/Take-Out counter to order dessert in advance! Three words: Lemoncello Creme Torte. Our pager buzzed within 30 mins, as quoted, but that was really deceiving. We still had to wait another 15 mins once we turned in our pager. There were at least 20 other customers waiting, too. For a moment we thought they forgot about us, so we inquired with one of the hostesses. She explained, once we turn in the pager, it means that our table is being prepared [not ready!]. They will call us by name when our table is ready. So, this tall, handsome young man finally calls our party of 2. He was probably the most calm, sincere, and friendly host as we walked from the front to the back of the restaurant. As we approached our table, he asked that we stand to the side to wait a few more moments as they prepare our table. Ha! I don't know if the restaurant always operates like this, but here's an idea: page/buzz customers when the table is actually ready! Our server tended to us quickly, but at times was talking way too fast I could barely comprehend what he was saying. I felt like the restaurant suckered us in falsely advertising a ""short"" wait time and now we're being rushed to order. Well, it took another 45 mins to receive our entrees - maybe that's why he was talking fast. So in the meantime, we snacked on the complimentary bread, which was not as fresh as I remember.  Chicken Marsala. The dinner serving was large enough to share between 2-3 people!! So, I ended up packing 3/4 of the plate for home. The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente (which I like). The chicken was tender. The combination of the Marsala sauce and mushrooms was divine. However, after eating a few bites, I was already full (darn you, bread!). We also had Fried Calamari. That was actually excellent. Definitely at the top of my list for best calamari in town! Highly recommend it!! If you're willing to wait, the entrees are as great as I can remember. No military or kamaaina discounts available."
Amy Y.,"Honolulu, HI",303,689,1336,3.0,4/22/2016,"My second time here and holy snap, no wonder I don't come here that much. The wait is ridiculous. When you come during those peak hours, you wait longer than expected. My friend came around 6:30PM on a Saturday night and put down her name for a table of 10. It was a hella long 3 hours wait. It's insane. Was it worth it? To me, not really. The hostess said 2 and a half hours and it ended up to 3 hours. So we basically ate dinner at 9:15 PM. We were all starving like cows!  We were all excited after the beeper vibrated. We walked inside and was seated all the way in the back of the restaurant. As soon as we sat down we already know what we wanted to order. When we saw the waitress, my friend instantly requested for water and tons of bread for all of us...literally. 10 minutes later our bread came and there was only one basket of it. That's it?! The kitchen was backed up so it was slow. We asked for more bread (white and brown). It came with butter. I loved the brown bread. It was soft and yummy. 10 minutes later our appetizer came. We shared a avocado spring roll. It came with about 6 rolls with sweet and sour dipping sauce. It tasted pretty good. Spring rolls stuffed with avocado. Need the sauce with it or it'll be bland and dry. 15-20 minutes later our main entree came. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (rigatoni, with veggies). So, I shall complain now. The rigatoni was not even fully cooked. It wasn't soft. The pasta tasted like oil and seasoning mixed together. It wasn't even special. I'm so disappointed. I wasn't able to finish it so I took it home. It's true, maybe they are known for the cheesecake and not the food. I was full from bread so I wasn't able to order the cheesecake.  Next time if I come to cheesecake factory, I'm doing take out. Cheesecake take out is available too on the side. It's much more faster! I'm done with the experience. Service was slow, but I understand it's busy. Maybe they should hire more servers? Sometimes I don't get why tourist from the mainland wants cheesecake factory here when they get a lot of it on the mainland. Weird..."
Tina B.,"Clovis, CA",85,2,,1.0,6/7/2017,"We called ahead for a table for 6 and was given a 45 min wait time. Misquoted by 1 hour of when we would be seated. Told us 45 mins and we had to wait 1hour and 45 mins. We were then sat all the way in the back of the patio, it's hot and stuffy and the temperature difference from walking through the restaurant to where they sat us was at least 10-15 degrees. I tried to move us to the table near an opening to outside instead of the wall and rudely was told ""You can't just move, there may be someone else assigned to the table!""   When I asked if there were any other tables inside I was told it would be another 20 mins. NO WAY! So we sat in the dark stuffy corner (on our family vacation - once in a lifetime trip in HI with all 4 of my kids)  Turns out ""rude guy"" was our server... I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken and the server said they were out of that. I was starting to think I was being filmed on WWYD? I ended up ordering appetizers since I didn't want anything else on the menu. He just gave me a disgusted look, shook his head and asked ""you don't want ANYTHING else?"" ... are you kidding me. The manager came over a few mins later and said he ""heard"" we were not happy.  I explained the ridiculous long wait, the unfavorable table, the chicken that I ordered was out. He apologized for the chicken being out of stock and again offered me to order something else. When I told him ""no thank you"" he offered me complimentary cheesecake. Not for the 3 of of us that ordered cheesecake but just 1. It was an anniversary trip, family vacation. We had bad services, unfriendly staff and food is mediocre. Find another place to eat if you're thinking of going here. There's a McDonald's down the street."
Zackary K.,"Honolulu, HI",37,57,29,2.0,7/16/2016,Well been awhile since I've been here. The guacamole is soo good. Big chunks of avocados. Ok I spoke too soon. This is why I don't like waiters to try and memorize orders. He forgot our waters and my burger. I eventually got my burger after everyone was finished eating. That was 45 minutes after they finished their meal.
Jody D.,"Honolulu, HI",1,19,20,5.0,9/21/2016,"Very large portion sizes would be my first comment. The food was delicious and the drinks (hot ones we had). Our waitress was a delight so we left her the maximum tip with a bit of extra.  She was very attentive and always communicated how far our drinks and food were. This place opened at 11am and we were 2 of a total of 14 people that waited for the place to open. By the time we left which was 45min later this place was probably about half full... yes it is popular so if you want to try it I'd recommend to go when they open, at least this way you can decide whether you want to sit inside or outside.  We're pretty much fully booked until our departure so this will have to be on the list for when we return but most certainly I'D RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."
Brenda R.,"Kapolei, HI",0,14,,4.0,8/18/2017,"I enjoy the food here. Especially good is the Miso salmon with snap peas. The wait times can get very long but once you are seated, the service is prompt. Drink orders are correct and not watered down. I go here quite frequently, parking across the street at International Market Place and walking over. The wait staff is very attentive to children and my girls (11) and (9) feel welcomed. The calamari appetizer is very good. Crisp with lots of taste. I do not eat the bread offered but there is a few varieties to choose from in the basket and my kids like it. If you have a preference as to inside or outside seating, mention it to the check in staff before you are given the buzzer to come back when your table is ready."
Magi D.,"Honolulu, HI",67,113,78,3.0,6/20/2017,"As a local, I rather dine anywhere in Waikiki. But I had a staycation the other weekend so of course my boyfriend and I dined in Waikiki. There are so much food places to choose from in Waikiki, but we settled on this establishment because we both agreed that it's been years since either one of us ate here. As always, there's a lot of people waiting and there is almost always a wait time. But for a party of two, we waited about 15-20 minutes which isn't that bad at all. We were seated promptly and was given water. I kind of fell in love with their Shepards Pie! The first time I had one was when I visited Canada and I was searching high and low for a place that serves it. Though of course it wasn't the same, but hey, it was so good and I was very contented with that calorie-filled meal! I love how they have lunch specials of certain food items, which is just a smaller portion  Considering that this place is always packed with people, the service was alright, not the best and not the worse. As long as I get my water refilled and the check in a timely manner, then I'm fine (which our server did very well). We didn't get any cheesecake for dessert (I had it once before, though it was good, I'm not a fan of cheesecake-well my stomach isn't LOL). Thanks for the delicious pie, and it was so good, I'll probably come back soon (just for that though)."
Linda Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",18,335,510,3.0,1/1/2017,"Good service. Good food. Nice location. What's not to like? Well, when all Cheesecake Factory restaurants took the Thai Chicken Pasta off their menu a couple of years ago, they automatically lost a star, no matter what. That was my all-time favorite dish off their ridiculously large menu. I've since moved on to the Bang-Bang-Chicken and Shrimp .. but I usually like to have more than 4-pieces of shrimp in my dish. Come on, now.  Now they've dropped the Tropical Martini. WTF? The menu is like a novel, and two of my three favorites are gone? What next? The Avocado Eggrolls? SMH."
