Dani S.,"Honolulu, HI",27,125,318,4.0,6/20/2016,"""Let them eat cheesecake! "" That's what Marie Antoinette would have said if she ate here.  This place serves much more than cheesecake. They serve burgers, pastas, salads, brunch items, girth expanding desserts and more.  The menu is huge.  Even the pickiest or healthiest eater can find something to eat.  I love the crab hash.  The kids brunch with French toast, bacon and fresh fruit is another good choice.  I always have my doubts about whether Mainland chain restaurants make their dishes to order, but the food here certainly tastes fresh and delicious.  The portions are generous.  I'm mostly a low carb eater, but I throw that out the window because this place is carb heaven. Before I forget I want to commend the excellent server we had today.  Blaine K. not only provided prompt service, but he even laughed sincerely at my husband's jokes which is much appreciated since today is Fathers Day and we wanted him to feel special.  The decor reminds me of some rustic Italian villa.  The lighting is good for those of us of a certain age who want flattering lighting, but it might be too dim for some. The only criticism I have of this particular Cheesecake Factory is the traffic flow.  It's very crowded and hectic. You get a pager until you're called which can range from 5 minutes to 1 hour.  You need to avoid peak hours or you'll have a long wait.  We only waited 10 minutes today, so it wasn't bad.  When the pager goes off, you get asked to stand near the hostess counter which is also near the stroller parking area while they find a server to seat you.  It's a narrow area not meant for a lot of people to be standing around. Meanwhile, there are many people entering and leaving the restaurant. Parking can be done at the Royal Hawaiian and the Cheesecake Factory validates the parking."
Katreina G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",89,44,49,4.0,6/28/2017,"Love the food! I don't ever recall being disappointed with my order ever. If you are not bold with trying new things get the chicken medeira... it's my fiancée , my sister, and my favorite dish to order. But the best reason to even visit this place is duh.... for the cakes! And not just cheesecakes, cuz well not everyone is a fan of cheesecakes. If you have a mad sweet tooth and veins of chocolate like me get the chocolate truffle tower. It's a ridiculously huge slice so I never finish it but I always take my left overs home with me! &though the food is great I had to drop a star for two things.... one, never go during dinner rush! They don't take reservations so you will more than likely be waiting a long time to be seated, especially if you have a big party. I've found that the in between lunch and dinner time is the best time to come if you wanna get seated right away. And secondly, pigeons! It's an open restaurant so if you're seated outside or near the outdoor patio you will definitely have some unexpected guests around. Once, a pigeon flew right over my head , so close I felt the air gush as it flapped over me. I hate pigeons! But easy solve, now we always ask to be seated inside lol. All and all , good food and decent service..."

Kimberly L.,"Honolulu, HI",92,285,189,4.0,12/4/2016,"I've dine here once, and have picked up Cheesecakes WAY more than I should (I do work next door). Anyways, I always thought they ONLY did pasta dishes because my friends always told me their pastas are good, but NOPE!  Cheesecake Factory (according to our server) makes everything using fresh ingredients. Their menu is ginormous. They have so many options, and the pages in the menu seem endless. I ended up going with pasta, my sister had a burger, one friend had the chicken parm, and the other one had a soup+salad combo. Everyone enjoyed. The service was good, and fast.  Price was pretty high end, but I expect that being in Waikiki. I usually do not order pasta because it's so cheap and the mark-up. I probably won't order a pasta next time, because my wallet can't handle that lol. But I'd try some of the other items.  Their cheesecake, you can order at the table or by the front where their displays are. They have a lot of variety you can pick from. I am also assuming all cheesecakes are also made from fresh ingredients every day. I like their texture because they're so light and airy, not the grocery store brand where it's heavy and thick. Sometimes they have seasonal flavors, like peppermint bark for Christmas season. Their Pumpkin spice sticks around from Oct-Dec.  Parking: Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center validates for them.  If you go for dinner, get there early. They can get packed and the wait can be for 2+ hours. I would avoid during long weekends or holidays.  ALSO if you have issues with tables being so closed to yours, you probably don't want to come here, as someone can be RIGHT behind you. CF makes use of their space."
Warrene C.,"Honolulu, HI",27,28,33,5.0,7/4/2017,"Love this place! Super busy but worth the wait.  It's a bit hot in the restaurant but I'm guessing it's because it's so packed. Had the Steak Diane and Salmon combo. Very good. The Poke appetizer and Avocado bread appetizers were great. Top it off with cheesecake, mine being a new one Coffee Chocolate Dream Extreme. Awesome!"
Sharmeen S.,"Chaska, MN",0,14,,5.0,12/21/2017,Great food! They are consistent! I have only done takeout for dinner (3x in 1 week) and they are consistently great! A great go-to place when not sure about other places to eat.
Crystle H.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,10,,5.0,11/17/2017,"There is a little wait but well worth it. We ate in the bar area  instead of waiting for a booth. Chad, the bartender is amazing! He makes awesome margaritas!"
Geedine A.,"Honolulu, HI",76,31,27,5.0,5/30/2017,"Came here recently with my husband because we were just so bored on a Sunday evening and wanted to get out of the house. It was so crowded so we ordered some food a cheesecake to go.  The lady said it was going to take about 30 min, so we walked over to the bar area and found some seats right away. In the future we'll probably just sit at the bar and order food instead of waiting for takeout.  I ordered a whiskey cocktail type of drink, which was pretty strong.  For cheesecake we ordered the dulce de leche and lemon raspberry, which were both pretty bomb.  I freaking love the Cheesecake Factory :)"
Ashlee G.,"Honolulu, HI",49,66,181,4.0,1/10/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory probably has the largest menu in all of Waikiki. Go there on an empty stomach because the servings are huge. You can easily share one meal between two. Make sure you save room for dessert, cheesecake of course! Head to the bar for a drink while you wait on your table, they make a really good Long Island Iced Tea."
Ashley A.,"Kailua, HI",11,62,4,3.0,6/14/2017,"This place is yummy and a good set up for a nice relaxing dinner.  There's a new bartender (female) and if you do happen to order food with her, maybe spell it out. She has gotten every single one of my orders wrong lol."
Mele A.,"Kapaa, HI",0,35,144,5.0,8/7/2017,"Friendly staff. No reservations allowed. I always get the Spicy Ahi roll for appetizers! Everything on the menu is delish!  However, lines are always an hour long wait (the least) during evening weekends"
Cynthia P.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/7/2018,"My family and I eat out together once a month and this month decided on The Cheesecake Factory (Jacksonville Florida). I have to say that out of all of the restaurants that we have eaten at, this experience was the worse!!! We had a party of 16 people so didn't mind the wait to be seated. However, after being seated,we did not get our food orders taken until an hour and 10 minutes later. The first waitress took our orders for drinks as soon as we were seated. However, though she passed our table several times to wait on other tables, she never returned to our table or even acknowledged that we were sitting there.  Only after stopping a waitress who just happened to be passing by our table did we finally get our orders taken and then we never saw her again. A third waiter kept filling us up with bread and butter. We never knew who exactly was assigned to our table. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager was condescendingly polite and nonchalant as if he could care less. We received no apology or compensation for the poor service and long wait. We were VERY disappointed after hearing so much about this supposedly great restaurant. It did not live up to the reputation. Maybe they just can't handle large parties. I really couldn't understand it. The food was okay but was not worth the poor service. The service and the lack of concern from the manager took away from what could have been a really nice and enjoyable meal."
Terry J.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,77,10,2.0,8/24/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of our favourite restaurants.  They are not in Canada, so whenever we are in the U.S., we always hit one up. The food and service is always 5 stars.  This Honolulu establishment food and service was 5 stars.  The big burrito was so big, that I could not order any cheesecake.  All four of us were so full with our orders, we all passed on dessert.  My daughter had pasta in white sauce which was delicious and a huge serving.  She could barely finish it off for lunch the next day. Now we have been to lots of Cheesecake Factories over the years.  And have waited for most of them. But waiting for 75 minutes was to much.  It puts a damper on the meal, especially when Waikiki is bursting with great places to eat. Love ya CF, but I'll be avoiding the Waikiki establishment."
Ally C.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",86,53,50,2.0,7/4/2017,"Stopped by here for a quick bite on our honeymoon after a long day. When we arrived we were told the wait was 40 minutes, but it was more like an hour. Our waiter wasn't very attentive, didn't ask us many questions, and only came to our table to take our order then give the bill. We split a meal and they didn't give us an extra plate, nor did our waiter stop at your table, so that was interesting to split. It was a little frustrating because he had a large party by our table, and we watched him stop there multiple times, super attentive and friendly, but not the same for us. Bummed we ""wasted"" a meal here."
Vela K.,"Port Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",64,121,515,4.0,1/21/2017,"Always great flavours and delicious meals along with the great service. Went as a party of six most of us enjoyed a combo meal of steak Dianne with either salmon or chicken with their delicious mash (which I am sure is swimming in butter that is why it is yummmm). We could not leave without indulging in the cheesecakes...try the key lime, this is my new favourite. The wait at this restaurant is always a challenge but I just try to be organised for the day."
Olympia P.,"Baulkham Hills, Australia",27,55,213,4.0,11/2/2016,"These guys do food and cheeesecake well! Massive portions, delicious and reasonably priced for Hawaii. If you don't finish the monster meals they do takeaways nicely packed too. Food presentation is sometimes sloppy but hey you can't have everything...recommend any cheesecake but the cookie dough is probably my favourite. They also do a great Sunday brunch served till 2pm and if you're staying across the road at the holiday inn it's probably the closest brekky option. Try the  grilled chicken and waffle eggs benedict(?!) it's surprisingly good!  Kids brekky is fruit, French toast and bacon...French toast is def an adult portion every portion is soooo large geez Coffee is acceptable here too which is rare in Hawaii (possibly the biggest downer for coffee addicts like me in Hawaii, is the disappointing coffee)"
Kenneth B.,"Harker Heights, TX",9,20,41,4.0,5/14/2017,"This is an all-time favorite of mine! I always and I mean always get the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp meal. I was at Lay Low but Happy hour did not start until 6pm and live entertainment at 7. Initially, the menu did not pique my fancy but I'll let you know when I go back this evening and have a few drinks at happy hour. Delish"
Kaya Z.,"Torrance, CA",16,198,369,5.0,12/24/2016,"I never had good experience with Cheesecake Factory in the main land. But this place is good. The food is fresh and big in portion, and tasty too. The Kobe burger is good for its price. The Gumbo is beyond average. Did I mention they have decent drinks too? Ha, they have it all. Way better than the main land. The waiting line can be very long for rush hours."
Erica K.,"Virginia Beach, VA",275,3,1,1.0,6/18/2017,18 June 2017. (8:45pm- 12:17 am while writing this) and 1 star Because my food was good. Service sucked. 1.5 hour wait for a table. 1 hour wait for food to arrive. 1 hour wait for waitress to bring checks. Informed manager and rather than accepting poor service she made excuses.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE -EVERYTIME I HAVE EVER CAME HERE
