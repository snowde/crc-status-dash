Ingrid W.,"Honolulu, HI",1,10,,4.0,12/14/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but especially the one in Waikiki! Although you have to wait a long time, their food is great! I also love their drinks. It's the perfect place to go if everyone wants something different, as their menu is extensive. Pros: Variety and quality of food and drinks, good service, quantity of food  Cons: LONG wait time, parking"
Carolyn I.,"Honolulu, HI",4,10,18,4.0,8/18/2014,"We had a class act experience tonight at TCF.  I ordered a Steak Diane and my man ordered the pork chop.  While his meal came in a timely fashion, a mix-up in the always busy kitchen caused my dish to come out after he finished his meal, so bartender, Nick, and floor manager, Marshall, partnered together to give us a fair reconciliation of the bill.  We even walked away with a complimentary slice of cheesecake.  We appreciate the accountability and the generousity of spirit.  Our meals were delicious too!  We'll be back."
Sunny S.,"Waipahu, HI",0,19,5,3.0,7/13/2014,"Went here because hubby's craving for cheesecake. The place was crowded as always. I was surprised that we didn't have to wait too long. Staff was not friendly enough, seems like everyone's rushing to do their tasks. Menu was extensive and before I could decide on what to order, the waiter came (again) to ask what do I want. He didn't even bother explaining sizes/portions of our orders, like salads in lunch or appetizer sizes. Before you can have your order, you'll be full with their bread and butter which is btw good. And guess what, you can pass the time by counting how many staffs they have. The place is cozy and I like that they kind of putting families with young kids in one place. But I felt like their lights are too dim. Food is good, cheesecakes are good. But their service needs improvement, and more lighting would be nice."
Allison D.,"Newark, NJ",57,225,115,2.0,1/12/2012,"This place is a trip! The wait is always long...plan on waiting about 2 hours for a table at dinner time. However, its a prime spot for people watching which can make the time go by quickly. The bar is open seating, but people are like vultures in there, so keep an eye out and act fast if you see a table! Note: although they are in the bar area, the low tables are not open seating, just the high tables and the bar stools. The portions are HUGE. The food is mediocre; not great, not horrible. I got the chicken and biscuits and made THREE meals out of it. My boyfriend got the jambalaya and made two meals out of it. This place is great for a big group of picky eaters, everyone should be able to find something they like on the extensive, diverse menu. Service is pretty standard. Even if you recieve somewhat bad service, its hard to be angry as you watch your server sprinting around trying to give personal service to the never ending guests without skipping a beat or even stopping to catch their breath. Although ""romantically"" lit, the place is super noisy, so don't go if you are looking for a nice quiet dinner."
AdnerB M.,"Livermore, CA",0,91,,2.0,3/20/2012,"2 stars because the overpriced burger was exactly that, 2 stars and meh. I know who orders a burger at the cheesecake factory!!! Answer: my husband. We came here for lunch and had a giftcard we had received for xmas, 2 xmases ago!!! So that goes to show you how much we come here. We tried this one because the one at home is ALWAYS packed and has a 45+ min wait for dessert on most nights.  The service itself was alright and my food personally was delicious (I think it was a chicken tortilla roll up dish?). I had to avoid all the delicious alcoholic beverages because I had a massage scheduled later that day and was told not to drink :(  So instead I got a raspberry lemonade ($4!!) but it was so tasty! Long story short, if it wasn't for our giftcard, probably wouldn't have ventured out here and probably won't be back (in honolulu or otherwise)."
Derek C.,Australia,0,8,3,5.0,9/22/2014,A bit of a wait but probably the busiest and most popular restaurant in Hawaii service was fantastic and the food unbelievable  had a burger the first time and was so full we couldnt get to the cheese cake. They were happy to bag it up to take home. Second time had cheese cake and smoothie was to die for.
Shiloh R.,"Honolulu, HI",10,52,9,4.0,8/25/2012,"I do love the Cheesecake Factory, however, I do not like the long waiting time! :(  I guess that's a good thing they're so busy--the food is always fresh and it's comfy seating.  I always try to go for a late lunch or early dinner to beat the crowds too. One reason this doesn't have all 5 stars.....this location doesn't have the ""small plates"" menu--:( :("
Krys L.,"Makawao, HI",17,51,33,3.0,11/28/2011,"I personally love The Cheesecake Factory, whether it's on the mainland or Oahu.  The food never disappoints me, the service on Oahu is pretty average. Yea, I get that it's a popular/busy restaurant but servers & staff can really milk the tourist if they had personable skills.  I do love the live music! It adds for a nice Hawaiian touch."
Joseph E.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,8/25/2013,The server was horrible and all she care about was leaving. She rush us and made dinner evenless enjoyable it was obivious she was rushing us because her friend was waiting outside.We did come a little late but I work restaurant and take care a bit thats where youre money comes from. Deseret was drop first before the meal that raise the flag. She even ask if you wanted your chessecake in a box strike 2 we wanna eat after our food not at home. We requested for water but it never came. Quick tip never go around 1120ish server will rush you out well this one did. Thank you server think Dannie was her name for ruining my experience at the cheesecake factory
Rob K.,"Honolulu, HI",3,158,152,4.0,10/5/2012,"I have been here many times.  Great food but you typically have to wait an hour to get seated because it is so popular. The wait is worth it because the food is excellent and the service is very good. Depending on where you sit, however, the lighting can be  very poor.  Parking is at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  Validation is available."
Wes J.,"Maple Valley, WA",118,131,58,4.0,3/26/2014,Loved it here. Get there before prime dinner hours to avoid long waiting times. Plus they allow you to order from the lunch menu until 5pm!  Food was really good an of course their cheesecake was top notch. Would certainly eat here again!
James P.,"Bountiful, UT",20,511,12,4.0,12/11/2013,"It's the Cheesecake Factory right! I don't usually rate chain restaurants, but this is one of my favorite / standby locations. I've never had a bad meal here, and I've had a few pretty good ones. My favorites are: Ahi Poke, Chicken Sliders, Chicken Wings (Dry with hot sauce and Blue cheese on the side) Boston House Salad (with a side of blue cheese). And if I'm really hungry, get the Cajun Ribeye with Asparagus and shoestring onion rings. My favorite cheesecakes are Macadamia Nut and Snickers. Again, never my first choice, but always a great standby!"
Keola m.,"Aiea, HI",352,146,192,5.0,9/19/2011,"I work in Waikiki.  Next door to the Cheesecake Factory and it is constantly busy.  Always a wait and for a good reason.  Its great. Went on a friday at 430p  Best is to get there early before the dinner crowd gets there.  They open at 11 and stay open till 10 or untill they get everyone in.  Needless to say at 430pm we went right in without a wait.  YAY! The place is HUGE!  and our waiter (Andrew, I think) was great. Very personable.  He gave his favorites and suggestions.  Some we took others we passed on.  I do wish I took his advise and had one of those thick shakes.  it seems the put a piece of cake in a glass add ice cream and whip it up. Mmmm  Oh well, I can do it next time. Appetizers:  Crab cake(jus ok) and Crab stuffed Won Tons(Awesome).   I had the Cuban Sandwich which was great. I also reached over and stole some shrimp scampi from a friend and it was REALLY good.   FOR DESERT......a Hershey Chocolate Cake/cheesecake. Whoa!  Im a chocolate lover and I REALLY LOVED! this.  Complete with chocolate chips and a little piece of Hershey Chocolate candy.  Damm, I had to work out twice the next day. The overall experience was GREAT!"
Mark T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",59,6,9,5.0,10/15/2013,"Totally worth the 2-hour wait. LoL! The Hawaii location is slightly different because they add some local items and creations to the menu that you won't find in the mainland. I've been to the Caesar's Palace one in Vegas but both are good! I got the Steak Diane at both locations. It's consistently good! Oh and by the way, the portions are REALLY BIG for the price you pay! Had to bring leftovers home.That's always a plus! Keep it up, Hawaii TCF Staff!"
Joe W.,"Honolulu, HI",94,134,48,5.0,10/25/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory has once again amazed me with its high quality of service.  I think people give them a hard time because they're so corporate, but this is a really great restaurant for a really decent price.   Service: Sure, you have to wait for a while up front, but once you get in, you're well cared for and not made to wait any more.  The Cheesecake Factory has service distilled to a science.  Ever nuance and every minute is accounted for.  Ever talked to a server from Cheesecake Factory?  I'm sure he/she will tell you about their extensive training.  Notice the little details--how your seater always engages you in conversation, how menus are presented together when everyone's seated, how entrees always arrive together, how servers come back to check on you after every course.  All of this to provide us with behind the scenes, seamless service that, if all goes perfectly, we won't even notice. Food: My girlfriend and I visited the Cheesecake Factory for no other reason than it was a Monday night.  Here's the rundown on the food: Strawberry Lemonade:  Served in a cold, larger-than-expected glass with sugar around the rim, the strawberry lemonade pleasantly surprised me with how much actual fruit was in it.  It was apparent that real lemon and real strawberries were crushed to make the drink.  It was not overly sweet as many lemonades are.  It was worth every penny. Ahi Carpaccio: The description on the menu falls short in describing this refreshing dish.  The ahi was thinly cut and fresh.  I detected no fishy taste.  Before ordering, we were afraid that the wasabi pesto would be overwhelming, but it was well balanced.  The sweet shoyu dipping sauce was a nice touch, and the picked cucumbers were great for cleansing our palates of any fishy taste at the end of the appetizer.  A really great dish.   Salisbury Chopped Steak:  This dish was tender and savory, with a generous portion of mashed potatoes.  The gravy was dark and rich and went well with the steak. Crispy Chicken Costoletta:  This dish came with three butterflied and breaded chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  The breasts were crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  The lemon sauce was creamy and not overwhelming.   Venue: The Cheesecake Factory is always busy so it's always going to be a little noisy.  But it's really no big deal--you can't hear what other people are saying and they can't hear you.  You don't have to raise your voice to talk; there's just always a barely noticeable din in the background.  The tables and seats are always immaculate, and the lighting and music is pleasant and intimate. I don't know if you can tell.  I'm a big fan of this place.  Nevermind the wait, just do it!"
Ashley S.,"Meridian, ID",3,18,10,3.0,1/19/2013,"The food here is delicious. It's the wait that makes the rating go down. I tried calling the night before but they do not do reservations. They close at 11 pm, and we got there around 9. There was a 40 minute wait, so we sat outside and watched people for our wait. Once our beeper thing went off, we went inside and had to wait to be seated among the inside madness. We were then seated outside, right next to where everyone is sitting and waiting. This place is really, really busy. Plus it is really expensive. We ordered cheesecake at the end of our meal and we waited almost 20 minutes for it. The waitress was really nice and trying to make up for the wait on everything, but it was pretty bad. The only reason we came here was because my husband had never been to one and we don't have one in Alaska. If we go back to Waikiki, we will not be going here again."
Chuck B.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,73,9,3.0,7/16/2015,"Typical mainstream Cheesecake Factory, not bad.  The staff seems a little overwhelmed, but common at busy tourist spots."
S F.,"Honolulu, HI",79,39,11,3.0,9/11/2012,"this restaurant's setting is a lot nicer/upscale than the one in ""the big bang theory."" ahaha. I like it here. waiters are very curteous & answer any questions you have about the menu. the have very rich & flavorful blended alcoholic beverages. the only down side is that they don't take reservations! so there is usually at least a half hour wait (I've waited over an hour for a table for two before!) the food makes up for it though."
Monica D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,8,,5.0,8/24/2015,"Last week Tuesday, 8/18/15, we went to Cheese Cake Factory just to pick up some dessert to go for a friend's birthday and I was surprised and extremely happy with our service.  The place was packed and seemed a bit hectic, but that didn't stop the great service we received.  The girl at the register was patient and friendly...I believe her name is Nicole (this is what was written on the receipt)...I appreciated her great customer service.  I was even more impressed with John..he was very genuine and helpful.  He made my experience this day just overall amazing.  I wish there were more people like him in the restaurant industry."
Morgan M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",174,159,58,2.0,9/20/2013,"I was a bit disappointed in this location. Our server seemed unattentive, and seemed to want to get through his whole waiter shpeal before letting us get a word in edge-wise. He seemed more concerned with joking with the busboys than serving our table. He also dripped coffee on the back of my friend's dad. The food was just okay, nothing special, unlike other cheesecake factories, which have really good food."
