Derek C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,2,1.0,8/22/2015,"So my wife and I went to The Cheesecake Factory to purchase only cheesecake. I actually ordered 2, one plain and one strawberry. Once I got my order there were only one, didn't realize till I had walked out so I didn't bother with it. Before I left, I paid with my credit card and the gentlemen behind the counter said I was good. I asked if I needed to sign anything just to make sure and he said no. My total cost was 8.90. After about 3 days I checked my credit card statement going over expenditures and noticed I had a bill or charge of 10.00 even from Cheesecake Factory. I called the company and asked for a Manager. Once I finally started talking to a manager, he seemed dismissing, telling me he would check and call me back. I know $1.10 may seem minuet but it is principle. How can some dude working at an establishment write in his own freaking tip without approval from the holder of the credit card. That has got to be illegal in some way. So yeah, I am giving them 1 star for stealing, because that is how I see it. My name is Derek Chandler and I am currently staying at Aqua Oasis. Today is 22 August 2015. Other people may want to check their statements as well."
Pat P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,8,1,4.0,8/20/2015,The food was pretty good but not what I expected. I made a suggestion for my dish and the waitress comped our dessert! Her delightful personality definitely made up for the food.
April D.,"Pearl City, HI",268,12,11,5.0,2/12/2012,"Mark N is a wonderful server! I've been to Cheesecake many times in so many years. The food is always great and service is usually awesome but Mark really takes the cake (no pun intended) on being a great server.  He makes sure to refill your drinks, asks you if you need anything packed to take home, brings you your complimentary bread, helps you choose your meal, and is just so friendly during your dining visit how can you not tip him your 15%?!"
Emily S.,"Honolulu, HI",10,10,2,5.0,11/3/2013,"My favorite place! Cheese cake factory is one of my favorite restaurant in Hawaii. There is always a long line, but it worth it to wait in the line. Their spaghetti is always great, it's loving for every nationalities. My favorite is carbonala. It's really creamy and it;s great to share since it's pretty large portion. And of course you need to save your appetite for the dessert! The cheese cake taste just amazing in there! My favorite is cheese cake with strawberries. Just plane original cheese cake taste wonderful and strawberries add some fruitiness  to it. The place is pretty loud, since it's more of a family or tourists place. I would like to go back soon to eat that cheese cake!"
Kaileen Y.,"Honolulu, HI",203,149,72,4.0,9/4/2011,"It was a Friday night, which would've been a ""dorm party"" night AS USUAL.  But, as my friends and I were tired of drinking [& by the looks of me, you wouldn't imagine that I party hard, but trust I can], we needed a change of pace.  So, we met up with some of our younger friends & went to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory.  We got there around 6:30 & as it was a ""Friday night in Waikiki"", I wasn't totally surprised to see that it was packed when we got there.  When we saw how many people were outside with beepers just waiting to get into this place, my friends & I took some time to decide if it was worth it to eat here & if all 6 of us were willing to wait.  After consulting with each other, we decided to take a chance at waiting & put our name on the list.  The guy told us it was going to be about an hour & 10 minutes before the next available table.   To kill time, we decided to go to Forever 21 which was right next door. I mean, 6 hungry girls with time to kill, what better way to distract ourselves for 1 hour than to spend it in FOREVER 21.  But first, we wanted to be sure that the beeper would still work from inside the store.  The host told us it would work on the first 2 floors, but just in case, it didn't hurt to be back outside just before 7:45.  Sooo, if anyone's ever wondered about that, there's your answer! :)  The beeper ended up going off while my friends were in the fitting room & we ended up missing our table.  As soon as it went off however, we quickly paid for our things & ran downstairs.  Luckily, the staff at the front door was nice enough to let us go and they gave us the next available table.  The menus are massive!  There are soooo many freaking choices.  It was so hard to decide and I had been to Cheesecake Factory before, but it was such a long time ago that I forgot how long their menu was.  I got the pasta carbonara w/chicken, which I give 4 stars.  My friend Kayla had the gumbo which she said was really good. My other friend Karen had the fettuccine which she rated a 7 (on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being best).  Overall, it was a great experience, with great food & customer service to match. Not to mention, great music (which sometimes is live)."
Don D.,"Oahu, HI",123,366,165,2.0,10/15/2011,"I remember going to CF a while back for a party but decided to come as a party of 2 this time.  We went during lunch and got seated right away. As we sat at the table, the FIRST thing I noticed was that our forks were laying ON THE TABLE. To me, this is unacceptable.  Its UNSANITARY.   The server was quick to arrive.  She did not mention her name or anything. She literally just started saying ""Our specials are...blah blah or you can look on Page 8 for the lunch specials"".  She did not even take our drink order.   When she came back, she finally took our drink order and we placed our food order.  I ordered the lunch Miso Salmon (13.95) and my wife orders the appetizer Crab Cakes (12.95) as her meal.  I also ordered a draft beer , she asks ""What size? the 16 or 22 oz?  I said, ""Just the 16 oz"".  The 22 oz was $8.00.   She returns with waters for both of us.  My water literally had only 7 ice cubes in it.  Just one layer of floating ice.  My ice actually all melted before my food came out!  The beer she brought me was the 22 oz.  Why ask me if youre not going to bring the one I ordered? At least it was the correct beer.   My Miso Salmon was good.  Its hard to mess up salmon unless you overcook it.  The sauce was good.  One piece of salmon over  a bed of brown rice and some snap peas.   My wifes crabcakes had 3 nice size pieces.  It wasnt as crabby as I thought it should be.  Seemed like a lot of filler.  Everywhere I go, crabcakes come with some sort of sauce. This one came with tartar sauce and it wasnt very good. We ordered dessert to go.  We had the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake (7.75).  It was really good. As we waited, I watched the busser bus the empty tables around us and watched him pull a bar towel out of his apron.  He didnt spray anything on the table, or dip it into a sanitizer bucket or anything.  So basically, wiping the table with a dirty towel....and thats where our forks were laying!  GROSS!  Potential to pass on disease, germs, and whatever else was on the previous table!   Will I be back?  Probably not anytime soon. The menu was extensive, theres something for everybody.  Even though the place looks like its ""fancier"", it might as well be a dirty diner!   As for our server, not even a sincere good bye.  The only reason I know her name is because it is on the receipt.  She didnt do anything for us except take our order.  She didnt drop the food, she didnt pre-bus our table.  Seems like an easy job to me!"
Jess Y.,"Marina, CA",33,211,171,3.0,5/22/2012,"We came here for dinner to celebrate a friend birthday.  The lighting was a bit too dim, it was hard to view the menus.  I know that the lighting sets the mood/ ambience but it was too dark.  We were seated almost immediately and this was on a Wednesday night.  We showed up around 9:45pm.  The other days that we walked by, the place was packed and there were people sitting along with vegetation outside waiting for their buzzer.   The service was great, I wish I could have seen what I was eating.   Ordered cheesecake to go, ended up being a good night.  They also brought over a small birthday sundae for my friend even though it was closing."
Pip Y.,Australia,0,24,,3.0,1/31/2012,"Always a pleasure to have a meal at the Cheesecake Factory :) Things to be aware of:  it starts to get busy around 5pm for dinner and they will assign you with a buzzer that goes off when your table is ready - the wait can be more than an hour!  Also once seated the restaurant is so busy and can acommodate so many people that it is very noisy so don't expect to be able to have an intimate conversation because you have to speak loud to be heard. Apart from that - the menu is massive and there are so many choices - be warned that the portions are ridiculously large and the staff will also let you know.  But if there is a smaller portion of your item on offer - I suggest you go for it because I can eat ... and i have never finished anything I have ordered there.  Salads are even huge ;) The service is attentive and staff are friendly.  It's an experience you have to go and try - meals are yum and I can recommend:  the spicy chicken sliders, BBQ chicken salad, chicken & biscuits and the seeded brown bread that you get at your table when you are seated!  All great :) PS always to full to sample the cheesecakes - so have never actually tasted them ... but they look good (!)"
Nikki K.,"Waipahu, HI",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2015,We arrived at 630 and were told there was a 1 hour and 15 minute wait.   1 hour later we were told they were cleaning our table and it would be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes later we were told there would be another 40 minute wait.   When i went to find out what was going on. .they said that we didn't check in until 7 and were told there would be a 1 hour 45 minute wait.   They offered to seat half our party now and half later.   I was livid and refused to eat there.   I can't tell you about the food but the service sucks.  If you want to eat dinner. .go at 4 and wait 2 hours.  They are obviously understaffed and can't admit when they make mistakes with their seating.
Inthira M.,"Honolulu, HI",259,193,371,3.0,5/13/2011,"I haven't eaten at the Cheesecake factory since I moved from Las Vegas back home here on Oahu.  But about five years later as luck would have it, as me and the fiance were walking around Waikiki pondering where we should eat for lunch, there was a sudden shift in the universe and we landed at the front door of this place.  It didn't seem crowded so we decided we'd give it a try.   I remember their menu as being quite extensive (at least over 5 pages), and as I turned from page to page I just felt more confusion phasing over me because I was stumped as to what to get.  Wanting to simplify things I decided I'd choose from just their lunch specials.  Well dammit, even that was hard because there still was so many options.  WHHHYY??  Why must everything look so good???  Finally, I settled on the salad and pizza combo choosing the caesar salad ($1 extra) and the four seasons pizza (artichoke, tomato, prosciutto, wild mushrooms, and mozzarella) and the fiance got the wild mushroom burger, and we got the firecracker salmon as an appetizer.  The appetizer was awesome.  Salmon strips wrapped in spinach and a wonton wrapper, deep fried and served with a sweet hot chili sauce.  Then our meals came.  Holy moly did I accidentally order two whole meals because my salad came in a bowl (think CPK whole salad size) and a 6pc pizza (again, CPK size pizza)... all as one lunch dish??  I looked around to see if anyone was starring at me thinking if I was a baby cow, but I noticed that EVERYONE'S tables looked like ours: big plates covering the whole table.  Even my fiance's burger couldn't fit in his mouth it was so big (no sexual visual intended. lol).  And everything tasted decent.  Nice! Fast forward to Mother's Day, my mom wanted to come here because she wanted to shop at the 3-story Forever 21 next door, so we came in for their brunch (only served on Sundays).  Still not knowing what to order and craving a caesar salad (those get me every time) I ordered the salad and pizza combo again, but this time I got the margherita pizza and mom got the sunrise fiesta burrito (egg, chorizo, peppers, onions, potatoes, and cheese and topped with salsa, cilantro, and an avocado cream sauce served with a side of black beans).  I already knew what my food was going to look like, what i didn't expect was mom's footlong breakfast burrito.  This place cannot stop surprising me with the size of their food.  Her burrito was soo tasty too, the only thing we didn't like were her black beans, way too salty. This place wins the gold medal for great quantity and good quality food at the right price.  I am definitely going to keep coming back... and next time I promise I'll order something new."
Myra G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",2,17,3,4.0,7/16/2012,"If I could eat here everyday, trust I would :) So I ate here twice. And both times I ordered something different. I expected the food to be good, but found out it was great. The servers are considerate (to my face at least) & the place is big, but a little crowded since there are so many tables. But overall since I didn't bring my sons either time, it was fine. It's so conveniently located so I can shop- or window shop ;) right after."
Yo S.,"Pearl City, HI",67,6,5,4.0,6/15/2014,Portions are enough when you're really hungry. Service was awesome! Fried Mac and Cheese was thumbs up!! Steak Diane and Salmon was great. Save room for Craig's Crazy Cheesecake (carrot cake and cheesecake swirled together).
Sam J.,"Lynnwood, WA",15,9,1,4.0,7/27/2014,This Cheesecake Factory is what you'd expect from any Cheesecake Factory... delicious!  Our waitress was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was awesome and the cheesecake was the best around! The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet for good food and this location did not disappoint!  The only downside was the 1 hour wait to be seated but that should be expected at any restaurant in Waikiki around 7! The wait was worth it and we will be returning on our next visit!
Shelley E.,"Honolulu, HI",159,69,264,4.0,7/7/2011,"Cheesecake....My nemesis. You have a power and control over me that cannot be denied. It is because of you, my evil cheesecake that my ASS looks like 2 extra large yelp petals. I hate you, but I love you.  Its 4th of July weekend...I scrapped all my plans for fireworks for some fried mac n cheese balls and it was worth every bite :-) Here's the low down for hostess seating times: 15 min  = 25 min 20-25 min = 20-25 min 30-45 min = 45-50 min 1 hour = 45-50 mins 1.5 hour = 1-1.75 hours 2 hour = 2 hours We got a 1 hour wait, which fortunately for me in the above chart meant I only had to wait 45 minutes! Yet! The service is great, the prices are steep, and the food is consistent, unhealthy and delicious. My kids are always stoked to eat here and mommy loves the blueberry mojitos. Reece's chocolate cake cheesecake is ""beyond out of this world, if I never had another orgasm for the rest of my life it would be ok cause I had this cheesecake"" kind of good.     Most often you walk away with a yummy doggy bag."
Samoa Surf Gu Y.,"Mililani, HI",0,31,,4.0,2/4/2013,One of the better chain restaurants of its class. I have been to this location about four times and each time it was good. The burgers and pizza's are good. They also have huge portions which always gets my approval. The wait is a bit of a drag but hey everyone should be on island time.
Elizabeth M.,"Pearl Harbor, HI",15,22,6,4.0,7/8/2012,"The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because there is always a wait. I've only been here once during a really weird between lunch and dinner time where i got seated quickly. It's not their fault, but it's still a negative.  I love the red velvet cheesecake. It's the whole reason I come. The food is good, but you don't come to the cheesecake factory and wait the hour to get your table for the food. you wait for the cheesecake, and it's worth it in my opinion."
Judie H.,"Oakland, CA",649,561,3088,2.0,8/11/2009,Avocado spring rolls were SOOOOOO good...it was a random appetizer we told the waiter to pick for us. Our main dish...the garlic noodles was BLAH...there was a really good salad a couple people got that was REALLY good too...but I totally forgot the name. The wait was over an hour...UGH...lucky they have random shops to go to while you wait to get paged...not a big cheesecake factory fan...in Hawaii or not...kinda overrated
Mia T.,"Mililani, HI",0,1,,5.0,7/20/2014,Last night waited one hour and a half to get in. We got there at 7:30. Walked around Waikiki. Service was 5 for us. Waiter tended to us in a timely manner. Music was great. Going back again.
Sherin S.,"Sydney, Australia",0,8,,4.0,8/15/2014,"We were sceptical at first ... Then very pleasantly surprised! Great service, friendly staff & delicious food. Servings are very large although quality was not compromised. Downside is very long waiting times for a meal (1hr+ generally)."
Liza L.,"Honolulu, HI",2,47,3,1.0,10/17/2013,"Good freaking grief, I don't even know where to start.  We were regulars at CKF.  The service is so bad and the food isn't any better.  They screwed up my friends meal, serving his pasta raw. Raw like crunchy in the middle and stick to your teeth raw.  He always orders the same thing, when he sent it back the manager told him ""maybe it's time for you to try something else.""  Ummmm F U dude, I go out to eat and pay you to eat what I want to eat! They treat everyone like tourists they'll never see again, so they don't really care if you like the food or service.  You suck Waikiki Cheesecake Factory."
