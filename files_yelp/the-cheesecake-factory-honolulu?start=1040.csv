Corinthian N.,"Honolulu, HI",2,32,2,3.0,3/1/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but we recently went there and my food was cold when it was given to me. I mean, who wants to pay 30 plus dollars for cold steak. I stressed my complaints to the waiter, and he tells me that he will put it in the microwave and bring it back... Wth! I'm not paying my hard earned money for a microwaved meal that was supposed to be cooked and made to my liking. The manager came to the table, apologized and explained to me that they gave my freshly cooked hot plate to the wrong customer, and that I got a plate that had been sitting in the window for a while. I lost my appetite after hearing that. By this time, my family had already eaten their meal, and I was still in the mix of apologies, explanations, and etcetera with managers and waiters. Needless to say, I walked out of CF hungry and with a free slice of cheesecake. We don't eat out often, because we have small children, and we are busy during the weekdays. Needless to say, Wedding Anniversary dinner ruined..."
Katie K.,"Honolulu, HI",46,73,15,4.0,11/14/2011,"Let me preface this review by saying I would never wait the crazy two hour wait that is normal for dinner time at this Waikiki tourist hotspot. However, when I get off work and can get an open seat at the bar, I'm very happy to be eating a late dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. (And they are open till 12, so late night eats are always an option here!) Although I can never imagine taking the menu test to wait tables here, I think its safe to say that there is truly something on the menu for everyone! If you can't find something to order here, you probably should never leave home! Seriously, pasta, sandwiches, salads, tacos, fresh fish, you name it, they got it! And being that they are so corporate, the food is consistently good, no matter what you order. My favorite of late has been the blackened chicken sandwich with a green salad instead of fries (although they do offer sweet potato fries which are highly temping!). The sandwich is massive--as in I usually take half of it home--and costs less than $12! Can't complain about that! Their salads are yummy too, but I know from experience that the lunch size portions available in the daytime are much more managable! So if you want to brave the crowds (normally a 50/50 mix of Japanese tourists and and mainlands tourists too scared to branch out and try a restaurant they don't have back home...) the Cheesecake factory is usually a tasty choice. Just remember, it will be less crowded if you're up for a late lunch or even later dinner. And they do validate parking in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center parking lot, always a plus! Happy eating!"
Don V.,"Kapolei, HI",5,1,,4.0,5/30/2014,"Love the food! Price may seem expensive but it really is the right bang for your buck! The drinks are mixed really well; compared to other restaurants I say the bartender really knows his drinks and has the skills to back it up. If you are coming for dinner (like around 7 or later) SERIOUSLY go and put your name in at least 1.5 hours ahead of your anticipated dinner time, maybe even earlier if you have a big group otherwise the wait is ridiculously long its not even funny. Otherwise the food is really good"
Norm G.,"Honolulu, HI",156,493,138,4.0,4/5/2009,"I really didn't think I would like TCF because it's another ""chain"" restaurant. We came here for lunch while staying in Waikiki for a couple nights recently. I was pleasantly surprised. For one thing, we got in right away. That was great. I had the fish taco platter, and it was decent and very filling; I couldn't even finish it. The kids loved their cheese pizza, and my wife liked her pasta. The waiter we had was friendly, professional, just a cool, regular guy. I would not ever try to come here at night, though. The wait to get in is unbelievable. I am too old and impatient to wait to eat food when I'm plunking down money for my food. Will come back again for lunch someday though!"
Teresa M.,"Honolulu, HI",11,42,1,3.0,2/17/2014,"Our wait time was underestimated by a mile. When we finally get seated after 2 hours, our young server did not know the meaning of attention to details. We ordered 3 appetizers, as our party was pretty large. One came out, but she never put in the other two  Wow! Then, we said 2 separate checks & even pointed out the division for her. Why did we get one check again? When we ordered cheesecakes to go, she put them all in one bag. We told her we needed more bags to separate the orders. She apologized & said she'll get the extra bags & separate the orders for us. Ummm.. She gave us the bags & walked away. Really?? The only saving grace for this particular restaurant location was the delicious meal that I had & the fact that it was my birthday. Otherwise, they would've gotten a one star."
Estelle T.,"Honolulu, HI",36,97,215,4.0,2/3/2012,"I love this place. The line may be long, but there's great entertainment wherever you turn in Waikiki. The one thing I always get is the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. And why come to Cheesecake Factory without a slice of cheesecake right? I'm old fashioned and I like to stick to the original. The white chocolate cheesecake was amazing, but it was too sweet for my tastebuds. There's so much to choose from, but I always stick to the good ol' gumbo. It's really worth it since they give you a huge portion of that. There's always enough to take home and savor the next day. It sucks that there's no reservations but i guess if you really do love the food, you'd wait and I did."
Jennifer P.,"Honolulu, HI",65,57,22,4.0,7/1/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory has to be one of the busiest ones I've ever been to. That being said, when you're craving pineapple upside down cheesecake or the carrot cake cheesecake (my favorites), and you've eaten your fill of the chocolate cream haupia cakes from the ABC Stores, lol, this is the place to go! Desserts here NEVER disappoint! If you're not up for the wait and just want some cheesecake, there's a register on the right hand side coming in where the cheesecakes are displayed. You can get what you want to go a lot faster.  :)"
Kathy V.,"Waipahu, HI",0,10,2,2.0,4/13/2014,"Visited there yestersay lunch time, Good food but the African-American who came in and brought us the food look like he doesnt wanna be there.  He was very rude and unfriendly.  The waiter was very nice though.   2 star for the food and waiter other than that the guy killed the service."
cris s.,"Pittsburg, CA",0,33,2,5.0,4/12/2015,"This restaurant had the best and most fresh food ever! The corn chowder was delicious. Their 4-cheese pasta was by far, the best pasta we've ever had. It comes with fresh ricotta and chicken or shrimp"
Stephanie B.,"Killeen, TX",1,35,,5.0,3/15/2015,Is The Cheesecake Factory ever a disappointment! The food is always amazing and of course the deserts. The wait is always super long but we usually get lucky sitting at the bar. The portion sizes are huge and worth every penny!
Jesse C.,"Yokohama, Japan",143,301,284,2.0,7/17/2009,"We tried the Lettuce wraps, Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll appetizers. For entrees we had Chickaken Farfalle (pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, chicken, panchetta), miso salmon, wasabi encrusted mahi. Dessert was Snicker, Godiva, and strawberry cheesecake. I was disappointed by most of the dishes. None of them caught me and our Passion Fruit Mojito was horrid. They did NOT muddle the mints, sugar and lime juice. This has to be the second worse mojito I've had or the laziest mojito bartender. The mint flavor was overpowering and I could not call this drink refreshing.  The honey oat wheat bread was good while hot. The lettuce wrap appetizer was a fairly large portion enough for three people. The Spicy Ahi tempura was a mere five pieces (for $15, value was lacking here). Farfalle dish flavours were inseperable. The Miso Salmon was good but I want to believe it swam happily down my throat because the amount of sugar put into this dish.  If you come here, do yourself a favor. Come before the late evening crowd, skip dinner, do NOT order the mojito or collect $200 go directly to the cheesecakes."
KJ N.,"Kapaa, HI",14,103,11,1.0,3/5/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a ""very okay"" place to eat. Today, we thought we'd try their breakfast, but I guess we'll never experience it. Can't get over these Waikiki establishments that treat locals like second rate customers.  We walked in--obviously local residents dressed appropriately, and host guy was local too.  Lo and behold, we were directed to the far back at the tiny table off to the side. There were many available large tables and booths near windows. Also, there were many parties of two sitting on these desirable tables.  Sorry, but with a ton of other places to try,  we didn't feel like trying to work it out with the host. and left.  We probably won't be back, and I WILL yelp this.  I'm on a Staycation (the Sheraton Kai Suite has been phenomenal), but I will maintain that all too often, businesses like The Cheesecake Factory make me save my money for vacations out of state."
lisa b.,"Bethany, CT",47,11,,4.0,6/23/2014,"Didn't know that they served a great breakfast/brunch on Sundays.  Stumbled upon it and so glad we did.  No cheesecake for us, but the BEST bruleed french toast I have ever had!  Husband had Belgium waffle and said it was great too."
Aline W.,"Kailua, HI",16,30,,4.0,10/30/2013,"The food is always good and service welcoming. I love their Luau salad (sp?) and cheesecakes. The only thing I dislike is the wait and then after hours when you get seated they put you right next to the table with other people and you feel like part of their party. NO privacy at all!! And you can never reserve a table. The best way to get dinner is to grab a seats by the bar, if you don't mind eating by the bar. So much faster and normally no or little wait, but never the same as you are waiting for the table."
Heather A.,"Bonney Lake, WA",75,66,3,4.0,4/3/2015,"Good food, mediocre service but with the cheesecake factory you can never go wrong. Was seated immediately, food took a little long and hope u don't need parking.. good luck."
Alex G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/20/2014,Not much to say it's the cheesecake factory. It was better than most of them that I've been too and it's probably better than about 80 percent of the restaurants in Waikiki beach. Cheesecake wasn't the best but we had a scampi pasta that was amazing. So it makes up for it plus the service was really good! Would recommend... If I had to recommend a chain restaurant.
Jason P.,"Honolulu, HI",16,29,,4.0,6/23/2012,Good service friendly staff and amazing food! Our server was a little soft spoken and was hard to hear him sometimes but he checked back quite often and kept our drinks filled. Also we were celebrating our friends birthday and they were more than willing to get everyones attention and sing happy birthday for him.
A D.,"Kailua, HI",8,6,1,5.0,5/8/2014,I absolutely love this place.  Service is always good and the food is delicious. .
Bernie V.,"Petersham, Australia",39,82,62,5.0,10/5/2013,yummmm!! seriously the nicest food. yes there are large portions but anytime before 5pm you can get the lunch time portions slightly smaller. I've had the pasta here a couple of times and it's been cooked perfectly! and so fresh you can taste the fresh basil..  we also had cheesecake ordered to go! as we could never finish our meals here. we took a doggy bag after of our meals. mango key like was the best!!
Fawn L.,"Honolulu, HI",198,56,25,4.0,8/1/2011,"I believe everyone who visits CF only goes for the cheesecake, but only cheesecake for lunch or dinner is looked down upon (unless you're me) so people order food as well.  I'm not a fan of their food. I'm a fan of their cheesecake. I've never had one I didn't like. I'm obsessed with their lemon raspberry ladyfinger cheesecake. It's super tasty, but still light and won't weigh you down.  The ONLY food  I like here is their fried mac & cheese balls. I come there about once every few months & commit ""carbicide"" when I order them. But oh so worth it.  My advice is to order an appetizer & cheesecake. Their food isn't worth the price. Or simply get a cheesecake slice from their to go counter & go eat it in the peace of your hotel room or on the beach where you can be gluttonous in private."
