Paul F.,"Bend, OR",214,45,72,4.0,12/13/2013,This location is world-class outdoor seating exciting fun loud great food what can I say it's awesome! I'm giving four stars instead of five only because there's a two hour wait on a daily basis to get in and that just sucks
Janelle G.,"Monterey Park, CA",52,252,56,4.0,12/16/2013,"This was my first time at TCF. I must admit, I had no desire to ever go to this restaurant, I don't know why. My sister (who just got married in Hawaii) decided that we should all go out to dinner here after their ceremony since this is the place he proposed at. The food is pricey but they serve you A LOT!!! Even if you order a ""small"" salad, it's big!!! Our waiter here was ok. He can use some work on his skills but he was friendly. He just didn't come around enough asking if we needed refills or anything else. And we were a party of 16!!! Ummm....hello!!!!"
Georgia N.,"Macomb, IL",0,2,,5.0,6/7/2014,"Nothing bad to say about The Cheesecake Factory. The wait is long but that was normal. The potions are huge so you have plenty of leftovers. Cheesecake was out of this world. The waiter I had was funny, friendly,  and very helpful.  Never a bad place to go."
Dawn T.,"Honolulu, HI",10,19,2,4.0,1/18/2015,"Our server was patient and very helpful as we had a group of 9. We took a long time to order bcuz the menu is so extensive. Ordered the crab wonton and house salad with balsamic  vinegerette. Both were excellent. For entree we had the gumbo with brown rice, The gumbo was very good but rice was a little chewy so I ate it with the bread instead. Shared everything with my bf and it was just enough food as we wanted to have room for cheesecake. We chose the  chocolate  mousse...yummy and not too sweet. As a whole enjoyed our experience there."
Grant S.,"Waipahu, HI",1315,232,1025,4.0,1/7/2011,"""Hey Grant let's go have dinner in Waikiki"" ""ok"" Little did I know that my little sister set me up... big time.  We had dinner at Koa Ave but then I got blindsided by a visit to Forever 21.  The strip of Waikiki was bangin' for it being a Tuesday night with tourists checking out pretty much anything that was open (which was everything). Upon arriving at Forever21 I had a choice, either go with her into the store and undoubtedly be the straightest guy in the place, or check how much money was left on a Cheesecake Factory Gift Card.  Guess what I did.  I won't lie, I stepped foot into Forever21, but not far. What surprised me was the ridiculous amount of people milling around outside and in front of the Cheesecake Factory.  It was difficult getting inside not to mention I had to stand in this loooooong line at the cheesecake counter. Turns out a $50 gift card from like 5 years ago retains its full value.  Good deal.  The staff was quite competent and friendly despite getting slammed harder than your pinky in your car door.  Props to them for not being moody soul eaters like some other places I know.  Despite having to shout my order to the person taking my order 18 inches from me, they got everything right, so I tipped them the balance on the card after getting $40 worth of cheesecake.   I really appreciate all the workers keeping their composure at such a busy hour on such a strange day.  Keep up the good work."
Deano G.,"Farmington, UT",135,569,124,2.0,3/15/2013,"Easily could have been 3or 4 stars, but when the bartender doesn't even say hi, how are you, and starts the conversation with what can I get you... It doesn't make you feel welcome.  The food Is the same as the all the other cheesecake factory's locations (and this location is in paradise).  The food came out so quickly I was amazed... But it's just a chain restaurant and they were slammed, so I guess they were trying to turn and burn as many tables as they could.  I will go back, but I won't sit at the bar."
Eva C.,"Kapolei, HI",41,27,3,4.0,7/28/2013,Sunday brunch today was unusually not busy so we got a seat right away. Portions were humongous and service was friendly. Crab hash is definitely something to get.
Michelle L.,"San Diego, CA",39,36,5,4.0,9/17/2013,"Management here in Waikiki needs to cater to who spends the most money here and ensure Japanese, Hong Kong translation is available at every shift seriously."
Kel P.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,9,10,2.0,10/4/2011,"Who cut the CHEESECAKE??? 1st of all ... they need to open another location in Hawaii! The wait is so not the business! Another location would reduce the long wait & crowd by half .. that would make the dinning experience a lot more enjoyable. You not only have to wait for your table .. you have to wait for your food too! ""sorry the kitchen/bakery is backed up"" .. ""Cheesus-Christ"" .. the food is good & the cheesecake is delish (nowhere near OTTO CAKES .. see previous review) =(  Here's why I only gave 2 star's .. so not like me, I'm normally generous scorer & I often consider ALL aspects .. I've had my share of working in the industry so I have credibility: We had a party of 10 & we checked in at 7pm ... our table wasn't ready until 8:45! Our food wasn't ready till 9:45! Dessert (GRRRR) .. Was a disaster! We were celebrating my Aunties birthday & she ordered a ""special"" dessert, they ""86'D"" the dessert & failed to inform inform us. The waiter brings out another dessert & tells us that they ran out of the ""birthday girls choice"" .. NO BUENO!  The Manager came by & apologized, he comped another ""special dessert"" & sent out a whole choir of employees to sing happy birthday! I SAY .. ""GOOD SAVE""!"
Shay F.,"Honolulu, HI",481,1475,2964,1.0,12/28/2008,"WT!?!? I came home and opened my take-home box to find SOMEONE ELSE'S leftovers....  Ok, so the salad I got (chopped vegtables) was not the best....tasted blah. The Adam's cheesecake was awesome....but HELLO!?!?!  I can't believe they got my take-home box WRONG!!!! That's so GROSS!!!! CHECK YOUR BOX before you take it home!!!!!!"
Johnny G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",694,264,2800,2.0,6/18/2009,"It was Ok. It's SUPER CROWDED at night. Beware.  Highlights? The white chicken pasta something plate. It was VERY filling. We took the rest home, and I swear we munched on it twice for breakfast. Overall, I'd just say that our visit was average. It didn't leave me inspired to return, and I wasn't fired up to rip on the restaurant either.  The tiki torches outside are cool...but there's better spots for better value on Kalakaua Avenue!"
Anna R.,"San Francisco, CA",370,514,378,4.0,6/16/2011,"During our stay in Waikiki, we passed this Cheesecake Factory several times walking along Kalakaua and joked every time, ""What's Cheesecake Factory?"" Since we dine at this chain on the mainland, we were determined to eat only at establishments we didn't have back home. Well, we were on Day 5 of our vacation and the DH and I just wanted something that wasn't local.  I never thought it would happen, but I was ready for a nice salad and he was ready for a burger.  Despite a crowd always waiting to be seated, our wait wasn't long - about 10 mins. But we also did just miss the lunch crowd. The service was good with a little aloha added in.  DH ordered the Factory Burger and I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad + two Passion Iced Teas. The only reason I can't give this location five stars is the food. Almost as good but not quite. DH said his burger was a-ok and unlike the mainland, they don't serve shoe string fries. My salad was good but they were a little skimpy on the fried onion strings unlike the mainland. And my favorite CF Passion Iced Tea was lacking that same exact flavor that's consistent on the mainland.  Otherwise, a good distraction from the local fare!"
G P.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,8,19,4.0,5/8/2012,"Kyle was our waiter he was more than amazing. So polite, always had a smile, and we never had to ask for a refill as he was on top of his serving game. So far the best waiter I've had at this location.  Expect to wait at this location because it's in the heart of Waikiki and all the tourists are wanting to try out this spot."
Tony L.,"San Francisco, CA",663,1265,21,4.0,1/13/2011,"So when I was talking to a friend from college that lives in Honolulu, she says, ""Yo, you HAVE to try out the poke at Cheesecake Factory. It's the bomb!"" I'm like, really? Well, it is. Came here with my family the other night and finally gave the poke a try. Served sandwiched between two thin triangles of seasoned flatbread, covered in fresh shredded green onions, I thought the poke was, in fact, pretty awesome. I was a little less thrilled about the grilled macadamia nut crusted hawaiian fish, mahi mahi, in this case. The macadamia nut crust was a nice touch, delicate and not overwhelming, with an almost panko crunch to it. But the fish was slightly overcooked and lacking in flavor. I also had a thankfully strong mai tai here. I wouldn't have minded having three. My suggestion, avoid the crowd, hit the bar, and have some kick-ass poke while sipping on mai tais. Definitely worth the visit."
Ele G.,"Honolulu, HI",6,57,98,5.0,6/30/2013,"food 5 stars cheesecake 5 stars service 4 stars wait time? for those who complain about the wait time, well it's not their fault... it just means that they bring in good business and it's nothing personal... if you can't wait then go somewhere else:)"
Debra E.,"Duvall, WA",1,138,3,3.0,5/27/2014,"Our hostess started things out on the wrong note as she did not seem happy to see us and seemed irritated when we asked for a booth. She said we could have a booth, but would need to wait for it to be cleaned. She did not make any small talk as we were waiting for it to be cleaned and then she got snippy with my husband when he had the nerve to try and sit before the places were set.  The waitress was very nice, friendly, and attentive. The food was delicious as it always is at the Cheesecake Factory.  We could do with less negative attitude and gloomy expressions from the hostess. Maybe she could attend a customer service training since she's in the service industry and coming into contact with a lot of tourists ready to spend at the establishment where she works."
Mike S.,"Burns Lake, Canada",1,17,19,3.0,7/11/2013,"Always HUGE line-ups at this place, so we spent at least an hour waiting for a table.  This restaurant is massive and can seat hundreds.  Service was prompt, but the food was OK.  I guess I expected more.  Overall it was good and I would come again."
Jason Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,2,1.0,4/13/2014,"Been to lots of cheesecake factories in the mainland, but first one in hawaii.  HORRIBLE!  The waitress took forever to take my order.  The appetizer came out first.  Wheres my bread??  I asked her for bread and she brought it out 5 min later.  I would have gotten no bread if I didnt ask.  The bread was hard and had a hair it it!  The waitress had this fake smile, and a bit of an attitude.  My wife and I wanted to leave so I talked to the manager, and told him what happened.  I told him I wanted to pay for the appetizer and leave.  He said he was sorry, and told me not to worry about paying for the appetizer."
Krys Y.,"Honolulu, HI",153,115,73,3.0,6/7/2011,"My favorite: Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon combo! SO GOOD. The wait time to get seated can get REALLY long if you go on a weekend or anytime after 5:00pm. On the weekends, I've experienced a little over an hour wait time to get a table, someone I know has waited for 2 hours on the weekends. However, if you can catch an early dinner, around 5ish, on a weekday, the wait time is about 20 minutes. At 5:30, the wait time had already built to 40 minutes. Since this location is in Waikiki on the strip, and it can accommodate a very large number of people, it's ALWAYS bustling with people and tourists. The place is nice, the lighting is dim, and I feel like the food and help is really hit or miss when it comes to what you get. I've had good dishes, and bad dishes as well as good and bad waiters/waitresses. The portion sizes are very good though and I usually have a little bit leftover to take home. HOWEVER, the desserts are ALWAYS good. They have EVERY cheesecake imaginable, as well as a few other desserts that are good. This past time, I shared a brownie-ice cream dessert with my boyfriend and sister. Everything is very rich, and you should probably set aside some stomach space for dessert if you plan on having any!"
Alicia D.,"Pearl City, HI",3,41,4,1.0,3/4/2014,"They always have a wait....it's a popular place so! Don't go to this place for Sunday brunch. Every time I've went with my boyfriend they ran out of french toast before noon. I brought it to the manager's attention and all I got was a I'm sorry, we do have to soak the bread 24 hours, so we just didn't prepare enough the night before. I must say the manager's suck and they need better training."
