Kevin S.,"Brea, CA",184,313,35,4.0,8/11/2011,"I am not one of those people that believe they are ""above"" chain restaurants, and coming here for the first time in a while reaffirmed why that is so. The food my group ordered (combination pizza, pasta, some drinks) were all surprisingly good and came out within 10 minutes. I think the bill came out to about $15 bucks a person, which seemed pretty average. Service was good, and the atmosphere seemed comfortable.  On another note, this place has probably the best location on the Waikiki shopping strip. Highly visible, and easily accessible to foot traffic. Consequently, it is always retardedly busy. Would come here again if too lazy to find hole-in-the-wall places in Hawaii again!"
Ed W.,"Honolulu, HI",58,170,9,4.0,5/10/2011,"Food - 4 Price - About right Service - 4 Cleanliness - 4 I've been to numerous CF's through the years but have avoided this one as it's always swarming with tourists and what appears to be ridiculously long lines.  So the review is commensurate with expectations.  We expected the long wait, attentive service, great food, and desert.  That's exactly what we got. So... we parked at our secret spot (sorry) and checked in at the restaurant, got our pager, was told it would take an hour.  We walked around a bit, got back to the area in 50 minutes, waited about 12 or so minutes and our pager buzzed. Our table was kinda tucked away but it was just fine.  Candace was our waitress and she was excellent.   We ordered - - Pina Colada - Tasted awesome but only a tiny hint of alcohol - Blueberry Mojito - That was nice and strong - Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon - Steak was damn good as if the steak melted in your mouth, Salmon was good but the Salmon tasted  - Coulette Steak - Good overall steak.  Skipped the fries. - Tiramisu Cheesecake - Great balance of traditional cheesecake and tiramus - Dulce de Leche Cheesecake - As advertised, not too rich which was perfect - Coffee - just right Overall, not much to complain about except the wait and the inability to make reservations."
Chelsea J.,"Kapolei, HI",281,11,6,5.0,2/23/2015,"I came to The Cheesecake Factory with my boyfriend this past Thursday evening. There was a bit of a wait about 50 minutes but I didn't mind with all the shops around... Got sat a few minutes after my quote time but no big deal... Hostesses were very nice. Got sat all the way in the back of the restaurant... I had no idea it was even that big since it was my first time at this location... We got seated at a half booth/half chair table which wasn't very private but whatever I didn't specify a booth or anything just to avoid the hassle... But anyway our server Jessica (I believe that's her name) was awesome. I got the gumbo and my boyfriend got the bellagio chicken which she assured us were great choices. She was definitely right. Had a good dinner, good wine, good service, food came out fast, everything was good. Big portions for affordable prices. I would definitely come back more often if there was one closer to where I live (ewa) but I will definitely be going back some time in the near future."
Dino K.,"Honolulu, HI",183,31,57,3.0,2/9/2011,"I've been here maybe 3 times..every time its been really busy! except this time...i went early so i beat the dinner crowd. I never really had anything bad here..today, i had the fish tacos and my other half had the crispy spicy beef. Both dishes were pretty good! For appetizers, we had avocado spring rolls...which were absolutely awesome! I highly recommend these as a starter..the decor inside this place is really well done..very nice inside! The only thing i recommend is try to avoid going during the traditional dinner time...its crazy busy and you'll be waiting awhile to eat. Overall a good place to eat in my book!"
Fern C.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,86,97,5.0,4/24/2013,Went last weekend for my boyfriend's 27th B-day. I could say it was pretty good! I ordered Fried Shrimp Platter that includes coleslaw and french fries. Dang!! I was loving my plate! While my bf ordered Steak Diane which I could say it was pretty good too. We went there around 4 pm and we had a seat right away.
Lauren S.,"Stockton, CA",497,702,13,4.0,12/24/2010,"It's the most wonderful time of the year at the cheesecake factory..now is the time when they have RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. Oh yes, it's true...Now get yourself down to the cheesecake factory for this slice of heaven!  (Just make sure to save me a piece ;) )"
Brian N.,"Richmond, Canada",0,8,,2.0,5/6/2015,"I've been to a few different Cheesecake Factories and they provide a consistent experience.   It's a popular food chain but has an extensive, varied menu.  Last time I dined there, I decided to go light since their portions are large.  I ordered the Endive Pecan Blue Cheese salad and an order of Buffalo Wings to share.  The wings came first and they looked amazing.  They had a nice dry rub on them as opposed to the overly saucy wings you get at some places.  They tasted good until I got into my second wing and noticed my lips and throat burning but it wasn't from the hot sauce.  It was a pure sodium burn, these wings were so salty!  I asked my wife to try one and she agreed that they were way too salty.  I told the waiter about them and asked if by mistake the cook put too much salt on them.  He said they were all done the same and shouldn't be any saltier than any other batch.  I couldn't eat any more of them and he agreed to take them off the bill.  When I got back to my hotel, I looked up the nutritional chart for the wings and it stated 4420mg of sodium (over twice the daily recommended maximum intake of sodium).  No wonder.  I don't know why restaurants feel they have to over-salt most items.  I understand a reasonable amount of seasoning makes food taste better but this is just overkill.  I had to drink a gallon of water just to flush out the sodium from a couple of wings. On a good note, the endive salad and my wife's advocado spring rolls were quite tasty.  As well, the original cheesecake was very good (we also tried the Hershey bar cheesecake but the enjoyment was distracted by the amount of chocolate chips and cake in the dessert). Advice to restaurants, cut down on the sodium and try to rely on quality foods to attract customers."
Debbie D.,"San Pedro, CA",0,8,,5.0,3/20/2014,"I had a great meal, dessert, and drinks at the bar.  The staff was very personable and attentive. The quesadilla with Kahlua pork was fantastic and came with ample sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.  The Tiramisu was light and delicious.  The drinks were mixed well.  After a few nights of disappointing meals at other places with better ratings, I was pleasantly surprised!"
Bob V.,"Boulder, CO",21,74,75,4.0,10/17/2013,"This place has good food and incredible desserts although the dinner wait time is a little ridiculous at times, eat early or late! Sometimes I call ahead and get dinner to go..."
Mandeep S.,"Elk Grove, CA",82,238,171,4.0,9/28/2013,Place gets really busy during peak hours. Expect a 40 minutes to an hour wait. People of all kinds visit this establishment and they do have a menu in Japanese as I observed a patron to request one. Food was okay. Nothing to cheer about. I don't remember ordering alcohol so cannot vouch for the alcohol ratio in the drinks. The cheesecake will never do you wrong. It is always yummy and delicious. This is one of those establishments that you are excited to see in Hawaii as they serve many different varieties of food. One of the places I knew I could order food that I could eat.
Robert K.,"San Jose, CA",141,437,196,1.0,1/21/2009,"I work in a restaurant and we have a phrase we use called ""turn and burn"".  It's when we're busy and we try to turn as many tables as possible in order to make more money.  Fast, impersonal service in an effort to seat more people.  If you're a good waiter you can do it without your guest noticing.  If not, well...... The service sucked.  No offense Barry, but we want to chill out and eat, not rush.  We got a coveted outdoor seat, which I did love, but like I said, bad service in an effort to get us out as soon as possible.   And the food...The food sucked.  I love CF.  I've been to 3 different locations here in the Bay Area, and it's definitely one of my favorite places to eat.  But for some reason something tasted off here.  My pasta tasted like it had been sitting for a good 20 minutes.  The Roadside Sliders we got for my daughter ($9.95 btw) tasted like Wendy's hamburgers.  My fiancee's Chicken Madeira was disappointed, and my Mom's fish was overcooked ($24.95). Overall, for the money spent, this was a huge let down considering how crowded the place is.  I guess tourists flock here because there's only one or two in their state.  We have like 4 here in the Bay Area and I was reluctant to go because of that, but the outdoor seating and the fact that it was Cheesecake Factory Waikiki drew me in.   With all the great restaurants on the island I would definitely avoid this one."
Austen I.,"Honolulu, HI",300,81,20,3.0,12/18/2010,"Since there are hundred of reviews, I don't need to reiterate what has been said:  Cheesecake good, Food so-so. I've been here a bunch of times and I must say that their service has gotten better over the years.  I walked in and told the guy hostess (I'm not sure what you call guy hostesses)  that I would like a table for 13 people.  He was extremely helpful and told me to stand on the side to talk to the manager about how long a wait would be.  The manager quickly came to talk to me and said that the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half.  What ended up happening was the wait was over 2 hours.  Considering that I expected to wait 3+ hours,  I had a pleasant evening. To celebrate the cheesecake factory occasion, I rocked my favorite cheesecake factory shirt:   Woo Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel CheeseCake!"
Matthew M.,"Chino, CA",35,70,28,3.0,6/3/2013,Best thing about Cheesecake factory is hands down the cheesecake. Food is ok to good. Waikiki Cheesecake factory can get very busy and cost more than mainland cheesecake factory's. Service was OK. Had to wait for refills a few times.
Mitchell N.,"Aiea, HI",105,77,117,4.0,10/14/2009,"Aside from the fact that there's nothing local about it, the Cheesecake Factory has a diverse menu, terrific food, and good service.  Our party of 5 may have arrived at 5:30pm and were seated within 30 minutes. If you walked there's plenty of shops nearby to pass time in, if you're trying to find free parking you'll be in for a headache. That there's only one location, in Waikiki, may be no surprise to residents but makes for a convenient restaurant for those it likely caters to.  The wait staff is very friendly and helpful, despite being very busy. The waitress was also nice, though service was a little slow. Also, the only area open to us in 30 minutes was outside on Kalakaua - taking down the ambiance a few notches but overshadowed by good food. First up - the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo: I've never been to the South, but it was easily among the best I've ever had. It was slightly spicy, sausage and shrimp were great, and worth the $17 dollars.  Double burger: If you've ever wondered what a true super-sized McDonald's Big Mac would be like, this is what it would be - except the bun in the middle is simply another top sesame bun. Too much food, but good. Wasabi Crusted Tuna: This was perhaps the disappointment of the bunch. The ahi was fresh and well cut, the miso sauce tasty, but for the price can't rival that found in some of the Japanese restaurants on O'ahu.  Sliders: Seem to be all the rage nowadays. Good, but a better (and less expensive) option is at Yardhouse, in Waikiki.  The intent was to go and have cheesecake, and though we didn't order it, left feeling no less satisfied. The food lives up to the price and makes for a good special occasion, or to try out at least once."
Ashley C.,"Annapolis, MD",24,47,23,5.0,10/6/2013,"Have been here a few times. Last them was a Saturday night. The line to put your name in for a table was super long and there were tons of people waiting outside. We were told it would be an hour wait and it was only about 45 minutes which was great. They have a lot of seating on the inside, much bigger than any other Cheesecake Factory's. The food was amazing, as always."
Melissa S.,"Honolulu, HI",21,16,5,2.0,1/5/2014,"We have been to a Cheesecake Factory before, just not in Hawaii. We arrived about noon on Tuesday and seated right away. Out waiter was very nice and the decor is really nice inside. My husband ordered a well done bacon cheeseburger and it arrived with pink in it. Seems we keep stricking out on the well done request. Anyway the manager sincerely apologized and took care of the mistake. We will try here again sometime....but maybe for that yummy Cheesecake. 09/2012"
Justin P.,"Honolulu, HI",434,31,19,4.0,6/1/2011,"I was totally impressed with the Cheesecake Factory.  I'll admit, I was really apprehensive about going there.  I thought that the food was so so, but one night my wife and I decided to venture out of our usual and Wow!  I had the Spicy Crispy Chicken sandwich, and it was so juicy and moist.  I kept fantasizing about it.  We order a pizza for our appetizers thinking it was the usually tiny pizza that a person wouldn't remember, and that sucker was pretty nice! Good quality food, reasonable price, and nice portion size!"
John N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,1,1.0,5/19/2015,"The male waiter who served us completely ruined our latest experience as we went for dessert after dinner elsewhere, we were completely satisfied by our dessert. Once the bill came I pay by card as per usual and noticed there was no pen included in the bill so I had no chance to leave a tip to be processed on my card along with the bill. Fast Forward 5 mins and I kid you not the same waiter is there running after my partner and I and had come to tell us for future reference the tip isn't included in the bill. I find that very rude unprofessional and very embarrassing on the cheesecake factory's behalf. Firstly, I understand employees work on minimum wage but it is up to the customer wether or not they are satisfied enough with the service to give you a tip or not. Secondly, It's not the customers responsibility to pay your wages so it's not fair to assume it is your right to expect a tip no matter what from no matter who. I will no longer be returning to the Cheesecake Factory after that experience thanks to this one waiter who has ruined it."
Isela W.,"Honolulu, HI",24,52,21,5.0,9/28/2011,So happy that now that I moved to Hawaii I have the Cheescake factory just like my hometown of San Francisco.  Love coming here with my hubby.  Always packed but always worth the wait.
Phil M.,"Turlock, CA",47,66,15,4.0,6/18/2013,"Ok, this was the only place my wife and I will visit that is not a hole in the wall place to eat.  The reason....we love the options and food overall.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is the wait which is caused by everyone wanting to go here.  The service was impeccable at our visit.  When we checked in we were told the wait was 90 minutes.  Ok, we wait.  30 minutes in we decide to hit a hole in the wall restaurant instead, but wait.  When turning in our buzzer the guy tells us that he has a second bar and to check their if we do not mind sitting at the bar.  We go look and two seats open.  Thanks for the tip. Great service again from our bartender waiter named Robbie.  Very attentive, pleasant and greeted everyone at the bar with a smile.  Now the whole time we were seated he was getting hammered by incoming bar orders, but he kept my water full, he checked on our order and even noticed when my food came out missing something and immediately informed someone that the item was missing and sent them for it.  We gave Robbie a 40% tip.  As for the food my burger was cooked to perfection and was moist as well as my wife's sliders.   Nice job Cheesecake factory.  No matter if its San Diego, San Jose, Las Vegas or Waikiki we will always stop in."
