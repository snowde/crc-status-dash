Courtney O.,"Honolulu, HI",194,350,283,4.0,8/19/2011,Whenever I come to Cheesecake I try to come at off hours so I don't have to wait in a long line. I love that there is free validated parking. Where else can you find that in Waikiki? The drinks are good although a bit expensive and the food is always okay. I usually take a Cheesecake home and my fave is the oreo. I think over the years the slices have gotten a little small while the price has either remained the same or gotten higher... I'm onto you!!
Angel E.,"Honolulu, HI",0,16,11,4.0,3/2/2014,The food is great! BUT make sure to check your utensils before using them. Ours were dirty with bits of food left on them and we had to ask for new ones.  That's about it (:
Kyle S.,"Fullerton, CA",133,195,58,4.0,10/6/2011,"Huge portions, giant menu, and amazing cheesecake. Those are the three easier ways to describe the cheesecake factory.  The cheesecake factory is an American eatery that offers many different types of items on their enormous menu.  Each time i visit it takes me quite a time to decide on what to order.  But not matter what I order the food is good.  I especially love the deep fried macaroni and cheese which are macaroni and cheese balls breaded and then deep fried and served with marinara.  Every time I come here even if I tell myself ""you will not order the mac and cheese balls this time""  I always end up ordering them.  My favorite cheesecake here as well is the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake and it is delicious.  While you cannot go wrong with almost anything on the menu there are other things you must watch out for. This location is a great location for the restaurant but leads to many problems for the customer.  It seems as if the restaurant is in a weird shape and they do not have enough seating for people waiting for a table (and people wait hours for tables literally hours.)  If you plan on coming during dinner time on a weekend plan on waiting for at least an hour.  While this place is good it is not wait around for an hour good.  Your best bet to avoid these lines is to arrive from about 2-5pm and you will not have more than a 15 minute wait.  At 5pm they open up the entire restaurant for dinner service so a good time to show up is right around 5pm.  Showed up at 5pm with a group of 8 and was seated within 5 minutes.  Oh yea forgot to mention this place also doesn't take reservations so either show up early or be prepared to wait. In the end great cheesecake (it is called the cheesecake factory for a reason), good service, but a long line that is not worth waiting an hour for."
S D.,"Honolulu, HI",71,50,13,3.0,8/24/2011,"Love the Crab Won Ton appetizer & the desserts. Other than that... The entrees are ok. Too crowded!  Even when I arrive during ""Senior citizen"" dinnertime.  Validated parking"
India R.,"Kailua, HI",104,106,59,4.0,9/5/2013,"Sit at the bar and get the Ahi Tataki Salad, you won't be disappointed. The menu is still to big to read through, the restaurant is enormous, and the service is quick!"
Shirley Mina Y.,"Makakilo City, HI",88,222,302,4.0,9/5/2011,"Day 029/365 Yelp Challenge 2011 I wasn't very hungry last night and wanted their cheapest salad:  the $7.50 green salad.  I figured it would be a small green side salad.  I was very wrong.  It was huge, big enough to share.  I think the tomato that was cut into wedges was actually one entire red tomato.  Along with their complimentary bread basket, it was a giant meal. This restaurant is disappointing where they do not allow reservations or buy outs.  I spoke to one of their waiters many months ago, looking for a new venue for our gr. 6 end of the year banquet.  He suggested to me that we just drop off all of our attending students, 100-200 sixth graders, at their restaurant's opening time, and they would seat them all!  I could just imagine a huge mess, hungry students, nothing would be plated or pre-ordered.  I'll just keep looking for another venue for next year's end of the school year banquet."
Alfred G.,"Waipahu, HI",34,68,16,3.0,2/15/2011,"I'll make this one short but sweet..... the main reason why I go to The Cheesecake Factory is for the dessert of course, the Red Velvet Cheesecake is THE BOMB!! it's the best i've tasted so far & red velvet is my favorite type of cake, cheeesecake etc. The food is actually pretty good and they are very generous with the portions which is why I don't mind paying the price. The service is okay considering it's always busy and noisy. I would give it another star but I can't because the wait is too long (avg. 30 min. on a good day) and the parking is a bit inconvenient. Other than that I'd say that it is a little above average restaurant and would visit again if I'm ever in town or waikiki"
John O.,"Honolulu, HI",162,398,272,3.0,11/28/2010,"I have no idea why tourists travel thousands of miles and want to eat at the Cheesecake Factory??? Something I am sure they could get in their hometown!!!  Anyway, I absolutely refuse to wait in line or in this case, out on the sidewalk and curb. If I do come here, I am either by myself or with one friend. I head straight to the bar area and have a seat either at the bar or one of the tables near by. It is just more convenient and I don't want to make my eating and drinking an event!  If the bar near the entrance is full, walk toward the back of the restaurant and you will find another bar back there. It is a bit smaller but just as good. The food is the same and you still get the same ""phone book"" size menu!  I like the Cheesecake Factory, but I prefer to eat from the local or one of a kind restaurants when I travel. Not something I could easily find at home!!!"
Michelle F.,"Fallbrook, CA",147,23,6,2.0,11/17/2012,"I'm giving this restaurant only 2 stars however I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory that has rated less than 5. I was very disappointed with this location. Could never find our server, finally after 45 minutes got our food which appeared to be sitting for a long time. Sandwich bread was hard as a rock, salad was soggy and the meat and veggies were cold and soggy. So disappointed. It wasn't like the place was busy. We didn't even have to wait for a table. Maybe it was just an off day but I won't be going back to this location. At least we got to eat free cheesecake because our dinner was so terrible."
Lofa L.,"Kaneohe, HI",140,549,188,1.0,7/1/2013,"So Im a fan of the cheesecake from the factory and I dont want to wait an hour to get a table (you think Im joking? nope) but I love their take out counter. However I went Saturday night and my experience SUCKED royally from the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center location. First there was no line control whatsoever. Normally theres a line running to the bathroom side of the restaurant. This time people scattered and anyone walked strait to the register and started yelling orders. Then I finally get to the register and I order cheesecake with strawberries and tell the female cashiers to add bananas and she gives me a look of WTF......wait Im the customer and Im paying so you should make my order...especially when its not that hard to slice some banana and put it on the plate right? WRONG! I even asked her if there was something wrong with me ordering cheesecake with bananas and strawberries and she said nothing wrong to do it, but when I get my order theres no bananas. I didnt get charged for them either, but I wasnt going back in line and I was over being in the factory with the current staff on hand. I was out. When I get outside and start to eat it the cheesecake wasnt even cold. It was almost room temperature. Im all about understanding there are bad nights and stuff hits the fan but that night TOO MUCH STUFF HIT THE FAN. Im not gonna give you a one star rating but whoever is in charge better get the staff in shape. If you arent gonna get things in check I will have to resort to cheesecake factory cakes from Costco (which is actually cheaper and for sure will be cold and consistent!). Heres to lowering your rating. Unfortunately I will be back."
Cindy L.,"Honolulu, HI",35,72,15,5.0,10/23/2013,"Came here on my bdayy and dont take reservations , walk in only. Came about 8 pm ish and the wait was a little over an hour. The girl gave us a really good time estimate :) hate it when people lie and I have to wait waaay longer. She was on point ! :)  Got the hibachi steak ? It was yummmmy !!!!  Love how the lights are dim and cozyy. Also got a free little ice cream sundae since it was my bdayy, a few of them sang happy birthday and everything was so cute.  Servers always passing by to check up on you.  Couldnt complain about anything !"
Jennifer J.,"Oceanside, CA",12,74,21,3.0,4/5/2014,"Take out the cheesecake we took to go and it would be 1 star. Blah service, over salty food. Better food for less in Waikiki. Go elsewhere."
Tiffani T.,"Nashua, NH",0,5,3,4.0,4/5/2014,"I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory until I moved to Waikiki and this was one of the first places I visited once I got here. It is a little pricey for college students but it's nice to go out once in awhile. The food is very good I've had the calamari, pizza, multiple cheesecakes and one of the burgers (I've been there multiple times). It seems to be always busy and they don't take reservations which is probably true with every Cheesecake restaurant."
Tamara C.,"Sun Prairie, WI",68,309,404,4.0,4/23/2013,We shared the chopped salad and their everything pizza.  We had more than enough for three people.
Racquel K.,"Honolulu, HI",404,303,360,1.0,9/21/2010,"If the name alone doesn't make you go there then I don't think anything else will. Just came back from ""dinner"" to celebrate all the september birthdays! They do not take reservations even if its a group more than 10, We got there at 715pm and they told us our wait time would be 45 minutes, which we accepted and waited for. However they did not mention that we had to wait another hour! YES it was almost two hours before we got buzzed... It was really annoying when we kept asking after an hour how long the wait is and they kept replying with the mandatory sayings, ""20 more minutes, setting the table now..."" I think NOT! I would have really appreciated if they just told us up front how long the wait would be instead of sugar coating it, then we would have choose another place to satisfy our hungriness!  So we get buzzed then we have to wait again to get seated! seriously I guess there are different levels of waiting..  Level 1- Waiting outside, making sure that your stomach is really empty! Level 2- Wait for Host, now you really need to eat be cause you already waited 2 hours and you can smell the aroma of the food and see all the food passing from the kitchen to the customers.  Leve 3- Waiter, I am already going to automatically get 18% so I can do a shitty job, its required anyway!  Really??? We get to our table and we there aren't enough chairs, so we politely ask for an open table next to us so we can combine it, the manager for the night says that we can use the table all the way on the other side of the room, which is the same exact amount of chairs a few feet away from us. The manager wasn't very sympathetic and was not willing to meet our needs.  I am already sick to my stomach just thinking about it. The food was bleh, I ordered the fish tacos, my thinking mentality (quick and easy to eat) I was a starving marvin!!! Didn't get to the cheesecake yet because it is siting in my fridge, did not want to wait another hour to get my dessert although it is only feet away from my table."
Neil R.,"Honolulu, HI",28,56,23,5.0,8/19/2011,"Excellent service, excellent food & excellent environment! One problem...big portions may prevent you from trying their deserts. On Thursdays you can catch Simple Souls-great music. The waffles on Sunday are the best I have had in Hawaii. They validate for parking at the Royal Hawaiian. Line is long but it is worth it. Unfortunately, no Cheesecake Factory takes reservations. Nothing is perfect."
Jay R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,203,,4.0,9/13/2013,"09.02.13 with 9 others  Crowded place as it is located on the busy streets of wikiki, but to my surprise we had excellent service  the waiter was very nice, he was prompt to bring us all waters, and gave us time to figure out our orders. the food was good, as any cheesecake factory should be. no complaints here."
Cassandra T.,"Irvine, CA",120,110,33,5.0,11/4/2012,"From someone who lives in Orange county where we have 3 Cheesecake Factories to choose from, let me tell you this one ranks #1.  While on vacation we ate there almost every other day.  The best quality of seafood, the largest shrimp, freshest Ahi.  Can't stay enough about the food and the service was top nautch.  This amazing Hawaiian lady with a beautiful pearl necklace served us and was so genuine and helpful.  Make me sad I am out here when we crave Cheesecake factory but Fashion Island is a close second.  Nothing beats Hawaii's seafood at this restaurant. From the bottom of my heart Mahalo!"
Carolyn A.,"Melbourne, Australia",2,57,61,5.0,12/9/2013,Had to wait an hour but t was worth it. The fish tacos were great but we shared 3 pieces on cheesecake between 6 of us and they were all amazing. I highly recommend.
Glady O.,"Honolulu, HI",22,37,20,4.0,7/14/2011,"This was my first time here so I'm basing my review solely on first impressions. I'll update later on if I decide to go back for more, which I will.  One of my coworkers had suggested this place which is located in the trendy Royal Hawaiian Complex. My niece and I had to do some clothes shopping at Forever 21 (also suggested by my coworker) and she told me to go here since it's one of her favorite restaurants. Plus they validate. :)  The interior was nice, kinda cold, but they seated us closer to the lanai so the AC wasn't as strong there. My niece ordered the chicken quesadillas, which she loved, and i order the macadamia encrusted Opah with brown rice and sauteed veg. The brown rice and veg had this really tasty sauce that was great in the beginning, but began to get a little cloying towards the end. The fish too was overcooked and had a really fishy taste to it. Okay, I know that sounds stupid and I hate when people call fish too fishy, but this was the first time I've ever encountered this problem  and I've had Opah before. So now I know and I promise never to criticize anyone from ever saying it again. *I swear*  For dessert, we had the original cheesecake with strawberries. That alone was worth five stars. Really yummy, rich and tart. We both loved it. Will definitely be going back for that alone.  One thing I thought was funny was the bathrooms. They were REALLY chic. It had dark mood lighting and really spacious stalls. The music that was running through the restaurant was slightly muted in the bathrooms as well. So while I was doing whatever, I kept thinking how romantic. Which made me laugh because it's the bathroom to a restaurant. LOL."
