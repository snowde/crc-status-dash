Glenda R.,"Bolingbrook, IL",38,29,27,5.0,9/5/2011,"I love this cheesecake factory branch! Staff was very nice, food was delicious, CHEESECAKE was amazing!"
Emily H.,"Honolulu, HI",49,41,,5.0,9/1/2013,I know it's a chain but I love this place. They validate parking which helps. Sometimes the wait looks intimidating but it's not so bad. Just try to go before or after peak hours on the weekend! I love the food variety and love love love the cheescake. The Chicken enchilada soup thingy with rice was good. Mmmm.
Trisha A.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/26/2015,"The service was fine but the food was terrible!  Ordered the Fish and chips, half order and it was delivered with the fish being undercooked. The fish was soggy. Never been to a Cheesecake Factory on the mainland having been served. Substandard food:("
Jason C.,"Honolulu, HI",116,192,37,2.0,8/23/2010,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory several times at different locations and look forward my starter of a Well-Mannered Dirty Martini, it's one of the best dirty martinis I've had, made with Ketel One Vodka and Blue Cheese Stuffed Olives (those stuffed olives are ono and should be a pupu unto themselves!) and I like the end of the meal by enjoying a slice of Godiva cheesecake with coffee. The service is always good, but it's the meal itself I find not very satisfying. It's like every appetizer, soup, salad and entree is pushed through a Cheesecake Factory filter and what ends up on the plate is unsatisfyingly formulaic - there is a sameness to all the dishes.  Yes, the menu is vast and portions are large, but I just can't find the soul in the food, and that's a key ingredient for me."
Charlene L.,"Mililani, HI",0,11,2,1.0,3/9/2014,"Let's just say... They don't care about their customers. To them, we are just tourist. They seat us and then tell us we were seated wrong. This is the lamest place to eat in Waikiki"
Jared And Daisy T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",25,67,,4.0,3/30/2011,"We weren't too keen on going to a restaurant we could easily go to back in Florida, but we were hungry, it was lunchtime and The Cheesecake Factory was in front of us.  Not that TCF doesn't have good food, it's just when we're on vacation we prefer trying places we can't back home. TCF Waikiki however... yum.  Everything we ordered was great. The Memphis burger was overwhelming.  The mango pork pizza apparently had an issue in the kitchen and the manager came out to apologize about the delay and offered an on-the-house house salad.  More than made up for the 5 extra minutes we waited.  The pizza, while odd sounding, was out of this world.  Who knew such flavors could happily co-exist?  Our mouths are watering just thinking about it. And for dessert, an absolute MUST while you're in Waikiki - White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake with Caramel drizzle.  You'll seriously thank us later."
Haein P.,"Honolulu, HI",184,97,99,3.0,5/31/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is always a hit-or-miss place for me. Not due to the food, which I actually happen to love, but just due to the service and overall dining experience. Especially at this particular location, which is constantly busy and slammed with mobs of people, resulting in an almost always hour-long wait. FOOD: + love their complimentary bread (whole grain & sourdough) + their menu has such an overwhelming and impressive range that it is impossible not to find something you'll like + bang bang chicken & shrimp: definitely good if you like thai curries, it has a creamy coconut flavor, with the right spices and flavors (sweet, savory, spicy) over fluffy rice + miso-salmon: so well-prepared with a huge juicy and flakey salmon filet + cheesecake is always a must here, my favorites include pina-colada, dulce de leche, and white chocolate raspberry truffle SERVICE: I definitely dislike almost all the hosts/hostesses there since I find many if not most of them quite rude in how they handle their guests. I understand to a certain extent since I am also a host at a busy restaurant and it is hard to provide the best service with such a high volume of customers, but still! Plus, I hate how they just automatically ASSUME I am a Japanese tourist and hand me a Japanese menu, when I do not even speak Japanese whatsoever -__-  On the other hand, though I've had several times where I've had crappy servers, I had the most excellent waitress serve us on my most recent visit. She had a great sense of humor and despite how busy she seemed, she always had time to check up on us, make suggestions, chit-chat, and re-fill our drinks. AMBIANCE: nice, but pretty loud and most certainly way too crowded. It's the type of place you go occasionally just to avoid having to wait so long for food and being squished and pushed around by heaps of people around you, similarly waiting at the entrance to be seated"
Robert C.,"Honolulu, HI",17,32,65,3.0,9/28/2010,"Rating: 3.5/5 Date(s) Visited: 9/15/10 Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Price: 3/5 Located in the heart of Waikiki, it's only natural that Cheesecake Factory would be eternally busy. But is it worth the hour long - or more! - wait? That depends. If you're in Waikiki to do a little shopping and are looking for a place to eat afterwards, then yes, but if you're just looking for dinner, then probably not. Food: Their food quality is, by and large, good. Their menu items are vast and mostly original. Their menu is so large, in fact, that you'll be certain to overlook a lot of things that might spark your interest. I know I did. We ordered their ""Thai Lettuce Wraps"" which came with assorted vegetables, strips of chicken satay and coconut curry noodles along with peanut, sweet red chili and tamarind-cashew dipping sauce. This was my favorite dish out of everything we ordered since it was absolutely monstrous and rather flavorful (as long as you used the dipping sauces). I can say that I didn't much taste the coconut curry noodles and the only sauce that was worth my time was the peanut sauce, but other than that this dish was remarkable. Next came the ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"" which was surprisingly good. It's coated in a thin, slightly crispy bread coating and sprinkled with cheese. Breaking into the sphere of goodness, the cheese pulls apart from the edges like it does in those pizza commercials. The flavor was incredible; having a sharpness that tells you it's homemade, though the marinara sauce seemed to be the parsley of the dish. My friend ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes, claiming it was the best he ever had. Meh. I've definitely had better and their potatoes I found to be lacking proper seasoning (a bit of salt and pepper fixed that). I'd give this dish a pass unless you're really craving starches. The final thing we ordered (besides dessert and drinks, but that's later) was their ""Firecracker Salmon"". Now, I've made ""Firecracker Salmon"" as fillets for dinner, and I can say that I'm rather disappointed at the absolutely tiny portions we received and the stunning lack of flavor. It's more fizzle than firework. We got four pieces of salmon wrapped in fried wonton skins. The whole thing was about as thick as my thumb and not much longer (see:  ). It was served on a mountain of shredded purple cabbage. I felt like we were paying $13 to get $10 in cabbage and $3 in salmon. The sauce it was served with initially has no flavor, but then the heat arrives and soon departs. It's delicious for the few seconds where you can taste anything, but other than that the dish is a total flop. For the price, I wouldn't recommend it. For dessert we ordered we ordered the key lime cheesecake which tasted almost exactly like a key lime pie. Their whipped cream was made with real cream (because they whipped it too much and it had the faint taste of butter) and topped with a thin slice of lime. They had two giant scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side and I can only imagine how amazing it would have tasted with chocolate sauce. I suggest you get it with coffee, because having the bitterness of the coffee right after the tartness of the cheesecake is divine (although my friend said it sounded gross). My friend got their ""Pomegranate Mojito"", which looked delicious. Just as a warning, he said it was super strong and was later intoxicated for the rest of the evening. Then again, he's a lightweight so... Service: Aside from the absolutely ridiculous wait, the service here is good. The waiters are patient and professional. They don't hover and they're not constantly interrupting your meal. They see that you need a refill of something and get it. Atmosphere: I had the misfortune of sitting right next to their live performers, which made conversation next to possible. I guess that no matter where you sit in the restaurant, it'll be loud. The lighting is rather dim and very orange, which makes photographing food very difficult and next to impossible to color correct, but that's a photographer's complaint. Other than that, it's reasonably enjoyable. Price: The prices here are definitely a bit spendy. Although you can get some good values (e.g. Thai Lettuce Wraps), I feel like you'll miss more than hit with a lot of the things you'll find on the menu. When I looked at the bill and saw that my friend's drink had cost $11, I gasped and nearly had a heart attack. Then again, it's Waikiki and everything's expensive."
Donna L.,"Honolulu, HI",34,276,11,4.0,4/20/2011,"I was wandering around Waikiki on a weeknight with four mainland visitors in search of a late night bite to eat that would suit everyone. We came across the familiar Cheesecake Factory, went in and got seated right away. The wide selection of menu items worked out great for our little group. The portions were generous, the food was good, and the service was friendly and spot on. I had ""Evelyn's pasta,"" a vegetarian dish with lots of chopped broccoli, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, olives, and mushrooms over penne pasta. Other vegetarian options are salads, sandwiches, and pizza."
Jonn D.,"Honolulu, HI",21,528,98,4.0,12/29/2010,"Rating: 4/5 Date(s) Visited: 12/28/10, 2006, 2007, and a couple other times. Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Price: 3/5 Parking: 3/5 If you don't mind waiting 20-30 minutes or longer, then eat here.  I've waited as long as 1hr and 15min. I would definitely come here again. Food: Huge selection of everything.  I would check out their menu online before going to see what you might want to have ahead of time.  The menu is so overwhelming that you miss a lot of items. Service: Although our server was lacking the Aloha spirit, it was as if we were just another customer out of the millions that eat here each year.  We weren't rushed to get out or anything like that, but there was no personal interaction, other than what we wanted to order at the moment. Atmosphere: Both indoor and outdoor seating.  Close to the beach and a semi dim atmosphere in the restaurant.  Felt like I was in a Jazz Club.  There was live local music playing top 10 songs with a local twist. Price: Somewhat pricey, but worth it. Parking: Validated garage parking.  Hit or miss."
A A.,"Lomita, CA",81,21,8,1.0,4/18/2014,"Horrible wait time for dinner, had to wait 90 minutes, then a debacle with being seated by some fu€ked up hostesses. We were seated then, moved and moved over to the next booth over. Such a mess.  Seated next to a bunch of drunk Australians. Server was good food was ok. Don't think I will be coming back to this site. Got spoiled with the Redondo Beach location and the Las Vegas restaurants."
Glenn S.,"Honolulu, HI",25,26,,4.0,8/8/2011,"We had a mini stay-cation at the Moana Surfrider and decided to eat lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. Wait:  Arrived at 2:30pm (Yes, late lunch) and had to wait less than 5 minutes to be seated.  Score!  Appetizer:  Fried calamari with garlic aioli and cocktail dipping sauce - a little on the greasy side, however my 3.5 year old did not object as she was eating this like there was no tomorrow.  I prefer the cocktail sauce as it balanced out the greasiness, even though the batter was light. Entrees:  Barbecue chicken pizza - topped with red onions and cilantro (you could say their version of CPK).  I actually loved Cheescakes version of this CPK Classic.  TCF crust was lighter and the chicken was thinly sliced, compared to CPK which has chicken chunks and a tad thicker crust.  This alone made the pizza much more appealing to me.  Definately would order this again. BBQ Chicken salad - Don't get me wrong...I love CPK, however for some strange reason...out of the gazillion things you can order from the menu, we happened to get TCF versions of CPK food,  Haha.  So guess what???  Yes, I prefer TCF salad over CPK's.  Here's why.  The price for the full size salad at TCF costs less than CPK and TCF salad is BIGGER and tastes justs as good, if not a smidgen better.  Value! Dessert:  Linda's Fudge Cake - If you love chocolate, you will indulge in this!  Chocolate cake layered topped with fudge (of course) and chocolate chips on the back side and layered with chocolate frosting in between the layers of cake.  Rich & Delicious! Overall:  TCF has something for everyone and our server was fast and attentive which is always a + in my book since I have worked in this industry before.  I look forward to my next meal and need to try the coconut cheesecake that a friend recommended."
Michael H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",12,82,137,5.0,8/6/2013,A fantastic option for lunch (specials) located in downtown Waikiki. Patio seating with outdoor ambience yet air conditioned. Great location near International Marketplace and the beachfront.
Jhoren C.,"Honolulu, HI",377,441,406,4.0,12/5/2010,"1st time eating here....I know, I know where have I been?! well better late than never! I now understand why this place always get busy and the wait is about an hour long. WOW portions were very satisfying and priced  reasonable. I was amazed at how mountain high their salads were enough to feed 4 people! and I can't tell you enough on how heavenly their ultimate red velvet cheesecake tasted! I loved it so much I ordered one to go even though I didn't even finshed the one I ordered (only ate 1/2 of it) lol I am for sure coming back to eat here and sample more of their desserts until I reach CHEESECAKE COMA!!"
Michael M.,"Honolulu, HI",3,139,23,4.0,1/15/2013,"Lots of choices for food, all of which is good. The cheesecake is great. I'm giving it only 4 stars because of the LONG WAIT!  Call before you go to find the wait time and make reservations."
Auntie M.,"Kailua, HI",2,37,66,2.0,6/2/2011,"Food: Mediocre / Wait: Horrible / Service: Decent / Cheesecake: Yummy Again, not great enough to drive into Waikiki (from Kailua) for!!  Stopped by because we had a ""stay""cation in Waikiki this past weekend.  Overall:  It was just okay."
Ann T.,"San Francisco, CA",376,350,2972,4.0,5/12/2011,"came here for a late night munchie run. the bf and I split the following: BBQ kalua pork sammie w/fries - this was delish! the kalua pork was so tender and juicy! it was so flavorful, the BBQ sauce wasn't even needed! pineapple cheesecake delight - WOW. I went in with my mind set for a tiramisu cheesecake. our waitress told us what the 2 specials were, so this one sounded good. the pineapple was so freaking good!! needless to say, we finished our dessert quicker than we did our dinner. too bad this isn't available on the mainland. :("
Brent K.,"Honolulu, HI",31,398,121,3.0,6/17/2013,"I would give this place 4 stars just for the cheese cake! But not all the food is good, it's just ok. I have my favorites , But nothing super special to write home about. I like some salads, some main courses, service is good most of the times, A couple of times it was bad ! I know there busy, But basic service should be a standard. I'm just saying. I'll still be back for the salads."
Marylee M.,"Kaneohe, HI",3,5,1,4.0,10/15/2013,"I love the Thai Lettuce wraps, I think they have the best lettuce wraps. Be prepared it's always packed here we waited over an hour to be seated. The fried calamari is also good. The service is always great here. My daughter didn't let us know that she wasn't feeling good before we got here and threw up during the middle of our meal but at least out waiter Todd didn't get squeamish and was very helpful and brought lots of napkins and took the soiled ones away promptly. I don't like cheesecake but I always order a different one when I come here and is never let down. I wish there was another one so the lines/wait isn't so long and packed with tourist."
Aaron R.,"Kaneohe, HI",2,24,1,5.0,10/12/2013,"Huge selection of options in the menu and still yet in their cheesecake flavours. The food itself was good and the portions very large. The waiters/servers were very polite and knowledgable. The only slight hiccup is the wait. We went at lunch and were lucky to only wait 10minutes, but we often saw the line for dinner running along the entire storefront. However, this isn't the restaurant's fault. They have no control over their popularity or how long their patrons take. If it's full of people, that has to be a good sign! To beat the crowds, I don't recommend going at prime time though."
