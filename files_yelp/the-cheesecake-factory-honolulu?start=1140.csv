Q L.,"Honolulu, HI",73,11,,5.0,10/30/2014,Got a table for 2 in a few minutes. Seated at 455pm. Cory was our server and did a great job. Built rapport by asking where we were from and made sure we had a good understanding of the menu. We asked if we could still order a lunch special even though it ended at 5. he said it wasn't a problem and that he could make it happen . We were deciding between some appetizers and Cory made a strong recommendation for the avocado egg rolls (tasted awesome). Food timing was good. Table touches also very good.  Very happy with experience
Anuhea K.,"Mililani, HI",16,9,9,4.0,6/24/2014,"This place is GREAT! Such a wonderful environment, big area, lots of space & very clean. The waiters are so friendly. Ordered casual lunch so I could prepare myself for their huge variety of cheesecakes & enjoyed a delicious BAKED SNICKERS cheesecake! So mouthwatering & satisfying. Definitely coming back."
marissa t.,"Honolulu, HI",63,39,28,4.0,8/4/2010,"The wait is horrendous, but the cheesecake is worth it. Instead of waiting to sit down, occasionally I just eat somewhere else for dinner and get dropped off (then picked up again of course ) so I can get my cheesecake to go. My favorites include: -Vanilla bean -Red velvet -Pumpkin (seasonal)"
Kamesuke Y.,"Honolulu, HI",3,22,16,4.0,9/22/2011,"Not our first time to eat here.. and we were pleasantly surprised to not wait 3minutes to be seated... this has NEVER happened before!!  Service was great... waitresses were pleasant and warm and friendly. Our food was delivered very quickly and throughout our meal our waitress would kindly refill our Ice Tea glasses and water.. and ask if we needed anything. WOW....  Ceasar's salad was wonderful!!  Yes they were busy...as usually on a weekday lunch. I ordered their Magic Mushroom Burger with fries and wow was it GOOD! Cooked perfectly and the tasty mushrooms filled every bite!! Fries in a cup made me smile with joy!!  My wife had their Carbonara Pasta.. and we almost giggled on how good it tasted!! PURFECT!! They were busy and still they had the time and effort to ask us several times throughout our meal if we needed anything else.. and if we cared for dessert, how was the meal... WOW. You go guys!!"
Stuart W.,"Damascus, MD",2,86,,5.0,9/11/2013,"Awesome food, my wife and I ate here twice during our stay in Waikiki."
Daniel B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",429,63,26,4.0,7/30/2010,"OK to be honest, I'll give it 3.75 Stars, but rounds up to 4! :) What intrigues me is that people from all over the world come and flock to the Cheesecake Factory like it's some kind of Hawaiian tourist attraction... Wait, don't they have them everywhere?! With the crowd building up outside, we decided to walk on in to check in. Thankfully my friend was smart... skip the line and sit at the bar!  I chose the restaurant, Cheesecake Factory is her spot. I simply knew I was going to enjoy my meal.  The service here is fairly quick. Even with the vast amount of people that were there... our glasses of water were filled, we were checked up on, all with a warm smile.  On the menu: Pasta da Vinci (I think that's what it was called) with Broccoli & Hibachi Steak (mine). I freaked out at the sight of bean sprouts on which the Hibachi Steak sat on (I dislike bean sprouts) but it wasn't that bad. I'd like to say the steak was memorable, but it was just good. I did think the wasabi was an interesting twist as a topping on mashed potatoes. Dessert: Wild Blueberry with White Chocolate.  The cheesecake was nice and fluffy, not uberly thick like plain old cheesecake. It was decent, what disappointed me was that it wasn't fresh blueberries! But I guess I'm just a bit picky. Haha.  All in all, great atmosphere... Lively, Upbeat but just a bit dark in some parts. Here's a tip: bring out the cell phone to illuminate your journey through the menu when it's especially dark-there's simply a LOT to decide on."
Love K.,"Honolulu, HI",42,29,11,4.0,9/6/2010,"I love this place with all my heart! Maybe not the wait time so much, but definitely the food in its titanic proportions. There is always something for everyone to find in their booklet sized menu. We love their spicy ahi tempura rolls. The tuna is flash-fried in tempura, drizzled with a sweet/spicy and what tastes like mayo sauce, topped with scallions and served with a dipping sauce which has nice 'kick' to it. Their kids size pepperoni pizza is a full serving for one adult! And their red velvet cheesecake is to die for!  The only thing I was disappointed in was our waiter. He seemed to be very attentive to the other two tables next to us (5 ladies of which 1 of the 5 sent her entree back because it was prepared incorrectly and the other table who were tourists and who asked for separate checks). I guess this put our waiter behind because he would repeatedly check on them while passing by our table and not checking to see if were ok as well. We have a toddler. Aren't waiters suppose to more sensitive to families with children? However, one lousy waiter won't stop me from coming back here again and again!"
Riana S.,"Kapolei, HI",307,323,202,5.0,5/2/2010,"I love it here. One of my favorites! The mojitos are so good and they're not stingy either! My favorite is the Passion Fruit one. But I recommend any of them. The sampler appetizer is delicious. If you're going with more than 2 people, order this. The lemon-herb roasted chicken is AMAZING. Comes with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots covered in the amazing sauce. Tried the Dulce de Leche cheesecake, that was good. BUT... the best one I recommend to anyone is the Caramel White Chocolate Macademian Nut Cheesecake. I actually CLOSE MY EYES while I'm eating this cheesecake. Sad part is, I can only eat a few bites of it because I think if diabetes was an actual food item, this cheesecake would be it."
Katrina D.,"Kapolei, HI",138,52,61,4.0,9/12/2010,I used to always get the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake but ever since they've added the red velvet cheesecake it's all I get! No matter how full I am I will always make room for red v cheesecake! They also have sweet potato fries you can substitute for $1 more when you get a burger or sandwich :) which I highly recommend.  Also go at odd times so you wont have to wait an hour + for a table. We went around 430 for an early dinner and got seated immediately :)  Can't wait to go again!
Michael W.,"San Francisco, CA",5,278,2,4.0,5/19/2013,"Went here for lunch while visiting the area, we shared the calamari appetizer and each ordered a pasta dish all of which was very good. Staff was really nice too."
Carlos J.,"San Jose, CA",1,28,5,4.0,10/22/2013,"Super packed, it was a 2 hr wait when we went,  luckily we were able to score a 4 person table in the bar area. Our waitress was really friendly and our food was served in a timely manner."
Karen T.,"Honolulu, HI",15,241,8,3.0,6/3/2014,The food is good.  It always is-the best part about a chain restaurant is the food should always be just as good as the other locations.  It's just a bit pricey for what you get and you really should order apps because the food takes a long time to come out.
Cristy S.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",189,137,201,4.0,6/17/2012,"The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of the wait times. If you plan to go on a Friday or weekend you should expect to wait 1.5-2 hours for your table. One little trick if you are a party of 4 or less is to linger over by the bar and wait for a table there. That's what I did with my friends last night and the three of us were sitting down eating our delicious free bread in less than 30 minutes!! The food here is good and the price is not very high. I paid $19.50 for my meal incl. tip and couldn't finish it all (the portions here are HUGE) so I had lunch for the next day too! It's a great location because you can park at the Royal Hawaiian Center and they validate parking too. I also love it how it's right beside the 3-storey Forever 21 and Bebe and Tory Burch and Kate Spade... so even if you are waiting for a table you can shop around while you wait. For guys maybe that isn't so appealing but a girls night out at the Cheesecake factory is a lot of fun!! I like their salads too. They are fresh, GIANT size, and filling and average price around $15. So you can enjoy the hot baked bread and butter and a salad and hardly pay much at all."
Vanessa A.,"Daphne, AL",88,34,336,4.0,4/6/2013,Go to the bar for small parties to avoid the wait.. there are 2 bars... so check them both. Order cheesecake no matter what and the bang bang chicken is amazing. One of the bartenders (female) is one of the best in the company. She always has the best drink suggestions and small talk (I can't remember her name)
Michael R.,"Honolulu, HI",803,106,635,3.0,11/14/2012,"After a minor 20 min. wait, we were sat in the bar. Our server, Santana, was great! He was very honest about menu choices and tries to steer us toward the best entrees. The French Country salad was incredible...Mixed greens, goat cheese, candied walnuts (or pecans, I foget), the best beets I have eaten, and I am not a beet fan, and the house vinaigrette which is AWESOME! My wife had Chicken Castoletta (sp?) and I had the Fish and Chips. My wifes dish was very good and she had plenty left for lunch the next day (after I attacked her plate) and my Fish and Chips were decent, but nothing to scream about, as I had asked for well done and It was a bit soggy. The Wildblueberry Cheesecake with White Chocolate Mousse was great, and it better be since cheesecake is their namesake. All in all, I am not a fan of big crowds and if you are not you may want to stay away. If you like people watching, noise and reasonably priced, large amounts of food, then this is your place!"
Bethany D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,1.0,10/13/2013,"Once again they have failed to live up to my expectations. I always get the Shrimp with Angel Hair. A few months ago it was way too salty. This time the pasta was very underdone. When we mentioned it to our waiter,  he acted like we were tourists, which we aren't,  and don't know better.  you know there is an issue with the kitchen when the manager's first response is to ask you to try something different. Then to top it off they comped the bad meal but charged me for the replacement,  which although not bad, didn't really meet my wants that what I originally ordered would have."
Paul T.,"Maui County, HI",0,78,4,4.0,10/16/2012,"This is my 8th visit, since their opening.  I have never left unsatisfied, from the food or the  service.  This is the busiest Cheesecake Factory in the nation.  The secret is to arrive by five.  Usually, you will be seated immediately in one of  the comfy booths.  Wait til 6 and your handed a hand buzzer, and the waiting game begins.  I don't care what kind of appetite you have, if you order a pasta dish (delicious) you will have leftovers for your next mornings breakfast.  Wish we had one on Maui!  Afterwards, take a walk toward the Duke's statue, then cross the street and head back toward the International Market Place and check out the street performers."
Christie A.,"Honolulu, HI",11,20,5,5.0,9/25/2014,"Love it here. I always get the chicken picatta! Delicious! Great service, fun atmosphere, and in the heart of Waikiki! Save room for cheesecake, you can't go wrong with any of them."
Jonathan Y.,"Pearl City, HI",49,102,2,5.0,3/29/2013,Great food with great portions! Always a wait here and can go up to a 2 hour wait on a busy night. Always leave room for dessert here! Validated parking if you park in the royal hawaiian parking structure.
Earl N.,"San Diego, CA",51,10,1,5.0,6/4/2011,"One of the best restaurants I've been to. Awesome food, great selection, good service and big portions for reasonable prices. Even the live bands that they have are awesome. The only downside that I can think of is that there is almost always a wait time but there are a bunch of places in the area to shop and kill time at so that point doesn't really matter much.  All together a freakin' sweet deal for just about any occasion. Highly recommended."
