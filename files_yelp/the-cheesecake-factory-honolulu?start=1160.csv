Jarrod A.,"Honolulu, HI",37,10,2,5.0,6/2/2013,Love this place!!! Yes the menu is big but they have so much great food and the service is awesome!!! They will do anything to make you happy if something is wrong with your food! Ask for Tiffany A she is the best server and is always on her A game.
Sam W.,"San Francisco, CA",70,33,10,5.0,4/23/2013,"If I ever got to live Hawaii forever, I would go here EVERYDAY! OMG, the food is sooo yummy. So much better than the one I tried in California! :("
Henry C.,"Denver, CO",0,27,,3.0,9/24/2013,"Food was good! Crusted Macaroni and Cheese appetizer was very rich and creamy. The highlight of the meal. Service was very good. Our waiter was very attentive to our table. We ate during lunch service. This isn't necessarily a con, in a sense, but when you ask for a box, they actually take your plate away and box up your leftovers themselves. My question is, where do they do it? In the kitchen somewhere? Is there an exclusive Boxer person who's specialty is to box up food? Does the server do it him or herself (what if you upset the server, will they botch your leftovers with spit or something)? Seems kind of shady. Once it's boxed up they put it in a bag and tie the bag up, so keep that in mind if you have leftovers, or just finish your plate. Minus 1 star. Recommendation to any couples going in to eat: Request a booth. I repeat, request a booth and if the wait is extra for that, then so be it. You will thank me. If you do not request one you may be seated in a section of the restaurant where tables for two are all setup in close proximity to each other and you will pretty much be dining with other couples. It's very awkward and hard to carry on a conversation because other couples can hear you, and visa-versa. Minus 1 star. Other than that, it was a pretty a-ok visit to the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki!"
Johnny C.,"Honolulu, HI",28,30,,3.0,5/22/2013,"the family and I went there for my barfday. I don't know if Ive gotten older and grumpy or my doctor says I need to eat healthier or Im just allergic to Waikiki and all the tourist. But I felt like shit after my heavy meal there. Couldn't wait to get home but was stuck in the parking structure because something went wrong with out parking ticket. I honestly feel like I never want to go to any food establishment to Waikiki. Note to self......stay out of tourist traps. I was so discussed to see families from afar gorging on the meals with their sun burns and matching Aloha shirts. Kids screaming and people rubbing elbows. getting accosted by sales people selling stuff at those booths on our way to a from the car to restaurant. enough is enough. Im pau. were gonna stay home and never leave our house,."
Jack B.,"Honolulu, HI",6,22,,5.0,9/23/2011,"Thats the one place I can always count on, with the exception of Ton Katsu Ginza, to always hit it out of the park.   Everything on the menu is quality and delicious.  The staff is always nice, and for the quality of food they serve, the price is very reasonable. Their crispy chicken sandwiches are still the best I've ever had!  So juicy and tender..... And their desserts are awesome!"
Allen H.,"Honolulu, HI",2,24,12,1.0,7/10/2013,"Terrible!  Overpriced and mainland attitude.   Drinks were terrible, food marginal, they were ""out"" of most of the things we ordered.   Bar tender was sweet, but alcohol obviously watered down.   I won't spend money here again.   Next time we go for a date it won't be here."
Matthew K.,"Kaneohe, HI",45,76,,2.0,8/2/2012,Long waits to be seated. Long waits to order and the environment looks so dark and dank that I went there when I was tired after work for my friends birthday and fell asleep at the table waiting for my food. The cheese cake is good though.
Fernando G.,"Honolulu, HI",28,141,80,5.0,4/8/2011,"how can i not opt in giving such venue its well earned five stars ? in my very own opinion ""mojitos"" as well as local fresh fish helps TCF earn its every star.   i love ""opa;' crusted or not.  i love noodles; soft or fried.  i love seating by the bar; super crowded -- loud or not.  simply put, i just love having my share of fun while enjoying my food. serious people watching takes place from beginning to end every time my friends and i visit.  plus, bread is a winner -- regardless of who am with or who stares my way. my sense of ""shame"" seems to quickly dissipate as every coat of butter half covers my delicious pieces of warm whole wheat bread.  seriously, i absolutely love it !  :)  as i often seem to prefer fresh fish -- i have tried other waikiki venues in search of it, to this day TCF has never disappointed me.  my friends have gone so far as ordering non local fish -- and even though i am not a salmon aficionado,  even salmon (today) was as delicious as has been tuna and my all time favorite. OPA !  yummm one of my observations as of lately is that the craziness of eternal waits for a desired table are long gone.   i applaud the management team for i seem to no longer experience delays when finding a place to seat.   again,  i enjoy seating at the bar.  perhaps what helps best is ""being tactful"" when speaking to the host help.  haha   as the saying goes:  ""ask and you shall receive.""  right ?   :) the benefit i find in seating at the bar is that even when the bartenders are busy doing what they are called to do:  bar tend,  they are all well versed regards the food they suggest and the sequence of service.   never have i left the bar without having had at least two to three of their well prepared mojitos.  yup ! plus, latent recommendations on ""CK"" desserts are always ultra tempting.  only thing tho, today, i already had had plenty of sinful ""whole wheat"" bread and lots of butter with it.  hence,  to balance my guilt affair,  i went ""sans dessert."" instead,  i had me one last mojito.   salud !  :)    all in all,  an amazing lunch experience.  again !"
Tad A.,"Aiea, HI",103,21,1,5.0,5/1/2012,"First of all before I start my review.  I'd like to say shame shame to some other yelpers out there.  Giving this place a 1 star rating for basically being too busy!!  I mean, how is that their fault?  And yah they don't take reservations boo hoo.  Why not try having an earlier then usual dinner?  I go there at 5 sometimes at 4:30 or later at night at 9, to avoid the huge crowds.  Honestly, establishments are always better off without whiny childish customers anyways.  Who purposely seeks to damage the reputation of a fine business, just because they can't get their way.   *exhales* Now to my review.  The menu is huge!  If you are a first timer to cheesecake factory and am the indecisive type.  Then I recommend you visit their website and take a look at their menu there to give you an idea on what you might like.  Because we're talking about a 6-8 page menu here.  Because of the crowdedness, it is rather a loud atmosphere.  So a nice quiet romantic dinner with your loved one is probably out of the question.  But the food is awesome.  The quality of food is as great as the variety of choices available.  My favorite is the steak diane!  Forget the rib eye.  Yah it's that good!  I used to frequent CCF in Vegas when I lived there.  And I'm pleased to see that the one here is just as good as the one in Vegas.  Especially concerning the steak.  The crowd at CCF will always remain a constant factor WHATEVER state you're in.  You just gotta go early or go late to get around that."
Brian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,743,176,2.0,7/8/2010,"The only time I go is when friends from overseas are visiting and they insist on eating here.  I just don't get what is so wonderful about the place.  Ok, some of the dishes are well made, but even they are not worth the long wait.  I guess if you enjoy eating portions that are 2-3x larger than necessary this is the place for you.  I read that the Pasta Carbonara with chicken has 2500 calories! That is disgusting and we wonder why 60% of the population is obese.   I guess it is fine if you split 2 or 3 ways.  Service is also sometimes a problem because they are so busy.  On the plus side, they do validate parking in the garage next door."
Isis B.,"Honolulu, HI",104,32,4,3.0,2/8/2011,"Just stopped by there for lunch the other week, and still as crowded as ever. Might have been because of the Pro Bowl...but anyhoos, got seated in about 15 minutes - not too shabby.  Ordered the lunch size portion of their kalua pig pizza and Caesar salad. THANK GOD!! The salad was sooo huge, I only got to eat one slice of pizza. And the one slice was, meh, not bad. But still, a great deal on price. Our server was pretty damn good considering it was his first day going solo...but then again, maybe it was because he was being watched.  I've tried other dishes and haven't been disappointed. I do love their cheesecake. I think my problem is that there's just too much to choose from on both their regular menu and dessert menu! But, all in all, a great place to eat."
Michelle L.,"Honolulu, HI",857,554,237,4.0,8/5/2008,"The wait is always ridiculous there.  I went on National Cheesecake Day so I suppose it was understandable to wait an hour or so for a party of four.  A former coworker of mine works there and I asked our hostess, she was really helpful in finding out for me and even checked the POS to double check.  Our server was amazing!  She was SUPER friendly and conversed with us even when it was slammin' there.  I give it four stars for the great service for this previous visit. Food portions are HUGE and it was ok.  Typical American food.  Oh man, the $1.50 cheesecake was a steal!  They ran out of the popular flavor but I took home the Godiva cheesecake.  Really rich but delicious nonetheless.  My table shared the Raspberry Lemon one.  It is melt in your mouth YUMMY!"
Trish P.,"Honolulu, HI",182,414,1703,3.0,7/12/2010,"i usually avoid this place b/c  1. i dont like tourists (yeah, i know they boost our economy, blah, blah, blah....) 2. i dont like having to waiting 2 hours plus to eat.  wtf. but, as it was a special occasion, i decided to brave the tourists and endure the freakishly long wait. browsing through the PAGES AND PAGES of menu selections, i settled on the ""crispy spicy beef"" which was neither crispy nor spicy, and came with way too much vegetable filler.  the flavor itself was good, but jesus = wheres the beef in this vegetable medley? also shared the sweet corn tamale cakes as an appetizer - those things are AWESOME.  whatever type of food crack cocaine they put in there is working b/c i want me more of that! and.... shared a red velvet cheesecake slice.  this thing was rich and put me into a diabetic coma.... but thats why you eat the cheesecake here isnt it? if you like, try the Georgia Peach drink (but watch out, its $10!!!) or a Flying Gorilla.... its like a banana chocolate milkshake...with alcohol. our server was ditzy and a little rude.... minus star for that!  and they dont take reservations - lame"
Lorraine Y.,"Honolulu, HI",33,22,17,4.0,9/12/2011,"Love the food here but be prepared to wait a while for your party to be seated. This is no joke, we actually waited 45min one night. Thank goodness we were able to kill some time walking around the shopping center. For that reason alone, I deducted a star. But if you are willing to wait, like most people.... go for it! It is well worth it.  I usually like the egg rolls, steak diane, chicken salad and of course! CHEESECAKES!! yumm! The salad portions are huge so keep that in mind when ordering as well."
Joseph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,181,18,4.0,1/12/2011,"The lady who was serving us was really nice. But despite me and my two friends being Koreans, two of them had alfredo/pesto-based pasta while I had a cajun-based pasta. I didn't have a problem but two of them had that ""Oh I am sick of this now"" look on their faces, and the lady offered them a bottle of tabasco sauce, which brought smiles to their face. I also remember getting a fruit smoothie which was absolutely amazing. Three of us I think paid around $68 dollars, which I believe included tip. Rather reasonable for a group of three going to Cheesecake Factory at a tourist city of Honolulu. Very busy throughout the day (tourist location duh!) but there are so much to do in this city as a tourist. Besides, the restaurant itself is pretty spacious"
Marcel N.,"Fullerton, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/24/2013,"The waiting time was 1.5 hours. Service friendly but served two out of five meals wrong. Seating was freezing cold and dark. Service tried to fix it, but it didn't work out. Meals basically were tasteless.  We got a piece of cheese cake as compensation for the wrong served meals. The so called ""cheesecake"" does not deserve the name cheesecake at all. The white bread before the meals tasted like edible paper. We received our bill while we were still eating.  All in all this was the first and last time we have been there."
Dani F.,"Charles Town, WV",0,14,,4.0,8/29/2013,"Great food, lots of choices, and great service. I went for lunch a few days ago and returned with my husband for dinner last night. I had the salmon miso for lunch, and the salmon salad for dinner. He had a burrito. The service was excellent. Brittney was very attentive and even though the place was crazy busy we had no wait for a table and a very short wait for our dinner.  The price was very reasonable and the food was great."
Unda C.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,5,,4.0,11/21/2013,Skip the wait. Go to the bar.  No wait -   Get in line for a table - don't take my seat at the bar
Melissa T.,"Kapolei, HI",33,51,37,4.0,2/17/2011,"My roommate and I just came back from the Cheesecake Factory tonight for one of my roommates 21st birthday. We had so much fun! The staff was great! I mean so welcoming and so help full. The manager came out and told my roommate who was wearing a tiara ""We are almost done cooking and preparing your food your majesty."" and he bowed. It was hilarious and so cute! Other than tonight, whenever i come here i get great service. The staff is great and very entertaining. Pros: -The food! The food! The cheesecakes! -The staff is great -The atmosphere is awesome -They have a book asa menu, theres so many choices! -Their drink selections are awesome for those 21 and over. -The free bread they give :) Cons: -The wait, but theres nothing they can really do about it. Food I've ordered and recommend: -The Da Vinci Pasta -Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic -Jambalia Pasta -Thai Peanut Pasta -Oreo Cheesecake -Tiramisu Cheesecake -Godiva Cheesecake -Red Velvet Cheesecake -Dolce De Leche Cheesecake Overall, i recommend coming here at least once in a while since the wait is so long especially for dinner. But its a great place to go if you're in Waikiki with your friends :)"
Mike S.,"Las Vegas, NV",143,199,6,4.0,4/16/2013,"I don't know why I'm surprised at the quality of the food every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory. It's like there's a tiny little hipster, trapped in my brain, saying, ""Don't go to the big chain restaurant, they suck."" And, when I silence him, and go, I'm always pleased. The Kobe burger is DEFINITELY worth ordering. (As is the Big Island Iced Tea... worth ordering a couple of those, really...)"
