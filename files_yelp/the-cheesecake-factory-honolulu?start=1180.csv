Seth H.,"Honolulu, HI",20,182,,4.0,4/24/2012,"Words of advice on getting to the parking lot, I would go on Kuhio Ave either way taking a right or left depending from what direction you are coming from on Royal Hawaiian Ave. following the sign directing you to the parking garage for the shopping center not the hotel.  The reason to go this way is so you don't have to try the awful right turn off of Kalakaua before onto Royal Hawaiian Ave; tourist are constantly crossing giving no time for the cars to turn.  Also don't forget to pay ahead of time in the parking structure at one of those machines before driving to the exit, I'm aware that Cheesecake does validate but that time gets eaten up in waiting and eating really fast."
Stephanie F.,"Millbrae, CA",14,36,,4.0,8/3/2010,"I can't believe how busy this chain always is. I'm usually not a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but this time it won me over.  We waited 1.5 hours on a Sunday night but there's lots of shops to step into since it's right on the Waikiki strip. Once we were seated, the service was excellent and our server was super friendly. She made sure we always had everything we needed and stopped to talk a bit even though it was packed. For this type of restaurant the food was pretty good. Our table split the spinach artichoke dip and it was gone before our server could ask how it was. I had the steak Diane and shrimp scampi combo--it came with 3 shrimps, 3 steak medallions, and a huge serving of mashed potatoes. It could definitely be split along with an appetizer between 2 people. We didn't have any room for dessert, but we went back to get cheesecake to-go a few days later. We got a slice of chocolate mouse cheesecake and one of chocolate raspberry truffle. Both were so good if you need a chocolate fix. The whipped cream that comes with each slice is also delicious."
Sher M.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,21,3,4.0,10/25/2013,"Love the Cheesecake Factory!  Huge menu.  Favorite is the carrot cake cheesecake.  Service a bit slow and there's always a wait, but worth it."
Fernando M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,36,,3.0,8/1/2011,"April 24, 2011 Well, it's a Cheesecake factory! Doesn't change much from location to location. Good food, pretty much the same price. And of course popular!!! This cheesecake factory is jammed pack though. Don't come if your hungry, come knowing you'll be hungry in 2-3 hours because that's how long you'll be waiting. It is cheaper than eating in the other near by restaurants and you get a great portion of food as well, so this may also contribute to it's popularity. So, just as good as any other cheesecake, great friendly staff, but if you plan on eating here, plan on waiting. Normally a 4 Star, but minus one for the extremely long wait!"
Anna B.,"Honolulu, HI",125,3,,3.0,7/29/2013,"The food seems overpriced, but it's actually pretty decent sized portions. It was really dark in there though. Also, the waiters were pretty much nonexistent. The food was average and the salads were extremely plain. Probably wouldn't go back for a sit down meal. Maybe just to get cheesecake to-go."
Grace M.,"New Hope, PA",15,100,2,3.0,7/17/2012,"People: I love the Cheesecake Factory as much as the next person (the miso salmon is the best anywhere) but YOU ARE IN WAIKIKI, for gosh sakes! Eat something you can't get back on the mainland! Expand your horizons! Take a chance! You've got some of the best Japanese, seafood, and local Hawaiian cuisine anywhere in the world and Chinatown is only a 10 minute cabride away...I feel so sorry for the people eating here because they have so little imagination and miss so much by going so far from home yet sticking with the familiar."
Stan L.,"Redwood City, CA",0,73,,1.0,3/27/2014,"WARNING!!! Unless your kids love this place, stay away. Huge lines every night 45 minute wait is nothing here, we went there like everyone else, has to be good. No it's average food at best, I can read the bible faster than this menu, any chain that has that many items is not going to be good. It's probably in the best location on waikiki but you have so many better choices, walk down to lewers street, pf changs, yard house etc. if you want the best & don't mind spending more money, go to Roy's, Ruth's Chris or Nobu."
Amy V.,"Lahaina, HI",74,251,115,5.0,3/26/2012,Hit the bar late night and had the most amazing Carrot Cake Cheesecake!!  Would definitly go back :)
Alvin P.,"Mililani, HI",6,7,,4.0,1/16/2012,"Okay, as someone who lives quite far from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, I come out here once in a while to eat at The Cheesecake Factory (mainly because a lot of my friends like going here and it's either this or Zippy's.) Anyways, besides what everyone else is saying about the (at-times) ridiculous wait times, the food and service here is pretty good! There has never been a time when I was utterly dissatisfied with the food and/or service we got. Hosts and waiters are extremely friendly (my host made a joke about how she wouldn't be able to fit into my skinny jeans as she led us to our table) and the waiters are very friendly, are quick to answer any questions you may have on their diverse menu, and don't pester you to hurry up and scram once you finish your meal (we were still eating even though the restaurant was closed.) I got the Chicken Bellagio, which wasn't HOLY SH*T(!) spectacular, and a bit bland for my taste, but it was still the same level of quality I've come to expect from The Cheesecake Factory. Here's a tip: if you're here for the first time, you may think that their dishes are a bit pricey for what you're seemingly getting, but damn, it's like the restaurant is planning on fattening you up to cook you, because the portions here are HUGE. Therefore, if you and your friend are both ""eh...kinda hungry but not really,"" then I highly suggest splitting an entree because both of you will probably be full, happy, content, and all that jazz. If not, just ask your waiter to pack up the rest of your food in a doggy bag and heat it up the next day at work or something. Every single time I've been here, I never been able to finish all my food in one sitting. And trust me, I have the appetite of a ravenous gorilla. Parking is also super convenient. Free with validation at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. I haven't really tried their cheesecake before so I can't really comment on that (which would probably defeat the purpose of this entire review) but oh well! Happy eating!"
Jennifer R.,"Buena Park, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/24/2015,"Where to begin...  We ordered our food and drinks then had to wait a long time to receive the drinks.   The side salad arrived one minute before or meals so we never really had a chance to eat the salad.   My shrimp scampi was cold.   Not even room temperature.   Shrimp was cold,  sauce was cold,  and even stuck my finger in the pasta... Cold!   After waiting for our disappearing waitress to reappear,  she took the meal and the manager stopped by to find out who had the cold meal.   After our entire party was done eating,  my hot meal arrived.   I quickly ate the shrimp,  but had to take the pasta to go since everybody was waiting on me.   So once again,  my pasta will be cold by the time I get to eat it.   The bill arrived and my meal was not comped or discounted.... No,  I'm sorry for your meal,  please enjoy a slice of cheesecake.   This situation was not handled correctly and I will be contacting corporate.   Be ready for cold food and bad service!"
Jon P.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,5,,5.0,11/27/2013,"Worth the wait! I  was told some stories about the wait being long,  but it was definitely worth it!  This is my wife's and my new place to celebrate special occasions... ending the meal with some awesome  Reeses  cheesecake!"
Keoni U.,"Ewa Beach, HI",56,234,38,3.0,11/10/2010,"Been here a couple times. Last time I was with my family so we needed a table for 7 adults and 3 kids. They said the wait was 45 minutes. The pager goes off at 30 minutes. Our entire party was not there so they asked if we (2 adults, and 2 kids) wanted to be seated and said we'd wait. They saved our table for us while we were waiting for the rest of our family which was cool. I think the family area (if you have kids) is in the far back in the bar area. Another nice thing about this location is that you can eat outside. The menu is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. If you have kids watch out for those idiots who don't give a sh!t and smoke their cigarettes while you wait for your table."
Krystal W.,"Fort Meade, MD",1,29,6,4.0,3/1/2011,"I am not even going to go into the wait, it's Waikiki at night...what do you want? The rest... in a word Deeelish! The pomegranate martini is always my first request. The pom mojito runs a close second.  That out of the way we move on the the appetizers, have yet to find one that wasn't superb on the menu.  We order several and graze. There is something for everyone, the fish and poke are great if you want to go for the island feel.  Not that daring?  Burgers are fantastic.  Haven't tasted a cheesecake I didn't like so this is nirvana."
Ryan C.,"Orangevale, CA",11,3,,1.0,4/14/2013,"Awful customer experience. Wait time was longer than we were told. Then they ""couldn't find"" our ticket for us to be seated. We were told a wait time of one hour, and with everything, it ended up taking an hour and a half. No apologies or any attempt to make the situation better. Really disappointing. Poor customer service from the front desk. The rest was mediocre."
David O.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,13,8,1.0,11/15/2014,"It's been almost an hour and still waiting on our food. 3 couples who sat down waaaay after us already got theirs, and one had already left. Highly disappointed and lost our appetite. Cancelled our order, no sense of waiting any longer than we already. Such I shame we waited over an hour in line for this!"
Erika A.,"Honolulu, HI",482,146,179,5.0,12/2/2009,"I just gave Cheesecake Factory 5 stars. I hardly ever give anything 5 stars. I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm giving a national chain a 5 star rating. This is a place I don't even come to voluntarily (please see my below rating for reference to BF dragging me here: ) But their customer service and attention to detail should give them an extra star.  OK, here goes: We went back last night. We ordered Buffalo Blasts. They were delicious. This place has THE BEST BLUE CHEESE DRESSING. Hands down. Great dressing base and then tons of fresh blue cheese. Anyway, we also had the Steak Diane/Madeira combo and a BBQ Chicken Salad. All were, as always, really really tasty.  This is why I'm bumping the Factory up a star:  My salad was a little late getting to the table. Ok, not a good reason to give them an extra star, but the manager came out with my salad. He told me they had to make another salad because mine had been sitting there. They messed up on the original order. No biggie. It wasn't even that bad of a wait. The manager apologized. I accepted and continued on happily with my food. At the end of the meal, we ordered a cheesecake to go. The bill arrived and the server said the cheesecake was COMPED because of my wait for the salad. Wow! Thanks! You just voluntarily gave me a slice of cake. On our way out, the manager ran into us and double checked that we were happy when leaving. He apologized again and hoped we were content with the free dessert.  The Cheesecake Factory is always on their game. Mistakes are going to happen though and when the do, they really step up to the plate and muthafuckn deliver. Obviously this place has the means to give me a free slice of cheesecake, but it's the thought that counts. And I didn't even complain about the wait for my food.  I didn't even have to beg mercilessly for something free because I had been ""inconvenienced"". It's not too often there's customer service like that anymore. Big up to the manager for following through. This place rocks."
Tracy P.,"Honolulu, HI",80,122,59,4.0,11/16/2012,"Chain restaurant, same as any other Cheesecake Factory.  This one doesn't have a happy hour.  The prices also seem higher to me than what I remember from the mainland. Maybe I forgot or it's a little higher due to the tourist location.  Large portions and good food."
Scott M.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",27,255,5,3.0,8/3/2010,"I am being generous giving this place 3 stars because it is someplace between ""meh, I've experienced better"" and ""A-OK"". We wouldn't come here, especially on vacation in HNL if we didn't get dragged by local friends who think of it as a treat away from the local places they love. The Good Side:  The food is alright, not great, but not bad. It is over salted, but the portions are generous and with a menu just a bit shorter than War & Peace, you have to find something you like. 84 Entrees, 50 Appetizers? That is kind of on the bad side of the good side. I'd rather they do 12 entrees really well, 8 appetizers really well and be done with it. Also on the good side are the deserts and of course the cheesecakes. The Bad Side:   The wait. There always seems to be a line here, we have never walked in, 30 minutes is a short wait, 1 hour isn't uncommon and I've heard of 90 minutes and more. This food is not worth a ten minute wait, let alone 30-40 or more. If you could walk in, be seated in 10 minutes, I might say ""yeah, I am a fan"", but at the wait times here, it is just okay. More bad is the servers, they seem indifferent to doing a good job, personable, nice and all that, but just not that good. If you've waited 45 minutes, you might be hungry and thirsty. Take drink orders right away, check for appetizers off hand and ask again about appetizers when you bring the drinks. Maybe because they get so many tourists they know they'll never see again they don't feel compelled to excel. Maybe they are not well trained or managed. Maybe because they get so many Aussies who don't know how to tip.....  whatever it is, it needs to change to get better. After you've waited 45 minutes, you don't want to wait 35 more for the first morsel of food, but with 50 appetizers, they don't pre-make much. With 148 outlets on the mainland and so many great local places with fresh local food, I wouldn't put this place in my top 20 places for tourists."
August A.,"Honolulu, HI",94,93,21,4.0,11/3/2010,"I've been coming here since its inception in Hawaii. I already have the Cheesecake Factory (CF) experience from traveling so I expected the same or better. Hawaii's CF is very much better. The environment and ambiance reigns true in most CFs around the country but Hawaii's includes an island flare, with CLEAN, large dark lit rooms (almost like a nightclub) with lauhala fans, and open air dining available. The food is fantastically simple, yet extremely tasty. I usually order a factory burrito (sans the rice and beans) and deep fried mac and cheese to which I recommend to everyone. Other notable choices are the furukaki salmon and ribeye.  Service is impeccable, every server is willing to answer questions and refill your drink. So please tip well all my fellow yelpers.  The only problem is the crowds during the dinner rush. Lunch time is much more relaxed. I still find myself waiting in long lines simply for the cheesecake. Godiva cheesecake and the Passion fruit cheesecake are the best. Everyone should come here, please check it out."
Cy C.,"Honolulu, HI",277,228,20,4.0,9/23/2010,"In the words of Homer Simpson...ohhhhh cheesecake! Yes I know Homer says donuts, but I feel the same way when I see their cheesecakes. Okay with a name like Cheesecake Factory the cheesecakes better be good. Yes it lives up to their name, every cheesecake I had is delicioius. Okay so we know the cheesecake is good but what else. Well here is my theory if you gotta stand in line and receive a pager and wait to be called, the wait better be worth it. I first went to CF in LA with my friend. I fell it love with it from the beginning. Portions are huge! Now it does not have the best tasting food, but with cheesecake lurking it always help. Great staff and open atmosphere! My favorite food include the sheppard's pie, bang bang chicken and pasta. Now if this place wasn't in Waikiki would it do well? Heck yeah locals love large portion. Oh wait did I mention it has cheesecakes? For heavon sake, you gotta check out their Cheesecake!"
