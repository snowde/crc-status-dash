Hyoin L.,"Waikīkī, Honolulu, HI",0,1,,4.0,12/22/2017,"I visited in this  place with my family. Overall, price&taste are good for traveller but it takes a long time to wait."
Ata T.,"Liliha - Kapalama, Honolulu, HI",81,15,,3.0,9/25/2017,"I do like the Cheesecake Factory but this last time was not a good experience. Showed up for early dinner, got seated immediately, great! Ordered some appetizers, great stuff and enjoyed it. Ordered out entrees and it was good but quite salty. Because we had appetizers and wanted to save space for dessert, asked the server to pack our entrees, which each of us only ate half of. The server took the plates but didn't take mine because her hands were full and said she was coming back for it. Another server, later found out it was a busboy, took my plate. About 10 minutes later, the original server brings everyone's doggy bags, but not mine. I see the busboy that took my plate and ask him if my food was packed. He actually blamed me, that I didn't say I wanted it packed. The nerve. I already asked my original server, who said she was coming back for my plate, my plate was more than half full, and shouldn't the worker ask ME if I wanted to take it home, especially with so much food on my plate? The busboy actually blamed me 3 times and said he was going to call the manager, who never came. My real server apologized and gave me a new, full order of my meal to take home."
Maile K.,"Honolulu, HI",56,142,477,5.0,4/10/2016,"Opted to have an dinner here due to unused gift cards. We decided to head over around 4:30pm on Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is known to get extremely busy between 5:30 and 6:00 pm. The wait can be excruciating, especially on an empty stomach.   We parked in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center garage, which, connects to the Sheraton's parking garage via stairs. (The validations are different for each lot, so mind the signs.) All parking fees in the RHSC garage must be pre-paid at the kisosk near the elevators in the garage. There is no parking attendant on duty down the ramp that you can pay, if you forget. Be prepared to walk a bit to the restaurant as the garage is at the other end of the shopping center. Upon our arrival to the restaurant at 4:45 pm, we were quickly seated. If you have a seating preference, state it to the hostess right away. The restrooms are located down a corridor before the kitchen.  The noise level is pretty loud. The menu. Extensive to say the least. Eggs and omelettes are served all day. There is a Sunday Brunch menu within the main menu, and also a lunch menu.  We began with house bread (sourdough and a dark oat bread) and butter, and an order of fried calamari. A bit on the salty side, but worked well with the garlic aioli and cocktail sauce. The morsels were lightly breaded and fried. Not at all chewy and tough. Very soft and pleasant to the palate. A+ Do not take the lunch menu lightly by expecting a tiny portion. You will be more wrong!  I chose the Chicken Piccata, lunch portion, because I wanted dessert, of course!  Three nice size pieces of the most flavorful, tender & juicy chicken in a lemon butter and caper sauce and a very generous portion of angel hair pasta.  A+ Limoncello Cream Torte traveled very nicely home. The whipped cream held up quite well and was very creamy. The cake was dense and sweet and the cream between the layers was tart. The frosting on the outside of the torte had some crunchies in it, which gave it a nice contrasting texture. A+ Just over an hour and we were out the door. So many people in the lobby and outside waiting for  a table. Yikes! Good idea to go early!"
Dom B.,"Everton Park, Australia",0,2,,5.0,12/20/2017,"Amazing service, huge value for money meals and the cheesecakes are to die for!! Make sure you visit on a very empty stomach!"
Lynn P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,10,5.0,8/12/2017,This review is solely on our food and service.  Let me start by saying that our server Denise was fantastic! She was very attentive and made great food suggestions for us. She was a bright light in such a chaotically busy restaurant.   After an hour wait to get a table we were thrilled that the food & service was so good. We'll be back!
Samantha J.,"Diamond Head - Kapahulu - St. Louis, Honolulu, HI",19,5,1,5.0,11/4/2017,"Service was absolutely amazing! Food was delicious and huge portions! Although I was stuffed, I couldn't pass up a cheesecake for desserts. Mm mm!! I had the celebration cheesecake and it was Devine!"
Trina C.,"Burke, VA",0,11,,5.0,12/15/2017,"Really really best food we have had in any Cheesecake Factory ! Guacamole rocked . Chicken quesadillas were too good as was veggie burger, great place for vegetarians server was very sweet too !"
Mavenice B.,"Honolulu, HI",25,13,59,5.0,4/3/2017,"5 stars because of the food and awesome service, but if you have over 12+ people you'll be waiting for a long time. We waited for almost 3 hours but when your in a group of 5 or less, waiting hour for you is faster but make sure to check in right away and you can go a head shop since forever 21 is next door.  FOOD!!! My favorite is the Chicken Madeira and always get the mango smoothie! It's pretty big the portion but I always finish mines XD  Shrimp Scampi is always great can always share with everyone since every portion is pretty big and expensive. Great place for a date since it's dark and depending on where your sitting, live band singing while you eat."
Jay T.,"Austin, TX",181,260,2055,4.0,3/15/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory because of their food; especially different cheesecake flavors!  The restaurant is located in the heart of Waikiki. Park at the Royal Hawaiian where the first hr is free w/ validation while the rest is $2/hr!   Cheesecake Factory is pretty spacious and can hold a lot of guests, although, not big enough for the non-stop traffic (both tourists and locals) in Waikiki. This is right next to forever 21 and across from Macy's, therefore, shopping while waiting is an option.  They do not take reservations and the lines are always long! But for someone surrounded by Asian and local restaurants and loves (everything else but that) American food, the wait is bearable for me. I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and never failed to receive good service. Ambiance is up to par and can be intimate in the evenings while food on the other hand is always good. They have great food varieties, although, my favorite appetizer personally is the avocado roll while salted caramel for the cheesecake, but of course those are both personal preference since everything, I think, is good. Lastly, you will also get your money's worth out of their alcohol beverages because it's strong! You can really taste the alcohol in it specifically in the margaritas. All in all, I recommend Cheesecake Factory with or without long wait times."
Dave F.,"Aiea, HI",775,414,2296,4.0,3/12/2017,"If the Cheesecake Factory weren't so darn far away I think I'd eat there more often!! They are located in Waikiki in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center on the ground level. Parking is pretty convenient in the parking garage. They don't take reservations so you have to go and sign in. You are probably going to wait to be seated, but while you are waiting you can go and check out all the cheesecakes they have for sale. The menu is quite extensive, with appetizers to full on meals, so take your time and choose carefully!! Many of the appetizer portions are big enough to share, so that's another way to order, you can share with your dining companions!! The pizzas and sandwiches are great, but my personal favorite happens to be an appetizer! You gotta have the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls. This is some serious deliciousness! It's served on a bed of deep fried long rice and served with two different sauces. Enough for two! The dining companion swears by the shrimp rolls, which isn't really a favorite of mine, but hey, to each his own!! We will usually order a pizza to split also. Great service and friendly interaction with the waitstaff make dining at Cheesecake Factory an enjoyable time. A little noisy in there, but a great place to sit down to some great food and conversation. If you're a big dessert fan, make sure you save some room for it since you're pretty much in dessert heaven!! So head out to Waikiki someday and have a great meal here, I'm sure you'll be glad you did!!"
Kim N.,"Mililani, HI",0,56,27,5.0,12/9/2017,"Ok, so this is a huge chain restaurant but I have found it is the best bang for your buck in downtown. Yes the wait will be about an hour but this place had the best food of anyone on the strip and we had two weeks to cruise all of the big ones. I had the chicken Madeira, shrimp scampi, Steak Diane, hibachi steak, and potstickers. Obviously not at once but over the course of our time in Waikiki. The steaks are amazing! One of the best steaks I've ever had and that includes some of the bigger steakhousss that serve sides ala carte! Sounds weird for a big, busy chain but it's true. I asked for A1 sauce for my steak the first night and ended up not even needing it cuz there was already so much flavor. Plus, it was cooked exactly how I ordered it! It's rare that everyone gets their food and loved their meal every single time! Do I even need to mention their delicious cheesecakes?! They do have a walk up counter to order cheesecake only to go! Convenient if u just want a dessert. Plus our servers were awesome every night. Very attentive and super helpful choosing from the menu (both entrees and drinks). They are ALWAYs busy but they were on top of drinks and our other requests. Food came out within a reasonable time but drinks can take a while if the bar is busy. Speaking of drinks, they were strong. I enjoyed the pineapple and cucumber mojitos. The wait is long (but the wait area is large and right on the main drag) but I hate to say that the best meals I had were here and I'd come back again."
Cata V.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",276,23,2,1.0,7/5/2017,"Oahu is home and when I want to have a cheat meal, I know the Cheesecake Factory does the trick. Unhealthy and tasty all in one. I was wearing a Hawaiian crop top and shorts and was asked if I had a towel, sweater, or anything to cover myself up with. Me response: Even if I had it, I would not cover myself up. It's a hot summer day and it's Hawaii! What's the manager thinking?  We left to never go back. When friends, family and clients ask, we will make sure they don't go there.  We ended up eating delicious food right across the street at California Pizza Kitchen where we tasty food, great music and awesome service!!! Aloha"
jen m.,"Waipahu, HI",2,2,91,1.0,5/17/2017,"Well we are not pressing charges.  Won't be a cry baby about it but never returning.  Wont recommend to any of family and friends.  By the way I forgot to add that when we got kicked out. We paid our bill 187 and some change. Gave 190$ decided not to tip since we are getting kicked out!!! And the nerrrrrve the server comes back and ask for tip.  Seriously..... so I guess when things like this happens, they are numb to it... but whatever.  Wish I could give -5 stars."
Jana P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,41,17,2.0,7/2/2017,"I really don't think the wait here is worth it.  It's not even great. The food was meh.  I got the eggplant parmigiana with the pesto noodles. Let me tell you, it wasn't pesto. It was more like, butter sauce drizzled with parsley flakes and with tablespoon of salt. Boy, it was so salty and a piggy myself could not even finish it. The eggplant was really oily but it was good because of the mozzarella cheese. I didn't eat any desserts although I should've to probably make up for the salt I just ingested.  I always enjoy the bread though."
Joyce L.,"Honolulu, HI",219,562,1403,4.0,3/19/2016,"This is my 2nd visit. My first visit was during dinner time. There was a line just to get my name in and then another 1 hour of wait. Today's visit was totally different. I went for lunch shortly after they open. This time no wait. Lunch time is the right time to come here. I think.  Our server was excellent and professional. We ordered 2 burgers, chicken madeira, crab dip. They were all good. I was impressed with chicken madeira. It was juicy and served with real mashed potatoes. I recommend getting sweet potato fries with your burger. Burger is good for 2 people. I was ready for a nap after my meal.  Folks, this place quite dark so it took me awhile to adjust to the lighting."
Kerry T.,"Kaimuki, Honolulu, HI",7,117,84,4.0,5/20/2017,"I went here for lunch this time, which means getting a table is a breeze. No 2 hour wait time. Lol. Lunch was pretty good. I had the Renee special which gives you a choice of sandwich, soup, and salad. Can't go wrong here. Big portions and tons to choose from. And of course cheesecake but I was too full to get one."
Mari L.,"Honolulu, HI",75,16,13,1.0,6/27/2017,"My brother chose Cheesecake Factory to celebrate his birthday ... And this place was a zoo!!! The wait to get in was 90 minutes. Upon entry we waited another 2 hours to order and receive our food. My brother being the happy go lucky guy that he is -- enjoyed all the food, drinks and desserts that was ordered.  DO NOT GO HERE EXPECTING FAST, QUALITY SEVICE!!!! Very disappointed."
Mel B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",345,601,5729,3.0,3/2/2016,"if you can't get street parking, your best bet is at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  The first hour, if validated, is free.  After that it's $2 an hour.  If you don't like that and can't figure out the math, you could park at the Waikiki Shopping Plaza where it's a flat fee of $5.00 total. So glad Judy recruited Frankie to get there early to put in our reservation.  So, the plan was the table would be ready to receive us by 7:00pm.  We arrive then, sit, order and enjoy.  You know how the best laid plans are easily laid to waste?  Guilty as charged.  I was the last to arrive close to 8pm.  Embarassing yes?  I needed a drink. Lemon Drop Martini $12.25 This was sweeter than normal, I think.  How'd they do that?  Well, it was good for me.  Pricey though. Everyone ordered immediately but I wasn't hungry.  I was trying to get something light besides salad but couldn't find anything.  Not even in the appetizer section either. Baja Chicken Tacos $14.95 These came in a group of 4.  I know I cannot expect these to be as good as the Tijuana street tacos I got for 80 cents but one could hope. Maybe I was hoping too much.  Although many of the flavors were there I found the tacos dry.  Note to self: bring my own salsa.  Maybe. This seems to be the problem many times when I visit Cheesecake Factory no matter where I go. Everything looks good, tastes good but is missing something missing the mark.   However, the cheescakes are devine.  They are pricey too so I only come if I want to treat myself and if it's convenient to get to.  This location is not convenient.  Back to making my own. Our server seemed okay.  She did check up on us enough to make sure we were doing okay.  And we got to celebrate Frankie's birthday which he received  a free ice cream cake sundae provided by CF.  It was nice and enjoyable. Looking for the next gathering!"
POOH L.,"Honolulu, HI",29,68,95,1.0,3/12/2017,Today i stopped at cheesecake factory to pick up a take out cheesecake.  It must've been about 3pmish.  And i must say the service was horrible.   The amount of time i soent waiting it felt as if i was waiting for a table!  So they have this roped off area in front of the case up to the registers in which a line will form.   As i was waiting in which i was 1st then cashier #1 takes 2 take out orders from these people that were not even in the line then an employee that was waiting in the line came out and went to that same cashier and placed an order also.  This cashier was an older lady hollering out orders in a very unprofessional way.  She had ne personality whatsoever.    In the meantime cashier #2 is with his headset calling orders and getting extremely overwhelmed because orders are not being made.  Then he has to call the mgr. over for some overides.   The employees preparing the cheesecakes were honestly busting their butts off!  I thought this was going to be a quick and fast take out considering the timing but i was wrong.
Ina T.,"Kahuku, HI",87,211,351,5.0,9/11/2016,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory? People come from near and far(we drive an hour plus) to enjoy their delicious food. Whether you like Asian fusion, Island Rim, American or Italian they pretty much offer it all. Not everyone that comes here come for the cheesecake(I'm partial to that) but the food and service is so good we don't really care that you even have cheesecake most of the time. The cheesecake selection is the cherry on top of your great experience your bound to have.  My BIGGEST recommendation is to go early for dinner, I don't care what day of the week it is. I'd say on average what time is 30-45min on a good day. It's not unusual to wait almost 2hrs for dinners on the weekends  and it normally doesn't turn anyone away and that in itself speaks for this place. If you haven't been here yet, you should be asking yourself why you haven't.  Here are a few of my favs for several years: Apps:Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Fried Macaroni & Cheese Entree: Miso Salmon, Hibachi Steak, Chicken Madeira, garlic noodles  Cheesecake: Dulce de Leche, Oreo, Salted Caramel, Snickers     It's always a treat to come back, so I'm happy to be here tonight ordering my favs w/my favs."
