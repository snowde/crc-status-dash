Cassandra S.,"Honolulu, HI",10,4,,4.0,6/3/2013,"Every time i'm in waikiki I make a stop here. I really love their food every time I go, but the wait is killer."
Jennifer D.,"Honolulu, HI",1876,78,649,4.0,5/1/2010,This is my husband's dining choice anytime we venture into Waikiki.  The quality (and quantity) of the food for the price we pay combined with the friendly service and live music makes this a winner.  Bypass the long wait for a table and eat at the bar.
Dylan T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",376,323,49,3.0,8/26/2010,"I would recommend this place for tourists who are all tuckered out of Hawaiian or Japanese food.  I mean it's a chain, so it's not going to be bad, however it's a typical CF...which means you'd better call ahead and it's LOUD.  And of course, if you're dissatisfied with your meal, there's always dessert!"
Lalee M.,"Pasadena, CA",272,157,1278,4.0,7/4/2012,"Long wait, busy, and super crowded. Nice place with friendly service. Food menu is similar to other Cheesecake's. The Hawaiian fish sandwich was very delicate and tasty."
Frine S.,"Converse, TX",76,88,250,5.0,10/2/2010,"Big portions ,great prices and delicious food!!!! Cannot beat!!!!! Most breakfast dishes are good for two slightly hungry ppl. Love the place, every time I visit I leave happier."
Andy J.,"Orlando, FL",87,359,2246,2.0,8/21/2010,"Terrible Mai Tai's and so-so appetizers.  Only their cheesecake was good.  Their Orlando, FL location has the same menu but the food is prepared much better.  There are better restaurants nearby to choose from."
Piper M.,"Laveen, AZ",35,22,,4.0,2/26/2012,The staff is knowledgeable and very friendly. The food is always excellent and the drinks are good!
Camille D.,"San Francisco, CA",43,38,,5.0,11/7/2010,"My boyfriend and I come here all the time for our monthsaversary (i know, it's corny). This place gets really crowded after 6pm, with almost a 1 and a half to 2 hour wait. Aaahhhhh.  In the hundred times we've been here, i've gotten fairly young waiters/waitresses who are always friendly and fast. The bread is okay. My  boyfriend and I always eat the wheat first, then save the sourdough for something to nibble on while we wait for food.  The wait really depends on how crowded it is.. but they usually do a pretty good job.  I've tried so many items and they were all delicious. The huge factory burrito, jambalaya pasta (my fave), kolbi(?) burger, white chili, chicken medallions, da vinci pasta, chicken carbonera, pesto pizza (discontinued, boo) etc. etc. . ALLL very well made, and good.  The calamari is also yummy as hell :) Always freshly fried so it doesn't taste oily. The thai spring rolls are also really good! HUGE portion with a ton of sauces. It's a DIY appetizer. The cheesecake... I don't think this place knows how to mess up cheesecake. I've tried a variety, and they've all been yummy as hell. I don't even mind the extra calories :)"
Jenna C.,"Kapolei, HI",50,27,124,4.0,10/10/2010,"Friendly wait staff, huge portions, nice atmosphere.  Most entree's can feed two people, as well as the cheesecake.   Only bad thing I can say is we went on a Saturday night, and waited for 2 hours for a table.  But,  it is in Waikiki.  We should have known what to expect."
Jimmy G.,"Long Beach, CA",58,32,31,3.0,11/4/2010,"Stopped into this Cheesecake Factory about 2 weeks ago. Just as good as the CF's here in California. Since it's in Hawai'i, of course it has an island theme, which I love. The staff is very helpful and courteous. They came by frequently to check up on us.  It's a little difficult to have a normal conversation inside because it's a bit noisy in there.  We got in around 6:00 and had to wait approximately 30 minutes for a table for 2. When I was in O'ahu for the 4th of July, we had to wait about 90 minutes for a table. The place is very clean and dimly lit. Food is what you'd typically expect from Cheesecake. Everyone is nice."
Jo M.,"Honolulu, HI",17,32,,4.0,11/27/2009,"This place does too many things right to ignore.  The dishes are consistent, many items are downright delicious, and lots of the dishes have large portions.  Sometimes I get tired of the many 'hole in the wall' joints in Hawai`i so this place makes for a nice change of scene. I recently had the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club Sandwich.  It's so much more than a regular club!  I think the dressing they use puts it over the top, plus it big!  It's enough for two people who don't want a full meal, the club makes a great late night snack. This is another great LATE NIGHT place that stays open later than most.  Plus they fully validate you for 4 hours, good for those who need the validation. The floors at Cheesecake are always very slippery, weird. Last seating is 11 during the week 11:30 on Fr&Sat, 10:30 on Sunday. The extensive menu means everyone in your party can eat something they like."
Mickey C.,"Corrales, NM",6,243,,5.0,4/29/2013,"HUGE menu....excellent soups, sandwiches, salads, deserts, coffee, etc.  go early as there is usually a LONG line.  15 min + wait.  1/2 hour to get food.  We went at 11 AM and got food by 1145.  Went again at 5 PM and got food at 5:45.  Highly recommend as the food is excellent and price is right."
Joey L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",406,117,30,5.0,6/24/2012,My favorite place on this island! Amazing food good times and CHEESE CAKE! Little bit of a wait thanks to all the tourists but it's well worth it!
Ingrid V.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,12,18,2.0,4/19/2013,I expected it to be mind blowing. As always I try out everyone's Calamari and they by far have one of the best I've tasted. Maybe I just got the wrong thing to eat but I didn't care too much for it. The parking was in the Royal Hawaiian Parking Garage and it was a loooooong walk to the restaurant and back to your car.
Shannon G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,3.0,7/26/2014,"We have been to this particular location two separate occasions. The first time we ordered three main entrees; the Chicken Madeira, the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, and the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. The Madeira is touted as the most popular chicken dish, however is was only ok in my opinion. It was not bad, but also not fantastic. The gumbo was ok, and the pepper shrimp was just so-so. The second time the Factory Burrito Grande and the Skinnylicious Asian Salad was ordered. The burrito was decent, and the salad was quite good. The only part of the salad I did not care for was the rice noodles.    On the positive side of things the service was good and the bread they bring you before the meal is very good. It also has the added benefit of keeping away the grumbles as you wait for your entree.    There are several issues you may want to keep in mind if you are thinking of venturing to this location. The first being the wait. Do not be surprised if they tell you the wait is over an hour. It is a busy restaurant in a tourist location. Second, their menu can be quite overwhelming. It is too large and can take a person quite a bit of time just to go over their dinner options. I think that they could benefit trimming down the amount of dishes they offer, but since they are already an established chain I doubt that will happen. The lighting is also very dim in there. It's quite dark for a restaurant. Also, if you are ordering for kids, they put a lot of pepper on the vegetables. The carrots were too spicy for a kids menu item, so you may want to request no pepper for the little ones.   Overall the experience was fine, but nothing special. It is the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. If that's what you're looking for, you got it! If the wait is more than 30 minutes it is probably worth trying something else, unless you came for the desserts in particular. The desserts are quite good, but can be very rich so take your time! There is a separate line and checkout for purchasing cheesecakes togo, so if you only want one of those you can get one without waiting for a table. It was a convenient location for us since it was right next to the hotel. We were able to put our name in to wait and then go back to our room for the hour they quoted us. If we had to sit at the restaurant and wait over an hour, we would not have stayed."
Robert H.,"Denver, CO",164,634,1935,4.0,8/7/2008,"Great location, just a swift walk from Waikiki beach and great food. The service is fast, this place is always packed and the menu is probably 20-pages long. The sandwiches, nachos and cheesecake are my spoiled kill my stomach favorites. LOVE IT!"
Maria O.,"Honolulu, HI",70,32,16,5.0,9/26/2010,Have yet to have a dish here that was not good.  Portions are huge so it's good for two meals or for sharing. Love the original cheesecake with strawberries.  My kiddos love the Linda's Fudge cake. Wish I could eat here all the time!
Tina T.,"Honolulu, HI",24,89,63,3.0,10/24/2012,"Since moving to Hawaii 3 years ago I still haven't tried the Cheesecake Factory, mainly because I was deterred by the excessive long lines and waiting time.  Yet I was always intrigued what's so special about this place, so this past weekend I gave it a try when we were in Waikiki.  This place doesn't accept reservations so we had to put our names down at the front, and we were told the wait would be 40 min.  I haven't waited for any table at any restaurant for that long in years but so be it.   Our table was ready on time and we were swiftly taken to our table.  Our waiter served us water and took our drinks order immediately.  Then he brought some nice warm bread to the table.  Thumbs up. The menu is huge and the choices are abundant.  I ordered the bang bang chicken & prawns, and my friend ordered the moroccan chicken with cous cous.  The food took a while to get to us and even though we were served warm bread, after waiting for 1.5 hour in total for the table and the food we were famished.  The portions were big, catering to the usual american tourists.  My plate was a bit disastrous (very unappealing, just look like they plopped the brown rice in the middle and just dumped the sauce and chicken on the side).  I think the presentation could have been much improved if they just placed the sauce with the chicken and prawns in a small bowl sprinkled with the coconuts, then placed the bowl on the plate with the rice.  Taste wise it was pretty salty, and the coconut sauce had well, no wow factor.  Even though I was hungry I could only stomach 1/3 of the meal b/c it didn't make me want more, plus I wanted to save room for the cheesecake of course. My friend's dish on the other hand looked and tasted fab!  Our waiter was very slow to respond so we got fed up waiting another 20 min for a piece of pumpkin peacan cheesecake so we ordered it to go.  The bill and the cheesecake took another 15 min to get to us.  Total time spent more than 2.5 hours!   Needless to say I won't be back unless it's with visitors who insisted on trying this place.  And if I want cheesecake, I'll just order it from the counter to go."
Michael K.,Australia,0,2,,5.0,6/22/2013,"Great service, great food and very reasonably priced. The cheesecake selection and taste is truly amazing. It is good go in the early afternoon, to avoid the long queues. Definitely, a highlight whilst staying in Waikki."
Jenny C.,"Honolulu, HI",30,141,23,4.0,7/27/2010,"Hold the phone, I haven't reviewed The Cheesecake Factory?  Where have I been?  So I've been here a LOT...and even ordered out a lot so I can give feedback on both. First of all, the only time I have ever not had to stand in line for this place was like at 10 pm on a Saturday night so beware.  They are constantly busy and do not take reservations.  If you go during the busy hours (I would say between like 6-9?)...you can expect to wait up to an hour.  Is it worth it?  I kinda think it is!  They have an extensive menu in terms of entrees and desserts.  However, come here expecting to pay a chunk of change...entrees are not cheap but the portions are great. I've had...a variety of things here.  I'm sure I could give you feedback if you messaged me about a certain item.  This past weekend though, I tried their portabello on a bun and it was AWESOME.  God, I am drooling just thinking about it.  I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but their portabello is so thick and juicy....you won't even miss the meat.  I also tried their warm apple crisp for dessert...and yummm.  I've been on an apple pie kick lately and this was great.  It comes with basically...the apple pie filling with a mountain of whipped cream (It's too bad that I don't like whipped cream)...and two scoops of vanilla ice cream...all drizzled with caramel.  So good...I thought there was a bit too much walnuts...but I don't hate walnuts so it was fine.  :)  Their appetizers are good, entrees are good, desserts are good...! I caution about big phone orders, I've done a few and never do I get the right order.  They always miss something...and it's hard to check every single plate in the restaurant (especially when you have 20+) orders...and I feel bad about saying that because the girl at the bar who assists you is SO nice.  Just make sure you double check everything before you leave.   Also, if you go during their busy times...don't expect to have a good conversation when seated...it gets so loud!  Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center garage...and they validate 3 hours for free!  :)"
