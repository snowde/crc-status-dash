Dyna P.,"Honolulu, HI",91,10,,5.0,10/13/2012,"Brandon was our waiter this afternoon and he was THE BEST WAITER I have ever had in Hawaii. Our group of 12 were pleasantly happy with his service: quick, friendly, and never let our drinks go 1/2 empty. Food was pretty darn good too (: We will definitely be going back and asking for Brandon to wait on us despite the big crowd. Thanks Brandon for your great customer service!"
Tessa t.,"Honolulu, HI",328,193,8,3.0,12/24/2011,"yelp 365 challenge #6o/365 sat there without being approached for about ten minutes... normally i would not be too happy... BUT this time...i was... there menu is HUGE!!! they could've left me there for 45 minutes and i wouldn't even have noticed since i would only be half done looking through the menu... we finally decided to start with the spinach artichoke dip, fried calamari, and lentil rustic soup... calamari. good. soup. super good. dip...between cold and warm... we asked our server if she could just throw it in the microwave for us for a bit... we aren't too picky, and if they're busy we don't need a new one, just a hot one... however, that endeavor took about 20 minutes :( we were almost done with the chips by then... ish okie... the manager came to check up on us and the dip, as well as the server... i appreciate that. anyways, we couldn't eat anything else after :( definitely want to go back and try some entrees next time... the only thing i didn't like is... because the restaurant is so huge... you can't really find your waiter if you need them... i don't really like flagging down waiters that aren't mines... but in this place you kinda have to... nothing can be done about that though... just something i wanted to say...lol"
Alex A.,"Honolulu, HI",79,78,98,3.0,4/29/2010,"So I came back here for my birthday to re-experience the divine...and was left seriously reconsidering my faith.  I ordered the Cajun-Style Prime Rib once again, medium-rare.  I don't think they got the cooking right and I had devoured most of it by the time I realized the steak wasn't going to get any rarer.  It was a bit dry and the tastes just didn't melt in my mouth like I had imagined.  So sad...it's like finding out Mark McGwire uses steroids after dyeing your hair red, growing a goatee, and pumping iron to be like him. Also, I wouldn't come here for a birthday.  Most places you go will offer you something for your birthday...even a place that is known for desserts might give you something small.  However, you're required to buy the overrated cheesecake here, and knowing that my mom's Perfect Cheesecake was waiting for me at her house, there was no way I'd pay for their weak offerings.  In a lot of ways I'm glad I didn't...another person had a birthday as well and the staff singing is horrid and unenthused.  So, in a way it was good that I wasn't subjected to that aural disaster up close.   Still, I've had a number of good experiences in the past.  They still have big portions, and the Shepherd's Pie is always delicious."
Montrey W.,"San Francisco, CA",236,8,6,5.0,3/11/2010,"You can't really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory so I went in already with high expectations because I had been to another Cheesecake factory in a different state. First off..I was able to get a seat outside and of course that's the way you want to experience dining in Hawai'i considering the amazing weather. The food choices are endless but i ended up ordering the ""Hibachi Steak"" which comes with tempura asparagus, wasabi mashed potatoes and of course the angus steak with shitake mushrooms. This was one of the best meals i've EVER had in my life. I think its amazing that they have such a huge menu yet they make each item with such care. After the meal I of course looked over the cheesecake and based off the descriptions alone; I dont think you can go wrong at all. If i could rate this place higher I would. The ONLY thing I will say is that they are KINDA expensive but for what you get its definitely worth it. Will be going here as much as possible. This place even makes Hawai'i better if that's possible."
Amanda A.,"South Bend, IN",92,78,28,4.0,11/10/2009,"As always Cheesecake is a delight no matter which one i am at. Food was fantastic here as other locations ive been to. Menu is huge and has very complex/flavorful selections. Drink menu is great also, i love the Peach Bellini (frozen peach drink) and my aunt had a mai tai (didnt taste it, she said it was good, but she has never had one before, so...). I ordered the Herb Cursted Salmon and Steak Diane. Very good. And we had a pizza, burger and burrito at our table everyone seemed pleased. Service was not over the top outstanding, but the best that we have gotten since being in Oahu! It was very loud with the combination of music, crowd out side walking past, full restaurant and quite spoken server. They serve a bread basket with a great brown bread. mmm... And of course a page and a half of cheesecakes! Mmm. My favorite is always Chocolate Mousse. But we also had Godiva Choc and a White Chocolate/Carmel/Macadamia which was great... Prices range from $8-$21 on average for entrees. Cheescake from $6-$8 and my bellini was $9 and mai tai $10 I always like to stop by TCF even for a drink or appetizer when in a town that has one. Enjoy! Oh, they also serve an extensive breakfast menu all day long!!!"
Jae K.,"Honolulu, HI",130,16,9,3.0,10/10/2010,"I really wanted to like it more. Cheesecake has never let me down.  Not in SF or Dallas or Boston.  The Waikiki spot is so busy, it has to be good. Right? Line was 30 minutes to get a, wait for it, a pager.  The wait to be seated was 90 min.  That alone was not bad because I expected the wait. Not 90 minutes, but I expected at least an hour.  They actually seated us in 70 mins or so, so I happy because it's all about expectations.  It was my birthday. I wanted something different.  I order the steak Diane and salmon. Wife got the jambalaya pasta. Kids the combo pizza and mom in law got the cashew chicken. Bread was a nice treat after the long wait.  The service was great. Didn't check on us for more water or bread, but otherwise happy people.  I liked my dish, although the salmon was different.  Moist. Just different.  Pizza was good.  The jambalaya was flavorful but the noodles were clumped in to a mashed gruel.  What is the opposite if al dente?  Gruel.  The chicken cashew was moist but the good stopped there.  Awful tasting and somewhat burnt.  They sang a nice happy birthday song and the strawberry cheesecake was delicious.  Bday boy gets complementary ice cream.  Price is very reasonable, especially for Waikiki.   Too bad.  Maybe Vegas."
Krissy F.,"Honolulu, HI",11,46,291,5.0,3/5/2014,"Sinfully delicious!!!!!! I love this place so much!!!!! If you plan to go here plan on three things.... Spending lots of money, waiting a really long time for a table (hour or two or more), and leaving feeling like you may barf from eating to much!! It is a rare treat though and I recommend to go here for a special occasion for sure. There is something for everyone to choose from here! The southwestern egg rolls are out of this world amazing here! I also love the chicken enchiladas they make (I'm not sure of the name for the dish) but they come with green sauce on top and cheese with some little corn cakes, black beans, and rice! So yummy and filling!!!! As for cheesecakes I have had the red velvet with cream cheese, Godiva (a chocolate lovers paradise which is super rich), and Oreo (creamy Oreo not to rich but so good) and all 3 were AMAZING!!!!!! I always have to share my cheesecake with my husband though way to rich to eat all by myself! The worst part of this restaurant is the check!"
Ro R.,"Waipahu, HI",7,30,,2.0,10/30/2012,"BOOO!!  They no longer have the appetizer sampler, which i ALWAYS ordered to start things off.  And I didn't like the recent service we experienced there.  Some of their staff do not work well under pressure; they lose their focus and forget something so simple as lemon wedges.  How disappointing."
Ryan H.,"Dundee, IL",94,220,41,4.0,1/26/2010,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants when I'm on vacation.  I much rather visit local establishments and immerse myself in local culture and cuisine.  As such, we only stopped at the Cheesecake Factory to address an issue with a sweet tooth.  As per usual, their cheesecake is out of this world.  No complaints whatsoever.  If you enjoy people watching, this location can't be beat as it is right on Kalakaua Ave, the ""main"" street/shopping district in Waikiki. Wait times to be seated can be very long though, so reservations are recommended."
Erin T.,"Stuttgart, Germany",6,120,1,2.0,5/12/2014,"Not bad, not good. Just meh. Food was fine, but all just bland and nondescript. We split 3 appetizers between the 2 of us and had another whole meal left over, so portions were big. We've been on a calamari kick, so this was about the 5th place we'd had it this week. Definitely the worst. Again, not bad, but just obviously right out of the freezer and put on a plate with a bowl of cocktail sauce. Tamale cakes were SWIMMING in sour cream and the nachos were...nachos.  VERY crowded, but we did call ahead, so it definitely helped the wait. Our server was awesome- very friendly and very helpful. The cheesecake dessert was, of course, the best part. My husband had the tiramisu cheesecake and I had the cookie dough. His was definitely the better- mine was WAY too sweet. Not able to finish it. I've found that in the past with the dulce de leche cheesecake, too. My go-to here has always been the Vanilla Bean. It's lighter and not an over the top. Too many other dining options here to go back again unless it's to pick up a slice to go..."
Makaluana D.,"Toronto, Canada",0,5,,1.0,9/3/2014,"Over priced, and tasteless food.  The only good thing was the sliders and calamari.  The steak my son ordered well done was bloody and uncooked, which we sent back and instead of replacing it they charbroiled the pieces till it was burnt.  The manager came out to us but did not apologize. I had high hopes for this place but was greatly disappointed.  If your looking for similar food as the Cheesecake factory go to Dukes, it is by far better.  Customer service is lacking here, and this place is over crowed and unpleasant to eat at."
Lily L.,"Honolulu, HI",140,26,17,3.0,8/14/2012,"this place is what the title says cheesecake is the best reason to go, although they give you free bread  don't ever order fish sounds appetizing but the portions or really tiny unless your a petite weight watcher i suggest to only come for dessert"
Kristen C.,"Chicago, IL",132,421,49,3.0,7/13/2010,"It *is* the Cheesecake Factory, so it is exactly what you expect. I wish that it was what I expected *with* a view but alas, you cannot have it all. My husband and I stopped here on a busy day in Waikiki because we needed a safe, healthy lunch. By safe, of course I mean gluten free. Here at the CF, I know I can get the turkey burger no bun with a little green salad and diet coke. It's delicious, pretty healthy, and gluten free. It totally hit the spot on that warm day. My husband had something predictable. It was tasty, service was friendly and slow but Aloha-style slow, and the ambiance was typical. Pretty good if you are looking for a meal in Waikiki."
L T.,"Thunder Bay, Canada",2,9,,5.0,1/17/2013,"I've been here many times when I'm in town and have to say this place is amazing, great food, great portions, great prices and great servers.  Yes there is a big line to get in but why do you think that is?  Being Italian I'm picky with my food and these guys passed the test."
Amanda U.,"Honolulu, HI",124,76,30,3.0,7/4/2012,"The food was meh to me. nothing special to run to my mothers house to brag about. The wait was horrible, but thanks to that I was able to go shopping at forever 21. The service was ok, a bit slow but what do you expect on a weekend night at 8pm in waikiki? The first few times we sat inside and witnessed a proposal by the bathrooms, (what a unique proposal... by the bathrooms)... the lst time we went we sat outside, we thought it would be weird sitting next to a busy sidewalk and street but it was actually alright, a lot more quiet than in the restaurant itself. I hate the fact that when we come here i have at least 2 cheesecakes... its always hard to choose. LOVE the red velvet one though :) mmm yummy!"
Jessie G.,"Ninove, Belgium",10,5,,4.0,1/2/2013,Love the shrimp and chicken gumbo. Favorite cheesecake is the Godiva one: chocolate heaven!
Paul C.,"Evans, GA",11,12,1,4.0,12/30/2012,"One of our favorite chain restaurants on the island. There is no doubt that you will wait in long lines during peak dinner hours, but it is the busiest location amongst all of the chain's locations. There is a reason they have longer wait times than anywhere else in Waikiki. As long as you accept that when you head out, you will have a wonderful meal. I've never had anything less than exceptional food and service. The pre-meal bread is excellent, love the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, and ALL of the desserts are outstanding. Just remember, you're in Hawai'i - kick back, enjoy the weather, and people-watch or shop while you wait to get in. Your wait will be worth it if you can accept you aren't going to a fast-food restaurant. Savor the experience!"
Leah B.,"Honolulu, HI",6,10,15,2.0,12/26/2013,"We always eat at this restaurant but disappointed bcoz I have a pomche small dog every time they see my dog the guy server said uh uh no dogs allowed & today the lady server said yur dog need to stay inside the bag kind of rude yeh they should ask me first is that a service dog, & I decide to buy cheesecake & bread  for take out the cashier first time she's ok but whe I came back coz I got the wrong bread that I order she gave attitude she just ignore me she kept jumping to the next costumer & then answer the phone she gave me dirty look when I gave her the bread I even told her I'm sorry I dint know I order the wrong one,she could ask her co worker to get me another bread but she wanted me to wait longer I don't know watz her problem bad service  I should not giv her tip really bad"
Aileen C.,"Honolulu, HI",197,70,64,4.0,5/11/2010,"So it's a chain, whatever-- I love CF! While waiting (and there is always a wait, no matter what time it seems) sit at the bar and have ""Fern"" (like the plant he says) make you a pineapple mojito... SOOO ridiculously good."
