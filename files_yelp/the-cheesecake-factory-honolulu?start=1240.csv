Ryan R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,19,4,4.0,12/13/2010,Ok so this isn't a true Hawaiian experience but my wife and I ate here all the time when we lived on O'ahu for the better part of 2010.  We had no family to celebrate the Holidays with so we would spend it with the great staff at this location. We were always met with a smile and attentive waiting staff even on their busiest day!  I gave it 4 stars only because the food is always a little too salty for my taste.  The food is excellently priced for being in the heart of Waikiki on Kalakaua. Don't know if they still have it but whatever you do try the Red Velvet Cheesecake!  Amazing!
Nikita A.,"Mira Loma, CA",15,48,,4.0,12/2/2012,"Love this place , Got here are 10:00 pm , service was good but a little slow. My husband had the club sandwich, all ingredients were very fresh. Had the avocado egg rolls I am sure they even gave me a few extra.  :) . They also had entreatment a two person band a singer with a beautiful voice, the crowd just didn't appreciate him NO ONE CLAPPED. That was sad to see. However my husband complemented him."
Charlie B.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/5/2014,"We came into the Cheesecake Factory at 6:30 on Monday evening. Yes, it is Waikiki and Europe /Japan school holiday, but an hour wait at 6:30? It was unpleasantly crowded, not fun it's ok to wait crowded. The snotty girl hostess gave me a receipt with my first name printed on it with firm instructions to return for my pager thingy. When I hesitated to commit to an hour wait for a marginal US chain menu she said I ""had to come back"". I am still worried this damsel will spot me tomorrow at Food Pantry and issue me a fine for choosing not to wait an hour. The one star is based on the assumption that all of us tourists are ok with being treated like the Midwest Rube I am. The other mediocre US chain, Chilies, around the corner had no wait and was good."
J J.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4,137,30,4.0,1/8/2012,"Sunday Brunch review.....Yes....you can get Cheesecake Factory anywhere....but, from someone who travels to Waikiki a lot on biz, you aren't going to find a cheaper Sunday brunch with better food anywhere.  Brunch is expensive in Waikiki if you want quality, and for the price I would def recommend CF. oh, and not everyone knows they open early on Sunday, so very little crowd, unlike dinner."
Crissy K.,"Honolulu, HI",391,394,234,4.0,3/16/2008,"Yes, I've been to a number of Cheesecake Factories on the mainland, and the Waikiki one is CRAZY crowded, but we finally made it there today for a birthday brunch. It's good to know that the quality of food you get at the mainland locations has been brought here -- that isn't the case for every chain restaurant, believe me. The portions were still huge (so you have enough to take for lunch the next day), and the cheesecake was still sinfully fabulous. And everyone -- kids and adults -- had a great time.  Little known fact: You CAN make reservations at this location, but I think it's only during the first half-hour of operation, so pretty much only for brunch or an early lunch. That's really nice for Sunday, especially because they have special Sunday brunch menu options."
Paul C.,"Manhattan, NY",298,741,205,2.0,3/28/2012,"My wife and I were feeling ironic one night in Waikiki so we went here for a late night snack. Even compared to other Cheesecake Factories this one is pretty bad. Massively overpriced, spotty service (our server actually was pretty aggro--sorry if you're having a bad day buddy!), and the worst pizza I've had in years. My wife's pasta was decent which is what keeps this from one star. Expect 15-45 minute waits on average."
Christopher C.,"Kaneohe, HI",14,171,1,3.0,10/30/2009,Visit: 10/18/09 - Lunch.  Had the Chicken Maderia. The chicken was really good.  The mash potatoes are also great with this dish. Portions are large so the price was okay. Service was nice.  I will come back.
Kailinani L.,"Kailua, HI",2,11,2,5.0,5/9/2015,We beat the rush by dining early...about 6 pm on a Friday.  Short 10 minute wait and in we went.  It took a while for anyone to greet us once we were.seated and hubby was getting a bit put off but once Cody made an appearance the night took a most pleasant turn. Started with the fried avocado spring roll appetizer as directed by the daughter.  She loves these things.  Very fresh and generous serving of avocado in a deep fried spring roll wrapper served with a cilantro  dipping sauce that is reminiscent of chimmichuri but is sweet.  Different but delicious.   She had the chicken scallopini which was very flavorful  with a nice overlay of lemon.  The hubs had Steak Diane which was wonderful...tender steak encrusted with peppercorns and a Madera sauce that was generously served but light in consistency.  it was nice that there was enough gravy to sop up with the mash potatos or the bread assortment they serve. The tenderness and flavor of the steak was truly surprising and rivals a steak served at any high end steak house.  I had the seafood chowder and there was an assortment of seafood in a thick New England style chowder.  Very filling.  We were too stuffed to eat dessert so Cody talked us into cheesecake slices to go. (Great salesman!) Will definitely hit this place again in the off hours and when not minding the diet as the portions are good sized.
Mark H.,"Bothell, WA",1,3,,4.0,7/24/2014,"Wonderful meal, great service. The wasabi encrusted Ahi was wonderful and the cheese cake was fabulous. One of the best meals I've had during my stay in Waikiki. This place does fill up quickly and tends to have quite a wait so get there on the early side to avoid the rush."
Caryn N.,"Pearl City, HI",100,262,169,4.0,6/29/2011,"My fiancée loves to come here for lunch.  We always get an order of the crab wontons.  This afternoon we had a great server named Steve who was very attentive and quick with refills.  He even let us know some of the ""secret"" cheesecake flavors that weren't on the menu.  I so wanted the piña colada cheesecake after he mentioned it, but I was way too full after having the grilled shrimp blt with sweet potato fries.  My fiancee and I usually have a tendency to over-order, but we made the right estimation this time around with just the wontons and the sandwich.  The sweet potato fries just melted in your mouth.  Worth the extra dollar more."
T P.,Australia,4,34,5,2.0,8/27/2012,So so service and food that wasn't worth the wait. The place looks great from the outside but having now eaten here I can say that it is dated and won't return. 15 minutes for cheese cake to be cut isn't good enough!!
Katrice K.,"Seattle, WA",31,108,,2.0,6/12/2009,"Honestly, I think I am so over large corporate American chain restaurants.  I mean I love to eat and I like things that are reasonable for the price.  But the portions at Cheesecake Factory are just so big!  My coworkers and I ordered the appetizer sampler plus an entree each.  The appetizer sampler was enough to be a meal for three people!  And we were hungry too!  The sampler came on four plates!  It was just so much food.  I took one bite of my actual entree and was full!  Plus to me everything was too greasy or too cheesey.  While I am no health nut, I could feel my heartache sneaking up on me!   While we were waiting for our food to be boxed up, we were looking around and all the entrees were huge!  I saw the burger and it looked at like 8 inches tall I swear and the salads were huge also.  Although when I was in high school I liked this place I think I am starting to pick quality over quantity.  (Although I still like the cheesecakes if there are four people to share it with!)"
Carol L.,"Honolulu, HI",382,300,173,4.0,5/5/2011,Tips: Go early! We went @ 530pm. Seated us immediately. Ordered by 600 eating by 630 Perfect!! I always love their chicken piccata. Chicken Marsala is also divine. Tender lemony bliss. Hubby the Steak Diane combo with shrimp scampi. Left overs for lunch and red velvet cheesecake to take home which last me a couple of days!!! MMMMmmmm
Eve O.,"Bridgeport, CT",2,17,15,5.0,6/19/2012,"This is my husband and I special places. We don't come here often but when we do we always leave happy. The wait is crazy but so worth it. You need to pick a time that people are not going to come as much. Like when it opens or some other time that's not dinner time. You can wait up to two hour for this place. If you go during dinner time make sure you had a snack before because by the time you enter and get a table you will be hungry. On average we always spend about 80 dollars but so worth it because it brings a lot of food. And that 80 covers apps, dinner, drinks, desserts. I love this place."
Bob R.,"La Quinta, CA",9,16,,4.0,12/15/2011,"Fast service, friendly helpful staff. Typical Cheesecake Factory fare. Would go there again."
Bran H.,"Fort Collins, CO",27,69,3,3.0,8/4/2012,"We've been to other locations and wouldn't normally have decided to go but a friend wanted to go. The service was good. Food was good and of course the cheesecakes are delicious. The place seemed clean so I couldn't ask for much more. My only complaint across all their restaurants would be the price. I don't feel their food justifies their prices, it stops me from eating here more often."
Kristoffer F.,"Filtvet, Norway",8,7,2,4.0,7/21/2012,"Awesome food! Messes up our order though, but it was a fair mistake. You'll have to wait at least 45 minutes to get your table. Overall the food was brilliant!"
Jennine T.,"Waltham, MA",18,66,,4.0,7/20/2010,"I heart The Cheesecake Factory.  It all started many many years ago when I was forced to eat there with my family. When it was time to order dessert, I told the waiter, ""I hate cheesecake,"" which is still pretty much true.  He told me to try the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake because ""it doesn't even taste like cheesecake.""  That moment was life-changing.  The best non-cheesecakey cheesecake ever!  I've eaten at the Waikiki restaurant many many times.  If you arrive there after 6pm pretty much any night then you'll have to wait FOREVER for a table.  So, I try to eat at unconventional hours or between 5 and 6.   Now that we have a baby, I find the restaurant to be great for kids. When our baby was in the stroller, we ate around 4pm, and had a huge luxurious booth to ourselves which fit the stroller perfectly.  Last time I went there (yesterday), they got us a high chair.  I often just get appetizers and dessert because I hate most of the entrees. They never taste as good as they sound, but I will share some highlights of the menu:  --Appetizer sampler. . . so big, but great --Avocado eggrolls --Thai lettuce wraps --French Country Salad --Napa Burger --Fish Tacos And my favorite cheesecakes-- --Chocolate Tuxedo Cream --Brownie Sundae --Tiramisu  And I often order one of the many chocolate cake slices--they are SO big. . . you can eat them for days (for real!) at home. . . I want to do a taste test to see which of their five chocolate cakes is the best. . . still have to do that."
Justin Y.,"Phoenix, AZ",237,75,5,2.0,2/19/2010,"Given the generally super high ratings of ol' Cheesecake Factory I was actually looking forward to going there. (I know, I must be the only person to have NEVER gone there all this time...)  But I was really disappointed overall.  Went here for lunch yesterday and had the Kobe Burger since I just have to try out burgers every new place I go...and was very very disappointed.  The burger itself was under seasoned and looked like a slab of charcoal.  The tomato was frozen, the shredded lettuce was wilted and soggy, onions were tasteless and oily, but I guess the bun wasn't burnt so...yay?  The fries weren't anything to speak of either...sad really.  The service was ok although our waitress gave us incorrect change (by a $20 margin) and almost began to argue when we asked for the correct change.  But to her credit, she was generally friendly overall.   The portions are a bit ridiculous looking around at other dishes...I could easily order a normal dinner sized meal w/cheesecake and ask them to box 3/4 of it before the meal even gets to the table and i'd still be full.   I would've gone 1 star for that disgrace of a burger but since the cheesecake was not bad I decided to go with 2.  But man that stuff is ridiculously sweet.  Much too sweet and heavy for my taste.   This place is quite the epitome of the things (and amounts) America loves to eat, but really shouldn't eat.   I'll take people's word for it that the other dishes taste good, but I probably won't go back unless i'm with someone who really wants to."
Jennifer S.,"San Francisco, CA",104,138,9,4.0,4/9/2012,"Even though we have Cheesecake Factory at home, for some reason we like to go to the one in Hawaii. The service is fast and friendly. There are some things on the menu not available back home. And the CHEESECAKE is YUMMMMMM =)"
