Jarrett H.,"Honolulu, HI",211,175,17,4.0,7/18/2011,"I do think this place is a bit overrated but I am a fan of their amazing list of Cheesecakes that I am giving them the benefit of the doubt of a four star average.  The first time I ever went to a Cheesecake Factory was in California.  My cousins from Cali said it is a little like a higher class Zippys.  Frankly, I would have to agree with that description in California. Its actually a bit different in Hawaii. Its seems a little more classy in Hawaii than some of the mainland ones I've visited.      First thing I completely dislike about this place is the droves of tourists standing in line or clogging up the aisle ways.  arggh...why would you eat at someplace you already have in your home state? This totally boggles my mind. There are so many other places to eat in Hawaii.  Even in the tourist trap called Waikiki.  Its like if I went to Arizona or Idaho to eat Hawaiian food.     Food is good but you get Waikiki prices for restaurant chain food. I have had the Steak Diane and Shrimp scampi.  I felt these were two good and solid food items.  I was kind of surprised that there was more mashed potatoes than the main entrees.  The Shrimp Scampi was a different from what I'm used to.  A butter and cream sauce with tomatoes and parsley. It had maybe a little to much parsley but it was good. The shrimp had a nice crust to it.  The steak was cooked to a middle rare and tasted pretty good. Overall pretty good solid meal. I do admit its a little more classy in Hawaii than the others I've been to in the mainland.  The presentation seems different and even the quality.  I could be wrong.      The cheesecake is pretty uniform everywhere.  I liked the Apple Strudel, Mac Nut and Key Lime.  I think I could avoid the Key Lime.  They whip the cream cheese to like a key lime pie.  I rather have a key lime pie.  My absolute favorite here is the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake.  Cheesecake=Good and Pineapple Upside down Cake = Good. Cheesecake factory got the equation right on this one.  Cheesecake + Pineapple Upside Down Cake = Awesomeness! Its not some over sweet mutation.  They balance it out very well.  There is cake, pineapple and cheesecake. Delicious! There is a little to much whip cream but I just don't eat it.     Service was great and the waitress was very nice. This is great because sometimes you don't get good service in a restaurant when it is so crowded.  food came up  fast and they kept the refills flowing.  bonus points for me.  Overall, even though I feel this place is a bit overrated but I do have a pleasant experience every time I eating here.  I know people write and talk about this place like its a god sent. It's good but I'm not so sure its worth fighting traffic, finding parking and fighting off the droves of tourists for a seating at the tourist trap called Waikiki. My recommendation is to eat at a Cheesecake Factory in the Mainland.  I assure you its usually less crowded and a bit cheaper. Recommended but with caution."
Robin K.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,75,18,2.0,5/4/2012,"I love cheesecake factory, but this was by far the worst experience at one and in Oahu. We sat at the bar and the food & drinks were awful.  Only plus was the live band. The bar tender was overwhelmed and couldn't make a good drink if he wanted to."
Koa G.,"Papillion, Omaha, NE",1,53,2,1.0,6/17/2012,"I will never come to this restuarant again...My server was having an off day, and she simply did not do a good job.  The food was so-so...we waited a good 30 min for our food to make it out to us.  Even the manager came out and apologized.  I think our server forgot about us.  I really didnt like anything about this visit.  I have always been a fan of this chain, but today really left a bad taste in my mouth.  Cheesecake...please raise the standards a bit, you are in the heart of waikiki!"
Shelly S.,"Chicago Ridge, IL",77,34,15,4.0,6/16/2012,"My family and I were in Honolulu for vacation.  We decided to have dinner at the Factory.  Two of us had burgers, the other had chicken & pasta.  All very good.  Especially tasty, in my opinion, was the house salad (with vinaigrette dressing).  It was scrumptious!!"
Mace M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",132,370,26,5.0,5/27/2009,"Man, this is by far the best Cheesecake Factory I've been to. Everything about this place says, ""Come here, I am worth it, I will treat you so good!"" Went here with the fam bam, around ~8ish, and waited about twenty minutes, which was more than a pleasant surprise for a bunch of tired, sunburnt, hungry tourists.  We got seating outside on the lanai area, and it was gorgeous, not just because of the weather, but the entire atmosphere and the torches- everything just adds another star, and more thumbs up. We had a great waiter, and crew; we were attended to constantly and never forgotten, it was such a great feeling to have such great service, almost feels like being royalty! The food was great, it seems to me that this CF gave us much, much more food than others I've been to. Also, although we were in the heart of Honolulu, the prices weren't any more than the others I've been to. Five stars for this CF!"
JC C.,"Irvine, CA",1,20,,1.0,8/13/2013,"After a 1 1/2 hour wait, we were seated and approached by our server, Michelle K who remained unfriendly, inattentive and proceeded to rush us through our dinner. I was the first to put in my order and I continued to read the menu selections until Michelle rudely yanked the menu away from me and walked around to take the other's orders. My daughter put in an order for a cocktail which was never brought and when asked about it, our server admitted she forgot to put it in & without an apology! My daughter's pasta was undercooked but she kept it anyway because we didn't want to wait any longer. About 70% through our dinner, she returned to ask about boxes even though none of us were done eating.  Needless to say, I had no intention of leaving a tip even though an 18% gratuity was included for our party of 8.   Worst service ever from this girl and probably the worst ever received at a restaurant anywhere."
Leilani N.,"San Jose, CA",19,185,,4.0,7/1/2009,"I like this Cheesecake Factory better than most other places. It's nice, clean, and the service is usually good too. The last time I went here our server was very attentive, and is among my top 5 best servers of all time. I wish I caught her name... All I know is that she's an older Asian woman (mixed with Chinese/Japanese or something), and reminded me of a sweet grandmother.  Other than great service, the food was on mark. I had the miso salmon because miso is bomb and so is salmon (and together they're wooooonderful). Also, a lot of tourist frequent this place; so, it's often packed to the walls, especially at night."
Linda K.,"Oregon, OH",0,5,,5.0,10/16/2012,"We were in waikiki last week and went to The Cheesecake Factory and enjoyed the cheesecake so much.It was always crowded no matter what time you were there,but we did not mind waiting.Service was great and so was food!We are looking forward to visiting when we come back to Hawaii."
Darci Lee S.,"Honolulu, HI",80,99,242,3.0,4/28/2011,"Had lunch here with a few of my co-workers and we know that the service at Cheesecake wasn't the fastest but on this particular day it was just HORRIBLE. Our waiter was Brett and he didn't seem very motivated at all to work.  He was very slow moving and took his time to service his tables.  We were on a time schedule and every time we looked for Brett he could not be found.  We had to ask the waitress of the other tables to get him for us. We still had to wait a while before we were offered the dessert menu and by this time we had to leave.  Not only did I not enjoy the lunch experience service, I couldn't eat a cheesecake. This place is definitely overrated!"
Frank S.,"Honolulu, HI",12,164,9,4.0,7/3/2011,"You gotta love the CF. Portions are gigantic and consistently good. Only have the cheesecake by itself, it's big too. Was a favorite when I lived in Beverly Hills, the original location."
Aaron S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,13,1,3.0,7/4/2010,"I really don't think there is a single bad item on the menu, but it's really hit or miss with the service here. It's right in the middle of tourist town so sometimes you could be waiting the better part of an hour or more to get seated. Also, this place does not take reservations (my friends like to come here when it's someone's birthday), but the staff will work with you if someone comes early.  Also, if you can resist getting cheesecake, you gotta try the Lemoncello Cream Torte or the Carrot Cake- they are big enough to feed me twice (notice I'm not sharing) and will make you forget any prolonged waiting time you may have endured. Great with coffee!"
Ray H.,"Kaneohe, HI",10,1,,1.0,7/5/2013,"Food is great but people who were handling the cheesecake up at the front counter were very unsanitary.  Witnessed one of the girls handle the cheesecake with her barehand, then wiped her hands on her apron, touched her face and handled the cheesecake again.  Spoke with the manager and he did not even remove the cheesecake from the display."
Raymond H.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,3.0,5/19/2014,"Went in on a weekday, so the wait was fairly short. The price is average for a restaurant in Waikiki. You get what you pay for, in terms of quantity, but it really lacks in quality. I shared a club sandwich and ceasar salad with my girlfriend, both of which were drenched in mayo and dressing respectively. The bread was floppy and thin and too sweet. The ceasar salad was 40% dressing so it felt like I was drinking my salad. I will most likely not return."
Love S.,"Honolulu, HI",421,318,55,3.0,12/4/2008,"Living in Vegas for 5 years, I ate at Cheesecake Factory in Caesers over a hundred times. Don't ask why. I have no answer. I am serious too, 100 times. and there goes Love's street cred on yelp, instantly gone. Since opening in Honolulu 5 years ago, I have eaten at CF, 3 times.  Don't ask why. I have no answer. Nothing on the menu really impresses me, except I like the Ranch and I dip everything in it. I always complain that the chicken lettuce wraps don't come with enough chicken, the scampi is too oily, I don't like the chicken marsala, the salad's aren't healthy, I dig the fried mac n cheese balls but after a couple bites I tank 2 glasses of water, it's rich. Cheesecake is like any other cheesecake but with crazy swirls and toppings. Yet, when I visit Vegas in January, I will probably eat at CF in Caesers. again don't friggin ask. Eat at CF in Honolulu and save the rest of the cool spots for me."
Armando G.,"Houston, TX",38,22,1,3.0,6/26/2012,"Food was a little overpriced, but the portions were large. Ordered the Strawberry Shortcake the cake without the ice cream tasted like a biscuit."
Chrissy K.,"Honolulu, HI",10,84,6,4.0,4/6/2009,"We ate here on a Sunday night at about 5:30.. Our wait for 2 was about 5 minutes!  I live nearby and we were walking around and decided...hey lets eat at cheesecake, it's been awhile. It looked like there was a long line, but it was just people waiting to be taken to their table, people leaving, or people staring at the cheesecake display. I'm sure if it had been 6:30 or 7, there would have been a 45-2hour wait.  Anyhow, we were seated in an uncomfortable section (not a booth...about a foot away from 2 other couples, including a japanese couple that stared the entire time....ugh please stop). We should have requested to move to a booth, next time. The table smelled like dirty rag water a bit (you know when someone is too lazy to change the water in the bucket and they still wipe the table down...yup, that. We ordered quickly...no appetizers because we knew the food was monstrous-ly sized. I got the grande burrito thing, and my eating partner got a chicken bang bang thing (some type of thai chicken and shrimp meal). The burrito was huge, but good...who can mess a wet burrito up? It came with some black beans, cilatro/guac + sour cream. yum. I ate about 1/3 of the burrito and packed it up to go. The burrito cost about 15 dollars, so It's a pretty economical deal. 2 people can eat it at dinner and there's still leftovers for 2 for a late night snack...so it makes it about a 4 dollar meal, 4 times...you get what I'm saying? The chicken +shrimp bang thai meal was just okay. But as leftovers, it was pretty tasty. I hate how they put that gigantic lump of white rice on the plate. It's so unappetizing.  We ended the day with a slice of something raspberry cheesecake. Pretty yum, although I think all the cheesecake flavors are probably decent. so if you want to have a good time at cheesecake in waikiki: eat at 5:30 so you only have to wait 5-15 minutes. Ask for a booth. Dont get an appetizer cuz the portions are huge. Eat cheesecake. The service is really good here. From the host/hostesses, to the servers, to the food-clearers. Everything was so fast and attentive. If you keep getting bad service EVERYwhere...check yourself...are you being a snotty brat? People in the service industry enjoy helping nice people, make it easy for them to be nice to you..."
Amiee L.,"San Diego, CA",326,506,886,4.0,10/18/2009,"The good thing about CF in Waikiki is it was walking distance from our hotel & everytime we went there we knew exactly what we were going to get. Pages & pages of selections....there is everything you want here. Also,  JW Pink Lemonade is also my favorite & the cheesecake is pretty awesome! There is a long wait....all the time....just FYI."
Jaynie K.,"Aiea, HI",167,273,310,3.0,1/7/2009,"Met with old classmates for lunch today. I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory in FL, and once at the Waikiki location as well, but it's been a long while. I remembered the cheesecake being good (well, duh!), but not much else. Ordered the Chicken and Avocado club, which was chicken breast with avocado slices, bacon, swiss cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato slices, and a herb sauce on crisp toasted bread. It smelled fabulous, but the first bite was an omen. The chicken was so tough that I couldn't bite through it. The combo of the bread and cheese and herb sauce was nice, but the chicken itself was tasteless and dry. Downer. Strawberry lemonade was nice, and free refills were a bonus. Ordered a ""Wild Blueberry"" cheesecake which was good.  Service was great. Very helpful server who answered questions well and dealt patiently with us. :) ETA: 4 HOUR free validation when you park at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center structure! Sweet!"
Googleone G.,"Pearl City, HI",4,58,28,5.0,1/10/2012,"Great Steak, Tex Mex Eggrolls and fried Artichoke is good.  Full bar, Daiquiris taste great.  Never had the Desert cause was full after eating the main course. Dinner for two cost about 100 dollars including tip."
Orphanthal J.,"Chelan, WA",0,139,1,1.0,4/1/2014,"Do not go there. Dirty. We went there for dinner, it was packed. Their menu was great. We commented that we would probably eat there several times as it is right across from our hotel. Not. The place is filthy. Our table and silverware was horribly filthy. My bread plate had a crust on, some where between a thick layer of butter and frosting. Our two other plates were dirty and so was the silverware. We asked the bus boy for the manager. He asked what was wrong and when we told him our setting was dirty, he said ""that's been happening"". The manager came out, sent a new service over and cleaned the table. Our new plates were much cleaner, but still dirty. They looked clean, but if you felt them you could feel the grime on allow three. I wet my napkin and cleaned it and it was smooth. When the waiter came by, we asked for the manager and showed him the dishes. He felt a plate and said they had been having this problem. We asked for the manager and he never came back. We left, we don't need to get sick on the first of 10 days on vacation. Too bad this place is so dirty as the menu looked good and the location worked for us."
