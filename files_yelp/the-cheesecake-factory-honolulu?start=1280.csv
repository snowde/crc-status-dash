Marisa O.,"Honolulu, HI",43,141,,2.0,2/22/2009,"Okay, I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times in Honolulu, and I've been there in San Francisco also. I've gotta say, San Francisco trumps ANY Honolulu experience I've ever had. The food is the same, but the service in Honolulu is SOOOOO BAD that I won't eat in the restaurant in Honolulu anymore. We do takeout. For example, I ordered a Jambalaya on my last visit, and it came with undercooked chicken. It took the waitress 25 minutes to check back with our table. By then I just didn't want it anymore. On another visit, I had a waitress that barely made eye contact with our table, took forever to bring us our drinks, and then became animated only at the time when she brought our check.  That being said, I've had decent servers, and even good servers, but generally, service is poor. Not at all like other locations."
CM B.,"Osseo, MN",0,67,13,5.0,1/5/2014,"I was extremely resistant to go here while in Hawaii because I can go to The Cheesecake Factory back home.  But my family convinced me, especially after I went to their website and saw their menu prices were spot on to what we would pay at the location back home.  You have to wait at least an hour or two for dinner, but the service, food and price is well worth it!  We ate close to our hotel for the majority of our stay in Waikiki, so that was another reason we went here.  The next night we did Mexican and our last night we did a New York style pizzeria.  After spending the money we did on those restaurants, I told my wife we should have ate at The Cheesecake Factory most nights we were there.  You just can't beat the quality of food, full service bar, excellent wait staff, and comparable prices to other restaurants in the same area.  And if they ask if you want a menu in a different language, consider it another extension of their hospitality."
Laurie K.,"Leland, NC",70,92,,2.0,10/21/2011,Big disappointment...no reserv ations taken or allowed...the wait is ridiculous when we can get the same food back home and not spend hours sitting...they need to reconsider policy and at least allow a call ahead...
Darryl K.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,170,47,5.0,12/21/2013,"Great Kobe beef burger. Service was friendly, food was tasty and price was reasonable. This place is one of my favourites in the area. Highly recommended."
Michelle T.,"Pago Pago, American Samoa",32,28,32,4.0,11/19/2011,"Love this place it's crazy if you don't get there before 6pm after 6pm you can expect wait a half and hour or longer. Every time I have gone here food has been fast and fresh. We learned the hard way by ordering a few appetizers the first time and then getting the free bread and our huge portion of great food. It was just too much food plus I had to order cheesecake just to add more boxes and bags to carry out with. We literally looked like we just grocery shopped from there. I have nothing bad to say about this place it's clean, friendly, efficient service is what I have always had and this place will continue to be one of my favorite eatery."
Rubi W.,"Honolulu, HI",27,2,,5.0,10/21/2012,My favorite lunch spot..They listen to my order and always get it right. Which is worth 5 stars by itself. Who has time to keep sending orders back?? Customer service is on point!
Ryan H.,"Chantilly, VA",52,10,2,4.0,3/10/2011,"""Dude, you wanna go to Cheesecake Factory?""  With those lines uttered (via text message...yay technology!), who am I to back down?!  Thus started the epic man-date.  Not quite a bro-mance, but most definitely a man-date.  Now, I've been to Cheesecake Factory on several occasions...most of them started with the bar and ended there.  In fact, every occasion had started and ended that way.  This time we had opted for a dinner.   For some unholy reason, this place is a mecca for tourist.  If you want to get a table, you should arrive early and expect to wait.  HOWEVER, the area near the bar is somewhat of a free for all.  We quickly made our way to a table with room to spare.  Although the area was pretty busy, our waiter was still courteous and prompt with our orders.  I'm a fish man, and ordered the Sesame crusted Mahi Mahi served with stir-fried vegetables and fried noodles.  Broseph ordered the Hibachi steak.  It's pretty dark in the Factory, but the vegetables on my platter were super bright with color.  A definite plus.  The mahi cooked to a medium melts in the mouth!  The fried noodles I wasn't really digging though.  The fried noodles reminded me of half-way cooked ramen noodles.  I got to try the Hibachi steak (as my buddy tried some of my fish...food trade?).  It was cooked at a perfect medium.  I did not know Cheesecake could make such good steak!  Definitely my next order.   So the food definitely gets my thumbs up.  What really set the mood for this man-date was the live music.  Two musicians: 1 guitarist, 1 bassist.  Starting off with some Jim Morrison and working their way to the present.  We reached the 80's with Jesse's Girl.  But really set it off was the acoustic renditions of Rihanna and BoB feat. Bruno Mars (Beautiful Girls).  For two old guys with smiles to the extreme, they knew how to rock the crowd.  You could tell by the single Japanese tourist standing in the front, clapping, and getting his kabuki on.  There was a gentleman at the bar who was REALLY enjoying himself.  As the music ended, so did his night.  He managed to fall backwards and practically break his ass and nearly took me with him.  In a daze, he stood up and calmly walked out....like a boss!   Tonight I realized that Cheesecake Factory is more than just a meeting grounds for having a couple of cocktails at the beginning of the night.  With food this good, entertaining drunkards, and prompt service, it's a definite visit.  My only complaint would be how BUSY this place can feel.  With so many people wandering about, it gets loud and can feel like you're eating in a food court with a buddy rather than being on a candle lit man-date."
David C.,"Honolulu, HI",13,118,28,3.0,10/16/2011,"Im thinking they must have won some kind of record for the amount of selections on their menu. For me, it's simple. Grilled Cheese! However I'm struggling with trying to convince myself the food is worth the consistent 1hr+ wait."
Jen T.,"Gulfport, MS",134,273,487,5.0,3/18/2013,"We spent the last nine days in Waikiki and of course eating out is a huge part of vacation experience. We battled through the crowd twice to have dinner here this last week and we were not disappointed!. The popularity of the restaurant is obvious if you try to walk in during dinner hours and even worse during weekends. You could look at 1-2 hours wait time. Go early, have not tried late ( open pretty late ) but if you are looking for great food and awesome service this is your place.  The first night was very good and we went with family that loved the place. My husband and son went alone a couple days later and there was a huge crowd with a very long wait.  We knew from past experience that a few spots in the bar are first come, first serve. We narrowed in on one of four high tops in the main bar and we were ordering 15 minutes later.  We never got a table pager because there was a two hour wait and they were out of pagers lol! Food is very good, service awesome, and you leave with leftovers. We have had Cheese Cake Factory in Riverside, Ca, San Diego, and Denver, and the service and food is always consistently great. Definite stop if your visiting Waikiki!!"
Scott H.,"Honolulu, HI",79,283,437,4.0,6/22/2009,"First of...this place is the reason SNL and Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson made that skit about tourists in Hawaii!  (   )  There will be tourists in bathing suit bottoms and t-shirts...you may see a red/white okole crack here and there...ambiance takes a hit at this place... Food:  Started with the Ahi carpaccio...amazing.  Ahi pounded thin and creamy, with a nice aioli on top, with some black sesame seeds on top and a couple slices of avocado.  Served with a light seasame seed dressing/dipping sauce...best part of the entire meal. I had the fish and chips.  The cod was great, perfectly cooked and battered.  Chips...plain American style fries...nothing special...(though expensive) Wife had the lettuce wraps for her entrée (usually a appetizer)...  Huge portion, with enough to feed four for an appetizer. Ended the meal with a Oreal mud chocolate cheesecake...amazing. Service:  My waiter was great.  Kept the drinks filled.    Entree's took a while to arrive, but otherwise good service. Will validate your parking for up to four hours!"
bucca d.,"Honolulu, HI",2,32,,3.0,12/31/2010,"We waited for about 1.25hrs and ate for about 1.5hrs and got a 3hr stamp. We also found out we had parked in the wrong lot. B careful about that and don't park in the sheraton hotel lot!!!  Anyways as for food my wife ordered the chicken medeira which was fantastic! The chicken breast was cooked perfectly with mushrooms, white cheese, and some semi sweet wine sauce almost similar to flavor to spaghetti factory's chicken marsala. The side of red skinned garlic mashed potatoes and crispy crunchy green fresh asparagus was stellar. This dish deserved a 5 star. I ordered the fish and chips. The fish are 5 half palm sized cods which is essentially butter fish. The beer batter was good and the french fries were crispy with enough salt and the side of cole slaw was very nice. However the cod was overcooked and chewy - not how cod is supposed to be; this completely ruined it for me. Also i was expecting to taste some butterfish flavor in it which i wasn't able to until the very last chewy bite. This dish gets a 1 star from me. Hence this place gets 3 stars for our food that night. The wheat bread and sourdough they gave us before our meal was delicious especially after a 1.25 hr wait. Service was good. Ambiance was noisy as expected, but more so because we were seated right in from of a two band group pounding drums and all."
Kim W.,"Dupont, WA",55,102,8,4.0,9/27/2011,"Lunch and dinner is ok, my friends and I are no more impressed with it than Chili's.  But on a positive note, the portions are huge. But the desserts are wonderful!  Any of their cheesecakes are to die for and more than enough to share one slice for two people.  I also love the Reese's PB Cup Cheesecake Cake and the Strawberry Shortcake (real biscuits).  This place is so busy every night of the week that we never have the patience to wait anymore (1-2 hour wait on the weekend at night).  We often get the desserts to go which only takes 5minutes to get and then we head to the food court in the Royal Hawaiian Center and gobble the treats down.  Perfect place to get dessert :)"
Brooke P.,"Gurley, AL",8,16,,4.0,7/25/2012,"Huge portions, but were out of every kind of fish. Really? Fettuccine Alfredo was great, and the cheesecake is always obviously amazing. As for the service, it would've been the same if I had gone to the kitchen and gotten it myself."
Ronald T.,"Honolulu, HI",2,35,,4.0,12/26/2011,"I've been here quite a few times with the wife before and enjoyed my experiences enough.  Coming home from a Christmas dinner tonight, I felt like giving some props to Cheesecake Factory.  Packed to the brim from 6:00 to when we left at 10:00, the wait time was 2.5 hours!  Impressively, they operated smoothly considering the circumstances.  Our food came promptly and the service was decent enough.  My farmhouse burger with  fried egg and pork belly tucked nicely into one helluva messy burger, was a knockout.  The fries were mediocre and the bread was a little cold but the burger made enough of an impression on me to leave me feeling wonderful.  Well done Cheesecake Factory!  Did not expect to say that after such a long wait but there you have it."
Glenda S.,"Waianae, HI",1,4,,5.0,7/22/2012,"My friends and I ate at the Cheesecake Factory last night and we had a great time dining there. Due to it's popularity in the center of Waikiki Beach, we decided to go early because we knew the wait will be long since they don't take reservations. And it so happened to be an hour wait.  When we finally got seated we were introduced to probably the best server in the entire restaurant. Her name is Chonte and she was fabulous! Servers can sometimes make or break the dining experience and Chonte made it wonderful for us.  She knew everything about the menu and gave excellent recommendations. She was always came by to check up on us and refilled our waters at the right time.  As for the food, I ordered the miso salmon (thanks to Chonte) and I loved it!. It was served over a bed of rice (I got brown rice) and with a miso and butter sauce, if I'm not mistaken? Generous portion size but I tried my hardest to finish it all because it was so delicious. I don't know the names of the dishes my friends ordered but I sampled the fried macaroni and cheese and that was yummy. Overall we were all pleased with the food we ordered. Now going on with the cheesecake, I loved the banana cream pie cheesecake and pineapple upside down cheesecake. But to be honest I only had two bites because I was soo full from dinner.  I love coming here, especially with friends. We are all on from the westside so trust that we traveled far to get some of their scrumptious food. We loved it and we will definitely come back!"
Jin W.,"Honolulu, HI",26,37,8,2.0,10/10/2011,Horrible mash; how do u mess that up? Tons of salt in it more than a jerky no joke.  All the entrees with mash was like this....clearly no quality control - no way someone tasted this. The other foods were good.  Server did nothing to correct the issue...
Keoki H.,"Kaneohe, HI",3,73,8,2.0,2/1/2009,"First off to the tourist, You deserve to be separated from your money!!!  Why did you spend so much money to fly here and eat at the Cheese cake factory?????? Get with your hotel Concierge and find some local food. Besides Hawaiian, with all our ethnic groups here you can find some fantastic Japanese, Filipino, Chinese hole in the walls to restaurants that the flavors of the food, the ambiance, even looking around at the customers makes you feel like you are somewhere else besides Kansas. Please drift away from Waikiki and move out to other areas of Oahu.  The score seems to be  28 votes 4 and 5 stars totaled;  16 votes 3 stars;  11 votes 2 and 1 stars;  Looks like my 2 star vote will now tie the 4 and 5 stars with the average and below average grade.  I really don't get the high 4 and 5 star votes unless they were voting for the Cheesecake.  I will admit the cheese cake is good, really good. They are called the cheese cake factory so their specialty should be the cheese cake not the main meal. Kinda like going to a steak house the steak should be really good. (reason I fail Buzz's steak house, their steak sucks but fish is really good, yet they call themselves a steak house).  Anyways, back to on track with CF. I try to stay away from anything Waikiki but sometimes you got to go for visitors or someones bright (dim) idea.  Here is the low down on Cheesecake Factory (CF).  Cheesecake really good, expensive but Waikiki is a expensive place so  no mater where you go on Waikiki you have to expect to pay more.  Everything else like steaks, salads, ect... really are poor. I suggest go for the cheese cake but not the main meal you will be disappointed by their main meals.  I have had their Cesar salad both times, not good at all. a 1 star.  My wife has had a couple of their appetizers put together to make her meal and share with me. I just grade them as okay, a 2 star okay.  There are long lines to get in, very long lines.  Parking and the traffic to drive there is difficult. The parking garage is generally full and parking spots all seem to be compact car, extra small.  I would say not good for kids only because of the long wait to get in and the crowded seating once you get in.  Not good for groups, no design for big tables, long waits to sit 4.  I would go at lunch shorter lines to get in. Night time is incredibly long. It's nothing to wait 45+min. at night.  I do not consider them affordable in their price."
Cody C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,112,5,5.0,12/12/2011,Great food and service as always. Always the best place to go for dinner with fresh bread served unlimited.
Molly C.,"Burnaby, Canada",0,15,2,5.0,2/27/2015,loved the habachi steak！！we also ordered shepherds pie、which was really genius cuz its just  meatball and gravy with mashed potato on top，but it was hearty and filling after a days activity at beach. we went around 5 so there was no lineup. service was exceptional. wish we had this place in vancouver
