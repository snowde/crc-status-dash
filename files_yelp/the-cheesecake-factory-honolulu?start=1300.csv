Kyle H.,"Honolulu, HI",240,335,1472,3.0,8/19/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of the better chain restaurants in terms of food offerings and food quality.  Great appetizers, great entrees, and of course great desserts!  Portion sizes are also enormous, with entrees often being large enough to feed two people.  I really like the Crusted Chicken Ramano, their omelets, the fried mac & cheese, and especially the Godiva cheesecake.  Soy why 3 stars?  90% of the time I go here, the host completely ignores that fact that I'm there and will assist the people standing behind me.  As a result, it is a rarity that I go."
Cassie P.,"Honolulu, HI",113,100,4,5.0,3/25/2009,NOTE: This rating is STRICTLY for the CHEESECAKE!!! We've been living right in this area for a while now and just recently splurged on two cheesecake pieces to go. Oreo Cheesecake and the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake.  Sweet mother of Jesus.
Susan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,136,,3.0,3/7/2011,Just had dinner at Cheesefactory. Picked chrimp/ chicken Thai curry dish which was delicious. The sweet coconut tate mixed with hot curry was a special dish. I highly recommend. Of ourse don't miss the original cheesecake.
n c.,"Honolulu, HI",0,26,,5.0,10/16/2009,"I just returned from lunch here, but I am going to base this review on the MANY times I have eaten here instead ('cause that tall dude waiter didn't live up to the quality of service I'm used to at this place). PROS: Appetizers: Avocado spring rolls, Tex-Mex egg rolls, Kalua Pork Nachos (wife's choice) Entrees:  Shrimp Bistro Pasta, Chicken Farfale, Fish Tacos, Kobe Burger, Chicken Piccata Desserts:  What can I say?  All good.  Red Velvet Cheesecake is unreal.  Whilte Choc Rasperry Truffle, Caramel Apple Strudel.....awesome (the staff here are always willing to share their favorites, which I like). Not a cheesecake fan?  No prob.  The Godiva Brownie Sundae can feed an army and is awesome.  Or try the Warm Apple Crisp smothered in vanilla ice cream. CONS: Parking: it's a walk to a distant garage, but after eating here that's probably not a bad thing! (I miss the valet parking they used to have) Crowds:  If you don't like to wait (like me), go at off-peak times: before they open at 11am for lunch or no later than 5pm for dinner. Food is almost always great and served to everyone @ same time (except today).  If you have small kids, they usually bring bread w/sliced bananas at no charge. For the critics who say it's not local:  what about the music,  staff atttire, & setting (torches, ceiling fans)?  Also, do they offer the same fish selections and Kalua Pork dishes @ the other ones?  I've been to Vegas & Anaheim and noticed a lot of differences.  Just a thought."
Faith S.,"Derby, KS",9,24,4,5.0,11/23/2011,so the first thing ppl normally complain about is the 1 1/2 hr wait to get into this place but it was nooo problem for us :} we walked across the street to Jimmy Buffets for a few margaritas to kills some of the time!! he head back over the last 30 minutes & enjoy ourself in the atmosphere & ppl watch. the service is awesome. the last time we went we took the inlaws there. i like that when we asked the server's opinion about soem of the dishes she actually says why she didnt like a few & then suggested a few saying why she did like them. so of course we tried what she suggested & awwwwesome!!!  portions for the price is surprisingly big!!! a great evening! great for a large group. & kid friendly if they can deal with the 1 1/2 wait .lol. make sure they bring a DS or something to keep them occupied in the mean time!
Teresa S.,"Honolulu, HI",1,19,1,3.0,1/9/2012,"I agree that this Cheesecake Factory holds up it's reputation as good, reliable and fun. They do have tasty and pricey cheesecake. With the wait time up to more than an hour at peak times such as dinner and lunch.... I prefer others, I like to live a little and try something new. If you haven't been to a Cheesecake factory the one in Redondo Beach, Calif is the one to try. Right on the ocean, outside seating or the regular noisey indoor seating as the this one. The Honolulu location is like any other indoor restaurant. If you sit outdoors on the patio have people staring at you as they walk down the busiest sidewalk  on any of the Hawaiian islands.  No view unless you like to look at badly dressed tourists...Chucks and Shorebird both have views and in the same area in Honolulu.  You're on a Island don't spend your time waiting for a table that won't remind you you're in the tropics but will make you think you're back in the city. If you're the typical tourist not looking for adventure this is a safe bet and if you have kids that are loud they won't bother anyone here."
Lindsey A.,"San Jose, CA",143,455,22,4.0,7/13/2009,"I, personally, am not a big fan of chain restaurants. Cheesecake Factory is the exception to my rule, though, because their food is so damn tasty and huge (you get what you pay for).  I was super excited about finding a Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki after being repeatedly disappointed by the food there.  We were seated with our two month old daughter in a HUGE booth-- SCORE! She lied down on the seat in between us as we ate which is soooooo wonderful because we actually got to eat instead of trying to quiet her down the whole meal. Our server was really super nice and very accommodating.  I got the Chicken Costoletta, my husband got the Miso Salmon lunch special, and we shared an Endive Blue Cheese salad. All of them were good, but not quite as good as we've had at other Cheesecake Factories.  Although the food wasn't as good as we've had at others, the sheer availability of it while on vacation gives this Cheesecake Factory a 4 star for me!"
Jac G.,"Jacksonville, NC",10,61,17,4.0,10/1/2011,"My husband and I went here on a thursday night around 7, and the wait time was roughly 45 minutes. But let me tell you the food was good, especially the cheesecake, and it's a good size portion. I love the atmosphere(inside) there was also a live band playing even taking request."
Deshawnalynn F.,"Aiea, HI",9,6,,2.0,12/25/2013,"Okay, first let me say this is in Waikiki, where many tourists go throughout their day. Now you would think their ""Aloha"" spirit would be amazing. My boyfriend and I went in the evening, and boy were they busy. Our first time here together, and we're locals now. So got there around 6:30, and got seated by 7:20 which wasn't bad. Yes I'd admit their front desk/ where you check in was slammin, it was our time to stand by to get seated. When all of a sudden this poor guy, that hardly understands english tries to get one the front desk employee's attention. By saying ""Excuse me"" and the staff turns around and says with a irritated voice "" Sir I can hear you, and see you, I'm right here. I'll be right with you!"" Woooooowwww, shhhhesshhhh, like brah calm down. What makes it worse is the girls that takes you to your seat, starts laughing. UNBELIEVABLE Our waitress was really nice, and cool. Drinks and food was delishhhhBig Mahalo to our waitress for awesome customer service! Front desk people should work on their Customer Service, and Aloha Spirit much more often"
Janice O.,"Honolulu, HI",22,35,8,5.0,5/1/2011,"First time there last month with the family. Decided to do a ""staycation"" . It was fun being in Waikiki. Went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. Wow was it packed! Didn't realize how big it was. Waited about 40 minutes but worth the wait!  Food was excellent! I had the Cajun linguine and it was awesome. My son had the Da Vinci penne and that was good too!  But the lilikoi cheesecake was to die for!  Food came out piping hot. Waitress was really nice. Service was excellent. Now I know what the big fuss is about that place. Would definitely go there again!"
Nicole C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",502,523,674,4.0,7/9/2009,"Yes, yet again another chain restaurant...but when you LIVE in Hawaii sometimes Cheesecake Factory sounds good compared to all the Pan-Asian places on the island.  I cannot understand tourists that travel all the way to Hawaii and go to places like this...c'mon you're on vacation you should try the local fare! This is a nice, cheesecake factory. Clean and great staff!  One time, I was waiting for my dinner companion who was stuck in traffic coming from Hawaii Kai for over 2 hours because some idiot tried to rob a bank during Rush Hour and ended up getting in a car accident closing down most of the Hwy!  Instead of pressuring me to order or even leave, because they were BUSY... they kept checking on me and bringing me more cocktails... it ended up turning out to be a great night! Never had bad service here before and the food is always consistent!"
Voneezy S.,"Chula Vista, CA",6,187,68,4.0,5/26/2012,"Like many Cheesecake factories through out, they are always busy during peak days and hours.  On a wednesday night from 8:30pm, we waited about an hour for a table. When we finally got seated, the service was great. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. We did not feel rushed to leave as they were closing. They waited patiently and when we were done catching up with old friends, they greeted us goodbye. Thanks for the service."
AsianRunningDiva S.,"Waialua, HI",58,271,1,3.0,7/4/2011,"HOLY SMOKES! We got there last night at 8p, and there was a line to get the pagers!!! Granted, it was a holiday weekend, but a 1.5 hour wait at 8p on a Sunday? We would never have gone here, but we had a gift certificate, and decided to try it! Luck would have it though, the bar had 2 open seats, so we sat and got served immediately! The high top tables are first come first serve, so if you can stake one out, grab it and you won't have to wait 1.5 hours for a table! There is also another smaller bar in the way back, but has less seats than the front bar (the far bar is a lot quieter if you are looking for that). The Big Island Iced Tea was a little too sweet (more juice than alcohol) and they only have 4 beers on tap (Kirin, Longboard, Bud Light, Fir Rock). Our bartender was great! He got us set up to eat (he laid out a white linen napkin to simulate a tablecloth!)...We started with the Thai Lettuce Wraps...AWESOME! It came on a huge plate with carrots, sprouts, cucumbers, chicken, noodles, 3 sauces, and bib lettuce. You assemble your own wrap with whatever you want in it and top it with sauce (a peanut, a basil, and a soy)! It came out really fast because once we ordered it, the bartender immediately put it into the computer for the kitchen! We then ordered the Tex Mex eggrolls filled with beans, corn, chicken...not spicy, but flavorful! Came with salsa and guac! Also very good and also came out really fast! Service at the bar was excellent...they are back there working really hard and quickly to make drinks and serve their bar customers! The service and food were great (mixed drinks could be a little better), but the wait time, is RIDICULOUS! We most likely won't be coming back because there are other restaurants that don't have such a long wait, but it was a great night! :)"
Catt G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,147,6,4.0,12/5/2008,"I'd avoided going to this chain for months assuming it had nothing to offer--especially because its in the heart of tourist-land--but its actually good food at reasonable prices. Fish & chips are awesome, the giant burrito is Ok, salads have been tasty, and the fries, too. Anyway, the basics are done well enough, and if you can remember to split the giant portions, the bill won't give you a heart attack (uh....but the food might). Haven't ordered any cheesecake yet, but only because I am avoiding the feeling of fat-cow-dom. Anyway, Cheesecake is also great for running like a machine: they see you, sit you, take your order, get it to you, and check on you every now and then to see how you are doing, and everything is so fast and efficient, yet not rushed. In that part of Waikiki, it is a good first choice spot."
Karebear W.,"Honolulu, HI",150,152,43,4.0,12/14/2011,"Went to Cheesecake Factory for my friend's birthday and although the restaurant was busy, there was minimal wait time.  The seating area is private with semi-circular booths available."
Corey G.,"West Richland, WA",100,1545,1642,3.0,12/16/2008,"Stopped here for a ""last meal"" before heading back to civilization.  Went for a Kobe beef burger, and it was decent.  Had my last official Hawaiian mai tai of the trip and it was decent (I know, I know, I'm corny and not inventive, but had to have another mai tai). We were given a little bit of a scolding for grabbing a booth which bordered the bar area.  ""Normally, we'd have to kick you off this table, but since its dead in here, you can stay,"" we were told.  Ummm...ok, thanks."
B T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,59,1,2.0,11/26/2012,"I went to the ones in Maryland, Honolulu, and Westchester, NY. Overall I think the cheesecake taste good but I don't like the texture. My cheesecakes always seems to get mushy after a while, texture is similar to mousse. Even though I am pleased that the cheesecakes come in a variety of flavors, I rather Junior's Cheesecake as far as texture is concerned. I had the Mahi Mahi dinner and it wasn't good, my fish wasn't cooked in some parts and taste bland on it's own. However the mash and tomatoes vinaigrette that came with that meal was genius, the taste profiles definitely went well together and made my tongue do a happy dance in my mouth. If Cheesecake Factory Honolulu would've served the mash with the tomatoes vinaigrette minus the Mahi Mahi I would have been elated. I wouldn't have complained one bit. Cheesecake Factory Maryland is the first place that I ordered the Corn Tamale that my aunt recommended...OMG I thought I was in heaven....it was so savory...it had a bit of salt, a bit of sweet, a bit of tangy, a bit of acid, a bit of everything you can think of....It was so good that I was hooked and anytime someone said they were going to Cheesecake Factory...I made sure I grabbed my keys and coat and dashed out the door. I was addicted to the Corn Tamale....lmao."
Diane S.,"Houston, TX",306,948,153,4.0,6/5/2011,"Great location, great food and wonderful atmosphere. Hawaiian live music playing. Has loco moco a local dish hamburger with gravy rice and eggs which my buddy got. Really classy and healthy looking here. portions are huge and prices are moderate but well worth it. Eat here so good!"
Cheryl H.,"Pearl City, HI",2,17,,4.0,1/31/2012,"I had an appetizer and cheesecake. The appetizer kalua pork pizza it was ok, wild blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake awesome! The service was also great. I think it was one of the only times I went that we were seated right away, usually I've had to wait over an hour to be seated."
Claudia M.,"Fort Shafter, HI",160,316,200,4.0,6/24/2011,"Came here on a thursday afternoon, the place was pretty full but we got seated right away which was cool. The waitress was very nice to us and told us their specials for the day. The food is a little pricey here so you better dig a little deep in  your wallets for some really delicious and tasty food. Once we were done we got some of their signature cheesecakes, which were about $8-$9 a piece. Their cheesecakes were delicious and well worth the price."
