Gunther W.,"Mililani, HI",59,88,24,4.0,6/3/2011,"Went for a quick bite last night. I got the pasta carbonara and wife got pasta Da Vinci. They were both really good, but the madeira sauce on the da vinci was the best part of it. I was pressed for time and we got our order in and were done eating in about 30 minutes. If you plan to go anytime on the weekend or around 6pm on week days, you might as well plan on waiting with the pager."
Natasha C.,"Wahiawā, HI",22,45,9,4.0,8/12/2011,"Been to another location on the mainland.. Gotta say this one is so much better. The interior is beautiful... It's stays busy but waiters were still very friendly... Even on a packed Saturday night! I really wasn't expecting too much when it came to the service but was pleasantly surprised!!! Portions are insanely large and food is very good! Filet mignon was good but was lacking some flavor! Cheesecakes of course were amazing!!! Flying monkey (drink) is a beautiful concoction.... I've heard you can drink a few and not even realize your drunk! ;) Good place to have fun with friends, not quite the location for a romantic dinner."
Ed P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",430,47,31,4.0,10/22/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory in the Waiks is an experience like no other.  By day - you are surrounded by good weather, beautiful beach-combers, tourists from around the world, and locals evoking the Aloha Spirit - all enjoying te famous Waikiki Strip, Kalakaua St. At night, the Strip turns into a vibrant  spectacle where your dining experience is yet again, raised to another level. We have been here so many times, I don't even know where to begin with the food. Tasty appetizers. Good entrees with hearty portions. All I can say is order what you are in the mood for! But as for the dessert, ah, let me tell you. And that is, you have got to try the Cheesecake exclusive to the Waiks. The Pineapple Cheesecake. If no can eat Pineapple, fo' shame. But if can, go eat!  Its delectable!!! Overall, Cheesecake offers good food at good prices, and always delivers good service. And as for the long wait in lines, RELAX! You are in Hawaii! Isn't the cool vibes supposed to mellow you out?? Don't worry, the food ain't goin' nowhere!  When to go: Dinner time, after sunset. Kalakaua is at its best at night! Where to sit: Patio for people watching. But anywhere is good really Be prepared: To wait in line...Yup...Uh huh...Waiting...Uhm, ya... Why come here: For the people-watching, music, food, and cheesecake, of course!"
Elise F.,"Midway Point, Australia",0,12,,5.0,2/28/2015,"so glad we waited the 50mins for a table! servers were all friendly and helpful. menu is huge & food was perfect. chicken & shrimp gumbo was very tasty and crispy buffalo chicken burger was incredible! couldn't even think about cheesecake by the time we'd finished, it was so filling, but will definitely go back and order from the take away station. (while waiting, read the menu by the door & decide what you want before you go in, it'll save some time when you're really hungry!)"
T C.,"Edmonton, Canada",1,69,92,3.0,2/14/2007,"When I arrived for supper the restaurant was busy. There was an overflow crowd waiting to be seated. I went to the front desk, gave my name and was given a pager. Fifteen  minutes later the pager went off and I was escorted to a table. We started with a pair of glasses of the THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY Chardonnay.  Nothing special there. The market salad and a crab cake sandwich were delicious. The strawberry cheesecake was a fitting end to the meal. The service was fine. I'll return."
Colie J.,"Lafayette, CO",13,208,105,5.0,7/31/2009,"Yes, that is right I am reviewing yet ANOTHER Cheesecake Factory. This one is a prime location and the food was great. Our waitress was a little slow to come to the table, get my husband a refill on his drink, then bring the jelly, and check back after our plates had been cleared.  All was forgivable except the jelly since my husband waited to eat his english muffins until he had the jelly and so they weren't warm anymore. However, since the food didn't suck (like Boulder, CO) they get 5 stars.  If you have never been to one, they rarely disappoint.  The few times I have been disappointed (SF when they scraped sour cream off my food and Arlington, TX when they first opened and they brought me the wrong food 3 times) a talk with the manager has usually cleared it up. While most CFs have the exact same menu this one did a have a little Hawaiian flair added with Kahula pork available on the factory nachos and macadamia nut crusted fish (and others I don't remember). Again, come try it because no matter who you are with I am sure there is something for everyone. We came in at 3:00pm on a Friday and had no wait.   I was a little surprised that my strawberry martini was $12.  I thought it was $9 the last time I ordered one and while there is that toursit/Hawaiian extra added to the tab, $3 would be excessive for one drink.  However, I could just be mistaken about the $9! In all, I walked away not pissed off at another $65 meal. [two apps, two entrees, one strawberry lemonade and one martini]"
Brandon L.,"Spring Hill, TN",41,165,127,4.0,9/12/2010,"I  have loved the cheesecake factory for many, many years. Especially when its the one in Hawaii. That makes it all so much better! Great food, great environment."
Tony V.,"Fullerton, CA",32,1,,1.0,12/4/2014,"The last time I ever come to this restaurant again. It seems like they don't want to help you unless you smell like money. I may not be flashy but Im more then capable of eating at this place and leaving a good time if there service warrants it. It all started when we were in line and a flashy lady jumped in front of us and told the host how many she had in her party. When we confronted (politely) told the lady that there was a line the host seated her first anyways and told us to wait to one side. By the time we did get seated we had to sit and wait for 10mins and we still haven't even gotten water all the while the couple next to us which came in after us got there water  and was able to place there order while we sat there and waited. In stead of causing a seen which I feel that I should have done. We just got up and walked away. One incident, I can pass it on as the person is rude or forgot but two. I think that reflects on management. Anyways my money is as good as anyone elses and if I cant get the same treatment. Then that's the last time Ill be there."
Bear A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,1/7/2012,"Although the food is not that special, I like to go here once in a while.  But today, I was totally disappointed.  We waited in line to be on the waiting list. The two Caucasian guys in front of us were told that the waiting time will be 30min. But when we went to put our names down after them, the girl told us that the waiting time for two of us will be 1hour and 20min. How could it be 1 hour and 20 min wait when it was only 30 min for the two guys right in front of us!???? I felt that it was a discrimination. Btw, we are local Chinese and Japanese. Later on, I went back here to look at their cheesecakes, and I over heard the same girl telling two Caucasian customers that the waiting time would be 30min and told the two middle eastern customers that the waiting minutes will be 1 hour and 20min!!!!! What is up with that!? That is a discrimination! She totally ruined my night!"
Stef H.,"Kailua, HI",1,35,1,1.0,2/17/2011,"Seriously, you are dumb if you eat here.  I see mostly tourists waiting for hours outside this place.  Why would you fly all the way out to Hawaii to eat at the Cheesecake Factory!?!?!  You can get it pretty much anywhere on the mainland.  Plus the food is super rich and I believe it is a big contributor to the obesity epidemic.  One may say there isn't a lot of options in Waikiki... I say they aren't doing their yelp research."
Brian S.,"Orange County, CA",3,113,32,4.0,7/20/2011,"We live in SoCal and frequent CKF quite often.  This restaurant is exactly what we expected; good food and huge portions.  Get here super early or one hour before you are hungry.  This place looks like the Disneyland rides; giant crowds and long waits.  The food is actually quite reasonable as the prices are outrageous here in Waikiki.  For $70 bucks, I fed my family of 4 (with 4 non alcoholic drinks).  That is a bargain here in Waikiki."
cristian c.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,9,,3.0,8/21/2009,"I went to the factory around 8pm, it was super packed...its always busy. Well after waiting for a while we finally get seated.  i had a mojito, it was alright...a bit weak. But the food is great and the bread is on point. Its quite expensive but well worth it. If you guys are around why not check it out."
Marg H.,Australia,1,11,,4.0,1/3/2013,"Great food once you eventually get in, good to get there at 530pm for dinner only waited about 35mins, huge choice and reasonable prices, best cheesecake ""Banana Cream"" not too sweet, the Red Velvet more like a cake & very rich, very large serves, too much for one best too share, even the appetizers are huge, nachos was great would recommend if you have a big appetite & have patience & don't mind the touristy atmosphere"
Adam L.,"Honolulu, HI",6,8,8,4.0,12/14/2013,I went to The Cheesecake Factory for the first time last night.  It was definitely worth the two hour wait to get in.  The Hibachi Steak was great!  The tiramisu cheesecake was awesome too!
Gerry E.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",11,63,12,5.0,4/20/2011,"Wonderful Food, Great Location, and the Desserts........   Heavenly, to say the least.  The staff is Friendly, good service, also."
Edwina K.,"Honolulu, HI",125,149,17,4.0,9/7/2008,"We always say that we will not take visiting family members to any chain restaurants however after two weeks of vacation days, Cheescake Factory always seems to slide into the dining experience. Yeah there are long lines but you can't beat the tropical setting here: tiki torches and live Hawaiian music.  This is probably the best Cheescake location I have dined in and many of our family and friends confirm this theory.  I swear the food tastes better here. I love their Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls.  And I usually order their Lettuce Thai wraps as my entree.  Their portions are HUGE.  But I always seem to have room for cheescake:)"
Justin O.,"Verdun, Canada",4,88,118,2.0,3/27/2011,I was not impressed at all with the Cheesecake Factory. The food was mediocre American food for the price. I don't think I would go there again unless I had to.
Christina A.,"Pasadena, CA",10,9,,4.0,9/14/2009,"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat!  So far, never had anything I didn't like. The service has always been great. I love the atmosphere...on some nights they have live music. Here are some of my favorites: -Avocado Spring Rolls (A must-try if you like avocado!) -Pasta daVinci (My all time fav pasta with mushrooms and wine sauce ....soooo yummy) -Chicken Picatta (if you love the flavor of lemon and capers) I just tried their new Red Velvet Cheesecake the other night and it is definitely something you should experience. It had layers of red velvet cake and their rich cheesecake topped with a layer of cream cheese. Very moist and rich.  The only downfall is the wait. Sometimes it can be over an hour and the area is swarming with tourists. But, it's located on the Waikiki strip so we usually shop around while we're waiting. The best place to park is the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center...just don't forget to validate it at the restaurant.  Overall a great experience and a fun way to spend the night on the town."
Michael K.,"West Chester, PA",8,412,134,2.0,7/20/2011,When you have been to one Cheesecake Factory you have been to them all.  I didn't like the one hour and thirty minute wait.  The food wasn't that good.
Liz T.,"San Francisco, CA",1349,527,368,4.0,4/20/2008,"Avoid it like the plague on Friday/Saturday nights unless you eat dinner at 4PM--the long wait can reach ridiculousness (i.e. 2 hours). I come for lunch because my fuse is too short for the line and the lunch specials are perfect in portion and price. The Avocado Eggrolls and the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls (make sure to tell the server you don't like your fish overcooked) are just deelish. It's bizarre for me to rave about Asian-inspired food at chain restaurants, but these are rare cases. And I don't care if this place is a chain, I can't afford to eat at Alan Wong's all the time. The dish I order on every visit is the Pasta Da Vinci (sauteed chicken, shittake mushrooms, caramelized onions, Madeira wine, penne pasta). It's FAMAZING! I try to bypass the cheesecake. Like Prince William they're rich and delicious, but they're around 1,000 calories per SLICE! I don't know about you, but I rather have 4 Subway sandwiches. Who needs dessert when the waiters are so sweet-looking anyway? I swear, Abercrombie models moonlight as Cheesecake Factory servers or something."
