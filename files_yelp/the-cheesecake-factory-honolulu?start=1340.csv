Monique C.,"Waikapu, HI",23,94,7,2.0,9/14/2010,"Woah...crowded!  Sad, i learned they don't make the cheesecake there.  It's frozen and shipped in...whatever I don't need it anyways.. :)  Their menu is like a book, so many things to order.  I don't know, I think this place def does not live up to the hype or name."
Allen S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,4.0,1/19/2014,"After watching the big bang theory I did not know what to expect.  WOW great big portion and really good. I had pulled pork sandwich, it was huge.  I could not eat everything.  (honestly the pulled pork is better at a resturant called Ilikai bar and Grill check my review for there) but generally was really good.  Yes the cheesecake was $7.50  but it was a big piece and excellent.  The price of the meal,  beer and cheesecake still so reasonable.   loved it."
Angry K.,"San Jose, CA",122,66,,2.0,3/4/2009,"Tips for you - ONLY go to Cheesecake Factory to have the cheesecake, and get take out if you can. That would be the only reason that you could like the place. Why do so many people wait to get into this place, when the average wait is 45-60 minutes? I don't understand it. I know it's a Hawaii thing to hype up places that we didn't have here before but the mainland does, but come on! The food sucks. Sorry to say that. I've had multiple meals there - chicken chops or something? That are supposed to be like pork chops? Dry. Disgusting.  Salads? Overpriced for what you get. Other food I have gotten there is forgettable. And completely overpriced for the quality of food. You can get better food at the food court at Ala Moana, and spend only about 1/3. Service? Meh. Seriously, sometimes the waiters don't even come back to check on you and see ""how things are"". I think that's a pretty standard thing, don't you? I don't care if you're busy, come back and check on me if you want a decent tip! Cheesecake of course is great, but that is the only redeeming quality."
Mari V.,"Honolulu, HI",57,29,4,4.0,2/9/2011,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! the cheesecake (red velvet, reeses pb) and everything else.  i have eaten here numerous of times and theres just one thing that bothers me...... tooooo crowded! maybe if there was a second restaurant else where, it would help with all the crowd."
Kristen C.,"Waipahu, HI",77,630,197,5.0,3/30/2010,"Came here for the second time to actually dine in, as the only other times i've came were solely to get cheesecake at the counter.  The first time i came was a LONG while back and I got the Cuban sandwich and that was pretty good.  This time I came with a friend and we got there at 11a and the place wasnt crowded and we even got to sit outside.  Going in I already knew what I wanted and so I got the chicken madiera.  Thats supposed to be really popular so i wanted to give it a try.  I decided to share with my friend because we knew the portions would be big.  We also decided to get an appetizers so i suggested the fried mac and cheese since I always wanted to try that ever since I saw Paula Deen making it on the foodnetwork. =P.   After placing our order, our waters and house bread came a little after.  It came with half a loaf of each, sour dough and rye, sort of like the ones from outback.  Anyway, the bread was good as usual and it also came out warm and crispy and soft in the inside.  When our app finally came, I was excited to dig in because it looked really good.  The coating was really crisp and appeared to be panko.  The inside was really gooey and cheesy, mostly cheese and little noodles but it was gooood.  when our entree came It came with 3 huge scoops of mashed potatoes and 3 pieces of chicken topped with mozzarella cheese with 4 asparagus spears and mushrooms all over all sitting on the madiera sauce.  After my first bit it was mmm good.  The sauce was delicious and the potatoes were even better.  It had a good creamy taste with chunks of potatoes and potato skins, it also had black pepper already mixed it.  These potatoes were just so good that I could have eaten it on its own =P.  Finally, for dessert, even though I was so full, I just had to get some cheesecake.  I chose the carrot cake cheesecake because I also in the mood for some cake and thought it would balance out with the richness of the cheesecake.  Boy was I glad we got that because it was really good.  The cake had pieces of walnuts, pineapple, and raisins, ad came topped with a cream cheese frosting that was really good but a bit sweet.  Overall, the price to portion ratio is just right and quite worth it.  you also get free validated parking so you cant beat that either.  The service was pretty good too so cant wait to go back!"
James L.,"Cupertino, CA",4,52,6,4.0,1/25/2009,"The food is great at affordable restaurant prices. Waiting for the food takes a bit of time, but not too long. Considering how popular and huge this place is, it's amazing how they are able to keep everything coordinated. The only downside is the wait to get into the restaurant. Depending on the time and the day, you could be waiting at least a hour."
Christina P.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,2,,4.0,9/24/2013,Service was awesome.. Chris did a great job and knew about all of the drinks that we asked about. The barback was great too. Very friendly. Will definitely go back... Only downfall is no happy hour!
Gunjan K.,"Irvine, CA",0,25,3,5.0,9/21/2011,"We were there for 4 days and dined in for three times!  Price/Quantity/Quality : Been to other places in the area but this one was good, when you compare to price and the quality & quantity which is offered. Delicious food, whichever we ordered. Ambiance : The best seats are the one facing the street. No food is good until you eat in the ambiance you prefer. Full of people and lot of things going on, look around and easily accessible place. PS: If you looking for a place to relax and don't want to miss the streets of Honolulu, dine at evenings there. Service : All the three attendants were good, courteous and quick in their service. No complaints whatsoever. We recommend, a must-go place once for the prices in the restaurants in that area are on fire and this one suits your pockets, I can say that."
Roxanne H.,"Sydney, Australia",3,44,73,4.0,1/13/2013,"Well Folks over the many years that we have holidayed in Honolulu we have always managed to have at least one meal at this restaurant while we have been there. Yes it is predictable and yes it is very American but that is the thing that makes it a good place when you cannot be bothered going anywhere else, put your name down they give you the buzzer to tell you when your table is ready and you wander off . This was lunch on our first day in Waikiki, sleep deprived from the  long flight from Sydney and waiting for our room to be ready, what better way to fill in the time than to have a bite. But I write this to tell you that yes the food which as I said is predictable but it was the really great service that stood out that day. Natalie our waitress was what you wish every waitress to be,  so much so that my husband asked for the manager to tell him so, OK and yes the food was great especially after a night of airline economy class food.yes the servings are huge,  we always share.. but can I add that we visited three times this trip  and finally tried yes wait for it... cheesecake... the first time... so my all time favorite has to be   lime.... delicious and peanut butter cheesecake  again we all shared (three of us) very rich and no way I could have eaten any one of these by myself. Always reliable..when you are hungry.."
Roniza T.,"Honolulu, HI",32,16,4,4.0,8/24/2010,"I'd give them a 5 if the wait wasn't sooo long! You can expect a 1-2 hour wait, but at least there are shops nearby while you wait. The cheesecake is to die for, but if you're going in for just that--you might as well just do take-out...waayyy faster. They validate parking, but you still have to pay about $3. My favorite is red velvet cheesecake. Super rich, so I never finished it in one sitting, but it's super delicious! I also like their chicken costaletta--it's what I ALWAYS order from there, and I've never been disappointed. :-)"
Rae W.,"San Francisco, CA",21,61,10,2.0,2/4/2010,"I went here a few years back while at pro bowl and man I could have saved my money and time on this BS, I order stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and fresh fish tacos as my main course...  I enjoyed the appetizer way more then my meal but you cant get full off stuff mushrooms no matter how many different ways you slice them, I swear the tacos tasted GROSS like the fish was literally just caught and brought out on my plate minus  the seasoning..  if your looking to really enjoy your Cheesecake factory meal head down to Houston, TX now that's where you'll find good food!"
Shawn M.,"Coquitlam, Canada",0,3,,4.0,8/20/2013,"A typical Cheesecake Factory. Extensive menu, great deserts. Had the Jambalaya, Shrimp Scampi, Pepperoni Pizza and Kids Sliders. Food was good, service was better than most places we have been to in Waikiki. Come early, they do not take reservations and by 6 pm the line was 80 people deep. Lucky for us we came at 5 pm and we got in right away."
sky i.,"Honolulu, HI",84,226,20,4.0,6/26/2008,"If you're a local and you want to avoid LONG lines at this Cheesecake Factory, go after 9pm during the weekdays. Otherwise, there could be a wait as long as two hours on the weekends. I've eaten here about a dozen times(because my buddy is a bartender here) and everything I've ever ordered has tasted good or great. Portions are usually too generous and almost always end up taking stuff home.   And don't get me started on their selection of cheesecakes. If you want to pack on pounds like a sumo wrestler, this is how you do it: Eat one of their assorted, delicious cheesecakes once a day. Haha. Just as important is the live Hawaiian music which lasts til about 11pm. It really helps set the touristy vibe while you're eating."
Kristine C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",13,88,10,4.0,2/22/2010,"My favorite cheesecake factory, ever!!! Only drawback is that it's everyone else's too in Waikiki so the wait is like a 45 minute minimum. Although pagers work for distances and you can shop or walk around until your table is ready. Have had the white chocolate macademia nut cheesecake for the first time here and it was been mine and my husband's favorite cheesecake since then. Macademia nut cheesecake just tastes so much better in HI. Mahalo!"
Yousha D.,"Chandler, AZ",7,101,9,5.0,4/9/2011,"Huge portions and the food was great!  We had an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a soda and it was fiddy dollas.  Pretty cheap round these parts! There was food left to take back to the room for late night muchies.   Dont go if having pidgeons wandering around isnt your style. Part of the restaurant is open air so the flying rats wander in frequently. Possibly sitting in the rear of the restaurant would be a better seating choice if pidgeons arent your thing."
Scott H.,"Honolulu, HI",103,79,,3.0,3/30/2011,"This location happens to be the busiest one in the nation for this chain resturant.  And if you go during primetime, prepare for a long wait to be seated.  During busy hours this place is too chaotic and busy to enjoy the fine food.  The menu is vast and has a large selection, everything from thai food to italian to meatloaf.  And all of it done fairly well, albeit a bit heavy.....hence this resturant's success.  Im not a cheesecake fan, and it is very rich here.  Mainlanders flock to this place like birds to a birdfeeder though."
Michelle J.,"Bumpus Mills, TN",18,101,323,3.0,1/12/2013,"Last night was our second time eating at Cheesecake Factory, this time the wait was much longer (1hr 10mins) after finally being seated our server took our order rather quickly which was nice. I ordered the club sandwich which you would think would be super easy to make not really any cooking involved but it came 5 mins after my husband and son's food did. So when they finally brought it out the server had written down my order wrong and it had to be taken back to be remade which by the time they finally got it right my family was already done eating so I decided that I did not want the sandwich ( I am kinda stubborn) they did try to make it right and somehow managed to bring out a total of 3 club sandwiches before we left with one being the way I wanted it. To make it right the manager came over talked to me said he would take care of it (which he did) we then proceeded to order cheesecake (my husband and I shared my son got his own) the server came back over and informed us mine was free we thanked her got a to go box and left. I am glad they did try to at least make it right and I do so love their cheesecake but please pay better attention to your customers and what they order it makes for a happy customer and a better tip."
Andrew D.,Australia,0,11,,4.0,10/17/2013,Enormous serves (too big) at very fair prices. Menu is huge and varied. Margarita pizza is really good and Shrimp Scampi with angel hair pasta is extremely tasty if perhaps a touch too much garlic. Absolutely would go back.
Richard W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,5.0,10/15/2013,"Perfect example of great customer service. Food was great and when our order was delayed due to a computer issue the manager came by our table and made things right by ensuring we got great food, great service, and even gave us a discount due to the delay. Everyone can't be perfect everytime but service like this will keep me coming back, plus you gotta love the cheesecake!"
Leon H.,"Honolulu, HI",272,168,148,4.0,3/19/2011,They have the best Fried Mac and Cheese. So good. But the wait was so crazy down in Waikiki. But if you wait at the bar you might get lucky like us last night....
