Le Roi L.,"Vancouver, Canada",28,167,91,4.0,2/6/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a must stop for me whenever I'm in Waikiki! I usually go early to avoid the insane amount of people that go here at dinner time. My favorite items include the Buffalo Blasts, Thai Chicken Pasta, Thai Lettuce Wrap, Classic Burger(with a side of Blue Cheese Dressing for the fries), the Navajo, and the Fish Burger(only available in Hawaii). My favorite cheesecakes are the Fresh Banana Cream, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Vanilla Bean, Pumpkin(seasonal), and the Pineapple Upside Down Cake(only available in Hawaii). My favorite drinks are the Strawberry Creamsicle and Gin Rickey, although they could be more boozy! Service is usually very attentive and friendly. The patio is great for people watching, so it's worth the wait if your not starving yet!"
Amelia R.,"Honolulu, HI",1,6,,4.0,9/21/2011,Pros: The food is consistently delicious.  The service is about as good as it gets in Waikiki.  Its clean.  Go at lunch and you get right in.  Thier alcoholic beverages are very tasty. Cons: The waiting is atrocious at dinner time.  We have waited 45 mins to just get on the waiting list before.  Well worth the wait in my opinion if you want to eat good food.  Can be noisy but its a large restaurant and serves a lot of people.
Margaret W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",35,270,1,4.0,11/7/2010,"The stopped by here on a whim on a late Saturday afternoon, around 4:30, and was seated immediately. The waitress was wonderful and prompt. Our order was taken promptly and our food and drinks arrived promptly. Bonus: I was carded for my mojito. I'm 27 so I appreciate not being made to feel older by being carded. Our appitizer was so good, I could barely eat my entree, which they wrapped to go. The cheescake was the one element I was not overly impressed witj. It was good but at 7.50 a slice, I expected a bit more.  I would also appreciate it if they accepted reservations becasue I would never wait an 1hr for a chain dinner, no mater how good."
Shawn N.,"Honolulu, HI",120,18,,4.0,2/1/2011,"I love this place!  We normally don't go for dinner because the wait is ridiculously long but we actually got a table in under 10 minutes.  For once, I tried something other than my usual entrees and ordered the Chicken Madeira.  Very good but of course it was enough to feed three.  Couldn't eat my Kahlua cheesecake (no room) so brought it home.  I'm still eating it...three days later."
James W.,"Converse, TX",106,37,44,4.0,4/5/2010,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. You'll find something you like in their book...I mean, menu."
Misha A.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,,4.0,3/12/2011,"Red velvet cheesecake.....yum!!   I'm not one for chain restaurants but this was one of my better experiences.  Live music (what a hottie!) great service, decent food and we topped off the night with red velvet cheesecake with cream cheese frosting.   Really rich but definitely worth the extra calories!"
Frederik T.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",2,3,,5.0,3/11/2013,"Tastes awesome, plenty of food, and pretty decent princing!"
Denise N.,"Sun City, CA",0,196,1,3.0,7/13/2010,"We waited an hour on Saturday night and we arrived after 8pm!  My husband absolutely loves their ahi poke.  It sits above fried wonton wrappers...but he says it's the marination that makes it perfect. Our waitress mentioned that they are the highest volume cheesecake factory...vegas is the 2nd.  Oahu brought in 24 million last year, Vegas brought in 4 million...and they are open 24 hours!  Why not open another location at Ala Moana or something.....that's just ridiculous to be that busy and not have a second location available! Love the place...but sooo over the wait times!"
Kristan F.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,,4.0,8/2/2013,"white chocolate raspberry truffle cheese cake is the best. Food is pretty good. Service always seems a little inconsistent. The fried mac-and-cheese is delicious, but I can feel it stick to my sides right when it hits my mouth!"
L K.,"Kaneohe, HI",3,67,10,4.0,12/21/2008,"If you love cheesecake, you need to sample the variety offered here.  The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is divine, but you can only take a few bites before feeling like you're over-indulging.  The Strawberry Cheesecake is also a favorite of mine, just regular cheesecake topped with strawberries, very simple and very good.   My girlfriends and I also love their Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip and their Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls. One of the downfalls, however, is the waiting.  They don't take reservations, so they are usually busy in the evening.  Try to get there early (like 5PM) if you want to have dinner without waiting an hour or more on weekends."
Danielle Y.,"Highland Park, NJ",40,198,,3.0,8/17/2008,"It's hard to hate the Cheesecake factory. If you don't like what they have on menu page 3, there's always page 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... and most of it has been engineered (I SWEAR) to appeal to the average American palate.   The service tends to run like a machine, and while I've never been there when it was as insane as it can get, my experiences have been pleasant. Go for a late lunch/early dinner on a weekday (avoid lines!), order their ""lunch sized portion"" of a pizza and the ""simple green salad"" for about $11.  Get a pizza bigger than your head, and a salad that is far from simple, but certainly green (but not just green!  there are shredded cucumbers!  and carrots!  and big wedge of tomato!  and...) and eat half, take the rest home for dinner, be happy. In sum: I can't imagine me making a special trip to Waikiki to eat here, but if I was there and people were interested (and picky!) I would certainly suggest the Cheesecake Factory."
Anjyl J.,"Honolulu, HI",44,13,5,2.0,11/5/2010,"The first two times coming here was alright.  A typical weekend night in Waikiki is very busy!  Expect to wait at least half an hour for a table if you're lucky.  Calling a few times before we actually walked in the wait time was over an hour.  YIKES!  The food is about a 3, nothing really spectacular to note.  But the last time I came here was a Sunday afternoon and my bf and I waited 1-1/2 HRS.... FOR OUR FOOD!!!  Yes that's right, an hour and a half from the time we ordered the food to the time the food was brought to our table.  The waitress gave no explanation nor apology for the wait time as well!  Needless to say, we probably won't be returning to this restaurant...at least not to dine in.  Because I must add though that the red velvet cheesecake is really good! ...so I'll do with some dessert take out!"
Justin W.,"Honolulu, HI",45,129,17,5.0,2/15/2010,"Here we go with a chain restaurant.  Well let me start off with letting you know that they are very consistent with their dishes.  I have been here multiple times and I usually get the Louisiana chicken pasta, with extra sauce.  This is by far one of my favorite meals of all places to go and eat.  The prices are mediocre and the portion size is big enough that I usually have leftovers unless I am very hungry. Every time we have been here we have had exceptional customer service and the food has been great.  We usually bring guests here just because the experience has been so great.  Now there is one thing with this place and that is it get CROWDED.  I am talking the longest lines i have ever seen for a restaurant.  I mean I know it is in the heart of Waikiki but dang.  I just find it amazing for a chain restaurant to be so consistent with food.   All I can say is if you are in Waikiki take some time and eat here, it is worth it."
Amber W.,"Bend, OR",90,271,2,3.0,8/5/2008,"Their food is decent in the sense that with a menu that huge, SOMETHING is going to taste okay (I always get Evelyn's pasta) and you'll have enough for 3-4 meals. Their cheesecake is good, especially the white chocolate raspberry. My favorite item, by far, is their strawberry martinis. Belly up to the bar, have a strawberry martini, and go on your merry way!"
Patricia F.,"San Francisco, CA",6,50,6,4.0,8/20/2008,"I initially resisted the lure of the Cheesecake Factory, but here's what made it a surprisingly 4-star experience: - Actual Hawaiian options, in addition to the usual 14+ pages of middle-America comfort food.  They offered several local, fresh fish options. And the rare wasabi-crusted Ahi tuna was pretty good.   - Really strong drinks.  CF's ""tropical martini"" may not have the fresh fruit juice of a posh House Without a Key cocktail, but it has at least 3x the alcohol. - Best restaurant for people-watching.  It can be tough to get a table on the patio, but if you go really early (helps to be jetlagged) AND specifically ask/wait for it, it's fun to sit outside and watch the foot traffic. There aren't  that many outdoor seating options in Waikiki. Oh yeah, and there's cheesecake.  Remember, after a day of snorkeling, you have some calories to replenish.  =)"
H N.,"Honolulu, HI",1,16,,1.0,7/4/2013,the wait is not worth it (1-3 hours ) expensive food is below average . they couldn't even cook my spaghetti i would never go here
Lisa J.,"Greenville, SC",44,76,11,4.0,5/13/2008,"Great for a late dinner (after 9 p.m.) and lunch if you're allergic to long lines and tons of people.   The Thai lettuce wraps are my current favorite.  It's listed as an appetizer, but because like almost anything else here, it's definitely a generous portion and should be more than enough to satisfy an average sized person's hunger.   I also love their strawberry martinis.  They're sooo overpriced ($10, ouch!) but I can't help but order one every time I go because I'm addicted to them.  I've been known to indulge in a martini before noon...that's how much I love them, mwahahahah!"
Lup Wah M.,"Kapolei, HI",32,31,16,5.0,3/28/2013,"I have been here a few times and thought this place was the place to bring my friend for her birthday ... especially since she LOOOVVVEEESSS cheesecake. As usual, the wait time for a table was about and hour (not too bad since last time it was two hours). While we waited I figure we go hang out at the bar. Got to the bar and the bartender motioned to us that there was an open bar table, first come first serve. So we ended up eating there and did not need to wait for the whole hour for a regular table. The food was delicious. The only down side to this place is that the portion sizes are HUGE! We ate the corn cake tamales, and firecracker salmon (a must try). For dinner, she had the meatloaf and I the carbonara pasta, ended our meal with two desserts. Of course we ended up doggy bagging our dinner and desserts because of the size of these dishes. All in all everything was delicious. In fact, I went back the next day and ordered three orders of corn cake tamales and a slice of raspberry mouse cheesecake. DELICIOUS!!!"
Alan H.,"Honolulu, HI",84,138,54,4.0,8/15/2010,"good food, okay prices, good portions. Nothing really special about this place compared to all the other cheesecake factories."
Shirley M.,"Millbrae, CA",2,119,3,2.0,8/13/2008,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factories and I think I should have just stuck to basics. My daughter wanted Loco Moco (yeah, I know..) but went we got it it was pretty bad.  The burger patty was huge and dry. The gravy was bitter because it was made with mushrooms. She only took 2 bites and went after my husbands french fries.  I also had the poke which was so bad that it tasted like they douse it with soy sauce.   Next time stick to the sandwiches and burgers!"
