David P.,"Milwaukee, WI",1,5,,5.0,6/12/2011,"The staff is knowledgable, helpful and polite.  The food is great, the drinks are a must have. I've eaten at a lot of different places, but as far as customer service and food being up to par, it is hard to find a place with both, but this cheesecake factory has it pegged. You can't ask for anything more from a restaurant. And if you need to wait, it's well worth it."
Brittany N.,"Bozeman, MT",206,374,61,4.0,4/27/2010,Their avocado rolls were to die for. It's a great spot right near the beach and we didn't have to wait for a table. Our server was cool and everyone enjoyed their food :]
Jim H.,"Honolulu, HI",8,101,71,4.0,10/29/2007,"I know Yelp needs a review on the Cheesecake Factory like it needs another review of Leonard's Bakery but I just have to write about the best burger I ever had (this month). I was jonesing for a burger so my friend and I by-past our usual dim sum binge at Beijing and opted for the Ranch House burger at Cheesecake. 8 oz burger made up of chopped steak (you could really taste the steak flavor) with the salty fries that makes me guzzle water throughout the afternoon. Cheddar cheese, mushrooms, bacon. God it was good.  You can tell how busy the Waikiki hotels are by how long you have to wait for a table here. Waikiki is really slow today because there were still outside seating even at 12:30. I usually go straight to the bar and sit at the high tables in the middle to avoid the wait.  Four stars because I have never been really moved by any of the previous meals I have had here. Stick with the burger."
LC C.,"Pearl City, HI",8,23,2,3.0,9/21/2009,"Althoguh I usually love, love the Cheesecake Factory, my recent trip there was a huge, huge dissappointment. The food is wonderful.  May I reccomend the chicken tostada salad, probably one of the best salads I've ever tasted.  The Chicken Farfalle is always good, and the avocado spring rolls are excellent.  The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is to die for, especially if you love Godiva chocolate like I do. Top it off with a caramel macciato royal, and you have a wonderful meal at a reasonable price. However, in the past trip I've made with my boyfriend, our server was horrible.  Her name began with an A, it was long & unfamiliar looking. The service itself was good, our food came out on time and our drinkes were topped off quickly.  Our server, however, was rude and impersonal.  As a former waitress myself, I know when a server is trying to push out a table.  I could handle being rushed.  But what I couldn't handle were her constant rude comments.  My boyfriend ordered a strawberry lemonade, and she rudly said, ""not too share, right?""  My boyfriend and I hardly get to see each other, so we were sitting close to each other, and every once in a while he'd kiss my cheek.  She rudly popped out no where & said ""you guys know this is a family resturant, right?,"" as if we were kids.  Then, she dropped off our tab.  I intially tipped her ten percent, and was thinking of giving her more, when she rudly grabbed the check fold when it was still out & open in front of us.  She looked in the check fold right in front of us, which is extremely rude, looked at her tip, and he face totally dropped.  ""You need your receipt?"" she snapped.  And we said no, and she stalked off, no thank you, no goodbye, nothing.  At that point I was extremely glad I only tipped her ten percent, because she was obviously a rude person behind that fake smile.  I really hope the managers review these forums.  I think the Cheesecake Factory is wonderful. but some of there servers need some serious attitude adjusments. I was a regular, and now I'm not sure if I'll be going back."
Brady O.,"Honolulu, HI",789,32,154,2.0,11/14/2009,"Went to eat with my friend at the cheesecake factory and he made a phone order. i figure i go and try some of the famous cheesecake, go to the check out where to get pickups and got my cheesecake, it was $8.00!! for one piece of cheesecake. WTF. it was good but the service was bad. the girl behind the counter kept on disappearing to get stuff in the back and when she finally helped my friend she made him wait a while. when she rang up the order she forgot the drink, so she had to run back to the bar, he wanted to cancel the drink, but needed a manager to take it off, either way we were waiting again. the food was ok, but heads up, go early or plan to wait around, the girl at the check out wasn't on her A game that day, maybe a bad day.... dunno know but in general, we waited a lot longer than we expected, for a simple phone order,  at least the food was good."
jack d.,"San Francisco, CA",5000,339,,5.0,5/22/2011,"Drove to Waikiki right after landing into Honolulu Int'l Airport checked into the Sheraton Princess Kauilani, walked a blocked and ate lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. On a Friday afternoon, little wait, 3 minutes, and we found a nice guy who changed our seating arrangement. The coulette steak that I had with fries was very good, wife had the lunch special miso salmon which she devoured. Had a local nice Longboard beer, real cold and tasty.   Service excellent. I think Cheesecake Factory servers should take lesson from their Hawaiian counterparts about providing excellent service and attention to their customers."
Vanessa H.,"Orinda, CA",153,823,2,4.0,5/23/2008,"Though I'm anti-chain, I must admit, it's a treat sometimes to go to certain chain restaurants -- every couple years.  Cheesecake is utterly reliable and I think I've been ordering the same salad for the last decade -- chicken with lime vinagrette.  We were seated immediately at noon -- with no reservation -- which is an advantage when you have 7 adults, 1 kid."
Kalele W.,"Pearl City, HI",0,2,,2.0,5/18/2013,"Being that this is in Hawaii, I thought there would be some Aloha Spirit, but NADA. Not very many smiles to go around, a rare hello from the staff. The waitress was not aware of what was on the menu, I had to point it out to her, and she says "" I never knew that was listed, now why would they have that!"" My son ordered pasta cabonera, very salty, and when we spoke to the very young manager he goes on to explain the process of how its cooked, salt in pasta water, etc.This is a salty dish.  Son asked why they didn't taste it before they sent it out? And why would they have a salty dish on their menu? Not much of an apology, only excuses. He needs to go back to managerial school 101, customer is always right. Clam chowder was not very good, however the pizza and chicked salad was very ono!"
Ian T.,"San Francisco, CA",90,46,47,3.0,3/9/2008,"There's a C-Fact*  like 5 miles from home in Irvine, but it was nonetheless a welcome sight while we were strolling along Kalakaua ave. for a place to rid our hunger after an afternoon at the Waikiki beach.  Took us 2 tries to get a table - first time was around 7pm, and the size of the crowd waiting outside made it seem like George Clooney was signing autographs inside.  Second time we strategically arrived at 6pm, and got seated within 10 minutes, thereby proving that the saying ""third time's a charm"" is logically absurd. Even though we got our table relatively quickly, the restaurant was jam-packed, and every waiter/waitress looked like they had their hands full (literally and non-literally).  Took our waitress about 10 minutes to get us our water and bread (sourdough AND dark rye - I like), but we didn't mind.   On to the food.  I always have a thing for the Factory's huge salads; my craving was the main reason why we chose to eat there in the first place.  Anyway, I got the Luau salad, which was a mini-mountain of mixed greens, green onions, peppers, crushed macademia nuts, and two giant pieces of wonton skin.  A generous serving, even on fatass standards.  It was probably enough greens for 3 days, evidenced by my relatively painless and almost enjoyable toilet trips the following day.  Not that I usually take painful craps.  But you get the idea.   Oh yeah, the cheesecake.  Easily the best part of any C-Fact meals.  I was too full for it that night, but got a slice of white chocolate caramel macademia nut CC to go, which I ate while watching the sunset at the beach the next day.  Needless to say, it was delightful. Verdict:  high props for consistently good food and generous portions throughout the chain.  Too bad the wait is always too long at every location.  3.5 stars (4 stars if we weren't turned away the first time). Tip:  COME EARLY! *I just made that up to earn ""cool"" votes.  I try."
LA Sunshine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,103,,5.0,10/26/2009,"I like Cheesecake Factory but seldom go there because of the long wait.  Luckily I was hungry at 3pm and finally there was no line.  The food was just as good and served in just as large portions as those on the mainland.  Our waitress was pleasant and kept saying ""thank you"" after each sentence.  ""what would you like to drink?"" (my answer here), ""thank you.""  ""how was the food?"" (my answer here), ""thank you."" ""would you like any desert""...well you get the picture...thank you."
Diane O.,"Honolulu, HI",17,14,4,4.0,10/9/2010,This place was great!  I didn't go to this location before because I thought it was too loong of a wait.  This time (my first visit) was nice!  We walked in and got seated right away!  I ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese appetizer and that one was a winner!!  It tasted really really good!  The fried Mac & Cheese ball was as big a baseball
Anne B.,"Honolulu, HI",1,29,,4.0,2/6/2011,"How can you not like TCF? Their menu is like 20 pages long and has an option for everyone. And the cheesecake? Puhlease, if you don't like their cheesecake than you don't have taste buds."
Joshua A.,"Honolulu, HI",22,37,40,4.0,1/25/2010,"I ALWAYS get the Farfalle Pasta with roasted garlic! The Rangoon won tons are really good too! I tried the four seasons pizza and although I REALLY like the sun-dried tomato and artichokes, I didn't care for the dried up basil that was on some of the pizza. I must service has been excellent every single time I have been there and they do a fantastic job considering how busy the place seems every time I go. I always try to save room for either the Godiva or Snickers cheesecake- but am always too full! Definitely will be back :)"
spiff e.,"San Francisco, CA",55,462,146,3.0,6/22/2006,"There were plenty of tables open but it seemed like that were a tad understaffed (given, it was 3 or 4ish so it was in between lunch and dinner time), so I had to wait for a table.  And the table they gave me was not so great.  A tiny booth in the corner of the bar area. Took the server a while to come by and take my order (i was slowly fading from starvation at that point).  Ordered one of their frozen drinks, either the frozen iced mango or the peach smoothie, both are good so I don't really remember.  Also got the avocado eggrolls which are always great and filling.  Took a while for the food to come out, but once it did, I was stuffing my face quick. Cheesecake in general is never a letdown on portions.  Actually had enough leftover to make it an appetizer for my dinner later that night."
Kari S.,"San Diego, CA",78,385,43,2.0,5/22/2008,"We have a Cheesecake Factory in San Diego and we never really go there since the food isn't all that fabulous. We ended up going here on a Friday evening (early) since it was walking distance from our hotel. The place was pretty full but we only waited about 5 minutes to get a table. We sat on the patio which was nice because it was quieter. Our server was Kenneth and he started out good, but after we got our main course he was nowhere to be found. We got the Chicken Pot Stickers for an appetizer, and we both did not like them at all. They were very watery and the sauce was so bitter and overpowering. I had the Pear and Endive salad which tasted fine, but the pears were mushy and slimy (had to pick them all out). My DH had the Cashew Chicken which he maybe ate a quarter of. It was so heavy and had way too much sauce. We did get the White Chocolate Raspberry to take with us and ate it later...that was about the only good thing."
Sylvia D.,"Salem, OR",100,46,,5.0,8/15/2007,"Chain Restaurant - Shmain Restaurant.  I love this place...and because of it's consistency.  I've been to the one in Honolulu multiple times as well as the two in Vegas (one is under another name in the Venetian) and the one in San Francisco above Macy's and service has always been excellent.  The food is really what keeps me going back over and over and over again.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Madeira but the Steak Diane, Cobb Salad, Shepherd's Pie, Meatloaf, Salmon, etc.. are all excellent and the portions are humongous.  I looooove the free bread too. True, you will have to wait awhile so be prepared but this place always makes your wait well worth it.  If you don't want to wait, go to the dessert counter and make a takeout order and take it home, eat it on the beach, use one of the tables in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  Whatever you do, don't miss out on this place."
T L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,27,,3.0,11/18/2012,"Went  for lunch on 11/16/12. Got seated quickly. The hostess and server were very attentive. The cobb salad, salmon, gumbo and oreo cheesecake was fantastic. What sucked was the person that actually brought the food to the table kind of  just threw it on the table. We were sharing a salad so we asked for extra plates and he just looked with a blank stare and walked away never to be seen with plates. Lucky our server was back at our table to resolve. A few minutes later he returned to bring food to the table next to ours and had his ASS hanging on our table when he was throwing their plates down. Why come to work if you're just going to be an asshole.... just stay home and stop collecting undeserved tips from the ones that actually are doing great work."
Crista Y.,"New York, NY",61,167,9,3.0,12/1/2009,cheesecake factory can give you familiarity and there are abundant choices.   my friend and I were too tired after our flight to fathom venturing too far from our hotel to access dinner.  we decided to splurge and grab CF.  A good familiar default.  The bill was only $40 for two of us...sans alcohol.  Not bad.  I love how low the tax is.   I had the artichoke dip as an entree and cake for dessert.  nothing special.  i don't care too much for cheesecake..too rich but if i did i would get key lime.....that's what my friend had....and it was super good.
Anna W.,"Honolulu, HI",794,228,129,4.0,5/14/2010,"yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy DESSERT! i always grab a slice to go. It's the best thing ever; they're all great in your tummy... not necessarily for your figure but whatever.  I tried their passion fruit mojito the last time i went and i must say, I am not a fan of their mojitos. After that first one i got a normal mojito which wasn't great either... it makes me wonder how you could mess up a mojito. Well, i'm no bartender but i'm definitely a connoisseur of the mojitos and next time no more.  The food isn't bad either. I've had probably almost every dish since we all like to order somethign different and share a bite out of it. They were all pretty good. I wouldn't say the best bang for your buck but it's good enough."
diego m.,"Honolulu, HI",60,68,,5.0,6/26/2008,"I believe their burger is the best in the island in my personal opinion and yes, I have tasted Kua'aina Burgers but this is the real deal. It was grilled and there is a smokey flavor to it almost reminescent of a home made broiled burger. Their service is as good as the food -- so is the location except it might be a little hot outside in the open. They even give you french bread and their portions are big --- to satisfy the big eaters - this is the best burger in the island period and I have been San Diego and nothing compared to this place Big portions - Good Quality of food - Great service and yes, if you cannot eat the food, the waiter will be more than happy to prep it up for you to bring home - fast - reliable and good service. Will definitely go there again ..."
