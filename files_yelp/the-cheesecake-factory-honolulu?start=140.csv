Lika T.,"Honolulu, HI",260,248,919,5.0,9/10/2016,"So, this is one of my favorite cheesecake place!!! If you haven't gone here yet well here's your chance. It's really busy when it hits evening time. So you have to come here before the sun goes down! I usually come here during lunch time cuz that's when not much people go eat in. I come here because their pasta is delicious and there Oreo cheesecake is the bomb!!!  I always get some cheesecake before I leave cuz I know that I'm not coming back for a while and I love there cheesecake!! They have all kinds of cheesecake not just strawberry. They have regular cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, lime cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake, etc.  They have a lot on the menu so take your time and pick wisely because it's a lot of food to choose from:)  If your a cheesecake lover come here to eat!"
James J.,"Concord, CA",0,2,1,5.0,7/18/2017,Great experience  Server was quick and always checking on us We got our food really fast  Only problem was the line but that's given
Bekah R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",212,10,,5.0,10/1/2017,"My mom and I came in tonight at around 10 and shared the macadamia nut fish dish. It was amazing! We also got a side of mac and cheese. Great vibes, and our server, Tyler was amazing, really hospitable and seemed truly genuine and friendly! Good job Cheesecake Waikiki!"
Ramsey B.,"Palos Hills, IL",399,538,21,5.0,3/26/2017,"Excellent dining experience...just like on the main land.  Enjoyed the service and food.  Although this place always seems busy, they tend to seat you rather quickly.  We ordered entrees and sandwiches, along with some appetizers.  Everything was well prepared and served on time.  We were in and out within an hour and 30 minutes.  We look forward to dining here again.  Who wouldn't?  It's on Waikiki beach!!"
Sierra H.,"Aiea, HI",390,30,42,4.0,3/15/2017,"I always come here for birthday celebrations or to just celebrate anything in general.  So tonight was my brother's birthday & we came here for dinner. Wait time wasn't too bad; 40 minute wait. Usually it's way longer than that considering Cheesecake Factory is ALWAYS busy. After we got seated, since we've been here so many times, we already knew what we wanted. For appetizers we ordered the Calamari, artichoke dip, firecracker salmon rolls, & Thai chicken wraps. Everything was excellent, my favorite were the Thai chicken wraps even though they can eat a bit messy, they're super flavorful. I also liked the fire deck salmon rolls; super flavorful & crunchy. I even liked the cabbage with the sauce it was served in, kinda like a little salad which was nice. My entree was the endive salad, I didn't really eat much of it because i was able to eat a lot of the appetizers. The food came out super fast, our server was awesome, friendly & made sure that we were taken care of. She gladly packed up all our food & our cheesecake so that we could eat it at home because the kids were getting tired. We will definitely be back :)"
Stacey M.,"San Francisco, CA",121,193,638,4.0,11/17/2016,"I love this location compared to any other Cheesecake Factory location i have been to in SF or East Bay. I would say i like this location better due to the tropical side, quality and quantity with their food. The garnishments are so cute as well, with cute orchid flowers. I always love asking for outside seating. Waiting time is crazy long at night, during lunch hour, expect 35 mins latest to wait."

Laurie G.,"Honolulu, HI",37,95,282,5.0,5/23/2017,"Loved the tortilla soup ! Nice fresh salad with chicken cranberry sandwich. Don't know how but managed to resist their scrumptious Cheesecake. Gotta run b4 I change mind ! Had René special. It's sandwich, soup and salad for $13.95. My server Scares was sweet and gave me recommendations on their menu."
Erica C.,"Hesperia, CA",29,8,9,5.0,10/11/2017,"Everytime I eat here I can expect great service, the food, drinks and desserts are delicious. I love this place."
Jessica N.,"Hayward, CA",0,22,11,5.0,7/9/2017,"I visited the Cheesecake Factory on a Thursday night around 8. The wait time was about 35 minutes. The host that walked to our table was very friendly. He was super sociable! Then our waiter took our order. I tried the fried Mac & Cheese, 4 Cheese Pasta, and a side of Mashed Potatoes. Also I order a Red Sangria! The Red Sangria was delicious!! It's a chilled wine with fresh fruit. I highly recommend! The food was pretty good. I would say it was worth wait time. I also tried the Chocolate Cheesecake. It was very rich and delicious.  The restaurant inside was huge ! The atmosphere was very loud and  the lights were dimly lit. Almost a little difficult to hear across the table.  Overall good experience and I would come back again."
Sushane P.,"Honolulu, HI",116,75,403,5.0,8/23/2016,"Great food. My family enjoys going here. Aside from the long wait, the staff are always friendly, and accommodating. the food is always delicious. The cheesecakes are to die for. The price for each slice is pricey, especially when you buy 2 or 3 slices like me. lol But this is a great family restaurant. just be prepared to wait in line for 20 plus mins, 30 plus after 530pm. longer on weekends."
Tasha M.,"Honolulu, HI",81,133,90,3.0,2/24/2016,"Went here today to pickup dessert from their cheesecake line.  Tried to get my parking validated but the hostess girls paid no attention to me. After awkwardly waiting for a bit one of the male hostesses came by, noticed me and helped me out. (Thanks dude that helped me!) But seriously though how rude of the female hostesses to just ignore me! I get that you're busy but I'm still a paying customer. Don't keep your head down and ignore me. Idk, maybe they ignored me because they thought I was cutting in line to get seated. But I wasn't. I just needed a parking validation, which they would know if they took the time to look up and pay attention to me.  To top it off, I found a single nut on my cheesecake. It's not a big deal but I've been here many times and none of the other times was there a random nut on my cheesecake. Oh well, I'll let that slide.  I just wish that their customer service in general was better. Yeah, you guys are always crowded and busy, but your customers deserve respect and acknowledgement."

Nani G.,"Honolulu, HI",14,127,85,2.0,3/28/2016,"Where have the good old days gone?  This is my second visit in less than a week.  It is still a crazy place to get seated.  My wait was only 55 minutes or so today which isn't bad compared to other days. My waiter was Mark from the Big Island and he was upbeat and courteous with all his interactions.  I was having issues with my voice and he didn't hesitate to lean in to hear what I was trying to say.  My interaction with him was probably the best part of my experience at The Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was okay.  Some of the artichoke hearts completely missed the blade in the blender.  It didn't have much flavor, but the salty tortilla chips helped it out.  My favorite dish here is Chicken Madiera so it is my ""go to meal.""  Last week the chicken breasts were smaller and the sauce was salty, but the potatoes helped absorb that and the meal balanced out.  Today though there was barely any wine sauce and I think I had at least half a pound of mushrooms on top of my chicken breasts.  The chicken breast was tender as usual and the asparagus was its usual as well.  I only had three bites and debated on whether to get something else, but didn't. Tonight the meal fell flat so I decided to just go for dessert and take the meal home. My excitement quickly subsided as I looked over the menu.  I was even more disappointed in the cheesecake selection.  They seem to have removed a large selection and the ones available were not up to my standards.  There was only one cheesecake with coconut and it had more chocolate than coconut.  I looked tirelessly for the pineapple upside down cheesecake and lo and behold it is gone too.   Overall if it was not for the service Mark gave me, I'd be giving them one star.  This is not the quality of what I am used to from The Cheesecake Factory and I doubt I will be coming back here any time soon ."
Monica F.,"Toronto, Canada",34,149,810,5.0,2/5/2016,"There's a reason why this place is so popular... Cheesecake Factory is the bomb! I wish we had them in Canada. We were here 4 times during our 10 day trip in Honolulu. And came by once just for cheesecake, lol.  Their menu is so huge, it takes a while to decide what you're going to get. Would be a great place for picky eaters since they're bound to find something here they'd enjoy. And the prices are very fair, considering the area.  I had the Cajun chicken ""littles"" twice, they were that good. I think they put quotations beside the word ""little"" on the menu because it's anything but. You get like, 10 pieces of chicken, it's ridiculous. They are basically chicken fingers served with mashed potatoes and corn succotash. I appreciate how they serve the chicken with vegetables as opposed to French fries cause the chicken is already fried (although I'm sure I could have substituted for fries if I wanted to).  I also had the best burger I've ever had in my LIFE here for our last meal in Honolulu-- the Americana Burger. I think it's their version of a Big Mac cause it's got that thousand islands ""secret sauce"" on it. I don't know if I'll ever be able to have a McDonald's Big Mac again.... Holy cow.    I also got the chicken parm sandwich, which was good, but the least favourite thing I ordered there. I didn't like the roasted peppers that came with it.  My dad got the Cuban sandwich, which was the least favourite thing he ordered (maybe sandwiches aren't their strongest suit?), the steak Diane, chicken Madeina, and the chicken parm with pasta. His favourite was the chicken Madeina. I had a taste of it and it was really good. They sure don't skimp on the cheese!  I tried the Oreo and turtles cheesecake too, and Oreo is definitely the way to go. It's one of the most popular cheesecakes. It was funny cause I was all like ""what a chincy size slice for $9"" but I couldn't even finish it. Soooo good.  Apparently this is the highest grossing Cheesecake Factory in the world. It was packed at all hours of the day we were there/passed by. The staff here know what they're doing though. It's very efficiently run. Other than waiting for a table, we didn't have to wait long for drinks/food/bill to get to the table."
Da'Juan H.,"Honolulu, HI",149,1,,4.0,7/10/2017,"1st: Our server Marc was beyond awesome. He offered great customer service and knew which dishes to recommend.  2nd: The food portions were enough that you would have a good amount for lunch the next day.  3rd: I had the Pineapple in paradise. This has many layers when it comes to taste, which was very good. It comes with 2 straws but it is not actually enough to share or potent enough. The whiskey smash will take care of you in that department."
Ash C.,"Honolulu, HI",379,262,3613,3.0,7/27/2016,"Everyone and their mama knows about Cheesecake Factory. It's probably one of the biggest food chains across the country. That's probably one of the main reasons why it's always so busy. If you come here for lunch, wait times are actually good. Usually if you get there before noon, you can get sat right away. But if you come here for dinner, you better eat like a side meal or bring a snack because wait times can go up to almost 2 hours! And sometimes they even run out of pagers, so they just give you a piece of paper and ask you to come back later for a pager. Cheesecake Factory has a very large and expansive menu, over 250 dishes! They have everything: lunch specials (served until 5pm), breakfast all day, burgers, regular entrees, alcohol and CHEESECAKE for dessert. I normally come here for lunch with my coworkers and we usually take advantage of their lunch specials. They have couple options on their menu that comes in lunch-size portions: salad, soup and salad, salad and pizza, pasta, chicken, salmon and other specialties for reasonable pricing. I normally get the salad and pizza (BBQ Chicken Pizza is my favorite) as I always end up taking home leftovers because the portions are large for me. My boyfriend usually appreciates when I have leftover pizza for him to eat lol. And of course you can't forget about their famous cheesecakes. I normally don't make it to dessert, but they have over 30 different flavors. And depending on the season, they may have special flavors to try.   On my most recent visit, we came here for dinner around 6pm for a party of 8. The wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes. OMG. But since this is where the birthday girl wanted to go, we decided to walk around Waikiki and just wait. We luckily got buzzed 15 minutes earlier, but because our big group split up during the wait, only 3 of us were able to make it back to the restaurant first. They wouldn't sit us until half our party was there. A bit ridiculous if you ask me as we were already waiting for so long. We told them they were in the area and on their way, but they still wouldn't sit us. So as we waited for the rest of our party to show up, we prayed they didn't give our table away.  After we finally got sat, the first thing everyone asked was ""are the lights on?"" It was so dark, we had to use the flashlight off our phones to see the menu better. On top of that, our waiter, Brian I think was his name, was the real MVP (sarcasm). When he finally took our orders, he would take down 2 orders, then disappear, and then show up again, and then disappear again. It was quite annoying as he did that with our water refills too. And when we asked if it was possible to split the check, he tried to make us feel bad by saying it'll take longer to split. And before he left to place our orders, he made another comment that he thought was funny by saying ""I had to stop my temptations to tell you I can't split the check."" I know I probably gave him the death stare after he said that because that was just rude! After we got our food, he was non-existent until we got our bill. The only highlight of that night was there was live entertainment that played oldies but goodies songs.  Other than that rude waiter, the food here is actually not too bad. I did like the Chicken Madeira. The chicken was tender, had lots of mushrooms and asparagus and the sauce was delicious. I liked the cheese, but it may have been too much cheese on the chicken. Their Miso Salmon is another favorite of mines. As for their cheesecakes, my favorite is probably their Pineapple Upside Down cheesecake. And I recently tried their Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake. It looks really rich, but it was actually light and fluffy. And it came with a huge oreo cookie on top! Customer service isn't the greatest here as on other occasions, service is usually slow, even during lunch time when it's not too busy. But I usually come back here because of the food."
Rain B.,"London, United Kingdom",5,369,93,4.0,6/16/2017,"Good fast food Usual Cheesecake experience, long wait for table, but when we sit down good service, friendly staff and good fast food. June 2016"
Nicolette V.,"Ryde, Australia",0,20,,5.0,12/12/2017,"Always a good meal at Cheesecake Factory. We ordered buffalo bites for appetizer and were expecting 4-5 little bites but instead got 8 massive bits. We only ate 4 and boxed the rest up. Mains we both got pasta and were both amazing, large serves. We planned to have cheesecake for dessert but meals were so big we could not fit it in. Have been back since to purchase take away cheesecake. Very big meals, next time for 2 people I would order 1-2 appetizers and a main to share."
Tess E.,"Honolulu, HI",8,2,3,4.0,9/25/2017,"This place was amazing!!! We came here for my friends birthday during their lunch hour and we didn't have to wait. The prices were very reasonable . Our meal cost a total of $103.78 and tip an extra $16. I ordered the chicken katsu and it just melted in my mouth. I love how the sauces go so well together, it had a hint of Sriracha on the side which gave it a kick of spicy. We got good customer service and complimentary bread. Overall I had a great experience here."
