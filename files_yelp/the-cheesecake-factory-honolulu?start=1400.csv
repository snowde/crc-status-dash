Anne M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,21,,5.0,1/3/2013,The five stars goes for customer service.  This is an exceptionally busy restaurant. Last night when we had a problem with our order the server and manager went to great lengths to make up for the inconvenience. Thank you.
Jaime P.,"Danville, CA",222,820,6,4.0,10/10/2007,"My friends and I are big people watchers, so we insisted on sitting near the sidewalk to catch a glimpse of all the people walking by. Other than the exotic location, nothing really stood out here from other CF I've been to, but since this spot was an inbetween spot between the 2 hotels we were staying at, we ended up dining here a couple of times.  We also went at non-peak times and completely avoided the long waits!"
Rob C.,"Palo Alto, CA",1616,4663,178,3.0,10/3/2007,"Menu in Japanese on the wall. Cheesecake factory became the chain restaurant industry standard.  They realized they can succeed through consistency and by serving ridiculously large portions of food that's not bad.  For them, doubling the portion size doesn't double the business costs but allows them to double their price, which people will easily pay since they feel they are getting their money's worth. Oh yeah, and one cheesecake slice = almost 700-900 calories of yumminess."
Mel W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,18,10,2.0,12/8/2009,This place is good if you wanna impress a girl on how much money you can spend. Food was not so good. Go for the cheesecake.
James Q.,"Kapolei, HI",98,11,,4.0,11/27/2010,"I was not expecting to see sushi on the menu, but was very impressed with it.  The place is huge! And always seems to be very crowded, but the service is ultra fast, good food, and prices are very reasonable for Waikiki, A+."
FAITH M.,"Hershey, PA",5,29,8,5.0,7/21/2008,Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki is always busy.  We been there several times. The food and the service was really good. Enjoy your meal w/ wonderful musics.  Nice!
Marie J.,"Honolulu, HI",0,28,3,4.0,2/9/2013,"Yummy yum yum, there only problem is being too busy. The price is right, please don't increase them. I love they give complimentary bread, if only all restaurants did this. And the bread is good too."
Ron J.,"Honolulu, HI",14,9,1,4.0,8/23/2010,"Good food... I really enjoyed the Cajun Steak, and of course, CHEESE CAKES! Though the wait is rather long at peak hours but worth while if just begining to get an appetite. Having friends there to keep you company is a PLUS! ... *a small snack to pass the time while u wait helps too!"
MK D.,"Burlingame, CA",59,1986,1591,4.0,11/9/2007,"I was so happy when I found out that there was a Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki, just about 4 blocks down from our hotel. We managed to go there on our last night in Oahu.  Had their house coffee and a slice of their Tres Leche Cheesecake, no whipped cream and extra strawberries hit the spot after having dinner at a ramen joint."
Anna E.,"Waipahu, HI",7,16,,5.0,5/11/2014,"Came here for Mother's Day and the wait was about 10 min. Which was very good.  I didn't know they opened @ 8am!  I guess it was only for today.  It was a good thing we came early as we could b/c they got really crowded after.  We started our meal with a BBQ Chicken Salad which was very delicious! Along with our beverages including my iced mocha which came in a tall glass and it was what I needed.  For my main course, I ordered the shrimp scampi it was breaded shrimps along with the other flavorful taste.  And of course can't leave the restaurant without dessert! They have a lot of selections. We ordered the CHOCOLATE MUSSE CHEESECAKE  and the VANILLA CARAMEL CHEESECAKE. Both were very delicious.  Overall, the service was great,  and parking is @ Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  Although, we parked at the Waikiki Plaza just a 5 min. Walk from and to the restaurant.  They don't validate @ the Waikiki plaza and we payed $5.00 for parking."
Mike N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,1.0,6/18/2014,Menu is big but I had a lot of problems with the service.  Yesterday we went to the Cheesecake Factory for an early lunch.  The waiter we got was more concerned with the tables that had 4 or more people.  He rarely came over to see if we needed anything and it took us a long time to even order.  Once we ordered it took 30 minutes to get our food and this was at 11:00 am before the lunch rush.  All the other tables got their food but not us.  When we got our food my wife's breakfast had potatoes that were dried out and hard. The parsley was wilted and dried out on the plate.  When I started eating my mashed potatoes that came with the meatloaf I noticed something hard in it.  When I spit it out I found a piece of hard plastic in it.  I called for the manager and Marshall didn't want to talk about how long it took for us to get our meals but he talked loudly so everyone around us could hear that he would handle the mater of the plastic in the food.  When we decided that we just wanted to leave we looked around for the waiter and he was no where to be found.  I did see him laughing away in the kitchen area but he would not return to the tables.  I finally decided to get our check from the manager and then there was a wait again for the waiter to get our payment so we could leave.  This restaurant has really gone downhill.
Ange M.,"Lahaina, HI",59,95,,4.0,4/5/2009,"So we went here with a group of 13 Adults and 5 Toddlers.  Totally unintentional on my part.  Wanted to dine here with the BF's Mom (who lives on Oahu) and thought we were only meeting her.  So, I knew there would be a wait, but did not figure it would be that long. They showed up with the WHOLE family.  Had I known that would happen, I would not have suggested this place as I really don't think it's smart to go here with large groups like that due to the wait time and the fact that you can't even sit together anyway. But they did a great job with us.  The sat us all in the same area even if it was on 3 separate tables and we had to wait 45 minutes as they had promised when we checked in.  Not bad considering.... The hostess and servers were fabulous.  I work in the Food and Beverage Industry so I can appreciate when they handle chaos with grace.  And our group was utter chaos with 5 toddlers. They brought complimentary plates of bread and sliced banana's for the kids, which was nice.  And it was great for the kids b/c they could make all the noise they wanted and nobody noticed since the place was so loud. It took a little while for our drinks to come, but once they did, all the rest of the orders came quickly and without much delay. Granted they may have made a plan to get us out of there as quickly as possible since we were a nightmare group in my opinion, but they handled everything with pure grace.  The Waiter was fabulous and remembered (or made note of) exactly who had what although we did not order all at the same time and was ordering appetizers with entrees and drinks then adding more on later as parts of our group left and came back from bathroom breaks, etc.  Like I said...utter chaos. Now for the food....YUMMY!!  This is not your average Franchise chain.  This is food you can find in most upscale restaurants but done quick and done well.  I had the Fried Macaroni and Cheese as an appetizer with my daughter.  It was delish....ask for extra marinara sauce.  It really adds something to the dish. Then I had the Chinese chicken salad which was HUGE and wonderful.  The BF had the Steak Diane with Mashed Potatoes.  He's a Chef and thought the dish was perfect.  I tried it and was pleasantly surprised as well.  Really good. The rest of the family had all sorts of stuff, but I didn't taste it so cannot review, but everyone said the food was fabulous.  Even the Ahi Poke, which I thought would not be good looked yummy. We had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  What can I say about that? Broke da Mouth goodness.....OMG!!! It was worth every calorie and so very very sinful. So, kudos to you, Cheescake Factory....for handling the crazy family that challenged your services last night.  You definitely rose to the occasion."
Hunter O.,"Honolulu, HI",478,3,,5.0,8/19/2010,"The Server Auntie Lynn is the best, she smells and snorts, but she's the best! Ask for her! and I hope she reads this... PS, all y'all Japanese and AUssies need to learn how to tip :)"
Albert H.,"Scottsdale, AZ",117,1222,281,4.0,5/9/2009,"After trying ""local"" places with the worst service we were ready for some good corporate trained employees who had a clue about service.  This Cheesecake Factory was close to the others, service was good, prices weren't terribly inflated due to being in Hawaii, and for once we left a good tip while on this visit."
Haiya S.,"Hawaii, HI",1,7,,5.0,7/8/2010,"Ok, so I know i say everything is my favorite. BUT, there are degrees and this little Cheesecake Factory is officially my FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD. I can go to the most expensive places, but in the end, this is what i love the most. the food is just so good. No matter what I order I want to just eat the plate too. And since the plates are huge, I always end up with a bit of a stomach ache because I'm too small to eat that much. But even with that stomach ache, I'm so happy cuz it's so DELICIOUSSSSIEJOIEWJOJ!!! :D) Their 4 cheese pasta is perfection. And all the sandwiches I've tried have just been so lovely. And their mango smoothie is so nice too. When I tried to take my family there they were like ""we dont wanna go to no factory. We want Chili's!"" Where I come from, it's practically a village- so it's always big deal where to eat when we have a family vacation to a civilization!  But since they had no idea what they were talkin' about, I was like, ""NOO!! WE HAVE TO!!"". And so all grumblin', they went in and oh boyy did they get hit with happiness! I forgot what my sisters got, but they were just happy as heck. The great thing about this place is that they have so many options that everyone will surely be fattened up and happy. And their cheesecakes are the best in the world. Nothing compares to a Cheesecake factory cheescake. If you're trying to lose weight though, don't go here because the calories (as I've discovered) are what make the food taste so good. But the day you plan to crack on that diet and get a lil crazy for dinner, indulge in something worth it- indulge here!!  in conclusion, thank u cheesecake factory for existing!xxxxxxxxx"
Daisy S.,"Mililani, HI",53,490,196,3.0,4/8/2009,"I have to review this place although it was a while back that I went. It was on a valentine's day.. and the place was PACKED!! up to the time it was closing. There was a line to even put your name down and there was a line to get the buzzer!! We had to wait for abut 2-3 hours, so since I lived in Waikiki area, we just went home and waited. The dinner was pretty okay, but the cheesecake was my highlight of the night! It made it all perfect!"
Kal B.,"Burnaby, Canada",88,172,,5.0,10/29/2009,great food.. huge portions.. american chain restaurant at its finest they have like 30 varieties of cheesecakes and cakes.. the best i ever had!  choc chip cookie dough is my fave!
William G.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,1,3.0,5/20/2010,The food is consistent and you know what you are getting. The garlic noodles were better than average. You just have to get use to paying $4-$8 more per dish than the mainland. Can be busy and a wait after 8pm. even on weeknights in Waikiki.
Allen C.,"Vancouver, Canada",45,174,25,4.0,9/12/2011,"One day I will go to the Cheesecake Factory and actually order a cheesecake during my sitting.  Honestly, if you really want to have that cheesecake, start with that first because the dinner will keep you stuffed until next week.  I knew the food was filling from prior experience, so before we went out, my group wenting hiking first to build up our hunger.  We decided to order two appies, the crab cakes and the infamous mac and cheese ball.  The crab cakes was nothing out of the ordinary, it was a little dry and there were only 3 crab cakes in total, but the mac and cheese ball had a total of 4 and they were large meatball sized.  It's almost a meal in itself.  But the melted parmesan cheese was to die for.  It was truly a mouthwatering experience.  Next came my chicken parmesan sandwich and it was prepared very well.  I always like a sandwich where it never falls apart due to having too many toppings.  The chicken mixed with the dressing, parmesan, tomatoes and lettuce are a perfect combination of flavour.  It's probably how they prepared it because I can't prepare a sandwich that tasty at home.  A healthy alternative would be ""Evelyn's favourite pasta"".  My wife order the penne tossed with broccoli, oven-dried tomato, roasted eggplant with peppers, artichoke, olives, garlic and pine nuts. That topped off with real grounded cheese, not the fake stuff.  A truly filling lunch day."
Jake C.,"Honolulu, HI",2,4,,3.0,5/4/2012,"The Red Velvet Cheescake is all the rave here and their poke appetizer is out of this world. They have a large selection of pastas, pizzas, salads, and desserts and the setting here, although romantic, is a bit dark. And despite the fact that we had to wait an hour or so before being seated and walk what seemed like half a mile from their validated parking gargage just to get there, it was still good. Maybe not worth the wait...or the walk...but good. My suggestions would be to have a friend drop you off if you're planning on eating any later than 7PM and make sure your phone is fully charged so you can play games or browse the internet because chances are you're gonna wait. Stongly recommend sitting at the bar where service is faster and conversation a whole lot better. The staff at the bar knows how to serve it up."
