n p.,"Waipahu, HI",10,102,21,3.0,10/22/2009,"I love cheesecake but had never been here so a friend and I decided to go. I ordered Evelyn's pasta which I thought sounded good since it had veggies. But I was disappointed, it was nothing special and if I went back I definitely wouldn't order it. The cheesecake was good, but a tad bit warm which left me wondering how great it would've been had it been a few degrees colder. Overall, it wasn't bad but not amazing either. Probably didn't help that it was a hot day and all that heavy food really didn't help."
Mike M.,"Hickam AFB, HI",0,4,,4.0,7/26/2012,"Lots of choices for food, all of which is good. The cheesecake is great. I'm giving it only 4 stars because of the LONG WAIT!  Call before you go to find the wait time and make reservations."
n s.,"Honolulu, HI",0,22,5,4.0,6/30/2011,"As a local there aren't a lot of places I'd go to in Waikiki to eat (since the traffic is crazy) but Cheesecake Factory is the exception.  The selection alone is worth the long wait to be seated (mostly about an hour!).  If you can get through the wait you won't be disappointed in the quality of food and the huge selection of different entrees.  It's tasty and the service is pretty good.  Like I said, the only downfalls are getting through the traffic in Waikiki and the long wait to be seated.  But other than that, a great place to eat."
Susan S.,"Makakilo City, HI",0,3,,4.0,7/4/2010,"Had never been to a Cheesecake Factory until yesterday, when I went w/ 3 friends for lunch. I was expecting good desserts, but they (and the entrees) far surpassed by expectations. I had the Sante Fe salad (lunch portion - still too huge to finish), and it was very flavorful. One of my friends had chicken piccata, which looked delish. I saw calamari at a couple of other tables, and it looked wonderful, so I'll have to try that next time. The four of us split Chocolate Tuxedo and Red Velvet cheesecake for dessert. They were both so tasty, we were all moaning with pleasure. We thought we'd have to wait because we were there at about 1:00 on 4th of July weekend, but the wait was minimal - only about 5 minutes, I think. Our server (Aaron?) was delightful and funny. I don't go into Waikiki all that often, but I'm going to have to make the occasional special trip just to eat here."
Tiffany B.,"Princeville, HI",47,126,31,3.0,4/28/2009,"cheesecake facorty- i guess the name says it all! It's fun, but i think a bit overrated.  Smack dab in Waikiki and if you go there you're lucky to wait 30minutes to get a seat.  Food comes fast, service okay.  Nothing over to die for- except the cheesecake and STRAWBERRY MARTINIS!  What we usually fdo is squish our way to the back bar, claim a seat, order pupus, and strawberry martinis! the best ever! Just freshly muddled strawberries, vodka, and sugar! YUMMY!!!!!!!"
Carmen C.,"Chicago, IL",5,32,,4.0,1/11/2012,we came at 7:15pm and were told we had to wait for more than one   i decided to sit in bar area.this is the third cheesecake factory i   is also good.
Jennifer H.,"Honolulu, HI",73,169,80,4.0,6/30/2009,"You can never go wrong with Miso Salmon here. If you haven't tried it, TRY IT! I never cared much for salmon at most restaurants because they always tend to over -cook it, but Cheesecake Factory always does Salmon to perfection. It is glazed on top with miso terri sauce and rice on the bottom. There is this wonderful lemon butter sauce around with drops of teriyaki and snow peas are a perfect complement to the dish.  Oh yea and it's garished with shredded green onions...mmm...Everything here is great. Even the drinks. Factory Peach Bellini is my favorite drinks here. If you dont drink alcohol, get the passion iced tea.  If you should order anything you dont care much for, you can always change it. They are eager to please and very attentive here. This place has always been great. Oh yea, try the Ahi Poke and fried Ahi rolls for appetizer if you love Ahi Poke."
Chris F.,"San Francisco, CA",2,167,11,4.0,3/5/2010,"Cheesecake Factory - Waikiki Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center - Super place!  What more can you say?  For those of you not familiar with The Cheesecake Factory, they are quite popular in California and have a location on Kalakua Avenue in Waikiki.  They offer a boat load of very awesome food (casual dining) at a super price.  This is quite an accomplishment especially in Waikiki.  They offer almost everything imaginable from burgers and pastas, pizza's and appetizers, steaks and chicken dishes to gourmet salads and deserts.  The only downside is that because it's so good and affordable, the wait time can surpass 2 hours.  No need to worry, they offer take out which we did a couple times and took back to the room (and beach) which worked out super."
Chris L.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,9,,2.0,4/18/2010,"Im from San Francisco and the Cheescake factory out there is awesome! Never had a problem whatsoever! Out here in Oahu however it's not the case. The last two times we've had problems. FIrst time a piece of plastic was in my friends chicken. The waitress took it away and the manager came over. She sat down with us and it was really awkward, like it was girl time or something?! Then we got the bill and the dish was still on there, they comped the  first one but charged us for the second one! Weird that's not even a comp right?! Last night we returned. Party of 6. My Uncle's Prawns were served cold and his meal got there 7 minutes after everyone else's meals. That's unacceptable, right? Then the awkward male manager came over and with out even smiling, just offered to make us some more shrimp. We def needed a manager for that! wtf?! To top things off I asked my waitress for decaf coffee twice and failed to receive it at all! I  felt it was an embarrassing display of service. Going out to eat for special occasions elsewhere, for a while at least."
G M.,"Denver, CO",0,48,,3.0,1/14/2012,We have been there a few times over the years and it is always consistent: after a very long wait for a table you get good service and PLENTY of good solid food. We tried a variety of things on the extensive menu and no one was disappointed. Only complaint I have is they bring the entres too fast after the appetizer (but that seems to be a failing with all Hawaii restaurants) and then try to cram all the dishes onto the small tables. We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday boy got a rousing rendition of happy birthday from several waiters which was very nice.   They do however have surprisingly lousy cheesecake ( we have tried a half dozen different ones)  and the strawberry shortcake was rated not so hot either.
Dana C.,"Honolulu, HI",379,92,33,3.0,9/17/2008,The portions are large and maybe that's to make up for the lack of taste.  I give this place three stars only because their cheesecake is in fact very good.
Thom H.,"Onancock, VA",0,5,,3.0,2/15/2014,"it's hit or miss here. i proposed a few weeks ago, and we had an amazing dinner here, with really good service. but we have gone a few times and had really bad service, like drinks arriving after the main course."
Steve H.,"Stratham, NH",1,4,,5.0,3/16/2012,"Traveling solo? Go to the back bar. It is an easy way to get a quick seat. The bartender (Chad) was very helpful, and the food was great."
Ben B.,"SAGAMORE BCH, MA",0,16,1,4.0,3/3/2012,"Food was good, prices OK...just like any other Cheesecake Factory. There was always a long wait, and you weren't allowed to make a reservation."
Cheryl S.,"Honolulu, HI",154,171,135,3.0,6/22/2010,"If you don't mind waiting and want to be overwhelmed by a huge variety of choices to soothe your cravings then this is a one stop shop.  They have pastas to burgers, to fish to steak from salads to desserts.  One thing is remind yourself to bring your ""A"" game appetite with you as they do not give your portion control meal sizes but more like huge-gang-gious enormous portions which surely you will need to be rolled out of the place.  Most often known for their yummy fluffy cheesecakes this restaurant is sure to please you.  I recommend their lettuce wraps to start since that is more on the light side, for the main meal the salmon is good.  (BTW- Cheesecake Factory WHYYY??? Did you discontinue the Pad Thai Noodles.  That was my favorite and it was so YUMMY!) And you must, must, must save room for Cheesecake.  MY all time favorite, hands down...and will definitely for go any thoughts of a diet is their Key Lime Pie Cheesecake with of course EXTRA Whipped Cream DOH! That will surely complete any meal.  Also, for those of you who need a alcoholic beverage to swallow down your meal they have a full bar too."
Apryl G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",115,51,20,3.0,2/26/2009,"My first CF experience-and wow was it grand. I don't remember what I ate or drank (chicken most likely, and some fluffy girly drink I'm sure) but it satisfied. What I do remember is the ambiance-my god this was the most ornate and fluffily designed interior I'd ever dined in. I loved it, though it was almost overwhelming with all the grand swirls and loops and pastel frescos. Girliest restaurant ever! Of course I'm a fan!"
Jeff J.,"Las Vegas, NV",59,9,,5.0,1/18/2010,Wasabi crusted ahi is huge and out of this world good!
Eve B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,11/1/2010,"It is Halloween night in Waikiki and been trying to get a dinner reservation to eat dinner here since Friday. They refuse to take phone reservation so they advise you to go personally. As a LOCAL and new transplant from the mainland, my husband and I decided to go tthere personally and make reservation. We show up and was told that they could not give us reservation way ahead of time since it is for Sunday. The girl told me to come back on Sunday and get reservation anytime  of the  day. I said okay. Today Sunday at 1130 AM, we show up to make reservation and we were denied again. We were told they will not take reservations period. I asked for the Manager. My husband and I spoke to the Manager and he told  us to come back between 5:30-6:00 pm tonight and there should not be a problem getting a dinner reservation . We showed up at the appointed time of 5:45pm and were  again DENIED. Unbelievable. I have never experienced this in my entire life!!!  My blood pressure is now sky rocketing. I told the girl in the front that I had spoken with the  day manager, described his appearance. She told Me that there are 4 managers with the same appearance. She IMPLIED AND made me feel like I was lying. That I DID NOT appreciate. I asked for the  Manager to clear up this mess.  We spoke to a JT and would not  honor my plea. I described to him again that I had spoken to the day manager, described to him what he looked like.  He then confirmed that such manager does exist, but JT was no help other than it will probably take 3 hours before we are seated. Unbelievable !  We followed all the instructions they gave us, yet it resulted negatively. I asked him to take my name down or give me a pager even if it takes three hours to eat. I told him that we are locals and it is very disturbing the way we were treated. This should not happen. I will not be recommending this to my local and mainland friends and family. This was a very bad experience in which we DO NOT want to go through ever again. WE JUST WANTED TO EAT DINNER ON  A SUNDAY NIGHT, GRANTED IT WAS A HALLOWEEN NIGHT.  Can you believe the absurdity of it all?  Pathetic.  I want to talk to CORPORATE TOMORROW. Giving this place a 1 Star was being generous."
Jennifer G.,"Dallas, TX",344,608,123,4.0,11/4/2008,It's the cheesecake factory. You know what you are going to get. Good food a huge portion and an awesome piece of cheesecake. I got takeout one night from here and had lunch here another day. Sometimes I like predictability.... and always I like Cheesecake :)
