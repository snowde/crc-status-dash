Denese U.,"Mililani, HI",6,5,,2.0,9/27/2011,"I had lunch today at cheesecake factory in Waikiki, and was very disappointed with the service. Our servers name was Luke and he seemed very bored and not interested in his job as well as his customers. He completely ignored us when we asked him questions and then THREW a cocktail napkin at me! I guess because I was seated at the end of the booth so he couldnt reach me?? But still, you never throw something at someone! Very disappointing!:("
Rockie B.,"Vallejo, CA",5,41,15,4.0,4/2/2011,"Ok, so I know that TCF is located in the Bay Area where I reside but why did it take me to travel all the way to OAHU to try this restaurant? Go figure.  My mom and I actually ran across this restaurant by accident. We weren't looking for it but our tired little feet was telling us ""would you two bittys stop somewhere now?""  We listened and stop and said ""oh, the cheesecake factory"" and went in...Our wait was about 20minutes even though i thought is was going to longer being how crowded it was on the tourist attraction island.While we waited we saw all of the delicious desserts and settled on one to share after our meal. Anyway, we perused the menu and both ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes...DELICIOUS..We were so stuffed and unfortunately the hotel we were staying didn't have a microwave, we had to leave some of our food behind...and we couldn't order the dessert, too full.. (BTW, why are the hotels so expensive there but looks and smell so dated? We even spent a pretty penny on our rooming accomdations(learned my lesson) Anyway,..we enjoyed our dinner so much, can you believe we went back the next day? Yes we did and de ja vu....we still didn't order the dessert, we were too full again...."
Brian L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,375,,3.0,9/1/2009,"We arrived around 9p and sat in the back bar area because there was a wait for a table.  That was fun!  Our bartender was really nice and it was fun and energetic to sit there on our first night in town. We had the ahi poke and the bbq ranch salad which was plenty of food for two people.  I had the ahi without the spicy sauce so it was a bit bland with just the soy sauce.   A bit touristy for me, but we were tired and hungry.  The bathrooms are always clean."
mINCe I.,"Honolulu, HI",87,58,63,2.0,9/2/2008,"went here on a friday night around eight and the wait time was about 70 minutes. usually when we go to the cheesecake factory we'll go and shop since we know the wait is long but for some reason i was being a puta and we just sat down on the benches. our buzzer goes off about an hour later and so we go and give it to the hostess and she makes us wait another ten minutes so another hostess can show us to our table. turns out our table wasn't ready so we were standing in the hallway for a good five minutes.  so the server is actually very good at greeting us and getting some water and bread while we look at the menu. we place our order and in no time got our food. i ordered the seared ahi tuna salad since i know i wouldn't be able to finish any of their main entrees. the salad was actually pretty good with the exception of the slice tomatoes. the tomatoes were more than ripe and just had a pesto sauce on top. it would have been better if they sprinkled a little salt on top. so why only two star?  well i got really pissed at the server when i ordered a glass of red wine and he asked me for identification. i show him my identification card and he has the nerve to tell me ""OH YOUR THAT OLD""! at the end of the night i paid him back by leaving no tip."
Laur T.,"New York, NY",26,780,,3.0,12/29/2008,"3.5 stars!  To be frank, this particular Cheesecake Factory is a few steps away from my hotel in HNL. I was not exactly happy to find it there and would have preferred a more upscale dining spot in its place. Each time I walked by, I'd shrug at the thought of the long lines... people dying to get in. There ARE better places to dine at people! But alas, fate brought me here during my 1 week here in which I thought I would never enter this spot ;p Friend decided to do a late 945pm dinner by one of the seaside spots that didn't serve dessert other than the typical ice cream. I wasn't feeling hungry but I had chocolate cake on my mind ;p 1055pm, we went across the street to Haagen Daaz hoping to get some cake, no such luck. Then friend somehow recalled that the Cheesecake Factory (back on other side of street) serves till 11pm and we could get our cake if we hurried. Ran across the street, got into Cheesecake in the nick of time, changed our minds, decided to do take-out so we can enjoy the slice in our lovely room @ the Moana Surfrider. Took a while to decide what to get... ended up with the Choc fudge (never fails!). Ooops forgot to tell them no whipped cream! They were faster than the speed of light... the cake was packed and in the blink of an eye 3 flower squirts of cream was already accompanying our slice in the box. Oh well. Retreated to our room to savor the gigantic slice, bite after bite. Yum~"
Rita L.,"Mililani, HI",257,547,29,5.0,9/17/2008,"i don't have anything bad to say but the lines here! you can't get anything horrible here...my favorite is the di vinci pasta and the chicken medeira! ahh and to finish off with cheesecake!! dang!!! ohhh, so yummy!"
Kaybees G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,15,,1.0,8/14/2011,"i absolutely love the cheesecake factory. they have awesome cheesecakes. i have been to the vegas one twice now, as well as the honolulu one 3-4 times now. however this last time i went, i took my husband who had never been there before. we ordered 2 different appetizers and when our main dish came both of our pastas were over cooked. the noodles were soggy to the point where it was sooo chewy and looked like slop. i almost wanted to barf. i let the waitstaff know and while they did make us another one we ended up taking it to go. when we got home, the noodles were still soggy, probably from the same batch. so i have to give the cheesecake factory a thumbs down on that night especially because we spent $129 including tip. sooo ummm i'd much rather spend that money at top of waikiki or tony roma's...orrrr not at all. disappointed...:("
KT R.,"Atlanta, GA",29,166,,5.0,1/11/2010,"generally speaking, i don't have a whole lot of love for corporate chain restaurants, but you've got to admit the cheesecake factory makes a damn good cheesecake.  probably the best i've ever had.  when my boyfriend was visiting we ended up here every other night, just for the cheesecake (although they have a really extensive dinner menu, as well).  yeah, it's $8 a slice, but i'm pretty sure their prices are the same as on the mainland, unlike some other corporate chains (cough cough, mcdonald's) that jack the prices up just because they're in waikiki. oh, if you want a table at normal dinner time (say anytime after seven), be prepared to wait a bit - this place gets really crowded."
Pudgee W.,"Honolulu, HI",19,174,,5.0,8/27/2008,"Good salad and food. Best location in Waikiki. Always love to go there with the hubby. They have the best chinese chicken salad ever~! and we love the avocado rolls, & Madeira chicken~!!! and of-course their cheesecakes but i try to stay away from it since this is beach-town!!!"
Kelli Z.,"Honolulu, HI",1,5,,4.0,3/30/2011,"The only thing that sucks about this place is the wait. I mean really... but it IS Waikiki. So it's not like there's NOTHING to do with the time. Thank goodness for the awesome three-story Forever21 right next door. :D Food was great. Price to portion ratio is really good, I shared some chicken thing with my boyfriend. What I was really waiting for was the dessert though! I remember reading a review before for the strawberry shortcake. I've never had it before, but the review made it seem so good, so I wanted to try it. I know, it's called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason... but trust me!! YOU NEED TO TRY THE STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. It's under the other specialty desserts after the cheesecakes on the menu. My friends all said they were full, but after this dessert came out it didn't seem like they were so full anymore! After a big heavy meal this one dessert was big enough to share between the four of us. Soooo delicious. Definitely the highlight of the meal. Now I keep telling my other friends to go there and try it, it's that memorable. Mmm... I'm not sure the dessert alone would be enough to wait longer then an hour for though. There were also musicians. They were pretty good! They didn't know islands in the stream, but they did know i'm yours! Yay for requests!"
L R.,"Somerville, MA",47,121,35,1.0,3/5/2008,"People, stop going here and waiting in long lines for nothing. Hawaii has a lot more to offer. And guess what? There's probably one of these in your neighborhood."
Vicky B.,"Honolulu, HI",2,34,,1.0,10/17/2008,"The wait is not worth the food.  I have no idea why people have the desire to wait, and wait, for mediocre food that's overpriced.  The ambiance on the patio is nice, can't beat the tiki torches and foliage, BUT the food just doesn't do it for me.   $13 for a loco moco?  Sorry, but I'll pass.  If you ask for the different types of bread for the burgers just make sure it fits the burger.  I got the rye bread which was just the dinner rolls cut, needless to say, the burger didn't fit.  My friends got the brownie sundae... and left it untouched.  Yes, we should have got cheesecake, but one would hope their other items were decent.  Blah, save your $$ and go somewhere else in Waikiki."
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,1888,1488,3.0,2/17/2008,"No wait around 2PM, thankfully. I wouldnt bother going around noon and dinnertime- why waste your vacation waiting over an hour to get a table? The food is the same as every other Cheesecake Factory. We tried an ahi tuni appetizer on wonton skins and then also a thai salad (cant find it on the menu anymore)... both were good. Service was also friendly. I have no complaints about visiting during off-peak hours."
JDizzle D.,"Honolulu, HI",1,30,,4.0,10/11/2007,"OK,  i know its a chain restaurant, but i really enjoy going there.  its Very easy for a couple, and sometimes easy for 3 people to find seating at the bar area rather quickly.  I'm sure most people hate the long wait, so i never get seated.  you can order anything from the full menu at the bar, so this is great.  i wish they would upgrade there TVs behind the bar.  Well there menu is Huge, and for having a menu so big, most the food is above average.  The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is my fav.  its so good served really cold.  They are also the only place that has Absolute Peppar,; which is the only way to have a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning!"
Matt K.,"San Jose, CA",39,366,13,4.0,7/15/2008,"I really tried to stay away from chain's during my stay in Hawaii but I had such a craving for the BBQ Chicken Salad. We ended up going there for dinner and there was a huge crowd there so we were surprised when seated in 15 minutes. Got a great table on the outside patio. Great for people watching as they walk by and gawk at the food. =) The food quality is pretty much the same as all other locations. Our server was very nice, must be the Hawaiian hospitality.  Solid place to go when you are on the strip. Great location and great for people watching."
Jeannie C.,"San Francisco, CA",19,102,1,3.0,8/26/2007,An absolute mob scene.  I don't think there's ever anything less than an hour wait for dinner.  You can take a stab at trying to score bar area seats by stalking every party you think is about to leave while trying to outmaneuver every other stalker cuz it's first come first serve there.  I was practically sitting on this poor guy's lap in anticipation of him & his wife leaving soon.  SCORE!  I felt like I won the lottery when I finally made contact w/ the seat.  Then I wanted to order every last 1000 things on the menu to make it all worthwhile.
David T.,"San Mateo, CA",2,50,,4.0,4/14/2007,"Hey its the Cheesecake Factory. If you've ever been to one you are going to wait a long time to sit down. Luckily for us, I was buzzed and my wife is pregnant so we both had the munchies and it was only 5:30. No line!  Had Buffalo strips. Any place with Buffalo strips has a place in my heart. Buffalo wings are a waste of a dead bird. Buffalo strips make it much more worth while. Speaking of dead animals. My steak was great for a Cheesecake joint. I've never really had a miss at TCF. Wife liked her salad too.  Mai Tais were off the hook. I was asleep by 8!"
Catharina J.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,4.0,1/12/2011,"This one is probably the best cheesecake factory in the country and I could care less if I was wrong. Of course, waiting part is definitely pain in the butt and I want to give 3 stars for their poor waiting list system. They either page too early or clerks have no desire to organize system because the front area was just way  too crowded with the people that have been paged and it reminded me of a fish market I saw on TV. But let's get back to the positive sides. Our server was very friendly without any fake attitude and his jokes were real. LOL And I had the BEST mojito EVER. Who would've ever thought you could get the best mojito at Cheesecake Factory??? I had a passion fruit mojito and I might go later just for that. I wish I could have another one but I had a very early flight next morning. :( Buffalo wings and fried calamari we had as appetizers were pretty good. I took a bite of a green chile burger my friend had and I was IMPRESSED!!! And I had cajun jambalaya pasta and the words cant describe best how good it was. I am the biggest fan of Creole food and a lot of places like to play with the word, 'spicy' or 'hot' and I always need to have extra hot sauce or crushed red pepper on deck but whoaaa boy, this one right here??? It had a very delightful kick to it and"
Mal N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,,5.0,6/19/2010,Best service received thus far on the island and there are quit a few places that provide great service.  We know the Cheesecake Factory and are familiar with the menu and quality of the food.  Everything including the service is superb.  Thousand times better than the service you get in the restaurants found in Hilton Hawaiian Village.
