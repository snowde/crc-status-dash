T Q.,"San Francisco, CA",0,32,,1.0,8/19/2009,The wait was loooong...1 hour and we got meatloaf that was still raw.  Yuck.
Elle P.,"Kauai, HI",0,2,,5.0,9/26/2010,"I wish I could rememer our server's name, because he was phenomenal. It was an incredible busy night, CRAZY busy, and my husband and I arrived with our toddler. I was convinced we'd wait forever once seated, but our server was so on it. He was so thorough, brought out my son's food immediately (which is a HUGE plus for those of us with toddlers),and had drinks on our table within minutes. He was so friendly, as were the bussers, and I'm not kidding, the place was packed with huge parties. It was just the three of us and it was as if we were the only people there, service-wise. I give them 5 stars for that, not many places can pull that off. Our food was fabulous too!"
On P.,"Irvine, CA",29,27,6,3.0,10/19/2007,"A friend felt like pasta so we decided on the Cheesecake factory for lunch today.  He was craving the 4 cheese pasta.  He seemed to like it since there weren't any leftovers.  On the otherhand, I had a few minor complaints about this particular location.  First off, the bread.  It wasn't warm.  It's always warm when the waiter brings it to the table (at least the one at the Irvine Spectrum; that's the appeal of bread).  Ok, so, I can overlook that, but we ordered the guacamole made to order spicy.  Didn't really taste the spice.  It was rather bland; like avocado on a tortilla chip.  My main dish was the luau chicken salad.  Usually, love love love this dish, but it was drenched in dressing.  Wasn't feeling the love today.   Boba had the crusted chicken romano.  I loved the parmesan on the chicken and the pasta had a light tomato cream sauce.  He through a ton of red pepper flakes on it.  SPICY!     It's a nice spot and will be even better when they finish off the construction next door.  Also, sit out on the outdoor patio.  Great place to people watch."
Phil T.,"Overland Park, KS",0,8,,1.0,6/10/2010,"Seriously, these guys must be sandbagging reviews. I'll bet this is staff and family writing these. Food and service is just OK, why fly to Hawaii and go to a chain like this when there is so much more to offer. Cheesecake factory portions are too big, the food is bad for you (did you see their entrees have more than 2000 calories!), the wait is ridiculous it makes it look busy but the food takes forever to get to you and service is slow. No wonder there is a long line out front. I will not waste my time again and will second think eating at the factory back home."
K. i. S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,68,,2.0,5/30/2012,"Went at 4PM on a Sat night with a group of 12.  We arrived late so the rest were already seated.  The noise level was so high that my hearing aids automatically shut down to avoid further hearing loss due.  I gave a mic to someone thinking I could at least hear what she was saying over the ambient noise.  No, that didn't work either.  Finally gave up.  Made app't w/ audiologist to try to program hearing aids for noisy environment and he said Cheesecake Factory is probably #1 in noise level followed closely by the Yard House.  Hey, guess where the group is meeting next month?  Hubby and I will pass next month's gathering.  Food is nothing special.  Hubby had seafood jambalaya which was filling but not great.  I helped myself to a shrimp which was so overdone that it was a shame.  My hint of chicken with almond sandwich was forgettable and the soup was a disgrace.  Thought having dessert might be redeeming but didn't want to chance it.  The previous time we went to Cheesecake Factory, the food was so bad we didn't even take the left-overs home.  Hate to bad mouth a place on one visit but this second chance was no improvement so not willing to chance a third time.  Sorry Waikiki but Marina del Rey location was MUCH better and we could actually hear conversations rather than trying to read lips :(  Fooled us twice and there won't be another chance.  SORRY...."

Tyrell M.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,7,,4.0,4/14/2010,"This place has got something on the menu for everyone.  Its a great place for groups, but you usually have quite a bit of a wait.  The Miso Salmon dish was one of the best pieces of fish I've tasted on this island.  The banana cheesecake was also sooo good.  Cheesecake is my favorite food in the world, so I will hopefully make another trip here in the near future."
Dana G.,"Mililani, HI",0,9,,4.0,7/8/2010,"Busy!!  And it takes a while to get in but we had great service, excellent food, and a nice wine.  A must if you want to eat in an interesting spot!"
Kurt K.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,31,,3.0,3/25/2010,Decent food.  Fast service.  Stay away from the Ahi Tuna unless you like non-sushi grade ahi.
Christina H.,"Bothell, WA",58,96,46,1.0,8/23/2008,"I only went to CF in Waikiki because my travling group.  There were 8 of us.  We knew the wait time would be long, so we arrived at 5:20.  At first we were told it would be 25 to 40 minutes wait.  ~20 minutes later, our pager buzzed.  Excitedly going to see the hostess, told to wait next to the dessert bar, another 10 min later we were told it was a mistake.  ""There will be a table for you between 25 and 40 min"".  At that point, it's too late to go to any decent place and eat within an hour, so we decided to wait.  Once we were seated, our table was in the back room next to a bar.  The music and blender combined, we could not have a conversation with the person sitting next.  They ran out of two items on the menu AFTER we placed our order.  One order came with mayo after specially asked not to.  My Tuna Poke was too salty that I could not finish. The only rason I gave it ONE star was the stiff drinks. My maitai was good and strong.  Perhaps I should have had two while I was waiting and my experience would not feel so awful."
D. N.,"Portland, OR",3,108,,4.0,5/16/2009,"I have never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory on the mainland but whenever my family and I visit my dad, who lives a few blocks away, we like to check out CF and we haven't been disappointed.  I have been impressed with the quality of the appetizers and entrees.  The weekend brunch menu is very good and reasonably priced for Waikiki.  The staff here is friendly and helpful and we always find something for our little ones though there is not a keikei menu.   They are also very family friendly here and since we eat on the early side, we never really have problems getting a table.  The cheesecake is good too, btw, though I have had the original cheesecake back in the day when CF was just a small restaurant in Beverly Hills where you could buy a piece of cheesecake to-go and eat it in the car because your are broke and in high school, oh I digress, and I remember the cheesecake to be phenomenal but that was before it became a corporate giant.  Oh well, the cheesecake is still pretty good!"
Javier C.,"Honolulu, HI",1,64,,5.0,7/1/2008,"Five stars, although we end up waiting almost an hour on a sunday nite, we were glad to be seated at the scarface round table (just the three of us)  the macademia fish was great and the filet mignon a little bit dry but got fixed with a bottle of A1. Great service, good times. The Godiva Chocolate cheescake and the vanilla cheescake are out of this world."
