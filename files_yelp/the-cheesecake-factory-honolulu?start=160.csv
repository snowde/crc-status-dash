Dani A.,"Manhattan, NY",344,118,68,4.0,2/14/2017,This was the one time where I found Cheesecake Factory was the better value meal coming in at an affordable price. Dang Honolulu is expensive. Like San Francisco or NYC expensive. NOTE: The line gets incredibly long. It's easy to have an hour wait because this place has a prime location on the strip. I'd suggest calling in 45 minutes before and setting up a reservation. I went to TCF and ate a ton of bread rolls and a massive salad. I was full the rest of the night into the morning. Same old Cheesecake Factory as anywhere else. It's a classic.
Lianne A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,2.0,11/29/2017,"Did a phone order, picked up my dinner and headed home.  When I got home and opened the package there were no corn in the Santa Fe Salad and the Factory Nachos had no guacamole and sour cream.  This was a total disappointment."
Toni S.,"Red Oak, TX",27,22,56,4.0,5/4/2017,"Great atmosphere here (probably because it's Hawaii!) There are a few items on the menu that aren't available in Texas, where I live. I went with the pizza and red Velvet cheesecake and both were amazing! The service was great, and the staff very friendly."
kristine f.,"Honolulu, HI",92,185,234,4.0,9/8/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those chains that anyone in your party can find something they'll enjoy. Portions are massive and always good to share. While I'm not a huge fan of ""chain restaurants"" I do enjoy few things on the Cheesecake Factory menu.  This past Valentine's Day weekend we did a staycation in Waikiki. It was in our plans to shop around Riyal Hawaiian while we waited the hour plus for a two top. But luckily, the bf spotted two sweet seats at the bar. Score! I struggled with what to order since you know the menu is a freakin' novel with advertisements in them too. Lol. After a few sips of my Long Island Ice Tea I decided on the lunch special with choice of pizza and salad. I ordered the Caesar Salad and Chicken Sausage Pizza. All of the staff there said it was a great choice as that combo one of their all time faves. BF ordered his usual Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Yummers!  Cheers to a chain that's consistent and has something for everyone."
Maile S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,5.0,11/28/2017,By far my favorite place to go. The menu is huge and nothing is ever bad. Service is quick once you get a table and the Godiva brownie Sunday is always a cheat meal winner!
Nadia K.,"Mililani, HI",644,601,1787,4.0,7/13/2016,"The lines here are insane.  Insane.   Lots of tourists because it's a safe choice in Waikiki.  My friend and her son really wanted to eat here so we endured the wait.   Once we were seated, bread and water were immediately brought out.  Service was excellent and our entrees came out super fast.     The best part of my meal were the generous wine pours!  Love!!! Save room for dessert and TIP your servers!!!"
Kariss F.,"Honolulu, HI",0,17,37,4.0,5/14/2017,Good variety selection of varies types of food. The wait can be VERY long..so plan some hours ahead..wait staff is friendly and personable and I'm sure everyone in your party can find something they like that fit their taste buds.
Alan A.,"Honolulu, HI",41,82,133,3.0,3/26/2017,"Great location with the traditional Cheesecake Factory fare... the server even told me so! However, she was quick to point out the local selections, which today included the Mac-nut crusted Ono ($28).  The atmosphere was relaxing for lunch, with ample seating in their patio (facing Kalakaua Ave). The indoor seating is dark and cool if you need to cool off from the Honolulu sun. The bar has a fun Waikiki style, with pineapple lamps along the bar. Park at the Royal Hawaiian Center parking garage (entrance is past Lewers); they will validate your ticket and you might get away with not having to pay for parking during lunch."
Rita V.,"Vancouver, Canada",3,20,6,4.0,11/25/2017,"The food is very decent and the portions are huge. Although the line seems to be very long, actual waiting time is always very short - it's a very big restaurant with lots of tables and servers, so don't be discouraged by the people waiting outside to get in. My favourite dishes were ""Chicken Madeira"", ""Chicken Marsala"" and ""Seared Ahi tuna"" - very tasty, I couldn't stop eating when I had to, shame on me... Most of the servers were great: friendly, fast, very attentive and caring: Jeffery, Theresa, Michelle, Sontamo (sp?) to name a few. I put 4 stars only because of 2 servers we had last 2 times we dined there: one didn't introduce herself and was very arrogant and inattentive (brought water with ice although we clearly asked without ice) and Sacarra M, whose face expressed annoyance with everyone and everything around her, she didn't smile even once and made us feel very unwelcome, like as if she couldn't wait to get rid of us. We tried couple of cheesecakes there, but were not impressed (funny, considering their name). All in all I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner - one of a few places in Waikiki that doesn't serve exclusively Asian food."
D F.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Canada",1,48,43,3.0,3/7/2017,"This is a restaurant chain. I've also been to the one in Miami. The things they both have in common is there is always a long wait and the air conditioning is pretty high. So bring a sweater. We came at an irregular hour so got seated fairly quickly.  Don't eat any bread cuz the portions are big.  For appetizers we got the Avocado Egg rolls. Although it's fried, it's very good! The guacamole was good but a little spicy even though we asked for mild, and it's repetitive of the eggrolls. Hubby got the ahi poke and said it was ok.  For the main we got the Avocado Salad with chicken. It was too spicy and saucy. My mother in law got the falafel salad. It was too creamy.  Next time get something else and make sure it is not spicy at all because everything seems to have added spice.  The only reason I'm giving this a 3 star is cuz I remember the food being better."
Stardust B.,"Honolulu, HI",4,23,628,2.0,1/20/2017,Very long wait to get a table and then to get our food. One of my friends didn't get her pizza until we were almost done with our dinner. Management didn't seem to care that we were waiting forever.
Wesley A.,"Mililani, HI",277,46,55,1.0,10/4/2017,We went to this restaurant tonight and ordered a pizza. We had to wait over 30 minutes for our food. It was very busy but that's not an excuse to make their customers wait so long. I highly recommend going to eat at any other restaurant that serves their customers in a timely manner...no more than 15 minutes. And their prices are ridiculously high. We ended up leaving with our pizza ...the manager didn't charge us because we had to wait so ridiculously long. I will never go there again and I highly recommend everyone else do the same. Unless you want to wait forever for your food that costs an arm and a leg!!!
Vaughn A.,"Waipahu, HI",3,12,14,4.0,1/27/2017,My family and I just come here mostly for their cheesecake because it's so good. We only waited 10 minutes for our waiter to come and ask what we wanted to order and food came in on time.
Salma K.,"Lathrop, CA",5,25,20,5.0,3/29/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is always a fun place to go to for dinner! They have such a variety that my bf hates it because he can't decide what he wants. Lol Which is a good thing for me at least.  Our server was probably one of the best servers we have had in a very long time. He was very attentive and always made sure everything was okay. We always had drinks on the table wether it was alcoholic, soda or even water. He kept us stocked up.  We had ordered something off the menu and didn't realize it had pork on it. It was totally our fault. Regardless, the manager came over and apologized and even took it off our tab. We even explained that it was our mistake and we were taken care of. That is incredible service!  If I can give them more than 5 stars, I would. Thank you to all over here!  I will update this review with our servers name."
Jen B.,"Northwest, Portland, OR",77,176,244,5.0,7/31/2016,"This review is based solely on the cheesecake!!  I have actually never had a meal at this Cheesecake Factory location but have stopped by for a slice occasionally.  My daughter also loves their cheesecake and requested we go here after dinner at a nearby restaurant.  Today was also 1/2 off a slice for national cheesecake day, so how could I refuse. I decided to try something new and opted for the carrot cake cheesecake.  This was the best decision of the day!  The carrot cake was delicious and moist and paired awesomely with the creamy cheesecake.  This one just went to the top of my cheesecake faves list!"
Serena M.,"Honolulu, HI",50,187,873,3.0,7/11/2016,"Going to Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night is something I wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was so crowded and so many people were just waiting for a table. People were being told that the wait was two hours long! Luckily we outsmarted them and called ahead to make reservations. We just had to wait 15 minutes for our table.  Cheesecake Factory has a very long extensive menu and it was difficult to decide what to eat. I have so many food restrictions in my diet and many of their items are on my do not eat list. I decided on Fettucine Alfredo. My husband and our friend got the Hibachi Steak. He was originally going to get a burger but changed his mind because of our waiter.  Our waiter was a very charismatic guy. He made us feel very welcomed when he greeted us at the table and he shared the staff favorites. One of them was the Hibachi Steak. He raved about the sauce and the meat and that sold my husband. So no burger and instead he got the steak.  My husband really enjoyed his steak. I didn't really care for my Alfredo. It seemed like it was lacking something, like pepper or something. It tasted so plain.  So I guess I give three stars to my dinner, four stars to the waiter, and of course five stars for the delicious cheesecake."
Angela C.,"Honolulu, HI",1010,278,1715,2.0,11/27/2015,"The day after Thanksgiving is crowded here, inside the Cheesecake Factory. There was a line out of the door. However, we sat ourselves immediately at the bar area, instead of waiting for an hour. The Hot wings were too salty, the chopped salad were tasty, but too expensive for its size. The bartenders were fast and efficient, but very nervous and overworked, they want to get you I and out as soon as they can."
Janel A.,"Honolulu, HI",33,83,88,3.0,1/15/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here today after 3PM & right when we walked in, there was no line or wait! So we basically came in at the perfect time but when we left after 430ish PM they eventually got a line & people were waiting. Our male server (forgot his name :( ) was amazing until we got another server, which a woman took his place. We first started off with 3 appetizers with him. We started off with the fried calamari, the spicy ahi tempura roll & fried Mac & cheese. When he came back to check up on us & asked if we wanted to order any entrees, we were not ready & decided to take time to eat the appetizers. About 30 minutes in, I believe, that's when our servers got switched. She asked if we been here before & I said I been here before but it was my boyfriends first time here. Towards the ending of our food, she said something like ya you never been here before something like that which I took that as a rude compliment. Like I'm from here & I been here like a long time ago & yes I did say that I been here before but she didn't have to accuse me of lying that I never had been here before. I totally forgot that the plates were big & that she didn't have to make such a rude remark. Even my boyfriend said that was rude of her for saying such a thing, but whatever's. For a skinny girl like me, I had ordered 2 lunch specials which was the pasta & salmon. I ended up only eating half of my miso salmon & a few bites of my pasta. I ended up taking my food home along with my boyfriends order & ended up eating it at home. Not too sure if I would want to try here again but maybe next time my boyfriend & I would have a friendlier server."
Kelly E.,"Fitzroy, Australia",2,16,2,3.0,5/7/2017,Okay so it's a chain and the wait is hideous. But I appreciate the salads as big enough to fill you up and healthy enough you don't feel sick.  We are here twice this week as they have a pretty decent kids menu too.  But two issues that occurred on both days. 1. If you order a second beer it will not arrive unless you ask to cancel the order because you've finished the meal and then it arrives - flat. 2. The Luau salad is awesome. But it says it comes with pineapple (or orange) pieces on the menu. I can't actually remember which because it didn't appear either time. Shame it sounded great. It's not like pineapple is hard to get here.
Lanie P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,71,1,5.0,8/13/2017,"I thanked my children for sharing a slice of cheesecake, it was delicious. I need to return to your eatery for more."
