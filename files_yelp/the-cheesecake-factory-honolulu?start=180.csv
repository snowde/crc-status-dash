Jen S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,20,44,3.0,9/16/2017,Called in for take out. The person who answered phone was really efficient and nice.  I am satisfied with the service and the food but they only validate for an hour now. Used to be 2 hours but now an hour less and it's a huge change for me.
TaraMarie P.,"Waianae, HI",228,254,77,4.0,12/12/2016,"Parking is probably the biggest issue I have with this place but other than that, the food is on-point. I love getting the pasta alfredo here and my cheesecake of choice is anything with peanutbutter :-P"
Annabelle V.,"Ewa Beach, HI",14,4,9,5.0,4/6/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat.  Food was delicious. I had the shrimp scampi and Diane steaks with linguine pasta with a side order of alfredo sauce.  For my drink I ordered the mango smoothies it was super delicious. The service was awesome, our server was Cecine she was very quick and nice.  Actually the rest of the staffs was awesome.  For the desert I ordered the Godiva cheesecake as my birthday cake, it was delicious.  I will be back again."
Mandy Lee H.,"Honolulu, HI",89,75,278,3.0,11/8/2015,"Expect for a long wait! The wait is usually around 45 minutes for dinner whenever we visit, the wait tonight was 1 hour and 40 minutes for a booth (Saturday night). I suggest shopping around the area to pass the time; there is not a lot of seating space near the restaurant where you can wait. There are some benches along the side of the restaurant and a rock wall near the street where people often wait.  When we got to our table, they were in the middle of clearing the previous meal. We waited to the side. The hostess apologized and chatted with us so the wait wasn't as awkward... then after a bit, excused herself to help the others clear our table.  We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, and fried calamari as our appetizers. The fried macaroni is my favorite appetizer, there are 4 deep fried macaroni and cheese balls, served with a delicious creamy marinara sauce.  The server could have been better. There was a problem where one of our entrees was taking a while to come out, but assured us that our meal was on the top of the priority list. He even offered us a soup or salad while we waited (we denied), which was nice. We ordered the chicken piccata and the bistro shrimp pasta, which were both very delicious.  At the end of our meal, we placed our parking ticket with our credit card when paying our check, and later found out that it was not validated and we had to pay the full price of parking. This was the first time we had this problem, hopefully this was a mindless mistake and it hardly happens to other people. The food at Cheesecake Factory is always very good, it's the wait and the service that usually gets the negative review from me."
Dione H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",95,4,2,5.0,9/3/2017,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a long time only because it's all the way in Waikiki.  But tonight since my daughter is staying at the Halekoa we decided to go.  I am so happy we did!  We had the greatest waiter named Cory with the cool mustache.  He was polite, quirky, funny and gave us sincerely humble service.  The food was delicious especially the fresh banana cheesecake!  The service overall was great and the ambiance has a trendy island vibe. Can't wait till they open in Kamakana Alii.  Maybe Cory lives on the Westside and decides to transfer.  I'll be looking for him for sure!"
Won C.,"Pomfret, CT",0,16,8,1.0,8/4/2016,"Worst Pasta I had in a long time. It was made with sea water from beach in front. So salty, I could not take more than few bites. My wife's pasta and son's pasta was the same. Ice cappucino was just coffee with cream and ice in it.  Never coming here again."
Sheena Y.,"Toronto, Canada",876,449,1854,4.0,1/2/2016,"I love cheesecake factory.  Not only are the cheesecakes the bomb.  Their food is great also. For cheesecake, banana cream pie is a must have.  You will thank me later. Last night a girlfriend and I had the lettuce wraps and kalua pork nachos.  The servings were huge and tasty. You really can't go wrong with anything in their menu."
Sandy L.,"Honolulu, HI",101,21,,3.0,12/13/2016,"My name is Sandy Y. Lai.  My middle initial Y. signifies that I am respectable and also that I am a signatory.  That means that I am a person of superior status, and without surprise am part of the Executive membership participants for COSTCO food group.  During the process of my MA in Education I went to the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki.  My first time I had the Thai Wrap which consisted of lettuce with meat and peanut - it was delicious!  I also went back and felt compelled to have a sandwich once.  The place is really big - it seats lots and lots of diners. I remember being happy that Waikiki has so many good places for eats.  And I bought a little stuffed teddy bear which said ""Cheesecake Factory""  on it - and remembered that with my little pouch of a belly --- Sandy Y. Lai is chubby and chaste and sweet!"
Rachael O.,"Ewa Beach, HI",241,96,55,2.0,2/6/2017,I have visited Cheese Cake factory a couple times and the food just really isn't good to be honest.. there isn't very good options on the menu and the wait is always long..... I think your paying more for the atmosphere than the actual food... it is quite overpriced too... now I have only been to the one in Honolulu so I hope to visit one on the mainland soon!
Mo M.,"Monterey, CA",83,130,91,5.0,3/29/2017,The best Cheesecake Factory I have been to. They got cheap pineapple drinks. Sean was an excellent server and made us all laugh. The food was delicious and we have been here twice now. This place gets really busy so make sure you have plan accordingly.
Chana S.,"Honolulu, HI",8,43,57,1.0,1/22/2017,"This review went from 4 stars to 1 in a matter of mins. I was totally flabbergasted when I saw a lady with her non service animal dog with its head on a table, then lap up water from a drinking cup! I'm sorry I didn't get a pic and even more sorry we came here.  The bus person halfway wiped the table and the the next customers were seated. I'm in total yuck!! Hubby called the MGR over and he was fully apologetic and had the table properly recleaned."
Jake T.,"Aiea, HI",2,198,433,5.0,7/10/2016,"You always have to expect a long wait at any good restaurant or it's probably not good. It was well worth the wait. Huge portions which makes it worth the money. I would consider doing family style ordering the next time we visit, since portions are large. I would recommend salad, pizza and pasta dish, enough for 3 adults (daddy, 1 teenage boy and mommy) and 1 female teenager. It also includes all you can eat bread.  We order slices of cheesecake to go, if not, you'll kick yourself in the pants for not taking the opportunity to eat what, after all, they're named for. Although...the tall chocolate cake is to die for (it was so good, I forgot what it's called, my mind went blank and I made up my own name for it,  decadence).  Forget the fricken cheesecake, you must try the 7 layer chocolate cake. It's decadent!!!!"
Lika G.,"Wahiawā, HI",24,150,187,5.0,1/28/2017,I always love this place it's great food great atmosphere  all around goodness. If u don't mind waiting the line is long but worth it!! who can resist their deep fried mac and cheese. the best chiken picatta and the chicken marsala with garlic mashed potatoes. I also love the tamale  corn cakes very unique. I think its the sauce that makes it but its delish and unexpected
Mika L.,"Morgan Heights, Surrey, Canada",0,1,,4.0,8/24/2017,Huge portion. Love the luau salad. Would def try the cheesecakes sometimes. The calories were a lot to handle but food is everything !
Tishana G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,27,8,1.0,6/4/2017,"Updated Review:  My fiancé and I called ahead to make reservations for a group of 6. The lady that answered said they do not take rsvps and that in order to get a table, we would have to walk in. We arrived at about 5:30 and told the ladies at the front desk that we were having 6 people. She gave us a pager and said that we would be seated in about 30 minutes. We went to the bar to drink. Bryce was our bartender and the only good thing to come out of our dinner there. He was very chill and made our drinks to perfection (5 stars for Bryce). Our friends forgot their wallet in their car and left for 5 minutes to get it. (Their car was in the parking garage by Ross). The pager beeped and we went to get seated. The usher gave us a SUPER hard time about our table EVEN THOUGH OUR PARTY WAS THERE and told us we only could have a 5 minute wait window otherwise he would give up our table and we would have to wait on the list AGAIN. I told him nicely that they went to get their wallet and we still had 4 of the 6 there already. He still wouldn't sit us! Finally after a lot of going back and forth and he saw our party, he finally sat us and had an attitude about it. I asked him to get me a manager because I did not appreciate him being an a**hole to me or my party (manager never made it to our table).  Our server was ""interesting"". We waited about 20 minutes for our first round of drinks and water. Everytime we tried to order the next round of drinks, she would only take 2 orders and leave the table. My girlfriend and I waited over 30 minutes just to order another set of daiquiris! Same thing for the food order (she took half the party's order then left and took the rest). One of our friends waited 30 minutes after we got our appetizers and entrees before her food got to us. We ended up cutting the night short here and taking our business elsewhere due to the ridiculous wait times for things and customer service from their workers."
William S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,9,,5.0,9/1/2017,Visited for the first time ever a few days ago... Both the food and the service could not have been better.. The wait for a table was a little long but that is just evidence of how good this restaurant really is.. and over all the wait was worth it... We will definitely be going back and very soon.. A well deserved 5 stars.
Cassandra Y.,"Burbank, CA",5000,1338,8950,4.0,8/31/2015,"Located at Royal Hawaiian Center. Busy restaurant!  Nice outdoor patio seating area, perfect for people watching.  Food quality is as good as I remember. Huge portion, great for sharing!"
Esther S.,"Kapolei, HI",56,57,99,4.0,12/6/2016,"Oh how I've been craving some cheesecake. After talking about it for months since my husband has never eaten here and it's been years since I've eaten here. We finally put the talk into action and drove all the way into Waikiki. Not that it's hours of driving but when you live on Oahu anything not 10min away is a long drive...haha. Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. We failed to do our research and ended up in line at their prime time on a Sunday evening. The wait time was 45min. Normally, we wouldn't wait that long for a table, but we drove all this way for some cheesecake and we were not back out now. Upon check-in, you're given a pager. Luckily, there are several places in that area, so the wait time didn't seem too bad. We walked around the shopping center.  Next thing you know, we're being paged. So off we head to the front of the line, handed our pager over and was guided to wait on the side to wait for our someone to seat us. Once our name was called, we anxiously followed our hostess to our seat. How disappointing it was to be seated just behind the counter at the bar. It was loud and very dim. I'm not sure if the rest of the restaurant is as dim but it was dark enough that I had to hold the menu up close to read it. After waiting all that time, we opted to have our dessert first. I was pretty adamant about that because when we go out to eat we usually are so stuffed from our food that we end up passing on the dessert...well not this time. I had the white chocolate raspberry truffle and my husband had the Salted caramel. Both were delicious but I thoroughly enjoyed mine better. You can not go wrong with white chocolate and raspberry in my opinion. We then ordered the Kalua pork nachos...so yummy, so yummy! After skimming through the menu, I was so undecided on what I wanted to eat because there was so much to choose from. I decided to wait, since the nacho portion size was so big. My husband ordered the Hibachi steak. And it was very flavorful. I had a few bites of my hubbys plate and opted not to order a meal because I was stuffed. Of course we ordered a cheesecake to go, we went with the dutch apple caramel streusel. My husband swears he had his cheesecake fix. But I found my cheesecake the next day half eaten by him.  Overall, the food and cheesecake was awesome. We will definitely return, but I'll make sure to request seating outside of the bar area because it was hard to hold a conversation even though we were sitting right across the table from each other."
Rachel D.,"San Diego, CA",18,23,8,4.0,2/13/2017,"I don't know what it is about the cheesecake factory, but we like coming here and splurging every once in a while on a piece of cheesecake. The ladies at the front are always rude but we still insist on coming back here lol!  We don't come here for the food because we did have a bad experience once, so cheesecake it is. They also validate parking for Waikiki shopping plaza down the street, so that's a big plus.  The best cheesecakes we've had so far are the Turtle, the banana cream, the carrot, and Adams peanut butter chocolate.  YUM!"
Karyn M.,"Honolulu, HI",3,40,12,1.0,6/7/2017,"The hostesses are inefficient and rude.  We checked in and was told 45 minutes and requested inside the restaurant cause it was a hot and muggy day.  We were called 20 minutes later and was very pleased.  Only to be lead all the way in the back outside!  So we mentioned we asked to be inside cause it's hot outside.  She walked us all the way back to the front and was told nothing.  So we waited patiently...30 minutes later we decided to check, if we were forgotten.  She says because we didn't like our table we were put in the back of the que for another table so you'll have to wait.  WHAT?!!  If I didn't have my heart set on eating there and starving by now, I would have left!  They didn't even offer a free dessert or anything for our inconvenience.  I don't think I'll be going back.  There's lots of other good restaurants in Waikiki.  So disappointing!"
