Cj C.,"Kapolei, HI",278,6,1,4.0,2/4/2017,Besides the long wait the service and food was quit delightful. Music and environment was also a plus! You'll have to park across the street.
Viktor Y.,"Kapolei, HI",1,2,1,5.0,8/2/2017,"Been coming here for years now and they never disappoint. Service is top notch with the cuisine to match, always a good time here. Sometimes it's a bit of a wait for a table but what else do you expect for a place this great? Worth it every time!"
Rachel C.,"Long Island, NY",101,107,189,4.0,4/13/2016,"I've been coming here for a little over a year and generally speaking, I love this place.  Pros: Delicious food. I've tried many menu items here and loved them all. My favorite is the Chicken Madeira. Decent service. I can't recall any bad service incidents here. Nice non-alcoholic beverage menu (not just soft drinks, all sorts of fresh lemonades) as well as a solid alcohol selection. CHEESECAKE GALORE!  They'll validate your parking.  Outdoor seating available.  Cons: This place is packed around dinner time and we've experienced 90 minute waits. The upside is that if you snatch a seat at the bar or bar hightop tables, you can order dinner there and skip the wait.  Loud. Not the place for a super romantic dinner. This is the place to go if you already know the person you are with and don't really care to learn new things about them tonight. Crowds. If you aren't big on crowds, this isn't going to be the place for you.  Whether you decide to sit down for a meal here or not, do yourself a favor and pick up their Tuxedo Cheesecake to-go."
Kehaulani H.,"Kapolei, HI",263,35,45,5.0,7/22/2017,"Omg couldn't get enough of their food! All their dishes were on point... outstandingly good! Kids ordered 1 kids pizza, the biggest kids pizza we've ever seen (same sz as a dinner plate) & kids mac n cheese (cheesy & moist). Husband had the Steak Diane (sooo fricken good) & I had the gumbo (tons of flavor, the best Gumbo I ever had). It was perfect! Service was okay but our server dragged the entire time we were there and seemed like he was either exhausted, didn't like his job or maybe it was the end of his shift! Reason I still gave 5 stars is because all of our dishes were beyond good! And don't forget to try their Paradise In Pineapple (blended tropical cocktail in an actual pineapple) So good!"
Ashley R.,"Honolulu, HI",117,16,2,5.0,2/11/2017,Loves out sever.  He was a awesome help! Plus he reccomend the desserts we got which were to die for!
Sam H.,"New Orleans, LA",207,29,31,3.0,7/14/2017,"Food is fine, butter rich and fine. Nothing exciting, but we needed something quick and nearby on the way to the airport that would fill us up for the next sixteen hours as we had an eight hour overnight flight ahead of us. We sad inside which was a bit stuffy. As soon as we sat we told our server that we needed to be pretty quick since we had a flight to catch and the service was impeccable. The waitress checked with us regularly and made sure our food was on rush so everything came out quickly and efficiently. Seriously, the staff here is SUPER SUPER NICE!! Can't say I'd come back because I don't like eating at chain places when on vacation. However, if I had to and needed to, I would come back without hesitation."
Mel S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,,1.0,7/29/2017,"So disappointing! My food came AFTER my entire family FINISHED eating their food. The manager came over to apologize for the delay. The server apologized also. I would've been ok with that, UNTIL the person behind me got a free cheesecake when his meal was late!!!! What the heck?!?!? I was so disappointed in them! How could they give one customer something free and another NOTHING for the same issue?!?!? So, so disappointed in you Cheesecake Factory!!!!"
Thomas M.,"Waikīkī, Honolulu, HI",4,1,,3.0,8/13/2017,Service was extremely slow and server was clumsy by spilling a drink on the table.  Quality of food good.
Mae F.,"Honolulu, HI",126,71,521,4.0,5/25/2016,"This place is filled with tourists, which is not a problem, but it doesn't take reservations and sometimes the wait is not worth it.  We went for lunch today at 1:00 and didn't have to wait for a table, which immediately made us feel good about going there.  We've tried many things off the many paged menu, but we tend to order the sandwiches and salmon, yum.  I'd recommend coming here during off hours so you don't have to wait for a table.  We've never had room for their delicious cheesecake!"
Rachie P.,"Mililani, HI",44,160,388,2.0,5/4/2016,"I've only eaten in this restaurant twice and was thoroughly disappointed both times.  Once it was to use a gift certificate I had gotten as a gift.  We ordered our food and it was meh... then we were told that the whole amount needed to be used or we'd forfeit the balance and it wouldn't be counted toward tip... ok whatever  Second visit was with a group of family.  We were sitting on seperate tables between between a walkway, looking into the kitchen.  Boyfriend notices a bunch of weird things happening as the staff go in and out if the kitchen area.  Things you don't want to see employees doing as their serving food you're about to eat....  so we order and the waitress has trouble getting things down on a notepad.  Ok.  Our food comes out after whatever confusion she's dealing with and we're eating.  Again, food is meh.  To add to the already unpleasant evening, a worker decides he need to clean dust off a vent directly over us, WHILE WE ARE EATING!  Seriously?!  We probably have a million dust particles and god knows what in our dinner plates now.  So boyfriend asks ""do you really need to do that now?""  And his reply was ""uh, yeah"" and continues.  He mentions that we're trying to eat and he pretty much ignored us until he was done dusting the air vent.  THANKS.   Then when it comes time to pay, my mom has a bunch of gift cards and coupons for free cheesecakes that she mentions she wants to use.  Again, the waitress is confused or irritated/flustered about the situation.  Goodness, I've heard that it's actually hard to become a server or waitress at the cheesecake factory..  well the current employees aren't really representing if that's what ""elite waitstaff"" is supposed to be.  I feel like mcdonalds workers could do a better job if not just as bad.   The only thing I can give the cheesecake factory props for is the dang cheesecake.  If it weren't so far I'd have it more often.  Not to mention parking is a bit of a pain.  Most times the wait is annoying as well.."
David Y.,"San Francisco, CA",38,1,,1.0,7/22/2017,It's just embarrassing this customer service this is what happens when you don't need to run after your customers it's just a shame how it's another fast food restaurant and that don't care about their customers every time I come to pick up food there's always a problem!
LoReatha G.,"Honolulu, HI",55,17,17,1.0,11/11/2016,"Absolutely horrible service!!! Went out on a Friday night with a group of 12 (10 adults 2 kids). We knew it would be awhile to be seated so we waited an hour and half so we could all sit together. While we waited, we saw plenty of smaller tables open up but waited to sit together and the hostess kept reassuring us that we could sit together as well. When we were finally called to be seated, we were ushered to TWO BOOTHS that were back to back that sat 6 each. Really?!?!?! Why did we wait for an hour and a half while looking at various empty 6 tops??  But ok. We decided to grin and bear it and sat down. There was one kid at each table. We decided to order the kids meals first since we had waited quite a while and they were getting antsy. Those were placed and then my table ordered all the drinks and appetizers. We got our drinks and then decided to order our dinner. The table I sat at received 2 appetizers in about 20min. We did not care for the deep fried macaroni since it was burnt and wanted to send it back. So we waited and waited and waited for the waitress to come back. We she finally came back we decided to ask about the kids meal since it has yet to come out. She said she would find out, get us refills and then she disappeared again.  An hour and some change after we sat down we have no food, no drinks, no kids meal and burnt macaroni balls. We are all getting agitated because the little girl at my table was starting to get fussy as well. Waitress comes back, without refills and says she apologizes but they are waiting for my Filet Mignon to finish. I laughed because I ordered it medium rare and two people ordered salads. Waiting for it to cook? After this comment my friends were over it. The manager did not offer much condolence since he stated he could not locate our food or drinks. We asked for our checks, cashed out and left.  The funny part is, our partner table had FINISHED their meals by the time we got fed up and decided to leave. I will never visit Cheesecake Factory again. Shortening the menu will do wonders for your service. I must say, Wendy's on Nimitz offered a great baconator combo for the car ride home."
Myriellie W.,"Honolulu, HI",51,59,214,5.0,3/20/2016,"Fridate Night - appetizer: baked mac & cheese, entree for her: fried shrimp sandwich (new item), entree for him: fried chicken sandwich.. Cheesecakes to go: white chocolate Carmel macadamia nut and strawberry to go. Total $65 (no tip included)..  Came here at 9pm - parked at Sheraton for $12... Wait time was 35 minutes, we waited and watched people at the bar to leave so we can get there seats right away!! Yay for bar service!!  Place is always busy... But wait is worth it! Like many said, they don't take phone reservations - so prepare for the wait! Enjoy!"
Claude S.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,39,2,2.0,7/8/2017,"Below the typical Cheesecake Factory quality were used to.... Service was slow, my drink got taken and a refill never came until I asked. Our waiter knocked my glasses off the table, then swore and apologized...not professional. Glad we weren't with kids. Bread was rock hard, butter was frozen...we weren't happy with our entree and the server let us get another one but I was surprised the manager didn't stop over to make sure we were satisfied, as most other locations the manager is active. Food was good as always but this location needs some help to keep up with the Cheesecake Factory brand."
Loren W.,"Waialua, HI",46,29,,5.0,7/8/2017,"One of my favorite places to eat in Waikiki. Service is usually good, but can depend on how busy they are. My absolute favorite dish is the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. Love everything about it."
Suzy R.,"Kapolei, HI",1,37,2,4.0,7/7/2017,"The food is always good. They could turn the lights a little brighter and the service could be faster. I get they're busy, but it took forever to get our drinks and dessert....the server was nice though."
Sandy P.,"Honolulu, HI",25,9,6,4.0,2/8/2017,Went to this place twice during our trip. Good to see that their food and service is consistent. Servings are enormous! However the food is good!
Lisa M.,"Honolulu, HI",49,174,388,4.0,6/20/2015,"Big portions! Great cheesecake! Long wait?  Our family loves going here for dinner! We always go early so we don't have to endure the 30-45 minute typical wait for dinner. When I say early, I mean around 4:30-5pm.  We love the buffalo blasts!!! Crunchy crispy spicy chicken goodness!! We love the Romano crusted parmesan chicken,  shrimp with angel hair (love it!!!), chicken piccata- such a classic, chicken marsala, Caesar salad (small portion is huge!) and let's not forget the oh so perfect salmon salad!  The cheesecake is Devine!!! We have had the key lime, Godiva, strawberry, Oreo, and these do not disappoint! The food is always spot on delicious. Always has been and that's one of the reasons why we keep coming back. That and the customer service is normally great."
Sarah B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,26,13,5.0,12/22/2016,"Out of all cheesecake factories I've been to, this one had the BEST food holy cow. I don't remember the name of my dish, similar to a shrimp scampi but with a white wine sauce. I couldn't believe how tasty it was!!  Tip!!!! This place is jam packed. Look out for a high tops in the bar section. You can seat yourself! Just standby until a busser comes by to clean the table."
rachelle t.,"Kaneohe, HI",207,81,465,5.0,11/15/2016,"We had great customer service and the food was onolicious!!!!!  We ordered shrimp scampi, Baja chicken tacos and fresh strawberry  cheesecake we were very happy with our dinner!!!!"
