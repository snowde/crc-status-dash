Stefani C.,"Kaneohe, HI",15,73,5,2.0,10/2/2016,"We arrived at Cheesecake Factory today at about 10:15 a.m., shortly after opening.  We got seated quickly.  Our server's name was Eric H. We ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad, two Chicken Piccatas, Fried Chicken and Waffles Benedict and a Kids' Spaghetti w/Meatball. For beverages, we had the Arnold Palmer.   Let me first begin with no bread. The kids' Spaghetti arrived after 15 minutes. Then, another 20 minute wait came the entrees, but no salad.  We asked Eric H. for bread and about the salad.  He said that he thought we wanted the Chicken Piccatas instead of the Chinese Chicken Salad, but what he ""thought"" and what we said were not the same.   Service was very slow. Very Disappointing!  This was a terrible dining experience! Not how I remember the Cheesecake Factory Waikiki in the past.  We wanted to order Cheesecakes, but decided to order it on our way out at the counter display because we didn't want to wait another 20+ minutes.   The entrees were good, but the Arnold Palmers and Shirley Temples were terrible.  Much improvement is needed primarily with the service; beverages too."
Kainani K.,"Honolulu, HI",100,14,17,1.0,3/19/2017,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory with my husband tonight, and it was really busy as expected. The things that I didn't like was the fact that one person was writing times on a receipt for people to come back for pagers while the other worker was giving out pagers and taking people's information down. After waiting 20+ minutes, I noticed that a waiter walked toward the line of people who were waiting to put their name down, and pulled 2 women who hasn't put their name down yet and proceeded to seat them. I was upset because everyone else had to wait a long time and these two women were bypassing all of this. I brought it up to the women working the front desk and was told that busboys sometimes pulls people for the back bar when seats become available- this would've been believable if he didn't bypass other people to do so as well as bypass people that had already put their names down. One of the managers overheard me and offered to sit me immediately. However, shortly after ordering my food another manager comes to the table and says that they ran out of the dish I ordered- I was already irritated at the lies being told earlier so I just ordered something else. I ended up not liking my food and told the waiter but I was still charged for it. I just wanted to get out of there so I just paid for the bill.. I will not be going back there again."
Jane H.,"Portland, OR",2,32,99,1.0,12/18/2016,"Posted on Yelp 12/10/16 Saturday night. My friends & I decided to eat at this place the night before the Honolulu marathon. Our waitress was the WORST & the MANAGER was too!!! They were both ignorant, arrogant, & rude!!! 1. My friend & I decided to share our food, ordering a pizza & pasta. When she took our order, we told her that we wanted the BBQ pizza & the garlic noodles but with a creamy sauce instead. She said she wasn't sure if that can be done bc it will change the taste but I told her it was ok if it did. She tried to argue with me what I wanted so she said she'll ask the chef (she had an attitude at this time) When she came back, she brought out the manager (Marshall).  I explained to him that we liked what's included in the pasta (fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, oven-roasted tomatoes) but to change the sauce to creamy. He recommended the Pasta carbonara, I told him that yes I like the sauce but I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies. He said the veggies was not the problem for cost but for the sauce.  Sauce in Hawaii is expensive.  I repeated myself telling him that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies & he said ""yes"" 2. Free bread was brought out & of course we ate it leaving couple of the darker ones,so when she came around she saw that someone else already brought out the bread  so she skipped us.  I flagged her down & ask if we can get more bread.  She looked at me with an ugly, mean attitude 'like seriously, you wanted more bread look'.  Even my friends saw her look & was surprise. 3. Food came out, all was good. 4. Obviously we couldn't eat all of our pizza & pasta so I asked her if we could get some boxes & she said ""what??""  With an ugly, nasty attitude!!! Again, we all looked at each other & said what is her problem??!! 5. The Check came out - We were charged (not a surprise! )for the veggies that I specifically told the manager Marshall before placing my order that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies! She said it was the manager who rang our check. Low & behold, he came out telling me that ""this is a one time courtesy that he was not charging for the veggies"" I told him that I didn't want to pay extra for the veggies & he agreed not to charge me before I placed my order. He had the audacity to say that he didn't say that, he said that veggies are expensive.  What the HELL!!! He basically called me a liar!!! We were all stunned by what he said!  I told him that I will not be coming back & he basically said whatever & didn't give a $hit!! Seriously the worst service by the waitress & the manager by the name of Marshall!!!! I understand that they get a lot of tourist & they probably don't give a damn for all the tourist but please don't lie to the people who pays for your salary!!!!!"
Kevin M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,20,3,1.0,4/9/2017,The buzzer call remotes are very frustrating. Waiting out front for an hour after told 20 minute wait. We were told they buzzed us. So they said 5 minutes more. Still waiting after 30 minutes. Bummer birthday waiting in crowded lobby.
Oriadna J.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,11,9,5.0,1/4/2017,"Amazing!!  I love the menu and my favorite dessert is ""dulce de leche with caramel cheesecake"". The avocado toast is delicious!"
Chanel M.,"Mililani, HI",70,70,27,4.0,2/28/2016,I came last night and i love the food here. Super good. I had the four cheese pasta n thats delicious if you love cheese. I also had the caesar salad and a oreo cheesecake. Yummy! Just the cheesecake is very sweet though. So i dont recommend eating it you have diabetes or something.  The only downfall i have here is how they dont take reservations. I know its a busy restraunt but to me they should take reservations for big parties at least if they really dont want to except reservations. Since they dont take reservations our wait was 2.5 hours long. We didnt get seated till 9:50pm. I had a party of 18 of us and all of us was getting grouchy because we was all hungry and we had to wait that long. I find it ridiculous of how long the wait is.  There was also one more thing that happened that night. My boyfriend had ordered a filet mignon and we was wondering how come his food didnt come yet because all of ours did and they told him that they gave his food away  even more so i was like wth. But it was nice of them to offere him a soup or salad to wait cause they had to remake his food so even more long he had to wait to eat. Remember we was already waiting 2.5 hours and then he had to wait even longer for him to get his food. I felt bad for him cause he was really hungry and that happened.
Bronla W.,"Redding, CA",0,11,1,3.0,10/17/2017,"Having a nice meal a few days ago we returned expecting the same.   The service was mediocre, the waiter was slow to bring our drinks and forgot to bring lemons that were requested for the water, we had to ask twice.  When our meal was served they started to place my friends dinner in front of her and pulled it back having discovered it was not the steak she ordered.  A few minutes later the manager came by to apologize and told her it would be 15 minutes before a meal could be served as her steaks as given to someone else.  She chose to take the other steak that was supposed to be for someone else and was told she would be given a discount.  When the bill arrives there was no discount.  The manager told her that it was discounted because the steak served would have cost more.  When we complained it was still not what she ordered he was sarcastic and said he could have charged her more.  He must have realized how rude he was because he took her bill and when the waiter brought it back there was no charge.  We were very disappointed in the overall service on this day."
Divina V.,"Honolulu, HI",0,22,72,4.0,7/6/2016,"Food was delicious. Portions were huge for lunch. Went during about 2:30 pm and still had to wait for 20 min for a table. It's very dark in there that we had a hard time reading the menu.  My niece had the Italian Sausage with shrimp pasta which was pretty spicy, so she only ate 1/4 of it. I had the Shepard's Pie which was Ono. We also tried the Salted Caramel, Mango Key Lime and White Truffle Raspberry cheese cakes that were yummy Most of all, I really liked our waiter Jimmy, he was very attentive and very knowledgeable of the different choices on the menu."
Stacie C.,"Fayetteville, NC",28,35,139,4.0,4/2/2016,"Usually not a big chain restaurant goer but I have been wanting to try Cheesecake Factory for some time now. The wait times have always been too long any other time I have tried to visit this restaurant and I have tried in 5 other states. Typical wait times that I have run into are about 2 hours plus if you are trying to hit up dinner service. Today was an exception because we set out for an earlier meal. Waited about 45 min. Did not know if I could expect some Hawaiian influence on the menu seeing as how it is downtown Waikiki and I guess there was a fair amount considering the vast menu but I kinda expected a bit more local variety. Yes, it's a chain but given the location and the demographic there could be a little more thought put into local flavor, especially on the dessert side.  Kid friendly enough and price point was as expected given the location and type of establishment.  Our waitress Danielle was attentive and doing a great job despite being double sat and the level of business that was walking through the door. She answered all of our questions and handled our special requests flawlessly.  The staff seems to work together when it comes to service and food running and pre bussing which is much appreciated and let's things move at a good pace. Food was good. Exactly what I would expect as far as taste and quality from this type of restaurant."
Jim D.,Australia,0,93,174,4.0,8/7/2015,This place is literally more like a factory than a restaurant. With a menu containing over 250 items and as thick as War and Peace it would be almost impossible not to find something you like. The place is always packed with people waiting in line as bookings cannot be guaranteed.  The atmosphere is frantic - and the staff numbers required to serve all the patrons is staggering. But it all works like a Swiss watch. The variation of meals is amazing and even the appetisers are big enough. Be sure to leave room for one of their 50 choices for desert and cheesecakes.  Another amazing American food outlet.
Kim K.,"Wailuku, HI",39,28,95,4.0,11/8/2016,Love to eat in here but wait time is pretty  long on the weekends. So I like to eat dinner somewhere else and good to the takeout counter to take some cheesecake back to the hotel.
Puna S.,"Honolulu, HI",36,70,29,5.0,3/29/2017,Because I work nearby I frequently stop in here for lunch. Both dine in and take out. I have to say that the folks that work here are good at what they do. Big kudos to the gals that handle the take out orders. They are always so cordial and accommodating. Great job to everyone at the Cheesecake Factory Waikiki!!!
Kristine C.,"Honolulu, HI",899,440,8330,4.0,2/4/2016,"Not a day goes by that I don't see an overflowing amount of people waiting to get a seat at Hawai's only Cheesecake factory on the island. Call me lucky but, of all the times I've dined in, I've not had to wait for more than 20 minutes. Upon leaving your lovely name on the list with the hostess, you're given your nifty restaurant pager. Cheesecake factory sits on the right side of Kalakaua's busy street (next to Forever 21) on the first floor. You can't miss it.  Wooden furnishings and marble tiles give the vicinity a nice elegant touch with very light metalwork elements. On the right side of the entrance, people form a separate line for takeout and making ordering easy for slices of their famous cheesecakes. That is if you only want to want a pleasuring dessert on the go. The line goes fairly quick.  With an already large restaurant, Cheesecake Factory seems to have a fast turnaround with seating.  An inviting part of the restaurant is the bar with large screens for the sports fanatics. Seats line the bar as well as high top chairs as an option for dining in a more laid back scale. Their clean restrooms are readily available on the right if you break the seal too soon (if you know what I mean). Seats are available in family style and large parties. I very much enjoy their outdoor seating option as it gets freezing cold inside the restaurant. It's also very dim and not enough light on the inside. Why not dine outside and appreciate the alfresco with the fresh smell of the pacific ocean. My dining companion and I wanted to dine outdoors and we were seated after 10 minutes.  A server had stated she will be with us shortly. At this time we still have not received our waters or even any service for that matter. The restaurant wasn't at all busy yet. We were very forgiving and gave her another 5 minutes or so. After she returned repeatedly serving the table behind us it was already 15-20 minutes later. I upsettingly flagged the server on the opposite side asking for waters and for service. He immediately discovered my unruly tone and called for a manager. Slade (the general manager) approached us and immediately apologized for the lack of service and checked on us from time to time. Bobby (our new server) had apologized and served us wonderfully during the duration of our entire dining experience.   After enjoying their nicely toasted white and wheat bread with butter, I enjoyed their Garlic Noodles. This is a nice spaghetti dish with fresh asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, nice whole oven roasted cherry tomatoes with parmesan in a garlic sauce. This is beautifully served with a nice big part of the chicken (can be ordered with shrimp or chicken). I enjoyed this dish with all the vegetables and the chicken as my protein. The chicken is delightfully juicy and not greasy and the little part of the skin was crunchy after the first slice into the meat.   Overall, I very much enjoyed my recent experience here with a slight bump on the side. Their customer service is great with them recognizing the flaw right away. I've also enjoyed many of their cheesecakes in the past. With my cheesecake cravings, this is definitely my go to place. It's that simple."
Lia W.,"Honolulu, HI",14,40,38,1.0,9/7/2017,"It was around 3:52 pm on a Thursday afternoon. I had placed a phone order for three items and was told that it'd take around 15-20 min for pick up. The girl who took my order didn't bother reading back to me my order. And I thought it was strange. Then before I could ask her to do that she hung up on me. I thought they were busy so I gave them 25 minutes and when I showed up at the pick up counter, one item was missing. So the girl who helped me at the counter had told me she didn't take my order as she had just started her shift. I said no problem. How much longer for that one missing item? She said another 10 minutes but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for it. Then an older guy showed up. He was apologetic and offered to talk to the girl who took my order but he didn't offer to comp a dessert or anything for causing me inconvenience. They weren't even busy at all when I showed up. Total wait time 45 minutes for a phone order. On top of that, their validation on my parking ticket still costed me $6 to park for less than one hour in the Royal Hawaiian shopping center. If their food wasn't just okay, I would not have given them even 1 star for this review. The 1 star is for the food. The customer service here DEFINITELY needs a lot of work for an establishment who has been here for a while. Staff needs lots of training and the manager needs to be more sincere about the oversight by comping the customer WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TOLD TO DO SO. They need to make sure their validation stamp WORKS! The takeaway here is ALWAYS ASK them to repeat your orders back to you BEFORE they hang up on you and ASK THE MANAGER to comp a dessert or something for your time wasted. Because they don't know what they are doing."
Aaron Koichi C.,"Honolulu, HI",739,104,1243,4.0,7/21/2015,"All I have to say was the food was bomb!!!!!! Never disappointed with the food and service except for this night. Still receiving a 4 star though. Waiter was sort of moody and she needed to go home! Food tasted great and the runners worked really hard.  Ambiance is really dark and we need our phone lights to read the menu. After waiting for 2hours to just be seated, the food was worth it."
David N.,"Berkeley, CA",141,1012,883,3.0,2/10/2016,"Not a regular stop for me, but I had heard they served a few island dishes that were exclusive to Honolulu. A delightful server at the bar name, Erin, was helpful in me ordering Poke. It was not like the traditional poke, more like sashimi, layered on chips. The flavor was good, just not what I was expecting. I'll save The Cheesecake Factory for the Mainland."
Princess M.,"Honolulu, HI",120,34,24,3.0,5/29/2017,"The wait is long when you go for dinner and sometimes during lunch. Always ask for brown bread when they serve you the complementary bread, it's so good and not hard like the regular bread. But be careful not to eat too much because you'll end up like me and not eat all of your main dish . I always order some sort of pasta and they never seem to fail although I may say it's always too oily for me so (being a rude table guest) I get my plate and drain the oil onto another plate.. Don't forget dessert! Their cheesecakes are to die for!! The Oreo and I think it was the double fudge was just too sweet for me. I love the salted caramel cheesecake (best one on the menu) if your not looking for too sweet and just to hit the spot kind of dessert"
Mary-Jane A.,"Surrey, Canada",8,268,59,3.0,10/6/2016,Flew in late in the evening and did a quick walk before going to bed. Had my first Mai tai here to start my vacation. As it was late we had no problems getting in. Came in for the cheesecake. Staff were friendly and the place was still buzzing. They had a live band playing Hawaiian type music. Nice ambiance.
Kimberly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,61,34,4.0,5/3/2017,"Been to this location several times. Like all Cheesecake Factorys (Factories) I've been to the food is always delicious, drinks are tasty and the service pretty good. Once in a while you get a forgetful waiter but it's never been so bad that it warranted a bad review. At regular meal times they do get pretty busy so there might be a wait."
Brittany I.,"Aiea, HI",38,45,31,2.0,3/6/2016,"This was my first time to Cheesecake Factory on Oahu.. I haven't been since 2010 so clearly I was hyped and super excited to go. My friends and I went on a Sunday afternoon with our children and we were sat extremely quick! +2STARS. The hostess that seated us was so polite and very welcoming +1 STAR. She knew we had 4 kids with us so she put us in the round booth so it'd be easier to seat the kids.. +1 STAR for excellent customer service... So far. Our waitress came to take our drink order rather quickly +1STAR. I noticed she seemed a bit snooty but I was just so excited to be there I let it slide... She came back with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order we asked for a few minutes and she left.  Now when she came back we asked for her opinion on certain items and she was so cold and really seemed like she hated her job. Now being that we had our children there you'd think she crack a smile or something.. But NOTHING -2STARS. We get our meals, which are delicious, and we have to ask for water refills and everything she served came with an attitude -1STAR. It's extremely disappointing because the atmosphere and food is so amazing but ONE WAITRESS could and can bring that down. After having our drink slammed on the table and a rude server... I think next time I'll get take out."
