TJ M.,"Honolulu, HI",55,7,2,3.0,5/23/2017,"Fettuccine alfredo was too watery, filled with butter and seasoning mixture this made it hard to eat. My sons burger bun was soaked with grease and my wife's pot stickers was a undercooked noodle covered in soy sauce. Sooo yea but I have eaten here before and the cheese cake is always good."
Gabrielle C.,"Pearl City, HI",197,103,642,4.0,9/17/2016,"Of course, the wait will always be long here! But is it worth it? I believe so! The best part is that their buzzers you hold while you wait allows you to walk most of royal hawaiian shopping center! We came here on a friday night around 7:30pm and was quoted an one hour wait time which was exactly on the dot. Staff are always friendly every time I've came here. As soon as we sat down our waiter got us our drinks and was ready to take our orders for appetizers as we were already starving!! We ordered the crispy crab wonton and the spicy ahi fried roll (don't remember the exact name). Our appetizers cane out within 10 minutes nice, fresh, and hot. Very delicous! The crispy crap wontons just melted in your mouth after you bite through the wonton part of course and the spovy ahi fried rolls were not to spicy and tasty which came with a gyoza like dipping sauce. We also shared a Pineapple Paradise alcoholic drink where you literally drink from the pineapple. If you like a sweet, juicy, and not so strong alcoholic beverage this one is a must try. Since we wanted to save room for the cheese cake we shared the steak diane and chicken marsala (not marsala but something similar, sorry forgot the exact name again!) Combo which came with marinated in mushrooms and asparagus, and of course the garlic mash potatos. You can never go wrong ordering this combo. Price not so bad either at $23.90 for this dish. As for the cheesecake, i got the Oreo one and MY GOSH its heaven!!! Not to strong on the chocolate or the oreo, i felt it was a perfect balance not over powering the cheesecake itself. We stayed there for dinner for about 2 hours and noticed we had to keep waving down our waiter but couldnt blamed him based on how busy we saw the place was! If anything this was a 4.5 star rating based on this visit."
Kathryn O.,"Honolulu, HI",38,5,2,4.0,1/10/2017,"The wait is really long. Luckily I was patient enough to wait an hour and a half. If you are not into dark lit restaurant, be prepared to have your flashlights out. The service was awesome with great smiles. Personally I think the appetizers were way BETTER than the actual dishes. Cheesecake was okay. Overall my experience was okay. The only highlight was the customer service, great management."
Dan T.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,14,21,4.0,12/6/2016,"This is probably my favourite place for Cheesecake Factory. Yet, i have to say it was the first place that began my love for the American cuisine. The first time I dine here, I had the best waitress who connected with us and made the best recommendation to make our choice that much easier. Trust me, it gets really overwhelmed with their options. This location is also one that can't be beaten. Right in the heart of Waikiki and near the Sheraton hotel was so easy to get too. I recommend the dark bread with oats , the miso salmon with mashed potatoes instead of the rice which they glazed with sweet honey and the Louisiana chicken. Both were mouth watering and every time I'm back, it's hard for me to order anything else. Hope you enjoy it here!"
Addie L.,"Honolulu, HI",362,400,571,4.0,1/19/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is an American icon/classic that doesn't really need much explaining.  Expect mountains of food, be ready to take a doggy bag to take home and reasonable prices.  They have an expansive menu that someone can find something they would like.  Few tips: - If you plan to go for dinner, expect a wait for 30 minutes plus if you come past 5:00PM. - A better idea is for brunch/lunch, you can walk right in. - Parking is validated - A good idea to take your out of town guests, if they are picky and don't want to venture out or not ready for local food."
Sarena H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",13,38,76,5.0,4/15/2017,The food was delicious! Be prepared to wait in line approximately 30 minutes but the service and food made up for the wait.
Julie M.,"Waipahu, HI",1,8,,4.0,6/1/2017,"Went there around 5:45 with a party of 4, got seats instantly. We were anticipating waiting around for a while, but were very pleasantly surprised. Food was good, nothing spectacular, but we were very full and satisfied."
Matthew S.,"Honolulu, HI",61,13,59,4.0,12/19/2016,Very consistent for good quality of food across their various chains in America We have tried many items on their menu in different outlets and I cannot think of a bad choice  Very famous for their dessert Special shoutout for their fish tacos in Honolulu branch Pricing is approx USD 35 per person to fill you up Only thing I hate is the queue for lunch or dinner  Overall will definitely return to have another meal before leaving Honolulu
Kimberly C.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,6,,4.0,9/28/2017,"Every time we dine here, the service is always outstanding. The staff are exceptional and the food is always delicious and plentiful. The wait time is always less than what they estimate. Only thing that I didn't like was when we dined outside once in the open area, there were pidgeons walking around our tables and even stepped on my foot."
Danielle J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",201,37,9,5.0,5/4/2017,"I go to Cheesecake Factory all of the time, BUT this was the best one I've ever gone to!!! They are the busiest location, but the service was great!! And--they have live bands every night that are so good!!! We wanted something we knew we would love and not only did we get that food wise, we got it service wise as well. Mahalo"
Heather S.,"Waipahu, HI",171,541,1281,4.0,1/31/2016,"Cheesecake factory is the perfect place to go if you have no idea what type of food you're craving for. They have such a diverse menu, from american food to italian to thai to even some local dishes like loco moco. I've been going here since I was in high school, so that would mean over a course of 10 years. And, no matter what I ordered, food is always so delicious. Out of the many dishes I've tried, there are a number of them that I don't mind reordering again and again. These dishes include the portobello mushroom burger, pasta da vinci, sweet corn tamale cakes, bang-bang chicken and shrimp, and fried calamari. The tartar sauce and marinara sauce that comes with the fried calamari are by far my favorite compared to other restaurants.  For majority of my visits, we received pretty good service. Prices are reasonable as well. My only but biggest complaint would be the wait time, although I know that there's nothing they really can do about it. No matter what time you decide to go and no matter on what day you go it's always so busy."
Bayarea K.,"Berkeley, CA",0,488,,4.0,10/29/2016,"Pros:  huge portions, inexpensive, convenient        location, full bar,  Cons:  wait can be long at times"
Mary T.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,25,,3.0,6/7/2017,"Be prepared to wait an hour at least because this place is packed to the very top. The place is beautiful but when you go it's usually so full it's hard to appreciate. The waiters are average sometimes you get a good one, sometimes you get one that's alright. The food is made for someone who hasn't eaten all month, so you'll be taking home leftovers. It's noisey, not cheap, but a good experience.They are just so popular it's no wonder it's chaos."
Jacquelin S.,"Davis, CA",71,385,149,4.0,3/4/2017,"I embarrassed to admit that we ate at the Cheesecake Factory during our stay in Waikiki.  Husband wanted to go but seemed like every time we walked by there were huge long lines waiting to be seated.  We decided to have a relatively early dinner one evening.  At the desk we were told it was about a 10 minute wait at that time so we took a pager and checked out the menu.  About 10 minutes later the pager did go off so we went back to the desk where they took the pager and then had us wait behind the desk, I'd estimate another 5 to 10 minutes before we were seated.  Sly, break up the wait time.  We were wondering if this was the largest Cheesecake Factory as it seems immense so looked it up on Google.  That honor goes to the one in Dubai.  However, this one serves more meals than any other restaurant on the island.  I sure would like to see their kitchen turning out so many meals.  Once we ordered it didn't take too long for our food to arrive.  Hamburger or him, and it was huge and a chicken club sandwich for me.  Both meals were tasty and filling."
Caro L.,"Edmonton, Canada",46,7,1,3.0,9/21/2017,"Food was awesome and the portion size was pretty big. I'm giving this a 3 star because from the minute I asked for a table and the minute I left the restaurant was 3 hours !!! The lady said it'd be an hour wait, which was fine. We came back in an hour, got seated down. But the time we ordered and got our food it was another hour. Then we ate for half hour... then we asked for the bill which took half hour. So if you decide to go here make sure you have plenty of time."
Gary D.,"Honolulu, HI",86,49,483,5.0,10/6/2016,Another night in Waikiki and another one of our favorite stops on our eating tour. Man I gotta hit the gym tomorrow. Steph got tai lettuce wraps to start then she got spaghetti and meatball and myself the Shepard pie. We got here at 5pm and No line. Waited bout few minutes to be seated. Awesome!
Alma S.,"Baytown, TX",1,40,,3.0,9/20/2017,"Food was good but service was only so so. Our drinks (iced tea and diet coke) were never refilled, so we asked for to go cups and he came back with two of the tiniest cups I've ever seen as to go cups. Apparently tea and coke are at a premium with them, even though they charge $3.50 each!"
Pat H.,"Honolulu, HI",6,2,5,5.0,11/26/2016,The five stars are for our server Tyler.  I and my wife have never met a better server ever.  The cheesecake was also awesome.  What a view of the Christmas parade too.  The Hogans
Traci A.,"Honolulu, HI",124,65,40,3.0,3/13/2017,"The wait is always long, the restaurant is always so crowded and loud, but the food is good! We had a couple of drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated and the prices were outrageous one drink was $14. I ordered the combo with chicken tandoori & steak Diana loved the chicken but the steak was tough. My husband ordered the shrimp scampi with was crunchy but saucy it was pretty good!"
Elayne B.,"Honolulu, HI",125,29,35,3.0,8/4/2016,"Always a busy place. LOVE their cheesecakes and whipped cream, never fail me.  Because it's a busy place, lines can get messy.  We were in  the front of the line to get cheesecake, it started to get busy around us. An employee told us to form a line and we ended up at the end.  I told the employee we were there 1st but it didn't matter to her.  So we left. But in a matter of a little while kids really wanted cheesecake so we stood back in line. Employees need to be trained with more customer service skills.   We did bring it up to the manager and she was nice enough to acknowledge what had happened."
