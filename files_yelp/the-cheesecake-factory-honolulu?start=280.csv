JJ M.,"Honolulu, HI",9,10,,4.0,2/2/2017,"The line was hectic. My friends and I had to wait for an hour and forty minutes for dinner.  The spaghetti was really big. The raw salmon was super small, but expensive for that portion. The cheesecake was so so."
Roxanne Lynn T.,"Honolulu, HI",271,324,1568,4.0,2/3/2015,"The wait here is usually long but this review is based on the recent occasion that I experienced. We went about 1 p.m. and was seated within 10 minutes and since it was only 2 of us, I figured that's why we got seated fast.  We were seated all the way in the back by open windows which was pretty neat since I haven't sat there before. It was such a nice breeze from outside. Instead of ordering main dishes, we decided to just order from the appetizers. We got french fries, firecracker salmon and spicy ahi rolls. They were all pretty filling and good. Although it was pretty busy that day, the service was good. They have one of the best cheesecakes are definitely known for them hence the name of their restaurant. One of my favorites is the strawberry cheesecake."
Vince N.,"Maui County, HI",421,1467,5806,3.0,1/5/2015,"Sigh.  Here comes the truth.  After years of eating at TCF, I'm beginning to realize that while they make A LOT of food, and give enormous amounts, it's also not the best tasting, though a few dishes still rock my boat.  ATMOSPHERE: Busy and noisy.  This is the highest-grossing CF in the USA.  Seating capacity is big.  There's 2 outdoor lanais, big bar, and bakery counter.  FOOD: Caesar Salad - The appetizer portion was huge and big enough for two, comfortably for three to share.  Pretty to look at, but the dressing was too tangy for me.  CPK does a better job.  Fried Mac & Cheese - Anything deep fried is awesome right?  Big breaded balls of mac & cheese over a marinara sauce.  This is an app but is huge!  Make sure you can share or devour a lot. Ahi Carpaccio - Super thin ahi with a wasabi pesto drizzle (couldn't taste the wasabi which is awesome to me,) sliced avocado and a togarashi aioli for dipping.  Taste was great but the thin slices results in a plate looking like a fish autopsy after trying to pick out your portion. Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo - This is my ultimate favorite dish here.  I absolutely LOVE gumbo, and I love rice.  It's like a chunky soup, full of flavor with a kick.   Chicken Marsala - The chicken was tender and the mushrooms plentiful, but the sauce is way too sweet for me.  It comes with bow tie pasta.  I once substituted the bow ties for linguine - boy was that a big mistake.  They put nearly 1/2 pound of pasta on the plate with the same minuscule amount of sauce on the normal dish.   Chicken Madeira - This dish is better than the marsala IMO because it has more depth than the overly sweet marsala.  Comes with mashed potatoes.  Pasta Carbonara - The ratio of spaghettini pasta to sauce was 70% pasta, 30% sauce which resulted in a very bland dish.   Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - The linguine was al dente and the chicken and shrimp plentiful, but overall very underwhelming.  CPK does a way better version.  Salisbury Steak - Great flavor with a nice crunchy exterior.  Mashed potatoes were okay but could've used some flavor (or a more generous amount of gravy.)  To my local peeps, it's a hamburger steak but formed into the shape of a steak instead of round patties. Bistro Shrimp Pasta - I had high hopes for this 1,900 calorie dish.  What a disappointment!  The breading of the shrimp had the consistency of breakfast potatoes, and fell off the shrimp in chunks.  The shrimp had no flavor.  Not being not a fan of arugula, I couldn't taste them, thankfully.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and that was the only highlight. Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane Combo - After seeing pics of this, I had to try it.  I thought the scampi came with pasta underneath but didn't.  The 3 shrimp were deep fried and nicely seasoned in a tomato-onion drizzle.  The steak was tender and tasty, in a slightly sweet brown sauce and topped with a few mushrooms.  A wall of mashed potatoes separated the two down the middle.  Highly recommended.  DESSERT: Red Velvet Cheesecake - It looks awesome in the pic, but I didn't care for the taste of cheesecake together with red velvet cake.  I prefer them separate.  Strawberry Shortcake - Not too sweet which is great. Banana Cream Cheesecake - Bananas + cheesecake = OMG. Strawberry Cheesecake - Same as the banana verdict. Original Cheesecake - My boring favorite!  Super light and creamy.  Unbelievable! SERVICE: They do not take reservations.  Be prepared to wait up to 2 hours on weekend nights.  The staff are friendly, even in the most hectic of environments.  We recently had Darren F as a server.  What a super friendly, smiley, and professional guy!  Good deal! TIP: Avoid the crowds by coming for lunch or late night since they're open till midnight.  OVERALL: Generous portions, some subpar selections, weak pasta dishes, but they do have the best cheesecakes around."
Anna P.,"Pearl City, HI",6,77,11,4.0,9/4/2016,"It goes against my normal rules to eat at a chain in a city full of great local food but we did.   Our good was great, considering the book like menu I was surprised.  My son had a pepperoni pizza loved it.  We also has seafood pasta and pasta carbonara both were very good. And of course dessert, to go.  We had a piece of chocolate fudge cake and also cheesecake with peanut butter, pb cups, butterfingers.  Those were both worth the trip!"
Hope Y.,"Honolulu, HI",274,221,197,4.0,12/7/2015,"So this is the place to go when you have to please picky eaters. With 20+ pages on the menu, everyone is bound to find something they like. Hubs and I decided to go eat something yummy, and wound up here. Our wait time for lunch at 1pm on a Saturday was less than 5 minutes. They sat us in the front room, which looks out into the alley facing Nalu storage (surf board racks) and open seating on the lanai. Not bad, but definitely not meant to be a romantic seating space as it is 4 2-tops along a bench. Good thing we weren't there to be romantic! It was entertaining to watch the waitstaff dodge a particular bird who thought he owned the joint. He swooped in a couple of times, and then strutted up and down the aisle until he was shooed completely out the front.  Hubs had the fish and chips lunch and I went with the Cuban and a salad. The wait time for food was a little sluggish, but at least they were on point with my Big Island Ice Tea. We had some calamari, which had the perfect crunch to ring ratio, and that yummy garlic dip--we had to ask for more of that. Waited awhile for the bread which was supposed to be coming straight out of the oven, but it might've had a short delay because it wasn't piping hot, but it was warm. The fish and chips were crunchy and some sort of cod. My Cuban was HUGE! I could only eat half of it. And it was on-point. The yummy pickles added that special crunch.  Our waitress offered the cheesecake dessert specials, but there was no way we were going to finish any more food, so we ordered dessert to go; salted caramel for him, and white chocolate macadamia nut for me. We walked out of there happy campers with dessert for later. I always feel like a fatty cakes after a meal like this, but we don't do it very often so...why not?!"
Mark Z.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,3,2,5.0,6/6/2017,Went here tonight for my birthday dinner. Everything was great. Ask for Tyler as you server. He was very polite and helpful. Defiantly will come again
Chelsea L.,"Moncks Corner, SC",0,30,,3.0,5/23/2017,"At first we were told that the wait would be pretty bad, but we were seated as soon as we arrived (we did get there around 4:30pm). Our server was very nice and the wait for our food was not long at all. I had the tacos, unfortunately I can't remember specifically which ones, but they were okay. The cheesecake was the best part! I would love to go again and try them all (lol)."
May Jane T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",177,58,31,4.0,7/10/2016,"Came in with a party of six and the service and food was exceptional.  Pros: delicious food. Great staff (all helped eachother out) Our server was awesome at giving us suggestions & never kept us waiting.  Cons: No reservations. Expect to wait 30 minutes or more during rush hour. We waited for maybe an hour or more for a table. Dim lighting in the restaurant. Hardly any good lighting and it can feel a bit claustrophobic during rush hours.  Please try the avocado egg roll! It is so good and if you're new to their structure and Cheesecake Factory, park in the Royal Hawaiian parking structure that they are located in because they will validate your ticket! (I wish I knew this beforehand)  P.S Don't try the banana cream cheesecake if you're expecting it to taste creamy and sweet because it totally wasn't creamy nor sweet. It tasted more tart and almost tasted like a lemon key pie (very off putting) Overall, I would definitely come back again and I honestly think that waiting for an hour  to be seated was worth it."
Stephanie O.,"Honolulu, HI",36,39,97,3.0,10/28/2016,"My sweet boyfriend sat at the cheesecake bar since I wasn't there to be seated... waiting for me to finish up shopping at forever 21. I was craving a juicy burger and sweet potato fries earlier in the day. He surprised me with exactly what I wanted and an extra bonus... Caesar salad and a Maitai. All I can say  ""it hit the spot"". These dishes were delicious."
Shay K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,19,8,5.0,5/21/2017,"I am rating this 5 stars because of my experience at the back bar! Excellent service, bartender named Chris was so kind and professional! He suggested us having the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake... all I have to say is that it is my new favorite Cheesecake. Asked for vanilla ice cream of course on the side!"
Andrea B.,"Waikīkī, Honolulu, HI",14,9,7,4.0,5/20/2017,Cheesecake Factory is an iconic place. Great food. Long waiting line during peak hours.
Justine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,15,1,5.0,1/23/2017,Went to this cheesecake while we are on vacation and was provided such great customer service. Our waiter Sean I. Just went above and beyond to help satisfy our sweet tooth and welcomed us with his great sense of humor! Thank you!
Kevin B.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",7,21,,5.0,4/7/2017,"Always amazing! We had a tiny error with our order, but Stephanie the manager made it right and we will definitely be back for more food soon! Mahalo!"
Krystal T.,"Summerville, SC",1,33,1,3.0,5/16/2017,Best part was the cheesecake. I got the macaroni and cheese burger and was not too impressed. My burger was a little over cooked and dry. The fries were pretty good. I got the raspberry white chocolate cheese cake. It was SO good! They had so many cheese cakes to choose from! If you don't go for the food... you have to go for cheese cake
Caddie R.,"Hilo, HI",2,5,,4.0,5/14/2017,"Great customer service, the main course is okay, the cheesecake is huge and very tasty, definitely come back next time."
Diane F.,"North Augusta, SC",42,7,,4.0,4/1/2017,First our food was good. We had a pasta shrimp dish that was extraordinary. Our server seemed frazzled but it was a Friday night. It was extremely loud and dark. The lights went way down while we were eating. We joked we needed to use a flashlight.
Kat K.,"Brunswick, Australia",0,4,,5.0,9/9/2017,Ate here on several occasions. Food is great. Staff are amazing and so accommodating. Highly recommend
Laurinda Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,5.0,9/8/2017,"Definitely a must go. Compare to the Italian Arancino pasta place a few blocks away, Cheesecake Factory has so much better food and reasonable price. Love it."
Ginette A.,"Waikīkī, Honolulu, HI",0,10,,4.0,5/16/2017,"I can't tell you how many people recommended this restaurant to us, and we saved it for our last night. It was so delicious and super fast and super friendly service. Now,  they don't take bookings and they're very upfront with having extended wait times but this restaurant handles the crowd in the best way I have ever seen. We were told 40min wait for 2ppl on Mother's Day dinner (so you understand how busy it would've been!) and they were exact to that timing. Once we were in service was so fast, as well as all food orders. Very generous servings, so it feels worth it even though it's pricey. Really well-prepared food. I wish we went a couple of times to try a couple more items on the menu, and of course to try one or two more cheesecakes!"
Mr W.,"Honolulu, HI",1,1,2,5.0,4/10/2017,The service was great the food came no less than 5 minutes it was great my favorite food was the the chicken strips with fries and it took 2 min to get a table
