H M.,"Kahului, HI",0,4,,4.0,5/1/2017,"A big group of friends and I came here the other evening because we were in the area for a conference.  All the big restaurants down this way are always very busy, so we expected to wait.  Which we did!  We showed up around 5:30pm and ended up waiting about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  But we sat outside and chatted and browsed a few nearby stores, so no biggie!   This was smack in the middle of Spam Jam (a big celebration of Spam), so the whole area was PACKED!  So Cheesecake was an absolute madhouse of people by the time we were finally called in.  I mean swarms of people!  But you can't fault a restaurant for being popular!! Thankfully, we were brought to a table outside in the front of the restaurant.  Inside, it seemed dark and loud.  So we were very pleased to be seated outside.  Plus, we got to people-watch all the Spam Jammers! Even though the restaurant was BUSY, our waitress was a dream!  Her name is Lily (from Houston) and she was a total gem.  Not only was she super helpful and accommodating, she truly seemed to enjoy her job.  She didn't seem harried or overwhelmed and took her time with us.  Offering to do spilt checks for a large group and even encouraging us to let her know if we needing anything modified.  She said she was the ""Queen of Modifications""!  And she was true to her word. The food came out in good time and Lily was there to check on us right as the food arrived. Me and one of my friends ordered the Rib-Eye steak, and we both ordered it Medium Rare.  Lily asked us both to cut open our steaks to make sure they were cooked properly.  Mine was fine, but my friends looked more Medium than Medium Rare.  Lily took one look and said, ""No way!  I'm taking this right back and making it right.""  I kid you not, my friend had another Rib-Eye sat before her within 3 minutes.  And it was cooked perfectly!  Lily made sure. Then the manager showed up at our table (can't remember his name...started with an S) because he had heard about the steak.  He just wanted to make sure everything turned out ok and we were all enjoying.   Lily took care of us for almost 2 hours.  Every detail, down to recommending cheesecake to each of us according to our liking.   I could go on and on....she was the best! My whole table of 8 women couldn't stop raving about her and the food and the service.  Each of us enjoyed the food immensely.   I was so impressed with the quality of service/food/attention we got...period.  Not to mention the fact that the place stayed packed from the time we got there until we left. This was business done right and they deserve to know it.   If you go, and you can, request Lily.  Tell her the Maui Ladies said ""Hello""!"
Dave K.,"Honolulu County, HI",134,127,1241,2.0,2/7/2015,"First off obviously the wait here is out of control. But if you do just want a cheesecake you can go in and on the right side they have a smaller line for those; the cheesecake tastes great, the prices are high but it is occasionally worth it as a splurge. As for the food it is very good but considering the prices and the average 1 hour wait at least, I will not be going here very often at all... really like never basically... The service was okay, everyone was generally polite and nice but we did have to wait a little while for things like water. It seems as though the servers are good but perhaps have too many tables. It stays super busy.  Also they do validate parking I believe we park at the Sheraton and they validate it. Of course that is a decent walk away.  Overall I've been to many cheesecake factories and they generally are good. This one is no exception but the prices and wait make it not worth it. Those are my only gripes though."
Pearl Joy N.,"Honolulu, HI",209,30,33,3.0,8/21/2016,The wait is pretty long but it's been a while since me and my boyfriend have eaten here so we decided why not give it another try. It took us about an hour wait as we finally got in there was a crowd of people hovering the hostess area waiting to be seated I thought the point of have the buzzer was to avoid the crowed area at the hostess area. When you walk in it is very dark.  We started our meal with 2 appetizers the calamari and the tempura spicy ahi roll. The spicy ahi roll was DELICIOUS.  I would come back and get 2 orders of that.  As for our entree the boyfriend had the steak Diane with shrimp scampi and I had the steak Diane with herb crusted salmon. I don't know much about salmon but when I think salmon I think pink. But it was white and didn't really taste like salmon more of a mahi mahi taste. Idk it might have been just me. But the sauce the salmon was in had a strong lemon sour taste to it while the steak for my plate was tougher then my liking. The mashed potatoes were amazing super creamy and not chalky at all.  Over all experience it was okay probably will not be back for a couple years. The fried spicy ahi roll was the best part of our dinner and will probably be the reason I'll come back. It might have been the food that I ordered that made it and okay experience.
Lisa A.,"Honolulu, HI",6,39,41,1.0,6/1/2016,"We've been to this restaurant often even though the wait is long and it's in busy Waikiki.  But we've never experienced rudeness the way we did on 5/30/16.  Our waiter, Richard M was getting ready to mention the specials which were fish dishes and stopped himself to tell us they were out of the fish.  He came back to take our order which is our usual Miso Salmon off the regular menu and he repeated himself they were out of fish in an irritated tone.  It wasn't necessary for him to tell us that way because he wasn't clear earlier that ALL FISH, even from regular menu was out. He then brought our drinks and flinged the drink napkin to me.  I starred at him wanting to give him my reaction but I guess he didn't want any of that so avoided me. Then the whole night he was short and abrasive with us.  We were thinking must be a tip pool because he would get his share regardless how he treats his guests. We've never left less than 15% tip ever.  But there's always a first time!"
Kate T.,"Aiea, HI",485,397,276,5.0,6/12/2016,"My husband and I came here for date night. And I was really surprised at how efficient and fast the service was here.  We had our drinks and food and dessert to go within an hour. Which was surprising because the restaurant was completely full. We only had to wait 15 minutes for a table which was also surprising. I guess if you are a restaurant in Waikiki you have to be ready for a high volume of people. The food was great, cheesecake was amazing and the service was mind blowing. I guess it's what you expect from a restaurant in Waikiki/Cheesecake factory."
Chezlani-Crystal L.,"Mo'ili'ili, Honolulu, HI",567,2,11,5.0,2/21/2017,"Friendly service, awesome food quality for the price. Amazing ambiance. Live music every night from 8-closing."
Darrell K.,"Seal Beach, CA",507,1662,2605,2.0,10/15/2015,"The CF is one of my favorite chains.  Having said that, why would you fly all the way to Hawaii and eat at one?  Don't.  There are so many local eats that shouldn't be missed.  I came here around midnight for coffee and desserts.  That should be your only excuse.  I rated this lower than other CF because the hostess was ridiculous.  She gave us one of those buzzer things, which is good.  Then she buzzed us, which is good.  Then she told us to wait in a spot where she told a million other customers to wait.  Then she yelled as us for blocking the narrow hallway.  That was lame.  The manager needs to manage otherwise this silly hostess will continue to an bozo."
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,5.0,9/7/2015,"My parents and I recently went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner and we encountered the best service yet, in addition to probably our speediest dining experience here ever. Our server--I think his name was Mark--was stellar. Of course, we were there for Sunday for dinner around 5 p.m. and the restaurant was bustling, but he never skipped a beat. He always made sure that our water glasses were full, he packed our bread in a separate to-go container (without us even asking for one), he asked if we wanted our entrees to-go in a timely manner and he was just overall really attentive. He had lots of other parties to wait on, but I was thoroughly impressed by his service.  I also wasn't expecting to get seated so quickly--even though we had a small party--but I think we only had to wait for 5-10 minutes. That was record timing! My parents never deviate too much from our Cheesecake Factory favorites, but everything tasted even better that night because of the great service. Here's what we got: ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"": This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.This dish can be found under the ""Appetizers"" portion of the menu. It's great for sharing if your tablemates love mac and cheese ... or, if you're like me, it's perfect as an entrée because it's just that good.  ""Chicken Madeira"": This chicken dish is famous as the eatery's ""most popular chicken dish."" Flavorful and savory, this one is definitely a winner. The dish contains a couple pieces of tender, sautéed chicken breast topped generously with melted Mozzarella cheese and pieces of asparagus. It's also covered with flavorful mushroom Madeira sauce and is served with fluffy mashed potatoes. Both of my parents usually get this dish; they like it so much that they never want to try anything else! My mom really likes the savory mashed potatoes, and both of my parents enjoy how much cheese and mushrooms top the tender chicken breast.  ""Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple"": This decadent dessert features the original cheesecake in an Oreo Cookie crust and includes caramel, chunks of Butterfingers and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and peanut butter throughout. My dad always orders this cheesecake, and I always benefit because I can bank on having a bite--or two--while ordering my own cheesecake. Although I've tried several of the different ones on the menu, ""Adam's"" still reigns as one of my favorites. In fact, sometimes both dad AND I order the exact same thing for dessert. He always gets his with coffee, though, since it's really, really sweet. I usually eat mine straight up, and my favorite part is the dollop of creamy peanut butter on top. ""OREO Dream Extreme Cheesecake"": Though I prefer the original version of this cheesecake (and want it to return), I was glad to try this slight rendition. This cheesecake differs from the original OREO one because it includes a layer of moist fudge cake and OREO cookie mousse atop the cheesecake. It's similar to the original in that it has OREO cookies baked into the creamy layer of cheesecake and is topped with a milk chocolate icing. I had mixed feelings about this cheesecake and preferred the original just because I was not a huge fan of the mousse layer (I don't like mousse in general ... nothing against this cheesecake). But, I really liked the layer of moist, fudgy chocolate cake interspersed with the layer of cheesecake (similar to my favorite ""Reese's Peanut Butter"" cheesecake), and the OREO cookie chunks baked into the cheesecake itself is probably my favorite component of the entire dessert. If the mousse layer were eliminated, I would have no problem with this cheesecake being on the menu instead of the original OREO creation. It took some guts for me to deviate from my usual ""Adam's"" or ""Reese's"" cheesecake, but in the end, I was glad that I tried something different.  ""Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake"": My mom decided to get something different in terms of dessert and opted for this Hershey's cheesecake. It's one that we both always wanted to try, but never took a chance on because we always get the same thing. This chocolaty creation features Hershey's cheesecake between moist chocolate cake and comes topped with creamy chocolate frosting and chocolate chips. A true delight for the pure chocoholic! I think I ended up liking this cheesecake more than my mom, who said it was a bit too chocolaty for her. I liked the fact that the cheesecake and chocolate cake were interspersed, so it actually cut down on the sweetness. My mom thought it would have been more effective if the original cheesecake layer was used in between layers of the chocolate cake, and Hershey's bar chunks were inc"
Kelly W.,"Atascadero, CA",78,12,1,4.0,4/13/2017,Had a great time and the staff was very nice and cheerful. Jeffrey was our waiter and he was knowledgeable and fun!
Katy P.,"Ewa Beach, HI",12,119,157,5.0,7/14/2016,Love their selection of cheesecakes. There are so many delicious choices it's hard to eat just one. I personally love their lemon meringue cheesecake.
Kat O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,9,9,2.0,9/2/2016,"BUG BITES!!!  My husband and I had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory 3 days ago and we sat inside.  Near the ending of our dinner, I started to feel itchy on the back of my thighs.  I was wearing shorts and thought maybe the material of the chair was making me itchy.  The lightning was very poor so I couldn't really see very well.  I didn't think too much of it but when I got home, my legs were feeling really itchy and when I took a look in the mirror, to my horror, I had a bunch of bug bites all over the back of my thighs and knees! You could see a whole roll of bites along where my thighs came in contact with the chair. I'm very sad because I like the food there but unfortunately, they need to work on exterminating and disinfecting/sanitizing their furniture."
Jenny L.,"Honolulu, HI",100,90,155,4.0,1/9/2016,I've been to this restaurant countless of times and every single time the food was worth the wait. It's portions are pretty big and there's a lot of dining area to seat a lot of people. Servers and staff are friendly and very nice. They greet you and thank you for coming when you walk pass them. The only thing is that it was my first time seated outside and I didn't think it was sanitary. Yes it looked really nice and neat but as I was eating... The birds kept flying over our heads and constantly popping on the floor. It was the floor so it's not too bad but what if they flew over someone or their entree and pooped over that? If come back here hands down but I'll avoid the outside seating area now.
Meg B.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,6,,4.0,4/10/2017,"Cheesecake would get a five from me if there wasn't always such a long wait. I get it, it's Waikiki, but I wish they could take reservations. The food is always excellent here, regardless of the wait time, I always keep coming back! I haven't ordered a dish I didn't like here. The cheesecake is delicious too of course. They will validate your parking - that's always a plus!"
Rona S.,"Kaneohe, HI",104,17,2,4.0,4/9/2017,I've never eaten in however the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic is delicious! It's rich in flavor. I just wish they took reservations and had more restaurants besides Waikiki location.
Shayla W.,"Honolulu, HI",635,186,1077,3.0,10/14/2015,"Let's make this quick: Since the beginning I've been coming here for dinners when in Waikiki. The food was good especially their pasta but now I'm not sure what to think of it anymore. Prices have raised and portions are much smaller. The lines are terrible! The wait is always 1-2 hours long! -.-"" To be honest.... just take out the cheesecake. The line for takeout goes by fast so don't worry!"
Janelle M.,"Honolulu, HI",4,36,57,5.0,8/28/2016,"Last night our whole family went to dinner...we didnt have to wait long...we were lucky to just beat the dinner rush! They give you a buzzer to hold on to for when your table is ready...we waited no more than 10 min. Customer service was excellent. I ordered shrimp scampi/salmon combo..my oldest son ordered s salad, which was huge! Everything each of us ordered was delicious! No complaints!! Our server ...i think his name was ""Rodrigo""?? ...was attentive, friendly, helpful with our menu, kept us up to date with our food...our table was constantly kept clean of empty dishes, which was great!"
Diana P.,"San Diego, CA",333,360,1462,3.0,12/20/2014,I hate chain restaurants but hubby picked it as he was tired of Asian food. Sat outside and people watched which is great fun. Food is the usual cheesecake factory food. A bible for a menu and huge portions. Two appetizers of avocado egg rolls and sweet tamale cakes. Lettuce cups for me. Service was great.  Local girl asked where we were from and chatted with us for a bit. Go early before 530 or wait in line for 45 minutes or more.
Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",624,1458,1938,2.0,7/24/2014,"Yeahhhh people are crazy to wait in the consistently long lines at Cheesecake Factory. I don't understand why it's so popular. You're literally feet away from one of the world's most famous beaches, yet Cheesecake Factory doesn't even have an ocean view. They offer mediocre American food at high prices. If you want to pay this much for food, you should at least go somewhere with a view. Maybe the kitchen fire a couple years ago made this some kind of weird special attraction. No, that can't be it. Obviously these people don't use yelp to find better restaurants in waikiki (I know, it can be hard).  Ok, I get that their cheesecake is good. That's pretty much where I draw the line though. I wouldn't come back for anything but the cheesecake. And even when I do come back to pick up cheesecake, there's always a line at the counter and the cashiers are rude.  This place will always be busy (unless they try to burn down the building again) because they're so centrally located in waikiki and people passing by just can't help themselves. When you've flown thousands of miles to paradise, why don't wouldn't you want to try local food?"
Em M.,"Melbourne, Australia",29,17,9,5.0,3/9/2017,"Consistently delivers high quality food at a great price. It's the only place in the USA that I eat burgers, and they're fab! Leave early as you'll have to wait for a table, particularly around dinner time. The only issue we had was the extreme air conditioning in the place, so if you get outside or down the back - you'll be least affected."
Kayla C.,"Lihue, HI",185,9,10,3.0,12/8/2016,"Honestly, The Cheesecake Factory was one of my all time favorite restaurants, but suddenly my experience there was absolutely different from all of the amazing nights I've had.  Although, this restaurant does not take any reservations, we've waited for 2 hours to get a table, which is normal if you wanna eat there. I told myself ""the wait will be worth it"", since they've never failed me. Perhaps, I spoke too soon. Our hostess was very polite and casually spoke to me about her favorite dishes on the menu and recommended me her favorite ""Chicken Madeira""-chicken breast, topped with mushrooms, asparagus, Madeira sauce, mozzarella cheese, side of mash potatoes. A pretty big size! So I figure I try it! They first give you bread and butter to start with, which is always my favorite! Cocktails are always tasty there! Bartenders are really good! Our appetizers were awesome, except we ordered the soup of the day- ""baked potato soup"". At first, our server said that they ran out, they she came back to let us know the kitchen was making a brand new batch so we stuck with the order. Soup came, and it was watery and didn't care for it anymore. It wasn't really a big deal for us, and didn't expect the manager to come by to apologize and offered us a free cheesecake which was really nice of them. My entree came in first, and wondered why the other dish hasn't come in at the same time. Server mentioned that the pasta was given to a different table and making a new one. So the manager came by again to apologize so the delay. As we began to eat, I looked at our food and it looked so good and smelled really good as well! I've eaten a quarter of my meal until I notice a hair on my food. I didn't realize that until I started cutting more of my chicken, and I was pretty upset and, yet, I was pretty hungry. I've told the server about the issue and told the manager. I ended up eating the pasta to share and didn't want to order a new entree. Manager was apologetic again, and I've never experienced this at the restaurant ever, so it really brought me by surprise.  I truly must say, our server was very understandable and she was really nice and apologetic of our experience. I've given this restaurant a 3 star because I feel that although our service was meaningful, the food and the duration wasn't at its best during the time.  Overall experience, parking will be difficult to find, since you need to find a good parking rate and walk to Cheesecake Factory. They do not take reservations, it's a walk-in restaurant that will make you wait 1.5-2hrs. Service by the servers were good, hostess service was good, management team is good. We were just disappointed of the experience after being loyal customers to this restaurant for many years. I'd still recommend this restaurant, but I'd hope on our next visit, it'd be better."
