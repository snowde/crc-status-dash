Glenn A.,"Los Angeles, CA",725,468,3062,4.0,8/12/2015,"We ate here during our stay in Waikiki. It is one of the largest Cheesecake factory I have visited. It has the twice the number of seating compared to your traditional Cheesecake Factory locations. It is located in the Royal Hawaiian shopping center.  The restaurant gets very busy at night with all of tourists. You can expect to wait well over an hour before you are seated. Luckily, they provide you a pager so you can shop at the nearby shops while waiting for your table."
Nakita C.,"Honolulu, HI",621,132,182,5.0,11/9/2015,"This has been our family's go to and favorite restaurant for years (we think we started coming in 2004 but maybe 2005)! We used to come about once a month but now with both my brother and I being adults, it's hard to get a family dinner together. We probably come every 3 months and sometimes we're missing a person (usually me) but the missing person gets their order taken home to be enjoyed for second sessions.  We usually come around 3 to avoid waiting for a long time and we like to sit in the 80s because of the beautiful view. We usually sit at table 85.  Coming here is like lunch/dinner and lunch tomorrow! Our usual course of action is bread but we ask for no white and double brown bread, 2 orders of the tempura spicy ahi roll, and the chicken lettuce wraps. A lemon drop for my mom, a Long Island for my brother, and my dad picks something new every few visits-yesterday he got the bourbon and honey which he said was smooth and delicious!  Now let's talk about those apps-if you are a family of 4, you can not order one roll. You will fight over those pieces. It's better for everyone to just order two and let everyone get enough pieces to be happy. After you're done, the brown bread dipped into the sauce is THE BESSSSTTT! The lettuce wraps are my mom's favorite, she sometimes orders them for her entree she enjoys them that much. They come with 3 sauces that are all delicious and I like to put all 3 into my lettuce wrap.  Entrees: My dad almost always orders the jambalaya/gumbo (I've included a picture). I don't remember which title it has because my food is so delicious I don't pay super close attention but he always gets the same thing so it must be awesome.  My mom usually gets fish tacos which I always want a bite of but never do because I'm so full by the time she offers.  My brother and I switch around a lot. He usually gets steak and I used to order chicken. Our favorites are the chicken costoletta, the chicken Madeira, and the chicken Marsala. But seriously if you haven't had chicken costoletta-you should 100% order that.  I gave up being vegetarian yesterday because it was such a tease not eating chicken costoletta so I ordered the herb crusted salmon yesterday which was also delicious and served very similarly to the chicken costoletta. Our family always orders dinner sized entrees because we take home half or more and have it for second sessions around 7:30 or for lunch the next day.  Dessert: Our normal route is to order 1 for the table so we can all have a couple bites and then one each to take home.  The one for the table is usually something new or the seasonal cheesecake. My dad always orders the Godiva, my brother always orders the kahlua and I used to always order the Adams peanut butter fudge ripple but now I take after my mom and try a new one each time. I have to say it's rare we order one we don't like. They're all very good. Yesterday my mom ordered the tiramisu for her take home which is one of my favorites and I got the s'mores cheesecake which was super delish! We saved our leftovers for lunch today and busted out our cheesecakes last night and each only ate half so we're super excited to have leftovers AND half a slice of cheesecake in our lunches today.  So yes, Cheesecake Factory is a chain. However, they provide consistent, delicious food with fantastic customer service."
Maria W.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,16,,1.0,2/14/2017,"Aloha, I want to start off by saying I've never had a bad experience until tonight. 1- waitress not good- Ellen 2-manager in duty-2/03/2017 tonight horrible.   I ordered a classic burger medium rare with cheddar cheese. The order cano out wrong no cheese, I asked Ellen to have the kitchen make a fresh one. Ellen came out with the same burger and slapped some cheese on it. The manage tell me that this burger is still medium rare even after they melted the cheese. I asked him to make me a new burger, he said a medium rare burger would take 15 minutes and he suggested I just eat the burger I ordered that was wrong. FYI a medium rare burger is no more than 8 minutes at the most. I didn't even get comped just dismissed.  I will never eat at Cheesecake Factory again and I will never bring my guest here from the mainland or anywhere.  Horrible, Horrible, Horrible, service and this manager needs to be fired. He didn't give a shit about the my satisfaction as a paying customer!!!"
Gwen V.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,18,12,4.0,9/24/2016,"Delicious food, just the wait is the negative part. The service however was excellent! Eric was the bomb!!!"
Trisha Trang T.,"Honolulu, HI",137,3,,4.0,3/2/2017,This is one of my favorite restaurant on the strip of Waikiki. Their chicken Madeira and the habachi steak was amazing!!!! Everything was great except for the wait
Terry K.,"Stockton, CA",0,310,8,3.0,2/12/2017,"Pal-ing around with a Japanese tourist from my hostel, we ended up here because he wanted ""American"" food. Being on vacation, I was skipping everything that I could find on the mainland. But this is where we ended up. Mid-week, around 8PM, is when we stopped in this place. There was about a 10 minute line just to put our names on a waiting list! Our estimated seating time was an additional 55 minutes. Yeah, mid-week, this place was packed! So we walked up and down the street a bit going in and out of various stores ""just looking."" We were seated right about the 55 min mark. I started off with a Mai Tai (with upgraded alcohol)...which was good! I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp. It too was pretty good. Now being in Hawaii, I expected the prices to be higher than normal...and they were. But here the prices were not increased as much as some other places...at least for the food. Alcohol...well, that's always a roll of the nice at any ""hot spot"" regardless of whether you are on vacation or not. So two for dinner with just a couple of drinks plus tip...about $80. So for me, this place was just like the CCFs back home...so just average in my book."
Justin C.,"Honolulu, HI",96,16,68,4.0,9/22/2016,This place would be 5 stars but the wait and prices are actually extreme even for Waikiki
Chris L.,"Mililani, HI",66,161,190,5.0,7/14/2015,"There are very few places where you can get there at just after 5pm and already have a 50 minute wait, there are fewer places where I would say ""yes"" to a 50 minute wait and where the reaction to a 50 minute wait is ""Oh, that's not bad."" and there is only one place that I know of on the island where the hostess will tell a party leader that the wait is now 3 hours and they'll still happily accept it. That place is ""The Cheesecake Factory""  The Cheesecake Factory has been a destination for my family for years now, I used to have them take me here on my birthday. Now days though we seldom get the chance to go because of distance and parking and the nighttime craziness that is Waikiki in general, anywho lets break this down into categories again.  Hostess/Front desk  I'm giving this its own category in this review simply because of how much time you are likely to spend here. The wait times I've witnessed have been anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours depending on the time and day. If you really want to try and avoid the wait you need to come in the 3-5pm hours and even then you'll likely be handed a 20-50 minute wait anyway.  The people at the front desk do their best to accommodate everyone but please, please keep in mind that these people get swamped all at once by people who speak a variety of languages, there are only 3 to 5 people at that desk for hundreds of people trying to check in, check out, validate parking ect. They will be sluggish occasionally but yelling at them about it will only make their day worse and the wait longer for everyone else so PLEASE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT while you are waiting so everyone can run through as quickly as possible.  If you get to the Cheesecake Factory too late you might be faced with a line, this line will exit the restaurant and nearly hit the street, in my experience at this point your wait will likely be over an hour.  They will occasionally run out of pagers too.  One final thing is that due to how many people there are you can help the line a lot by only sending up one person from your party to wait in line, seriously, like you have no idea how much of a difference that will make with people trying to exit the restaurant with strollers and such.  Interior and Cleanliness I tend to trust restaurants that allow you to see inside their kitchen, they aren't afraid of showing you what they are doing because they know they have nothing to hide.  On the inside you have a very sophisticated feeling space, it's dimly lit with ""marble"" table tops and rich woods, very well maintained especially considering the amount of people through the space in any given hour.  Service The service here is great, we only had one issue where our server very clearly and specifically asked if my father wanted his soup before or with the main courses and my father very clearly and specifically said he wanted it before hand. The server then said he would get it right away and left.  We didn't get it until the main courses came at which point my father sent it back because it was too much food at once, which was a shame, that soup smelled really good.  Food With the amount of food delivered to our table I only tried 3 items personally and I only remember the names of 2 of them.  The Bacon-bacon Burger (Pictured) : Well cooked with a very nice toasted bun, crossed with bacon and served with the lettuce and such on the side so you can choose if you want it or not. It was spot on, solid 5 star dish  The everything Pizza (Not Pictured): The dough on their Pizzas is really flavorful and the fresh ingredients pop. The meats had a smokey flavoring to it that was just amazing, complemented nicely by the cheese.  Crab. . .something. . .crispy Won-tons (Pictured): Yeah, this is the one that I forgot the name for, but these are great. The crab is so creamy and the sauce works well to complete the taste.  All in all due to the experiences we've had over the years I will give The Cheesecake Factory 5 stars despite the issue with the soup, my reason for this is because since we've been coming here that has been the only issue we've had."
Monica L.,"Honolulu, HI",129,32,19,3.0,8/21/2015,"Came here yesterday with the boyfriend for our anniversary. He's never been here before so I thought it would be nice. When we got there, there was not much people waiting in line to get a table like usual. Finding where to book our tables was so confusing. There is people everywhere and lines everywhere so how do you know which one to stand in? I ended up making eye contact with a girl and she helped me. The wait was still one hour...like usual. So we had to come back 40 minutes later for our buzzer thing. We walked around to the Apple Store and forever 21 just to look around while we wait. Then we stood outside...horrible experience. This couple decided to stop and smoke right in front of us. I have asthma...so it was rude!  At 740, we went back and there was a line..so I stood for a little bit because I didn't know where to go...then I saw people going up to the same girl and getting their buzzers. So I went up there. The place is so cramped..people walking everywhere and bumping into you. It was really annoying. I hated how people came in groups just to order cheesecake. Can't you wait outside while your friend or your spouse gets the cheesecake?  Our buzzer buzzed exactly 20 minutes which made an hour wait. So I went over to the girl again and pushed my way through the crowd. Gave her my buzzer and waited again to be seated. Maybe 10 minutes later, we got our seats...it was out in the HUMID air. Ugh...I hate it. The girl was nice, she gave us time to get situated and look at the menu. Got our waters and bread. The bread was cold..I like when it's warm, but oh well. I got the Chicken Di Pana and boyfriend got the Smokehouse BBQ burger. Our food came out together maybe 10 minutes later? Boyfriends burger came undercooked. He wanted medium but got medium rare. My chicken was good. Wish there was more sauce though...and more broccoli!!  Overall the experience was good. Just be prepared for the wait...and the annoying people who don't know where to walk or stand."
Caroline N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",49,60,4,5.0,7/30/2016,"We came when it was 50% off cheesecakes on national cheesecake day july 29 and july 30. :)  We got the Paradise in a Pineapple, which was beautifully and creatively presented and also delicious. In it, is Captain Morgan, Sailor Jerry, and Myer's Rum blended with tropical juices served in a whole fresh Hawaiian pineapple. Definitely recommend for $15. Also, took advantage of cheesecake day and got a mango key lime cheesecake. I'm not sure if this was true for all the cheesecakes in Hawaii but the graham cracker crust on our cheesecake was laced with yummy shredded coconut.  Stop by for a refreshing treat after enjoying Waikiki Beach! Sit at the bar to save time if you are just coming in for a snack!"
Craig H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",159,165,197,4.0,4/12/2016,"For cheesecake this is a 10 Star Joint!!  For Food this place is above average but below great! My favorite Appetizers are the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Fried Macaroni and Cheese.  For sandwiches my favorite is the Grilled chicken Avocado Club.  For brunch the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich is delicious.   I personally like their breakfast, lunch, and appetizers more than most of their dinners.  When coming here use the menu to your advantage remember this is not an Italian restaurant or steak house this is an American chain restaurant so order accordingly. Obviously it's impossible to go wrong with their cheesecakes whether it's their original or any of their specialty cheesecakes!  Order the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake or the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake they are both heavenly. This Waikiki so yea if it's a Wednesday-Sunday you will be waiting and possibly up to two hours."
Tina L.,"Richmond, Canada",0,38,38,5.0,2/27/2016,"Other then long waits unless you are an early bird eater this place is the best. I mean what's not to love. Ginormous meals, delicious cheesecakes and bread mmmmm always ask for two honey wheat, who needs the sour dough.  I have yet to have a bad meal or service experience here. All I ask is that Cheesecake Factory open a location closer to my house lol"
Hoku F.,"Honolulu, HI",42,39,271,1.0,6/7/2016,"I never ever complained about the food here because its always really good. First off our complementary bread was burnt and tasted nasty! I ordered my usual shrimp & Chicken Gumbo, buffalo blasts and calamari it was over the top SALTY! Not to mention the brown rice they put on my gumbo and friends food was hard like little pebble rocks. I also found fried chicken tenders in my calamari. Now that was ridiculous, like did yall run out of calamari??? I have never been served such salty, burnt and hard food like that before. It was terrible! Whats going on cheesecake factory??? Youre usually known for such great food and Ive been coming here for years. I hope no one else gets served crappy food like this!!!"
Taylor C.,"Aiea, HI",4,15,14,2.0,3/18/2017,The food itself was very good and the service was not bad for the restaurant being so busy.  What ruined the experience was we were sitting outdoors and the smell of sewer from next door wafted in and ruined our appetite.  Everyone else around us was complaining of the foul smell and you could see everyone covering their nose and their mouth in disgust.
Lori W.,"Turlock, CA",0,15,,5.0,2/23/2017,"Excellent food and great service. I went here with a friend, we split the corn cakes and the vegetable salad. It was delicious and more than enough food for two. I have found the Cheesecake Factory restaurants to be very consistent in quality and service. This one was exceptional."
Crystal K.,"Kailua, HI",98,15,7,4.0,7/15/2016,"I've been to this restaurant many times over the years... The service had always been great everything I've came and I never have a problem with the long wait times because when you come with great friends, it really doesn't seem that bad.  I always have drinks or wine when I come, and of course cheesecake at the end of my meal. But it's the actual meal that has never impressed me. Maybe the menu is so large that I've just never found the right entree for me? Until... Now! I absolutely loved the chicken with lemon couscous! Please don't ever take that off the menu if you do a menu change...! That entree is AMAZING!"
Alexander G.,"Honolulu, HI",464,618,3268,4.0,8/2/2014,"Busy place with a phone book of a menu, this restaurant has something for everyone. From salads to fish and pasta, there's always good food for any meal. This restaurant is one of the better ""corporate ones"" with staff willing to please. Service on the food is as fast as possible, which can be a little slow sometimes. The decor of the restaurant is consistent with others in the chain, which is dark, cold, but nice. If you want to still feel like you're in Hawaii, sit outside. The tables there overlook busy Kalakaua Avenue, which is a bustling tourist street at any hour. Great for dinner, my favorite meal here is the special Sunday brunch. I love the various eggs benefict dishes, especially the salmon and tomato. The bottomless drinks are amazing, one of my favorite ice teas around. If you're used to bread service, this is one of the only restaurants in the state that offers it- white and hearty wheat.  Great place for families, dates, or a dinner alone."
Tom T.,"Pasadena, CA",109,225,217,3.0,10/16/2015,Was a little let down by this Cheesecake Factory location.  Came in for the strawberry shortcake only to find out they ran out of shortcakes. Instead we tried the vanilla lemonchello cake with ice cream and while it was delightful it does not compare to the strawberry shortcake! Perhaps next time
Lindsey N.,"Wailuku, HI",114,93,604,3.0,10/15/2015,"It is hard to eat at this place due to everytime I go its always busy & the wait is ridiculous... Just happen to have Lunch with my mom & sister at this place & it wasnt even busy (phew).  I ended up ordering the Ceaser Salad with Hawaiian Pizza. The salad size wasnt that bad & the pizza was a lil bit bigger then a personal pan (about 5 slices).  For dessert we had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, it was sooooo good & fluffy. Between the 3 of us we couldnt finish it (we are trying to watch our weight, lol)."
Nia B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",2,30,6,3.0,1/27/2017,"The wait is forever. I hate how they always put my husband and I at those little tables that are close together for just two people. It's so impersonal and I feel invaded. However, the food and cheesecake are great. Parking sucks downtown anyway so we get over it."
