Miss N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,25,5.0,3/7/2016,"BEST OF THE BEST Cheesecake Factory I've been too!! THANK YOU!  Yes, they are completely full ALL the time, we went on Tuesday and Friday but we did not wait more than 5m. Thumbs up. Food excellent, service is outstanding AND the cocktails were not washed out, our party of 5 tried at least 8 different drinks and they all were 5 out of 5!! Definitely recommending this particular location of Cheesecake Factory!"
Cathy T.,"Aiea, HI",654,215,858,4.0,6/3/2015,Wanted a steak. Got a steak. #winning! I had been craving a steak for a few days when a friend of mine suggested we grab lunch at Cheesecake factory. I figured the craving could just be put aside for a calorie bomb cheeseacke.  But HOLD THE PHONE the menu here is so extensive that they actually have several steaks on it! omgomgomg! I decided on the grilled ribeye (rare) because I figured go big or go home. In order to be somewhat health-conscious I switched out french fries for steamed broccoli and was actually really happy that I did. I didn't need the carbs to make me feel full after putting away the entire steak and veggies. (Although I did eat the free bread that came to the table so I did have some carbs...) I dipped my broccoli into my steak juice for extra flavor because it's seriously just steamed (no seasoning even I think) I was so full that I didn't even get any cheesecake. Which made me happy (yay save money & my pants still fit) but sad (aww I love chessecake).  Guess I'll just have to go back and get a slice some other time my omnivorous self isn't clamoring for red meat.
Jason R.,"Waipahu, HI",0,1,,4.0,7/30/2017,"Theirs one in the new kapolie mall gonna open up pretty soon, have an interview soon hope I get hired."
Tadder T.,"Waipahu, HI",18,46,1,5.0,7/5/2016,"It's been at least 10 years since I've been here, and like many locals, hardly frequent the place because it takes forever to get in. My last and only memory of this place was that the food was good, not great, and everything else was mediocre.  I was in Waikiki for 4th of July weekend and understandably it was more crowded than normal - 2 hour wait at 9pm at night. No thanks. But I came back the next morning and around 945am it wasn't crowded we got seated quickly.  The hostesses (male and female) left a lot to be desired. Not real friendly or engaging - the bare minimum. The guy leading us to our table just confirmed our name then started walking, no welcome or anything. Luckily we had an awesome server. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and she had a great happy vibe. She made us all feel comfortable. Timely visits to check on us and very accommodating.  The food was excellent as well. Of course everything in Waiks is overpriced but here they give you so much food it's like two meals. The food tasted fresh and was very flavorful - good salads and soup, pizzas, and my steak tacos.  My party all got their food before me and mine took a long time. The manager came out (without prompting) and said the cook overdid my steak and would cook a new dish. She politely asked if I minded waiting, apologized, and offered me a choice of a free side menu item or cheesecake. How awesome is that?! I'll be honest - the normal wait times are too long for me and I may not be back for a while. But great food and great service (except for the hostesses) makes this one of my favorite overall restaurants!"
Josh B.,"Lacey, WA",256,905,6224,4.0,7/15/2014,"If you get tired of the food in the downtown Waikiki area or just want a good meal, go here. We went on a Saturday night and it was not too much of wait but very busy. Again, it's very busy and very crowded in the lobby so sit outside while you wait and wish for the buzzer to vibrate or sit at the bar.  We actually got seated outside which was kind of nice whereas you can people watch as your view is of the main street. Also it was quieter so you could actually hear each other talk.  Our waitress was very attentive even with all the people there and tables that she was attending to. You could tell that she had been doing this for a while. We placed our drink order and our meal order and the procession of things was very smooth and fluid. There wasn't really a huge amount of down time or awkward sitting and waiting for a waiter to come back out to check on things.  I got a five cheese pasta that was very rich but very good. I decided to save room for some cheesecake because let's be real...why come to Cheesecake Factory and not get some great cheesecakes. There really is a lot of overall selection on the cheesecake menu. There weren't a huge amount of options for vegetarians but they were happy to add or remove items from most of the entrees to accommodate.  It was my sister's birthday so it really was just a nice way to still relax on vacation, have a good solid meal/service and just enjoy each other's company.  Total $80 +tip for us two but we got appetizers, drinks, entrees, and cheese cake, so I think money well spent."
Hoku T.,"Honolulu, HI",321,120,395,4.0,6/5/2015,"I love the Lunch Hours! Why, you may be wondering...because I've never waited more than 3 minutes for a table! All the times I've eaten here have only been their opening hours and I like it that way.  On my recent visit the Hostess took us to what I thought was 'the Dungeon'. I don't know why she thought that four women, three of which have poor eye sight, would be fine sitting in a round corner booth with barely any light. Sure some may think that dimming lights make for an 'Intimate Experience'...blah! Not here! It does not look classy to see ladies pulling out their phones to use the flashlight to read the menu! Even after asking the waitress if they could brighten up the lights in the corner or if they had any glasses that had an LED light, she sadly replied that the restaurant can't change the lights and no light reading glasses. For this lack of light set us 10min more into searching into 'The Cheesecake Factory Menu Book' for our Lunch.  Appetizers to try:  Crab & Artichoke Dip! Yes, everyone should try this dip that will not only make you moan because of the taste, but will feed four people very well! We attacked the toasted bread slices, which weren't that much, and the squaw & Italian bread with the crab and artichoke dip! Even after the toasted slices were eaten, we began asking for a second helping of warm bread to place the dip in between and have a nice crab sandwich - which I also recommend trying!  Soup of the Day: when I ordered my Renee's lunch special (chicken and almond salad sandwich with a small baby green salad with blue cheese dressing and a bowl of soup); the soup which was called, ""Spicy Mexican Chicken Soup with cheese and crispy tortilla strips"". This is must try! The closest to this soup in taste is at Chili's - but this clearly out bests Chili's. After one spoonful and I ate the whole bowl of soup before I even touched my salad and sandwich! The soup was very tasty, the Spicy - meaning full of spices because it wasn't hot in rector scale but pipping hot in temperature. This soup can be eaten on a cool Fall evening on a porch staring out into the sunset! Yes, I would definitely go back just for the soup!  Entrees to try that will make you content -  Fish & Chips Factory Meatloaf  Fettuccine Alfredo  Renee's Lunch Special And of course the cheesecake! Though I'll let you decide which is your favorite! Though something I noticed and liked is that they have special cheesecakes for certain holidays. Way to celebrate Cheesecake Factory!!"
Val V K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,7,5.0,9/1/2016,"I visit Cheesecake factory at least 3 times a week. Great food, great people. High quality meals for a reasonable price. Come earlier to avoid the line"
Stephanie H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,69,3,5.0,1/20/2017,"We probably only come to this location 2-3 times a year and I always order the same thing, the Jamaican shrimp.  It's amazing every time.  I wish they would bring back the plantains the dish once had but the purpose of this review is to recognize excellent customer service.  We just had lunch and Daniel V. was our server.  He was fantastic and went above and beyond.  He was even helpful with our baby and 4 year old!  Awesome job!"
Paul M.,"Oakville, Canada",0,4,,3.0,8/7/2017,Great food but poor staff. Air conditioner outlet was dripping on 2 of our party. They said they'd resolve it but they didn't. My son had appetizer Caesar salad. Asked if it was of a size he could still eat a meal?  Was told yes but it was big enough for 3 people so his most of it went to waste so he could eat his dinner. Upsell?  I think so. He's a growing 17 year old so his capacity isn't the issue. Staff left a poor taste in our mouths. (Pun intended).
Rosie A.,"Allambie Heights, Australia",0,8,2,4.0,2/2/2017,"Very nice place , super busy , very nice food Mac cheeseburger was delicious, steak diane was delicious however they cut the steak up and it dried out a little. Chicken Parma sandwich was delicious too."
M C.,"Honolulu, HI",1,29,,1.0,2/2/2017,"Uggghhh.....GROSS!!!!! I don't know what happened to Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki.  When it first opened up, the food was great, portions big, and service excellent (given how busy it gets in there).  Me and my family & friends would often go there to eat for the past few years.  Last time we went was around 3 months ago. In the last 3-4 years, I've noticed a huge decline.  The food quality is poor, and their signature dishes taste like crap (food seemed old, overly-greasy, and smaller portions).  Some of the waiters are good while others have an attitude.  I've let management know and received a call from a manager.  The manager seemed like he was giving me a bogus talk and didn't seem to take what I was saying seriously.   Save your money & time, don't go there until they can get their act together!"
April M.,"Kyle, TX",28,13,14,5.0,7/18/2016,"We walked in and got seated promptly on Sunday around 4 pm! Surprised us because every time we try to go it's packed with a very long wait! The food was pretty good! The kids meals come loaded! If you have small children and they eat like birds, have them share if they will. The spaghetti and meatball kid's plates are the size of an adult's entree! All of our Plates were fully loaded! Great prices and great food! Our waitress was friendly and stayed on top of our drinks making sure they were refilled! Grab a slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake! You will not be disappointed!"
Leza M.,"Honolulu, HI",34,25,67,4.0,1/31/2017,"There is always a wait but the dessert is worth it.  The food is good and they give you way too much but let's face it, if you're dining here it's not really for the food, it's for the cheesecake.  My faves are red velvet cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake and the lemon cream cake."
Zaneta O.,"Aiea, HI",14,138,383,3.0,10/5/2015,"Went to this place with a bunch of friends last Sunday. We beat a crowd of people, so we waited only 20 minutes, any longer than 25 minutes is not worth it. Ordered the shrimp scampi, was glad it was big shrimps but didn't like that they had some breading on it. Also got a long island iced tea which wasn't that bad either. It's not like the broke da mouth food. Service was attentive. All in all, had a good time with my friends and felt like I was a tourist for a bit."
Mei W.,"Oakland, CA",30,210,16,3.0,5/7/2016,"After spending a couple of hours at Ala Moana shopping center with the kids, I wanted to treat them to some yummy cheesecakes so in we went at 5:30pm. Surprisingly we were promptly seated, and our server were very attentive and nice. The food was just meh but their cheesecakes are divine. Needless to say, the kids polished off their broccoli just so they can eat their cheesecake!"
Erin U.,"Honolulu, HI",9,13,5,3.0,1/29/2017,I've been to cheese cake factory in Waikiki several times and the service has always been great and the food is excellent! I will say it is well worth the wait.  The only reason I gave the restaurant a 3/5 stars is because when I recently placed a take out order for cheese cake both of the slices I got were so thin and small.  They gave a bunch of whip cream which seemed to hide the small tiny piece. For the price paid I was very disappointed.  Hopefully they were just running low and cut smaller pieces  that night and it isn't always this way.
Chavah A.,"Honolulu, HI",264,393,530,5.0,3/15/2016,Gosh - I normally don't like going to chains but we can't help but to keep coming back tot eh cheesecake factory!!! It's consistent - food is always perfect - and the staff is always so friendly and helpful. We come here at least once a week. It's a guilty pleasure for sure. Their chicken and biscuits are my go to food. So yummmmmyyyyyy!!!!
Kayla T.,"Derrimut, Australia",0,7,9,4.0,2/17/2017,"I ate from here multiple times whilst on holidays in Hawaii. Only was able to eat inside the actual restaurant and not order takeaway once because the waiting times for a table were insanely long, 2 - 3 hours long , However the food was absolutely amazing and worth it ! I would recommend as the menu is very large and is suitable for everyone! The cheesecake here is insane and is a must have, so save room for dessert! A tad expensive but worth the price."
L Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,56,15,4.0,7/30/2016,"Today was National Cheesecake day! Awesome! Get a slice for half price!!! Took my 2 daughters today as it is one of their favorites! If you go around 5pm, you can get seated pretty quickly & if you park at the Royal Hawaiian shopping center, get ticket validated,  Parking is FREE!  We always get the crab artichoke dip which is so creamy with lots of crab.  Gotta eat it warm with the crispy toasted french bread!  The fried chicken sliders are so moist & tasty with the mayo, thousand island dressing, lettuce, tomato & pickles! You need to order the Pasta Da Vinci because the penne pasta is cooked a la dente with lots of chunks of chicken & slices of mushrooms.  Wish they would have parmesan garlic cheese bread like they do at the Cheesecake Factory Restaurants in LA."
Carrie G.,"Honolulu, HI",101,318,600,3.0,7/9/2014,"Sorry CCF, but I have to downgrade you a star because I think you're letting things slip. Here's my feedback- Try adding some new menu items. With all the stuff CCF's offer, it would be nice to see a few more changes. We sat at the bar area so I realize customer service might be lacking compared to the dining room (though it shouldn't), we didn't feel the guy working the bar was the CCF standard of friendly. He seemed bothered by us ordering food and drinks from him.  The woman behind the bar took over after we pointed out our cheeseburger was missing... Cheese! And the fries were cold and limp. She fixed our order asap and was a lot friendlier.  The bathrooms were a mess. They usually are a lot cleaner, so minus some points there. The sink area was covered in water, there was toilet paper scraps all over the floor and wet rags laying on the ground. Yuck.  The white chocolate macadamia Caramel cheesecake was good but it was such a tiny slice for $8. See picture. It really was reduced to a sliver when normally the slices are huge.  Anyway, we love the food so we'll be back and hope for better results next time."
