Theresa P.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",22,24,4,3.0,12/26/2016,"Not my first time here but the experience doesn't change. The wait- came in for lunch on Christmas Day. Quoted a 20 minute wait time and seated about 35 minutes later. The service- The server was sweet and friendly but not very attentive throughout the meal (again, typical of the service here probably because they're so busy). The food/drinks- DO NOT order a Bloody Mary here. Tasted like a pre made mix and costed about $9! The chicken and waffle benedict was great if it wasn't a Benedict. The yolk of the poached egg was cooked through. Not at all what you expect when ordering a Benedict. Shrimp and chicken gumbo was amazing. Definitely worth coming back for! If not for the gumbo to try out one of they're many selections of entrees."
Linda M.,"Honolulu, HI",33,7,,3.0,1/23/2017,Food was good. Service not so good. Very dark atmosphere.  All in all I'm under impressed with The Cheesecake Factory. Glad we tried it but now we don't need to come back.
Mai D.,"Honolulu, HI",17,62,47,3.0,6/8/2016,"Parking is validated if you park in the Royal Hawaiian Center. Normally I don't do chain restaurants too often but was specifically craving their cheesecake and said hey why not. Lesson learned, will not return. Menu is huge, thus will suit anyone taste buds! (Hoping they will have something that sounds pleasant for you) and you're in Waikiki expect the prices to be high! Ordered the salmon egg rolls as an appetizer, it was delicious! Though I wish it was a somewhat bigger portion, ate the red cabbage it was served with - had a nice crunch and the sesame flavored sauce was refreshing.  I myself had the falafel salad. Overly dressed, so I recommend to order the dressing on the side! I am a believer of not returning food unless it was not specific to my personal order so that was my mistake. The falafel was good! Not too oily and had good flavor for sure. My date had the fish encrusted with macadamia nut or whatever. Being a market priced item, I was disappointed, very small portion and overcooked. The rice and veggies it came with was good though! Cheesecake rules thus any flavor is delicious, salted caramel was on point, wish that was the only thing I ordered.  SERVICE - makes or breaks you as a restaurant but I guess not in this case, it absolutely was not up to par. Was seated but didn't receive water or introduction for 11 minutes. I understand it was busy but an acknowledgement would've been appreciated. Waitress looked exhausted, didn't seem very friendly - more robotic and monotone, turned me off didn't really want to ask questions or for recommendations (that's why I ended up with a salad ha). But the turn around for time for food made up for lack of customer service there.  They are busy, I completely understand that part but acknowledgement would've made the experience better."
Shawna M.,"Kapaa, HI",182,153,139,5.0,4/10/2016,"I love this place! It was really busy, but the wait was worth it. Waited about 20 mins which wasn't bad since there were shops all around to get lost in.  Ambience was causal, a little loud, but nothing you wouldn't expect for being in town and around so many people! The lighting is kind of dark, but it makes it to be more romantic if you need it to be.  Soooo many items on their menu! And the drinks all sound sooo yummy! Their sangria is the best I've ever tasted!  Their portions are so big, you will definitely be brining home left overs because you need to save room for, of course, CHEESECAKE! Their choices are so delicious and are a good size.  We had the fried macaroni balls, which was definitely my favorite! I love macaroni and I love fried things, so naturally, I had to have it. I had gotten their famous meatloaf and it was the best! Mashed potatoes and a yummy vegetable medley. I will definitely be coming back on my next trip."
Justin P.,"Honolulu, HI",36,17,6,1.0,1/18/2017,"Food was great, restaurant is loud, can barely here the person next to you. This is the second time I been here. Everything I come I pay 14.00 dollars in parking. Would have been a 4 but these guys just simply make it easy to park."
Jeannie G.,"Jersey City, NJ",28,98,1215,4.0,5/13/2015,"Cheesecake Factory never fails! #1 reason why we came here on a Friday after 5pm-we were missing the CF back on the mainland and despite it's tourist magnet location, we said what the heck-their food is worth it. Some tips: DINING for 2: Head straight for the BAR area. Self-serve seating! As soon as you see an empty table grab it and plop your behind down! There service is quite attentive and someone will catch your eye and drop some menus. I'd pass on the heavy wait at a regular table unless ur with a group-there are always ppl waitin swampin the entrance.  AMBIANCE: Huh?! What did you say?! Yes! It's loud in there. Of course mainly bc of the volume and traffic of people. But who comes to Cheesecake Factory anyway to have a ""quiet candlelight"" dinner. The lighting is pretty dim though. Better have ur phone flashlight handy.  DRINKS: Hubz ordered a Manhattan straight-up (for you hardcore drinkers, u know how tuff it tastes). Waiter was on top of his drinking game and new his liquor well. Was well made with Bourbon, Vermouth and all. Don't forget the cherry! I had some Tropical martini. Came straight up with a cute orchid flower in it-not cough syrup tasting at all. Thumbs up! FOOD: APPS: First off, they serve you warm yummy bread-and that brown loaf with the oats is bomb by itself! Try not to fill up on it even though it is bottomless. 1st up. Can't go wrong with there ""Fried Mac-N-Cheese""! Comes in 4 tennis ball sized pieces, breaded outside toped with sauce, slice down the middle and watch the cheese ooze right out.  Yah better dip that bread all up in der. Mmmm! MAIN: Tried there newest ""Harvest Salad""-recommended by our waiter. Was divine! Refreshing-arugula was not heavy and too crunchy like how romaine lettuce could be. The edamame and pine nuts added texture. And the slices of parm cheese added juss a perfect amt of salt. Even took the rest home! This was a half portion! Hubz ordered the ""Smokehouse Burger""-also recommended by our waiter. Size was not impressive, was cooked as asked, seasoned well, and the BBQ sauce was not too sweet. He enjoyed it! DESSERT: Sad to say, they no longer have one of my favs-""Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake"" so we shot to try another recommendation from our waiter and tried the ""Tuxedo""-and I'm glad we did. It was  chocolate goodness all over! The ganache, fudge, and mascarpone cheese-heaven! Also we ordered a classic, the ""Strawberry"" cheesecake, gotta love that graham cracker crust and large fresh strawberries. Mmm.. WRAP IT UP: Would we be back?! For sure, wouldn't make it a regular spot but CF has always delivered on their food. Always satisfied. One more note-their menus differ a bit fr mainland in that it doesn't have the mini plates/tapas at the front of the menu (addtl 2-3pgs) and a few other items but thats fine bc were in Hawaii and the special is not ""Mahi Mahi"" like it always was back in the mainland lol. Thanks CF for another great dining experience! Keep up the good work."
Court R.,"Henderson, NV",65,86,65,3.0,3/13/2016,"This places is pretty good and I would probably come back again.  The trick to the wait time is come around 4pm for dinner, I know it seems early but this way you're done in time to walk to beach for sunset! We were a party of 5, and waited 25 minutes for a table outside! Not bad! We got a few drinks, and appetizers: 1. Kalua pork pizza 13.95, it was ok the pork was dry. 2. Chicken BBQ pizza 13.95 good, but very few chicken pieces. 3. Fried calamari-excellent get it! 4. Chicken caesar salad with Chicken 14.95 also very good."
June M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",29,8,5,4.0,8/23/2015,"We've been here before a long while back, we loved it then and we still love it now. They told us the wait time would be 20 minutes which wasn't that bad of a wait. Our waiter was pretty attentive despite how busy it was. We had the warm crab and artichoke dip which was so yummy. I had the shrimp scampi and steak diane, my boyfriend had the herb crusted salmon and the steak diane, it was delicious. Of course we had to try the cheesecake, we had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake which was delicious. I can't wait to go back."
Brianne F.,"Kaneohe, HI",107,13,,3.0,2/4/2017,"Love the food and the vibes! The only thing was the wait time. It was a Tuesday night and our wait time to be seated was an hour and a half, no lie. But our waiter took good care of us & we didn't have to wait a ridiculous amount of time for our food, which was a plus because I was starved! Lol. I was so full that I did a take out on my dessert. Overall, everything was great except for the wait time to be seated."
Kristina R.,"Quincy, WA",4,3,3,2.0,2/3/2017,"We had a 45m wait. Once we were seated it took a while, which was fine but the waiter was not good he brought one dish and didn't say anything 10m later they brought the rest of the food. Not once did our waiter ask how things were. Then they were trying to push us out and take my husbandson food before he was finished. I loved the food but not the exsperance and it was my husband 40th birthday"
Matt A.,"Kailua, HI",79,20,58,3.0,8/8/2015,"Seating was quick for a busy Saturday summer. It's 5:30pm on a Saturday. We were told 20 minutes, but got buzzed in 10min. Waiter was friendly, loud and clear when he talked with us. He was very detailed on the menu which I appreciated. Complimentary bread came first. Three mini loaves two whole wheat, one sourdough. Warm and fresh. Nothing spectacular. We ordered the Baked Potato Soup, Potstickers and Kobe Steak Burger. Appetizers and Main dish arrived in a timely manner. The Potstickers were ok. They arrive swimming in the dipping sauce with garnish on top. Potstickers were likely steamed and then seared. The filling inside was generous, but wasn't flavorful. The filling was dry, but the sauce compensated. Baked Potato Soup was standard fare. Generous serving, but nothing that punches out the taste buds). We did need to ask that it be heated up. It came to us on the warm-borderline cold side. Kobe Burger was good. I ordered mine medium rare and my wife got a well done. Both were cooked to order. Burger was moist, but the taste was a little overpowered by the sautéed mushroom and onions. It also came with an aioli side which complimented it well. I'd give the burger a 3 out of 5 (McDonald's is a .5 out of 5 for comparison). Tip: low group numbers probably was the advantage of getting seated sooner than later. It was only me and the wife. Sum it all up. Service was excellent. Food was good. Need to return and try other menu items. I'll be back."
Barry C.,"Bray, Republic of Ireland",5,4,7,1.0,1/31/2017,We came here for an early dinner at 4pm. We got seated fairly quickly but got put right at the back of the restaurant which was completely empty. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came near us. 2 tables were then seated near us and were immediately served. We sat there for 25 minutes in total without being acknowledged by anyone. After 25 minutes we left. We mentioned it to a host on the way out who asked if we wanted to talk to a manager. At the point we were done with the Cheesecake Factory and left.
Maggie L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/10/2017,I wanted to exchange my to-go food and Nicole the cashier and JT the manager were awesome with customer service and catered to all my requests!!
Misty P.,"Aiea, HI",247,532,448,2.0,4/14/2014,"We came here for lunch due to this place not taking reservations. I've been here before so I know how long the line can get - and well, I have no patience when I'm hungry. The wait for lunch was short, only 10 minutes to get a seat. When seated, our waitress took our drink orders then came back for the appetizer and entree orders. It took a while for our drinks to come out, and later on, the appetizer and entree took a while too. So much so, that I already got full off the free bread. I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade. It was pretty good and came with a sugar rimmed glass. What I found weird was they gave you no butter knives for the bread. Our waitress was barely to be found so we used a spoon to put butter on the bread. Lame. We ordered kalua pork nachos for our appetizer. This was the best part of the meal. I loved the pico de gallo and guacamole on it. The chips were crispy, had lots of cheese and loved the jalapeno toppings. I ordered the lunch special Pizza with Everything and a salad with ranch dressing. The salad was so-so. Not much taste to the dressing at all. The greens were a spring mix and it was fresh. I just had to add a little salt to the greens for more taste, which I rarely ever do. The pizza was meh. The pepperoni tasted like nasty processed Hormel pepperoni you can get from the grocery store. In fact, I'd rather eat that stuff. The cheese was minimal on the crust and there were small portions of onions, sausage, mushrooms and peppers. The mushrooms on the pizza looked like canned mushrooms. The crust tasted like those microwavable mini pizzas. I ate one slice and boxed the rest to go. I may feed it to my dog, eat it as a desperation lunch or just toss it in the trash. Not sure what decision I'll make yet. Our waitress sucked. Once our order was in, she tended to the other Japanese tourists, and left us without saying a word. She also did something weird, which was stuff her body between our small tables (they are very close in the back side) facing her butt towards our plates and food. Gross. Of course if you come here you got to have the cheesecake. I ordered strawberry cheesecake to go. It was alright. I've had better elsewhere.  Parking was only a dollar if you park in the ""non-hotel guest lot"" at the Sheraton Hotel garage. Don't forget to get your ticket validated, then pay at the prepay machine downstairs or on the 3rd floor."
Rupa S.,"Markham, Canada",52,152,179,4.0,8/13/2015,"One hour wait? Don't care! No reservations? Who cares. It's worth it to come here YES I'm reviewing the Cheesecake Factory - a chain restaurant. Yes, we are here multiple times on vacation.  As t swift says haters gonna hate- I don't care the fold here is good, the portions are good! Lunch is more bang for your buck. Dinner is amazing. The wait is LONG but give in your name to get a buzzer- they give you a estimated wait time- go shopping and come back in time to be called so the buzzer works! Good for vegetarians and non vegetarians! My family lives the Cheesecake Factory - we don't have any in Canada. In Waikiki- the Cheesecake Factory has a Hawaiian flare - with the servers all in cool shirts. The macadamian crusted Hawaiian fish is sooo good. As are other items, including the avocado egg roll, crab wontons and so on.  The free bread is good- I don't care qhTs in it. Dessert is good - or save room and get some shaved ice at the stand outside!!"
Lorrie H.,"Eugene, OR",137,5,,5.0,1/4/2017,"Fantastic food, kind hostess, fast and nice waitress. Hamburgers are charbroiled and are delicious."
Vishal G.,"Portage, MI",0,4,,1.0,1/3/2017,Extremely long wait time. Over the service was fine but very slow. There was a lot of chaos.
Divina R.,"Kapolei, HI",7,59,126,3.0,9/21/2015,-2 stars for the wait alone.  Their food is good. My favorite is definitely their gumbo. I would wait in line for that while I shop next door. And ofcourse their cheesecakes are to die for. There is soooo many. Apple caramel streusel is awesome. Their Oreo cookie-yummmmmmmm their red velvet oooooh yeah.
Tanya E.,"Kailua, HI",263,87,266,4.0,8/6/2015,"We went for dinner last night. We've been here before so we expected the 1hr and 20mins wait. We went shopping to make the time pass faster. Our table buzzer went off right on schd.  We were sat and greeted. However, it was very busy like always so it took sometime for our server to get to us. When he did we placed all of our orders with him. I found that it's just faster to pre-pick what I want ahead of time.  Drinks came out slowly, but they were both delicious. The house bread, sour dough and oat whole wheat, was warm and yummy as always.  We shared the shrimp summer rolls and the hot beef dipping sandwich. Both were very good as well and worth the wait.  We planned to have cheesecake at the end however the blueberry one we wanted was not in season. Which turned out to be a good thing because we were stuffed and going home with leftovers.  I thought that the restaurant was a little too dark, but that is just my opinion.  We'll be back, the food is alleys great when I go!"
Mykalah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,39,5,2.0,12/31/2016,I'm not sure if my waiter was new .. but the service was sooooo slow . I had to ask for our drinks twice . He didn't bring out bread until food was at the table .. and he never checked on us not once . To be in Hawaii it was a terrible experience
