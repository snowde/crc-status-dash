Crystal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,50,42,5.0,4/25/2015,"Here's the thing... No one comes to Hawaii to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. Seems silly, right? But when you have a diversity of food palates and everyone is hungry, and you are tired of trying to please everyone, it makes sense.  We only had a ten minute wait and then we were whisked to a table. Our server knew we were starved and moved at cheetah like speed to take our drink and meal orders.  If you've ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know what the food is like but they found a way to make it special. One of our guests had to step out for a call, so our server, Cory, put his plate away to ensure his food stayed warm. When the guest returned, he even brought fresh rice. More on Cory... This guy was a real class act. He gave us the exact amount of attention we needed, was friendly and professional, and had both a sense of urgency and patience.  I know you shouldn't visit ""chains"" when you are on vacation, but if you need an easy crowd pleaser, I highly recommend it."
Keiko B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,6/14/2017,Bad bad customer serves here. Nobody care about us and it take order almost hour!!! Not surprise. I just came here I have gift card. I never come back again.
Jonathan D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,39,5,1.0,7/2/2017,"This restaurant let me down. I have gone the Cheesecake Factories all over this one missed the mark. The wait is understandable its right on Waikiki.  The calamari was super chewy, although my plate was piping hot my burrito was warm/cold they forgot about my gf burger. One of the waitresses that had a very nice behind kept putting her ass on our table. They try to cram as many tables as they can in this place and that's bad"
Cora H.,"Honolulu, HI",35,1,,1.0,12/10/2016,"...the hostess that answers their business phone, needs training on how to professionally answer the specific question regarding reservations!"
Eva N.,"Honolulu, HI",0,40,,3.0,1/18/2017,Wouldn't wait or pay the prices for the food. Especially with so many other great choices in Waikiki BUT the cheesecake is on a whole other level...so so so delicious. I could probably eat two slices if I could. Haven't had one a didn't like yet although some are crazy sweet compared to others.
Jackie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",330,289,332,5.0,7/17/2015,"I always love coming to the Cheesecake Factory. Even though we always have to wait, the wait this time was good with us because it was shorter than we imagined and they took us in earlier than we thought. They told us 40min (party of 2 at 6:30pm) and we got in within 30 minutes.  Our waiter was super friendly and was probably one of the best waiters we've had. My boyfriend always drinks his water so fast, but our waiter was always there to refill it, so he never ran out of water. ( That was literally a first because he always runs out of water and has to wait long or ask for more water) idk our waiters name but it was a cute guy & we sat by the bar.  The food was really good as always. We got the Chinese chicken salad and Louisiana chicken bow tie pasta. The cheesecake is outstanding and everyone should come here! I love the Cheesecake Factory."
Regine G.,"Honolulu, HI",431,50,14,2.0,3/15/2015,"I don't know why I keep on eating here if I know the service is going to be bad.   Tip: only dine in if you have about 3 hours to spare. That's taking into account the wait time, the time for your food to get out, and time for your bill to come. Today, we waited about 10 minutes to be seated. We spent an hour waiting for our bread and appetizers to come. The wait took so long for our entrees to arrive that we weren't even hungry by the time it came. We had gift cards for cheesecake which forced us to order dessert. Same thing: waited long for dessert that we weren't able to take any more than 2 bites of it .  Now I'm currently writing this review as I'm waiting for the bill to come. It's taking that long!  Food: made the mistake of ordering the luau salad. I regret it. It was overdressed and super oily. I'm pretty sure a pasta would've had less calories than the salad I ordered. I should stick to my usual -- the Thai lettuce wraps.  I hope Cheesecake Factory decides to build another location that's not in Waikiki. I think another location would serve for better service."
Oliver G.,"East Perth, Australia",2,9,19,5.0,11/18/2016,If you can have a late lunch. We arrived at 2pm and did not have to wait. Service was best so far in Hawaii. Excellent. Food portions are huge. Food is excellent and excellent value. Drinks also excellent and well priced. I had the Molokini and it was awesome. Like Rum icecream with mango. Chinese chicken salad. Fried mac and cheese. All excellent.
Carissa H.,"Honolulu, HI",40,45,14,4.0,11/8/2016,It's good. Not great for how long the wait is. No reservations unfortunately. But the cheesecake is bomb!! Red velvet is a must.
Quoc-Nam N.,"Honolulu, HI",21,78,102,5.0,4/26/2016,"We came during lunchtime and it was already packed. So, we saw an opening in the bar area & took that risk! for those of you who are frequent ""dining outers,"" you all know that service in the bar area is hit or miss. In this case, the service was spot on! We have only have one person to thank for that and it was Blaine! Although the bar area was packed, Blaine was very considerate and attentive, not only to our table, but to all of his tables. He was super kind and friendly as well! Just his service alone made our experience a positive one.  But of course, I need to review the food. Let's just say it's Cheesecake Factory! I mean everything is good here! I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (Create your own Thai lettuce rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles & Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili & Tamarind-Cashew). How does that sound?! Exactly!!! This appetizer is really big enough to serve 2 people, but I was pretty hungry. All the flavors blended so well together and each of the sauces gave each roll a unique taste profile! They were not spicy at all. Even better, there was the perfect amount of chicken for each piece of lettuce! Where does that ever happen? It happens at Cheesecake Factory! My wife ordered the Kale & Quinoa Salad (lots of tender kale, quinoa, grapes, sweet red pepper, sunflower seeds & parmesan cheese. Tossed with our Lemon Vinaigrette). Umm...just order it if you are looking at a ""healthy"" salad. This salad has so much flavor that you will not be able to put down your fork! The bitterness of the kale is balanced out with the sweetness of the grapes and the tanginess of the vinaigrette! And, its super healthy! There is a generous portion on this order, so you could definitely share, or save some for later! Bottom line: if you can stand the wait, come here to eat! Just like other Cheesecake Factory locations, the food will not disappoint! And, it is located on the main strip (Kalakaua Ave) in Waikiki with a nice sized lanai to eat on! Hope you enjoyed it as much as we did!"
Elizabeth D.,"Honolulu, HI",210,187,4995,2.0,2/26/2015,"Located by Royal Hawaiian shopping center in Waikiki. You already know because of the location, this place is supah packed! Tourists pack this place as well as locals.  If you don't mind waiting for 1 hour and a half and have patience  like a saint then do come and join the chaos. The decor is like an old nostalgic museum and oh soooo dark. We had to look at our menu with our cell phone.  Staff is nice as can be, given their working condition.  Atmosphere is oh so hectic and crazy. Not at all relaxing. Not at all surprised, it's Waikiki.  After waiting for soooo long for a table, we finally got buzzed and was so famished, we couldn't wait to eat. Our tables was near vents and it was soooo cold, brrrrr. It was so cold it was miserable. Dare not to ask for another table because didn't want to wait another 2 hours.  We were served bread that was soo hard and stale but ate it anyway because we were so hungry. We did let the server know it was hard and stale and she did bring us out another set of bread. The second one was very soft and not at all stale, but we were already full from the first set of bread.  Soup of the day was potato soup and boy it was good. I don't know if it was we were famished or not but it looked and tasted very good. 5 stars.  Shrimp thai rolls was very tasy and good, there was 2 sauces, peanut and a sweeter sauce and they both complimented shrimp roll very well.  Teriyaki steak was a bit to sweet, not your authentic teriyaki, it was just ok. It was so busy I didn't realize they forgot the asparagus tempura that comes wiith the teriyaki dish. It was chaos and I just wanted to get out of there.  Combination steak diane and salmon was average and nothing out of the ordinary.  Combination steak diane and shrimp was tasy and generic.  Salad was just ok.  The best part was the chocolate cheescake. 5 stars.  The wait here was crazy insane but what to expect in Waikiki. The the food is just ok and not worth going through the chaos and long lines. Probably will return but not anytime soon, I need to get my energy together before i go again."
Lena P.,"Melbourne, Australia",3,22,47,5.0,5/10/2015,Seems strange to give The Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii of all places 5 stars but it totally deserves every star we're giving! We had the Herb Crusted Salmon with Mash Potatoes and Asparagus from the lunch menu and Carolina's BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. The salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly with delicious dressings. The sandwich/burger was absolutely YUM! The pulled pork was juicy and divine. Servings are huge so come hungry! Service was also great (as is in most Hawaiian restaurants & shops). Will definitely return!
Shae B.,"Kailua, HI",0,32,12,3.0,3/12/2017,"I called the restaurant in the morning to ask if they take dinner reservations for large parties (it's normally walk in only but I figured since we had 20 people, I figured the could accommodate us with a reservation) and the women said no. I asked how long the wait would be for a party that large and she said, ""anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours, we don't take reservations."" So I was a little irritated and told her that I thought it was ridiculous for a restaurant to not want to accommodate a large party like that and then said thank you, to only hear the phone slam down and see my call ended. Not sure who I spoke to, couldn't get a name because she hung up on me. Later that evening, one person from our party went down early and put our name down at 5:30pm which ended up only being 10 of us because the rest of the party could not make it. They told him that the wait would be 90 minutes to 2 hours. Our entire party was staying at the Hilton so we decided we'd catch a cab to the restaurant by 6:30pm and would only have to wait 30 minutes, and hour at the most because of the estimated wait time. At 6:30pm, we got a call that our table was ready. We hopped in a cab and headed down there, only to be stuck in traffic. The person in our party said they would only hold it for 10-15 minutes, after that, they were giving our table away. We knew we weren't going to make it in time so we called and asked to speak to a manager. The manager said that they gave the table away but when we get there, we'll be the first to be seated with the next table opening. We waited for about 45 minutes until we were called to be seated. The host told us, ""I know it says you don't want your party to be split but my manager Stephanie wrote void on here and we have you in separate booths behind each other."" Because we were tired of waiting and hungry we just said whatever yeah we'll take it. When we were seated, the booths were split 4 and 6 and we did not like the seating at all. My Mom asked to speak to a manager. Jen (manager) walked over and said she was going to try and get us a table all together. The waitress Bianca, not really aware of what was going on was sassy and had an attitude. When she found out we were moving, she said, ""well I'm not gonna put in your order until I know if you're moving or what's gonna happen."" After 10 minutes, we were moved to a table that could accommodate us all. Our new waiter, Ken, was very friendly. He checked on us frequently and made sure we were all good on waters, bread, etc. Jen, the manager from earlier, came and also checked on us. Jen and Ken definitely turned our bad experience and night into a better one. Three stars for the shitty service we received earlier in the night."
Nicole R.,"Honolulu, HI",44,134,121,5.0,6/20/2015,"We came here for our Father's Day dinner at 4:30pm, great there was no wait! I had the chicken di panna, I tried this at my wedding reception in Vegas at grand lux cafe in palazzo. Chicken is so so moist in a wine sauce, it usually comes with mash but I like it with angel hair! There so much on the menu it's hard to decide. Cheese cake is always good but come early or the might be a long wait!"
Thomas G.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,158,7,4.0,12/8/2016,"Great food, great service, great view however, very crowded and long wait which is the only downside"
Kristina K.,"Kent, WA",120,223,36,5.0,3/28/2016,"Tonight a friend and I drove to Waikiki to eat at the Cheesecake Factory. We waited about 30 minutes to get in- which was quick for dinner at this location. Once we got in, we had the best service that I've ever received at any restaurant! Travis was phenomenal! The food was served at perfect intervals, our drinks were always full and we are leaving so stuffed that we are waddling! I cannot say enough positive things about Travis at this location- we were blown away by his amazing customer service and will request him by name the next time we stop by! Wish that we could clone him to serve at all restaurants!"
Joe S.,"Mililani, HI",54,274,429,4.0,1/30/2015,"We were seated at 11:15am and couldn't be better!  Our waiter was JAY and his assistant was JENNY.  Very nice, personable, professional, and friendly.  I felt like a King and my wife a Queen. The meal was the Cobb Salad (lunch size), for my wife and I opted for the Fried Calamari (appetizer).  We also had an Iced Black Tea and a Beer (on tap).  The drinks came cold and frothy.  The ambience was satisfactory; though not of their fault.  There are just too many people walking and driving past the dining area that it becomes not a nice view, rather, a bother.   When the meal arrived we were overwhelmed with the size of the portions.  The ""lunch size"" Cobb Salad was enormous and the Calamari was large enough for four people!!  It was delicious and prepared in both taste and presentation to an appealing fashion.  We were very happy with the experience and it only got better... When it came time to order the famous Cheese Cake, we opted for the Vinilla Bean Cheese Cake and I will order the Low Carb Cheese Cake tomorrow (there are a few options available within this catagory).  The CC we ordered was for takeaway and came ready to go.  While we were waiting for the CC, I ordered the Espresso and it was, actually, better than that which can be found at Starbucks.   When it was time to leave, we received our bill and wasn't taken aback by the charges.  All included, it came to $43 and with tip, $53 out-the-door.  You can't beat that for a Waikiki Beach & famous restaurant for lunch.  They earned 5-Stars."
Kevin B.,"Makawao, HI",3,9,1,4.0,6/5/2016,Good food. We got seated within 10 minutes during the dinner rush. Our server was helpful and quick. This place was insane at 6pm but our meal was enjoyable. We took dessert to go. Always a pleasure with Cheesecake.
Nikki O.,"DuPont, WA",55,49,123,4.0,5/1/2016,It was pretty good. My favorite is the pasta jambalaya. Usually I don't like cheesecake but this was a must try
Jessy H.,"Orange, CA",28,15,20,3.0,3/15/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but this one is way too busy. Waiting 40 minutes for a table at the bar. The wait was even longer for a regular table. But the staff was great and they work hard. The atmosphere would have been relaxing if it weren't so loud because of all the people. If you could hear the live Hawaiian music, it was nice music. Because of the noise I wouldn't bring my kids and 3 month old baby here. But it was okay for me and my husband. I got a blue Hawaiian cocktail and the nachos, which could feed 3 grown adults. Huge portion size. The cheesecake was amazing like always. But I will not be coming back to this location at dinner with my family. Maybe lunch but not dinner. Just to busy and loud."
