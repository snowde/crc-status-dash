Haikela M.,"Honolulu, HI",101,131,316,4.0,3/13/2017,"Went here the past weekend to grab some lunch with my friends. It was a Sunday so I was expecting a long wait, since we had a limo stroller for twins as well. When I told them that I had a stroller they were very very accommodating! The wait was supposed to be 45 mins long but we had a pleasant surprise when they called us after fifteen minutes!  The service is always very good at this cheesecake factory.  The food was delish! Friend got the macaroni and cheese burger which was very filling but very good! Then I ordered their gumbo. The gumbo was ok, I've had better. I think it lacked spices. The presentation was very pretty but like I said I've had better. Their menu is so massive!!! I would personally cut it down to half and just pick their best sellers because some items on their menu are not worth ordering. When it comes to alcohol I think they do it right! I've never had a bad drink here! We ordered a margarita which was nice and strong.  Last but not least their cheese cake!!!!! It doesn't matter which on one you order, they are all so so so good! My favorite it the white chocalates rasberry! Oreo would be my second favorite, but like I said you can't order a bad one at cheesecake factory! P.s They have brunch on Sundays"
Jeana P.,"Waianae, HI",376,474,2651,4.0,12/26/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory located on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki near one entrance of the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. Of all the years that the restaurant has been around I have only dined there three times.  First time was lunch with my cousin from South Carolina and her friend from California along with their young daughters.  Second time was dinner after the Breakout Waikiki outing with friends.  My last visit was to have early Christmas dinner with friends. On my most recent visit I was with seven other individuals and we sat in the back end of the restaurant closer to the Royal Hawaiian.  Complimentary bread and water was delivered to the tables.  Menus were already placed on the tables. I had to study the menu since I was undecided of what to order.  Should I order pasta, burger, sandwich, steak, or seafood dishes.  I opted to order the Shrimp Scampi with Steak Diane.  The dish comes with mashed potatoes.  I didn't know that I ordered the same dish as one of my dinner companions. My dinner was delicious.  My dinner companions noticed since I cleaned the entire plate minus the gravy.  Did I have room for dessert...nope.  I was stuffed from my meal and the complimentary bread.  Plus I drank two full cups of water. I should have stood in line near the front of the restaurant to order a slice of cheesecake to go.  Too many flavors to choose from...one day I'll go back for the cheesecake dessert. 194/200 Review #400"
Vicky L.,"Honolulu, HI",1,6,9,5.0,9/6/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! There are plenty of options for everyone. I enjoy the vegan Cobb salad, miso salmon, chicken club & their sangrias ! I also recommend asking for their brown bread, it's more tastier and softer than the white.  Service with Kijung is always amazing, he shares his honest opinions & options. My food always comes out enjoyable, considering that I'm a picky eater.  If I lived by Waikiki, I would go way too often!"
Katherine L.,"Niu Valley, Honolulu, HI",46,123,134,5.0,1/3/2017,"We went at around 5:00, hoping it would be early enough since there's always a long wait when we pass by. We haven't been here in years. There was a line and some people waiting outside with beepers. They got through the line quickly and were able to seat us immediately. We only had 2 people and they have many tables for parties of 2. The waitress was friendly, attentive, and efficient. The staff also cleared tables that left next to us within literally 30 seconds of the people leaving. They also brought new parties to those tables quickly. Super efficient. The food sizes and quality were pretty good, and the prices are similar to those in Waikiki. I think they do validate parking, but we just park at the zoo parking lot and walk around. We got the spinach artichoke dip, a burger, the chicken tacos, and two lemonades. We over ordered, because my boyfriend thought the portions would be smaller, even though I told him that they were decent sized portions. We missed out on the cheesecake this time but will return for it!"
Danielle M.,"Waianae, HI",0,127,280,4.0,12/23/2017,Been here numerous times for lunch and dinner over the years. Be prepared to wait a hr or two if going for dinner. Lunch is easier wait times in the past was only 0-20 mins. Food is always great no matter what we order. Parking is a pain in Waikiki but we jus find the nearest garage which is on Royal Hawaiian and walk it. Ambiance is nice but kind of on the dark side for me.
Tami M.,"Honolulu, HI",152,159,679,5.0,6/19/2017,"Visited for lunch with my friend who had a gift card. We were greeted and seated with little wait time. Servers were very attentive and kept our drink glasses full. Warm bread assortment was brought out and was delish. We decided to share the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll and the Bistro Shrimp. The tempura roll was very yummy. Perfectly fried, not oily, and generously filled. The pasta was also amazing. Loved how the shrimp were prepared. We finished off our meal with a slice of the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake. I have always been a fan of their cheesecake and this visit  was no different. Amazing cheesecake! Amazing food! Amazing service! This visit was the best so far. Dined a handful of times and have never been this wow'd."
Angel H.,"Honolulu, HI",971,834,7664,4.0,11/29/2016,"I love cheesecake. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when the Cheesecake Factory came to Waikiki. I've eaten here a couple of times and the wait is always horrendous. It's always been at least an hour. This latest time, I was quoted half an hour and was seated within the half hour. Yay! I prefer coming for lunch. Their dinner portions are huge. I like to come for their lunch specials. It's pretty much what they serve for dinner, but at smaller portions and cheaper prices. I love their Chinese Chicken Salad. I always, always get the Miso Salmon on mashed potatoes. It's the best Miso Salmon I've ever had in my life. The miso is slightly sweetened and contains mirin. Even though it's the lunch portion, I still can't finish it. I take the leftovers for my dinner.  My favorite cheesecake is White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut. This time I decided to try the Fresh Strawberry. Both are good, but go with the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut. It sounds sweet, but it really isn't. It's more rich than anything else."
I-ta-da-ki-mas U.,"Wailuku, HI",4,80,59,5.0,11/4/2017,"5-stars for really great wait service!! It's a Cheesecake Factory...they are everywhere and the food is consistent of their chain.  This location is ESPECIALLY busy because it's in the middle of Waikiki so expect to wait if your party is greater than 2, otherwise small parties are seated pretty quickly. Visited twice because it was convenient to where we were staying and because the kids dig it.  Kid menu items for children aged 10 and under with large portions for less than $10.00 - a real deal in Waikiki; kid drinks are unlimited.   The wait and buss staff are excellent - even in the face of the daily/nightly chaos they still smile and are friendly and make you feel welcomed.  The hosts/hostesses don't make eye contact, aren't friendly, and made us feel like it was a chore to seat us each time we were there."
Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",460,953,11173,4.0,11/25/2016,"It's been years since I've been to The Cheesecake Factory! And I wanna say I probably haven't been back here for over 10 years or so........ I remembered a time when The Cheesecake Factory had first opened in Waikiki back in 2003, and I went with my ohana to dine here several times.  All I remembered about The Cheesecake Factory was that they served pretty simple food, they gave huge portions, & the cheesecake was legit! It's now 2016, so I decided to come back here for lunch with a friend, as I figured if I go here during the weekday, it wouldn't be too crowded. Sure enough this place is still popular as when we arrived just before the opening time of 11:00 AM, there was a long line of customers waiting by the entrance door.  Lucky for us, since the restaurant is huge, we did not have to wait at all, and was seated right away. Shortly after, our server stopped by to drop off menus, & take our drink order.  After checking out the menu, I decided to get the - Super Antioxidant Salad which was a delicious blend of salad greens, spinach, kale, avocado, broccoli, grapes, roasted pear, blueberries, onion, sunflower seeds & almonds, with a lemon-blueberry vinaigrette dressing. I also added some grilled chicken to my salad to boost my protein intake.  With my salad, I ordered an ice tea to wash all of this down. My friend ended up ordering the - The Classic Burger, which was a gigantic chop house hamburger. Served with a slice of grilled onion, lettuce, tomato and you can either get french fries, or green salad. Which my friend ended up with the green salad. Of course when you go to The Cheesecake Factory, you have to order some of their delicious cheesecakes! They have such a large selection of cheesecakes, I have to admit, it's pretty hard to decide on which cheesecake to order.  At the end, I ordered the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake - which was a Banana Cream Cheesecake topped with bavarian cream, and it came with fresh sliced banana.  My friend got the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake - which was layers of creamy vanilla bean cheesecake, vanilla mousse & it was topped with whipped cream. What can I say about the grub? I really loved my Super Antioxidant Salad! It was the perfect meal which didn't leave me bloated, or too full..........having that salad saved me some space in my tummy for dessert! (See, you gotta plan your eating!).  The salad was not only pleasant to look at, but also the mixture of greens with the dressing was the perfect match! The grilled chicken was kinda bland, but I just ordered it to boost my protein intake, so I was okay with it! My friend enjoy the burger.........and the side salad was good too! As for the cheesecake desserts.............there is nothing bad tasting on their cheesecake menu. Whatever you order here, you cannot go wrong!  Overall, the prices for the food here at The Cheesecake Factory is kinda pricey for lunch, as I paid $58.00 for lunch (with tip), but the service here was great! Our server was very attentive, refilled our drinks, & checked on us often. A great dining experience!"
Mia A.,"Waipahu, HI",67,50,85,3.0,8/10/2017,"This place is always busy so make sure you plan ahead. This place is very big therefore it's always loud because of the amount of people. Can't really have a quite conversation because you feel like your always screaming.  Service was a little slow. Food was average. I always get the bistro shrimp pasta. The shrimp has too much batter, pasta is drowning in sauce which I wasn't a fan off but the flavor was there. My boyfriend ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta which according to him was good but nothing special.  But cheesecake is always BOMB!!"
Nate And Cait L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,40,8,4.0,12/22/2017,"Came here for dinner the other day around 5:00pm on a Wednesday. Didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a party of 2, but it was definitely crowded! We enjoyed the avocado egg rolls, the vegan cobb salad, and Evelyn's pasta. All three menu items were vegan and delicious. There are lots of vegetarian options, but NO dairy free or egg free desserts besides being offered ""a side of strawberries"". You'd think such a large company who specializes in cheesecakes would make at least one cheesecake that is vegan. This is the case for this establishment across the country, so it isn't a dig at this location, just an overall observation!"
D.W. L.,"Honolulu, HI",1,18,5,3.0,1/6/2018,"Big menu, big portions, moderate prices. Chicken Madeira was more sweet than savory, but the steak Diane was spot on tasty and tender medium rare. 2 hours of free parking at the royal hawaiian - go for an early dinner (4pm) after surfing so you can avoid the line"
Kendal I.,"Burbank, CA",0,6,1,2.0,11/6/2017,Poor service. We ordered takeaway over the phone to save waiting in line when we got here. They said that was fine on the phone.  When we got here we asked the welcome people where to pick up our order. They said join a long queue. Bit annoying but oh well it's a popular place.  Anyway after twenty minutes in the line we get to the front. They say oh you're in the wrong line. And sent us to the real line finally. Another five minutes wait and finally our order is with us. Full disclosure... Yet to try the cake.  Update. Cake is ok but very very rich and a bit sickly!
Laura G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,9,18,5.0,11/13/2017,"This is a fun classy place for a date or the whole family.  The cheesecake is amazing!!!  I like how there are many options on the menu.  It was my Birthday celebration tonight and we stopped in for dessert... Normally we wait forever for a table but we got right in tonight.  The server had them put happy Birthday on my plate with a candle, it was very fun.  Everything tastes so good here."
Lei K.,"Honolulu, HI",3,83,6,5.0,10/1/2017,"Service: awesome service our server Rayanne was awesome. Always checked on us and was very accommodating. Great personality and genuinely sweet.  Food: our food was very tasty and we enjoyed it. My husband and I ordered a bistro shrimp pasta . Very flavorful and the crunch of the shrimp added great texture to the pasta. Loved it! My husband ordered a burger on sourdough and he was happy with it,  I would recommend eating here. The food is good. The service is awesome."
Jerry E.,"Honolulu, HI",11,273,1166,5.0,7/15/2017,"What a great place to have a good meal in Waikiki! Didn't know the size of this place until my recent visit; it actually stretched to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel because we were able to observe activities there while seated. The food portion was pretty good size and very tasty. I was surprised to tasted their delicious Steak Diane cooked in medium rare. It definitely rival that of a steakhouse. Too bad that we inadvertently ordered too much, and were unable to check out their dessert that looked so appealing. Will definitely give this place another try."
Sandy C.,"San Marcos, CA",40,85,50,5.0,9/30/2017,Cheesecake Factory by far the best place in Hawaii to come and have lunch or dinner! Great place to hang out with friends or family. The customer service is great. Our server was Seth and he was attentive making sure we were ok-  This place is a bit packed but if you come with time you are fine !! The wait was not too long.
Juliet D.,"Waikīkī, Honolulu, HI",0,4,,4.0,12/23/2017,Very friendly staff and prompt service. Soooo many options to choose from but done really well. Would definitely suggest the fish and chips and if you have room to squeeze in more- their signature key lime cheesecake
Richard A.,"Branford, CT",11,202,354,5.0,7/2/2017,"Had fresh vegetable salad with asparagus, green beans, tomato, cucumber, roasted beets, apple, edamame, radicchio, romaine, white cheddar, with brown bread and vinaigrette dressing. The salad was the appetizer size which was plenty big . It was very tasty. Ate at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and efficient. The brown bread was also delicious"
Liezel A.,"Kaneohe, HI",347,46,367,1.0,5/7/2017,Tonight we decided to come down here after we had some drinks. The wait time was 40 minutes and we were like sure.  We waited and it buzz on time. We sat at our seats and they offer water and breads. We order our food. Chicken piccata and gumbo.  They offer bread again while we wait. We waited and waited for a hour for our food. My boyfriend food was hot and my food wasn't. I told the waitress what happen and if they can comp the food. The manager came and say they can make a new one for me and I wanted them to pay for my food because I waited for a hour and my food was cold. They are only going to give free cheesecake. I was like omg. Is that all you can do me. So I gave my food back so they won't charge me.  I've been to other restaurant and when your food is bad they comp your meal and try to make it memorable.  Why only give free cheesecake. I'm not a happy camper.  Well I don't know if I'm going to come back here because they might forget about my food. Thanks cheesecake for making this visit memorable for me.  I know I won't be back. Peace out cheesecake your services suck. Mahalo.
