Grace L.,"Honolulu, HI",221,319,387,4.0,1/27/2014,"The cheesecake factor always has its good and bad days, simply because it caters to such a large crowd of people. First off, it's located in Waikiki, which means you will most likely be waiting 2 hours at dinner time.  It's such a pain but sometimes it's the only place that works for everyone because they serve such a wide variety of foods- soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, pizza, seafood, steak, etc.  The list goes on and on. My favorite dish is probably the Luau Salad.  It's really fresh and filling, and I'm a huge fan of the crunchy wonton that comes with it.  I also loooove their baked potato soup (but their soups change daily).  I could eat a bowl of soup and bread and be completely satisfied.  THEY MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH! I asked.. Their sweet potato fries are good as a side.  And I also like their herb salmon, which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Their kalua pig pizza and four cheese pasta is good too but both are heavy heavy dishes so be wary! You guys all know about the cheesecake so I don't have to convince you on that.  I personally just like the strawberry one or the blueberry one, but I'm a simple cheesecake girl like that. Service is usually pretty good and so is the food.  But it's crazy busy all the time so I think sometimes that can affect the service and the food.  It's good if you want somewhere that is decently nice but not too expensive.  The only annoyance I have is that it's always too busy and you have to park in the royal hawaiian.  They validate for sure but it's only two hours and you're usually waiting for 2 hours just to get into the restaurant.  You'll have to pay for parking beyond 2 hours."
Laura S.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,,1.0,6/21/2017,"I liked going to The Cheesecake Factory and the food is good so the review is about my customer service experience only. My spouse had surgery on Sunday and is recovering in bed this week. My spouse has to eat lots of protein after the surgery so we thought the Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken from The Cheesecake Factory would be nice. The restaurant is about 20 minutes walking distance from our home so I went. When I arrived and placed my order, my card didn't go through and the employee who rigned up my card said he has never seen this kind of error before. So he called the manager. She also tried and then asked if I have another card. I said I don't and that I don't have problems with this card. I asked if she can ring it up on another machine and all she said was sorry, the other machine is the same. She didn't even try or listen when I said this card works and there is no issue. So since I already walked all the way to The Cheesecake Factory I didn't want to come back home empty-handed, so I went across the street to the California Pizza Kitchen where I had no problems at all ordering with the same card!"
Jenny O.,"Mililani, HI",53,115,165,4.0,4/3/2016,"Recently went for breakfast while staying in Waikiki for Easter weekend. Walked right in, no line like at night which is usually an hour to and hour & 1/2 minimum. Great breakfast menu options as well as the rest of the menu which was also available. Their serving sizes always seem big and were with breakfast too, I always feel like I get my money's worth here. Got the eggs Benedict and it was really good. Our server was friendly and we got our food fast. Will definitely be back for breakfast here again."
Ehl T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",12,6,28,5.0,4/24/2016,"My Wife and i came to eat dinner. We got Seated right away. Our waitress was Sacarra. She was great, our food came out Fast. Food was delicious. We also got the Godiva cheesecake which was super good."
C L.,"Wilmington, DE",0,1,,1.0,6/15/2017,"Food was ok. Waitress super rude, we barely got any service but she demanded us to tip and taught us how much to tip and immediately checked how much we tipped before we get out of our seats... SOOOOOOOO RUDE!"
Aadhraa M.,"Union City, CA",5,21,2,1.0,4/23/2016,"Cheesecake Factory has always amazed me with its mouthwatering dishes,prompt services and huge portions.. But today, one of the server's ruined my night. He never cared to attend to our needs ,or would walk the other way when we tried to call him for something n was reluctant to hear what we had to say. On a close watch ,to know why the attitude,he seemed to be very friendly and polite with the other customers and as soon as we called him for something,his face would show displeasure. Now thats racial!! I couldn't even eat my food because I was very upset with his behavior. Ruined my holiday trip!! Am sorry I had to give one star because of just this one person!"
Carmen K.,"Honolulu, HI",201,13,3,3.0,8/28/2016,"I've been to plenty of cheesecake factories in my life, specially living on the mainland so I'm not new to their menu/service. The Lines were relatively short (15-20mins tops) for such a busy place, and they just have one bench to wait inside, but there is lots of space outside where you can sit and comfortably wait!  The service was ok, our server was Muhammad S., he forgot to give us our drinks (which were water) before our appetizers came through, but the lady that dropped our food was kind enough to get them for us right away, so that was nice! I think it was the manager that stopped by shortly after to apologize, it really wasn't a big deal though, Muhammad refilled our drinks often enough from then on and was relatively aware so YAY!  The food was AMAZING as always, makes it all worth it so kudos to the cooks, they're the real MVPs! It did take FOREVER for it to come, but it only makes sense with such a big busy restaurant.  As for the seats, this definitely isn't a place you go with a date, so make sure that you request a more private booth or something, you're better off finding more privacy sitting at the bar! The seats for 2 are actually a booth on one side and a chair on the other and these are in a row with maybe 2ft in between each set. I could literally hear CLEARLY every conversation from the couple next to me on both sides and the ones next to them and next to them. I did see some more 'private' seats but they were for 3ppl or more, and with the restaurant always so busy, they try to use those for that many people ONLY.  Overall, Mehhhh, not impressed but not crazy disappointed either. I'd come"
Christian S.,"Honolulu, HI",167,12,14,1.0,4/2/2016,Waited 3 hours when they said 2. Plus the stupid ass pager didn't work.  They said there was a runner that called us but I didn't hear shit.  Fuck this place.  Not the first time this happened.
Harry H.,"Honolulu, HI",2,56,31,1.0,1/19/2016,"RIP OFF WARNING!  Nicole from the cheesecake take out counter took my girlfriends order. My girlfriend speaks broken English so Nicole may have mistaken her for a tourist. Order total was $16.20 but she only received $0.80 change.  She corrected Nicole's error and received the correct change, though Nicole wasn't exactly pleasant about the correction.  In hindsight, I think it may have been malicious with all the foreign tourists who pass through there. Of course it's impossible for us to know for sure, but be sure to count your change! On a side note, the cheesecake was delicious as usual."
Sungjin S.,"Honolulu, HI",157,162,428,4.0,2/20/2015,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories and I have been to the waikiki one several times. We were in the area and decided to stop by for lunch. Atmosphere: Standard cheesecake factory decor. Many booths and plenty of seating. I don't know how they handle all the customers but they do a great job. Service: Our waitress was top notch. Very friendly and always available. No issues with our orders.  Food: The menu is humongous! It's like the restaurant, but I just don't know how they manage to produce good quality and fresh food in such short time with the menu as large as it is. They really are a factory. I ordered the buffalo wings, caesar salad and pesto chicken pizza. I enjoyed my entire meal and everyone else at the table was also very happy. Intangibles: I typically don't care for chain restaurants but when they do such a good job like this Cheesecake factory I can't help but like it. I would recommend going here to anyone who is looking for consistent good food."
Celina Mae C.,"Honolulu, HI",202,22,5,3.0,10/6/2016,"The wait was atrocious, we literally waited two hours... The service was fast and friendly but the quality of the food was not that of what I would expect from other restaurants, overall ok."
Joy C.,"Kapolei, HI",53,13,24,4.0,10/30/2016,"Brunch is yum! Big portions....so should hold you over till dinner, especially if you eat the bread"
Myra R.,"Pearl City, HI",14,45,16,4.0,8/1/2016,Good food ! Had the French toast and red velvet cheesecake! Always a favorite!  park at the royal Hawaiians and be sure to get validated.
Chris D.,"Hilo, HI",69,41,,5.0,5/20/2017,Another fabulous dinner at one of my favorite restaurants.i think this is like my 4th time here and they never disappoint .  There was a 30 minute wait which is understandable . It's Friday night.  I was greeted with aloha by the hostess and the waitress was fast and efficient.  Ordered my food and got it in 5 minutes.  I ordered the 4 cheese pasta which was heavenly and and a original cheesecake to take with me .  It's a must stop for me when visiting Waikiki.
Kurt N.,"Waipahu, HI",213,263,71,3.0,2/25/2014,Date of Visit: 2/18/14 Occasion: My wife's cousin's last day in Hawaii before she went back to ice cold Canada. I don't have much to say about this place because it's always busy and I hate waiting.  What makes up for it is the Hibachi Steak...nuff sed!  The awesome fried tempura asparagus with mashed potatoes goes well with the hanger steak which is drenched with some sort of teri (asian) sauce...yum!!! Probably won't be back here because I don't like waiting...my tummy can never wait.  The Hibachi Steak saves this review :)
Kelly L.,"Safety Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",3,181,241,4.0,3/7/2016,"I know, I know...""You get all the way to Honolulu and you're eating at the Cheesecake Factory??""  I've heard it before!  But hey, I'm not coming to this place for any ordinary reason.  This place is known for making one of the BEST mai tai's I've had on Waikiki!  No doubt!  They are by far the best!  Mix it in with a little fresh bread and their baja chicken tacos, and it's a match made in heaven! The ambiance is nice with the tiki torches out front.  Everything else is pretty standard for a good ol' Cheesecake factory, including the wait.  A trick for this location, in particular, sit at the bar! There's no putting your feet in the sand here, but that is one kick a$$ drink!"
Debra Ann E.,"San Antonio, TX",151,65,53,5.0,2/10/2016,"Other than the expected one hour wait for a party of seven, our service was over the top. I wish I got our waitress's name but I was so busy tending to my newborn that it was the last thing on my mind. She was very friendly and always checked up on us since she knew I didn't get a chance to eat the complimentary bread or if we needed anything extra. She upsized my older son's drink rather than giving him the kids size cup. She offered to bring a cup of hot water to sanitize my baby's two pacifiers that dropped during our dinner. I haven't been to a restaurant lately that went over and beyond to check up on our family considering we had three young kids with us. Although they didn't have my meatloaf dish available or the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake I love, this place deserves five stars due to her outstanding service."
Samantha R.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,,1.0,6/25/2016,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD! Okay so I have been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times before and we had excellent service and everything I tried before was very good but this last time we went we had HORRIBLE customer service. Our waitress we had didn't seem in the best mood and wasn't the friendliest(which of course I understand we all have our bad days and that place gets crazy busy). Anyways we ordered our food and I order a pasta dish I've never tried before it was the Four Cheese Pasta(it normally comes with marinara but I asked for Alfredo sauce instead and it didn't seem to be a problem). I got my order and just decided I really did not like it so I asked our waitress if I would be able to switch it out for something different that I've had before and I knew I for sure liked(and no I don't normally do this at restaurants) and she said yeah sure no problem. Well then about 5 minutes later I see this guy(pretty sure he was a manager, I'm not sure though) come out with my same pasta dish that I asked if I could switch out and he says ""so you made us do a special order for you, this item on our menu is a special request item(which I didn't know I guess I didn't read the fine print closely enough), and now you don't want?"" I said well I don't really like it to much I'm sorry I can just keep it, it's fine. He said ""alright I'll just box it up for you then"". He left the table and our waitress comes by a couple seconds later and I asked for her to just cancel my other order then because I don't really want to pay for two dishes and she said alrighty no problem. Then about 10 minutes later the guy walks up to our table with our bill, my to go box, and the other dish in a box that I asked her to please cancel it and he said ""well here's your quesadilla, do you still want it or do you just want me to throw it away?"" And I told him that I told our waitress to cancel it and he said ""well we made it so what do you want me to do with it?"" I said well I don't want to pay for two dishes sir I'm sorry I don't know what else to tell you. He said ""alright I'll just got throw it away"" and then gave us our bill and left the table. I was so angry with the tone he was using with us, the way he handle the whole situation...I was just shaking so bad because I did not know what to say to him or how to even handle the whole situation. Any other restaurants I've ever been to and end up not liking a dish they either offer to switch it out or take the dish off the bill entirely and are very nice and respectful about it. I will never go to this Cheesecake Factory again even though I love most of their food."
Eu Gene G.,"Camarillo, CA",9,6,2,5.0,9/18/2016,Me and my family have been eating here every week back in 2010-2012. The food is always great. You can never go wrong with this restaurant. I love the atmosphere. We always eat at the patio to smell the ocean and feel the aloha vibe. Wait times can go to at least an hour but the area has a bunch of stores to kill time with. The wait is worth it! Sadly I had to move to California but every time I visit my family we never miss to eat at Cheesecake Factory. I will always come back here!!
Laiani J.,"Cranebrook, Australia",3,6,2,4.0,11/8/2016,"If you're looking for a reasonably priced restaurant in Hawaii that will fill you up and even let you take home a doggy bag of leftovers then this is the place. Not crazy expensive and the meals are so large you really get 2 meals worth, so good value. A bit crowded and noisy as it's so big and busy and if you don't have a booth then you do sit a little too close to neighbouring tables for my liking. I had the strawberry cheesecake, it wasn't bad just ordinary but I think if you go you should choose a fancier one and make it worth the visit."
