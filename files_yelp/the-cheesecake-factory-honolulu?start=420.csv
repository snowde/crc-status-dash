Hanson D.,"Vancouver, Canada",124,255,4,3.0,3/13/2016,"Nosh and Nibble came here for a late dinner and I had a great taste of the following: French Country Salad ($10) Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken ($16.50) Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo ($18) Before any of this started though, we were greeted with a (freely refillable) basket of bread. I'm usually not a big fan of filling up on carbs but there was a good variety to choose from here. Each ready-to-split piece was quite chewy and moist. Easy on the butter if you can help it though since generally there is a lot to come. The French Country Salad came with mixed greens, grilled asparagus, beets, goat cheese, candied pecans, and vinaigrette. The acidity from the vinaigrette is what made all the other ingredients stand out. Each bite was quite tasty but I wish there were a few more beets to be found since they were claimed to be so fresh. The Parmesan-Herb Crusted Chicken was a plate of sautéed chicken breasts coated with parmesan-garlic. On the outside these looked like cute hamburger patties but they were actually made of kitchen. The sauce had unfortunately sploshed around on my plate by the time it arrived which soiled the presentation a bit. Taste-wise, the bread crumbs added a nice texture but the chicken was a bit dry in some places. There was enough sauce to compensate, but I don't think this sauce compensation should be a long-term solution. My favourite plate of the evening was the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. This was a mixed plate of shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic simmered in a spicy cajun style broth with cream and topped with steamed white rice. This was a very exciting dish as it came, though I feel the herb bits scattered around the white rim of the plate should have been kept to the middle ring. This tasted great though! The meats were all cooked very well and while the other two dishes were a bit of a miss for me, this gumbo was good enough to salvage any meal."
therese m.,"Irvine, CA",196,69,13,4.0,9/3/2016,Awesome service. It's a shame the pasta we ordered had too much salt. Always crowded because it's in the middle of Waikiki and it's the only Cheesecake Factory on the island. Two thumbs up otherwise.
Alizabeth H.,"Honolulu, HI",118,93,287,5.0,5/14/2015,My number one place to eat! Love the Godiva cheese cake. I come in to Waikiki just to get my cheese cake fix from here.   You can park by the Sheraton public parking and get validated at the restaurant.  It's a nice walk from the parking to the restaurant through royal Hawaiian shopping center. I love the food. Can't get enough! The wait is super long. Every night the wait is long.  Saturdays are the busiest time and you will wait 1.5 hours before being seated. Its crazy.
Lib A.,"Honolulu, HI",12,32,88,4.0,8/19/2016,"08/14/16 dear The Cheesecake Factory... second time here and there was a short line to sign in and tons of parking.. yay...  We ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese (again) and Made to Order Guacamole and Chips to start... For our meals we ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta; Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane (again) and the Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger.. Fried Mac & Cheese:  just as good as the first time.. yummers... Made to Order Guacamole (medium heat) and Chips:  Super fresh and chunky guacamole that came with lots of freshly made chips... it also came with a side of sour cream and salsa.. super yummers... the Louisiana Chicken Pasta:  ""better than the jambalaya and not as spicy.."" the Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane:  ""yummers"".. three medallions of medium cooked steak with three jumbo shrimp and mashed red potatoes... i'm a creature of habit... the Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger: ""eh, it was okay... BCD is better""..  good thing for uncle Lane someone is loyal to his burgers... lol Cheesecakes: White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut; Kahlua Cocoa Coffee; and Fresh Banana Cream...  We were so stuffed again... lol.. But we learned from the last time and since we were going to walk around a bit (read: go Pokemon hunting), we stopped by the cheesecake counter before we left waikiki and ordered them to take home for later... Service: the Good - Our server this time around (sorry i forgot what his name was) was really attentive...  Our waters and drinks were filled when they were half empty and he even brought more bread without us asking for more... the Bad - the the thing that really bothered me were THE BIRDS.. AGAIN!  I really wanted to ask for a different table INSIDE but didn't want to be that customer and have our meals come with any extra toppings.. the SUPER BAD - the only other thing that I found somewhat disturbing was a server (who wasn't the server for this particular table) asking (read: telling) a japanese couple that the cash they left in the check holder would cover the bill but did they want to leave a tip for their server...  when they couldn't understand what he asking he reiterated that they could leave a tip if the service was 1-star, 2-star, 3-star according to the suggested tip guide on the bill...  frustrated, the couple just handed the server some cash and just walked away... verdict:  we'll be back again..."
Reid I.,"Aiea, HI",7,256,621,4.0,2/16/2016,We came at 4:30pm on a weekday afternoon and was told the wait will be 45 minutes. We expected there would be a wait so we already planned to take care of some business beforehand. They gave a  buzzer that would let us know when the table was ready. The time they told us the wait is always a good estimate. Ordered the Garlic noodles with chicken. It was delicious and ate every last bite. I enjoyed the oreo cheesecake for dessert. Good service and food comes out fairly quickly.
Richard N.,"Honolulu, HI",6,6,6,5.0,10/6/2014,"First time at the Cheesecake factory and wow was it busy. They don't make any reservations so it's all walk ins. I mean the wait time was an hour and a half to 2 hours long! They said the best time to come was either before 5:30 pm or after 9:30 pm. I came in around 9:30 pm and they said it was only 20 minutes. That was fine considering there were many stores around that I could check out while I waited.  The atmosphere...set the mood the the restaurant. The music was a little loud when you first walk in, so you couldn't really hear the hostesses. But getting to your table the music kind of died down a little. The lighting of the restaurant was dimmed all around with the tables having their own lights shown on then.  The menu...was crazy! 21 pages of over 200 different varieties of items to choose from! I really don't know how the server would remember all of that. But apparently she told me that they have an excellent training program.  The food...was pretty good but not what I expected. I ordered the filet mignon, which is one of my favorite steaks. Normally the filet is suppose to be a lean cut of steak with no fat to it, just all meat. But the one here is the first ever filet that I've found some fat in. I mean it was good, but it could've been better without the fat.  For desert, I was suggested either the banana cream cheesecake or the key lime cheesecake. I ordered the banana cream and it was amazing! I'd say that one cheesecake is enough for one to two people. So if you order, try and get different types and share! They are known for their cheesecakes after all.  The value...of my food could've been better. Typically the price of a filet is around $29.95 - $32.95. I dint think that it was with it for the filet, however, the Cheesecake was amazing! And the value of my service was excellent! My server was Olivia and she really knew her stuff. She was very attentive and made sure all her tables got what they needed. She answered many of the questions that I had about the menu and that really impressed me since there are a lot of options on there. And congratulations to her! She is due to give birth in 6 weeks!  As I was leaving the restaurant I spoke with one of the managers named Bryan and told him about my experience. He was also very knowledgeable about the restaurant. He gave me some good tips about how to be successful in opening up your own restaurant.  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant. But if you do decide to go, go in either before 5:30 pm or after 9:30 pm. If you need to go on between this time, it's fine, since you can go shopping or walking around waikiki to kill some time."
Arielle W.,"San Diego, CA",124,34,21,4.0,12/23/2015,"Great service, familiar food.  We got a little tired of local food...at least for a few hours. So we decided to just have some good ol' cheesecake factory. Beware, the line is so crazy here. We only waited about 10 min for two, but larger parties could be up to two hours regularly.  Portions are big, drinks are good!"
Syvannah O.,"Chinatown, Honolulu, HI",377,94,305,2.0,11/2/2015,The wait is ridiculous! We waited nearly 3 hours just to be seated and over an hour for order. We arrived at 6:30 and didn't eat till after 10. A lot of our orders were wrong. It's really not worth the hype! I use to love coming to the Cheesecake Factory but their service has definitely slower. It's probably better to go during lunch when it's slower. Don't go during dinner unless you've already ate b/c by the time you get your meal you'll be starving
Brigitte S.,"Honolulu, HI",600,367,5709,4.0,11/24/2014,"I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years but we recently found an old gift card & decided to out it to good use. We chose to go for Saturday lunch right at noon in hopes of beating the rush.... we luckily did and got a lovely booth in the back where it was quiet and we had a view out an open window. I decided since it was the weekend (and almost time for vacation) to treat myself to a couple bloody Mary's. They were actually very good; super spicy & just enough booze kick. Zing, good morning! ;) My boyfriend and I both went with lunch specials. I think people need to remember what great desks they are - good prices & lunch size portions and combos from the regular menu. My man went with Renees Special - salad, 1/2 chicken-almond salad sandwich (or fresh turkey) and a bowl of soup of the the day, which happened to be baked potato. I went with the pizza & salad combo, the Portofino pizza sounded right up my alley at that moment. You can pay $1 to upgrade your salad to ceasar PS. My pizza had basil almond pesto, grilled chicken, calabrian peppers & three different cheeses. Fresh & toasty delicious! My garden salad had a really beautiful light dressing & lots of tomato. Boyfriends caesar was classic; the almond-chicken salad sandwich was way bigger than expected & on buttered toast that was mouthwatering by itself. The baked potato soup was extremely creamy & tasty with lots of chunky potato and crumbed bacon. You knew it had to be high calorie but you couldn't stop licking the spoon. We were both very satisfied and at a good price. We had to finish off the meal with cheesecake of course so we went with chocolate chip cookie dough. NOMNOMNOM!! We had great service and our waitress was friendly. She was obviously well trained. This wasn't a five star dining experience but we had a lovely tasty meal in Waikiki without feeling totally like a tourist without breaking the bank. I remembered why I used to love coming here :) As we were leaving we saw a crowd coming so timing is important but definitely a good meal. Also...Lunch specials are served til 5pm FTW."
Robert W.,"Hudson, WI",0,2,,5.0,4/5/2017,Quality comfort food with excellent service.  We were wanting food that was wholesome and tasty. Finished with the Carmel Mac nut cheesecake.  Very satisfied.
Luana S.,"Lakeside, CA",0,13,,4.0,4/26/2017,The place was super busy at 8pm.  There was an hour wait.  We found room at the back bar and had our dinner at the bar with no waiting time.  The bartender was super friendly and we got our food quickly.  I had a club sandwich and it was the best I have had.
Kalani F.,"Seattle, WA",145,376,,2.0,1/6/2016,"Like most cheesecake factories, which I usually love, except for this one downfall of the location: sitting in the dark. When a healthy woman without eyesight problems can't read the menu, it's a problem. It is really dark in this joint. Maybe someone forgot to pay the electricity bills when I was in there?"
Michael P.,"Fort Worth, TX",59,6,,4.0,10/21/2016,"I know long lines & Cheese Cake Factory , go together. Be it , ATL, Cleveland, Ft.Worth. The service, food & lines, make this well worth the wait. You want fast-food , go to Taco Bell."
Stefanie N.,"Honolulu, HI",25,105,712,5.0,1/31/2015,"I thought the only thing to eat here were the cheesecakes...and salads. Cheesecakes and salads...then I ate the Rib-Eye. OMG. Have a salad, have the Rib-Eye and don't forget the cheesecake. Life is good."
Mika C.,"Chino Hills, CA",12,21,55,3.0,11/19/2015,"Stumbled across CF while visiting Honolulu. We decided to dine in with high hopes they would have our favorite cheesecake- Pineapple Upside Down. Considering the Pineapple Plantation is a short drive, we were certain they would have it!! we were wrong and so disappointed ;( Overall, the service was good. Pleasantly surprised there was no wait, was seated upon arrival . Food and drinks consistent with other CF locations."
Lynne M.,"San Marcos, CA",3,13,5,5.0,10/15/2016,"I had miso salad and my husband had the vegan salad, delicious. The Damon was cooked to perfection. No wait to eat. This was lunch menu. Tiffany waited on us. She was fast, friendly. She was right on top of things."
Megan S.,"Chicago, IL",38,278,47,4.0,9/27/2014,"We arrived in Waikiki late and I was starving as LAX has no GF options.  I didn't even care what I ate, just wanted food in my belly.  I ordered a burger and fries (yay for gf buns).  M ordered some pasta dish and pot-stickers.  All of it was phenomenal.  The server was great Our last day we decided to stop again.  The server was horrendous.  He was lost, screwing up everyone's orders around us.  We waited 20 minutes for our avocado and crab app.  I ended up ordering the burger again.  I never did get any ranch.   Finally I just asked for the bill because we had been there for 2 hours for a LUNCH."
Ray L.,"Honolulu, HI",29,347,11127,5.0,11/9/2014,This is a great place for fun dining.  Make sure you go early to avoid the crowds.
Kristine R.,"Chicago, IL",500,86,74,2.0,9/14/2014,"This is the only Cheesecake Factory on the island so when I am craving their cheesecake, I have to go out of my way and go to Waikiki, which I try to never do.  Came here on a Saturday night around 5pm... Never again! The hostess said the wait time would be 45 minutes for a table for 2 and we waited almost 2 hours.  They have good food and I LOVE their cheesecake, but the wait time is not worth it unless you don't mind the wait. I had a gift card there so I used it all up the next day and just got takeout which was faster. It's so crazy busy here that the service is not that great but how can you blame them! It's a zoo here on the weekends!  I always get the Fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken, broccoli and portobello mushrooms and I never finish it because the portions are huge! I think my new favorite dish here is their tempura fish tacos. Oh. My. Gosh. To die for!!! Great to eat during happy hour. And their cheesecakes speak for themselves so I don't have to say too much about that.  Also, they validate parking for the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center parking garage for up to 2 hours. Still had to pay though because I was waiting for a table for 2 hours :( boo."
Anela G.,"Honolulu, HI",55,76,112,4.0,1/22/2016,"We ate here twice before this time. Both of those times we had a not so good experience. However, this trip was amazing. Food was great, service was great."
