Dine L.,"Mililani, HI",153,87,39,4.0,8/17/2016,"I've tried at least half of the cheesecakes on the menu, and have never been disappointed! This place does its name justice. I havent tried many of the lunch/dinner options though, I will usually just get a salad so I can enjoy dessert! Only con is that the wait is always long, but I say its worth it if you're craving cheesecake!"
Shadia W.,"Honolulu, HI",75,6,,5.0,4/20/2016,The food is always good here and the staff is always friendly... The line is always a bit long but besides that I have no complaints. What can you really expect with such an awesome place that everyone wants to eat at. Besides the AWESOME variety of Cheesecakes i totally LOVE the MOJITOS they have... One of my Favorite and affordable places to eat when I'm in Waikiki
Haley V.,"Lakewood, CO",99,48,13,5.0,9/14/2016,"Very pleased with our experience at this location! Our wait was about an hour which we were totally fine with since we are on our honeymoon and we are very understanding of wait times. Our waiter was Santana (I believe) and he was WONDERFUL! Very fun and friendly! Food was of course delicious! No surprise there! This was a nice place to eat at for a change considering it's a lot more affordable compared to many of the restaurants near by. So if you need a little break on high prices for dinner, this is a nice alternative while still having yummy food!"
Cullen K.,"Honolulu, HI",581,116,63,5.0,9/24/2014,"AMAAAAAAAAAAZING! Awesome service by hostess Jenn and our server Jess. Jenn started out our night by making conversation while walking us to our table. It was small talk, but genuine. She wasn't rushing us to our table and she made sure everything was said with a smile.  After we were seated our server, Jess, came to our introduce herself and give us the run down on the HUGE menu! Gosh there are so many choices one of my friends decided just to go with salad so he wouldn't have to read everything lol.  I asked Jess to recommend some things to me and I am blown away with how great her recommendations were. The chicken Katsu with a spicy miso sauce- MUST TRY! Now i know what hawaii people are thinking- chicken Katsu? Really?- but DANG! That was the best ever. Very juicy crisp slices over a bed of rice topped lightly with delicious sweet and spicy miso sauce with sautéed veggies on the side- win. She also recommended the peach Bellini-NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS MUST TRY! Mmm i would come back JUST for that drink. We ended it with an amazing blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. I am now FAT FULL and SATISFIED. Thanks for making this an amazing night out!!!!!"
Sally D.,"San Jose, CA",50,97,218,5.0,10/28/2015,"WOO - 5 STARS! This review is strictly for the restroom. Honolulu/Waikiki is the perfect place to be - day or night...walking around Ala Moana and Kapiolani shops. There's always something to do, see, or EAT. ABC Stores in every corner and good eats in between. The only downfall is if you're not on the beach side (where the restrooms are), and you gotta go - you gotta find a place. And there's only 2 choices - a nearby hotel or a restaurant. Cheesecake Factory is the absolute BEST place. It's ALWAYS busy, FULL of people, people going in and out that they don't really check if you use their restroom or not. Heck, they probably don't care! Thank you Cheesecake Factory, for being there for me when I need a place to go!"
Amanda B.,"Tucson, AZ",2,18,3,5.0,2/21/2016,"We came here hoping they would have the same happy hour specials as they have on the mainland--big shock, they didn't. But we were happy nonetheless. Our food was delicious, as it always is at Cheesecake Factory, and the service was phenomenal. Our server, Matt, really went above and beyond to give us a great experience here.  Also, we got lucky and didn't have to wait!"
Angelo A.,"Honolulu, HI",553,1156,1023,4.0,8/8/2014,"We just finished a FANTASTIC post-hurricane lunch at Cheesecake Factory and the service we received was excellent. Thank you Kainoa, job well done. Everyone left with a smile on their face and a VERY full belly.  Portions are huge!! My burrito was so large that I'll have the leftover for lunch tomorrow. Hell even the kids portion of Mac n cheese and side of fries were much larger than my 3yr old twins could finish (they shared 1/2 and 1/2).  We've eaten here before and this by far was the best experience we've had thus far. Why only 4then?  I'm not a fan of long waits, never have been, never will be, although this wait was only 35 minutes ( short by normal times here ) I still considered not going. Also, why don't they take reservations? I would be happy to secure mine with a credit card to insure I show up. I think that's a GREAT IDEA. Look into it Cheesecake Factory."
Shayne B.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",6,38,11,3.0,7/29/2016,"I was served a Dr Pepper by the bar tables  that tasted like chicken bleach and I still had to pay for it ugh, it actually ruined my whole experience. (This was two weeks ago around 9:00)"
Adelle K.,"Honolulu, HI",52,20,1,2.0,8/16/2016,"the place smelled horrible, like throw up and sweat. i understood it was busy, and my boyfriend was not happy with our server. our server was messy and did not give us the greatest service, but when my boyfriend said something he did try his best effort to make it up. i believe he had good intentions. im a server too, so i understand rushes and the industry. my meal of the black pepper shrimp with plantains, was horrible i barely ate it. my boyfriend was happy with his chx n mash potatoes.  we took a cheescake togo and at home we ate the delicous slice together. it was wonderful honestly our house smells alot nicer and cleaner than the cheesecake factory so i wished we took the whole meal to go, well except for the shrimp.  2 stars are for the cheesecake and server effort"
Tudi-Ann J.,"Honolulu, HI",40,1,1,4.0,2/14/2016,"Always a pleasure visiting the cheesecake factory for an impromptu dinner. Tried the lemon herb chicken with white rice and watercress. It was decadent, the perfect combination of flavors the chicken was moist and juicy. Skin was a little burnt, but could be overlooked because of the delicious flavor. I would definitely recommend this dish it's hands down my favorite dish out of all the ones I've tried at the cheesecake factory."
Christine R.,"Scarborough, Canada",170,230,1644,4.0,10/27/2013,"As a fellow Canadian we don't have the Cheesecake Factory in our neck of the woods so every opportunity I get to dine here I jump on it. We came here on our last day in Hawaii for Lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We were told it was a 10-15 minute wait and were handed a pager. Within in 10 minutes our buzzer went off - quickest wait time I've ever experienced. The hostess led us to the back of the restaurant, there was some confusion with finding out table and we were left stranded for a minute.... She then returned and led us to a two seater table along a banquet. Our waiter promptly came over and took our orders. I was mainly here for the cheesecake however I did order a little something to pass the time until dessert. I love the complimentary soft and warm bread they serve here. The dark rye is my favourite. For Main I ordered the: Asian Chicken Salad w/ Grilled Chicken, Romaine, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, Cilantro, Rice Noodles, Wontons, Almonds and Sesame Seeds Served with Sesame-Soy Dressing The description of this salad sounded soo enticing and I love a crunchy salad however after a couple of bites I found it too be quite boring and lacking something in the flavor department. My husband ordered Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger w/ Smoked Bacon and Melted Cheddar with Crispy Onion Rings and B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce He loved his burger, it was pretty juicy cooked perfectly medium rare and a hefty burger too! Finally dessert - my main reason for coming here  Reese's® Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Chunks of Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups in our Original Cheesecake with Layers of Delicious Fudge Cake and Caramel As a chocolate peanut butter lover this was heavenly to me! Sooo rich and delicious I was happy I hated my main as I was able to devour every last sinfully scrumptious bite! Overall the Cheesecake factory is what it is. Our waiter was great, constantly refilling our drinks and checking on us. But the cheesecake is always my highlight of coming here and the reason why I always crave to return! FYI If you want a booth make sure you advise the hostess at the desk when requesting a table"
Koi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,518,1171,3.0,9/15/2014,"Serviced sucked' food was bland, wayyyy to busy! SOoo many tourist, but of course haha I'm in Waikiki .. Lol soo loud,   not a sit down and enjoy your food kinda place.  But if you're in a rush and just want to eat and get the heck out .. This is a place for you. Oo I almost forgot there is always a wait time 1hr or longer lol! This is a place if you want to just grab a quick bite and have a drink or two. Food was great but it was ok. Food very pricy being that it's a place for tourist. We have this in Cali! Jaha I wouldn't waste a dime more at this place again I can wait to go to one in Cali! Where it's not super busy and the food is more flavorful lol!"
Lauren A.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,2,,5.0,3/21/2017,"I just left and was so struck by the small interaction I had, I wanted to leave a review. I just ordered a slice of cheesecake to go and left a small tip and the employee who cashed me out must have thanked me five times in under a minute! I didn't catch her name but she was working at the espresso station just now and I wanted to give my thanks for such a sweet interaction! I love the cheesecake here especially the lemon raspberry cream and I just wanted to say thanks to the lady who helped me out and was so kind! Come for the food and stay for the hospitality"
Natalia N Rejino M.,"Honolulu, HI",28,15,16,5.0,8/13/2016,One of my favorite places to eat but the best part is the cheese cake. Mango key lime is the way to go!!
Kim G.,"Pittsfield, MA",17,58,41,4.0,1/9/2017,"We had dinner here while on vacation only because I had a gift card, this wouldn't be a choice otherwise. It was a Sunday night, you would think it was a Saturday night in mid July. It was mobbed. We had a 40 minute wait, since it was a beautiful night we didn't mind waiting. The time went pretty quickly and we were brought to our table which was in windowed corner but it was very dark and stuffy, no air was moving. Our waiter was excellent. We both ordered the meatloaf, it came with mashed potatoes and succotash. I changed mine and swapped green beans for the potatoes and I asked for no gravy. They did give a nice bread basket while waiting. About 25 minutes in our dinner came mine came with gravy but I wasn't going to send it back, I scraped it off. You get a huge portion, and it was delicious!! We each brought half home and of course we brought home 2 slices of cheesecake, no complaints there!! My only suggestion is to somehow get those windows to open and get some air moving."
Mike D.,"New Orleans, LA",0,5,1,4.0,3/19/2017,"Busiest CKF I've ever been to. First class, excellent avocado egg rolls and chicken pot stickers.  Chicken picatta was excellent and more than I can eat."
Lisa E.,"Waipahu, HI",0,19,,4.0,8/19/2015,"The wait on a Sunday at 6 wasn't too bad, but trying to get to the hostess stand was like cattle being herded...seriously!  Once we reached the hostess, they took our name and said about 20-30 minutes, not bad all things considering.  They gave us the buzzer and we walked over to Forever 21.  Huge store and was able to satisfy our wait for dinner.  I ordered the salmon, steak, and asparagus, really yummy.  My friend ordered one of the pasta dishes, the portion was huge!  For apps we got the buffalo blasts and something else I can't quite remember.  Not memorable means not great. Anyway, I avoid Waikiki like the plague, but I think a trip to Cheesecake Factory once in a while is worth the drive in."
Kayla U.,"Kailua, HI",522,68,209,4.0,7/23/2014,"I love Cheesecake factory! The pictures and name should have already sold you. I'm guessing this place isn't a 5 star establishment because of the long lines and the location. Us locals usually dread going into Waikiki because everything is so touristy crowded, and over priced. Aside from that, i love it here.  I get the salmon, either herb crusted or miso, its always a toss up, they're both so good! And i've recently discovered the steak diane and shrimp combo. #toodiefor Its really good, and a generous portion. But too much if you are trying to save room for dessert. I used to like all the fancy cheesecakes like the white chocolate raspberry, but lately i've been a plain with strawberry kinda gal.  They really need to do cheesecake samplers in big shot glasses so i can have more than one! And so i dont feel so guilty!"
Keanu W.,"Mililani, HI",2,3,,4.0,6/12/2016,"Had a great time with family friends here. We came during lunch time, and our food came to us really fast. The food was DELICIOUS. Don't forget to save up for some cheesecake afterwards.  My only complaint is that the waitress was very slow even though the restaurant wasn't as busy. Other than that, it was really good!"
Janice A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,1,,5.0,12/9/2016,"We were on a staycation at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for Father's Day weekend and decided to eat an early dinner here.  We heard that the wait can be crazy like 1-2 hours but we got there at 4:30 and the wait was only 20-30 minutes.  Which was great considering it was Saturday and we were hungry from swimming all day.  The food was perfect, hubby ordered the humongous factory grande burrito and I ordered the shrimp and chicken gumbo.  It was soooo goood!  Kids ordered the usual spaghetti.  Wish I got to order cheesecake but the kids wanted ice cream so we ordered the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae which was big enough for all of us to share."
