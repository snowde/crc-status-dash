M. B.,"Leavenworth, KS",5,54,23,2.0,7/16/2016,Why is the service so bad? Food is good- drinks are  good- service is terrible. Not worth it anymore. Is the service so bad because the majority of patrons are tourists who are exhausted and starving? Why are there pigeons at my ankles? Why do I have no water? I'm so thirsty. Why must I ask for bread 3 times? Other tables are eating bread before their meal. Why is my waitress overcharging my credit card on a half cash half card payment? Did she think she could pocket the cash and I wouldn't notice? Why are all the wait help flown here not grown here with the exception of a few?
Jaz L.,"Sandy, UT",2,98,7,4.0,7/16/2016,"Everything from the food to the drinks to the deserts are outstanding. There is so so much to pick from. A local favorite is the loco moco, a thick hamburger patty on top of rice topped with two eggs and bathed in rich mushroom gravy is die for. All of the portions are huge, perfect for sharing. Another favorite is the bang bang chicken and shrimp, oh so good. Service is always fast and friendly. The only bad thing is the long wait. I wish they opened earlier for breakfast and took reservations."
Jarrad A.,"Mililani, HI",0,22,19,4.0,9/11/2016,"It was very fast we were seated, and the food was very good, and came out in a fast timely manner. And for the portion size, and the price for the food, it is very worth it. And the of course, you can't leave here without having the name of the restaurant, cheesecake!!!"
Sterling H.,"Fresno, CA",16,7,,5.0,8/21/2016,The wait was long but that is expected on a Saturday night at this location. Our server was Charles. Possibly the nicest waiter I've ever had at any restaurant. 6/5 stars for him! Ask for him. Got the shrimp scampi and my wife got the chicken sandwich. Both were bomb.
Michelle S.,"Waianae, HI",107,227,472,3.0,7/4/2015,"I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. They serve really tasty dishes no their menu is really extensive. Beware of the wait if you're going during dinner time. I've waited two hours one time! Ridiculous! But the food is well worth waiting for. We had a bad experience this past visit, the bus boy was gathering our plates to clear our table when he dropped two of the plates right onto our table and in a friends plate that still had good food left on it that she was waiting to be put into a take out container. The manager came because he heard all the commotion and plates falling, etc. sodas toppled over, two people had wet attire and one meal ruined. The manager had the meal that was ruined replaced. For the inconvenience of the mess and wet attire you'd think they'd at least give a complimentary dessert! Nothing! This place is worthy of a five star rating but due to the unprofessional customer service and the long wait time I've given them a 3! However the food is good!"
Gretchen Q.,"Honolulu, HI",121,36,47,4.0,6/2/2016,"I always love coming here to eat whenever I'm in Waikiki. However, do expect a long wait. Wait can get as long as 2 hours when extremely busy. However, this place is always worth the wait. They also do offer takeout if waiting is impossible."
P S.,"Aiea, HI",95,11,10,4.0,2/16/2016,"For a chain resteraunt very good.  We decided to go for Valentines Day and not like most resteraunts we were told 20 minute wait, it was 20 minutes.   We received the best service from our waitress. The food was delicious and at a very good value.  We could have ordered one dish and shared.  Got the cheesecake to go."
Marcia M.,"Honolulu, HI",97,4,,4.0,3/8/2017,"Our waiter was okay. He wasn't awful, but not the most enthusiastic. The food was great. The wait wasn't too long. Probably because we got there right when they were opening and it was on a Tuesday."
Ashley B.,"Corona, CA",59,6,2,2.0,7/31/2016,Wait time is long as to be expected but it's pretty ridiculous when a party of two (that's told the wait is 20 minutes) watches 4-5 other parties get seated before them then the women taking names says they have no idea how we were passed up....kinda pissed since we come here everytime we visit Hawaii and it happens to be my favorite restaurant smh
Angela Y.,"Honolulu, HI",577,83,670,3.0,7/15/2014,"PERFECT for your dessert fix, but I have to admit that I have mixed feelings about The Cheesecake Factory.  BTW, not sure if other yelpers have experienced this, but I couldn't find this business on yelp after searching for ""Cheesecake Factory"" or ""Cheesecake Factory restaurant"". However, after typing ""THE cheese..."" It popped up. Definitive articles matter! The first time I came here, service was awesome for a busy place. We were quickly seated, attended to, ate, paid, left. Quick experience but no complaints there, being the food filled our bellies and our waitress was nothing but sweet and bubbly. Second time, however, was bit unsatisfactory. There was a wait, which I didn't mind. We held onto their alarm vibrating pager, which looked suitable to shave Dumbledore's beard. We asked for water that we were not provided, and it came, long minutes after several intense sessions of eye-rolling and sighing, compliments of our waiter who I felt tended to rush us to order.  We ordered, and our food finally came. I didn't recall ordering an Everything Pizza with half burnt pepperonis, but I guess that was just the special that night :/ The rest of the food was yummy, especially the cheesecake, which was really the reason why I came in the first place.  Their cheesecake is to die for, but for food and customer service.. :/ maybe on a less busier day. Nonetheless, this restaurant is very popular and I would return due to my sweet tooth."
Amanda S.,"San Diego, CA",156,378,50,4.0,11/1/2015,"The wait is always long, but if you can get a table it's always a great experience. I've been going to cheesecake favorites on the mainland for who knows how long, and their menu is fantastic though overwhelmingly long. Always a great ambiance with perfectly dim lighting and beautiful details in the restaurant, and this particular location is very well done. They even have some local flair on their menu. I had the chorizo omelette one night here and it was AMAZING. Also if you get a salad, try the avocado ranch dressing. So delicious! Oh and portions are huge so you'll almost always take home some."
Christine E.,"Honolulu, HI",80,222,1523,4.0,12/12/2012,"Whyyyyy, why don't you make another Cheesecake Factory somewhere else on the island? Dont get me wrong, I love the fact that my 2 hour wait for the Cheesecake Factory gives me a good excuse to shop - ""well, we have to kill 2 hours anyway, i might as well go to the new 2 story Victoria's Secret store. you know, just to look...:)""  but I really wish I could skip the wait and go straight to the overindulgence.  There are many things I love about the Cheesecake Factory:  1) The brown bread. It's sweet, and when you put butter all over it, it's delicioussss. Skip the sour dough though. 2) The cocktails. Give me a frosty Georgia Peach - peachy slushy awesomeness swirled with raspberry - and i'm in heaven!  3) The food. OMG they give SOOOOOOOOOOO much! and it's GOOOOD. I know there's a thousand things on the menu, but I hardly deviate. It's either I want pasta - in which case I get the Farfalle with Chicken and Sundried tomatoes (creamy and delicious), or I want Food-Food - in which case I get the Chicken Madeira (Mashed potatoess!!!), or I want a sandwich - in whch case you gotta go for the Avocado Chicken club craziness which taste like a club sandwich but on grilled cheese.  4) The cheesecake. Red velvet cheesecake. That's it. The end. Stick a fork in me. Delicious. I'm also a very huge fan of the carrot cake cheesecake, and the peanut butter one.  If you are someone who doesn't mind the wait because you intend to use the ""wait"" as an excuse to shop to your drop, then go for it. Cheesecake factory is one of those chain restaurants I actually like! Side note: if you're ever in Vegas and eat at the Grand Lux in the Palazzo or Venetian? Guess what...you're eating Cheesecake Factory!! :) Slightly different menu, but same same. :)"
Ed A.,"Petaluma, CA",123,139,92,3.0,6/6/2016,its ok food.. nothing fancy nothing special.. just good decent food...
Christal C.,"Waipahu, HI",317,337,1106,5.0,9/28/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I don't come here often, but when I do, I'm always satisfied. The food is great! And there's always enough food to take home too. The only con to this place would be the wait. So if you're starving and can't wait, go somewhere else. I had a party of 11 and we waited for 45min. We made up for the time by going shopping :)"
Lisa B.,"Toronto, Canada",96,354,543,4.0,4/1/2013,"This place is on the strip, right down the street from Waikiki beach.  While it is huge, don't think you won't have a long wait if you go for dinner!  My suggestion...go about an hour to an hour and a half before you want to eat and put your name on the list.  They'll give you a buzzer and then do some shopping - but don't go too far!   The menu is huge - over 200 options so they say.  To be honest, they could probably cut down the prices a bit if they didn't serve such huge portions.  The portion sizes are huge that you essentially get 2 dinners for the price of one.   Service is good, and the food is quite tasty.  Yummy smoothies and of course, dessert!   Nice patio too - if you get out there!"
T K.,"Mililani, HI",0,8,10,5.0,2/10/2016,"We ate here for the first time . . . finally! And we were amazingly impressed! We came specifically to taste your famous cheese cakes, so we decided to save our appetite by sharing a meal. We started off with the Vietnamese Summer Spring rolls which were so refreshing. Upon Chante's (our waitress) recommendation, we then had the miso salmon and Caesar salad for a light dinner. We were extremely pleased with both, especially the flavor of the miso salmon! We followed the meal with a Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake and the Banana Cream Cheesecake. Wow! We were blown away with both cheesecakes! We walked away very impressed with the atmosphere, the helpful and friendly service given by Chante, and the awesomeness of the foods from beginning to end. Thank you for a great ""first"" dining experience at your restaurant! We will definitely be back!"
Jim B.,"Vaughan, Canada",44,653,411,4.0,10/18/2014,"Whenever I see a cheese cake factory I feel like one of those losers whose vacations doesn't seem fulfilled without stopping in for a meal. I live in Toronto and the closest one is in Bufallo, NY, so it's always a treat to visit one when in the US. While in a primo location, I found it to be fairly quiet considering where it is....all the better for us ! Food portions are gigantic, cake slices immense, service friendly. Best part was listening to a couple from Japan (who spoke minimal English) arguing with the waitress about their bill. It was a hoot as neither knew what the other was saying. It's a cheese cake factory...no surprises, you know what you're getting"
Roselle S.,"Honolulu, HI",6,8,6,1.0,7/22/2016,"Dirty table, hard bread like a day or 2 old, SUPER SALTY CALAMARI, STEAK DIAMNE was just as salty. SHRIMP SCAMPI tasted old shrimp yuk!!'BAD. night at least my son's American cheeseburger was good."
Christine R.,"Waipahu, HI",313,9,4,5.0,8/8/2016,"This is a late review but I just had to give credit to this restaurant and the people who work here. The line can be ridiculously long, and the wait can be up to two hrs. But the staff is always smiling and so kind and friendly. The first two experiences I came here weren't that great for me. Service was awesome, servers were always attentive  but I guess I just ordered the wrong things for me. Third times the charm! Our server was great (as always), always checking on our table, never rushing us, and cracking jokes w/ us girls. Another bonus was the 50% off cheesecakes, yumm!"
AJ B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,16,2,5.0,8/7/2016,"This is one of our go-to places when we can't figure out where to go.  We sit at the bar and the ladies are always polite and provide quick service.  If you haven't tried their waffles, you must!  They are only served on Sunday during their brunch.  You really can't go wrong here."
