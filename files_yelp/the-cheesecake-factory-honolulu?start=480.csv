Amina S.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,11,1,5.0,8/27/2016,"My second time here and my experience was amazing. My friends and I had to wait about an hour and half to get served because we went on a Friday night but it was worth it. Tyler was our server and I can say that I have never had such a kind and courteous server like him, EVER. he made everything more enjoyable and was always trying to serve us as soon as possible with all the tables he had. He made sure our experience was as best as it could be and fast despite the crowd. Thank you Tyler T!"
Shannon G.,"Garden Grove, CA",7,16,,1.0,7/2/2016,2 hour + wait on a Saturday night?!?!? No thanks. Ur food looks fabulous but it's not that fabulous and to have a line out to the street without anyone letting anyone know what the wait time is? Nope. I can go elsewhere. I'm on vacation not waitcation.
Bridgette P.,"San Diego, CA",78,43,4,3.0,7/14/2016,"We love Cheesecake Factory but this place was super busy! If you are going to eat here, go early because there was a constant line outside! It was conveniently located by the mall and easy to get to."
N. O.,"Aiea, HI",0,41,3,4.0,4/11/2016,"Pro:  - It's the Cheesecake Factory - Good variety Con: - Unless you go early, expect to wait a long time for a table We were in Waikiki on a staycation and my wife wanted to eat here.  We were lucky, we went just before 5pm on Sunday and were seated after a 10 minute wait.  Our waiter said the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory is the largest and busiest in the chain.  He said that they could have 100 people waiting about an hour when it gets busy.  The menu is a mix of the traditional Cheesecake Factory menu (traditional American) with a few Asian dishes like Chicken Katsu (I guess for the Asian tourists/locals).  Food was good and service was fast and friendly.  We had nachos for an appetizer and our meals.  I had the BBQ Chicken Salad.  It was good, but could have used a little more BBQ sauce since it was a little bland.  They have big portions so all of us walk out with leftovers."
Sydney B.,"Mililani, HI",124,3,,2.0,5/2/2016,"Usually Cheesecake Factory is AMAZING to me food & service wise.  Last night was a huge let down though.  The food (of course) was exactly what I expected. Our server last night was Bianca. It seemed as soon as I let her know how much of a fan of their table bread I am, her tone and facial expressions came off extremely annoyed and continued that way while I ordered my food.  We didn't have to wait too terribly long for our appetizer or main course. She did come back once for a refill and I asked for more bread. The next time we saw her, we asked for boxes, some cheesecake to go, and the check. Bianca then told us the reason the refill on my drink and bread had taken a while was because she thought I was ""eating/drinking too fast"" .........Um, what? My wife and I always go to restaurants starving and yes, eat as much as we can before we waddle out. I thought it was extremely rude not only that she was mentioning she did it on purpose, but that she continued to talk about how much bread I had eaten. I have had MUCH better customer service while eating at The Cheesecake Factory and our appreciation always shows in our gratuity. Last night, the food was up to par but I hope I never have service like that again. Or I might stop coming to the Waikiki Factory."
Taryn L.,"Honolulu, HI",161,220,1281,4.0,6/12/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants on the island.  My love for the Cheesecake Factory shows every time I brave the Waikiki crowds and the hour wait for a table just to get one of their pasta dishes.  While this restaurant is known for their namesake (and their cheesecake is good), I ALWAYS come back for the Pasta da Vinci. It's penne pasta in a delicious (and addicting) wine sauce with chicken, mushrooms and onions. The waiter normally will freshly grate/shred cheese on top of the pasta. There is just something about that pasta sauce that calls to me; it's slightly sweet and not too rich.  I've never found any entree like it.  When you're at the Cheesecake Factory, you always have to save room for dessert. They have a multitude of flavors of cheesecake, plus other types if desserts too. I usually get the vanilla bean cheesecake - it's surprisingly light for a cheesecake. The flavor isn't overpowering or overly sweet. I've also had their lemon raspberry cream, peppermint (seasonal), white chocolate raspberry truffle, and the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake slices. No matter which ones I've tried, the vanilla bean still takes the number one spot for me (okay...that peppermint cheesecake for the holiday season is a close second - if only they had it year-round!). Also, keep in mind, that with all cheesecake slices, they give these huge dollops of whipped cream. Just delicious! (I try not to think of calories when I eat here) The food and the cheesecakes are amazing here and their bread is just as fantastic.  At other restaurants, I normally don't eat the bread so I have room for appetizers, the entree, and dessert, but here, I skip apps and I eat the bread. If I didn't love that pasta so much, I'd consider eating just the bread for my meal. It's that good. Plus, it is complimentary.  Tips: - When you come here, expect at least a 45 minute wait to be seated - get your parking validated - always save room for dessert :)"
Lee G.,"Wahiawā, HI",22,27,35,5.0,11/16/2014,First time here for a nieces birthday and I must say I'm glad to have had a great experience. I heard so many nightmare stories about the crowds and long wait times but the manager was so awesome to have clarified our wait time and 45 mins wasn't bad at all considering our large party of 12.  My hubby and I both ordered the combo...chicken Madeira w/ Steak Diane and it was delicious! Thumbs up all around. We'll definitely be back!
Mark M.,"Niagara Falls, NY",136,1018,6165,4.0,9/19/2014,"This is the busiest Cheesecake Factory on earth, believe it or not.  The place always has a line-up.  We got lucky on a Thursday night and scooped up a high table at the bar.  We were served within 10 minutes and the our chicken sandwiches came out within 30 minutes.  This place is very efficient.  The server was friendly, bringing us the famous white and brown breads.   The Chicken Sandwiches were cooked perfectly and only about $12.  What a deal!  One of the best places to eat in Waikiki.  They had a live band playing when we were their on the Thursday night around 10:00pm.  A nice outdoor patio too."
Emily B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,12,,4.0,12/29/2015,"It's actually really good?? But if you try to go at peak dinner hours your family will hate you and you will probably sign your divorce papers while standing in the huge line. Be nice to your servers, it is that crazy EVERY NIGHT.  (One piece of cheesecake is enough for 2-3 people.)"
Megan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,111,61,3.0,7/6/2014,"Boo... The wait here is crazy long but it helps that there are shops to occupy you during your wait. If you really want to dine here, you should at least come an hour before you actually want to eat. We came around 8pm and didn't get seated till 9:30pm. But what else can you expect on a Saturday night in Waikiki.  Boo...our server wasn't very friendly and didn't check up on during our dinner. It was just a downer especially after that long wait Boo... Parking is expensive and hard to find. Waikiki in General is expensive and can get really overwhelming with all the tourists.  Woohoo! Everything I've tried is very tasty and I especially love their carbonara! I can never finish it though because their portions are so big!  My boyfriend had their steak done med rare and it was really great too! It came with perfectly salted fries and a couple of onion rings, but those weren't that great.   Woohoo! Tonight, I wanted to try something different so I ordered their mango smoothie. It was well made and made my tummy very happy. They mixed a raspberry purée in it (I think) and some coconut juice. Must try it next time!  Woohoo! Their cheesecakes never disappoint me. I'm kind of boring and really enjoy their original cheesecake but when I'm feeling adventurous, their Oreo dream is so...dreamy! They're great for sharing, especially after a big dinner.  I probably won't be back anytime soon only because it's a hassle to get out to waikiki. But the food is definitely worth coming back for!"
Ryan M.,"Honolulu, HI",2,30,3,5.0,12/26/2015,"Great menu! Food is always consistently good!  A little pricey and the wait times can be long but def worth it!  Try the well mannered martini and steak Dianne, by far my favorite"
Sheyna Lei B.,"Honolulu, HI",296,58,166,4.0,7/20/2015,"Located at the end of Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, please come prepared if you plan on eating there for dinner.  Your wait time will be about 45mins-1 hour.  But it's always worth it here (in my opinion).  Because I have been craving for their food I decided to take the other half there for dinner last night after I get off of work.  So I had a brilliant idea (since I work in the mall) to walk over before my shift ends and put our names in, and still have time to run over to H&M to check out their sale.  And let me tell you, it was the greatest idea ever!!!! By the time we did our shopping, I checked in with the hostess to see how much longer and she responded ""10 mins"" in about 2 mins our buzzer went off and we waited to be seated. Ivan B. was our server, and he was great.  Although service was a little behind, it's expected because this place is ALWAYS crazy packed during dinner time till pass closing time.  The other half and I had already planned ahead before even being seated, we already knew what we wanted.  But he wanted to take another look at the menu and see if there was anything else that sounded appetizing.  But we had our minds set to what we wanted.   As soon as Ivan approached our table and introduced himself, we mentioned to him that we were ready to order.   Starters: Buffalo Blasts Me: Chicken Salad Sandwich w/salad and house dressing Him: Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi Combo and waters w/lemon :) Again, our orders did take sometime, because it is busy. In the mean time he did drop off our waters along with some fresh house bread (honey wheat brown bread and sourdough) and butter.  They also had live music with was great.   I wish had taken pics of our dish, but the lighting wasn't so great :( We didn't end the night with cheesecake because we were so stuffed.  Overall food is always great there.  I always order the same thing when I eat there.  Buffalo blasts are a must try :)"
Pamela G.,"Honolulu, HI",16,6,18,3.0,8/3/2014,"We love cheesecake  factory, the only bad thing is they clean the sealing when we are eating, it doesn't look good that they come with a old looking mop to clean all the water that built up by the AC . The establishment is always busy. The owner should had enough money to have a state of the art system and not have the employees clean the ceiling so often !  Other than that, food is pretty good and of course, the cheesecake!!"
OC B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",1,62,,4.0,7/8/2015,"I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  Food is always consistently good and portions are huge.  If I have to complain, it would be to decrease the menu items as it is a bit overwhelming.   We came here on a Sunday night, not expecting a crowd.  Boy were we wrong.  The line was out the door and it was a 90 minute wait.  To place a takeout order it was 45 minutes.  Obviously, other people are as fond of this restaurant as we are.   Overall, the experience was as good as any other Cheesecake Factory.  While waiting my wife and I couldn't remember a time that we waited 90+ minutes for a table.  But we did here because we were on vacation and had nowhere else to be.  If back home, I doubt we would have done the same."
Jaymi G.,"Honolulu, HI",157,14,120,3.0,10/6/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory always excites me. It looks so grand inside, a little dark but it's got a nice, low key atmosphere. Its easy to forget about busy kalakaua outside.     Dinning in for lunch never disappoints. Service is usually quick and the servers are helpful. It might be the lighting but they always seem to overlook my bf's need for a water refill. It usually doesn't take more than 8 mins for the water refill. If it does I just give him mine. Their Caesar salad is great, as well as the pizza. I got both as their lunch special offered a smaller portion. Love the lunch special.       Dinner is a little more difficult. I should have called for reservations for dinner on a Saturday night for four. But I didn't. We got there and waited in line for 10 mins to get to the host desk. It was about 6:30 when we got our buzzer from the host and she told us the wait would be about an hour and ten mins. On point estimate!!! We walked around while we waited and at 7:45ish the buzzer went off and we were seated.      After being seated we waited a while for our server to come by and when she finally did she asked if we were ready to order, we gave her our drink orders and she asked us again if we were ready. I guess she wasn't concerned about the drinks... We have her our order and got our drinks soon after, then the appetizer, then the entrees. I got a little irritated. My bf's water was empty and we couldn't see our server for a good 10 mins. So I tried to get the attention of the bussers for a few mins before succeeding and ALL of our drinks were refilled. We did not see our server again until she gave us our check.       The food is great! The service not always, but I'll still come back. I understand it gets busy."
Arnold C.,"Manteca, CA",30,40,10,5.0,7/12/2016,Super long line as always but the cheesecake is always to die for we got the banana cheesecake and the peanut butter cheesecake and man I wisish I had the whole cake
Y K.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,134,52,3.0,5/27/2014,"I like the Cheesecake Factory franchise but this Cheesecake Factory is a major tourist trap. The bread brought to the table was cold, hard, and did not taste like Sourdough. I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and had the Lemoncello Cream Torte. The pasta was good and the torte was the highlight of the meal!  Be prepared to wait a very long time to be seated."
Mike G.,"Kapolei, HI",0,5,,2.0,1/29/2017,"My gf and I had dinner at back bar recently. Bartender Chris attempted to help us but I think because he was alone at the bar, his frustration leaked into his customer service. Everything we asked for seemed to annoy him. The only thing that saved his tip was the runners bringing the food on time. 3 days later we were going to the magic show across the street with another couple. We went to back bar again hoping Chris was not there. Unfortunately Chris was there. We ordered drinks only and he was negative as ever. My friend payed for the round and commented that the bartender did not smile once. All I have to say is, we are on vacation to have a good time and meet cool food service people, being that my gf are both bartenders. Some people are not wired to be in customer service, Chris is one of those people. Will never return to bar as long as he is there."
Laura R.,"Cheswick, PA",42,114,56,1.0,10/16/2015,Stopped in tonight to get a piece of cheesecake and it was the smallest piece of cheesecake ever. I didn't look at until I got home because it was so crowded and just wanted to get out of there. Super disappointed. I usually love their cheesecake but this well fell short of happiness. It was the chocolate chip cookie dough but I didn't realize there were nuts on it :/  it happens. The lady running the cash register sure wasn't the happiest employee ever but it was probably a long night so I don't exactly blame her. I need to just stop coming here.
Sally E.,"Honolulu, HI",0,10,1,4.0,1/26/2017,"Had a great time, loved the atmosphere but, most importantly, the food was great! Highly recommend it and don't forget your cheesecake."
