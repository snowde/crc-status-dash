Greg P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,16,,2.0,6/19/2016,Not really very good at all. It's all about enormous portions and not much else. Sat in the back bar where one is forced to listen to the cacophony of whirring  blenders. Not very relaxing at all. Their signature fish dish of macadamia nut crusted ono was over cooked and fishy. They get away with it because customers are overwhelmed with the portions. Go and try any number of the other numerous restaurants in Waikiki.
Randall H.,"Honolulu, HI",28,40,44,5.0,6/23/2015,Gotta love the steaks! What's not to love about the Cheesecake Factory. The place has awesome music and food that makes you happy. As a chef I know good food & the food here are good as it gets.
R David S.,"Dallas, TX",18,168,114,4.0,5/11/2016,I like this restaurant. Their location in Honolulu is good. The service was fast and they did a good job accommodating our group. Food as always good. Cheesecakes are amazing. My suggestion is try as many as you can. Not all at the same time but don't get stuck with the same cheesecake flavor for always.
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,2.0,8/6/2014,"The location is buuuuusy. I wouldn't even bother coming here over the weekend. Especially for dinner. How we were able to get a table for 2 on a Sunday afternoon right away is beyond me as every other time we walked by the restaurant there was a sea of people waiting to be seated. The next part of this review might explain why there's such a long wait. I don't know about all the staff, but our waitress seemed to really embrace the laid back, take it easy nature of the island lifestyle. Service was very slow. There's a fine line between pestering the customer and not being attentive enough, but ours just vanished for a long period of time. It was hot, so when we sat down, we were happy when she said she'd be right back with bread & water. She came back, with nothing, and took our dink orders. She then finally came back after another wait with our drinks and bread (still no water). We then had to wait around for an unusually long time for our order, and then again for the bill. My wife would, without a doubt, say Cheesecake Factory is her favorite restaurant so we've been to many many locations. We've never experienced such laid back, non attentive service before. It wasn't enough to upset us, but the whole time we were there, we kept commenting on how off the whole experience felt. It was like we were in a Cheesecake Factory that just wasn't a Cheesecake Factory. We would look around and watch them forget to buss tables before others were seated & other customers looking around for their waiters. Just not what we've come to expect from Cheesecake. It really bummed her out. Oh, and decided that I'd try the Hawaiian fish sandwich as I wanted to try something I couldn't get at another location. It was okay. The coleslaw, though tasty, was a bit overpowering so I couldn't really taste the grilled fish. Oh well."
Sergey R.,"Olympia, WA",30,10,1,4.0,12/21/2015,The server Jeffery extraordinary at his job in every level and category of serving everyone especially with the very big group of people we had he remembered everyone's order without writing it down the food was prepared perfectly.  The only major problem that we encountered was very poor traffic management coming into the restaurant and getting everyone seated in an organized timely fashion
Emi H.,"Honolulu, HI",5000,1564,14109,3.0,4/28/2012,"The #1 rule of good management: Feed your people! My team and I were setting up for our Yelp booth at Spam Jam and I decided to pop over to Cheesecake Factory to grab take-out for the looooooong event ahead.  I tried to order my favorite thai chicken pasta but the woman at the counter informed me that it had been discontinued. I shook my fist in the air and screamed ""Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"" After my fit and several rounds of crying, I proceeded to order the tomato basil penne pasta and a french country salad which consisted of greens, asparagus, beets and goat cheese. I ran back to my booth and returned twenty minutes later for my order. Back at the Yelp booth the three of us (me, Thomas O & Pua P) dove into the two dishes. The portions in classic Cheesecake Factory style were gigantic! The pasta was nothing too adventurous but satisfying. The french country salad exceeded my expectations and was very tasty! It's something I'd certainly order again on a return visit. $25 fed all three of us so it wasn't too shabby of a deal! The service at the bakery counter was alright but I thought it lacked overall attentiveness. They seemed really busy checking on their registers and cheesecakes, but wouldn't it have been better to tend to the customer first? I waited for someone to help me both times while ordering and upon my return to pick up my food. The phone kept ringing again and again while I was there and all I could keep thinking was ""That's your customer on the phone. Will someone pick it up?!"" I know I'd want someone to answer my phone call if I was calling. I've decided to pull back a star because well...I want my damn thai pasta! Bring it back! Bring it back! Bring it back! I'll see you soon for a strawberry shortcake... Yelp 365 Challenge: #218/365 (The Bring Back My Thai Pasta)"
Whitney W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,22,3,2.0,6/16/2015,"Oh cheesecake, how you disappointed me in Waikiki! I've been to a dozen cheesecakes around the states and this is the worst one. First they don't have the ""skinnylicious"" menu in Hawaii so don't come here if you like to watch unnecessary calories. (And I know in their regular menu they make dishes with unnecessary calories) Second I ordered the herb lemon roasted chicken and 10 minutes later the manager comes to tell me that they can't serve me that because the chicken wasn't cooked or something. She hands me a menu to order something new and my waiter had no idea and was baffled when I went to order the Parmesan- crusted chicken.  Third- my husband wants to order a torte and I asked for a side of raspberries since I love fresh fruit with whipped cream. They don't have rasberries! And the strawberries that came on it were not fresh.   I will continue to support you in the mainland states but for the 6 years I live here, I will not visit this Cheesecake again. Fortunately for me, Oahu offers an array of AMAZING restaurants . So you won't be missed."
Thea V.,Australia,0,8,6,4.0,1/18/2016,"Very busy establishment We ordered the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake -- hubby loved it. Coffee -- cappuccino , average Definitely recommended  for cheesecakes! Might need Reservations if dining."
Jacob H.,"San Diego, CA",80,111,112,3.0,7/25/2014,This place is so full of tourist it's always slow and wait time is horrible.  The food is obviously amazing and the cheesecake is top notch.  We come by just to grab a slice.
Brandon O.,"Waipahu, HI",113,20,5,5.0,5/27/2016,When you are in the area you have to come down to cheesecake factory. You have to ask for Chris T. He is one of the best servers you will ever have. Thanks chris for awesome dinner.
Michael A.,"Honolulu, HI",7,16,,2.0,7/31/2016,"Too crowded all the time. Wait service tries to rush u. Menu is a bible.  Food, except for the cheesecakes is meh..... Went once , won't go back. Just not my cup of tea."
Quinn D.,"Fort Worth, TX",351,22,25,4.0,5/28/2014,The food is great. I had a mac n cheese burger. Get some apps' to tide your hunger til the main course arrives. I recommend the mac n cheese balls. Did i mention i really like mac n cheese?  ^_^
Frances G.,"Spanaway, WA",125,67,86,5.0,3/21/2014,"Alright alright. Whose crazy enough to wait for an hour or more to be seated..  I am. :) I love their cheesecakes and their foods.  Checked in around 6:55, was told to come back for a buzzer at 7:25. And then another 15-25 mins for a table. Not bad. Not bad. Especially when were near forever 21. Yep. And I just got paid. HA!  Any who. I'm not one to stand around and wait to be called. But I make exceptions with this place.     Food was amazing. Service was great!  What more can you ask for?!"
Witchwen L.,"Sparks, NV",0,4,3,4.0,12/5/2015,"Me and my husband spend our anniversary here, his place is great, only the waiting time too long, we wait like 1 hour outside and inside.  The taco r great, and the Hawaiian drinks, hope I can have it everyday:) Last, cheese cakes, can't praise more,just great!"
Damion S.,"Honolulu, HI",212,21,1,5.0,4/6/2016,"What can I say? It's the Cheesecake Factory! Cheesecake options up the ying yang. But wait! There's more....Hibachi Steak, ribeye steaks, and plenty more food options to choose from that I've never been disappointed with. Sometimes the wait can get long, but if you don't have a group with you, just go the bars. Yes, there are two of them. The one all the way in the back isn't as big as the one you see in the front, but has seating."
Natalya K.,"West Chicago, IL",22,10,2,4.0,7/14/2016,We had to wait about 30 to 45 minutes to be seated and it's understandable because there was like a mob crowd waiting to eat there. Even with that many people waiting I was surprised that we were seated that quickly. I was expecting to wait like 1 to 2 hours for a table. It's a shame that they don't do reservations. The food was great and our server was great too. It was a really nice romantic dinner that my husband and I had at sundown. The lights were dimmed making the atmosphere very romantic. I would definitely eat here again.
De D.,"Melbourne, Australia",1,7,4,3.0,6/5/2014,"Nice food and long menu but some staff in the frontline are not welcoming .  Management should ask them to "" come what may - smile at customers "" we know that you guys work extra hard seating 10s and100s waiting in line out there but you don't have to be rude or welcome us with a long face.  Too over rated for the long wait. Enjoyed Dukes restaurant much better but if you are staying in Waikiki for a few days then not a bad place to try out. Meal portions are big and prices are reasonable. Piece of suggestion to couples will be to just order one main and may be a starter and share unless you at very hungry."
Priya V.,"Kapaa, HI",0,3,,5.0,1/9/2017,"I enjoy this restaurant.It's located in the heart of Waikiki.. you can get the  best foods there. Good for vegetarians and non vegetarians.If you are on diet , then this is not your restaurant.price is little expensive.But it's worth for the food you get there. Interior designed in such a way make you calm n relax.Quantity of food is more. Particularly on your vacations or holidays it's cool place to have your relaxed food.i would recommend to anyone. Even kids will enjoy the food. More dessert available."
Denise F.,"Cedar Hill, TX",20,50,14,1.0,3/18/2016,The wait find was Ridiculous! 2 hours to sit down. 45 mins before Togo food . 35 mins to wait for food. Lost appetite . Ate only the damn bread. So freaking disorganized! This location is popular for its own good need better customer service!!!!! The only thing good is the food! ONLY THE FOOOD ONLLLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYY THE FOOD!
Kayak N.,"Lynchburg, VA",1,8,16,5.0,5/29/2016,"Awesome time in Honolulu,Hawaii!  No wait at 4:30 pm. Food arrived fast and hot. My party of five was well satisfied with this meal. Used the new cakepay app to pay for the meal and it worked perfectly.  Our waiter was polite and efficient serving us. Great job cheesecake factory!"
