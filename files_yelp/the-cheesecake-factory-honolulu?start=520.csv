Kuanoni K.,"Honolulu, HI",509,13,2,5.0,3/23/2015,"If you're looking for a filling and delicious meal, look no further than Cheesecake Factory! The wait is long, but it's definitely worth it.  Our table was set for two and we were promptly greeted by our server Chonte.  She explained the menu with expert knowledge and made her recommendations.   We started off with the fried mac and cheese which was fabulous.  We settled on the BanBan Chicken Curry which was flavorful and delicious, and the Ahi special. Our food was served to us and we enjoyed it.  I was most impressed by our server, who was knowledgable and knew her menu items well. In addition to her prompt service, she took the liberty of correcting mistakes the kitchen had made.  She was incredibly enjoyable and fabulous. Thanks, Chonte! We will be back."
Mary M.,"Honolulu, HI",172,49,48,4.0,6/9/2015,Came to celebrate my husband and son's birthday together...food is good like always but really did hope they had a complimentary birthday dessert for the hubby or any occasion as a matter of fact considering this our go to place for anniversaries and birthdays! On the bright side my son got a free one! Would have given a 5 star if they had actually given me the cheesecake I ordered instead of a different one.
Chanell W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",3,7,10,5.0,9/11/2015,Me and my boyfriend decided to have a nice lunch and we xecided to go to the cheesecake factory. It was amazing! Service was amazing ! I think his name for christian a long hair blonde guy lol ask for him! He was very attentive ! Always filled uo our glass of water and check up on us. I love it the food was amazing we had calamaru and shared a meal i forgot what it was called but it was one of the most popular dish. And i was in love. And the cheesecake we had was a chocolate tuxedo cheesecake. So yummy
Eleni V.,"Honolulu, HI",19,10,14,4.0,11/8/2015,Was a little let down after hearing how I have to try this restaurant.  Wait time was long. But it was to be expected. We didn't mind the wait.  Got the Hawaiian pizza (was too overwhelmed with the menu so I got something familiar) and I didn't care for it. It was really floppy and soft. Not crisp like a pizza should be. I didn't really like the flavour and there was maybe ONE pineapple piece on each slice. Sometimes two if I was lucky.  The waitress knew I didn't like it and at least took it off my receipt so I appreciated that a lot.  Got a salted caramel cheesecake slice to share which was very good.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals and the portions are definitely generous.  I gave it 4 stars since I didn't wanna let my bad experience completely negatively influence my vote. Especially when I got compensated and everyone else liked their food. :)
Mia P.,"El Paso, TX",2,32,,1.0,5/1/2016,"The food is great but the service is horrible! The attitude is clearly that they are serving tourists they wont see again, so they are not even trying. Not coming back!"
Lisa B.,"Niddrie, Australia",4,13,,3.0,12/29/2016,"Our youngest wanted to try this place so reluctantly we agreed to get a buzzer and wait 20 minutes for a table, which isn't too bad given how long you can wait for. They do it really well once you get in in terms of service, menu is huge as are the meals.  The food is good and given the size not bad value.  Beer expensive and no prices on the menu."
Nikki S.,"Honolulu, HI",7,15,1,5.0,3/23/2015,"First off, this is one of my favorite restaurants on the island. The wait is always pretty long but I don't mind because the great food & awesome service make up for it.  I've had great waiters in the past when I come to this restaurant but tonight I was blessed with the best waitress of all. Jess P. is such an amazing, upbeat, energetic & efficient waitress. It always makes your visit 100 times better when you can laugh & joke around with your waitress. I came with 10 other people & she didn't miss anything. She was fast to refill drinks, fast with the appetizers, entrees, dessert, checks, everything! I will definitely be back in the hopes of being served by Jess P."
Yen L.,"Melbourne, Australia",1,7,14,4.0,6/9/2016,"We love this place! Ok, so the food is not mind blowingly amazing but it sure is tasty and a good feed! The food servings are ginormous and even the drinks! It's certainly is great value for money. If you don't finish your food you can take it away. The menu is HUGE. There certainly is something for everyone on the menu. We have been twice in the week we were in Waikiki. The first time we had grilled fish tacos and Evelyn's Favourite Rigatoni pasta & a slice of the fresh strawberry cheesecake. Both mains were great & the cheesecake was nice - though I'm not much of a cheesecake person but I had to try it while I was there. After seeing the next table order burgers we were excited to come back and try the burgers for ourselves. The second time we had the Americana burger with sweet potato fries and the Traditional burger with fries. Wow! The burgers there are fantastic! The meat patty is thick and juicy and cooked to your own liking. The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. All meals were fresh and the service is quick. Best to go during lunch or before the dinner rush as there is ALWAYS a 30-45 minute lineup for dinner time. Were contemplating going back on our last day here!"
Nikidrea E.,"Wahiawā, HI",4,35,36,5.0,9/26/2015,The food is probably the best on the island of you want to have comparable food to what you would have on the mainland. Many restaurants in Hawaii lack flavor or some component that makes it exciting because they cater to the customs of East Asian cuisine because they make up a huge portion of tourism here. I've had a lot of things that weren't good or bad. The food here made me want more with each bite. I like big flavor in my food. My palette craves that kind of stimulation. This place is great on flavor. Customer service is good also.its a bit noisy but the location along the strip couldn't be quiet.
Andi F.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",4,85,2,4.0,4/27/2016,"We almost always enjoy our meal here!! Nice staff, good food and pleasant environment."
Doris B.,"Honolulu, HI",5,37,29,3.0,8/9/2015,"3.5 to be exact. Kamaainas but first time at the Cheesecake Factory. Pass this place many times & the long lines scared this local girl away. but hubby wanted to try it so we got into the long line & reached the check in counter at 7:45pm. we were informed that approximate wait time was 1hr 25 minutes. they didn't have those buzzer things (all gone!) so we were told to return at 8:30pm. returned at 8:30pm & was given one, then to be told that I had 45 more minutes of wait time. on a regular day I would be like, screw that, but I was feeling good so OK.  we got buzzed in at 9:15pm & got seated in front of the 2 guy band. songs were OK but personally, they need to jam it up a bit. it was too mellow for a Saturday night. we ordered the bistro shrimp scampi, harvest chicken salad, crispy crab wontons.  complimentary bread while u wait.  the food was very tasty. huge portion so hubby & I shared. service was great, our waitress was nice & attentive although she took awhile to come back around, but we didn't mind. my ONLY complaint... not the wait because I knew after reading the Yelp reviews that we were gonna wait.. my complaint was our B52 shots. It wasn't one. when we got it, I knew the bartender had it wrong because it was COLD. this drink comes in room temperature. it consists of grand marnier, baileys, Kahlua... prepared in that order. I don't know wtf he put in there, it had some type of green chopped something. hubby drank his & almost barffed. I told my waitress of my disappointment. some minutes later the manager came & I told her the shot was made incorrectly & I don't want to pay for it. she apologized & said of course not I won't pay for it. when the bill came in... of course not I did not pay for my shot that I refused to drink, but I was charged for hubby's one. OK I'll pay... but from the bill I knew what the bartender did not put in the shot: grand marnier. for a big & national restaurant, it was very disappointing that their bartendar(s) are not familiar with drinks. lesson learned: I wont order any special drinks not on the menu. other than that. good food experience!"
Tom S.,"Waialua, HI",0,40,,1.0,2/12/2015,"Why would I come here again? Of course you know about the insane wait already. Besides that, we had such a bad dining experience we literally started laughing.   We were actually looking around for the hidden cameras as we couldn't believe it was real! Our food was inconsistent, but the service was the worst I have ever experienced.  The management should be let go for putting such a bad server on the floor.  Our waiter was a boy named Jesse and if it wasn't his first day ever in a restaurant I would be surprised. After an amazingly bad service, he capped it off by making us wait for our check for 15 minutes while he talked with the lady at the table next to us - five feet away!  If I wasn't in vacation mode I would have exploded.  Instead we got to laughing so hard I cried.  Jesse obviously had never been trained.  Good thing this place doesn't need our business."
James S.,"Lynchburg, VA",45,10,1,5.0,9/19/2015,"Absolutely fantastic service! Was a large crowd when we arrived and the wait was minimal. We really didn't expect to get seated so quickly.  Our server was Avery knowledgeable and attentive. Food arrived as ordered and was cooked as requested. The shrimp was a little on the bland side but not too awful bad. Would expect something a bit fresher being on an island in the Pacific.  Cheesecake selection was out of this world and of the two we tried, both were absolutely wonderful!"
Alejandra F.,"Vine Grove, KY",209,105,120,4.0,6/8/2014,"Love this place and the wheat bread!  Cheesecake Factory is kind of expensive to begin with, so I was expecting crazy prices since we're in Hawaii, but the prices seemed to be more or less the same as on the mainland. I'm pretty sure dinner here was cheaper than what we normally pay at Chili's for our family of four.  We arrived just in time to beat the dinner rush, and were seated fairly quickly. Our server was FAST and attentive.  The portions are pretty huge, so there was plenty of food to take home with us.  Will definitely be returning when we're in the Waikiki area."
Jaushlyn M.,"Honolulu, HI",86,3,1,1.0,5/23/2015,"There was food and debris on my seat, so I used my hand to clear it off. On the first swipe, a shard of glass got caught in my middle finger. My blood loss (some got on the table, my fork, and seat) was only worth a free dessert ($8.50)...REALLY?! I thought my pain and suffering would've been worth more than that!!! Come on #cheesecakefactory you can do better than that. Don't worry, I'll be making sure everyone knows what happened until I feel like enough has been done to correct the situation."
R P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,111,,3.0,10/26/2016,We got in late and saw the Cheesecake Factory and went for dinner.  The food was good but while in Hawaii I would recommend a local place.  Our server was outstanding and made our visit worth while.
Jonathan H.,"Landover, Greater Landover, MD",83,11,5,5.0,4/22/2015,No Sheldon Cooper. No Penny. But plenty of fun on the bun! So what there was a line? The food was worth every step and every bite. The atmosphere was worth the hype!
Lena B.,"Aiea, HI",0,48,71,2.0,2/21/2016,"One hour wait, I signed up for, so I can't complain too much about that. Just know if you come here, it's rarely ""ready to serve""... So, expect a wait and don't be hungry. 15 minutes after being seated and I'm feeling very lonely... No water! No waiter! And I'm thirsty. Dreading how long it's going to take for me to get food."
Kevin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",774,291,184,3.0,11/30/2013,"As a local, I don't really get to come here as often. Let's be honest everyone, NO ONE likes to deal with the traffic and parking that is Waikiki.  I haven't been here in years, but recently got to return due to a little staycation and seized the opportunity. I arrived Friday around 6pm and was frantically running towards the door after seeing families and couples lining the outside seating area and walls waiting to go in. I was told my party would have to wait an hour. Ok, not as bad as it could have been. The wait passed by quickly and we were seated shortly after coming back in. Now, the one thing I usually warn people about the Cheesecake Factory is that the prices are a little steep but the portions are that much steeper. No, they are HUGE. I always have enough for a full lunch the next day. Now that's saying something, because I usually eat a lot. My favorite dish there is the Chicken Bellagio. It's bread crumb-crusted chicken filet topped with prosciutto served on a bed of basil pasta and an arugula salad on top. And like I said, it's HUGE. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I also tried the Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms this visit and dat sauce! Need I say more? Onto dessert. Who goes to the CHEESECAKE factory without getting cheesecake?! Blasphemy. I've tried several in the past. Honorable mentions going out to the White Chocolate Raspberry, Lemoncello and the Strawberry Original. Tonight, we decided to split the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's two layers of red velvet cake along with two layers of normal cheesecake, which equals heaven in your mouth. Done! Parking, for those of you not staying in Waikiki, is validated for the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center for you brave souls that wish to enter Waikiki's madness."
