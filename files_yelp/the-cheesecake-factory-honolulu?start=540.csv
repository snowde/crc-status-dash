KC C.,"Kailua, HI",1,94,681,4.0,8/31/2015,"Hit or miss... Depending on who is serving you, your experience is great or horrible. They don't take reservations so I recommend anybody who's coming here to put their name down and go shopping while they wait. Food portions are HUGE. Some say it's expensive, but to me, you may pay extra $s but your are getting three times bigger meal than the normal restaurants. I like it here overall... :)"
April J.,"Lorton, VA",0,107,,1.0,4/24/2016,Overpriced. Over iced drinks. 1 draft beer and sangria with a ton of ice $20 plus tip. Didn't bother ordering food because both plates with bread were dirty.
Kelly M.,"Honolulu, HI",70,802,21,3.0,5/17/2014,"Great for a large group.   High enough table turnover that they can handle parties if 6, or 8, or 10 without missing a beat. Pretty good food.  Nothing is a home run, but every thing is respectable.  Lots of variety on the menu, so everyone is sure to find something they want. Parking is easy, 2 hours free with validation, just $1 an hour after that. Highly recommend for birthdays, or after graduation, or anytime the whole extended family is gathering together."
Barry B.,"Honolulu, HI",32,25,7,5.0,1/18/2016,"I eat here often, when eating alone.   I walk by both bars, looking for an empty seat.  If there is not one, I go somewhere else.  The food is great and bartenders never fail to provide attentive service.  Sherry and Julia are the bomb.  They serve huge portions at reasonable prices. I think the negative reviews come from folks who wait 1-3 hours to get in.  I have never done this and never intend to.   If had waited this long I would be very cranky, myself . Why do these people not go to some place that takes reservations?"
Nicole H.,"Kaneohe, HI",177,14,7,1.0,4/20/2016,The worst experience that I've ever had!!!! I ordered the combo Steak Diane and Chicken Medeira it was burnt to a crisp like leathered beef jerky my husband ordered Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi and he got Salmon and shrimp instead that was at 9 pm we sat at 830 pm they redid both orders then my husbands steak and shrimp comes at 930 pm and my steak and chicken comes out 20 minutes later at 950 pm. We kept asking for water refills and only at 955 pm did we get it. We ordered to appetizers the guacamole that we said spicy which had zero spice or flavor we had to add salt the chips were cold and oily. The tomato mozzarella toast was ok but super sweet like they added sugar to it which was strange. I also ordered a mixed drink that tasted like diabetes in a glass. I took one sip and told the waitress to take it away. Again asked for more water which of course never came. The second time around that the food came out my steak Diane was so blue it had a pulse and was cold and my husbands was cold also. Strange yet bad experience. The waitstaff kept banging our booth and I was so upset that I just had to leave so at 958 asked for check. They comped the drink and a free slice of cheesecake. I wish we saved our money and went elsewhere
Trisha G.,"Waipio, HI",143,311,428,3.0,5/11/2014,"If I could describe this place in one word, it would be CROWDED.  I have been here on different days of the week at all different times and there is never a short line.  I even called in an order once for pick up and it was an one and a half hour wait.  I couldn't believe it.   Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, and of course the CHEESECAKE is to die for.  My go to is the BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE which has a layer of banana cream, fresh whipped cream and fresh sliced bananas. Parking is in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center lot.  DON'T park in the hotel lot... they will not validate.   Bottom line: Opt for another location for food and just order a cheesecake to go from the little take out counter in the front.  Even with that, you will wait in a pretty long line and will be swished into the front area (where loads of people will be waiting for seats).  But at least the wait will be relatively short."
Jack W.,"Fort Riley, KS",23,10,27,4.0,7/5/2015,"So the 4th of July me and the family went here before the start of fireworks. We got here about 1730 and didn't get seating till 1845 but we knew it would be a long wait. The food was pretty good, my youngest daughter had a Cuban sandwich I asked for no mustard and they still put it on there."
Jennifer L.,"Honolulu, HI",163,164,51,4.0,4/27/2014,"The wait is horrible for dinner! Expect to wait anywhere from 45-90 minutes if you don't plan right. Go earlier so you catch the pre-dinner rush! Otherwise you can grab a buzzer, walk around Waikiki for a bit, and head back in time to get called.  On the bright side, the walk will help your appetite! They have a huge amount of cheesecake to choose from! Wow! I like the dulce de leche even though I need to share it.  I can't do the seafood dishes because I'm not a fan but the sandwiches are yummy. I like their selection of appetizers! Sometimes I just grab a couple to share and I'm full! Great portions. Enough for leftovers."
Portia F.,"Honolulu, HI",78,41,72,2.0,7/24/2016,"Food is so good when dining in but takeout is a hot mess.  I waited in that long line so my mother in law called in the order.  The girl who answered said I still have to wait until the line, which is fine because I was already in the line.  I get to almost the front of the line and a girl behind the counter asks me what I want to order.  I said I'm picking up and order, she tells me I don't have to wait and to go to the register and see Cassandra.  I get to the register and there was a girl and a guy, so I figure this girl is Cassandra. She said did you out s phone order in?  I said yes.  She said, remember j told you, you have to wait in the line.  I said I was but your workers told me to come see you to pay, you're Cassandra right?, she turns around and yells at the staff right in front of me and the other customers.  She told them if someone is ordering cheesecake then they have to wait in line.  She then went from scary to nice telling me she's not going to tell me to go back in line and let's me pay.  It was a little uncomfortable, I'll think twice about ordering food here."
Tim M.,"Rincon, GA",0,11,,3.0,11/28/2016,Food was really good service a little slow. Menu had so many choices. Wasn't the cleanest cheesecake factory that I've been to
Ray P.,"Sunset, Vancouver, Canada",1,8,2,1.0,5/31/2016,"In an effort to seat, serve and feed the long lineups of hungry patrons, this place has compromised quality.  Our first time here was in 2009 and our experience was great. I remembered we ordered the wasabi crusted ahi tuna and it tasted marvellous.  We returned in 2016 with the same level of enthusiastic expectations but was completely letdown. We ordered a similar ahi tuna dish on noodles and it was TERRIBLE! The fish was badly seared and looked nothing like how ahi tuna should be. It was so bland that we needed a side of soy sauce to season. Moreover the noodles were hard and stuck together like a rice cake. The only thing remotely edible was the side of roasted veggies.  To make matters worse, the item we ordered was market priced and it certainly wasn't cheap."
Pat Q.,"Fort Worth, TX",90,128,180,4.0,1/5/2015,"Love this place!  No matter what state we are in the menu, service and food is always constant.  Their menu is very versatile and extensive.  Today we ordered the Cobb Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing in the regular size because my husband and I was planning to share it.  Wow!  When it came out it was BIG, plenty for two people.        The food was delicious and our server was so pleasant and professional.  We sat outside and people watched as we enjoyed our meal.  The weather was perfect and our experience was wonderful."
Mike Z.,"Placentia, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/30/2017,Last week while on our honeymoon we decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki. Obviously the waiting line was a mile long so we walked into the bar. When we noticed several empty tables we asked one of the employees if we could take one. We were told it was open seating in the bar and we could even order food in the bar so we sat down. A waiter came and took our drink order and then we told him we wished to order food. At that time we were told we had to leave the table because a hostess had not seated us. We explained what another employee had told us but he insisted that we must leave the table immediately or we would be removed. Are you kidding me! We are in our 60's and we were embarrassed and humiliated by this treatment. I will never step foot in a Cheesecake Factory again. Even if another employee had seated us by mistake they should have honored our patronage and counseled the employee later. There was no excuse for this.
Matheus T.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",5,9,3,5.0,1/17/2016,"Sorry for my further english mistakes guys But I can't help not doing this review I've been in hawaii for 2 weeks with my friend on the last winter Gave myself this farewell from north America before going back to Brazil My hotel was pretty close to the cheesecake factory so I went there 3 times  so, let's go to what matters; the restaurant is in the most touristic area you will find in waikiki, so expect to wait before going inside, everyone is always so busy with so many clients  The food is amazing, tried the burgers and the pasta with meatballs which didn't disappointed me at all The waiters are always a lot of sympathy  Always trying to make us feel some warmth from them and showing they wish of making us enjoy the time there And to finish, the cheesecake is the cherry of the cake Unfortunately they didn't have all the flavours as they had on the menu which is understandable because I went there always for dinner and on busy days Live music and nice price The best in waikiki!  This huge review worth to be written"
Luca M.,"Milan, Italy",7,126,,5.0,8/26/2015,"We are ""regulars"" at the Cheesecake Factory at the Ceasar's Palace in Vegas and visited a few others so when we were looking for a place to grab a bite near our hotel after we just arrived in Honolulu the local branch of Cheesecake Factory was an easy decision to make. The quality is amazing just like in any other Cheesecake Factory so there's little to add... just go there for lunch, dinner or just for a slice of cake and you won't regret it."
Lorena B.,"Kapolei, HI",23,15,134,4.0,6/22/2014,I haven't been here in a very long time and don't remember how it was. My friend and I were determine to get a chance to eat here. We decided to come her for her birthday.  We came here 6/21/14 with our boyfriends. We came in the morning right when they opened because we knew that they get crazy busy and wanted to avoid that. As we walked in we were greeted to a friendly staff. Our waiter was nice. Though some time took between our appetizers and entree we didn't mind. The appetizers were good but I was very sad that all of our pasta was on the salty side. We didn't want to be rude and try to eat as much as we could. We ended up telling our waiter but only about one of the dishes and just decided that we wanted to get dessert already. Love the cheesecakes!! (main reason we really came lol) Overall I would like to try this place again.
Rhys A.,"Seattle, WA",0,30,,4.0,8/23/2015,"I'll get right to the food : Nachos, with real cheese not the liquid one, no meat, not enough jalapeños but ""THE BEST"" I've personally ever had. Chicken sliders with french fries, delicious. Shepherds Pie, filling and pretty tasty. Good flavor to the ground beef. Crab dip, meh, I've had better. Miso grilled salmon with chinese peas and mushrooms...awesome!!!, Linda's cake, amazing, I wish I could have a piece daily with coffee, lol...it is so yummy. Mocha coffee, pass, for the price the flavor isn't up to par. Dinner bread is good too.  The wait is long, ridiculously long and it's so crowed, uncomfortably so. The staff are very friendly and patient. John Helm is there in the evening providing live music."
Tessa S.,"Oceanside, CA",0,4,,3.0,11/1/2016,"The waiters were incredibly polite and I enjoyed the bread our table was provided with. Yet, the veggie burger was underwhelming as the patty was lukewarm and crumbled apart. While I was disappointed by the meal, my family enjoyed theirs."
Kurt C.,"Mililani, HI",13,4,,3.0,4/14/2016,I don't like the fact that I can't make a reservation here. Waiting in line was forever and time is money
Emmanuel B.,"Madison, NJ",278,208,61,5.0,1/29/2015,"Definitely very good... The portion are definitely very well sized and I doubt that you will leave the table hungry.  Food quality looks very good.  Yes you have to wait,  but however it is well organized and you can just walk around while waiting the buzzer to blink. Definitely good and will go again."
