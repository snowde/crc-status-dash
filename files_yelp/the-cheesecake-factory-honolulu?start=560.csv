Darlene P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,18,4,4.0,11/18/2016,"Is it worth the wait??? 2 1/2 hours is a long time! Ok so we had 12 in our party.....come on that's still a long time! If it weren't my daughters birthday we definitely would have gone elsewhere. By the time we got out of there was after 1030pm.....and people  were still coming in! Unbelievable. The food is good but not that good! Don't go on a weekend, that's my advice!!"
Elisa G.,"Honolulu, HI",7,6,6,4.0,8/13/2015,"First time at Cheesecake Factory. I was surprised by the wait and the volume of people wanting to eat there. Most of the crowd appeared to be tourists. Was seated after 30mins. Server was lovely. Cocktails were very large and tasty. Order chicken blaster appetiser and it was HUGE. Such a large serve shared between 2 of us we were incredibly full before mains. Mains were Americana burger and crispy fish tacos. Burger was delicious. Tacos were average. Was so full that hardly ate half the main meal. Ordered ""outrageous"" cheesecake to go. Was delicious."
Data H.,"Mililani, HI",5,32,42,4.0,5/22/2015,"Whenever I'm in Waikiki, I stop by the Cheesecake factory to get my daughter her favorite dish: Pasta DaVinci  Service was great, choice of selections is a bit overwhelming, but in my eyes thats a GOOD thing."
Mar M.,"Līhuʻe, HI",2,9,8,1.0,8/11/2015,I was there and I ordered pasta and the pasta was awful soooo terrible that I cant describe it.....my meal was enough for two more people.....the cheesecake are terrible.....whats wrong with you....?  I know german cheesecakes and I know Italian pasta....why you cant do it like other restaurants.....or is your philosophy quantitate is better as quality??? Never ever......dont waste your time guys...
Keoni M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",2,13,,1.0,9/25/2016,Called ahead to see if they could accommodate 17 people and they said yes but when we arrived we were quoted a three hour wait. Had we known it'll be that long we wouldn't have told everyone to come down so now we are trying to find a place on such short notice. Not complaining about the wait but complaining about the lack of knowledge and information given to customers.
Nat N.,"Honolulu, HI",1124,912,7069,5.0,10/3/2011,"My 5-star rating applies to their Cheesecake, nothing more.  I've personally sampled their Tiramisu, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, and Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake slices, and they are all winnahs!   I LOVE to order these slices ""to-go"" from the take out counter, that way I can pig out in the comforts of my own home.  What turns me on almost as much as the cheesecake itself are their whipped cream dispensing machines that they have at the take out counter.  Similar to how kids (and some adults!) like to spray the cheeze-whiz directly into their mouths, I would love to consume their whipped cream directly from that machine, with a side of cheesecake to go with.  Mmmm!"
Darcy e.,"Honolulu, HI",0,14,,2.0,4/4/2017,"My friend gave me a gift card so I thought I would pick up a cheesecake for a party I was going to that night. I was very disappointed in their service. When I walked in, the mood was very chaotic and in a frenzy.  I tried to get the attention of the workers that were running by but they were too busy to stop and respond to my question on where do I purchase a cheesecake.  I finally find the line on my own and am standing in front of the cashier for 10 minutes and she doesn't give me the time of day.  In addition, I asked the manager for validation.  He then said sure, took my ticket and then walked away to help someone.  I then asked another person there for my tix.  I told him the manager took it and never gave it back to me.  He came back later and first feigned ignorance.  Then he saw that he left the tix on the counter.  Gave it to me and without an apology.  Will never go back again. Perhaps they think it doesn't matter to provide good service because they will always have long lines of tourists purely due to name recognition but that is so NOT Aloha....."
Johnny H.,"Honolulu, HI",4,27,18,5.0,4/3/2016,"Came here for breakfast, ordered an omelette with tomato and bagel. Compared to zippy a for example great ingredients for the price."
Jayme W.,"Brentwood, CA",5,47,6,5.0,3/2/2016,"My family and I went here on a few occasions during our vacation. On Christmas Eve 2015 this place was PACKED! 2+hour wait type of packed. We ended up getter my lucky and were handed a pager from another party who had already been waiting 1.5 hours and so our 30 minute wait was a piece of cake! Once we were seated our waiter was absolutely amazing! Super friendly and outgoing. You never knew or felt like the place was crazy packed and that the servers were running around crazy. The food didn't take long at all and it all came at once with 4 people bringing it all to the table. It was all correct and delicious! We ended up ordering cheesecakes to go since we were all so stuffed. Way to go Cheesecake Factory, you made the end of our Christmas Eve perfect! We were all very impressed on how well this restaurant ran and worked together. Top notch customer service!"
Cody S.,"Aiea, HI",70,104,63,4.0,1/27/2016,"We came here on Sunday and it was packed for football, but we got lucky with two seats at the end of the bar.  The bartender was super busy but made it a point to let us know that she saw us and to let her know when she was ready. When we were ready we ordered our first round of drinks, and she gave us some time to look over the menu. The menu is HUGE, so many options, but a little overwhelming. But it's great when you don't know what you want, because there is a little of everything.  We finally decided on two burgers. Real original, I know. The guy next to us got his food before us, and he ordered a while after us. The bartender noticed as well and immediately got someone's attention and asked them to check on our food.  A few minutes went by with nothing, so she called for a manager. A manager was over by our side promptly,  apologizing for the food taking longer than expected. He told us that when we finished our burgers that desert was on them and even if we were full to order it to go.  While we waited for our burgers, another patron was talking to the bartender as if he knew her and his laugh was contagious. He seemed funny and someone full of spunk and stories. So we decided to send him over a shot. He was awesome and came to thank us. :) Our burgers came!!! Yeah! The food itself was good. Nothing over the top, cooked to the temp that we ordered!!  The burgers were huge, I couldn't finish mine. (which is rare) we were soooooo full!!! So, we ordered the red velvet cheesecake to go. (it was amazing)  The manager came back over to apologize again for the slow service (it ended up being a mix up in the kitchen) and said because we only got one desert that he took off the shot that we ordered. It was so nice, over the top and not expected. Thank you!!  Also, another thank you to the waiter that was so nice, polite and had such good positive vibes. He wasn't our waiter, but he was walking by and my bf was curious to what drinks he was carrying and he took the time to stop tell us what drinks they were, what was in them, and he even suggested his favorite. It was just really nice because he took the time to stop and talk to us, he wasn't annoyed or taken back.  The bartender's name was Erica, the waiter was Joe, and I apologize I forget the managers name, but I want to say it was Bryan. (but I'm not 100% sure on that one) the three of them deserve some recognition for thier outstanding service!!!  Thank you so much to all three of you for going above the standard and making my birthday lunch perfect!! We will be back, soon!!!"
A P.,"Burbank, CA",0,24,7,5.0,11/30/2015,Great food and even greater customer service!!! There are so many great things to choose from so theres always something for even the pickiest of eaters.
Michael W.,"Melbourne, Australia",28,185,137,3.0,1/3/2015,"If your hungry, you might need to try and find somewhere else to eat, because you will be lining up for a while. On our visit to the island, being from Australia, the Cheesecake Factory is a very hard place to walk past. We had walked down the Main Street quite a few nights in a row to find that the Cheesecake Factory ALWAYS had massive lines out the front. This one night, we finally bit the bullet and decided to line up. About 45 minutes went past of being in this line, till we finally walk through the front door. Another 10 minutes goes by, and yes. We made it to the front of the line. The server asks how many people, which we reply only two. The server then hands over a pager & tells us to wait outside till we are called. Are you kidding me I think to myself.  We were at the edge of wanting to walk away but hung in there because of the journey so far.  Another 35 minutes later and we were in. Like all other Cheesecake Factories, the menu is about as long as the Bible. The quality of the food was much the same as the main land, however lacked something I couldn't quite put my finger on. The staff were lovely, however they seemed to rush you a little, but judging by the line out the front that kept on growing, it was somewhat understandable."
Navjot S.,"New Hyde Park, NY",41,61,6,2.0,2/9/2015,"There was just two of us and we had to wait almost an hour for a table. Our server was very nice and he was trying to give us service while looking after 10ish other tables. We ordered the chipotle pasta with chicken on the side, but there was chicken in the pasta =( The waiter was very sorry and the manager came by to speak with us also - the manager seemed quite indifferent but he did apologize as well and said 'things can get crazy here at times.' We had to wait several minutes to get our new pasta dish. The cheesecake was spot-on and so were the avocado egg rolls. My mood was quite bad with the chicken in the pasta - the waiter saw this so he credited us money for the pasta dish. Decent place, but you are better off finding a less commercialized and over crowded place."
Geno P.,"San Diego, CA",131,656,303,2.0,7/1/2013,"Ok seriously - why are you considering eating at the Cheesecake Factory when you are in Hawaii?!?! What are you doing? Are you a newlywed or something? Well do you want to stay married? Then this is not your spot. This restaurant has the longest and unnecessary wait time on the Waikiki strip. Every night I see dozens of people with these sad, starved faces sitting around the Royal Hawaiian waiting for their little buzzer to buzz for more than an hour, when they can go right across the street and get a great meal for less money. It makes zero sense, because you aren't getting anything here you can't get at any other Cheesecake Factory. Actually that's partially true. You will definitely get a bill priced higher than what you are used to seeing. But hey, if you flew all the way to Waikiki to pay for it, who am I to judge. Food wise, consistency wise, and quality wise, this location is on par with the rest of the chain. I've eaten here twice (situations beyond my control) and never had an issue.  But when you are in Hawaii, and you have tools like Yelp at your disposal, there is no reason not to go try something new!"
Marty M.,"Coquitlam, Canada",0,7,,3.0,5/4/2016,"inconsistent service. Came here 3 times and each time the service became worse. The pasta's are delicious , as well as the cheesecakes (duh) . Go at lunch time to avoid the lines and get a better deal ""lunch specials "" which will still be a big enough portion."
Julie O.,"Waipahu, HI",15,121,56,4.0,3/22/2016,"The best part of this restaurant is the cheesecake options. The slice is shareable and the taste is amazing. Creamy texture with a bust of flavor. I love the addition of the whip cream swirl on the side. Just a precaution, make reservations and come early. It's super crowded."
Fredeelyn F.,"Honolulu, HI",12,33,48,4.0,3/15/2014,"This is my go to place when I want a great meal. You know the food is good when no one minds an hour plus wait. I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory since it open and I've really never been disappointed. Everything is good from drinks to desserts ... my favorite is their Passion Fruit Mohito, firecracker salmon appetizer and any of their chocolate cheesecakes. The entrees are huge btw, you're going to end up taking leftovers home unless you share.  The last time I went there, my Chicken Bellagio was REALLY salty. They took it back but said their basil sauce is usually salty. But I thought it was too much. An otherwise yummy meal made totally inedible. I ended up just sharing my friend's entree. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake made up for everything."
Stephanie A.,"Albuquerque, NM",16,159,69,4.0,2/25/2015,"Oh lordy, this place is RIDICULOUSLY packed come dinner time.  I believe there is even a wait to actually put your name down to wait for a table!  But what can I say, its Cheesecake Factory which is always good in my book.  I honestly don't understand why tourists would come here when they can eat at any of these local seafood and steak restaurants but hey, that's their choice.  Since I'm moving off island I'll just go ahead and share my secret:  Eat at the bar.  The bar and the table tops around the bar are all open seating.  We always get lucky and find someone paying their bill, grabbing their leftover bags and getting ready to walk out and then we snag the table in less than 10 minutes.  I wouldn't eat here otherwise.  The wait is just so damn long!  Then we order a slice of cheesecake to go and enjoy that at home in our PJ's watching a movie. Onto the food - my favorite dish is the Chicken Castoletta.  Its perfection, I don't know how to describe it.  My husband got me hooked on it awhile back and we usually get that when we come."
Xaundria K.,"Waianae, HI",7,19,26,4.0,5/27/2015,"First off it was an hour and a half wait, the place is always busy so understandable, however the hostess said wait time is 50 mins, we got one of the thicker pager like buzzers, it doesn't buzz if you go too far away from the restaurant but she insisted it would be awhile, so we walked around waikiki mall for only 30 mins it took us 10 mins to walk back, the buzzer never went off. So we started to worry and politely asked again how long its gonna be and that it never buzzed we waited over our expected time frame, they looked confused and basically got us a table within seconds with no explanation. My guess is they messed up and didn't want us to complain so they sat us as soon as possible. The staff was friendly but in my opinion they need to check there equipment, and no apologizes or explanation, makes me uncomfortable.   Other then that service was fast, friendly, food was great, the filet minogne was soft like buttah! Macaroni cheeses bites was winnah! And the snickers cheesecake was awesome! Although we live far away it was a great experience but I don't like the wait time."
Marshall P.,"Brentwood Bay, Canada",0,14,1,2.0,9/6/2016,"This used to be my go to place to eat when I come to Waikiki with my family . Huge portions good flavours and great dessert with friendly service . Last night however was not the case. We ordered all the same items we always get the pasta was horrible and come on $20 for a plate of plain pasta with 4 shrimp ? Sauce had zero flavour shrimp were way over cooked and to top it out our waitress was a huge snake. We ordered way too much food and didn't eat much of it so we asked to get the food we didn't touch packed up, she didn't mention but it was so we could give it to the homeless people out front of our hotel. The woman rolled her eyes as she smiled sure . Tossed the plate on the desk and went to mention it to a male server as she looked over at us and he rolled his eyes too . As she returned with our bags of food she saw the appetizer we had packed up and was like "" oh right I forgot I already had to pack something for you here's another bag"" and just slid it on the table and walked away shaking her head . Now I'm just guessing but Cheesecake Factory is a HUGE busy restaurant here and they probably hire the best they can find because they have a name to keep In this economy I would try to do my best to make people happy and make tips so you're not the homeless person sitting on the street who's about to get the food you're so reluctant to pack to go one day ."
