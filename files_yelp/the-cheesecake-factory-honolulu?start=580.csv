Amire' P.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",2,16,18,4.0,5/24/2015,"Like any typical Cheesecake Factory. We were craving some food and this was the closest to something at home. It's very packed with tourists, esp on Sunday's because of their brunch.  It has a variety of food for vegetarians, meat eaters and gluten free people.  Service is good but at times slow due to the waiters taking care of so many people."
Hiyori M.,"Honolulu, HI",40,13,10,5.0,10/20/2014,"The menu is wonderful! We all know that by now, but I was surprised and how wonderful the takeout was also. They loaded my burrito! (If you lived in CA and looking for a great burrito this is the place to go) kinda more modernized but very authentic!!"
Holly P.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",0,3,3,5.0,6/23/2015,My first time at The Cheesecake Factory and it did NOT disappoint! I had the Thai Glazed Salmon and it was delicious!! The service was even better. I wish I could have remembered her name but she was fantastic! Had to wait about 30-40 minutes before we got seated but it was most definitely worth it!
Nicholas A.,"Honolulu, HI",58,18,18,1.0,11/27/2015,"2 days ago with my classmate, who was doing a ""Restaurant Evaluation"" for Dining room. We got there about 1ish.  The guy controlling the front was polite and direct. When it came to our host, Paul, the atmosphere went from 100% satisfactory to sero really quick. He just grabbed the menus and started walking in a rush, and no one was behind us. There was no greeting at all! If there was it was under his breathe. I would have preferred a more welcoming introduction or ""have you guys been here before?"" Keeping that upbeat and positiveness. The one and only thing he did right was openning a seat for me. As awkward it kind of felt for him because I was a guy, he still did it and smiled the whole way through. I would not call this much of a ""nice save."" A smile only gets you so far, it is the attitude and actions that matters.  To start off, there was no proper greeting. Started off asking for drinks, but no formal greeting. She asked if we wanted bread, i dont know if you were suppose to make that a question. It just sounded weird when she ASKED us. As we observed, there was a lot of inconsistency. She greeted the guest next to us properly, ""I'll be your server for today."" We were working literally eating bread, and some guy with long, dreadlike hair asked if he can take it away. That was done very poorly. And we actually wanted more after. One great thing about the service today, a lot of teamwork. Towards the end though, instead of asking if we wanted dessert, she asked if we wanted dessert to-go. Is that the Cheesecake factory way? Overall, we experienced that it seemed like because we were young, our server paid little to no attention to us. But, from noticing the guests next to us, she seemed like an alright server. Aside from the end, both us and the other guest was waiting for like 15mins on our check and there were a few servers who just passed to set tables. They obviously saw that we were done and said nothing. We felt kind of discriminated possibly because the thoughts of us having a lack of knowledge on serving. I enjoyed observing because this was a perfect example of ""Poor service"". Wheres the smiles? Where is the welcoming, Aloha-spirit?  The only reason they deserve one star and because I can't do 0 is their timing on food. Food was amazing, as always! Nicely done with portion sizes and presentation. The Front of House was very inconsistent, disriminating, and unwelcoming. Very rushy, like they didn't want to serve us. I mean, would you like to take-out any dessert? What if we wanted dessert there?"
Jiyoung L.,"San Francisco, CA",1,47,48,4.0,3/13/2015,I went there early and got a table. I had shrimp gumbo and it was very delicious! Love strawberry margarita too!
Kristen K.,"Honolulu, HI",276,269,557,4.0,7/9/2013,"So this place rocks.  That is IF you can get over the fact that a.) they don't take reservations (for ANY amount of people), and b.) if the quoted 1-2 HOUR wait time doesn't completely turn you off. In any case, I present you with option c.) wait for one of the bar tables to open up (the high tops)....they are on a first-come basis. I would never (NEVER) wait that long for a restaurant. EVER. I'd rather go around the corner to McDonalds than take a little beeper and wonder what to do with myself for 120 minutes. What a waste of time! Apparently, I lack patience, whereas a lot of people do not...and they choose to suffer and endure this ungodly wait time for a table. To each's own, I guess.  Bonus points for me that I discovered that I know an old friend that now works here. So the last time we went, I got hooked up with a table super quick! Scoreeeee!  Anyway, so once you do get a table, then be ready to browse through the most extensive menu ever. It is ridiculous. But in a very, very good way. There is SO MUCH to choose from....the hard part is actually narrowing down the choices! Everything I've had here to-date has been pretty good, too. Nothing completely mind blowing, but consistent and satisfying. I always leave full and happy. I like their veggie salad (huge bowl....good to share!), their corn cakes app, and their slider combo that comes with fries. YUMM. And of course, no matter what, I am always forced against my will to eat some cheesecake or one of their other delicious desserts at the end of my meal.  Parking is validated at the Royal Hawaiian structure.  Overall, a great place that will have something for everyone in your group! (although if you group happens to be more than 6 people, you will likely all starve before you get seated at rush hour times)---don't say I didn't warn you! :)"
Blanche L.,"Honolulu, HI",162,40,20,5.0,9/28/2013,"Went here for lunch with the hubby and friends!  5 stars for the wait, we were quoted 15 min but got paged in 7 and seated 2 minutes later. The host who seated us was very nice, funny and professional. So hard to balance that but I have to say that he did a really good job. The waitress we had was fantastic! I wish I had asked what her name was so I could ask for her section again.  I got the pizza & salad lunch special and it was great and big enough for 2 or one really hungry person. I wanted to share with  my friend, but unfortunately we didn't do that. I got the hawaiian pizza and caesar salad. The hawaiian pizza had kalua pig, pineapple, red peppers and red onions. The pizza wasn't much to look at but it was so delicious that I wanted to keep eating it. The half salad I got was also pretty big and had a lot of dressing on it, I would highly recommend asking for your dressing on the side, I know I will. We all shared the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake and it was absolutely delicious. Because there were 4 of us sharing we were given an extra dollop of whipped cream. Overall from the time we got there until the time we left it was about 75 minutes. The longest wait for our food, about 20 minutes. Very impressed!"
Thomas D.,"San Francisco, CA",232,652,729,3.0,8/11/2013,"The service is very good. Prepare to wait quite a while if you get here during dinner service.  As with other Cheesecake Factories, the bar area is self- seated. Wow--I witnessed some smooth moves there tonight.  We scoped out the bar area and saw that an older couple was about to leave.  They were paying their check.  Instead of waiting an hour for a table, we were advised by the hostess to hang out in the bar area and wait for a table  to open up and then claim it.  As the older couple were paying their bill, another older couple went up to their table and began making small talk.  In no time at all, they sat down with them at their table.  There were 4 chairs.  The first couple paid their bill and the second couple scored a table.  There is another bar area in the back of the restaurant and we were able to get a seat there in about 15 minutes.  The menu is huge.  The food is average."
Peter P.,"Ottawa, Canada",26,79,22,3.0,1/25/2014,"This place is average. The decor is nice but quite frankly, it's ridiculous when you have to wait an hour to be seated....At any given time lol The food was average, but I will admit the server was excellent. Very attentive and always making sure we were ok. For the service and atmosphere it gets a 5, the food is a 1. Large portions with little flavour"
Daniel B.,"Midway Point, Australia",1,1,4,4.0,7/22/2014,Best deserts in Honolulu.  Food is fantastic and the wait service was excellent.  Definitely be going there again
Annie K.,"Honolulu, HI",116,270,342,3.0,2/16/2015,"Okay, we decided to go to Cheesecake Factory since we haven't been here for more than a year. We remember liking the food there so it wasn't a hard decision for lunch. Just the two of us so no wait for Sunday lunch.  We ordered a cup of cream of chicken soup. It's pretty tastey. Creamy, I should say. We both shared two dishes. The fried macaroni and cheese was just as cheesy and deep fried as I remembered it. Still good. I had a Monte Cristo sandwich somewhere and I liked it so decided to try the cheesecake factory. I was wrong. It was nothing like the one I tried. It was too soggy from the syrup. The potatoes were burnt so I wasn't that edible.  I didn't say anything though. I'm surprised that the server brought it out.  The server was nice and the bread was still as amazing as I remembered it. Yups, the bread was the best part about lunch there. Of course, I wrapped up the bread. I couldn't resist.  And of course, the portions were so big that we couldn't have any cheesecake.  I think I will just be back for the cheesecake, next time."
Heat H.,"Honolulu, HI",260,40,9,5.0,12/26/2014,Thank GOD this restaurant is here. Best restaurant on the island. I hope they will open a lot more locations. Everything on the menu is delicious and a lot of food. It is by far the best balance between cost and quality of food. Also a very wide variety of choices.  The fresh vegetable salad is awesome!!! Mahalo!!
Laureen L.,"Aiea, HI",93,79,238,4.0,1/4/2015,"OMG! I had the warm apple crisp. Delicious! I couldn't finish it though...big portion. In addition to the apple crisp, the dessert came with 2 scoops vanilla ice cream, whip cream and caramel topping. Service was great! Will need to come back and try the brunch and dinner menu."
Frank L.,"Monterey Park, CA",149,61,94,1.0,8/22/2014,"Came in on a Sunday morning, thought we'd grab a quick breakfast before a fun afternoon of hiking and zip lining, however... breakfast was anything but quick. Though they seated us quickly, our waitress didn't take our order until 20 minutes later. She brought out some bread 45 minutes after, and when we asked about our food she rolled her eyes and said she'll check on it and it usually takes about 20 minutes. We explained that we've waited for over an hour and she barked at us like a dog in heat and said that its Sunday brunch, so they're very busy. We decided to leave after that.   GOT SEATED 10AM WAITED TIL 11:10AM AND LEFT WITHOUT FOOD"
Chad Y.,"Honolulu, HI",1056,1234,446,3.0,3/28/2011,"I understand why residents flock to the sole branch of the Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii, however I don't get the masses who come from other cities that have Cheesecake Factories and wait for an hour, just to get a table for four. It's the same menu! Anyway, the Waikiki location of the Cheesecake Factory is simply another restaurant for me that offers an insanely large menu, decent service, and a nice ambiance. It doesn't offer anything outstanding (beside an outstandingly LONG wait time for a table), however at the same time the food and service certainly doesn't disappoint.  Let's start off with the obvious, if you during the lunch or dinner rush, be prepared to wait and wait for a table. It is a rather large location, however the masses come and it can be quite a bit of wait for a table and they do not take reservations.  The menu is large and will please any palate. It is by far the largest menu selection I have ever come across (and build it yourself burger combination's don't count). However, if I'm paying for my meal, I really don't want to see ads in the menu for local establishments, nice marketing touch, but a little un-classy in my book.  The food is decent, however there are only a few highlights for me. The fried macaroni and cheese is heaven. If there was ever a moment I could die happily from one bite of food it would be that item. Nicely cooked macaroni with the perfect blend of cheeses and coated in a perfected layer of bread crumbs and deep fried, what is not to like about that! Their shepherd's pie is pretty good and I have to say I was rather impressed with the perfect blend of meats and vegetables to mashed potato ratio along with the homestyle flavors that come through. Everything else on the menu I've had such as the chinese chicken salad and their burgers and sandwiches are all decent, however nothing outstanding or noteworthy. Oh, note, the portions are pretty good sized, so if you have an appetite, you certainly can get your money's worth. Now, that's out of the way, let's be honest. You came to the CHEESECAKE factory for cheesecake? It would be weird if you went there for a sundae in my book. Anyway, the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake is bites of heaven if the mood for chocolate strikes you. The texture is a little heavier than your standard cheesecake, however the rich and bold chocolate flavors will certainly put a buckle in your knees. Try the Dulce De Leche cheesecake if the mood for caramel strikes you or perhaps the Strawberry if you want something sweeter. Note, the strawberries they put on are large and amazingly good. The Chocolate Raspberry Truffle is a nice blend if you want something sweet and savory and the Oreo cheesecake is perfect for the cookie lover in us all. Did I mention I like cheesecake... Service is good with the wait staff being extremely pleasant and generally speaking very attentive. It has been rare that my water has gotten close to empty and they are quick to check in on you and the food arrives in a wonderful orchestration. Parking is available in the Royal Hawaiian Center lot and it is a bit of walk from the garage, but they validate for up to two hours. The ambiance is comfortable and while dimly lit, it serves its purpose well for group outings or that nice dinner for two. If you just want dessert and go, the cheesecake counter is right at the front of the store and you can always take your dessert out on the beach! Dessert and service are certainly extreme highlights, however it certainly doesn't make up for the long wait and the so-so meal menu."
Keith A.,"Bend, OR",84,254,764,5.0,3/24/2013,"Previous 5 star review still stands.  In short, this is great food at a decent price with huge portions.  If you sit on the patio and arrive before 5, I'd be surprised if you left here dissatisfied.  We dined here Saturday 3/16 and felt it was one of the best meals we had this trip. Enough reviews on the food, service and normal topics.  What I want to share here is the insightful discussion we had with our sever that impressed us on many levels. There was a fire in the kitchen earlier this year that shut the restaurant down for about a month.  We had read about it in our online edition of the Honolulu Star Advertiser shortly after it happened and were immediately inquisitive about how corporate handled it with their staff, etc. I'm pleased to report that according to our server they really stepped up and took care of everybody.  First, some interesting stats: this is one of the busiest locations in the nation. With over 400 on staff, they seat between 4,000 and 5,000 people PER DAY.  That alone amazed us. The efficiency of this place is astounding. Our server said that one of the first things they did was have several get togethers with tons of free food.  There isn't another Cheesecake Factory nearby so they couldn't transfer the inventory. Corporate gave it all away to the staff.   Secondly, they took care of them financially.  Granted, with the numbers they push through here, it wasn't practical to let everyone go and then re-hire and attempt to train again in a month, so paying everyone while the restaurant was inoperable was really the best business decision. Still, corporate is to be commended on their fairness.  They averaged their employees last six weeks of 2012 including tips and came up with a weekly salary.  In addition, they also allowed for you to cash in vacation time if you so desired. Our server said some employees grumbled, thinking they should have gotten more but not him. He thought it was more than fair and even took the opportunity to take his family on vacation. My wife and I could not speak highly enough about this Cheesecake Factory.  The food. The service. The atmosphere (patio, early seating) and the way in which they took care of their staff....all outstanding! Oh, and this night's dinner?  Delicious as always. I tried a new dish per our server's recommendation: Bang Bang Chicken and loved every bite!"
Carmen B.,"Atlanta, GA",7,12,50,5.0,10/28/2014,"Miss coming here on Sundays and Mondays and Friday nights and overall just miss this place. Love the variety of foods, Sunday brunch and live bands etc."
Christopher S.,"Minneapolis, MN",55,282,772,4.0,12/24/2013,"Very solid food. Long waits for dinner.  The menu is expansive, as is the wait for dinner (up to two hours sometimes).  There are two bars where you can wait - or eat - the bar in the back is under utilized, just ask for directions (it's out of the hustle and bustle)."
Oscar V.,"Plymouth, MI",0,29,31,1.0,9/28/2014,One star for the Chef working the kitchen. I understand it's extremely busy however I'm very disappointed in the service and shockingly the food. My wife and I ordered a factory shop salad and fish tacos at exactly 1:08 pm and we received half of the order at 1:48pm. The fish tacos were missing the side salad and ingredients not to mention we got a Cobb salad instead of the factory chopped salad we had ordered. So we waited another 12 minutes and we received another salad that was not the one we ordered. The pictures above demonstrate the quality of food we received notice the to go bag was full of tomato juice so disappointed.  The salad was suppose to have chicken but instead just plain. The whole experience sucked. The manager on duty didn't care at all. This is the worst money spent on this vacation. AVOID THIS LOCATION GO TRY SOME LOCAL FOOD.
Ashley T.,"Honolulu, HI",65,2,2,3.0,5/20/2015,"Honestly every time I come the food, and service just keep getting worse. The workers are friendly, but they give off a vibe that they care more about customers who look like they have more money. My boyfriend and I have been sitting down waiting for awhile, watching our waiter constantly attend to other customers, not even taking our order at the very least even though he'd told us he'd help us shortly. When we do get the food it's about average, not worth the price. I guess the main thing their known for is their cheesecake not their food, so probably should keep that in mind if I don't come back. The couple sitting next to us, as they left the man commented how the service took forever, and how he thought he'd never get through it.  Do not get the lemonade, worst lemonade in my life"
