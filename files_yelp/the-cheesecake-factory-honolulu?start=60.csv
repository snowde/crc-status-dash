Gabby T.,"Honolulu, HI",56,67,222,5.0,5/20/2017,"Will you have to wait? Most likely, depending upon the time of day. Plan about an hour wait. Consider checking in and then shopping across the street.  Food is excellent. I have eaten at over 30 CCF and by far this one serves the best food. My favorite is the chicken  farfalle pasta, and CCF Waikiki prepares this item better than any other CCF.   Hands down the Waikiki CCF is amazing. The attention to detail is incredible.  I left a compliment for whoever is in charge of the kitchen as this person consistently serves the best quality and presentation of any CCF.  The Chef must take pride in the food. I am a loyal patron to this location. You may have to wait an hour so check In early and go across to the International Market Place or sit at the bar. The food is worth the wait.  Price is average for Hawaii. Service is average for Hawaii. I live here and frequent many Waikiki restaurants weekly.  Thank you Waikiki CCF!"
Pat F.,"Honolulu, HI",18,8,16,5.0,7/23/2017,"My first time to make a take-out order & it worked perfectly. I pre-ordered & everything was ready when I got there, nice & hot,  in the time I was told it'd be ready.  It was less crowded at this time so I didn't have to wait; just paid after making sure I had everything. The cashier was very attentive & thorough, even volunteering the info about National Cheesecake Day. On July 30 & 31, any slice of cheesecakes will be half price!"
Nick W.,"San Jose, CA",304,148,40,1.0,4/30/2017,"I have a gluten, soy, and dairy allergy. 3 people came out to confirm my order that I had to change 2 times.. understandable. But when I get my food and eat my rice. Half way thru there is a layer of soy sauce that I realized I was eating when unnoticed a different taste. The waiter acknowledged it and asked if I  wanted a new serving. I said no thank you. The damage was done and I'll be in pain probably by the time I get home. Nothing was done about the bill or any other follow up. Sad. I usually pick this chain when I'm traveling as a safe bet. Guess not. Update from 4 hours later: the pain is finally going down and def was exposed to gluten and soy from that sauce. Never eating at cheesecake again"
Mathilde D.,"Paris, France",0,1,2,4.0,8/22/2017,"The place was busy, but it was worth the wait. Nice food and choices for every tastes : huge menu!! Nice building too. Try not to come between the rush our 7-9pm. Huge choices of cheesecakes. We went back there also for the Sunday brunch: I took the Monte Cristo sandwich, this was a very good one and I was very full.  If you have some time to spend in Waikiki, go there and enjoy!"
Pamela V.,"Burnaby, Canada",5,117,79,4.0,6/15/2017,This place is buzzing all the time and be prepares to wait. They are very efficient though. Once in this place is huge...quite deceiving on the outside. The whole service is excellent and bot rushed. Food was absolutely delicious. Portions are big. The menu has a wide variety of choice for everyone's taste.
Scott C.,"Aiea, HI",5000,144,1100,5.0,3/30/2017,"BLUF:  5 stars for the food, service (thanks to Gloria!) and parking (fairly rare in Waikiki). Overall, attentive service, fresh breads, smooth coffee, awesome cheesecake and lots of menu choices.  Sunday brunches only available till 2:00pm Bring a jacket though as it is pretty chilly in here. (I wrote this a couple of weeks ago....I guess I missed clicking ""post"")."
Natasha T.,"Waipahu, HI",297,212,386,3.0,10/13/2016,"This is right in the heart of Waikiki so prepare to WAIT! We waited 2 hours last time, absolutely nuts.  Service is always good, food is just OK. My husband absolutely hated his orange chicken, and he isn't a picky eater. Cheesecake isn't my fave but everyone else is Gaga for it."
Aggie C.,"Kapolei, HI",528,278,2406,5.0,9/23/2016,"I have been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for a while.  The food is always consistently yummy and the customer service is great! They have a lot of room for big parties. And honestly, the cheesecake flavors are unbelievable! Because I do not feel like you want to hear the same good things, I'll skip to the good stuff of the review......if you feel you know enough..STOP! don't read anymore ^_^* Cheesecake Factory has been here for YEARS, but the lines have never died down! These are one of those places that is worth the wait!! I'm sure many will agree with me there. Or is it???  What if there was a way to get here with no line?????? Ok, I'm going to let you in on a little secret(ok it's not that secret, but it has worked for me). The best time to go to Cheesecake Factory is on Sunday morning for their Sunday Brunch!  I love the sunday specials and you still get to order the regular menu items! (say what!) The best part is there is no long lines. We are usually seated right when we get there or after 15 minutes. That's fantab! Don't you think!   That's all I got, I have a feeling I'm going to regret telling my secret. BUT I feel obliged to let people know and enjoy their food as much as I do. If I could, I'd make this review self destruct."
Jennifer Y.,"Sulphur Springs, TX",84,76,69,5.0,9/9/2017,"Friendly staff, great food. Obviously it's located in the middle of busy Waikiki so the prices are a little inflated but Cheesecake Factory makes up with it by serving great tasting food. The menu is extensive to cover whatever type of food you might be craving and can honestly be a little overwhelming upon first glance but both times I've been here I've left feeling more than satisfied with the meal and the service. The second time we went there was live music so if you're into that sort of thing then that's a plus!"
Evan K.,"Honolulu, HI",165,11,20,5.0,7/3/2017,"Even though Cheesecake Factory is a ""chain"" restaurant, the experience doesn't feel like that at all.  The menu is a novel, but that basically means there's something for everyone.  My personal favorites are the following (all 9/10 or 10/10 dishes in my opinion): Fried Calamari: The breading is light and flaky, comes with a garlic aioli sauce and marinara sauce.  Sometimes it can be a bit too salty, but 9 times out of 10 it's a good dish. Caesar Salad: The ""appetizer"" size feeds about 3-4 people; when my parents and I get the calamari and Caesar salads, we're full by the time our entrees come. Factory Nachos: The tortilla chips are really tasty and unique, the cheese sauce has hints of American cheese if that's your thing, but there are also Mexican cheeses as well.  Comes with guac, sour cream, and a lot of other fixings.   Fish Tacos (tempura style): Four fish tacos that comes with Spanish rice and beans. Cuban Sandwich: Ham, Swiss cheese, kalua pig, mustard, and pickles. California Cheese-Steak Sandwich: Basically steak, cheese, and peppers; simplicity is sometimes a good thing. Pasta Da Vinci: I get this with linguine (originally comes with penne, which I don't think absorbs the sauce as well); comes with chicken and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Now...for the CHEESECAKES: S'Mores Cheesecake and Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  I love the graham cracker crust on the S'Mores Cheesecake.  Get both and have your stomach thank me later. Go early for lunch (~11AM/12PM) if you want to beat the lines , or early dinner time (~5PM/6PM) as this place gets packed.  Otherwise, call ahead for takeout is your best bet. One last note on customer service: I feel like Cheesecake Factory definitely puts an emphasis on this when they train their employees (sometimes you can just tell).  Over the several years I've been going to this location, I have never had a bad customer service experience - I also want to give a thank you to one cashier (I believe her name was Nicole), who comped us a cheesecake after my girlfriend and I noticed we were missing salad dressing in our takeout order."
Jhon Adrian D.,"Makiki - Lower Punchbowl - Tantalus, Honolulu, HI",15,5,10,5.0,10/21/2017,"A great place to enjoy great tasting food with family, friends, coworkers, or by yourself. The food was amazing, their steak tasted very good and was very tender and juicy. I loved their Calamari and salmon. I especially love their Tiramisu cheesecake along with their original signature cheesecake. The price range is very affordable, though there is no reservation so if you go you have to wait a min of 1hr and 30min to be seated just like EVERYONE else."
Karin H.,"Honolulu, HI",1,24,4,5.0,10/5/2017,"This place is my family's go to restaurant since when I was still a little girl. After few years it's still my go to place for something special day. I never had a bad experience here and employee here are always professional and even when I had to order something complicated my waitress always accept and kindly takes my orders ! Love this place, I wish this place had other location in honolulu ! Planning to visit soon again and again !"
Avian M.,"Honolulu, HI",147,84,135,2.0,10/2/2016,"Yesterday, the restaraunt is about opening, and the service JUST FOR WATER took so long. The sourdough bread was stale and chewy but the whole wheat baguette was way better.  I ordered a vegan Cobb Salad 4/5. The salad was just overwhelming. It's just toooo big like a dinner portion.  Overall, the flavors were good but could've been better. The Brussel sprout are just to strong, and maybe could've been more green than being so overwhelmed about finishing the plate.  On the other hand, my friend ordered something with pasta and a chunk of chicken.. holy crap. HE FOUND PIECES OF RAG MATERIALS IN HIS PASTA. not so satisfying to chew.  Cheesecake: well I mean, that's the best part, it was always good!!!   I hope the manager or owner see's my review because the FDA wouldn't approve of this."
Anthony N Mimi W.,"Seattle, WA",80,7,27,4.0,10/12/2017,"Our server was amazing she didn't just have great customer service but info in where we should go. Food was good as all cheesecake factory's, the burgers and the bread was great."
Jayleen C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",136,65,45,5.0,11/1/2016,"Went here for my birthday dinner. It was a Sunday night, so typical 40 min wait. Food:  -Garlic Noodles with chicken:  -chicken herb Parmesan  -Hazelnut crunch cheesecake Food was so delicious. Better than before. As what our waitress Cheryl told us, they changed their menu.  Waitress: Cheryl She was so awesome. She checked up on us constantly. We enjoyed the darker complimentary bread and when it was our second round we kindly asked just for the darker bread and she was kind enough to give us that. She was so patient with us. Will return and ask for her.  Quality:  Quality of the food was so good. About $17 per plate and and not gonna lie the portions were huge!  My chicken Parmesan plate came with 3 huge chicken breasts, with a side order of mashed and green beans. It was so good and I wanted to finish it at that moment. But with just one chicken breast, i was already full.  I do have to say, my boyfriend and I didn't enjoy the hazelnut crunch cheesecake. There was too much Nutella and couldn't taste their delicious cheesecake. But they have a good variety of cheesecakes to choose from and can't wait to try them all.  ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR CHERYL FOR GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. WILL BE BACK THANKS TO HER."
Ann C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,30,,1.0,9/20/2017,And 3 years later... I haven't been back... No comment from CF?  No contact?  Just let it slide?   Terrible...
Samantha H.,"Anchorage, AK",0,2,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Do not eat here if you have a food allergy. They will serve you food with the ingredient even if you ask them to remove it (and then charge you for the meal after they have to replace it, not to mention waiting for 2 meals).  I was really disappointed as I specifically sought to eat here and it was my last meal in Hawaii. Don't suggest eating here if you have a food allergy or as a final vacation meal - you'll be left with a lasting impression but not the one you want."
Alex B.,"Portland, OR",12,143,331,5.0,9/21/2016,"Alfredo with large scampi - OMG ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! 10/10! Make sure to get it with fresh parmesian, even if you don't like it like me. If you and another split this and a salad it would make for the perfect combo!  Super antioxidant salad - solid. The pear and blueberry add a freshness. But get the dressing on the side. Honestly, it detracts from the salad itself."
Anne P.,"Honolulu, HI",338,161,286,4.0,10/20/2016,"The only bad thing I have to say about this place is the wait time. Literally can reach up to a couple hours wait. Which i find ridiculous but welcome to Waikiki.  If you're a local or just wanna grab some food and go back to your hotel, call and order. You can go right to the pick up line and everything is wayyyyy quicker.  Whenever you get seated right away ask for a basket of bread!! Their bread is amazing!! I prefer the white one, it's a small touch of sour dough, but many people I've gone with have favored the brown bread. Which is also good.  I've had multiple dishes from here, but my all time go to is the Pasta Di Vinci. It's absolutely amazing especially with some Parmesan cheese to top it off.  I've never had bad service here, in the 7 years I've been coming to this location. I try to make it here at least once a year lol."
Gabby V.,"Honolulu, HI",205,93,125,3.0,4/21/2017,"It is crazy busy here so be ready to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour for a table. They definitely need to start taking reservations or come up with a better system for seating customers! Once we finally got seated, they tried to seat us outside in front of the restaurant. No offense but I don't want to be seated right next to people who are still waiting to get a table and have nothing better to do than to watch me eat. So we waited a few more minutes until a table near the kitchen was ready. We were seated under the air vents and they started to leak water! I'm pretty sure someone else complained because they quickly tried to wipe all the vents.  Service here is okay, nothing impeccable, but pretty standard for a restaurant food chain; you'll get your beverages refilled and fresh bread on the table so that's all I expected. Some of my favorite items on the menu is their Famous Factory Meatloaf, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and Factory Burrito Grande. My go-to cheesecakes are the Fresh Strawberry cheesecake and the Adam's Peanut Buttercup Fudge Ripple cheesecake. The place is pretty noisy so it can be hard to have a conversation. It's definitely a family restaurant, I can't see myself going on a date here."
