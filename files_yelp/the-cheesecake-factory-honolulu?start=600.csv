Kas M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,121,149,3.0,10/7/2015,"We ate here twice during our vacation in Hawaii. Once we ate for brunch/lunch and the other for dinner. The first time when we ate for brunch the place had very little patrons and we were seated immediately. Service of the food was a little slow, we ordered a dessert that took a while to come out. The second time was for dinner and there was literally an hour and a half wait time to be seated unfortunately. Once we were seated the food took a while to come out. For dessert I wanted the 30th anniversary chocolate/original cheesecake and the restaurant ran out, this was one of several cheesecakes they ran out of, smh. I was highly disappointed. But it's expected because this restaurant is in Wakiki, a heavily tourist area. Be prepared for a wait for dinner."
Ana B.,"Richmond, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/1/2015,Service was great! Our waiter was very friendly and outgoing but the food was just a NO NO!!  I ordered a turkey club sandwhich with avocado and the avocado was BAD! It literally was black!! My aunt ordered the imperial chicken with shrimp and their was not one single shrimp on that plate. The manager took the plates off our checks but I expected more out this restaurant! I wish I could remember the waiter's name he was awesome!
Lorilynn L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",150,241,139,4.0,10/13/2014,"I normally love the ccf experince, but the wait is ridiculous and the fact that they dont take reservations and the chaos it causes at the entrance. The fries were cold, the waiter and staff were friendly, but its not the atmosphrre for peace or quiet."
eric l.,"Honolulu, HI",67,30,13,3.0,8/27/2016,"gave three stars, since during peak hours this place is one big cluster fuck. everyone just standing around confused. hostess just standing behind the counter and not directing traffic, from the front door, on telling where people which way is which."
Danielle L.,"Kalihi, Honolulu, HI",17,62,62,3.0,2/1/2016,"Went here for the first time with my boyfriend this past Friday and we already were expecting a wait. Checked in and was told that there was going to be about a 40 minute wait, which was accurate. When our buzzer went off, we returned to the host stand and told the host our name. We were then asked to move to the right hand side of the host stand were we had to wait to get seated. We Moved over like 2 feet and waited with several other parties to get seated. I wouldn't mind waiting to get seated if the people who were suppose to be seating customers were attempting to get people seated. My boyfriend and I stood there for another 15 minutes, waiting to hear out name but rather witnessed, two males and three females having conversation about other things that were not related to getting customers seated ( I was standing close enough to hear personal conversation and information being exchanged). Once hearing our name being called, we proceeded to the back of the Resturant, walking about 1-2 miles an hour and not sure where we were heading. Very awkward experience...Thank goodness for our server Olivia Y!!! She made this whole experience 10x better. Not only was she quick with the waters, bread and awesome and giving suggestions ( Fried Mac and Cheese and Salted Caramel Cheesecake) but she made us feel right at home. My boyfriend agreed that if it was not for our server, we would not be returning to this establishment or recommend it to others."
Sarah J.,"Bridgehampton, NY",17,36,115,2.0,4/23/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is an overrated tourist restaurant. Sure the food is delicious but it's not that amazing that you have to wait an hour and a half just to sit down. The only thing I am extremely impressed with is their honey oat bread and their selection of cheesecake. You don't really need an entree with their bottomless bread basket and the size of their appetizers. But they have a large selection of entrees so it appeals more to the picky eater. Also their entrees are good, being from New York its hard to find pizza out here that I actually will order again. Their portions are large so it's almost worth the price. Except for the cocktails, they're small and really not worth it. Just order water like a normal person and go have happy hour at a bar.  My suggestions:  Appetizers: -Avocado Egg Rolls -Fried Macaroni and Cheese (Personal Favorite) -Spinach and Cheese Dip -Caesar Salad Entrees:  -Tomato, Basil and Cheese Pizza  -Cheese Pizza  -Americana Hamburger (Okay I don't actually eat meat, but I've never heard complaints) Cheesecake: - Godiva Cheesecake (The reason why I don't order any other cheesecakes) -Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake -Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake"
Holly C.,"Honolulu, HI",1,11,2,4.0,5/13/2015,"Thank goodness there is a Cheesecake Factory here in Hawaii. Consistently great food. It's a great place for a group meeting since the menu has so many variety that there is sure something to please everyone.  Pros:   Great variety of good foods  Large portions at reasonable prices  The cheesecake of course! Cons:  The wait can be really long especially for dinner  The services are a hit and miss depending on waiter Foods:  Sliders: greasy buttered buns  Chicken Marsala: huge portion ...meh  Burgers: simple burger, great fries  Renee special: good soup and sandwich Why the four stars? Saw a huge outdoor cockroach landed on the table once and inform the waitress and she just ignore us. Otherwise, consistent good foods"
Emili H.,"South Pasadena, CA",26,49,8,5.0,2/23/2016,"Best place for dinner 100% And my second question why? For sure Cheesecake Factory one of the best places in general, but I didn't know it's gonna be a best dinner place in Honolulu. Feeling so sad for Honolulu, and proud for Cheesecake Factory!"
Jay Jay C.,"Las Vegas, NV",266,38,74,4.0,2/15/2015,"This place is pretty awesome and for the most part customer service is on point. The parking situation is not bad at all which I love its the cheapest place to park if you go to waikiki and they are always so busy that even if you don't go to eat there they are so busy they won't even realise you didn't eat there and bam super cheap parking. The food is pretty good but I think its either pre-prepared, or comes frozen. One time we ordered food and they brought out the food and it was super cold. Awesome customer service they immediately fixed it and brought us out some hot food, they didn't charge us for that plate and didn't charge us for our cheesecake. The only thing I hate from this place is that they don't take reservations, and the line is usually crazy long!"
Jennifer J.,"Honolulu, HI",3,66,126,3.0,10/23/2013,"This place always has a very long line outside. We waited to be seated. After they took our buzzer, we waited for 15 more mins because the host weren't attending to us. After we asked what's the reason for the hold up, they said they had us wait because they are trying to find a bilingual host. And then they asked ""Do you prefer Chinese, Japanese or Korean?"". Just because we are Oriental doesn't mean we can't speak English! We told them we wanted an American server, so we got seated already. The server was nice, very happy and energetic. We ordered our dish then she brought out our drinks and the bread. I guess it's because that the place is crowded and packed with customers that our food took a very long time to be served.  The food were good the portions were big. The Hibachi Steak is only a few slices of steak though. I love the Fried Mac and Cheese!  I guess we shouldn't have ordered too much because we didn't have room for desserts.  It took longer for us to wait to be seated and wait for our food to come out than the time it took us to eat."
Sandra T.,"Vancouver, Canada",491,221,344,4.0,10/16/2014,"Always a fan of Cheesecake Factory. When we visited Honolulu, our condo rental was around the Waikiki area so we did a lot of walking up and down Kalakaua.  There was never a time where it wasn't busy at Cheesecake Factory!  There's this circular water fountain thingy just outside of CF and it was always shoulder to shoulder of peeps sitting and waiting patiently for their buzzer to go off! It was the middle of the afternoon and my husband and I wanted to sit down somewhere to grab a bite.  You can never go wrong with CF so we put our name down.  The wait wasn't too long - about 20 minutes or so.  We were given a pager for when our table was ready.  The good part is CF is smack in the middle of the shopping area so you can go inside the neighboring stores while your partner (haha) waits outside so you're still within the radio frequency! We decided to order just one kalua pig pizza as again, we weren't really hungry and just wanted to rest.  We decided on this pizza because we hadn't seen it on any other CF menu we've eaten at and was the most 'hawaiian' one there - except for the obvious Hawaiian pizza of course, but you can get that anywhere. The pizza was a perfect small-ish size for us!  I love any slow roasted pork on anything.  This one was nicely salted with red onions and little pieces of sweet mango!  Nice addition.  Would definitely recommend this pizza to others. Service is always good and consistent all across all CF's i've been to. One star decreased because they don't take resos... but considering how busy they are, business-wise they don't need to."
Robert L.,"Monterey Park, CA",16,32,,1.0,7/27/2014,"Go here only if you have 4 hours to burn.  Seated right away, 45 minute for bread, another 15 minutes we asked if the food was coming.  The obese waitress said when she has time she will check.  She went and cleaned off some tables.  We saw her again and asked if it normally takes that long for the food to come out and with an attitude she rolled her eyes and said- yes it takes 20 minutes to cook.  We explained to her that it's been over an hour.  We left.   The food was probably cooked a long time ago and she sneaked into the kitchen and ate it all."
Jennifer G.,"Fort Lewis, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",145,222,15,3.0,7/14/2013,"We came here for a going away last weekend. The food is good. I love the bread they give as an appetizer. I had some type of chicken that was good. Then a lava flow to drink and if course cheesecake.  Our group of 6, bought 4 slices and shared them all. The caramel macadamia nut was my favorite! The lime one was a little too tart. Red velvet and coffee cheesecakes were good too.  Well we wanted to pay separate but they couldn't separate the bill. What food chain can't sit the bill or items? That was frustrating. It was also expensive, my bill just for me was over $50....and I didn't even have a steak....."
Sara A.,"Pāhoa, HI",96,43,176,4.0,6/29/2013,"Cheesecake is a MUST when eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm pretty sure any cheesecake you try will taste equally sinful and deliciously yummy.  I tried the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake the last time I went and it was the bomb.  It didn't matter that I felt like I gained a pound with every bite..the taste was delectable!  It tasted like a combination of chocolate, nuts, toffee (?), and...coconut.  Bottom line: super ono.   The main course dishes are pretty flavorful too.  I enjoyed the orange chicken (could actually taste the orange flavor) and roasted vegetable pizza (winners!)."
Tehani N.,"Mililani, HI",1,4,12,4.0,3/28/2015,I always love comin fb here just so I can eat the crispy crab wonton and the cheesecakes! I love the chocolate Godiva cheesecake it's the bomb!!
Shanell B.,"Waipahu, HI",0,1,1,5.0,3/23/2015,The Cheesecake Factory...yes the wait is long and yes everyone complains about it. But what do you expect it's in the heart of Waikiki! But you know what...the great service and the good food makes up for it. Thank you Jessica P. for being an awesome server! She made us feel so welcomed and very comfortable by her humorous personality! If I owned a restaurant I would definitely hire Jessica because she knows how to take care of her customers!
Monamarie A.,"Waipahu, HI",41,10,7,5.0,3/22/2015,5 star cheesecake for sure!!! Ate here once and thought the food and service was 3 stars. Extremely crowded for dinner and expect to wait at least an hour on weekends. Much better to go for lunch or early dinner. We were a party of 2 and ordered simple dishes with no special requests aside from requesting the Ceasar Salad with my lunch pizza. The waitress did not write down our order but repeated it back to us before she put it in. Food came out before my drink which was forgotten and ended up with the house salad instead of the Ceasar. Was a little disappointed but will continue returning just to grab a slice of cheesecake.
Jenna S.,"Honolulu, HI",60,191,527,4.0,11/3/2013,"What can I say, I love this place. Yummy food, affordable, and good location for Waikiki. The Herb Crusted Salmon and Steak Dianne Combo is so good! The only negatives are it's super busy during dinner and NOISY! I suggest coming for luch or right before dinner to avoid a wait, also try and sit outside or in the very back, it's better lit and somewhat quieter. Park at Royal Hawaiian shopping center and get validation, 1st hour is free then only $1 every hour after that."
Grace R.,"Honolulu, HI",61,9,4,3.0,3/25/2016,I was at this place a week ago for lunch. We had a nice table close to the patio. Our server was ok but not the best. We ordered appetizer before our entree and when our main course came she took our Bread and butter plate without asking and my knife was taken as well. I didn't say anything but I guess she noticed that I looked surprised so she offered to give it back to me after she already took the dirty one and she ask if I wanted a new knife and of course since she already mixed it with the dirty dishes she took away from us. The butter never was given to us after she agreed. We ordered coffee and she just slammed the coffee in front of us.. We still tipped her but she is clumsy server. Good food and we enjoyed
Randall S.,"Kaneohe, HI",19,198,63,4.0,9/3/2015,"I admit it...I'm a closet cheesecake addict and for years tend to grade restaurants on how good their cheesecake is.  But to go to a restaurant actually named after my favorite dessert???  I must've died and gone to Heaven!  What's even better is this is a chain!  So I've been to The Cheesecake Factory Restaurants in Seattle and LA but Hawaii's is the best!  (Not to mention the World's Busiest Cheesecake Factory.)  Okay, so what's the bad news?  First, they don't take reservations so it's first come, first serve so you could end up waiting 1- 2 hours before getting seated and it's in Waikiki where parking is a bear.  The good news is they have kick-butt cheesecake!  Oops, need to get back on track...  Situated in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, you can park in their parking structure so bad news #2 is no longer a problem.  As for the seating, try to go for an early dinner or perhaps lunch when the crowds aren't too bad.  Weekdays are better than weekends for getting tables.  The larger your party is (i.e. more than 4 people), the better an idea it is to go off-schedule.  But once you're seated, be prepared to have your brain explode!  They have an extensive menu offering food for all palates from the simple (burgers on a bun) to more sophisticated dishes (fresh catch of the day like opakapaka).  So it's not possible to not have something that someone doesn't want.  The fresh bread appetizers is a nice thing to munch on while waiting for your food.  Once it comes, I hope you're hungry because these folks provide industrial size servings.  It's a major accomplishment if you can eat all your food without having to take home the leftovers.  But you may want to do that.  Why?  Because you'll have no space for the 5 billion different cheesecake dishes they offer!  Just like their meals, they have peanut butter flavored cheesecake to chocolate cheesecake to just regular cheesecake.  They've taken the humble cheesecake to a whole new level.  Fortunately all is not lost and if you don't have any space, you can always order the cheesecake to be packed to take home.  The servers are always excellent and food and used dishes appear and disappear like magic.  It's not easy to get to the restaurant but I promise is well worth the effort.  Bon Appetit!"
