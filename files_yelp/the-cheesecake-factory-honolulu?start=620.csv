Cristina G.,"Kirkland, WA",461,155,8,5.0,1/20/2016,"Despite eating at several extremely expensive fine dining restaraunts (joe's in Haleiva and 53 by the Sea), this was the BEST FOOD I had in Honolulu and a relative bargain. LOVED the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and even came home and searched for the recipe online. Sat at the bar and service was average but it was nice to be able to watch my favorite show with captions, ""Shark Tank"". Might have also enjoyed people watching at the outside walkway tables. Ironically, this isnt a restaurant I normally think of going to in any other cities and went only because of the other yelp reviews  . Because of the great food at this location, I may try it in my home city."
John N.,"Honolulu, HI",313,466,96,3.0,1/12/2013,"Pros: -Every single dish I've tried here are quite tasty. Some dishes have great portions and others are quite small. -Service. One of the best service you can get in a restaurant in Waikiki. These guys here at pros and work their butts off every day. Cons: - Takes way too long to get your food. The problem stems is that this restaurant is very packed and the kitchen does look a lil smaller than what you expect for a restaurant this size. - Price. Jesus H Christ it is expensive here. You will break your wallet if you eat here often. - With the name Cheesecake Factory, you figure their Cheesecake is good. Wrong. The cheesecake tastes old and not fresh and it is VERY expensive too. I don't expect much to change on this restaurant as they are always packed with tourists. There are definitely much better spots to spend your hard earned money here. 100 Reviews, 1 Day 31/100 January 12, 2012"
Jill M.,"Honolulu, HI",1,15,2,3.0,3/20/2016,"Enormous portions, and the food is great. Noisy. Waiting to get a table is crazy crazy crazy."
Steven B.,"Orlando, FL",4407,1179,825,4.0,12/13/2012,So how crazy busy is this Cheesecake Factory you ask? Here are some hints -  * It's steps away from Waikiki beach.  * It's open normal hours and busier than the Las Vegas location which is open 24/7. * It's the highest grossing location in the chain. A bartender told me 26M in 2012!  That's right; 26 million from one location!  * At peak times the waits are two hours plus. The crowds are so huge you'd think a superstar was about to arrive.  So would I wait two hours for a meal? Absolutely not but that doesn't mean I don't love these folks. I've never had a bad meal here. The menu is ginormous and the variety will satisfy everyone. The prices are commensurate with the quality and huge portions. The adult libations are strong and the waitstaff is competent. This chain does it right.  So go at an off peak time and be prepared to enjoy yourself!
Misty C.,"Waianae, HI",22,18,155,5.0,3/17/2016,"Great customer service. Waitress was very attentive and personable. All sorts of cheesecakes and menu items as well. Kids menu is a plus, good value. Glad we finally got to visit the cheesecake factory."
Mei-Lan C.,"Honolulu, HI",214,306,1504,4.0,3/3/2013,"oh my god , why is the wait here always sooooo long   ?   :(  came here to try more items from  their  lunch menu . this time we got the lunch pizza and salad 13.50 $ and the herb crusted filet of salmon 13.95 $. the salmon came with asparagus and rice . ( got fries instead of rice ) somehow it wasn't what i was looking for .salmon was very soft , kind of like it was blanched in water or broth , not grilled or pan fried. very weak on the seasoning. fries were good though. my hubby had better luck , he loved his pizza and caesar  salad. portions are really big   3 stars for the salmon and 4 stars for pizza and salad ."
Kelsi-Ann M.,"Mililani, HI",308,19,18,2.0,1/24/2016,"Normally I am quite pleased with my experience at the Cheesecake Factory but today was just horrible. I ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano, my go to item on the menu, but today it completely flopped. My food was room temperature when I got it and the pasta noodles were hard and sticking together. I ordered coffee at the end of the meal and coffee was cold! Not even warm. Also, the waiter did not refill our water at all during our entire meal. NOT WORTH THE OVER AN HOUR WAIT!!"
Issa H.,"Hilo, HI",117,28,24,3.0,2/27/2015,"I've been there maybe 5 times, it's pretty okay food, the atmosphere is fun.  I don't love the cheesecake,  wish it was less sweet and more traditional.    But when you have a group it's great if you can get a seat.  More about the location and marketing."
preston c.,"Honolulu, HI",2,9,,1.0,7/29/2014,Poor service. Really have to wait over 30 minutes for a half filled restaurant? Management does not know how to staff. Food is salty and oily. This is not a good representation of American food for all the international tourists that visit the islands.
Rachel Y.,"Orchard, Singapore, Singapore",21,23,,4.0,7/15/2014,"I wish I wasn't so hungry when I came into this location, If I wasn't I would have took some pictures but I eat everything too fast!  I order the beat and goat cheese salad, it was so fresh and tasty after a long day on a charter boat fishing with some friends.  Then for my actual meal I order the chicken medera. It is a creamy oven baked chicken with a white sauce that is sprinkled with garlic, lemon and butter.  So so GOOD  And then dessert. No dinner is complete without dessert.  Banana Cream Cheesecake  Oh my wow oh wow...  I wish I would have taken a photo, it really would have lasted longer!"
Twan B.,"Herten, The Netherlands",10,21,41,5.0,10/24/2014,"We had a delicious meal, had to wait for almost 45 mins, but had a few deinks at the bar until we could be seated.  Our waiter was funny and very helpful. He even suggeated to share the spaghetti, to leave room for the aweaome cheesecake.  This place is a must to visit!"
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",376,724,4176,5.0,11/22/2010,"I wanted to write a brief update about my recent visit for Sunday brunch: Sunday brunch is served from 10am to 2pm, and consists of 13 items with the 13th item being a ""kids"" brunch sized portion.  Sunday brunch items include pancakes, waffles, eggs benedict, and steak and eggs.  I went with a friend, and after looking over their menu I decided to order the Baja Chicken Hash, while my friend decided to order the Crab Hash. Both of these dishes come with your choice of tomatoes or potatoes, as well as white toast, wheat toast, or a plain bagel.  Please see  for the full Sunday Brunch menu, as well as their complete menu offerings. NOTE:  The plain bagel comes with cream cheese, while the toast comes with strawberry jam. For the 2 dishes that we ordered, I thought the price we paid was very reasonable for the portion sizes.  I was so tempted to finish my entire dish, but were it not for the fact that I wanted to save room for dessert I most likely would have devoured all of my food!  Seriously, no visit to Cheesecake Factory would be complete without dessert!!  My friend decided to order the red velvet cheesecake, while I choose the 30th Anniversary chocolate cheescake.  Now let me just say this chocolate cheesecake, a hybrid of their original cheesecake and fudge cake, was simply delicious!  Your taste buds will be doing the happy dance for hours on end.  Amazingly, I finished nearly the entire piece of cheesecake.   SERVICE:  The service on this visit was phenomenal!  The server was just so friendly, outgoing, polite, helpful, and the list goes on and on.  Exceptional service indeed. Bottom Line:  Take advantage of this once a week food spectacular!"
Rey L.,"El Segundo, CA",120,851,1991,4.0,3/1/2011,"You know how sometimes when you're on vacation and you've eaten at all the new places and local places and different places and suddenly, you just get homesick for familiar places. Enter Cheesecake. This place is HUGE! We brought the big stroller so the host was trying to maneuver us around to best seat our carriage. He pretty much gave us a tour of this place and it is BIG. It's very deceiving from the outside the enormity of the place. The place was packed too. We got a pager to hold on to while waiting. Probably also because it was President's weekend. Not too long for the wait. About 15mins. Just enough time to keep Mama from shopping on the strip.  We both ordered our usuals that we get from our local Cheesecake. (Ironically, I haven't even reviewed that one) Mama had the luau salad. She actually gets that back on the mainland! Haha! I got the crispy spicy beef. YUM.. effing MY!!! Overall, we were home again...  Our server was awesome and the atmosphere was great. We'll definitely come back when we have a hankering for homesick food. Well, maybe we'll go to Denny's next time. :)"
David G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,,3.0,9/4/2016,This place is always on the list of possibilities whenever we visit Waikiki. Food is good and service has always been great. It seems to be well run considering how big and busy they are. I usually get the Chicken Madeira which I've been told is their most popular menu item. If I do have cheesecake I share one slice with one or two others because it's very rich and filling. Be prepared to wait for a table during prime dinner or lunch time.
G.m.s M.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,5,,2.0,8/14/2016,"Overpriced food, ridiculously long lines especially for dinner (2 hours, are you kidding me!!). Soup arrived cold, burrito was edible but thats it, much much better food and service at PF Changs just around the corner."
William B.,"Hanahan, SC",0,6,1,2.0,4/27/2015,Kids macaroni and cheese had burnt char in it from either the cream sauce burning or dirty oven or pan. Failed at basics! Overweight waiter who did not want to be there and leaned on everything. Huge tourist trap if it was in town would fail.
Mel M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",10,133,57,4.0,8/11/2013,"My wife and I have been here many times, with the latest being today for lunch with my mom. We've always expected a long line/wait so we just factor that in...also need to be aware that you wait with a pager...then after your pager buzzes, you wait to be seated. One thing to keep in mind,  however, is you can go to the bar and get seated if there are seats available. I've done that before and their bar offers full service. For lunch today,  my mom ordered the Renee's Special (One-Half of a Fresh Turkey or Chicken Salad Sandwich, a Cup of Our Soup and a Small Green Salad) and she raved about the chicken and artichoke soup. The wife had the Navajo Sandwich which she always loves and I tried the Chicken Picatta. We all loved our meals and saved some room for cheesecake and coffee, of course. Why, it would be like going to a steakhouse and ordering tofu or something if we didn't get some cheesecake. All in all, food cost us just over $54 less tip."
John O.,"Manhattan, NY",0,42,28,4.0,3/4/2016,Big restaurant and always packed. Long waits and no call ahead or reservations. Good food.
Keila N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5000,2051,11264,3.0,8/11/2014,"My daughter and I visited the Cheesecake Factory on a Friday evening.  Service was a bit spotty, but the food was consistent with other locations. I didn't really care for Steak Dianne.  The shrimp was good.  My daughter had a pizza."
Rose T.,"Honolulu, HI",4,5,8,5.0,1/8/2016,"Went Christmas shopping on Christmas Eve in Waikiki with the bf & decided to finally eat at Cheesecake Factory for brunch. Dined in a few minutes after they opened, which is probably the best time considering that after maybe 10-20 minutes, the place got packed! It took awhile for my bf & I to decide what to eat because it was hard to pick from the many different choices on their menu. But while we needed more time, our waiter offered us some bread & butter. We finally made our orders, I got the combo of the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi with mashed potatoes, my bf got the hamburger steak dinner portion & we also ordered the deep fried mac & cheese & fried calamari. Once our food came in soon after, we realized we got too much food. The portions here are huuuuuge! The fried calamari was yummy, which came with 2 sauces a garlic mayo & a marinara sauce. The fried Mac & cheese was very cheesy. My combo plate was so full of flavor but the hamburger steak wasn't anything special though. We didn't end up finishing our plates so we got take out for our left overs.  Besides the many entree choices, there are also many cheesecake choices! For dessert we ordered the white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake & an original cheesecake with fresh strawberries. I didn't like the white chocolate caramel macadamia, I love sweets but this was just too sweet for me. So the original with strawberries was the best one.  Overall, our first dine in here was great, especially since we didn't come during peak hours of long lines & long waits."
