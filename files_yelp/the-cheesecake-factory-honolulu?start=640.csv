Daniel N.,"Aiea, HI",46,89,144,5.0,12/1/2014,This place is great. The menu is diverse and the food tastes great. The interior is very clean and the staff is friendly. The cheesecake selection is amazing. They even have a low-carb cheesecake that is soo good!! It gets crowded during lunch and dinner. Go early!! Especially on the weekends!!
Adrienne D.,"Kahului, HI",29,20,11,4.0,11/30/2014,"Have been to Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas and in Portland. This was my first time to the one in Waikiki. That being said, the atmosphere is the same at the others. However, it was CRAZY busy! Even more than the one in LV. Luckily, we went on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, so we actually got seated right away. There wasn't an  empty table in the place. These guys turn the seating a over great speed. The server was very good.  After going over the menu several times, it's 17-20 pages long. I ordered the ""skinnylisious"" salad/w chicken. My husband ordered the factory burger. My salad could've fed 3 or 4 people. My only gripe is there was hardly any chicken in it! For $19 I would at least expect 4-6oz of it. That kind of bummed me out. I've had this salad at other locations and it was generous.  Couldn't eat all greens, I dug through it thinking there was chicken in the bottom. ZERO! Oh well.  My hubby's burger was good but he gave it a 7 out of 10. He's a burger lover. Says his fav is Five Guys (you can adjust your scale from there).  We ordered the Lemon meringue cheesecake. We only had a couple bites cause we were kinda full and got the rest to go. OMG Yes, it was beyond yummy! THIS IS WHY ITS CALLED CHEESECAKE FACTOR! It was still yummy when we ate they rest later.  In summary, go early order what looks good, SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!"
Chris K.,"Columbus, GA",18,40,37,5.0,12/14/2014,"it was a lot better than what I expected for an American chain.   it was 40 minute wait but this allowed me time to walk down to urban outfitters and Honolulu cookie company for some shopping. we were seated promptly after our arrival (20 minutes earlier than originally estimated).  the server was attentive and quick with ordering and boxing left overs and ringing the check. also, very nice, no attitude or anything negative (what is what I prepared myself for after a trip to hard rock) the food was a little expensive but reasonable. it tasted a lot better than what I expected. I've had bad lava flows and island ice teas, where the bitter alcohol overtakes the sweetest of the drink, but these drinks were a great balance! also the Godiva cheesecake was to die for. I suggest sharing a piece with a friend, they're dangerously delicious!"
Micah F.,"Portage, IN",0,1,,2.0,3/12/2016,"The only pro is that the food always taste good. I ate here three times in one week while on vacation. The wait time is always long, the service once seated isn't very good, the waitress didn't  ever serve us our appetizer one time, and another time the appetizer was served with our meal not before. One of the times our buzzer went off to be seated and we came to the front desk in which they told us to wait near by, then 3 other groups were told the same thing after us and then got seated before us while we waited another 15 minutes because they forgot about us. One of the times we were never offered Parmesan for our pasta, and the portions were significantly smaller on one of the dishes in which we had gotten two other times that week."
Kapua R.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,3,1,5.0,3/3/2015,"Can I start off my saying WOW!! Me&& myhusband were walking around in waikiki and came across the delicious Cheesecake Factory. We walked in and the wait was less than 5mins which was awesome. They were even kind enough to switch our table to a booth :) our waitress was on-point, super friendly and very helpful. My husband got the the club sandwich with a salad and I got the cheesesteak with fries. Everything was hot and well worth it. But the BEST PART of all was our CHEESECAKE!! I got a double Oreo cheesecake and he got a white caramel macadamia nut one.  AMAZEBALLS thank you Ashley for the wonderful service. We will definitely be back. Oh &&scant forget about the delicious bread and the hot spinach dip for your appetizer. LOVED IT"
Joseph Joel B.,"Mililani, HI",1978,63,1427,4.0,7/27/2014,"IF YOU LOVE CHEESECAKE, YOU NEED TO COME HERE!! Even if you don't love cheesecake, you still need to come here!! =) First of all, The Cheesecake Factory is located along the infamous Waikiki Strip on Kalakaua Avenue in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. Parking is free in the shopping center as long as you get your ticket validated at the reception desk. For those of you who have never eaten at a Cheesecake Factory, there is more to this restaurant than just cheesecake... SO MUCH MORE!! Their huge menu is one of the largest I have seen for any given restaurant, which makes it both a blessing and a curse... I certainly love their wide variety of selections, but it also makes it very difficult to choose!! And don't expect to get seated right away at this Waikiki location... It is almost always extremely busy, and you would be considered really lucky if your wait is less than 30 minutes. Probably the best times to go are weekdays during lunch. Dinners and weekends are definitely the busiest. But being that busy just shows you that there's something good in store for you inside. Like I said earlier, the menu is FRICKEN HUGE!! So determining what to actually eat might take awhile. But whatever you decide to order, I can guarantee you that it will be a hearty portion!! I almost always have a problem with not finishing my food, and that's not even counting the dessert!! I have eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory at least a dozen times, and normally I get my usuals... Crispy Crab Wontons and the Miso Salmon... Both, in my opinion, are exceptional dishes and I have never been disappointed by ordering them at this restaurant or any Cheesecake Factory restaurant for that matter!! I haven't really tried anything else, except occasionally tasting some of my friends dishes, but anything you order is pretty much going to be good and have good portions. And finally, THE DESSERT!! I absolutely love cheesecake and always have a problem choosing one from their three dozen selections they have on hand... AND THAT'S JUST THE CHEESECAKE!! For you non-cheesecake lovers, they also have different cakes and ice creams to choose from. I'm normally too stuffed by the end of my regular meal, so I get dessert to go. So if you're willing to wait to be seated, The Cheescake Factory really does have something for everybody, and not just cheesecake!! =)"
Faye M.,"Honolulu, HI",259,697,310,4.0,7/7/2011,"I once decided to have my birthday dinner here and knew the wait would be long - especially with 20 people...so I planned accordingly: told my friends that dinner is at 8, and since the wait would be long - we will all meet there at 6. If I had to wait, so did everyone else! It was MY BIRTHDAY, after all! It all worked out well and I had no regrets!  Anyway, I love coming here for any meal, but I hardly every have room for dessert :( But I don't really care for cheesecake anyway - I usually get the carrot cake! It's soo huge and delicious - the last time, it lasted me 4 days!  I really like their Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Sandwich - I saw it featured on the Oprah show as Chris Rock's favorite sandwich a loooong time ago and have been eating it ever since! It's clubhouse sandwich style - so there's that 3rd slice of bread in the middle, but guess what! You can ask to have it without that slice...it makes it slightly smaller and less messier. A waiter asked me if I wanted it like that way a few years back, and that's the only way I eat it now! With Sweet Potato Fries...so good, you don't even need ketchup!  Best time to go is lunch and early, early dinner! Or, you can try to bypass the wait and grab a high top in the bar area - those are open for anyone!"
Nicole A.,"Mililani, HI",2042,103,1402,4.0,10/4/2012,"Pros: The food is excellent here. Menu items are a little pricey but the portions are plentiful and very delicious! Love the layout of the restaurant, with an open seat area overlooking the Waikiki streets. Once seated, the service is normally quick and the servers are very friendly.  Cons:  1- Wait time: If u want to eat here, come early (when they first open for lunch time and early evening for dinner time). Do not come during the busy hours unless you're willing to wait sometimes up to an hour and a half. Yes, I'm serious. We showed up once during dinner time and was told the wait was that long. No, we didn't wait. It was already 8:00 pm, and with a little one, we needed to hurry and head back to the hotel to put him to bed.  2- Parking: No private parking. This is in the heart of Waikiki! What do you expect!  You have to park in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center parking structure and walk through the mall to the opposite end. It's not a very far walk, but nonetheless, it's a walk.  In a nutshell, if u love CF, the pros will far outweigh the cons!"
Erika C.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",1,8,59,4.0,2/22/2015,"My husband and I went there during lunch hours .  First of all the restaurant is clean, beautiful and no wait time..  The waiter was very attentive making sure our drinks were all fill and did not get pas half way..  Brought us additional white napkins .. We had hot wings , special number 17  chicken pasta top with basil pasta  and my husband had the club sandwich .   The amount of food they give is well worth the money ..  We had to get to go boxes  ...   For desert we had a chocolate cheese cake . It made my mouth water delicious ..  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends"
Kala A.,"Chewelah, WA",0,9,,5.0,2/22/2016,Went at not a very busy time and didn't have to wait at all to be seated the service was good and our food was delicious and HUGE
Cesar D.,"Honolulu, HI",19,4,,3.0,12/19/2015,"Long story short. Celebrated my wife's birthday here for lunch. We waited approx. 5 mins. Food is good! Huge serving size! Waiter was on it, got our orders right away. Got to choose what type of cheesecake she wanted. Employees sang to her and in the end we ended up paying for what I thought was a complimentary cheesecake on your birthday."
Jaymie M.,"Honolulu, HI",7,7,,3.0,8/24/2016,"If you don't like waiting then be prepared because the wait is looong. I mean, obviously it's going to be busy especially after 6. But my boyfriend and I finally got seated after almost a hour. The waiter wasn't special. When he took our orders he seemed nice to me, but to my boyfriend he was kind of lackluster and rude. Wait for the food was long as well. Had the Calamari and it was very delicious. For entree, i had the Shrimp Scampi (YUM) and my boyfriend had the Steak Diane which he enjoyed. Asked for the check took about 5 minutes for it to get to us then almost 20 minutes for them to bring it back. Not sure what is up with the place and making you wait, but it was an OK experience."
Denise H.,"Orange County, CA",1261,954,7129,4.0,1/20/2013,"I always prefer to eat at mom n pop eateries but there's something about cheesecake factory that I like. Their menu is extensive(!) so I can't say that I've tried most things. BUT the things that I have tried, I've liked.  I love their strawberry lemonade. I dig their avocado egg rolls. The firecracker salmon app is yummy. Fried mac n cheese balls are also great. Their meatloaf tastes just like mama made it.  The chicken madiera has never let me down. The bistro shrimp pasta, strangely, tastes better on the mainland.  Their salads are ginormous. And I love, love, love their dulce de leche cheesecake.  Service is friendly. However, I wouldn't wait over 90 minutes to eat here. It's too bad the cheesecake factory is located in waikiki. All the tourists flood this joint. If you're lucky, it's self seating at the bar and you can order off the dining room menu."
Viet N.,"Seattle, WA",435,23,35,3.0,12/16/2014,"Food is pretty good for the price although I believe that the novelty of the Cheesecake Factory is its popularity and its location on Waikiki. I made the mistake of sharing both fries, chicken nachos, and tortilla soup with only another person since the food is in huge portions. Make sure to get the nachos if you are  hungry because its a lot of food! Location is pretty great, more towards the shopping district than the water. Outside seating is really cool and gives you a great view of tourists and the street, albeit it might take you a little bit longer since the demand is higher. Overall, a pretty fun place to eat that everyone should experience especially if you are coming to Honolulu for the first time."
Dabushman D.,"Honolulu, HI",5,37,5,5.0,6/5/2014,"Here we go again. The voices in my head are conflicted in what to say. (Welcome to my world.)  Yes, like many of the previous reviews I had been to numerous Cheesecake Factory outlets . ( Redondo Beach;Pasadena ;Beverly Hills)   It is however unfair to make comparisons , you see this is Hawaii where you should leave your expectations at the airport counter and just have a good time and enjoy where you are ,paradise it's not too hard .. I have been doing it for 10 years  That's how long we have been coming here. ( some voices have come and gone but,needless to say they are still multiple) Yes, there will be a wait,after all this is the busiest restaurant in ALL of Hawaii . Stop whining about it . It's either you want to be here or you don't . Stop complaining about the wait,come when they open the wait will be minimal.(see how easy the remedy to your conundrum was.) There's got to be more to your lives than to leave miserable & frankly mean spirited reviews for this place,consider this facts. Over 100+ employees at a given shift ; 2000+ meals a day served those are staggering numbers for any restaurant operations . Yet , selfish as we all are we want perfection , our excuse is that we are customers & we are paying for it .... That's not an excuse to be rude & belligerent to other humans. Yes, that was you we are talking about. So let it go already .  Here's the scoop . We have had excellent service to mediocre service. We have had superb food to meh food. But , we keep coming back !!! Why you may ask? We think the Cheesecake Factory is just like us ... With multiple personalities .  There will be good days and they will be bad days. It does not matter what Rx you have been ingesting...in the end it will always be that....multiple personalities. Just accept it . As they say acceptance is the hardest pill  to swallow . ALOHA"
Katy D.,"Palo Alto, CA",469,93,224,5.0,10/23/2014,I LOVE cheesecake factory. Try to request a seat outside by the torches and right outside the Kalakaua Avenue! I love this location and the food is always WONDERFUL!
Nanea L.,"Kapolei, HI",837,488,1292,4.0,6/5/2011,"This place is pretty on POINT* located in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center right next to Forever21. But just expect a fkn long ass wait! It's ALWAYS HELLA PACKED* You go up to the hostess stand, they put you down on the wait list, pass you a pager&WAH-LA you're on your way to an experience at ""The Cheesecake Factory""...love their bread that they give only the wheat though, its BOMB! The waiter/waitress sits yall down after the buzzin of the beaper goes down&recites the specials. The menu is intense so be prepared! *If you bring your own wine you don't have to order any from them&they'll just pop&serve it to you for like a $10 fee. Which is maikai! ;D The food is always top notch&for a busy ass place the food comes out promptly! always gooood so yup worth the wait. try this place out:)"
Tiffany C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,,5.0,2/15/2016,"Phenomenal!! Amazing food, consistent and great customer service. The wait times are horrible because it is the only one on island. I wish you would open one in Hawaii Kai."
Kaitlyn F.,"Portland, OR",307,193,67,3.0,4/4/2013,"Not sure why this place is ALWAYS so crowded. Like how does it get the hype? The lines are ridiculously long. The food is decent, but overpriced. The redeeming factor is definitely the complimentary bread. SO WARM, CRISPY, AND DELICIOUS! I just can't stop eating it.  The Oreo Dream Cheesecake is also to die for. Those two factors get this place three stars."
Mark W.,"Menifee, CA",0,36,3,4.0,1/23/2016,"I travel to Hawaii on business quite a bit. My wife and I decided to try a chain restaurant on our last visit. The wait to be seated was a bit long, but the service and food more than made up for it. The appetizers were amazing and our dinner was fantastic! The atmosphere was very comfortable and casual. Definitely worth a visit if you're in town. We will certainly eat there again!"
