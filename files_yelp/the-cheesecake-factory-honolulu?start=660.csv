Jou L.,"Honolulu, HI",156,64,2,1.0,3/6/2016,"Had a gift certificate to eat at this restaurant. When we entered the restaurant the host immediately took us to a table near the bar.  Since the table was not set, he asked us to wait but being that we were blocking the aisle decided to sit down at the table to get out of the way. Out of nowhere two servers approach the table and the female server tells us ""this is not first come first serve"" as they thought we had just walked in and sat down. I told her that the host had seated us there. The male server then said ""if you each give me $10.00 you can sit here"". Already taken aback by the female server, I told them again ""the host sat us here!"". He then told me he was joking. They both walked away without an apology.  What a great first impression of this place. NOT! I did speak to the manager and asked her why they are not trained to ask first before assuming something. I was offended by the manner that we were treated. I also told her that there is only one chance to make a first impression and that I was not impressed and would probably never eat there again.  I also shared with her that my complaint probably didnt matter because they had such a large tourist base but that to the local customer it does matter how another resident is treated. The food, ah just OK.  I had the tomato basil pasta. Not very flavorful and the pasta was undercooked and very chewy.  Save your money and eat across the street at California Pizza Kitchen where the pasta is always al dente and the service unlike the cattle service and treatment at the Cheesecake Factory."
Ajeet K.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/5/2015,"Really crowded, thanks to prime location but dinner started with really arrogant waiter.  No basic courtesy and looks like he is forced to do his job. Disgusting thats all I can say. Really pissed off and what shameful ending of an awesome day."
Angelique S.,"Honolulu, HI",130,29,35,2.0,11/4/2014,I love Cheesecake Factory but I'm sad to say that the quality of food and service was not good today.   It took 7 minutes for our waitress to come to our table after we were seated by the hostess.  Our appetizer avocado eggrolls came 30 seconds before our entrees so we had to eat both at the same time.  The eggrolls were soggy and not crisp on the outside.  My fries with my fish & chips tasted stale and salty.  I ordered another batch and although less salty it still tasted stale.  Our water glasses had no waster and the waitress came to our table three times without refilling it.  We finally asked another waitress for water.  We were here at 2 pm.  No line and it was not busy at all.  Very disappointing lunch today.
Diane E.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,1074,28,4.0,8/17/2012,"You just can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  They have it all...as evidenced by the 'book' rather than menu :-) We arrived here - starving - after spending the day doing various activities.  My 2 year old granddaughter was given a booster seat to sit in...and the waiter immediately brought out a plate of bread and sliced bananas for her.  Wow!  Great service and they must know how hungry (and impatient) a baby gets. My daughter ordered a 'lunch sized' salad -- which was huge.  My son-in-law ordered a pork sandwich -- which was huge.  I ordered the chicken avocado club -- which was huge.  We also ordered the kid-sized Mac & Cheese...that lasted for 3 meals for the cheese-loving baby.  We all took food home to have later for dinner. We shared a slice of the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake and it was delicious :-) Great location in Waikiki and as we trudged our food-coma selves back to the parking lot to retrieve the car, I was happy for the exercise."
Zachary A.,"San Jose, CA",232,13,10,3.0,7/22/2015,"Great location. Always very busy. We had a party of 20 for a friends birthday. Upon arriving we received a buzzer and when we finally got paged we had been told that they could only seat 11 of us since the other 9 of us had not yet arrived and the other 9 of us would need to be seated elsewhere and away from us. The manager on duty, Max, was incredibly rude the entire time and not friendly to any of the children that were in our party. The waiter and waitress attending to us were more than amazing but this visit was quite horrific due to the management."
Jessica P.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",122,84,116,5.0,7/12/2014,We went here tonight for my birthday dinner. Great time! Drinks are great! I had their red sangria... Super tasty with apples and strawberries inside. My husband had a blueberry and a passion fruit Mojito and loved them both.  I'm a lover of kalua pork and the Cheesecake Factory didn't dissapoint. We ordered the BBQ kalua pork sandwich and the kalua pork pizza. Both were amazing! My only complaint was that the pork sandwich was a little fatty... But that's normal for kalua pork. We shared a piece of the coffee cheesecake. Yum!
Ram K.,"Kaneohe, HI",66,467,780,5.0,11/5/2012,"Got here around 4 pm on a Saturday. Pretty busy but no line! Got seated in a few minutes. Ordered Black Iced teas for my gf and I. Wow they have a large menu and everything looks good. Started with Crab cakes. Waitress brought over some bread. I needed extra time to look over the menu. Decided to get the lunch portion Miso Salmon, it turned out to be the most moist and tasty salmon I ever had! I don't really care for salmon but am trying to eat healthier, so if I say it's good, it's really good! My gf had the  combo steak Diane/ shrimp scampi. Crab cakes were good and so was our meal. Too stuffed for dessert but we ordered it for take-out. Oreo cheesecake for me and caramel pecan turtle for my gf. Excellent service. Our iced teas never went below half way. Came by couple times to check on us. If it wasn't for the idea of driving into Waikiki, dealing with traffic and parking we would definitely come here more often."
Alina H.,"Honolulu, HI",13,10,,3.0,12/12/2014,Food is always great. the pasta da vinci is my personal favorite. however the line is crazy long you could be waiting for hours and they wont take reservations.  another thing- they are right on the beach and they don't have an ocean view? kind of funny.  if you don't mind waiting for what seems like hours. the food is great!
Jacks B.,"Sonora, CA",2,15,,5.0,12/2/2015,"Well worth the wait!  Ordered up the Shepherds Pie and it was the best. The server, Ryan, was one cool cat!  He had a great sense of humor and personality (most servers don't). It's nice to have a server that can shoot the bull a little and still do his job very well. He came by several times to make sure everything was good. He got our drinks to us quickly and the food was perfect. It was the best overall meal and service we've had in the last week in Hawaii. Cheesecake Factory is lucky to have that guy!"
Joanna H.,"Kailua, HI",3,18,23,4.0,11/29/2014,"I would give it 5 stars but waiting 45 mins is too long. BUT! Just get there early enough so you can put your name down (they don't take reservations) & go shopping! This place is great for kids (noisy so no one will mind if they're making a lot of noise), they also give kids a bread & banana plate. Start off with the Mac & Cheese balls, they are deep fried to perfection & the accompanying marinara sauce which seems to be cheesy, makes the experience even more enjoyable. Also, try the shrimp bistro pasta, it's a must."
Preston G.,"Wahiawa, HI",47,3,,1.0,1/1/2016,"So, hoping to have an awesome first dinner in 2016 while staying in Waikiki, we call in a take out order. We figure it's going to be crazy busy (yes it was) so we walk it down to kill time.  My two boys starving waiting to scarf down some steak. We get there after a 15 minute walk and make our way inside through the craziness outside and the line trying to get in.  We ask one of the hostesses where we needed to go for take out orders and she points us to a long line by the cheesecakes.  After about a 10 minute wait, the customer behind us asks another employee if we were in the correct place for take out orders because everyone else seemed to be ordering cheesecakes.  The employee tells us we are in the cheesecake line and need to go to another register! Upset and starving at this point, we excuse our way through another mess of people to the register and the cashier is busy looking busy.  (Who knows what the heck she was doing.  She didn't acknowledge me yet.)  So I tell her I'm picking up a take-out order.  After a few more seconds she asks for my name.  I give her my name and she can't find anything.  I give her my wife's name, nothing.  She asks what I ordered.  So I tell her and she picks up some receipts and starts punching stuff in.  Then she asks me again what I ordered.  Nothing.  She tells me hold on and walks to the back.  Tack on 5 more minutes.  She comes back and tells me she is waiting for someone in the office to transfer orders to her, but said she saw food that looks like my order in the back.  She asks me again for my name and disappears to the back again.  5 more minutes, my son is complaining because he is starving, and a gentleman standing next to me tells me he's been waiting there for an hour already.  I'm surrounded by people who don't look too happy.  The cashier finally returns, this time with back up.  The guy who came with her tells me ""apparently"" SOMEONE lost my order and they would have to place my order and I would have to ""wait a bit."" So I tell him that the cashier said she saw an order that looked like mine in the back but they would have to start all over again and I would have to wait even longer than I and my starving family already had AFTER calling ahead to avoid waiting!  He said yes.  I shook my head and told him Happy New Year and walked away as he shrugged his shoulders. Thanks a lot Cheesecake Factory for making the start of 2016 horrible for this local and his Ohana and for not even acting like you cared.  Only care about the tourist...auwe!"
Fabian S.,"Friedrichshafen, Germany",18,10,1,5.0,12/31/2015,Constantly great food & service. Love the burgers there. The wait time is always between 20-90min but it is worth!
Hugh S.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,12,14,3.0,12/31/2014,"Normally you have to wait in line to eat here. Today we were seated as soon as we arrived. So that is one star. Our teenage son is notorious in our family for not liking anything. He assumed he could only eat cheesecake. Instead the menu is about 25 pages long and has almost everything. So another star from this. We had a great set of courses, one each as the portions are huge. The waiter was very attentive and kept the kids drinks topped-up with the free refills.   Hit the spot on News Years Eve when we had a long wait until the next meal. Thats the third star."
Nancy G.,"Calabasas, CA",1,64,7,1.0,10/29/2015,"Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I will ever get to eat here.  Called  two times, it rang and rang and rang and both times somebody picked up the phone and hung it up   I never got to ask my question. This is not customer service."
Ruben A.,"San Diego, CA",275,93,38,1.0,4/17/2016,"Absolutely disgusting customer service! The manager was horrible her name was Lynn.  I've have been to these restaurants in several states and this is by far the worst! The customer service has always been top notch at each other CKF I've been to. This by far is the worst I have ever experienced. And the professionalism is so substandard that it is unbelievable! Our manager cannot handle situations dealing with patrons.  And she was one of the worst people I have encountered in any supervisory element.  One person in my group of 7 had his meal not remade because of the disorganization Lynn the manager caused !! She would never make it in A mainland Cheesecake Factory, she can get away with it due to the high tourism traffic. The worst experience I ever  had at  any of the chains! She had my daughter in tears and my wife sarcastically thanked her for it and she said you are welcome how disgusting is that??!? Really a little girl??"
A G.,"Honolulu, HI",39,9,4,5.0,12/21/2015,Seated right away.  Service was courteous but not overbearing.  Food portions are huge for a great price compared to Waikiki standards ($13 - $18 for the standard dishes) (Filet $32) .  Waitress explained all of our questions without delay.  Food was hot and fresh.  Red skinned garlic mashed potato's were on point!  Will recommend this location.
Dusten U.,"Honolulu, HI",127,14,2,5.0,4/27/2014,Came here to eat with my girlfriend and friend and expected really high quality service! And seeing how I work in the industry of serving I know what good service is! Started my meal off with a strawberry lemonade and it was delicious! One of the best that I've ever tried! For appetizer I got the deep fried mac and cheese balls! It was really rich but soo delicious with the marinara marinade was excellent! For my main course I decided to go old school and get spaghetti in meat sauce and it was average! I little salty but not too bad! But for everything the service made this meal exceptional! If you ever go to cheese cake factory ask to sit with Santana he is a very good server and made this experience one to remember!
Chanyle N.,"Waipahu, HI",358,32,172,5.0,4/2/2014,Good service good food! Went to check out the new H&M n do some shopping needed to girl up before we did that lol Haven't been here in years... Reminds me what I've been missing out on! First Get the brown bread yum! My son loved it! And my son who's 1 got a complimentary soup from our waiter to start him off since the food would take awhile .. Another plus soo accommodating for children n babies love that he did that for us! Got the lemon herb roasted chicken it was delicious! Gobbled it all up! Me n my family shared the tiramisu cheesecake! Very delicious.. Coming back more!!!!!!! Gives me one more plus when going shopping at f21 and H&M n prolly need to check out more new shops in waikiki!
Kerryn J.,"Melbourne, Australia",0,2,,1.0,1/18/2016,"Overall I think this place has got too big for itself.  We enjoyed the food, however due to the volume of people moving through the restaurant, the service from our server (Jessica P) was the worst we have experienced on our 5 week trip throughout the USA.   They seated us in a booth that was way too cold to the extent that our children had to leave the table and go outside, even after we mentioned it to the staff.   I would normally rate this higher due to the quality of the food, but our experience tonight just ruined it for us. Forget this restaurant go to Bills Sydney - we went there twice and had brilliant food and service on both occasions."
Michael R.,"Honolulu, HI",156,4,,5.0,2/1/2016,This place is great! Amazing taste in all foods. I always get the chipotle pasta! :) my family and I always come for birthdays and events. Last Christmas I had a great time and the waiter Jerry was great
