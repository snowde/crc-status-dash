Kristy N.,"Mililani, HI",52,24,308,3.0,4/24/2013,I always think I'll like the entrees when I come here but I never do. Either I'm ordering the wrong items or I'm just gonna stick to their appetizers!! Update: the Cajun Jambalaya pasta was better the next day.
Belinda A.,"Hialeah, FL",2,37,48,1.0,7/5/2015,So I order a pasta with no sausage only shrimp but instead the waitress punch in only sausage so after 20 minutes waiting for the food to arrived I was sent back and everyone is eating but me. Nice!!!
Jenna T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",189,39,223,2.0,6/10/2012,"*Be prepared to wait an hour or longer.   We went on a Saturday evening around 630ish and were seated around 8pm, but that's the usual wait time* Pros:  cheesecake is always good (gotta be, that's what they're known for) and the spicy ahi tempura roll is delicious.  Oh and if course the free bread.   Cons:  The long wait of course, they don't take reservations!  They need to work on mixing their lava flow and piña colada drinks, cuz that just tasted awful.  It can be noisy. Just to explain about the noise...We were seated all the way in the back adjacent to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.  Unfortunately there was at outside party that night at the hotel and the loudness of the base and music made it difficult for us to carry a conversation, hear our waiter and it was just a bad experience.  It's too bad they don't have the option to close the outside when theres events being held at the hotel.   I could tell that we weren't the only ones that weren't enjoying ourselves.  Some of the older Japanese tourists were covering their ears and making faces.  I don't mind noise in restaurants, but this was just bad.   Now the food.  We had a party of 8, and everyone ordered something different so we all can taste because there are SO MUCH items to choose from!!!  To be honest, they could get rid of a lot, because they jut did not taste great.  Not to be too critical, but I think you would have high expectations especially when the wait time is so long.  To tell you the truth, none of they entrees we ordered had a wow factor.  It was just all ""okay"". The only great or tasty meal we enjoyed is again, the bread, cheesecake, and the spicy ahi tempura roll. Ah service...it was eh, ok.  When they brought out our food, they told my mom that they're still cooking her asparagus and it would be out shortly.  My mom waited and waited, and just started to eat her meal.  Of course it never came, and when the waiter came to check up on us, she explained that she was still waiting.    You could tell she was upset, and he brought the manager over.  The manager and over apologizing with a plate of asparagus (which was only 2 pieces), and she said that she didn't want it since she was already done eating .  The manager then offered ""1"" free cheesecake. ONE!?  Are u kidding me?  We've gone to other restaurants and they would take a percentage off the bill and they only thing he offered was a slice of cheesecake!?    Kinda mind boggling, but they're just not interested in customers returning I guess. I remember eating here years ago and remembering the food tasting a lot better.    My advice is to skip the wait, don't waste your time, and they sell cheesecakes at Costco, so YOU know WHERE to go! :)"
Lexi F.,"Waipahu, HI",0,5,,2.0,7/2/2015,"Wednesday night and waited 50 minutes for a two-top. All of that would have been ok since the food is usually good but not tonight. Bad food and a bad waitress.  We waited at the bar and got drinks and an app. The bartender was great. When we got our table, we immediately ordered. 20 min go by and the waitress says, ""I just checked on your food and it will be just a couple of more minutes."" 20 more minutes until we finally get our food. In the mean time, a couple who sat down 30 min after us got their food. When we did get our food, the items ranged from cold to luke warm. The plates obviously sat in the window. The butter wasnt melting on my mashed potatoes because they werent hot. My hubby's plate was missing his tempura asparagus and his food was cold too.  When he notified the waitress to tell her about the missing food, she said she knew but she never mentioned anything about the missing food when she dropped our plates. Nor did she tell him the asparagus was coming. My hubby asked her to take the plate back and he didn't want a replacement. She left with a sour look on her face.  Manager Marshall came to us within 5 min and was very cordial. He attempted to make it right and comped both of our entrees. My hubby was over it and refused another plate. Marshall asked if it was ok for our server to come back to us and we agreed.  However, a different server came to finish our meal until it was time for the check.  He was nice and I started to feel better about the night although my man was still upset. Then the original server came back and she did not offer an apology. In fact, she slammed the check down with a mumbled ""thank you"" and ran away.  I deliberately left her zero tip. My man is currently a server and I was a server throughout college. Her behavior was unacceptable. The manager and second server made a good attempt at service recovery for her screw up but her sour attitude ruined it.  Total 2 hour wait for our entrees, one of which we sent back. Not worth it. I should have stayed home."
Kathy L.,"Auckland, New Zealand",728,338,1,4.0,7/31/2014,"Came here for a blueberry white choc cheesecake lunch! Was a neat one with the original cheesecake swirled with blueberries with white chocolate mousse. Coupled this with the Tropical smoothie which had the refreshing icy blend of mango, passionfruit, pineapple and coconut- perfect for the warmth! Didn't realise until we were sat down by a waiter how big the place was- we kept walking in towards the back, deeper and deeper and there were so many tables! And they were all packed or almost! Such a popular place- but you can see why for it's great cheesecakes- the hardest part is always picking one out of the many many they have on offer! Definitely a must visit if you like cheesecakes- classic American!"
John H.,"Kapolei, HI",4,8,36,4.0,9/27/2014,Came here for my mom and daughters bday.  I had the pit beef dip sandwich which was a winner. I think it's worth the wait and also a no rush environment.
Nikki N.,"Vallejo, CA",37,411,,4.0,2/16/2015,"Great, attentive service and so much variety on the menu. No reservations are taken so prepare for a long wait. I recommend to get here when they first open. Our wait was short which was awesome. Fried Mac and cheese, carnitas, and gumbo was on our menu. Carnitas were bland as fudge but everything else was ok."
Isa R.,"Honolulu, HI",389,332,833,4.0,7/9/2012,"On food alone, this place would get 5 stars.  It's actually one of my favorite restaurants to go to period. So why only 4 stars? (1)  You have to park at the Royal Hawaiian and walk over.  It's not THAT far of a walk, but still.  It's not easy to just run in and get take out.  Plus, the location is in Waikiki.  I reallllly don't like coming into Waikiki if I don't have to.  If they built another one on island that wasn't in Waikiki, you can guarantee I'd be there all the time! (2)  Twice I've gone there and they ran out of over half the cheesecakes, AKA, all of the flavors I'd want.  It reminds me of when I went to Buca di Beppo and they said they ran out of cheese.  An Italian restaurant running out of CHEESE?!?  That knocked out 93.7% of the menu.   (3)  The wait for dinner is insane.  Like, 2 hours, insane.  Wish they took reservations.  I suggest if you're having a craving, go during lunch time.  I went at around 1 PM on a weekend recently and we waited only 5 minutes.  I dig that.  If you're waiting for dinner, I suggest trekking over to Forever 21 next door.  That store is huge.  Great place to kill time.  Just make sure your buzzer thing is within reach, or make sure someone else who's with you stays closer to the restaurant with it.  :D The food is what keeps me coming back the few times I brave the wait and craziness of Waikiki.  I alwaayyssss have to order the calamari.  It comes with cocktail sauce and some kind of garlic aioli (I really don't know, but it tastes delicious).  Probably one of my favorite places to get calimari, period. The menu is so extensive here, but I pretty much always end up getting the steak diane and salmon combo.  Aaaand the oreo cheesecake to top off the meal doesn't hurt either.  I wish they had some kind of cheesecake sampler though.  I always want to try different flavors but am always worried I won't like it.  Also, best strawberry lemonade.  Period.  They don't just use lemonade with strawberry syrup, they blend real strawberries.  You can see the strawberry seeds in the glass.  Free refills at that.  ;) Build one in Kapolei or something!"
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,1/9/2013,"I love Cheesecake factory, especially their shrimp bistro pasta (which of course was featured in those online articles of ""eat this not that"" as a do-not-eat-this dish).  Each Cheesecake factory makes this dish taste delicious, and this location was no different. It was yummie!!   We had visited the Cheesecake factory twice while in Hawaii.  During my first visit, I ordered the fish tacos (grilled).  I really did not enjoy it. The fish portions were SUPER small.  They probably would have looked much larger if they were battered.  The tacos were more tortilla, cabbage, and salsa than fish.  (Thats why I had to return to Cheesecake factory another time to get my pasta dish--my fault for trying something new). I really wanted to eat a slice of cheesecake here but I really had no extra room in my stomach for it. The portions here are huge!! Plus, they give super delicious bread and butter before the meal arrives, which made me even more full! I love this place! Service is always good here and they are so busy that they have to be hard workers! The line for dinner was ridiculous. When we arrived at 6pm, we were told a 1.5 hour wait.  When we arrived at 5pm, we were told a 10-15 minute wait.  Get here for an early dinner if you can!"
Denise L.,"Honolulu, HI",151,3,,5.0,3/22/2015,"This place is a mad house during dinner time, but the food is worth the wait and apparently so is the service. Jess P is super energetic, funny, and attentive! I love her~!"
Cindy L.,"Honolulu, HI",212,549,3672,3.0,12/30/2010,"Just visited Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  No wait time.  Perfect!  I had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($17.89), which is shrimp and chicken sautéed with onions, tomato and peppers in a very spicy Cajuns topped over pasta.  The taste was just excellent, a perfect hint of spice and the portion size is huge, I shared it with my friend.  We also had the red velvet cheesecake.  I was a bite disappointed at the cheesecake, it was dense and WAY TOO SWEET.  Oh, my other friend had ordered the Misoyaki Salmon with rice.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, totally moist.   This is always a good place for a decent meal with great atmosphere."
Susan W.,"Honolulu, HI",266,213,637,4.0,3/27/2012,"I really really realllyy love coming here for whatever reason. Too bad they are somewhat on the expensive side for me. But I think it's worth it! :D I came here so many times for friend's birthdays, and even for work occasions. It really is one of my favorite places to eat in Waikiki, for both lunch and dinner. If you are coming here for dinner, I think you should definitely come earlier than you intend to eat. The waiting after 6pm is terrible... when my friends literally decided on last minute to eat here, we had to wait like about a couple of hours for a table. We were so annoyed cause we were dying to eat after 5 hours of karaoke. But good thing the neighboring stores helped us to kill time. We spent some time in Apple Store and Forever 21. The first time I came here, I ordered the charbroiled flat iron steak. It was good, but very tough to bite AND cut. I had a hard time, but maybe that's cause I'm kinda weak and have no upper body strength but still. The fried calamari appetizer was delicious though. After coming back often, I found out that my favorite appetizer is definitely the spicy ahi tempura roll. I could literally just eat that and be full. But I also do like eating the fetticini alfredo as well :D andddd last but not least, they have the best cheesecake. I don't have a favorite since me and my friends always like trying new and different ones everytime we come here. But my favorites are red velvet and I don't remember the name but it had coffee in it lol."
Dan M.,"Provo, UT",13,34,1,2.0,5/18/2014,"My wife and I like the Cheesecake Factory, but this location is not very good. We had about a 20 minute wait, which actually went very fast. It took longer for our waitress to acknowledge our existence once we were seated. She didn't show up for a good 20-25 minutes. From there, we ordered our food, which took even longer. Instead of updating us on our food, she kept apologizing that there was no bread. We were there at 9pm, so there is no reason they should be short on bread, but we just wanted our food. When the food arrived, we felt underwhelmed. My usual cheesesteak sandwich was nasty. My wife's pasta that was supposed to have artichokes was pretty barren. All we got were apologies about the bread, which came after our food. When we told the waitress we didn't want dessert, she seemed very put off that we weren't ordering more.  If you want the same Cheesecake Factory you get at home, you will be sorely disappointed. Go to a local joint instead. Stop feeding chains like this that life tourists away from the real gems in Waikiki and Honolulu."
Odille C.,"Honolulu, HI",174,96,81,5.0,7/30/2014,"I have seriously considered going here just for the cheesecake. The wait can be long, but thats usually because people like going there at night. During the day its pretty quick. There is a weird waiter there, I don't really know how to describe him, he's just odd. Other than that the food is phenomenal. I love the cheesecake. Its also really dark in cheesecake factory, I'll never understand."
Allysha G.,"Sydney, Australia",15,14,28,5.0,10/10/2015,"Only been here for lunch, but we have eaten here 4 times already, haha. The service is great, and we have had to wait for a table twice - but not for more than 10 minutes. Big lines for dinner if you get there after 6pm. Food is great, their pizza is crunchy and crisp and their salads are amazing. Loads of flavour. Don't be scared to share your meals, portions are big!!"
Holly B.,"Honolulu, HI",125,965,312,4.0,3/28/2014,"The lunch menu is a little less expensive than the regular menu, the food comes out quickly and is tasty and filling.  Jonathan was a great server and accommodated our requests promptly and efficiently.  Way to go Jonathan!"
Yani W.,"Waimanalo, HI",0,5,5,5.0,12/27/2015,The food and service were good even though we waited for a long time. The cheese cake was delicious.
Michael Q.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,3,5.0,10/7/2014,"Jen is a delightful server! From beginning to end Jen was really attentive and helpful, and she suggested all the right dishes to order! We ordered the Thai chicken wrap for appetizer and the ono fish specials plus strawberry daiquiris!  Everything was so delicious! Jen always made sure that our drinks were refilled and the food was to our liking! She  really made our experience at the cheesecake factory outstanding!"
Kayler H.,"Widener, AR",97,87,774,2.0,4/22/2014,"OMG where do I start.... The bread was horrible along with the steak! The restaurant was cold, noisy, & service was crazy.... cheese cake factory is so overrated any way..... fast seating but horrible food!"
Peter H.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,4.0,7/5/2016,"Keep an eye on your seating number. I was given a number to be seated. While waiting to be seated I struck up a conversation with another customer with a higher number to be seated. To my surprise this individual's number was called to be seated before me. I decided to inquire about the number system and was told that the numbers aren't called in sequence. Again to my surprise my number suddenly came up. Hum...  The lady at the reception counter gave a two hour estimate, but we got to our tables within an hour. Hum... Once the food came to the table though, all was good. :) 1. Excellent portions. 2. Very delicious meals (everyone satisfied). 3. Well worth the wait. 4. No one at my table finished their meal. Overall - Awesome restaurant, but you have to be willing to wait. I give 4 1/2 stars because I believe there's some tricky business going on at the reception counter (manipulation of the numbers)."
