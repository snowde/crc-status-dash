Kieran H.,"Kingswood, Australia",19,116,92,4.0,8/4/2014,"The service was faultless, the food portions were ENORMOUS and the value was fantastic.  Back home in Sydney we would expect to pay 3x more than we did here for a comparable meal.  Whilst it was a little loud (due to how busy it was) you didn't need to raise your voice much to talk to the person with you.  The quality of the food was excellent."
Denny J.,"Rockford, IL",0,10,,1.0,12/21/2015,"send in survey....as instructed on my receipt.......within 3 days,  11 days have gone by ZERO reward received.  bummer.     Otherwise ""love the place"" !"
Sharmagne S.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",1,9,1,5.0,11/7/2015,Everything was delicious! Everything was cooked perfectly so props to the chefs! Our server Tamy was really great. :)
Julia S.,"Leneva, Australia",9,14,1,5.0,12/19/2015,"We loved the Cheesecake Factory and ate there a few times. The service is excellent and everything we ate there was fantastic. Entree (main course) serves are very large and enough to share if you aren't starving or want to save room for cheesecake. The cheesecakes are all amazing and the serves are massive. You can get serves to take away as well.  There are often large crowds waiting for a table. If you go for breakfast, lunch or an early dinner you can generally avoid the queues. Enjoy!"
Jody S.,"Honolulu, HI",357,422,164,4.0,10/8/2012,"L-O-V-E ALL of the Cheesecake Factories that I've visited. My fave is San Fran, located in the heart of the city in Macys. I took a quick trip up there a few months ago on a weekend to have a 'fun' getaway with a special someone. We dined late one evening at the San Fran Factory under freezing conditions. The food, and the company, was well worth it. Flash forward to last week when my rugrats were on Fall break. We made a trek into Waikiki to visit the Honolulu Zoo and wanted to treat them to a nice lunch at a new place. Surprisingly enough we got in immediately--NO long lines, NO 2-hour wait. Just waltzed right in and sat down--LOVE it! The girls ate their usual standard--mac and cheese and pasta alfredo. I enjoyed a veggie pizza and a salad combo. It was delicious AND filling. We all couldn't finish it and took it home for dinner that night."
Jennifer L.,"Las Vegas, NV",234,156,38,5.0,2/23/2014,"The bathrooms are tastefully decorated! The food, service, drinks, and desserts deliver consistently. Price for a slice of cheesecake is a bit expensive but well worth when you take your first bite.  I've been seated in dining area, the bar, and outdoors and all pleasant. Except on a humid day, but want to sit inside especially when you're on a romantic date (nice dim lighting at night) and don't want sweat marks on your clothes. I've tried the oreo, lemon or some tart,  tiramisu cheesecakes and were all rich but not uncomfortably filling.   I've had the club house and fries, generous portions.   Appetizers were great, filled me up.  I love using their bathroom!"
Jimmy L.,"Honolulu, HI",103,134,223,4.0,4/24/2012,"3.5 is accurate This restaurant does not take reservations and of course, it doesn't really need to because they're packed. It helps to go about an hour before you actually plan to eat, to sign in. The time it takes for you to be seated, order, and get your food is enough to strike up a healthy appetite. Also, try not to order appetizers unless you have a big group. You want to save room for the meal and DESSERT which is why you're at the CHEESECAKE Factory, right? About a week ago, we all came for a celebratory dinner. The wait was about half an hour around 5:00pm and we were seated near the outer area (which I prefer because inside is too dim). Being such a big fan of steak, I decided to order the ribeye. However, on their menu, they only mentioned the ribeye being grilled and not ""char grilled"". Hence, the special request. Unfortunately, I don't think the waitress knew the difference. She stated, ""oh, it is."" when I asked for my ribeye to be char grilled. Needless to say, the food wasn't up to par. The fries which came with the steak were great though! The ribeye itself is actually better than the one I've had at Roy's Waikiki unfortunately and at half the price, I shouldn't complain. I take the points off for the lack of reservation options and the food. Although there was nothing WRONG with my food, I was just not impressed. My friend on the other hand had a bad dinner. Check my pictures for reference!"
Mindy F.,"Kapaa, HI",12,1,,5.0,5/20/2016,"I came into the cheesecake factory for lunch. I had the best experience with the bartender Sheri. She was awesome! Very personable,attentive, and obviously cared alot about her job. As a bartender myself I really appreciate to see that. She is an amazing example of a great employee. She even gave me advice about a nail salon to try. I have never written a review before, but her exceptional service deserved to be recognized. Thank you Sheri! The cheesecake factory is very lucky to have you!"
Eric R.,"Renton, WA",0,5,,1.0,10/29/2015,"Worst service ever! Loooooong wait to get a table, snooty staff (yes, its Cheesecake Factory) and the prices are much higher than the restaurant at home.....ugh, after 4 days on vacation I just wanted something predictable to eat. Worst experience ever!!"
Ian G.,"Kailua, HI",102,143,107,5.0,6/12/2014,"Love Cheescake Factory.  Unfortunately this particular one is the busiest in the nation.  Nevertheless, they still offer great food and quick service.  Although the wait times are approx 30-75minutes during evening hours.  The location is in a great location near many stores, like H & M and Apple.  So burning time isn't to much a factor if your waiting to get ""buzzed"" for a table.  They also have great music on friday nights.  Although it seems extremely busy in the restaurant, every waiter is extremely quick.  Also you don't have to wait long for your order to come out.  All in all, I love eating at this restaurant."
Amber C.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,7,,5.0,6/28/2016,"Always a win when it comes to Cheesecake Factory, food is always spot on however this time I was very impressed by our server Tyler. He was extremely professional and genuine in his delivery from start to finish. Thank you for your hospitality, your kindness and attention to our needs were very much noticed and appreciated. Hope others are able to enjoy his delightful presence. Thank you Tyler!"
Denalee C.,"Honolulu, HI",485,360,201,3.0,3/25/2014,"I've had a gift card to this place that has been burning a hole in my wallet for at least a year.  Unfortunately, I'm not a girl that likes to wait two hours for dinner.  So when my friend suggested lunch on a week day, I'm there! The wait was short (plus there's great shopping while you wait) and we got a booth in the bar area.  The bread basket comes with white and pumpernickel bread, but oh that pumpernickel is delicious-soft, chewy and a little dash of sweet. I'm in heaven.  I seriously have a thing for pumpernickel (see my review for Ruby Tuesday). I ordered a lunch special everything pizza and salad combo.  The pizza was tasty but the crust was mostly soggy :(  bummer.  The salad was nicely dressed but otherwise standard.   We also ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake..and the flourless part of it tasted...well...flourless.  It wasn't bad, but maybe I should have made a better choice :) Overall, the experience was decent and the best part was I didn't have the endless wait for a table!"
Brittany L.,"Port Orchard, WA",25,125,20,2.0,9/3/2012,"I have mixed feelings about this cheesecake factory.  Like other reviewers said there is always a long wait.  Last time we went at 9:15 pm and got seated around 10pm on a Tuesday.   Service is a hit or miss.  I really wanted cheesecake (pregnant cravings) so I made my husband wait to eat dinner.  We ordered two salads.  The table next to us was empty when we ordered our food.  That table got their HOT food before our salads.  My husband ordered a Sangria and by the time it got to our table we both forgot he ordered it.  Then it was time for cheesecake.  We were so tired that we ordered it to go.  We got strawberry cheesecake and our server gave us a smaller than normal slice with three strawberrys, no syrup and just the completely wrong order.  We got home to Kapolei and I opened the bag and tears ran down my face knowing my pregnancy craving was not going to be statisfied.  The wait staff that works lunch seems WAY better than the night crew.  I've never had bad service for lunch. This place is just not that great. And when you get poor service it's a terrible experience."
Shawna A.,"Kapolei, HI",2,70,164,3.0,5/17/2014,"We came here to celebrate a birthday.  After reading the previous reviews, I expected a long wait time.  We got here at 5:25pm and was told wait time is 50 mins.  Because they are so busy, the quality of service you receive goes down.  It takes time for them to get your drink order and/or check if everything is ok.   I ordered a California Cheesesteak which was blah!  The bread was hard and Cheesesteak itself had no flavor.  I had to ask for a steak knife to cut it.  Then I gave up and used my hands to pick it up.  I didn't eat half.  My husband LOVED the Shepherd's Pie though. He enjoyed it both times we've visited the place. Here's the gross part....they decide to wipe the condensation on the vents above us!!!!  EWWWW! I don't think they thought of the dust or crap that would fall in our drinks/food. I guess the only time I'd be back is if my husband is hungry for Shepherd's Pie....and I'll stick with dessert."
Ryan T.,"Tamuning, Guam",193,19,12,5.0,8/19/2015,This place always has great food and good service. Servers are trained to follow a traditional sequence of service and its timed just right. Prices are actually pretty reasonable. Live entertainment. Only downside to this place is that it is so busy the wait times are normally at least an hour. At least you can take a nice stroll through Waikiki while waiting.
Jose A.,"San Diego, CA",53,35,204,3.0,7/27/2014,"It's Cheesecake Factory, there's really nothing to add in my review that you haven't already read somewhere else.  The food is great, the service is good!  What sucks is the one hour and thirty minute wait time. In San Diego, the longest I've waited to eat at a cheesecake factory was 45 minutes.  Also theirs never a large mob of people just standing their waiting.   But I guess the tourists in Waikiki really want their cheescake.   I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, which is what my wife normally orders.  She isn't here with me in Hawaii so I called her and asked her what I should get.  Of course she replied with her favorite.  So in tribute to my wife I got what she would've ordered, and it was delicious!"
Andrew D.,"San Diego, CA",142,40,68,3.0,4/2/2015,"My friends and I all went out to cheese cake as a treat to ourself.  We love Cheesecake Factory because during the wait, all the guys sit at the bar, and all the girls walk around and shop.  The service at the bar was great.  Really a 5/5.  But as soon as we got our seats our new waiter totally forgot about us.  I don't mind waiting for food, I understand it takes time to cook, but my problem is when the waiters take a half and hour just to greet you at the table. I really like when the waiters check in on you, refill your bread and water while you wait, but our waiter never did that.  The only time we saw him was when he brought us food.  We even had to get up and find him to get our check because we got tired of waiting. It's so difficult because we love the food and location at Cheesecake Factory but the service really kills it for us and I'm not sure if we'll go back."
Case S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,2,3.0,10/14/2014,"After a long (long) wait, once we got in, we had a really pleasant experience. I don't like how dark it is inside, but that's just me. Our server was great, the food comes in huge portions, and the various flavors of cheesecake make it even more fun (even though I feel like the prices were quite high for one slice of cheesecake). All in all, minus the long wait and the overly dimmed lights, it was pretty good."
Tony G.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",656,30,41,5.0,8/13/2015,Cheesecake Factory is ways amazing.  I have eaten there so many times and no matter what o order the food is always great.  Endless choices and service is always great
Savina C.,"Honolulu, HI",451,118,33,5.0,6/19/2012,"I love love love cheesecake factory!! Hands down, the best sangria in town. When it comes to catching up with my bestie this is the place to go. We come around lunch time because the wait is not ridiculous. Also they have a lunch special which is a good portion for good price. We never have room for dessert but we get it anyway.. It's cheesecake.. How can you not.. It's always a hit or miss with the server... They can be really attentive or never be seen. Which doesn't brother me because the overall staff help makes up for it.. I don't recommend coming at dinner time. The wait is outrageous. After all it's Waikiki"
