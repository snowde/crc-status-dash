Mo W.,"Honolulu, HI",0,49,80,4.0,9/4/2015,Food and drinks were great! Our waiter Harvi was really nice-very talkative. Celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday! She had her first Passion Fruit Mojito there...yummmm
J M.,"Waipahu, HI",0,2,,1.0,1/18/2015,An hour half wait time was to be expected. But from the time we we were seated till we exited is where it counts. Katrina A was our waitress. Unreal and unbelievable how slow service was. But hey gave her the benefit of the doubt. So she took 15 minutes before she even greeted us. We sat there no menu no water. Then she got our order wrong and charged us for an extra meal which I caught by reviewing my bill.  Because the service was slow and she screwed up the order plus we were there mostly waiting during  our 2 hour sit I honestly wanted to tip her less than 10%.. however I tipped her 10% not the 15 18 or 20% she made sure to point out on the bottom of the bill.  Then as we exit she stops us after looking at the bill. She says excuse me you tipped me wrong. And that we were supposed to tip her the 20%. What a fool. Shes lucky she even got 10%. Unreal how her customer service and etiquette was... Simply rude and lacking common sense. She must've never got the memo that small parties arent required to tip any given amount. Hey heres a tip for you Katrina... check yo self before you approach your customers and try embarrassing them... you only embarrassed yourself in front your manager and colleagues.  Atmosphere: busy and slippery floor  Food: delicious as always..especially the rib eye  Front hostess staff: very nice and friendly  Wait help: Booooo. Horrible
Kaitlyn M.,"Clackamas, OR",4,8,4,2.0,8/28/2015,"I went here for a friend's birthday and ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta. It was so salty I could barely eat it. I am not the type of person to send food back because I don't want to waste food and I was too hungry at the time to wait for them to remake it. I did, however, inform the waitress to tell the cooks that it was incredibly salty. I would have liked to have her offer to take it off my tab because it was pretty gross to eat but that never happened. The only reason this is getting two stars is because the Oreo cheesecake we ordered was amazing. DONT ORDER THE SHRIMP WITH ANGEL HAIR PASTA. Unless you like eating straight up salt."
Kenny L.,"Arnold, MO",0,1,,5.0,6/14/2016,"My name is Kenny,  My family and I are from Atlanta GA. And are regulars at Cheesecake Factory in every state we visit. I brought my family into your restaurant on Sunday. this was the second time in our two week stay. Both times we were blessed with not only great food but also great service. I am a doctor in psychology so I tend to watch people a lot. The serving crew ,food runners and bussers are all great. I noticed there were new servers training both days only because we were blessed to be apart of that training. Our first experience we had Hector as a server in training. He was great , very pleasant. Our second visit we had Monica as a server in training. She also was very pleasant and did a wonderful job. Both experiences were remarkable. Both servers in training were through, knew their job ,took extra time to check on us and to guarantee our experience in your restaurant was a good one. Both are great servers and I want to say that the training you offer works if these two are products of that training. Keep up the great work!!!!!!!! To Hector and Monica , Thank You!! You both are doing a great job. Keep Smiling ..Keep loving what you do, it shows and makes us as customers , keep coming back."
Dee M.,"Vista, CA",670,814,2965,5.0,1/25/2010,"Dining Experiences: 1/15/10 and 1/16/10  For the location, prices and consistently good food, Cheesecake Factory just can't be beat. I love to visit during the evening hours for the people watching. The only downside is that the wait time is always long (as it is with most Cheesecake Factory's). The first night I ordered the Bistro Shrimp and it was delicious. Went back the next night and ordered the Opa. This was also pretty good if you are in the mood to eat healthy. If not, I definitely recommend going for the Cajun rib eye, jambalaya pasta, caramel chicken, or pizzas. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! For dessert, the winner for me is Craigs Crazy Cheesecake -half carrot cake and half cheesecake...OMG!  Don't be scared - Give it a Try!"
Heather R.,"Honolulu, HI",13,8,7,5.0,8/29/2013,Went here on our anniversary 8/12/13 and I was expecting to pay a WHOLE lot more.  First we walked in and were put on a waiting list. We didn't wait longer than 10-15 minutes. They called our name and we were taken to our table. Note that you should probably show up before lunch/dinner rush because you will most likely wait a LONG time. We arrived between 5-5:30. The only thing about the whole experience was that our table was SO close to the table next to us. I felt like I had to whisper not to bother the couple next to us but couldn't because the atmosphere was overall really loud. We ordered two main courses meals and they were FANTASTIC. We got so much food. Worth the money. Then we both got drinks as well and both ordered a cheesecake along with getting the babysitter a piece of cheesecake. I was expecting a $80-$100 bill but only paid $65! We pay that at Chilis in pearl ridge for just meals half this size & two drinks! So I thought that was a great deal. Also they validated our parking at the Royal Hawaiian so we had free parking! It was overall a fantastic experience & I plan on returning again more often!
I Crush Your Head C.,"Honolulu, HI",21,71,83,2.0,12/15/2013,Not so fast my friend. This place is lame.  Nothing fresh or local about it. Huge menu filled with mediocrity. It's better to do a few things really well than do hundreds of things half-assidly. Everyone is worse off for having eaten here. I award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul. I Crush Your Head!
Lily B.,"Mililani, HI",874,538,1986,2.0,11/20/2011,"I guess it's hit or miss with this joint... we went for dinner on Halloween (as we've been doing EVERY year with a group of friends for the last 3 years)... and although I don't mind the hour or two wait... I want my food to taste good when I get it! I USUALLY get the shrimp scampi... BUT... the last time I ate here... I ate about half of it, and then had to run to the bathroom to THROW IT UP. YES, THROW IT UP. And NO, I WASN'T pregnant. LOL. Now I can't even remember the last time I ate out in a restaurant and actually had to VOMIT in their bathroom. It's pretty damn disgusting though I must say... thank the HEAVENS I'm a nurse and I had a bunch of alcohol swabs in my purse... sniffed those in between heaving so I wouldn't faint from the bathroom smell... have I grossed you out yet? Because I haven't even gotten to the review of the food... read on if you're not gagging... We got the crab won tons to start (SUPER YUMMY)... crab meat with cream cheese filling deep fried and served with a shoyu sauce. My absolute favorite appetizer! They NEVER mess this up! Our friends got the fried mac and cheese which I took a tiny bite of (it was okay)... too heavy for me... So since you read my lovely story on how I'll never ever order my ex fave shrimp scampi... I opted to try something new. I HATE trying something new because usually I don't like it... sigh... such is life of a picky eater! Since the chicken madeira is supposedly the number one chicken dish on the menu (which is a BOOK) I opted for that paired with the steak diane... as well as garlic mashed potatoes.  Our food was out in a reasonable time... oh wait my boyfriend ordered the steak diane paired with shrimp scampi (cringe)...  His food he liked... although he ordered his steak medium rare and it came out medium WELL... after telling our waiter this he told a manager who then came by to apologize (not his fault) and state he'd get a new steak out right away... it came out fairly quickly and it was cooked perfectly (so my boyfriend says... I mean I'm all for medium... I don't like my beef as mooing as he does!) Then there's my food... so my steak diane was cooked medium and it tasted okay... nothing spectacular... but the chicken madeira was a FLAT piece of TENDER chicken which had THE FUNKIEST taste I've ever had on chicken. (((sitting here perplexed))) There was also 3 asparagus tips on top (I HATE asparagus)... which made it that much more unappealing. I gave it a bite... and well, it was BLAND, WEIRD, and I'm telling you... FUNKY is the best word to describe it. I sat there thinking how the hell this damn piece of chicken was THE most popular item on their menu?! SMH...  The garlic mash... (cough cough)... was BEYOND salty! I'm NOT a fan of salt, but this was as if they added a tablespoon of salt instead of a dash of salt... everyone at the table tried the mash and they ALL agreed it was hella salty. SIGH. The other options of starch didn't quite interest me so I played it safe with french fries to sub out.... I mean you can't get french fries wrong can you?! They came out just fine.  I was TEMPTED to send the chicken back... because it SUCKED... and it tasted FUNKY... and it looked FLAT and SAD... BUT I was so over all the food issues that I just wanted to be an 8 year old and play with my food (the chicken) as I had no interest in eating it. The waiter was conscious of me playing with it and asked how it tasted (I was honest) and he was kind enough to ask if I wanted something else but I declined... playing with the chicken kept me occupied while everyone else ate and while I waited for my dessert... FINALLY something good... fresh strawberries with the original cheesecake. Can't mess that up. And we got a red velvet cheesecake. Very dense but very delicious. And I skipped the booze and opted for a strawberry lemonade which is BOMB... so all in all... next time I might as well order my drink, won tons, and go straight to dessert! LIFE IS UNCERTAIN. Didn't I say to eat dessert first?! SMH for not following my own advice... :)"
Djama M.,"Aspen, CO",0,3,,5.0,11/1/2015,"One of the best Waikiki  experiences we had, Great service, great food, big delicious  portions,  all worth 2 hour wait. Be back  every  time god helps us to!  AMAZING  experience . Thank you"
Douglas B.,"Bryn Mawr, PA",7,1,1,1.0,2/18/2016,"So wait an hour to get a seat, I'm cool with that. Order ice tea, comes quickly, but no sugar provided, ok maybe he forgot.  Ask for lemon and sugar, ok sure, sugar arrives no lemon.  Place orders ask for lemon again, oh ok. Lemmon arrives!  A few minutes later, appetizers and entrees arrive at the same time, how quaint!  Oh but here is the best part, we finish pretty quickly, he asks if we want cheesecake, no thanks.  At this point we hadn't finished our ice tea, but the waiter was so kind to ask us if we want them to go! Really now, I've never been rushed for a table like this before, first obviously that's why all the food arrived together, but to ask if we want to have our 1/2 drunk tea put in a cup to go?  I don't think I'll be putting much time in waiting for a table here anymore"
Victoria S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,54,,4.0,12/13/2013,"The bad: Their hosts (or reception desk) suck. They underestimate wait time quite frequently and don't seem to be very organized. There's always a really big crowed of people in the waiting area which seems normal since it's a popular restaurant, but it seems like an abnormally large portion of the people crowded around that area are CF hosts. It's weird.  The good: If you have the patience to wait it out, though, the food's awesome. They have a good variety of food whether you like red meat, chicken, fish, or you want a vegan/vegetarian option. The ""Evelyn's pasta"" is awesome. I had it vegan style. The portion was large enough to fill my belly and leave me with left overs.  Finally, our waiter, Ken, was awesome. He was super accommodating to all my vegan questions. He knew the menu well and made suggestions to everyone at the table who was unsure what they wanted, and everyone seemed pretty happy with their meals."
Patrick B.,"Honolulu, HI",18,86,2,4.0,3/16/2014,Great menu   super kitchen staff We were regulars - local customers   mature people a manager Michael Mcbane when asked to help us order food to go sent us to a long long line when ask to help us direct said line was only way I said guess we should just leave he Ok with him  a super bartender Tiffany made our day and got our foo Mr McBane needs a tune up in customer service
Mildred B.,"Waimea, HI",86,6,,5.0,11/23/2015,"This restaurant, by far is my all-time favorite!!! Every time I'm on Oahu, I make sure that I come here for lunch or dinner or even just for cheesecake!  The wait is usually about 45 minutes for a table around 5ish.  I would recommend going there for lunch or an early dinner, that way you don't have to wait so long.  Still, it is so worth the wait! The menu is not your typical menu, it is a booklet.  So many things to choose from!  I recently brought my family here for the first time.  We are a family of 6 and we do have different taste; but this menu had something for everybody!!!   Customer service is on point; these people know what they're doing!  They have perfected the balance of turning tables and catering to their customer's needs.  My cell phone was dying, and our server offered to look for an outlet where I could plug my phone.  She found one near our table where I could keep an eye on it, and in the meantime, she kept checking often because she didn't want it to go missing.  We had a late lunch there, and I guess our server was just about done for the day...she briefed the next server on us, letting her know that we were enjoying our entrees and would be ordering dessert.  She then introduced us to her and went from there.  Nice, smooth transition!  Especially for a constantly busy restaurant.  These workers really know how to keep their composure under all that pressure! I was on Oahu for radiation treatment so once I was released from the hospital, I made sure to go there and order food.  I was kept on a very strict no salt/dairy/gluten diet so I ordered the sweet potato fries and guacamole, which they could prepare for me unsalted.   The choices for cheesecake are endless; I have tried the Reese's peanut butter cup, strawberry, banana cream pie, banana split, oreo and pumpkin cheesecakes.  Every single one is amazing, but my all-time favorite would definitely be the Red Velvet Cheesecake.  It is their best seller...if you haven't tried it, please do and have one for me while you're at it!!! My last experience there, I had ordered the Red Velvet Cheesecake along with the other food mentioned above and had walked back to my hotel room which was 10 minutes away only to find that my cheesecake was forgotten.  I was a bit disappointed, but the woman who was working the cheesecake station was extremely busy and their were so many people just waiting in that area for their table, plus she had about 6 more people in her line.  I had chosen to wait outside since it was so congested in there, and I should've checked my package when I had received it.  When I had called, the young woman who answered the phone apologized profusely and forwarded me to a manager, who again, apologized profusely.  I did not want the woman who took my order to get into trouble so I explained how busy she was.  Nonetheless, I was advised to go back and pick up my cheesecake.  When I got there, they apologized again and gave me what I had initially ordered, plus an extra strawberry cheesecake!  Worth having to walk their twice!!!   Anyway, if you're ever on Oahu, please go check them out!  We had an amazing family experience and will definitely be back again and again!!!"
Samantha K.,"Fort Carson, CO",4,7,10,1.0,8/10/2015,"Obviously the cheesecake is   but my service was terrible!!!! My bill was 55$ and that was charged to my account but then two days later, they charged me 80$ randomly still waiting for a refund 12 days later calling and calling isn't helping I'm about to march in there and throw a tantrum! This is unacceptable and they have lost my service for good! We won't be returning unless I'm getting cheesecake and I'm paying cash!"
Frankie R.,"Honolulu, HI",5000,302,2120,5.0,12/19/2014,"It's been a while since I last ate here.   I am glad that as soon as I checked in with the concierge,  they told me wait was going to be about 50 minutes,  but I guess to me the buzzer let me know that my table was ready and the staff was very kind to let me wait until my party arrived.   Our waitress was really on top of her game tonight by checking up on us to see how everything is going and how our food was.  She was the best and if you come, ask for Lauren, she was awesome and she really takes care of the people and I wanna say thank you for making the night the best and making sure she does a great job.  I was however,  was a little taken aback with how my chicken parmesan sandwich was presented.   I felt that the chicken was almost falling off the bread, which I was able to use a fork and eat it as well as my side order of my fries, which we were a little salty and I did ask for them unsalted.  Other than that,  my food was delicious and I will order the chicken parmesan sandwich and I hope it does stay on the bread and when I do order a extra order of fries, they will be unsalted.  But the main thing is that they did remember not to put bell peppers.   So I will totally be back again for dinner"
Rebekah L.,"Honolulu, HI",16,63,141,4.0,4/8/2012,"I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before, and with both the good and bad reviews, it's difficult to ascertain whether or not it's worth a visit. But because my family decided we'd celebrate my brother's girlfriend's birthday by going to The Cheesecake Factory, I was going to be able to form my own opinion. One thing The Cheesecake Factory is known for is their slightly ridiculous wait time. If you're expecting to eat here for dinner, do expect to be waiting atleast an hour or so before being seated. Fortunately, the lunch shift is a bit more relaxed in the sense that we'd only had to wait for fifteen minutes. After being buzzed, we had to fight our way to the reception desk where we were promptly--though midly hindered by a busboy being harangued--seated. When the waiter finally arrived, he gave us a brief introduction about the place and left to give us some time to look over the menu. What I really enjoyed about their menu is that they had a great variety of different choices that would even suit the pickiest of eaters. So even though we all had our different tastes/palates, we were all able to find something to our liking. When the waiter returned, we'd asked what their most popular appetizers were. And unfortunately, I can't recall what he'd told us, but we ended up ordering their lettuce wraps and fried calamari. If you've been to P.F. Chang's before, they too, are famous for their lettuce wraps. But in my opinion, I much preferred The Cheesecake Factory's lettuce wraps. It was just well put-together and the food combinations were delicious. The fried calamari was a real treat too as their batter was very light and crispy, almost like a mix of rice and mochiko flour.  For the main course, we ordered an angel hair pasta dish with red sauce, a skinnylicious chicken dish with asparagus, tomatoes, and onions, the bang bang chicken and shrimp, and the eggs benedict with tomatoes and spinach. All of us enjoyed our dishes except for my brother who'd ordered the bang bang. It was unfortunately, without much of a ""bang."" But other than that, everything went smoothly enough. We weren't able to try any of their cheesecakes considering we had an ice cream cake waiting at home, but maybe next time. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory was worth visiting, but I'm not sure if it's a restaurant I'd return to."
K K.,"Mililani, HI",108,22,6,3.0,1/5/2014,"This place is always a mad house when it's dinner time. Either come really early or really late if you don't want to wait 2 hours for a table.  First off our host asked if we wanted English menus.....yeah just cuz we're Japanese don't ask those kinds of questions if we're speaking to you in CLEAR English. Waitress was the best part of the night. She was on it with everything. I ordered the Chicken Marsala with mushrooms......not what I expected so I wasn't very satisfied. The sauce was on the sweet side like they added sugar to the sauce. Noodles were al dente but more on the harder side. Very disappointing after waiting 2 hours for a table. Best friend ate half of it & I ate the other half of his Steak Diane.....so good now I know what to order next time I go back for dinner.  I'm not a big cheesecake fan & I said why not try something like the Reece's peanut butter cup cheesecake, can't go wrong with peanut butter cups.....not realizing that they had 2 different peanut utter cheesecake I read the menu again.....Adams peanut butter fudge cheesecake will not disappoint a non cheesecake fan. Took one bite when I got home just to try it......I had to take another bite!!!!"
Erika R.,"Salem, OR",124,238,247,4.0,1/8/2012,"Yes, there's a long wait most of the time. No, they won't seat you unless your entire party is present and ready. But I just love their novel length menu, even though I choose one of three same dishes every time I go, Steak Diane with mashed potatoes or Chicken Parmesan sandwich or Pasta with chicken and sundried tomatoes, I love having options! And the desserts!!!! Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, Black Out Cake, or Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cheesecake!!  Wear your stretchy pants and go for it!"
Shane-Brenda M.,"Mosman, Australia",11,112,143,5.0,6/20/2015,"As always the cheesecake is wonderful, good staff great menu and delicious drinks. Whenever we come over from Maui we stop"
Brooke O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,32,,3.0,7/9/2015,"I've never been to this place, not until my niece took me a few weeks ago. Now I can say I've been twice.  The first time I went it was so packed with a long, very long line outside, it reminded me of waiting to get into a concert...it was ridiculous. As I waited for my niece to arrive I could hear people talking about the wait being at least two hours. I'm thinking it's 8p.m, by the time we sit down it will be 10p! I ain't down for supper, I want dinner. My niece is late - YAY!!  Here she comes, 830p. and it's like a movie star entering the crowd where everyone stands back to get a good look. My niece is beautiful. I tell her, ""we won't get a seat until midnight!"", she says, ""don't worry aunty, our table is ready."" She takes my hand and we walk past everyone to the very front and this lovely girl ask my niece how many, she says two and we get seated by the window...just like that. This seems to be her life tho, never waiting, always getting serviced right away.  The place is LOUD, did I say, ""LOUD!"". You can't hardly hear each other above it all and the tables are so close together we could reach over and eat from the other peoples plates. I thought about doing just that because everything looked sooo delicious. The menu is outrageous, overwhelming and kinda stupid. Why would anyone need so many choices? It's like 12 pages and maybe more and reading it is like reading a bedtime book. In the meantime the waiter keeps asking if we're ready like every five minutes when we're still on page one. It's super loud, people breathing on us from every angle, the place is dark, a menu like a long drawn out never ending book and a very large woman coughing like crazy with no effort whatsoever to cover her nasty germs flying out of her mouth...this first experience isn't really a good one thus far.  I decide on biscuits and gravy w/fried chicken, only because it's the only thing I've really ever heard people talk about and it always sounds so ono. Guess what?? Yeap, they are ""OUT"" of it, ha! So I order the fried chicken sliders w/a side of french fries and a side of mash potatoes...I don't know why, but yea, I ordered a side of mash and a hot mocha coffee. My niece orders some kind of raw fish plate. I don't do raw meats. She also orders a dip, I'm sorry, I cannot recall which one, but it was good. After dinner I order Linda's Fudge Cake and it was excellent! My entire dinner was very good, I really enjoyed it. I took home for my husband the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich which he also enjoyed even though he didn't eat it until the next evening. I especially enjoyed the molasses bread and took some of that home too, but for my dinner the next evening, hehe. As far a my nieces food, I can't really say if she liked it as she hardly likes any food and rarely ever touches it.  Would I go back? My first experience was an adventure indeed. I don't like loud places, especially while I'm out to dinner, nor do I like people right up on me, but the food was good and I love hanging out with my niece...so if she wanted to go again, yes, I'd venture out at least once more.  And...we do! ; ) which I'll write later in another review, part 2."
