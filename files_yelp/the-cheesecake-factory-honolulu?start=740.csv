Erin M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,40,8,1.0,8/2/2015,"First time here,  and it was horrible!   We waited over an hour to get a table,  our waitress had no customer service, she did not refill my daughters drink when I asked,  my food was undercooked.  When we asked to order dessert she told us to wait.   We definitely will not be coming back."
John A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,293,518,4.0,6/2/2014,Had the smokehouse BBQ burger with sweet Potato fries. Sorry no pic of the burger. ... was too hungry to pickup the phone LoL. For dessert? Original strawberry cheesecake.
Hoon L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,17,,4.0,10/15/2014,"Enjoyed a nice birthday dinner for my 8 year old. Food came out perfectly. One of the best Cobb Salad I've had in years. Great portions at a reasonable price. Very extensive menu with lots of choices. Of course many of them are at the $20+ per person price range. That's without even ordering a drink. Then again, You are in the heart of Waikiki. If you can go before the normal dinner rush, the wait isn't bad. Otherwise, expect a 30 minute to 1 hour wait! Try to make room for the desserts..."
Anna F.,"Honolulu, HI",116,292,1745,3.0,7/15/2012,"Is there a Cheesecake Factory in the US where they don't make you wait more than 30 minutes for a table? What's up with that? Their menu is awesome because they have everything. If you go with a big group, I recommend the appetizer sampler. It's super good and it will feed 6 people. I'm also a big fan of the cheesecake but I wish it was half the size. I can never finish the whole thing by myself.  If you're ever lost in Waikiki and you can't figure out what you want to eat, this is a good place. The Cheesecake Factory also has the best parking perks in the Royal Hawaiian Center. Their validation is for 2 hours and if you go past the 2 hours it's $1.00 per hour."
Cameron S.,"Honolulu, HI",221,4,,5.0,10/9/2015,It was my birthday and we got sat before the 30 minute wait time which was awesome. Our appetizer and food both came out quick and our server Jessica was seriously one of the most kind and helpful servers we've ever had (we all work in the service industry in Waikiki) and even brought me a mini ice cream sundae when we said we were too full for cheesecake. She is truly a gem! Made my birthday even more of a great day.
Andrea R.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",231,25,18,5.0,8/26/2015,Great atmosphere.. Relaxing and yet still hip. One of the best cheesecake factories I've been to which surprised me because I was expecting an ultra touristy one. Bartender was attentive almost to a fault (which is a good thing imho). Definitely worth a visit if your in Waikiki and want a guaranteed good dinner
Taylor M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,,4.0,11/3/2015,"The food was so/so...waiting for sooo long to get a table. had carbonara, first time I had it it was excellent...the second time was not so good. I like décor but not sure if i'll go back soon."
Jonathan P.,"Honolulu, HI",433,147,818,3.0,9/10/2011,"Okay I'm going to be honest with you...I'm not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I have to admit the semi-upscale chain restaurant is pretty nice, but the menu is just insane. The menu is pretty much on steroids, literally! There's just way too much choices to choose from, but hey locals and tourists alike love to have LOTS of variety. I've been to the Cheesecake factory multiple times but this past Wednesday was just ridiculous. I went with a party of 15 people (normally my party would be a table of 2)...yes I know it was partially our fault but it was crazy! We pretty much waited a little over an hour to be seated and another half an hour for our food to come out. Because of the super-sized menu, I always order something different. This time I tried the California Cheesesteak   for $12.95. The cheesesteak was flavorful and the bread/fries were hot, but what really irked me was the fact that half my cheesesteak wasn't even in my sandwich! Look at my pic! Half of it was on my plate! I was pretty salty but what made my mood lighten up was seeing my friend trying to eat her soft shell tacos  . As she tried to pick up a taco it just broke, leaving her with a taco shell that looked like a donut! The then had the same thing happen with her remaining 3 tacos forcing her to eat her tacos with a fork. What redeemed them was their delicious (semi-expensive) cheesecake. For about $8 you can get a slice of one of the many different cheesecakes they carry. The two cheesecakes I got to try was the fresh strawberry cheesecake  , and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. The fresh strawberry cheesecake was good but come on, its just cheesecake with strawberries and strawberry sauce. The tuxedo cream however was pretty amazing! If you love chocolate, this hits the spot! There's a layer of chocolate, a layer of cheesecake, and a layer of chocolate cake. Making the perfect proportion for cake, cheesecake, and chocolate in a single bite.  Two and half hours and about 5,000 calories later I still don't really like the Cheesecake factory. I haven't been here since last Halloween and who knows maybe I won't be back till next year. If you're up for an hour+ wait by all means hit up the Cheesecake Factory. Just be prepared for a super LONG WAIT, the BIG menu (hard for indecisive folks like myself), and big portions of so-so food. But if you just want good cheesecake just get your cheesecake to go!"
Aubry A.,"Waipahu, HI",95,98,59,5.0,5/3/2015,"Very crowded, but good food!! We thought it was going to be a long one hour wait, but it turned out to 30 minutes. Our waiter was very friendly and the food was delicious. If you're really looking for a place to eat that fills you up quick, this is the place. The serving is big for a decent price. I had chicken marsala and my boyfriend had the chicken farfalle. Just a warning, I tried the chicken farfalle and it's VERY garlicky! Everything is good here! Definitely coming back"
Karen D.,"Puyallup, WA",839,365,1354,4.0,9/22/2011,"I've been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory from way back. No matter what location I've eaten at, the food and of course, the desserts, are always great! Eating here is an adventure. First, you have to be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait. We've experienced wait times varying from 45-90 minutes. Needless to say, we try to come during off-peak times, but even then the restaurant is completely full. Despite the constant crowds, we've always experienced excellent service here, which is saying something. Cheesecake Factory restaurants look the same no matter where you are. They're upscale casual and gaudy. The noise level of the Waikiki location depends a lot on where you're seated and when you dine since they have live music in the lanai/bar area on weekend evenings. (The music is amplified, so the volume is to the point that you can't talk over it.) Basically, you have ""very loud"" and ""over the top loud."" My favorite place to sit is the back room, which opens out onto the Royal Hawaiian Hotel terrace. The winner here is food and service. Everything I've tried from the menu (and I've tried many things) has been good. Portion sizes are huge, so I always take home leftovers. Ditto for the desserts, which are definitely big enough to share. Since you're essentially getting two meals in terms of portion size, it is reflected in the price--The Cheesecake Factory isn't cheap. The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Royal Hawaiian Center, Building C, ground floor. Park in the on-site garage and have them validate. When parking, be sure to pull into the ""guest"" parking and not the hotel parking! They are open for lunch and dinner every day plus Sunday brunch. Hours are Mon-Thu 11am-11:30pm; Fri-Sat 11am-12am; Sun 10am-11pm. Yelp 365 Challenge #54"
Tamra P.,"Honolulu, HI",823,552,1,4.0,10/10/2011,"I probably like this place even more because it seems like it is impossible to get seated right away, and it's in Waikiki so I don't come here often.  Oh the irony! Wait this time wasn't too long - 10 or 15 minutes. They removed the calorie counts on the cheesecakes in the glass counter up front - hallelujah!  The last thing I want to see is that dessert alone could run you 1200 calories!  Apparently someone realized ""ignorance is bliss"".  Their cheesecakes are amazing, though.   Yes, it's a chain however their service has always been attentive, professional, and friendly when I've been here.  On my most recent visit with Emi H. they were very child friendly - even brought out a cut up banana with the bread so we could keep Isabel happy.  The portions are monster sized, so we shared a thai pasta (regular, not lunch sized) and still had leftovers.  The table bread is delicious.   Bathrooms are also clean and very nice.  They do validate parking in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, so it really is a viable option for lunch and not quite the hassle I often perceive it to be."
Kristin L.,"Kaka'ako, Honolulu, HI",53,14,20,1.0,5/13/2015,"Okay so I have been to this Cheesecake Factory a bunch of times over like 6 years and it's never been amazing, but still good. This time though not only did our waiter not acknowledge our friends birthday but my other friend has a gluten allergy and 99% sure they served her gluten when she asked for it gluten free. What if she had celiacs disease?! She would be in the hospital right now. She's in so much pain and so uncomfortable we had to go home instead of celebrating our friends birthday. I can't believe that such a well known restaurant would let this slip. This is so outrageous! My friend is really courteous and wouldn't let me say anything at the restaurant, but I wish I could have because this is not cool. Like seriously you can get shut down for this kind of stuff!"
Chey F.,"Wichita, KS",1,10,3,3.0,9/26/2015,"The service was good, especially for how crowded it was. Our food came out exactly as ordered and within an appropriate time. We got the avocado rolls for an appetizer and they were awesome! Of course all of the cheesecake we had for dessert was some of the best we'd ever tried, and huge! One piece is honestly good for two to three people. The entree was soso. We both got the Diane and Salmon. The potatoes and broccoli were done well, as was the steak (though over-cooked). The salmon was unexpectedly awful though. :( Instead of herb-crusted and flavorful, the fish was tasteless and covered in a soggy goo of a mess (cream and herbs?)."
Jared W.,"Honolulu, HI",292,113,371,4.0,10/13/2011,"This place is always busy!! When we got there it was packed.  The wait was for 50 minutes, but within 15 minutes a nice person named Tommy gave us his buzzer that was going off.  He also had a group of four people but he already had seats.  Amazing!! I been here a couple times before and the service is usually pretty good.  The host are always very busy giving out buzzers and figuring out how to seat people. The food is good and the portions are big.  I like coming here with a group of people to try different appetizers. Here are some things we ordered.... Crispy Wontons ( ) This is a good Appetizer!  It is made of a Crab and mayo mixture inside the Wonton good crispy light not like deep fried soft rich  Guacamole ( ) I really like the chips that come along with the Guacamole!!  If you like avocado you will like this!!  I liked it! Bistro Shrimp Pasta- ( ) It was tasty!! but too much pasta for me! The free bread was also good too! ( )  The brown bread is delicious! I know I will eventually come back, but it is important to think of a backup choice when coming here... just incase the wait time is 2 hours!"
Connie M.,"Honolulu, HI",71,417,3826,2.0,1/7/2012,"Service was extremely slow. I was there on a weekday afternoon. I was seated immediately going in, but once I got my table that's when the trouble started. The waiter took forever to take our orders (remember, it was not a busy day) then the bread, water and our pasta dishes all came out at the same time. I find that to be unacceptable even if it's a chain restaurant."
Charlie W.,"Manly, Australia",0,3,,5.0,8/12/2015,"Food is very nice and served in large quantities.  My wife and I went there three time during our 10 day trip to Hawaii, he food is just so good"
Lei N.,"Aiea, HI",360,416,142,3.0,9/19/2013,"For our last meal together and after Jeremy looked through my bookmarks we ate here. We parked at the Royal Hawaiian Center and walked from that end to the other. It already looked busy walking in but they hostess at the front said the wait would be about 10 minutes which it was. Not much sitting room while you wait so we stood on the side and looked through their menus since it was my first time and I wanted to know what they had. Of course I picked up the Korean version. Once our buzzer went off, we headed to the front and waited for someone to escort us to our seats. I would have preferred a table outdoors where it would be warmer, but later on during our meal someone got attacked by a bird! Anyways, our waitress was a bit awkward. She offered us bread. They have the same bread at Cattle Company, so we enjoyed that. The other one, not so much, though the inside was soft and fluffy. I decided on the mushroom burger, no onions ( ).There was another burger that had mushrooms, but this one had cheese! Good thing we had bread to munch on because it took a while for our dishes to come. The elderly coupe besides us talked to us once in a while.  They were friendly, we hoped we gave the same impression in return. I had to cut my burger in half so I could eat it without it getting messy. I wasn't provided a knife so I borrowed Jeremy's. It still was difficult to eat anyway and I didn't even finish it. Their fries were good, still hot when it got out to us. Originally we were going to have separate cheesecakes but after thinking it through we decided to share one. We ordered the Reese's pieces chocolate cheesecake ( ). It's actually two cheesecakes together. It was alright. I didn't enjoy the nuts and after a couple of bites I was already tired of it, so was Jeremy. That's not something I would order again, even if I shared with someone. Sometimes to get our waitress' attention, he'd raise his hand. Ha."
Dale S.,"Martensville, Canada",0,6,,4.0,5/16/2016,Visited for the first time yesterday and we had to go back today. We were seated within 10 minutes both times and had really good meals. Dessert was great. Collin and Kenny were both very efficient and polite.
Jarod H.,"Honolulu, HI",285,239,5988,5.0,10/12/2013,"Five stars. I like it here. The activity going on, the atmosphere, the food, just an overall enjoyable experience! The sirloin steak that I had reminded me of Kauai's JJ Broiler old Slavonic Steak. The butter garlic flavor grilled to perfection. I really enjoy the brownie sundae too. Excellent!"
Micheal B.,"Honolulu, HI",2,19,,4.0,4/4/2016,"Went here a week ago, great place to bring the family because it is already loud. The food is good in my children's mind so that's all I really cared about. Overall it was a pretty cheap bill."
