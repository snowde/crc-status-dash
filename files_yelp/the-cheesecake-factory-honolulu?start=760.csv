Tracy N.,"Tempe, AZ",9,22,8,4.0,5/10/2015,"I've been here three times in total and have had a great experience every time. Naturally, there is a wait but it really isn't too bad. It's always packed, as the restaurant is located right on the Waikiki strip but the food is great and the service is pretty fantastic considering the high volume of customers coming in and out of the place."
Vince M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,3,4.0,6/23/2015,Food was wonderful! Had the Ono whitefish with miso sauce and it was superb! The cheesecake selection is to die for! The only downside is the wait time especially on Holidays. Been here several times since we've vacationed in Oahu and it will be a family tradition to visit each time.
Paul R.,"Honolulu, HI",49,111,121,4.0,10/16/2013,"I don't frequent this place too often, but I always enjoy it!! There is always a wait.. ALWAYS! But its right next to the beach, and even though they say the pagers won't reach that far, they do!! So do a little shopping or relax by the beach til its your turn.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and puts out a really good feel. I'm always really comfortable in there. The menu has a modest selection, and everything I've tried, I've enjoyed. And then its dessert time!!! So many delicious cheesecakes to choose from. You can't go wrong!"
Celine N.,"Honolulu, HI",4,63,14,1.0,4/20/2015,Really disappointed in the service and pasta. My pasta was half cooked and the lady who helped me gave me attitude also my food almost took an hour because they messed up my order! Never coming here again.
Jas A.,"Honolulu, HI",174,95,22,3.0,1/7/2014,"Happy Birthday to me! The food was yummy and so were the drinks.  The part that got to me was definitely the wait.  I am pretty sure we waited over an hour, and we came early!  We ended up eating at the bar on the high table and it was fine.  We had a margarita and shared some apps.  I would go back but probably not if I had to wait that long again."
Jessica S.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,15,32,5.0,11/16/2013,"DELICIOUS!!!! My family and I eat at The Cheesecake Factory where we live and there is ALWAYS a wait no matter which time or location you go to, but this wait was WORTH IT!  We put our name in and had an hour and a half wait so we shopped for about an hour went back checked our name and had about a 5 minute wait from there. Our waitress was ON TOP OF IT! We never had to ask for a refill, she was friendly, she gave us bread as soon as it was running low, and our food was delicious! I defiantly recommend going about an hour or two before you want to eat and put your name in and then do some shopping while you wait!"
Harriet O.,"Fresno, CA",2,12,3,3.0,7/21/2014,"Food was consistent with the rest of the chain. We had a large party and the manager immediately introduced himself and gave us our seating options. We were sat quickly and in a beautiful area of the restaurant, near the fountain in the back with a garden view. Service (server) was great and gave us insider tips about visiting Oahu which was nice.  What the manager didn't know was that my dad is a veteran and was meeting his military buddy that he had not seen since the 1960's. It was an important night. Like I said, service was great (our main server), they were busy...drinks (not necessarily brought by server) were quite slow, but other than that - good.  However - the manager, initially friendly, was overheard by a member of our party (as they were heading to the restroom near the host station), ""They've been here for 2 hours, hopefully they'll be leaving soon."" After this was said, he walked to our table and took our silverware and napkins away, stating, ""Just helping clean up here!"" Then came back a few minutes later to stand against the wall near our table (about 6-8 ft. away) and stared at us, until we basically felt pressured to leave. The funny thing was, a lot of that time was spent waiting for drinks, salads, dinner and dessert. We weren't there long after the service was complete. Everyone in our party was trying not to rush my dad and his friend's reunion. Maybe I should have said something to the manager, I know he was just doing his job... It was a little disconcerting, it seemed that the focus was on numbers and not customer service.  Just a tip - it's loud in there, but customers can still hear what you're saying in your headset, Philadelphia!"
Christian And Chanel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,52,42,3.0,3/31/2014,"We've been here a couple times. The food is great and the portions are huge. The service is alright, nothing amazing but nothing horrible either.  Just don't come during dinner time on a weekend unless you're willing to wait 45min - 1.5 hrs   But before 5pm they have ""lunch specials"" which is basically all their classic menu items but in smaller portions and reduced prices."
Keahi R.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",76,63,88,5.0,11/21/2013,"I have to say, ""now I see why everyone is waiting forever outside"". It's totally worth the wait.. Drinks and dinner was exceptional or maybe I just ordered to right things.. So full there was no room for cheesecake, perhaps next time. I highly recommend, the wait is worth it and besides there are a lot worse places to wait in the world than right on the strip in Waikiki.."
Vange B.,"San Mateo, CA",1,50,4,4.0,4/15/2016,"from 4/1/16 we can always count of cheesecake factory on vacation (waikiki, palm springs) you pretty much will get what you had before bit of a wait, kinda dark at your table, but food satisfies calamari, vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, sheila's chicken and avocado salad (share family style because it's huge)"
Kelly G.,"Santa Clara, CA",318,1356,191,4.0,9/18/2011,"I just rolled home from the Cheesecake Factory. Yes.....rolled.....because there was just SO much food in each portion! Prices are a little high, but we came home with enough leftovers for another 2 meals. Bargain if you ask me.  Parking is validated at the Royal Hawaii Hotel, 1st hour is free and $1 per hour for another 3 hours.  On a Sunday morning, 11am, we were seated relatively quick. Service was kind of slow after that. Our waiter offered bread, which we accepted but it came out after our appetizer reached our table.  The menu is extensive, and I mean longer than an OCD making a list of things to do. They have 2 pages of appetizers, just as many for their specialties, pizzas, burgers, pastas, steaks, mexican, seafood, salad and of course drinks and dessert -  you name it they probably got it.  Drink wise, I splurge and order their Peach Bellini ($9.50) Expensive, but heck, how often do I actually make it out to Cheescake Factory? Apparently only once every 1.5 years. So... For appetizers though, I always enjoy their Avocado Eggroll. Its delightfully fatty from the avocado, yet light and with a nice plum sauce. Today we ordered their spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips. Heavy on the cheese and cream, lots of big chunks of artichoke in the dip.  Came with a side of sour cream and salsa. The salsa was yum, quite possibly more yum than the dip itself.  For entries, I typically get a salad. My bffs love their jambalaya. Today I ordered their lunch sized chicken piccata with angel hair pasta. Slight sour edge but creamy and yum! The bf got a mac & cheese burger. The patty itself was a nice medium, pink but not bloody, tender and flavorful.  We ended with a Tuxedo Cheesecake - chocolate chocolate and then a layer of vanilla marscapone to help cut the richness of the chocolate counterparts. The whipped cream is nice and I could eat that all day instead.  Total for the Peach bellini, a cold apple cider, spinach and artichoke dip, lunch sized chicken piccata, a mac & cheese burger and a tuxedo cheesecake came out to around $60.  Expensive for my tastes, but again, getting almost 2 more meals out of the deal!"
A M.,"Honolulu, HI",1,22,,1.0,7/18/2016,"This place is revolting. Some visitors from the mainland wanted to have dinner here. 2 hour wait. Was finally called to be seated, and the restaurant was packed like sardines with people. It was incredible. Then we are finally seated and it just felt very unclean and gross. But, I get it, it's a tourist trap and it's a busy place. There was an a/c vent located above us at our table that constantly dripped with water on our heads and table, but you're so grateful to have a table after such a long wait, you'll deal. Then the food...oh so gross. Truly. I get that it's a chain etc., but it is truly disgusting. Now I know why it is so dimly lit in there. Wow is it gross. And the best part is... **You will spend the next day on the toilet. All day.** Save yourself the time and money. I would rather eat McDonald's ( which I haven't had in years) and sit on the beach. Do yourself and your stomach/ass a favor and find someplace, anyplace else, to eat than this crowded, hot, drippy, dark, hell hole. P.s. You really DO feel like you're in hell if it's at night. It's hot and dark and PACKED with exhausted, miserable, hungry tourists. All the tiki torches around you create the perfect 'hell like' ambiance. ;)"
Ryan R.,"Honolulu, HI",77,20,1,4.0,6/5/2015,"Amazing service, food, and environment. Is all that needs to be said, if you don't agree , try it for your self"
Joshua B.,"Marine Corps Base Hawaii, HI",0,2,2,5.0,7/11/2015,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory on a Friday evening, and it was packed to say the least with a waiting list 135 names long. The wait was a little under a hour which was understandable. Once seated the service was superb, the waiter was great at making sure we never went thirsty, the appetizers came out quickly and tasted great. The main course took a little bit longer  which was expected due to the volume of customers. The managers came by to apologize and ensure our meals came shortly after that. Overall had a great experience and there's plenty of stores around to go in while you wait. Highly recommended...if you have the time ! and they Validate parking !"
Tif-funny T.,"San Bernardino, CA",40,120,118,5.0,4/19/2014,"The wait can be long, but for my girlfriend  and I, it has always been worth it.  We have had the steak and it has always been cooked perfectly, I've also had the fettuccine Alfredo which is always delicious, and just recently had a cheeseburger and hands down one of the best burgers I've had. It's sooo juicy.  Sits in the heart if waikiki we usually park in the structure right before the Sheraton get our card validated at the cheesecake factory, if the wait isn't too long you won't have to pay for parking, if it is you will probably have to pay for parking.  If you haven't tried the cheesecakefactory this is a def must try."
Kit H.,"Reisterstown, MD",169,161,306,3.0,6/3/2011,"Uniformity.  Chains tout their unwavering uniformity of product. I dared test Cheesecake Factory's uniformity of product by ordering their Chicken and Biscuits in Waikiki to compare it to the Chicken and Biscuits I tried many moons ago at Cheesecake Factory in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.  My official report: Both Baltimore's Inner Harbor locale and Waikiki's locale serve their Chicken and Biscuits with bite for bite exacting uniformity. Mission accomplished.  Both locales - then & now - served it listless, pasty, and bland. Baltimore wasn't a fluke. This is the standard. No bang for my buck in this dish.  My Specialty Drinks were enjoyable. Strong. Tasty. Nicely garnished. Presented well. Mixed with love. Yes. I'd say the new bartender's coming along swimmingly. My Spinach and Cheese Dip appetizer with it's hot, gooey goodness and crisp tortilla chips was nice.  And I compliment this Cheesecake Factory's vibrant vibe and upbeat atmosphere.  So, come on down. Do a decadent dessert. Have a Specialty Drink or four. Carouse with their namesake cheesecakes. Wallow in the wonderful open-air frontage and people watch as touristy hordes frolic to and fro on Kalakaua Av. Or ogle the tourists sitting at the table next to you. Succumb to your server's beaming bright smile & pretty profile as she waits on you with aplomb.  Just don't get the Chicken and Biscuits. Your taste buds deserve better.  Uniformity.  It ain't always as good as it's touted to be."
Yosapon T.,"Honolulu, HI",202,130,228,4.0,6/18/2012,"Pretty good place to eat in waikiki !!! with dozen of menu to decide ~~~ I love the food normally we just go according to whatever the waiter or waitress say because they know most.... try to avoid Asian menu entree they are not that good... but we always order the luau salad which is amazing !! chicken bellago was good too !!!  What else most of there food is good haahahha ! I like there complimentary bread (chocolate one was gooooood) The only let down about this place is the crazy long waiting line to get a table sometime it is right away whereas others can go 1 hour, 2 hours and even 4 hours for 10 people !!!  8 times i been there was super good but still i never get to try there cheesecake ~~~"
Jen K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,21,,5.0,4/30/2016,Everytime my husband and I go there the food is great. Try the Salmon and Kale Salad and Renee's Special. Very consistent and they give you free refills on drinks.
Diana C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,36,60,4.0,7/1/2014,They are always busy but service is better than other Waikiki restaurants.  We had a little miss-communication with order but the manager took care of right away and he is so nice and professional!!!  He is a great manager!!
Marvin S.,"San Diego, CA",689,491,1260,4.0,7/4/2011,"What made this place special to me? This was the first place my wife Krystle and I got to eat together since January when I left on deployment. For that, I love that we got a chance to come here and that Cheesecake Factory is one of our favorite places to eat for our special occasions. You already know about Cheesecake Factory. The huge menu. The ridiculous variety of cheesecake. Consistently good food. The prices. lol Our meal this time consisted of a turkey burger and bacon cheeseburger. Both were AMAZING. What wasn't amazing? The WAIT. It sucked. We waited for over an hour to eat. I know its Waikiki and trust me, as I just completed over 10 reviews today, I chalk it up as me being in Hawaii and how the prices are more expensive because of Hawaii. There was a little annoying condensation from the ac units dripping on his from the ceiling. It wasn't too bad, but it was there. Customer service was great and our server was very attentive to us. Would we come back? Yes. Why? Because it's freakin Cheesecake Factory! If we needed to eat because our life depended on it? No. The wait is crazy and there are probably tons of places to go eat. However, I would say none of which has the extensive menu as Cheesecake Factory. We didn't save room for the cheesecake, which was unfortunate. I don't know about parking because we were parked at the Hyatt, where we stayed at during our stay in Waikiki."
