Jeremy K.,"Bothell, WA",42,32,6,4.0,4/25/2015,"Although we have a cheesecake factory at home, the quality was still high, prices reasonable at $14-$18 each.  Was had 3 main course salads and 2 kids meals, 2 beers and paid $100 including tip.  The Ahi Tuna was excellent and the salads were huge.  Consistent food and good quality.  The only negative is that they took 5min longer getting our 2 kids their food."
Emily E.,"Dallas, TX",52,22,2,4.0,11/29/2013,"Their cheesecake is amazing! And so many kinds to choose from. Personally I think their regular food is overpriced and nothing super special. One time I had a really rude waitress but the other times the staff had been great.  Now when we go, we just wait in line to buy the cheesecake to go. The line is much shorter than waiting for a table, and you can eat the cheesecake in the mall or other dining area nearby."
James W.,"Aledo, TX",0,19,10,4.0,8/5/2015,"Excellent food as usual from my other experiences on the mainland... Service wasn't impressive at all, but given the cost of food in Waikiki, this place is still your best bet for variety, and quality. If we did this 6 day trip over again, we'd come here almost every day. Other restaurants here are for the most part disappointing. Im sure pf changs and ruths chris is good too as usual, but as far as other local spots, prepare to be disappointed and pay out the nose. If you want to avoid an hour to hour and a half wait, get there early, like around 5pm. The line was a mile long when we left. Wait had to have been over 2 hours. Anyhow, service hasnt blown me away anywhere in waikiki, but the food is awesome here... And for the price, it cant be beat."
Kevin N.,"Honolulu, HI",12,38,35,4.0,2/25/2014,"I came here once with a party of 10.  Be sure to go in and make a reservation.  I don't think they accept reservations off the phone.  They are always packed.  Expect to wait an hour for a table.  Honestly, the whole meal took an hour so I see why the wait is so long.   So our party was split up into 5 and 5.  Two separate tables.  For my table, we ended up ordering all of the appetizers.  That alone was enough to fill up five people, maybe more, since we were ""the guy"" table.  All of the appetizers were terrific, I would give it 4/5 stars.   The Cheesecake was delicious! I mean, it is their specialty!  I ordered the Oreo Cheesecake, and the Godiva Cheesecake.  I recommend getting the Oreo Cheesecake.  The Godiva Cheesecake is only recommended for people who love double chocolate.   Cheesecakes: 5/5 for taste 5/5 for presentation"
Gabriel T.,"Aiea, HI",458,994,1262,3.0,10/6/2014,"Aight so coming here recently just reminded me why I don't come here often.  I feel that the only thing that makes the whole thing worth the trip, time, and dine is da damn cheesecake for real.  Aight so I came here recently for my friend's birthday celebration dinner along with other friends and mutual friends.  Since they don't do reservations, we came here early on a Saturday night to put in our name.  We put in our name a little before 5PM and didn't get seated till like about 6:30PM.  That is going to give you an idea of how long the wait is going to be especially on a Saturday night in Waikiki.  Also our party was about 14 or so strong so not sure if they played a factor into it but I think it probably did.  In regards to the waiting game, the Cheesecake Factory could at least serve and provide free Wifi because you know everyone will be on their phones while waiting and stuff.  My friends and I tried looking it up but no luck.  When we came in, we got sat all the way near the back area past the kitchens and nearby the second bar area.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating of us for a large party.  It was about 2 hours to 2.5 hours in before we got some food in our stomachs.  I ordered the blueberry mojito which was pretty good.  It's very blueberry and sweet.  For my dinner meal, I got Elena's favorite pasta (upon request) which was ok.  I was kinda dry but it was aight I guess.  What made everything worth it was the cheesecake for dessert! I got the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake which is my all time favorite.  I really goes well with the blueberry mojito I must say.  Our whole time spent there was about 4 hours total.  We got out right around 9:30PM.  Some side notes, in regards to location, you can't really miss Cheesecake Factory, there will always be people waiting around the restaurant and it's within the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Plaza area.  They really have the ambiance set low when dining in especially at night, you will need a flashlight to browse through the menu.  I don't like how they don't have prices listed specifically for certain things like the individual cocktails and cheesecakes.  Coming into here reminds me of Liliha Bakery, you also have to wait and there's always a crowd for cheesecake."
Peter L.,"Auckland, New Zealand",3,12,3,1.0,8/1/2015,Pretty average food and pretty average service sums up our experience at this highly recommended restaurant. We were given an electronic token to summonses us when our table was ready which actually was pretty cool. Once we were seated I understood the reason why it is called a factory. Shallow them up and spit them out. My meal was not fully cooked and my wife's was smothered in cream it killed any flavour. The waiting staff were hard to call as they were frantic with the number of diners. The portions were huge but lacked flavour. Sorry to say but we were disappointed.
Sheila K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,20,,5.0,7/31/2015,"Can't beat the selection of food items at this place. So glad we have one on the island. Everything I've eaten from this menu has tasted great. Chicken madeira, hibachi steak, kale salad, avocado egg rolls, pizza: all YUM. Cheesecake even more delicious, if that is even possible. I'm especially impressed with the service. Went here recently for a friend's birthday, and our server was incredibly patient with our large party."
Emma K.,"Honolulu, HI",97,71,250,4.0,9/27/2013,"Food and drinks are really good. A little pricey for drinks but the atmosphere is great and it is Waikiki, so expect big places like this to overcharge. It is however,  a little dark inside. Especially at night. I'm all for mood lighting, but when I can't really see my food...uuuhh maybe the setting is set too low.  Love the long island ice teas! Love the pumpkin cheesecake (only seasonal) and without the extra cream on top. I find that a little greasy. Otherwise, great place to go if you're in Waiks. They don't take reservations, so for dinner you may have to wait half an hour to an hour depending on the size of your group. I recommend putting in your names, then go shop at Forever 21! LOL! Or walk around that shopping area because there are some nice shops."
Megan I.,"Honolulu, HI",114,11,9,5.0,4/14/2015,"Awesome!!! Awesome!!! Awesome!!! This was my boyfriend and I first time eating here. Our waiter name was Blake. He was so Awesome. He recommend items to us, helped us through it and awesome customer service. Appetizer we got the Avocado eggroll. Entrees: lingerian pesto and everything pizza. Dessert we got the tiramisu cheesecake. The kitchen messed up on our pizza but it was still awesome. We also got the pizza free. All of it was awesome. Im so coming here to eat again. Thank you Blake for my experience at cheesecake factory. Smooches"
Amy G.,"Honolulu, HI",221,235,48,4.0,5/23/2013,"I have to say that Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite chains and place to dine in Hawaii. Yes, the wait can be a major pain in the rear, BUT the food is actually good. I've never had a bad experience here except for once when i think the jalapeno's had gone bad and well, you know the rest of the story.  I last came here with a party of 30 at 4:30 and the wait was only an hour long but, had to wait an extra hour because they gave the table away due to the fact that my party hadn't arrived. But I must say that they tried their best and I know was frustrated with my group.  anyways, the pasta's are always cooked and seasoned well and I never have a problem with them like other chain restaurants that specialize in pasta which i shall not name.  Service here is very decent. and the food good. It may be pricey but the portions are huge so its great for sharing which if you do, or take home, the price for the portion you get is really good!"
Beth I.,"Honolulu, HI",417,348,767,5.0,5/16/2011,"This particular Friday night really was as good as it gets for dining out in Waikiki.  It was about 930ish and there is always a wait time, but it was only suggested to be 15min.  It was my chance to check out Forever 21 next door (which is gigantic BTW).  5 minutes into my adventure in clothes heaven, our buzzer went off.  We were surprised that it was sooner than we expected! I was actually a little disappointed that I didn't have more time to look around!  My wallet stayed happy though. We were escorted by a very friendly greeter and led to our table on the diamond head end of the restuarant where there is live music.  Sounds obvious that a greeter should ""greet"" you, but some restaurants have the worst seater/greeters. Not so at CF. Smiles all around and small talk as they seat you.  We had a prime spot to view the entertainersat our table.  They are top notch and I'm convinced I'd like them to play at my wedding someday.  Very mellow classic Hawaiian and popular songs and not overpowering the conversation. Our server came along and told us the specials and brought us our drinks (pineapple mojito and ultimate margarita) and warm bread.  My favorite is the rye bread and I could sit there noshing on it all night.  So delicious. We ordered the ahi carppaccio which was by far the best I've ever had.  I really appreciate all the innovation that CF puts into their dishes.  They have quite a few traditional dishes, however, the presentation and flavor is a cut above. We were oohing and ahhing over the food that was ordered by other tables.  Gorgeous! The carppaccio looked nothing like we are used to and that was a VERY good thing.  It was two thinly sliced pieces of fresh ahi the size of the whole plate.  It was drizzled with the spicy mayo and aioli, green onions, avocado and pureed jalapeno and served with a ponzu dipping sauce and namasu on the side.  It was fabulous.  (see the pic posted) We also ordered one entree of the mac nut crusted ono with stir fried veggies.  The two generous pieces of fish were very moist and tender and served with a delicious sauce (can't remember if it was white wine or something else).  It was about $24, but worth every bite and should be shared by two if you are ordering apps. The part that really sealed this million dollar deal was the service.  It was friendly, efficient, and professional.  I was also very impressed at the way the servers work so well together to make their work even more efficient.  Some restaurants have servers that don't look like they even know eachother, but at CF, they even help to bring out the food and clear tables for eachother.  They have got efficiency down to a science.  Everyone seems to be working toward the same goal... happy customers. CF was a total two thumbs up experience.  I'm so glad we didn't go to our usual haunts and ventured out to waikiki for late night bites.  I can't wait to go back and this time I'll save room (like not eat for a whole day) to have cheesecake. P.S. This isn't the cheapest place to eat if you're on a budget.  It came out to just below $100 for 4 (alcoholic) drinks the fish entree, and the carppaccio appetizer.  The drinks are where they get you.  They don't have prices on the menu and it will cost you between $10-14 each.  BUT, the entrees are large and can be shared if you order a salad or apps and I'm completely all for paying a bit more to get top notch service, food quality and entertainment."
Charles M.,"Aiea, HI",0,1,,2.0,3/28/2016,"I always look forward dining at this place , my family just love to eat here. This weekend we brought some friends from the mainland, we ordered food that everyone enjoyed and was served on a timely manner , after we're all done and it's time to pay for the bill, our waitress Tammy rudely dropped all our take out food on the table and just left us wondering why? We keeps looking for her and ask why ? Then finally she swung by at our table , after few times asking her why , she finally answered and said "" she's frustrated and nothing personal "" but then we asked her why she's frustrated , she replied "" she's frustrated because she doesn't deserve the tip she was getting but even with the behavior and smart ass attitude we generously add more to   what she was given the first time. We thought everything was ok , she was still giving attitude walking in front of us , we decided to talk to the manager and report it how she was to us , we explained what happened to the manager and he was politely apologizing to us , he offered us free desserts but we turned him down , then he offered us gift cards but we said no, but he still came back with those gift cards , we're not after getting compensated with free stuff and was concern more on the waitress behavior.  The important thing I learned about this whole experience is to avoid this waitress , Tammy only work for tips , and the bad thing about this waitress , after the manager confronted her, she turn around and lied and told the manager we are bad customers . Before we walk out the door , we decided to give her the free gift cards and our take home food , thought she need it more than we do. So, if you happens to go and dine there please avoid "" Tammy with the Tummy "" to be your server/waitress."
Cecilè C.,"Los Angeles, CA",290,236,688,3.0,11/30/2013,"Of course packed as usual, not the typical menu I am accustomed to.  Service was good, decided to have the crusted chicken pasta, (why) I forget the breaded chicken gets a bit mushy after sitting on the hot pasta. I enjoyed the buzzing atmosphere here in Waikiki, nice friendly people, but the only problem I had was my ""hot"" bread came shortly after my meal arrived which was a bummer.  The olive oil seemed the same but the balsamic vinaigrette was much different but taste very good. Overall I had a nice dinner, should've tried something a bit different being the menu was deserving but just chicken (lol) out and decided to be bland."
Lisa V.,"Melbourne, Australia",0,9,,4.0,7/23/2015,"After an hours wait finally got a seat. Service was decent, although could be better. Got seated on a seat that was wet and therefore wet my outfit, it was cleaned promptly when I told them but there wasn't much apology. The floor was left wet. Kids bread and banana plate was a nice touch. Meals were decent, very large and tasty. I had thr shrimp and angel hair pasta.. Only came with 5 shrimps with a large plate of pasta and lots of tomato's. Hubby's steak was ok but nothing to write home about. Would come. Back if it didn't require a 1hr wait. Live music was a good touch."
Hohoho B.,"Aiea, HI",64,73,19,2.0,12/22/2013,"This is just one person's opinion, but the place suuuuure didn't live up to the hype. We went for dinner and timed it perfectly, pretty much only waited about 5 minutes then as we sat there I could see the line getting longer and longer and longer. Crazy.   We started our meal with the ahi poke...now that was good but expensive.  It came layered with fried won ton pi and the sauce was really tasty, the perfect amount of kick to it.  It had a small tossed salad on the side which was great because the poke was maybe only a 1/4 pound serving.  Too little for the price (around $15) and waaay too little for 3 people. I would have just ordered another poke for myself if it wasn't so expensive. Price not listed on the menu which means if you gotta ask how much you prolly can't afford it.  LOL Anyways, I opted for the chopped salad entree which would have been perfect had it not been for pieces of corn....yuck.  I like corn but I think it should be popped, or stay on the cob, not put in a tossed green salad.  So I actually sat there and picked it out. Others in my party had a rib eye steak which was pretty good sized and tasted ok.  The other entree that was ordered was Chicken Bellagio which was a pasta dish with a  bunch of cilantro on top.  Ok if you like it. We also had drinks which may be why our bill was high, the cocktail menu also don't have prices on it....remember: if you gotta ask how much...... I would totally recommend the cheesecakes pricey but huge and tasty.  I would go back only for cheesecake so at least they have a side counter for that so no need to wait in that loooong ass line."
Gracie T.,"Fort Carson, CO",54,29,31,1.0,11/29/2014,Slow and not worth the wait. An hour and a half of waiting and they put a family of 5 in a small ass both after assigning us to a wrong both first. Never had a problem before. Come before 5 if  you want to enjoy your meal and not wait for nothing.
Kyla A.,"Honolulu, HI",3,8,110,3.0,4/7/2015,"Can we have some smile on our server's face, please? We're customers after all. We are not pests or inanimate objects without emotions. This is why those two stars are taken away."
Rena M.,"Kapolei, HI",134,10,,5.0,11/25/2013,"The food at The Cheesecake Factory is ALWAYS going to be worth paying and waiting for! My fiancé and I always eat there on special occasions (birthdays, anniversary, etc.) and sometimes just to eat when we're in the Waikiki area.  The service is always good, but it depends who you have.  The cheesecake is so top-notch, since it's homemade, and there is a variety to choose from! Even though the drive is far and the wait is long, it is really worth it!  That's why it's always going to be my all-time favorite restaurant!!"
Drew F.,"Honolulu, HI",0,8,6,4.0,3/25/2016,Finally a great experience at cheese cake factory Waikiki . What made it great was the server Santana. His explanation of foods and reccomendations were on point miso salmon and shrimp jambalaya . Past  time there were not enjoyable and fish tacos were terrible
Rachel Ann D.,"Waipahu, HI",146,6,9,5.0,5/1/2015,"I loooooove The Cheesecake Factory! The food, the workers, everything! I come here rarely because it's in Waikiki and I try to avoid Waikiki because of how crowded it can be. However, this place is worth the trip. The last time I came was last night for my two coworkers birthday. I didn't get our servers name but he was so nice! He helped us and made sure we were taken care of. We told him to keep our checks as one and that we'll figure a way to split the tab, but he went out of his way to just split our checks and help us in the end. I ordered the bang bang chicken, and it was sooooo yummy! I do prefer my steak here though. I also got the passion fruit mojito and it was on point! I don't drink. Like ever. But my coworker wanted to have a drink with me. I got this, and it wasn't too strong and very sweet (just how I like my alcohol). The only downfall was that it was too dark. I don't really like eating in such dim lighting but orher than that, everythig was great. Come here on any ocassion!"
