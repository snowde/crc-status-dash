Lyla D.,"Honolulu, HI",541,1010,13784,4.0,7/31/2016,"This year, National Cheesecake Day was celebrated on July 30, 2016.  We heard about The Cheesecake Factory's special as they generously offered 50% discount off any of their cheesecakes for both Friday, July 29 and Saturday, July 30.  The special was limited to DINE-IN, ONLY. We always see lines and crowds waiting to get into The Cheesecake Factory in Waikīkī.  This location must truly be their flagship restaurant for its immense seating capacity and customer turnover.  Fortunately, this restaurant is located in the Royal Hawaiian Center where they offer free 2 hour parking validation. After we attending to some errands on Saturday morning, we drove into Waikīkī and arrived just before The Cheesecake Factory's 11:00AM opening.  There was a line of about 10 people that had formed in front of the restaurant. But, as soon as the doors opened, the friendly and cheerful hostesses quickly escorted the people to their seats, including us.   TCF's menu is filled with so many menu items that it is like reading a book and we took our time to ""study"" the menu.   Our server was so patient, cheerful and attentive. He checked with us often to refill our beverages and even tempted us by passing by with other customers' orders while we waited for our lunch buddy.  By the time Lora C arrived, we had made our menu decisions.  She quickly perused the menu as we steered her to consider the lunch specials because we kept in mind our plans to order cheesecake for dessert. THE FOOD: -Louisiana Chicken Pasta:   Parmesan crusted chicken served over bow-tie pasta with mushrooms, peppers, onions in a spicy New Orleans sauce. The Parmesan crusted chicken, according to Lora, was chicken breast meat that was crisp on the outside and juicy, tender inside.  The bow tie pasta was cooked al dente and the creamy ""spicy"" New Orleans sauce provided a nice complement to the crispy-crusted chicken.  As for spiciness, it wasn't spicy at all and barely had a chile kick but, the flavor was good.  The lunch special was priced at $14.95 whereas the dinner portion usually runs as $18.95. -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta:  Rigatoni topped with broccoli, oven-dried tomatoes, roasted eggplant, mushrooms, onions, artichokes, Kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts.  I always seem to order this pasta because of its flavorful Mediterranean flavors.  But, I really wish they hadn't removed their Indian Fry-Bread sandwich. I ordered the dinner portion as it was priced at $15.95, just a dollar more than the lunch special and got a larger portion that I could doggie bag for later snacking. -Renee's Special:  Half of a turkey sandwich came with today's special soup (Stuffed Baked Potato) and tossed green salad for only $12.95.  My husband enjoyed his turkey sandwich which was stuffed with fresh lettuce, tomatoes and lots of fresh baked turkey.  The stuffed baked potato soup was thick and tasted like a fully-loaded potato yet in a soup form. He must've enjoyed it as he cleaned his plate.   DESSERT:   -Mango Key Lime Cheesecake: this fluffy key-lime flavored cheesecake was topped with mango mousse and its crust was made from vanilla coconut macaroons.   We liked the mango flavor and subtle lime flavor.  The coconut macaroon crust was good but we felt it should have been more chewy rather than crisp but, to each his own.... -Lemon Meringue Cheesecake:  I am smitten by lemon and meringue desserts as its bright lemony flavor brings out Summer so this was my choice.  The lemon curd that was swirled into the fluffy, yet dense cream cheesecake gave it just the right amount of sweet and tart.  Plus, there was a layer of lemony mousse that brought this dessert together with the  meringue.  Yes, folks, I DID share this with my husband who isn't much of a dessert eater but somehow, it disappeared in front of him faster than me! Yay for National Cheesecake Day and I can't wait for it to come around next year.  We enjoy going to TCF and shouldn't just wait for this promotion to return and neither should YOU!"
Derrick L.,"Mililani, HI",23,2,,2.0,10/23/2017,"We've been to this Waikiki Cheesecake Factory many times, and the service and food is always outstanding and is worth the 1 hour wait. We went there last night and was happy to know that the wait was only 30 minutes. Our waitress was Bianca who seemed more like a robot who showed very little personality, customer service and never smiled. Almost like she wanted off that night but was forced to work kind of attitude.  My wife was the only one that ordered a salad, which came quickly. But within 5 minutes our entrees arrived including hers. Why bring a person's entree when you just got your salad? When my wife told them that she's still eating her salad, the waiter asked if she'd like for them to hold her meal in the kitchen while she finished her salad. My wife agreed that would be best. About 5 minutes later Bianca told my wife it would be best if she could take her entree now or it'll be cold. It wasn't my wife's fault, so why the choice of either now or cold food? They should have made her a new dish when she was done with her salad. We also never got our complimentary bread as we usually got in the past.  When Bianca told us of the specialty cheesecakes, she rattled them off so quickly like it was something she was forced to do rather wanting to tell us about. We ordered our deserts and also one coffee. The deserts came but not the coffee.  Overall, the food was good as usual. I always order the chicken picatta, which I haven't found better at any other restaurant. It was just the service last night was terrible. That's why the wait was only 30 minutes, it's because they skip the bread, bring the food out while you're still eating the salad, and Bianca was just a waitress robot."
Lora C.,"Honolulu, HI",269,415,3478,4.0,7/31/2016,"June 30th is National cheesecake day! They were having a promotion for 2 days July 29 and July 30 for 50% off slices of any slice of cheesecake DINE IN ONLY.. I love New York cheesecake, the creamy rich texture, so delicious! Calories that are so worth it all. I've had the authentic rich NY cheesecake while I was on a trip in New York and man I want those...  This is the only location on island and being that it is in Waikiki, the line is usually very long! Crowded, sometimes long wait. I was lucky because Lyla and Ed arrived when they opened, got a table. I truly appreciated them for waiting for me... while I took a good 30mins to get there. I got lost, missed the turn to the parking structure at Royal Hawaiian. Then made a wrong turn into a one way street YIKES! Being a local, Waikiki isn't just confusing for tourist hahah. But with all these one way streets, it makes you mad... you gotta start all over if you miss that one turn..  Finally, I made it. Cheesecake was on my mind for days!!! Since it was lunch time I got the Louisana Chicken which was $4 cheaper than the regular dinner price. the Louisiana chicken comes with bow tie pasta and chicken Parmesan. The sauce has a creamy spicy taste with some vegetables like onion and tomato. The chicken was juicy. Not overly cooked. Lyla got her usual.. Evelyn's Favorite. The pasta was light but good. I could see why she always order that.  Ed got the lunch special, Rene special (sandwich that comes with salad and a potato soup) wow what a deal. Portion was generous! The soup was yummy!  THE BEST PART: THE CHEESECAKE!!! Lyla ordered the lemon meringue cheesecake. I got the Mango keylime cheesecake. Now now we both wanted the sweet and sour yet savory of the cheesecake. I liked mine, although they should have asked if I wanted whip cream... I personally don't like whip cream in mostly anything. It's unwanted calories I could use towards other things. Let me tell you, first time trying this slice, my mango keylime cheesecake was mango-y with a kick of lime and that coconut macaroon crust went well together! It had lots of shredded coconut in every bite.  The lemon meringue was bold! I like that too! Thank you two for being so patient with me today!  You guys are always great company :)   Until we meet again amazing cheesecake....."
Mignonette G.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",76,6,11,4.0,10/12/2017,Passion fruit Margarita is a great choice for Margarita lovers who want something different from the typical Margarita. Don't let the martini glass full you it is full of flavor.
Eric M.,"Haleiwa, HI",56,12,3,3.0,12/9/2017,Wait time was 50 mins for 5 on a busy Saturday night.  No too bad.  The waiter (alvin) was ok.  We celebrated our daughters birthday.  Alvin was disappointing.  Food was good though.
Lois S.,"Kaneohe, HI",11,84,324,4.0,8/31/2016,"Its been a while since I've been here.  Got there early to try and beat the rush, since they don't take reservations.  Even though we arrived before 5pm, we were still quoted a 25 minute wait. I went to the bar to have a drink.  The kids walked over to the newly opened International marketplace, which was directly across the street. We were seated slightly over the 25 minute time we were quoted.  Restaurant was extremely busy, but our server was very timely and remembered all the special requests that we made. We ordered our usual Kalua Pig Nachos, which is always fabulous!  There's some liquidy, gooey white cheese at the bottom of the plate....oh so yummy! For the first time, we ordered the deep fried mac and Cheese Balls.  Yum! My only complaint at this restaurant is just the fact that I have too many choices.  I always go through at least five selections and in the end, I always get the same thing.... Pasta Da Vinci.  I love it!  I just want to drink that sauce, sooooo good! Portions are so huge so we never have any cheesecake (although we stopped at Uncle Tetsu's at the nearby food court and picked up a cheesecake to go) You are pretty much guaranteed to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  So when you consider the portions, it's a pretty great deal and great for families. Consistent service and consistent product, you ALWAYS know what you're getting!"
Ann C.,"Honolulu, HI",11,105,293,3.0,3/31/2017,"Not my pick but went to celebrate a birthday with the fam. The birthday girl who chose the place was very happy to be there. The menu is extensive the food just mediocre in my opinion. I had the gumbo someone else had the steak Diane some shrimp pasta was ordered and a Cobb salad. The crab and artichoke appetizer was good, and the kids love their sliders and bowtie pasta. Everyone comes here for dessert really, let's just be honest. We had shared a Smore's cheesecake, a red velvet cheesecake, and the kids had an ice cream sundae. Of course no one finished their dinner or their dessert and we all went home with doggy bags. It's always nice to go out into Waikiki. Even if it's crowded and full of tourists it's nice to just do something different once in a while instead of the normal neighborhood restaurants we always tend to go to."
Danny B.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,6,,4.0,12/10/2017,"We have travelled throughout the USA, if you want consistent great food, go to The Cheese Cake Factory !"
Jason T.,"Alexandria, VA",104,121,150,5.0,3/7/2017,The food and drinks at CC Factory are great for a relaxed night on the town.  I just went for like the 50th time and my visit was very pleasant which is normal.  The staff places an importance on customer service and making sure your enjoy your dining experience.  They actually made a mistake on one of the dishes and left that as a comp for the table.  Great customer service.  The pear martini was awesome and the Sandwiches and appetizers are very tasty.  All the other entrees we had were also excellent.   Try the Asian pear martini before they get rid of it.
Rakel A.,"Kailua, HI",76,73,49,4.0,7/18/2017,Some say this location is the busiest they have ever been to. I think every location from east to west coast is equally as busy as the Waikiki location. The one thing that stands out to me about this location is how amazing the servers are. Personality is everything and every server I have ever had is always fun and bubbly and just enough over the top ensuring you feel like their only patron in such a busy establishment. Items are always fresh and the cocktails are amazing. If you have the time give them a try. The quality of the service and the food will seem worth the wait for a table. Happy eating yeeps!!
Clancy O.,"Sydney, Australia",35,7,5,5.0,6/18/2017,"Cheesecake Factory was well worth the visit and wait! We went at about 8pm on a Saturday night. You have to line up to get a ticket, then come back after about 20 minutes for a buzzer, then it's about another half an hour after that before you're seated. There's plenty of interesting things around to view while you're waiting though as it's located on the main strip. Our waiter Josh was an absolute legend! Attentive, friendly, and amazingly quick service- thanks so much Josh!  Ordered the chicken and biscuits and the meatloaf for our mains- we were both super impressed with the large sizes and home style taste. Nothing tastes like it's come from a giant chain!  For dessert we had the mango key lime cheesecake which was also super tasty and generous serve.  Would absolutely visit any location next time I'm in the states! Cheap and generous with great service!"
Fuad J.,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Biggest mistake  my life. This is the worst food you can ever eat. This restaurant should be banned. Wait time is was an hour. The food is the most tasteless you will ever eat. Please stop going here. Over rated restaurant. I asked for Soucy Bang Bang Shrimp. They gave me shrimp that was sweet, as if sugar was added to it."
Ashley P.,"Las Vegas, NV",299,155,204,5.0,7/17/2017,"Came here close to closing one night and I must say, it was a great dining experience. The server was really into making us laugh and making sure we were good on everything. I wasn't hungry but I did order a Mai Tai and let me tell you, super strong! The cheesecake was delicious and I can't even begin to describe how phenomenal it was! I can't stress enough how the ""aloha spirit"" back home makes dining experiences a million times more better. I feel like I'm really big on customer service rather than food quality and so forth when it comes to reviews. Hence, the server was more than 5 stars! Thank you Cheesecake, I'll be back SOON! :)"
Lavelua A.,"Honolulu, HI",32,27,105,4.0,8/29/2017,"This place is busy, busy, busy. it doesn't matter  what day, it's busy!!!  Food is reliable and good.  Lately, their staff has stepped it up with smiles and helpfulness all around."
Claudia M.,"Honolulu, HI",58,19,234,4.0,3/28/2017,"Came here after a movie. Had the Avocado egg rolls, lettuce wraps, and ended it with a Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The food is always good here, but the wait is long. We waited approximately 40 minutes. This was on a Saturday night. Typical weekend for Waikiki. Service was great and we didn't have to wait long for our food.  Am I the only one who likes the wheat bread more than the sourdough? haha. Will come back just for the bread!"
Rachael T.,"Auckland, New Zealand",0,16,,4.0,11/6/2017,"Ate here 3 times in 2.5 weeks lol - twice i had the Meatloaf which was delicious, and once the smokehouse burger, which was also delicious.  Unlimited refills on soda, friendly staff and good cheesecake as well.  Huge menu and huge portions.  I am a fan ;)  probably just as well we don't have them in NZ as I would visit too often!"
Maki K.,"Honolulu, HI",21,217,1460,3.0,8/28/2016,It has been long time I come here. This place reminds me of my best friend Leanne who loved Avocado Egg Rolls so much!! I remember one time we ordered them one each!!  Today I enjoyed memorable Avocado Egg rolls!!
Cathlene B.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,9/16/2017,"Came here to have a dinner for my birthday, we came in late so the wait isn't as crazy. They sat us on our seats and the server Jocelyn came in, she wasn't attentive at all. My boyfriend said it's her birthday and she looked at my ID and didn't say anything, rude! She barely checks in on our table so when we had our second cocktails we already finished our food.  And when we decided to take a cheesecake home she said we could just order it in the table, we only wanted to order a small size but according to her almost all of their cheesecake were sold in full so I have no choice but to get their plane strawberry cheesecake, sad but hey it's a cheesecake. We waited for our takeout cheesecake for almost an hour. Not happy at all though we still gave her a good amount of tip. Overall this is probably gonna be my first and last visit to cheesecake factory."
Ashley L.,"Honolulu, HI",178,58,131,1.0,7/2/2016,"BUG ALERT! DO NOT EAT HERE! NOT SAFE! I'm posting this review literally 15 min after I ran from this place in Waikiki. When I sat down I noticed the back of my thighs were a little itchy. I attributed this to the wicker seats but to make sure I went to the bathroom to check it out. There I discovered more than ten bite marks! I'm talking BIG, half dollar sized welts that were inflamed and incredibly itchy. Normally I'm very shy about my body, but I'm posting pictures to prove it. I took them in Cheesecake's bathroom.  Please do not eat here. No food is worth the pain I'm in."
Melissa P.,"Seattle, WA",575,132,113,5.0,12/4/2016,"As basic as it is to visit while traveling, I'm so happy that I did! This was probably the highlight of my trip, I recommend sitting on the outdoor patio that faces forever 21 because they have cool tiki torches that really give you the Hawaiian feel Location: It is located right on the main strip where many of the stores are as well as the mall. It's right next door to the huge Forever 21  which will be my next review (make sure to go here next). Wait time: Make sure you come either really late at night or early before lunch because I remember my tour guide driver mentioning that this is the busiest and most visited Cheesecake Factory around the world (not sure how true that is, but the wait line definitely felt that way)! Still worth it, you can even put your name down and then go to forever 21 next door that's what I did lol Service: I had the best server she was so nice and down to earth! I've never had bad experience waiter/waitress wise at Cheesecake Factory Food/drink: For food I highly recommend both the factory grande burrito and the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. You can't go wrong with either they're both so tasty and filling! For drinks I suggest getting the pineapple or blueberry mojitos, they're strong and refreshing!"
