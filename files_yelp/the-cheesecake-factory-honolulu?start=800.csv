B T.,"Honolulu, HI",3,28,6,5.0,3/1/2014,"I love love love this place. Every time I get my paycheck , this is my splurge food place! I recently moved from California to here for school. I loved the Cheesecake Factorys I went to back home and this one is just as delicious .  They're all perfection. Servers are great, pretty much anything you get won't disappoint you! Especially the cheesecake.  I personally love to get the Lemon Herb roasted chicken dish (but I substitute for the asparagus as a side) or the salmon one, under specialties I believe. And my boyfriend likes to get the Chicken Littles! He's not very big on the veggies or fish entrees.  Anyway, and for their cheesecake I love to get Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake if you love coconut and chocolate together! The Oreo Extreme (I think that's it's name) is great if you love a fancy version of Cookies and cream flavored stuff!"
samantha e.,"Honolulu, HI",1,8,3,3.0,4/30/2014,"Today I had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory on Oahu for the first time. I was so excited because I heard so many great things about it and I was going to be able to experience it first hand, well it wasn't what I was expecting. I went with my nieces Sammy and Hue and my nephew Tristin. Sammy and Hua have been to the Restaurant before and just loved it. Sammy had the Chicken Madeira Hua and I we...nt with the Fettuccini Alfredo and Tristin had a plain charbroiled Hamburger. Sammy and Tristin's food was great Hua and I not so great. The Alfredo was extremely salty we just could not eat it so we sent it back. We got two new orders a little bit better but still to salty Hua sent hers back I decide to try and eat mine and asked for more bread to help cover the saltiness. Bread, water, even bear could not cover the saltiness. The reason I am writing this is because even though my first experience was not very good I am willing to give it one more try because of how we were treated. When we sent back the first order Wayne (sorry did not get last name) came to our table and apologized and explained what they though might have been the problem and reassured us a new order would be out shortly. Wayne was apologetic, he empathized and really showed that they care about there customers. He offered to bring out complementary drinks or food to make up for the problem. The second time he came out to talk to us again nothing but professionalism. That is the reason I will give it another try I really believe that statements made that it is the bomb is true and this was just a fluke. One comment maybe Wayne should spend some time with the waitress Tammie she needs a little help in being more attentive to her customer even if it is an 8 year old. she was good at letting wayne know about what happened with the food we sent back, but that was about it!! she would ask a question but we never finished asking while she just walked away from us. I watched as she helped other customers and i did not see her treating them this way, she looked like she was conversating with other customers but just very vauge with us, maybe because we were ""locals"" i dont know what her problem was, but she really needs to treat customers the way she would want to be treated."
Irma Lizet H.,"Honolulu, HI",8,27,1,1.0,10/13/2014,"Worst customer service ever. It doesn't matter how busy you get, people should never get bumped to the back of the line after waiting for 45 minutes. Then give a sorry ass excuse and ask that you wait another 70 minutes smh never again will we come here."
Norman T.,"Stroud, OK",0,8,,3.0,7/14/2015,"Eeeh , I only ate there one time so maybe it was just an off day but the wait was long , the food was overpriced, and not really that great . There are better and places on the beach that serve better food with lower prices than this place , but if you're into; being surrounded by dudes named Chad, extra extra cheese music and paying too much for ""atmosphere "" this is the place for you ."
Jaime H.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,3/21/2016,"I have to say that this was the WORST SERVICE EVER waited for almost 15 minutes for our waitress to even come to the table once we were sat. After that, we ordered drinks and had to ask for bread.we sat for a while our bread empty and had to ask for extra bread. We then waited for that for another 15 minutes and then before our food came out she took away the bread when we had just got a moment or two before. There was no silverware on the table and My pasta can out cold and my drink was not refilled even once! Sat and waited for over half hour for her to return to the table. Would not recommend this to anyone one. Hopefully this is an off night but probably won't be coming back"
Vivian L.,"Seattle, WA",306,116,154,3.0,4/18/2013,"To be completely honest, sometimes I do wish The Cheesecake Factory was JUST a cheesecake factory. Their cheesecake selection? Fabulous assortment! My best friend put ""Trying all The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake"" on her bucket list. It's been over two years and she still has a looooong way to go. I've been here for lunches and dinners, and each time the wait is pretty long. They DO NOT take reservations. I make sure to get to Waikiki around 10:30 a.m. for lunch and around 5 p.m. for dinners.  Our servers are always very friendly and make sure our bread basket is full. I love the complimentary sweet oat bread. Their menu is huge, but the food doesn't particularly impress me. I've been presented with undercooked pasta before that had to be sent back. The portions are large, so if you want room for cheesecake, I suggest splitting an entrée with someone. So, moving on! Here are my recommendations: Appetizers: Skip the appetizers unless you're with a large group. Otherwise, avocado eggrolls are the way to go. Entrées:  -Four Cheese Pasta for the cheese lover (You really, really don't need that extra parmesan, honey.) -Shrimp Scampi -Seared Tuna Tataki Salad (My personal go-to entrée--featured on their Skinnylicious ""low calorie"" menu with 442 cal, assuming you get the tomatoes instead of the potatoes) Cheesecake: -Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake -Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake -Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Extra tips: -No reservations -Park at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center and get your ticket validated (2-hour complimentary validated parking) -Kill some time by checking out the stores around the restaurant but don't wander too far or your buzzer won't catch the signal when they call you -No room for dessert afterwards? Get it boxed! :)"
Sydnie C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",81,15,5,3.0,7/5/2015,Food was amazing like always! Reason for three stars was our waitress. Saw her to take our order and give us the bill. No refills on drinks no checking on us etc.
T S.,"Honolulu, HI",9,19,14,4.0,8/15/2013,"We decided to spend family time in Waikiki today; and the visit would not be complete without a stop at The Cheesecake Factory. First, I'm so glad that The Cheesecake Factory did not close down after the fire. The decor is beautiful; one would never know that there was a fire here. Second, the food is just okay. I ordered the shepard's pie, and it had too much garlic in it. For the rest of the day afterward, I could taste the garlic in my mouth. The noise level is loud, and the density of the noise level hits you when you enter the restaurant. However, the noise decibal level went down somewhat after we were seated off to the side. Based on food and noise, I would be inclined to give this place 3 stars. However, our server was EXCELLENT! She kept checking on us to make sure that we were okay; and she promptly showed up out of nowhere whenever we needed something (e.g., drink refills, etc.). And of course, the cheesecake for dessert is absolutely fantastic! I always choose the strawberry cheesecake; it's a classic and guaranteed pleaser. The women's bathroom is a bit dark and feels creepy. It would be nicer if there were more lighting in there. On a side note, there was a tourist standing in front of the bathroom sink and she was openly flossing her teeth. Yuck!! I'm glad that I waited until after the meal to encounter the dental hygienist in the bathroom; otherwise; I would have lost my appetite."
Nicole C.,"Honolulu, HI",12,58,14,2.0,11/10/2014,"Food was nothing great, i knew the wait was long but sadly the wait was for nothing. The staff was very nice, which is why i gave two stars.  Probably won't be going back."
Jim P.,"Port Townsend, WA",30,285,125,4.0,12/20/2011,"Good food, GREAT Cheesecake , good beer selection. Ribeye steak is excellent. Get there early as there's qute a line after 6 PM or so"
Rachael R.,"Bay Saint Louis, MS",1,43,10,5.0,3/15/2015,"My friends & I dined here last night for my bday dinner! Even though we waited over an hour to be seated, we ended up with the most phenomenal waiter! Tyler is the  ! I will be returning & will definitely request to sit in his area."
Malia P.,"Honokaa, HI",1,6,2,5.0,3/14/2016,"Great food & excellent customer service. The wait is long (over 1 hour on a Friday night), but well worth it!"
Chrissy-Sunshine S.,"Honolulu, HI",1,4,,1.0,5/12/2015,Day after Mothers Day ... Not much of a wait.  Ordered steak Diane med rare.  Came out not even warm in the center rare. Our server ignored us and I had to ask a bus boy to help me.  The manager came over and tried to argue with me about the temperature of the steak being accurate ... It wasn't.  Very disappointed after having such a great time our first time in .... Gonna chalk it up to just a bad day with a really bad server.
A C.,"Lacey, WA",2,51,5,4.0,7/19/2014,Cheesecake here will be the best you will ever eat.  Food is awesome here. Prices are above average. It's usually packed here and hard to get to cause it's in Waikiki.
Kiichi R.,"Waipahu, HI",190,154,114,4.0,8/2/2013,"Despite always having some sort of wait (ranging from 10 minute to 1+ hours), it is well worth it. Having been here roughly a dozen times, the service has generally been great. This means that they were friendly and capable of answering questions. Food choices? TOO MANY! Come in at lunch time for sizeable portions for a bit less. And trust me, you'll still get your fill, considering you'll be eating that mandatory dessert right? On top of the listed choices, meals such as the salmon have different flavoring! And they're very accommodating if you're allergic or wanting that extra sauce.  Now onto the cheesecakes - my suggestions: For those that want a light, but neutral flavor cheesecake that goes well even when you're full - the vanilla bean cheesecake. In fact, I would have to put it in my top 3 cheesecakes because it's delicious and very satisfying. If you want something fruity and familiar, my absolute favorite - dutch apple streusel cheesecake. My favorite because I love dutch apple pie and it's not overly sweet, despite having caramel in it. The nuts and cinnamon dutch pie crumbs help to keep the sweetness in check. A definite win. Want something sour? KEY LIME. Prepare to have your face implode. If you like sour, but not painful sour, the mango key lime pie is a better choice. Chocolate lover? The Godiva or new Oreo cheesecake is very delicious. Random dessert? I suggest the Chocolate Truffle Tower Cake. Not a cheesecake but enormous and very flavorful.  It does not receive a full 5-stars because it is exclusively in Waikiki and locals, such as myself, must travel from the other side of the island to enjoy the delicacies that is heaven."
Oliver K.,"Honolulu, HI",3,14,9,4.0,5/5/2014,"This is a great a place to eat when you have a group or if you are just on a couples date ..... the menu is loooooooong and the selection is overwhelming ... also the bread that you receive as an appetizer is one of the best on the island ... however having a drink, cheesecake and a main dish will def hurt your wallet ..."
Sally P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,18,1,4.0,6/17/2015,Great lunch and good portions. Hard to make anymore room for cheesecake dessert.  Plan on spending close to a Ben Franklin with tip though! Wait time varies and extended wait time for dinner and weekend eats.
Mary M.,"Denver, CO",1,35,,3.0,3/30/2015,"2 PM on a Sunday, we requested a table for five. 30 minute wait with a remote buzzer to let us know when a table was available. Once our buzzer went off we waited another 10 minutes for the receptionist to acknowledge us. After being seated we waited another 10 minutes for someone to stop by and take our drink order.  The waitress was friendly and refilled our drinks promptly.  We spent an hour and 20 minutes in this restaurant while we ate our meal and dessert.  Staff seemed rushed but were friendly.  The food was delicious, but I will only eat here on special occasions due to the price and long wait to be seated."
Kimmy A.,"Honolulu, HI",34,79,94,4.0,7/30/2013,I had something with chicken lol the name i believe was italian so i dont quite remember but the chicken meat was white and tender and oh so delicious! I also had the tuxedo cheesecake for the first time and I loved it. I usually have the godiva one which is still my favorite but i wanted to try something new.
Juliet M.,"Honolulu, HI",312,219,7,2.0,11/19/2011,Yawwwwwn..  ....Over-priced and disturbing that people go here when they could have gone to Side Street Inn or The Little Village.  This place is expensive and can be had in Sacto (in other words save this place for when you are desperate in a SH$% town).   Hawaii has far too many options get out and explore.
