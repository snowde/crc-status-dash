Alex B.,"Bellingham, WA",134,250,9,4.0,6/16/2011,"Honestly, I was really surprised. I expected a run of the mill American chain restaurant salad. I was knocked off my chair when I saw and tasted my ahi tuna salad with tomato, avocado, pickled ginger, greens and about 6 oz worth of some of the best ahi tuna I've ever had. All for $17 US. The coffee sucked, but who cares? The salad was superb."
Pali K.,"Honolulu, HI",13,19,1,4.0,6/4/2013,"Well, they would've gotten a 5, but had to wait an hour+.  I guess it's ok though-you're told that.. if they weren't great, we wouldn't have to wait :) So, parking on the 6th floor and hiking a mile (exaggerating) to the restaurant will surely build an appetite.  Menu is freaking huge, choices are beyond abundant and the food taste is AWESOME.  Even when they're slammed, consistency is there.   Highly recommend: * Chicken Piccata * BBQ Chicken Chop Salad (or Cobb salad, can't remember the actual name) * Crab wontons  * Spicy ahi tempura rolls If you can stand waiting an eternity for a table (and it's worth the wait), you'll be happy to have eaten there."
Donna A.,"Aiea, HI",10,11,9,4.0,5/1/2015,"I always love love love The Cheesecake Factory.  Great meals, great service, and of course great cheesecake.  My favorite is the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake umm umm"
Jackson C.,"Honolulu, HI",63,17,2,4.0,8/13/2013,"We would probably come here more often if it was not in Waikiki.  But aside from that, you get prenty of food for the price that you pay.  The service is usually pretty good.  The only thing is if you get there after 5:30 for dinner, there is usually a line and you have to wait. There are a lot of choices, but my favorite is the Chicken Madeira.  I usually order this and don't try anything else.  But this last time, I ventured and tried their pork chop.  That was pretty good too.  The pork chop was tender and full of flavors. We also ALWAYS order the avacado eggrolls.  The dip is superb! Dessert...  Too many to choose from...  You just have to try them out.  I wish they had a sampler!"
Mike M.,"Belmont, CA",111,451,909,3.0,11/11/2013,"Come early!!!!!!!!! This place had the longest line I have ever seen, like 100 people lol (ok more like 50-60).  Basically it was really long and I was only coming here to pick up some cheesecakes to go and that line was long too.  Long story short, if you got to eat here, make a reservation, come after peek hours, or place your order to go, otherwise be prepared to wait a long time!!"
Carmen B.,"Wahiawā, HI",3,27,34,5.0,4/27/2014,This place is great!!! lovely service very friendly and helpful if you can't make up your mind on what to get. Must order dessert so delicious. Validation parking at royal hawaiian. Very clean and nice atmosphere
Charmaine H.,"Avondale Heights, Australia",54,69,382,3.0,1/4/2014,"Thoroughly enjoyed the company and staff were really friendly. Would appreciate more gluten-free options though. Remember to make room for cheesecake as good serves are bigger than life!!!! Take-away boxes for food leftovers are handy though. I love that cheesecake take away orders are easy to do......expect to try more slices next time I fly in from Australia. The TV sitcom, Big Bang Theory does not portray how truly busy this place can get over the festive season!!!!"
Christine P.,"Renton, WA",239,101,39,4.0,1/30/2013,"This is my second attempt to eat dinner here, but I will not let me first try ruin it for me!  My first time was on my birthday. My mom had sent me a gift card for the factory and I was so excited to go! (Word to the wise, they do not take reservations!) We went on a Sunday at about 7:00 pm and the line was half way to the side walk, by the time we got the hostess they said it would be a 1.5 hour wait! No way I was going to do that! So try #1 was a loss. The next weekend we went on a Saturday at 4:30 and got seated right away!! (Yay finally) I have to say the portion size of my pasta was huge!! The food came very fast and our waitress was so attentive! I had about half my dinner to take home since there was so much. We ordered one cheesecake slice apiece and then one to take home. Try #2 was a major success!   *eat the brown bread they give you when you sit down, oh my gosh it was great!!"
Susan R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,6,,4.0,6/7/2015,Had 2 drinks and delicious guacamole lunch at bar today. Passed in front of 20 or so people waiting for table or outside seating. Chips a bit thicker and saltier than Chiles but good. The guacamole creamy but chunky. Service was great and met a few people while dining.
James F.,"Honolulu, HI",79,22,3,1.0,11/4/2014,"It's election night in the USA. I came in for a drink and bite at the bar asked the bartender to change one of  two TV sets from sports to election  results. He obliged after checking with the one other patron at the bar. The female bar manager,Tiffany, came right over and said NO NEWS ALLOWED ON TVS. WTH it's election night in USA. Come on Cheesecake Factory !"
garrett w.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,9,,5.0,6/5/2015,"Cheesecake Factory Honolulu is always a delight -- excellent food, amazing service, Aloha spirit."
Kea K.,"Honolulu, HI",1,46,1,4.0,2/19/2015,Love love love their food if you haven't been here its a must!  but the only reason I give it a 4 star was because some of the staff needs a attitude adjustment!!!  they can be rude.
Sara T.,"Honolulu, HI",78,207,50,3.0,1/25/2013,"This place is outrageous.  I would personally never choose to come here because of the ridiculous wait time, but my BF's family wanted to have dinner here, so we all prepared to camp out outside the restaurant.  After an hour and a half wait, we finally got seated.   The food is all quite good and the portions are enormous, so the value is undeniable. The  menu is so extensive that it's almost frustrating to try to pick what to eat!  We had two appetizers for the table - avocado spring rolls and crab rangoons.  Both were tasty, but the avocado spring rolls were amazingly good, packed with avocados with a cilantro sauce that really brought out the flavors.  I ordered a passion fruit mojito that was a little weak, but delicious (like minty juice). I also had the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, which was very tasty.  BF ordered the white chicken chili, which had white beans and a Southwestern-style, sour creamy flavor with a little kick.  Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food as well.  Service was not lightning fast, but if you consider that we had 8 people, and the restaurant is enormous, it was very reasonable. This place must be a goldmine, because it's almost like a factory the way they get people in and out.  I definitely won't be a frequent patron, because I'm not into waiting over an hour to sit down, but I will return every so often."
Savannah C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,9,1,5.0,4/22/2015,"Came for lunch today and it was the best service we'd ever had here. We've been here several times in the past (during dinner) which were okay but this time was outstanding. Joe was an excellent server, he knew the menu very well and gave several great recommendations, we will definitely be coming for lunch again."
Maria S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,94,2,3.0,9/29/2013,"Food  can either be hit or miss!!! For the most part i enjoy this place, wait can be a bit long.. but again its waikiki so what can you expect.. Looking forward to coming back soon!"
Kimo K.,"Honolulu, HI",347,201,2306,4.0,1/12/2013,"$26 million Cheesecake factory most popular restaurant in Hawaii.  I will write a review if I can ever get a seat in the restaurant..... Always a line but Japanese tourist only go if there is a line.. and they take pictures of everything, hilarious to see them order pupus and main plates and no room on table for two.. eyes as big as speed racer.. taking pictures and blogging even before they eat.. but the plates so big homeless can sleep on them.   Food is consistent and always good.. bread great.. atmosphere is not Hawaiian but they dont care.. nice live music.. good bar and the secret is that at night it is an hour wait.. but you can sit on the wall and kibitz with the tourists or go to the bar and order food.. but that gives away the only way I can eat there.. also a back bar only for local professionals after work who do not want to wait in line.  should have live music in the back and give some native Hawaiians jobs instead of just kids off the boat from LA.    I have eaten CF in Beverly HIlls and Marina Del Rey since 1984 and only thing bad is that the restaurant is not on the beach, with the money they make.. they should buyout the Moana Surfrider and open Cheesecake Resort right on the beach and make more money than that hotel which basically wastes good beachfront restaurant space with junk food..  but they make no mistake for sure they have more money than God .. store brings life to Kalakaua street scene and Royal Hawaiian center.. if you get wait buzzer let the girls go shop Forever 21 next door.  Cheesecake makes more than Dukes about $2 million a month.. so dont forget to tip your waitress.. even though she might make more than you.  They should make a reality show and make stars out of their staff."
Sasha L.,"Honolulu, HI",432,266,276,5.0,10/21/2013,"This place always has a ridiculously long line if you're waiting for a table.  But I like eating at the bar as much as I like eating at a table, so I always skip the pager and go straight to the bar!  Never have had to wait for the bar there :] I like their entrees (the salmon with herbs is delicious and tender) but I really just go for the dessert.. Irish Coffee with Baileys and a banana cream cheesecake please!  My absolute favorite combination!  The bartenders are super cool, so skip the two hour wait and jump to the bar! 5 stars is for the cheesecake alone ;]"
Matthew L.,"Washington, DC",12,13,1,5.0,10/15/2014,"Great staff, great food, great selection, great atmosphere. The bartender in the back section, Chris, is excellent. It's usually a long wait and they don't take reservations (they don't need to:they are always packed) so be prepared for a wait!"
George S.,"Camarillo, CA",1,8,2,4.0,5/27/2014,Long lines anytime of the day but short waits. If there is room and you don't mind  try sitting in the bar area. Super friendly service.  It's still cheese cake factory food. If you are in Hawaii this is probably the last place to eat with so many real great places on the island. If you have to give it a try go for it. If you have the time go to Halewa Joes on the north shore it's worth the 60 minute drive.
Philippe E.,"Sydney, Sydney, Australia",0,53,1,4.0,3/10/2014,It may not be the finest dining experience but this place has great food and great service as well. Their menu is huge and the choice of cheesecake is just amazing.  This restaurant is always packed and with long waiting line. If you don't mind sitting in the bar area just ask any of the staff if there are seats available so you don't have to wait for too long. We went there twice and had not waited to get seats at the bar. You can both eat and drink at the bar.
