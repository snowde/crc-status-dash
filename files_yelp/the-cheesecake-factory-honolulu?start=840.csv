Bang bang chicken , chicken shrimp gumbo, white chilli chicken, Rib-eye ( 16 oz & medium rare :))))))   My favorite cheesecake is the White chocolate macadamia raspberry :D !  The onion Ring ( big fat one ) is so gooooood !  Tips: the portion is big ! Watch out ! And the Menu is big ! Be ready :D"
Julie-May L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,5.0,3/7/2015,"After an unfortunate mishap with a reservation made at another fine-dining restaurant, Cheesecake Factory saves the day on a Friday night!!! My boyfriend and I were seated in two minutes, once checking in. Our waitress was excellent! She was very helpful and polite. And most of all the food and overall service was on point and fast!! So as they say, ""if it's meant to be, it will be."" We were glad to have not eaten at the fine-dining restaurant (Hy's)  as originally planned. We left the Cheesecake Factory feeling very full and very happy!"
Zar A.,"Honolulu, HI",815,382,935,4.0,1/10/2011,"BUSY, BUSY, BUSY location. My secret to getting a table here is to come about 15-30 minutes before they open at 11AM. Then, you are guaranteed seating. I don't like waiting, so I have never come at dinner time. I heard that they get craaaaazzzzzyyyyyy busy... My favorite items: +Hawaiian luau salad - salad made w/ a Hawaiian twist! Besides lettuce, the salad is a three layer wonton chip salad (generous portion, easy fills two to four people) and kalua pork! yummmm! The salad dressing is a little on the strong side, but pretty yummy! +Energy breakfast - comes with egg whites, grilled chicken and some spinach and grilled tomatoes. +Snickers cheesecake - I'm weak for nuts..."
Ryan T.,"Honolulu, HI",110,90,589,4.0,4/11/2011,"Even with the long waits and the crowded, touristy atmosphere. The food and service make up for it once you are seated.  Pros: -Everything I've had taste good and the Steak Diane will keep me coming back  when I need my red meat fix.  -Food comes fast -Good service -My father swears he had the best soup he's ever had there.  Cons: -Long wait after 6 -No cheap parking in site -Loud  -No intimate seating, better for groups than a date.  Tips: Sometimes you can speed up the process if you find a table in the bar, I think most if not all seats are first come, first serve. Also, small bar hidden in the back, sometimes you get lucky since not many people seem to know about it(don't tell anyone ;-)."
Tyler Y.,"Ewa Beach, HI",181,94,39,4.0,11/21/2013,"I've lived in Hawaii all my life and only got to eat here for the first time ever today! I'm glad we got to sit right away because I was told the wait is long and you can't make reservations :(  Anyways, came in for lunch and ordered avocado egg rolls (which was AWESOME!) and Evelyn's favorite pasta or something of the sort. I ordered the lunch portion pasta which is pretty large and filling! My boyfriend ordered the lunch pizza. The salad was a full plate of salad, not those mini skimpy side salads. The pizza is 8"" ish..? Lol.  Definitely had way too much to eat that I wasn't able to eat dessert... :( need to come back again to try some!  The only downside to the restaurant is since it's a large amount of people that eat here, the noise level definitely proves that. Lol, don't expect a quiet place to eat, it's pretty noisy!"
Kimmy P.,"San Jose, CA",6,17,3,1.0,2/27/2015,"I have eaten in The Cheesecake Factory so many times, but the one here in Honolulu is horrible. We ordered our food as take out, and of course they forgot an item. The carrot cake cheesecake (which I have also had plenty of times at other Cheesecake Factories) tastes like they switched the cinnamon with the flour when they made it. It was disgusting. I was really surprised how it is so inconsistent with their other restaurants in California."
Michael J.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,86,,4.0,4/1/2013,"The thing to keep in mind if you decide to eat here, is that this place is constantly busy.  I came here for a late lunch one day, a Saturday, and they were packed.   Now, I believe there are mainly two types of customers in this world: pampered, spoiled, demanding, condescending types, and those who are willing to give the help the benefit of the doubt until they actually screw up.  I think I fall into the latter category.   So, the quality of the service here was great considering that my waitress was incredibly busy.  You may actually have to wait for a refill of water, and you may not have your meat cooked to a level perfectly suited to your palate.  Guess what?  You are still in Waikiki eating at a quality restaurant with hard working waiters and waitresses who have to deal with whiny tourists day after day after ever loving day.  If there is one thing I learned after eating here, it is that restaurant staff are an under-appreciated crowd. Now, off my soapbox.  The food was delicious.  I had a shepherd's pie and a couple brews.  It hit the spot, and I highly recommend this dish if you decide to eat here.  Your seating choices are fantastic: you can either sit in their outdoor area on Kalakaua, or have a relaxing meal inside the restaurant.  I enjoyed the dining experience, had a terrific, hard-working waitress, and all of it was for a very reasonable price considering the location. I didn't get to see ""Penny"" from Big Bang Theory (haha) but I still had a good time and will go back here if I'm ever hungry again in Waikiki."
Rebeccah E.,"Clarksville, TN",0,44,,4.0,6/14/2013,"Awesome food, nice ambiance, friendly service.... My only complaint is the prices. Like everything else in Hawaii, this place is seriously overpriced but hey, it is the Cheesecake Factory.  Munch on!!"
Glenn T.,"Waipahu, HI",10,136,25,4.0,12/21/2014,"Came for breakfast. Why do I keep forgetting to share my meal with wife?!?  It is so big (and good) that I have no room for a cheesecake. Oh well, next time but it was still good. Good service too."
Daren D.,"Seattle, WA",684,1691,1042,4.0,9/24/2013,"I decided to check 'er out one night before I left the island and parked up at the last end spot at the bar. A typical, packed house it was. Spacious - I think I heard a live musician somewhere, or was it the music? Of the 2 I've been to in Seattle during the night, this place is perhaps slightly-y-y-y more dim. Chad, the bartender, was very smooth and on tempered rails as I watched him make various drinks over the course of the night; he's also very laidback & chill. I went for ze incredible grilled eggplant sandwich (overstatement?) and it was very nice---messy---but nice! Good stuff, along with the subbed sweet potato fries. One thing I forgot the CCF has is complimentary bread! Ohh, I especially love the dark bread. The Kentucky Tea drink came out in a slendered out glass and had a subtle buzz. All was darn good to me. I usually try supporting the less-reviewed but I thought heck, just give it a whirl."
Bryanie R.,"Pearl City, HI",13,116,72,4.0,11/22/2013,"This place is good. I've been here a couple times and my friend and I went today to celebrate both of our birthdays. The host was really nice with seating us and the food was prepared well. We couldn't finish it all. A bit pricey, but what do you expect? It's a restaurant in Waikiki. They sang happy birthday to us and brought our cheese cakes with candles in it. It was a really good too. It's kind of dark in there and the bathrooms are big."
John H.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",0,3,,4.0,3/21/2016,I've had fantastic food every time. Not a single complaint about that. Large portions always make you take home a doggy bag. The drinks are pricey but optional. The meals are reasonably priced. Line-ups (waiting times) are long but that's because its worth waiting for.
Terry C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,4,5.0,3/19/2015,"Ask for sassy Jessica for your server!  She is awesome!!!!!  Best server ever .  Very attentive. Ask for clucker. They will know who you mean. Oh, the food and drinks were great too!"
Hideyo K.,"Camp Pendleton North, CA",176,118,91,4.0,4/20/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory hardly needs any introduction. This one is located in the busiest part of Waikiki and is huge. Despite its capacity though, it's always packed with people especially at dinner time, and on weekends the line can extend outside with a waiting period of up to two hours. I always took issue with their no-reservations policy, but despite this and the often lengthly waiting period, I do enjoy sitting down for a meal here. If you're the impatient type, at least you can phone in an order and pick it up within twenty minutes even when it's busy, which I imagine would be a useful factoid for tourists staying in Waikiki. The menu is the most extensive I've ever seen at any restaurant (I don't know how the servers manage) and is one of the reasons why this place is one of my favorite major chains. I made it my goal to try everything on their menu, but thank goodness I'm over that phase. By now, I've tried about a quarter of the food on their menu, which really is enough. For lunch, I do enjoy their Grilled Salmon. The dinner portion is kind of pricy, but the lunch portion turned out to be more than enough to get full with. I usually order it ""Simply Grilled"" with broccoli and brown rice, but you can also get a Miso-flavored and a Crusted Filet version, neither of which are particularly that good here. I think simply grilled is the way to go if you genuinely like salmon or fish in general. I've also enjoyed their Shepherd's Pie on more than one occasion since it offers a generous portion of ingredients with spectacularly tasting sauce, beef mince, and mashed potato. Hardly a complicated dish, which makes it a safe bet when you're looking for quantity (the dinner portion, though I eat it by myself, can definitely be shared by two). Most of the pasta and pizza is pretty good, too. I also enjoy their Pineapple Mojito's every now and then even though it's often mixed differently, but then The Cheesecake Factory is nothing if not for their desserts. There are a couple sundaes and smoothies on the menu, but if you're ever here, you MUST try their cheesecake. Fresh Strawberry is the simplest and safest thing you can get, but I'm a chocolate lover. I NEED my chocolate. Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake is pretty awesome and is most appropriate around Halloween time. You can also get a good chocolate fix with their 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake without compromising on your addiction to plain old cheesecake too, since this one has distinct layers of both in it, along with a hefty load of chocolate icing. But alas, the one chocolate cheesecake that satisfies me completely is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. It's the best, and the flavor is so rich, even I have to eat a slice in increments over the course of a week. Decisions, decisions, decisions. . .  As it is so easy to become overwhelmed by their colossal dining and dessert menu, I truly recommend previewing their menu online or taking with you a take-out menu before sitting down for a meal. After a long wait gripping that eternal buzzer, you wouldn't want to add to your waiting time by waltzing in without a plan, after all. . ."
Rachell Y.,"Ewa Beach, HI",13,3,7,5.0,2/13/2016,Yummy!!! Cheesecake!! So much people outside waiting for a table!! But we didn't have to wait long.. Atmosphere is casual and busy... I like that it's dark and not so bright.. I  it
Kate R.,"Honolulu, HI",1,7,1,4.0,4/29/2015,"perfect place for deserts. except that A/C is dripping. Overall, loved their rocky road ice cream."
Diane L.,"Honolulu, HI",1,55,6,3.0,2/7/2015,"Big portions, which means entrees and desserts. After my meal I am so full that I barely make a dent in my cheesecake."
W. M.,"Fremont, CA",1,60,4,5.0,1/11/2016,Really nice one!!!! Love the atmosphere and service here. They are almost always busy in the evening. If you don't have the patience to wait long then this place isn't for you. I def. think it's worth waiting. Mahalo :)
Olivia R.,"Niles, IL",27,166,194,4.0,8/10/2013,Just like the one in IL:) feeling like im home...
Rod G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",29,52,,2.0,12/26/2012,"i have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory many times in California and never been disappointed.  I cannot say the same for the one in downtown Honolulu. They don't take reservations or call aheads. It was first come first serve only.  When we arrived, the line was well outside the door.  After 20 minutes in line we discovered there were actually two lines.  The first was to put in your name and the second was to get a beeper.   We were told it would be a 1 hour 7 minute  wait.  I checked in after 1 hour and 20 minutes, to find why we hadn't heard from them.  I was told they were ""running a little behind"", and that it would be another 25 minutes.   I checked in after another 40 minutes to ask  why we still hadn't heard from them.  I'm not sure that they didn't know that it would be in excess of a 2 hour wait but just gave customers those ""estimates"" knowing that after someone had already invested more  than 1.5 hours, they would stick around for ""another 25 minutes"". They finally seated us  without the beeper ever going off.  We had to wait quite a while for our server.  We waited even longer for our appetizers. The salads and avocado rolls were fresh and perfectly prepared.   We waited far far too too long for our main course.  When it arrived, two of the meals were acceptable, a third one had a steak that was hot but the salmon was barely over room temperature.  My Macadamia Ono had obviously been sitting in the window for quite a while as the fish was only slightly warm, under seasoned and a little dried out.  My brown rice had no warm to it at all.  The vegetables were perfectly cooked but near cold like the fish and rice.  I finally gave up and told them to just bag it and I'd reheat and doctor it at home.   We next ordered desert.  All they would have to do is cut it and serve right?  How wrong could that go?  When the server checked back with us, he had a distressed look on his face when he realized that after nearly 15 minutes that course not been delivered in anything close to a timely manner either.   The Red Velvet Cheesecake was really good.  I think the reason it took so long to deliver this course to the table is that they must have run out of desert plates. The cheesecake was chilled as it should be, but the dishes were hot.  I'm guessing fresh out of the dish washer. In total our dinner adventure took 4.5 hours.  The manager knocked off the charge for the appetizer and a starter salad to help defray the cost of the parking lot overtime charges. Will I return to the Cheesecake Factory?  In California yes, in Hawaii ... not a chance."
