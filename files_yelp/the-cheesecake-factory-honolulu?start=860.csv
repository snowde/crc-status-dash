Joe H.,"Lenzie, United Kingdom",59,83,160,4.0,9/2/2013,"First port of call when we go to Honolulu, without fail. Menu has changed a few times over the past couple of years & favourites taken off (Cajun 24hr marinated Rib-Eye steak being one & my favourite!). The queues.. they've not changed in the slightest.  Still insane to get seated at peak times, but hey - thats always the case in this location for a lot of restaurants. Meals are consistently good - not outstanding.  Don't get ambitious in your appetite either.  The portions are very HEALTHY!  We just manage one starter to share, two mains & cheesecake TO GO!  Always have a cheesecake here.. It's whats the place is called after all! I've eaten at this chain here, San Francisco & Austin, Texas.  Slight regional differences in the menu, which is good to see.  The cheesecake, remains the same though.   You Gotta Eat Here - for sure! :-D"
Bianca Y.,"Mountain View, HI",5,13,2,3.0,2/1/2015,never ever order the kids mac and cheese... It was sour and u could taste that it wad made from powder.  Dinned here many times..always get the sweet corn tamale cakes... This past experience hmmmm..not the same.  The cakes were delicious but sauce way offf. My man had the mushroom burger and was pleased.  Waiter was excellent!!
Todd T.,"Honolulu, HI",55,292,62,3.0,11/10/2012,"Walked in at 5:20pm and was told the wait would be 20 minutes, after I got the pager and walked out of restaurant the pager went off 10 seconds later, I thought it was a mistake but the table was ready.  Being a Friday night I thought it would be a long wait.  I guess its best to eat dinner there from 5-530pm to avoid the long waits that can be up to 90 minutes or longer. We had a few appetizers and drinks.  The waiter kept on stopping by to see if we weree going to order entrees but we were getting full since we ordered 5 appetizers.  The portions are large. We started to slow down finishing our food and the server started clearing our dishes away.  Then he dropped the check before we asked for it.  We felt rushed."
Foodie On T.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,92,37,3.0,12/2/2014,"1&1/2 hr wait ? I though well this better be outstanding. It wasn't it was very middle America boring . The fried chicken sliders were tasty but the drinks were very expensive ! 30% for the same glass of wine else were . The service was good. In fact I really felt sorry for our waitress , what a zoo this place was."
Sandra N.,"Vancouver, Canada",258,61,109,3.0,8/27/2011,"FOR ANYONE COMING HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME: YOU MUST TRY A CHEESECAKE HERE!! This always-busy location doesn't take reservations, so on any given night it's at least a 45-minute wait. And nothing bothers me more than watching tourists eat here after a long wait and NOT ordering a cheesecake. Cheesecake Factory has SO many dishes to choose from, I never understand how they're able to get food out fast. This is the biggest location I've ever been to. I ate the ""Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich"" with a salad which is one of the few veggie options available. Very tasty, but it kind of fell apart after a while because it was super juicy. I ended off with the Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake which was perfect because I was craving chocolate and wanted something lighter without unnecessary layers of cake. They put way too much whipped cream for my taste, but the cheesecake never disappoints. I ate about 3/4 of it myself, so it would have been finished if my dining companion had helped me out. The service here gets 5 stars, but with such a massive menu I don't think their food will ever get to fine dining status. I'd like to try some of their other non-cheesecake desserts, but it's so difficult NOT to get a cheesecake since they have so many kinds."
Darren N.,"Honolulu, HI",102,350,,4.0,10/17/2010,"Getting there:  Easy to find and parking can be found cheaply with validation at the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center garage. Ambiance:  Dark but due to the hustle and bustle, it is difficult to carry intimate conversation.  Live music plays at times as well, but not featured stuff. Service: Very courteous and helpful wait staff.  They go the extra mile in keeping water levels, food quality checks, and even parking validation for you. Food: Typical fare for the chain restaurant.  Pasta portions are very generous but reflects the price.   If the dish isn't naturally heavy, the portions will definitely feed you for more than one meal.  If you like pasta and cheesecake, this is obviously the place to go but they also have other foods.  The menu has many choices and their specialty drinks are fruity and varied. Who to bring: Any sized party works, but larger parties probably have a longer wait. How much to bring: Enough to pay for a full tank of gas. Verdict: Four stars for the food, portions, and cheesecake desserts.  I wouldn't go to this place too often given the wait and price but definitely a good place to get a satisfying variety of food. Final notes: Weekend dinners are often an hour  wait I think.  Be prepared, this place is always busy."
Jasmine N.,"Honolulu, HI",480,267,268,4.0,10/2/2012,"A solid 3.5 stars After being fatty status yesterday for lunch my co-worker and I decided to have a salad.  We called up The Cheesecake Factory and ordered the BBQ ranch chicken salad.   Ran over to get it.  FYI the take out pick up is at the bakery (Where they sell the cheesecakes).  The staff was polite.  It was just as we ordered with salad dressing on the side.  We also asked for vinaigrette which we got no problem.  Plus complementary bread.  YUM!   We ordered the full size and it was HUGE.  Three of us could have shared the salad.  It had a lot of stuff on it, chicken, avocado, black beans, tomatoes, corn, onion rings, croutons.  Yum-o.   No wait + good food = good deal. 31 yelps - 2/31"
Jason Q.,"Kaneohe, HI",35,101,13,3.0,11/25/2014,"I finally had my first Cheesecake Factory experience.  The menu is like a book.  A lot to read and a lot of choices.  And, yes, the portions are big.  For me personally, I prefer an average sized portion of something amazing over a big portion of something that is just okay.  To me, the food at this place is just okay.  It tasted ordinary, and definitely did not provide me with a ""Wow"" factor.  On the plus side, the service is good, and the wait for lunch is not too bad."
Nicole K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/12/2015,"Been to Honolulu a few times and every time I come, I have to eat at Cheesecake Factory.. portions are huge for the price, I always bring leftovers back to the hotel! There server Joe is amazing!! He made us feel so comfortable and he spoke to us not as if we were ""another customer"" but as if we were real ohana and he treated us amazingly being very kind in a sincere way!"
Nona D.,"Honolulu, HI",53,2,1,5.0,1/21/2015,"My gfs were in town & wanted to take me out to dinner & they chose cheesecake. Our waitress was Cecine M super nice girl, come to find out she's from the same area as my friends & I in California & was super friendly with all of us & gave my friends suggestions on where to snorkel & a bunch of other touristy things & hooked it up with her friends number for snorkeling. Excellent service"
Kylie P.,"Kapolei, HI",0,1,,4.0,2/23/2016,"Good food and everything but I mean, my boyfriend and I are 20 and I guess we look young but seriously we dressed up and everything for valentines day and we paid like $70 for dinner here and this is really rare for us, to go out and dress up and spend this much, and we really felt like little kids in there. We felt like our server didnt believe we could afford our dinner, and we felt like we were being watched the whole time which is expected for good service like its good that theyre attentive, but we felt like a huge inconvenience to them and it was really hard to get past that during our dinner, but we tipped them well anyway. Good food goes a long way~"
Missy S.,"Honolulu, HI",8,91,141,4.0,9/21/2011,About damn time I tried this place! Very nice experience for me. Although I do recommend only dining during lunch times. Dinner time is almost impossible. But I ordered the Salisbury steak with potatos and green beans. It was very good. Next time I really need to try their cheesecake.
Kobe O.,"Honolulu, HI",248,162,77,5.0,9/14/2013,"Man, I can never go wrong at the place. The food is good, huge portions, and the free bread is amazing and endless. The place is a little dark, noisy, and the prices seem to have gone up alot (what stands out is almost $8 for a piece of cheesecake). I think this, like many of the other mainland chain stores in Hawaii, is the #1 sales producer in the States.  Always crowded and if you don't get there before 5pm, a guaranteed wait. Some things we like - chinese chicken salad, shepherds pie, cheesecake, salmon, angel hair pasta with shrimp, sliders. Finally tried the orange chicken (I know, just get it at Panda) and was mildly impressed.  Actually tasted better the next day for some reason. Lunch has the best deals......I would pass on the mini entrees and spend a couple dollars more for the full size.......the extra amount you get is way more than the few dollars and you have lunch or snack for later. If you also want to get a validation stamp with no questions asked.....this is the place.  So crowded and chaotic, they can't tell if your legit or not."
Wayne S.,"Denver, CO",1,61,,5.0,11/20/2013,"I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but you don't have much of a choice in Waikiki.  The hostess was particularly rude, however, the manager and server more than made up for her. Wayne, the manager, and Joni, our server, were top notch.  We had 4 adults and 4 children.  We were celebrating a 3-year old birthday.  Wayne made sure we were seated in a reasonable time, and Joni was fantastic with the kids.  Wayne made sure we had a red velvet cheesecake defrosted in time for our dinner.  And, did I say how fantastic Joni was? Although I have said I am not a fan of chain restaurants, I will definitely go back to this one.  In fact, I might even try the Denver location! Thanks to Wayne and Joni!!!"
G. H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,9,4.0,2/16/2014,"The bad news:  Ok so we always go to Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu as we live here. Often we get ""to go"" as it is so convenient, especially because they are so busy. Why so busy? The food is outstanding. ALTHOUGH recently they are lacking... We always would order the combo platter (sauces to die for) of Steak Diane/Shrimp Scampi. We've been ordering this dish all over the country (as we are travelers) and it is outstanding. Now a change??? You see it used to be with the side of mashed potatoes you could exchange for free the fettuccine Alfredo. This goes much better with it anyway!!! NOW they charge $3.99 if you want to trade! Bad. THEN they change the steak. It used to be 3 nice medallions of steak. Tender, great cut. Now it's only a few little ""hunks"" of meat. Barely a bite for approx. $22. Sooo we are now not ordering that favorite meal anymore. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY???  Next the good news... kinda... we had a very bad experience with a waiter. Short, nasty, clumping the plate down, cold food -- we were told by another staff member he left the food on the line because he HAD to wait for our fettuccine Alfredo to be cooked.... so... he left his shift for the day. Lucky for us. We had to send the cold food back. Marshall Freedman the Manager came out and couldn't have been nicer. He accommodated us this one time and did not charge the surprise $3.99 charge to change to fettuccine Alfredo. JEREMY J was our new waiter. He went above and beyond and is a great asset to this facility. The ending was good. Unfortunately we won't buy our favorite combo anymore due to the above aforementioned quality and upcharge of substitute. That is sad for us.   PLEASE NOTE THE RATING I GAVE THIS IS FOR THIS MEAL ONLY. EVERYTHING ELSE (to my knowledge now that I am trying other meals like the wonderful salads!) are great.  I recommend TAKE OUT! SO EASY!!! Go to the beach and enjoy a sunset!"
Ka'ili H.,"Omaha, NE",235,381,194,5.0,9/12/2010,"what do you get when you put three best friends together ( after many moons of not hanging out), good food, good waitress, and no wait for a table????!!!  A raucous of laughter and pidgin laced story telling of the current events in our lives. Let's start with our arrival:  got to cheesecake right after work, around 4:50pm, due to anxious hunger in our tummies & excitement to see each other again.   Hosts & Hostesses were waiting patiently to seat people coming in, took us inside to a booth about 4:55pm.  Menu: tough tough decisions. go healthy? eat whatever your heart desires cuz hey you haven't seen your gals in eons?  i decide on the special: ginger crusted salmon with bok choy in some kind of ginger cream sauce, and BROWN RICE. The universe has finally blessed this place with brown rice on THE day we chose to eat here! chee hee!  One of my friends got the Kobe burger with mushrooms & sweet potato fries, my other friend ordered the club sandwich with side french fries.  We each gave a two thumbs up to our meals.  For me the exception was the sauce, it was a bit tart for my taste buds & a bit too gingery,it made me wish i ordered a good old burger, but then, I was trying to be healthy! Sweet potato fries were a WINNER! Crispy & sweet and full of yummy goodness! We just had to order dessert, cuz that's just how we do.  I ordered the Reese's cake cheesecake because they are donating 25 cents to a charity and my friend got the red velvet cheesecake, we shared amongst us.  The Reese's cheescake was really rich and whoah good.   The peanut butter made it thick & the nuts at the end were a bit of a surprise.  Overall it was nice to deviate from my favorite cheesecake, the Kahlua cocoa chocolate (coffee?) cheesecake.  It was surprising richer than the red velvet concoction.   Red velvet, you can't really go wrong with that one. Customer service:  Our waitress was on it! She knew the specials and was extremely friendly.  She was patient with us and had a great sense of humor since our dinner together brought out the sillyness in us.  Our food came out in a timely manner, and she remembered our request for straws and always smiled.  Our waitress helped make our dinner even better. And that, my friends, is what happens when you put best friends, good food, and great service together.  A winning review and amazing memories."
Kirsten R.,"Waipahu, HI",102,37,27,4.0,8/15/2013,"I love this restaurant, the food is awesome, the quantity they give you is huge! And of course the cheesecakes are yummy! I've never seen such huge cheesecakes! We have been here four different times, probably would've been more but we live on the leeward side of the island.. The wait staff is super helpful as well, always making sure your needs are met!"
Loren S.,"Kapolei, HI",2,8,2,3.0,1/8/2015,We used to come here once a week almost. Service and quality is falling apart. 3 years ago I'd give 5 stars. New management?
Shari T.,"Ala Moana, Honolulu, HI",1,3,12,4.0,3/27/2014,"Although the wait is a long one, there are enough shops in the area to pass the time. And, as my 13 year-old put it, the pasta carbonara is worth the wait!"" Large menu, lots of variety, & great live music with 2 local guys!"
Kay L.,"Midway Point, Australia",3,2,,3.0,4/26/2015,"Recommended by a friend. Great place if you are hungry, I only ordered an appetiser and couldn't finish, my partner who can eat a big meal didn't finish all of his 2 courses either. Traditional American food, better than average and yes you have to wait but we just went to a bar for an hour and came back at the allotted time. System works well. Good prices lots of food, you can't go wrong."
