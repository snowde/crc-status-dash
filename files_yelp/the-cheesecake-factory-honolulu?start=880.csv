Jessica M.,"Honolulu, HI",105,124,5,4.0,11/2/2012,"A friend of my boyfriend decided to have her birthday party here last night.  There were 27 people and they don't take reservations.  I smelled disaster.  What was very surprising was that they managed to get us in in about an hour, which was about the usual wait even with only a few people.  I thought for sure that the service would be disastrous and that the checks would take over an hour to sort out and that we would be captured there practically overnight against our wills.  Well, what was even more surprising was that everything was extremely quick and efficient.  The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and quick and they paid attention to detail. There were 27 of us, and each and every person got their correct drink, correct food, correct check, and everything was on time and quick.  I was amazed at the efficiency!  Our waitress was so nice and stayed on top of everything. The inside of the restaurant is very nice.  It's actually very beautiful if I do say so myself.  I normally don't like chains, but I was impressed. The food was good. There are a lot of choices, and of COURSE the cheesecake was to die for.   If you have a big group and you want efficiency along with your good food, choose Cheesecake factory in Waikiki. I can see why this is the highest grossing cheesecake factory in the nation."
Logan M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,13,,4.0,4/4/2013,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Lines were long as expected, but we were seated in 15 minutes. I think because they were only 2 of us, we got in quicker. The seating was so tight. There was probably just a couple of feet between myself and the person that was seated next to me.  Started with the spicy ahi tempura for our appetizer. BF loved it. I thought it was okay. I ordered the Bang bang chicken and shrimp. I remembered it being a little spicier, which I love, but this time around it was pretty mild. BF had the ribeye steak. It looked juicy, and it must have been good because I don't remember getting to taste any of it. Too full for dessert, but we can't leave without any cheesecake, so a couple of slices to go please!  We parked at the Royal Hawaiian, had it validated, and paid a buck! What a bargain for Waikiki!"
Myron B.,"Auckland, New Zealand",45,9,2,4.0,1/4/2015,I love the Cheesecake Factory.  In Honolulu the food is just as good as that in the Mainland...and in a Prime location.  This can be a good thing and not so good thing as you need to be prepared to wait up to 45mins for a table.  Luckily there's lots to do in the area while you wait.
Jeff G.,"Selfkant, Germany",14,51,3,2.0,8/7/2014,"Expensive, long wait too. Food was meh.... Drinks were weak, not on the beach either."
Brittany B.,"Anchorage, AK",9,80,,4.0,8/28/2014,"First off, the food is amazing! The drinks are over priced though. Love their lunch menu, and great pizza, mac and cheese appetizer, and of course their cheesecake. It was nice inside, liked the decor and view out back, but my table was right next to us, not very private. Decent prices. Overall, impressed."
Sandy Q.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",21,893,21,4.0,10/31/2014,"This review is long over due (2005).  My husband and I visited Hawaii for our anniversary and on our last day, we came here for lunch.  I ordered a shrimp & chicken dish that said spicy and I requested it to be less spicy.  After I placed my order, the manager came to our table.  He asked what my tolerance level was for spicy food and I told him it was average.  He explained to me that the dish isn't that spicy and they can't adjust the spices; otherwise, it would be flavorless.  After his explanation, I decided to let them cook the food as it's supposed to.  The food came out great.  It had tons of flavor and it was not spicy at all.  Customer service was excellent.  I've requested this dish in the California before with the same request but the restaurant never told me that you can't adjust the flavors to the dish.  Usually, they'll just cook it their way without letting you know."
Tazu A.,"Haiku, HI",10,15,9,1.0,7/10/2014,"The atmosphere is great, the cheesecakes are awesome, never thought an experience could turn out so bad. Got some sort of Moroccan Chicken dish. The chicken was tough, with sauce that tasted like Tabasco and salsa mixed together. This dish came with couscous that was under cooked or just old. Worst dish I've ever had. Also we had an extremely rude blonde waiter, who made sure to tell us that the bill we got didnt include a tip, who does that?! We are from Hawaii and grew up here, not sure why she was such a grinch. We were a party of three and had had a long tiresome day she's lucky we didn't talk to her manager.  We tipped well and left despite the horrible ordeal."
S. R.,"Honolulu, HI",6,91,12,4.0,3/1/2013,They recently re opened and we all had a nice time for dinner.  The wait was 90 minutes so we window shop around royal hawn shop center.  They give you a buzzer to alert you when table ready.  Food pretty good.  Next time I would order the pork chops .. it looked really good and was a good serving size.  came with mashed potatoe and veggies.  The mexican dish looked great too! All the cheesecakes are scrumpcious .. The banana cheesecake was wonderful so I took most of it home for later.  Big size and very filling. I think they should offer mini cheesecakes and assortment would be nice. I will be back again!
Chris C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,3,1.0,7/25/2016,"I went there on one Saturday night with my family.  There were 9 people in our family.  We came in at 6:30pm and were told the table should be ready in 2 hours.  We got called around 9:30pm which was about 3 hour-wait.  When we walked in, they gave us two separate tables.  We have 4 kids and it was difficult for us to share food and take care of the kids.  We told them we need to sit altogether. OK, there was another wait of 20 mins in order to sit together. We finally got our table at almost 10:30pm.  There were two tiny tables and could barely fit 9 chairs.  At least we could all sit together.  However, the service was not very good.  Less than one hour after we got our food.  Several of our plates were taken away by the waitress without asking us if we FINISH OR NOT.  Also, we ask for breads couple times without success because the answer was ""the kitchen is so busy and I already do my best to give you the bread"".   We finished our ""DINNER"" almost 12am.  The experience before was good.  I guess they were too busy on Saturday night so couldn't keep up the service and quality."
Daisy K.,"Pasadena, CA",877,1020,283,3.0,5/23/2011,"This place is a goddamn zoo. I know it's in the middle of Waikiki Beach & all the shopping, but holy...  Came here around 9:30 and it was still a 1 hour wait and nearly everyone was asking for a 2 person reservation. We walked around for a bit to kill time. There are plenty of shops for you to check out while you wait -- especially if it's your first night in Waikiki.  Once you're inside, you realize how big the place is. The sign says you can fit something like ~560 people in here and even at 10pm the place is filled to the brim. Food is just like other Cheesecake Factories but the fish seemed more fresh than others. Perhaps it's because the food isn't sitting out as long like it would in other locations because of the high turnover of food. Overall awesome meal, good service -- just wish it wasn't so crowded!"
Ilene B.,"Honolulu, HI",28,39,31,4.0,7/6/2014,"Played it safe and went with the Americana Burger it is awesome asked for the special sauce on the side. Just your basic mayo ketchup mix. I prefer just ketchup. Partner ordered the salmon lunch plate and substituted potatoes for a Caesar salad,,, the broccoli wasn't cold and no croutons for the salad. They replaced the broccoli and brought more croutons so they redeemed themselves. All and all a 4"
Jill W.,"Roseville, CA",0,32,,5.0,3/14/2015,"Busy location (hour wait, but shopped to pass time).. Received excellent service from our waiter Alex. Never had to ask for more water or wait for anything. He proves my point that a great waiter can and should deliver great service no matter how busy the place gets! Food was great, great prices (swear their prices are CHEAPER for the same menu items I get here in Ca)."
Amanda S.,"Seaside, CA",0,6,1,3.0,2/10/2016,"We love Cheesecake Factory, but this location always has a very long wait. We waited 70 minutes for a table for two on a Wednesday night. I ordered the Endive Salad as a starter, which was delicious. My husband order the Chipotle Chicken sandwich and I ordered the Chipotle Chicken pasta. The pasta was perfectly prepared (the chicken was a little grisly, but that was the only downside); noodles and vegetables to perfection, chicken seasoned and tenderly cooked. Amazing. My husband was shocked at the size of his sandwich. Portions are definitely large enough to share. Service was a little slow, but she was very friendly and checked on us frequently. My biggest beef, aside from the wait, is how LOUD it is in the restaurant.  The room can literally be half empty and the sound just magnifies and bounces off the walls. Definitely not a good restaurant if you want to have a conversation with your dinner date, but the food and dessert are delicious!"
Tiffany M.,"Honolulu, HI",44,194,119,3.0,11/14/2012,"Double date dinner with the cousin :) I would like to start off with the Pros of this restaurant.  Of course the cheesecake is to die for.  I like the decor, very chic and classy.  I also like the customer service.  Our waitress was very attentive.  She kept asking if everything was alright, was quick to service us, and brought us 2 loafs of bread while we waited. What I don't like about The Cheesecake Factory was the wait.  They don't take reservations.  Our party of 4 arrived on a Sunday at 5:30 PM and the wait for still 30 minutes at that time :( We couldn't sit inside and wait because there were so many people there, so we went outside to wait and talk story to past the time.  Also, it was very loud that day.  I am unsure if this place gets very loud, but the atmosphere just wasn't right for a Sunday Night Dinner with the Hubby.  I wish it wasn't that crowded and loud."
Halei J.,"Burnaby, Canada",823,207,1649,3.0,8/12/2012,"I don't really know what the big fuss about this place is. People seem to love it, there's always a line up and it's always busy. Hmmmm even my cousin who lives here loves it and when he goes on holidays he'll always go to a Cheesecake if they have one in that state. I think it's just average, huge menu, good service but nothing really spectacular. I know the portions are very generous and it's quite reasonably priced but still.....the cheesecake...it's ok, i've had better......maybe cuz it's in Waikiki,,,dunno."
Resi K.,"Antioch, CA",93,52,5,4.0,11/23/2014,We only purchased slices of cheesecake as the wait time for dinner reservations was hour half. The line for cakes was long but the workers have it down to a science. The cakes were between $7-10 per slice.we did take out and the whip cream made it all the way home so that was a plus.
J O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,16,1.0,12/19/2015,"We got in right away for lunch hoping for brunch but to find out the item I wanted was only offered on Sunday. We ordered a sandwich and hamburger. It was OK. For over 12 dollars I expected more. Our waiter seemed angry with us, not sure why. Maybe because we sat down and ordered food and asked for sugar?? He never acknowledged us after our food was brought, in fact he always looked pissed or annoyed when he walked by our table. But for some reason he loved the people at the next table and checked on them regularly and asked if they needed anything. Not worth going back."
Karen E.,"Honolulu, HI",84,120,139,5.0,6/14/2013,"I have no idea why it has taken me this long to write a review.  Besides Kailua I am always in Waikiki.   And what better way to spend my time here but to dine at The Cheesecake Factory!  I have been coming here way before my yelp review days and even before Forever 21 was right across from their entrance.  I think it use to be Town&Country Surf or something like that.  Oh and way before they remodeled the whole Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center.  Needless to say I really love eating here.Decor is second to none.  I love how  you can dine outdoors and do some people watching or indoors to enjoy the beautiful wood trimming on the ceiling and what looks like hand painted art on the walls.  It might be just wallpaper but who cares I love the look of it.  It is usually a little dim if you dine here in the evenings but during brunch or the day it is perfect lighting.Now wait time depends on when you come here to eat.  During the day it's not so bad but the evening and especially during the weekends it is busy!  They take down your name and you are handed a pager and the usual time is 45 minute wait.  There are some benches on the side with cusions to sit on while you wait but good luck on finding one that's not already claimed.  There is also a rock wall you can sit on right across from the entrance but after awhile your butt starts to get real sore.  Then there is always Forever 21 for the ladies and guys too.  If you have read my review my other reviews my husband who is a metro type of dude has purchased serveral things from here but will not admit it to his friends.  Last if you have read up to this part of the review you  would be lucky enough to know the secret of waiting at the most 30 minutes for a table or less.  This tip is for you people that have kids 5 or 6 years and older or a small group of friends 4 or 5 tops.  Before I had my baby it was just my husband, my older daughter 7 yrs old, and myself coming in to dine.  Instead of getting a regular table we would head down to the high bar tables that are located right behind the bar counter.  There are about four or five tables with four chairs at each table and it is first come first serve basis.  So if you see an empty table grad it quick because there are sometimes others stalking for a table too.  Now if you have five people in your party hopefully you can grab one of the empty bar chairs.  They serve you drinks from the bar and the whole menu and you wait half the time for a table then having to go through the whole getting a pager and waiting FOREVER!!!  Reward for reading my review.  And if you already knew about my little secret then I'll move on to the best part the FOOD. Appetizers -Ahi Poke Salad --Deep Fried Mac&Cheese----Crazy goodness here!  You get four deep fried balls of mac&cheese over a red sauce I'm assuming it's marinara --Lettuce Wraps---I thinks it's chicken or is it pork...I forgot but this plate is huge --Nachos----Order only one plate of this.  WARNING you will not finish this so make sure you share.  Whatever you can imagine is on these nachos. Entrees --Chicken Alfredo---Cheesy saucey goodness.  Enough said. Oh and chicken --Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato Fries --Shirmp Club Sandwich with Fries--Shirmp is perfectly cooked, bacon, turkey, and whatever else goes on a regular club sandwich --I want to say Chicken Marsala but it's one of their popular plates.  I remember eating a pasta also with marsala I think it was raviloli but yes their pasta plates are great also --Hawaiian Pizza--I love ham and pineapples --Kalua Pizza--Shreaded porky goodness --Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich--Lots of flavor, Huge, very crispy, THE BEST chicken sandwich you will ever have tried --Bang Band Chicken and Shirmp--It comes with rice.  If you like Thai food this is a good choice Desserts --Cheesecake is their main dessert so here a list that I've tried and I will mention if I like it or not Oreo Cheesecake--Don't like it... Too Sweet for my taste Reese Cheesecake--Another one I don't care for too sweet Dulce De Leche--I have ordered this everytime ever since I found out that it has the perfect balance of creamy rich cheesecake and dulce yumminess Key Lime--It's a little tart but not too much Vanilla Bean--If you don't like the regular cheesecake with the sour cream this is the next best thing Banana Cream--I love this cheesecake.  It is the first cheesecake I had from here and it is light if you don't want something too rich Strawberry--It is a classic combo can't go wrong Original--Comes with sour cream topping.  I love the sour and sweet combo."
Jackie C.,"Waipahu, HI",6,5,7,5.0,11/17/2013,Celebrated cousins bday last night. Ordered the shrimp bistro n cookie dough cheesecake. ..so onolicious! Great service can't wait to go back.
Andrew C.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",0,14,20,5.0,2/27/2014,Very excellent Mia Tia good taste and presentation. The upside down pineapple cheese cake is something to not miss while here on Waikiki. Sometimes there is a long wait try to get there before busy meal times.
