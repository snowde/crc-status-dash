Justin Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,786,158,4.0,4/17/2011,"I can't remember the last time I ever went to Cheesecake factory in LA. In fact I make it a habit not to good cause I think it's over-priced and I can get far better food elsewhere. But when in Hawaii and you've been abroad in China for the past 9 months. You gotta go big and there is no other place to go big than Cheesecake in Hawaii.  Location: On the Waikiki strip. It's right next to the Apple store Staff: Extremely friendly Wait: It wasn't that long. Then again we ate around 8:30-9pm. This place is always packed and crowded. When I mean always I mean always. Supposedly, it's the busiest Cheesecake in the world and I can see why. Though, if you get lucky you won't have to wait too long. They give you a little pager and it starts flashin' Food: Good. Had the roadside sliders (Biggest sliders, I've seen at any restaurant and I'm a huge fan of sliders. I always get them wherever I go) Decent Fetticuine Alfredo. Definitely not the best but not the worst. Good size portions  Bi-lingual menus: HUGE plus.... I was extremely surprised when they actually brought out the Chinese menus. The group I was with were all Chinese nationals who couldn't read a lick of English so I was equally surprised when the waiter brought out these menus which made orderin so much better.  Ambiance: If you're not used to dim settings and loud places to eat than this place is not for you.  Tax: 4.15 or something to that nature. If you have a party bigger than 7 it's included.  *Waitress was friendly and took our picture. Don't forget to tip Accordingly."
Vince L.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,677,280,3.0,3/30/2011,"Why is there always a huge line here?!  It amazes me that folks travel all the way to Hawaii to eat at a national chain. It reminds of tourists who go to France or Italy and wind up eating their coffee fix at the local Starbucks. Where is the adventure in that?  To be fair in writing this review, I went there to get a slice of cheesecake and to get a chance to see what the commotion is about.  It took 30 minutes to get a slice of cheesecake to go!  I could've baked one myself in about the same time."
Kate D.,"Springfield, VA",37,24,1,5.0,8/28/2013,"Visiting from Kauai, we don't have a Cheesecake Factory on island. Back home, I had one 15 minutes from my house so naturally I ate there 3 times! Hahaha. Went there with my boyfriend and got the Kalua pork pizza with a side salad. Both were sad. The pizza was dry. My boyfriend got the crusted chicken Romano which was AMAZE BALLS. Next I got the chicken marsala which is always my favorite. It was sooooo freaking good. Then for my last meal, I got the French Country salad which is one of my faves. Its an appetizer, but I eat it as a meal. Its filling. It has mixed greens, goat cheese, beets, candied pecans and grilled asparagus.  Bread was good, servers seemed kinda sad, but were on point.  Great food so that makes up for everything."
Mellisa C.,"Honolulu, HI",5,11,,2.0,8/26/2013,"I've tried this place twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch was a better experience,maybe because my expectations were not so high.  Went back for dinner with my hubby as I had raved about the lunch and we both love cheesecake! Mistake.. The wait was ridiculous! The line to even get the pager was unreal and full of rude shoving people. My food was great-cashew chicken, on the other hand my husband ordered a very expensive steak that wasn't fit to feed the dog. Both times the service was horrible and obvious we had a new waiter. Not only new to the establishment but waiting all together. Most places like this make wait staff take test on the menu and new staff generally shadows someone till they get it. Obviously not the case here! It's really too bad because the cheesecake is awesome! Since my husband buys and he was disgusted doubt ill ever have the cashew chicken again."
Anita C.,"Las Vegas, NV",241,251,114,3.0,3/25/2011,"Last night's original plan was to eat at Makittii (because I wanted lobster tails) but my friend was napping and took a long time to respond to my text.  When he finally responded, I was no longer in the mood to have buffet.  So I suggested Cheesecake factory for some weird reason because there's nothing there that I'm particularly craving.  So off we went to Waikiki! We parked at Royal Hawaiian Shopping center, free for 3 hours with validation, and proceeded to CF.  We got there by 8pm, was told the wait was an hour and 10 mins, put our names down and waited.  I called Yardhouse and some other places to see what their wait times were and they were all the same.  So we stayed and waited.  From my experience as a manager of many restaurants, the one thing we never did was give a shorter time than what we expected it to be, simply bcs we are guessing the wait time and if we sit ppl sooner than the given time, they will feel much happier.  But noooo, the restaurants here love bsing ppl about the wait time.  So we didn't get seated until 9:45.  By that time I was beyond starving, grumpy, cranky... just not bitchy. Our server didn't come around until 5 mins after we sat but he brought us bread when he came around, so that saved him.  We ordered, our drinks came out in a timely fashion, the runners were good and fast.   We shared the Asian Chicken Salad and the dressing was really gingerly (I'm not really into ginger - yes, I know, I'm Chinese, but alas I'm not into ginger, makes me sick if I eat chucks of it) and there was a ton of shredded green onions, I felt like I was eating more green onions than greens (was it even lettuce or napa cabbage?  I can't even tell since there hardly seem to be any ""salad"").  We had to wait another 10 minutes to flag down our server to get more dressing. I ordered the Steak Diane with the herb crusted Salmon and my friend ordered Steak Diane with the Shrimp.  I'm not sure but I felt like if we didn't share an app, I probably wouldn't have gotten full from the steak and salmon because the Steak Diane was chucks of steak instead of a whole piece, there were probably about 5 chucks - the sauce was a little sweet (I like sweeter sauces, so that suited me perfectly), I thought that the sauce for Diane's were suppose to be creamy...  Oh and the steak came out lukewarm borderline cool (wasn't going to send it back since we were HUNGRY!!)  The salmon was kind of small and the white sauce was a little bland, I had to add some salt to it.  The red potato mash covered almost half the plate!  but it was tasty and filling My friend ordered his steak medium but many pieces were med rare, I ordered mine med rare and received many med pieces, so we swapped - no biggie. I ordered Sangria and it was okay, nothing really special.  My friend ordered the Long Island Ice Tea and he said it was a little watered down.  For $10 a drink, I would hope that it'll be more than ok. We ordered cheesecake with strawberries to go. The pluses of the meal was the fresh, warm bread that they have - I love the dark one, so yummy!  I enjoy the decor and the lightening - it sets a really soothing mood.  CF, you've got that down packed! Next time I'm just going to stick to my favorites of Tamales and a pasta.  Oh, also coming earlier than 7pm!!"
Sherrill H.,"Honolulu, HI",8,32,17,2.0,11/1/2015,One hour wait to get seated. Service was great. The appetizers were delicious. A musician played and they were good. The entree.... Cashew chicken was awful. Tasted like they put the whole bottle of teriyaki sauce in the entree. Shrimp pasta with Arugula tasted like flower with tiny over cooked shrimps. Service recovery was good. Cheesecake was yummy.
Emma T.,"Wellington, New Zealand",0,20,,4.0,7/3/2014,"Have to give it 4 for the cheesecake. We went once for a meal and 3 more times for the cheesecake counter. This place is huge, beautifully decorated and this place is busy. We got wise to this and went shortly before 5pm, very early, I know but it worked. Later and you are queuing to get a buzzer to put you in the queue. Crazy. Husband had a pizza and declared it OK, very chain restaurant. Miss ordered a kids pizza but they were out of kid sized bases so she got an adult for kids price.  I had the best salad of my life and probably the hugest salad of my life, Sheila's Cashew Chicken Salad. It was so big, I would take a portion that size to a shared family meal. It was full of each ingredient and perfectly balanced, I will attempt to replicate. After our meals and being new to this Cheesecake Factory serving size thing, we ordered just two. I say that in jest as one would have been enough. We had the OREO® Dream Extreme Cheesecake and the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Both were lovely and enjoyed by all three of us. They loved up to expectations.  Other evenings we shared one slice between us from the take out counter, it is just inside the door on the right and you don't need to join the huge queue. We took the cheesecake up to the next level of the Royal Hawaiian Center and found a seat.  We had and enjoyed these cheesecakes- Godiva® Chocolate Cheesecake Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake™ (huge) Chocolate Raspberry Truffle®"
Stacey C.,"Kent, WA",73,39,19,2.0,7/24/2012,"Apparently the Cheesecake Factory is THE place to be because there was an hour and a half wait just to be seated. The group I went with was hungry so we went across the street to Jimmy Buffet's to wait and grab an appetizer but bad idea, don't do it. Not because Jimmy Buffet's was bad, it was nice, it's just that when we actually got our food at the Cheesecake Factory we had so much food we couldn't eat. One thing that is not helpful at all about the menu is that there are so many choices. Maybe too many as it took us forever to decide what we wanted to order. I wanted something light so I just ordered the Tomato Basil Pasta. The tomatoes were delicious, and it tasted really fresh, the chicken, however, was overcooked and not too appealing which seemed to be the consensus of everyone who had chicken in their dish. I also tried my friends Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic and the sauce was delicious! Can't really go wrong with garlic! The service was pretty good, our waiter was cheery and helpful. Sadly, we had no room for cheesecake."
Victoria W.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,2,1.0,1/25/2016,Tonight I sat at bar to get an order to go and it was very bad service and the shepherds pie was cold and sloshy.... I also ordered a chicken tortilla salad and two tortillas hard as a rock and chicken dried and hard... I was so disappointed because I usually love to go to this restaurant. I am hoping next time is a better experience... I think food was cold and hard because it sat for awhile while waiter chatted with younger ladies. I am an older lady who was ready to give a good tip until I waited and waited.
Patrick G.,"San Antonio, TX",107,801,35,3.0,12/23/2012,"I only stopped in here last night for some take out cheesecake for dessert and still could not escape the inconvenience that is going anywhere near The Cheesecake Factory.  I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory that doesn't have a huge line out the door and what seems like hundreds of people gathered out front.  I never understand why this is the case because once I've gone inside, I noticed how huge this restaurant is.  With such a huge restaurant, you'd think that there wouldn't be so many people waiting out front.  I guess there will just always be a two hour wait no matter how many seats there are inside.  This being said, I remind you I was only here for takeout dessert.  The total experience took about 20 minutes.  In that time, I waited in line patiently to get to the takeout counter.  I was walked into, stepped on, and hit by a flailing arm of a passerby.  Despite all of these hardships, I still waited in line for some cheesecake.  As I finally got closer to the counter, I was lucky enough to see inside the display case of all the different flavors that were available.  This was when the real fun began.  A group came in and disregarded the line that had formed at the counter and proceeded to yell in my ear about what they wanted, reach over my shoulder to tap the glass in the display case that I waited patiently to see, and then push me out of the way so that they could get a closer look and yell their order to the woman at the counter before me and the two people before me had even been helped. This entire experience reminded me why I try to stay clear of touristy areas.  Especially The Cheesecake Factory.  At least the cheesecake was delicious, and the best part was that I did not have to eat it anywhere near this restaurant."
Ajie P.,"Pearl City, HI",24,24,14,4.0,7/30/2012,"Saturday Night Tripple Date with the Best Friends! Came here around 9:30 pm, told that it would take 45 min to be seated but we got seated 20 min after :) yay! When they serve you the free bread with butter, they only put 1 brown bread ( tastier ) one.. I think they want us to fight for it or something lol, Well, to start it off, all six of us had the "" dead guy"" beer. we wanted to try it out since because we haven't tried it out. It was one of them dark beers. Tasted pretty crispy.. on an empty stomach, you can start feeling the buzz lol..Am i a lightweight? well then the women started ordering the blended alcoholic drinks..Including the Georgia Peach!!

Jarrett W.,"Honolulu, HI",185,62,4,4.0,6/23/2013,Only thing is the wait ranges 30-60mins long... all depends on time and day you are there.  I think this is one of the busiest Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  The one in Las Vegas-Henderson is no where this busy! Food and service was great.
Kris K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,3.0,11/16/2014,"We have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory several times over the past few weeks. The food is good,we enjoy the large selection of food, and the cheesecake is fabulous! Service has always been great.  However, last night was the worst experience ever. We had a short wait time, 30 minutes for a table. We were sat in a section the was just on the verge of outside, we waited and waited for our server to come to the table. Bread was brought before our waitress even showed up. When she finally came we ordered both drinks and food. Waters, a child juice and a martini. Thirty minutes later, I had to ask for our drinks. It was water!!! A table came in after us,they received their drinks and food BEFORE us. Every time we wanted something like more water we couldn't find our waitress. When our food finally arrived, it was obvious it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to come out to us. Our fries were not piping hot or fresh out of the fryer. My sandwich had started to get soggy on the bottom.  We were sat right underneath the AC vent that was dripping water with condensation on us throughout our dinner.  When mentioned to the staff it seemed as if they didn't care.  And finally, they DO NOT give military discounts."
Sara S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",31,52,16,4.0,9/2/2014,"Okay so this is my favorite restaurant on the island. The only sucky part is the wait which can be up to 2 hours sometimes since they're always super busy. But it's understandable, just inconvenient sometimes. Me & my fiancé have been going here for our anniversaries since our very first date, the food is amazing and there's a huge variety to choose from. The staff is super friendly every single time we've been there. It's very clean, which is a big one for me lol! It's prices are very fair, the food proportions are huge! I don't think I've ever finished my own plate xP overall, if your willing to wait a while to have a nice evening & great food, go here!"
Robert M.,"Mount Vernon, WA",0,1,,1.0,4/20/2014,"First of all the place was packed probably because of their slow sloth service. So we decide to go to the take n go which for anyone in my option is the only option at one of these places. Second there take n go line is not organized at all so we get cut in line by some sneaky bastards. Third I get hit in the arm by one of the hundred slothes who work their. Damn that hurt. Fourth the same lady who hit me yells at us to inform where the line is. Fifth my mom asks, ""can order here?"" Asian fat sarcastic bitch behind the cash machine say with an unwelcoming smile, """"You Could"""" My mom says to her ""Kindness"" She replies """"Cheese cake Cheese Cake Cheese Cake"""" The smile on this lady wanted to make me punch her square in the nose. I just got the hell out of there.. PS.... Get a drink menu for the take N Go people don't have time to ask for one."
Lester S.,"Waipahu, HI",1586,269,533,5.0,2/27/2015,What a fabulous place! People so friendly and the Food... Parking is at the Ewa Mauka side of the structure. There are different parking areas. Be sure to park in the right area. There are signs. Aloha and have a great dining experience here!
Veronica S.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,233,402,1.0,6/9/2015,"I love eating at the Cheesecake Factory but tonight was the worst experience ever! We check in with the hostess and was told it would be a 45 minute wait. It actually took a little over 1 hour. We were led to a table that was not suitable for 2 small children in high chairs so we asked if we could be seated outside since we could see 3 empty tables. The hostess rudely replied there are no tables outside, if you want to sit outside you have to wait like everybody else. We showed her the 3 empty tables. She reluctantly sat us on the patio. We placed our orders and waited over an hour for our food to arrive.  Two tables next to us sat down after us, ordered there food, ate and left and we still hadn't received our plates. It was late at night, our kids fell asleep at the table and we were starving after a long day of activities.  It was a miserable wait. We ended up asking for our food to go. The server looked annoyed to have to go back to the kitchen and pack our food. The food was great but the service was TERRIBLE!!!!!"
Oreo C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",28,179,24,4.0,9/21/2012,Cheesecake factory has never really disappointed me or my gf for all the visits at different locations we've been there. One of our favorites is the Avocado spring rolls. We went to this location only to get the avocado spring rolls take out and sat on the beach. There is a lot of other good food around Honolulu though so I would pass on this unless you won't be near a cheesecake factory again.
D.J. Y.,"Shoreline, WA",356,948,826,2.0,12/16/2010,"We came, we saw the long lines, we fought for the better part of 65 minutes to get 4 pieces of cheesecake TOGO!!! We lost the battle, had scars from line jumpers, and bruises from the rude tourists pointy elbows...really it's just cheesecake.... We even came up short on our order, 4 pieces, 2 of which were the wrong flavors.... Le sigh...."
D R.,"Marina/Cow Hollow, San Francisco, CA",0,21,18,4.0,11/12/2013,"Generous portion sizes! We had the chicken shot appetisers which were $8.95. They were very tasty but huge serving 8 pieces that are the size of a whole chicken wing.  The lot pizza was basic but again generous size for 1.  The cheesecake was good but again big excellent. Would I go back, yes. Would I recommend it yes."
