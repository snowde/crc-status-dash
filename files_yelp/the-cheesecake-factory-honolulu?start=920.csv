Carolyn S.,"Tacoma, WA",123,25,4,4.0,12/28/2012,"I'm gluten free,  the waiter was awesome in helping me pick something to eat.  I was able to get the Pork chop which was amazing, moist and perfect.  the pineapple mojito is stiff and tart.  and the chips and fresh gauc is amazing! The downside: It's a very touristy spot, with a lot of uptight patrons."
Jl G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,9,,1.0,1/22/2015,"I usually like eating here and have brought friends to try my favorite, Steak Diane.  This te was horrible!  My steak was tough and charred. My Faye's food was supposedly Kobe but not like any that she had there previously.  I cannot see throwing good Money in going back......at least until the memory or taste goes away.  I only give it a one star so that I can post this review.  Don't waste your money!"
Renee S.,"Honolulu, HI",149,109,689,4.0,7/13/2012,"Exremely busy place on weekend, wait was 80 minutes, I went to the bar area, like musical chairs...wa la. About 5 seats opened up at the bar; excellent service at the bar forgot his name, too hungry.,,. Great calamari, chopped salad and ahi carppacio, yum sliced paper thn. Great Pomegranate mojito. I liked the bartenders inquiry, do you see CHEESECAKE in your future. Hahaha, too cute."
SacTown G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,245,1,4.0,1/20/2015,Amazing how busy this place is EVERY single day and night.  It is a huge restaurant though so the line seems to move.  We stopped in for dinner. Wait was over an hour but bartender pointed us toward the rear bar. It's a hidden gem!  Sat right down with no wait!  Typical CF menu and consistently prepared as usual. The bartender in back was friendly and efficient. Will go back!
Chris R.,"Honolulu, HI",19,1057,81,3.0,9/2/2014,"Typical Cheesecake Factory.  Nothing special.  We were seated within 10 minutes.  Our waiter in training was a bit slow.  The food portion is huge, so prepare to take it to go or share with your parties."
Clara H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",317,115,49,5.0,6/27/2014,"It was my friend's birthday, so I treated her out to CF. We reserved so the wait wasn't too bad. It was crowded though! And I was honestly shocked by how large the restaurant was. There are like 5 or 6 sections of seating. And there is an open kitchen you could watch if you wanted. VERY busy that night. We ordered and we didn't wait long, surprisingly. Once we ordered, the food came out in about 10 to 15 minutes! And of course the awesome pre-entree breads with butter! I love munching on the bread. Yum~ For dessert we ordered the oreo cheesecake slice. And I told our server that it was my friend's birthday, so the server started gathering the other surrounding workers and they started singing!=) It was fun and very cool of them. Overall experience was great! Oh, and in the front of the restaurant, there was a live band. I don't know if they do it all the time, but it was nice."
Kana T.,"Honolulu, HI",4,57,1,5.0,5/22/2013,"Plenty to choose from on the menu, you'll probably never get around to trying everything in a lifetime. My four friends and I shared the Thai chicken wrap appetizer, which came with 5 pieces of chicken, so it was just enough. A little hard to eat so would not recommend ordering it on a first date! It came with three different sauces, and the peanut one (the only one I tried) was great.  I ordered the passion fruit mojito, chicken Bellagio which comes w prosciutto and arugula, and tiramisu for dessert. Loved all of it. I loved that the tiramisu was delicious too, even though it wasn't one of their famous cheesecakes.  Our server Tom was very polite, and took the time to take about five pictures, calling it his ""second job"" lol. We got there at 6:30PM on a Tuesday so the wait wasn't too bad even though we had 5 people in our party (less than 30 min), and we were there until past 9PM and the parking was only $1 in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center after validation.  I agree with the other Yelpers that the price is decent considering their portions. I really wish their pumpkin cheesecake wasn't seasonal, and they'd bring back the plain Oreo cheesecake! (they still have a super rich looking chocolate Oreo cheesecake) I can't wait to go back!"
Dean H.,"Honolulu, HI",442,305,302,4.0,4/13/2010,"This place is seriously food overload.  I always get the SAME thing here.  The MEATLOAF....come on now....how can you resist the mash potatoes, a stack of meat and gravy.  SERIOUSLY! I love the mixed drinks there even if it is a little pricey. Tried the nachos this past time and it was the dog's bark.  WOOF WOOF, ya hear?  Got some kalua pork on it and the peppers were great.  The salsa was fresh and so was the guacamole.  ahhhh, the goods for sure. The wait wasn't that bad but when we left there must have been at least a 2 hour wait.  I heard them tell one group of eight ""1 hour and a half"".  I was like WHOA.    The wait staff was VERY helpful and VERY quick to fill water and ask if we needed anything else. I was very impressed.....ROCK ON C. FaCtOrY !!!!!"
Nichole B.,"Pearl City, HI",7,27,2,5.0,4/15/2013,"Favorite place ever! Never had a bad experience here. I love sitting out front or in the back, which is open & airy!  Extremely busy typically here though."
Ben D.,"New York, NY",420,38,,4.0,6/20/2012,"Despite the long wait time and the fact that it is in the most touristy area on island, I have a strong, undying love for this place that I've come to for some pretty big occasions, many of which happened to be birthdays, including my own a few years ago. I recommend going for lunch if you're looking to get in and out relatively fast because the dinner crowd is like no other and will have you waiting anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours. Luckily, it is located on the west side of the Royal Hawaiian shopping center, so feel free to shop while you wait. But be sure to come back earlier than your anticipated seating time because they often seat you faster than they expect to. When you get inside, there are four or five different areas of the restaurant that you could be seated in. Dining outside in either of their two outdoor seating areas is always enjoyable and personally preferred. Most times you'll be seated in the indoor booths - still nice.  The wait staff is trained quite thoroughly on the menu and are very helpful for friends who are overwhelmed by the menu - be warned, it is a very extensive menu and quite easy to get lost in. The waiters/waitresses are also really friendly, though conversation with them is tough as the restaurant is extremely busy. Wait time for food is pretty standard, maybe 10-20 minutes, and is entirely worth it as the food always hits the spot (and there's complimentary bread to munch on while you wait - it's divine). Personal favorite dishes include the Wild Mushroom Burger, Garlic Noodles, and Roasted Vegetable Pizza. If you're looking for meat options, consider ordering their Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna, a Cuban Sandwich, or their Shrimp with Angel Hair pasta. Otherwise, ask your server for their favorites and order accordingly.  What I haven't gotten around to trying is their breakfast or brunch menus, though I hope to change that soon. As for dessert, cheesecake is a given - and there are so many to choose from! They are all guaranteed to be good. My favorite two are the Key Lime Pie and the Wild Blueberry White Chocolate varieties, conveniently located next to one another on their menu. You receive in quality of service and food what you pay for, so definitely splurge a little when you come, you won't regret it! This place is great for birthdays, special dinners, or just going out with friends. As cheesy as it sounds, any night is a great one for the Cheesecake Factory. Enjoy!"
Zac H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,,3.0,1/13/2015,"Walked straight past the line to have a seat at the bar. Free bread was a nice touch, burger was greasy and the fries weren't what I ordered. Was too full of grease to try dessert. Okay experience but I wouldn't wait in line for it."
Raych D.,"Honolulu, HI",695,497,1585,4.0,2/8/2011,"I come here for the salad not the cheesecake!!  I don't ever try to attempt coming here at nights no more due to the ridiculous wait which can be from 45 minute to 1hr and a half!! So, I've only been coming here whenever I feel the need to shop at Forever 21's newest location in Waikiki during the day time, and wait is usually 15 min. They do validate so that's a good thing and parking is free and located in the Royal Hawaiian.  My recently came here with my ex on New Years day for shopping and lunch. Whenever I come here I usually go for the spicy ahi tempura appetizers, salmon and mashed potatoes or the cobb salad. This last night I came I ordered the western bbq chicken salad with fried onion rings. I hate onion and I ate those onion rings like it was french fries! The chicken breast was so soft, moist and juicy I forgot that it was even the breast part of the chicken! And the salad came with avocado, corn, tomatoes, ranch and bbq dressing (on the side that is). My ex ordered a salad as well with some fruits on it and a sweet and sour vinaigrette dressing. I usually only care for ranch on my salad but this dressing was actually pretty good!  The maple bread is really good enough for me to eat especially because I don't care for carbs. The drinks are fabulously good that I'm forgetting that I'm drinking it in the afternoon. My favorite are the sweeter martinis! The cheesecake that I do remember trying was the original and caramel. It was a bit to much and to rich for me but what do I know I don't cheesecakes."
Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,3.0,6/12/2010,"This has got to the busiest Cheesecake I've seen so far and they do a great job of cranking out tables as soon as possible. We came in on an early Saturday night and were told 15 minutes. Our buzzer flashed a little after 15 minutes and we turned it on only to stand around aimlessly for the next 10. I'm familiar with there being a little time in between for staging but 10 minutes was kind of ridiculous, but they were busy up at the desk so I let it go. Our server Heather was fantastic and very thorough with her descriptions of dishes and answering our questions. I felt her enthusiasm to be quite genuine and rare to find in a Cheesecake Factory server. I wish I could have taken her back to San Francisco with me and had her teach the servers there a thing or two about hospitality.  Our only issue during dinner was the fact that one of our pasta dishes was undercooked. The pasta was suppose to be overcooked and soft and it came out hard in the center of the bowtie noodle and a little harder than al dente. We asked for it to be remade and some joker of a man came by the table just to say, ""you guys okay? Your food will be out in a little bit."" He didn't stop at the table but rather did a walk by and with a hurried demeanor. We later found out the  guy was a manager. He didn't help the situation but rather irritated the hell out of me. However, our server was so apologetic and was great about everything I couldn't hold it against the restaurant. My moco loco was a little salty but it was nice to have something different on the menu besides the usual crispy spicy beef or buffalo chicken sandwich. We also didn't stay for dessert because the portions of meals were so big and the weather outside didn't allow safe temperatures for cheesecake slices. I might get takeout if there was nothing else open on the strip by the beach but I wouldn't dine there again."
Kristen U.,"Aiea, HI",58,46,27,4.0,6/4/2012,"Cheesecake Factory, your wait is ridiculous. Once for a friend's birthday, we had to wait about 40 minutes for a pager and another 1 hour and 20 minutes for a table. I've been here many times and the only time I waited less than 1 hour was when I dined in after 9 pm. However, despite your absurd policy of not offering reservations, I always, always, ALWAYS come back because you're just that good! I can't stay away! I think I need help. It impresses me that this location is such a mad house but service is never compromised. I've never had a bad dining experience here as the servers are all very sympathetic over the long wait, but patient and helpful when I'm deciding on what to order. My absolute favorite dish is your chicken madeira - it's superb! Other favorites include your mac & cheese appetizer, quesadillas, and shepherd's pie. Of course, I can never leave here without taking home a few slices of cheesecake (since I can never find tummy-room to eat it at the restaurant). My all-time favorite is your Godiva Chocolate. Good Lord, it's the finest piece of cheesecake that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. I'm a chocoholic and the richness of it is phenomenal. A great way to finish off the evening. In addition to the great service and food, the ambiance is really beautiful. I prefer eating out on the patio (?) - the one that's right across the lawn from the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. It's much quieter out there than inside the restaurant. My rating of 4 stars is going to stand until the day you decide to offer reservations - I'd be a regular here if I didn't have to wait so long."
Lyric S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,15,25,5.0,9/22/2014,"food 5 stars cheesecake 5 stars service 4 stars wait time? for those who complain about the wait time, well it's not their fault... it just means that they bring in good business and it's nothing personal... if you can't wait then go somewhere else:)"
Elyssa D.,"Augusta, GA",73,120,32,4.0,11/3/2012,This place never disappoints! I love their eggplant sandwich! A good idea would be to get an appetizer and then try the cheesecake! Portions are big so there is a slim chance you'll have room for cheesecake with a regular meal. Although you can stop at the cheesecake counter and get some to go!
Chaulcey C.,"Honolulu, HI",18,21,2,1.0,9/1/2014,Gross. Service sucks. There was hair in my food and it was not worth it . Disgusting!!!! So Many places to go
Diane Y.,"San Francisco, CA",132,147,5,1.0,3/15/2012,"They need to start taking reservations. Period. Maybe they can be extremely strict about on-time arrival, like ""if you do not arrive within 2 minutes of your reservation time, your spot will be given to the next person and you will be at the back of the line"" or something. It is a HUGE waste of time to have to wait an hour every time I dine here. Their lack of a reservation policy indicates that they are okay with wasting their customers' time, which is a reprehensible way of running a business. Just think of it this way. If you have a party of 2, and your group makes an average of $40/hr at their jobs, the opportunity cost of eating here is $80, just for the wait time. At that rate, they should be paying YOU $10-20/person! The food is decent but overpriced and the less-popular cheesecakes are always stale. I would never actually pay money to eat here."
Annie W.,"Henderson, NV",393,1029,1456,4.0,6/16/2010,"I know this place is known for their dessert, but we opt out of it.  Instead we went healthy and had chicken sandwiches and chicken salads.     First came the bread and our waitress was nice enough to offer us evoo and vinegar instead of butter.  Then came the entrees which were nicely plated.  My chicken avocado sandwich was piled with avocado, bacon, nice thick piece of chicken breast, fresh tomatoes, lettuce and slightly grilled, humongous sizes of whole wheat  bread with oats.   My meal came with a side and I had the green salad instead of the Caesar.  This place definitely serves generous portions. My hubby had a huge plate of the chicken salad and that too was flavorful.  The chicken was served over a bed of rice, which I thought was interesting for a salad.   For the price, the service, the ambiance way back at the bar and no lines to wait at 5p.m. in midweek deserves at least a 4 star from me =)"
Bill H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",30,14,,4.0,12/28/2015,"You will always wait at test 30 minutes to get in. It's Waikiki pricing, but you do get a lot of food and the service is good."
