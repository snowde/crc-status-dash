Clarissa M.,"Honolulu, HI",59,395,1258,4.0,12/14/2012,"This joint is in the heart of Waikiki across International market. Parking is a challenge if your not staying at a nearby hotel or condo. Lots of foot traffic as it's also near Forever 21 & Macy's. The wait for our table was for one hour so know you should shop around to kill that hour. Once seated our server was quick to attend to us. We started with the calamari which was not overly breaded and tasty.  Our table shared the Chinese chicken salad, mushroom burger with fries, sweet corn tamale, and Tex Mex roll. Their portions are SUPER DOOPER HUGE!!!! So of course we had leftovers. Overall the foods we had were cooked well and full of flavor. Tex Mex rolls had a nice spicy kick and love the dipping sauce. The sweet corn tamale was a unique and enjoyable dish - it had a sweet hint but the tamale was prepared like mash potatoes with avocado, their secret sauce, cilantro, tomatoes.  This dish is a must try. We were so stuffed but we could not leave without sharing dessert! So our server recommended we try the Oreo cheesecake. It was just the right amount of sweet for us with actual Oreo cookies. Their menu has over 200 items and can be found online, but one of their red wine, Barons De Rothschild, Lafite Reserve Specials was unavailable at this location. Regardless we had good food that made good times. Heads up this place is loud so if your looking for a quiet dinner this is not a place to go. While we were there we heard dishes breaking in the kitchen at least three times."
Natalie P.,"Denver, CO",145,143,77,4.0,3/16/2012,"I love cheesecake factory, but this location is always packed, mainly with tourists, you'd think they'd want to go to Ono's or Haili's ..nope not these tourists. I wish there was another cheesecake factory for locals to go to!  Anyways if you want to come here for dinner I would suggest coming an hour before you actually want to eat, since most of the time you will find a long waiting line. So 5pm is a good time to be there...anytime after 6:30pm the wait time can be over an hour long!  FOOD:  We always pick and share the:  *GRILLED SHRIMP AND BACON CLUB: consists of perfectly cooked shrimp covered in a very yummy special sauce. It comes with a side or fries or salad and runs at around $15, it is also very huge!    *STEAK DIANE: A deliciously seasoned steak, grilled onions, and mushrooms doused in a tasty awesome wine sauce. It comes with mashed potatoes that are oh so good! This is another huge plate and is around $20. mmmm.. these two entrees!!!  DRINKS/CHEESECAKE: They have really good drinks but kind of expensive I think they start at like $7. My favorite is the Sour Appletini and the Skinny Long Island and my favorite cheesecake is the Oreo and the Original with fresh strawberries.  SERVICE/PARKING: The service here has always been good, although they are supper busy they always manage to attend to us and times when we've had problems with the food, they've quickly returned and replaced i.e. stale fries. If you park at the Royal Hawaiian you can get the first 3 hours validated, and then it's $1 an hour after that. I think I would come here more often if it wasn't always so crowded..but for now I guess I'll just plan ahead!"
Angela R.,"Honolulu, HI",0,50,1,5.0,5/30/2012,"As a Waikiki local, I can say this is my favorite place. The cheesecake factory always has what I want. Great food which is consistent. Excellent service, and good drinks. How they pump thousands of people through here day after day and maintain the quality of food is beyond me, but it is working.  For the tourists: Yeah, cheesecake factory isn't the most exciting place to go in Hawaii, but the food is good, and reasonably priced for what you get. A lot of the other Waikiki restaurants, national chains and others will give you a lot less and charge you the same price.  The best time to go is before 4:30 . This place gets crowded fast. We often sit at the bar tables and order food. We always seem to get a spot. The cheesecakes are of course to die for. Try the wasabi crusted Ahi, mac crusted mahi or steak Diane. And the avocado egg rolls are a can't miss."
Kiana F.,"Kapolei, HI",0,2,,4.0,12/23/2015,"The food and the service were excellent. We were treated by Chris. He made it obvious his name was chris. He was very friendly and showed us his napkin folding skills. I had folded a flower with my napkin, and he saw. That's when he showed us his skills. I wanna give it 5 stars, but the wait was just too long. We waited an hour for a table, but the order time and meal time were satisfactory. The prices were okay, and the food was good. We had an appetizer, entree, and dessert. It was hard to keep room for all this food in our stomach.  Our appetizer was fried mac n cheese balls, and they were so good. Our entrees were Evelyn's Favorite Pasta and stuffed tortillas, both were excellent. We had only eaten half before we grew full. For dessert, we had the oreo cheesecake and the white chocolate macadamia nut, both were supreme.  Overall, we would come back here, maybe if the wait were shorter, it would get 5 stars. We understand that this is a Waikiki hotspot, but the wait was just too much."
M C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,11,1,3.0,12/23/2014,We went for a late lunch. The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away. The service was good but the food had a few issues. My daughter's pasta was very salty which was also the case with two of the three french fries portions. We told our server that the restaurant needs to be more careful with they way they season their dishes. Overall the food is predictable and the portions are big.
Ryan M.,"Honolulu, HI",199,12,16,4.0,9/7/2014,I highly recommend the Chicken Katsu!! Great flavor and the Spicy Miso sauce tastes amazing. They also have very good cheesecake flavors.
Al D.,"Honolulu, HI",8,1040,347,4.0,7/21/2014,Large portions for decent prices (by Waikiki standards). The food was ok and my bloody Mary was a bit weak but I had an overall good experience. The cheesecake was delicious. This place is a diet buster but worth the visit.
Leth Y.,"Lethbridge, Canada",0,3,,3.0,12/19/2015,Food was good. Kids liked their grilled cheese but my bang bang chicken was only OK. Ridiculous wait times if you get there after 6 (not a problem for me and the kids) there were about 100 people waiting outside as I left. There are plenty of more adventurous/better options in walking distance and I would choose those if I didn't need to feed the little ones. Wait staff was good and polite but the speed of getting drinks and the first course on the table was a little slow.
Jared O.,"Snohomish, WA",39,22,9,4.0,8/31/2013,"The hostess greeted us with a friendly smile and the service was fantastic. My wife and I ordered a Bloody Mary and a Pineapple Mojito along with 2 pieces of cheesecake. Everything came out in a timely manner and the cheesecake taste great! My only complaint is my wife's pineapple mojito had very little alcohol in it. I ordered a regular mojito after I finished my Bloody Mary to see if all their mojitos were like that, and it was.  We had 3 drinks and 2 pieces of cheesecake for a total of 54.95 (including a 7 dollar tip). The cheesecake was only $7.50 per slice. This means each drink was $10-12. I could walk a block down Waikiki beach and get much stronger drinks or half the price. I was not happy with this :("
Jaime F.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,5,,5.0,12/17/2015,We ate at the Cheesecake Factory yesterday. Our server was Javier and he was awesome! The food and service was excellent and we will definitely be returning!
Chrisy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",163,161,,4.0,7/3/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is super pretty! I enjoyed dining indoor but outdoor ... if that makes at all sense. Maybe you just have to see for yourself. I love Cheesecake Factory food, so as always, it was yums. I have the Luau Salad. I don't have that option at home & it's amazing. The wait though is painful. I suggest go early, put your name down & do a little shopping in the meantime. (: OH! & Pina Colada cheesecake = great! But I wish it had more cheescake part."
Dave H.,"Honolulu, HI",1,17,2,4.0,9/28/2014,"Consistent. You know what you are getting. The place is always packed. The service is good. The food is high quality. And the location is central Waikiki. When I am in New York or Florida,  Cheesecake Factory is not going to be my first choice, but for you travelers to Honolulu, I would recommend it because of its location and consistency. My buddies will meet at this location and go to the beach afterwards. For lunch, I sit on the patio and get a great view of people passing by on Kalakaua avenue."
Lindsay T.,"Honolulu, HI",3,20,,4.0,5/29/2012,"The wait here is beyond ridiculous.  Over an hour on a weeknight for only two people -- definitely not a place I come back to regularly.  (At least all of us ladies can go and bide our time at the gigantic Forever 21 next door!) Because it's so crowded, it can get noisy and the service can be slow.  However, the staff is really friendly, so it's hard to complain about slow service when the restaurant is jammed. But the food is always good.  Huge menu selection!  I normally opt for a pasta or a burger, but I'm sure everything is delicious.  And the best part: the AMAZING cheesecake.  My favorite: RED VELVET -- two layers of red velvet cake, two layers of cheesecake, and a sweet cream cheese frosting, mmmmm."
S Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",9,75,49,3.0,8/4/2012,"We decided to dine at the Cheesecake Factory on the day we arrived in Oahu.  Because we were familiar with its popularity during our experiences on the mainland, we went in at 4pm which was a GREAT CALL.  We were seated within 2 minutes but it was clear that the restaurant was filling up fast for the dinner crowd. Once we browsed through the extensive menu (the menu looks like a short story novel but included the wine list and cocktail menu as well) we were ready to order.  I highly recommend ordering the lunch portions of the pasta if you want to minimize leftovers to take back to your hotel and most importantly leave room for cheesecake. The pasta dishes were fantastic in both flavor, portion size and presentation! The burgers were also great (extremely filling).  We lucked out on dining there during their national Cheesecake Day (July 30th: all cheescakes were half price!!). The service as good and attentive considering entering the extremely busy period.  They seemed to have alot of staff to handle the crowd.  When we left (around 5:30pm), the line up out front was absolutely nuts?!?! We were now all set to enjoy the rest of the young evening enjoying the sights if Waikiki. To fully enjoy your dining experience, show up before the dinner hour starts otherwise you may be too frustrated from the line up to enjoy your meal. The prices were about right for the level of dining experience and the portion sizes provided good value. Enjoy!"
Rachel W.,"Sarasota, FL",43,49,475,5.0,2/2/2014,Tasty rich food. Portion sizes are large. Their lunch menu with half portion sizes are  perfect and reasonably priced. There is great people watching out on the patio since the restaurant is located on the main Kalakaua strip in Waikiki. Great comfort food!
Asako O.,"Honolulu, HI",58,212,,5.0,3/8/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki is the place to go to satisfy your craving for a cheesecake. Dined at this restaurant many times and every time I go it is always crowded so must go early.   Ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta which is penne pasta tossed with broccoli, oven-dried tomato, roasted eggplant, peppers, artichoke, kalamata olives, garlic and pine nuts. You could not ask for a more simple and healthy pasta. But the winner is their marinated Miso Salmon which is simply delicious. It is served with snow peas and white rice (I substituted with mashed potatoes) and surrounded by a delicious miso sauce. Wow very tasty and flavorful. Now for dessert - with so many different kinds of cheesecakes to choose from I am set on dulce de leche caramel cheesecake which is topped with caramel mousse on a vanilla crust. This is my favorite. The caramel mousse on top is very light and not too sweet. Delicious! The service is always wonderful as the staff are very friendly and helpful."
Tasha N.,"Ala Moana, Honolulu, HI",85,37,125,1.0,5/14/2014,I haven't found any food on the menu that I like. I've tried quite a few times and nothing worked. My hubby loves the cheesecakes here but I am not 100% sold here. The wait is always long and it's loud. I'd rather just shop next door at forever 21.
Jethro C.,"New York, NY",1,17,,4.0,7/31/2013,"There's always a long lineup in front of the Cheesecake Factory in Honolulu.  When we went, we had an expected wait time of 1 hr and 20 mins! The good thing though is that there are a lot of stores and shopping malls nearby to check out while you wait.  The menu was surprisingly big, and you even have the choice for some healthy options such as brown vs white rice (does anyone go to the cheesecake factory for healthy choices though??).   The dessert is the best part about this place with over 20 different varieties of cheesecake to choose from.  All the cheesecakes are just right and not to sweet or overwhelming.  I'm not sure I would wait over an hour again for the Cheesecake Factory, but if you haven't been there before it's definitely worth trying at least once."
Bri T.,"Honolulu, HI",1,31,4,3.0,7/31/2014,"First of all, do not eat at Cheesecake Factory if you don't have the time. The longest we've had to wait was two hours for two people. The shortest was an hour. We have only gone during dinner time so 6-9 PM.  The only reason we return all the time is because the cheesecake. You can't duplicate theirs. The food is also very good (depending on what you get) and the portion size is big! We always take home food and sometimes just get our cheesecake to go. It's pricey but the food makes up for it.  The ambience is dimly lit and it can be a little loud depending on where you sit. We prefer to sit in a booth for two.  We spend around $75 each time we go (more or less depending on what you order).  The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get excellent servers and other times we'll get adequate servers. It really just depends.  Parking is at the royal Hawaiian shopping center parking lot. Do not forget to validate. By the way, we always go walking around the shops while we're waiting and then go closer to the restaurant when it's 30 minutes away from our wait time and just look at the menu so that we're ready to order when we sit down."
Paul T.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,3,,2.0,10/17/2013,"Ordered hebachi steak medium and we waited and kept on seeing orders being served to other patrons who sat down after us. When the dish came out, steak was over cooked .... And I mean overcooked as in leather. Kitchen should not even had let that dish out of the kitchen!!!!! Quality control???? Also ordered a side of sautéed vegetables and it came out all oily. Manager was nice to comp the dishes but this is the second time it had happened (last year when we were here).  Waiter, however, was very nice and was very professional about it.  Was so looking forward to the steak!!!"
