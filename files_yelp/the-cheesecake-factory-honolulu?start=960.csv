Victoria G.,"Mililani, HI",0,34,21,3.0,7/27/2014,"Decent food. Island fish is fresh, ahi and mahi mahi are highly recommended. Cheesecakes are good. Parking is validated. Too many tourists in the restaurant."
Common Sense C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,25,6,4.0,4/9/2012,"I had heard from the manager of the Boca Raton Cheesecake Factory that the Waikiki store is the tops in sales in the entire chain.  Glad to hear that.  We eat  at the Waikiki location often and generally we're pretty happy with our experiences. However, I don't think people realize that there are no reservations for ""local folks"" but there is call ahead seating for hotel guests.  I find this to be very disappointing information.  I have nothing against visitors to our island but why make the locals wait  longer because you give preferential treatment to hotel guests? The wait should be the same for all, on a first come first serve basis at the very least."
Jessica P.,"Pomona, CA",103,5,,5.0,9/8/2015,My Husband and I decided to come grab a bite to eat since we have been to one in Cali thought better be safe than sorry. It was during Labor Day weekend so we knew the wait was gonna be long and both have worked in the fast food industry so we are very understanding. Everyone was really friendly from the host to our server and the managers went above and beyond to make sure everything was okay. We had two managers come out and apologize for the long wait on our foods and assuring us that our food was the first out of a big batch. Sadly when the manager came back around he had to let us know they had accidentally over cooked one of our meals and so happened to be the last chicken they had left. Again I understood stuff like this happens specially on a very busy night. I did not expect a free meal but he did not only take care of my plate but also took care of my husbands and all we had to pay were for the drinks! That's great customer service! Have nothing but good things to say!
Billy W.,"Honolulu, HI",63,111,12,4.0,1/8/2012,"I've always avoided this restaurant over the years because of the long lines. Is it really worth the long wait? But today, enough is enough! Attempted to beat the lines and went at 10:45-ish. Sure enough, no wait! The menu was incredibly long but I ordered the Louisiana Chicken and my friend got the Crusted Chicken Romano. They were both really good! I especially loved their chicken seasoning, best chicken I've ever had. HOWEVER, I found a long piece of saran wrap stuck to the chicken but the manager promptly came out to apologize. No biggie I guess as long as it isn't bugs in my food. The service was pretty good too; drinks were always kept full. SIDE NOTE: Their iced teas are the ""literally iced tea"" kind of ice tea! If you like your sweet tea, it's better for you to order something else to drink. Next is dessert! If you're here for lunch, I'd highly recommend their smaller lunch specials (available til 5 p.m.) because you'd have more room for dessert! Now this is the reason why (I believe) people brave the long lines for this place: cheesecake! There were so many choices (cheesecakes themselves were 1.5 pages long accompanied by another 1.5 pages of other desserts) that it'd be cool if they had some sort of cheesecake sampler. Ordered the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and the Vanilla Bean. They were both very sweet but VERY good. I've tried the frozen Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from Costco but these are entirely of another quality. Couldn't finish either cheesecake because was too full (even with the lunch-sized specials!), be sure to have a glass of water on hand. All in all, it was a great experience and I'd come back again! For lunch. No wait if you're there really early. Smaller portions. For the cheesecake of course."
Stevie D.,"Honolulu, HI",8,40,42,3.0,3/3/2014,Great cheesecake. Restaurant is always crazy busy! Lunch portions and prices are reasonable. Always better to do takeout because the wait can be long since the restaurant is in the middle of Waikiki.
Kaniala K.,"Kaneohe, HI",410,6,20,1.0,4/11/2014,"I'm sorry, but the waitress is nice but who brings the food before the drinks and the meats not cooked...I couldn't drink because I already had eaten...not happy with the service tonight!"
P. A.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/19/2015,"I was surprised with my meal today, it was too salty to eat, we told our waitress and she apologized then asked if we wanted dessert."
Terinna R.,"Groton, CT",402,185,389,4.0,5/2/2012,"Hit  & miss with the servers we get. On the upside, THE FOOD IS ALWAYS AMAZING! :) Favorite appetizer: Avocado rolls & fried calamari Favorite entree: Crab cakes & steak diane! Favorite cheesecake: RED VELVET!!! best part: they validate for 2 hours at the Royal Hawaiian parking lot... just because we almost always spend an hour waiting for seats to begin with lol. Advice: Drop one person off to put your name on the list before going around the block to find your parking spot, it'll at least shave off 10-15minutes your waiting time :)"
Amanda L.,"Toronto, Canada",58,281,11,4.0,5/22/2012,"First off don't expect to get in here for dinner unless you have a reservation or a LOT of time to wait. We couldn't get anywhere near The Cheesecake Factory at night so hit it up for brunch. They have an awesome homemade veggie burger made of black beans, beats and some other stuff, it's a bit bland but different and pretty healthy. The salad was overdosed with vinaigrette but I wasn't much in the mood for it anyways. The restaurant was very nice, seating is a little close together for my comfort but it's a busy place, waitresses and hostesses were very friendly and since it's in Hawaii there is birds wandering all around the place! Although I did enjoy when a bird dive bombed some macaroni a kid dropped and the kid freaked when it saw the bird flapping around beneath it in a feeding frenzy! I was too full for cheesecake so I got the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to go but wasn't impressed with it...while the cheesecake part was good the crust was like chocolate cake and the raspberry tastes suspiciously like cheap cherry pie filling thus resulting in a black forest cake tasting cheesecake and there is no cake i hate more the black forest cake. Overall really good but a few misses."
Gina H.,"Honolulu, HI",183,91,230,3.0,5/15/2014,"Ok, so we usually come here for the ambiance and calamari. Today i ordered the shrimp and bacon club which was delish. I usually never give a bad review unless something stands out and ruins the experience. Today I give this place 3 stars based on service. Lauren P was our waitress. First off, we asked for knives because our table had none for us to butter our bread but she forgot and never brought any. Second, I ordered a beer and was almost done with my first so I ordered a second beer because I didn't know when she would be back. She came back pretty quickly but refused to drop the second beer and glass even tho she already picked up my first bottle. She stated that we can't have 2 drinks at a time. I am familiar with the stacking laws in Hawaii but I didn't need another glass and I had no other beer bottle on the table with me and my bf who is well above drinking age. When she came back to the table as expected a long while later (15 mins) I told her to cancel the second beer. She said ok but proceeded to ask us if we were done with our appetizers even tho there was still some on the plate. She never checked to see if our drinks needed to be refilled. To top it all off she forgot to take the 2nd beer that she never served off of the bill!!! I'm so disappointed with the service that at the moment I'm thinking I want to give them 2 stars! Pppfftttt!"
Felicia F.,"Honolulu, HI",3,28,1,5.0,4/9/2013,"Open again after fire early 2013... Great very clean location right on Kalakaua near Royal Hawaiian.  Good food, good portions and a good price.  Service was excellent. These people have done it right, gets busy though so go at off peak if you can.  Aussies love this place.   Highly recommend them!"
Lei D.,"Honolulu, HI",45,40,24,5.0,11/8/2012,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory before and I've had decent service, but tonight was great! Although it was pretty busy, we were seated pretty quickly (party of 4). We just did dessert, but the portions were huge and tasty as usual. We split 2 desserts between the 4 of us and still had leftovers! Our server was Dustin M. and he was awesome. Very attentive, but not too much that he bothered us. He knew his menu and made great suggestions. He definitely made the night! And if he is reading this, you may remember me by, ""Thanks Kiddo!"" =P"
Karen V.,"Long Beach, CA",89,127,17,5.0,1/3/2014,"Always great to eat here. Great food, good service, huge portions. We came in during lunch and were expecting a long wait, but it was only about 20 minutes.  Sister and I went into Forever 21 right next door and roamed around while we waited.  Our waitress was great, very welcoming and answered our questions.  Love the bread before, like that there is two kinds. I usually get the lunch specials because they are smaller portions.  I got the barbecue ranch chicken salad and it was amazing!! I can't wait to come back and have it again! Everyone at our table had great food. Burger, Chinese chicken salad, pasta, etc.  All great. We were too full to have cheesecake this time, but we will definitely be back for our cheesecake!! So many different kinds, can't wait to try a few!!! Yumm!!!! Oh, and the whipped cream is amazing.  I want to try the new s'mores one! yumm."
Anthony M.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,5,,5.0,8/15/2015,Great service and awesome outdoor seating with great people watching.  Highly recommend.
Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57,4.0,8/26/2010,"I wish you could give half stars because for this establishment I would say they are honestly a three and a half. I am going to live dangerously and give them the four because of their Sunday brunch. Worth the wait!!!  This location is ALWAYS busy however traffic seems to keep moving and they seat relatively quickly. The restaurant is loud!!! Difficult to have a conversation especially around the bar. Tables are close to one another and waiters and waitresses are bustling around so fast going to the bathroom (which are clean!) can be a near death.  experience.  Food is consistently good. I love their french toast for brunch. Their sugar free cheesecake is out of this world. Salads are fresh and tasty. Overall, their food is consistent and worth the price.  They have a convenient location in Waikiki and even validate parking. It is a great place to stop for a late night bite. There are seats at the bar too.  Overall, this is a place worth returning to...even if it is just for the sugar free cheesecake."
Margret C.,"Las Vegas, NV",208,1402,738,4.0,8/26/2010,"This has got to be the busiest Cheesecake Factory- whenever we pass by, there's a ton of people waiting to get inside. I've eaten at the ones back home a lot, so I am familiar with the food. I'm sure that this one will incorporate some local flavor.  We came here on our family trip (in-laws). I don't remember what everyone ordered except for my mother-in-law's kalua pork nachos- talk about tremendous! We were all busy eating our meals and she kept telling us ""I hope that you help me finish this."" The size of that platter could have easily fed four people- I'm serious. I guess if we wanted to, we could of just ordered those nachos and another appetizer and called it a meal."
Kimberly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",223,65,4,4.0,6/3/2014,"The wait is normally an hour or more but this is their busiest location in the country so expect it! Aside from that everything is great. Regular menu as the other locations, easily located in Waikiki. We normally go once each time we visit after a long day of snorkeling!"
Anthony F.,"Lanai City, HI",8,6,8,1.0,7/19/2014,Our server Johnathan was rude!! I notified him that I was allergic to shellfish and becoz I ordered crispy fish tacos I had to choose something else coz da fish is fried in da same oil as shrimp but I did have the grill the fish... Why couldn't they fry it in a small frying pan in new oil?!? So our order comes n the tacos has no spice or salt taste no taste in da salsa or sauce even Taco Bell tacos taste better. We also had the Chinese chicken salad but there was no chicken. Even the people next to us had problem with their food!!! The restaurant is so BZ their is no customer satisfaction or good customer service!?!. You wait for over an hour to be seated only to have bad service and n NOT good tasting food!!!
Olivia D.,"Honolulu, HI",554,560,187,4.0,10/9/2007,"I know, I know: it's not cool to review a chain restaurant. For some reason, everybody hates chain restaurants. Well, I like The Cheesecake Factory. Like, not love. I've been to the flagship store in Marina del Rey, the one in Macy's S.F. with the view of Union Square, and the one here in Waikiki three times and every time I've had excellent, professional service and very decent food in a great setting.  If you can, get a table in the extreme back of the restaurant overlooking the lush garden. It seems to be a little less frenetic back there. I recommend any of their salads, especially the French country salad with beets, asparagus, goat cheese, and pecans. The last time I went, we had the goulash, which I really liked, and the chicken and biscuits (actually, biscuit) which I moderately enjoyed (it was a tiny, tiny bit too sweet for my taste). The server actually gave us a strawberry shortcake biscuit, which was such a hit with the table, we ended up ordering--guess what?--a strawberry shortcake for dessert. I always get the fried calamari too, because it is always so perfectly seasoned and crisp on the outside and I love the garlic aioli and cocktail sauces. Stay away from the Asian-style courses, unless of course, you enjoy pseudo-Asian fare like the kind served at American Chinese restaurants. I actually haven't eaten the cheesecake here since I was a kid, so I don't remember what they taste like!"
Carly R.,"Boston, MA",281,11,1,5.0,8/13/2014,"Amazing! The service was fantastic. Their manager, I believe his name was Dan? Was fantastic. We had a conversation with him and it was like we were talking to a friend. Which was the same for their entire staff. Busboys to waiters to hosts. Fantastic. It's worth the wait."
