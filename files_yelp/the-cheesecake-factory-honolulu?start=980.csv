Arnel D.,"San Diego, CA",1560,1907,6793,5.0,8/21/2012,"Cheesecake Factory located in Waikiki is awesome! Only a few steps from many major hotels, this place gets pretty busy. If your hotel is close by opt for take out and dine in your room or patio like what I did and even grabbed a beer from an ABC store for cheep.  They serve all sorts of food and liquor. Call ahead for a reservation if possible to avoid waiting in an hour and a half wait."
Jacqueline G.,"Hilo, HI",84,50,165,3.0,3/26/2012,"Takes no reservations, down side. But, they do hand you a beeper so you can walk around Waikiki and do some quick shopping. We had an hour wait on a Saturday night at 8.30 pm. It was chaotic in the lobby with minimal seating. I spent the next hour at the Forever21 store next door. (So happy they are neighbors!)  Got a table at the time specified. Bussers didn't do a good job cleaning under the table, slippery mess underneath. Server was efficient but not very personable.  Started with the spinach artichoke dip with chips and fried macaroni and cheese balls. Oily and rich! For dinner, I ordered the Scampi and Steak Diane with mashed potatoes for $21.95. Good price! Food came at the perfect time. My steak was cooked to perfection but came cut in tiny pieces. The mashed potatoes were creamy and flavorful. (Maybe LOTS of butter?) I had for LARGE pieces of jumbo shrimp scampi. The red wine sauce for the Steak Diane was a bit too tangy. Ask for it on the side. So full, we had to order cheesecake to go. Great Red Velvet cheesecake! Atmosphere too loud and busy for intimate dinners. Maybe I'll go on a weeknight next time."
Erin Y.,"Honolulu, HI",90,191,27,4.0,4/23/2012,"I would eat here daily if I could afford it (and build my patience), and I'd alternate between two dishes.  Miso salmon and chicken piccatta.  I rarely come into Waikiki, and I can't say that I wish I came here more, I just wish there were another Cheesecake Factory not in Waikiki. Let's start with my first meal.  I'll take the miso salmon.  It's delightful.  Turn to page473 of your menu, and Its halfway down.  I know, you're asking yourself how a mainland chain restaurant could possibly make a terrific miso salmon.  But they do!  It comes on a bed a superb mashed potatoes.   My second meal: Chicken Piccata.  I always ask for it without mushrooms (I'm ""allergic""), and not once have they made the mistake of putting them in.  This is so great with their angel hair pasta.  They give a generous portion, so I can eat my leftovers the next day! Another great thing about Cheesecake is the bread.  The sourdough is excellent, and if you ask for them to pack some with your leftovers, they usually are happy to oblige.   The only negative?  UGH...the wait.  If you'd like to go there on a special occasion, be prepared to wait.  I've gone there for three birthdays of mine, and every time it's been close to a 2 hour wait if not more.  I wish they took reservations for parties over 8 or 12 or something.  My personal hint: bring snacks  ;)"
Sara S.,"Waipahu, HI",0,3,,2.0,8/11/2013,"I've been to quite a few Cheesecake Factories, but the one in Waikiki is supposed to be the mother of all Cheesecake Factories, so decided to stop in for some dessert last night as my evening was winding down. It was pretty...meh. :(   Granted, it was fairly late (place closes at Midnight and I got there at 11 pm) when I arrived, and I'm sure there's a different atmosphere during prime dinner hour, but overall the experience was really disappointing.  The hosts at the front desk seemed really disorganized, and our server barely made eye contact as he rushed around. The guy was pretty much a ghost.   I had the Red Velvet cheesecake (my personal favorite) and a glass of milk. The cake is usually melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but this particular slice seemed like it had been sitting in the display case a bit too long. The layer of cake itself was dry and the cream cheese frosting was almost rock-solid. Again, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it was getting close to closing time, but yeahhhh. :("
B W.,"San Jose, CA",6,351,11,4.0,7/12/2015,"This is a busy Cheesecake Factory (which one isn't) in the heart of Waikiki directly across from the Holiday Inn Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel. The wait was long but my hubby put our name down and we went back across the street to shower at the hotel and get dressed for dinner. By the time we went back to the restaurant, our table was almost ready. The service was good and the food is the same as other Cheesecake Factory restaurants."
Zoe C.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,166,164,4.0,1/13/2012,"We went there again last Sunday and I just want to simply say that choosing Cheesecake Factory can never go wrong. We never have any bad experience with Cheesecake Factory, service is always good and sincere, we always feel that we are being welcomed. Even if we go there at late night time, they would check with us if we need anything else before the closing time so that we get to order anything that we have in mind (especially the dessert!). After trying many places on this island, I think I would stick with Cheesecake Factory whenever we have no idea what to eat and not having the time to cook. The long line is worth it. We love Cheesecake Factory!!!!!"
Reuben R.,"Waipahu, HI",33,264,158,5.0,3/29/2010,"I've only been here a few times, but each was well worth it... yes, even after waiting two hours in line at night. If its really bad, they'll give you those radio buzzer things. But as for today, its a scattered shower Monday after Spring Break, and we came a bit early. We pretty much knew everything we were going to get already from looking at the menu before hand online, which I suggest doing. Its a pretty extensive menu. I've just come to the conclusion that there are just too many things I want to try... so we'll have to come back again!  So, we decided to get something from the specials menu rather than the lunch menu. We asked our waiter how big the portions were and he told us it would actually big good for the both of us. Coming here for dinner before, I already knew it'd be way more than enough for me, so we told him we were going to share an entree, the Chicken Madeira and we also picked out the fried mac and cheese. My friend told me she first saw them when Paula Deen made them. We were quickly brought our water and an extra plate, and warm whole grain and italian house bread.  Shortly after, our appetizer came. It was battered macaroni and cheese topped with grated parmesan over some sort of sauce. The parmesan made it a little bit too salty, and the sauce wasn't striking in flavor... but the ball of macaroni itself was great! I loved it, and I already want some more.  When our entree came... indeed it was big. We even had leftovers afterwards. The chicken was over batter and layered on top with cheese. I enjoyed it a lot because it didn't taste too heavy, and was definitely not dry. The sauce around it was very rich tasting, with a dark wine type of flavor... but I have to admit... those mashed potatoes are what I loved about the dish! There was finely mashed and peppered red potatoes, as well as tender chunks.  For dessert we got a slice of carrot cheese cake! The carrot caked balanced out the sweet cream from the cream cheese just right. As a little kid I didn't like the thought of a carrot cake and didn't know it was good until I had tried one. This was so much better than a normal carrot cake! I love carrots, and I love cake! they go so well together =9 Reset Factory Settings: Yes~ I'm coming back."
Kyle C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",3,7,2,4.0,7/22/2011,"This place is the best for lunch and dinner, they offer really great tasting food especially their Cheeseburgers and of course their Famous Cheesecake I promise you that anything on their menu is very delicious and tasty, they have a wide variety of food on their menu so choose wisely. The downside of Cheesecake Factory is the birds and pigeons that come inside the restaurant because there are tables where you can eat outdoor right next to the Waikiki strip. When the employee's chase the birds and pigeons out of the restaurant and they fly all over the place and I'm a little more scared of germs than other people so that's the the i don't like about Cheesecake Factory but their food and especially cheesecake is amazing and service is friendly.  My problem first was parking, no need to worry park at the Royal Hawaiian Center 1st hour is free and after that each hour is only a $1 so parking is cheap."
Allison M.,"Manila, Philippines",87,216,283,3.0,10/15/2012,"Their menu at The Cheesecake Factory is impressive, to say the least - it's almost a book. What's less impressive is the food itself.  Everything we tried - aside from the cheesecake - was over salted, and otherwise bland, my pasta especially. It's sad that the only spice some restaurants seem to know how to use is salt. There's so many other flavors out there! That being said, they're clearly used to handling the traffic of a Waikiki afternoon, and the service was quick and friendly.  They don't skimp on the portions either, and the cheesecake was no exception. The one slice we shared looked as large as my face, and neither of us could finish it. There's just so many better options in Honolulu."
Steve D.,"San Diego, CA",69,142,54,4.0,10/15/2012,"We are from San Diego where it is almost impossible to get in under 2 hours. Here vacationing in Wakiki we arrived around 6pm and managed to grab a table in the bar with no wait. (restaurant wait was only about 20min) Our waiter was great, I think his name was Robert. Huge portions here. My wife and I shared a Hawaiian Salad. Our daughters had a custom made garlic butter spaghetti. Fodd was great. We split a piece of chocolate cheesecake (how could you not!)"
Bj U.,"Waianae, HI",244,109,15,4.0,9/1/2012,"After a day of fun we decided cheese cake factory sounded like a topper for our evening, and we were not disappointed. the waiter came out immediately with the bread and ordered our drinks.. ect. everything was pretty snappy. the calamari and kaluapig nachos for starters (calamari was for me) i had the chicken madeiro with cheese and mushroom cooked in some sweet sauce, it was pretty amazing. i totally forgot what she had but she kept ""mmmmmmm""ing then we had a crap load of nice fruity, sweet drinks... which sky rocketed our bill LOL but overall was a pleasant experience bread was plentiful drinks were pretty good and go early if you hate waiting in line because sometimes its really long. Boom-"
James S.,"Honolulu, HI",9,12,,1.0,4/29/2012,"I am writing this as a person who has never been to The Cheesecake Factory because everyone on the whole island of Oahu wants to go at the same time I do. My wife and I seem to always go there when the only way to get a table is to be put on a 15 year waiting list. So we hop over to Margaritaville......BAM. MESSAGE TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY...FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, START TAKING RESERVATIONS...ARE YOU SERIOUS?"
Stephanie C.,"Vancouver, Canada",7,26,,2.0,5/6/2012,"The Cheesecake Fatory chain is nothing more than mediocre. The line is atrocious, I think people were waiting over an hour for a table when there were plenty of empty tables not being filled by any one of their THOUSAND staff members... The service is lackluster, and you can easily go anywhere else to get food of that quality. Please don't waste your vacation away waiting in line for meh-food. Try something, and/or somewhere you don't have at home!"
Jason M.,"Honolulu, HI",98,38,55,5.0,6/26/2014,"Great food, great service! Just always super packed, the wait to eat was about 40mins but it was worth the wait! This was a first time eating there for my wife and I! Will defiantly be back!"
Jan N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",109,20,6,4.0,7/20/2015,"Took my family for a nice dinner before my son ships out and we were not disappointed for the most part. My hubby had the special Mac Nut crusted Ono fish and the fish was pretty dry. Everyone else loved their choices. Service was amazing, quick and attentive. The only thing I hated was the wait...almost an hour but, I guess it's because it's a weekend and it's Waikiki.."
Christopher M.,"Boston, MA",49,53,2,4.0,7/18/2014,Great atmosphere and really good food. Works well for large party. The location could not be better!
Michael S.,"Honolulu, HI",170,159,330,2.0,12/9/2011,"After years of being open and having lived in Hawaii all my life I've never had a chance to have dinner at The Cheesecake factory. The food wasn't that bad but the wait was horrible. Parking: This one of the main two negatives of this place. Difficult to find or no free parking. Sure you can park in the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center parking lot and walk like a block and then still pay or you can walk a bit more and park for free by Kapahulu Atmosphere: Overall its pretty nice. I like the look and feel of the Cheesecake factory. For some reason it reminds me of Vegas. Dark  lighting, music in the back ground and nicely decorated surroundings. Service: The biggest negative of this place is the usually long wait. I went in with my girlfriend for a 7:30 dinner time on a Thursday night.  We put our name in and 40 minutes later we sat down. I particularly don't like to wait for any restaurant this wait was extra long. Overall service wasn't that bad  once we actually sat down. The waitress was helpful and the water was never empty. Another negative was that we were very close to another couple. Basically it felt like we were sitting at the same table together. It didn't feel like talking because it would have interpreted our neighbors conversations Price: Since this was my first real visit I was pretty surprised at the overall prices. I always thought it was in the 20-25$ range to eat here but there are at least half the entrees within the $10-17 range. I choose a chicken club type sandwich which came out to $12 but was pretty big including the fries.  I'm sure everyone can easily find a good meal for $15.  One negative regarding pricing is that Cheesecake factory rarely participates in any kinds of discounts of coupons Food: So my sandwich tasted great, but it did come with some cost.  Nutritionally the food is horrible for you. Just look up the nutritional value  and you'll see that most of the meals have all the Fat, cholesterol and sodium you'll need for the entire day.  One of the negatives of my sandwich (chicken club) was that the bread was toasted and loaded with butter. Every time I touched my sandwich my hands felt really oily.   Overall: The Cheesecake Factory is pretty safe and to be expected(other then slightly lower then expected cost).  It's a pretty nice place overall, but be ready to wait hours for cramped quarters. Also just like any other chain restaurant expect the food to be filled with perservatitives that make the food last longer."
Kristian Ø.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,5.0,10/29/2014,We love this place. Mostly because of the cheesecakes! Yummy! But the main dishes are tasty as well. We went here three times during our vacation and had good service and good food all times. Try the strawberry cheesecake. It is so delicious!
Raymond P.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,2.0,2/25/2014,"We are regulars .  We understand that it is as busy place. Yes, they have to be quick on their feet and turn tables around. But to take short cuts on the verge of being unsanitary ...  That's where we draw the line... Perhaps the lure of a bigger profit margin is the cause. Or just plain laziness. In any case it will be a long time before We patronize this establishment again. Train your employees . Pay attention . It's the little things that count ."
Micah S.,"Geelong, Australia",1,9,,5.0,9/30/2014,"This place is amazing! The restaurant is huge with so many people there all the time! I'm not into full restaurants as I'm not into waiting for service or food, but the setup here is amazing, we were never waiting too long and the food is incredible! The menu is huge with options to suit all tastes. I had a BBQ burger and it was one of the best I've ever had. I'm also big on good service and the Cheesecake Factory did not let me down they have so many staff that al"
