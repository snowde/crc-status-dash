Preston I.,"Houston, TX",318,87,112,5.0,12/24/2017,"Came here for a late Christmas Eve brunch. I really appreciate the feel of this restaurant. It's casual yet well put together at the same time.  I ordered the egg roll sampler and the chicken samosas. They're both technically appetizers, but together they were more than enough for me. The sampler is basically one of each of their egg rolls. The cool part is that they let you trade one out for a roll that you enjoy more, so I traded the Cuban egg roll for another Tex Mex. it was a great decision. The rolls were delicious, and they paired well with the sauces that accompanied them. You get four large egg roll for $11. The samosas were also super good. You get four good-sized ones for $7.  My sister got enchiladas with black beans, and she seemed to like it a lot. My mom ordered the pineapple chicken and shrimp wth rice. She doesn't like eating out that much, but she said that she enjoyed the meal. The service was the best part of the outing. Our waitress, Alexis, was amazing! She had a great, amicable personality and was very helpful. She kept the free bread coming as well and checked on us often. Definitely one of the best servers I've ever encountered."
Carmen W.,"Houston, TX",122,131,163,1.0,1/2/2018,"Want to hear a funny, but really not funny review? Want to experience the hilarity of this review? Just go the Cheesecake Factory Galleria location!  My mom and I decided to meet one day for lunch here. It's a rare occasion, so we were pretty excited about the time to spend enjoying lunch. I got to the restaurant first, and pretty early. I was sitting outside the restaurant in the small waiting area and a manager (I got his name, and I want to say that it was David, but *disclaimer* that might be totally incorrect, however that is what I will call him for the sake of this review. Either way, he was bald, about 5'11"", and light skinned with an accent.) approached me and asked me ""can I help you?"" Sort of arrogantly. I said ""no"" just as arrogantly back. He looked at me like he was offended, and I thought to myself, ""well, I'd be offended too."" But I kept that thought to myself and told him ""I'm waiting on someone."" While I was waiting, I noticed there was a gift card promotion going on - buy a gift card, get a free cheesecake. I approached the host stand to ask about it, but all I was able to say was ""I have a question about the gift card promotion."" Before the hostess cut me off, and pointed to the to go counter and said ""Gift cards that way."" And went back to tapping away on her little host screen.  I begrudgingly went to the to go counter and got my answer about the gift cards, went back outside to sit, and waited for my mom. Once she got there, we went inside and were greeted by a much nicer hostess who walked us to our table.  Our server, Tony, came and greeted us after a few minutes of us sitting there. He was a good server, I want to emphasize that. It wasn't his fault about what happened next.  He brought us butter and bread. Frozen butter. And cold bread. We were cool with the cold bread, but my mom couldn't handle the frozen, unspreadable butter so she sent it back. When tony returned with the 2nd butter, it too, was frozen. She handed him back the butter, and the 3rd time he brought it, it was finally melted enough to spread. Then my mom received her coke. She could tell by tasting it that it was Diet Coke. She pulled Tony aside and asked him why he'd brought her a Diet Coke, and he said ""how can you tell?!"" Wow. Anyways, he went to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later to apologize to her and explained that ""someone"" in the kitchen had switched the connections between the coke nozzle and Diet Coke nozzle but that it was being fixed. He brought her a new coke once the machine was corrected. It was flat. 100% broke-down, on the side of the road, flat.  We called over the manager, David, and he seemed like we disturbed him from his very busy shift. He nodded and acted interested while my mom told him about our experience thus far. He didn't apologize, he made excuses. While we was making excuses to my mom, I was observing him, and I noticed something strange: he had on a rubber bracelet- the kind that are given out at events with words printed on them. His said in big bold white letters ""Don't be a little b*tch!!!""  I interrupted his excuses and said to him ""Nice bracelet."" I've never seen someone go so rigid and panicky as they came to the realization of their error. He slowly reached down to this wrist and turned the bracelet inside out. He nodded and remained speechless for the first time in minutes. I told him I'd once worked in the restaurant industry for quite some time, and that his behavior and presentation was completely unacceptable. He asked me ""oh yeah? What restaurant?"" Again, no apologies. He changed the subject to something that was irrelevant, and then he excused himself from the table.  At the end of our meal, when Tony dropped off the check, I put my debit card in the check presenter. David came by quickly, took my debit card out, slid it towards me, and said ""Sorry it didn't go so well today."" And as he was walking off refusing to make eye contact with me, I heard him mutter ""maybe next times better."" I'm sorry, but paying for my food doesn't make me forget about the bracelet or the experience. This review needs to be seen by corporate, and that manager needs to be reprimanded and written up. That's all there is to say about that."
Joe C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",99,618,139,4.0,12/24/2017,"I should hate the Cheesecake Factory. The food is the absolute epitome of corporate chain fare, the atmosphere is perfect for where you're most likely to find them - in or next two a major shopping mall - and you will never encounter a cocktail that hasn't been carefully planned and focus-tested at the bar. But when you have a waiter as enthusiastic as ours who does such a good job, and the rest of the place holds up its end of the bargain ... I just can't help it. I can justify it under the mediocrity principle,* since one of the reasons chains became popular in the first place is poor quality control among independent restaurants in the pre-McDonald's era. If you have never been to a Cheesecake Factory, you'll probably think it's fine, and if you're a return customer, you already know if you'll like it or not. This is an excellent Cheesecake Factory judged on its own terms, and the staff are great. I'll vote for a million other spots in Houston, but I'll say yes every time someone else wants to come here. * ref. Dave Barry's ""Mr. Mediocre"" restaurant chain idea."
Leslie G.,"Houston, TX",11,25,29,3.0,1/8/2018,"So yes, this is a chain and all but I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it. This location especially. Something about the galleria one always brings nostalgia considering I've been coming here for years. Both the service and the food never disappoints. The portions are large so I always share my entree. Cheesecake wise, they're supposed to be known for it but to be honest, it's just ""ok"". I've had better cheesecake and the variety of choices not only is overwhelming, but dilutes the quality of the cheesecake overalls Another downside is that if you're coming during dinner, expect to wait a bit."
Lan N.,"Houston, TX",146,174,688,2.0,11/3/2017,"Honestly, I have never liked Cheesecake Factory any of the times I've been and I've been sure to try a different dish every time to give them the benefit of the doubt. Their take on simple dishes from fish tacos to gumbo to simple Chinese inspired dishes are just overwhelming in flavor and not in a good way. Either it's intensely salty or another extreme. I had the crispy chicken and shrimp in pineapple sauce today and it was just way too strong in flavor. My sister and I ordered the same dish and she couldn't even bring herself to take more than 3 bites. Asked if she wanted it to go and she said ""if I didn't like it here I'm not going to like it at home.""  Also our waitress was talking and cursing at about something behind us. Weird experience."
Lisa K.,"The Woodlands, TX",231,965,2392,5.0,10/13/2017,"Stopped in for a quick lunch before work! Fast, friendly, and attentive! Patrick was my server. He was awesome! I told him I had to eat and run! Food came out less than 10 minutes for two skinny dishes.  Beet & goat cheese salad & shrimp spring rolls. Â Not my Mommas spring rolls but very Americanized. Lots of veggies and noodles. The dip is Amazing!!! I loved it! I think it's Americanized peanut sauce. That's how it taste.  Enjoyed CheeseCake Galleria!"
Mirna C.,"Houston, TX",58,79,350,4.0,10/14/2017,Can't go wrong with cheesecake. This location is a little trick to get to and the parking is confusing but the service is very friendly.  I'm so glad they're open late. One of the few places close to where I live that closes after 11 pm. I had the Asian salad from the skinnylicious menu. It was good and filling. Didn't have room for awesome cheesecake. Although my favorite one is the tuxedo one. Chocolately but not too much.
Tay S.,"Webster, TX",41,8,10,5.0,1/7/2018,The food is simply amazing... great non- meat dishes for us who don't eat meat ... and the bread and butter is so delicious
Debra T.,"The Heights, Houston, TX",161,13,,1.0,12/23/2017,"The take out service is horrible... we are staying at the hotel next door, so we ordered food, we didn't receive any plastic ware, napkins, etc.. so we called the manager he suggested we walk down and everything would be ready.. it wasn't and they gave me 2 forks instead of a full set up..  come on... it's holidays, we are trying to shop and enjoy are day, not babysit"
Elva V.,"Texas City, TX",1,3,1,5.0,1/1/2018,New Years Day; quick professional service. Food is absolutely amazing. Good quality savory ingredients burst threw each bite.
G T.,"Brownsville, TX",31,51,102,5.0,1/5/2018,This place is always good. Had chicken littles. The chicken was very juicy and crispy. The sauces were very good. Service was superb. Can't remember ever having a bad experience here. Everything i have tried is good.
Briana H.,"Durham, NC",302,188,1599,5.0,12/6/2017,"I love this location. Keep in mind that it is busy all of the time. This is a two story cheesecake factory. The to go ordering as well as the cheesecake is located on the second floor. The hostess stand is also located on the second floor. Even though this location is very busy all of the time, if you place a to go order it will always take about 15 to 20 minutes which isn't bad. The staff is super nice and pleasant to work with. The food is super tasty and You can pretty much create whatever type of dish that you want to create. I chose the favorite pasta dish it has no meat but I switched out the mushrooms for broccoli and I also added the Creole sauce that comes on the Louisiana chicken pasta. I must say it is the absolute best pasta that I have ever had from cheesecake factory. I will be coming to this location and ordering again."
Sean W.,"Houston, TX",70,42,8,2.0,12/8/2017,"Ordered the pasta napoletana, to go, tonight. Â When i got home i had received a big plate of pasta with various meats on top. Â No sauce. Â Just dry pasta, pepperoni and meatballs. Â When i called cheesecake factory, i explained what had happened to find out if maybe i had misunderstood what i had ordered. Â The pure dismissive nature of the person that answered the phone was horrendous. Â  Me: Â ""yes, i ordered your pasta napolatena and i had a question. Â I received my order and i thought it came with a sauce on it."" Host: Â ""ok?"" Me: Â ""sorry, im asking, does it usually have a sauce on it?"" Host: Â ""im not sure, let me check. Â Yeah, it has a tomato sauce on it."" Me: Â ""oh ok, because i dont think mine came with it. Â Its just pasta with some meatballs and pepperoni on top."" Host: ""ok."" Me: Â ""umm, ok.......well, i guess maybe you can let your chef know for quality control purposes?"" Host: Â ""ok, i will."" Â (Click)  So not only is my order missing a part of it, but i get crap service to follow it up. Â But i get it. Â Its Saturday night. Â She probably just wanted to leave and didnt have time to do her job."
Nav E.,"Northwest Houston, Houston, TX",149,31,55,4.0,9/17/2017,I love this location and the food is always amazing. Service depends on the time of day you come. But overall there is so much to choose from the menu that no matter who you with you are guaranteed to satisfy every pallet. Usually order for the Madera chicken or the Cobb salad and of course to finish it off with a Godiva cheesecake Today the service was slow and a waitress never came back to check up on up also forgot to give us utensils. But I guess she was a little bit too busy... but she was super super sweet so she made up for it
Scott W.,"Spring, TX",1,13,1,3.0,12/30/2017,We came for dessert. Â Our waiter spilled a water to start the evening and it took three trips to get it dried up. Â There store was busy but the overall service was middling. Â The cheesecake was far from the best we have had and prices a bit higher than some other places but not too bad. Â They have a huge variety which was nice. Â As I said it was busy. Â Our table was being bussed while we were winding down which is disconcerting. Â The check came with several to suggestions. The smallest starting at 22%. I'm not excited about this place at all.
Niya R.,"Houston, TX",444,93,263,3.0,2/13/2017,"We stopped in to do a post dinner dessert option because I was really craving cheesecake. No wait, sat at the upstairs bar and enjoyed Grand Marnier and Turtle Cheesecake. Our drinks were fair in portion and the cheesecake was absolutely fabulous. I love how many options they have for desert. Lucia, our bartender was very busy with drinks but luckily we aren't needy and knew exactly what we needed. She chatted with us for a little while and enjoyed each other's company.  The only reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because of all of the disgusting fruit flies. I mean it was ridiculous, so bad we had to move down a few seats. At one point, there was one in my cake! How disappointing. I won't let that affect my visits here in the future, but advice to management - that issue needs to be corrected immediately."
Michael E.,"Sherwood, AR",280,102,110,4.0,7/26/2017,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. So much variety in everything they have on the menu. I wish they were a little cheaper and had less calories. Oh And I wish i didn't have to walk 3 miles inside the Galleria mall to find the place. Â But the walk back to the car did make my selection of a S'mores Cheesecake more palatable. Overall Great place, I wish we had one in Little Rock."
Charlie Y.,"Houston, TX",0,97,,3.0,12/20/2017,"Please take the Cuban crispy rolls off the menu, they were lousy (greasy and tasteless). Otherwise, food was ok, service was very good and cheesecake was delicious. Good location will bring us back again."
Ebonie M.,"Galleria/Uptown, Houston, TX",223,203,1407,4.0,11/11/2016,"This restaurant chain is always a great spot for friends to get together. No matter where I've been in the US, the decor is spectacular, food is good and the facility is clean.  We were celebrating a coworker's birthday during work hours. The waitress got us in and out in a timely manner and was very attentive. I ordered the teriyaki chicken breast. The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The only drawback with this particular location is parking. You can spend 10 minutes looking for parking in the garage or you can pay to valet."
Coty W.,"Houston, TX",70,2,4,4.0,9/2/2017,"Finding a good place for lunch isn't a easy task especially if your located in the Galleria surrounded by so many great restaurants. Â I personally like to go go with what I know. Â I love enjoying lunch at the Cheesecake Factory is great. Â I'm pretty much a regular here and I love the ambiance here. Â The restaurant is two levels. You can enter the restaurant from the second floor of the mall or you can park outside the mall and walk directly into the restaurant. The only parking next to the restaurant are Valet Parking or pay meter. Â Me and a co worked came to enjoy a little lunch after helping volunteer at the George R Brown center during hurricane Harvey! Â You can always count on this place not being overly crowded for lunch and being able to enjoy a great conversation with some really cool friends or family. Â  I'm a pasta lover and the Cheesecake Factory is the boss of all pastas!!! Â I normally order the Cajun Jambalaya but I order the Louisiana Cajun Chicken pasta!! Â It was delicious I'm not a big fan of really spicy foods but the Cajun pastas here seems to be more Cajun spice rub more so than a spicy sauce.. Â  The Louisiana Cajun pasta was not spicy but did have a little kick not too much. Â It comes with diced peppers (yellow and green) sautÃ©ed and mushrooms I order my pasta without the mushrooms because of food allergy. None the less it was perfect the chicken was lightly fried with a bit of crispy batter and the chicken was not dry at all. Â  My meal was great, and my Pineapple Mojito was so good and just right!!! My only flaw and I'll make sure to tell my waiter the next time please! light on the mint!!!! Other than that this is the best place for lunch with friends. Â The restaurant is clean, the waiters are familiar with the menu and everyone who works there seems to be happy and very friendly  Hope you get to do lunch here soon!!"
David D.,"Pearland, TX",84,32,89,4.0,10/20/2017,"Like a worn old shoe. This place is familiar and you learn to have your favorites. The staff is always hit or miss, I blame that on management. Tonight it was sloppy at best, just like the manager on duty. We had the gluten free Shepard's Pie and a slice of Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The Shepard's is always a huge portion and a blissful indulgence. This version of a key lime cheesecake is an utter sin. You need to Â visit your priest for a full six months to get over it. I love how the check has the tip ranges broken out."
Ashlynn C.,"Houston, TX",2,23,13,1.0,9/30/2017,"Went in on a Saturday night to pick up some cheesecakes, and the place was extremely busy and loud, as expected. After the server took my order at the walk up register, we stood to the side watching them work and noticed that instead of packing up our cheesecakes, the server/cashier just stood around waiting for someone else to come up and order.  I get that there is an assigned person to pack up the stuff, but if you see that everyone else is busy, how about lend a hand and pack up some of your to-go orders so they don't have to wait so long. I'm pretty patient, but if I see you standing around doing nothing while I'm waiting for you to fulfill my order, that's going to annoy me a little. Also, I watched her as she realized we hadn't gotten our order yet, and it had been over 20 minutes.  She proceeded to fill the order herself, but as she did that, I saw that she licked her finger and used that to grab the wax/tissue paper that they use to grab the cheesecake from their trays. I'm trying not to think about how there's contamination on my cheesecake since we waited so long and had to pay extra for parking just to get the stuff. So if you have an aversion to germs and other people putting their saliva on your food, maybe pay attention to your servers. Also, maybe avoid this lady in particular."
Monique T.,"Houston, TX",29,12,34,5.0,8/18/2017,Love this location Best to come in early in Friday since it does get packed fairly fast They have great variety if you are a vegetarian . We always get great service  I especially like their skinny menu and usually order a salad with grilled salmon  So far live it here
Karolina T.,"Northside, Houston, TX",0,1,4,3.0,10/28/2017,It's okay the food is tasty but the silverware was dirty Â Other than that it's a nice place to eat
Ema E.,"Houston, TX",177,81,4,4.0,9/29/2017,Wait was rather long... but I will say the staff is friendly. Food orders were correct and very tasty. Not first tone here... but haven't been to this location since around 2012... Good experience. Great server... went above minimum to ensure his 30%tip from each of us
Eugenia C.,"Southwest Houston, Houston, TX",940,79,166,2.0,3/19/2017,"Parking to come to Cheesecake factory at this location is not optimal.  The food here is consistent and the menu selection is broad. There is something for everyone. I usually get a pasta dish and sometimes try a new cheesecake which never disappoints. Cheesecake factory is almost the same everywhere with decoir and food consistency, so I can really only differentiate with service here. Service could have improved for sure. Twice I asked for a warm batch of new bread, that took an extra 20 minutes to get to me and wasn't even warm (though he said it was ""fresh from the oven"") :( I have waited tables in my past experiences so I don't usually harp on trivial things, but the butter wouldn't even melt on my bread LOL. We didn't get checked on or water refills -- which just confused me because it was past rush hour. Ended up staying here around 2.5 hours for dinner at 7:30 partially because it took so long to get our food. I also wish they did something complimentary cheesecake or something for birthdays, but they only decorate the dessert for you. oh well :( You get a happy birthday song by your server and 1 other unlucky server who happened to be dragged over. Next time, I'd probably opt for a different location."
Aaron J.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,25,,2.0,12/2/2017,This restaurant is too cold which spoils the experience... Otherwise everything is typical cheesecake factory.
Annie I.,"Houston, TX",146,9,6,5.0,8/1/2017,"I don't go to The Cheesecake Factory often, usually just on special occasions. I went this past Sunday to celebrate a friend's birthday and it just so happened to be half priced cheesecakes that day. You can't pass up that promotion for a Cheesecake that's normally $8. I would normally avoid going to the Galleria area because of the heavy traffic on the road and on foot but it's nearly impossible to avoid that around this restaurant in any part of town.  Despite all that and the overpriced food, it was worth it. I ordered the Chicken Madeira with Strawberry lemonade and the coffee and cream chocolate supreme (I forgot what it was called) cheesecake. I loved the dish more than the cheesecake. I mean you'd think their cheesecakes are better than their entrees with a restaurant name like that but it's not going to keep me from coming back. There are tons of other flavors I have yet to try. The wait time wasn't so bad. They told us 10-15 minutes and there were already a ton of people there before us, however, I guess that just depends on how big your party is. The waiter was really nice too. He made sure to keep checking back on us and there was no hassle at all."
M D.,"Silver City, NM",0,49,4,4.0,12/10/2017,This place is obviously extremely popular. Â It's crowded and you can expect a wait. Â The service isn't too fast as it is so busy but it is friendly and accurate. Â The food is good and there is a huge variety. Â The only real drawback is that everyone seems to agree with my opinion. Â I'd recommend it if you aren't in a hurry.
Jalena D.,"Hobart, IN",33,31,75,5.0,3/9/2017,"Visited the Cheesecake Factory in the Galleria Mall with my mother. I would have to say that this has been the best Cheesecake Factory experience I have ever had. The food was good, but the service was even better.  Our server was Justin Cyrus, and was awesome on so many different levels. His service definitely overshadowed the food and cheesecake. Justin is so friendly and you can tell that he takes pride in his job and customers. Justin never missed a beat, our order was precise and he constantly checked to see how we were doing. He is very personable; being able to hold a conversation with his customers and he able to relate to his customers. I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in Chicago and did not receive service as this.  Justin is truly one of a kind. When you come in, please ask for Justin, he will make your Cheesecake Factory experience worth while. Justin is an excellent server with an awesome personality. Kudos to you Justin!"
Bradley R.,"Pasadena, TX",14,160,21,4.0,8/8/2016,"Never been to the Houston Galleria CF - oversight on my part. My wife and I had a big dinner planned for later, so we were looking for a tasty cocktail and appetizer. FOUND. Wife ordered a LOVED a drink called Whiskey Smash, while I really enjoyed a Long Island Iced Tea with spicy chicken nachos. Yummy. We really enjoyed the second (or lower) floor of the restaurant, since to top floor was rather hectic and loud - good for the younger set (which we ain't). Great service, decent prices, fun place to go - especially if you love cheesecake!"
Teef C.,"Newport Beach, CA",83,252,1250,2.0,1/8/2017,This is one of the worst cheesecake factories I have ever been to. Â I would not ever come back here for a meal. My burger wasn't cooked properly and tasted disgusting to the point where I didn't even finish itS. The cheesecake I had was decent.
Sarah M.,"Houston, TX",54,164,231,3.0,7/16/2017,"Spouse and I had some errands to run at the Galleria, so we decided to grab dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. We have only been here together once since chain restaurants are not our jam. However, it was a pleasant dinner. Ambience-the lighting is low and warm. We were seated on a booth with other tables adjoining, but there are solo booths available. Bread is complimentary, and the brown bread is a winnerThe menu is giant. Massive. Enormous. We opted to split some small plates, which was PLENTY for two grown adults. The chicken samosas arrived first. They were flavorful and crisp. The accompanying sauce was tasty as well. Cuban egg rolls came next-they were not my fave. The mustard sauce was thin and the egg roll itself was not cohesive. But it was fine. Nashville nuggets were another small plate we sampled. They are not anything brand new-just chicken nuggets with hot sauce or Buffalo sauce. But they were tasty. The dish in last place was the truffle cheese sticks (bacon truffle cheese sticks? Something like that). Avoid. It was just grease. Flavorless grease. ""Flavorless Grease"" is a great name for a band. Terrible when it describes your food. So overall, our small plates were fine. What brings this review up to 3 stars were the speedy and attentive service as well as the cheesecake. Red Velvet cheesecake. So light, so delicious. Absolutely worth it. Overall, a fine dinner at Cheesecake Factory. The cost was great, the quality was fine, and the cheesecake was delish"
Tracy L.,"Houston, TX",52,64,222,5.0,6/30/2017,"Came here with a friend for his birthday. Just the 2 of us were sat immediately around 2:30 on a Friday afternoon. Service was good. We ordered fried Mac & cheese (~$11-12) as an appetizer. It took a little while but we weren't complaining since we were catching up. The manager stopped by to apologize about the wait and explained they had cooked one less than what was suppose to be delivered so they'll have it out in just a moment. Very soon after, 4 perfectly fried Mac & cheese balls were delivered. They were awesome! For our main course, we both ordered from the lunch menu. He had grilled salmon which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli ($15.50). He said it was good. I ordered the miso salmon which comes with rice but asked to sub it out with mashed potatoes ($15.50). It was great! I really enjoyed my miso salmon because it had a sweetness to it. I highly recommend it and will order it again. I could only eat 1/3 of it because I was full after the bread and 1 fried Mac ball. Packed it up because I don't waste food. I highly recommend the red velvet cheesecake but my friend wanted the Reese's cheesecake, so we ordered that to go for him because you can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake! Plus it was his birthday, and his first visit to CCF ever. When the check came, I was surprised to see how they had comped our fried Mac & cheese balls. Total was $43. Hadn't been to CCF in years, and I forgot how tasty they were. Looking forward to my next visit. :)"
Erin C.,"Houston, TX",54,68,229,4.0,8/7/2016,"On a Sunday afternoon just before 1pm there was a 20 minute wait, which was acceptable with two young kids in tow. Â We quickly ordered and got our food really fast which I was thankful for since we were starving. The ahi tuna tataki salad and chopped chicken salad were both fair to good. Â I enjoyed the brown bread they served with the meal and I am not a bread person at all, so that's saying a lot. Our kids shared a personal pizza which the gobbled right up. It was a great experience given it was fast and good with a starving family"
Cristian G.,"Houston, TX",618,24,3,5.0,8/13/2017,Haven't been to this place in a long time and I must say from the service to the food I was impressed.  I didn't order alcohol beverages because it was a very chill dinner. Jasmine was awesome had us laughing and giving her recommendations and I must say that lovely lady knows her stuff. Will definitely be back.
Julienne T.,"Houston, TX",314,78,593,4.0,7/18/2017,"I frequent this location because I am closer to this area than the others. My favorite dishes are the Thai lettuce wrap and the Pasta Da Vinci. The Thai lettuce wrap comes with about 6 pieces of chicken, some veggies, and 3 different sauces. I usually order the Pasta Da Vinci because I like how the flavors are not too bold and it comes with mushrooms. Service is consistent most of the time. There's usually a long wait during the weekend, which is understandable. If you're coming from the inside of the Galleria Mall, it's much easier than coming in the main entrance. By entering the main entrance, you have to climb a set of stairs before you are able to do anything. The restroom is also located downstairs so make your pit stop before you walk back downstairs if you're coming from the front (or just go when you leave). Parking is usually a hassle because you have shoppers and customers from other restaurants parked in the same garage."
Rafael C.,"Houston, TX",0,2,2,5.0,11/5/2017,"Great service, they are all very nice but what makes this place even better is chef Chuy!!! The best combination between kind people and exquisite meals in a family friendly environment."
Tom C.,"Watertown, NY",1,70,97,4.0,6/29/2017,Great place and a great menu. Still the best cheesecake you can get in America. Get the Red Velvet.
Scott J.,"Houston, TX",2,9,1,1.0,10/28/2017,What a disappointment. I ordered simple spaghetti with meatballs. It took almost an hour to bring out while families that sat down after us were already eating. When it came out it was lukewarm and utterly flavorless. Waste of time and money. Skip the chains and go to a local family owned business. Cheesecake Factory should stick to just cheesecake.
