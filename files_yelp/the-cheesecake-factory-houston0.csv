Jamie E.,"Houston, TX",140,268,82,2.0,6/28/2013,"This is standard American food. Huge portions, pretty delicious cheesecake. So why 2 stars? Because I got some cheesecake to go, and I as the person behind the counter was putting my food in a bag, he decided that he was going to drop it. Yes, that's right. Drop it. And then he looked at me, obviously thought that I didn't see even though I was watching him, and put it back in the bag. Half of the topping of my original cheesecake was on the top. So half of my cheesecake was just boring cheesecake, and the rest was super delicious.  Looking back, I should have said something. ""HEY. I watched you drop my cheesecake. Replace it."" But I didn't, and my annoyance has now transferred to my Yelp review."
James S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,396,166,2.0,2/10/2014,"Having been to other Cheesecake Factory locations, Las Vegas and San Antonio, I must say I was disappointed in this one. It was very busy for a Monday night but our stated 30 minute wait was actually only 20. Taking into account that the place was busy our wait time for drinks and food was long. Our waitress got the orders right but it took 15 minutes for drinks and 30 for our foo; we ordered tea and water and salads and a rare burger. My Cesaer salad was OK but the chicken had no season or taste really and I'm the least pickest eater I know. The are so many options in the area, I'd suggest looking else, especially if in a hurry."
Jason L.,"Houston, TX",12,17,34,3.0,4/3/2015,I couldn't in all honesty give it 4 stars today thanks to my inattentive server. I ordered iced tea and never received sweeteners until after my food arrived. I was never offered the complimentary bread which is a highlight of coming here. I didn't get offered a refill on my tea until after I finished my meal! I'm sorely disappointed in what's been a favorite of mine since it opened.
Lynsey B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,3,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Horrible service - waited an hour for meal, when the meal arrived it was burnt. Manager came over and he said, ""you aren't happy"" then said I'll let you eat and come back.  Didn't see him again. Don't waste your money!"
Tim S.,"Monument, CO",64,584,22,4.0,1/28/2015,"Very inviting interior, above average in every respect for a Cheesecake Factory.  Given its location and foot traffic I am impressed with how quickly we were seated.  The quality of the food exceeded expectations, but it was rather slow in arriving.  Service was friendly but more frequent check-ins would have been appreciated.  Was very impressed that they remembered us and what we ordered even a week later.  Would definitely visit again."
Paulette M.,"Humble, TX",20,10,2,1.0,12/11/2015,"Today I brought my group of seniors to eat here.  This was our main reason for visiting the Galleria. I had heard the food was the best, the price was the best and the service was better than best.  Here are the facts: We arrived at The Cheesecake Factory and were seated at 11:05 AM.  We met our sweet and very cordial waitress.  She got us our drinks, mostly water. Then we gave our orders for our meals.  We were a group of nine elderly persons.  We told the waitress how we looked forward to this treat of eating at this nice restaurant.  She brought us bread and butter and more bread and butter and this was delicious .  When we first arrived at the restaurant and at our table, we were the only customers in this area.  By the time we got our bread, more people were sitting around us.  Around Noon most of the people around us were already eating their meals.  We were still being served bread.  Though the bread was delicious,we really wondered where our meals were.  We spoke to the manager and told him we needed to be on a bus at 1:00 PM and asked where were our meals.  He said they will be here soon.    At 12:30 (Now remember we did have to be on the bus by 1:00 PM)we were still waiting for our food.  We saw our waitress running quickly with food for every other table.  We finally told the manager and our waitress to be sure to bring some take home containers and bags because it seemed like we weren't going to have time to eat there.  They said all would  be okay.  and finally at 12:35 some meals started arriving at our tables.  Some were quickly removed because they were someone else's order.  We did get our meals and had about 10 minutes to eat what we had ordered.  Most of us put the meal in our carry out bag. We had been in that restaurant sitting down for an hour and a half before we were served a meal.  My meal was eaten as a take home for supper, a very expensive ""TV microwave meal."" And I didn't even have time to buy a slice of cheese cake. This was the first time any of us had eaten here before and I am sure it will be the last time because I do believe that the manager should have given us these meals on the house... I hate to say it but I believe if we had been a group of young business men we would have gotten our meals comp or we would have walked out.  Going to the Cheesefactory today was a trip planned to be so much fun for many seniors who looked forward to this for over a month and what a let down it was, thanks the manager who didn't even acknowledge his responsibility to his customers."
D J.,"Houston, TX",1,69,20,2.0,1/8/2016,"I will bump them up one star only because I actually did get a response from corporate with an apology letter and a gift card about a month after my complaint. I still can't bring myself to eat here anymore due to the lack of cleanliness, but at least they responded."
Seidi W.,"Suisun City, CA",14,114,7,5.0,3/10/2015,"Fantastic Louisiana chicken pasta! Not on our menu in CA, but a must try if you are in TX.  Typical Cheesecake Factory setting"
Brian J.,"Houston, TX",50,1,,2.0,4/3/2016,Good service. Waited a while for our food. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. It was completely raw on the inside. They cooked it again and it was fine though
Yaser A.,"Houston, TX",5,29,13,4.0,5/12/2014,"I love this restaurant. Been to this location several times and have always been welcomed with great service.  The food is delicious and consistent, especially the dessert. One time I ordered a medium well steak and it came a bit over cooker. The waitress happily took it and apologized. The manager passed by and apologized as well and offered me a soup on the house while I waited as well as dessert afterwards. Amazing customer service especially when I didn't really complain.  I dropped a star for one reason, this location gets quiet busy given that its connected to a shopping mall. Waiting time could go up to an hour even for a party of 2. That's not why I dropped a star though. They have a whole ground floor which I have never seen them use no matter how busy it got (at least never when I was there)."
Valerie H.,"Houston, TX",99,328,97,4.0,11/16/2013,"This is one of those places I've been to 500x, and just now realize I have yet to review! We'll, I'm happy to say that in my entire 29 years living in Houston, I've always experienced exceptional service here, and great food. The menu has a little bit of everything; Mexican, American, a little Asian ... Literally somehow for everyone, even kids. And the desserts! My obsession with strawberry shortcake started here. It's served with a sugared biscuit! Needless to say, we're fans and will be back again and again."
Maria L.,"Houston, TX",0,9,13,2.0,6/9/2015,"Went here for drinks and cheesecake... Specialty drink was awesome, cheesecake was ok (too sweet for my taste), but the service was AWFUL... Waiter seemed uninterested as soon as I said I was ""only"" having drinks and dessert (as opposed to a full meal)... Finished my drink halfway through the cheesecake, and was never asked if I wanted another drink. After finishing the cheesecake, my table was cleared, and after a (quite a long) while, I received the check (without asking for one)... No one ever asked if I wanted something more! I would've had another drink, thank you very much, but you missed out on that... Won't be going back."
Mariah D.,"Houston, TX",409,483,261,3.0,7/31/2014,"With a poorly composed novel of a menu, prices too high for an average weekday dinner, service too slow and young to compensate for the cost and a location smack-dab in the worst area in Houston for traffic and parking, you're gonna really have to do something to get me in the door.  That something comes once a year in the form of half price cheesecake. They've always let me order 2 slices at half price. And for the amount of money spent on dinner and the time spent waiting, I damn well should get 2 half price slices. But bring your hillbilly friends and family from out of town to this ""fancy"" two story restaurant located in a ""glamorous"" mall and they'll be convinced they've died and gone to heaven and that you are the classiest person to walk the earth."
Lillie G.,"Houston, TX",3,23,18,1.0,1/17/2016,I'm actually sitting here right now very disappointed. I ordered the zucchini avocado and mushroom fries with a side salad. The waiter must be new he wasn't consistent with checking my table and didn't acknowledge when I needed a refill on my drink until I asked him and instead of getting me a new glass he takes my cup and refills it?? When I got my fries they were very poorly served/made and didn't even have avocados in it! And my fries felt soggy af! And one of the sauces was already halfway gone?? My salad seemed like it was either sitting out too long or had too much dressing? This was the worst visit I have ever had the locations in Arizona and Las Vegas was way better. Just not a good experience ESPECIALLY being located in a nice area. Wtf guys? You were my fav restaurant... Geez
George F.,"Houston, TX",113,61,34,4.0,8/18/2013,"Pretty good food. Wonderful staff usually just a little overcrowded normally. One thing I love is they have great drink diversity. So it's always a good place to have small bites or a huge meal. Make sure to ask about seasonings on the pasta, they can be a little heavy on the seasoning."
O.J. J.,"Houston, TX",0,9,5,4.0,5/13/2015,"The cheesecake factory is a strong chain of restaurants and I was pleased to see they still have costumer service as a priority. I ordered a Caesar salad and wild mushroom soup that I was pleased with, and my friend got the fried shrimp platter and a spinach artichoke dip. All the dishes were good, but I must say the Caesar salad was the best. Our server was kind and helpful. The only reason I took one star off was because the hosts did not acknowledge us upon our arrival and continued their own conversation for a short amount of time."
Alexandra F.,"Houston, TX",10,2,2,1.0,7/5/2015,"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED IN ANY ESTABLISHMENT!!! I was there for the 4th of July to have an early dinner with my family. My mother had showed up 10 minutes early and got us a table. From the minute my mother sat down and the rest of us showed up it had been a total of 25 minutes if not a bit more WITHOUT anyone acknowledging our table! I decided to get up  and find the manager. I flagged him down and let him know how long it had been. He followed me over to the table and David (the manager) offered to take our drink order. My mother said it would be best to order everything now since we didn't want to wait any longer. David quickly said that he would JUST put in our drink orders and that the server should be over to take our food order. Wow really David?     Okay so after waiting five more increasingly annoying minutes, the server comes over to the table with like six bread baskets stacked up on top of each other and resting on his dirty work shirt. He picks out two baskets and drops them on the table. He happily apologizes for the wait and goes on to say, ""Sorry y'all there are other tables before y'all so I'm taking care of them first so y'all just have to wait."" AWESOME!! So of course he left again. David comes over and drops off our drinks and leaves. He didn't ask how anything was going or if we have been helped yet. Nothing. He just quickly left completely avoiding the situation. So the server comes back and FINALLY takes our order after being gone 5 more minutes since his last friendly visit. He takes the order and leaves. I am extremely enraged at this point in time. Food comes out in a ""timely"" manner. My cousin had ordered his burger well done and it came out damn near rare. Awesome.    I just want it to be known that I don't like the server we had. He is completely unprofessional and he kept talking to us like we were his buddies. His mannerisms are absolutely terrible, he kept playing with his nose while talking to us and he was arrogant. Any who the server comes over to check on us and he crouched down near my mother and asks her how's her food then proceeds to ask her if she's ""getting her money's worth""..... WOW!!! Who hired this clown?? Unbelievable. And yet again I see David pass up our table without a word. So weak. I ask for some boxes and the check. He comes back with the boxes and later he drops the check and of course we expect nothing would be comp'd off especially with the overwhelming warm experience we have had. Which nothing was. It's not about the money. We come here to spend money. It's about showing you care and you're sorry for the horrendous experience we've had and you hope we come back. Nothing, no attempt was made by anyone. My family and I left pissed off beyond repair."
Sidra K.,"Humble, TX",14,8,13,5.0,3/8/2015,It was our first time trying something other than the original cheesecake and I am in LOVE with this place again! That's right you can never go wrong at The Cheesecake Factory! If you're a chocoholic like me you can try the Oreo dream extreme or the Hershey's cheesecake - I don't know what heavenly ingredient they add to their cakes that makes it out-of-this-world yum! Keep it between your tongue an palate for a few seconds and it literally melts - cheesygasms I tell u haha! The place is super overcrowded but lovely ambience!  P.S somebody who was once cheesecake-allergic. Ty Cheesecake Factory!
Ma S.,"Houston, TX",202,171,336,1.0,8/5/2014,"Worst place ever!  Horrible seating unless you like being crammed up against the wall with fruit flies circling around you and your food. Wait staff neglected to bring sauce upon request, they said yes and never came back. And to top it off I ordered a burger on a wheat BUN and they brought out a burger patty on TOAST?!  Worst. Never going back.  It's as if they expect tourist all the time at this location so they neglect their regulars."
Nicole J.,"Humble, TX",163,146,59,5.0,12/9/2014,"I love this Cheesecake Factory! My husband and I both order off the skinny menu. We both started with the beet and goat cheese arugula salad that was perfectly dressed. Sometimes salads can be drenched in dressing, but this was not the case. I had the Asian chicken lettuce wraps. They were messy to eat due to the nature of a lettuce wrap, but the flavors were a great combo of sweet and salty. My children. Had spaghetti and meatballs and it was very savory, unlike most kids meals. For the finale, the tuxedo layered cake/cheesecake was worth that pound I gained eating it! It was sweet and rich and wonderful."
