Jimmy N.,"Beaumont, TX",0,1,,1.0,9/7/2017,We had to ask for bread and was told to wait for fresh bread when it came out the fresh bread was hard as a rock! The waiter was rude he didn't ask us if we were ready to order he just stood there waiting.
Steph D.,"Houston, TX",26,106,6,1.0,7/19/2016,"Did not want to come here but BF had a gift card. (sigh) Closest location was the Galleria so after plumbing the depths of the parking garage and navigating the non-functional mall escalators we made our way to the restaurant. We came here specifically for burgers cause it was Monday and I wanted to go to Pub Fountains for the three-dollar burger special but funny how things work out. So our waiter shows up for a few seconds, leaves. Shows up, leaves. Shows up, leaves. Keeps doing this, he's running off to wait on the 2 tables next to us. Finally comes to take our order, we start ordering just as the runners bring the food to the table next to us. We're mid sentence he's like ""just a second"" and leaves us for the other table. By this time we're like WTF? So finally he comes back says ""Do you want to order?"" I'm like (facepalm) Now I cannot eat rare hamburger because when I was growing up my mother nibbled at the raw hamburger while cooking and as a result, got a tapeworm which completely turned me off raw hamburger for the rest of my life. And something I've struggled with for decades is places that try to cook hamburgers like steak - they always always always fail to get the desired result because hamburger Is Not Steak. (unless it's a high-end restaurant and their hamburgers are inch-and-a-half thick ground sirloin). (and is anyone as old as me and remembers when Chili's only served hamburgers and would **only** cook them medium-rare?) So I say I want it cooked until no longer pink but... and he cuts me off and goes ""well done"". And I go (facepalm). We go round and round with me trying to cancel the burger 4 or 5 times and him ignoring my requests and finally going off to find the cook for me to talk to. It's not the cook that shows up but a manager who asked what the problem was. I tell her I want the burger cooked until no longer pink but still juicy and she goes ""well done"" and I go (facepalm). I ask her to cancel the hamburger which she actually does. BF's burger comes, he ordered it medium-rare, no bun, it comes medium with a bun, no condiments. I testily snap ""Do Not Send It Back."" He cuts it in half, shares it with me. Waiter shows back up, puts the check on our table we're like WTF? Picks the check up after BF snarls at him. I had gotten no sleep the night before so I was extremely fragile and snarky as well. Exceedingly snarky. Waiter comes back, clears the table. I would have gone (facepalm) but I had part of a hamburger in my hand and no dishes on the table. We speculate  the reason he's showing up more often at our table is probably cause the other 2 tables have left. The only good thing about this is we didn't pay for anything because of the gift card. Next time I'll tell BF ""fuck the gift card and take me to Pub Fountains"". Afterthought edit: They handled the stupid hamburger issue all wrong. Instead of arguing with me over it, the waiter should have just cancelled it first time I asked, brought me the menu and offered the suggestion ""see if there's anything else here you'd rather have.""  And I probably would have. Geez."
Melody M.,"Killeen, TX",103,195,1235,3.0,11/5/2014,"First time dining at this location and my first thought was -- why does it feel like an Amazonian rain forest in here?  It was so humid inside that I almost didn't order anything, but after driving 3 hours and skipping lunch, we were already famished.  I complained to our server about the questionable lack of A/C and he said that it always feels hot in the restaurant.  Meh. With that aside, our server was wonderful.  He was very attentive, but never intrusive.  I ordered a grilled salmon which was very good.  He didn't charge me for my extra side of asparagus -- which winded up being a good thing because they were semi-overdone anyway.  After about 15 minutes of dining, there was a server change of shift and I was afraid that the continuity of service would be lacking, but our next server was just as great. Our booth was located next to where all the other servers congregate and they were very unprofessional speaking loudly and cursing -- typical teenage behavior.  I was already feeling miserable sweating to death, so being forced to listen to them was just icing on the cake. Would I come back?  Yes, just because I love the food.  Maybe my next experience would be better.  There is a veranda adjacent to the restaurant so I'll just sit outside when it's hot next time.   - Disgusting, smelly women's bathroom.  My  particular stall had scattered toilet paper and small spots of blood on the floor... yuck.  My bf said it wasn't much better on the men's side either."
Lucinda V.,"Pasadena, TX",37,7,,2.0,1/16/2017,"After shopping in the galleria went to have a late lunch at this place and wanted to wash hands and potty before eating lunch. The restrooms were horrible! Trash over flowing, paper towels all over the floors because not one of the four stalls had toilet paper in them, needless to say I didn't get to ""go"" but I informed the hostess and got seated and told her I'll go when there's tp in the stalls. I went back after a Greek salad and crab bites that were less than appetizing, and all they did was take the trash out and put rolls of toilet paper in the stalls.  Floors were still nasty and sinks were just as bad. I would expect more from this place! HEB has cleaner rr's than this place!....and better food."
Jo G.,"Houston, TX",226,25,41,5.0,5/23/2016,"Just had the herb salmon customized. I took off the mashed potatoes and asparagus. I added green beans and broccoli. It was sooooo good.  Everyone I had dinner with had amazing entrees as well. I capped off my meal with a strawberry lemonade. I had so much food I have leftovers for lunch and possibly dinner. Our servers were so attentive, which was good for a big group."
Donna H.,"Midlothian, TX",0,8,,4.0,7/8/2017,"Have been to the Cheesecake Factory in the DFW area several times, and have always enjoyed it.  Saw this one in Houston, and after a day of having mediocre food, we thought we'd eat here because they are consistently good.  Both my dinner and my husband's dinner were delicious. The wait staff was friendly, and in spite of the massive amount of diners there this Saturday night, the food came out fast and perfectly prepared."
Jeffrey C.,"Vidor, TX",2,23,,5.0,8/24/2017,"I had a delicious meal there last night. It was right next-door to our hotel.  I got the pork chop meal, and it was delicious.  The staff was friendly and super efficient."
Nereida G.,"Richmond, TX",28,6,,3.0,1/18/2017,The first time I was here wait was a bit long but I brushed it off. The second and probably last time I was there was for my birthday dinner wait to get our order taken after we were seated was about 30 minutes and we had to keep asking our waiter for everything which was frustrating. After we placed our order it took another 30 minutes then the food was brought to us except mine I was told it was accidentally given to the wrong person. So I had to wait another 20 minutes for my food by the time it came out I wasn't hungry anymore since I had picked at my friends food. I got it boxed to go. The manager did stop by to apologize and gave me free dessert but I just feel that it all starts with the waiter if he would of been on top of his orders we could have avoided these problems. Live the location hate the wait.
Monique M.,"Missouri City, TX",417,24,23,1.0,3/17/2017,I will never go back. The busser threw the crumbs from off the table and seats into the floor. Absolutely horrible!
Diana D.,"Wichita, KS",0,1,,4.0,7/3/2017,All the workers were doing a fantastic job. My salmon and steak were over cooked so they threw them out but made another one asap which was good. Mothers steak was way overcooked and the managers offered to pay for her meal and was very professional and calm about it. Would totally recommend this place for dinner!
Christine R.,"Houston, TX",23,413,1391,4.0,8/21/2016,"I would probably come to this location more if it wasn't so busy. It is inside the Galleria located on the third floor so it's freaking busy always when I go there. In all fairness, it's always the weekend.  Their menu: Has anything from American to Italian or Chinese even. Their menu is full of different delicious foods from all these different and wonderful countries. You really can't go wrong in their wide selection of foods."
Amy T.,"Houston, TX",137,60,47,1.0,1/30/2017,"This is by far the worst location I have ever encountered. This was the last straw. All I wanted was to purchase their Santa Fe salad dressing. Before arriving I called at least three times to make sure it was okay to come in to purchase a bottle (dressing). The first call I was on hold for 10 minutes, the second call they told me to hold and then I was hung up on. The third and final call I asked why they did that and they couldn't give me an answer! Didn't even say sorry! I usually don't get upset over these type of things but this location took a nose dive and went down a lot."
Manuel E.,"Pearland, TX",397,118,93,4.0,8/3/2016,"I wish I could give The Cheesecake factory four and a half stars.  It deserves more than a four, but not necessarily a five.  The Cheesecake Factory is an excellent restaurant chain.  There is a very nice atmosphere, created by the dim lighting, which also causes a romantic feel.  There is very good service as well.  While you are waiting for your meal, they serve you fresh, warm bread.  My favorite is probably the Rye... that's the brown one right? lol.  Just a hint: if you are going to order a main entree, plan on getting about three meals out of it.  Personally, I go for an appetizer, which is one or two meals.  My favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese.  You are served four breaded and fried balls of macaroni and cheese on a chunky marinara.  When you plunge your fork into the ball, you will find lots of white cheddar cheese and macaroni. I have tried so many things on this menu and I have NEVER been disappointed. I'm usually not all that experimental but Cheesecake Factory has gotten me out of my old habits! If you're a Veggie... they make some of the best salads I have ever had.  If I want a salad for a meal (which is rare) the first place I think of is Cheesecake, hands down.  My personal favorite is the Luau Salad.  I am also rather fond of the Chicken Tostada Salad.   This place makes some damn good cheesecake with about 20 available selections.  I guess that's what they are named for.  A fail-proof order is the fresh strawberry - it's a classic.  Dulce de Leche, though I feared might be too sweet, but divine - rich without being overpowering.  However, I almost feel that they got a little zealous with their combinations.  Some of those cheesecakes really never had to be made.  German chocolate cheesecake?  Boston cream cheesecake?   At the end of your enjoyable meal... they bring you the bill....  Although it isn't too bad, it's still pricey.  Normally, the wait is about 45 minutes.  If you get there early or on a weekday, you may be seated immediately.  This place is a must-try."
Lindsey L.,"Dallas, TX",1,9,2,1.0,9/11/2016,"The worst customer service I've ever had. The manager was so disrespectful, and then was told that this is exactly what my nachos are supposed to look like yet online it says that it comes with multiple sides?? Do your freaking job."
Evelyn A.,"Houston, TX",0,3,1,1.0,12/25/2016,Biggest train wreck experience. Went here on a date and we ordered simple- a burger and a chicken sandwich w/ fries. When we initially sat down the place was packed. 30 minutes passed and we still had not gotten our order. We put in a complaint and 30-40 minutes later the food comes out when I notice my burger is well done instead of medium well so I have to return it. At this point everyone who sat after us were already gone. Waited another 25 minutes and the burger finally came out but at this point I did not want it anymore so I returned it. When a waitress brought the check she had not even voided the burger.  Thanks cheesecake factory.
Susan G.,"Fort Worth, TX",167,10,,1.0,3/19/2017,This location was unprofessional. We had called in to make reservations. Made a call to reserve tables for our group. The hostess attitude stunk on top of that we were told there would be a 3 1/2 hour wait. Bottom line went to another restaurant.
Isaiah M.,"Miami, FL",7,3,,3.0,4/9/2017,"Service was pretty average, nothing out of the ordinary except for the fact that we asked for a booth and was seated and a half booth half table and we asked to move as the waitress gave us a dirty look. Silverware was dirty and we had to ask for replacement silverware other wise the food tasted good but I wouldn't come back to this cheese cake ever it was one of my worst Cheesecake Factory experiences I've ever had..."
Blaine D.,"Cleveland, OH",0,28,2,1.0,6/9/2017,"Stopped by to eat at bar tonight.   Bartender was no where to be found, there was a drain backing up smell of sulfur and she served my wife's drink in a glass still dripping with bar-wash water.  We walked out before she embarrassed this brand any further."
Justin H.,"Pasadena, TX",6,4,4,1.0,6/11/2016,"Two of our dishes came out later than everyone else's. My orange chicken was so dry I had to ask for more sauce on the side and my food was cold by the time that came out. I had to remind the server twice about my whiskey sour. She needed another reminder to refill my water (she remembered everyone else's though -- bringing my water refills to a grand total of 1) and then forgot ice. Our appetizers were forgotten or never put in to the kitchen and finally arrived over halfway through the meal. Confusion when splitting up the checks, with the entire process taking a good 20 minutes. Easily my worst dining experience, though everyone else's food was tasty."
Jasmine B.,"Houston, TX",44,3,,5.0,2/8/2017,Forgot my leftovers in the restaurant - hurried back to get them and they ended up in the trash...the manager was so sweet to remake a portion of what I had with no charge. Love it!
