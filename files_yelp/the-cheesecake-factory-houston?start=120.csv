Sheri C.,"Humble, TX",23,3,3,5.0,12/10/2016,I had the BBQ chicken salad delivered to me via dinedash and my food was awesome as usual.  I am always very happy with what ever I receive from them and this was no exception.
Mai Shoua V.,"Saint Paul, MN",13,1,1,1.0,11/18/2016,"Ok.. I don't write reviews and I like going to The Cheesecake Factory but this one... oh my lord. My fiance and I came in and got seated right away, our waitress greeted us and took down our drink orders and went on her way. Sitting next to us were 2 women who seemed to be having a problem with what they had ordered and I'm guessing the manager or whatever was helping them out (the same lady who brought us to our seats, so maybe she was the host?) We got our drinks and my fiance had finished his and was given a refill by our waitress who just kind of plopped it on the table and left. 10 minutes go by and I'm sitting there hungry waiting for that magical complimentary bread and butter to show up and it doesn't, another 10 minutes go by and our waitress walks by us and doesn't even stop to let us know if our food is almost ready yet or not. So by this time the 2 ladies who were next to us had already left and a new group of people came in. (one of them didn't even finish their food because something was wrong so she ordered a dessert to go, it came on a plate and she had to tell them she was getting it to go... manager/host did a goof job there. *sarcastic* and yes I was eavesdropping cause there was no bread and butter to catch my attention) my fiance sees the lady who was dealing with the 2 ladies before and asks if we can get some bread and she says yes she'll get some. We see her walk to the place where they're cooking, thinking she or someone would bring us some but nope. So 20 minutes have gone by and no bread, another 5 minutes have gone by and we see the lady walking around and still no bread or news about our food. And my patience just drops waaaayy down and I see a guy at the desk area and I tell him that we've been sitting for over 20 minutes with no bread and we have no idea when our food will be out or where our waitress is and he says he'll get her right away. So I sit down, she's taking drink orders from the new group of people next to us and comes over and says ""what did you want?"" And i said ""oh, i just wanted some bread"" and she says she'll go get some. Like wtf....what about my food. So bread comes and a few minutes the food comes out too. I got the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo thingy and it comes with mash potatoes and it's $21.95 or something. PEOPLE IT IS NOT WORTH IT! i got 3 little pieces of meat mixed with shiitake mushrooms and onion, 3 shrimps (shouldn't the shrimp scampi have some sort of pasta at the very least?) And i got a whole not fully cooked potato in my mashed potatoes, my fork barely cut through. My food was cold but after all that waiting I was just happy there was some sort of food in front of me. I did ask our waitress to get me another side of mashed potatoes and I was like... if she charges me for this I will explode. But at least the burger my fiance got was good. I ordered a slice of chocolate cake to go cause i didn't want to be there any longer, and when i opened to eat it in the car it was this thin slice. In conclusion I'm never going here again. No wonder there was no line here, should've waited for Shake Shack."
Jessica C.,"Houston, TX",0,8,4,1.0,2/21/2017,"Despite a bad experience years ago and an unanswered letter to head office, I went to CF with a friend for lunch yesterday. I should have trusted my instincts. It was absolutely one of the worst food experiences again. I ordered a skinny vegetable salad with chicken. My friend ordered a Tuna Tatiki appetizer. Both look tired and of extremely poor quality. My salad was not per the menu. No roasted beet, but added celery and corn. The lettuce was dark and brown, the apple chunks were brown also. I asked the over-worked waiter and he told me on 3 occasions that the manager would be over. After 15 minutes had passed, I stood up to find the manager at the host table assigning tables. Is that his job? I tried to attract his attention, but after 5 minutes back in my seat, no sign of the manager. The waiter offered us to cover my meal and a free cheesecake slice (which I didn't want as I had just ordered a salad). We finally got up and left without paying. It turns out the Cheesecake Factory hasn't got much better in 5 years and I wont ever be going back."
Stephanie T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",20,11,2,2.0,2/21/2017,"I ordered Evelyn's pasta with no mushrooms, o to be served mushrooms as well as mom cooked pasta. Sent it back with the waiter & I swear they gave me back the same food but just took out the mushrooms. The pasta was still hard & half of the broccoli was burnt. I like the grand lux way better"
Amara H.,"Houston, TX",79,4,2,4.0,8/14/2016,Quick and friendly service. The waitstaff is excellent. I often come during my lunch break and they make sure to get me in and out on time. The portions are huge and the desserts are my favorite.
Jose' M.,"Lafayette, LA",43,6,1,4.0,9/3/2016,Got the spicy chicken chipotle pasta.  Service was excellent. Never ran dry with my tea.   Then to top it off had the lemon meringue cheesecake pie slice.  OMG !!!!!!!!!! Sooooooooo good.
Lorena T.,"Houston, TX",196,212,574,2.0,3/19/2016,"Ugh I want to like Cheesecake Factory but the service.  Yesterday I visited the one in the Galleria.  Once we got there we entered from the lower level and there was  sign asking for you to walk upstairs so we walked upstairs and had to wait 20 min to be seated.  When we finally got seated took 15 min for someone to come by and ask for our drink order.  She was a sweet girl but she was either overwhelmed or just slow.  Our drinks took another 10 min to get to the table.  I was there with a friend and three children so you know how annoying it is to be hungry And have hungry children with you asking you when the food is coming.  When she brought the drinks we ordered our appetizers and the kids drinks.  Their meals came out one at a Time And all the meals were served by different bussers every time so there was not lack of help but there was a 5-10 min gap between each dish.  Finally my food came but not my friends food.  I placed a to go order at that time.  Everyone was half way done and she still hadn't received her food.  Our waitress finally showed up.  We asked about the food and she said ""let me check the window "".  We finished our food And she still hadn't returned.  When we finally saw her return my friend told her please just cancel the order everyone is done eating.  She came back 5 min later with my to go order and my friends food and said ""the kitchen is backed up"".  Sad. She said her manager told her to ""still bring the plate of the food and see if it can entice her to take it home"" really?.  I would reserve going to Cheesecake Factory on pay week by myself and only order appetizers.  It's expensive and I hate spending hard earned money somewhere that the service just isn't up to par.  I enjoyed my meal but did not enjoy the interactions in between or the wait."
Joshua J.,"Houston, TX",198,125,141,4.0,11/15/2016,"Always like to go here. Staff is nice. I know they are busy so i will wait. Chessecakes in general are just great. Nothing to different here,"
Saba E.,"Houston, TX",590,578,143,3.0,5/8/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is just what you expect. Large portions, prompt service, and cheesecake so good that you feel guilty if you don't finish your slice...which is often tempting.  My husband and I returned to The Cheesecake Factory for our 9 year dating anniversary, 9, I know! Our waitress, Artesia, turned to my husband and said, ""have you proposed yet?"" And, we both laughed and let her know we've been married for a while now. Her sense of humor, hands-off approach, and cheery personality was just perfect for our mini-celebration.   Since our anniversary fell on a Monday, we were surprised to see how busy it was! On a Monday! But, we couldn't get a booth in which to sit since they had closed off some sections.   I ordered from their ""Skinnylicious"" menu and had their steak medallions with asparagus and potatoes. The steak wasn't the best, but I really wasn't here for the meat.  For dessert, we had the tuxedo cheesecake, and I felt the guilt kicking in when my stomach started to push back against the cake.  My husband jokingly reminded me that 9 years ago, we could each finish a slice. We are no longer that young and had to share a piece this time...and that was difficult.   All that said, this place is great for a choosy guest, hungry kids, and those who prefer chains."
Nisha M.,"Houston, TX",176,5,,4.0,8/15/2016,"We came here to celebrate one of our work colleagues birthday. We made a reservation for 10 people at 7pm, we showed up on time and still had to wait 20 min to be seated.  After we were seated we received very good service from our server and we were all happy with our food choices. Was a little dissapointed we had to waste almost 25 min."
Isabela F.,"East Dallas, Dallas, TX",52,10,19,1.0,7/23/2016,Terrible is the least I can say.  My husband went to get a to go order.  It took them an hour to give him cold fettuccine Alfredo and small baked potato soup.  When he got home they have forgotten to put in the bag the cheesecake he ordered and paid. I called to talk to them about their omission and they put me on hold for 15 minutes.
Brandi S.,"Humble, TX",38,14,5,5.0,1/1/2017,"Seated in less than 5 minutes at a crowded mall on New Years Day! Fast, hot food and great service!"
Tita P.,"Pearland, TX",0,21,,5.0,10/4/2016,This place is extremely  busy but i love the varietg of options  to eat here... their bread basket and dessert *cheesecakes* are my favorites
R L.,"Houston, TX",0,15,2,2.0,12/28/2016,"We've been to several Cheesecake Factories in different states over the years, and I think this one is below average.  Food - tasted as expected, but portions seemed smaller.  Service - the slow service is the main reason we will be unlikely to come back. The restaurant has two floors but only uses one even though there was a long wait even at 5pm. They told us it would take 5-10 min to be seated but was really about 20 min. Then we waited 30 min for our food and one of the orders came out wrong so we had to wait another 15 min to get the right dish (they told us it'd only take 2-3min to fire up the right pasta). They did recognize that we waited a looong time and gave us one dish and a dessert for free, so I do give them props for that. However, I'd rather get the right orders at a reasonable pace than a couple freebies.  Cleanliness - floor was noticeably dirty and greasy. The women's bathroom was messy and needed to be cleaned."
Brian H.,"Houston, TX",0,14,,1.0,7/16/2017,"I ordered delivery through DoorDash.  Two of my items were screwed up.  First, one of my pasta dishes was completely wrong.  Second, they put meat on a dish which I had specifically said no meat.  DoorDash gave me a $2.99 refund for the meat fiasco (what good that does me, I don't know), but the wrong item entirely is not right.  I know restaurants have kitchen staff whose primary job is to check every order before it goes out.  For delivery orders especially, this is extremely important since we don't have great options to rectify an incorrect order.  I would say whomever was working the delivery order on 7/15 around 6:00PM needs a stern discussion from management and probably a little more training on their own menu items.  You should know the difference between Pasta Carbonara (which is what I got) and Pasta Napoletana (which is what I ordered).  Thanks for ruining my meal, Cheescake Factory!"
Derek C.,"Houston, TX",84,53,31,5.0,11/12/2016,Perfect service for me and my wife. It was the best Valentine's Day ever. Thank you CCF.
Lance H.,"Clinton, MI",0,55,,3.0,9/8/2016,"Went to this location today, and while the food was good our table was dirty when we sat down.  It was not busy, and there were greasy marks, and many ""sticky"" spots on the table and our bread plates.  I put my arms on the table and part of my skin stuck to the table when I picked it up.  I also noticed what looked like finger marks and butter smudges on my bread plate. Can't complain about the food, especially the cheesecake.  And the variety is really hard to beat.  The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is just awesome.  Would have been so much of a better experience without the dirty table.  I didn't ask to be moved because that's such an annoyance for everyone once we've already been seated with silverware, drinks, bread, etc."
Liz M.,"Key Largo, FL",0,8,,1.0,6/5/2017,"Our waiter was good but other servers were very unprofessional holding mutiple things in their hands without trays. I ordered eggplant parm and it was cold and barely cooked. Manager came to send it back. When it came out again, it was still just as bad. This is the worst Cheesecake location I've ever been to."
Diana C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,13,15,5.0,6/3/2016,Meal was great! Service was good.. Didn't even have room for dessert.. But the price of desert doesn't make me want to take it home either
Jess H.,"Houston, TX",94,38,10,3.0,4/10/2017,"I came in to this restaurant right after Sunday brunch with some friends. The hostess definitely misquoted our wait time but was very nice about it so we did not mind the longer wait. After we were seated our server had a nice personality but did forget my coffee order until I reminded him about it several visits to the table later. The banana milkshake I asked took a super long time too. For my entree I selected the Mediterranean falafel salad with chicken and was very disappointed but could not send it back for another dish because at this point we were late to our next activity. It was SUPER heavy on kale and very light on dressing, which really did not help with the dryness of the overcooked chicken. However I feel like the most upsetting element of the experience was the hushpuppyesque attempt at falafel that I was served. Please, pleaseee take another look at the recipe your company has been using and revamp that dish ASAP! If this review was just on my entree it would receive 0 stars!"
