Brandon W.,"Phoenix, AZ",127,12,6,4.0,2/3/2015,"Let me start by saying Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants.  I've eaten here soooo many times, and I've never gotten tired of it.  The building itself is inside the mall, so you can park at any of the garages and walk to it.  It has an entrance on the 2nd floor, and another entrance on the 1st floor (which is where the bar is).  Since it IS in the galleria, good luck finding parking on the weekends. This place gets pretty packed around lunch and dinner time so you will have to wait, especially if you have large parties.  The waiting area can get pretty crowded too, so go at off hours if you want to avoid the chaos. If you're new to this place, you'll be surprised at the sheer number of items on the menu.  On top of that, they will give you complementary bread & butter.  As far as  the appetizers here, its all pretty good.  Except for a few things, such as the ""vietnamese shrimp summer rolls.""  That stuff's pretty cold and bland. Don't know what to choose for lunch or dinner?  The pasta & burger/sandwiches are always a good choice, not to mention the size of the portions (they are VERY big).  If you come during lunch time, you can get a ""lunch special"" of certain items, such as the pasta.  It's a smaller size portion, but to be honest it's still quite a lot of food.  Overall, most of the things on the menu here are good.   As far as the cheesecake goes, the Cheesecake Factory has THE BEST cheesecake.  Again, you can't go wrong with any of this stuff.  It's all good.  BUT, be warned, one slice has like 750-1000 calories. Wait, but Brandon, what do you recommend? Well check it out homie: 1. Appetizers: Crabcakes, Factory Nachos, Crab & Artichoke Dip, Crispy Crab Bites 2. Salads:  I don't eat salads here 3. Real Food: Kobe Burger (personal favorite, get it with sweet potato fries and ask for chipotle mayo), Southwest Chicken Sandwich, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Shepherd's Pie, Famous Factory Meatloaf 4. Cheesecake: Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake (a classic), White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake Oh, and don't get the vietnamese shrimp summer rolls.  Or the fish tacos.  Just sayin"
Matt W.,"Pasadena, TX",0,8,,1.0,1/11/2016,"This place has really gone downhill. I guess it's the lack of competition for ""fine dining"" inside the Galleria that has allowed the quality to slip as much as it has. We were seated promptly, and our waitress could not have been nicer, but that it about the end of the positives. Our tamale corn cakes were burnt, our rice was almost completely raw, our fish tacos were lacking sauce and shredded cabbage, and the black beans tasted overly sweet. Won't be going back for a while."
Vanessa B.,"Houston, TX",73,238,89,5.0,1/16/2015,"I have eaten here a few times, but mostly we get it to go. They give you an estimated time it will be ready, and it's always been ready when I've arrived. The waiting area for dining can be crowded, but the to go counter never has more than one or two people in it, and mostly there's never a line. They pull everything out of the to go bags and go over your order with you to ensure you get what you wanted. They will throw in some of their fresh baked bread and butter at no charge. I recommend the wheat bread, I normally don't prefer wheat bread but theirs is a little sweet, and it's always warm.  The regular portions are huge, and the lunch portions are also huge, but smaller than the normal portion.  The Chinese chicken salad is good, as is the Santa Fe chicken salad. The Santa Fe's dressing is simply amazing, it is described as Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette, but it is not spicy at all. I always ask for extra dressing. They are stingy on the tortilla strips but you can ask for extras also. The chicken is thinly sliced and everything blends together nicely.  I've also had their lunch pizza & salad, the pizza has a fairly thin crust, and the cheese always tastes great. The lunch shepherd's pie is also very good, and a very nice sized portion.  My only complaint is the traffic around the galleria and the parking. I normally park on the roof deck and pay the minimum charge, even though I'm in and out in less than 15 minutes (this used to be free, but of course now they make you pay!) There is a valet (I think free?), but I've valeted before and told the guy I had to go to one store close by and would be back in less than 20 minutes, but they still went and parked my car & then I had to wait for them to bring it back."
Kierstyn P.,"Lake Jackson, TX",0,2,,2.0,3/3/2017,"Food came out promptly... tasted nicely... however, our waiter Jasmine was very forgetful and seemed to be new. We had asked for sweetener, red pepper, and cheesecake to-go... she forgot all of these requests and we ended up having to chase her down too many times than appropriate. She also failed to know much about the menu. She seems to need more training... get this girl help."
Monisha D.,"Sugar Land, TX",313,90,155,2.0,3/13/2016,"The cheesecake is the only reason I come here because the food is really just over priced frozen dinners and the drinks are over priced sugar-waters. I usually just order to-go (since I'm only here for the cheesecakes) but what I really hate is that when i called ahead for to go pick up orders, I still have to stand in line behind 12 people that are indecisive AF and then when i get to the register to pick up my order, it's not even prepared and ready to go. (This just happened so my review went from 3 stars to 2). Management could really ""lean"" the process so they wouldn't get such crappy yelp reviews all the time due to their outstanding customer service (that's right, I see your 3 stars)."
Katy P.,"Houston, TX",0,7,17,1.0,2/15/2016,"Today i was there with my friends for valantins day .food was delicious, lemonade was pretty good.  The service was horrible, starting seating ,to  having my cheesecake to go ..I got it up side down ..and sqweezed in a  broken box..I can tell the girll who prepared it to go was angry because the waiter khorkhe  he didn't tell her earlier yo make it to go..so she released her anger in my cake We asked the waiter jorje to get us more bread ..But he never came back with some ... .so sad to waste valantins time  with such a bad service"
Yanghong G.,"Houston, TX",42,4,10,4.0,5/1/2016,"I ordered three diff pieces of cheesecakes. Red velvet, tiramisu, and white chocolate raspberry truffle. All good, but a little too sweet for my plain tongue. The size is very big, I can feed myself with one velvet cake"
Jake H.,"Dickinson, TX",87,3,,1.0,12/22/2015,"You walk and it's busy, but what's new? After getting the table and ordering our appetizer, 20 minutes later the server comes back to tell us the item is out of stock. I understand it's busy, but 20 minutes after we had told you the order is a bit ridiculous. Then, we ordered our food and after five minutes he returns to tell us the marinara sauce is out too and so I ordered and different pasta dish. The other dish I ordered was the chicken Alfredo and the sauce was watered down to where it tasted like thick cheesy water. After receiving my food, I looked to the table next to us to see them being served spaghetti and meatballs. Also, I ordered a small salad before my meal and it had no dressing on it. My friend ordered a salad as a meal, no croutons. After asking twice, our server brought it out. She also ordered a small side of French fries and after asking three times to the server and food deliverer we had to cancel the order because they did not bring it out. I can understand with it being busy, but this service is uncalled for and unprofessional. Very disappointed in the service and the food. Saddening."
Mae L.,"Houston, TX",363,69,28,2.0,2/10/2016,Im not understanding the hype about this place. Yes the atmosphere is great and the staff i have NO complaints about but i have tried this place more than once and the food it so BLAND! Im convinced they use Ms. Dash seasoning because i taste not one lick of salt! However it is the Cheesecake Factory so they do have AMAZING CHEESECAKE! That is what keeps me a customer! Oh and i make sure i do not miss National Cheesecake Day :)
Omar A.,"Houston, TX",9,35,14,3.0,3/2/2016,"Food is good but the waiting time is usually 30-45 mins, especially during weekends.  Traffic is always bad in the galleria area so avoid weekends."
Helen Grace M.,"Beaumont, TX",38,7,4,4.0,10/30/2016,"Second time eating there with my son in 2 months. The first time, we weren't given complimentary bread because I didn't know they're giving them  until our second visit but the food was delicious. The second time we ate there, the Chicken carbonara was very good, the Chicken breast with lemon couscous wasn't. The chicken was very tough and hard and the ""sauce"" was very salty. The place has a very nice ambience, the staff are very nice, friendly, attentive and very accommodating. Although the place wasn't pack, they gave us a small table but upon asking for a bigger one, they gave us a bigger one."
Tam J.,"Austin, TX",8,79,42,1.0,11/9/2015,So gross- why do people come here? I literally just got the regular old fashioned burger-  medium well. I swear this was the the most burnt burger I've ever had in my life. I would have sent it back but it was to-go and I was to tired to walk over. How do you burn meat? I don't get it.
T P.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,1.0,3/10/2016,"Received a gift card for Christmas.So we decided to finally dine -in on a Wednesday night. This was my first time here.The service was very poor.I ordered a Margarita, it was very watery.The food took forever!!! The service was poor and they didn't apologize. Food was not tasty. I will not be returning."
Grant M.,"Houston, TX",0,24,5,1.0,6/19/2016,"Hostess usually have a bad attitude, the food comes out fast sometimes, but sometimes you wait for 30-40 mins.  They don't put much meat in there dishes.  Only thing good about this place is the desserts.  Everything else just sucks.  I've given up eating finally.  I'm done.  I DO NOT recommend this place to my family and friends."
Melanie H.,"Houston, TX",243,452,600,5.0,9/5/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! And this one is my favorite location.  Growing up, this was the only Cheesecake Factory in Houston (at least that I was aware of) and going here was a big deal. First of all, it's in the Galleria and that's exciting. But then it's kind of fancy and it has SO MANY kinds of Cheesecake! We went for birthdays and special occasions and it used to make me so excited. It still kind of does.  My most recent trip to The Cheesecake Factory was on a date (a third date) and that definitely affected my experience. So, keep that in mind if you keep reading.  It was MAGICAL! Just kidding, but I legitimately do like Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, definitely not healthy, and comes in gargantuan proportions. Think like 3 meals per dish. My date and I both ordered pasta dishes and when they brought them to our table they looked more like serving bowls for an entire table. Sheesh. But I suppose that makes it more worth the money. I ate pasta for lunch for the next 2 days.  Then we shared 2 pieces of cheesecake - a peanut butter chocolate variety and a mango key lime. Both were amazingly delicious. And we had leftovers of that too! I really like the brown bread they serve as well. Slightly sweet and so yummy.  The service is always great at The Cheesecake Factory. And the ambiance is fast-paced in an exciting way. It's probably all in my head, but I just feel like I'm doing something special when I eat at this Cheesecake Factory.  So, yeah, it's unhealthy, it's a chain, it's not local or organic or trendy, and it can now be found in abundance in the suburbs. BUT CHEESECAKE!"
Victoria G.,"Houston, TX",184,23,160,1.0,10/3/2015,"Flatware/silverware at table were completely not cleaned upon arrival. Not just small sticky food that didn't come off in the washer, but chunks of food that looks like they scooped up some time of crusty pie. See pictures I'm placing on this review.  Also service was extremely slow and disorganized. Just to get the check at the end of the dinner took about 25 mins"
Nadia K.,"Houston, TX",100,37,52,1.0,2/2/2016,Horrible service!!!!!!  Food is good but service is just horrible! They take forever to bring out the food and apparently the bread is always in the oven. The lady at the dessert center is rude as hell. Don't come to this location!!! Management is also terrible and don't know how to apologize. No customer service skills or manners at all.
Tulsi P.,"Tomball, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,huge fan of the cheesecake factory. but will never return to this particular location. food was cold. beer was flat. service was horrible. waitress was rude. and the manager did not seem to care when we complained.
Kathy M.,"Houston, TX",65,203,252,4.0,11/15/2013,"The food here is pretty good. I have been here more than 3 times, none had disappointed me. I highly recommend the ahi tuna tartar, very delicious and refreshing. For dessert, kahlua cheesecake is the beasttt.  Everything is good, except for the service, the servers were attentive."
TexanGal 4.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,20,32,2.0,9/25/2016,Went to eat at this location for my son's birthday. The service was great however the food was just ok. I had chicken madiera which taste like it had been cooked on a burnt grill. My husband's salmon was over cooked and dry. The portion sizes are huge but who really wants a huge portion of food that taste bad? Probably will not be returning. For $75'I'll go elsewhere...
