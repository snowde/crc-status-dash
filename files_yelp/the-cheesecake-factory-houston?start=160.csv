Glennisha F.,"Houston, TX",96,19,4,5.0,2/14/2016,"Food is so amazing here, went for Valentine's Day. Tons of food choices, amazing service from server and hostess. Great experience."
Sandy C.,"Houston, TX",23,29,10,1.0,7/20/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory in the Galleria, first the floors were greasy. I had some rubber in the bottom of my shoes, yet it was still slippery and slimy. It just did not feel like the same Cheesecake factory from 3 years ago. Then, I asked for a booth and they took me to a table, I said, as I passed by an empty booth can I sit here? He went back to ask the hostess, and she said sit them at the back booth, they will get their food faster. So, we sat at the booth in the back. Then our waiter was so unsettled, hyper, and looked like he was overstressed. He did not take the time to listen. I think he must have had like 12 tables at a time, not kidding. It took him forever to comeback and brought us water and would leave for 20 minutes or more. Finally, he took our order, but was super hyper. He left, and it took him 15 minutes to come back and tell us, they did not have what we wanted. Cool, we decided to order something different. While we kept waiting, we could see the kitchen and all the action. The lady at the food line in a red shirt and black pants was distributing the orders. She grabbed the plates with her hands, no gloves. And, would swipe a fry and put in her mouth and eat it. That was disgusting!! She did this more than once. The floors were so grease and dirty. No body were gloves in the kitchen. Then, finally our appetizer was out, and our food  5 minutes later almost all at the same time. And while we started to eat. Guess who was our guests at our table. A cockroach!!!!! Not the big size ones like the ones you see everywhere in Texas. No, the kind use see in dirty apartments, nomes, or food establishments.  We dropped our food and could not eat. We called the waiter and told him! Then, he leaned over my daughter, grabbed the roach with a napkin, and some of it dropped in my daughters food. And, we told him we can't eat, this is grease!! We need to speak to the Manager!! So, he said, OH MAN!!! Had a very bad attitude! Very unprofessional! He said, I am bringing your bill out! The nerve of him!! Then, the manager never came, but the bill did. I had to ask a bus boy from the back, since we were literally right next to the kitchen, to please get me the Manager. That took 3 minutes. Because the waiter we had did not want to bring him out. The Manager used all the excuses in the book. Well, this is the way it is everywhere in Houston, plus we can't help it if the other places around us, does not take care of it, sorry about that. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE!!!! GROASE!!!! GROASE!!!! VERY GROASE!!!!    STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE RUDE!!! HAVE NO MANNERS!!! AND ARE REALLY DIRTY!!!! I will not be surprised if someone has not fallen from those dirty greasy floors, and I know the difference between shiny and greasy!!! I will not be surprised either if someone has had food poisoning there!!! Because just from the few bites that we had there my daughter and I had the runs 4 hours later!!!"
Hannah W.,"Austin, TX",101,4,4,2.0,6/13/2016,"I come here every so often-service is typically fast and on point. However, today's meal was a little off. I ordered the veggie melt , which claimed to come with artichoke, kale, tomato, roasted red pepper and herbed goat cheese. I received a provolone, mushroom, and zucchini sandwhich. I was confused and disgusted to say the least... our waiter quickly fixed it for us without charge though which I greatly appreciated. Next time you order this, make sure they include all the listed ingredients. I have seen other reviews complaining about the same exact problem regarding this dish, so eat at your own risk."
Valerie G.,"Austin, TX",75,14,4,2.0,7/13/2016,We had heard that the Cheesecake Factory was a great restaurant. It was pretty bad. My daughter ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta. There was so much tomato on it you couldn't find the pasta. The shrimp served with it was lukewarm and way over cooked. It was rubbery and had not been shelled nor deveined correctly. I had the Avacado egg rolls and they were also served at room temperature. Everything needed salt and lacked flavor. My daughter ordered a Carmel macchiato and even that was served just warm. The macchiato and the bread placed on the table were the best part of the entire meal. What a disappointment.
Joe C.,"Rowlett, TX",4,166,97,1.0,8/10/2015,"I guess things work differently in Houston. Same menu as Dallas. Here are the short list of issues. I ordered the Filet for my son, he likes it Med. I got Rare. We also had to ask for a knife twice for the steak.  I ordered a espresso with the drinks order to be brought out right away. It arrived with the check. So bad service and food!! Not a good combination."
Ellysse L.,"Hempstead, TX",0,19,11,2.0,2/28/2016,"The staff is very nice. I ALWAYS get the Miso Salmon and tonight I was very displeased. The first time they brought it out the rice was very hard and dry. After they fixed that, there was another problem with my meal. The was still skin on the bottom of my salmon which made the rice, sauce, and fish taste horrible. It left a bad aftertaste in my mouth and ruined my appetite. I settled with the Lousiana chicken pasta to go but I was so upset because I was looking forward to that dish. My boyfriend refused to eat in front me so his food ended getting cold. Overall we had an unsatisfactory experience at the Galleria location.  We usually go to the Memorial location and everything is usually perfect so you can imagine how upset I was during this  visit. Our server was sweet as pie and the manager did take the time to give her apologies for the food. Though it will be a while until I come back to this location."
Daniel H.,"Houston, TX",29,53,24,1.0,1/3/2016,"Table for 12 please. ( Sunday 4:30 PM Jan 3rd.)  Manager : wait is 3 Hours.  Really? Seriously? Really? Is this a joke?  BTW, downstairs area was closed."
Nick L.,"Cypress, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/4/2016,"I always love coming to eat here but lately the service has been dropping horribly, we were a party of 10 we waited an hour an a half for a table and as soon as our buzzer went off another hostess had given our table away and we had to wait another hour. Not only was one set of silverware dirty all of them had dried crusted food on them, asked for new sets and they never brought them. On top of that our waiter has an attitude and keeps rolling his eyes. Received our first batch of ""fresh bread"" when our meal came. I highly recommend going to the memorial location for a better experience!"
Hanni G.,"San Jose, CA",65,22,5,4.0,2/21/2016,"They have THE BEST blue cheese olive martinis in town.  I'm not really crazy about their food but when it comes to dirty martini, they are outstanding! You must try it next time you go."
Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,5.0,8/1/2012,"the brown bread (and no I don't know what it's called) in the complimentary bread basket is the #2 reason I love this place. I can't think of any place where I like the bread more, nah not even the cheddar bay biscuits for the seafood lover in you place, that I jokingly refer to as Red Dumpster, since the food either looks like it belongs in the trash or just came out of it, in comparison to the pictures on the menu.  Moving right along, TCF's menu is too damn big, no way in hell you can't find anything appealing. My personal fav is the lemon herb roasted chicken. Juicy with a hint of tart from the lemon, it's divine and comes with carrots and mashed potatoes. Try the corn fritters for an app, delicious. Cobb salad, worth the price tag. NOT a fan of the cajun jambalaya pasta AT ALL, pass it up, save your cheddar, TRUST ME! I have friends in high places and know these things...believe me when I'm trying to hip you to the game!  Hold up partner, don't eat all that food they give you, one must save room for dessert when you come here. Strawberry cheesecake, yum...loves it...BUT my #1, I can't stay away, I dream about this cheesecake y'all, kahlua cocoa coffee. I'd like to imagine God himself created this cheesecake and broke off a slice from heaven just to share with his #1 angel (that would be me FYI)...it's so decadent and rich, made with layers of brownie, kahlua cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate ganache. Look me in the eyeballs and tell me that ish doesn't sound good! Yeah you can't do it, can ya...don't bother, just run and try it for yourself. The carrot cake is pretty decent, but that ain't my speed. It's big as hell but I don't come to TCF for that kinda cake!!! Waste of stomach room..."
Nick K.,"Houston, TX",176,170,1159,4.0,5/18/2016,"i usually go to Cheesecake Factory, for their great Cheesecakes, parking kinda tight you need to pay for Valet or park in the galleria, but keep in mind galleria closes an hour before Cheesecake Factory. service always great, great manager as well he had change my order because it had different taste from last time I had it."
Rainbow R.,"Humble, TX",0,74,370,3.0,1/18/2015,Yikes. Get a reservation. We arrived around 1 on a Saturday. We needed a table for 5. It was so crowded there was no where for us to stand. We moved to the bar area and in doing so we didn't hear them call our name. They no longer have buzzers so listen carefully. We weren't seated until 2:10.  Menu is wonderful. They have anything you could want. And a nice skinny menu. Food portions are huge. You get complimentary bread and butter which was nice.  Had it not been so crowded we would have had a better experience.
Donna R.,"Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, CA",85,171,98,1.0,8/1/2015,Salmon over cooked. Service was good.  The most horrifying thing was opening a menu a seeing an advertisement for Dr. Guy Lewis!!! He's been sued and fined by the Texas medical board for substandard care MULTIPLE Times!!!!We were horrified to see that Cheesecake Factory would put its patrons in harms way. By running his ads in there menu.
David B.,"Buda, TX",2,72,33,3.0,7/28/2015,"Went here for lunch and we had a waitress that just finished her training 4 days ago. She did a great job with us. There was a learning curve and we were up for it. The food was hot and good. My wife had a GF cheeseburger and it didn't make her sick. Kudos to the kitchen. The rating I am giving is based on the cleanliness of the restaurant. Very dirty floors, table tops, restrooms....  Not acceptable..  The people setting the tables do a half ass job at it. Dinnerware just thrown together on the table.  These are things that can be fixed.  Corporate needs to look at the management at this location. Usually I see a manger walking around talking with customers,  but not here. This location would not be my first choice eat."
Anna V.,"Houston, TX",34,98,69,4.0,8/29/2014,"This is the Cheesecake Factory connected to the Galleria Mall so it's super busy.  It is a 2-story restaurant so when we entered into the restaurant from the first floor with a stroller, we had to find the elevator.  They do have an elevator in the restaurant but it's so tiny.  We were lucky enough to get a booth seat away from the hustle and bustle so we were able to park the stroller at the end of our table.  They have an area at the hostess where all the mothers parked their strollers LOL The cheesecake is wonderful. So so so many to choose from.  It's always hard.....I always go for Tiramisu cheesecake and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake....they are both to die for.  This time though we decided to try the lemon raspberry one.  It was also very good.   Their portions are huge so sharing a portion is always a good idea."
Spencer R.,"Orlando, FL",102,8,14,2.0,5/23/2016,Food was good. But timing was too long for what we ordered. We were also cramped between two tables with little elbow room because they didn't want to serve other seating areas. We were told booths would take longer when there were at least 6 surrounding booth areas free. Hostess did not show for 5 minutes when we went to check in. No one was rude but we expected more for the price.
Bailey R.,"Houston, TX",156,32,17,4.0,9/3/2015,"The menu selection is HUGE. So many options to choose from! The portions are very generous so the pricing is acceptable in my opinion. The service was a little bit slow on the Tuesday evening that we went, although the restaurant was packed for it being so early in the week. Excellent cocktail selection at decent prices, although the cocktail menu does not show the prices listed. You basically just find out how much you spent on your alcohol at the end... Overall, a great experience!"
Carlos G.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",9,7,4,5.0,6/17/2016,Excellent service and very friendly. If you come here ask for Anjienette. She will treat very well!!
Claire C.,"Sugar Land, TX",128,36,52,5.0,6/16/2014,"First, this place looks nice. Upscale decor. Second, great service. Looks like their waiters here are well trained. They smile, greet customers, polite, and knows the food they are serving. Third, the food are delicious and ample serving size. The downsize, expect to pay $15-$20 per person."
Kate J.,"Beaumont, TX",0,8,,2.0,12/29/2015,"This particular restaurant has been an old favorite of mine whenever I am in town. However, my experience today was the absolute worst to date. We had a party of 8 people- four kids, and four adults. Most of our group was eating here for the very first time; therefore, looking forward to the whole experience. At first things were fine. The waiter seemed attentive and our appetizers were delivered promptly. This is where everything went to sh*t. The kids' meals came out one at a time, and staggered. My daughter's cheese quesadilla was not delivered with the others though, and if you have a group of kiddos, this was upsetting and frustrating for her and me as a parent. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. No quesadilla yet! No nothing.  I caught a manager's attention and asked what was up with the food, also noticing that our waiter had basically disappeared. While the mngr was standing at the table, the waiter appeared with 2/4 of the adult entrees. The waiter immediately had attitude, and I could see it on his face. He basically threw the plates down and huffed off. Still no quesadilla either. Then we waited some more for the rest of our food. By this point we are all irritated and not enjoying this experience at all. (By the way, if you order the ""Tortilla Soup"" expect to get slop). The last thing that happened involved the huffy waiter when I asked- yet again- where my daughter's quesadilla was. He said, ""don't you get attitude with me, lady! It is not my fault!""  I was so embarrassed and mortified that I lost my appetite completely! When he finally brought it out, it was dripping with grease and looked a mess! All in all, a really depressing experience. I can say for sure that the staff had issues and a rotten disposition today. Even though our check was compensated, we still tipped generously. Will not return to this location."
