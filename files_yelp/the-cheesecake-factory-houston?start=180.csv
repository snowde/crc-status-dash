Sakshi B.,"Houston, TX",0,8,5,3.0,11/10/2014,The food was good and the waitress was really sweet but it took us a long time to get our order. By the time she got our order we had lost our appetites and had to take most of it to-go! Amazing red velvet cheesecake though!
Kristine V.,"Houston, TX",5,11,1,5.0,7/3/2016,"Wonderful menu, with amazing desserts! Had to bring home the turtle cheesecake and the lemon cheesecake. We thoroughly enjoyed them both! I can't remember exactly what we ordered as our main dishes, but I know it was good. Definitely will visit again!"
Nichole S.,"El Paso, TX",1,18,,4.0,7/3/2016,"Great food, delicious scrumptious cheesecake! Tried the Godiva Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter  and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecakes. All were amazing and were  big enough to share. Our waitress was the best. Don't expect to sit down while u wait for your table it's a Very busy restaurant hence the 4 stars. They need to add a better waiting area. Best Part was our wait time was only 17 minutes for Saturday night dinner."
Jennifer W.,"Redford, MI",42,518,853,4.0,3/31/2016,"I fell in love with the Cheesecake Factory after having it for the first time at this Houston location.  Afterwards, I would hunt one down in whichever city I visited.  At one point, I think I was even scheduling vacations in cities where one was located.  I've had many dishes.  My favorites are the chicken madeira, pasta carbonara, fried macaroni and cheese, avocado egg rolls, Tex-mex egg rolls, and hot spinach and cheese dip.   I've had the chicken and biscuits, but it was not flavorful enough.  The orange chicken was also just an ok dish.  My favorite dessert here is the huge slice of Carrot Cake.  Sometimes I stop by to get it to go.  My favorite Cheesecakes:  Snickers Bar Chunks, Vanilla Bean with caramel sauce, White Chocolate Macadamia, and Salted Caramel.  The menu is very extensive.  It's overwhelmingly extensive.  It takes me longer than most people to decide on what I'm having when I'm dining out.  When I'm going to the Cheesecake Factory, I have to view the menu ahead of time. Seriously, it's as if you're reading a novel."
Tamara B.,"Texas City, TX",24,13,3,1.0,12/23/2016,"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!! A friend and I went here last night to eat and have drinks, boy we were in for much more! I ordered a chicken ceaser salad (easy enough right???) and my friend order the Chicken costeletta. Once our food reached the table, I could tell right away that my chicken on my salad was waaayyyyyyyyy over cooked. (To the point when I could not cut it with a knife.) Instead of sending it back I ate around it because my friend seemed to be enjoying her food, and I didn't want to damper the mood. Several moments had passed when my friend stopped in the middle of our conversation and dropped her fork on her late with a look of disgust. I asked ""what's wrong??"" And she pointed down to her dish where a long strand of hair was sticking out. Now, this was not a piece of hair that just had fallen on top of her dish, it was actually cooked within the chicken! It was embedded in the crust!!!! Soooooo disgusting right? Well after our waiter called a manager, he literally came to us, maybe 10 minutes later.... and stated ""I'm sorry do you want a another one or do you want it off the bill"" he was not empathetic at all! I then asked for another manager and received the same treatment. The second manager offered to take everything off the bill (excluding the drinks) which we accepted. When our bill came, we were charged for everything else anyway! I just paid for it and tipped the waiter because I didn't want to have to wait another 10 minutes to speak with another manager. To say at the very least, it seems this company supports managers that are un-empathetic, unprofessional, and have no customer service skills  AT ALL! Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else!"
Benjamin D.,"Seabrook, TX",205,120,28,4.0,3/29/2016,"Before coming here, I had only ever been to one other Cheesecake Factory location, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the decoration and ambience of this place, which is located in Houston's Galleria Mall. Additionally, the egg roll sampler I ordered was so good, I had to get a second one! The sampler came with two texmex rolls, avocado rolls, cuban rolls, and one other set of rolls, the type of which I can't recall. All of them came with their own dipping sauces, and all of them were delicious."
Angel G.,"Baytown, TX",85,11,2,3.0,5/9/2016,Customer service was exceptional and very attentive. Pizza and fried macaroni is a must if you want something vegeterian. Obvs the cheesecake is tasty however I was really disappointed by the veggie burger as it was really bland
Ridge D.,"Houston, TX",1,5,,1.0,5/24/2016,The worst service you could possibly ask for in a restaurant. The servers don't come take your drink order for 30 mins then never return after they take your order.  The management didn't seem to care that their service was lacking. Never again!
Fernanda D.,"Pearland, TX",28,11,5,5.0,2/24/2016,"This was probably the best meal of my life. We ordered a mix of seafood pasta, with shrimp, calamari and a perfect cooked white fish. Needless to say, their cheesecake is the best of all times. New York style we went, just the plain simple and original cheesecake. Make sure to arrive early so you don't have to wait long for a table."
Jerry A.,"Houston, TX",999,265,318,4.0,5/8/2015,Great ambience. I've tried several entree's from pastas to sandwiches. All were great. The desserts are worth every penny. Ambiance is nice and the location is conveniently situated inside the Galleria Mall.
Jose R.,"Houston, TX",51,6,,3.0,10/25/2016,"it was a good time with my wife, service was good. food was alright good portion but it was bland. had the egroll sampler but what i wish they did is that they name the eggrolls and also let us know which sauce foes with what. chicken marsala was a huge portion couldnt eat it all but it was also bland. wifes food was alright. good time but below average food."
Anna C.,"Houston, TX",61,41,42,4.0,4/1/2016,"I ordered the Tuna TarTar and there was barely any fish and only avocado. They should call it Avacado TarTar, but the bow tie pasta with peas was very good!!"
Kody S.,"Houston, TX",1,14,1,2.0,1/11/2016,The food is usually good and at a fair price but calling to place a order is ridiculous. I had to call 3 times and was left on hold for over 15 minutes and by that point I decided to place a order for my lunch else where. You would think they would make it an easy process like every other restaurant in this mall and allow for orders online.
Megan B.,"Houston, TX",46,1,,1.0,5/21/2016,Absolutely terrible service. Waited 20 minutes before anyone said anything to us after being seated. Finally when we got up to walk out a hostess  took our order. Saw the waitress maybe once after we told her someone had already taken our order. First and last time at a Cheesecake Factory. It's just a shame I can't go lower than one star.
Katy K.,"Houston, TX",5,10,2,1.0,8/10/2015,"Absolutely disgusting!  The table was filthy. When I asked the hostess if someone could clean the table she sighed, rolled her eyes, and said ""in a minute"". She clearly was not interested in helping us so we left."
Andrea G.,"Katy, TX",563,45,119,5.0,4/17/2015,Our Waitress name is Kristin She was super sweet very attentive our food was brought fast and hot I had two drinks both delicious I will for sure come back to try the cheesecake but this time around I was full with what I ordered. Over all a great experience
Abdulsalam A.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,2.0,9/20/2015,"Was there last night, the attendant did not write the oreder and thats why he forgot some :)  I did say nothing and when I was done I reminded him then he said I did it intentionally coze u ordered a lot of food!! What a liar  Desserts were fantastic unlike the main dishes"
Cherry A.,"Houston, TX",493,365,2190,3.0,8/24/2013,"I don't always go to chain restaurants, but when I do, it's often at the request of an out-of-towner friend. So, let's do this: lemme get excited about The Cheesecake Factory. First, I do love going to The Galleria for anything. So, next time, I won't be so cheap and deny myself valet service. I decided to park underground and hoof it up a flight of stairs, then another inside the mall ( yup, the escalators were out of service. of course the day I wear high heels. all in the name of sexy heels). Ok, so here's the skinny on the fat-laden Cheesecake factory: Pros: 1. In the mood for something off the menu? Don't hesitate to ask. My BFF was dying for some particular ""brunch-only"" grilled skirt steak and our server pulled some strings to get her exactly what she wanted despite us not being there during brunch. So thank you cool server for hooking us up! 2. The white and dark brown oat bread is warm and delicious with butter. OMG what I won't do for a warm bread basket.  3. Ask for a mango juice spritzer: half of their mango juice with seltzer. You'll thank me later, in case you end up diving in for a bite or three of cheesecake. 4. If you go during lunch, order from their lunch menu. Smaller portions with 2 sides and a smaller price ($11.99). I got the meatloaf with broccoli and sweet potato fries. 2 slices of tasty loaf, with  a little on the mushy side broccoli and perfectly salty sweet SP fries.   Cons: 1. If you sit on the patio upstairs, be sure to bring your sunglasses. You swear you were on the Love Boat 's Lido Desk. It gets super bright. Note: Vampires, sit inside.  2. Bathroom is downstairs only. Ladies, if wearing  heels, be prepared to take the elevator or walk down 1 flight of stairs.  3. Nothing truly exceptional here. The service is hit or miss: you won't get extremely friendly service or any special recommendations.  4. In my opinion, the cheesecakes here look impressive, but I'm more of a fan of smaller portions and lighter tasting cheesecakes. So for that reason, I can only warrant 3 stars.  All in all, if you're dining with someone who loves The Cheesecake Factory or a group with diverse tastes, their menu is perfect. And if you decide to go face first into dessert, you can always walk it off in the mall, but ladies, be sure to bring your walking shoes ;)"
Amelia B.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,28,8,5.0,5/29/2014,"My boyfriend and I are in town for Free Press Summerfest, working. We're staying at the Westin Galleria and around 10pm we really wanted something sweet to eat. The hotels room service is not good choices with even worse prices. The mall closes at 9 so we're excited that there was a Cheesecake Factory still open! My point is not to talk about quality. We're going there for cheesecake, obviously the quality is amazing! But the lady who worked the ""to go"" section was so nice. I wish we had gotten her name. We were chit chatting and it came up that it was my birthday tomorrow so when she gave me my order she told me there was a surprise inside that I wouldn't see until I got home. I got back to my hotel and saw their dollop of whipped cream included confetti and a candle.  I was touched. Thank you, and if you read this review I'm so sad I didn't get your name but you're awesome!"
Aaron M.,"Houston, TX",361,305,30,3.0,3/10/2014,"I have never been here when it has NOT been insanely busy.  I'm not sure what it is about this place that makes people lose their mind. It's in the Galleria - so parking is always a hassle.   There is almost always a wait, even on either end of peak times.  You could probably go at 2pm on a weekday and be ok.  But a Friday or Saturday night?  There's gonna be a wait. The hostesses have always been friendly.  However, I do have a SERIOUS problem with their tabling system.  As I noted earlier, this place is always packed.  When you check in, you're given a pager and told your wait time.  Unfortunately most other guests just pile up right there by the hostess stand.  When your table is ready, they buzz you, take your pager and point about 10 feet away and tell you to stand there and wait.  Again.  The place they pointed?  Right where everyone is hanging out OR trying to walk through.  It's a high traffic area for guests coming up the stairs below, waiters carrying food to tables, the check out place for people having just cheesecake, the folks just standing there because they have nowhere else to go AND the people just directed there by the hostess.   I just don't understand why it's done that way.  Buzz me via the pager, and hand me off immediately to a waiter or someone to seat me.  Please don't make me go dance around the dozens of other folks in that tiny little area. With that said, our waiter was fantastic.  Brandon seemed to be having a good time, and he was worth a large tip.   The food was also pretty damn good.  You're not going to get super fancy food that you'll never see again, but you will get a pretty excellent meal.  Between the drinks (Long Island is a beast), the appetizers (Buffalo Blasts, seriously) and the food (Chicken Romano!) - I was stuffed, fat and happy."
