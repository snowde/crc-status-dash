Christina L.,"Cedar Park, TX",171,40,22,4.0,12/28/2015,We came in on a busy Saturday night and were still seated within 10 minutes. Our server was incredibly attentive and personable. Both of our meals were delicious. Great experience!
Jeffrey G.,"Humble, TX",0,51,32,5.0,1/30/2016,Hello...I am behind on my reviews LOL...took my nephew shopping in the Galleria and surprised him with Cheesecake Factory...he loved the ambience and enjoyed his curry dish and I had the Cajun jambalaya ...both were just awesome..of course he got fudge/Oreo type cheesecake to go...I ate some of his and it was delicious....service was impeccable
Katie B.,"Houston, TX",121,154,69,1.0,10/28/2014,"One of my friends had a birthday reservation here- we had to wait an hour to be seated for a reservation made months ago while servers and their manager were laughing at us... Great job guys! You are probably the worst restaurant in Houston. Do yourself a favor and just go to Grand Lux Cafe, the company's other restaurant. I've experienced better service here."
Ania P.,"Houston, TX",0,25,11,1.0,1/29/2016,"Horrible service. Waited 15 mins for anyone to come up to us and get our drink order. I would understand if it was busy, which it wasn't or if they were short staffed, which they weren't. There were plenty of waiters walking around, doing nothing. Will not be coming back."
Bill G.,"Houston, TX",220,385,247,3.0,5/2/2013,"Tough to skip... Well cheesecake is one reason to not hate being at the mall. It's hard to go by without a taste. Really, really, really, slow service. Otherwise 4 stars. Did I mention that the service was slow? And not for lack of employees. There had to be at least 4 girls behind the cheesecake counter. Just none of them seemed to care about actually getting the job done. It took over 20 minutes for us to get three pieces of cheesecake to go!!!"
Amanda W.,"Kingwood, TX",227,154,109,5.0,7/24/2013,The experience i had here was phenomenal. Our waiter was out of this world!  The lunch portions are huge FYI!
Cee R.,"Richmond, TX",0,5,,1.0,2/14/2016,"We decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory Galleria  for a simple Valentine's Day outing and I must admit it was a disappointment.  I ordered 2 appetizers; crab cakes and lettuce wraps.  Less than stellar on taste and appearance.  The lettuce was EXTREMELY WILTED and the filling was SALTY! If I  had high blood pressure,  I'd be dead.  Ok so we waited over 30 minutes for crab cakes I had my mouth set for only to be brought what appeared to be 3 overcooked hockey pucks...needless to say I sent them back. The waiter then had the nerve to ask if we just wanted to go ahead and keep it. .NOT. ...so. .the entrees are here and we're about to see how's round 2..will b writing afterwards.... #2(UPDATE)- Okay; so I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta.... it was ""incomplete"".  The pasta was overcooked, no asparagus, no bell peppers, no peas, and highly unseasoned,  So can we say that was basically the entire pasta.  I sent it back only to wait another 20 minutes to eat while my husband's food was nice and hot.  Once the food came back; the Manager brought it and it was MUCH better.  The upside is; we were offered the chocolate cake which was phenomenal.  They took the appetizers off our check... wow, how nice .... (sarcastic) ...Not sure if I'll go back."
Ashley L.,"West University, Houston, TX",1,20,,1.0,11/9/2014,"Turrible... Absolutely turrible. We were seated literally so close to another group that we could were commenting on their conversation. Then we asked to move to a booth and the booth was dirty, along with the silverware.  The waiter kept forgetting things like water and bread. He was too close to my face when taking my order and his breath made me lose my appetite. There was also a lot of fruit flies in the restaurant. The silverware was dirty and the bottom of the plates of our appetizer had food debris stuck on it. To make matters worse, the food wasn't good. The only saving grace was the cheesecake, which I think they now sell at SAMs club so I won't be back.  Disappointing because I used to like this place. I'll be a Grand Luxe. PS the bathroom was so dirty it was like an outhouse. Do better Cheesecake, do better!!"
B.L. M.,"Milwaukee, WI",7,25,,1.0,11/8/2015,"This place has the worst service compared to any other Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. The hostess sat our party down and we had three little children ages 9, 1 and 2 years old. I found it funny that she placed the children's menu (not the coloring book one but the laminated one that has the kids menu) in front of the two youngest and said that these are for the kids. As if my one and two year old can read the menu. It took 10 minutes for our server to greet us.  She messed up my husband's order. I clearly heard his order and I understood it but she didn't. He ordered the grilled salmon and it came with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  He said he wanted asparagus instead of mashed potatoes and they bring him the salmon, asparagus and the mashed potatoes.  Anywho there are too many complaints I can write in details and I have better things to do with my time. The service sucks, the staff are snotty, they need to be trained with customer service. The food is still good if they get your order right. This place is not children friendly, they don't have the coloring book like the other Cheesecake Factory we used to go to.  We are never coming back here!"
Jesse L.,"Oakland, CA",396,312,42,3.0,8/10/2014,Typical cheesecake factory. Good local beers on draft and bottle. Separate bar downstairs. Busy. Nice staff. I love cheesecake factory food despight them being a chain. This is nothing special. Eat local if you can
Michael S.,"Houston, TX",95,61,36,1.0,7/30/2014,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Food is, as the French say, ""merde."" The chicken on the chicken bellagio tasted like rubber. I wouldn't be surprised if they heated it in the microwave and threw it on a plate. The pasta in the Pasta da Vinci was so dry. And the fact that the service was terrible and the waiter only brought water every 20 minutes didn't exactly help wet the palate. For the price, this may be one of the worst places I've ever been. Given the amount of good, local restaurants in Houston, I'm embarrassed that I ate here."
Kathleen H.,"North Tonawanda, NY",7,39,,2.0,10/28/2015,I try to avoid chain restaurants when I'm traveling because to want to get a taste of the area I'm visiting but I was already at the mall and I was hungry. I've gone to a Cheesecake Factory years ago and I remember liking everything I ordered but I couldn't remember what I previously ordered so I decided to wing it. I ordered the chicken Alfredo and it was incredibly soupy/watery and not very flavorful. The chicken was also pretty sad in portion size and quality. The good news is the cheesecake was life alteringly good - I highly recommend the red velvet cheesecake.
K F.,"Humble, TX",29,153,55,4.0,5/10/2015,"Came here on a Wednesday and had a great meal. It was made all the better by our server, Justin Cyrus. He was attentive, funny, interactive, and very sociable. He added to a great experience! The food was good, hot, and seasoned well (we had the salmon) but it was Justin that really stood out! lol"
Neha S.,"Houston, TX",0,45,7,3.0,11/30/2015,This is a great restaurant as is but a bit bland for my taste. The food is good and so is the cheesecake. We tried the spicy chipotle chicken pasta which is a big portion and the godiva cheesecake which was to die for. The drinks however were diluted and not up to mark...................maybe something the management could look into!
Annika D.,"Houston, TX",0,47,5,3.0,3/16/2014,"Basically a Chili's with a 100% markup. Their bread is better than most food on the menu. The menu suffers from too-much-itis or a hodgepodge of food that would probably give the world's best chefs a headache.  People come here for any random event so be sure to reserve a table around Valentines Day, Mothers Day, etc. The waiters are great and attentive. You're basically paying for the fancy interior."
Ana M.,"Houston, TX",2,66,20,2.0,10/28/2014,Yesterday we wend to have a dinner. Because we were in a rush we ordered our cheesecake to-go. Our waitress brought it on the plate. We nicely pointed out that we was going to take it to-go. We live 1 min away and after open box at home we found out she put cheesecake with strawberries and cream on the bottom so looked terrible.  Very poor service considering tips we left for her. I would recommend go to one in memorial- pretty nice service all the time.
Suzanne W.,"Thomson, GA",0,1,,4.0,11/16/2015,"We arrived at the airport with very little time to eat before a meeting. We called ahead to order but when we got there, we decided to eat there, but was told since we ordered online we could not be seated in the dining room. We ordered well done burgers, and they were medium at best. Also, dirty utensils"
Marcela J.,"Lake Charles, LA",69,8,5,3.0,11/16/2014,Clam chowder was not fresh. Our server kept forgetting things and was more of a deliverer of orders. Items ordered were Not brought to our table together. The tea was great. We were seated fast. Chinese chicken salad is always good and it's enough for 2. This place could use a little improvement
Jennifer B.,"New Ulm, TX",1,10,,1.0,1/16/2017,"We have been sitting here for 10 minutes and I finally had to get up and go ask the hostess if there was anyone serving our area because not one has approached us yet.  Based on this alone will probably never come back and we love the Cheesecake Factory.  So disappointing.  Update*order and appetizer, the fried cheese, and when we finally received it, they brought out fried Mac and cheese, when we told them, she went to get it fixed and came back about 10 min later to tell us the were out of the fried cheese.  We finally ordered our food about 40 minutes after we were seated, the food was ok, but overall this left a bad taste in our mouth and we won't be back.  There are much better restaurants in the galleria then this one.  Oh and the reason the staff isn't attentive is because everyone I looked for someone they were talking to each other, I saw some dancing, and some were even taking to what looked like friends that had come in."
Mike T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,141,27,3.0,6/14/2014,"I don't think a review is necessary.  This is a staple chain.  It's pretty reliable.  For those you who have not been or consider this a date spot, you should go.  It's a fairly large menu and nothing on the menu will taste bad.  You'll enjoy the atmosphere and gain weight from the cheesecake.   Pro tip: be careful walking around.  The floor seems to be slick sometimes, or at least that's been my experience."
