Kristy S.,"Plano, TX",0,38,4,1.0,12/3/2015,"Just like others commented, service was horrible.  Server never smiled once and acted as though I was inconveniencing him.  I never again saw my server after I ordered my entree - no drink refills or simply asking if the food was okay.  Management really needs to do a better job of ensuring guests are satisfied and should visit the tables.  I will not be back to this location again."
Glenn M.,"Lafayette, IN",0,7,1,4.0,1/11/2016,"Ate at the bar...  8:30p on a Monday.   Service was great, so was the food.  Bar tender was busy , and took care of everyone eating at the bar.  I had the ""skinny salmon"".  The garlic herb tartar sauce was a nice touch.  Good company.  Good times.  1st time here....so far I'm saying thumbs up."
Christina V.,"Houston, TX",234,230,355,4.0,5/20/2012,"This review is not about the food or drinks!  I have always loved The Cheesecake Factory, but today the service was below par for what I am used to receiving here so SERVICE is what my review is about.   I decided to eat here today for Sunday brunch and invited my best friend and her husband who are from Orlando.  I know there are plenty of Cheesecake Factory restaurants, but my best friend and I love The Cheesecake Factory and the Galleria area, so why not bring him here so they can eat delicious food while enjoy the view of Uptown Galleria area?  Well, we were seated by the hostess in a booth by the stairs on the second floor across from the elevator.  I asked if we could move closer to the window, but the hostess said they were reserved, but I thought that was odd because The Cheesecake Factory normally does not take reservations, unless I have been lied to every year when I plan to have my birthday dinners there and we all had to get there super early to get a table because I was told they do not take reservations.   There were small parties and some booths that were occupied near the windows, so we did not understand why they told us those tables were reserved.  We asked another hostess again just in case maybe the other hostess did not understand us the first time.  This time we were told that since it was still early (11AM on Sunday and they open at 10AM) they were understaffed so they couldn't seat us at those tables.  It was still puzzling, but we didn't want to make a scene about it.  It was disappointing to eat at a beautiful restaurant and not get to enjoy the views.  We came early with intentions that we could get a good table with a nice view and beat the rush, but instead we were not rewarded.  A few minutes into our meal, the tables by the windows were occupied.   I really don't understand what the issue was as to why we could not have been seated near a window, but I hope that in the future, the staff could be more understanding and give a better explanation for why guests cannot be seated where they request to be seated."
Gaby S.,"Galveston, TX",3,24,6,4.0,9/30/2015,"Amazing Brunch! Went on a Sunday while visiting son in Houston and we had a fabulous brunch with amazing service. The suggestions for brunch were perfect for our taste. Of course after our meal, we were offered cheesecake... oh that was a tough decision!! Yes we decided to split a slice since their slices are huge and delicious! We ordered the red velvet cake cheesecake and it was out of this world. We enjoyed every single piece of that cheesecake! This visit completed our weekend and sure put a smile on our face after enjoying the friendly service and the delicious food!"
Stephanie R.,"Syracuse, NY",1,11,6,4.0,11/16/2014,The staff seemed spread a little too thin. You have to go upstairs to be sat and there is no seating for waiting for a table which kinda turned me off. Little. However once we got to the table our server was very warm and welcoming and was swift in her service. I had the buffalo burger and mashed potatoes. The burger was juicy and had just enough blue cheese and buffalo sauce. Perfect balance. Potatoes were a little on the dry side but still as delicious as always.
Varun R.,"Houston, TX",0,7,1,4.0,10/14/2015,Consistently good. Great Service. Wide variety to chose from.
Jennifer H.,"Houston, TX",0,16,,1.0,12/27/2015,"Toni was a great server. She asked the manager several times would he turn this music down because we were yelling at each other. When the manager, Brett, walked by we even asked him ourselves if he could turn down the music. He said, yes. After some time he passed our table again and we sarcastically said ""thanks for turning the music down."" He replied, ""sure.""  Music never was adjusted. We opted out of cheesecake and went home. This was our pre Christmas dinner. It will NEVER be at this restaurant. Thanks Toni for salvaging an almost horrible night at the Cheesecake Factory."
Catherine N.,"San Jose, CA",1,10,,4.0,12/16/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.It is such a cute place with nice decors for a nice outing with family and friend.I always go with pasta da Vinci and fresh strawberry cheesecake.Overall,I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.Excellent food and service."
Justin H.,"Houston, TX",1,2,,2.0,12/15/2015,"All in all, the cheese cake factory is a mediocre restaurant. The food was a bit over priced and didn't taste that good. But what bites the most is the fact that service was horrendous. We waited about 35 minutes to get our food, and had to wait 30 minutes for the waiter to notice that we didn't have any bread. Also, they took away our bread before we had a chance to finish it!!!!"
Kim M.,"Houston, TX",21,6,1,2.0,12/15/2015,"I love the cheesecake here but I do not like to dine in the restaurant... The service is slow (and questionable) for both of the times I came here. My boyfriend and I were waiting for our bread and the waiter asked ""Do ya'all want some bread?"". Uhm, yes of course...!"
Sam J.,"Missouri City, TX",0,20,2,1.0,12/12/2015,Bathroom is absolutely disgusting. Waiter came after 20 mins. They ran out of bread. Need to improve on serivce!
Malenda S.,"Houston, TX",4,4,,1.0,3/3/2014,"Came in on a busy night last night w my 3month old daughter and pregnant best friend. Upon entering by the cheesecake displays she slipped (NOT fell.. She just slid a bit and caught her herself) she got pretty upset, so I told one of the employees there's a slippery spot and she said ""ok"" and kept walking. We waited about 10-12min before being seated. I ordered the pasta with meat sauce and got the stomach virus from it. & my 3month old daughter got sick with congestion and cough. Never again! Did I mention that when going to the bathroom my friend slid AGAIN!? Called to let them know about my experience and she conveniently couldn't find my receipt in the system and asked for my address to ""get something sent out to you in the next couple of days"".. How about paying my co-pay for the hospital visits, or helping me take care of a sweet 3month old baby girl.  Ugh!! Only thing good about last night was our darling waitress, Jeanette. (Think that's how it's spelled) She was the ONE STAR of the night."
Amber G.,"San Antonio, TX",82,41,206,5.0,3/19/2014,"First time at the Cheesecake Factory and I was very impressed.  People there have a true service attitude and the meal was delish.  I had the miso salmon at the recommendation of our awesome waitress Heidi.   And my coworker had the herb crusted fish.  Both were amazing and don't forget the bread hot fresh and soft as well as the avocado rolls.....YUM YALL.  Thank you Frontier for paying for my company meal because it WAS NOT WASTED.  Oh, and a shout out to Justin..... (told ya I would mention you!)  He was delightful as well."
Siraj L.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,1.0,10/19/2015,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! This is the worst Cheesecake Factory location I have ever been to. If you are going in a group then this place is a big NO NO. We waited for more than an hour to be seated but guess what, even after this long of a wait we waited another 15 minutes at the table and we weren't served with either water or bread. After waiting for so long, we called the manager and left the place. We will not return to this location."
Mo T.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,4,,1.0,6/21/2016,"The service was very terrible, because they mess up our orders numerous time. And the southwest sandwich I order was not no way near being southwest, it was definitely a south-mess."
Preston L.,"Houston, TX",143,6,4,4.0,11/25/2015,"I think The Chessecake factory is by far the best place to go when it comes to variety. They have every style of cuisine and anyone on any budget can find something to eat that they will enjoy. Let me forewarn you though, the portion sizes are huge! I order a small Caesar salad and can literally share it with two other people as a starter. I highly recommend that you eat family style here so you can get the most out of the restaurant.   They have over 250 menu items and any kind of cheese cake you can imagine. It's hit or miss when it comes to service but the food quality keeps you coming back for more. This is also a great place to bring someone out on a date to, because you will know that no matter what there will be something on the menu that they will surely enjoy. Must try at least once!"
Daniel G.,"Weslaco, TX",38,32,73,5.0,7/19/2014,It's The Cheesecake Factory enough said...
Timmy T.,"Houston, TX",19,9,4,1.0,9/1/2015,"I'm sorry, but Cheesecake Factory I will no longer eat here. I have thought about writing and making a decision, and I am now anti Cheesecake Factory. On my Birthdays on August 20 not once but TWICE here my order was forgotten with this company and once in The Woodlands. Of course I was the first to order what I want, very simple, all I ask for was the Tomato Basil Pasta...however disputes that my defense mechanism was up during the time and the chef made my plate, however everyone in my family was done eating and not only that, they brought it out once they were done eating. I was devastated and disgusted and just told them I no longer want the food. Galleria Cheesecake Factory, thanks for making me dislike your company so much."
Jane D.,"Houston, TX",0,21,,5.0,10/3/2015,Delicious and an enormous size menu! Everything imaginable is on the menu! My favorite is the vegetarian burger made from beets. Sounds terrible but trust me it's awesome. Full bar.
R J.,"Houston, TX",0,130,,2.0,5/5/2016,"We have heard lots of good thiings about this place, but this was our first, & certainly our last visit. In a group of 8 & NOTHING impressed, but several disappointments. Great looking place & we had good wait service, but the food was just so very average that we won't return.  Kitchen service was definitely OFF. 3 orders of fish & chips were served without the cole slaw, which was brought as the table was being cleared. 2 orders of soup arrived along with the cole slaw, after everyone else was finished. Must have been out of both, & the kitchen had to make more? Fried shrimp & fish both looked like they came right out of a freezer box."
