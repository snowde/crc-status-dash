Roxy G.,"Houston, TX",11,15,,2.0,2/2/2014,"Good: The food was DELICIOUS!! Everything came warm and tasted really good.  Bad: The service starting from the rude and hungover looking hostess to the waitstaff was TERRIBLE!! The friendliest of all were the bust boys cleaning up around us. Our waitress was very apologetic the whole time we were there, but come on...if you are having to apologize every time you come to the table...something is WRONG! Our appetizer arrived like 2 minutes before our food...and even thought it was really good (the salmon firesticks) we kinda had to eat it quick to try and clear plates on the table and make room for our entrees.....Oh but you know what DID come right on time with no wait or stalling??....the to-go boxes and check. Felt like they were trying to kick us out and on to the next! This is my third time there and the service has been bad every single time!"
Suzanne W.,"Seattle, WA",110,189,108,3.0,6/5/2014,"I've been to one other Cheesecake Factory location in another city, but this one is definitely more upscale. First off, it's located in the Galleria shopping center. And it's 2 stories! But it's location means this restaurant gets pretty crowded in the evenings. When I went, we had to wait for about 15 minutes and there wasn't a good waiting area. It sure was fancy inside though! As for the meal itself... I always eat too much of the yummy wheat bread appetizer and I think we asked for about 2 or 3 refills (the waitress might have been annoyed). My friend ordered some kind of Mexican salad with chicken and cheese and peanut dressing which was huge; she said it was really good and didn't even finish the entire portion. I ordered a salad with salmon which was pretty average. The salmon was slightly dry. Definitely not worth the $15 I paid. We didn't end up getting cheesecake but I've had it before and it's really good - super rich and creamy! One slice is wayyyyy more than enough for one person. I'd say 2-3 people can share so at $7 a slice, it's a good deal! All the flavors I've tried I've liked but my favorite flavor is the red velvet.  In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is pricy for what the food is but the cheesecake is worth coming for with a friend!"
Luis H.,"Houston, TX",8,34,1,2.0,2/26/2014,"I gave them two stars because of their delicious cheesecakes and fried macaroni balls. Regardless of the small  pros, being jammed in their long banquet style benches where the table that you sit on is going to to be a rough foot diameter of personal space. I apologize but that just makes awkward staring contest with people next to you. Well maybe they have their own technique and the goal is for guests to communicate with one another.. It's not workinh"
Elizabeth M.,"Houston, TX",24,162,4,2.0,1/20/2014,"Good: The food in general is consistent across all Cheesecake Factory restaurants, that is not necessarily what i am reviewing.   Clean tables, clean restrooms Always love the Santa Fe Salad Bad: The service.  The hostess on Sunday morning (Jan 19, 2014) were very rude.  The fact that I had a stroller (in a mall, mind you) was inconveniencing them greatly.  They were rude to me and I will never dine there with my family again because of that."
Justin L.,"Houston, TX",132,45,29,4.0,11/22/2014,The cheese cake factory is a great place for any time of the day. Their menu is one of the largest menus I have ever seen. You can always find something you like. The food is always good as well as the service. The strawberry cheese cake is the best.
Dana A.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,18,46,3.0,8/9/2014,"Normally we can't go wrong at the cheesecake factory, but the service was reall off and our food took so long to come out. It was tasty but we were turned  by the lack of attention we got. We had them  up the food and went back to our hotel."
Melissa G.,"Katy, TX",104,646,82,3.0,3/5/2012,"I just don't get what Houstonians see in this place - except for maybe dessert.   The majority of their food is okay, but that's about it.  I've ordered pasta dishes and found a few different types of pasta floating in with my entree - this doesn't really inspire me with confidence where their food quality is concerned.  It really makes me think that it is just like McDonalds, but you sit down to eat and the food is on a plate.  The menu never actually changes either - just the names of the items (our waitress told us this) or the pretty pictures of desserts scattered inside and out. The portions are huge.  If you have anything else to do while you are at the Galleria and know you won't be bringing any leftovers home, then most of the pasta, salad, and dinner entrees will be a waste of money for you.  If you want to leave the table without feeling bloated, then try a sandwich or burger with a small side-salad instead of the fries.  I did this for the first time on this visit and it is the first time I've left the restaurant and felt like I could continue to walk around comfortably.   The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that if I want a slice of cheesecake I can walk in, get my slice of cake to-go, and then walk out.  That's about it.  Otherwise, it's just a typical mediocre chain."
Grace P.,"Houston, TX",114,318,40,1.0,11/14/2013,"Don't be fooled by The Cheesecake Factory's grand appearance. I have received poor service here several times so I will usually not come here at my own will. It's open late, and the location is convenient, those must surely be the only reasons why it's so packed. The dishes here are mediocre calorie bombs. The cheesecake is good, but I've had better.  Service was particularly terrible on our most recent visit. My burger was cold, my friend's chicken was lukewarm, and my husband's appetizer was so hot, I almost burned my fingers when I reached for a portion of it. My friend asked for lemon for her water and more bread, and we received neither. My fries weren't delivered until much later, and the server dashed off so fast, I couldn't even ask for ketchup. Seriously, who eats fries without condiments? Drinks were never refilled, I ended up giving my friend half of my glass of water. At the end of our meal, we asked for our checks, and the server just tossed them on the table. Not even a ""thank you for dining with us"", or ""have a good night"". Mind you, it was NOT a busy night, and it's not like we were here during the dinner rush. The Cheesecake Factory is the most overrated restaurant in Houston, and this is the worst $30 I've spent in a long time."
Frank M.,"Humble, TX",177,7,4,2.0,11/7/2015,We went to this restaurant after taking the kids to the library. Parking was hard to find so we just paid for valet. Service was slow and my order was placed wrong.
Mario V.,"Washington Corridor, Houston, TX",67,34,5,1.0,2/2/2014,I have been to this location 3 times in the past 6 months. Every time I have received bad service. I'm not sure if the service is due to bad mgt or the wait staff. I understand this is a tourist location but come on.  1st bad experience host told us 15 min. That ended up to 1hr and half. Then the waiter forgot my sisters food 2nd bad experience there was no wait but might as well been. Took us about the same to get our food.  3rd bad exp. utensils were dirty(2 sets). They where out of cokes. Rude wait staff. I could go on but my food finally got here.   I do not know why I keep coming back here maybe because I get gift cards from family.
Stephen R.,"Houston, TX",95,95,638,2.0,9/28/2013,"Grandiose (adjective): characterized by affectation of grandeur or splendor or by absurd exaggeration. That would be a good starting description for The Cheesecake Factory. This particular location is large, two floors, and always crowded. The inside architecture/design reminds me of the ridiculous dining rooms on Carnival Cruise ships. All around over the top. To go along with the over the top interior design, the menus are filled with a crazy variety of foods.  The Food: First, there is a lot of variety (from pizza, to tacos, to steaks, to pastas, to everything else). Second, the food is probably more costly than it should be. Paying almost 20 dollars for chicken/cheese pasta is a little on the expensive side. The price may be proportional to the portion size, which is very large. I think it would be better if they made the portion smaller, and lowered the price to match the size. Beyond the pasta, I've had their pizza, burgers, steaks, pork chops, and chicken. Whoa, I've been to The Cheesecake Factory too many times. The food has not been terrible, it just has not been memorable. And the Cheesecake: The Cheesecake Factory wins the prize for having the worst tasting cheesecake flavor/combination I've ever had.... Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. It was bad, but maybe it was my fault for ordering something like Key Lime Pie Cheesecake. Go ahead, say ""Key Lime Pie Cheesecake"" out loud. Sounds terrible doesn't it? Ignoring the above, the other cheesecakes I've tried were not bad. Strawberry, Oreo, Snickers, Raspberry, Cherry, etc. They are 7-8 dollars, large, and easily shareable between two people. The Cheesecake Factory must be doing something right though. They are always packed. I can't say that I've ever had bad service. Sometimes slow service, but I can see why given the volume of people in the restaurant(s) when I've been there. I've been many times, though I must say that it's never been my idea to go! The Cheesecake Factory tries to do too much and fails at having anything memorable. It is definitely average... but average should not cost this much. Somewhere between 2-3 stars."
Mike C.,"Houston, TX",52,105,179,4.0,10/30/2013,"I really wanted to hate this place ( tired of hearing, oh you gotta try it).  Holy shite, I freakin luv it! Their spin on The Steak Diane is fabulous! Pasta dishes are kick azz! Not sure which cheese cake is my favorite ( still experimenting with that). The Galleria location is my favorite at the moment, but I will try The Clear Lake/ BayBrook Mall location on my next visit."
Bryson H.,"Florence, SC",1,4,,5.0,1/1/2015,Very good.  Food was very fresh and to us in under 20 minutes. Only problem was the seating. It took us about a half hour to be seated and was very hot where we were waiting. Other than the seating the experience was great. Will be visiting again.
Kathryn H.,"Houston, TX",80,82,9,2.0,5/13/2014,"I know a lot of people cultishly love this place.  Co-workers rave about it and light up when they get to go for their birthday.  These are the same co-workers that prefer Miller Lite over a special crafted pilsner.   I went years ago, and just never went back.  We had a party of five, and it was during the busiest time possible (much to my chagrin).  I don't know why my friends at the time insisted on going when you couldn't fit your pinky toe into the building because of the crowds.   Needless today, that pretty much put my experience way down low - and it's really not their fault for the bad timing of my friends.    I might have thought better of it if I went when it wasn't swarming with people.  Personally, I prefer the smooth and creamy type of cheesecake - I'm not a fan of the curdled cheesecakes that have this weird, pilly texture.  I recognize that it's a personal preference over actual quality.  Everyone else loved theirs - I just don't like my cheesecake to have that consistency.   The food was so overly salted, the vegetables were mushy and overcooked, and the chicken I had was definitely pre-prepared.   The portion was almost four meals for myself - and I ended up throwing most of it away.   I have heard that they've introduced a diet, small plate, or skinny menu, but I just wasn't impressed enough to go back on my own. If my friends invite me, I might give them another go - I just didn't see what all the hype was about."
Matt F.,"Alexandria, VA",0,205,1,4.0,4/23/2016,"Always a staple if/when on the road. I usually go to a local spot, but I am not going to lie, I wanted a slice of CHEESECAKE!"
Federica A.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,9/26/2015,"Terribile service! We waited over one hour to be sitted and one hour to be served. we had to ask several times for several items. They didn't get a single thing of our order right. I don't think I will ever go back again. My burger, which I asked rare and got medium/well done instead, was nothing special. The cheesecake was good, otherwise they would have got zero stars!"
Nicole W.,"Conroe, TX",0,9,,2.0,7/14/2014,"The food: only thing I like here is the crab cakes. My steak was OVER OVER cooked!!  The service: I wait about 30 minutes to get my food, and the table next to us was ordered after us and got their food earlier than us."
Tiffany L.,"Austin, TX",218,151,585,3.0,7/31/2013,"Cheesecake: 4 star Service: 1 star  Average= 2.5 stars, but feeling generous since I just ate, so round up to 3. Wahoo for National Cheesecake day!  I was a bit eager, and jumped on their promo for half off a slice of cheesecake a day before the actual day.  Arrived, put name down and was surprisingly seated with no less than a 10 minute wait.  I could be wrong as I was distracted by the case of cheesecakes, trying to decide which one to get really made time fly.  Seated, promptly brought out a basket of bread and butter and I obligingly ate even though I was only here for dessert.  We had brown bread and white bread, I didn't care for the white one as I think it was Sourdough but I liked the slight sweetness of the brown one (Rye with flakes of Oatmeal?).  Anyways the brown bread was good and went well with the butter.  I think it is just your generic butter but the combination was addictive to me, I love bread and butter, especially since this one was warm!  However, I devoured this one while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and when the second basket came, it was cold =(, I don't like cold bread. I wasn't super upset as our cheesecake and guests arrived shortly after and food always makes me happy.  We really wanted the tiramisu cake, but promo didn't work for cakes so bf and I split the tiramisu cheesecake.  The cheesecake version is denser and I think I prefer the traditional fluffy, light, creamy mousse, but the flavor profile overall was good.  I liked how I could taste the mocha flavor and it wasn't overly sweet and the whip cream was good.  Sadly our dining experience ended on a sour note as the service we received from our waitress was subpar.  I understood she was busy but she didn't seem so pleasant.  When I asked for another set of silverware and more bread for our guests she sounded reluctant to get it.  We also ended up waiting over 10 minutes to pay and had to have another waiter handle our bill."
Meisha D.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",4,73,21,5.0,2/5/2016,This place was great! Our waitress was precious. I ordered the avocado egg rolls and the stuffed macaroni balls and I was speechless! Great choice if you're vegetarian awesome choice if you're not ;)
E B.,"Houston, TX",6,53,22,3.0,3/31/2015,The neatest one I've been to! I only ordered the calamari and it was good. Light and crispy.  Customer service of waitress was OK. Seemed as though she was ready to leave work. But sometimes we have those days...
