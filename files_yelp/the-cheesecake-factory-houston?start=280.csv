Indu R.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/19/2016,We went to the galleria location to have a nice birthday dinner for my husband.  I ordered the veggie burger and after tasting it I knew it was rotten. There was a sour taste.  I told the waitress who called the manager.  The manager told me I could get something different but I completely  lost my appetite after tasting the rotten  food.  She told me to think about it and they would comp me a meal.  After 20 minutes or so I asked our waitress what I would like to get to go.  She immediately told  me that I would have to pay for it.  When I told her the manager told me I could get something she  said no because they already took the rotten meal off  my bill.  Ummm  well  yes considering I never ate any of that food it better be off my bill!!  I didn't want to make a scene  since we were there to celebrate my husbands bday but after that experience I have a really bad impression of this place.  I never would have imagined this restaurant would sell sour/rotten food.  Communication is also poor between wait staff and management.
Aimee L.,"Houston, TX",427,490,97,4.0,12/17/2013,"I have been coming here for years and what I love about the Cheesecake factory is how consistent they always are. My favorite thing here now is that the skinnylicious menu. Great, fresh, delicious, and guilt free food. For low calories dishes, you still get a pretty generous portion.  Because I am able to save calories on my entree, it leaves me room to induldged in their cheesecake. Personally I don't think you can go wrong with any of the cheesecakes however my favorites are the Godiva, Tiramisu, and the Smores."
S A A.,"Houston, TX",82,35,20,3.0,3/17/2015,"The food food is ok if you know what to order and the drinks are too sweet for my taste.  I don't think anyone at this location was trained to smile at the customers: bartender, waitstaff, host, or valet.  I left an undeserved 18% tip and still didn't get a smile or a ""thank you"" from anyone.  I don't recommend coming here to be cheered up on a bad day. That is not their strong point."
Jessica B.,"Sugar Land, TX",124,20,14,4.0,2/21/2014,"I'm rating just this experience and service. Because normally Cheesecake Factory food is a miss or barely hit. Today was different, thank goodness. I also asked the waiter about my choices and they were honest with me. Told me motto get grilled fish because it's too dry. So I decided to go with the Jamaican pepper spiced dish. I like spicy and it had a kick but wasn't anywhere near overwhelming. Full of flavor (chicken and shrimp), plantains were cooked exactly like I like them(medium, a little firm but breaks when you cut through) the black beans were seasoned well so I just mixed my rice with it and wonderfulness happened(lol) even the mango mixture was power packed! This experience was worth five stars. I waited 15 min (which I was told), my bread came out promptly(though only warm, I'd prefer hot), and my food was out 15 after I sat. 4 1/2 stars!"
Leighanne F.,"Bellevue, NE",8,15,1,1.0,2/22/2016,"Absolutely the worst service I've ever received. Sat for 35 minutes with no food. Finally salad and chicken salad sandwich arrived for my friend, my food was still missing. We were assured it was on the way. After another 20 minutes and still no food, our server stopped by to check on us and I asked how much longer it would be. She said it was on the way and left. 5 minutes later she just returned with my side dish. I asked that it be to go because I had to go back to work. After waiting another 5 minutes and nothing we asked for the manager. The manager came over and said she would get my food and out bill was taken care of. Once the to go bag came we left only to be chased out in the mall, 10 stores down, where the waiter openly accused us of dining and dashing. We told the server the manager told us we were covered. She said we needed to come back and pay. We walked all the way back, escorted by her like criminals in the mall, only for the manager to tell us no we are good to go. So frustrating!! Will never go back here."
Samuel R.,"New York, NY",0,9,,2.0,6/28/2015,"Came here on a recent Sunday for brunch and experienced the worst service ever. They repeatedly got the orders wrong and took forever with the food despite the restaurant being practically empty. While the pancakes were tasty, there was nothing to remove the bad taste of poor service from our mouths."
Taylor B.,"Houston, TX",74,78,66,4.0,10/28/2011,"This place seems to get a bad rap as being overpriced. I don't know where that idea is coming from as they give you a lot of food and it's always good quality.  The location by the Galleria isn't the nicest location I've been to, but the fact that it's inside of a mall makes it perfect for a weekend dinner or lunch. Last week after a lovely visit to the Houston Zoo I deiced to eat here with my friend Tien for dinner. Our waitress was very friendly and got our drink order filled right away. It wasn't until a few years ago they started putting a sweet tea option on the menu. Their passion fruit tea is terrible and taste like soap. Tien ordered the strawberry lemonade which is sweet and delcious.(Stole some while she wasn't looking) I've been here several times so I can honestly say everything, even the bread is fantastic. The Santa Fe Salad is the only thing green I will eat. The Salmon is always baked to perfection and can be cut with your fork. Event the burger and fries are good here. The biggest downside to the great tasting food is that it's very hard to leave room for cheesecake. It's always such a let down walking bast those monster sized cakes and knowing that if you eat another bite you wont be able to make it home. There is also an issue with wait times it can get pretty hectic here, and sometimes you can end up waiting a very long time to eat. Other than that Cheese Cake Factory is great, and I'm sure many of you have already eaten here, so enjoy your next visit!"
Sarah G.,"Towson, MD",47,288,,4.0,3/6/2013,"Mahi tacos (shared with a friend), flourless chocolate cake, Limoncello creme torte and an espresso! That's all I need to be happy. They do a great job here--the location is huge (2 stories, is that common? Haven't been to any other locations) and the set up is so elaborate I have no idea how the waiters and hosts know their way around the food delivery, table finding, and ticket administration procedures. You need a sherpa to go to the bathroom. I can't tell you much about decor, because it is kind of crazy and dark and shiny inside and always busy walking through to your table, but once you are sat, you can chat with your companions pretty easily and hear each other. All I remember for my party of 5 was a big soft leather crescent shaped booth and lots of mirrors behind everyone's heads. I disagree with the ""overpriced Chilis"" comparison. Yes it has basics like hamburgers for the picky people, but their menu is pretty diverse, too, and they do a good job having something available for everyone without being overly generic. If you want a burger, who cares! Get one for god's sake! It's your life, go for it! But you can also get beets with goat cheese, Vietnamese tacos, Ahi tartare, Lemon Ricotta pancakes (die! esp with bacon), a Navajo sandwich (with fry bread!), sweet corn tamale cakes...you could eat here every day and not try everything that piques your interest. My favorite part is that it is priced reasonably, but tries new things all the times. It's accessible! I think if you are coming here for a ""dining experience"" [snob voice] and are a person who sniffs the wine cork, you will be disappointed. But coming in for a shot of port and dessert, why not!  Yes, it's a chain, but a damn good one! I am happy to drop a $20 here. More like $30 for myself by the time I am done eating, but it is one of those places that has both awesome desserts (and not just cheesecake) and the food is great too! Huge plates, though, so probably share. OR just get dessert and commit to a whole slice. I have never had anything I wouldn't order again! This is where I eat when I am at the Galleria, for sure, but even if I am not at the Galleria, I would make a special trip to the Westheimer location just to get a good desert fix. It's hard to find a dessert place anymore, and I don't care what anyone in Houston says--a cupcake is not a desert! It's a snack!"
Christine L.,"Houston, TX",39,383,152,5.0,9/30/2011,"We had a great Friday lunch.  My tropical smoothie was good - the hummus was a huge portion - and we had their soup/salad/sandwich special which was HUMONGOUS.  No wait today. My clam chowder was good and I liked the basalmic dressing on the salad.  Couldn't even start on the chicken salad sandwich. For a chain restaurant, it doesn't get much better.!Our server was good.  However must note that the 3 girls who sat down next to us right after us didn't even get their meals... and this was when were were finished with ours and were leaving!  The server kept on apologizing for the delay...I do not know what they ordered...but they are welcome to YELP about it!"
Jonathan W.,"Richmond, TX",17,74,6,1.0,11/5/2014,"Just ate here food was undercooked and now I'm sick. Service was bad don't eat here!!! Then the manager comes by and ask how is everything I say it's just ok, and doesn't even ask why I said ok, and not what's wrong."
Lisa J.,"Houston, TX",39,27,12,1.0,12/20/2014,"My friends and I waited 2 hours to be seated, which is understandable for a group of 14 people. HOWEVER, they split us up into two tables that were across the room from each other! Awesome Christmas dinner with the friends cheesecake... NOT!"
Brian H.,"Nashville, TN",0,18,1,1.0,5/13/2015,We came in for dessert and a drink . The hostess was rude and unhelpful. The only thing good about this particular cheesecake factory was that we got it to go and avoided dealing with there staff any further...  Its a shame that this place has great food and dont invest in better staff....will not go back to this location ever again
Sarah J.,"Houston, TX",0,13,2,3.0,5/13/2015,"Though it was busy our food was excellent, I would have liked our server to stop by the table a little more often as we had to ask other waiters to refill our drinks. The restaurant was extremely cold which seemed strange for the weather but other than that overall had a positive experience."
Kristin O.,"Houston, TX",38,55,91,3.0,11/13/2013,"I know this location has a ton of traffic because it's the Galleria -- it's always slammed. But it always has dirty floors, which is a major turnoff for me.  The staff also looks unkempt, many with nappy hair and dirty shoes. (This speaks nothing of color, btw -- our server was white, and her hair was gross.)  It just takes away from the polish this restaurant exudes.  The food & cheesecake are phenomenal as always though, and the service is fast...  So you gotta give them that."
Andrew E.,"Houston, TX",99,353,50,3.0,6/27/2013,"What's not to like about the Cheesecake Factory? Well okay, maybe their prices, but 7 bucks for a slice of cheese cake is pretty middle of the road when it comes to buying dessert at a chain restaurant. This has its pros and cons - the prices are average, but so is the dessert.  While they are a step above what you might get at Restaurant X, Y, Z, they really are just a cookbook dessert.  This makes me sadder when I know I can buy a whole cheesecake, not just a slice, at Costco for 14 bucks.  Ok that was an unfair comparison. The Costco's cheesecake selection is nowhere near as expansive as the Cheesecake Factory's but the quality is on par in my opinion. I guess in short, the cheesecake tastes good, but it is no way mindblowing. This is just a good place to grab a bite to eat with friends and enjoy some decent desert. But like any chain restaurant, it lacks the 'must have' ring to it. Service is meh - I saw one of the guys drop a to-go order, look around and pick it up. Sadly that was my fiancee's to-go order. Maybe that's why I'm unimpressed. For how much you pay, you should at least get quality. Throwing away that slice and giving customers quality is far more important than saving the $1 that slice is really worth and pissing them off later. Seeing as my fiancee is a Yelp Elite, I'm sure she'll be posting about her experience with photo evidence."
Igno R.,"Houston, TX",0,81,,1.0,8/24/2014,Avoid this location.  The service is awful and has gone down hill even more so than the last time I was here.  Actually the service here is non-existent.  It took forever to get water or bread.  Over an hour for the meal not to mention the hour wait to get seated.  The food is subpar.  Our orders were screwed up.  I got sick afterwards.    Not coming back to this location.
Mark M.,"Houston, TX",121,258,228,4.0,6/4/2013,"I hadn't been to this location in a LONG time.  I'm not particularly a fan of the ambiance b/c it feels a little too touristy for my tastes.  I went here last FRI for a 20 person birthday celebration.  I was pleasantly surprised that there were no major kerfuffles but, you know there's always ONE person in the group that puts up a stink. (she's THAT person, so you can disregard).  Also, I am always amazed at how large their menu is and how they are able to prep everything so quickly.  My partner had the stuffed chicken tortilla (which was basically an enchilada) which was very good considering he ordered it from 'Cheesecake' and I had the shrimp club sandwich which should have more shrimp but that's just my own personal preference. The servers were very proficient and made our experience really enjoyable.  Needless to say, the birthday boy was very happy and no one had to pay anyone else's bill."
Gary L.,"Houston, TX",6,4,4,1.0,12/15/2013,"Wait foever to get a waiter, actually had to ask for a waiter to take the order. And even wosrt, the chicken potsticker is raw, don't order it. If they dont know how to cook it, they shouldn't put it on the menu."
Daniel L.,"Houston, TX",4999,1312,2725,2.0,10/13/2010,"This is the Houston staple, or at least in my opinion it is. This is probably the safest place to take anyone since the menu is so large, it is in the Galleria so it is happy/shiny, and it is good food. The food review is going to be severed into two parts: not-cheesecake and cheesecake. Not-cheesecake: The salads are fine. The burgers are fine. The fish tacos are the best thing in my opinion, that is usually what I am ordering. The food is better than so-so or middling honestly. You won't not eat the food. But I have never had an OMGincredible meal here. Sorry, I still love the place but you really don't come here for the best burger in the world. Cheesecake: This is why I come here. The cheesecake is incredible. The list of options is bigger than my head. I try a new one every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory in any city I am in, and I still have maybe had half of the options. My only nit-picky things with this location are that the drinks are expensive and it gets quite noisy depending on where you sit. If you get the right seat it is perfect. Get the wrong seat and you might grind your teeth a bit.  If you come here, these are my instructions: chit-chat before and after, and just stuff your face with fish tacos and cheesecake as the noise surrounds you like a glove = the perfect time at the Factory."
Halston P.,"Houston, TX",161,39,23,3.0,1/10/2016,"Super noisy, the employees can barely handle the customers. Good food. Y'all need cushions for the booths, they're too far away for the tables and are so uncomfortable to sit in. Waiters need to be more enthusiastic and personable. Bread wasn't brought out immediately, and had to wait around 30mins for it. This restaurant needs a make over."
