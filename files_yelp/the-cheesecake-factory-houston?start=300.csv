Lawrence V.,"Houston, TX",152,140,197,5.0,6/15/2013,"Try the luau salad!:) it's good. I don't normally eat salads, however this is one I like."
Manish S.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",12,9,1,4.0,11/16/2013,"Always wanted to come here and have cheese cake. Finally made the plan and went there. It was nice, pleasant ambience, loved the initial welcome.  Ordered customized Veggie Enchiladas and my friends ordered some chicken dish. Loved the food and finally cheese cake, it was delicious, yummy White Chocolate raspberry and Godiva chocolate.  Prices were $$. Still worth it."
Brie H.,"Leander, TX",21,30,,2.0,2/8/2015,"Went here with my husband for my birthday dinner, we aren't  from the area but know we like cheesecake factory. We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday night. First off, it was an absolute mad house. They had us go upstairs to wait, and there were people everywhere standing around waiting- all the way out into the hallway which connects to the mall. The hostess told us it would be 15 minutes so we decided to wait. We waited about 20 minutes, and then were seated at a teeny  2 top table, sandwiched  between two other tables, all sharing a long booth bench seat. It was a little awkward so we asked to switch to another more secluded seat that was also empty.  We switched seats and waited about 5 minutes before the waitress came to get our drink order. She was alright, not very friendly or personable though. I ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and my hubby got Baja fish tacos after about 10 more minutes of waiting for her to take our order. The waitress came back a few seconds  later and told me they were ""out"" of the lettuce wraps. I looked for another few minutes for a second choice, and ordered a cashew chicken salad. We finally received our food, and the salad portion was enormous, and it was very tasty. My husband also enjoyed the fish tacos. The waitress disappeared again for awhile and when she finally came back I  asked to get  the ""warm apple crisp"" to go. She said it comes with ice cream on top so she didn't  think  that would  work because it would melt...we asked if she could put the ice cream in a separate container, and she said okay.  As we are waiting for our dessert, I look over at a table that was seated awhile after us, and the lady is eating thai lettuce wraps! The same lettuce wraps I was told they were ""out of"". Pretty annoying. Anyway, at this point I am just ready to get back to our hotel and enjoy the apple crisp. We get the to-go bag and head out...we get tho the hotel and I open up the box...and the ""warm"" apple crisp is completely cold. And not like it just cooled down the way from the restaurant...cold like it had simply been taken out of the fridge and tossed in a box. Very disappointing, and didn't  taste great. I was very disappointed with this dining experience, especially since it was my birthday. Would  not eat at that location again."
C. H.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,,2.0,3/21/2015,On Saturday evenings it's pure chaos at THE Cheesecake Factory. There are people standing around everywhere waiting to be seated. The hostesses apparently ran out of buzzers and are walking around SCREAMING the names of the parties. This is not a relaxing dining experience in the least. It used to be upscale. Now it is along the lines of Chili's. I do not recommend this particular location unless you like waiting indefinitely for a table and don't mind people walking around screaming while you eat.
Meredith C.,"Chicago, IL",234,248,121,3.0,10/17/2012,"cheesecake factory is good. the white bread makes me smile (when it's warm). the corn tamale cakes are TO DIE FOR.  they are simply divine.  NEVER look up their nutritional info. the service here was lovely.  i ate here twice over a 4 day period while in houston for a conference recently and both times my coworker and i were seated immediately and ironically at the same booth. the service was lovely - especially the second time (thanks, Marisa).   the drink refills were a plenty and the food was splendid. the following is not a compaint against this location, but rather corporate as a whole: (rolling up sleeves for rant):  you have a skinnilicious menu claiming lower cal options.  i am on ww.  i am thrilled with this option.  i find a mexican salad that sounds splendid and filling and eat 1/2 of it and think i can find the nutritional info online, but alas, it is not to be found...ANYWHERE.  CF - release the nutritional info of your freaking skinnilicious stuff.  c'mon - don't claim something is a better option for those of us who are counting watching every morsel that goes past our lips only to find out that we can't quanify it aftewards.  it's a dick move and one i'm tired of.  i boycotted corner bakery for years after they refused to publish their info and only went back when it was fully released.  i eat at cheesecake & grand luxe FREQUENTLY (twice a month) and am willing to go through with this threat if you don't change your evil ways and fess up. i am done. ps - love your cheesecake (when i'm not cranky and on weight watchers).  xoxo"
Beth K.,"Talladega, AL",113,30,,1.0,6/3/2014,"Is it possible to give 0 stars...service so beyond poor, drinks wrong how can you screw up a martini it's bartending 101 and gnats for days.....gross stay away"
Paris J.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,3.0,7/30/2015,"Food WAS great! Awesome Cheesecake.  It was a Dinner for 4... OverAll We had a Good Time. It Was Up Until The End, that left everybody in a bad mood. Our Waitress was named ARTISHA B. She was nice in the beginning, but toward the end our dinner, Missy had the audacity to TRY & make me pay her a bigger tip. Now I understand most waiters make their money off their tips, but to TRY to make the customer pay you an even bigger tip is ridiculous. Her whole ATTITUDE & demeanor changed....Shaking her head...& snatching the tip off the tip off the table in front of us.. Everyone looked around looking like REALLY.  The tip was more than $10 which we didn't EVEN have give..Tipping is OPTIONAL... I know it sounds petty BUT that was unacceptable behavior. I know so many people that don't even tip, but I do whether it's $5 or $15... I just feel as a customer that spent nearly $170+ altogether  on ONE meal at the Cheesecake Factory. That service of a waiter is absolutely HORRIBLE. Then she suggested she could break one of My $100 bills I had for her tip... After that I told my group it was time for us to go! Later on I called the Cheesecake Factory & made a complaint. I hope they took care of it, because to be honest that type of service is UNACCEPTABLE."
Christine L.,"Houston, TX",144,322,147,3.0,12/21/2010,"Been here a couple of times, years ago. This always seems to be the restaurant of choice when we go the Galleria so it was fine. Our wait was about 5 minutes, if that. And it was noon on the dot. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta. Penne pasta in a parmesan cream sauce with chicken breast strips. Spicy carb goodness. I was hungry but only ate a third of the lunch portion. I'd be scared to see the dinner portion.  We split a slice of the ultimate Red Velvet cheesecake and our waiter even sliced it in half and served us separately. Nicely done. Sustenance was able to keep us going with our shopping excursion."
Cody Z.,"Medical Center, Houston, TX",2,23,13,3.0,1/26/2014,"Went on a Saturday night around 815pm. Was told the wait for a party of 2 would be 30 minutes. Was not seated until an hour later! Got the fried cheese, crusted chicken Romano, and the Oreo cheesecake. The only thing that was good was the crusted chicken Romano."
Dennis W.,"La Porte, TX",94,36,45,3.0,11/2/2014,The food was decent. The restaurant was very noisy upstairs. The kids didn't care for the nachos appetizer because of all the sauces all over every chip and slightly burnt. My wife didn't like the calamari but I thought it was ok. The waitress did great but probably had too many tables because she was always rushing. I had the salmon. There was nothing special about it but still not in my top ten salmon meals. The bread was awesome.
Missy D.,"Calgary, Canada",103,341,1,3.0,5/22/2013,"Well I can't really comment on the cheesecake, as I can't eat it, nor do I want to. I love me some cheesecake on occasion in a small size with no graham crust. But a piece the size of my head is frankly a little gross.  I went with some co-workers, I had a basic salad, as they was all I was able to eat there. Again, I don't like places that have 10 page menus. I get you want to cater to everyone, but I prefer places that pick things they're good at and do it really well.  Customer service is great, as I found everywhere in Houston, which is much appreciated for sure."
Kristen A.,"Cypress, TX",3,10,,4.0,1/9/2015,"The food is amazing, but our service was incredibly slow. While our waiter was amicable and wanted to create small talk he took 15 minutes to bring our check after we indicated we were trying to leave in time to shop before the Galleria closes at 9 pm. He also took two of my drinks off of our table before I had finished 80% of it, acting anxious even though he forgot to bring me a set of utensils for nearly 10 minutes. I expect more receptive service at a restaurant where i easily drop $100 a night."
Antonio D.,"Manhattan, NY",33,65,,3.0,3/5/2013,"Food is what you have come to expect with CCF, However the interesting part is watching the Fist Fight between servers in the dining area near the elevator entrance. Dinner and a Fight = ***"
Rudy H.,"Houston, TX",23,46,,4.0,7/9/2013,"You know it's good granted I've only been once but when I did, I came in not too long before close, and the service was still great. Our waiter was nice and didnt try to hurry us out in any way."
Mike F.,"Houston, TX",61,274,75,5.0,10/12/2012,The manager Matt is awesome. My order was originally something else and he helped settle and correct what was wrong. I would go back just because of his professional customer service and willing to make the customer want to eat there again. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!
Stephanie M.,"Milton, FL",0,11,,4.0,1/31/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a must visit when you're in the area. The fried macaroni and cheese is the best! We usually get an appetizer and then split an entree because the portions are pretty big, and you'll want to save room for their amazing desserts! For chocolate lovers, try the Hershey bar cheesecake. If chocolate isn't your thing, the red velvet cheesecake is great!"
Debbie M.,"Cincinnati, OH",13,61,11,4.0,12/27/2012,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory, so it was no surprise that I would eventually have to try it in my new city, at my new favorite mall! We popped into TCF around 2pm on the Sunday before Christmas, after an exhausting day shopping and having pictures taken with Santa, for a yummy lunch.  My first reaction upon entering is that this restaurant is SMALL!  Wow, the one back in Cincinnati (which is also attached to a mall) is huge!   However, this one is two floors and so we were seated upstairs, overlooking the front of the Galleria/Westheimer Rd.   Our server was fabulous.  I wish I could remember her name. Shoulder length black hair, also works at the Hard Rock...anyway...we brought our 7 month old daughter and she was very good with her, engaging her when she came by for refills and such.  I always appreciate that. I went with the garlic noodles (I try something different almost every time I come, plus they took one of my faves - Crabcake Sandwich off the menu - bah!) It has sauteed asparagus, mushrooms and tomatoes in there.  Very good.  We capped off our meal with cheesecake of course.  I had their 30th Anniversary cheesecake, which had chocolate cake in there as well as cheesecake. It was delightful. I'm sure we will be back, you can't beat the service and the cheesecake!"
Chrissie O.,"Escondido, CA",251,807,857,3.0,1/26/2011,"Trip to Houston and I visit the cheesecake factory?!?!?! I wanted to resist but I came with a group of people who wanted to eat there.  Im always a fan of The Cheesecake Factory but I kinda wanted something I wouldn't get back home.  anyways, so the entrance is very small for a large number of people to wait to be seated.  The second floor had more room to stand but they told us to give our name downstairs for a table.  Very up close and personal with strangers walking through to get a pager or to be seated. 20-30 minutes later we were seated.  We sat at the tables near the bar.  I  always thought those were considered bar seats and would be open but that's where they sat us.  Very small space for 4 people.  Surprisingly all 4 plates fit but we did have to get rid of our small bread plates to make everything fit.   Our waitress was nice and friendly.  The food was good.  I normally get the same dish everytime I go there.  The fetuchini alfredo is very creamy.  If you like chicken then add it on."
Cuban C.,"Houston, TX",1,22,,2.0,1/14/2015,"Used to love Cheesecake Factory. My wife and I had the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club - the bread was butter soaked and the sandwich was soggy and greasy. Our waitress was obnoxious and greeted us by asking, ""you all ordered anything already?""... how could we, we had just arrived and been seated. She gave us all of 30 seconds to review the menu and kept insisting we order AND we had to beg her to refill sodas. The last straw came when we ordered a slice of Linda's Fudge Cake to go and to our horror discovered when getting home that it was  half a slice.... we were not happy. For $8 a slice, come on people.  We won't be going back there anytime soon again."
Noor-Hal C.,"Houston, TX",9,107,,4.0,10/28/2014,"I am a big fan of this place! Though one of the few things I dislike is that it gets too crowded! But the food is worth it! It is such a great place to have Sunday brunch, my suggestions are Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs, and the Factory Huevos Rancheros. I would love if the salsas were spicier but it's alright. There are tons of choices if you are not that hungry (for me the Beet Salad with Goat Cheese is a keeper!). Great place and afterwards you can stroll around The Galleria browsing or shopping."
