Seth B.,"Belfair, WA",28,12,16,3.0,10/23/2014,"Service was good, food was ok. Not what u was expecting for paying $15 a plate. It's about the experience because I could've gotten better food going to olive garden."
N T.,"Houston, TX",7,47,,4.0,8/31/2014,Tuna tataki appetizer! Nuf said. This is amazing and more of a meal than an appetizer.
Nabila H.,"Houston, TX",1,7,,1.0,10/20/2015,If you want to ruin your celebration this is the place to be. they kept us waiting for more than an hour. Once we were seated no server greeted or attended us for 30 mins. when we asked for water to a server he was making faces. we walked out in utter dissapointment. Manager was least interested in our complaints.
Rachel H.,"Houston, TX",81,62,83,5.0,2/15/2013,"I think I'd have to say that the Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant.  I love the bread they start you off with, and pretty much everything on their menu is wonderful!  I love their salads.  Last time I was there I had ""Sheila's Cashew Chicken Salad"" and the dressing was sweet and satisfying... and the memphis burger is SOOO good, if you're in the mood for something heavier.  And then there's the cheesecake....don't think I even need to go into details of how awesome the variety is that they offer.  Wonderful Menu! Love Love Love this place!"
Mohammed K.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",2,19,28,1.0,11/13/2015,"Well, I went there 2 times ..... and this might be only for this place specifically ... in both times .. we asked for appetizer, Main course and  the desert would be the cheese cake ..in both times .. the food was litrely HORRIBLE .. u can call it a CRIME, we thought that might he for a first time ... but for 2 times .. same HORRIBLE taste .. !!!! that is just a big shame for the name of this place ... the only awesome thing was the cake only AND ONLY .... I lived in more than 9 different counties overseas including Europe, Africa, and Asia .. so when I criticize a restaurant .. I know what I'm talking about ... the appetizer was SUPER grease ... the main course simply tasted like somebody was already ate it before us .... honest comment ... service was cool though ... but for food ... it was simply a nightmare ...I will try to go to a diff branch and hopefully tk see a better chef there ... I don't know if a those big places would read my view but hopefully they will .."
Keisha R.,"Houston, TX",17,40,18,1.0,2/21/2015,"Let me start off by saying that today was supposed to be a pleasant girls day out at The Cheesecake Factory. However, that all changed when we received ""service"" from a guy named CECIL. When we were first seated, the server bought out our drinks and some butter. He stated that the bread would be out shortly. Well ""shortly"" turned into 30 minutes! When we asked him about it, he stated that all the servers were in line to get bread and he wasn't able to get any. WTF! I found that hard to believe bc all of the servers around our table brought bread to their customers! So we didn't get any until we received our entrees. Next, I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and a peach Bellini. I guess ordering that was to much to ask bc I NEVER received my Bellini and when my food came out, it didn't include the onion rings. And to top it off, the burger came on a sourdough roll instead of a bun! The top of the bun was so crispy and burnt, there was no way I could eat it. I asked for a manager, however I did not want anything else from this establishment. I told them to take it all away. Come to find out, the server never put my drink order in AND never mentioned the onion rings. So if you ever receive service from this waiter....RUN!"
Latasha M.,"Houston, TX",71,11,,4.0,9/30/2012,"Aside from fighting through the weekend rainy day crowd to get into the restaurant and then waiting 15 minutes for a table, The Cheesecake Factory is the best place to go for a casual lunch date. The service was courteous and friendly (AND I KNOW they were irritated by my inability to make up my DARN mind!) As I sat there mulling over two wait three entrees, asking my waitress what she thinks, then my date what he thinks, then the table next to me what they think; She stood with a smile on her face and a pleasant gesture. Ahhhh she had the patience of Ghandi! When the food arrived(FINALLY,MY STOMACH WAS EATING ITSELF) it was an occular artistry capsulating my tastebuds right before I savagely attacked my plate until my stomach bellowed ENOUGH ALREADY!!  All in all, The Cheesecake Factory was delectable in almost all facets: Great service, warm atmosphere, and delicious food."
Justin K.,"Havre, MT",0,38,,1.0,3/17/2013,"Horrible service.  More than 10 minutes to get a drink... bread delivered over five minutes after my wife asked.  Once we received the bread we didn't get a knife to butter it.  When we asked the waiter for a knife he went back toward the kitchen spent a couple minutes back there and then picked one up at the bussing station on his way back.  When I approached the manager and informed him I was thanked and then we proceeded to PAY for Cheesecake at the counter.  Really?  I am a long time Cheesecake customer and know what kind of service to expect.  This was not it.  If I were a server there and had to pool my tips with the waiter I had I would be pissed. P.S.  When we were seated by the hostess she informed me how tired she was and what a long weekend/busy it's been.  I asked, ""Well isn't that good?""  She said, ""I guess for the company it is.""  I hope somebody who cares about the well being of Cheesecake reads this and makes some changes at this location.  Never had a problem at any other."
Juli T.,"Houston, TX",2,10,1,3.0,11/1/2014,"This location is seriously over crowded. Food is mediocre at best. Also, the  mixed drinks are 10 dollars a piece, and they are extremely watered down! However, the cheesecake.... Oh, the cheesecake! The red velvet cheesecake is stupendous! My advice? If you're looking for a fantastic dessert, go to CCF. If you're looking for great food, go elsewhere."
Amber S.,"San Marcos, TX",145,91,18,5.0,7/12/2014,"This place is soooo good. I love the fire roasted artichoke appetizer!!! It's wonderful! Of course they have so many wonderful cheesecakes to chose from! OMG! A sugar addicts nightmare! Lol! It is expensive, but you know that going in, so you are prepared. If not---read this so you can be prepared!!!! Lol!"
Christine P.,"Missouri City, TX",3,25,32,2.0,10/19/2015,"First time at this location, and most likely the last. Came on a weekday; it wasn't as packed as we seats upon arrival, yet the service the waiter performed made it seem like it was busy when it really wasn't. The waiter seemed uninterested and unenthusiastic about not only serving us, but just being at his job in general. He didn't offer to get us water or the complementary breads until we asked for them and showed up to our table to only take our orders and to give us the bill. I also found it rude when he showed us where the ""recommended tip"" on the bill was as if he was expecting us to tip the recommended amount for his poor service."
Jeffrey C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",579,1012,914,3.0,1/5/2010,"Inspired by Edgar V.'s review, I figure I'd get around to posting my review of The Cheesecake Factory. Here it is: ""Gigantor Menu. Delicious Cheesecake."" Then, despired (making up words, natch) by this recent thread talk ( ), I now need to add something more substantial. Here it is: Gigantor Menu. Seriously, anything you can think of. Way too much, in fact. They do pretty much everything decently but nothing spectacularly. Kind of like Brendan Fraser, the Philadelphia Eagles, or BIC pens. Problem is, everything is way too overpriced. But you knew this already, because everyone knows what goes down at the Cheesecake Factory. My personal go-to is the chicken marsala, which costs something like eleventy dollars (note: eleventy is not a real number but is in fact a placeholder for an actual overpriced value). Delicious Cheesecake. But you knew this already, because the place is called freakin' ""The. Cheesecake. Factory."" They've got pretty much any type of cheesecake combination you can dream of: something sweet + cream cheese filling + crust = yum. So if you can't find anything you like, or don't like cheesecake, well, that's just un-American. Wait, that may be apple pie. Forgive the mistake. Problem is, the slices are way too overpriced (are you sensing a trend here)? My personal go-to is the Vanilla Bean. Simple yet magically delicious. This also costs eleventy dollars (I think it's actually like $6.50. Still ridiculous.). You'll definitely end up going at some point in your life. Don't look at the prices. Just enjoy."
Michael T.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",3,1,,1.0,8/17/2014,Set down and the silverware had food caked on it.  The plates had food caked on it as well. Disgusting.
Brandi C.,"Vinton, LA",2,53,22,5.0,10/12/2014,Always my favorite place to eat while at the Galleria. Usually very busy/crowded but it is definitely worth the wait.
Erica G.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,3.0,11/23/2015,Food was good but I came to celebrate may baby's birthday and I asked for something that they said that they would do but they didn't u want this day to special in everything but it was not drinks had to be sent back for them to do it right I can go on and on but I will not
Erika V.,"Houston, TX",212,289,277,4.0,4/17/2012,Oh Cheesecake Factory you have more than recovered from your days of bad service... I love coming here with the kids early Sunday mornings before its gets crazy crowded.... I love their breakfasts!! However my favorite thing right now is the Thai chicken wraps than come with lettuce which are gluten free!! I can no longer eat cheesecake but I recall a day when I did and the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake is out of this world!!! Clearly this why they call this place the Cheesecake Factory :)
Liles I.,"Houston, TX",6,7,4,1.0,7/16/2014,"This is the worst experience I've had in a long time. We ordered wings just as a small meal after shopping, and our waiter came back with the wrong order after we had already waited for 45 minutes! We decided to leave instead of placing another order and waited a good 15 minutes just to get the check for our drinks. Don't come here."
Joey Q.,"Houston, TX",15,24,2,1.0,9/12/2011,"Looks like the new management is mucking things up... I've been going to CCF for years and I must say, I was very disappointed when a roach walked out of my salad and onto the dinner table.   I got up, told management and left.  No way I'll go back to CCF at the Galleria."
Amy H.,"Houston, TX",1,31,6,2.0,12/10/2013,"Had a gift card so we went to the Cheesecake Factory for a weeknight date night (and to avoid cooking).  I've been to Cheesecake several times and know the drill: huge menu, even bigger portions, decadent dishes, and a nice slice of cheesecake to finish the meal. Well,  I'm not sure if my expectations have risen since my previous visits (which isn't so bad) or if this visit was especially bad, but I was left unimpressed and underwhelmed.  The food was not up to par with past experiences- I always order the same creamy pasta dish, and if I'm going to waste my day's calories on it, it better be luscious.  Here it was bland, lacking sauce and flavor.  I almost wanted to ask for a cup of sauce on the side, but shouldn't the pasta be edible when served?  The cheesecake was unfortunately not great either; creamy and rich, but lacking strong flavor. The icing on the (cheese)cake?  Horrible, absolutely terrible service.  I tend to over-tip and only consider a few things to be deal breakers, but our waiter hit every one of them.  First, only refilled my water once.  When the cup is 3/4 ice, I appreciate being checked on so my glass isn't empty- we were barely checked on, and I had to flag down random servers for water.  Second, completely inattentive; only asked us how everything was as he was dropping off the food- obviously I don't know how it is, I haven't touched my plate yet!  The worst, though, a random server brought the check with the plated cheesecake.  What?!  The worst thing you can do for service is bring the check before the patrons are finished eating.  In other cultures, you have to specifically request the check (instead of it being brought over) for that reason.  There goes your tip, and I won't consider the Cheesecake Factory for future dining."
Jangar B.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,8/18/2015,The worst customer service the lady on the front counter is very rude and she treat people like slave she is so racist. This was my last time here highly not recommended
