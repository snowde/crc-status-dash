Rob S.,"Houston, TX",1070,5,2,1.0,9/26/2015,"If you like Mexican food do NOT and I repeat do NOT order anything Mexican off the Cheesecake factory menu. The tortillas they use are the ABSOLUTE WORST GENERIC brand tortillas ever made. Ive bought tortillas in a bag from HEB that are better tasting. I've had other food here that was pretty decent but this was the first time I've had Mexican food from Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the quesadillas to start and couldn't even believe the way they looked. You can go to 100 different small taquerias in the Houston area and get a much better quality quesadilla for a third of the price. The texture was like cardboard. I immediately sent it back. I ordered the Factory Burrito and took one bite and realized they used the exact same bottom of the barrel , 1 year old stale type tortilla! I again immediately sent it back again. The manager and waiter were nice enough to ask if I'd like anything else, but the 45 minute wait and  disgusting looking and tasting Mexican fare destroyed my appetite. I can not believe a place that charges such high prices for food with SIMPLE ingredients would use suck LOW QUALITY ingredients and smile when they serve you, to pay for it. Absolutely will never even walk into Cheese Cake factory again after such a HORRIBLE experience with the food. I will stick to local taquerias with BETTER TASTING, BETTER QUALITY, BETTER PRESENTED food than to pay triple the price for what essentiall amounted to BLAND , Poor quality tasting and looking  food. DONT ORDER MEXICAN FOOD FROM THE CHEESCAKE FACTORY!!"
Lynn H.,"Katy, TX",0,25,,4.0,6/15/2014,We received attentive service. Food was typical of other cheesecake factory locations and tasted great. Overall good choice if going with a lot of people and everyone has different food preferences -- since there is always something for everyone on their menu.
Greg M.,"Houston, TX",53,34,,4.0,9/27/2012,The Red Velvet Cheesecake is legit!!!!  huge menu for all tastes. I had fish and chips which was not a good choice. Average at best. Everyone else enjoyed the chow. Good place.
Cameron H.,"Houston, TX",160,348,,4.0,1/16/2014,"A lot better experience than the ones I remember from a few years ago... My friend and I went for lunch and started with the Ahi Tartar. Good, fresh tuna, avocado, ginger, and sesame seeds. Delicious and light! We moved on to our lunch. He got their Chicken Romano, which is like Chicken Parm. The helping of chicken was HUGE and, even while that was enough, they decided to also have a whole helping of spaghetti. My friend let me have some of each and I was definitely not disappointed by any means. The chicken was lightly breaded, but crispy, not greasy, and very flavorful. As for me, I got the Pan-Seared Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Veracruz with asparagus. Obviously, I was in a seafood mood. While the Mahi could have used a TAD bit more seasoning, the shrimp was some of the best I've had- very plump and juicy, a nice char, and it was freaking delicious! We ended the meal with 2 cheesecakes. I got the new s'mores cheesecake and he got some type of peanut butter one with Butterfinger and Reese's. Perfect end to the meal! And I only hated myself a little bit! ;-)"
Mary L.,"Alsip, IL",40,113,89,5.0,12/23/2014,"i ordered the quattro formaggio pasta & fried avocado as an appetizer, reached my expectation."
Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",809,74,1017,5.0,8/31/2011,"I recommend this place to hungry Houstonites, especially if their spending the day shopping in the Galleria. My views... *It appears to have rather squished seating, but there's actually a lot of space. There's table, booth & banquette seating. It's usually busy but don't let that scare you off. *Sure the menu seems endless (it's bounded like a book) but lots of options are sometimes nice - at least you know they have a little something for everybody. *I love that they have a ""Small Plates & Snacks"" section on their menu. These plates are like mini versions of their appetizers. This way, when you want more than one appetizer for the table, you don't have to pay $7.99 x3. *I've been here many times and have never hated my order. They always are featuring some sort of entree special. Also, their food portions are very generous so come hungry. FYI - I LOVE their avocado egg rolls! *The service is always very friendly, accommodating and timely. I feel sorry for the staff though - they all wear white and I always find myself thinking ""keeping those suckers clean must be death"".   *Pre-meal you're given sourdough bread and some kind of dark brown bread. I don't know what makes the brown bread so good, but slap some butter on it and try not to ruin your appetite! *I would say that their venue is fitting for large groups, date night, kids, etc. *If you don't plan on ordering cheesecake then consider yourself unauthorized to ever read any of my reviews ever again. *I HIGHLY recommend their Dulce de Leche caramel cheesecake (even though that out of the 7+ I've tried, they have all been delicious). I'm not a caramel fan so at first I was like ""eh"" but now it's my ultimate favorite! Also, you can give their cheesecakes as gifts...get them to-go to replenish your own fridge's needs...you can even purchase gift cards."
Carmen W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/7/2014,"I have been to many Cheesecake location and I have to say this is the worse. First, our table were missing knives and fork. Second, the tableware were not clean. Third, it was very slow on food (including the bread and butter).  The pasta was salty. The service was bad. I have to ask for the refill (water). I also need to ask for the plastic bags for my left over (the waiter only gave me the to go box). Overall, it was a bad experience. I do not recommend this location to anyone."
Jonathan R.,"Pearland, TX",76,62,44,1.0,7/16/2011,"If I could give a negative star I would. First off, the entire place smelled worse than an old locker room. Like sweat and bacteria and old fish. And everyone apparently seemed oblivious to it. It was about 82 degrees inside. However, despite this, the place was packed. The hostess was a total bitch and would not give us the booth of our request. We waited over 15 minutes for  a waitress. Our eventual  waitress showed up was sweating profusely. Drops were running down her face and were hitting the floor in front of us. Out of sheer disgust we decided to leave. We did not eat there. If you're thinking about going there, turn around and run the other way. You've been warned."
Alex W.,"Houston, TX",1,40,1,2.0,7/13/2015,Took someone visiting the US here for the first time while we were at the Galleria.  Menus were sticky.  Had to ask for water twice.  Bread was delivered mid meal after i had to flag down a mgr to get the dressing for my salad.  i didnt make a big deal about it in front of my guest but i was kind of embarassed.  Food was good.  Service was friendly but pretty mediocre at 3 in the afternoon.
David S.,"Spring, TX",37,33,6,5.0,3/24/2013,"The restaurant was packed as always, but were seated very promptly. Did not need to look at the menu, since I always get the same thing---Chicken Costolleta. It's 3 huge thin pieces of chicken Milanese with a lemon butter sauce, some grated lemon peel, garlic mashed potatoes, and about 6 pieces of asparagus. I always take about half of it home because it's definitely a huge portion.  I drank apple cider, love it! It's definitely cider and not just apple juice. Service was pretty good, you'd expect ordinary service at chain restaurants that are packed, but our server was very attentive.  The place tends to be a little loud, since tables are practically crammed together unless you are seating at a booth. I found the music to be unnecessary.  I would really have to say that is one of my favorite restaurants. The menu is HUGE. Their smoothies are delicious, the bread they bring to you before your food is to die for, along with the butter.  Will definitely keep returning. I like this location much better than the one in the Woodlands area."
Judith M.,"Houston, TX",3,1,,3.0,5/5/2014,Service is not as good as food and price. I've been there a few times and it is always busy. I have waited 20 min for a table. Sometimes waitress are too busy that they forget the order or the order is not right.
Herr M.,"Buda, TX",0,61,,2.0,8/27/2013,"Had a $8 BBQ hamburger that was just okay. I had Five Guys earlier and they tasted much better for $2 less.  Of course I had to try out one of their cheesecakes, since that was my whole reason for trying them out, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, very tasty, $7 piece tasty? Perhaps.  Go for their cheesecake not the other food is what I'll go by."
Claude K.,"Houston, TX",12,75,27,4.0,3/20/2010,"I ate here a couple hours ago, so I'll review this place while the experience is fresh in my mind- just for you guys. No need to thank me.  Ambiance: Extremely crowded and busy. It was difficult following our server through the small groups of people randomly located throughout the building. The decor of the restaurant itself? Beautiful. I loved the soft colors on the ceiling and the wooden columns. I thought it looked pretty classy, but that's just me. Food: Get their Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Even though I'm usually not into cream-based sauces, this one was killer. It was slightly spicy which cut through the richness of the dish. The asparagus and peas were especially nice, and the chicken was tender and juicy. Their Cajun Jambalaya Pasta was good, but nothing to write home about. I did like that it was lighter than the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pasta, but it wasn't as flavorful.  To be honest, I was expecting more from their Fresh Strawberry cheesecake. My friend told me it was amazing; I disagree. The cheesecake itself seemed like a plain Jane cheesecake. Plus, there was way too much whipped cream. Surprisingly, I liked the Apple Crisp better. The cold vanilla ice cream and the hot apple crisp played off each other in terms of temperature. The walnuts added a crunch factor to the slightly mushy and soft crisp. Yum. Portion size: It's big. My advice is to split an entree and dessert with a friend. Service: Our server was okay. She got the job done, which my friends and I appreciated. She delivered our food fast and smiled a lot, which is always nice. The wait time is 30 minutes on average.  My first visit over with and I'm already ready to head on back!"
Caitlin C.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,5.0,6/28/2014,"Service and atmosphere were great! Our waiter was very polite and consistent. The lemonades were a little on the sweet side, but everything else was delicious. We had crab and artichoke dip, it came with bread croissants, which was awesome together. Then steak medallions for me, I asked for medium rare and they gave me the perfect pink center. The trimmings on the plate were asparagus, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and sautéed tomatoes. My guest had a four cheese chicken & pasta dish, which he said was also very appetizing. It was a huge plate however, it could more than likely feed two. Then we had a slice of cheesecake for dessert, which of course, was amazing. The white chocolate, caramel and macadamia nut was the one we tried. It was awesome!!!"
David G.,"Palm Springs, CA",31,38,6,5.0,3/25/2011,"I'm kind of shocked by all the 1 and 2-star reviews. Steve and I had an absolutely perfect meal and experience, dining here for lunch. We started off getting the Asian Lettuce Wraps. We both thought they were the best lettuce wraps we've ever eaten. Delicious grilled chicken, thin cold noodles with black sesame seeds, shredded carrots, thinly sliced cucumbers, bean sprouts and three kinds of sauces. They were unbelievably delicious... and oh-so sticky. So I asked our server if they had wet-naps for our hands. She came back in a few minutes with a plate that was holding steaming hot fabric napkins with lemon slices. We were both very impressed. The appetizer and service were both 5-stars. Steve's entree was Louisiana Chicken and Pasta. Which consisted of bow-tie pasta, assorted peppers, mushrooms, parmesan-encrusted chicken in a creamy pepper sauce. Steve gave his pasta dish 4 out of 5-stars. My entree was a Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayo, homemade bun) served with sweet potato fries. Perfect sandwich. Perfect fries. Perfect 5-star rating. It's been a long time since we've both been so impressed with the service and food at a restaurant -- regardless of the fact that Cheesecake Factory is a chain. It really was one the best meals we've had in eons* *eons = one or two months at most ;-)"
Megan M.,"Houston, TX",84,35,3,4.0,3/12/2012,"Here's the deal: I go to school far from home and I'm here for spring break. Not to mention my sister, her boyfriend, and my mom all decided on CCF so we can talk and have a nice meal. We didn't mind that the service wasn't AWESOME because we had our alone time (which I know seems quite backward).  1. My mom LOVES and ordered the Da Vinci. The pasta came out HARD/crunchy and tasted BURNT. so the waiter took it back and came out soft but still burnt taste. the manager offered to pay for her dessert (kinda weird he didn't offer to pay for her pasta).  2. Even though the waiter wasn't giving us the time of day, our food & drinks were pretty much given in a timely and appealing manner. Our glasses kept being filled and when we needed something, we got it. Not the BEST service.  3. for 4 people: 4 waters, 2 alcoholic drinks, 4 meals, 4 cheesecakes = $114. THIS IS AN AWESOME PRICE!!!! not only did we take ALL 4 meals home, we took home the cheesecake. so we had lunch & dinner paid for.  Decent experience. We all LOVED our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you want to get pampered by a waiter though. I enjoy coming with friends/dates/family when we don't really want to be bothered with service."
Mike A.,"Houston, TX",0,22,10,2.0,3/29/2014,Food is what you would expect... Decent and maybe slightly over priced.  The waiter was very good and attentive.  I've been Herr before and have come back.  Unfortunately upon this visit we noticed several insects throughout the establishment.  First was the fruit flies.   Annoying? Yes.   Understandable to some degree?  Yes.  Houston area is notorious for fruit flies.  Though the other insects we noticed were of the cockroach variety.  It's hard to 'stomach' eating somewhere that you can see several cockroaches crawling around the booths and walls.  GROSS!  time to get some pest control guys!!!
Sonia C.,"Katy, TX",153,173,95,2.0,2/19/2011,"I usually love The Cheesecake Factory. This was the worst experience I've had at any of their locations.  Problem 1 - The hostess (young, attractive, long dark hair, slim) was RUDE. She walked up behind us and was extremely annoyed that we weren't moving quickly enough to get out of her way. I know they were busy, but a polite ""excuse me"" with a smile would have accomplished her goal. The slight shove paired with an irritated expression wasn't necessary. I watched her as she stormed through the restaurant upstairs and downstairs.  Problem 2 - Filthy bathroom.  When I say ""filthy,"" I mean unusable - like a porta-potty, an outhouse, or a redneck gas station. Two of the bathroom stalls were covered with diarrhea, and one toilet was in a state of overflow. No stall had any usable toilet paper, but the floors were covered with used toilet paper. There was no soap or paper towels. Obviously the customers behaved badly for the restrooms to reach that point, but it is the staff's responsibility to keep it from reaching this point.  Problem 3 - The macaroni and cheese that we ordered for the kids was undercooked to the point of being crunchy. Not al dente, CRUNCHY. Our French fries were terrible; they were cold and tasted old.  The Pros - The service was good. We liked the brown bread and the iced tea. The children's pizza was pretty good, and they liked it. Our mushroom sandwiches were good enough to order again. I enjoyed the Oreo cheesecake.  In summary, I'm not interested in going back to this location. We waited 45 minutes for a nasty hostess, a disgusting bathroom, and mediocre food. The one in Sugarland does a much better job, and I have high hopes for th new location at Memorial."
Ty J.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,3.0,6/3/2015,"I always love to eat at the ""Cheesecake Factory"", but this last time, they had gnats real bad and the 'service' was below average... What I do know, gnats usually come when a place is not thoroughly clean.. Hopefully they can get it together..."
Phi L.,"Houston, TX",190,102,167,5.0,8/17/2011,"I have NEVER eaten a meal at Cheesecake Factory. I have only gotten their cheesecakes and cakes. I personally think their regular food menu is really overpriced and the portions are way too big. I don't like boxing up leftovers and reheating them later on. But as for the desserts, oh my goodness, I have never been disappointed.  Flavors I've tried:  -oreo (childhood love) - it's like a cookies and cream flavored cheesecake -chocolate mousse (very very good for you chocoholics)  -reese's - big portion and super sweet! have a glass of water/milk ready, and be ready to share...but definitely not something you can have JUST one bite of. It's really rich in flavor (and probably sugar) -hershey's - celebrated its big debut last month. It's like the reese's if you like that one -kahlua coffee - slightly lighter hint of chocolate if you're a coffee/milk chocolate kind of person. less sweet than hershey's and lighter texture as well, kind of like a fluffy mousse -black out - I think this is the richest, darkest chocolate cake/dessert offered at the place. it sits on top of the rest of the cheesecakes and it TOWERS over your head! Very very big portion. I shared it with my boyfriend and we STILL wanted more after we killed it. Definitely my favorite"
