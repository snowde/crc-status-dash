Cj S.,"Denver, CO",58,19,1,1.0,2/13/2011,"I need to write more reviews.. so why not start it off with a bad one to get the juices flowing? Worst. Dining. Experience. Ever.  Main points before I rant? Good: There is food here. it comes out hot and their cheesecake is awesome. Bad: the cheesecake is the only thing you should come here for. Service sucks. OVERPRICED. I have been to 3 Cheesecake Factories: Sugar Land years ago when it opened (was okay), The Woodlands ( a couple years ago. did well for seating/serving our large party, but we had to sit outside in the cold with only some heaters working) aaaand this one. We put our name down at about 3:30, and finally sat down at 4. Never have I been to a restaurant so full during the slowest hours of the restaurant day. First off, it's pretty small as these places go. There's two stories and they way the seating is, it's not a favorable floor plan if the stairs are right in the middle. looks cool, but takes up a lot of space. The downstairs/main/valet entrance has no space for how many people have to wait. I guess you could stand around on the sidewalk if you had to. We always had to shift around when someone was passing by. The upstairs/mall entrance is a bit better, and there are more benches just outside to sit on, or you could line the long hallway. Our buzzer goes off, and the upstairs hostess informs us that we need to go the DOWNSTAIRS host stand to be seated. we do so. host informs us that table is being cleaned still... 10 minutes later and the table is JUST getting cleared off. Host sets places and we sit. Menu is huge - there is a huge poster outside the mall entrance of everything they serve. Quite daunting if you were as hungry as we were. Weird thing is, there were apparently 2 menus with no obvious labels of their differences until you saw one had more options (I think one was lunch and the other dinner) and one is full (every other page) of advertisements. 10 MORE minutes later and we finally get a waiter to take our drink & appetizer order and to request some bread. probably another 10 minutes until our drinks come, though he's standing around talking to one table while holding our and our neighboring table's drinks for a few minutes. Aren't you supposed to drop off all the drinks, and if one table is ready to order, say 'let me drop these off' and I'll come back? He was taking so long I was contemplating just getting up and taking our drinks off his tray since he was standing 5 feet away. So recap if you're still with me: we have been waiting about an hour for any food or drink.. still no bread and that's supposed to come with your drinks, or shortly thereafter. Our appetizer finally comes. spinach artichoke dip with little bowls of pico and sour cream. decent, nothing special or horrible. Still no bread, though he brings the couple beside us their bread. They were seated after us. Food comes - WITH the bread! We had specifically asked for it first because we were really hungry. okay, whatever, our food is here. One friend asks for ketchup. Waits well over 5 minutes for it, and our drinks have not been refilled this whole time. They're all half ice, and with the appetizer we've sucked them down already. Friend calls over manager to complain. We feel kinda bad but... this is really slow. Ridiculously so. Other friend seems to be enjoying her greek salad and avocado eggrolls. My chicken carbonara was underseasoned, and I had to pay an extra $2.50 for a measly chicken breast. The pasta was okay, but maybe I'm just getting too critical. In my opinion, DEFINITELY NOT worth what I paid, which was over $15. The dish shouldn't have cost more than maybe 12 total. So now the manager and the waiter have combined their efforts and it probably equaled to about 1 lackluster server. We finish and we had explained at the beginning of the meal that we wanted to split the dip 3 ways, and then the rest of the ticket billed to each person, respectively. He had to ask again. Took over 10 minutes to split it. We get the books back and he hadn't even run already peeved friend's card, and put the other friend's ticket with his card. Then we had to wait for him to do that... it's 5PM at this point. took this long without wine/dessert?! FINALLY we left. I vow to never return here for a meal. Maybe only if they ever get that Toblerone cheesecake again.. and I'll eat it at the bar to take it to go. Horrible - and not even on a busy night! And this was not an isolated incident.. the other 2 tables beside us had the same time-laden service as well. The first couple wanted to get dessert, but the waiter was taking so long they couldn't wait any longer and asked for their bill after they only had an appetizer. The other table was agreeing with us. And we wished the new couple who sat down before we left luck with a more expedited service. They were already growing restless and they didn't even have food yet. For a high dollar clientele between lunch and dinner service... this was simply AWFUL."
April O.,"Gainesville, FL",99,267,56,2.0,1/13/2011,"The meal was fine.  Service was actually excellent.  Unfortunately, we were joined at the end of the meal by a visitor of the brown, hard-shelled, six-legged variety.   We departed.  Quickly. (If you still want to eat here, I recommend the Georgia Peach Martini.)"
Jennifer P.,"Houston, TX",36,77,40,4.0,2/15/2014,"Happened to stop by on national cheesecake day. Who knew? We wanted to sit at a low table in the bar, but were allowed to. Seriously, let us sit where we want. We were famished from shopping, and this place was convenient. No happy hour? Annoying. The food portions were massive and it was delicious. It would have been a 5 star if they had happy hour & let us sit where we wanted."
Syed S.,"Houston, TX",89,28,1,5.0,3/11/2015,"i love this place and all the food i have tried from here were delicious, i love all the cheesecakes as well so give this place a try. a bit expensive but hey its that good"
Saint O.,"Houston, TX",29,128,17,5.0,2/21/2011,"Went here this past Saturday night for dessert, following a not so 5-star meal at Pico's Mex Mex.   First things first, we obviously wanted dessert, because when we arrived shortly after 9 p.m., there was a 30 minute wait.  We all know that a 30 minute wait for The Cheesecake Factory is fairly decent.  The upside is, if the wait is too too bad, you can always go shopping in the high end stores, encased inside The famous Galleria Mall, where this restaurant is located.   We were seated, and our waiter came right over.  I have nothing negative to say about him other than the fact that he told us  redundantly three times that he'd only worked there a year.  Guess people at the table, including myself uttered things that seemed different on the menu, to which he followed up with his, ""It's been the same since i've been here and i've been here for a year"" speech.  Giggles. Anyway, we all pretty much ordered cheesecakes.  I of course only order the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake.  I must say this is by far the best dessert/cheesecake on their menu.  It will cost you about $7.50, to which i thought it was closer to $10, and when i asked the waiter was he sure, he replied, ""for the year i've been working here it has always been this price"".  LOL.  Needless to say that aside from that, he was very attentive, polite, knowledgeable, and friendly to all 6 of us.  I ended up ordering my dessert to go, and didn't indulge until yesterday.  I can say that if you do not want an entire slice, you may be better off not ordering this here.  Barnes & Noble has the same slice, just a smaller version, and if you have a discount card, you can get it for less than $5.  Food for thought.  However, if you do want the size the 'Factory offers, then it's well worth every penny.   I also ordered the strawberry lemonade.  I have to say that they have the best lemonade i've ever had...hands down.  I do not agree with the whooping $4.50 price tag, it can easily go for $2.50, and you guys (managers if you're reading) will make just as much profit, if not more on it.  What the beep, i ordered it anyway.   All in all, you get what you pay for and this place is well worth it.  Indeed, The Cheesecake Factory will always be one of my top five places to dine."
Catherine P.,"Sugar Land, TX",40,147,30,3.0,10/22/2013,"I like the food at cheesecake and I always think its fun to go. But this location sucks just because its always crowded and there's always a long wait by the stairs where people are always walking through you. The service isnt great because its always so crowded and waiters are running all over the place. Our waiter came over to our table and instead of introducing himself and asking politely to take our drink orders, he just asked ""Are yall thirsty?"" Im pretty sure he was on something because he was pretty weird throughout the whole meal. The chicken madeira is my all time favorite dish and Pumpkin cheesecake is a must! they should make it a regular flavor!"
Vikki J.,"Houston, TX",73,78,397,3.0,8/14/2009,"After several stops at the Cheesecake Factory, my husband and I finally decided to go in and actually eat.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad considering how busy it was. I loved the bread especially the rye bread, it had a sweet flavor. I had the Philly Cheese steak w/fries and I must say the steak had the best flavor and it was huge!  My husband had a Penne paste dish and stated that it was very good.  We couldn't leave without having some cheesecake and got the strawberry cheesecake, it was delicious. Our waiter was very nice and my husband did comment that The Cheesecake Factory was not a place for a romantic meal, it was extremely cold and next to us sat a guy with two women and he talked non-stop and of course he knew everything. I can say overall our first visit was a pleasant one and I am sure that we will eat there again."
Don L.,"Winnie, TX",0,5,,2.0,5/16/2015,"The service by Brittany was great- very cheerful and trying to make the experience the best. The bar beer tap was not functioning!  I will say the food was mediocre at best, somewhat overlooked and a bit disappointing. Maybe a bad day for Cheesecake Factory!  Great job Brittany"
Andrew K.,"Houston, TX",34,33,5,2.0,11/29/2013,"Downgraded from 3/5 to 2/5, portions of food were served cold, and had clearly been waiting to be served to us for some time. I know it's busy and you can only do the best you can, but certain minimums should still be upheld. On a positive note, the app was amazing. We will probably be coming back, for convenience and location if nothing else."
Jim R.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",16,82,92,5.0,1/29/2014,Good good and great service. Love the Chicken piccata. I have never had a bad meal at a CCF and this place continues the run. I would eat here again.
Jaire Q.,"Houston, TX",588,1104,1138,3.0,12/21/2008,"I've never been too impressed with the Cheesecake factory.  There is nothing there that you cant find (better of) somewhere else. I am referring to Service, Ambience and the Food. The things I do like about this restaurant :  The location, as it is less than a mile away from my aparment. Also, the restaurant is very well decorated and looks nice. The view from some booths is great, you get to see the nice lights across the street during Christmas time (other seating options really suck). Other than that, the food is not bad, and it is better than many places I've visited in houston... but still it lacks something. I say go try it, and see for yourself, but dont expect  too much in the service department."
Kimberly W.,"Houston, TX",15,59,,4.0,10/10/2013,"With soo many options, this place has the best cheesecake ever... You are sure to find one that you live... From a food perspective - if you want good comfort (fattening) food this is the spot... Healthy food options are super limited here..."
Kylie S.,"Chicago, IL",25,272,51,4.0,9/15/2011,"Fairly standard Cheesecake Factory, not as fancy decor as some of the others I have been in (such as Chicago).  It's attached to the Galleria so a good lunch spot on a busy shopping day.  My favorite thing to do is stop in for dessert with my girlfriends.  Terrible for your body, but good for the soul.   Plan to wait to be seated if you're here on the weekend.  Even outside holiday shopping it's busy.  Parking at the Galleria can be a pain so come prepared to hunt for a spot."
Rachel S.,"Houston, TX",19,50,2,1.0,6/9/2013,"I had always liked cheesecake factory so much that I decided to have my friends and families there on my wedding day. However they DON'T take reservations on weekends, even though we told the manager that we were getting married on that day and wanted to celebrate afterwards, they WON'T make an exception. Think about what can you lose for taking reservation? Just get the tables booked and you can always cancel it if people don't get there on time. I think the cheesecake factory just is too popular so they don't care about a $1000 and 18% tips. And this made me really disappointed that I couldn't celebrate for my wedding in my once favorite restaurant!"
Frank S.,"Houston, TX",1,198,162,2.0,10/1/2013,"Went in on a Sunday.  I tried this place again and wasn't impressed the first time and wasn't impressed this time.  I had the Louisiana Pasta and it was ok, borderline bland.  They give you a lot of food, but you pay for every bit of it.  I ordered the carrot cake, but shouldn't have.  I thought that they would have good carrot cake but I was definitely wrong.  My server was also horrible.  I asked him about a few items on the menu and he couldn't explain three of them.  He simply read off the menu after I had to tell him what page to reference!  Wow, it was my second time and probably my last time!"
Andres I.,"Galleria/Uptown, Houston, TX",6,3,,1.0,2/10/2014,"They are consistent in the food but today I had the worst dinning experience in my life. To start I got there at 6,30 and I needed a table for 16. I understand that it is difficult to get but I was told that the wait time was 45 min. After 2 hours we had to split tables and they ended giving us 2 tables. We sit down and after ordering they brought 3 of the 4 plates. The last plate arrived 15 min later. Needles to say that the rest of the food was cold by then. I've been reading a lot of reviews about slow service and I will hope that by now they would be doing some changes. Again, I am extremely mad with what happened today."
Maria H.,"Saint Louis, MO",44,99,36,3.0,12/21/2010,"This place has almost everything from Fish and Chips to Spicy Chicken Samosas. It's a great spot to take a big diverse group of people. Although it takes 30 minutes and a few Cliff notes to finish reading their large menu, they have a good selection to please those picky eaters.  A big group of us ladies decided to convene here for a pre-Free Hugs brunch. Getting a large table is quite a wait but the place was bustling with Miss Teen Americas, chic international socialites and last minute Christmas shoppers. I think we waited about 45 minutes. It was worth the wait because our server was very attentive and made no hassle about doing split checks for us. We had a nice little table on the side of the stairs so despite the hustle and bustle surrounding us, we were quite relaxed.  Everyone seemed pleased with their food. I had the sweet corn fritters and the avocado egg rolls. The corn fritters were sweet and fluffy. They tasted like something you'd get at a carnival and I love carnival food :) The avocado egg rolls were spicy and PACKED with avocado, onions, peppers and spices. I tasted a bit of my friend's Chipotle Pasta and it was delicious! Smoky, spicy goodness. They have generous portions here so if you're not starving I'd order an appetizer, snack or lunch portion. The regular portions are enough to gorge yourself and still have some to take for lunch the next day.  I always love the grandiose, over the top décor of the Cheesecake Factory. This place isn't unique or quaint but it's great for a big mix of people to take a break from shopping while at the Galleria."
Anando S.,"Manhattan, NY",33,152,,4.0,11/9/2013,"Had their chicken Madeira today and it was fantastic. The Madeira sauce and the mashed potatoes are a great combination. Also the breads they serve before the main course (they're on the house), especially the multigrained one are delicious."
Roni B.,"Euless, TX",337,552,242,4.0,5/23/2013,i don't think you can really go wrong @ the cheesecake factory!! food...great service...friends!! oh yea & we saw kirko bangz...not bad!!
Yoyo P.,"Houston, TX",4,66,19,3.0,10/27/2013,Came on Sunday early evening around 545pm for dinner. A quick 5-minute wait for seating. 4 adults and 3 children mean 7-top. Not 6! Fortunately our kids are 5 and 7 so we can hang in a 6-top table. I had to ask 3 wait staff for additional napkin and silverware as well as bread. I had the chicken and steak combo for 19.95. The portion is smaller compare to other dishes. Steak is tender and juicy. Chicken is flavorful because of the cheese topping. Kid's meals are big for our 5 year olds. Pumpkin and pecan cheese cake is very delicious.  It is somewhat overrated at this place because all the tourists and out of towners.
