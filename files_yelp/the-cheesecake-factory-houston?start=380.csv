Cindy H.,"Houston, TX",47,114,316,2.0,7/7/2011,"Service- HORRIBLE. our waitress didnt seem like she wanted to be there or to serve us. she brought out one basket of bread for a table of 6, and then took away everything. Slow on re-fills, and never came around to check on what we needed.  Food- The food was average. Not bad, but nothing great that would make us want to come back. We were all hungry after waiting 20 mins just for a table and then another 20 mins for food. Probably not coming back any time soon."
Maritza R.,"Rosharon, TX",2,15,,5.0,6/26/2013,I went there with a friend on a Sunday to try their breakfast/brunch. The wait for a table was just a few minutes even though they were pretty busy. I had their coffee which was very good I am a fan of a strong cup of coffee and they did not disappoint. I order pancakes eggs and bacon while my friend tried their steak & eggs. Both were delicious I don't what kind of syrup they have but it was one of the best. The pancakes were fluffy thick but not doughy like what you get at IHOP or Denny's.The steak was tender juicy and very well seasoned. Their portions are huge too much food for one person for sure. I had to take my left over pancakes & eggs home. I will be coming back soon.
Erin M.,"Houston, TX",41,88,36,2.0,7/17/2013,"Not the nicest waiter, their food has more calories than should be legal to note!  It's just a big commercial eatery with massive portions that are hit and miss"
Esmeralda B.,"Houston, TX",57,126,210,5.0,11/15/2012,"Came here for sunday brunch with this nerd i know. I have to say i was lovin' it :) I got some hot tea which was excellent. I ordered lemon ricotta pancakes. They were like wtf good! I really liked them. The service was great, my only complaint was that the bathrooms were downstairs, and i was upstairs, and i am lazy so going downstairs to pee pee is no bueno :("
Tony M.,"Houston, TX",113,9,,2.0,12/27/2010,"When we were younger, we used to frequent The Cheesecake Factory a lot for formal events and such. So after a hectic day of post-Christmas shopping, my fiance and I decided to stop by and have dinner there... I wish we hadn't. First, we waited to be acknowledged by the seating person. I don't appreciate being ignored. He did seat us immediately though but it was on a tiny table by the bar and kitchen without asking us our preference.  Second, we had a nice young girl as our waitress and there were no problems with the service except she forgot to bring us bread to munch on while we waited for our drinks / appetizers. My margarita was ok but she really liked the flavored mojito. The crab appetizer was good but small in portion and unfortunately, my entree was not good at all. I ordered the pasta carbonera and it was overcooked and over salted.  Towards the end of the evening we felt a little rushed to leave as the waitress kept walking by and looking at the check we hadn't taken care of yet but overall it was an alright evening. I would recommend that people sit upstairs though."
Kristin H.,"Houston, TX",348,207,103,4.0,10/11/2010,"This place is definitely hit or miss. For the most part, I'd say miss. I fell in love with the fish tacos there. I must say that the first time I tried them, I thought they were amazing! Buuuuut... the second time I order them, it looked like the entree was cooked about 30 minutes ahead of time and then left under heat lamps. My beans were a dried and caked up lump and that was my big hint.  I am the type to let that kind of stuff go, however, because having cooked for large quanitities of people, I understand the stress of the kitchen. The food was still okay. The orange chicken on the other hand... My gums were tender at the time and that chicken was fried hard. Eating it hurt. It also looked like they drizzled sauce on as an after thought. Still, I give this place 4 stars because the cheesecake is always spot on and amazing. I like to go with a girlfriend and split an entree and dessert. That way, the both of us don't have to feel guilty about indulging... and hey! They give you huge portions you can't finish on your own anyway!!"
Julie C.,"Houston, TX",24,76,38,5.0,6/28/2013,"Great time as always with good friend and food.  I have to remember not fill up on the bread.  Since I didn't finish my meal, but I did finish my drink which I had the pomegranate mojito, and dessert yummy apple strudel cheesecake.  My dinner wasn't bad to which i had s shepherd pie.  Delish, my friend had the miso salmon the first time and she was really surprised how good it was.    Next time not to fill up on the bread, but  its so good."
Jenn P.,"Houston, TX",0,6,,4.0,2/25/2014,Cheesecake Factory is always DELICIOUS. I just wanted to complimrnt thid.location on the fact they they DO NOT skimp on the alcohol lol I went to the Memorial location and I literally thought I was drinking mint lemonade.
John S.,"Dallas, TX",85,185,16,4.0,6/20/2013,"Crappy service turned into fantastic service. 10 minutes elapsed without any server introducing themselves so I mentioned that to the hostess. 3 minutes later, 3 different people started to serve us, which made me felt bad. Anyhow, food was great and service was great. Still a fan."
Alexander T.,"Houston, TX",70,523,207,3.0,2/3/2011,"Good place to celebrate birthdays, however their 'birthday sundae' is possibly the most disappointing birthday perk I have seen in my entire life. Get the Hibachi Steak Medium Rare, by far the best thing on the menu for meat lovers. Includes a side of wasabi mashed potatoes!"
Diana D.,"Dallas, TX",413,693,344,5.0,12/26/2010,"consistently good food. had the louisiana chicken pasta, again! always delish. tried the jambalaya and cajun chicken. very yummy! it was a louisiana kinda day. ordered the 10-inch white chocolate macadamia nut and dulce de leche cheesecakes split half way for $50. really expensive to the wallet and to the waistline. i cannot eat like this ever again."
Shoby A.,"Houston, TX",1,50,,1.0,10/22/2015,NEGATIVE. From the get go the hostess was rude but we let it slide. She told us we would have to wait and hour and a half for our table since we had 8 people. Fine no problem. But after that we see them seating people and parties of 5s and 6s and ok makes sense they can fit on a booth. But then we see them seating a party of 7 and I was like what? Especially cause they came way after us. So we spoke to the hostess and she said ok they're setting it up. Then 15 min go by and we asked another server and she was like well we are waiting for a party to leave so you can have that table. So that got me really upset cause seemed like they were giving us random answers. So I asked for the manager and he said oh yeah they say different things because it's just up to them how to pass the message about your table. That doesn't make sense what kind of training are they getting that they don't know how to tell people that your table isn't ready. Anyways finally get seated but one of my friends noticed that the hostess tells our server something. Then 15 min go by and the server tells us that I'll be right with you twice but doesn't come to us or ask us for water. Then he's like I'll be right back and my wife was like can we at least get some water right now cause we have been waiting for so long. And he walks away making a nasty face at us. Wish I would have gotten his name I want corporate to really check this location out cause I've read other reviews on here about the service here. Manager on the way out was kinda polite but we were done with this location. On top of that it was my twin cousin's bday. Any ways we called Kona Grill and they were so nice they took us. Can't believe we wasted so much time there.
CHEN C.,"Houston, TX",154,5,,1.0,1/18/2016,if i could then i would  give a zero rating to this restaurant... i went there yesterday around 1.30 with my wife and son to eat for a 1st time there the hostess was extremely rude to us.. just the way she talked to us was totally not friendly and was very rude...no sense of customer service..management weren't able to handle the situation with customers complain...good food thu but would i recommend anyone to go to this place? oh hell no not till they change their staff ...honestly the worst restaurant that ive visited in the past 3 years in houston ...
Todd S.,"Houston, TX",30,170,14,2.0,3/4/2012,"I've always felt like cattle when grazing, here.  There's usually a wait (?!?) for a table and then a wait for the farmer (aka, ""server"") to fill the feed trough with glorified fast food.  I cannot understand how/why people like this place.  This is boring, pre-fab food delivered to you by the same pre-fab staff you'll find at Chilis/etc.  It happens to cost a little bit more than the other McRestaurants... somewhat inexplicably."
Maria R.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,5.0,12/14/2014,Waitress was awesome and food good!! Awesome how its part of the galleria.  I love the steak diane with the salmon. Prices are pretty good as well! Will be back for more when in the area.
Edgar V.,"Houston, TX",297,406,292,2.0,12/29/2009,"Cribbing some of David N's review, this place seemed to be a suitable choice for our annual company holiday lunch for 40 persons on a Friday.    We arrived at the opening time of 11 AM and things started out with us scattered throughout the first floor dining room - hardly conducive to the presentation part of the program.  This flaw was more pronounced as other lunchtime gangs arrived and added to the din of the kitchen, plate clearing, and general circus-like activity.  Needless to say, the range of those who actually heard the speeches was limited to the front 3 tables.  On second thought, perhaps those farther out would consider this ""cone of silence"" a good thing.  We'll call it a wash.* The meal itself was comprised of a carte d'hotel of an appetizer and entree, all presented on the most classic of classy presentations:  the fuzzy black-and-white bad copier sheet.  Dessert was off of the regular menu of about 3,000 iterations of cheesecake.  To her credit, our server (playing zone defense) was earning her pay by whipping out plates of calamari, onion rings, and spinach-and-artichoke dip between rounds of refills for the drinks.  I watched as her colleagues were a little more unenthusiastic about the pace. For my entree, I opted for the Navajo Chicken sandwich:  a fried bread stuffed with chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, celery, and some mayo derivative, which made the whole thing a colossal mess to eat.  I couldn't figure out where the ""Navajo"" part came into play - did they fry their bread?  Is mayo an indigenous food item for these noble folk? I had to unload some of the tomatoes and lettuce to expunge some of the offending mayo melange so I could eat some of this native goodness.  To sum, it was ""all right"". Splitting a dessert selection with my neighbor, we chose the banana cheesecake with fresh banana slices and whipped cream.  The cheesecake was forgettable and generically flavored - the fresh bananas were the most exciting part and ended up being fought over by me and my co-worker.  Make of that what you will. I can only surmise that convenience brings the masses here since the food is middling and the prices a bit steep for the value.  For the most part, the servers must have been court-ordered to repay society by working here since they seem devoid of cheer.  If you can do it, save your cash and sanity by going off of the ""reservation"" and eat elsewhere. * We can all be thankful that no rat fell from the ceiling during our visit like it did during Ako's trip here.  See her review for details.  I just wish we had read it before booking our trip here.  2.5 stars."
Sara I.,"Sugar Land, TX",220,240,475,4.0,4/30/2010,"I love how there is an upstairs to this location! The place is nicely laid out. I tried the chocolate cake at this spot. The waitress was very nice. I asked if she could warm the cake, because I like my chocolate cakes slightly warm. Mm, mm good! She was pleased to do so. These cute French guys were sitting at the tables across us.This location has an international group of people dining in. Many of the shoppers from the Galleria situate themselves comfortably here. Check it out, I`m sure you will love the environment, as well was the food."
Cara S.,"San Francisco, CA",215,233,135,5.0,8/3/2010,"I've never had a bad experience here. Everything, from the pizza to sandwiches to burgers to pasta, is amazing. The service is top-notch. I have a hard time saving room for cheesecake, but that's where to-go boxes come in handy! They also have great specialty drinks. They do not take reservations, but they are still great for special occasions. I had a lunch here with family after my college graduation, and we were able to get a table together without any problems.  The Verdict: Great food, drinks, and cheesecake. Something for everyone."
Hungry L.,"Houston, TX",5,49,1,4.0,3/12/2010,"Who moans about eleventy dollars when they go out to eat?  Do you realize what you're paying for? Of course it's not going to be the same price as a local place, they don't have to cover the cost of huge real estate in the middle of one of the freaking highest cost areas of Houston.  If this is expensive, is Olive Garden expensive as well? The prices are not that far off.  When is yelp going to implement a  ""useless"" button? I took away one star for the service here. There is one waiter here who always looks like he's ready to kill  anyone who gets in his way (you know who you are, the dude who looks like if he smiles his face would crack). Most of the time though, service is slow simply because they are always so busy.  Other than that, the food here is pretty consistent, their pasta dishes always satisfy me. If you're going to complain about price, consider what about this place screams ""cheap and affordable"" to you?   People who complain about cost when the freaking prices are posted outside in a giant billboard of a menu = make up your own conclusion.  Fact is, you have a right to what you think is ""reasonable"", but if you feel it's overpriced and STILL go in, why complain?"
Johnny-On-The-Spot ..,"Houston, TX",88,17,521,2.0,1/21/2013,"Pretty consistent with other locations across the US, which I guess is a good thing because you always know what to expect. That being said though, the restaurant as a whole - including the menu, food, decor, etc - is slightly underwhelming. Neither good, bad, expensive, or cheap, the cheesecake factory falls somewhere in the middle of the fairway. It's one of those places that I'll never remember when I'm thinking of where to eat, but if someone suggests it, I'll probably be open to it."
