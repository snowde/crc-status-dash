Kat R.,"Houston, TX",22,289,37,2.0,6/5/2017,"Minus points because the lighting is very dim, you can barely read the menu. Got their at 11:30 and it wasn't busy, however my salad took 30 minutes. The waiter asked if I wanted bread instead of just bringing it out as most locations do. I was brought a refill of iced tea with no ice? This is our second time at this location and I wasn't too impressed. My salad had chicken in it which was located on the bottom of the salad. I had 10 small pieces the size of a nickel laying underneath 3 inches of salad. I love the Cheesecake Factory just not this location"
Esty L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",39,11,,1.0,9/19/2017,"This place has the worst servers in town.  At least at the time we walked in. The host walked us around the  whole freakin floor and 5 different servers male and females told the host to sit us somewhere else. They don't want us. In front of us and everyone else sitting. I thought they were playing a prank. Worst lunch experience I've had in years. Told the manager,  she didn't care. Probably used to it. Whataburger has better service."
Desiare D.,"Houston, TX",69,60,77,4.0,7/23/2017,"I had to check in twice because I wanted to amend my comment about the customer service, our service was James, we had a large party of 11 people and he was amazing at keeping it all together and always had a smile. This is not my usual location as I go to Cheesecake Factory often but it was a good experience all in all."
Karen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,127,157,3.0,11/3/2016,"For my first time coming to the Cheesecake Factory, I had pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, I was a bit let down by my experience here. For starters, the wait time to get seated was about 20 minutes, and between getting seated and receiving our food, we probably waited another hour, which wasn't ideal. Moreover, the Tomato Basil Pasta I had was pretty disappointing. It came with grilled chicken and mozzarella, but in very small pieces and quantity. Instead of pairing with the pasta, I felt that the chicken and mozzarella pieces were drowning in a sea of bland penne and diced tomatoes. Again, the portion size was absolutely massive (I barely ate half of the dish), but bigger is not better if the flavour isn't there.  Luckily, their strawberry cheesecake saved the day! It was creamy, rich, and as delicious as I imagined it would be. The strawberries and whipped cream on top complemented it really well and made for a decadent dessert. If dinners had MVPs, this would be it.  In all honesty, I probably won't be coming back here again for their entrees. However, their cheesecake is pretty amazing and I'll be stopping by a Cheesecake Factory for dessert whenever I get the craving!"
Carol C.,"The Woodlands, TX",152,432,4582,3.0,3/28/2016,"Food was 4-5 star. Service 2 star (being nice to server). My friend and I decided to meet up here for dinner in Houston.  It was during the work week and I arrived at 7pm.  The restaurant was about 1/3 full.  Upon arriving the pleasant male host seated me in a nice booth and got my server.  I ordered the complimentary bread with lots of butter.   My friend arrived by 7:15 which at that time she also asked for pumpernickel or the brown bread.  We ordered our drinks and my fave fried avocado egg rolls as an app with an unique Asian flavored dipping sauce 4.5 star. We asked several times to 3 people at least about our bread.  It finally arrived 1 hour later at 8pm, after I first ordered it from our server.  Freakin 1 hour!!!  Is there a bread shortage in this restaurant or did our server want a smaller tip?? We wanted to sit, talk and catch up but it would of been nice to have some food!   I ordered my fave Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with white rice.  It's like an Asian fusion entree complimented with coconut, crumbled peanuts, green onions and an Asian peanut sauce...5 stars! My friend ordered the American hamburger and fries and would order it again so I guess 4 stars for that entree.   I got a slice of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake to go also...4.5 star.   They had 2 large cases of cheesecakes of all different kinds from basic to very unique.  They also had about 3 10"" tall cakes if you wanted a large slice of cake. The menu is still large with so many apps and entrees to please just about everyone.  If you need to charge your phone there is no plug available in the bar area.  There was one available on our floor in another area but you would need at least a 4 ft extension cord.  Just FYI.   We had to wait to pay also.  It started getting real annoying because it was going on 3 hours.  Whenever I go to a Cheesecake Factory the food has always been real good but the servers are almost always slow or disorganized. Parking is free underneath.   Yelp Review #361"
Curtistine P.,"Houston, TX",24,15,2,3.0,8/1/2017,"Always a good dependable place to eat. The food is not superb but good and solid. Now the CHEESECAKE is SUPERB! I try a new flavor often - my faves are Lemon Meringue, Key Lime, The Original, and Salted Caramel....also get a great cappuccino with it! Those are so delicious, too!"
Donna N.,"Crosby, TX",217,447,189,4.0,4/27/2017,"I met a friend here for lunch on Good Friday and it was not too crowded.  We were seated upstairs and our server was nice and efficient.  I ordered a tomato basil flatbread pizza and crab balls and my food was quite delicious.  My friend ordered a salad that was no longer on the menu, but the staff went out of their way to make it for her which was really nice.  Parking was difficult as it is the Galleria, but I will return if someone else drives as the parking is too much for me to handle."
Mark W.,"Seattle, WA",25,22,2,1.0,10/3/2017,"Man, I hate to write this review. I normally like Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one in Downtown Seattle dozens of times and had almost all good things to say but not here. Not Houston. I arrived around 9pm on a slow weekday and there was no one working the desk. I stood there for 5 minutes and not one employee came to seat me. Finally tired of waiting, I sat at the bar. The bartender deserves a 3 star on her own, and she did just enough to get what I needed but didn't or maybe couldn't do anything more. The food is where the worst disappointment was which is sad because if the food had been good, I still would have given a 4 star. Chicken and Biscuits. The biscuits were harder than Thor's hammer, and just as tasty while the chicken was bland (at least it was juicy and hot). The gravy was the worst though, it had the texture of oatmeal that had been overcooked and sitting under a heat lamp all day and had almost no flavor whatsoever.  I may have to look elsewhere on my travels when eating out. Sad times."
Rob V.,"San Francisco, CA",91,16,18,4.0,5/4/2017,"I went here for dinner last night while in town on business. Standard Cheesecake Factory experience.  I was quickly seated, the hostess was constantly refilling my water, and the spicy cashew chicken that I ordered was good. No issues with this venue at all."
Garth V.,"Houston, TX",7,310,2,1.0,8/16/2017,"Reverse Racism I toyed with not writing this review but decided to do so...it needs to be posted. We were staying at The Westin in The Galleria. and wanted a nice dinner. Decided to go down to The Cheesecake Factory. We are an adult white couple, (its ashamed that in 2017 people EVEN need to add their race to a review but its an intricate part) The hostess was African American and as we stood at the hostess stand and she finally finished her conversation about her weekend she acknowledged us. No nice greeting no ""How are you""? Just ""How many..?"" We said two and she grabs menus and begins to walk away...we assume we need to follow her and we do. She sets the menus down on the table and walks away, LOL Whatever. As we sat there we noticed two other African American couples and one family get seated by us. We have still not even been greeted by a waiter. I see an AA young man (waiter) go to both the other AA tables and with some very nice banter he took their drink orders. Not ours...we sat and sat and he returned with there drinks and then took both there food orders! As he walked by I asked him if he could please get our waiter, he said ""Ill be right with you.""  After 7 more minutes he walks up to us and no smile, no nice greeting like the other received just say...""want can I get you"". \I asked him are you our waiter or just taking the table because the correct waiter disappeared?? He said I am...LOL We said we haven't decided on food...he walked off and we left and will NEVER return.  Yeah...racism works both ways people!!"
Hasan H. B.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,2.0,12/12/2017,"Over the years I've grown quite fond of this chain and its abundance of menu items to please most palates. With that being said this location really let me down. Sloppy, greasy, inaccurate representation of menu item, unclean table, and stomach problems well into the next day. I can't see myself eating here again honestly. On a positive note my waitress was nice and on point."
Brittany M.,"Houston, TX",285,136,313,4.0,8/27/2016,"This place is always our ""go to"" when we aren't sure what we are in the mood for. You can literally get almost every type of cuisine at one restaurant.  I've tried several items off the menu, but some of my favorites include the fried calamari, buffalo blasts and cheesecakes! I am seriously addicted to their Oreo cheesecake. Quite frankly, it might be my most eaten dessert of all time (sshhhhhh ) The pizzas are a hit or miss... Sometimes they are on point and sometimes you are left with a soggy, sodium filled glob of dough. The salads are always a good choice as well."
Delishea D.,"Houston, TX",10,83,10,5.0,4/25/2017,"I revisited this location on 4/13/17 and....THEY GOT IT RIGHT!   It was a Thursday night and a bit crowded but my son and I were seated promptly in Rebecca M.'s section.  She immediately came to take our drink order.  When she came back we asked her about any new menu items to help is order.  She answered all of our questions, she was really on her A game.  Our appetizer and entrees came out at the appropriate times and she checked on us our entire time there and refilled our drinks WITHOUT us having to ask!  I rarely get the same server at CF but I will request her when we go back.  I pulled the manager to the side on our way to let him know how well we were treated and he said he said that he was pleased to hear that Rebecca did a great job.  Oh yea, and the food was good too, although I don't even feel like I have to mention that because the food is ALWAYS good."
LaTiesha A.,"Houston, TX",167,16,11,1.0,3/25/2017,"Ordered a hickory bbq burger I asked for it well done cut it open and it's just as pink as it want to be! They had to take it bk and waited for more than 15 min, my fries got cold bc she didn't take it bk with the burger. The other people at the table finished their food and still haven't received mine. Not happy at all"
J Wade H.,"Tahoka, TX",3,90,14,2.0,3/15/2017,"We came here for cheesecake, but decided to have a meal as well. We didn't have to wait long, which was an initial surprise. Once seated, we waited for about 10 minutes before member of the wait staff recognized that we were there. She said that she was over booked in our section about would be back by to get our drink orders. It was at that point, that I realized our service would suck... and it did. Not because of the waitress, but because the hostess sat too many tables in her section. Food was mediocre. But let's be honest, no one comes here for their food... Its all about the cheesecake. We went with the red velvet, to-go. It was good, but could have been better."
Maria W.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",99,13,3,1.0,3/12/2017,"Got my order to go, because it was near closing on a Saturday night. Saw something white in my pasta that I had never seen before in the pasta. Picked it up, and turns out it was someone's gum. Took the whole dish back to them the next morning and was given an attitude by the manager and told they can't do refunds or gift cards today, call back Monday. So not only did I not get dinner because there was gum in it, but I also have to wait who knows how long for them to refund on Monday and it to be processed by my card company."
Myrrh H.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,3.0,3/17/2017,"We have frequented this place for years. The food is good, the cheesecake amazing. We went there yesterday for my birthday. The hostess showed us to a corner table by the front door; I asked if we could be seated at a little less noisy table because my mother in law was hard of hearing. They acted like I insulted them, ""all the tables are noisy,"" and we watched table after table being seated in front of us. We left. Thank you for your comments. This was the first time we had experienced anything like this, and will definitely give your restaurant another chance."
Michelle B.,"Houston, TX",399,264,319,4.0,1/27/2016,"The Skinny Chopped Salad and the service I received here on my last visit have made this place more of a 4 than a 3 for me. I absolutely adore that they have a skinny menu, and their chopped salad is plentiful and delicious and for less than 600 calories. I seriously do not see how you can go wrong. The price is a bit steep for a salad, but I seriously crave this one and their dressing. And since we're being good, we can splurge on a slice (or 3) of the pumpernickel bread. Onto the service, the last time I came I was out to lunch with my team, and we were in a rush. My supervisor ordered the salmon, my co-worker a pasta dish, and I of course ordered my salad. When the pasta and salad came out, the waiter told us that the salmon was not placed due to a mistake in the back, but he apologized profusely and offered to bring her a soup to keep her waiting. She agreed and took the tortilla soup, and after this, the manager stopped by to also apologize and make sure she got something to eat while she was waiting. She enjoyed the tortilla soup, and the salmon came not too long after, and the waiter knew we were in a rush so he brought us all to-go containers and bags ahead of time. Every restaurant has mistakes happen, and Cheesecake Factory demonstrated EXACTLY how every restaurant should handle every mistake and delay in service to keep customers happy and coming back. I'll happily be back, although it's worth noting that this, like all stores in the Galleria, gets super crowded at peak times, so plan accordingly."
Taresa K.,"Fleming Island, FL",631,134,1385,4.0,12/4/2015,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory There menu has so much to choose from and it's absolutely delicious food. It's a great place to bring the family, coworkers even to celebrate a special event. We've been to the Galleria Cheesecake Factory too many times to count not to mention the Cheesecake Factory in different cities. We haven't been let down yet. Sometimes the wait time is a bit extensive because everyone loves the Cheesecake Factory. From pastas to Louisiana style creole shrimp and rice flavored airing high.  I love the seafood as well as the red velvet cheesecake. If your ever looking for a nice sit down redo able priced restaurant for yourself family or group defiantly count this restaurant on your list. Dressed up or down you will feel comfortable. I hope this review was helpful have a nice day."
Carol N.,"Sherwood, AR",72,106,561,4.0,8/19/2016,The food was good but the service could be better. I love the different varieties of cheesecakes of course!
