Natalie M.,"Houston, TX",2,19,,5.0,4/11/2013,I love the food and my favorite cheesecake pumpkin..... Mmmmmm... Nice romantic restaurant
John M.,"Houston, TX",4,54,10,2.0,4/10/2013,"The food at either location (Galleria or Memorial City Mall)  is run-of-the-mill.  I'd compare it to what you would get at Chilli's, Apple Bees except pricier.  Although they do try to change the menu as often to give variety.  I like the skinny menu they have which seems to have some tasty dishes at reduced calories.  However, I've never had good luck with the TCF, it seems every time I go to either of the locations, I experience a mishap.  i.e. delayed seating, wrong dish, dirty plates, unfriendly service....    One more thing which is an irritation is Happy Hour pricing is only at the Bar.  You pay full price for the same drinks during happy hour if you're seated at a table.  Who knows... maybe next time I have better luck...."
Andrew K.,"Jackson, MS",15,5,,4.0,6/1/2013,"Great service, Great Staff, Great Food.....and the Cheesecake...OMG! the BEST!"
Henry W.,"San Francisco, CA",730,782,180,4.0,11/20/2006,Yes I know its a chain but certain items on the menu are good here.. I actually order the same four things everytime I come here -  1. Fried Calamari 2. Thai Lettuce Wraps 3. Chicken Picatta After my second stomach opens I order the 4) Banana Cream Cheesecake. Food : 8/10 Service : 7/10 Ambience : 7/10
Gerald M.,"Tampa, FL",292,253,99,4.0,9/22/2012,"We were given a paiger and advised we could walk around the Galleria Mall a bit because there was about a 30 min wait.  About an hour and a half later the pager went off.  I thought WOW, this place must be great with a line that long.  However, I was disappointed when I saw the menu. I wound up ordering some sort of chicken pasta and a mojito.  My meal was ok but my majito was probably the best I have ever had. So good, I had to order another, but it was probably the worst. Chef Ramsey would have been smacking some mint across a bartenders face talking about how a good restaurant is all about consistency. I just regret not trying the cheesecake.  Maybe that's what all the hype is about...you think?"
Rebecca v.,"Breckenridge, CO",180,182,13,3.0,9/12/2010,"So, I went here for my birthday, because I figured it was a good place to splurge on  cheesecake, guilt free.  The portions are huge, the service was fair and the taste of the food was also very good.  It was pretty crowded and there was a 20 min wait.  This restaurant is pretty loud, but I was fortunate enough to have been seated in the quiet area (the atrium)  For five people, dinner came out to 120 dls, thats including appetizers and desserts. And leftovers!  This is a nice casual and affordable place, if you are conscious about your waistline, this place is probably not for you."
Naomi T.,"Houston, TX",5,10,34,4.0,2/14/2012,"I recently moved to Houston with my man and this being his home town he was eager to show me around town. And of course it wouldn't be complete without a visit to the galleria. After wandering around the mall we had worked up an appetite and were eager to try the Cheesecake factory since neither of us had been. Our waiter was beyond superb. I had trouble deciding from the HUGE menu so i kept asking him for suggestions, much to his and my boyfriend amusement. I eventually decided on the burrito which was massive ( it lasted me for a whole nother meal after wards.) My boyfriend ordered the shrimp gumbo which was also Delicious. We both ate half of our big entrees then went on to desert. I eventually decided on the red velvet cheesecake which was amazing although a little too sweet. My man got the snickers cheesecake and liked it as well. Will definitely be back again in the future"
Summer H.,"Universal City, TX",16,9,33,3.0,12/22/2010,"I went here for a get together today and had a wonderful time. We had a thirty minute wait for a party if eight, but really enjoyed the atmosphere and service. It's a little pricey but if you split dishes you should be fine, because the plates are huge."
Kate A.,"Sugar Land, TX",124,430,16,5.0,2/22/2012,This place is constantly packed but for good reasons! The cheesecakes are to die for... thank goodness for ordering them to go! There is a huge menu of just cheesecakes and you can order them by the slice or take the whole cake - awesome!
Jeannie M.,"Katy, TX",15,54,5,4.0,12/1/2011,"I went last night with my two daughters and husband..our first time as a family and my third in my life...but never in Houston. Let me say that the service was impeccable. My husband was commenting already 5 minutes in about how great the service was already. The place was very clean and loved the ambiance of it. My daughters behaved very well and thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and fries; while my oldest got a hamburger. I ordered the shrimp scampi..(can I say wow??? totally worth the $19.99)..the shrimp were HUGE and very flavorful!! Portions were huge and I only finished a third of my plate. My husband got the steak (I don't remember the name and he couldn't pronounce it so he just pointed it out on the menu..lol)..he says it's the best steak he has ever had in a while...(even topping Cole's chop house in Napa, CA). We ordered the oreo cheesecake and the plain...my husband scarfed the plain by himself..while my daughters enjoyed the oreo cheesecake. They loved them both. The only reason why I did not give this a 5 star is quite frankly the bill. We spent $130 including tip for a family of 4. (2 adults and 2 kids). I could see them offering smaller portions and lowering the price a bit for the main courses..their cheesecakes for $6.95 a slice..heaven."
Amanda S.,"Houston, TX",84,16,5,1.0,10/25/2013,"The hostess ruined the whole experience here. I've NEVER in my life had someone some stranger become so catty towards me for no absolute reason. I came up to the hostess stand with my boyfriend and she automatically gives me a stank face. I asked for a table for 2 and she rudely says, ""Well there's a wait, what's your name?"" I told her just to put it under ""Jose"". She rolls her eyes and then proceeds to tells me, ""yeah, we'll call you when your table is ready."" Me and the boyfriend stood next to the stairs and my boyfriend even felt upset by the way the hostess talked to me. Mind you my boyfriend is oblivious towards a lot of things, but he even felt the how much of a b-word this chick is. We saw the couples in front of us get sat, so we thought we were up, but nope some group comes up from the stairs and get sat before us.... my thought was maybe the group had a reservation. A few other people come up from the stairs get sat before us and my boyfriend was fuming at this point. He was like let's go, because this b---- hostess does not like you and then when she saw my boyfriend and I glancing back and forth at her she calls us up. Mind you they  didn't say ""Jose, party of two"" they just said ""party of two"" meaning that horrible hostess didn't even bother putting our name down. I love the Cheesecake Factory, but if that hostess is working again if I go... wouldn't even bother dining. Oh, and the rudeness was directed towards me too, she was all smiles when it came to other patrons. She obviously didn't like me for some reason."
Iris R.,"Houston, TX",68,203,67,5.0,7/22/2012,"Yes, it's a little pricey...but the portions are humongous, so it makes up for it...always have leftovers! The food is always delicious, and the CHEESECAKE. You can't go wrong with a million varieties of amazing cheesecake! I love the way it looks inside, and it may always be crowded, but it's worth it! If you want to indulge yourself, go here!!"
David N.,"Houston, TX",4193,3753,2208,4.0,8/15/2009,"When I think of Cheesecake factory I think an overpriced over rated Chili's.  It has a wide variety of food that's alright so a big group of people who don't have their mind set on anything can find something on the menu. So why does it deserve 4 stars? The CHEESECAKE of course! Don't bother getting the food here because everything is mediocre.  However, the cheesecakes are to DIE FOR!!! My favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle.  White Chocolate is already my favorite.  So you already won me over but add the rest and it's the best thing ever!   I'm not a fan of chocolate (yes I know I'm odd) but I actually enjoyed the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake too. The wait here can be terrible so I usually just put my name on the list and window shop at the near by stores."
Russell C.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/31/2014,"Okay so I've been to The Cheesecake Factory plenty of times and generally the food and service is pretty good; however after my terrible dinning experience this evening I felt the need to share a few thoughts with people looking to dine at this establishment.  So, I came in for a late dinner with my boyfriend tonight around 9pm excited with all the buzz about national cheesecake day. As to be expected the restaurant was busy but we were willing to wait the short 15 minute wait. After being seated we only waited a few minutes before our waiter came over to greet us and take our drink order. I don't expect servers to be over the top friendly but this guy clearly did not want to wait on us. The water he brought my boyfriend had a piece of cheesecake in it! EW EW EWWWWWW! We had asked another server to replace the water for us, but he never bothered to ask if we were okay or apologized. We had completely lost our appetite and didn't bother eating our entree. Not to mention our entrees were not appetizing looking at all. My boyfriend and I both ordered salads and they looked as if they were sitting in the window for hours. The lettuce was browning and drowning in dressing. Our waiter was barley present at our table and checked on us only one time. I wanted to order cheesecake and my boyfriend was asking for a menu but I was so discouraged from the evenings service and food that I told our waiter to just bring the check, which he actually shrugged at us at the table at went off for the check. WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT NAMED AFTER CHEESECAKE DOESNT OFFER YOUR CUSTOMERS CHEESECAKE?? ON NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY?!! So he closed us out (tab was $62) and I tipped accordingly (18% even though he REALLY RELALY did not deserve it).  But it doesn't end there.... So I really really wanted cheesecake so I decided the night can be saved. I will stop by the cheesecake service area and order a cheesecake to go. I used a gift card to pay for dinner and apparently our waiter hadn't closed out the table so we had to wait for the cashier to call him over to close the tab so we could pay for our cheesecake. This guy had the nerve to come over and ask me if I had taken the check book. Um maybe if you were present at the table more often you would have known where it was. I left without the cheesecake. I won't be returning. For the price you can have a much much better dinner elsewhere.  Also for the record, I do know my waiters name, but in the name of karma I will keep that information to myself."
Adam C.,"Houston, TX",33,60,,4.0,8/27/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is the type of marquee restaurant that I typically don't care much for.  You know, the one's with more style than substance, the must-visits for people visiting from out of town and who don't know better.  That's how I feel about the Cheesecake Factory when I go for breakfast or lunch.  Most of their omelets are bland and completely tasteless.  And even though their salads and sandwiches are top-notch, I'm not a big fan of either salads or sandwiches when I'm eating out. However, their dinners fare much better.  I'm a big fan of their pizzas, and I'm usually not crazy about pizza in general.  I particularly enjoy their mushroom and chicken and goat cheese and vegetables pizzas.  Of course, there's really only one reason to go here, and that's the cheesecake.  There's a large variety of flavors, but my favorites are the chocolate- and fruit-based mixtures.  The drawback is that sometimes it doesn't taste like you're eating cheesecake in its pure form, which is a drawback for me because I like the specific flavor of cheesecake.  So I usually choose the mild flavors that don't interfere too much with cheesecake taste.  And if you don't like cheesecake, then choose another dessert.  When it comes to something sweet, you can't lose."
Basil A.,"Houston, TX",2,36,10,5.0,9/26/2012,"Very fast seating for lunch yesterday. Extremely good service, food was delicious."
Jason H.,"Missouri City, TX",21,18,4,4.0,9/13/2009,"This place is something to get excited about . . .  Since its inside of the Galleria mall, it's a convenient idea to stop here to eat after an evening of shopping.  But after I tried their tiramisu I actually started ignoring the mall part just so I could go straight here and eat. Go figure! Since the Galleria is an integral location for people around the world to get their shop on, if you're a people watcher like me you will like this place.  The environment is relaxed and it's an excellent place to take friends.  Also for the price the great service is a plus as well.   You'll have to excuse me I'd like to go on with my review but . . . TIRAMISUUUUU!!!!! Bottom line:  I'm sorry Jason has left the building to go get some tiramisu from the Cheesecake Factory . . . he will be back after his nap."
Cayenne C.,"League City, TX",46,118,9,4.0,10/14/2011,"This is a good place for a family dinner. A little on the noisy side, but in a fun way.  Surprisingly good food for a chain. I really enjoyed the black pepper shrimp.  I was dreading going here, but this is where the group wanted to go. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. The prices were reasonable, and we were immediately seated at 6pm on a Saturday night (party of 6 + toddler).  Be sure to valet park--otherwise you'll spend the whole evening looking for a space!"
Candess M.,"Houston, TX",0,48,1,2.0,7/30/2014,"Overpriced, strictly ok food. I would only go for the cheesecake, which isn't even made locally. The only saving grace is the amazing staff and incredible service."
