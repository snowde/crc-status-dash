R A.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,2.0,1/21/2013,"I always catch up with college friends during the holidays and we usually end up here, so everyone can get what they want.  On our most recent visit, we were seated quickly in a crowded restaurant, and our server was attentive.  But, the food is average, at best.  The bulk of a menu doesn't allow any one entree to stand out.  I had a chicken sandwich that tasted like I could have gotten it anywhere.  The high point of the meal was the Red Velvet Cheesecake--order it every time!"
Esteban Luis F.,"Houston, TX",10,49,7,2.0,3/20/2009,"Get your tickets to the show! This once popular and respected restaurant  disappointingly operates like a circus where the animals run this show.  The wait staff/ servers reprise the roles of disheveled clowns clumsily juggling to balance their orders.  The unruly and dated animal house themed factory's service is coarse. These sloppy dressed performing jesters are either overworked, or they lack the enthusiasm to profit from providing a valuable service. The food my wife and I ordered was the straw that broke the elephant's back.   Our appetizer was an order of the Crispy Crab Wontons that was visually pleasant to describe the least and a distasteful wreck of over fried wonton noodles filled with mush at best. Our main course was the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  This order I thought would have redeemed its failed appetizer.  Surprised, our main meal was another poor choice to order.  Turn that frown upside down, right?   Wrong!  Why so serious? Painfully, our dessert (strawberry cheesecake) tasted as though thawed for the 15 minutes we waited for its arrival.  Upon its entrance, this audience had mentally left this joke of a biz to run its circus act as my wife and I visually took in this Ringling Brothers atmosphere. -Esteban"
Tuan L.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",426,343,884,3.0,1/12/2010,"I enjoy going to The Cheesecake Factory. Each time I go, the service is good and the food is satisfying. The menu is quite extensive, you just need to find a dish that you like. For me, it's the white chicken chili. I guess I'm drawn to it because it reminds me of the chili and rice I used to get in Cali, the only difference is TCF serves it with white chicken chili rather than regular chili. The complimentary bread is surprisingly good. It comes out warm and soft. And, who can forget the Cheesecake. I guess if you're called The Cheesecake Factory, you have to be known for it. I'm a old school guy, so I usually order the old fashion cheesecake with strawberries,never been too big on the other fancy types of cheesecake."
Martin W.,"Houston, TX",1,10,2,4.0,12/24/2012,"Went to the Cheescake Factory in the Houston Galleria on Dec 23rd 2012 near closing time. Was seated quite promptly, even though the place was packed. As a Norwegian who's recently relocated to Texas and who find most portions here to be insanely huge, the Skinnylicious menu at Cheescake Factory was a good option for me. Our server, Joseph, was very courteous and professional, and made sure our needs were met. Will definitely be coming back for more."
Elaine W.,"Katy, TX",890,127,2,3.0,1/22/2009,"I give this place 3 stars because of it's location. I prefer the Redondo Beach, Ca location much better. Oh well, on any given night expect to wait a while to be seated. Considering how loud this place is you may want to dust off the 'ole megaphone and  bring it along with you. (Don't worry no one will even notice ...I guess if you can read lips your good too!) Okay moving on, the portions are what I like to call ""Texas"" style which means....huge! So be sure to come hungry!  There's something for everyone on the menu....it's literally the size of a spiral notebook with several pages.  Don't for get to save some room for dessert...I prefer the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.  It's awesome!"
Wendy R.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,4.0,6/15/2014,"While we enjoy the food, the main reason we return is for Corbin.  He is an awesome waiter that always pays attention to detail."
Ambi C.,"Plano, TX",2,64,40,3.0,11/13/2010,I have been to many different locations for cheesecake factory. However- this one was the best.  I loved how the staff was very helpful.  I have a lot of dietary restrictions and they were very accommodating accommodating As always- food at cheesecake factory is great!
John V.,"Houston, TX",50,154,62,2.0,12/1/2011,I really don't know why my family likes to eat here.  The portion sizes are ridiculously huge.  You can feed two people per entree.  We had a mediocre waiter that did a less average job.
Racquel D.,"Houston, TX",78,262,676,2.0,9/14/2011,"The service at this location sucks! It used to be pretty decent, but not anymore. It took a waiter 15 minutes to bring us water, and another 15 to take our drink order. No matter where you're seated in the restaurant, the service took forever."
Jenny M.,"Austin, TX",26,90,,2.0,1/4/2009,"Overcrowded, Overwhelmed and Overrated. Altogether, on a Saturday night, it took my party four hours to get food and leave, between the long wait for a table and slow service. The staff is clearly overwhelmed and the floors were slippery. My poor friend was seated next to the waiters' station where all the silverware was being shuffled...so on top of the loud ambient level of noise he had to deal with clanging metal for three hours. The food is fine but I don't think I'll go again."
Nhu Lan P.,"Houston, TX",15,101,1,4.0,3/22/2012,"Delicious food! I ordered the grilled salmon with asparagus and spinach. It was probably the best meal I've had from Cheesecake.  Our waiter was really attentive.  We were seated immediately, which I thought was weird since it's in the galleria, but we didn't go a little later, like 9:30pm."
Laura W.,"Katy, TX",168,312,188,4.0,7/25/2011,"I love this restaurant but I always feel crappy when I leave b/c I spent way too much money for way too many calories! This place has delicious food, don't get me wrong but EVERYTHING is so fattening! If you haven't been here before, share your entree with someone! I swear, you will still walk out stuffed. One word to describe this restaurant: RIDICULOUS"
Jenny C.,"San Antonio, TX",123,140,18,5.0,9/16/2011,Yummy! Mercedes our waitress was awesome! The food was great as always! The bread was delicious! The wait wasn't long and the cheese cake was AMAZING! A+
Tallon D.,"Houston, TX",5,7,,1.0,2/13/2011,"By definition, the Cheesecake Factory should have outstanding cheesecake, and it does. That being said, the food AND the service is not worth what the menu says it is. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich this time and I could have sworn I was eating a fast food sandwich. Not only that, but several errors occurred during the meal. First, the order was delayed for an unknown reason, prompting the manager to visit the table. Second, the waitress drops my fries when bringing my food. Not such a big deal since they offered to get me fresh ones. Third, they brought me BLUE CHEESE instead of mayo for my sandwich. I had already started spreading it on the top half of my bun by the time I had realized something was awry, but the manager offered to get me a fresh top bun for my sandwich. Fourth, I never received the onions I asked for when I initially ordered the sandwich. Fifth, on more than one occasion I had to call the waiter over to get a refill of water. Between all this, I feel overcharged for the quality of food and service I received. My advice, if you decide to go to The Cheesecake Factory, just stick to cheesecake. **UPDATE** It's official, this place gave me and my girlfriend food poisoning. Thanks for a great Valentine's Day, Cheesecake Factory. Hope you enjoy your one star rating as much as I enjoy being sick."
Vanessa M.,"Houston, TX",48,310,221,2.0,7/13/2009,"Gosh, I actually liked this place before I read AKO's review.  Now I will never go here again.  The power of Yelp...Damn you Yelp ;("
Sergio S.,"Fort Worth, TX",237,572,136,3.0,10/7/2008,"I had been wanting to eat here for a long time. Somehow--I could never make it to Cheescake Factory. Perhaps my disdain for malls had something to do with it? Anyway, I finally made it here with my sister one afternoon. I don't recall disliking the food, but I do think it was very forgettable. My reason for going to the Cheescake Factory, however, was not the main menu but the cheescake. Their menu offers twenty billion varieties. We went with some Peanut Butter type variety. Delicious! I think I might come back here--but skip the main menu and head right for the Cheescake."
Matthew L.,"Baltimore, MD",990,726,161,3.0,4/15/2009,"Actually one of the better ones.  It's two stories and that is a unique feature.  It's also large and suprisingly less gaudy than many others.  As always you know what you're getting; large portions, a giant menu and dessert."
Lindsay J.,"Austin, TX",262,204,20,3.0,10/20/2008,"Damn, this place is big for its britches! This location has some very undesirable seating options, such as right behind the hostess stand, where names of parties are hollered out as their tables become ready. But there are also a few fabulous ones, such as a window booth that overlooks Westheimer. Cross your fingers for a decent table, because otherwise, your experience will be screwed. I hate that they have the gall to advertise within their menus. I don't care if you're located inside a mall or not. I will say that there are some very reasonably-priced wines by the glass, and I appreciate the smaller lunch portions being available on weekends. Only stop in here to eat if it's your last resort, don't plan around a meal here. There are better dining options with fewer screaming tots within the Galleria like the Daily Grill."
Miya T.,"Houston, TX",3,6,,5.0,3/11/2012,This is one of my fav resturants  by far! Always satisfied with the wide selection menu. try the New Orleans Shirmp dish when you visit.
J. D.,"Houston, TX",60,52,21,2.0,6/26/2009,"With the long wait for a table and the crowd of people, you'd swear this place had the best food in town. First off, this place is highly over-rated. While the ambiance is okay, the food is mediocre at best.  I've been several times over the years and haven't been impressed much with this chain.  Their menu is expansive, but at the same time, I think it can be overwhelming for many because there's so many choices to choose from. Though the entree portions served are plentiful, I think overall the food is overpriced for the quality of food that's placed before you.  Of the times I've been there, I've had the chicken marsala (it's okay), a Thai chicken dish with coconut curry, rice, and peanuts (not very flavorful), pasta carabonara (too oily and lacking of flavor), garlic noodles (very bland), and creamy chicken soup (actually really good). For the place to be called Cheesecake Factory, you would think the portion of cheesecake offered would be huge like Junior's on the east coast, but it's not. Don't get me wrong, their cheesecakes are good IMO (love their tiramisu cheesecake  the most), but the price is too much for it to be a chain restaurant and for the amount you're given. The best thing to me about Cheesecake Factory though are their drinks (the reason why this review doesn't have one star). Matter of fact, some of my girlfriends and I  just make a night of coming here and ordering their drinks while we catch-up with one another.  My favorite drinks of theirs are the Georgia Peach, Peach Bellini, Typhoon Punch (beware... it's served it a big glass, but towards the end of the drink, you'll begin to feel the punch lol), and the Strawberry Creamsicle (which is a grown up milkshake spiked with vodka).  Most recently, Cheesecake Factory has started offering a small plate and snacks menu. I must say this is very welcoming because it's not only easy on the pockets, but when I do come here for just for the drinks, I do want something to snack on besides the bread, but even the appetizers were too large. From their small plate and snacks menu, I usually get their stuffed mushrooms (which are very good), sausage and ricotta pizza,  and beets with goat cheese salad. You could really just make a small meal from the items that they have on that menu and be able to splurge on more drinks and dessert. Is Cheesecake Factory worth coming to, I guess it all depends, but personally I'll stick with coming here for late night outings with my girls for drinks and a snack from their small plate menu."
