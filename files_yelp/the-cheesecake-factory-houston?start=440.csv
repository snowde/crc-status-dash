R P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,3,2.0,12/29/2011,"Poor service. The waiter served us all the desserts before the appetizers and when we told him, he asked why we didn't specify. I told him I never realized one had to specify appetizers come before dessert. Even 20 mins after the dessert there weren't any appetizers so I cancelled them. The worse part is that the store didn't even offer any of those appetizers on the house- not that I was asking for them but they should have at least offered as a compensation for their mistake. I was very displeased w the service and will visit another dessert place in the future."
Rupa S.,"Culver City, CA",121,170,,2.0,4/13/2009,"Normally I can find something good at a Cheesecake Factory... and normally it's more than 1 thing.  The BBQ pizza was Funky... the tomato/ basil pizza was tasteless, and our pasta was COMPLETELY devoid of flavor.  However, the dark bread was very good. I ate that as my meal in the end."
Dana C.,"Houston, TX",64,117,77,4.0,11/17/2008,"Let's start with the pros... Awesome food, usually friendly service, huge portions, beautiful interior, huge menu. And the cons... Noisy, won't accept reservations, pricey, crowded, having to deal with pain in the ass Galleria parking, and awkward seating arrangements."
Nick R.,"Fresno, TX",10,129,3,4.0,5/9/2011,"(Ate here a while back not on the day of the posting)   Awsome food, good wait staff, but what a wait - 30 minutes! Also, other people were being seated before us and they came in after  us with no reservations, bad business, when asked why, hostess stated they were here already - BS. Food was excellent, drinks were good, food was hot & they gave you lots of it! Apps were good - all of it was good. Only recommendation was go early or else it will be a long wait."
Allison L.,"Irving, TX",5,29,19,4.0,8/1/2009,"The food is always good, and the servings are so big that I don't mind paying the higher price.  We always take home leftovers. Service was excellent when I dined there last week on a weeknight around 6:30 for a party of seven."
Tracey M.,"Katy, TX",1,34,,4.0,12/28/2013,Cheesecake Factory has consistency at an awesome level. Their cheesecake is too dense and their service is always slow. But I love their food. Their Skinnilicious menu has some great food too.
Brandy C.,"Jonestown, TX",144,418,333,4.0,1/17/2011,"This place never gets old for me, even if it should. We ate here for lunch after the ice skating adventure, today on MLK Day (so the kids were all off of school). Were we shocked at the 20 minute wait? Nah, it sucks, but I've never not waited there. The service is always quite good, our waiter was charming, attentive and bothered to learn all the kids' names (I hardly care about other kids' names, so go him). The bill is always shockingly high, but I guess more shocking is the amount of food we always end up piling up. We always get the Pan seared Ahi-Tuna appetizer (so good) and today we got little salads (yum), crabcakes, and pizzatas (mushroom, yum). The kids got normal kid fare, though they could have used a crayon. Grand Lux at least has the Wiki Sticks, bring them over. Got two desserts for five people to share - the lemon cake was good but that 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake - whoo hoo! I could eat here everyday, if only I had the wallet and the metabolism... looks like one might be opening at Memorial City (or their little sister Grand Lux) and I'm sure that will be as popular as this one. **sidenote not from this visit - their Lemon Drop Martini is the bestest. I don't drink normally and I never drink martinis. I am a baby about ""ew, this tastes like liquor. So yeah, even I am singing their praises. **Addl sidenote, again not from this visit. Are you low carbing. OMGawsh, meet the 6 card slice of cheesecake. Get it with the strawberries and cream if you want. Won't hurt your diet a bit and absolute frickin perfection. That is all."
Mona K.,"Central Southwest, Houston, TX",0,11,1,5.0,12/7/2013,This review is for the dessert only as I didn't have an entree. The tiramisu was heaven!!!
Kristopher Micah A.,"Houston, TX",3,20,,4.0,8/19/2011,"Yes, cheesecake but sad that they do not have a client reward system, sometimes the lines are very long thou."
Alan S.,"Houston, TX",657,1413,293,4.0,3/3/2008,"Good Cheesecake.  It's overpriced, but it tastes good!  Thats the same summary for the food in general.  Since it's near the gallery, it's a good place to stop in for when you are in the area.  You get a lot of food so don't worry about that.  I'm never hungry for the desert, but I eat it anyways!  I like the double cheeseburger thing... but I'm always over stuffed!"
Shawn C.,"Indianapolis, IN",27,32,1,5.0,10/4/2007,"If you don't mind fighting the Galleria traffic and don't mind eating with Galleria people then this is a great place to eat.  The menu is huge.  A great variety of food to choose from.  I can't speak for any of it except the Bang Bang Thai Chicken and Shrimp - which is incredible and what I order every time.  The portions are substantial.  I'm not a light eater but I take home a full meal in leftovers each time There are approximately 7,000 different desserts to choose from, of which 95% are cheesecake.  I highly recommend that Dark Chocolate Raspberry, as the ganache is excellent.  Our service has been great here as well.  Overall, it's a little more expensive than some places, but given the quality and quantity of the food it is so worth it."
David S.,"Houston, TX",0,2,1,1.0,7/16/2011,"This was my first and LAST trip to this or any other Cheesecake Factory.  The service my group received was horrible at best.  The rest of the people in my group may have had a different experience but I felt like I was totally ignored by the waiter.  I had to stop another waiter to get my only refill on my drink. The food was average.  We had a chicken dish, mac and cheese, and an original cheesecake.  WARNING the cheesecake is NOT a New York style cheesecake.  What a waste of time and money! I only went because someone else in our group wanted to go.  This was definitely a lesson learned.  Just because it is a national chain, it does not mean that the food or service is good.  HUGE disappointment!!!!"
Karen P.,"Katy, TX",18,12,54,3.0,1/15/2013,"normally i love this place!!! but this time  was not that good. normally the brown bread is to die for, but this time it wasn't, i make it better at home. the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps are not good, too rich bleh.  i usually get the chickenbelagio so yeah"
Shana M.,"Roseburg, OR",183,363,311,4.0,8/19/2007,"Godiva Chocolate Brownie - I crave thee. Alas, I cannot have you.  But I can have the 6 Carb Original Cheesecake - perfectly creamy with a walnut and graham crust.   It's no Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake but it sure is good. And I know this may seem a tad pathetic with all of the good food they have to offer but I LOVE the Classic Burger at The Cheesecake Factory.  I know I could dive into Goulash or Chicken and Biscuits but there is something about having a perfectly prepared burger while on break from marching all over the Galleria.   I am always a little annoyed that they don't have a kid's menu because the adult portions are way too large for anyone under 12 - but usually an appetizer will cover it.   Anyway, who's there for the food?  Any kid dining there is just waiting to get into their favorite dessert and that's how it should be."
Michele M.,"Rogers, MN",9,105,37,4.0,11/13/2012,"The Cheescake Factory was truly delightful. The decor is inviting and comfortable. The warm bread basket was wonderful - the sweet rye bread was fantastic.  We enjoyed lettuce wraps and avocado spring rolls. Both were delicious. I especially loved the lettuce wraps.  I am a big fan of P.F. Changs' lettuce wraps, but I have to say, Cheesecake Factory certainly gave P.F. Changs serious competition. After the appetizers we split a piece of key lime cheesecake - certainly one cannot visit the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake, right? The tart lime was a perfect complement to the meal. The one thing that did surprise me was the noise level in the restaurant. The ambiance would seem to suggest a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, but, in fact, the noise level was quite distracting. I am not sure if it was the acoustics of the room we were in or if it is just that noisy. I do recommend the Cheesecake Factory and would not hesitate to visit again."
Anmry N.,"Bellaire, TX",79,184,5,3.0,12/29/2009,"They always have a long wait, staff sometimes pretentious and easily annoyed.  The food may come in huge portions but it's not worth the wait.  The bar is miniscule - blink and you'll miss it.  Ok, so it may be exaggerated but it is small.  It just sounds good, ""Wanna go to the Cheesecake Factory?"" Self-response before anyone answers, ""No, wait.  The line is too long.""  Ah, woe is me for sometimes feeling compelled to go here."
Robert C.,"League City, TX",20,49,20,3.0,10/13/2007,"I start with the Ahi Carpaccio: very thin sliced ahi tuna with pickled cucumber, and teriyaki.  Delicious!   Main dish is Chicken Teriyaki, brocoli, char-grilled plantain and pineapple.  The chicken has the bones removed and is a little dry, but the veggies and fruits were a great addition.  My guest had the Asian Salad that looked like a small mountain.    The carrot cake is about the size of my torso, so it was A-OK, too!! The service was good, but the noise was too much.  Shouting at lunch is no fun!  Sit next to your guest so you can talk and make snarky comments on the people passing by..."
H. E.,"Shiner, TX",1,30,15,4.0,3/27/2009,"My fiancee and I went for my first time there...and we had to wait for about 15 minutes to get in.  Very crowded, but I guess that's a testament to their popularity. We got there, and we ordered the tamale cakes as an appetizer...it was very tasty and almost creamy, as if the ingredients were put through a blender...there were avocados, sweet corn inside...and plenty of other ingredients to make this a good dish... Then our entrees came, and she had the soup and sandwich dish...clam chowder with a chicken salad sandwich...she enjoyed it very much...there were spinach leaves on her plate as if it was an added salad. My meal was just a regular ham and cheese omelette...with double ham and double cheese...I'd just like to say that I've never seen an omelette made that thickly...it must have had 4-5 eggs because it was abundant with eggs.  The toast and the potatoes that came with the dish were good as well... Neither of us finished our dish because of the amount of the food that was served. I guess the only thing that I didn't like was that it was too noisy.  Granted we were in a mall, but at one time, I heard a blender, the crowd noise and music playing, and couldn't hear my fiancee talking in a normal tone. I'm sure we'll be back at some point for the value of the food."
Tamika B.,"Atlanta, GA",7,25,11,5.0,2/1/2011,Loved the friendly service and the food was GRRREAT!
Samuel L.,"Glendale, CA",554,17,,4.0,3/8/2011,"Not the greatest Cheesecake Factory I've been to, but it's still good!  I love to get the pasta here over the seafood.  A little pricey, but they give you a lot for the price.  Pasta is not too salty and not too dry.  I  love to get the Cajum Jambalaya or Pasta with Angel Hair.  Shepherds Pie was decent too.  Cheesecakes are overpriced and overrated here.  Honestly, I've had better cheesecakes from H.E.B for a lot less.  I've tried most of them, and there wasn't any one that stood out.  Overall, it's a good place to visit for the pasta..."
