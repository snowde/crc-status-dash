Dee Y.,"Houston, TX",1,193,,2.0,1/4/2009,"The only time I could get in, it was worth it. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is to die for and very decadent. However, the majority of the time you would need to wait for on average an hour and half to two hours and by that time, if you are smart, found another equally good restaurant in the Galleria area. The wait is simply not worth it and I suggest reserving in advance."
Christine G.,"Houston, TX",13,48,,1.0,10/17/2010,"This place is the worst place I have ever eaten at. It has gone down hill. The servers are horrible. They are clearly over worked and this has caused them to not care that the service is substandard. The food was cold and when I asked for the pepper mill, the server turned his head and pretended he didn't hear me and walked off. I stopped another server and they said ""we don't have one""! I said, ""I see it being used around me""!! They too walked away. We had to ask 5 times for bread and lemon (the bread is supposed to be complimentary). The food is salty and the lettuce was brown and off!!! Do not eat here!!!"
Cory O.,"Houston, TX",445,766,20,3.0,9/7/2007,"The portions are large and your bill will reflect this.  I remember taking my mom here and the first thing she said when she saw the portions was, ""No wonder Houston is considered one of the most obese cities in the US."" Ouch. And as much as I hate to admit it, my mother can sometimes be right.  The portions here are over the top.  Now, don't get me wrong, I always finish my meal (I tend to stick with the burger and fries), but there's nothing phenomenal about it.  Hell, I could get the same quality/quantity at Bennigans for half the price.   I suppose the cheesecake is worth checking out. . .hence the name.  But.  I'm just not sure I can justify spending $6-10 for a small slice of cheesecake.  Seriously.  I mean, sure, it's good, but you can buy a whole cheesecake for that much money!! The good thing about this place is that since it has the generic American menu, you can take people here and they're sure to find something they want.  If you're looking for generic, this is the place to go, but why live in a city with so many options and not take advantage?!"
Andy Z.,"McAllen, TX",1,20,48,3.0,3/10/2013,"the food was ok, but i think it was because i didn't order what i always order since it was Good Friday i ordered the salmon which was ok, I'm more a talipia type of guy. the key lime cheesecake was splendid."
Lisa S.,"Humble, TX",1,19,,5.0,2/19/2011,They menu has such a huuuuge variety!! Every I have ordered has always been so good! Its a oldie but a goodie!!
Timothy G.,"Lake Worth, FL",6,52,1,1.0,10/17/2010,Over the years the quality of food and beverages has gone down. The service and quality I have received at 2 location has now placed the Factory on my do not visit list. Definitely not worth the money you spend there.
Cas L.,"Houston, TX",84,257,16,3.0,11/6/2011,"For the times I have been here, I couldn't remember the last time I actually had a wonderful dine in experience. The restaurant gets really packed for lunch and dinner during the weekend. Surprisingly, I have been here during the weekdays too for lunch and it still gets very loud and packed. The service in my opinion is half/half. There are times our server is very helpful and good but there are times we get stuck with a really bad service. The tables are always dirty and the chairs gets really sticky even after when they clean them. I have encountered so many dirty area under the tables and I hated it. I am a big fan of their bread and butter to start off before your entree'. Some of their food is good, but it all depends on what you like and what you don't like. I don't recommend any of their terriyaki dishes because none of them actually taste good. Just keep ordering what it's known for ""American food"". The location is in a good spot especially it's connected to the Galleria mall which is a plus to many. Don't forget to try their cheesecakes! after all, they're called cheesecake factory for a reason."
Amber C.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/22/2013,"I am not sure the we are reviewing the same restaurant.  How can anyone give it more than 1 star is just beyond me.  Simply put, service is poor (the waitress and the front desk hostess are both rude and unhelpful) , food is bad (too much salad dressing, dripping wet sandwich, stale bread, bland ice tea with no lemon slice, tiramisu cake with no coffee flavor...), the deco is dated and everything is over- priced.  McDonald food tastes better than that.  We don't understand why people think it is a good restaurant and it is always packed, emperor's new clothes, maybe? Don't waste your money there."
Gidget L.,"Houston, TX",13,22,,5.0,1/19/2010,"I just do not get to this place often enough!!! Yesterday feeling a bit under nourished, I see heaven 'Cheesecake Factory'   Yippee food! well, first of all the perfect sweet dark bread came out asap with butter!!!!!! oh thank goodness....food! Okay so at this point I felt I am not going to pass out from hunger, so I order the avocado eggrolls, and these too were on my table asap! Perfect service, perfect food and perfect timing! I love you Cheesecake Factory. Note to self: Don't wait for an under nourished moment to fall into Cheesecake Factory, go because Cheesecake Factory is awesome!"
John W.,"Houston, TX",0,223,2,4.0,6/2/2010,"My wife and I went on Memorial Day and as usual, place was packed. Wait wasn't too bad, service was very average (it's never good) and it was extremely loud. I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, which was very good and plenty of food for around $15.  My wife had the Chicken Piccata which might be the best thing on the menu. Food is always good, you have to be prepared to be patient and be ok with a loud environment, not something I can do often but the variety of menu and food is sometimes worth it if your in the area."
Elizabeth W.,"Angleton, TX",63,19,,4.0,8/4/2010,"We went last night to celebrate my brother's birthday because he LOVES cheesecake.  I have to say we were not disappointed.  The drinks were amazing, and the cheesecake ... oh the cheesecake! My brother got the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake which was an amazing slice of a well know combination.  My bff ordered the new Red Velvet Layered Cheesecake, which I have to say was incredible.  I will definitely be ordering that one next time! I ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  It was incredible! Overall the service was good, the drinks were delicious, the cheesecake was through the roof, and the food was average.  We were very please with our experience and will be visiting again!"
Corey P.,"Houston, TX",2,19,,2.0,9/16/2010,"We arrived at about 6:30 and were told it was going to be a 20 minute wait, when we went to ask about our table 30 minutes later they told us we were next and it would be just a few minutes more, we ended up being seated at 7:30, three times longer than we were originally quoted. On top of the extremely unacceptable wait time the waitress was inattentive, and slow to bring drinks or refills. Also the main course came before the appetizer. In my opinion the food is not worth the wait or the horrible service."
kevin c.,"Pasadena, CA",1,68,,3.0,7/5/2010,"I went to this particular Cheesecake factory after my wife and I got so tired shopping. It was crowded and we had to wait, but the wait was not a big concern at all. After we were seated, and we ordered our appetizers and main course, it took us a while to figure out that the service speed was really slow. We ordered taquitoes but a server (not the one we ordered from) gave us avacado egg rolls... Evidently the orders were mixed up and another table had our food. We waited for a while for our appetizers and entree, even the bill. They have a lot of employees yet they aren't so attentive. I don't think I will be back to this particular location anymore. I know it's in the mall, but it's not the type of service I requested after paying 70 dollars for the meal."
Trillvia P.,"Atlanta, GA",24,95,15,4.0,11/23/2009,"Okay, let me put it lightly. I'm more so a fan of the dessert and drinks because I think the main course meals are typically a 3/5 or less - save a few exceptions! I would say though, the portions are huge and there will be leftovers for the hefty tab you'll get by the time you walk out of there so it evens out. You MUST try the stuffed tortillas, chicken pot stickers, avocado egg rolls, the cheesecake, ofcourse - godiva choc, vanilla bean & regular, strawberry lemonade and their mojitos! I have been there at all times of the day and ALWAYS have to wait 10-15mins+ and it's quite noisy but you get to people watch, and witness some damning conversations lol."
Andy G.,"Houston, TX",3,4,,5.0,1/19/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants!  I've never had a bad meal here.  Initially, the desserts attracted me (I knew that any place named after cheesecake would have killer desserts).  But, the entrees were surprisingly good.  I've had 5 or 6 different entrees, and every one of them makes me want to order it again.  I'm torn because the menu is so big and I always want to try new things, but I have enjoyed the previous meals so much I want to order them again."
Megan B.,"Pearland, TX",3,18,,2.0,10/28/2010,"I went yesterday afternoon after lunch to have a slice of CHEESECAKE (who would have thought!) it was the absolute worst experience I've ever had there. There was no host at the stand just a bunch of waiters standing around running their mouths about how no one was getting off and how slow it was, once I told them I needed a table for two the decided to pay attention and sit us. My waiter felt the need to talk about my clothing options  (my shirt said coexist on it he didn't know what it meant), did his talk about specials, drinks and other things I didn't really care to hear and took forever. I ordered my drink and told him we were just grabbing some cheesecake and he seemed offended! Are you kidding me?!? IT'S THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! He brought our order and the bill at the same time and we never saw him again. I had to get up and get my own to go box from the to go counter and when he did return he even had the guts to ask us if we wanted coffee or espresso before we left! Needless to say all of my cheesecake needs will be filled somewhere else."
Ali V.,"Houston, TX",16,124,4,4.0,8/18/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory has absolutely ANYTHING and EVERYTHING  that you could ever want! Their menu is HUGE!!!!!!!!!! You can get everything from edamame to pasta to pizza to buffalo wings to spinach dip to fish! I mean if you don't know what you're in the mood for this is the place to go!  For lunch they have humungous salads that are delicious!! Their bread is also wonderful, instead of being just regular wheat bread it has a hint of something sweet in it like honey.  For dessert you must try one of the cheesecakes! The Oreo one and the Godiva one are both soooo good!  Definitely a place to go!"
taylor c.,"Houston, TX",91,73,3,4.0,9/19/2010,"Really a 3.5 stars for me but I rounded up.  Okay so I like the food, its good. The cheesecake is fabulous and my favorite part about the place. I just don't like the location, how crowded it is, the price, the wait, anything along those lines. I've tried a new entree every time I come and I haven't found anything SPECTACULAR that makes me want to come again to fight traffic, and deal with parking and waiting and such. I have had the same exact entrees and portions at other restaurants that are just as good or better for the fraction of the cost. Yes, I know its going to be expensive because of the location and blah blah blah, I'm not holding that against them. I'm just saying that's why I IN PARTICULAR do not care for the place that much. It is way too noisy there too. and they layout is just bad and overcrowded. Like I said, my favorite part is the cheesecake, so instead of going here for cheesecake I just go to Barnes and Nobles because they sell Cheesecake Factory cheesecake in their Cafe lol. White Chocolate Raspberry is the BEST!"
Harold B.,"Houston, TX",120,297,158,4.0,10/18/2010,once again that menu is a beast to deal wit lol..but i will continue to hit em up..got the cuban sammich w side salad..this time..it was damn good!!!! yea but who cares..its bout cheesecake right..fuhsho..so hadda lilbittadat pineapple upside down and dat dere dutch apple!!!!!! cmon playas..get dis in ya life!!!
Myles R.,"Houston, TX",123,15,7,2.0,5/12/2009,How can you mess up French fries? Thought the food was rather bland. I'm not sure what happened to this place. it used to be pretty good and I was certainly surprised at how much it has declined in the two years since I've been. I think there are better choices in the Galleria area.
