Irene F.,"Pleasantville, NY",690,1833,7,4.0,1/25/2008,"Very very convenient lunch spot for us given it is right next door to the office! I've had the miso salmon and the orange chicken lunch specials, and they are delicious. Overall, the menu kicks ass. The service can be hit or miss, but generally you can get through lunch in an hour. Of course, this is a chain, blah blah blah, the portions are way too big, go for half size. Not much more to add for now, I'll be eating here a lot so i'll make sure to let y'all know if I see any mice or something."
Rose S.,"San Ramon, CA",256,142,9,3.0,4/4/2010,"They don't give free cheese cake on birthdays? That was messed up. This place was pretty crowded and the wait was long, but the food was really good. I went in hungry and left satisfied. That was my original intention."
Lisa N.,"Houston, TX",4,16,19,3.0,6/2/2011,love ur bread and chicken plates.. but just sometimes it just get really crowded. oh and i like how when u guys give free scoop of ice cream for bday ppls :) very nice..
Larina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,102,3,3.0,9/25/2007,Exercise portion control when dining here. The portions are big enough for two and the menu is so extensive that its spiral bound. I try to eat light-think summer rolls or lettuce wraps and then splurge all my calories on a oreo cheesecake (split that with someone too).
sasha e.,"Houston, TX",1,17,2,4.0,1/29/2010,"They dont specialize in a specific food, so if you dont know what to order, then you might be out ofl uck.

Warren M.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,2,4.0,7/12/2011,"Food is good but not out of this world. However there dessert if fantastic. Goods service, nice enviroment!!!"
Nina N.,"Katy, TX",12,70,43,3.0,2/25/2009,Bread and butter awesome. Monte cristo is yummy...
C L.,"New York, NY",0,12,,2.0,10/19/2009,"I've ordered take-out twice from this location and both times they have messed up my order.  The service is better when you eat in, don't bother ordering take-out."
George F.,"Saitama, Japan",12,41,,1.0,2/16/2009,"I personally believe this place is highly overrated. Basically what you're paying for is the fancy decor and environment. The food to me is nothing to crave about. Having eaten here several times, the cheesecakes aren't even good. If you like wasting your money on expensive food with mediocre tastes than by all means this is the place."
