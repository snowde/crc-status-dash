Karen D.,"Houston, TX",343,278,455,4.0,3/3/2017,"Love the experience every time! Ambiance is nice with a variety of diff rooms to sit in. Menu is extraordinarily extensive. I like how it has the calories listed, and I usually like to go healthy with the low cal salad and then splurge with a high cal slice of cheesecake. Would recommend the asian chicken salad or chopped salad. My bf loves the burgers here - bacon bacon is his fave. We liked the oreo cheesecake a ton as well! Service is on point: the asian salad smelled strongly of peanuts (which I am allergic to), so the server PROMPTLY asked the kitchen and confirmed it was merely the sesame."
Emy M.,"San Diego, CA",90,352,994,4.0,1/11/2017,"Date of visit: 10/18/2016 I get homesick really easily, so the nice thing about The Cheesecake Factory is that everything is pretty much the same wherever you go. Since this was my first time in Houston, I was feeling a little down, so Cam suggested we grab a late night bite to eat somewhere in the mall. I typically get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but I really wanted rice and chicken, so Cam and I opted to share the Cashew Chicken with Rice, which was awesome. It was a bit too salty, but it definitely encouraged us to drink more water, which our waitress refilled constantly. This restaurant spans across two floors, so I was a little confused when we walked in and there was no one in the restaurant. Turns out everyone was upstairs. The wait was a bit long, but they also seemed a bit understaffed in the front. Since we didn't really have anything else to do, we didn't mind the wait - it gave me a chance to drool over the cheesecake displays. As I mentioned earlier, the Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory wherever you go - our experience was pretty typical."
Kiva C.,"Austin, TX",241,46,4,4.0,9/14/2017,This place is a staple. Consistent as always. I love their grilled salmon always cooked properly and tastes fresh. The cheesecake is always consistent and never disappoints.
Eduardo L.,"Katy, TX",681,33,7,5.0,8/4/2017,"Rene special is the best!! Good portion plate. Salad, sandwich and clam chowder soup. Great customer service!!!! I love this place."
Lina O.,"Paris, France",0,12,2,5.0,8/24/2017,"Great food, great service, I really enjoyed the lunch with friends and family. The Pecan cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake.  I always come back to this place, it is one of my favorite restaurants. I am very disappointed that the quality of the one in Sugar Land is so different."
Kelsan L.,"Houston, TX",100,8,8,4.0,9/11/2017,We went for dTe night and had an excellent time.  The service was good and we enjoyed the food. Several items had changed on the menu since the last time we visited the restaurant. However our waiter was extremely helpful in helping us find items that were similar to our previous favorites.
Lauren S.,"Upper Kirby, Houston, TX",161,42,21,1.0,12/10/2016,"How to have a customer sit down and stay? Ask them what they want to eat. Literally no one even would greet us?  I come to eat here whenever I am shopping at the Galleria. They have a ""Skinny Menu"" that makes it easy to keep my meal at a certain calorie count which is really one of the only reasons I come here.  At the moment, I've been sitting at our table for over 15 minutes and haven't seen a waiter/waitress. There are also 5 empty tables around me and it is noon, so it's not because it's ""busy"". This is pretty standard service for this location over the years. We actually ended up not even eating here today because no one ever came to our table to take our order.  Food is typically good it just takes a long time to get and service is spotty. If you are at the Galleria I would suggest the Bistro on top of Nordstroms, food is delicious and service has always been wonderful!"
Melba M.,"Houston, TX",1,24,9,1.0,11/17/2016,"STAY AWAY!!!! By far one of the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have EVER had.  For starters, today was my mother's birthday, so we decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate.  That was our first mistake: 1. It took over 15 minutes for our waitress to greet us at the table. 2. My mother's food was not hot when it arrived at the table.  The salmon was dry, the mashed potatoes had been sitting out for so long that they were no longer soft, and had turned a yellow/brown color. 3. It took another 15 minutes for our waitress to return so that my mother could select a different dish. 4. We ask for a manager - it took the manager, Chris, over 10 minutes to come to our table.  I remember the time because I intentionally checked because it took so long.  When we asked our waitress why it was taking so long, she said ""the managers are all having a meeting with the new shift.""  Umm..ok?  I have never heard of a manager at a restaurant being unavailable when a patron asks to speak with one. 5. Manager finally arrives and my mother places a new order.  We order our dessert (remember, it is her birthday and BOTH this manager, Chris AND our waitress knew). 6. Dessert arrives.  No candle.  No ""happy birthday"" on the plate.  No song.  We ask our waitress if they still sing to guests at the table, and she says, and I QUOTE ""Oh, we still sing, but we only do it for certain tables... sometimes we don't want to disturb other guests.. But I always do it for my guests..""  ... Umm.. awkward?  So we are not your guests?  Are we not deserving?  Also, this was about 4pm, and there were maybe 3 people seated in our section. 7. We call a manager over again.  Takes Chris the same 10-15 minutes to arrive.  He proceeds to tell us what he would NOT do (i.e. comp our horrible dinner).  We end up ARGUING with the manager about our horrible experience (because there are plenty more details, such as old coffee, tea, cold food, no water refills, OVER CHARGED for things my mother sent back, poor service all around).   I have NEVER been to a restaurant where a manager argues with a patron about the experience they had at their restaurant.  I will NEVER, EVER take ANYONE to The Cheesecake Factory again.  I will NEVER recommend going there.  Absolutely deplorable service, and an even more awful dining experience."
Clint M.,"Houston, TX",390,509,188,1.0,6/2/2016,"I came here with some friends for a birthday dinner.  It was a ridiculously bad experience.  We were told there was a short wait and we'd be seated in 15 minutes.  20 minutes later, we checked and were told we'd be seated within another 15 minutes.  Another 20 minutes later (40 total), we checked in again and were told we'd be seated shortly.  It was literally an hour-long wait.  We'd told them we'd go elsewhere if there was going to be too long a wait, but they never once had the courtesy to be honest with us. They crammed the five of us into an awkwardly shaped table on the end of a curved half-booth that wasn't even big enough for four people.  We were cramped and service was slow, even though the restaurant didn't seem that crowded.  The server had little interest in taking care of us in a timely manner.  The food came out hot and tasted just fine, but the experience as a whole was just plain bad.  He ended up adding gratuity to the bill, probably because he knew we were pissed off and wouldn't be tipping well after the terrible service we received.  We were going to argue the added gratuity, but just paid it and decided that we'd never come back."
Wesley W.,"Leesville, LA",167,27,9,5.0,1/1/2017,"This place is amazing! Located inside the galleria, you feel like you are far away from the city. Very intimate and warm! Our waitress was very friendly, and she didn't question when I asked for a bowl of sliced lemons. She just kept them coming! We just had cheesecake, but that didn't slow down the service. We had them fast, and of course they were delicious. Perfect little stop while shopping!"
Tesia e.,"Houston, TX",67,74,174,2.0,6/22/2017,"I went last night for my boyfriend's birthday. I askex for a booth so a gentleman adked me to wait 5 mins so that one could be cleaned. We get to the booth and I had to use the Cloth napkin that they wrap the silverware with to clean the seats. The floor under the booth was very dirty as well. I hesitated to put my feet on the floor. The restaurant tends to be a bit on the pricey side for certain items.The restaurant doesn't live up to its hype. The Galleria location always disappoints me. I love getting Strawberry Martinis but theirs is very weak (It barely has alcohol in it) at that location and costs $11.25. Our waitress Mackenzie was very helpful but she's not the bartender. I sent my Martini back because it was weak and she brought another one but it was no better. I kept it to keep confusion down. My boyfriend ordered 2 as well thinking that the next one would be better thsn the first, but was also a fail. I paid $33.75 for 3 of those. The food was good this time. I had no issues. The bathroom was so disgusting. I could not believe my eyes. All of the stalls were disgusting as well. I will post pics. I hope that they can clean up their acts up there. I'm not interested in coming back to this location. I will stick to the Sugarland location where it is much cleaner and the drinks are worth my money."
Mohammed F.,"Houston, TX",25,1,,1.0,7/2/2017,"Our servers QUINCY C failed to get us plates or silverware. And after we asked for them he got us plates only and we had to fitch our silverware from the table next to us. Plus He passed our table at least 3 time without refilling my drink which I had to ask for...and when I told him that it was hands down the worst service I've had in my life, he was like ""oh that's too bad"" carelessly. I'm never going back to that place even though I loved their cheesecakes"
Graham O.,"Houston, TX",168,3,1,1.0,6/24/2017,Just ordered cheese cake factory on uber eats. Over priced and terrible quality are understatement. My gf paid 16 dollars for a lean cuisine quality meal. I paid 20 for something even worse. The mashed potatoes state like they are powdered. Will never eat at cheese cake factory again.
Dee F.,"TX, TX",15,30,25,2.0,7/12/2017,"A bit crowded for a Thursday night so I can't image the crowd on the weekend. With that said management needs to work on waiting area which is extremely limited and unorganized. My children hate being in crowds and that's exactly where we ended up. Not cool, literally!! The view and the cheesecake were on point hence the 2 stars."
Tim S.,"Houston, TX",833,19,10,2.0,6/14/2017,"When you come to the Cheesecake Factory you expect a certain standard. Even though the wait staff was very attentive, the food was prepared improperly and by the time I got mine the second time, my buddy was almost finished with his meal. A food runner brought the food out the second time and I never talked with a manager. (Mac and Cheese burger ordered Medium. Arrived Well Done and dry.)"
Nikki M.,"Houston, TX",201,17,11,1.0,6/9/2017,Took over 35min to complete a Togo order of salad and some veggie sides? Really? This is just horrid
Jon S.,"Missouri City, TX",0,7,1,1.0,8/1/2017,Unfortunately I can't give a 1/2 a star so now there's 1. Worst service ever you would think something in the gallery a would offer a lot better and when I received on my niece's birthday. Stay away go to a different restaurant
Stephanie J.,"New Braunfels, TX",2,11,1,2.0,5/16/2016,"I came yesterday afternoon with 3 girlfriends. I don't normally leave bad reviews, but the service is terrible. The food is great. Make sure you have everything you need when they drop food off, bc they won't be back for a long time (experienced this with app, entrees, and desserts). Also, we had to stack plates when finished and still the servers dropping food off did not pick them up - at edge of table. Had to wait for our server to finally come back (happened 3x) - which was not soon enough to ask for more sauce for the chicken dish bc food was eaten by the time he checked on us. Servers seem to have the ""not my table, not my  problem"" attitude. We needed water refills when entrees dropped off, but they were gone before we could ask.  We waited about 25 minutes for our entrees. They brought out the wrong entree for one of the four of us. She then had to wait another 25 minutes for her food. By the time it arrived we had all finished eating. She also requested the lunch portion, but was charged for the dinner portion.  I give our server the benefit of the doubt bc they seemed busy (keep in mind though, it was 4pm on a Sunday). Seems like a management issue since members of his (our server's) team couldn't care less about helping and making it a good experience. He seemed to be working hard and doing his best."
Bryan S.,"Dallas, TX",71,62,9,2.0,7/17/2017,Horrible service and the food at this location seems to be sub par. The Cheesecakes however are still amazing so my recommendation just come to this location for dessert.
Michelle A.,"Houston, TX",48,50,14,2.0,5/6/2017,We went up using the stairs. There was no one there to greet us. We had to wander around and figure out how to be seated. We were finally greeted and seated. The booth seats were covered in bread crumbs. I hate how they leave the silverware siting on the table. At least keep it wrapped in a napkin. The silverware always looks dirty. They gave us cold bread. The food was good; cleanliness and service not so much.
