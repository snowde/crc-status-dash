Aisha O.,"Houston, TX",389,141,163,5.0,3/8/2016,"Hey, boo! Yes, Cheesecake Factory. I'm talking to you! This is my place, chile! The food is overall good, it's usually a lively scene and service is good.  I first stumble across the CF when I was a 10 years old. I remember what I ordered, too. I had the Thai lettuce wraps for an app and the Jamaican black shrimp for an entree. (Yes, I was fancy). And now that I am 21*** I still love this place and frequent with family and friends. My favorite apps are the avocado rolls, the aforementioned Thai lettuce wraps, and I use to enjoy the pot stickers-when it was on the menu. My favorite entrees are the Jamaican black shrimp, any of the pasta dishes, and the baked salmon. My favorite dessert is the always dependable strawberry cheesecake and the sweet and velvety red velvet cheesecake. mmm, boy! Now, I'm keeping my review at 5 stars but, I have to admit, I've had some bad meals here and there. But this is not high class fine dining, and I've had many more good meal experiences than bad. So CF is still A-ok in my novella. :) Oh, and that complimentary brown and sourdough bread is the  . ***objects in mirror may be older than they appear."
Vy T.,"Washington, DC",89,20,,1.0,3/13/2017,"This place is run by racist a-holes. Here's how a friend of mine was treated when she went there. She's a veteran, law student, and an all-around decent person. 'While waiting for my order at The Cheesecake Factory, a customer demanded I wait somewhere else because he didn't want me nor my ""germs"" near him. When I refused, he stood up and told me he would move me himself. The manager approached, another customer approached, and DESPITE the other customer stating that I was not the aggressor and ""the gentleman at the bar was being rude."" The manager told me to wait in a corner of the restaurant because the other customer felt uncomfortable. When I decided that I would not be moved, the manager called the cops and told them to come and remove me from the restaurant. I left, found a corner on the side of the road, and cried. I've never felt so embarrassed, insignificant, and helpless.'"
Sarah Y.,"Houston, TX",255,2,2,1.0,10/14/2017,"This used to be one of my favorite date night spots. Unfortunately we won't be coming back. When we came in the hostess had to finish their conversation before seating us. When we were seated it took ten minutes to be greeted. Once greeted the server asked us our drinks and tried to hurry away once she received the drink order. I told her we were ready for starters, we ordered the artichokes that took forever to arrive and were burnt to a black crisp. We didn't complain and waited for our entrees. I ordered the scampi and steak Diana. I thought it came with noodles but instead it was just 3 shrimp soaked in a white sauce covering half the plate.  Its my fault for not asking if it did or didn't have noodles. But the server didn't know either once i did ask. So I ordered some angel hair on the side to add to my plate of sauce. By the time the noodles arrived my bf was finished eating and my excitement to ever eat here again had vanished. It took forever! She brought it with a side of the scampi sauce obviously made by another cook because it was a completely different color. My bf only ate his strip steak and mashed potatoes but not his green beans because they were Raw. When we walked out I finally saw a manager hanging by the stairs chatting it up with a server. It wasn't worth complaining about at that point. The entire place needs to go through training again including management as well as the kitchen.  The only reason we'll ever come back is for cheesecake togo."
Jorge A.,"Houston, TX",415,148,50,4.0,4/19/2017,"I've recently become hooked to this place again. I definitely prefer this location over the Memorial City Mall location too. On my most recent visit, I did take out, and the girl who took the order was super, super nice, despite the place being incredibly busy as usual. Although I have had a few different things from this place, lately I've been addicted to their spicy chipotle chicken pasta (at least I think that's what it's called) . It's SO GOOD!!!! I had to get cheesecake after having a staring contest with the display cases of cheesecakes, and got my usual Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake. I love Reeses' peanut butter cups, peanut butter, and Butterfingers, and this cheesecake has them all. I've had plenty of other cheesecakes from here as well, but this one is my favorite yet. Both the food and cheesecake was super tasty as usual for me. The downsides would be how this place is always packed, but what can you expect when it's attached to the Galleria? Also, I was specifically asked if I wanted bread and butter to go, I said yes, but didn't get any. Still, I'll definitely be back."
Nancy L.,"Houston, TX",1,7,,1.0,9/22/2016,"Where to start????? I was SHOCKED with their service today. My fiancé decided to meet and have lunch at this place since he s been there few times and enjoyed their food. Service was ok, lousy but nothing new, considering other reviews. He ordered so called ""famous meet loaf"" that he usually liked before, but it tasted so bad that he couldn't chew a single bite. I dared to try, and something was seriously wrong with the taste. So, normally, I wanted him to return a plate and talk to manager, but he refused to make a scene. He decided to tell waitress about it, but she couldn't care less. He had to repeat twice that something is wrong with the meat, and her only reply was"" So....You don't want this for to go""??? WOW !!!!!!  Obviously, he got upset, paid our check, and we left.  I can't believe how ignorant and low class this place is or become. Not even single ""thank you"" on our way out!! We both work in high end stores in same mall as this restaurant, and by God, we will never recommend this place to anybody. This Galleria Mall location is disaster!!!!"
Lori C.,"Madisonville, LA",0,18,,3.0,10/15/2017,"Food was good!  Service was friendly, but I wish people would write the order down. Inevitably, they waste time coming back to clarify, or the order is wrong, our situation was the first."
Brittany L.,"Houston, TX",1,13,24,4.0,3/11/2016,"Good food, service and environment. Came on a Saturday night, wait was 15 minutes for a party of 2. (They don't do reservations) Because the menu is HUGE, my boyfriend and I had very low expectations. We had the Crispy fried cheese (aka mozzarella sticks) for starters. Very good, and pretty light for it being fried food. We had to ask for extra marinara sauce bc it was so chunky and not really sauce-like textured.  I ordered a ""factory combination""-Shrimp scampi & Steak Diane w/ mash potatoes. The mash potatoes were FIVE STARS! The steak was flavorful, but the shrimp scampi was not in my favor. I assumed it came with Angel hair pasta just like it does alone on the menu, and every other restaurant but it was just the shrimp by it self.  My boyfriend got the Rib-eye steak w/ mash potatoes and Mac & Cheese. FIVE STAR MEAL! Next time I'm getting what he got! Steak was cooked to perfection. The sides had nice flavor and texture.  Overall, we will definitely be back!"
Rajata K.,"Houston, TX",284,95,29,3.0,10/7/2016,"It's a three star because it's a hit or miss when you come here. The last time it was a Saturday and I understand that it's busy ,since I also work in the food industry, but my food had to have been sitting under the heat lamp for more than 15 minutes because my prosciutto to be as dry as leather, the arugula have been wilted, the sauce had crusted into the noodles and the dish."
Sarah N.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,1.0,3/14/2017,"When an African-American friend was harassed and physically threatened by another patron, who demanded that she not stand near him because he didn't want her or her ""germs"" near him, the management told her to wait in a corner because she was making the man who had threatened her ""uncomfortable"".  When she refused to be pushed into a corner, the restaurant called the cops on her.   Apparently, this restaurant's a good place to patronize if you're a racist jerk.  Otherwise, steer clear."
Yashee M.,"Westside, Houston, TX",0,8,,4.0,10/10/2017,Classic Cheesecake Factory. Very large menu. I had one of the largest salads of my life and ate way too much bread!
Maria S.,"Houston, TX",3,68,39,1.0,4/16/2017,"Stopped by for a late dinner, everything was going good until my son pointed at the floor and there was a cockroach under the empty table next to us. We quickly asked for the check and left."
B. C.,"Houston, TX",0,21,,2.0,6/27/2017,Ordered the chicken chili to go. The rice was mixed in with the chili so of course my rice arrived soggy. I have never had rice mixed in with sauce in a to go order.  I also did not received my complimentary bread as requested.
Audra P.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/2/2017,"I brought my family to eat at the Cheesecake, Galleria and the service was awful!!!! The food is great but the service just SUCKS!!"
JJ P.,"Houston, TX",3,17,87,5.0,8/16/2016,Bartender Anna and manager Red made my experience amazing! Had the skinnylicious salmon rolls and Tuscan chicken but the highlight was definitely the pineapple cucumber Mojito Anna created for me!!! I'll definitely be back!
David K.,"Houston, TX",2,9,2,1.0,7/30/2016,"It starts with the waiting process, they give you a buzzer and when that goes off, you wait with 20-30 other people for them to call your name again. Why not just get the table when the buzzer goes off? This place is overcrowded and the two person seats are all right next to each other. It's impossible not to hear your neighbors' conversations, which also means no privacy for yourself.  I ordered a drink and it was completely wrong, for $11 I would expect a little better. Took about 10 minutes from when we sat down to get the waiter and another 10 minutes to get water. Bread came around 15 minutes after that."
Saar J.,"Houston, TX",20,25,14,2.0,4/11/2017,We usually go to Grand Lux but we wanted to switch things up. Never again!! Both our orders were wrong and our fries were cold. When my friend got her burger back the bacon on it was stone cold. Not a pleasant experience at all. The server let the manager know we were unhappy and the manager offered us free cake to go which is the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of one. Even though they didn't have the cake we wanted. Just walk across the street and go to Grand Lux.
Susan F.,"San Antonio, TX",60,62,34,2.0,10/22/2016,Ok food. AWFUL service. Waited forever for drink order. Finally had to call another server over to place our order. They could not find our waitress. Service was very very slow. I understand they are busy. I ordered the beef burger with grilled onions.  The berger was good but the onion was 1 very thickly cut onion. The tomato was also very thick. Burger was do thick I could not fit it into my mouth. It was just too much  Very awkward to eat in front of guests unless you have a very large mouth.
A K.,"Houston, TX",0,16,,1.0,4/26/2017,"Horrible staff.  Very sloppy, unorganized, unprofessional, rude.  We went somewhere else that treats guests with respect, and warm welcoming.   Extremely disappointed, and will never return, even if they pay me."
Randy E.,"Makati, Philippines",96,34,138,5.0,1/12/2016,"Ordered an unassuming taco from their menu and was given a huge plate of delicious food! I was in the restaurant for a ""light"" lunch and a slice of cheesecake and I almost couldn't walk from fullness.  The waiter was very nice and suggested that 1/2 of my cheesecake be placed on a takeout box. Why didn't I think of that?"
