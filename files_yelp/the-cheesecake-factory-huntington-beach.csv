Kent V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1001,293,695,4.0,12/11/2017,"Great overlooked brunch spot on Sundays....come early when they open and it will be empty, can even get nice seating on the patio. Came here with a party of 8, including a baby w/ stroller and they definitely accommodated us in a corner outside table with no one around. Great service and the food is good.  They recently took out all the calorie counts next to each item, it's in a separate menu now. If you are a calorie counter or health conscience DO NOT look a the nutritional information menu. This restaurant has the most unhealthy food items, for example, Monte Cristo Sandwich 1620 calories, breakfast burrito 2000+ calories...it will make your stomach cringe."
Sarah S.,"Fullerton, CA",814,169,163,2.0,12/24/2017,"Im so disappointed.  The menu was very misleading.  The food was okay but WAYYY too overpriced for what youre getting. When they brought me my food, I thought it was a joke.. The menu explains what shrimp scampi (shrimp, angel hair, white wine, etc) is and explains what the steak is (mushrooms, onions, etc).  I got the combination shrimp scampi and steak and was so shocked when i saw the dish. There were three small chunks of steak on the right and 3 pieces of shrimp on the left all for a spanking $22. No pasta, just three pieces of shrimp. This was a waste of money and time. Our party waited an hour for thus.  The service was great and very attentive but when I asked for a to go box, they didnt pack my shrimp and threw it away, just the steak..  A plus is the fresh, hot and crunchy sourdough with butter they give you but that was probably the best part of the meal and it was free."
Natalie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,118,87,3.0,12/5/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurant chains. Unfortunately, my experience last time was mediocre. Below is the breakdown. Food This is why I marked down the restaurant two stars. I didn't want cheese or chicken in my burrito grande. Since I was taking out TWO ingredients, I asked the waiter if we could substitute the chicken with guacamole.  He later came back saying that management said no because guacamole is expensive. I would have agreed with him, BUT I was removing chicken which just as expensive as guacamole. The waiter was nice in the way he told me, but this decision by management was unreasonable. Overall, the food was decent. I am not sure I will be returning to this location since they weren't flexible with substituting the chicken.  Service Our waiter was very polite. He refilled our drinks constantly and was overall chipper. My family and I came here on a Sunday evening and were seated right away."
Monica H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,53,82,4.0,1/2/2018,I've been here a couple of times. One of my gfs and I had our usual for dinner Chicken Bellagio. This location is great like the one in Arcadia and Brea.
Hung C.,"Westminster, CA",72,6,1,3.0,12/24/2017,"I have came here for dinner 3 times and so far, everything is not too bad. The food quality mostly based on your decision what is good to get. The steak and pasta is pretty on point. I enjoyed the ""Diane steak"", chicken nuggets and the eggrolls samplers. Do not get the ""Factory burger"", the bun is not soft ""burger bun""; it is like French baguette, a hard, solid, dry piece of French baguette that can be used to break the window. My teeth get hurt on the first bite. It feels like biting a fricking piece of wood. Totally ruined our Chirstmas dinner. The service was doing a very good job."
Amanda A.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,78,73,2.0,9/17/2017,"I came to this specific Cheesecake Factory location after a hiatus from Cheesecake Factory in general because my last visits hadn't been particularly good. I decided to try this one because it looked really nice from the outside, so I wanted to give it a go.  We began by ordering something from a temporary/new menu, $5 'Nashville Hot' Chicken Nuggets. These were surprisingly good and probably the highlight of our dinner. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very tender. The sauce was spicy and really good. I also think it was a generous sized portion for $5. It went really well with the sauce. I liked it!  Then, we decided to try Chicken Madeira (chicken, asparagus, melted mozzarella with mashed potatoes and mushroom madeira sauce) and the Chicken Riesling (chicken, mushrooms, bacon, garlic, white whine cream sauce and buttered parmesan pasta) , another new item.  Considering the average price of these two dishes, I unfortunately have to say the flavours were clearly lacking. Both dishes were very under seasoned, the buttered parmesan pasta was basically just cold (!) pasta which made the dish kind of dry overall. The sauces for both dishes were vey watery/had no flavour and the Chicken Madeira felt very greasy with the mozzarella because it was more cheese than chicken. I know this is a chain restaurant, but the two main entrees were disappointing to say the least. Overall, the only thing we felt was worth stopping here for was the nuggets."
Leslie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",675,535,469,5.0,8/31/2017,"Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in awhile. The high prices and giant portions are too intimidating. However, when I can come here and work is paying I am all for it! We arrived during the weekday for lunch and it was pretty packed! I asked if we could wait for a booth and they told us there was no wait so that was good. We ordered some apps including the crab cakes, ahi tuna, and their signature avocado egg rolls. The apps were all delicious but you just can't beat the egg rolls! Maybe there was some misunderstanding but the waitress never came by to take my main meal order. We had to stop her when she was rushing by us. Not only that but I got my order put in so late that by the time it arrived I was full from all the apps and I had to go back to work. So I just had them pack it up right away. I told the waiter if I knew the food would have taken so long I would have ordered it to go. I enjoyed the fish tacos later in the week and they at least were delicious! I also ordered the Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake slice to go and it was as delicious as I remember it. I will be back again soon!"
LaWanda T.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,29,3,1.0,1/7/2018,"This was the absolute worst experience I've ever had at the CHEESECAKE FACTORY! We WERE ignored and treated like crap! when our food did arrive ... 45 minuets later! It was cold and soggy and stuck to the plate!  TMI but I will share! The women restroom was beyond disgusting!  Each stall was disgusting and filthy ! A truck stop restroom would have been better. There is a saying... When the restroom is dirty, the other area ""kitchen ""will be dirty! I should have followed my first mind and left !"
Grace C.,"Orange County, CA",29,1040,278,4.0,8/27/2017,Been here many times now. Large entrees and appetizers are good to share. We like the complimentary bread. Service has been good though slower some evenings. We've liked everything we've ordered so far: -corn tamale cakes -thai lettuce wraps - mushroom burger -chicken marsala -various pasta and salads -and various cheesecakes.
Angie M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",160,1230,4820,4.0,6/7/2017,"1pm on a Saturday, we came in with a party of 8 and had no problems getting a table.  We were quoted a 10 minute wait, but it was maybe 5.  The restaurant was not too crowded from what I could see. Our waitress was good about doing separate checks in the groups we asked.  Sometimes wait staff gets annoyed by that, but in my opinion its a lot easier when more than one person has to pay for a check.  Less aggravation in the end, in my opinion. I ordered a water, and noticed my straw had lipstick on it.  Or something, that looked like lipstick.  They come in the drinks, not in a wrapper.  Totally grossed me out, and I asked for an entirely  new water. I ordered the Orange Chicken.  I havent been to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time... and couldnt remember if I liked the Orange Chicken.  It was between that and fish tacos.  When my dish came, I asked for an extra side of the sauce for the chicken.  It wasnt dry tasting, it just didnt have much sauce on it, and I wanted more, for flavor and to add it with my rice as well. The service was good, always had full drinks, and our waitress was friendly and consistent. Not in the area often, but I would return here. I skipped the cheesecake... was with a group of girls bridesmaid dress shopping, and they were all behaving, so I decided to as well.  (BOO lol)"
Monica N.,"Westminster, CA",4,5,2,3.0,1/4/2018,"Came here and waited quite a bit for my food, I was really looking forward to it. I got the Farfalle pasta and the sauce was pretty good; however, a down side was the pasta itself. When the food came out it looked very delicious, but when I went in for a bite the pasta noodle was very hard. I would of rather just waited a little longer for the pasta to be nice and soft than hard. I know the pasta isn't always like this because I've been here previously and had really good pasta. I guess it was just a busy Thursday night and the chefs were rushing on making the food. As of the service, the waiter was very polite and checked up on us quite often."
Kristine M.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,2,2.0,10/7/2017,"First I like to say we live very close to all the restaurants, we can eat anywhere. But my husband said let's order from Cheesecake, I didn't really want to order from them in the morning, had a feel it wasn't gonna be that fresh.  Well I order Chinese chicken salad, the chicken was old not fresh and very dry. Chinese chicken salad is a easy dish, they can't even do that right.  2nd my 14 year old daughter had the kids brunch, she loves fruit and it did come with fruit, she said I'm not eating that fruit, looks like the fruits they put into the Sangira drink, sure enough "" it is"". That's not fruit for kids, what a joke.  Even a 14 year old girl knew what kind of fruit are in the Sangira drink. Just shows you, can't cheat the customers with crappy not fresh foods.  Not coming back for a while, I feel Panera Bread has way better Chinese Chicken salad, their salad and meats are super fresh.  Thank goodness we have many choices."
Yanzhi X.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,18,9,1.0,1/3/2018,"Worst service ever. If I can give them 0 star I would.Told our server we were in a hurry, she said there's nothing she could do about it... seriously? While we ate there, not even once checked in is. When we asked for the bill and paid cash, we never got our change back.... did we tell you you could keep the change? I don't think so. Thank you Cheesecake Factory, you can have your business else where."
U S C. J.,"Westminster, CA",27,102,8,2.0,11/30/2017,"I used to go to cheesecake factory fairly often in the past but not as much in recent years.  About a week ago, we came here for dinner on a Monday night and the experience has gone down :( Our server was not pleasant and seem to have a much of an attitude..hmm not good. I feel like its over price for the dishes that we ordered.  Hubby got the fettuccine with a coke, and I got ahi salad  and it was ~ $50 - a slice of macadamia was almost $10- geez!"
Katelin N.,"Garden Grove, CA",419,124,18,4.0,9/27/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the places I go to when I seriously don't know what I'm craving because it has a variety of everything. You got burgers, pasta, pizza, desserts, drinks, salad, rice dishes, protein dishes, brunch, low calorie dishes, appetizers, etc etc! This list goes on forever!! I actually get so sick of looking at the menu because it's loaded with items. Luckily I have been there so often that I know what I truly like and order every time I go. They always give you some bread to start off. All of my family and friends love love love the sweet moist wheat bread. We don't care much for the white bread. I usually get the tropical tea which is a passion unsweetened tea. My family and friends like the Tex mex bites for appetizer. They're like Mexican egg rolls if you will. Super flavorful! For my main course, I would usually go with the jambalaya pasta! So good and full of Cajun flavor. However there are times where it doesn't have enough flavor... but nonetheless that is my favorite dish there. Some other dishes that I've tried that I thought is also worth trying are: chicken chipotle pasta, the salads, and their skinnilicious menu which is their low calorie menu.   Of course they have their cheesecake as their main dessert. To me cheesecake is delicious at the first few bites but gets too overwhelming after eating too much but definitely try their cheesecake and don't try to eat the whole thing to yourself."
Jad D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,17,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Bummed at this place. My 10 year old & I stopped by after the Rose Bowl.  The wait for a table outside wasn't bad.  Unfortunately, when we got to our table outside, we waited for over 10 minutes & no one asked for our drink order.  That's not too long, but the real annoying part was that the waitress went to the table right next to us 4 times in about 10 minutes and never cared to say anything to my son & I. I told the manager & then split to a restaurant next door.  Won't be back to this place."
Tamara T.,"Santa Ana, CA",413,910,2114,4.0,11/3/2017,"My favorite place to go to off Disneyland property but within walking distance is the Cheesecake Factory. I've been going here since it first opened and it's consistently busy but the wait is usually manageable. I highly recommend the happy hour at the bar from 4 - 6 p.m, as the appetizers are $5.95 and they have drink specials as well. Came here yesterday and met up with my sister for happy hour at the bar. We were able to find a seat easily and our bartender was very attentive and took our order right away. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, chicken sliders and regular beef sliders and couldn't finish it all. I recommend the chicken sliders as they come with deep fried chicken breast that has a slight pepper/paprika flavor and is very tasty! The breast was dry but the thousand island, pickles and tomato made up for it. Still a great and classy place to get a drink and a meal for cheaper than the Disneyland Resort prices."
Song L.,"Westminster, CA",120,168,101,1.0,8/29/2017,"After tonight, I have different views of this place.  Our server Ryan D ""greeted"" us and was practically talking to himself and was very hostile. When we asked for small extra things, it felt as if we were bothering him. Even when we thanked him for helping us, he brushed us off as if we just insulted him. Trying to get a hold of him for to go boxes and check was impossible because he was nowhere to be found.  Service plays a big role when you dine at a place. Not only do customers pay for food but also for the service as well. Our service tonight was unacceptable and we didn't enjoy our meal as we would have wanted to."
Deanna M.,"Long Beach, CA",2,1,,3.0,12/31/2017,This location is ny favorite! The wait is never too long and the food is always great. A friend and I decided to bring our children here for dinner. We order our drinks and appetizers and food. Everything is going well so far. My friend offered a pasta dish which she says is way too salty. I try it and agree. When we told the waitress she said someone else at another table said the pasta was very salty as well. The pasta was sent back and taken off the bill. The manager said the pasta water was salty but not the dish. Pasta craving killed.
Jannie P.,"Santa Ana, CA",97,43,55,1.0,4/6/2017,"There was a bug in my margarita!!!  Even though I enjoyed the food here, I thought the service was pretty bad.  Found a bug in my drink, told the server, but he just took the glass and walked away.  He did removed the drink from my bill, but i think an apology would be appropriate.  However, the server didn't say anything even after we showed him a snap of the drink with the bug in it.  He just laughed it off.  I recommend the Steak Diane and Pasta Da Vinci Didn't get yo try any cheesecake since i was pretty grossed out by the bug"
Lena N.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,9,4,1.0,12/15/2017,"The host stand has no communication. They told me my wait was going to be 20 minutes but it was extended to an hour without them telling me. I asked and asked and they kept saying ""we are getting the table ready"" but it does not take about 40 minutes to get ready. Definitely wasted my time"
Cam C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",520,579,974,2.0,2/7/2017,"We had a $25 dollar gift card so decided to come here for dinner. Even with the card, our meal came out to $33 including tax and tip and we only ordered 3 items, no dessert: calamari, a burger, and shrimp scampi pasta. They dropped off our water first and we couldn't find anyone afterwards to ask for straws. They never brought us our bread and we had to ask for it after finally locating our server. The fries they brought with the burger were extremely stale but they happily brought a salad to make amends for the staleness.  Portions are always gigantic, but the experience here was not as pleasant as some of the other places I've visited."
Travis C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",21,319,347,5.0,3/16/2017,"Come on now. Really? You need a review for the Cheesecake Factory? Doesn't everyone already know how great this place is? The servers have to know the whole menu, all the ingredients, and how to pair it with wine. So let's start with that. Now every time I've been here, at least a dozen times, my server was friendly and accommodating to any and all needs. The food is always good here. The only downside you might have is that it wasn't the best dish you could've ordered for your taste buds.  Now the cheesecake... most of the cheesecakes here are amazing when you look at them through the glass, & it's hard to choose just one. I've had at least 10 different types and I think they were all delicious. I've had cheesecake in Manhattan, New York. It's very dense & rich. The original cheesecake here comes very close. I like the mixed cheesecakes like the peanut butter, or chocolate mouse, or red velvet. Basically I like them all. Try your favorite flavored cheesecake and see for yourself. I'm out. My food just arrived so..."
Basem T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",69,210,466,4.0,7/30/2017,Stopped in to get some lunch and take advantage of the half price cheesecake they were having.  We had the kids chicken sliders with fries which was plenty of food for our son.  My wife had the lunch miso salmon with white rice & she said the salmon was perfectly cooked and delicious.  I decided to go with a brunch item - the chicken and waffles benedict with breakfast potatoes & it was delicious.  The fried chicken was tasty and waffles fluffy and the breakfast potatoes were nice and crispy.  We ordered the s'mores cheesecake which was crazy decadent.
Anastasia M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",169,1,1,5.0,12/9/2017,"So for starters our server Austin was amazing, suggested amazing foods and was very friendly and funny. He made sure our waters were always full, and our food was amazing. I've been to other Cheesecake's and he's been the best server I've had so far. He suggested an amazing raspberry lemon cheesecake that is the most flavorful and light tasting cheesecake I've ever had. He's very kind and funny, such a great server!"
A M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12,40,8,1.0,12/19/2017,Disappointed in the service tonight. Restaurant doesn't seem busy. Only saw the waiter once when he took our orders after waiting 15 min from seat time.
Freddy K.,"Gardena, CA",33,26,19,5.0,7/14/2017,"Always a friendly staff always very helpful.  Was there for lunch today with a friend, the waitress recommended a plate from their new special menu. Grilled chicken parmesan like pizza. So good I recommend everyone to try it. Never had a bad a desert at this place.  Will be back soon"
Melody M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/25/2017,"My daughter and I decided to have Christmas eve dinner here after shopping. I'm so glad we chose this restaurant. We have been to other CCFactory's before, but this was the best! From the service (the server was excellent) to the food everything was perfect! That is rare. The salad and veggies were so fresh....(we are picky veggie eaters) Thank you for a great Christmas Eve  experience!"
Tamara-Michele C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",718,68,12,5.0,11/22/2017,"One of my favorite places to come!! I'm so glad there is a Cheesecake Factory so close to me. Whenever I have family or friends stay with me from out of town, we always bring them here! Great food, great service, fairly fast, we are always happy! I absolutely love how many different cheesecakes you have and I swear the menu continues to grow every time we go in there! Love the variety!! Keep it coming and WE will keep coming!"
Raychel R.,"Long Beach, CA",38,54,322,5.0,7/31/2017,"Came in for dinner and cheesecake for national cheesecake day! The food was delicious as always and our server Quinn was absolutely amazing. We ordered the Peach Smoothie, Crispy Cuban Rolls, Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club sandwich, and the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta.  The Smoothie was really good especially with the raspberry syrup swirled inside. (Be sure to mix it up before drinking!) The Rolls came with 6 and tasted like mini Cuban sandwiches. The Club was served with fries and I was pleasantly surprised with how moist the chicken was. The Pasta had a nice kick to it and the sauce was very good. As always, the portions at CF are quite hefty, so we ended up getting our half priced slices of cheesecake to go. My bf ordered the classic Strawberry cheesecake, while I ordered the very magical Lemon-Raspberry!!! Nom nom nom.  We also decided to try the new Celebration cheesecake which was ""different"" but tasty nonetheless. It's more cakey with mouse layered in it and I think the cake was funfetti...which is always good in my book. Overall, had a really great time and will definitely come back again!"
Lisa V.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",42,12,23,5.0,8/28/2017,"Honestly....""Cheesecake"", any restaurant that has this word in their Title is sure to be a hit with The Ladies So I must admit, there was a point in my life when I was a single mother of 3 that I could not even imagine dining at such a Prestigious Restaurant. In my mind you had to have the Big Bucks to eat there.  That was okay though, I realized I needed to live up to it, and I did. No shame in that. Since I am new to the ""Yelping"" community....lol, I just started about 3 weeks ago to pretty much Give Credit Where Credit is DUE.  That's all.  My husband has been ""Yelping I guess since 2015"" and since he spends hours on his phone posting this and that I figured what the heck, can't beat um...join um.  So here I am and I realized it does make a difference. I don't review establishments for my personal gain as some do....I honestly give my opinion about my ""Experience"".  With that said, I have to admit, The Cheesecake Factory is One of My Top Five choices to dine. I am very picky. I figure if I work hard to earn my income when I do spend it, it should be spent well. I have always believed we as consumers can pretty much have whatever we want....for a price.  Now to my review. I have been to several Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and their service is consistant throughout. More recently My Mother-in-Law have been able to enjoy each others company and we have made several lunch and brunch dates to The Cheesecake Factory.  You can't go wrong.  The building,  the decor, the service, the professionalism of their employees and my favorite,  their incredible freshlu cooked meals are worth every cent. They have an extensive menu, their employees are well groomed,cordial and attentive to their customers.  Their Decor and cleanliness is very appealing as it should be. After a meal, you still have the opportunity to stop by their bakery which has a plithera of cheekcake choices.....If you have a sweettooth or a weakness for Cheeskake.....""Walk Away from the Counter.....slowly""....lol Cheesecake Factory is a must! Bon-appetite! Lisa"
Elaine L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/4/2018,"Had dinner last night with my husband and the kids, our waitress, whom I cannot remember her name, was extremely rude and careless. We asked for extra drestand she never came back. We ordered some drinks and she never came back to offer a refill. She was pushing and shoving our dishes in between our drinks. It seemed as if she wanted us out asap. I love Cheesecake Factory but this location always offers low quality customer service."
Tish S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",45,202,170,5.0,12/9/2017,"I went to Cheesecake Factory to have an appetizer and drinks before a movie with my friend. We were so happy to not have to wait for a seat at the bar, becasue it was a Friday night. The bartenders were all friendly. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. They were served with chicken, three dipping sauces and sliced veggies. So good."
Susan S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Food: Miserable, ""0 Star"" Service: ~~~OK Do I Try Again in Next 2 Years: NOOOOOOOOP!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Jenny N.,"Cypress, CA",127,179,273,4.0,6/2/2017,"My favorite item here is the tamale cakes. Definitely worth coming for during happy hour, it's around 6 bucks! I've also had their pasta carbonara and the fettuccini alfredo. Both were good but the consistency was a bit watery. Also the portions here are huge."
Joeanthony J.,"Houston, TX",102,25,8,1.0,3/30/2017,"To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. We have come to this location numerous times (6+) over the past 5 months that we have lived in Huntington Beach. No visit has been spectacular but we enjoy the large selection that Cheesecake Factory has to offer.  On our last visit, I ordered a jambalaya pasta and the kitchen FORGOT TO OUT SAUCE on the pasta. I didn't bat an eye, mistakes happen. The waiter was less than apologetic and the manager didn't even bother to stop by. Unfortunately, it gets worse.  Last night, we brought some friends visiting from out of town here for dinner. I ordered a dish called ""bang bang chicken & shrimp."" I began eating, dish tasted ok but the flavor was definitely off... I go to take a bite of rice and notice something hard sticking out of my rice once I took a bite. Thinking it was starch from the bottom of the pan, I go to remove it. Much to my surprise IT WAS A HUGE WADDED PIECE OF PLASTIC WRAP. Not only was it disgusting that I had literally just eaten plastic, but it was extremely alarming that I was the first person to see this literally POKING OUT OF MY RICE! You can clearly tell this food is not made fresh daily..... The worst part of the whole experience was the manager who came over and tried to tell me that the plastic wrap was from the kitchen moving the rice from the pot to the plate so it wouldn't stick to the cooks hand. Could be believable EXCEPT IT WAS WADDED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RICE! So, either your manager was lying OR your cook out it there on purpose during the meal prep. Either way, it's disgusting. Check it out for yourself below..."
Tamara A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7,41,3,4.0,12/4/2017,Nice place for lunch or dinner. Recognizable chain. Can be pricey but that's expected. Cheesecakes never disappoint. Try the Pasta DaVinci. You won't be disappointed.
Alan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",569,177,1135,3.0,8/30/2016,"My parents wanted to take me out for Bday dinner.  I suggested that we should go to their fav restaurant and here we are. I've never been very fond of the service here.  Slow as hell and our waiter/waitress never to be seen after taking our order.  So as usual after taking our order, she completely forgot we asked for straws.  Then we waited over 20 min for her to reappear again so that we can ask for butter, bread, and lemon.  The servers were more helpful with the bread and butter. On to the food.  We ordered the ribeye with mash potato and cream corn, shrimp with angel hair, california omelette, kale salad, and two orders of the portobello, avacodo and zucchini fries.  The appetizers were good.  The kale salad and omelette was loved.  I thought the rib eye was a bit salty and the shrimp was very dry on the angel hair. We again waited for the waitress to come back so we can get togo boxes and check (another 15min)  I guess if you have a lot of time to kill come eat here.  If not I recommend another spot that won't take long.   Overall I only come here with my family other then that I wouldn't dream of coming here lol.  Just too many great restaurants around here to wait and wait for service and pay premium prices for mediocre food."
Connor M.,"Concord, CA",3,5,,1.0,11/28/2017,"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I love The Cheesecake Factory, but this particular one is a mess. I work nearby, and they have never once- not once, in 2 years- gotten our order right. The food, even though it is pick up, is tepid at best, and often just cold. I imagine that if you are going here to eat in person, it might be a better experience, but the inability to get a to go order right is infuriating. This happened today, and the manager could not have cared less. Though it is close by and theoretically convenient for our company when we have large lunch orders, I will ensure we do not return to this place and encourage you to spend your money where the customer is cared for."
Roberta A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",13,17,3,1.0,12/1/2017,Third time in a row terrible service and cold food served over 30 minutes after ordering. To top it off appetizers were brought last!  Asked for manager but he never came.  We are done with this chain establishment.
