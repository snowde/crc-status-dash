Mark K.,"Huntington Beach, United States",54,41,23,5.0,26/12/2016,Great service by Marissa. Love the green corn tamales patties.  So flavorfull.  Great bar scene.
Debbie S.,"Lake Forest, United States",12,10,1,5.0,30/3/2017,"Monte was very nice and attentive! He had a great attitude and a great smile! I'm very happy with my experience here! Good came out great and even though we only drank water, he was sure to keep our glasses full. Definitely asking for him next time we come! (:"
Rachel H.,"Lake Forest, United States",280,3,,5.0,30/3/2017,"Love this place, always delicious and consistent. Shoutout to Monte for the wonderful service!"
K T.,"Westminster, United States",29,24,1,2.0,31/7/2017,"I don't know why this particular location has such a bad service :( I know cheesecake is always packed but it's not an excuse to get such a lousy service. Our server rushed us to ordering our food, then when we finally ordered she on forgot a couple of stuff we requested. She also never offered the dessert menu, we had to ask. To top it all off, she didn't even bother saying the cheesecake was half off today, we only find out when we were about to leave. So we ended up buying more cheesecake at the counter."
Melissa L.,"South Pasadena, United States",0,14,8,2.0,8/1/2017,I normally love Cheesecake Factory. But this location was disappointing. Came for an early dinner at 4 with a girlfriend and they weren't very busy. I understand if maybe they were short on staff BUT we never received bread..I had to ask halfway through our meal. My friend's food was wrong and my plate was lacking an ingredient. The staff should know what comes in the dishes. We were hardly checked on. It was a very unsatisfying dinner at this location.
Michelle K.,"Park City, United States",67,194,2,2.0,10/11/2016,"I like this restaurant in general and have gone to a few establishments so have always liked Cheesecake BUT this location doesn't seem competent.  I went in for my birthday with my whole family and we had bought a few of those gift cards.  There were a total of 4-5 cards with $25 on them each.   When we went to ring it up, they had forgotten to put credit on the last card.  During the confusion, they had charged our credit card with the rest of the balance.  When we went to talk to them about this, the Manager had to call the gift card hotline (?) and was on hold for a good 20-30 mins.  Mind you, this was almost 10 pm and the restaurant was really slowing down.  At the last 10 mins of it, I told him we didn't have the time to sit there as my daughter was WAY past her bedtime and crying like crazy.  Even though the manager saw how unhappy she was and my family was waiting at the table and the other half in the lobby for this mess, he proceeded to stay on the phone as he seemed to not understand the whole situation.   Really frustrated at that point, I told him to just call me once it's resolved and he made this long excuse about how they have to call the hotline, request for credit on the gift card then refund my credit card...yadda yadda yadda.  I walked out really frustrated but tried to remember that this was my birthday and we were there to celebrate and not spend 30 mins of my life over some mistake they made.  They reversed all the charges but left a bad taste in how incompetent their manager is...at least don't waste the customer's time!"
Jo R.,"Westminster, United States",1,27,10,2.0,25/6/2017,"I got the Steak Diane & Herbed Salmon and it was just okay. The Steak Diane had some flavoring, but I feel you can make something similar at home. The Salmon was bland and dry. The mashed potato was also very bland and tasteless. For $22, I wouldn't come back to eat mediocre food. The environment was nice, but the food sucked."
Thien N.,"Fountain Valley, United States",0,5,3,5.0,10/4/2017,"Took family there for a night out on Saturday and as expected was very busy.  Check in was simple although the 15mins wait time seemed much longer.  Server was good, kids food was as well.  Had mac n  cheese, spaghetti with marinara, prime rib, pork chop and salad.  Food portion was generous and bill was reasonable. Exceptional rating due to wife leaving her LV wallet there and it was recovered the next day with all the cards, ids and money.  Amazing. Thank you - tn"
Chelsea M.,"Long Beach, United States",195,3,1,2.0,9/4/2017,Usually love The Cheesecake Factory go to this specific location probably 3-4 times a month. But after my experience the past two times I'm not sure how much longer I'll be coming back to this one. Last night I took my grandparents there to dinner. Only waited about 15 minutes to get sat but once sat it took someone 10 minutes to greet us and another 10 minutes to bring our drink and bread. We did not see our waiter for another 25 minutes to order. After that our food took forever and he never came by to ask if we wanted refills or more bread we had to stop bussers to ask them to refill us. When it came to bringing our bill he was obviously more attentive because he wanted a better tip.. food was delicious as usual just service was a total turn down. Won't be returning to this Cheesecake anytime soon..
Ying L.,"Seal Beach, United States",39,237,226,1.0,9/8/2015,We dined at this location many times before. We got seated right away this time because we got here are around 5pm.  It took a while for the service to come to greet us for our drink order.  Then it took her a long while to bring us our water and to take our orders.  The bread never came and we have to flag someone to bring them.  I ordered a lemonade and it never came until I asked for it...which was 25 mins after we sat down!!!!! Service is just horrible here. The server was unfriendly!  It took forever to get our check and a box for our leftover.  There are many choices in the area which offer better service than here.
Catlynn Y.,"Huntington Beach, United States",30,1,,1.0,20/8/2017,"I love this place and the service is mostly okay, but the waiter James was beyond awful. He took forever, and when he gave me my change back he gave me all 1's and even STOLE money. My change was 11.43 and he gave me 11 back. i know it's only 43 cents but homeboy didn't deserve it. he can include that 43¢ into his $1 tip lol. that $1 is pretty generous too. just like this one star."
Cindi Y.,"Long Beach, United States",2,4,,1.0,11/3/2017,"My husband and I waited for over half an hour for our food and when it finally came out, it was a mess. I ordered my chicken dry with a side of plain rice. The juice from the chicken completely drenched the rice, and the chicken was inedible. It was very disappointing. Their food is a bit pricey so I expect high quality meals. I have ordered this dish in the past, but it's never the same. The consistency of quality is just not there. To top it off, our server was not terribly pleasant. She seemed annoyed. I shared with her that the chicken was inedible, and she just asked if I wanted her to take the plate."
Angel P.,"Maricopa, United States",14,22,7,4.0,19/2/2017,Food came out burnt but the manager and the server were sure to correct and over compensate for the mistake. Will definitely be returning for the service alone
Alicia M.,"San Diego, United States",35,100,7,2.0,23/7/2016,"I had to call 3 times to get my order through for pick up at their curbside delivery service. 1st I was transferred to a line no-one picked up the phone. 2nd time I was transferred again and the person hung up on me. The 3rd time I got through and was finally able to give my order.   The food was ok.  Nothing special. I'm not a huge fan of CCF. Their stuff is overpriced and the food experience feels manufactured/processed.  I was picking up dinner to take to my Mama and I know she'll eat her favorite dish there.  Overall, Meh"
Sherrie S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,15,1,1.0,17/10/2016,"Went in Saturday just before 5 and had an awful experience. Half the restaurant was empty, but we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. Then they tried to stuff us into a 2 top in between a bunch of people. We asked if we could have a booth and got attitude from Host. Then we had to wait 10 more minutes to be seated, then they put us back in the bar right by the serving area and got to watch and listen to several employees socialize and flirt while we had to wait forever for just water. Food then took forever. Bread was stale. Very poorly run location, they can't even get it right with only 1/2 the place full."
Vanessa C.,"Los Angeles, United States",219,29,59,3.0,30/7/2016,I've been to multiple locations of Cheesecake Factory and I must say this one is my least favorite. It took a while for our waitress to come around since we wanted to get some condiments for our food. My garlic noodles were very saucey and watered down and not quite how it is usually made. I must say I am very disappointed in these noodles.
Tamara M.,"Laguna Niguel, United States",212,6,,2.0,11/8/2017,"I ordered the shrimp tacos; they were terrible, had a strong soapy taste, covered by the fragrant corn of the tortilla. The waiter didn't seem to care when I told him they weren't good, plus he posed the question walking by, don't know wether he heard my answer, or not."
Melina T.,"Irvine, United States",16,87,63,4.0,24/6/2016,"The restaurant is gorgeous (and dark). Service:  We were quickly seated and given menus. BUT our server just... Didn't give us water even though we requested it. She also took maybe 25 minutes just to take our order (we tried to make ourselves look ""ready to order"" too). Slow slow service. The restaurant wasn't even packed, either. She was really nice but....... 3.5/5  Food:  I had the angel hair with shrimp. It wasn't my favourite, but it definitely was a good dish! I recommend if you want to stray from your typical spaghetti and meatballs.  (5/5) I also had a strawberry daiquiri. It was so delicious! (would have been more delicious if I got it earlier... but nevertheless, I would order again) (5/5)"
Joshua C.,"Irvine, United States",2,10,,4.0,11/8/2016,"I have been going here since this location opend. It has always had friendly staff and the food has stayed consistently good. I won't rate this place based on calorie count because that has nothing to do with the location,just the good and people's personal health choices. If I could change one thing it would be the presence of managment. They never seem to go ot to the tables and interact with guests."
Paul G.,"Fountain Valley, United States",0,3,,3.0,7/3/2017,"My wife and I had a gift card for the Factory, so we did a little shopping at Bella Terra and then went over to the Factory. Got seated immediately, looked over the menu, and decided on the half turkey sand with soup and salad. My wife had the French onion soup. I ordered the pasta with shrimp and sausage. About 15 minutes later our food arrived. I looked at my plate and couldn't believe what I saw. There was a lunch size portion of food on the plate. They wanted$17.95 for it. My wife looked at it and said the same thing. Definitely not worth $17.95.  I asked a server to get the manager. I explained the situation and he offered to either replace it with something else or he could have more pasta added to it. I opted fomore pasta. When the plate returned it had twice as much as it had before. Good manager, great dish. Excellent blend of pasta, marinara, shrimp and sausage. I would order it again, except with a lot of pasta. The turkey on my wife's sand was very salty and the onion soup, with a chunk of bread(?) in the bowl, left a lot to be desired. Good luck on your next Cheesecake Factory. Don't be afraid to talk to the manager."
