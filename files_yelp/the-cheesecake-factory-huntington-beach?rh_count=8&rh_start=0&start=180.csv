Rhonda L.,"Long Beach, United States",102,283,305,4.0,2/4/2016,"I'm typically not into chain restaurants, but I took advantage of the slice of joy during the holidays and had to go in and use my free certificates.  Portions are large and the food is good to very good.  We shared ahi tartar and endive salad appetizers, my bf had his favorite chicken marsala.  My only complaint was that I ordered 2 slices of cheesecake and unfortunately just said carrot cake and not carrot cake cheesecake, so I got carrot cake to take home.  Though it was my fault, the server should have double checked since they serve both.  The carrot cake was good and was already packaged to go, so I didn't say anything."
Susan R.,"Bellflower, United States",37,71,28,4.0,16/1/2017,Always have great service here. Food is excellent. Sometimes a long wait on the weekends if you get here at dinner time. Large variety of items on the menu and of course the cheesecake is delicious!
Nichole B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",46,124,86,4.0,6/4/2016,"Always love coming to Cheesecake Factory. Their service has always been great and pretty quick. I love their cucumber lemonade with a passion (best drink I have ever had), I love their cheesecake (obviously) - definitely try their salted caramel cheesecake! Perfect amount of sweetness and saltiness.  I usually get the same thing every time (their BBQ ranch chicken salad) which is amazing. The portion size is crazy! So big but I am not complaining!  I have no complaints about any of the other dishes I have tried, I always enjoy coming here. Its beautiful inside and I like that their lighting is dim"
Mendel Y.,"Lakewood, United States",1149,325,863,3.0,31/5/2014,"Been a fan of The Cheesecake factory for some time. I remember going while in High School and it being a special event. The food was always great, the servers treated you well and it was an experience that was just different. Now days, every time I go it seems like a huge ordeal with long wait times, an extremely crowded front area and food that lacks any real flair. Service there can still be quite good but it seems that they are really just churning the customers as fast as they can to deal with the crowds.  I had the Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and it was indeed spicy, great for me and was as expected from the warnings on the menu. The pasta seemed a bit overdone but the shrimp was damn near perfect which well made up for it.  Wife had the Miso Salmon which was amazing and well done. The miso added a good amount of sweetness to the fish and I was pleasantly surprised that it was throughout the cut and not just on the surface. Shared the Macadamia nut-caramel and was pretty disappointed. The nuts were soggy and not flavorful at all. Caramel was like a sauce that was bland and again, lacked any real flair. Back in the day this place was easily one of my favorites but it's just another place to eat on occasion now."
Sarai C.,"Costa Mesa, United States",37,62,80,5.0,23/5/2017,"My husband and I went there for an early dinner on a Saturday it was pretty busy, so we had to wait. We went across the way to grab a beer at the wing place and watch the rest of the hockey game. After about 15 to 20 minutes our buzzer went off and we went and take a seat. It was such a beautiful day, so outside in the patio area with the spot to be. My husband and I had our orders taken and or drinks brought out, but what made it even better was the busser. The food Runner he was constantly zooming by making sure that we were okay making sure that the area was clean and that we were being taken care of.  Even though he wasn't our server he was the person in our section. He was very attentive quick and seem like such a hard worker. My husband and I gave him a $10 tip just for being, so motivated this is what hard work looks like. Thank you Erik for being such a great example of how hard work is supposed to be."
lisa m.,"San Bernardino, United States",0,2,2,1.0,1/5/2016,"Just ate there and all I can say is ""yuck"" even after telling like it was it still cost and arm and leg. Even when you mess up you should make it right but No. Potatoes were double fried and could take out an eye if you started a good fight. Toast not brown on one side  On an avocado and chorizo omelette There Wasn't much avocado."
Stephanie A.,"Huntington Beach, United States",67,5,,1.0,25/2/2017,I had a horrible experience at this place my food was cold and nasty and the staff was rude I can't believe this place is so highly rated and enjoyed by people. Save your money and go to Denny's food would be better and the people would be friendlier
KAY KAY L.,"Costa Mesa, United States",510,217,3336,4.0,10/6/2016,"Love the chicken tuscan. I asked that no extra sauce us added to my food. It come out perfect. The brown rice was soaked in the sauce made it so tasty. There are 3 pieces of chicken, alot. Love"
Kev O.,"Irvine, United States",32,389,860,4.0,21/6/2015,"Had actually planned on a more romantic restaurant with an ocean view on this date, but found that everything was fully booked for father's day weekend. So, it was a toss up between my date's suggestions of Denny's, IHOP, and Cheesecake Factory because it was less likely that these places would be fully booked.....I thought that perhaps my date was just testing me, so I chose the CF :)  I'd been to many other CF restaurants and knew they'd have an excellent selection of food choices on their menus....whether it's for the hungry or weight watchers. I'm glad I came here as the quality has always been consistent throughout all the CF's I'd been to so far.  Upon entering, it's pretty much the same decor and layout as any other CF. I guess I should have expected that even at 5.45pm this place was pretty full! However, when I went up to the hostess at the counter and inquired about the wait time, I was surprisingly told just 2 minutes! I then asked if it was the same for a booth? I was then told 15 minutes. Ok, not a problem as my date was still on her way anyway. I was given a buzzer which would go off when our table was ready,....and less than 3 minutes it goes off! That was fast!....and there was still a big crowd waiting around in the lobby area.  I love the free bread here, they're always so fresh and warm, and yummy with butter! But oh so easy to fill up on before your main meal comes! My date ordered the Chicken with Biscuits with Gravy.....the chicken usually comes sauteed, but she wanted them fried, which the waitress said was not a problem. I went ahead and ordered the combination dinner of Grilled Salmon, Chicken  Madeira which came with mashed potatoes and Asparagus spears. The portion of my dish was big, but her's was huge....and very delicious! Believe it or not I couldn't finish my chicken and mashed potatoes! She ended up having to doggie bag more than half her dinner. I have a feeling the bread and two apple martinis she had had filled her up :) Anyway, all in all it was a very good dinner and a pretty nice experience, although the place had now gotten completely packed and very noisy....yea, not the most romantic atmosphere for a date, but oh well :) After we finished dinner we then noticed how pleasant the weather was and how we probably should have sat at the outdoor patio, which was full too, but less noisy and much more airy. Oh, when I drove into this strip mall I was kind of fearing having to find parking as the lot was packed. Thank goodness that just beyond the Cheesecake Factory was a valet parking stand, and for just $5 you can save yourself some headache.....definitely worth it. Service here was good for how busy the place was....food consistently good quality....although I don't see my favorite Avocado Eggrolls on the menu anymore...that was a bummer :("
Nancy P.,"Long Beach, United States",146,77,75,3.0,18/7/2015,"I remember the first time I had ever eaten at this chain restaurant back in 2012 in San Diego which sounds like years ago when I put it that way. I was there just recently and it'll probably be my last time ever since I was disappointed on both occasions when I had came to this location. Sure, its a hit and miss.. but on both occasions... I think its a sign. I was a fan, but I think NOW its too over price for mediocre food or maybe I just started to notice it now.  However, on a lighter note...great service and waiters/waitress are very nice. Hence, it's in a great location; however, I wouldn't make my drive here only for this restaurant. Plently of other resturants with the same price range."
Sandra A.,"Huntington Beach, United States",13,484,436,4.0,2/6/2016,"Haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in years, maybe even longer.  I love the decor of the place, very interesting.  I especially enjoyed the fish tacos and my friend enjoyed the fish and chlps.  The fish was fried to perfection. And the fries were not super thin or really thick; it was just perfect with enough potato on it to make it a real french fry and not just dried crunchy sticks I recently had another eatery.   The place was very busy even for a mid-week evening. Of course, we couldn't leave without having some cheesecake.  We enjoyed some fresh strawberry cheesecake and oh, was it soo good.  It was just the perfect sweetness, not overpowering with sugar yet very sophisticated sweetness that you can taste off in the distance. I love the light and airiness of the whipped cream.  We were so stuffed but it was so good.  We were excited to bring home our leftovers so we can enjoy it for another meal.  You have to go.. And they're opened until 11 pm. Yes!"
Diane A.,"Santa Ana, United States",136,49,1,5.0,19/1/2017,"My husband and I loved the Happy Hour here! I have had lunch here but found the menu a bit endless. The bar was where we found the right fit! The food was delicious, the prices are great. The bartender was attentive and sweat! We had two drinks each and shared three appetizer totaling $24."
Kimberly P.,"San Francisco, United States",121,282,119,4.0,7/4/2016,"Happy Hour 4-6pm in the Bar area ONLY! They also have some great deals on apps too. Arrived a little after 5pm on a Tuesday and didn't have a problem finding a place to sit. The food and drinks were good as always. However, I tried the veggie burger and was not impressed. I mean it is a veggie burger, but it didn't have much flavor. However, the ahi carpaccio and crab wontons were delicious! Cheesecake Factory is always on my radar when it comes to a great meal (:"
Paige S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",144,141,69,5.0,30/9/2015,Great food. Love Happy Hour! I had the Dynamite Shrimp & Factory Nachos & the Avocado Eggrolls! All were so good especially the Factory Nachos that looked more like a meal than a happy hour small plate. I was very satisfied. The cosmo was a bit too strong for me!
Amanda H.,"Santa Ana, United States",32,60,320,1.0,22/10/2015,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember. I went during the time when service was AMAZING & managers would come by your table & ask how the food was and if they've lived up to all expectations. Unfortunately their quality of FOOD & SERVICE has gone to shit. ABSOLUTE CRAP. Racism was also apparent at this particular location. I asked for chopsticks to eat with my Tuna Tataki Salad(opposed to using there BULKY forks that can't pick up a single mixed green salad i ordered) and some older white lady working there had the nerve to make an offensive remark ""let me get your chopsticks in our shed out back, ill be right back!"" Um wtf?! SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO OUR TABLE. Went looking for the bitch to confront her and i saw her do a U-Turn when i eyed her lol PATHETIC.  I dislike confrontation, so i ended it there."
Lori R.,"Malibu, United States",245,47,65,5.0,10/4/2016,Possibly the biggest menu of any restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. Pretty much anything you can imagine. I went with the Steak Diane tonight and it was amazing. Always leave with a loaf of their bread and a piece of cheesecake. How can you not!?!
Candace A.,"Irvine, United States",2,18,39,4.0,27/5/2015,"Cheesecake Factory never fails! It's the best chain restaurant, my favorite at least, because the food is consistent and always really good. They give you warm bread and butter upon seating, ask for the brown wheat it's the best!  I ordered several items off of the skinnylicious menu, a low cal menu, and was surprised that it was all full of flavor and really yummy despite being low calorie. I ordered several of the appetizers/small plates, which seems like a lot more food for your money as the entrees can be quite pricey. Loved the blue cheese/roasted pear flatbread. It was more than enough for one person and was only $7 (compared to the $17 entree I almost had instead.)  I also love the luau salad, roasted artichokes and my all time FAVORITE.... the tamale cakes which are a must try!!!!!"
Abigail B.,"Norwalk, United States",28,21,1,5.0,29/7/2016,"Had a lunch meeting here for work and service and food was great. We had a reservation for 12 and lunch hour went smoothly. We got our drinks and food on time, refills were prompt and we got our bill right away. Our server was very nice and professional.  This place offers a wide variety of food, drinks and desserts. From American cuisine to Asian, Mexican and of course Italian dishes. The desserts are superb and Sunday brunch is also offered, I love their pancakes and waffle breakfasts. You can always count on this place for a nice lunch or fancy dinner. I would recommend this place to others. Cheers!!!"
Daniel John S.,"Costa Mesa, United States",11,18,14,4.0,6/1/2017,Their seasonal cheese cake is amazing! I tried the mint chocolate cheese cake and it melted my heart away! They have a ton of other varieties of cheese cake by the way if thats not what you want. (Wink). So much to choose from! They also have sweet deals with their meal. You can have a meal and dessert afterwards.
Annie L.,"Atlanta, United States",715,924,1252,4.0,13/5/2015,"I LOVE YOU CHEESECAKE FACTORY, always and forever. This location was the same as the rest---down to the spectacular service. We came for lunch and it was crowded. Luckily for us, we had immediate access at the bar seating area. Ordered the salmon but it came out wayyyyyy overcooked. Brought this attention to the server, and she switched it out to a MUCH better temperature on the salmon.  BREAD! SO GOOD! CARB OVERLOAD OVERTIME I COME HERE. Extra blue cheese dressing please. Peanut cilantro dressing is bomb as well."
