Tilia L.,"Westminster, United States",221,122,160,3.0,15/3/2016,"Ive been here so many times but I never reviewed this place! Hmm..  Time: There is usually never a wait here when I come. The max was 20 minutes for me and that was on a Sunday night.  Dishes: Ordered chicken carbonara for around $15. If you want to add chicken into the dish, you need to pay more. So technically, the dish is around $20 which is pricy considering that I can make this dish at home after eating it. Really, there's nothing special about it. BUT I do always like to order this dish when I'm here so i guess you can say I enjoyed it very much!  I also LOVEEEEE their original cheesecake! It is creamy with a perfect amount of cheese. Plus, it doesn't leave you that weird texture when they left it out for too long so the top layer becomes hard, if you know what I mean. Never tried the fish n chips but my bf always order that dish here!  As for the service, it's a hit or miss. One time, I went here with my friend and we needed forks for our pasta(they didn't give any utensils for us to eat) soooooo we waved down our waitress and she gave us the death stare like did we just really asked for her LOL other times, they were attentive to us. Note: you don't gotta dress fancyyyyyyy here. Oh and if you can't see well in the dark, you might want to bring a flashlight."
Nate S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,5,,1.0,23/7/2017,Absolutely a joke. 15-20 minutes before we were approached by a waitress. She says I'll be right back with your waters and bread.. another 20 minutes and no bread. Waitress was terrible. She got mad at me for asking her why it took 30 minutes for my drink. The salads were absolutely disgusting and I'm pretty sure the idiot sabotaged them. The coward manger offered nothing in return for the most pathetic service and food I have ever had in my entire life and to be honest I'm kind of glad because I will never ever go back to this pathetic excuse for a restaurant and rest assured I will tell everyone I know about this joke of an experience! Wasted guy puking in that bathroom was a plus! Added entertainment! If I could give 0 stars I would. Embarrassing establishment.
Paul L.,"Westminster, United States",90,7,2,5.0,30/7/2015,Had an amazing sever name Fran  Super on top of her game   Will definitely come back and request for her!!! =]
Anna T.,"Santa Monica, United States",0,2,,5.0,10/2/2017,Absolutely love this place! My favorite is pasta with mushrooms!
BC K.,"Pomona, United States",0,2,,2.0,4/7/2017,"Our server Angie was great but the Host (AM shift, gentlemen) ruined our July 4th 2017 experience. My little brother came late to join us and sat next to us in a small 2 person table. We asked the server if we were able to take the table prior to my brother arriving. The server said it would be fine. My little brother got here and sat at the table. He ordered his food with the server so we thought it was fine. Then the host comes by and rudely ask my brother to move. He didn't ask can he move??? He said quote ""I need him to move so I can seat this table"" At this time the restaurant was only 50% filled!!! Being a FOH restaurant manager for 8 years, if any of my staff ever spoke like that to any customer I would write them up and cut their shifts. After the incident we didnt ask for any compensation nor did we ask to speak to the manager. Communication is key while working at a restaurant and why is it the customers fault that the server and host didnt communicate."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, United States",3080,6372,5149,3.0,1/4/2015,"While there are a ton of places I would rather eat when I bother with the half hour drive to here, I met a friend here for happy hour and it was pretty good. Since it was only the two of us and really early we found a seat in the bar area wthout any wait. Tons of options in the happy hour menu, but not quite as excessive as the regular menu. Happy hour portions are still plenty large and taste wise it was ok too. Still don't think I would come back to this location, only because when I come to HB the options are endless on better, non chain restaurants."
Vicky S.,"San Pedro, United States",206,413,46,3.0,20/5/2015,"I always think about the reports of how fattening and caloric most of their meals are..but I feel like you eat more than you would at home at most restaurants. For some reason I always hear about how unhealthy this chain is. Anyways, they have so many options and I am in love with those avocado egg rolls and the sweet dipping sauce. They have  good options, ok options, and some not so great meals. I got the chicken bellagio, it was ok. I think the appetizers  are my favorite things. I used to always get the lettuce wraps as my meal. I like that they have a big skinny menu and the options actually sound good. I had a few skinny mojitos too, yum! We tried two cheesecakes and they were just ok. I have had some in the past that were good."
Kayla M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",225,6,1,1.0,15/4/2016,"WORST MEAL EVER.  To start off the night we ordered the fried cheese which was amazing. But that was the only thing amazing about the experience we had tonight. Our server (BREANN P) was a major part of our bad experience. I ordered the bacon-bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend ordered the fish and chips dinner. We waited about 25-30 minutes for our food, which is ridiculous on its own, Especially because we were got there at 9:30, not at prime dinner hour. When my food came my burger looked semi appetizing, nothing mouth watering, and my boyfriends food was wrong. The waitress put in a fettuccini Alfredo instead of his fish and chip plate. They immediately took it back and told him that it would be out shortly. Which it did, BUT the fish was undercooked and mooshey. Just touching the fish with my fingers made me almost puke.. And by the time I got to eat my burger the bottom of the bun was soggy. I asked for ranch for and it took a good 10 minutes to finally get it. The waitress had no sense of urgency because her friends were at the table behind us. Long story short- I get better service at my favorite sports bar/pub on a Friday night then I do at this restaurant on a weekday 2 hours before closing. We will never be dining her again and I suggest you don't as well. Save your $50 and go somewhere actually decent."
Frannie B.,"Long Beach, United States",11,85,158,4.0,6/7/2015,"Great Food  Great Service Great Company Love the Cheesecake Factory! Would of given them 5 stars but $7.50 for a little slice of cake, is a little much no matter how good it is!"
Amanda L.,"Garden Grove, United States",356,196,937,3.0,2/6/2015,"first off, THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS! TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT!! Plan ahead to avoid wasting your time waiting., I made the mistake not to do that. Arrived here at 8:30 PM Saturday Night, quoted 30 mins, got seated by 9. We were seated all the way outside in the back that had NO LIGHTING except the little candle on the table... i needed to bring out my flash light on my phone to read the menu. 15 mins later we had to wave someone down to even get us drinks, and complimentary bread ( white, wheat served with butter) RECOMMENDATIONS: - pasta di vinci!! unique sauce with mushroom and chicken $17 - Chinese salad (HUGE portion side, share!)  $15 - appetizer- stuffed mushroom! filled with cheese inside.. yumm -Louisiana chicken   last but not least, the CHEEEESECAKE!!!! try them all! the slices are pretty big. ~$9 server- it was one thing we were seated all the way outside in the back (towards valet), but it was so difficult to find our server and she was not attentive."
John H.,"Huntington Beach, United States",4,5,,1.0,10/3/2017,"Entertained 3 friends that were staying with us from Germany Thursday. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy. Our server was handling too many other tables. I had to get up from the table and find another server, not ours, when it was time to order our appetizers. Then, we waited for over 15 minutes to order our entrees. The food finally came and I had to get up from the table again to get a napkin. We needed to order additional drinks and couldn't find our server again so we asked to see the manager. We asked our server 3 times for the manager. It took the manager, Bridgette L, over 45 minutes to come to our table. The server told me that he asked her 3 times to come to our table. When Bridgette L finally came over she told me that she had just heard about out service failure. That wasn't true. Based on Bridgette L's response, it speaks volumes about how they really feel about the customer. They don't care. I live in the same complex as ""The Cheesecake Factory"", Bella Terra. There are plenty of restaurants to visit and we won't be back. Our friends from Germany asked if this is the type of service they should expect from American Restaurants. I told them this was the worst service I've received in the last 30 years. I eat out 5 times per week for lunch and eat out 3 or 4 times per week for dinner. When in the Bella Terra area, forget ""The Cheesecake Factory"". There are many other restaurants that care about their customers."
G M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,408,722,3.0,29/5/2016,"I have come here off and on for years. They have some plusses and minuses. The menu is long and varied - really a bit too much. The food was not really that special. We had the chicken marsala with bow tie pasta (pasta was great although heavy with oil, mushrooms were good, chicken itself was surprisingly bland), and Jamaica Jerk Shrimp (reheated frozen shrimp with a spicy sauce, rice not particularly good, plantains a bit sweet, etc.)  The interior and patio are both pretty good, although the patio is not far from a freeway, and the umbrellas don't shield from sun in your face."
Noel C.,"Long Beach, United States",0,7,,1.0,17/7/2017,"This place is awful.   I came with friends and ordered spinach dip as an appetizer.   It took a very long time  to get the spinach dip.  Once received it was cold; the cheese was not melted.   I complained about it and the waiter had the nerve to ask if I wanted it heated.  My friend ordered the grande burrito.   The grande burrito came with a side of black beans.   The black beans were extremely cold.  The burrito was filled with rice and four tiny pieces of chicken.   It was almost like a rice burrito.   This particular location appears to be detached from the company's vision.   The cook is tacky; half size portions, cold food and slow service.   Every time I dine here I say I'm not returning.   I returned this evening for the last time.    The Huntington location should closed down."
Christina Z.,"Roseville, United States",6,4,,1.0,2/10/2016,Service was slow. Got seated 5 mins after we arrived so we were happy about that. From there it was downhill! Waited about 30 to 40 mins for the food to come out. So dissapointed! Manager gave us soup while we waited but she couldn't even explain what happened to our order. Even ordered take out ahead of time but had to wait awhile for it as well. Love Cheesecake but tonight was just bad.
SL S.,"Rosemead, United States",0,107,4,2.0,24/2/2017,"came by for happy hour.  Sat at the bar with a friend.  We were served right away by a young thin female with short dark hair.  At first everything seemed fine.  Then after we had 2 glasses of wine, she brings over the bill as if she was trying to get rid of us.  We were the customers and it was up to us when we wanted to leave.  Bringing the bill and putting it on our table was her way of getting rid of us.  Totally uncalled for.  This was an unwelcoming gesture.  For this, I won't be coming back.  Was a bad experience."
Vanessa T.,"Orange, United States",0,7,114,5.0,29/9/2016,Love their cheesecake and carrot cake is the best!! Food and service are great. Very nice clean place. I always enjoy their brown bread with butter!
Hazel D.,"Norwalk, United States",1,6,,1.0,30/6/2017,Cheesecake factory is one of my favorite place to eat. I come here at least once a month with my parents. I dont have problem coming here not until today the guy at the front is very rude. me and my mom were about to sit at the table i asked him in a polite way if we can sit on the other table instead bec I didn't want to sit at the far end he gave me a look and attitude. Started getting extra utensils in a rude way and walked out.
Namjoonied F.,"Westminster, United States",0,4,1,5.0,12/12/2016,"Yes!!! This is a very nice place to go when it's not too busy! It's burgers are delicious! It was so big I had to take it home! Along with that, came the fries. Perfect...It rivals McDonald's! The service was just adorable! Our waiter was the sweetest girl ever, and was all smiles and came back and checked in on us every so often to make sure everything was going great. Service was a bit slow, but the waitress was so nice it made up for it. All in all, this was a great experience. I'm still at the restaurant in fact, trying out some of the delicious cheesecakes"
Steve T.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,9,,1.0,28/6/2017,"This place is so over rated! They should be charging half price on everything because that's what it's worth,barely. Nice atmosphere but the food is substandard,I'll eat at norms before I eat here again !"
Nathan P.,"Tucson, United States",10,12,1,5.0,28/11/2016,"Excellent staff and quickly seated, waiting about 20 minutes on a Friday night (not bad). Thai lettuce wraps and buffalo wings were good for three people. The lemon drop and strawberry daiquiri were both not too sweet, which is exactly how these drinks should be made! Bella Terra is a great shopping mall with much to do before/after your meal.  Highly recommend."
