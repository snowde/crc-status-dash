Tracy S.,"Las Vegas, United States",48,47,87,4.0,1/10/2016,I usually get the same thing here. But decided to change it up. I ordered the lunch soup and salad combo. The soup was baked potato. It was good. But the salad was plain. Literally just greens. I wouldn't recommend this menu item. Who wants just lettuce. And it doesn't say it on the menu. When I asked the server she said ya it's pretty basic. Ya I'd say. Wasn't to friendly. We shared the sweet corn Tamales. Those were good.
Jerome R.,"Huntington Beach, United States",8,39,9,5.0,13/10/2016,"First time coming here with the wife. Heard great things from foodie friends. Wait time wasnt bad to get a table. I am huge on service so we got a great server. Wasnt over bearing coming every 5 seconds. But food was out quick, soda was always full. And my wife mentioned how much she loved the honey mustard and our server brought her a small container of it to go. His name was ryan c, i remember cause he said you know like ryan seacrest. Food was great. I would def Recommend this place. Will be back soon."
Steven M.,"Lakewood, United States",358,800,40,3.0,1/12/2015,"I gave this place 1 star for service, 1 star for ambience, and 1 star for the avocado egg rolls.  Otherwise I gotta say I will only return for the egg rolls!  The prices are ... well PRICEY!  Service is amazing, nice date night location, great appetizers if you want to just eat appetizers...but main dishes are not worth the money IMO.  First of all they got rid of my favorite Thai chicken pasta dish...boo!  They also got rid of the margharita chicken dish...boo!  Replaced them with some mexican dishes which I can get for half the price at other restaurants...why would I come to CF for Mexican food?  who is running this place?  I ordered the bang bang chicken/shrimp dish which was 3-4 stars but not worth the money I paid for it.  If I return it will be for a dessert or their apps.  So disappointed."
Lina F.,"Lakewood, United States",1152,447,1258,4.0,4/11/2014,"Ahhh, love me some Cheesecake Factory!  I'm a creature of habit.  The last few times i've been i ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice.  That sauce is yummy but this time the salmon was a little overcooked and they must've braised it with a teriyaki sauce because it was sweet.  Has it always been like that because i can't seem to remember but i don't think so.  We came here after the Alzheimer's Walk in Huntington Beach.  It rained on the walk and not so many people turned out.   Parking is crowded but if you don't mind walking there's a parking structure close by, near the theatre.  Location is right off the 405 freeway, Bella Terra Plaza.  You can see it from the freeway."
Joseph P.,"Tempe, United States",3,16,3,4.0,5/9/2016,"What I like most about the Cheesecake factory is the massive menu to chose from. My most recent visit was the best because we had JOSE as our server. This guy really makes the experience enjoyable because he's funny, knows the menu extremely well and gives honest advice. I think he'd make an excellent manager and will ask for him by name next time I come in to eat."
Adrian A.,"Long Beach, United States",220,302,702,3.0,27/3/2015,"It's OK! I just go here for their overprice cheesecake once in awhile. The food are mediocre for their price. It's just a fancy chain restaurant that's why the norms go here. Though they have good customer service and a fancy ambiance, but that's about it!"
Diana B.,"Orange County, United States",636,241,561,4.0,26/3/2015,"NO RESERVATIONS!! this can be a little frightening especially on a friday night. Ambience: cheesecake factory is known for their dark atmosphere and waiters/waitresses dressed in all white. There is outside seating with heat lamps that offer a little more light, but is still relatively dim compared to other restaurants. This location always seems to be buzzing with people no matter what time of day you go. Menu: the menu can be extremely confusing, with ads on some pages, long lists of food on others. You don't know whether you should be looking under the ""specials"" or under the individually categorized entree (meat, pasta, lunch, etc). It is definitely a very hefty menu, almost 30 pages long!! and with the bad lighting, how can anyone really see? Food: I always opt for the brown bread, and I only asked the waitress to bring brown bread, which she does without fail. The bread has a slight hint of sweet and is just delicious overall. We decided on the Salmon Genovese, which, to my surprise, was absolutely delicious!! The large piece of crisped salmon was placed over pasta balls (looked like rice) with a pesto sauce and sundried tomatoes. OH MY GOSH. I did not expect this dish to be this delicious. The combination of the crispy salmon and the sundried tomatoes is to die for. There are nuts in this dish, which I will ask them to not add next time, but YES, delicious!! Dessert: this two-page menu has such a long list of cheesecakes. How will you know which to choose?? I usually opt for the original cheesecake with fresh strawberries, but this time, we got the Godiva Chocolate and the Banana Cream Cheesecake. The banana was my favorite because it wasn't too sweet, and it came with fresh banana slices. The Godiva was a little sweet in my opinion. Service: it was a busy night but i think our waitress did her best to make it to our table whenever she could. We did have to wait a long time after our meal so we just decided to walk up to a host table to ask for a dessert menu ourselves."
Tram N.,"Westminster, United States",0,7,,1.0,30/4/2017,"Have always loved the Cheesecake Factory, had many birthdays, great celebrations there. We frequent this location at least a couple times a month but this last time we went, we ordered a spaghetti and meatballs from the kid's menu for our son and barely through a few bites discovered a piece of plastic wrap in it. Brought it to the attention of the server and he asked if we would like it replaced. Since it was for my 2 year old son and he had barely taken a few bites I said please. The manager on duty came to our table and explained that it may have been the plastic from the cheese they have. We got the check and saw that they had put ""free/comped meal"" on it however, they had charged us for TWO spaghettis and counted the replacement as ""free"". A little misleading considering we didn't really receive any free nor comped meal because we still ended up having to pay for it. This made me remembered that the same thing had happened to us one prior time here with a piece of wax paper from their butter and the manager at the time had actually brought me a new one AND comped us for it. I don't mind paying for the food obviously since we came here to eat, just would like for my child's food to NOT include plastic in it. Don'r mislead people by labeling on the check as ""free/comped meal"" when in reality we didn't get anything for free. Just disappointing since we come here so often and have always loved the Cheesecake Factory but this just left an unpleasant taste for me and I Probably will try another location for our family meals in the future."
Dani M.,"Santa Ana, United States",0,2,1,1.0,10/11/2015,"I called to get my favorite dish for take-out on my lunch break.  I was put on hold for 9 minutes and eventually I hung up and called again since I didn't feel like anyone was going to help me anytime soon.  Eventually I put in my order for Avocado Eggrolls and I picked them up.  As soon as I sat down to eat it I saw that my Avocado Eggrolls were black.  I understand browning avocados but not black.  Someone had to have seen the avocados were black when they cut the eggrolls in half.  I was so sick to my stomach.  I have never seen this dish look so bad, I really had no idea what to do other than throw it away.  So gross."
Luke S.,"Fullerton, United States",0,29,,1.0,3/9/2017,"cool atmosphere, clean everything.. but i wish they didn't serve bread at all. of course it was served with an open fully used butter"
May E.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,2,,4.0,12/5/2017,"Rude Gina.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and never have issues here. But this past Wednesday we asked Gina (the employee that seats you) for a booth after being offered the small tables by the bar along the small wall, I wanted to enjoy dinner and chatting with my daughter as we were celebrating Mothers Day and those small tables are very awkward as they seat you near strangers. Gina looked bothered immediately, then we walked back, I saw her walk towards the host, but never saw If they engaged in a convo, Gina came back to me and said it would be 5 minutes.  After several small parties were seated while we waited and then finally the waiting area went empty. I asked the hostess when our table would be ready and she stated that she didn't even have our name down. During that time Gina would just walk by us and look at us. She never came back over to us RUDE! THAT WAS RUDE! We were finally seated thanks to the helpful hostess."
Yelp Is Bullshit B.,"Irvine, United States",24,152,14,2.0,12/11/2015,I can't even recall one good dish that I had from here.  The best thing I have had from this place was their strawberry smoothie/slush whatever and I wouldn't come here just for it. Customer Service = Sufficient 2.5/5 Environment = Good 3/5 Food = 1/5 Overall Satisfaction = Needs Improvement 2/5
Miguel P.,"Garden Grove, United States",33,21,1,5.0,24/7/2016,"I have finally found my new replacement/favorite restaurant. I had my first Cheesecake Factory experience yesterday and it exceeded my expectations. I was looking forward for some lettuce wraps, but unfortunately they were all sold out. So I decided to get the chicken samosas and it was probably one of the best decisions I've made this year. The samosas were perfectly crunchy on the outside and perfectly seasoned on the inside. My entree plate, chicken Carbonara, was a perfect amount and satisfied my week long craving for pasta. The only con would be the plastic beer mugs. I'm not a fan of them, but I understand the reasoning behind it."
Patty M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",1,10,1,1.0,9/4/2017,"We went here last Friday evening around 9:30. On this visit the service was incredibly slow. Our order was incorrect. The server admitted he wrote it down correctly, but entered it wrong. They did offer to correct it, but we had waited 40 minutes for an order of fried chicken sliders so we just let it go since it was almost 11 pm. Our previous visit about 2 months ago was awful with slow, rude service. I'm done going to this location."
Correen B.,"Garden Grove, United States",388,533,303,3.0,24/6/2013,"What can I say?  It's The Cheesecake Factory.... Most everybody has eaten here a million times.  Huge menu, huge portions.  Server was not quite trained. Brought us bread and butter, then asked us if we wanted plates.....uh, what did you think we were going to do with the bread?  Balance it carefully on our silverware, set it on the table?  Duh! To the table of 5 women sitting across the patio from us,  we don't think your kid is nearly adorable as you do, and this is a restaurant, not romper room.  Keep your kid at ""your"" table.  If you want to put your kid on ""ignore"", then perhaps leave her at home with a babysitter."
Gerry B.,"Orange County, United States",73,218,6473,4.0,24/11/2013,"Several (8) friends and I were looking for a late (10:30p.m.) dessert place after our birthday celebration dinner for one of our friends.  We decided on The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach.  Parking was readily accessible,  seating was immediate, and the service was good at this time of night.   I convinced my friend to share the new cheesecake of the month, S'mores Cheesecake, with me.  It is a Hershey Cheesecake on a graham cracker crust with a top layer of  chocolate ganache.  This creation is topped with oozing, fluffy, white marshmallow with an embedded graham cracker square on the top  center of the slice.  It is accompanied  with the usual whipped cream on the top end and bottom end of the cheesecake.   I took my first bite.  All is could do is go hmmmmmmmm, as it swirls and melts in my mouth. I was too busy enjoying the taste to join in the table conversations.  My other friend, who has the same love for decadence and  shared the cheesecake, rolled their eyes to the back of their head for this guilty pleasure. It  was is amazing and left me speechless for a while. My friends and I enjoyed every minute spending time, catching up, and savoring this sweet course. A memory we will remember for a meal we have shared. It was a great way to end the night; sweet in more ways than one. Tip: I highly recommend for large birthday parties to have their celebrations late at night.  It is easier to get seating for large groups and you get better service. Also, I hope they will include an option for extra graham crackers squares for the cheesecake, which gives it that s'mores feel. Lastly, let your server know the name of the person with a birthday so that they can write their name in chocolate on the plate when their cheesecake is served."
Debra R.,"Tustin, United States",0,1,,5.0,4/5/2017,The food and service here were outstanding.  They were very busy our wait time was approx 15 min. Not too bad for a friday night. Our server took our drink order shortly after we sat down.  Our food was delicious. Our server was very sweet. Good service deserves a good tip. We will definitely come back again
Mrs. A.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,99,8,5.0,30/10/2016,"Came in only for Dessert We had the Strawberry Shortcake tonight shared with my husband, haven't had in a while it was not good 3 tiny biscuits small ice cream scoop and very little Strawberry dollop of whip cream, Amber wasn't our server but she got us more strawberries and whip cream to make it better!!!! Not ordering this again it was just not worth it!!! Bring Back the Old BISCUIT Back!!!!!!!!! This one isn't worth it!!!!!!"
Rob C.,"Huntington Beach, United States",28,9,,5.0,29/10/2016,Great location and friendly staff . New skinny menu and vegetarian choices make it a win win for everyone . Pineapple Mule Rocks ! Valet park it's much easier than finding parking in Bella Terra .
Julie F.,"Huntington Beach, United States",2,13,5,1.0,30/4/2017,"Horrible to go service!!! I called to order two meals to be delivered to my car tonight. The person I spoke to on the phone said it would be 15-20 minutes and to call when I arrive. After arriving, I called the number on the sign and was told my food would be right out. I waited for the food to come out for another 20 minutes, then called again to say I was still waiting. The person on the phone said they forgot to tell someone to bring it out! When I initially called I let them know I would be paying with a card, well they came to my car without a swiper so they needed to bring  my card inside (which really doesn't seem right). They came back out and handed me the receipt.. exactly one hour after I placed my order! Feeling frustrated, I drove off only to realize they didn't give me my card back, so I had to turn around and call back to ask them to return my card. Once I returned home I was able to see that our food was now luke warm and had to put it in the microwave. They didn't even put bread in the bag with our meals. What a complete mess!! If it wasn't for the fact that I always have excellent service inside, I would not return to this location. I'll pick another restaurant for curb side pick up next time."
