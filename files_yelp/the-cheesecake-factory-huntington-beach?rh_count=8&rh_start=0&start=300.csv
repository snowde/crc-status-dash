zheng y.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,136,4,1.0,25/4/2016,"Had two bad experiences here over the past month.  A friend and I live about 50 miles apart, so it is convenient to meet in the middle at Bella Terra. We tire of the noise at Islands and the menu at Romano's, so we tried Cheesecake Factory for variety. Two weeks ago, I ordered salmon rolls, and our male server, whose name I don't recall entered the order as shrimp rolls. Not being familiar with the CF menu, I began eating the rolls, only to find no salmon inside. Waiter was called, and he apologized and re-entered the correct order. By the time the salmon rolls came, my friend had finished his lunch, so the mis-order and poor timing made our lunch very unsatisfying. They made no effort to offer us any sort of compensation for the error, and we didn't ask, so we just chalked one up to poor service and bad attitude. This weekend, my friend, who enjoys CF more than I, suggested it again and I acceded. We got there at opening at 11, so it wasn't too busy yet. I ordered an omelette which was to include avocado, cheese and bacon. When the food came out, I began eating, and once again, after 4 of 5 minutes and a half dozen bites into the omelette, I realized no avocado had been included, called our server Marisa over, and returned it for correction. After a normal wait, the correct plate was served, but once again the timing of our meals was disrupted and Marisa was not genuinely a good server, not very attentive, and offered no form of compensation for the kitchen's error. In light of two similar experiences, with in one case a server's error and in one a kitchen error, I can only assume management does not encourage the servers to offer any discounts or desserts to compensate for such terrible service. These service errors must be a way of life there, so don't expect anyone to care if your meal is not right."
James C.,"Tustin, United States",26,69,44,4.0,26/6/2016,"I signed up for CakePay.,  but in so doing I was charged $0.01.  I logged out of the account to test if the password that I had created would work and also to verify the account to the email that was sent. In so doing this I was  once again charged another $0.01.  A few minutes later my iPhone went  into sleep mode. I open it up my device again to run the cake pay app, and once again charged another $0.01. This is  very disconcerting.  I frequently eat at your establishment, and like the convenience of this app. But if I will be charged like this every time, it's kind of pointless to use the app.  I'm not asking for the $0.03, neither will this deter me from dining at cheesecake factory, but just letting you know that this might be happening with your other patrons as well. Best Regards, Jim"
Rena H.,"Woodland Hills, United States",971,792,4678,5.0,22/10/2014,"Had a lunch meeting today and this cheesecake factory was between our offices. My contact and I were debating on where we can meet, that's when we found out that Bella Terra is between of us so we both immediately said cheesecake factory.  We sat outside, they had a beautiful fountain and service was great. I ordered the lunch size chicken romano and it was delicious.  This will be a place for me to meet my contacts when I have lunches."
Najwa A.,"Huntington Beach, United States",3,17,45,4.0,16/7/2014,"Love the beef ribs, and sugar free cheesecake; we enjoy their brown bred with olive oil and vinegar . Friendly staff. Good service.  Am updating my review because I had one more dish that I liked very much, bang bang chicken and shrimp. You have to at least try it one time, coconut sauce soooo good."
Jessica M.,"Compton, United States",64,34,38,5.0,25/7/2015,"Came in last week and CHRISTINE was our waitress. She was phenomenal. Always had a smile and was extremely patient with me and my family. This location is my favorite. The Redondo beach one is 15min away from me. But my last 3 visits to this one are so much better. Great staff, wonderful atmosphere. I hope Christine sees this. Thank you!"
Tina S.,"Las Vegas, United States",1,1,1,5.0,3/10/2015,Jessica was a great waitress. She provided excellent service. We had a really good time tonight celebrating my son's 35th Birthday.
Pete S.,"Cypress, United States",474,1401,1557,4.0,17/5/2014,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, how my wide waist loves you. Not only do you offer one of the best cheesecakes around, you also make choosing dinner an incredible difficult task with your brochure like menu that is forever changing.  But what's great about you guys is that you have high employee morale and low turnover and considered Fortune top 100 companies to work for. Good for existing employees, not so good for people getting in.  I won't waste your time with mumbo jumbo what food to eat here. (except that I love the raspberry truffle cheesecake and someone should fire whoever took away the Thai Chicken pasta off the menu) Instead, you should know: Buying gift cards towards the end of the year. They will give out a certificate for a free cheesecake for every $25 gift card purchased. Last year, they offered 2 cheesecakes for each $25. My fat ass thanks you. I was lucky enough to get the ""golden ticket"" receipt that was worth $10 once. It's a survey for exchange for $10 GC.  They do have happy hour from M-F I believe 4-6 here. Certain appetizers are $5.  They have lunch portions that are good until 5pm. Cheaper fare. Some of the pastas I usually get are only $12.  Parking here in this location is incredibly difficult, you can call into go and there are 3 togo short term parking spots here. Oh why the 4 stars? Well, it's more like 4.5 but I think Cheesecake lost some of the glamour for me as the dining ""experience"" but I applaud you for consistency like Mikadees. Oh, on a closing note, Sunday brunch here including their lemon pancakes here are excellent. If you find everywhere else is busy, this would be a great alternative as well."
MaryJ N.,"Los Angeles, United States",2,31,160,4.0,12/9/2015,"This food  is good, Garlic Noodles w/shrimp, Cesar Salad.   The service is nice.  It's a bit dark but nice.   I'll be back"
Max D.,"Westminster, United States",0,41,,4.0,4/1/2016,"I have to say the service from Brittany at the host stand was outstanding.  She made sure we got our seats,  and even followed up to get us bread,  just first class all around.  Alexandria was excellent as well,  she was super busy with extra tables,  but kept up with everything.  Martha on the other hand,  needs to have someone talk to her,  to improve her ""Latina"" attitude,  she forgot she's not in the ghetto..."
J A.,"Los Angeles, United States",9,74,38,4.0,5/7/2015,"CHEESECAKE is really all I have to write on the review. However, I like the convenience of this location and their outside patio seating. Service is great but like any place its not perfect. I haxe had one bad expirience with my waitress forgetting a couple things I ordered so I had to remind her. Im over it since their menu has lots of good selections from brioche breakfast sandwhich to chicken marsala for lunch. Been trying to taste every cheesecake on menu and thus far personal favorite is the Raspberry white chocolate."
Cameron R.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Slowest service on earth. Sat for a to go order of 3 pieces of cheesecake for over an hour! Get the order home and realize that they left one out. Manager ""James"" unwilling to do anything about this nightmare. Will never do any business with this location. Poor service and apparently even worse management."
Andrea P.,"Huntington Beach, United States",1,21,14,5.0,18/12/2015,"This place is absolutely amazing, the ambience, the service, the food.  For appetizers I recommend the roll sampler, which has, avocado eggrolls, cuban, text mex and firecracker. Also spinach dip and nachos are the best! For entrées, farfalle with roasted garlic and chicken, the crispy chicken costoletta, hibachi steak and Thai glazed salmon. For dessert, they have delicious  desserts besides cheesecakes, tiramisu cake it's amazing, strawberry shortcake, hot fudge sundae and fudge cake.  They definitely have something for everyone."
Jessica G.,"Long Beach, United States",86,157,204,1.0,17/6/2014,I don't know why I keep coming here their food is so bland. Their pasta is TASTELESS.  I get more satisfaction from their apps then anything else. This chain is over rated for sure.
Debbie J.,"Cerritos, United States",41,135,247,2.0,17/6/2016,"The food is good, but the service is not.  After we paid the bill, the waitress was nowhere to be found because we needed a take out box .  We asked another waitress and she said ok, but she never brought it to us.  If we knew where the box was, we would of gotten it by ourselves."
Melissa D.,"Garden Grove, United States",99,28,39,5.0,12/8/2016,Full bar!!! Anything u want & the greatest service. Everyone here is extremely kind & attentive. I didn't have to wait at all for my drink & my appetizers came out hot!! Mike the bartender is such a fun & pleasant guy to talk to & his recommendations are Perf! (And he doesn't skimp on the vodka- plus 100!!!) come here for an afternoon get away. #alwaysGetYour$worth
Kevin P.,"Fountain Valley, United States",26,36,5,5.0,18/4/2016,"Rynn was a great server, very polite. Jillian the manager came over to make sure all was good. The others that came by the table introduced themselves and asked if they could clear away dishes. Dalton, Bridget and Gio, all very helpful and nice. I will be very happy to go back here. I always thought it was a bit snooty, BUT not the case at all. If all restaurants put forth that effort it would be so nice to eat out again!!! Great Job by the whole staff!!! Looking forward to another visit."
Crystal M.,"Seattle, United States",253,227,2001,3.0,27/6/2014,"You want some cheesecake?! Then you're in the right place!!! However... If you want dinner, you're at a very average (wrong) place. Yes the menu is huge!  Yes they have salads, meats, pasta, salad, ect. But they mastered ONLY cheese cakes.  Only. It's a chain and service is always great...  You come for food ultimately.  So 3 stars. I've had many mistakes with them and they always offer to correct these errors.. But ultimately the food is very average.   And overpriced for what it really is.   Sorry not sorry.  #cheesecakeONLY"
James D.,"Midway City, United States",47,7,1,4.0,20/7/2016,I've eaten here atleast once with a couple of my friends. And it was great. I loved everything from foods to customer service. Nice atmosphere too. It's just I wished the place is alittle bigger looking. But other than that. Everything else is good :). Def coming back herein the future
Veronika N.,"Irvine, United States",1,26,13,2.0,6/7/2016,Two stars are only because of the girls in the front. Other than that... Never again! I wonder how come Spectrum Cheesecake Factory puts twice as much food for dinner? I never left restaraunt half hungry but I guess there is a first time for everything. The waiter never checked in my water and I have been sitting without any water for most of my dinner. I also wonder if he knows how to smile??? My son says that probably doesn't. The food is ok. Nothing special.
Marci G.,"Frisco, United States",0,3,,3.0,3/8/2016,My son and I had dinner there on Sunday he ordered the Steak Diane rare they seem to cook it too long on one side and didn't cook it on the other side and it was not rare he was very disappointed I had the chicken Madeira which was the same very good
