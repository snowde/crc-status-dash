Melissa T H.,"The Woodlands, United States",274,465,2054,4.0,9/4/2013,"I have always loved Cheesecake Factory... and with their awesome lunch specials, they have won me over.  My favorite is the Miso Salmon lunch $13.95 - lovely portion of perfectly cooked salmon, on a bed of white or brown rice, a few snap peas to surround it, and served with two sauces.  Tip: I always ask for extra white and  brown sauce on the side. Firecracker Salmon appetizers is another favorite (apparantly there is a smaller version on the SkinnyLicious menu!)  They offer a GREAT raspberry Martini too. Yes, this place is a chain, but what they do, they do so well:  their service is usually efficient, friendly and the portions so big I always share with a friend.  Plus their cheesecakes are really delectable.   The only thing I dislike:  they are famous for long waits during busy times... ah, well."
Jason S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",397,26,3,2.0,24/10/2015,I eat here on a regular basis and normally get the level of service  and quality of food one would expect at a high end chain. Tonight  however has been a disaster.  The pace of service was ridiculous between  order and entree and when the entrees did make it to the table both of our pasta orders were severely undercooked.  Our waitress could see we were not happy bit did not choose to attempt to do anything  about it nor did the manager who's only involvement in our meal was to tell us it would be out soon.   I will definitely eat here again but had this been my first time it would most assuredly be my last.  I feel that tonight's entire team that was involved in my meal needs to be retrained in their customer service skills.
Kittyy M.,"Fullerton, United States",302,100,155,3.0,11/9/2015,"This place is a hit and miss for me. Sometimes i like it and sometimes i dont. I either have a great experience or a bad one, nothing in between. I love giving places second chances because i know they are always looking to improve so thats why i still come here. Im not going to lie, this place has one of they best pasta dishes I've had in a very long time. Every time i come here i have to get some pasta! The last time i was here i found a hair in my pasta and that ruined the whole dish for me. I was pretty mad and of course i complained, the manager completely understood and made it up to me with a comped giant ice cream sundae. Other than that one bad experience, I really haven't had any big issues with them, just little issues like slow service or how they  would mess up my order."
Jack W.,"Huntington Beach, United States",260,174,122,5.0,25/7/2015,"Been here many times and the service has always been 5-star. The food is always sufficient for what you'd expect at a Cheesecake Factory, so I'd say it is 5-star for consistency and Cheesecake Factory caliber.  My 5-star review is in large part for the tan, short-haired male server who helped me and my boyfriend tonight. We only stopped in for a glass of wine and a dessert. When ordering wine, he offered multiple types of Chardonnay - impressive! When I asked if they had a dairy-free and egg-free, he said no but proposed a bowl of fresh strawberries minus the whipped cream - sooooo not expecting such a recommendation for such an atypical question, but WOW is that great customer service! Unfortunately, I don't remember his name (sorry!!).  In addition, he kept our waters filled and a friendly server came to offer us a bread basket. A very nice way to spend a Friday evening before a movie."
Diana S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, United States",73,248,57,5.0,24/6/2014,Ok I love this place. My family and I go there all the time. The service is always great.  Cheesecake in general always has good food. I haven't had anything I didn't like. My favorite thing to get there is the jambalaya  pasta wow so good!  If your looking for quality food go there and 9/10 you cause share one plate of food. My go to place!
Joe C.,"Long Beach, United States",0,5,,5.0,2/6/2015,"I don't know where all the negative comments come from we've been coming here since they opened, never had Mediocre anything and service and staff are great  !! It's usually busy, WELL DUH!!"
Sherree G.,"Westminster, United States",9,19,18,4.0,30/5/2015,"Went here last night with my husband.  Loved the atmosphere, the drinks were great. I had a Ruby Red Sunrise and my husband had the Long Island. Hats off to the bartender!!  We ordered the avocado egg rolls YUM! And the bread was fresh and good.  And our waiter JAMES WAS AWESOME! If you go here ask to be waited on by James. He made sure we were taken care of and was attentive to our table.  Only reason why I gave a 4 star instated of 5 is because our main entrees were not great.  I ordered the Shrimp with Angel Hair and the pasta was poorly cooked, pasta came in chunks stuck together and the shrimp was over cooked and overall dry. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich and it tasted like it was deep fried in old oil that had been used for a while. Maybe they just had an off day but James immediately took care of us.  We ordered another entree and the Ahi salad I ordered and the Cuban sandwich my husband ordered was great!! We will be going back and definitely asking to be seated in James' section.  Cheesecake Factory should be proud to have him on their team!"
Tracie L.,"Orange County, United States",1056,629,3145,5.0,27/7/2012,"This cheesecake factory is close by and I prefer it over the Newport beach or Irvine Spectrum one because there's rarely ever a wait! Service is fast and everytime I come here, I never had a bad waiter/waitress. They're all very friendly and helpful at suggesting different dishes. I wasn't going to write a review til, but after coming yesterday 7/25/12, I had to make sure I finished a review for it. I had a great experience yesterday. My bf & I came w/ his little nephew and waited no longer than 3 mins for a table. Our waitress (Tricia) was a total doll! She got us 2 of the fresh warm right out of the oven wheat bread (their addicting brown bread everyone talks about) as requested since we don't like the sourdough one. The food took a while to arrive, but they were pretty busy that night. So here's where Tricia saved them from being a 4 star: After looking at their nutritional guide menu (LOVE THAT THEY GIVE YOU THIS!!) and skinnylicious menu I decided to get the Island grilled chicken w/ NO SALT and sauce on the side. She got the order right, but the chef over grilled the chicken AND pineapple, it was pretty damn black and gross. I didn't wanna be a lil complaining customer or anything cause my bf & nephew already started eating their food and I was starving so i just ended up trynna cut off the burnt part which was more than half the chicken.. Tricia saw this and said she was more than happy and wanted to bring the plate back and ask them for a new one! She even offered me a dish on the house so that I wouldn't be starving while waiting :) The new plate came out and was BOMB dot com!! grilled perfectly and everything was great. +1 for her customer service My bf had the kobe burger med. rare and it was sooo good. Juicy patty and the mushrooms all mixed well together. We were able to save room for dessert and got their low carb cheesecake w/ strawberries. I know what you're thinking..it's cheesecake factory we're probably over the 2000 calorie limit anyway so why not just get the real shit right? LOL well just for my carb conscious self I thought i'd give it a try to see how it tasted compared to their regular cheesecake. Well..IT TASTED JUST AS GOOD AS THE REGULAR ONE!! I wish they made more low carb cheesecakes especially their oreo one haha. I'll definitely be back for their national cheesecake day July 30th!!"
Jay L.,"Lakewood, United States",74,147,257,5.0,19/4/2015,"I have tremendous respect towards servers who are patient and treat their customers like guests, (party of 9) so James & Alexis, thank you for that. Bless your skillful good-looking selves. You guys were awesome! Pros: - Price is a 5 star, the amount you receive on your plate for what you pay for is well justified. The portions are pretty big! - Menu is endless, theres A LOT to choose from. - EVERYTHING is delicious, it's really quality stuff. Ever payed like $19.99 for a plate that looks good but doesnt taste good? You wont get that here. - Ambiance: its very pretty and classy, ideal for dates, its pretty fancy but its kinda dark. Service was great! My food was great! So my whole ecperience was great. The manager needs a chill pill though. Literally. But Cheesecake Factory might soon become my favorite restaraunt over Olive Garden, weeeeeeee!"
Thomas H.,"Fullerton, United States",1,18,1,1.0,21/5/2015,"Why people queue for this is beyond me. Bland, unoriginal and uninspiring food, accompanied by bland and uninspiring service. The menu is predominantly made up of the same 5 ingredients listed in different orders to create 'different' dishes.  The servers were indifferent, the food slow and dull, the check larger than it should have been... Not to be repeated."
Bri N.,"Garden Grove, United States",0,7,1,1.0,7/1/2017,"I visited  this location  about 2 weeks ago and I will not be back. We waited 30 minutes to get seated which  I understood it was busy, but once we were seated it took us and hour to get our food after we ordered which was served to us cold and not done.."
Vi V.,"Orange County, United States",281,760,3358,3.0,24/3/2014,"Located in the Bella Terra area next to the Barnes and Nobles. Parking is always horrible here, but there's a parking garage if you don't mind the walk. Walked in and the place is pretty dimly lit so it gave off a romantic feel without having to be all dressed up. Cheesecakes are on the left when you walk in if you want to look at it. What we got: Bread & Butter: they bring it out to you after you order. It comes with a brown wheat bread (but sweeter) and a sourdough bread. They bring out butter squares too. The butter is cold so it was hard to spread.  Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll ($13): it was a deep fried sushi roll with tuna inside. It had green onion shreds on top of it and a soy sauce dipping sauce. Not something I would get again. The tuna was all mushy inside, green onion shreds were more like presentation than something edible. Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta ($17): our server said this was his favorite dish and I can see why. Comes with chicken, asparagus, peas, and tortilla strips on top of penne pasta with a spicy chipotle sauce. I thought it was really good and they give you a lot so I was able to have it for lunch the next day. Big chunks of chicken, but they didn't have much flavor. The veggies inside the pasta were soft and actually tasted pretty good. I loved the spicy chipotle sauce though, not too spicy, but does have a nice kick. I just wish the pasta was cooked a little longer because it was too al dente for me. Steak Diane ($20): cuts of angus beef steak covered with mushrooms and grilled onions and a side of mashed potatoes. Steak was cooked perfectly and it was soft and juicy, but my favorite thing would probably have to be the mushrooms. I don't know what they did to it but it was so good! It was soft and had so much flavor to it. Mashed potatoes were creamy, but nothing made it stand out from any other mashed potatoes. Service: Our server that night was Kyle. Friendly guy and would make conversations with us. He was quick to refill our water glasses and getting us anything else we needed. Quick taking away our finished dishes as well."
David D.,"Huntington Beach, United States",121,5,11,1.0,5/7/2016,This is the second time in a month we visited this particular location.  Food is usually good but the last time it was so so and this time even worse. We were seated pretty quickly and our service was fairly prompt.  That was where it ended.  Our food came out in segments to each of our party so we didn't eat together.  I ordered the club sandwich and it was horrible. Our sever all but disappeared after she took our order.  All around next time we visit Bella terra for a movie I'll chose someplace else to eat.
Julie S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",2,44,93,5.0,31/5/2016,"This place is always amazing!!  I've never had a problem at any location of Cheesecake Factories that I've been to.  They always have great service, AMAZING food and great atmosphere.  You have to try their buffalo blasts for an appetizer, their chicken madeira for dinner and any one of their amazing cheesecakes!!  Everything on their menu is amazing so you can't choose a bad one.  BUT you have to try what I listed haha"
Clara L.,"Irvine, United States",56,1,7,1.0,6/3/2015,"I was calling to make a reservation for tonight since on this website, it CLEARLY states they take reservations. I call, no one picks up for the longest time, and finally Portia picks up. I ask to make reservations and she informs me that they don't. I just wanted to clarify so I tell her it says online they do. She responds only certain Cheesecakes do. So I just wanted to help out other Yelpers and recommend they ask to change it on yelp so no one else calls for reservations, and she immediately hang ups on me.  Definitely changed my mind of ever coming to this location."
David G.,"Scottsdale, United States",74,27,5,1.0,10/8/2014,Food was ok. Just ok.  Service was not ok. Dirty plates left on table. I even moved them to the next table over and they stayed there.  A steak knife can 10 minutes after the meal. Fun times. Just annoyed.
Brittany W.,"Long Beach, United States",21,38,6,3.0,7/5/2016,"I enjoy the food however there are so many options that I usually have a hard time deciding on what to order. I love the jambalaya, it is so delicious. My favorite part of course is dessert, yummy yummy cheesecake."
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, United States",340,547,167,4.0,1/6/2014,"First & foremost, my favorite thing about this place is the brown bread with LOTS of butter. I've heard people say its pumpernickel, I've heard people say its wheat - I've heard lots of things, so I am sticking to calling it the BROWN BREAD. I can just eat that & i'll be happy.  But, that's not really a meal now.. so i ordered the Cajun Chicken Littles & my boyfriend ordered the fish & chips. Everything came out great. Our Waitress was really nice, I believe her name was Haley or something. Nice restaurant inside a nice shopping plaza. Parking is pretty bad depending on when you go but other then that, it was all good"
Sandra M.,"Los Angeles, United States",11,202,7,2.0,14/5/2015,"The service was excellent and the restaurant is beautiful. I love the ambiance of the location and the waiter was attentive.  However, Cheesecake Factory is so overrated. I wouldn't mind the high expensive prices for their meals but do they have to kill us with their high calorie and sodium food? I normally don't eat in unhealthy places like this but I went for a work meeting. I ordered the miso salmon which is about 5-6oz of Salmon (great size piece) and white rice. How bad can that be? BAD! 1180 calories and 940 sodium. I didn't have time to look this up before my meeting. Next time plane salad with everything on the side. By the way this is one of the less expensive plates at $14."
Hex B.,"Anaheim, United States",18,30,8,2.0,16/12/2015,This place has a great atmosphere. I always love Cheesecake Factory from east coast to Los Angeles. I love the one in marina Del Rey but this particular location sucks. The food taste bland and the service sucks. We got a jambalaya and its so dry. The server rarely check how we are doing. We sat there for 15 minutes after we came in and no server available. When she arrive and got our order it took forever for her to come back and never checked back how the food was. We have to keep flagging her. I would never come back to this location ever again and I would never recommend this location to anybody else.
