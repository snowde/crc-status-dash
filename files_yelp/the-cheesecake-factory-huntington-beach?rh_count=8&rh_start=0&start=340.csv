Shana A.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States",5,52,60,4.0,20/6/2015,"The only thing I order from the Cheesecake Factory is the garden vegetable salad minus the tomatoes/cheese with a ton of their ranch dressing & I'm in food heaven. :) I wish the salad was a little bigger because when I order it to go versus eating there,  I'm always still hungry after consuming it & I think it's smaller. Ohhhhh and let's not forget about the brown oat bread they give. I could eat like 5 loaves of that delicious mouthwatering bread but I have to be a good girl & limit myself ;)"
Azy J.,"Los Angeles, United States",1,35,14,3.0,4/5/2016,I went there for late lunch around 3 pm. Although there were maybe 5 tables and 5 servers available it still took 10 minutes to be seated. The boss wasn't there and the girls were just enjoying their time! Food was ok ! Our server thou was vey pleasant!!
Marla M.,"Laguna Niguel, United States",0,15,11,4.0,30/5/2016,"We ordered the burgers and lime cheesecake for dessert. The burgers were awesome, as was the service. The lime cheesecake was TART! It was a busy night and still a good dinner out."
Jay A.,"Lakewood, United States",207,300,420,4.0,14/6/2014,"Thought I reviewed this place before but guess not. Great service and amazing food! The portions are as big as my face, which can be a good thing, but turrible if you're trying to watch your figure.  But damn is the food tasty. Make sure to order the fried mac n cheese balls!  So tasticle!  Most if not all of the food I've ordered have been really great.  From the salad to the salmon....everything just had that special dash of flavor to get you addicted. Oh tried the Mango Keylime Cheesecake as well as the S'mores Cheesecake.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!! That is all."
Derek I.,"Portland, United States",182,352,74,2.0,18/5/2014,"Cheesecake Factory used to be the spot in HS, but either my taste buds have found better things or the food just isn't it anymore. The portions are meant for 2 people and the vast menu could be helped by going on a diet and focusing on making the quality and taste better on fewer dishes.  I feel like the oil is old since I had a funny stomach. This is a pass."
Paula B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,23,,5.0,11/5/2016,"My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary. We ordered, and his meal came within a decent time frame, but we waited and waited for mine. I didn't want his food to get cold, so I insisted he start without me. About the time he was finished with his dinner, I  asked to see the manager. The manager was so apologetic, and went to the kitchen to see what the problem was. The waited was very apologetic also. The manager felt so bad, he comped our dinner and also treated us to a piece of cheesecake. Both the waiter and the manager came to our table to apologize again and again, and to tell us how badly they felt, and that they take these matters seriously.  I probably should be giving the restaurant a lower rating because of the food situation, but we left feeling that we were treated more than fairly, and that they were truly sorry for what happened. Mistakes are made at times, but the way it was handled was very professional and sincere. I'll definitely be back!"
Rachel S.,"Bellflower, United States",215,63,60,4.0,3/3/2014,"I've never been disappointed when coming to this location. It's in a beautiful area, and the lighting on the inside is not as dim as most cheesecake factory's which is a plus hah.  I typically get the same thing- the chicken Bellagio. Although we did have to wait longer than expected, the manager came out and apologized for the wait. When our plates came out, the presentation on each was flawless. Attetion to detail was in play here both visually and in flavor. My mom's birthday cheesecake was gorgeous as well! Well done chef's. Our waiter was friendly as well. Another great experience."
AJ C.,"Santa Ana, United States",60,88,9,5.0,6/2/2016,"My girlfriend and I came here on Wednesday night for dinner. She received a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory for Christmas. So we decided to come for dinner. We ordered the egg roll sampler, my girlfriend ordered the lemon herb chicken and I ordered the Italian sandwich. The egg rolls pretty good although my favorite out of the platter would be the southwestern egg rolls (a must try). Our entrées came next. The sandwich was big and delicious I ordered it with a salad. But the salad seemed as if I was dressed early and sitting in a bowl. It was soggy and wilted when it came out to our table. The chicken was juicy and moist. But overly salty. We immediately told our server and sent her manager to our table with the complaint for her dish. He apologized for the over seasoned food and took the chicken off from our bill. Service 5/5 Hospitality 5/5 Food 4.5/5"
Mike K.,"Santa Ana, United States",1,16,12,5.0,21/2/2016,We love this place!  Great food. Outstanding service. I never have to ask for my refills. The staff there are very friendly and professional. The food is always made just right. Sometimes I order breakfast disc for dinner and that is okay. Lots to do when you are there. Amc theater is right across from it and Barnes and nobles is next door. Great hangout place.
Kathy H.,"Huntington Beach, United States",55,28,24,3.0,29/1/2016,This location is in Bella Terra! The parking here is horrible. It is very spacious and big here. A lot of variety of food. Service was a little slow on a Friday night. Food was overall decent.
J A.,"Orange County, United States",191,336,32,4.0,4/12/2015,I've come in to the Bella Terra for few lunch/dinner times. I like OMG!! The Orange Chicken is to die for! Perfectly crisp and definitely freshly made...You must try it!
Mr P.,"Fountain Valley, United States",0,6,4,3.0,13/5/2016,"I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in quite a long time. It was not as good as I remember. The food was lacking flavor and one of the appetizers I ordered was not available, pretty disappointing. Our waitress was good but it seemed they gave her quite a few tables to cover which delayed her. It's not her fault, she did everything she could and was polite when she came to check up on us."
Vy T.,"Orange County, United States",1266,1067,3107,4.0,20/2/2014,"I tend to stay away from franchises because I like supporting local businesses and having a unique menu to choose from but Cheesecake factory has my heart for a couple of reasons.  One, their bread is amazing and usually comes out nice and warm. Their brown bread is soo good, I crave it all the time. I don't know what they put in it, but I can never stop eating it. Two, their Louisiana pasta is amazing...I love the cajun sauce with the bowtie pasta. It comes with crispy chicken, and is to die for.  Three, Their cheesecake is good, decadent and rich. I like their white chocolate chip macadamia nut and pumpkin.  Four, the ambience is intimate  and dimly lit. Their wait is usually not that long.  For these reasons, I continue to come back here."
Eileen A.,"Garden Grove, United States",34,26,,1.0,15/2/2016,This is hands down the worst location I've been to. The service is horrendous and my food was not so great. The waiter kept forgetting our appetizers and we had to remind him 3 or 4 times we wanted them to sing Happy Birthday to my niece. I have been to this location a few times ( only because I'm invited for bday celebrations) and everytime it's the same thing long waits and horrible service and the food was not so great! Cheesecake factory I will never return to this location again!
Shooter M.,"Long Beach, United States",4,22,3,4.0,14/7/2015,"Went here for dinner last week on a Friday night. Got there sometime between 9-10pm so it wasn't too busy. Was told we would be seated in about 2 mins, it was probably closer to 10mins and people that arrived after us were seated before us. Don't know why that happened. :/ We sat outside, it was very pleasant. Wasn't that cold but they had gas lamps on just in case anyone did feel cold.  Had avocado egg rolls for appetiser, they were awesome! I had steak Diane for my main meal, the steak was amazing, 5 stars just for that. The mashed potato was just ok. Food was ok priced. Didn't have any drinks besides water.  Love this place and will prob return soon"
Amaya S.,"Redlands, United States",783,486,855,3.0,21/5/2012,"3 1/2 Stars! Let me explain why I didn't give this Location a 4 star review.... because I really did enjoy myself.  Its mainly because of the location and the lack of view.  Sorry to be so picky.  But its in a crowded shopping center, nothing to special about that.... Parking is a madhouse here so be ready. Either park in the garage that is 2 city blocks away (not really, but it helps my story), or patrol the lot with force.   As with any Cheesecake Factory is decorated nice and everyone is nice.  I've been to quite a few CFs and have never had a bad experience.  My waitress was very hospitable and kind which makes their push to sell cheesecake at the end palpable.  Funny I'm always to full for the cheesecake. I started off with a Blueberry Mojito.  YUM. I'm a girl who loves a good mojito, hell I love a bad mojito too as long as it has liquor.  This one was sweet and tart with a minty after taste. And I was slightly buzzed.  I ordered the Bleu Cheese BLT with Fries.  Delicious.  While I hate Bleu Cheese Dressing I LOVE the crumbles, weird.  The burger was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and the bacon was crispy.  The fries were seasoned well, especially with my side of ranch.  Whatever you do DON'T order the Mac and Cheese Burger..... mid-way through I got so depressed that I was eating a Burger topped with Fried Mac and Cheese, seriously. Nice place for lunch, but a date..... drive to the Newport Location."
Kiara S.,"Westminster, United States",6,2,,1.0,23/3/2015,"This is the worst experience  at cheesecake factory  that i have  ever had, our waiter is in such a hurry that he forgot to bring us bread and he also is very very rude. I'm  very close to talking  to his manager."
Christopher G.,"Garden Grove, United States",32,86,,4.0,3/11/2014,"We were gonna head on down to a fancy joint on PCH but stopped here.  On Sunday night, parking is a little hectic.  Got seated in about 4 minutes.  Waiter was cool.  Ordered Tuscan Chicken(the ball and chain) and White Chicken Chili(moi)with brown rice. I would have liked a bit more rice and beans in the chili, but there was LOADS of chicken and it's very savory.  The Tuscan Chicken is served with balsamic vinegarette and has asparagus and grape tomatoes.aplenty. Both dishes were excellent. There was a funny lack of communication about the cheesecake.  My wife sez she wants Key Lime and waiter asks if she wants to split it.  She says, ""No, I want the whole thing"".  Apparently he thinks she means a whole cheesecake b/c he says, ""You can't cut it for about an hour and a half.  It's deep-frozen.""  It took a minute or two to get that straightened out, and I had some kind of totally obscene chocolate cake, of which I could only eat half, so I had the other half for breakfast. Like you would have waited till lunch?"
Cat N.,"Orange County, United States",4271,1319,5866,4.0,16/9/2011,"Lunch with the girlfriend =) Came in for lunch and waited for about 5 minutes before getting seated.  We were seated outside by request and it ended up being too windy.  We asked our server if we can be moved and we choose to sit behind the water fountain instead.  It was much better but we got sprinkled on a little.  I ordered the fettucini alfredo with chicken and sun dried tomatoes (lunch portion).  My girlfriend ordered the greek salad.  We shared the asian lettuce wraps.  My fettucini was very good.  It was large enough that I did not finish the lunch size that I took some home.  The lettuce wraps were large and it was alright.  I could have skipped it.  My girlfriends greek salad was TINY.  Extremely small.  No wonder it was on the skinny menu.  It looked like a side dish.  For dessert, we ordered the banana cheesecake.  It was delicious.  It was not too rich and not too sweet.  It was perfect.   As for service, the girl that served us was very helpful and very nice.  Our total was $31 without tax for our lunch with dessert.   I have included photos for our lunch."
Theresa D.,"Garden Grove, United States",211,256,145,4.0,8/4/2014,"I'm reviewing on cheesecake alone since I haven't had the food here for years. I don't know of any other place that has so much variety in cheesecake flavors. There's something for everyone.  The following are the ones we bought: Kalua, Tiramisu, Oreo. They were all delicious, and I love the whipped cream. My favorite is still the Godiva chocolate cheesecake."
