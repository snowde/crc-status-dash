Jozie L.,"Buena Park, United States",569,301,334,3.0,15/8/2013,"Lunch special:  * Chicken Vegetable Tortilla Soup with Garden Salad.  Very good.   * 1/2 order of Pecan Encrusted Catfish served with a medley of vegetables and mashed potatoes. Very good.   Excellent service by hostess and wait staff. Before leaving we decided to purchase a cheesecake. While the attendant was busy with one customer he never acknowledged our presence. The customer he was serving asked a multitude of questions because she was buying various slices of cheesecake and was comparing the price of buying one whole cake to several individual slices. While I understand some customers will require more time, it only takes a moment to say, ""I'll be with you in a moment."" He never did. And he almost took another customer before helping us until another server stopped to remind him we were waiting. We stood at the counter directly next to the previous customer. I don't know how he missed us. No tip for him."

Erica W.,"Garden Grove, United States",0,6,,3.0,15/3/2015,"Went to brunch today for a girls luncheon and I usually have a lovely time at the Cheesecake Factory. However, I am not sure if it was because of the nice weather, our server, or it being Sunday Brunch, but the patio service was very very slow. It took 20 minutes to get our cocktails- I had walked to the restroom and myself being a bartender knew what to look for as I passed the bar and noticed our drinks sitting there. Our food was quite slow to hit the table, and I am not sure if it was our server's first busy patio shift, but the pre-bussing, bussing, and check presentation took way too long.  The food was in large and delicious portions when it did arrive and the patio atmosphere was gorgeous and inviting on this scorching heat wave. Having management experience in the corporate Hospitality industry, I was not impressed today at Cheesecake. Hopefully when I return over the summer months it will prove me to be a one-time bad experience."
Nasser S.,"Gardena, United States",0,2,,5.0,11/11/2016,"The food are awesome! Me and my friend are really excited everytime we schedule a dinner or lunch in this restaurant. Not to mention, prices are reasonable too."
Mike A.,"Long Beach, United States",253,36,2,4.0,27/11/2015,"Cheesecake factory is always a hit in my opinion... But I went for lunch last week, and the fish and chips that I got had some raw batter, and my friends spaghetti and meatball was very salty... But the pumpkin pecan cheesecake was an absolute delight!"
Rob W.,"Huntington Beach, United States",327,441,710,2.0,30/7/2013,Decided to stop into the Cheesecake Factory and grab a slice of cheesecake for National Cheesecake day. I waited 30 mins to order my cheesecake and after ordered it they told me it would be 45 minutes before I received my cheesecake. This was a major epic FAIL.  It gets much better.  I go home and come back to get my cheesecake and they tell me another 25 minutes.  I decide to get a bite of food at the bar and all in all it took 1 hour and 35 minutes before my cheesecake was ready.  This was a to-go order.  I would have thought they would be much better prepared than this. What a big waste of time.   I got the new s'mores cheesecake and it was good. Cheesecake Factory please prepare better when you do a big promo.
Nick S.,"Orange County, United States",763,94,123,4.0,3/10/2014,"You know that old saying ""There ain't no celebration like a cheesecake celebration""?  Well I just made it up and it applies to your life now.    We came here last night to celebrate my girlfriend's new job!  Wooo cheesecake!... I mean congrats babe?  Anyways, after a quick 10 minute wait (Thursday night), we got our booth for 4.  The service here is always very nice, but also consistently slow.  For example, our water would always check in with us every time he walked by, but when we asked for more bread, it wasn't at our table for another 10 mintues.  I think the servers there are maybe a bit understaffed because they always seem to be rushing somewhere to help with another table.   Drinks: I'm the only table alcoholic, so I was the only one to order a drink.  I got a Hendricks Tonic w/ Lime and Cucumber and I gotta say they have pretty heavy pours here.  definitely not complaining though haha. Food: I'm actually not a really big fan of their food here.  We always seem to get calamari for the app and without fail, each time we order it, it gets smaller and smaller!  Last night's calamari was a plate with a napkin folded in half on it, with the actual calamari only put on top of that half napkin... it was honestly only good for 1 person's worth of food.  For entrees, my lady for some unbeknownst reason, swears by their chicken fettecini alfredo with sun dried tomatoes.  I guess she really loves bland sauce tossed with store bought (my guess) pasta and a couple of sun dried tomatoes thrown on top... but who knows?  maybe I'm the one with a terrible palate.  I ordered the chicken little - fried chicken breast strips with mash and veggies.  Let me clarify, this plate isn't bad, but also isn't great.  I only got it because I remembered it was huge - and this time was no exception.  After getting some sriracha (obviously), I devoured the plate and was definitely full. Dessert: Our awesome waiter came up to us towards the end of our meal and apologized for the slow service.  To make up for it, he actually threw in a free slice of cheesecake!  *CUE heavens opening up and harp music. We let him surprise us with his favorite underrated slice and a minute later he showed up with a S'Mores Cheesecake slice.  I was a bit skeptical, but after my first bite, SOLD!  The S'mores CC is amazing here.  It comes with a golden brown marhmellow melted over a rich creamy chocolate cheesecake, topped with whipped cream.  I don't think I wouldve been able to finish it by myself, so sharing was perfect for us 4. Overall:  4/5 stars.  I totally understand their slower service, and definitely appreciated the free slice at the end!  Food, meh... Cheesecake MMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ^^check out my pictures.  I hope this review was helpful!"
Jean M.,"Long Beach, United States",114,49,215,4.0,23/5/2015,"Such a great place with many options; however, they have so many options it's a little overwhelming. The food was great though! We got the fried crispy cheese, onion rings, and Parmesan garlic bread for appetizers, which were all amazing. My boyfriend loved the strawberry cheesecake and teriyaki chicken. I absolutely loved the four cheese pasta and Hershey bar cheesecake. I also got a tropical martini which was phenomenal. He waitress was very nice too."
Jason C.,"Huntington Beach, United States",63,44,80,3.0,12/10/2014,"The service was good, but the food sucked. I  ordered fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp. It was extremely bland. Not worth the $50 for food and two beers.  What also sucked is that they don't put a minimum temperature on the heaters for the outside heating. I had to deal with a heater being on when it was 70 degrees outside because of some woman that doesn't like wearing clothes to dinner."
Sophie N.,"Garden Grove, United States",14,32,,5.0,1/11/2015,"I love coming here for the Louisiana Chicken pasta! Also, the cheesecakes are good too!"
Tina T.,"Westminster, United States",101,141,66,3.0,19/1/2014,"I got the pasta di vinci with linguine instead of bow-tie pasta, and it was delicious :) However, my bf got one of their steak dishes, and it was reaaaally undercooked :( It was supposed to be Medium Rare, but came out reaaally rare. EEKS! Aside from that, the service was pretty good. Our waters were never empty."
Dan T.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,9,2,5.0,27/4/2016,"Never disappointed. Nice staff, great service and food is consistently excellent. Chicken Carbonara pasta"
Brian F.,"Lakewood, United States",158,270,170,4.0,8/3/2015,"Pasta Da Vinci!  The best dish in the place.   I like to visit Cheesecake Factory when I'm feeling like taking in 3000 calories (very easy to do here).  The food is great, although the menu sprawls WAY too many pages.  Didn't ANY restaurant consultant *ever* say the larger the menu, the worse the food?  Might be slightly true - as whenever someone comes with me, they don't like the food.  I just order my tried and true pasta and I'm happy.   The downside (and it's rather minor) is parking at this side of the Bella Terra kinda sucks.  The front end parking lot is small and always crowded.  Valet is a good option."
Joe M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, United States",56,10,1,1.0,13/5/2015,Worst cheese cake factory restaurant I have ever been too. On a weekly basis I come in a group of 10+ and they don't know how to handle big parties even though 80% of their seats are always empty at the time we arrive
Ariana S.,"Long Beach, United States",0,2,,2.0,16/10/2014,"Came in on Monday evening around 9pm with my partner on a date.  Let me start by saying the server was really nice, the timing of the food was perfect, and the food itself was delicious.  However, when we got there and asked for a table outside, the host said no. As I have worked in the restaurant industry for ten years (until last week :D ), I understand about sections closing, etc. However, what is the point of closing a desirable outside patio section at 9pm when you don't close the restaurant for another two hours and I could see several tables out there eating their dinners on the walk up. Be accommodating! That's your job. Besides, we would have tipped well. At the end of our meal, we had only eaten half of the food because it was a lot (we had each ordered combination plates). The server took it to box it up, and did not return for a while. When she did, it was to inform us that ""someone accidentally threw it away and the kitchen is cooking new food"" for us. No worries! We thought, well now we will have extra food, which is always cool. We got desert and eventually she delivered three boxes in a bag which was our replacement to go food.  When we got home and looked inside, there were no mashed potatoes at all, despite the fact that there had been A LOT of the tasty potatoes left originally. Also, there was a very small amount of steak in one box, which we had each left half of on our plates. The chicken and salmon were fine. I just don't understand why, after paying 90$ for our meal and tipping 20%, this was acceptable. I don't know if it was the servers memory, the kitchen manager being cheap, or just people not caring.  At any rate, we probably won't go back. I'm sure they can be good and it was just a fluke, but when you are spending over 100$ on a meal, ""somebody"" should not throw your food away and ""somebody"" should not forget to replace it."
Lea S.,"Tulare, United States",0,10,,2.0,7/4/2017,"I typically love The Cheesecake Factory, and I always get the same thing, the hibachi steak. Tonight I ordered it from door dash so I could enjoy it at home. I didn't mind that after fees and a 20% tip for the driver I paid about 12 dollars extra for the convenience but I regret doing so. I anticipated that it wouldn't be AS good as at the restaurant but it was a pretty bad experience. I received the food without any napkins or silverware, which was unexpected but obviously I could fix that problem. The steak was cooked properly and had good flavor but there wasn't any tempura asparagus, which was really disappointing. There was a very small amount of sprouts and the other vegetables to top it all off, next time I want to eat at home I will be sure to go somewhere else. I'll stick to only dining in when I'm craving the Cheesecake Factory. A bit of a bummer I spent a decent amount of money on such a disappointing meal."
Em H.,"Garden Grove, United States",16,91,153,1.0,10/5/2015,"I have been to this location probably 3 times, and tonight was the fourth and need to write a review about this. My first time was years ago with my ex and I was young didn't know much about food. Came here 2 time with my bf and my taste bud has changed over the years. I DIDNT like what I ordered. I came here third times with my parents and my kid...my experience and taste bud still has not changed one bit. We waited over an hour for a frozen cheesecake, was not fresh when order so we cancelled.  Let's make the story short. I had GNO tonight and one of my girlfriend wants to come here because she craved for Hibachi steak. I have told them how I dislike this place and food are so terrible. They convinced me and I decided to give another try.  My experience tonight: order mojito during happy hour. The drink contains mild of alcohol and too much ice. (No wonder it's on happy hour menu)  Calamari: the only dish that we finished and taste good. The bad thing about this there were 2 popcorn chicken in our calamari. The manager came to our table informed us one of the plate gonna take another 10 minute because they have to change season. Told her there were chicken in our calamari, her respond? ""Oh, I'm sorry. Let me check in the kitchen and make sure it won't happen again.""  I order Diane steak, well done (can't stand pink...weh weh) first of all, most of my pieces are burnt, therefore, I cut off most of the layers. Mash potatoes cold outside but warm inside. Very odd...usually a well prepared food from a fine restaurant should be hot....not under room temperature to cold. Even my mushroom was cold, not warm but cold. Overall, I would definitely not coming back. Everyone have a different opinions about Cheesecake Factory, but mine I regret and waste my money tonight. I should have convince my friends and try Z'tejas, food would have been better."
Rob R.,"Boise, United States",1,218,5,4.0,10/5/2015,"Always a good choice when you're hungry and can't decide what to at. The menu is extensive. In most cases, too many choices equals mediocre fare. The Cheesecake Factory does everything well.  When it's busy, it can take awhile to be seated and served. Food orders can also drag. Fortunately, they bring drinks and warm bread out quickly.  I've tried pasta dishes, burgers, chicken dishes, Asian influenced dishes and have never been disappointed. And then there is the cheesecake. Oh boy! Every bite screams calories, but how can something that tastes sooooooo gooooood be so bad for you. Do yourself a fave and take a slice home if you're too full. You can always hit the gym ""tomorrow""."
Qaz W.,"Fullerton, United States",1,10,2,5.0,4/8/2015,"Food quality was excellent. Food delivery was just the slightest bit slow, but they were quite busy. I was so full I didn't eat dinner!  The only negative was the small chip of glass that had fallen in one of our party's napkin. She cut her hand and the management gave her her entree free. Very polite. Gave us at least 4 band-aids. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!"
Lydia S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",202,100,196,3.0,18/3/2015,"My waitress was very attentive and helpful while I was trying to decide what drink to order, after immediately haven't given her my order for lettuce wraps. The stars are for the wraps, she never came back to check on me until I begged for a box I think the manager  buried the help, frankly, and to be fair . Gnarly. Mojito expensive without the bag hie the buck.  So much for the bar section tonight."
