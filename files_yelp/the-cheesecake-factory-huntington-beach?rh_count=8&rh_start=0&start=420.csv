Linda T.,"Long Beach, United States",132,399,69,4.0,14/6/2015,"The food is always great at Cheesecake Factory and this location is really nice. The parking is hard to find but they also offer valet. The service was great, very friendly server that constantly came to check on us. I love their Louisiana Pasta, and we took a fresh strawberry slice of cheesecake to go and it was divine! It was a lovely night out with my husband."
Samantha T.,"Long Beach, United States",37,70,1104,5.0,1/11/2014,This is one of my favorite place. Hubby and I have not been disappointed at all. You have to try the salmon firecracker rolls. The are awesome. My favorite entree there is the Shrimp-BLT. I love schrimp and bacon. Its the perfect combination. Hubby tries something new everytime we come here. Our favorite cheesecake is the red velvet cheesecake. You have to try the strawberry lemonade. You get a lot of food when you come here. I always have leftover food that i can have the next day for lunch. We come here at least 1 a months.
Chantel R.,"Westminster, United States",2,9,,5.0,8/9/2014,"I love this location and restaurant. So many negative reviews are people who think they're some kind of food critic for the food network. Get over it. I love this place and yes sometimes the bread is stale or the food will be a little cold and heaven forbid the pen not work when you're signing your check! Not everyone gets to eat at a place like this, or even eat out at all. So stop complaining about little things and enjoy the fact that you can even be served food that you don't need to cook/clean up after/ or beg for."
Ralph C.,"Signal Hill, United States",43,191,2,3.0,12/11/2015,Been a fan of this place for a long time...last couple times been very dissapointed. Service was slow and unfriendly. The quality of food not what it use to be or worth the price.
Remie M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",864,652,525,4.0,23/4/2014,this is the closest one to my work.   good ol bella terra.  I would always come to this location when I lived in HB! Cheesecake factory has always been a staple of when I don't know where to eat.   With their book of choices to eat.  Portion sizes are HUGE and recommended to share. Their avocado rolls are my favorite.  The stuffed mushrooms and fried chicken sliders are always good.  Mostly everything on the menu is tasty and filling.  Can't go wrong with ur selection!  Staff is friendly.  Atmosphere is modern and spacey.  Reminds me of a buffet place in Las Vegas.   Parking is kind of hectic.  There is a parking structure but its a little ways to get to the resto.
Sandra Y.,"Tustin, United States",2,21,1,2.0,15/6/2014,"I just came in here to pick out some cheesecake like around 3:45-4PMish and the place was not the least bit crowded or busy, yet somehow I stood there waiting for almost 20 minutes. Possibly longer. I wasn't the only person standing there waiting on them. I know the waiter/tresses saw me and my anticipation for some cheesecake yet none of them bothered to assist me in any way. If it took this long to get a ready made cheesecake literally a few inches away from me, I wonder how long it'd take to have a dine-in meal there.  I've gone a few times by the way. Other times were no better in terms of customer service."
Kelley G.,"Raleigh, United States",0,3,,1.0,20/10/2016,"Worst experience we have ever had at a Cheescake Factory.  My shrimp was so over cooked it was dry and rubber like. The pasta the shrimp sat upon was literally dry.  When you went to eat it the entire pile of pasta came with your fork.   My husbands burger was to be medium rare.  It arrived burned and dry.  Server never came back to check on food.  When he came to deliver the check he asked if we want boxes for our completely uneaten plates.  Did not ask if there was a problem.  We hadn't eaten our food. My daughter plate was fine.  Clearly there was a problem.  We expressed our concerns about the food.  He said ""Oh sorry"" and left us our $75.00 bill.  Did not offer to resolve nor get manager or at the minimum provide us with eatable plates of food.  We paid bill left no tip.  Did not take food and went to Del Taco afterward.  Del Taco was really good.  Will never go back to the Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach."
Joe M.,"Bellflower, United States",6,22,12,5.0,5/6/2015,"Love this place, service and the food is awesome! The best cheesecake in the world. And also you must have the baked salmon!"
Emily F.,"Redding, United States",0,4,,1.0,30/12/2016,"My boyfriend and I are Cheesecake Factory regulars - often coming more than once a week, and always spending plenty of money each time as we always order drinks, appetizers, meals and dessert. The food is always excellent. However, the service we received by Breeann P is why we will never be back to this location. She never greeted us, only said ""what would you like to drink?"" She never offered us bread so we had to specifically request it when she came to take our order. She never visited our table, and when she did she always had other table's dirty dishes and hardly said a word to us. (Mind you this whole time we have been nothing but patient and kind to her, just slightly baffled at how inattentive she has been compared to how the service at Cheesecake Factory usually is). My boyfriend and I both waited over 15 minutes for a drink refill. When we got our food, she did not check up on us at all. We managed to flag her down for the bill, and when she asked us if we would like it to be boxed, we said yes. Then she proceeded to ask us to HAND HER THE PLATES even though she was standing right in front of our table. Because of the lack of service, we hadn't eaten much between the time our food was brought out and when we wanted to leave, so I had to pick up my multiple and heavy plates, still full of food, to hand her across the table - absolutely unprofessional. I would give 0 stars for the service if I could."
Trisha B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",85,168,175,3.0,31/3/2013,"They have removed my most very favorite skinnylicious menu item from the menu. The island chicken used to be the best thing on the menu, and you could eat it for less than 600 calories. It is an absolute tragedy that they removed that from the menu. If the managers read these reviews: PLEASE BRING BACK THE ISLAND CHICKEN! Also, Dylan is the very best server of anywhere ever, so if others are reading this, ask to be seated in his station. And managers: if you remove the avocado egg rolls, I might have a heart attack, so please don't get rid of those too."
Elizabeth E.,"Santa Ana, United States",9,4,1,5.0,8/1/2016,Service was good food was great I loved everything I would definitely come back specially for the red velvet cheesecake yummy
Laura Q.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,9,,1.0,22/1/2016,"Worst service EVER!!!!!! After being seated by the hostess, had to wait 10min for our waitress to arrive to our table. And the place was dead; like literally empty. My husband and I got there right as they opened. Waited 45 minutes for our food. We ordered an appetizer but that arrived AFTER our meals!!!!!!! Waitress never came to check on us to ask questions like "" is everything ok? How does the food taste? Is there anything you need?"" Never even came by to refill our drinks! Then after we finished our food, waitress cleaned up our table and didn't offer the dessert menu. We had to track her down and ask to see one. She was very unfriendly the entire time and by far the WORST waitress I've ever had.  This isn't even all that happened from this horrible experience. Wanted to say just enough so you get the idea.  Bottom line, will never come back! The food just isn't worth it."
Ashley S.,"Newport Coast, United States",105,54,19,5.0,7/11/2015,Evening of dimly lit conversation....toasting midweek with a shared slice of White Chocolate Raspberry Cheese Cake...it couldn't have been a more lovely place...to vacation from ourselves.
Robert T.,"Huntington Beach, United States",2,46,1,4.0,5/11/2014,"Typical CheeseCake Factory, always consistent at every location... Parking really really suck!"
Marissa L.,"Newport Coast, United States",9,8,,4.0,14/1/2016,"I like this location because I've never had to deal with a wait. Service is average, food is good, menu extensive, and their cheesecake is my biggest guilty pleasure. Parking is hard due to this location being at Bella Terra shopping plaza, but there is a valet option available. I love their skinnylicious menu. Makes me feel less guilty after consuming their complimentary basket of bread."
Cindy G.,"Lakewood, United States",0,4,,5.0,19/11/2015,"I was 3/4ths of almost finishing my meal (Louisiana chicken pasta) and I find a long piece of hair underneath my chicken and I know it's not mine nor my friends because she has short hair and so does my brother. I told the waiter and he was so nice about it, he offered to make me another one. The service was great, the food was better."
Theresa D.,"Santa Monica, United States",32,31,23,5.0,26/9/2015,Love this place!!! Always busy during dinner and the weekend! Great selection of food and known for their cheesecake! They started the craze of different flavors!!! Food with family and friends!
Lee S.,"Orange County, United States",19,36,11,5.0,16/10/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the best consistent great quality restaurants I have ever eaten at, from the orange chicken to the burgers. If you like great cheesecake you will love this place."
Dee D.,"Costa Mesa, United States",2,12,5,2.0,15/10/2015,"To take reservations within the first hour, okay I understand. But when I call and it's still within the first hour and there is a few minutes until it isn't is not cool. You could have easily taken it especially since it will be a surprise and I can't just simply go and put my name with said person with me! Maybe it would be important to note that because not everyone is aware of that it is a huge inconvenience. It was 6 people. That's not big. I'm a hostess and a former one for a huge corporate business and I would definitely try and help the customer and not just simply say, ""no, sorry, we only take reservations in the first hour."" Hello, I called at 11:50... Thanks a lot! And I'm a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory."
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, United States",582,1424,6023,4.0,17/8/2010,"Yes! Another chain that I'm a fan of.  I know that it goes against supporting all the ""mom & pop"" establishments however, if the chains offer what the smaller places don't - what's a guy to do? I can't comment on the food as I've not really dined here though I have to say that the menu offers too many choices. I know some love that so there's something for everyone however I like simple and easy.  I'm a fan thanks to - what else? Their desserts! Last night I tried their white chocolate raspberry truffle and it was great. I'm also a fan of their tiramisu cake. I haven't tried their cheesecake version yet."
