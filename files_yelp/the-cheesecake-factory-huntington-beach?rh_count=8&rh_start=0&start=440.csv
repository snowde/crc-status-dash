Kevin B.,"Midway City, United States",357,309,688,5.0,11/9/2014,"I am a huge fan of this place been here a half dozen times or more. They have never disappointed me yet. They hit home runs in all areas the service is great no matter who your server may be today it was Gio, in the past Billy B. The food is always the best they do not skimp on quality or quantity. They make me fill like a happy and satisfied customer. Today I had the warm asparagus salad and the Steak Diane another favorite of mine is the chicken and biscuit"
Emma M.,"Long Beach, United States",57,222,21,1.0,3/4/2014,"Silly of me to write a review about a chain-restaurant... Came here last night for an early anniversary celebration with my boyfriend. First of all, the hosts/hostesses said it would be a 10 minute wait which turned into more than half an hour! I even heard another couple get annoyed at this. Our server (Martha) would literally SLAM every single plate on our table, practically spear-tossed a straw into my drink with her bare hands (ew), hardly checked on us and was just overall snotty and condescending. She high-key even had the audacity to check if we left a tip before she took our check away, as if she deserved it. Martha is the worst server ever! Food was quite disappointing. I got my favorite Chicken di Pana; broccoli was overcooked, the ""creamy sauce"" just tasted like heavy cream with no seasoning and some parts of my mashed potatoes were cold. My boyfriend got the Fried Chicken platter, he said it was okay and that the corn was good but it looked like a fancier version of what you can get at KFC. Lol. On the bright side, the calamari wasn't half bad. The fact that we had a snot-nosed brat stuck inside a 30-35 year old woman's body as a server kind of irked our experience. Ps. Our red velvet cheesecake tasted like the back of a refrigerator."
Vivian N.,"Westminster, United States",244,33,7,1.0,25/4/2016,"I took my siblings here for our weekly lunch date expecting to get good food and service but sadly I didn't get either of those. My siblings and I waiting literally 20 minutes (not over exaggerating) for someone to even come bring us bread and water. There were two men that passed us in black shirts, obviously not waiters, but they didn't even acknowledge the fact that no one had served us yet. The waiter came by our table and asked my siblings if anyone had taken our order yet. He took our order and a party that came after us at the same time. When he brought out the bread the white one was super stale! My teeth were literally aching so much after trying to eat it I had to take an Tylenol but that didn't even help much. Im here writing this review 4 hours later and it still hurts. And I only ate it cause I was so hungry waiting. The waiter didn't apologize or try to make up it he just said thanks for your patience. The other people's tables were checked up on and well taken care of maybe because they were all adults and my party just looked like a bunch of kids. The food was mediocre. I would never waste my time and money coming back here again. This experience ruined our weekly lunch date. Such a waste of $85 dollars. They're honestly lucky that I'm a server too so I still left a good tip and didn't complain because I know for a fact that if that happened at my restaurant we would be getting a lot of crap."
Dolores C.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,7,1,1.0,27/5/2015,"I have dined at CCF in Bella Terra numerous times but my last time eating there was awful. We had 8 people in our party on Monday, May 25,2015 at 6:00 p.m. Rebecca was our waitress. I think she did her best in a stressful situation. I ordered the tomato chicken with pasta off the Skinny Menu. One of our guest arrived about 6:30 . His food was served before the other seven people. The rest of the dishes were served about 20 minutes later.  I noticed immediately that my food was lukewarm. I ask the waitress to take it back and reheat it. The remaining seven dishes were not heated properly. I ate the chicken in the second dish that was served. The noodles were hard and the tomatoes looked like they had been heated repeatedly. A green sauce was at the bottom of the dish but I was so hungry by the time my second serving came that I did eat the chicken and I relayed this information to Rebecca. There were several other waiters that were helping Rebecca. I am so sorry that CCF service and food has reached a new low because I have enjoyed insurmountable meals there and I sincerely hope this was just a bad night for the waiters and cooks"
Kathy F.,"Montebello, United States",52,70,52,4.0,8/8/2015,"I love the pasta selection. I am very pleased with the amount of pasta they have and every dish is alway cooked to perfection. However, I drown it in cheese cause who can ever have enough cheese. I gave this establishment 4 stars because the wait time for a waiter to acknowledge you in the patio is a little slow. But who knows maybe it was an off day."

Heather G.,"Garden Grove, United States",190,30,1,4.0,12/11/2015,Love this place! We come for date night for a nice meal and tasty drinks. We never have enough room in our bellies for cake though! :( lol
Chris D.,"Cypress, United States",123,18,68,3.0,23/7/2015,Real quick! Not greatest visit today. Two steaks were ordered in my party and wanted them cooked medium but received it well done and one other order was put in wrong by the server. Well you can't always have perfect! O_o
Cindy L.,"Long Beach, United States",384,3,5,1.0,10/8/2015,I was tempted we waited for almost thirty minutes for six people. And the people just came with two or three get there table first. The bad part is The silverware and plate were dirty and I had to ask for hot water to clean up after their mess disgusting. I almost told my son and his friend let go but I don't want my son to get butthurt so we decided to stay for lunch. The food alright but expensive.
Nikki C.,"Westminster, United States",51,18,,3.0,28/10/2015,"I was excited for a cheat meal and I hated it! I ordered the Kobe burger and the meat was ok but the bbq grilled onions and mushrooms completely drowned the burger!! I was super disappointed! My love ordered the Cobb salad and another huge disappointment!  It was so bland, chicken looked like thinly sliced deli meat.  We were not satisfied.  My strawberry martini was to die for!! Loved it!  Service was good not spectacular.  Will we go here again? Most likely no.  Sorry Cheesecake Factory but didn't tickle my fancy!!"
Tiffany L.,"Westminster, United States",5,25,35,5.0,7/8/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here twice, once for Valentine's Day and a second time for my 21st birthday. For Valentine's Day, I think we waited about an hour and a half to be seated. They were really crowded that night, but that's understandable. The second time, which was on a Thursday night, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. When we got seated, we found that it was very dim inside, so it was hard to see. It also took a long time for the food to come out. They basically have everything on their menu. They have a great selection of food -- burgers, pasta, salad, etc. Before we ordered, we got different types of bread and butter. The whole wheat bread is SO good. Their bread is unlimited too so you can ask them for more! When it was time to order, my boyfriend and I went for their pasta. He ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and he loved it! I hate mushrooms but I also liked what I tasted of his pasta. It had a nice creamy flavor to it. His chicken was also tasty. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta and thought it was super delicious! It's now my favorite pasta -- it has the perfect hint of spice and the perfect crunch, since they top it off with bits of tortilla chips (I think).  Their cheesecake slice is really big... I totally underestimated it. We ordered the Oreo cheesecake to share but it got soo sweet that we couldn't finish it. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it next time."
Barbara A.,"Downey, United States",14,4,,2.0,30/8/2015,"Been here many times before and for the first time I am so disappointed :( worst service ever, our server came to our table 1 time never refilled our drinks, my chicken was rubbery $100+. Too much to pay for 20+ miles drive, bad food, and bad service. Gave 2 stars because Cheesecake Factory still is one of my favorite places to eat."
Tri L.,"Westminster, United States",0,15,6,4.0,25/9/2015,I had a bistro schrimp pasta dish and a strawberry lemonade. Always love the strawberry lemonade here. The pasta was great as well.
B G.,"Pico Rivera, United States",0,9,,4.0,18/10/2015,"Went on a buzy saturday night, they got us at our table in 15 minutes The service was good and food was right and tasty.will be back in  future"
Emily T.,"Cerritos, United States",27,53,14,3.0,5/7/2014,"It's a chain restaurant. I think you know what you're getting when you come here - food that's right down the middle and will somewhat please most people's palates.   Burgers, pastas, salads, steaks. Their gigantic menu has pretty much everything. I do like the Gumbo and Cajun Pasta. Its a commercialized version of what the real stuff  tastes like but hey, compared to the rest of the menu there's actually some spice and semblance of flavor that rises above the masses-will-eat kind of bland. Now the good stuff: wheat bread?  Whatever the darker bread they start you off with. It's bomb. Ask for more. The cheesecakes. Omg love. It's not frou frou fancy gourmet dessert but damn it's good. Rich and ridiculously fattening. Everything a guilty dessert is suppose to be. The Godiva is a must for chocolate lovers and the S'mores cheesecake is just as amazing as it sounds. The Red Velvet wasn't that great though. Not very red velvety or cheesecakey. Lame.  Service:  hit or miss depending on the server. I've had really good ones and not so great ones..."
Himeros A.,"Fountain Valley, United States",0,3,,5.0,12/6/2016,"After having to leave Stacked, which is across the street, because of having waited 20 minutes and still not being sat at a table we tried Cheesecake Factory. We were sat down right away. Long story short. GREAT service GREAT attitude, GREAT work ethic. They totally saved our family night that started off horrible because of the first ""restaurant"" we attempted going to. THANK YOU"
Robert P.,"Costa Mesa, United States",0,3,,2.0,12/6/2016,"I ordered  a ribeye steak and wanted to substitute the vegetables for Mac and cheese. I was informed that they would have to charge me 3 dollars more by the manager Elana so I asked if I could substitute the mashed potatoes for Mac and cheese. The manager said they are not allowed to substitute. I think that policy should be changed to satisfy the customer.  And after all that my ribeye steak came out well done, when I ordered it rare. I had to wait another 10 min. The manager was not concerned at all about my steak being made wrong. She did not return. This was very rude and bad management. I will not eat at this location anymore, I am very upset."
Karen L.,"Palm Desert, United States",11,107,14,5.0,16/8/2015,Excellent service by James.  (Got his name from the check). Kept our drinks full.  Food came out hot. Food runners were also very polite. We enjoyed our dinner very much.  Best part was when James gave our 5 year old the floor to order.  Gave him his full attention. First time he ate his dinner without bitching about SOMETHING because HE GOT TO ORDER IT.  He knew the waiter wanted to hear from him.  It was very nice.
Marlene H.,"Van Nuys, United States",4,21,3,4.0,2/5/2015,Beautiful decor.  Expansive menu.  Seems like it's always busy.  My bloody mary was ok.  Nothing to get excited about.  Nachos delicious.  Service pretty average during my visit.  We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and the server brought out a complimentary little sundae and a couple other staff members to sing to her.  I'll probably come back one day for lunch or something.
H. S.,"Los Angeles, United States",20,16,3,2.0,21/11/2013,"Gf and I love cheescake factory... not so sure about this location though... we came on a weekday around 1-2pm probably right after a lunch rush. We walked in and the host/hostess were standing around talking to each other and laughing... We asked if there was a wait, we were told yes around 10 mins.  As I was walking to our table, I noticed there were plenty of vacant tables. Ok... so we got to our table and it was set for 6 people, when there were other 2 seater tables. Whatever, the extra space was nice. But, our table and my utensils were dirty, there were crumbs of food and stains. I would normally go ballistic, but I didnt complain.. Our server forgot to give us or completely disregarded straws in our drinks and gave us a rude expression when we asked for it. Our food was standard cheesecake quality. Got a lunch special pasta and salad. We also went for a cheesecake. The cheesecake dessert was the only good thing from my experience here. Gf liked the cheesecake as well. We were full but not satisfied. I was disappointed with my visit here and my gf was as well."
