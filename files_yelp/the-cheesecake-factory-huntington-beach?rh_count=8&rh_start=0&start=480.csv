Christina L.,"Anaheim, United States",4,6,,1.0,27/12/2015,"I am so incredibly disappointed and disgusted to be quite Frank. My boyfriend and I just left this location at Bella terra food was great, we were paying and preparing to leave...AND THERE WAS A COCKROACH THAT SCURRIED ON THE HEAD REST OF OUR BOOTh. NOT TO MENTION WE WERE SEATED AT THE FIRST BOOTH THAT LEAD INTO THE KITCHEN!!! And the roach came directly from the kitchen! :-[.  I am so sad because I love cheese cake factory and their food is always so delicious! I felt it was important to report it to the manager, because that is a serious health issue. She told ME she would make an emergency call, but insisted that large cockroaches come from or side AND that the ones that you need to concern yourself with are the ones that are smaller. I told her, unfortunately this one was a smaller one and came directly out of the kitchen around the window that they have up on the booth. Our waiter even confirmed my fears and killed it for us!!! Good God I hope they get that addressed immediately, my stomach is turning just thinking about it! You spend way too much money at this place to get roach coach food..super sad! Super gross! The manager promised that they spray and get inspected often, but whatever the case...I will not be back anytime soon and don't know if I could get the courage to return even then. Serious disappointment. Yuck!!!"

Shay H.,"Costa Mesa, United States",3,23,201,1.0,24/5/2015,It's was the worse experience I ever he'd  the service was bed the waitress  didn't have time to take the order we order food and we never got it and the only thing we got from the manager that is  really sorry
Jenn P.,"Buena Park, United States",1,30,17,5.0,22/9/2013,"Came in for a special occasion - but didn't alert the staff. Got lucky enough to get ""Bree"" on the patio.  Wow. What an asset.  We had a great meal with excellent service and  my people are HIGH maintenance. Lots of subs and ""on the sides"" which I know drive servers crazy but Bree never blinked an eye and had everyone stepping to our service all night. 100% success. Which never happens with my crew. We talked about her great personality and what she brought to our $150 tab all night.  #wortheverypenny We will request her station next time were in- which will be soon based on food and service!"
Crystal T.,"Garden Grove, United States",30,68,16,5.0,13/9/2013,"One of my best guy friends took me here on my birthday, and I have to say it was really good! We loved the wheat bread they gave us, not so much the sourdough. I had the garlic noodles with shrimp, and I forgot what my friend ordered, but he enjoyed it too. We also had the tuxedo something or other cheesecake, which was PERFECT, because it wasn't too sweet which I loved. I forgot my waitresses name! But she was AMAZING. My friend had a hard time trying to order something, and she went down the ENTIRE page of pastas, really explaining in details. She also picked the cheesecake flavor for us since we couldn't decide. It is a bit pricey, but it is definitely worth it to shell out the few extra bucks for date night or something special."
Senia N.,"Long Beach, United States",46,388,40,5.0,12/3/2015,"The red velvet cheesecake is really good, and the food is really good!"
Mimi B.,"Orange County, United States",64,291,134,3.0,28/2/2014,Working lunch.  Thank heaven for lunch specials cause this place is pricy.   Chinese chicken salad is mostly  won tons and the chicken was really good in the salad.  Not much lettuce and way too much dressing.  Tasted the Baja chicken taco and that chicken was like shoe leather! Super large portion but pretty tasteless.  Always great service.  Everyone looks the same.  Have a skinny menu now. Portions large. Even the lunch special. But overall the food is not that healthy.
Neener M.,"Santa Clarita, United States",16,141,,1.0,8/3/2015,"Sadly had a bad visit to this location; sure te wait isn't long, but you will be waiting for your damn food. Not sure if I should blame the kitchen or the rude waitress, Veronica, but damn, really? 40 mins for a Cuban sandwich? Did they have to import it from Cuba??? The least she could've done was check on it and come back to let us know it was on its way but when you have a patron asking about it and you cop an attitude, well shit. Hubby had to move the car because he was over the 45 mins in their sorry ass parking space as well. Then she drops it off at the table then asks me if I want the rest of the food boxed up? So you wanna boot us out at the same time? No worries, he chowed down quick and we took off; enjoy your sorry ass tip and don't complain as you're lucky we even left you one! Bye Felicia!"
Cathy D.,"Huntington Beach, United States",10,84,320,4.0,3/7/2012,"I Love Cheescake Factory!! Huge Menu, but I have my favorites. The Chicken Marsala,  Chicken Madeira, Steak Diane. They have great  appetizers too. I luv the avocado eggrolls,  Hot Spinach Dip, and  Fried Macaroni  And Cheese.. They also have a Great Drinks!  My fav is Pear Martini and Georgia Peach! Always have Great service too!!"
Dave V.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,2,,2.0,21/6/2015,"Came here for Father's Day.  Had a bone in the chicken on the garlic noodles.  Wouldn't have been an issue except that it is the only pasta served with bone in chicken and it isn't mentioned in the novella of a menu.  Also, my son's fish and chips had hair in it.  And all the manager did was say ""oops"".  If not for our server, Sean, I would be rating this place a one star.  There are so many other choices in Bella Terra, choose a different one."
Mike M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",1821,1380,381,4.0,12/6/2011,"I took my wife here after a movie at Bella Terra.  She is very hot for Johnny Depp and I really dig Penelope Cruz, so Pirates 4 was on tap.  Not a great movie....it was a little tired. Dinner time!  As much as I hate chain restaurants, this place is always solid.  Great service, huge menu, tasty cocktails, big portions.  The Thai lettuce wraps were awesome. Always a solid choice to take my sweetie."
Andrea R.,"Westminster, United States",319,410,1034,3.0,16/9/2011,"Dear Cheesecake Factory, I don't know how to say this tactfully, so I'll just go ahead and be blunt: you've shrunk. Did you think I wouldn't notice? A few years ago, what used to be a 7 inch-long, 3 inch-wide at the base wonderslice that satisfied my craving like no other cheesecake, has now become...much less. So very much less, indeed.. About half the volume, I'd say.  Or maybe, you thought that pathetic dollop of whipped cream lying there like an after thought would fool me into believing that a five inch slice was filling up the takeout container? Baby, I remember a few years ago when you'd send me home with a whole separate bowl's worth of topping goodness. That's the kind of love it used to take to match a Cheesecake Factory slice. Alas, no longer... Scoundrel! Why do restaurants feel the need to cheat their faithful customers? Are there none left who won't stoop to ""downsizing"" their portions while keeping the same prices?  At least Fresh N Easy still appreciates me. There, I can get an 8 inch ROUND cheesecake for the same cost as one of your adulterated SLICES. And it's DELICIOUS! And just for the record: 5 inches is *below* average, no matter what corporate may have told you. Your deceiver's heart no longer deserves my love, Cheesecake Factory. And so I bid you adieu.. Sincerely, Andrea R."
Regina F.,"Long Beach, United States",4,96,100,3.0,3/3/2015,"This place is okay,  not the best, but it is a chain and chains have their pros and cons. I love the location centered in the middle of the bella terra shopping center with plenty of shopping all arojnd you and the cinemark theaters in the same plaza. This cheesecake factory, is clean, spacious, and had a good vibe to it. We went on a Friday night and only waited anout 15 minutes. We got a cute little table for two, the whole place has extremely dark lighting, we had to use our phones to view the menu. However, this made the ambient great for a romantic date. The menu had lots and lots of variety. I ordered the chipotle pasta, which i did not like, due to the sweet taste. I don't like my pastas to taste sweet, the waitress was nice enough to comp a new entree. The service was okay, our server was not very nice, but at least she accommodated my meal. This place is a tad pricey,nit not over the top. I had banana cream cheesecake which was delicious! I would return."
Lynn T.,"Fountain Valley, United States",549,245,740,2.0,1/12/2013,"I've never been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I was given a gift card for my birthday back in May so finally decided to use it yesterday (See how long it took me to use it? That's how much I don't really care for this place). When we arrived we were greeted right away and our names were taken down so we could be seated. We waited about 10 mins and was seated in the bar area that they now use for regular dining on the booths. When we sat down, were were told by our server that he would be right with us. We waited 5 mins for him to come back to finally ask what we would like to drink. He brought us back our waters and didn't come back again until we, took about 5 mins to decide what we wanted to eat and FINISHED our complimentary bread and waited some more to finally be able to wave him down to come take our orders.. (that was longer than it should have been) in case you weren't getting my drift.  We ended up ordering their Shrimp Bistro, Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and their Avocado eggrolls. The avocado eggrolls came out not too long after our order was placed... We finished the eggrolls and were ready for our entree.. we waited, waited and waited.. WAITED to the point that we started picking at the noodles that were used on the appetizer plate to place the eggrolls on. I NEARLY FINISHED the noodles! I was so hungry and waited so long for the food. We never waited that long for our food to come out before. I noticed other tables that ordered after us already got their salad and their food. The server finally came back and apologized for the wait and used the excuse that he wanted us to really enjoy our avocado eggrolls first.. UMMMM I NEARLY cleared the entire plate even the noodles cause you got me waiting so long here.. just bring me my food! Well.. to no surprise.. the food still was not ready and only came back later to tell me.. ""it'll just be a few more minutes"".... I do not want to hear that.. He finally decided to ask if we wanted our salad first so we decided to just have that.. We literally waited a good 20-30 mins before we got our food after waiting 10-15 mins to just get our order in. Not good! He finally brought us our pasta and we were finally happy.. The salad was not that great. It was HUGE! but the taste of it just wasn't good for me.. I had maybe two bites from it. The shrimp bistro was good though, I liked it a lot, but because of the long wait.. I just wasn't feeling it anymore. We ended up boxing up more then half of our salad and pasta after 15 mins of eating our food.  Service is a big deal to me, and I was not too happy with the service we received last night. I most likley will not be back unless I get another gift card or I have no choice. But I was never a fan of The Cheesecake Factory to begin with. After last night, it only made my decision on this place more valid."
Christina A.,"Westminster, United States",2,30,5,5.0,21/3/2015,"I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night around 6pm, the line was out the door but surprisingly it only took about 10/15 minutes to get seated. The hostess Allison was super sweet and welcoming first off. We were seated on the patio which had a perfect ambiance to it, very romantic. The buser Kevin was awesome and our waitress Michelle was just as great. The food was phenomenal!! Huge portions and super yummy. And the cheesecake was even better. Totally recommend the cookie-dough flavor. We haven't felt this great about a restaurant/service in awhile. Thank you Cheesecake Factory, well be back! :)"
Duke D.,"Kyle, United States",342,108,502,4.0,1/4/2013,"Went here on the Saturday night before Easter Sunday because we were in the area. As soon as we entered, we knew the wait for indoor seating was going to be a while considering the amount of people crowding up the waiting area. So we asked for outdoor seating. Wait was only 10 minutes which was pleasantly surprising. Our waitress was prompt and courteous. Danielle was her name. Anyway, we ordered from the small plates menu since it was late and we didn't want a full on dinner plate. Here's what we got: Santorini Farro Salad Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries Fried Zucchini Roasted Pear & Bleu Cheese Flatbread (Pecans, Arugula and Caramelized Onions) For me the flatbread was the night's winner. Just nice balances among the savory, chewy and sweet. I wanted to do a second order to take home but was too full to get anymore. A good one to try out if you're there! In hindsight, we shouldn't have order the fried zucchini AND the Portabella Mushroom, Avocado and Zucchini Fries because the ""zucchini fries"" in the trio were the same as the ""fried zucchini"" order. Batter was okay. Nothing outstanding unless you dip it heavily in the provided dips, which I do not know what they were since we were never told about them as the orders arrived.  Outdoor setting was good. They had those lamp post heaters on so we were all nice and warm. Our waters were refilled promptly. No complaints from me on anything."
Chelsea B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,1,,5.0,6/4/2016,"We came in tonight to eat dinner and our server and experience could not have been more wonderful. Phoenix was so attentive from start to finish and had such a great personality. Also the manager, Joe made a point to stop by when my food wasn't satisfactory. We come in enough to know that sometimes these things happen so we won't hesitate to come back because the food is always so good! Thank you Phoenix!!"
Ella M.,"Newport Beach, United States",4,58,,4.0,12/3/2014,"I love The Cheesecake Factory!  How can a restaurant have such a huge menu and everything on it is great?!  Having said that, I still hope who I'm eating with agrees to share the Cajun Chicken Littles with me because I can't eat it all by myself!  We always get them with garlic mashed potatoes and french fries.  YES, double the potatoes, please!  I have no shame.  I also get a side of their amazingly delicious ranch sauce.  Mmm... Of course there's no room for dessert after that, but it's worth it. Another dish I really enjoy here is the chicken salad sandwich with a soup or salad!  It's a must try if you like chicken salad sandwiches.  I'll typically order that if I'm not too hungry, but even then it's a lot of food.  Half a sandwich with soup or salad and I can barely finish it. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu.  If you haven't been here, don't wait any longer.  You won't regret it."
Joseph S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",18,22,9,5.0,4/4/2014,"Love this place!  I visited this location last week with a friend for dinner late on a Friday evening. The restaurant was busy since it was the weekend, but true to the cheesecake standard we were greeted politely and seated with a few short moments.  Our server was extremely friendly and even made a few jokes with us to really help liven up the experience. Once the food arrived I knew this Friday night was a win! Delicious!  Great food, great service, and a great experience. Thanks cheesecake"
Portia G.,"Anaheim, United States",0,69,47,4.0,7/3/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I hate waiting, but I'll wait the good hour you have to wait to usually get in here. The service at this one is usually great, it's clean, and of course the atmosphere is great! I do wish Cheesecake Factory wasn't so damn expensive though!! It's a chain restaurant with no real elegance. They have no business charging what they charge, but hey they're still busy all the time!"
