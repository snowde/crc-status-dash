Nina O.,"Poughkeepsie, United States",1,3,,1.0,12/4/2015,"Ordinarily I can forgive a lot of things in restaurant, however Cheesecake Factory needs to fix their take out system. I was told it would take 15-20 minutes so I allowed for that time before picking it up. When I showed up they said they would wrap up my order in the back and bring it out. Little did I know that I would have to wait 20 minutes for that to happen all the while the order was sitting on top of the cheesecake counter getting cold without any acknowledgement."
Melissa Q.,"Huntington Beach, United States",18,7,2,5.0,13/3/2015,"My family and I went to eat here tonight around 6pm. There was no wait to sit on the patio. Our server was Ashley P. and she was OUTSTANDING! Even though it was a busy Friday night, she was very friendly and got us our drinks promptly. For dinner, I got the eggplant Parmesan and it was so delicious! I highly recommend that dish, and this location is you're looking for a great time on a Friday night!"
Thuy L.,"Orange County, United States",1663,504,3908,5.0,28/12/2010,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Maybe because my Fiancee proposed to me here but that is another story. But it was still my favorite restaurant before he even proposed.  One of my weakness is Fresh Bread and butter. Every time I crave for bread and butter this is the place I think of.  The dark bread is always fresh and when it is not, I would just tell the waitress and they would always replace it with fresh bread. As always, the service here is always great. Favorite Appetizers: Fried Macaroni and Cheese -  TOTAL mac and cheese fan! What makes it even more amazing is that it's crispy on the outside! The mac and cheese in the inside is very creamy and delicious! Must order if you are a Mac and Cheese person! It is also a really good dish to share too! Fried Calamari - can never go wrong, I am just a fried calamari lover..Guilty addiction... My favorite main dish here is the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon. The steak is always delicious and I just LOVE salmon. The portions are pretty good to share also."
Sylvia K.,"Huntington Beach, United States",401,385,330,4.0,19/9/2011,"Beautiful restaurant located in the shopping center with a really nice outdoor patio. A friend and I came here for dinner and sat outside next to the water fountain.  Heaters were placed all over the patio so we never felt cold.  Great place for a date night!  The menu is very extensive with plenty of options to please any palette.. They even have a new ""skinny"" menu with a nice assortment of low calorie options of their original favorites. SCORE!! now there's more room for dessert! ;)"
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, United States",154,46,,4.0,12/8/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a fantastic chain which offers nearly unlimited options of food and drinks. Although the primary type of food is more American style they also have a variety of options from different spectrums.  Since the menu is over 20 pages long here are a few items which are great (from appetizers to desserts): Thai Lettuce Wraps, Factory Nachos, Factory Chopped Salad, Baja Chicken Tacos, Fish and Chips, Four Cheese Pasta, Steak Diane, Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. This location is good but can get busy since it's basically in the mall. At certain areas inside it does get a little noisy, and the outside seating can get fairly cold at night. Service here is only decent, not great, and when it's busy for dinner you may be at a hit-or-miss quality of service -- but the food will still be great!"
SoCalSparky o.,"San Diego, United States",34,374,130,4.0,10/1/2014,"We love this place because we have 2 kids, 2 1/2 and 10 months. They can be loud and no one cares because the restaurant was designed to funnel noise upward. Beyond that, we never have a bad meal here and always get bananas and bread for the kids to nibble. I will mention that they have gotten a bit chinsey on the banana and bread kids plate, but just ask for more. Service is hit and miss. But overall it's a good experience and quick."
Criselle M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",60,22,9,5.0,22/1/2016,"I have been to the Factory a few times, but my last visit there was quite lovely.  Right when I walked in for lunch the hostess was very kind and seated us quickly. Our group was about 12 people and we were only going to be there for a short time because we just had our lunch break to be there. We did tell our server this, I'm not sure if speed of service would have been different if they were not aware. We had water all around, some ordered soft drinks and the like. The bread came out quickly as so satiate some hunger pangs.  Our orders were taken quickly and were served quickly as well, I'd say our wait time was under 15 minutes.  I ordered the chicken parmesan. The breading on the chicken was light and crispy and sauce on the pasta was tangy and delicious. The noodles were al dente, which is  how I like it. The best part of the meal of course was the cheese cake. I ordered the S'mores cheesecake, and it was great. The marshmallow they use for it is made in house and they even char the marshmallow with a torch to give it that smokey s'more flavor and smell as you eat. The servers were very nice and our drinks were always full. I'd definitely recommend Cheesecake Factory at Bella Terra and I would go there again."
Drew N.,"Pomona, United States",29,11,3,5.0,28/3/2015,"Went in was seated in an appropriate amount of time. Had an amazing server Hallie N.  she took care of our orders. Was greeted with a smile made some few recommendations and enjoyed the amazing service. Then she recommended us to the cheesecakes she told us about the ""Adams Peanut butter cup fudge ripple"" such an amazing choice. I'd wouldn't mind going back soon. The food was amazing, desert was amazing, service A+, and the atmosphere was just perfect. For the amount of people there, the food came out fairly quickly so if like to thank the cooks as well."
Lillian L.,"New York, United States",575,347,193,4.0,6/7/2011,"So, you're with a friend in Bella Terra but you don't know what to do.It's too expensive to watch a movie. It's too late for dinner. But it's too early to go home. You're having a sweet tooth, but you don't want something too filling or overwhelmingly sweet. You don't have much in your wallet. What do you do? You go to Cheesecake Factory & split a Strawberry Shortcake! You ask the waitress/waiter for their basket of complementary bread while you wait. Once the Strawberry Shortcake arrives at your table, you and your friend will probably start spoon-fighting over the strawberry shortcake. You want a bit of the shortcake, the sliced strawberry, topped with some delicious vanilla ice cream. Forget the whipped cream. Things get messy. Your friend and you stop talking for a couple of moments because both of you are busy stuffing your faces. But it's good. Both of you feel guilty. But who gives a crap? It was good & well worth every penny & calorie. Perfect way to end a night, whether or not your day was miserable or enjoyable."
Christontotong A.,"Long Beach, United States",48,5,31,3.0,9/10/2014,I give it three stars because the server did not know what was in one of their dishes. She told me whatever it says on the menu. Ha whatever
Keri E.,"Huntington Beach, United States",133,36,64,5.0,9/12/2013,"If I was rich I would eat here every day! I've eaten here at least 10 times in the past few months. Every dish and dessert I've eaten here has been out of this world!!! They definitely care about quality, which is a rare trait for a chain restaurant to posses. LOVE!"
Dennis G.,"Garden Grove, United States",7,14,,4.0,11/9/2014,"My girlfriend and I share birthdays within a few days of each other. We decided to try Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night even though it appeared we would have a long wait for a table. Not the case, We were very surprised to hear the call within just a few minutes.  We shared a huge salad that was really great, then I had a Mushroom/Swiss Cheese Burger and my lady had a pasta/chicken dinner- both were really excellent. We had told our server that we were celebrating our birthdays and she took good care of us.(sort of) At the end of our meal, our server asked us if we had room for a desert- we both sort of wondered if she had forgotten that we were doing the birthday thing- anyway, since we were in a desert style restaurant, we ordered the Blackout Cake to share- @ $7.95. It was really huge and very decadent-then moments after we got yhe cake-she brought is two little birthday sundaes with candles. So, what's the deal? Did she or the Cheesecake Factory take advantade of us? Her holding off on recognizing the occasion made uis awkwordly decide to add an additional $8 to our bill. I say ""Bad Form"" and sort of trcky.  I guess I learned to be careful if we ever come back. Bottom line, the food was really good. Next time I'll be more careful"
Joe I.,"Lake Forest, United States",476,374,139,5.0,18/7/2013,"Luah Salad with my Bible Study.  Tasty, healthy, and filling.  Jessica was our server and she did a wonderful job.  The kitchen staff messed up one of the plates in our order but the manager came by to personally apologize and rectify the order to my friend's satisfaction.  The Cheesecake Factory fuses great service with delicious food and I think that is one of the reasons our Bible Study comes here afterwards to share a meal and socialize."
Nicole B.,"Long Beach, United States",344,64,415,5.0,2/9/2013,"I am solely basing my review on one particular dish...I don't care about the service and the ambiance and how long the wait was. All I care about is the Mac N' Cheese Burger.. A burger consisting of fried cheese balls, cheddar cheese sauce, and medium rare beef patty all sandwiched between two fluffy slices of bread. I always ask for a side of bbq sauce, garlic aioli, and ranch with the burger. Now it usually comes with extra items like tomatoes and onions etc. but I am a purist and ask for none of that nonsense! Once you place your hand on the bun and press down, the fried cheese balls burst and even start gushing over the side of your burger. It is extremely beautiful! Since I am on a diet I try to go for a ""lighter"" side by adding sweet potato fries instead of the regular kind. On my cheat days for the past couple of months I have been trying to stay away from Cheesecake (Due to its insane amount of calories) and trying different places instead, but honestly everything is gross in comparison to the Cheesecake version. I will always come back for you my love!"
Sidney S.,"Irvine, United States",1608,824,980,4.0,7/10/2010,"Yes, yes, I know...it is a flipping chain and with a plethora of 2000 calorie-laden meals, it is the Hummer of the restaurant industry as a grotesque example of American excess.  I get that and I do not visit often. However, as stated in a previous review, every year American Express basically hands me cash or gift cards to use their card for free for a year.  One of the gift cards I got was from Cheesecake Factory.  I took some of our staff out for lunch. And guess what, we all ordered healthy meals.  I had a very tasty Jamaican Black Pepper shrimp, one co-worker ordered Miso Salmon, anoother ordered the New Orleans shrimp and the fourth ordered a chicken dish I have since forgot.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, service was efficient, drinks were refilled...and I paid for four people $24.00 tax and tip.  Not a bad deal. Your mileage may vary on a Friday or Saturday night, but, for a Thursday lunch...very good, parking plentiful (until Whole Foods opens) and overall a pleasant experience especially sitting outside."
Jill T.,"Huntington Beach, United States",35,90,139,4.0,10/10/2013,"always a great place for a Cosmo, and a Caesar Salad!  Parking can be  a pain at this location, but they do valet, and there is a huge parking structure close by. Service was a little slow though, and the place was not very busy."
Elizabeth D.,"Reno, United States",26,203,89,3.0,10/7/2011,"The best thing about Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake (big surprise)! Seriously, though, I love cheesecake, and my favorite of all time is their very simple original cheesecake with fresh strawberries. Unfortunately, the food is just okay. It's edible, but it won't tantalize your taste buds. Their fresh bread basket is still good, though. Maybe the problem is that their menu is too big? Anyway, stop by on July 30th for half-off a slice of cheesecake."
Teague T.,"Midway City, United States",6,7,4,4.0,17/7/2015,"Overall, this restaurant was great. The servers are nice and the seating was really spacious. What surprised me was the complementary bread. The whole wheat bread had a nice, sweet taste to it. I got the mac & cheese hamburger and it was tasted juicy and nice. I gave a 4/5 stars because the Evlyn's Favorite Pasta was slightly undercooked and the pasta was tough. I forgot to mention that their cheesecake is soft and sweet (but not too sweet)."
Jackie C.,"Westminster, United States",24,39,20,5.0,18/11/2014,"Very satisfied every time I come here, they bring the food very lovely and waitress are very helpful"
Mary F.,"Garden Grove, United States",1,164,19,4.0,26/1/2015,"Food here is really good! Pastas are so hearty, and the small size is a perfect portion, the full would be too much food. Smoothies are made with real fruit and the sangria is good. Service is relatively fast, the place gets really busy so expect a wait and expect the waiter to forget some stuff. But otherwise this place is good."
