Johnny C.,"Cerritos, United States",327,805,133,3.0,3/12/2010,"Its been years since i've been to cheesecake factory. Went last night (thursday) and our party was seated already, but there was a waiting list for the other people. The place is pretty dimly lit which makes it difficult sometimes figuring out what you're eating, unless they're trying to hide something ... like the pool of oil at the bottom of the plate or the measly pieces of chicken on your pasta. Got a 22oucne stella so i was pretty much fine with everything otherwise. So many cheesecake choices that it makes me not want to get any."
Adriene W.,"San Pedro, United States",0,5,,1.0,24/1/2016,This is the worse location. I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've experienced excellent customer service but not at the HB location. The Waitress and the female manager was rude. We waited 25 minutes for cold hard bread after I asked her to bring fresh hot bread. She bought us cold spinach dip. Then the manager came to the table and asked us did we want her to microwave the dip. The manager asked us have we tried The Yard House Spinach Dip before. I was amazed!!! The final upsetting comment was when I showed the manager the old piled lettuce in the Chinese Chicken Salad. She agreed that it looked old.  At that point I was done.
Benjamin B.,"Long Beach, United States",0,2,,5.0,14/6/2014,"I'm writing this review for 6/12/14 Thursday night. First off, I gotta say if you don't valet your car then you're missing out, but that isn't a part of The Cheesecake Factory. So my girlfriend and I got there and immediately I checked in and the host told me 10-15 minutes for a party of two. As soon as I got the pager, I turned around to wait outside, but I only made it to the door and the pager went off. I saw they printed out my name with a table number on it and I was like wow that was fast. I overheard a party of 5 would take 30-45 minutes to be seated. These hosts were awesome and I think that hosts are under appreciated in the restaurant business. So we sit down at our 2 top table and it's a little small and usually I would have asked for a booth, but on a busy night, I was lucky to get a table as fact as I did, so I wasn't about to ask to move. Our server was Kenny and he was great. I ordered 2 waters and an ultimate margarita for my girlfriend and I. Kenny brought them along with the bread. I took a drink of my Ultimate Margarita and it was too sweet, so I stirred it a bit, but it was still too sweet (wasn't his fault maybe the bartender messed up or CF's recipe uses alot of sweet and sour). So when Kenny came around I told him that my margarita had too much sweet and sour and that I wanted to get a mojito instead and it was delicious. Then we ordered our appetizers, spinach dip and potstickers, and our meal at the same time, Meatloaf and Chicken Madeira, the only problem with the appetizers was that the spinach dip was too cold, so I asked Kenny to heat it up abit and he did, easy fix. The manager came around as our food came out to apologize about the wait. My girlfriend and I didn't even notice the wait. I saved room for dessert and Kenny packed up all our leftovers for us and even gave us great recommendations for dessert. We were full so we decided to order our dessert to-go and eat it when we got home. We got the Kahlua cheesecake and the reese cup cheesecake for our roommates. Kenny brought our check and we had about $88 and 20% is about $17-$18, but we didn't want to break any bills, so we left him $110. That's $22 tip.  To you cheapsakes out there! That's how you tip properly, so take a lesson. Our service was sublime nothing to really complain about, so to those people that find a problem every time. Get over yourself. Maybe the reason you have bad costumer service everywhere you go is because you're a bad customer. Lastly, to Nancy L. who said that the hostess greeted her without a smile. Get over yourself. not everything revolves around you. Let's change the way we treat the service industry. Lastly, I'd like to thank Kenny for providing us with great service."
Brit S.,"Westminster, United States",110,39,3,5.0,3/6/2012,I just absolutely love this place. I think it's easily my favorite restaurant. I came here for lunch with my husband and was seated immediately. Our waitress was nice and quickly took our orders. Their strawberry lemonade is always delicious and I love the sugar they put around the rim and the glasses are so big! For an appetizer I ordered the vietnamese tacos which are to die for!!!! And the hubby got some sort of corn cakes or something that were also really good. For lunch I ordered the same thing I get every time I come here! The Luau Salad!!! This is by far my favorite salad of all time and definitely worth the ten bucks!!! We didn't get any cheesecake because I was already so full I almost felt a little nauseous! Can't wait to come back!!!
Bud G.,"Long Beach, United States",0,102,,2.0,12/10/2014,"For me: 2 STARS For my eating companions (in their opinion, of course): 3-4 STARS Let me preface this specific review that I've NEVER had a Cheesecake Factory experience that made me want to go back. To me it's the ultimate in big, mediocre corporate food and my meals have always disappointed me in one way or another.  It may be my curse, because  it seems that other people I'm with (usually) have better experiences (and I understand why), but I seem to always come out going ""meh."" Maybe I just keep ordering the wrong thing, even though it's a different wrong thing each time. So, why do I keep going back?  Honestly, the only reason I show up to CF is because I have to: I'm with a group of friends and/or relatives and/or business acquaintances who want to eat there and I'm not in a position to argue the point. When it's someone's birthday and that's where they want to eat, you go with the flow, no matter how painful.  I'm giving it 2 STARS on today's visit for these reasons: The waiter, while friendly, was sparse in his attention. We had to flag down other waiters to get stuff or wait for a while to see him to flag him down.  The bread was OK, though I'm not a fan of the dark/squaw (or whatever it is) bread, and the sourdough was a bit on the tough side.  My dish was the White chicken chili.  Almost 14 bucks. The menu actually starts out with the description of this dish saying ""A generous bowl of..."" The waiter asks me if I want white rice or brown with that. I say brown, but it matters not, because the rice ended up being what amounted to a tablespoon in about a cup's worth of chili that barely took up the bottom third of this huge bowl that it was brought in. So, yeah, as the menu said, the bowl was indeed generous. However, the contents were not. Really, 14 bucks for this? The rest of my party either laughed or felt sorry for me when they saw that my dish was actually much smaller than the kid's meal that one of the kids in our party had. My partner actually called the waiter over and asked him if this was a mistake. He said no, that's the serving size and walked away.  OK, well, I'll just eat bread to fill up, I guess... As far as the chili itself, it was very, well, OK. Mediocre. Kind of watery, about a tablespoon of rice, a few pieces of chicken, a few beans and nothing about the flavor to distinguish it from, say, a mediocre chicken tortilla soup from a diner.  Anyway, the cheesecakes were OK, but cheesecake doesn't blow me away, so once again, another weak experience.  However, I know, deep in my heart, that one day I'm going to have to come back here again, like it or not."
UsTheKidAndTheDog F.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,37,,1.0,29/12/2015,"Our experience tonight was terrible. What's funny is a woman left a comment yesterday about her food being cold. Clearly, no effort was made to correct the issue.  We dined here tonight and my potatoes tasted like they came out of the cooler. Additionally, we ordered the calamari appetizer which was undercooked. My husbands draft beer came to the table after the undercooked calamari. The manager did bring out a new calamari, but not until we were almost finished with our main course. During college, I worked in a very busy restaurant. I understand places get busy and staff become overwhelmed. The quality of the food should never be compromised.  I would avoid this location. There are too many  dining options in the center, which will not disappoint you. (Eureka, Solita, King's Fish)"
Miss H.,"Long Beach, United States",23,48,3,4.0,26/8/2014,"This location of CF has great service. Top it off with an appetizing menu, voila! You got your money's worth. It gets busy here at Bella Terra so reservations for a party of 5 or more is highly recommended on the weekends. Party of 2, prepare to wait to get seated, weekdays: no wait. Weekends, 25-40 min depending on how busy they are. But hey! They're in an outside mall location. My son loves their cheesecake and will always want to come here every chance he gets. Bon appétit I!!!"
Bethany K.,"Orange County, United States",102,597,106,4.0,18/2/2013,"Cheesecake Factory locations are so very consistent. Same massive menus with equally massive portion sizes, same good-but-not-great service, almost always busy, etc etc. I like this CF location because it's right off the 405 and there's a decent amount of parking in the plaza, despite the many other restaurants and stores nearby. Came with the in-laws on this particular visit for my husband's bday and we had... *Lots of brown (wheat) bread - thanks to the waitress for actually bringing us only brown bread as requested (seriously, brown bread is way better than the white bread) *Avocado eggrolls - I'm hooked *Kale salad (from the ""small bites"" menu) - decent. Forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, and it felt like the pieces of kale hadn't been cut up as usual *Fresh artichoke - my sister-in-law ordered it and I had actually never had artichoke like this... surprisingly tasty, though a little more hands-on than I like my food *Chicken bellagio - my husband's favorite  *Filet mignon - FIL thought it was really good *Veggie burger - sis-in-law is also a vegetarian (pesc?) and didn't like this *Strawberry shortcake - ate too much of the biscuit and ice cream... but it's seriously my favorite dessert. Desserts are the #1 reason why I fail (repeatedly) as a vegan *Tiramisu cheesecake - my husband loves tiramisu... and cheesecake. So this is pretty much as good as it gets for him! I wouldn't ASK to go to Cheesecake Factory ever... but you know, when someone else chooses it, I can always find something I like."
Poupee C.,"Cypress, United States",483,315,1336,5.0,25/4/2012,"Review will be short and sweet... You must try the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.   A flourless Chocolate Cake topped with a layer of Chocolate Cheesecake loaded with chocolate chunks...and topped with a layer of Chocolate Mousse. All made with Godiva chocolate. One slice lasted me 4 days..and I shared.  Seven bucks went a long way, that's for sure!! Yum!!!!"
Helena S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",2,100,28,5.0,22/1/2015,"The food is really good! This is s great place to go if you are Gluten Free, because they have good options. I love the tamale cakes (I think that's what they are called) , and they have really good burgers and fries. I would recommend this place."
Homer L.,"Newport Beach, United States",0,15,,1.0,24/5/2014,The service is about as good as the frost bitten food.  To me the food is frozen garbage i could defrost at home for 5 bucks? The food we ordered from the bar was flavorless and soggy.  the staff could care less about us and the management sucks too. How does this place stay in business.  I will be telling all my friends never to eat there.  I suggest you do the same and save your money.
Lin D.,"Westminster, United States",43,33,1,4.0,23/3/2015,"Have a big occasion to celebrate? Eating carefully for your health or on a diet? Want to impress someone special? You can do all of the above at Cheesecake Factory. Portions on the regular menu are ample, particularly the yummy salads. I always have at least a third of my meal to take in a doggie bag. The tastes border on gourmet; every dish, of the 15 or so I've had, is elegantly presented and gives your taste buds an adventure. Watching your calories? There's a special menu with exact counts, some under about 500 calories, some under 600-650; all of these, 20 or more choices, have the same chef's flavors with lighter ingredients and smaller portions. The only drawback is really a testimonial to the restaurant's great quality: you may have to wait 1/2 hour or more to be seated at mealtimes, particularly weekends. Just call ahead. It can also be a little noisy, so tell the server if you need privacy. 116 check ins here and this is what come up with as a review of the day. LOL."
Briana A.,"Cerritos, United States",67,14,39,2.0,30/4/2014,"So out of all the cheesecake factories I have been to this one has definitely surprised me. I have had terrible experiences at most cheesecake factories and this one was kind of the same. Our waiter was nice but towards the end had an attitude because my friend asked for a spaghetti WITH meat sauce. She had to order two extra dishes of meat sauce because there was not enough. Also, my chicken fettechini noodles were under cooked the first time. The manager came by and asked if I wanted a soup or salad. Besides that I got a new one and still the same problem. To get more bread, I had to ask another waiter,(who we later find out is a bus boy) all is fine but I will not be coming back to this one again. I would rather get terrible service at mcdonalds. Thanks."
J V.,"Costa Mesa, United States",263,49,303,1.0,1/12/2012,"worst dining experience, the service was horrible, the waiter/waitress did not want to serve complimentary bread... I asked for the wheat buns instead of the standard  buns, the server told me that they are waiting for the bread to be baked, it could be hours before it would be ready. As soon as she walked away, another waiter brought out the same bread i requested to a customer sitting next to me.. the food was crap, i didnt even finish the jambalaya.."
Barbra D.,"Santa Ana, United States",89,19,2,1.0,29/3/2014,I'm allergic to shrimp and they do not have separate fryers to avoid cross contamination. This is a huge disappointment from such a huge establishment. Even Claimjumpers got their act together and have separate fryers now. I'm so disappointed because I can't have any of my favorite things here. Please get separate fryers for the people who are allergies to seafood!
Ravi J.,"Huntington Beach, United States",27,22,7,5.0,19/1/2016,"I eat here like once a week. Excellent service, great food, Love the santa fe chicken salad, less than 600 calories and so good. Great location."
Steve H.,"Garden Grove, United States",90,4,,1.0,7/12/2014,Servers are slow and makes too many mistakes.  They should  hire older and more professional people.  Not please with service.
Kat T.,"Canoga Park, United States",7,64,49,3.0,19/4/2015,"Chalk it up to late dining (11:00pm), but the quality of the food wasn't great. Server wasn't as attentive and efficient. We waited for everything! I can understand if it were busy, but she only had a few tables to attend to, and the place was a bit empty, too! Not looking forward to coming here again."
Amanda N.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,1,,5.0,3/1/2016,I love coming to the Cheesecake Factory and frequent this location quite often. I came here last night with some friends and ordered my usual garlic noodles (which are to die for!) and when the food was brought they came with tomatoes which I specially did not ask for. Our waitress was super nice and apologetic and sent it back for a new plate. When the second plate arrived it came with mushrooms and 3 kinds of noodles. A different waitress came over (tall with short blond hair) and was super sweet and insisted that I send it back for the correct food order. At this point all my friends were done eating but then the manager Chris came over who was very apologetic and helpful and insisted my meal was free. I just want to give credit to Chris for being so kind and having amazing customer service in making sure we were all satisfied. I will continue to keep coming back here thank you!
Pam S.,"Upland, United States",589,656,482,2.0,6/7/2010,"First of all Thomas Jefferson and I came in yesterday with the sole intention of getting a cocktail and a ""Quick bite"" to eat... FOCUS being on the cocktail and not neccesarily the grub. Parking is ALWAYS a challenge over in this mall area... it's like people have no clue as to how to drive or respect for those trying to get in and out of a spot! =/ So the hostess seats us quickly after trying to sit us on a 4 top table Nuh uh we would prefer a booth she took care of this no problem at all :) then Selina comes over and greets us takes our order recommend what would be fast coming out of the kitchen and ""Voila we are on our way.  Thomas Jefferson got a Margarita with a Chambord float I tried the Peach Bellini... I didn't like my Peach Bellini so we traded. We started with the Avocado Rolls and true to her words they came out fast and HOT delicious tamarind dipping sauce. Next up were my old time favorite Thai Lettuce Wraps YUUUUUUMMMMM-MMMEEEEE all those dipping sauces make my dayum toes curl!  Here is where the service falls down =[  Ms. Selina did not pack NOT ONE dayum sauce in our ""to-go"" container... so we get home ready to enjoy our leftovers from Cheesecake Factory and encounter all of the fixings for the wrap minus the delicious sauces that make them the BOMB in the first place!  FYI No sauce for the Avocado Rolls either tsk tsk  By the way that Margarita drink was 2 times the cost of a normal beverage so refreshing and delicious it may be but CHEAP it is not  =/ Respectfully Reviewed"
