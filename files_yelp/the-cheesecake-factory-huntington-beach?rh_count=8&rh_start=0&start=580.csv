Michelle R.,"Downey, United States",30,5,,1.0,7/10/2014,To slow no one wok it took us an hour to get or food forks were disgusting my salad dressing had green stuff in it I rather go to the one in LA At the Grove
Alex G.,"Huntington Beach, United States",2,2,6,1.0,29/3/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory does not have the facilities to fry seafood separately. Instead, they fry it along with everything else causing potential cross contamination. I see many lawsuits in the future."
Michael K.,"Portland, United States",11,105,10,5.0,7/8/2014,"Hey, love the Bellaterra Location of this cheesecake factory, The service is not the best, but the food is always great, me and my lady were still treated like we were royals. Keep up the good job guys with my jambalaya and her fish tacos and were always in business, Just warning folks, come before the weekend, or there will be a long wait"
Emily T.,"Buena Park, United States",5,3,3,2.0,23/9/2014,"I had an uncomfortable time yesterday. It was the first time i came there and it will be the last time also. I never came there again. The place is neat and nice. The food is ok but too expensive. The service was really bad. The waiter took care of 3 table at that time. He gave us only few second to order, after that pass to another one really fast. When he took order, he bent one knee on my chair and kind of very close to me. Sometimes i saw him watching us from corner , like want us finish early to get out. I paid $62 for the meal of two with the uncomfortable time."
Jeffrey L.,"Huntington Beach, United States",5,60,24,4.0,28/5/2013,"HUGE menu. Great service. Drinks are strong enough. Open late.  I can't say I've had a bad experience ever. The folks will seat you at 10:45 pm and not complain in the slightest...not that I try to do that, but it's happen when I thought they were open until midnight every night.  They did have a bad gas leak on the patio, but I'm sure that's fixed now."
Tara R.,"Orange County, United States",4,22,8,1.0,10/10/2015,"Worst service ever! Super loud, tons of kids, has the vibe of a Chucky Cheese.  20 minutes to get our drinks (waters) another 15 for bread and our order taken.  I'm disappointed every time I go here on one level or another.  Will not be returning.  It's for trendy people who want to eat at Bella Terra.  Overall whack! Not worth the lines out the door waiting to get in, a true example of how a trendy spot keeps the drones coming."
Johnny N.,"Anaheim, United States",35,93,54,1.0,14/4/2012,"Called in to order, and was placed on hold for 10 minutes. I just wanted to place an order for pick-up. Instead, I went to pick up somewhere else who answered the phone in seconds, and actually wanted my business. Don't come here, don't call here. They don't deserve your business."
Jill P.,"El Segundo, United States",27,123,523,5.0,18/7/2014,"Consistently delicious! Love the Chicken Marsala and the Salmon. And, the cheesecake is delicious! Thank you! My BFF and I frequent this place for special events!"
Kevin M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",2,19,19,1.0,26/4/2015,"Been coming here for a while and while i understand servers are under stress... i do not need a smug attitude if i ask a question about the menu item nor do i need my drink napkin fribee'd on to my table as the server walks up to my table. I have no idea who hired the server but im leaving and will not lay a dime on the bill nor touch the food.  i requested to talk to a manager and the server took 5 min amonst helping another table first before even addressing the issue...the manager even went so far as to say ""its a sunday so our server is busy but ill get your food corrected and out"". LASTLY.... dont make excuses for a employee...that is what did it...."
Karen C.,"Costa Mesa, United States",0,10,,3.0,24/11/2015,"We tried the Cheesecake Factory a couple of years ago and didn't go back because service was poor. I remember being disappointed because I liked their menu. We decided to give them another try last week. Our waitress was swift, polite, and anticipated our needs. So we went back this week and it went south this time. Had to go to hostess up front because it was a long time and no one had come around. When waitress finallycame to take our order, It took longer than it should for us to get our drinks. The waitress didn't check back after we ordered and waited for our meals, so I ran out of soda and had to wave her down. And it took a LONG time - don't blame server, must have been a kitchen problem. As we finally began our meal, noticed waitress had several tables and was chatty with a couple of them, but pretty much left us alone. But also noted waiters/waitress very chatty with each other, overheard one say ""he ask me what I had been doing . . ."" Can't say servers were lazy or not doing their jobs, just that they didn't seem to give a (darn). There are so many places, with good food, better service. For the price, we should have a better experience. We weren't happy."
Jesi D.,"Garden Grove, United States",241,70,,5.0,18/2/2012,"Valentine's Day Part 2 took place at Cheesecake Factory even after the fact that I had NOT want to go here after reading so many negative reviews about how slow they are and how not great the food was. Lucky for me, I don't always follow the advice of follow yelpers because my experience at Cheesecake factory (hadn't been in a few years) was actually quite splendid.  It was his turn to get spoiled this time and he really wanted to come here for V-day, and I didn't want to, so I definitely made it up to him even though V-day should be all about me me me!  We ordered a virgin Pina Colada and Mojito to drink and they were the best ever. I think we found ""the one"" for mojitos or at least in my opinion and I can never go wrong with a Pina Colada.  He ordered alfredo angel hair pasta and I had their chicken enchilada. My entree was great and he seemed to love his as well. Food was good, but didn't ""wow"" me that much, but I really liked it still.  We took our which chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake to go and ate it at home while watching ""How I Met Your Mother"" and it was so good I couldn't even focus on the show. More orders of cheesecake from here? I think yes. Our server, Brandon, was super sweet and awesome. Very attentive and did everything just right. Hope I get more experiences like this at Cheesecake Factory in the future."
Mandy M.,"Orange County, United States",70,51,34,3.0,31/5/2014,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by here after not having too huge of a clue of where we wanted to go for dinner - I wanted steak and my boyfriend wanted something not steak.  Figured we'd pop by here. It was busy and we were told we'd have a 15 minute wait, but our buzzer buzzed immediately! Oh goody! Food! Nope. We handed the greeter our buzzer, and then... we were put in a line. There was only two groups ahead of us, but talk about playing with your head here! I guess their wait time average was accurate. -_- But I believe you should only be buzzed when it is your turn. Anyway, we sat down and we were greeted by our waiter, Philip (Or Phillip?), and after some glances at the menu we had decided what we wanted. He took our drink order, my BF had the tea in passion-fruit, and I had a frozen strawberry margarita. Having been to many bars, I am a bit picky. Margarita was not very sweet even when I asked for sugar on the rim. I'd give the margarita alone a 7/10. We had ordered beef kabobs for appetizers, and then I decided on the filet mignon, and BF had ordered fish and chips. So the atmosphere is nice outside, cute patio, you know. We wait about twenty-five minutes and our dinner is served. Filet was yummy, and BF enjoyed his fish and chips. About halfway into our meal.... Our beef kabobs come. Talk about awkward.. Anyway.. We just decided to box the entire thing up. Dinner portion was great. We also took a strawberry shortcake home in a to go box, which was great later at home. Philip did a great job making sure everything was being taken care of, but otherwise this place is decent for being a chain restaurant."
Jenny C.,"Santa Ana, United States",158,134,431,4.0,8/2/2011,Going to a place like this... you gotta save some room for desserts!!!!  My favorite thing to eat here is their Shepherd's pie! My new favorite now is their Garlic Noodle! So amazing! If you can... try to come during the weekend... it seems like they make their food a little bit tastier  on the weekend... maybe its just me then...
Sam S.,"Fountain Valley, United States",40,13,,4.0,16/8/2014,"Kobe burger here is delicious! Always finish that off with a slice of red velvet cheesecake! It's not a ""real"" kobe burger but it is my favorite thing on the menu there!"
Westley Y.,"Fountain Valley, United States",86,436,1415,2.0,6/5/2014,"This Restaurant is located on the backside of the Bella Terra Shopping Center. The Cheesecake Factory is best known across the globe for its extensive and creative menu, generous portions, distinctive decor and legendary desserts. With more than 250 menu selections - all handmade, in-house with fresh ingredients - and more than 50 signature cheesecakes and desserts, there is truly ""Something for everyone"" at The Cheesecake Factory. It was my Mom's Birthday and she got a gift card from one of her co-workers so we all when out on a Tuesday night for Birthday dinner. When we arrived we were greeted right away which was nice. I gave them our name and within a few minutes they took us to our table. We sat in the giant booth that fits 7 people in the center of the room. Everything was looking good so far. Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and tired she was saying weird thing but we took it with a grain of salt. We told her were just sat down and needed a few minutes to look over what we wanted to order. Well we shouldn't have said that because literally she never came back. Ha ha we waiting for like 20 minutes an then I said enough of this so I waved down another server to get us started with Drinks. I know just drink right. Horrible!  Then when it came time to order our food our same original server came back and she was a wreck, she looked horrible. Her hair was a mess and all sweaty and it seem like she was inconvenienced to take our order.  I was thinking at that time if I were her boss I would have had a talk with her saying either get it together or go home. We ordered our food and each plate had different things that were requested and of course when we got our meal it was missing sides and not cooked the way we wanted it so on and so forth. The recap was their service level was a 1 out of 10 and they food was okay but not what we expected. I mean it was a Tuesday night and it was a slow, so there shouldn't be any excuses as to why everything sucked. My Mom used to love this place now after this bad experience she probably will never go back again.  That server f-ed it up for us."
Will D.,"Santa Ana, United States",20,24,,4.0,1/8/2012,Our server was wonderful and patient as it was my first time at the CCF. Seating was quick. Ordered the Jambalaya and Spicy Chicken Chipotle dish. Was not disappointed. Topped it off with their new Oreo Cheesecake which was hands-down the best cheesecake I ever had. Overall a great dining experience. Definitely coming back for that Cheesecake.
Ann D.,"Santa Ana, United States",135,1,,1.0,23/12/2011,"This is just a review based on their customer service, particularly phone service. As the holidays are approaching, I wanted to see the holiday hours for this Cheesecake Factory since it's near where I live and I was craving some cheesecake. Today was Thursday and they closed at 11pm. I figured when I called (it was 12:45am), it would just send me to the automated voicemail and I would hear the holiday hours. To my surprise, a girl picked up. Employee: Cheesecake Factory Me: Hi. I was wondering what your holiday hours were for this weekend? Employee: ...Are you serious? Me: Yes. Employee: Well we're open til 12:30 on Friday and Saturday and closed on Christmas Day. Me: Okay, thanks so much. Employee: Yeah. Really? I'm sorry if you had to stay back late. I'm glad that you picked up the phone, but honestly, if you're gonna be that rude, I'd rather you not pick up the phone at all and just let the message play. Thanks to you, I'm not coming by for cheesecake anytime soon."
Nikki M.,"El Segundo, United States",468,345,117,4.0,19/11/2011,"We've all bene to Cheesecake Factory. But what makes this one different? It has a happy hour, that's what! Only a few locations in the US actually have a HH, so this makes bump up the rating from what would usually be a three star review for any other Cheesecake Factory location. So please, bare in mind... *This review is for the happy hour only"" Don't even get me started on corporate restaurants, Cheesecake's ANNOYING long menu, or their overly sweet cheesecakes. I'll review the happier, more alcoholic side to Cheesecake. My friend and I were trying to figure out a spot for happy hour, and Bella Terra happened to be located conveniently for both of us. She suggested Cheesecake Factory. ""Say whatttt? They have a happy hour,"" I responded. ""Yep!"" And we were on our way. I've been back once since my first time. They have a nice selection of cocktails on happy hour (including my favorite cosmo) as well as deals on beer and a few varietals of wine (chard, cab, merlot, sauv blanc, and pinot...if I remember correctly). They also have a GREAT selection of food on happy hour, including appetizers and small plates that range from $5-8ish. The first time I came, I ordered a glass of the sauv blanc and the grilled artichoke. Artichoke = perfection, with a garlicky aioli. We have a winner! Second time, I was back with a big group - beers, cosmo, mojito (which was made incorrectly and was wayyyy to sweet and reminded me of why I don't usually like Cheesecake), and sauv blanc/pinot were all ordered by us. One friend ordered the spinach artichoke dip, which turned out be my favorite this time, and another friend and I spitl the crab artichoke dip (this was pretty meh). We also ordered the greek salad and gorgonzola salad. All of this was on happy hour. Someone else at the table also ordered mac and cheese and said it was pretty good. Of all of the stuff we've tried, this is only the tip of the iceberg for the happy hour menu, and happy hour menus are usually pretty short. Nice selection of both food and drinks, all for reasonable prices. Good pick for happy hour!"
L M.,"Signal Hill, United States",2,23,7,5.0,11/1/2014,Markelle P- please read. I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience at Cheesecake Factory but you have blamed the wrong server. The lady who served you was not Lisa C.  She was actually on break and did not speak with you at all. They share the cash register and so her name was on the receipt even though she didn't serve you. You are disparaging her good name and that's not fair.  Please go in to Cheesecake Factory and see for yourself.  Lisa is a great bartender!
Mitchell W.,"Huntington Beach, United States",4,37,9,5.0,6/7/2015,"I must say I haven't been to Cheesecake Factory in quite a while. My review is mostly focused on the food because we had a pretty horrible customer service aspect of dinner but it was out of the control of the staff so I won't blame them. I expect a pretty good quality of food for the prices and location and was overwhelmingly surprised at how great everything was. Started with a super manly (sarcasm) Peach Bellini (sp?) and it was amazing. Very few places I have been can nail this fairly simple drink like they did. I ordered two more. I cannot remember the exact name of my dish but it was some sort of Steak Diane or something like that. It was the best steak and potatoes dish I have had so far in Huntington Beach. Absolutely amazing sauce with flawless sides as if the dish needed to be any more amazing. My cousin also got the Gumbo or jambalaya dish, and it was also amazing. Perfect amount of spicy while still being deliciously seasoned. I must say I am sad to hear that the Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake was taken off the menu. Lots of good choices of cheesecake but not many for people like me who don't want a overly rich cake. Overall definitely worth the money and will be returning as soon as my little college budget can afford it!"
