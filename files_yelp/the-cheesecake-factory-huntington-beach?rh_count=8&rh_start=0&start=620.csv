Angel Q.,"Irvine, United States",7,342,70,3.0,2/1/2012,"I've been here before and the experience was pleasant.  This past experience actually went down hill a bit for me.   I have to say the server was super friendly and was being very helpful.  Just wasn't as great as I was expecting. The food came out with BLACK bacon pieces in my food.  yes... black.  Have you ever had black bacon pieces before?   that sure was my first time.  I don't think i would have noticed the difference if they had taken it out.   Really?  I ate char.   The food was dripped with oil at the bottom, you just can't see because its so dark.  Just lift up the pasta and you'll see all the oil that is suppose to give you cardiovascular problems.   You eat more of it, it will kill any diets you ever wanted to be on.   If i didn't pay attention to my bill closely I would have been charged extra stuff that wasn't mine.  Its an honest mistake i understand, but it didn't help with black bacon.  I think she felt bad or embarrassed about it, because her attitude changed after I told her about that.    Of course, the cheesecakes are like heaven! haha."
Harold R.,"Signal Hill, United States",32,90,149,4.0,17/10/2011,"Today is my son's b'day, so were does he like to go every year? cheesecake factory. i only go here once a year so we spare no expense. my boy loves there popcorn shrimp so that was just one of the appitizer we had. the shrimp are a nice size, but for 11.00 bucks the basket is kinda small. that's why i ordered the texmex eggrolls and those where delicioso to say the least. chucks of chicken with a roasted corn salsa with a nice pico de gallo. wanted to order more but the wife gave me the stink eye. good table bread also. sourdough and wheat selections served warm with real butter...nice! the wife and i both ordered the chicken madeira, yum! chicken breast pounded thin with mushroom gravy and cheese, served with asparagus and mash potato. probably the best meal i've had at cheescake factory. i'm not big on cheesecake but the original never dissapoints."
Nathan N.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,4,,4.0,6/1/2013,"Service was okay. Not too good, and not bad either. Be warned, the atmosphere is pretty loud, so don't expect to get that much sensible conversation here. The wait time is really long at times; be sure to get their a good 40-50 minutes earlier on weekend nights.  Food is tasty as always, and as always at the Cheesecake Factory: portion sizes are huge!"
Dominique N.,"Garden Grove, United States",91,96,14,4.0,15/9/2012,"Went here on a Friday night and had about a 30 minute wait. Average time for wait so nothing to compain about here. The table got the Cajun Jambalaya, the BBQ pizza, and the cobb salad. The Cajun Jambalaya was really good as the noodles were al dente and the sauce was really savory. The bbq pizza had a thin crust but the BBQ was really good. The waiter here was really helpful in helping us celebrate a birthday and hopefully would want to come again!"
John B.,"Fountain Valley, United States",557,228,625,2.0,24/3/2010,"It got the job done... party of 5.  Tues nite.  ""popped our friend's Cheesecake cherry"".  We should have chosen a different day.  Cheesecake Factory has long been a favorite of mine.   We got the table we wanted. We had drinks to relax. Our waitress, bless her heart, was extremely busy...on a Tuesday night...with half the restaurant's tables empty.  She rarely came by, forgot my drink (ok I didnt order because then I would be talking over someone else's order)  AND we had to wait forever for her to run my card. well, I thought they wanted my money.  I did eat after all. Thankfully there were other waitresses from other tables more attentive to me and my party. Now on to the positive side.  I liked the corn fritter, the fried cheese and the strawberry cheesecake.  and that is it... Grade for Ambiance: A- Grade for Food: B- Grade for Service: C-"
Scott W.,"Fullerton, United States",141,25,5,1.0,27/10/2011,"To be honest I wish I didn't have to give this even one star.  I mean don't get me wrong, I normally very much like Cheesecake Factory, but let me tell you about this experience.   1.  We order everything seems to be going good so far.   2.  After some of us need refills the server comes to refill them, although when doing she lets her tie get into my friend's drink.  So we tell her and she gets a ""new"" drink for her, that notably tasted dirtier.   3. They bring us food, and one of the dishes is completely wrong.  So the manager comes and says that he will get her's out in 8 minutes and as she waits she could have a free salad (and the entree would be complemented also), so I think O.K.  They are starting to make up for it. 4.  The salad comes out 10 minutes later.  Then the entree comes out about 25 minutes later, after all of us are finished with the meal.   5. We order two desserts, one comes out cold (""hot"" apple crisp) and the other (a cake) is messed up by the same server letting her tie go across the the cake.   6.  Then we get the bill, nothing is taken off, not even the food the manager said he was going to comp.    7.  Ten minutes later, when I am finally able to track down the manager, he comped the things that got messed up.   Overall worst experience I have ever had at any Cheesecake.  I personally will most likely not be going back to this location.  Even Cheesecake Factory in general, to me, has suffered a loss in image because of this.  Left the table not feeling like we as a group had a good time at all."
Stephanie L.,"Bellevue, United States",595,114,55,5.0,2/7/2011,"One of my favorite restaurants! I've NEVER had a bad meal here. I have tried a crazy amount of things on the menu after coming here for so long. The salmon with mashed potatoes, endive low cal salad, several different pasta dishes, all of which were absolutely excellent.  The decor inside is standard Cheesecake factory. Opulent railings and decor that screams for attention in dim settings. The floor walking to the bathroom is always so damn slippery though, so be careful in your stilletos. My only real beef with this cheesecake factory is that it is so ridiculously popular and they dont take reservations. I think i've had to wait every time I've come here, but the wait has never been over 30 minutes for me which is great. One thing about cheesecake factory that always stands out is their outstanding service and great food. Always one of my favorite places to go for dinner."
Joanna U.,"Huntington Beach, United States",12,11,4,2.0,12/4/2014,"Came here yesterday for my anniversary and I am so disappointed. The service was so bad. Our server did not even make eye contact with us or even greeted us. He went straight to the point and asked for our drinks. I told him, I would like a water and he just left without even asking my boyfriend what he wanted. My bf had to stop him and ask for his drink. It was so awkward. The food was good but the service just killed everything. I didn't catch his name but let just say he was pretty flamboyant..."
Haley H.,"Daytona Beach, United States",0,1,,1.0,28/1/2015,"Worst day ever..I just moved here a few weeks ago and it was my first birthday away from family and friends..the food wasn't very good, they forgot it was my birthday, and we were there for 3 hours cause the service was so slow and just awful. Never again."
T A.,"Orange County, United States",8,56,,4.0,6/4/2015,"Early bday dinner for oldest daughter & Easter dinner for immediate families. A grand total of 14 attended. I had the salmon genovese b/c it was Good Friday, which had great flavor. Washed it down with Stella Artois draft. Calamari for appetizer. For dessert, Bday girl had a brownie with ice cream, & the others had original cheesecake, mocha cheesecake. Let me pay special compliments to our waiter, Gabriel, who made our visit very enjoyable. He had the perfect amount of professionalism & attentiveness for my party, which includes 6 kids & 8 adults, one of whom is my aging Mom, whom he treated with kindness & respect. I spotted that immediately! When he brought out my daughter's brownie, he decorated it & spelled her name correctly in chocolate on the plate. He definitely paid attention to wifey! I have never had a problem with Cheesecake Factory, & I would have given 5 stars but settled for 4 stars b/c they do not accept dinner reservations for large parties. You'll have to show up at least 1 hour prior to your scheduled dinner time to put your name on a waiting list & pray they'll get u in @ a decent time. It took 1.5 hours from my showing up early & putting down my name on waiting list before they had an area to seat us. So, large party of diners Beware!"
Body By B.,"Irvine, United States",43,53,25,5.0,2/7/2012,"Exceptional service as always from this location!!! Ashlyn, our server was well versed on the menu and specials (which seems like a gimme, but isn't true of all servers). She also had that knack for being there when needed and not when not (again not everyone can pull that off). Love love love the new Skinnylicious menu. I've tried both the chicken tacos and the turkey burger. Both delish! [I have the best intentions for these reviews, but since you can't finish them on your cell there's a delay! Visit was on 1/6/12.]"
Liz G.,"Huntington Beach, United States",23,61,17,2.0,22/11/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this particular location doesnt seem to have the same high quality as the Fashion Island or Galleria locations.  I always order the Farfalle pasta and the sauce was hardly creamy at all and very oily.  I was disappointed in my dish which is ALWAYS my safe bet when eating at Cheesecake Factory.   My daughter's macaroni and cheese was delicious but was so hot, she couldnt eat it until our food was almost done.  My pasta was barely steaming at serving while hers was a full blown steady billowing stream of steam. I would pin my disappointment on the kitchen for this particular experience."
Judy C.,"Huntington Park, United States",112,10,1,1.0,23/5/2015,I love all other Cheesecake Factory's but this one really was awful. First the hosts called my party Nd asked us to follow him then took us to a dirty table then told us he thought it was clean and just left us in the middle of the restaurant waiting. Then we waited for about 30 min before we even got asked if we wanted anything to drink or even a word spoken to us.  Then we got a waiter who dropped out forks and said don't worry about it LOL . Just all around horrible service. Another 30 min wait to get our checks. Very disappointed.
Heather P.,"Costa Mesa, United States",240,18,1,4.0,6/5/2012,"Great food, always been a fan of this place since I was a kid. You can choose anything from pasta, fish, meat, etc. It's a place to go when you aren't quite sure what you want but they probably have something to take care of your appetite.  My boyfriend and I usually get out the shop pretty late and this place always accommodates us. The serving staff is great even up to the last hours on a saturday night. Always making sure we have enough time before the kitchen closes. Even when the kitchen is about to close everything taste just as good as it would if the place just opened. Their only down fall is delivery. When I call in sometimes, they have to put me on hold to transfer over to the bakery. Sometimes they don't even come back so I have to hang up and call back again. Thank goodness for my patiences because it's really annoying.  Overall this has a great staff, location, and overall the food is amazing. Not what you expect from such a large chain, they definitely know how to do it right!"
Jax L.,"Long Beach, United States",191,266,390,2.0,6/5/2011,"I just come here for dessert. oh and the girlfriend LOVES their table wheat bread, we buy it by the loaves!  The service is mediocre, and the lighting is way dimmer than the CF in Irvine, but that's okay.  The food, however, is not so great.  I think the problem is their menu is too vast.  They try too hard to go too much.  They need to focus and edit to refine a lot of the dishes here,  especially for the prices they are charging.  I refuse to help them conserve energy with this hit and miss service and the food is not even memorable, or if it is, the only thing I remember is to take my ass to CPK the next time I am hungry in Bella Terra."
Susan F.,"Cypress, United States",0,1,,5.0,13/6/2015,"My Husband and I decided to do dinner here tonight for my birthday. The Service was great and the food was even better. Our server Gabriel V, was very polite and made sure he had everything we needed at all times. I will definitely be coming back!"
Kassandra M.,"El Segundo, United States",9,3,2,1.0,12/4/2009,"I can't even believe I have to give this place a star at ALL!   First off, I was a bit weary of visiting this Cheesecake Factory location to begin with.  The last time I visited (a little over a year ago, maybe), my boyfriend at the time received his chicken way, WAY under cooked.  Granted, the manager on duty at the time was very gracious and comped the meal from our bill and made sure he received another order of the chicken done right.   Anyway, I tried to lighten up and give this place another chance and boy, was I wrong in doing so!  I went with my parents and was looking forward to having a nice Easter lunch.  I ordered the lunch special grilled salmon with a side of steamed broccoli.  The dish wasn't bad--I was having a pretty good time until half way through my meal, as I was about to take a huge bite of broccoli, I noticed something strange on my plate.  At first it looked like a piece of broccoli stalk that had been cut or fallen off...  When I took a closer look, I discovered (to my complete and UTTER HORROR) that it was NOT a piece of broccoli at all...but a small, very dead CATERPILLAR (I have pictures as proof)!  Needless to say, I spent the next few minutes pulling an ""Exorcist"" in the bathroom.  The manager DID take what I ordered off the menu and DID give me a gift card, but again, needless to say--I will not be visiting again, thank you very much.   Please please please inspect your food before dining here!"
Paul V.,"Anaheim, United States",22,41,2,5.0,18/9/2012,"There are days when we know we want a hamburger. Or Cuban food. When we have a craving for something specific, and we know where to go to get it. And then there are days when we just can't decide what we want, we just want a good meal. On those latter days, we go to the Cheesecake Factory, where we know we'll get pretty good food at pretty good prices, and the menu is extensive enough to satisfy our undecided palates. So this brief review is more of a comment about the exemplary service we received. Our server, Jennifer T., saw our twin boys being slipped into their high chairs and greeted us with twin plates of sliced bananas. From that point on she ensured that all the little details - including a ""made to order"" pasta dish and club soda for an unfortunate sauce stain - were taken care of in a can-do, unhurried manner; giving us time to enjoy dining out with the boys. The conscientious, friendly service Jennifer provided set her, and this Cheesecake Factory, well above many other restaurants in the area."
Ramy H.,"Garden Grove, United States",2,30,6,5.0,22/12/2013,"I like to come here for romantic dates when feeling like I want to spend a few more bucks. The place is perfect for a nice date: dim lights, nice atmosphere, privacy in the booths, and the table set ups. I am never let down when I come here! The service is great, the menu is full of options, and the food is amazing.  Cons: Sometimes their bread is stale and they usual try to hide it by warming it up (how I know is that after cooling down, it starts to harden pretty quickly). Besides that fact.. I love their wheat bread for it's sweet sweet bread. yum Another thing! I always ask for the soup of the day, so far I am loving the cream of chicken and the potato soup. Yes, potato soup! It's better than a stuffed potato, but is thicker than the usual soup"
