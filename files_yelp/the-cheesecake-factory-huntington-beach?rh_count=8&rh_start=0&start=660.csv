Kat R.,"Costa Mesa, United States",93,63,25,2.0,27/2/2014,"We came in on a Thursday night and were told it was a ten minute wait... 25 minutes later we were still waiting. We then get called to be seated and see that our table is still being cleaned off... So we then had to wait another 10 minutes. So we finally get seated and are served our appetizers super quick! The food was delicious, but it took FOREVER to get our dinner. Service was poor and I won't return to this location. But Cheesecake Factory usually doesn't disappoint with the food. Super bummed."
Gabby A.,"Long Beach, United States",119,269,9,2.0,3/1/2011,"It's probably silly to write a review on a chain restaurant. Because as we all know, no matter how many bad reviews they get on Yelp people will continue to eat at these establishments. But being the passive aggressive diner that I am...I just had to write a bad review. The Cheesecake Factory is insanely popular due to its large menu. That I get...it's actually pretty decent in portion and taste. But the prices...wow!!   The thing that sucks about this particular location the most is the service! Been to this location about 3 times and the service has always been bad. I mean come on if I'm going to pay super high prices for mediocre food at least give me some decent service."
Raquel K.,"Tustin, United States",0,24,7,4.0,18/10/2014,"I host a monthly Ladies Luncheon and we decided to have it at Cheesecake Factory, in Huntington Beach, this month. I'm so glad we did! We arrived on a Saturday at Noon and expected a full restaurant, but were pleasantly surprised. It was busy, but not crowded. We had a reservation for 16 and they accommodated seating us right away, even tho' only half our party was there. We wanted to get started with ordering drinks and our server ""Laura J"" came to the table right away to get us taken care of. She was BEYOND AWESOME! We're talking ROCK STAR Server here people! We have a very particular group and she rolled with all of the requests and took care of everything without a problem. She even allowed us to get separate checks!!! This is unheard of in a group our size! The drinks and food were also awesome (My orange chicken was prepared perfectly). In fact, the only bummer about this location, is the parking situation. The restaurant is part of the Bella Terra Mall and people can be pretty jerk-like in the parking lot. There are limited spaces near the restaurant, so be prepared to walk - or splurge for the $5 valet parking (which I'll do next time). Regardless, our overall experience more than made up for lack of parking and I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this location."
Sandy T.,"Irvine, United States",103,107,16,3.0,1/11/2011,"Not crazy about the cheesecake. They tend to taste dry and much too thick. I'd rather have the Trader Joe's kind from the freezer section. The chicken Asian lettuce tacos were okay. Only one strip of chicken in a sea of vegetables! Very difficult to eat. I also ordered a mojito to go with my meal. Not too bad, but the $10.50 price left my wallet pretty sad."
Richard H.,"Rosemead, United States",23,182,2,3.0,2/1/2014,"I called ahead on NYE and they informed us they were not taking reservations for that day. Approximate wait time was unknown, so we decided to arrive expecting to wait roughly 40-60 minutes. We arrived at about 6PM and was told roughly 45 minutes, so we went to shop around at Kohls. When we came back in 20 minutes, our beeper was already vibrating and we got a seat outside. Service was good, however, the food was just mediocre. Our stuffed mushrooms were delicious -- we wished there were more (5/5). However, the Jambalaya pasta with chicken/shrimp failed to impress (2/5).  Decent experience, but for a place like this, I expected a better tasting dish."
Lola C.,"Orange County, United States",22,123,12,3.0,9/12/2010,"As everyone already knows, the Cheesecake Factory offers a big variety of cheesecakes which are all really good.  Today I had the Reeses Peanut Butter Cheesecake mixed with Chocolate cake.  I never tried a combination of cheesecake & cake and it was good. The service overall was okay... but I like the Anaheim Gardenwalk's location better (even though I think that location is ridiculous for making ALL customers pay for parking).  The food at this location was Not as good as Anaheim's location, in fact, I was not impressed with the food at all!! Especially for the price me & my friend paid!"
Cristina P.,"Buena Park, United States",10,28,1,2.0,25/1/2014,"We went on a Wednesday night with a party of 11 and it didn't take a long time get us sit but service was terrible no refill for any of our drinks and there was waitress passing by our table back and forth even the manager walked by our table and didn't do anything, didn't ask how was the food or how everything was going so I had to flag him down and say hey we need more refills finally our waitress came back to refill our drinks but she had no personality she didn't care to give us good service because the tip was going to be included on the bill no matter what,  food was ok and dessert was the only good thing they had, but service was definitely terrible not planning on going back to cheesecake factory"
Michael M.,"Pleasanton, United States",37,64,,2.0,24/2/2011,"I was glad to see I wasn't the only one who thinks the service sucks here.. If I go to CF, I usually go to the location at the grove.  Everyone there seems to be in good mood and attentive.  This location, just sucks! Tonight started by sitting at the bar while we waited for a table and listened to the bartender, L, complain to the servers about work.  I wanted to say, if you don't like your job, quit! The waitress was so quick and seemed like she just wanted to go home and get us the hell out of there, even though it was 8pm.  Idk, but when I go out and am paying money, I want to get great service. I always seem to go with the Cajun Jambalaya which is really good! Def. recommend. Overall food is good, but you could get the same thing at any location.  It's the service that makes this place only worthy of two stars..."
Steve T.,"Orange County, United States",327,198,141,3.0,13/6/2011,"I've only been to cheesecake maybe 3 times in my life. The first two times it was during lunch time, this time however it was for dinner.  My friend was jokingly saying oh your taking me to a candlelight dinner eh? I'm like HUH? What are you talking about.? When we were seated is when i realize oh there was a candlelight. I realize how romantic this place can be with the dim lights and candlelight Well anyhow on to the food review: Bread Basket (Complimentary): Molasses and Sourdough bread and butter Cajun Jambalaya Pasta ($16.95) It's consists of  Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers over Linguine pasta and then drenched with a very spicy Cajun sauce or so they claim. From a rate of 1 to 10 in spiciness i say it must be a 1 lmao what a joke. They mention that its their most popular pasta dish. I don't know how they came to that conclusion because yes it taste like very fresh ingredients however where is that Southern Cajun Taste. I know how Jambalaya taste like this tasted no where near it and was really bland.  Overall: Ambiance: 4 outta 5 Parking: 3 outta 5, parking may be hard to get maybe park in the parking structure is ideal. Service: 4 outta 5, very attentive waiters/waitresses"
Karla F.,"Newport Beach, United States",13,27,1,4.0,20/1/2014,"My family came here with a group of 20 for a random family dinner last night. About 10 adults, 9 children, and a baby. They sat our large party at a table outside and it was perfect because we had our own heat lamps and once the kids were restless they were able to run around. The waitresses were very patient with our large party and did their very best to please us all. Great place for a large party! The food was good, service for a large party with kids...EXCELLENT!"
Lisa W.,"Orange County, United States",554,99,618,5.0,5/1/2013,"I love this place! I've been coming to this place for years and I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience here. The service has always been very polite, the food has always been good and I have never had to wait a very long time to be seated. I love that there is a wide variety menu also. Basically, something for everyone. They also have some unusual milkshake alcoholic beverages that are really yummy as long as your not dieting, my god, because they are pretty rich. I've tried the Chocolate Monkey which was very good, almost a dessert in itself. I've also tried a peanut butter and chocolate concoction there also, very rich but very tasty if you like that sort of thing, which I do. Also the ambiance here is very nice. The Cheesecake Factory has a nice but casual feel to it. I also like the decor of this place. I like how at night the restaurant kind of dims its lights. Like I said, casual but nice. They have a great chicken salad sandwich with almond slivers in it to die for! I've also ordered their cheesecakes for birthdays also, which have always been awesome! I love how this restaurant has so much variety in their menu choices and in their cheesecake flavors. Makes for a unique dining experience that not just any restaurant can offer. I am definitely a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory in Brea and in Anaheim are also very good. This restaurant chain is highly recommended by me. I personally have always had great service here. I also would recommend this place in the case of gift certificates because you really can't go wrong. I'm definitely a fan."
Cameron M.,"Seal Beach, United States",0,6,,5.0,5/5/2014,"I loved it. The server was so nice and pleasant and didn't really feel intrusive. The food was amazing, the only tricky part was picking off of the short novel that is the menu. But that just means there is a lot of options. It was a great meal."
Hany A.,"Westminster, United States",0,8,,4.0,29/4/2014,Perfect place to have delicious american food with ur friends.. U may wait a while but it rly does matter.. The stuff were so friendly!! & don't forget to keep some space for their deserts ;)
Duke J.,"Long Beach, United States",0,7,,2.0,21/2/2015,Had dinner tonight at cheesecake factory was seated down at a table that was filthy dirty it was sticky and had food still on it but our place settings were clean! Pointed that out to the manager and he had someone wipe it down and said he would take care of us. I'm not sure exactly what he meant by take care of us but he did ABSOLUTEY NOTHING.
Nhi Thao M.,"Santa Ana, United States",110,243,1810,4.0,17/9/2011,"I ate at this Cheesecake Factory location for lunch today while waiting for my oil change and car wash to finish.  I've previously been to this location two or three times, and it's pretty good.  I was seated quickly, and the staff were very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the lunch special: the everything pizza with a salad for $12.95.  I was very impressed with the salad.  It was a lot bigger than I expected and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was very yummy.  The everything pizza was delicious.  My lunch tasted very healthy and definitely satisfied my hunger."
Martin S.,"Long Beach, United States",4,6,2,1.0,15/2/2015,"I was completely disgusted leaving the restaurant!!!!! Their was bugs in my drinks!!!!!! The food is really good there but i'd recommend going to another location, i went last night for Valentine's day, witch i know its a busy night for them, and halfway thru my dinner i grabbed my beer to take a drink and noticed 2 little bugs swimming towards my mouth!!!! I told the waiter and he apologized and brought me another beer. As we finished our meal and waited for our dessert my wife notice something land in her water, i had to turn my flashlight on to see because its kinda dark in there, and another bug landed in her drink. My wife and i were completely disgusted and didn't even want to eat our dessert, we asked for a box immediately and the check. I told the waiter he needs to tell his manager or let me speak with them and all i received was the check i paid and left!!! The whole drive home all we could think is how many bugs landed on our dinner and us not even notice due to how dark it is!!!!   I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT RESTAURANT!!"
Ron M.,"San Clemente, United States",0,1,,5.0,10/4/2015,"I took my mom, her husband, my daughter and her family as well as my girlfriend for my mom's birthday. We were a party of seven. It was 6:30 on a Friday night and the place was packed. We were seated within 20 minutes and shortly there after our server named Olivia was introducing herself and welcoming us to the Cheese Cake Factory. Olivia did a Fantastic job and our meals were awesome. We had some particular people in our party and there orders were anything but standard. However, Olivia and her team were money! Can't wait to go back. I'm sure the other servers are good as well, but we'd like to get Olivia again!"
Cindy W.,"Santa Ana, United States",67,121,3,4.0,27/7/2011,"This review is just for their happy hour.  I'm sure a ton of people order something random just for their bread basket.  I mean...why else do people go to Cheesecake Factory? Ha, on a more serious note, they have a pretty good happy hour here.  I believe it's from 4-6:30 and everything is pretty darn cheap.  I would say, it ranges from $4-$6 and the good is a pretty decent portion.  They also have a small plates menu which is no way small.  Because let's be honest, Cheesecake Factory portions are known to be for people with endless stomachs.  The boy and I split the ahi carpaccio, roadside sliders, mac&cheese balls, and greek salad.  All were delicious.  I think there were 4 sliders and 4 mac&cheese balls which were pretty big portions considering how much they cost.  The mac&cheese balls were so disgustingly good.  It's that feeling where you want to eat the entire thing, but you know how bad it is for you.  Between the happy hour menu and the small plates menu, you have more than enough choices. I will definitely be back to try their other things on the menu.  It was a great way to try different things without being stuck with one ginormous platter of food that you will barely eat since you stuffed yourself with so much bread."
Katherine b.,"Buena Park, United States",370,56,5,3.0,17/9/2010,"I've been here many times but haven't written a review yet.  So here it goes. Well... let me just say that this place is somewhere I'd go once in a while like on a date or something.  The food is all right.  It doesn't make me say ""damnnnn this is bommmmb"" or anything but its good.   Service was kinda bleh.  The lady seemed like she got mad everytime i asked for something.... Even though I was trying to ask with a smile! :) Hahah oh well... I guess that didn't work.   And whenever I come here... geez I feel like my eye sight gets worse and worse! The lighting is SUPER DIM!  Its like... uhhh can I get a flashlight up in here?! Hahah no but really... its dark. I guess they want that romantic-y type of feel.  So I this would probably be a good place to bring your bf's or gf's or someone who you really don't want to be seen with. HA I'm kidding again.  Anyway, as for food... the ones that I remember trying are: 1. chicken madeira 2. mushroom burger 3. philly cheesesteak 4. chicken & mushroom something pasta 5. hibachi steak 6. baked macaroni & cheese appetizer 7. white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake 8. the motherload chocolate cake (i think that's what it's called) **the following were tasted at different times... NOT in one sitting. hahah** So the food that I've tried, (i probably didnt list them all cuz I don't really remember the names... were just like my rating... A-OK. Nothing really stood out to me. But don't get me wrong... their dishes are not bad tasting at all."
Lilian L.,"Midway City, United States",0,1,,4.0,25/4/2013,"Cheesecake factory, a fancy restaurant, can be an astonishing place to dine at  for a birthday dinner. It was great service and a waitress who welcome people the second they step in. There's not many cheesecake factories around Orange County. In fact, there are only 3 located around Orange County. One in Newport, Huntington Beach and Anaheim. Cheesecake factory has always been a busy place. Especially on weekends and occasions, an abundance of people come out to eat. Cheesecake Factory is not like any other restaurant.             The menu is a size of a bible. Their menu has over 200 different type of foods made from scratch each day. Combines to make an appetizing taste to everyone's tummy. Moreover, Cheesecake Factory have a portion of skinnylicious and small snack plates for those who stay fit and eat healthy. Just keep in mind that Cheesecake Factory has many varieties to choose from even for people who are eating healthy. So, this is definitely a place to go to if you haven't yet tried it already. There's also dessert like cheesecake and that obviously what this place is most known for. Known for their cheesecake. Many different flavors of cheesecake. Of course, original cheesecake too if you don't like any of the flavors that there is.             I've only been to Cheesecake Factory 5 times but I absolutely love it here! I've always wanted to try every single dish that they have. But, i only come here every so often. Only for occasional celebrations. The last time I've been here was for my friend's birthday. I honestly love the pasta here! Depending on what I crave that day, I usually only choose to look at the portion of pastas. It's the first thing I look for as soon as I grab onto the menu. Pasta Da Vinci is my favorite. The sauce is a light orange color that tastes just like thousand island salad dressing. The pasta is topped with sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onions and parmesan cheese. The taste of the creamy sauce is so delish. Melts into my mouths and feels as if I'm in heaven. All I think about is the greatness of how hot and tender the chicken and mushrooms are. Just by thinking about the name ""Pasta Da Vinci"" makes me ravenous already.            The location of cheescake factory that I go to is the one in Bella Terra on Edinger. Cheesecake factory is right next to Starbucks and right across from Buffalo Wild  Wings. There's not a problem about people wanting to sit outside and eat because there's a patio. Customers don't often complain about feeling frigid because there are fire pits and heaters to keep warmth surrounding the area. Workers try to satisfy their customers as much as possible and provide more than just a sufficient service towards everyone. The Cheesecake factory always has calming music for people to social with one another and the customer always seems to be jovial. This location at Bella terra is just like any other ones in Orange County. They're all the same and a utopian place to eat at every once in awhile but not a place to eat at daily. Thats why, its most known for having birthday dinners, going out on a date, or other gatherings               Overall, I rate this place a 9 out 10 because of the marvelous taste of different foods they have. I recommend to eat here. For ""first timers"" who haven't been here, its an amazing place. Not only the great taste of the foods but also the great service as well! Cheesecake factory fulfills my satisfaction and I can never be disappointed with anything that they serve. With over 200 types of foods in a large menu booklet, Theres not one thing that I don't like. The portion of different kinds of foods are so large that people often get lost in sight of what they want. In my opinion, definitely try to the pastas! I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do. Appetizers are another great choice as well if you're ravenous because it fills you up. Well, anything can fill you up actually. Because of how big the plates are, theres never too little. There's always an amount that's more than enough."
