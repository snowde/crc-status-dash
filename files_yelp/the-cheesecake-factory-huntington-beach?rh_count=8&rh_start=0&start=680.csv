Alina T.,"Cerritos, United States",0,19,1,1.0,29/8/2014,"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant ever. I drove 20 minutes to get here and this is the kind of shit that we're served?! My friend was really embarrassed to have taken us here. She was expecting something else, having gone to another Cheesecake Factory with great service and quality of food, and we ended up with below subpar food here. We got hard bread that was unedible. My friend got undercooked pasta, oily cold onion rings (he sent them back, and they still came back oily and cold). This Cheesecake Factory location is not the best for having dinner for friends. Also the 5-star review about the jambalaya was a lie. The reason why I think he or she posted it was for reasons of cash or because they confused this location for another Cheesecake Factory. To be honest the pasta was undercooked and a meat my friend was chewing...it was the type of undercooked-stringy tendon bad. And it was a mix of undercooked and overcooked meats. The buffalo blasts were the only redeeming quality of the dinner and one of my friends felt bad for the waitress because while the service wasn't that bad, the waitress deserved better because she was friendly and sociable. My friend does not recommend the pastas. It's not terrible but it's, at the very least, edible. If you're expecting college student homemade quality food  flavors (and your chef is your best friend who you love and you know is sensitive about hard crits and blunt honesty) that lasts in your mouth and you're alright with that, it's not as bad. The quality of the food they put out is not reliable. For the price Cheesecake Factory offers, the entrees are not that hyped up. The cheesecakes are the best of their menu and in retrospect this makes sense. Also I ordered Mac n cheese and just putting this out there a restaurant with the word cheese in it should not be serving Mac and cheese that someone with a complete lack of cooking skills could outcook. I have literally made better Macaroni and cheese. The bread is hard as stone and we asked for candles repeatedly but we never got any. I will never come back here again. I couldn't finish my meal. My friend ordered strawberry lemonade and he got something completely different. Also I'm here on a Friday, where there isn't even a lot business and as a person who works I cannot fathom how anyone would spend their hard earned cash on a 7 dollar bowl of absolute bland pasta that you can make for 50cents and I'm definitely not paying for the terrible cooking skills of the ""chef"" in the kitchen.  To make matters worse, at the end even the pen malfunctioned when I was writing the check. AND AS THE BIGGEST, WORST PART OF THE EXPERIENCE...one of my friends got seriously ill. We were watching uncomfortably as she literally hightailed to the restroom and threw up, for the second time. In one friend's opinion, the chef employed is bringing the reputation of the brand down. Only reason why I'm not giving this restaurant 0 stars is because it's not possible."
Jaimie E.,"New Brunswick, United States",15,16,21,2.0,28/8/2010,"I really am done with dining at the Cheesecake Factory, the only reason you should be coming here is ... Surprise! Their cheesecake. That's it.  A lot of their food is overpriced for the way the food is prepared; I have experienced better meals at lower prices; why? Because these restaurants don't have a HUGE menu! The menu is enormous, it takes several minutes to figure out what exactly would be appetizing, when it comes out, you can TASTE the mediocrity, the instant powders, the stuff that you could have put together for a price less than what they have.  It's not all doom and gloom here at TCF, their cheesecake is phenomenal, something they seem to perfect and do well at. Every x amount of months, they come out with a new cheesecake to have people try. The new cheesecake, this time, was Piña Colada Cheesecake; it didn't appeal to me as much as the white chocolate macadamia nut caramel cheesecake did. Yum! It's THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION that has me gnashing my teeth; I have been to TCF at Brea, HB, one in Arcadia, Pasadena and a few others. With this one!? I don't enjoy so much. I came back to this location for a 3rd chance, maybe it was a rookie cook? Maybe the recipe is really that awful tasting? Maybe I should have tried something that's more popular.  After looking at several reviews, and asking the waitress what entree was the most popular, I ordered the Spicy Crispy Beef and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Verdict? Gross. It's something you could have whipped up at home without paying $16.95 for. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is not delicious, again, not for the price. The dish was nicely presented, the chicken was moist, the shrimp was nice, the taste of this dish overall was disappointing. It was as if one of the cooks took a ""Curry Spice"" seasoning powder and dumped it in a can of cream of coconut. The curry taste of the dish was artificial, just fake curry powder. The number of chicken and shrimp was rather small and there were more shreds of carrot and peas than rice.  The Spicy Crispy Beef was disappointing as well, I REALLY wanted to like this dish because I really enjoyed it when I had it at TCF in Brea. In Brea, their Spicy Crispy Beef was nicely crisped, not smothered in sauce, there was a huge portion of it, and you could taste the beef, taste the crispy exterior and that hint of sweet sauce. It reminded you of a Chinese take-out place where you'd order up your favorite calorie breaker and indulge in an evening of tasty junk food. The Spicy Crispy Beef experience at The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach? Not likely the same experience, much more disappointing. In fact, it was more of an insult! The Spicy Crispy Beef was drowning.. Yes, DROWNING, in sweet sauce. The crispiness of the beef strips were no longer crisp because they were asphyxiated in tubs of the sweet gravy; the strips, were not strips.. There were six thick strips of beef. Granted, the beef was tender and meaty, but the strips were too thick to have been cooked properly to attain that crispy exterior, YOU EXPECT.  AND, it was more of an insult because it's as if the cook(s) expects me to like my Americanized Chinese food to be smothered in mountains of corn syrup gravy, so much that every other ingredient on my dish would cancel out. You know, I could've just asked for a funnel and a bottle of the Chinese style jus and chugged it myself.. And possibly for half the price!  The Cheesecake was great, it was what it always is -awesome. When you order it, it comes out rather quickly and you're ready to eat the only thing TCF has perfected. Cheesecake. The White Chocolate Macadamia nut caramel cheesecake was beautiful. No complaints there.  Service? On Par, never a bad day with the service at TCF, I enjoy the service, it's speedy, it's accommodating and they're always positive. How they manage to stay positive and well mannered in such a busy environment is amazing, I give them props.  So, the overall gripe that I have with TCF is their hot meals, their food is not worth the money, it really isn't. It's as if you're paying for the ""hip"" ambiance, the service, the HUGE portions of food they give you and the fact that TCF is always in demand and therefore they feel they can charge these really high prices and get away with it. Don't get me wrong, it's a restaurant, you're ALWAYS paying for service, sometimes ambiance and sometimes huge portions; I just don't think TCF deserves my money.. Unless it's cheesecake, and that's it! Note: THIS location is not the best, I gave it enough chances and none were satisfying.  Safe Eats!"
Jason N.,"Westminster, United States",1,22,,5.0,16/2/2015,"I went here for Valentine's Day and although it was an extremely long wait, it was worth it. I got the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic pasta and my girlfriend got the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta and I have to say that both were very good and worth trying. The chicken in the pasta is probably the best chicken I've ever had in any pasta at other restaurants because of how soft and tender it was. The entrees here are pricey but they are totally worth trying. We then got the Oreo Cheescake afterwards and couldn't finish it because of how sweet it was. It just got tiring and boring. I wish to have gotten another cheesecake instead."
Pillin L.,"Costa Mesa, United States",1177,442,278,4.0,11/11/2010,"I walked into Cheesecake at about 5 o'clock on a Wednesday evening and I was pleasantly surprised. They have a happy hour!! Upon finding that out, we stroll to the bar and check out their menu. This isn't a TGIFridays happy hour. This is a The Cheesecake Factory happy hour. They had $5 appetizers. About 15 to choose from. And it's not just buffalo wings. Also on happy hour is small plates and snack. Prices varied from $5-$7. We decide to get the avocado egg rolls, roadside sliders and the ahi tartare. The ahi tartare was to die for! We wanted to order another one right after the first one came! It's small yes, but for 6.95, it's not such a bad deal. The avocados egg rolls were decent. I'm never a huge fan of them but it was tasty enough. The roadside sliders came with 4 sliders. Wow, they don't skimp on this happy hour. Only downside is their happy hour is from 4-6p.m.  I'm definitely coming back to try more things off their happy hour menu. It's a great deal. Drinks were a good deal too. mojitos, margaritas and long islands were all $5.Well drinks are $5 as well. I had a mojito and it was delicious. I asked the bar tender to make it with splenda instead of the simple syrup and she happily did it for me. Kuddos. I've eaten at Cheesecake many times and well. Their menu is very extensive. One of my favorites is the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Their portions are big so you always get at least 2 meals of an entrée."
Natasha X.,"Huntington Beach, United States",3,185,29,4.0,2/12/2013,"I love Cheesecake Factory! The food usually comes out quickly.  I always like my meals here.  I usually get the Skinnylicious Asian Salad.  Last time I was there I had the Skinnylicious Chicken with the farro, and it was delicious! I used to always get the Chicken Madiera...it's delicious if you like chicken, mushrooms, and cheese!"
Chloe K.,"Huntington Beach, United States",30,172,9,4.0,18/7/2011,I love their strawberry topped cheesecake! Their entree portions are huge enough to split. For appetizers get the fried mac n cheese. They have so many choices to choose from. Also the fruit smoothies are really good even though they are expensive. Try one.
Annie D.,"San Diego, United States",179,496,639,4.0,9/4/2009,"We went here last night with family for my little cousin's 21st birthday.  Everyone ordered something different but everything was good or very good. Their Steak Diane was cooked perfectly. The chopped salad had great flavor.  I was VERY happy with my Chicken Bellagio.  The portions here are big, so prices are really not that bad.  The service was good even though the staff seemed busy. Their mashed potatoes were not that great though.  Great place for something fun and casual.  (And can someone explain to me why all the white people come here and order Chinese food?)"
Jeff G.,"Newport Beach, United States",192,11,6,5.0,11/1/2014,"Love this place! Ridiculous menu. How is it possible to have that many items taste that good. Lisa the bartender rocked! Try her Firefly, Tequila perfected."
Mark A.,"Los Angeles, United States",374,435,670,4.0,9/10/2008,"Bella Terra is fairly new to me. I've always driven by it but never visited it. An outdoorsy mall venue of some sort, similar to The Block, Irvine Spectrum, Victoria Gardens, etc... Cheesecake Factory - my friend girl (yeah, she's one of my bff's) and I went here, since she mentioned of an uber hot blonde friend of hers working here. It was a sunday early evening, we weren't too hungry, but thirsty and down for a drink or two (plus an appetizer combo of some sort). We came here to get away from the house, since we spent most of the day working on a car project of hers... Have you tried their Appetizer combo (forgot the actually menu name)? Geez, it sound just about right (size terms) on the menu, but can be a bit overwhelming for 2 people to devour. 4 plates of stuff rolled in, something like calamari, qeusadillas, mini sweet corn tamales, eggrolls/wraps, chips and spinach/artichoke dip, buffalo strips, pot stickers. It was a lot of food, and that's why we didn't opt in ordering entrees.... smart choice, lol! Of yeah, the bread is the bomb! Bottomless! The good and the wierd - we spent the evening checking out the talent (did I mention how cool my friend is! lol!). However, it seems we got bamboozled in our seats because we had to sit near this couple that was being all touchy-feely with eachother. My friend-girl told me she saw 'groping' (cough, ewwww, not here not now!). Great place! I'd come back. Bad news, the hot blonde friend she spoke of wasn't there. :( 4 stars"
Dietrich S.,"Orange, United States",124,263,44,2.0,3/4/2011,"I must admit, I was biased coming in here. I had never been to this Cheesecake Factory location before, but I had been to others, and I have never ever had a good experience at The Cheesecake Factory. But a friend was having a birthday party here, so in I went. We had the Spinach and cheese dip as an appetizer. It tasted like they probably got it out of the Frozen food section from Ralph's. Very bland and stock, and meager portion considering the price. I felt like steak, and the only one that was really calling my name was the Filet Mignon. I should have saved that money because the filet was not flavorful, it was not tender, and it was not worth it. I will say they cooked it to proper medium-rare, but other then that, I should have ordered something else.  The problem with this place is evident if you study their menu. It looks like three schizophrenic chefs came up with it. They have Orange Chicken. They have white bean hummus. They have Pizza. They have Chicken and Biscuits. They have steaks. They have a Cuban sandwich. They have to decide what kind of restaurant they are! It is a total mess, they offer hundreds of items and none of them are worth ordering.  Ah, but what about the Cheesecake? Honestly, I have no idea. I think I have been to four different Cheescake Factories, and by the time desert rolls around, I have no faith that they won't screw that up too. Seriously, I only ate half of my filet mignon, the two onion rings and like 10 french fries that came with the steak. And trust me, I am usually a member of the clean plate club. I already felt like I wasted a bunch of money on a disappointing steak, I wasn't going to bother with cake. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Even if their Cheesecake is good, I am confident you can find better elsewhere."
Jillian C.,"Longview, United States",51,14,,5.0,21/2/2011,"This place gets five stars just for the cheesecake alone. Try the tirimisu cheesecake, pumpkin, and the white chocolate raspberry - you will NOT be disappointed :)  Other than that I've really only eaten here a handful of times, but have never been disappointed. The chicken salad sandwich is massive and decently priced too. I can't recall the other meal I've had but it was real thin, lightly crisped chicken breasts with a stellar sauce and asparagus. They also start off your meal with really good bread and butter. Yum..."
AC D.,"Santa Ana, United States",0,3,,4.0,1/2/2014,"Came late to get my mind off of schoolwork and the bartender Mike provided outstanding service. I had the Chicken Madeira which I enjoyed despite preferring 'heartier' meals. It had lots of mushrooms which I love so be forewarned. I also had a salty dawg which was large and refreshing. Generally this business reminds me of what Claim Jumper used to be before it went bankrupt with the generous portions and flavorful food, but with an overall higher level of quality to it all. I look forward to coming back many more times on my own and with my family if they enjoy the slices of cake I brought back. Note; I'll be sure to update this review after trying out their happy hour a few times and getting a better feel for the business as a whole. I got here around 11PM and was disappointed by being the only person sitting at the bar. This of course means that it is great for bringing 'da bros' or a date for a casual meal, but if you are looking for some 'nightlife' then this is not the place."
James E.,"Orange, United States",26,22,4,4.0,26/2/2011,This place has the best chips and gwac.. The food is hit or miss for me As well as the service.. The 4 stars is because I have had a lot more good experiences then bad ones. I go about 3 times a month and have 1 bad out of ever 5 or 6..
Joe O.,"Seal Beach, United States",30,41,51,4.0,27/1/2014,"We got there at 1:30 pm on a Tuesday, after the business lunch crowd had left.  We were seated immediately. Server was attentive, checked on us several times during eating. Refilled my drink twice, never had to ask. Lunch menu has good variety of food at lunch prices.  Very nice ambiance, every thing very clean.  No complaints. Not a cheap restaurant for us, not an every day restaurant cause the prices are higher than normal for us.  But, we will be back for nice occasions."
Nicole C.,"Garden Grove, United States",28,42,9,4.0,20/1/2013,"Delicious food, good service. The menu is immense which can be challenging to navigate when you're really hungry. Their portions are so big I never order dessert which seems a shame - seeing as cheesecake is their namesake! One downside is the dull roar of patrons trying to communicate over the loud music... But the food is well worth the loud atmosphere!"
Samuel C.,"Costa Mesa, United States",105,58,,2.0,27/2/2011,"Like an abusive relationship, you'll be coming back even though you know it's bad. Food is bad (especially avoid anything that has orange flavor), service is ok (it's not bad nor is it top notch) & prices are expensive (For the same quality, I could get it cheaper). What makes me come even though food is bad is the cheese cake. Without it, this place would've gotten out of business a long time ago. For that reason is why I give Cheesecake Factory 2 stars instead of 1."
Chau V.,"Los Angeles, United States",636,565,1123,3.0,4/6/2012,"Cheesecake Factory carries a variety of Asian/American dishes. I've dined at Cheesecake Factory a few times, but I didn't enjoy the savory selection very much. What I've tried and liked is their huge cheesecake. I love tiramisu, pineapple upside-down, kahlua cocoa coffee, and pina colada cake cheesecake."
Gennie M.,"Long Beach, United States",188,194,204,4.0,17/11/2010,"My friend decided to celebrate her birthday through a dinner date.. and obviously we ended up at ""The Cheesecake Factory"".  Walked in at around quarter to six and to my surprise there's not much people yet. We got accommodated right away and was seated near the bar. (Yes, they also serve Long Island Iced tea! sucks to be under 21 lol)  We made it to the happy hour and appetizers varies from $5-$7 and we ordered fried calamari which is not bad. On the side note: I love their bread! SO DELISH!  Then for the main dish we had New Orleans Shrimp which is good too and the shrimp is really tasty although I think it shouldn't go with steam rice. lol Everything is good! I would recommend to go on a trip and try their Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake (which I had to go because we're so damn full lol)  Good location! Just right by the 405 freeway :) Parking is not an issue at all.."
Shari W.,"Modesto, United States",11,36,9,5.0,4/10/2013,We had such a great lunch! Fresh guacamole to start! Excellent! BBQ chicken salad and Cobb.  Both were so fresh and very good! We will be back! Oh..... Excellent service too!
Adria L.,"Tustin, United States",88,200,89,5.0,20/5/2013,love this one great out door seating got my usual skinnylicious turkey avocado bacon sandwichmeal which was delicious never had avocados so fresh! seriously! for some reason i just love their coffee too delicious! a++
