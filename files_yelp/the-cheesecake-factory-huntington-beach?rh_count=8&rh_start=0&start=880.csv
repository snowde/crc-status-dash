Anna A.,"Portland, United States",551,389,165,5.0,14/8/2008,"There is no doubt in my mind this is as good as it gets for chain restaurants. I've never had a bad thing here. This particular location represents the essential oil of orange county - MILFs in burbs with hibiscus tattoos on their lower backs, upper middle class skater teens who represent the future white republicans of the OC, and 30 somethings looking to impress their dates by taking them to a place that has a crowd.  The martinis!!!! AHHHHH LOVE that Dirty Old Man Martini - with the blue cheese stuffed olives, extra dirty and extra smooth. Also, YOU MUST ORDER the strawberry martini. It's like 10 bucks or something but it takes the bartender 10 minutes to make! muhahaha just sit and watch that slave labor strawberry muddling, sweat dripping (but not in your drink - eek I hope!), martini shaking labor. It's all worth it my dears... The chicken lettuce cups are an obvious must. I mean, who DOESN'T order them? Uh, obviously the people who go to Macaroni Grill! The bang bang chicken is amazing, a little naughty, something to be shared. The fish specials are always good. The beef stroganoff (no and I'm not talking about cows masturbating you pervs!) is delish. The salads all good. The avocado roll appetizer, just do it. Cheesecake? well, duh!"
Davis S.,"Long Beach, United States",1,3,1,1.0,10/11/2013,"Avoid this location like the plague. Aside from waiting to be sitted, I had to wait an additional period to be serviced with our beverages. In increments of 30 minutes, the waiter would arrive to deliver our request that was ordered the pervious 30 minutes. I offer an incentive for better service. However, it only worsen the situation. I was frustrated by the lack of customers care, I decided not to order dessert. The server acknowledged her poor service, and for the first time engaged in a conversation that lasted no more than 2 seconds. She offered to bring a person (presumably the manager) to improve our experience. To add addition insult, the person (believe to be the manager) refused to appear. In stead, a pie slice was delivered free of charge. I decided to write this on the receipt ""Even with the incentive of a $20 tip would perhaps change your perspective in how you profiled us, your service did not improve. In my entire short life, I was astonished in the worst service ever to be encountered. Enjoy what you should not have been entitled."" I paid a 43% tip- a standard above the norm. Hope, this reverse cognitive approach would invoke better service."
Stephen D.,"Irvine, United States",531,19,15,1.0,17/4/2010,I ordered the Fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes on 4/16/10 @ 1pm from the Huntington Beach. They served it with spoon that had crusted food on it. Looks like crusted guacamole and chocolate. Absolutely disgusting. And it's not safe. Eat at your own risk!
Sherin T.,"Oceanside, United States",95,16,5,2.0,5/1/2011,"I normally love the cheesecake factory, and have been there several times however this experience was by the far worst I've had. Our server, Kaitlyn, was unpleasant from the start. She approached our table with a nonchalant mood and progressively got worse. One side cesar salad never came out and we assumed this was just a mistake on the kitchens behalf but thought nothing of it. Then all of our entrees came out except the entree that was for the girl with the cesar salad. Since i work in the food industry i immediately thought that this seemed as though Kaitlyn forgot to put that girls entire order in. After 10 minutes she finally noticed and then ran to the kitchen. A manager came over with a fake lie and said the food would be right up. Worst of all the server never apologized. Only thing they did right was comp the salad. No compliments to the service this time."
Christopher M.,"Long Beach, United States",235,405,252,2.0,10/7/2008,"Been to a lot of the other Cheesecake factory locations in Southern California, and the one in Vegas (even their sister restaurant in the Venetian - forget the name). It's usually pleasant, food is pretty good in general. Hosts are slightly aloof, but most servers are cordial and accommodating.  We've eaten at the HB one a couple times due to its close proximity.This location is lacking something though.  Maybe its due to the area - it's next to a bookstore, in a shopping plaza. I know other ones are in malls and such, but this feels almost strip mall-ish. The ambience that other spots have (Redondo Beach, Marina del Rey) is lacking here.  In addition every time we have eaten here they have messed up our orders. One request: no onions. And every time we get our food - onions. At least we got free cheesecake out of it. Hmm, maybe I'm on to something.... Anyway, some highlights on the menu. Avocado eggrolls are great, as is Miso Salmon and Bistro Shrimp pasta. Tuxedo cheesecake is a favorite of mine, but most ppl go for Dulce de Leche or White Chocolate Raspberry. Hard to go wrong with the dessert menu though, most of it is tasty. So while I do like the Chesecake Factory overall, not a fan of this one."
Steve T.,"Irvine, United States",52,122,19,4.0,26/1/2010,"Awesome place! What's the downfall? The long ass wait! Does not matter when you come there is always a long wait. If you don't mind waiting almost 40 minutes for a table for two, then you may enjoy this place a bit more. I can see why everyone enjoys coming here because the food is good and the cheesecake are absolutely delicious! I love their diverse menu so when you continually come back you can always try something new. But I somehow get the same thing every time I come back."
Mindy H.,"Irvine, United States",419,324,291,2.0,26/6/2008,"UGH.  This cheesecake factory will forever tarnish the squeaky clean image of other cheesecake factories for me. It wasn't the service that was appalling. . .it was their food.  As always, their service is accommodating, swift, and professional.  However, it was seriously the food that was atrocious. For one, I ordered the iced green tea which was beyond pepperminty, I felt like I was inhaling pure peppermint essence.  And if ya'll know (I know the ladies know this) but peppermint is known to suppress the appetite. . .but boy did it do more than that.  I totally lost it. Those of you that know me. . .(and none of you don't) know that I eat A LOT.  I can totally out-eat my friend. . .and he has a healthy appetite.  I can literally eat ALL the bread they give you, plus my entree and maybe squeeze in some dessert. . .but after the gross iced tea, I sat there pouting, waiting for redemption to come. It never did. I ordered the miso salmon (lunch portion) on a bed of spinach instead of rice.  What I love about Cheesecake is that they love to accommodate you, and will substitute almost anything for you.  Instead, what I got was this watery mess. . .it was like they forgot to drain my spinach or something.  On top of THAT, my miso was more of a sauce than its usual paste.  It's like they just took a hose and watered down my meal. . .it was tasteless and SOGGY and totally gross.  Needless to say, after two bites, I was done with it.  It totally ruined my appetite for the ENTIRE day (okay fine, so I was attacking my bf's pantry a few hours later.. .but STILL, I would've polished that baby off!!!) I was so disappointed, even shopping couldn't cheer me up. . .and spending money ALWAYS cheers me up =( (BTW my friend got the ranch house burger and LOVED it.  In addition to pieces of steak, it comes with a giant meat patty, bacon, onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and fries.)"
Ann B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",15,31,1,3.0,26/11/2007,"After last night's dinner, I absolutely felt compelled to write a review...in large part, due to the poor service by waitress, V. I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our party consisted of nine people, so the 18% gratuity tip is a given but she certainly did not deserve it. -we requested for more of that sweetened honey bread, but she did not bring it to us. never once did she look over to our table. we had to wait until we received our main courses to put in another request to another server. -some of our water mugs were completely empty. she was refilling customers at other tables. if it weren't for one of us grabbing her attention, she would've walked the other way without giving us refills. -additionally, we had to request for a dessert menu. what is the cheesecake factory if they don't offer you cheesecake? -lastly, when she separated our checks, one of my friends bill showed  more than a 90% tip. Granted, mistakes happen, but this just shows how she overlooked us and provided incredibly poor service. Her positives... -she did gather a group of coworkers to present the birthday sundae and sing to my friend -she was right with her recommendation to my friend who questioned which dish would be more filling for him. Food-wise...I was pleased. My friend and I shared the ""Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic."" We are girls, and the amount was just right for the two of us. It is my new favorite dish at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with ""Bow-Tie Pasta, Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomato, Pancetta, Peas and Carmelized Onions in a Roasted Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce. "" We also tried the ""Lemon Raspberry Cream Cheesecake"" for the first time. It is lighter cheesecake, but it tasted very much like a lemon-flavored starburst.  In the past... -Louisiana Chicken Pasta (The chicken is the best part. It has a nicely breaded, crispy crust. The pasta, on the other hand, was lacking in the flavor department.) -Crispy Spicy Beef (The breaded, crispy beef is very good as well. The only thing is that it is not good as leftovers. I really like that this dish comes with vegetables; however, it can be overpowered because it is completely dowsed with the teriyaki-like sauce. I have had hit and misses with the rice; one time it was very dry and not completely cooked.) -Fried Macaroni and Cheese (ball of breaded mac and cheese that is very rich and creamy. It is served with marinara sauce. It is only good immediately after being served. Otherwise, it starts getting cold and doesn't taste good anymore) -Fried Calamari (Decent, nothing great. A bit oily as well) My recommended cheesecakes -Fresh Strawberry -Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake -Chocolate Tuxedo Cream -Fresh Banana Cream My borderline Cheesecakes -Tiramisu (good if you really like coffee) -Godiva Chocolate (very very...VERY rich) -Lemon Raspberry Cream (very fruity) -White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle (okay, but not to my liking) Last night was more of a miss on service; however, we did get seated within 5-10 minutes (we arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night). It was just unfortunate with the waitress we had because I have had better, and sometimes even really good, service from this restaurant before."
David L.,"Cypress, United States",20,40,5,3.0,28/12/2010,To me it's just a typical restraurant unless you are there to eat one of there many cheesecake to choose from.
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, United States",907,873,3488,3.0,17/9/2007,"I can say pretty much the same thing about every Cheesecake Factory in the chain, so I will. 1) Long wait w/ no possibility for a reservation 2) BAD service 3) Fattening food that tastes awesome while you're in the restaurant but might give you indigestion after a few hours pass 4) Leftovers galore 5) Half cheesy (HAHAHA) half art nouveau decor which works in my opinion but I can see how it might not for everyone Some notes about this particular location: This one is pretty average. One thing to note is lack of available parking during dinner time. I drove around for 10 minutes looking for a spot and was beaten by many desperate cars driving the wrong way for the element of surprise."
Charlene N.,"Huntington Beach, United States",5,6,9,3.0,15/12/2010,"This location has got to be the hardest place to find parking unless you want to walk a mile! The service is not so great either. But I totally recommend the Red Velvet Cheescake versus any other cheesecake on the list! It's soo smooth, yummy and not too sweet! I can eat it everyday!"
Terri B.,"Orange County, United States",28,348,525,2.0,13/7/2010,"Have never been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but when the husband offers dinner out on a Saturday night and I don't have to cook, I'm good to go. He was in the mood for Cheesecake Factory, so off we go.  They do have an extensive menu, surprisingly I'm not starving so decide to try one of the small pizza's. They have a new pizza on the menu, pear, blue cheese and pecan, sounds different so I go for it. The pizza was actually delicious and I would go again just to have this one dish. The pear was perfectly cooked, the pecans added a nice crunch and the blue cheese was mellow adding a nice, simple flavor to the pizza. I would go back just to have this dish. My husband ordered the small mushroom pizza and it was delicious as well. Neither pizza was dripping in greasy cheese and I love that. We ordered edamame to start and with the pizza it was the perfect light dinner. We experienced no wait about 7:15 p.m. on a Saturday night, and the service was very good, friendly and quick. So all in all it was all good."
Edele O.,"Tustin, United States",87,49,110,4.0,14/8/2010,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! This location in the Bella Terra Plaza gets pretty busy so a normal seat wait time of 10-15 minutes is normal during peak dinner hours. Food here is up to par with Cheesecake Factory standars (which is good). Nice big menu, helps to make sure they'll have something that you're looking for each visit. The best part of course are the different kinds of cheesecakes! The seasonal peppermint cheesecake is AWESOME! (only served during the Christmas season)."
charissa s.,"Lakewood, United States",20,12,,5.0,24/11/2010,"Love this place.. excellent service, food  ambiance.  not much left to say,.. this place is great."
D A.,"Los Angeles, United States",0,40,,4.0,22/3/2013,"This is a really nice restaurant.  My favorite things here are the bread they bring at the beginning, their raspberry smoothie, and the chicken picata."
Carolyn C.,"Garden Grove, United States",545,659,418,3.0,8/5/2009,"i love how theres virtually no wait for lunch. and that the lunch menu goes until 5pm! we got there around 11:10 and they opened only 10minutes before and there were already maybe 20 people inside eatting away. bf got the salmon lunch and i got the pasta carbonara cuz stupid Dee H. got it in vegas from grand luxe and i cant get OVER IT! the server asked if we wanted bread..of COURSE i love their breads. but it was meh today i didnt even have one whole piece. blah which is good! shouldnt be eattin all those carbs + the pasta ANYWAYS! the salmon was dinky with the biggest greenest broccoli you can find. my pasta was good. much bettter the bucca. it had yummy pea's, and i asked for some chicken in it. only finished half though because it was extremely heavy. both came out to a total of 24$ not tooo bad!"
Brenda A.,"Summerville, United States",5,244,1,3.0,24/3/2014,"What's not to like, huge menu, solid food, clean restaurant and huge portions. Went for lunch on a Saturday. Potstickers were fresh and light. The wrapper was thin and the sauce was perfect, not too heavy or salty. The fried mac and cheese balls were tasty but could be sexier. Like put an adult cheese in them.. gouda or something. Good but not great.  For lunch I had the gumbo. Not bad at all for a non-southern restaurant but I ordered it without shrimp and the waitress totally blew this. As a matter of fact, she blew the whole meal. I asked her what was ""New Orleans Sauce"" per the menu which was used in the description of a pasta dish.. Her answer was.. ""it sauce in New Orleans"" to which I asked her if it was anything like ""Long Beach sauce"". She is probably still trying to figure that one out. She failed! She should know basic menu items. And she blew the shrimp order. My guest ordered chicken tenders - called Cajun Bites but there was no spice to them at all. If you drop the spice, change the name!!   The Chris' Outrageous cheesecake along with the carrot cake was a hit at home. A solid player that isn't cheap but a good girls' lunch date. A  better waiter would have helped."
Khanh T.,"Westminster, United States",12,127,94,3.0,27/6/2007,"I've never been one for desserts here (I like my arteries unclogged, thank you), but they do look mighty tasty. I don't go here too often, but I can say that I love their boneless wings, and their pasta. I like the way their pasta is slightly undercooked (I'm serious btw), but they could definitely be more generous with the pasta sauce :( The mojito here is superb. SUPERB. I've never tasted a better mojito in my life. The mint julep is ok. Their martinis are unremarkable and overpriced."
Alex N.,"Orange, United States",148,117,,1.0,19/7/2007,"the name says it all. Cheesecake... thats the only thing that is good here. the Food are horrid. and the ""wine selection"" are lack-luster.. waste of money"
Alvin N.,"Fountain Valley, United States",407,52,10,4.0,4/8/2009,"I came here with my girlfriend for valentines. Wait was super long, but had a really relaxing time at the bar. The service was slow, probably due to the special occasion and its understandable. I ordered the Rib-eye medium rare with mash potatoes and vegetables. I really loved the steak,  it tasted even better, because I waited in line so long and starved because of it. Mash potatoes were the best!"
