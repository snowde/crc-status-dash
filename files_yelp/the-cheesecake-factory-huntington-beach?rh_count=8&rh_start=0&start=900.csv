Mark C.,"Monterey Park, United States",2,352,,3.0,21/4/2012,I always liked the factory till now. Our family goes to these types of restaurants for birthdays all the time. Most of the time bad experiences with the food when you go with a large group. Thought it would be better here. Not really at all. Sort of like any other crowded popular fast food place.  Place like spaghettini might be much better but of course expensive. Probably won't be back at all.  Not my type of food onion ring are made with spongy shrimp kind of batter.
Mike F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, United States",0,6,,1.0,31/12/2012,"We visited this location last week.  It was our third or fourth visit and it is always the same.  Each time I think I'll give them one more shot at making it better, but it just doesn't happen.  In summary, the food is decent, but the service and the attitude of the employees (including the manager ""Joe"") seems to be, with rare exception, very poor. First let me say that we drive a long way to get there, as we come from Long Beach, and have our family with us making a party of five.  We HATE to wait, so we always try to make a reservation.  While they supposedly do make reservations, their reservation system, if you can call it that, is of absolutely no benefit to their patrons.  The reason is that they only appear to allow reservations when they do not expect to be busy and you would therefore not need a reservation anyway.  Examples?  We wanted a reservation for lunch on the afternoon of Christmas eve.  When I called, I was told that they were only allowing lunch reservations before 11:30 AM  or after 3:15 PM.  I specifically asked the hostess if she meant they were already full between those times or if they simply were not allowing reservations between those times.  She very clearly stated they were not allowing reservations then because they expected to be full with lunch walk-ins.  We made a reservation for five at 3:30 PM, and when we got there the place was no more than half full.  The same situation occurred when I called to try to make a 1:30 PM lunch reservation this morning (12/31).  I was told that they were only allowing reservations for 11:00 AM, which is the time they open.  Why would anyone need a reservation for the time they open... of course they would have tables open at that time. To be fair, I also spoke to the manager ""Joe"" about this issue.  I was told that they expected to be busy and didn't want to be holding tables for 5-10 minutes for the reservations of people who might be late.  I suggested that they simply not hold the table, but rather simply put late arrivals at the top of their waiting list when they did arrive.  He said that would be unfair to those people who had actually been waiting.  I asked if he could explain this, as I saw no logic to this view since if the reservation party had shown up on time the people waiting on the list would still be delayed by the same amount of time until a table opened up.  This seemed to stump him, as there was a long pause before he finally stated that this was simply their policy.  I then asked why they would not allow ""call ahead"" seating, as nearly every other major chain allows, where you could call ahead to be put on the same waiting list you would be on if you walked in and put your name on the list.  I explained that I felt that such a policy was far more respectful of their patrons' time, because a person could call ahead, get an estimate of how long the wait was at that time, get put on the list, and plan to be at the restaurant by the end of the expected wait time, thus eliminating most or all of their wait.  He said he felt this would also be unfair to the people who had walked in an put their name on the list.  When I asked how, he had no specific response.  I explained that many other restaurants, including Claim Jumper, Mimi's Cafe, Outback Steakhouse, Chili's, On The Border, and some Olive Gardens, to name just a few, allowed call ahead seating because they were respectful of their custoimers' time.  Of course, his position was completely unchanged. If not for the fact that my girlfriend likes this place, I would NEVER patronize any Cheesecake Factory (and try to avoid them, if at all possible) due to the generally poor service and their very poor customer service perspectives, despite a decent variety and decent quality of food.  I believe there is no logical explanation for their reservation policy (or the lack of an intelligent one) except that they (1) simply want people to wait in the bar and buy alcohol, thus contributing to upping their sales of alcohol, or (2) simply don't care about the value of time to their customers.  I specifically asked ""Joe"" for any other logical explanation and didn't get one.  As far as I'm concerned, I only want to give my money to retailers who value me, my guests, our time, and our business.  Cheesecake Factory is clearly NOT one of those retailers!"
Heather H.,"Los Angeles, United States",106,209,24,5.0,27/7/2006,"ok...seriously...they have the best chicken i've ever had. this is taken directly off their website (which was taken directly off of their menu): CHICKEN MADEIRA  Our Most Popular Chicken Dish!  Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted  Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce.   Served with Mashed Potatoes a...maz...ing... their godiva cheesecake is to die for, and everything in between on their menu is phenomenal.  their margaritas are great, the wine is superb, and the waiters are awesome.   this is a brand new location, which opened in july 2006, and my friends and i were counting down the days until this baby opened.  it's worth the wait--no matter what the wait may be.  promise."
Christina R.,"Garden Grove, United States",11,23,5,4.0,7/5/2008,Fabulous food AND loooong wait! They dont take reservations which makes it an even longer wait.  Great place to eat dinner.
Porya H.,"Orange County, United States",39,103,115,4.0,19/2/2010,"We met up with an old friend for dinner and this was a cental location for both of us.I love the ambiance here and I haven't been to a cheesecake factory for years. So we actually ended up doing more talking then eating which was perfect for the outdoor patio (which it was actually nice outside! since its been so cold lately) The food portions are usually big so we opted for a appetizers and drinks which were both good. Our waitress wasnt pushy although there was a long line behind us of people waiting, we got there right before the dinner rush."
Mariah S.,"Fountain Valley, United States",1,43,1,1.0,7/8/2013,"I absolutely love cheesecake factory. But my last experience there completely ruined it for me, and I may never go back. The last time I ordered cheesecake factory for pick up. When I called to place my order I was placed on hold for literally 22 minutes. My call was never picked up so I hung up and called back. This time my order was taken right away. My food item in particular had some substitutions to it due to MAJOR allergies. When I go in to pick up the food, two out of the three items that were ordered were wrong. I kindly asked them to remake them. One was just completely wrong, and the other one (mine of course) had cheese on it which I am so allergic to. The people at the bakery were rude about remaking the orders even due to health reasons. Finally when I got the orders remade and returned to me I left. When I was home and eating my pasta, I found a chunk of beef in it (the pasta didn't even have beef in it to begin with) but once again I am allergic to it. I had to stop eating my entire pasta and throw it away. If I had not noticed the beef in my pasta and ate it I could have been hospitalized (yes that serious). Everything about my visit was horrible from the customer service to the food service itself. Ill be happy to make my business else where."
Adam B.,"Boston, United States",9,47,9,4.0,22/7/2007,"A few things to say...be prepared to wait if it's dinner time.  This place is always packed...which says something about a restaurant in a place where there are DOZENS of other good restaurants right in the same block. They have good service, the waiters are all ready to reccommend their favorites if you're stuck choosing from their ginormous menu. The portions are huge, always take half home.  Their appetizer bread is very tasty as well. I don't like cheesecake so I couldn't tell you about their desserts.  I hear they're good. The ""Would I go again?"" report: I've been about 25 times, to 5 or 6 different Cheesecake Factories, and I've never been dissatisfied (except by the wait...2.5 hours in Burlington, MA?  Are you kidding me?)"
Ariane P.,"Huntington Beach, United States",7,17,,4.0,13/4/2010,"Well it's at Bella Terra...so it gets busy...especially when you decide to come on a saturday night with your friends. The wait was about 35 minutes, the atmosphere is pleasant but it seems like their lighting is too dim and it was really bothering my eyes haha. I think the food is pretty good, but I've only gotten salads and they were really fresh tasting with lots of different veggies and the dressings were unique! Since I'm such a carb-lover, I love any place that gives you free bread, so that's pretty much one of my favorite things about this restaurant ;D The service was good, our waiter was friendly and everything, the prices were okay, but the dessert #$%$@*! It's like I'm in heaven whenever I consume their strawberry shortcake, which I also like to call ""perfection."" My friends just had to mention it was my birthday too, so 3 waiters came over and sang ""happy birthday"" to me in a very monotone ""I wish I wasnt here, this is embarrassing, I hate my life"" type of sound. Oh well, I really like The Cheesecake Factory, and obviously if you come to a place with a dessert title in their name, then you HAVE to try their desserts!"
fran d.,"Long Beach, United States",456,513,66,3.0,5/11/2008,"i love cheescake factory desserts but that's about as far as the love for cheesecake factory extends to. i have visited this place more times than i care to admit. all on account of the movie theater nearby of course and not my love for visiting this establishment. granted, the place looks sharp. there is an outside area with heater lamps and the seats inside are very plush and comfortable. however the wait times are horrific and you can't help but feel like hungry cattle waiting for your turn to feed and for what? sure the menu selection is quite ample and so is the drink menu, but the food is just marginal and unexceptional. the place is clean but the service? well, i will cut the staff some slack by saying that you can only do so well with so much people that come eat at this establishment. so there is that to consider in the rating. in conclusion, this place gets only three stars because cheesecake this good deserves at least that many."
Calee A.,"Chatsworth, United States",321,155,36,4.0,17/10/2009,"I always love going to restaurants who serve bread. Especially when their bread is BOMB (their brown molasses bread, mmmm)! Their Chicken Madeira is my favorite dish here so far. They say it's their most popular chicken dish which consists of sauteed chicken breast with asparagus and cheese on top served with mashed potatoes and mushroom sauce. SO DELICIOUS. I've tried other things here like the orange chicken..I don't even know WHY I ordered orange chicken at an expensive restaurant like this (when I could've gone to Panda or something); I guess b/c my pregnancy cravings were kicking in & I wanted Chinese food so bad & I had no other choice because it was my best friend's birthday...it wasn't horrible. :) I also enjoy their parmesan crusted chicken. There are a few other dishes I'd love to try here, but it's pretty pricey. It's good to come here once in a while, for special occasions. The service at this location, during my experience, was really good. Our waitress was very sweet & on point. Is that red velvet cheesecake I see in those pictures? That's it, I'm going there tomorrow. *evil laugh*"
Edward L.,"Los Angeles, United States",450,67,1,4.0,2/8/2007,"I normally avoid this chain of establishments due to the torrid waiting times.  Went here for a lunch meeting and didn't have to wait at all. Lunch time is actually like a complete different animal without stressed out waiters, hostesses all burnt out like bad toast, and a did I forget to mention the long wait? Food is very decent - had a salad and the waitress followed my instructions completely with a smile. Go to this place for lunch - In someone's face after will you not feel like giving a smashing punch."
Matin E.,"Huntington Beach, United States",6,18,3,1.0,13/11/2007,"Well well well....what can I say that hasn't yet been repeated? I came in with a group of 7 other friends on a Tuesday night, pleased to see that the restaurant was about half empty, and confident that we'd be seated rather quickly. Boy, was I wrong! If I were to summarize my experience in one word, that one word would be SLOW! After vowing to my friends that I would leave after the 25 minute wait mark, the time came and went so I headed towards the door, but not before explaining to the absent minded employee at the front desk that they should have told us it would take this long at the beginning of our wait. A few friends resisted my move, pointed to the empty tables and seated themselves, so I begrudgingly relented in consideration to the others that really wanted to stay.  The food itself wasn't anything to write home about. I ordered the fish & chips, which basically tasted like mushy cardboard heavily seasoned with salt. I went through about 4 mugs of water, and an additional 4 when I got home. At the end of the night, the meal left a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. For a better experience, visit the Cheesecake in Fashion Island. The management at this location really needs to get its act together, I hope Cheesecake Corporate is listening."
Epi I.,"West Sacramento, United States",3,391,1,3.0,14/1/2010,"I've been to this CF at Bella Terra and while it's a very nicely decorated restaurant, the staff could be a bit friendlier.  I've been here several times and it's because this CF is not too far from where I live.  The waiters/waitresses could spend some time severing their customers.  This last time I visited CF w/a friend of mine and they seated me in this cramped 2-chair hardly-a-booth.  I asked to be moved to a regular booth.  Then my friend and I placed our order but before we asked if the salad we were ordering would be enough for 2 people given that some salads are way too much food for one person, let alone two people.  Well, the waitress said the salad I was asking about was ENOUGH for 2 people.  When we got the salad, it was hardly enough for one person.  So, there I felt the waitress didn't advice us right.  When I asked about this she sort-of argued with me.  Plus the annoying thing is that someone else other than the waitress brings your food.  So, basically when they bring you the food, that person doesn't know who ordered what.  I'm not sure why the waitress doesn't bring the food.  After all, she is the one who will be looking for a tip, right?  I ordered on the side red pepper flakes.  Well, I saw the waitress write it down but the pepper was never brought to me.  I had to flag the waitress down.  I gave this experience 3 stars but only because the cheesecake I ordered right after the dinner, was to die for GOOD!  It was the carrot-cake cheesecake.   I think this particular CF is popular because it's in the middle of HB and Westminster plus it's next to Barnes & Noble and near the 405/Beach Blvd. IF A MANGAGER WENT AROUND AND MADE SURE CUSTOMERS WERE SATISFIED WITH THEIR MEAL, I THINK THIS PLACE COULD BE THE BEST RESTAURANT IN HB."
Under P.,"Borrego Springs, United States",7,48,1,2.0,19/1/2008,Way to crowded and service sucks.  Overhyped because of it's name at this location.   You are better off driving to Newport and getting better service with shorter wait times.   Food tastes the same like all other Cheesecake Factories.  One cool thing this place has over Newport is the Drive up service.  Call your order in and they bring it out to the car for you....
Lisa W.,"Los Angeles, United States",8,13,1,4.0,24/2/2012,Most of the food here is really good.  I really like the bar area and the staff is always friendly. I use to come only for the cheese cake and some drinks but starting to really like their food as well.
Quy N.,"Garden Grove, United States",214,41,20,3.0,15/9/2009,"There are fancier cheesecake factory.  The cheesecake is good.  The salad is ok.  Everything else, you could get a better deal at Claim Jumpers.   Good service."
Danny N.,"Anaheim, United States",24,20,8,1.0,27/6/2009,"My fiance and I were hungry tonight and we have not been out to a restaurant in awhile and decided that a Hibachi Steak and Rib Eye would be delicious. We arrived and waited about 20 minutes for our table. This was around 6pm. We were seated and looked through our menu and decided to pick out an appetizer. We waited patiently for 10-15 minutes and did not see a waiter come to help us. The table next to us had a server and was getting salads and bread. I believe that I had arrived before our neighbors. We decided to give it another minute or two but to our dismay, no one came to take our orders. We decided to leave and eat at a nearby restaurant in place of this one. This has been a very unpleasant experience and I do not foresee Cheesecake Factory being a future dining experience in the near future."
Ed L.,"Orange County, United States",0,44,,4.0,27/12/2011,i enjoy the generous servings as well as the varied menu. the value is definitely there as well. my eye twitches when i hear strawberry cheesecake though...
B D.,"La Puente, United States",107,18,7,4.0,27/6/2011,"steaks aren't too impressive, i'd order fish next time."
steve B.,"Huntington Beach, United States",104,180,2,4.0,18/5/2008,We love this Cheesecake Factory - the service is quick (if you sit at the bar). The bartenders are always friendly and attentive and you cant beat the food / portions.
