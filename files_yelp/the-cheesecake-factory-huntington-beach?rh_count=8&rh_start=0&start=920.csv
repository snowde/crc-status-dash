Todd S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,4,1,3.0,5/10/2013,"good food, better cheesecake, a little over prices for farmed out food, like a fancy chillies . Service OK"
Puka B.,"Long Beach, United States",5,47,,5.0,20/6/2011,"Perfect! My wife and I went there for our Anniversary and everything was perfect! The food was delicious and our waiter Dylan was Awesome! He was extremely attentive and even brought us a cheesecake with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate    YUM! I have always said that a waiter/waitress will determine how good or bad your experience at a restaurant can be . . he helped make ours Very Special                          Thank you Dylan enl"
Samuel L.,"Cypress, United States",0,14,1,3.0,11/6/2009,"Cheesecake factory is sometimes considered a woman's favorite place to dine.  WTF were they thinking!!!! LOL the food here is actually not half bad.  Portions are quite huge! the only bad thing that I think is that the price on few items are overpriced, not all but a few.  Other than that I'm sure you won't be disappointed, unless you go during lunch or dinner hours, which you probably will.  The WAIT IS extremely HORRIBLE.  Not only is the wait horrible but their process in choosing a name is bad as well.  I would recommend that they at least give us buzzers so we can walk next door to the barnes or starbucks.  That is why i give 3 stars, not because of the food, but the wait for the food."
Maximillian M.,"San Francisco, United States",186,2203,1,2.0,19/10/2008,"The blueberry cheesecake is pretty good, but so rich, I couldn't finish it. But maybe it's the cookie-cutter feeling, the obnoxious gentrified suburban generic vibe that nearly made me barf it all out. Okay, I'm exaggerating. Perhaps it was the two pints of Stella that washed it down. Or, perhaps I should just not ever come back here. Yeah, that's it."
Jon C.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,11,,4.0,16/8/2011,"great service with pretty tasty food.  drinks are pricey but are NOT water-downed like some other popular places (TGI Fridays, The Yard House, etc...) just go to the bar area it's 1st come 1st serve if you don't like to wait!"
Nick S.,"Corona, United States",898,345,20,3.0,9/12/2009,hmmmmmmmmm everytime i go there its kinda like they half ass everything ...they rush you..i feel like they like to get me out of there fast.  the service is ehh okay i guess.... drinks are a little watered down. the chicks are gorgeous and the food is great.   nuff said
MARJORIE T.,"Long Beach, United States",100,62,27,5.0,1/5/2008,"I LOVE CHEEESECAKE FACTORY!!!! when i first came here when they first opened, their food were not that great. but after a few more times, their service improved! and their food are yummy!!!  i cannot resist cheesecake factory. this is the closest one to long beach so yay to them! nice workers :) yummy food :) expect waits, but theres stores around, so you can window shop!!! how convenient :)"
linda l.,"Garden Grove, United States",2,40,,5.0,23/8/2008,I FUCKING LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY and if it were cheaper i would never leave. The dishes are hugeee and i can hardly finish one just sharing with someone else. i love the sundried tomato pasta. ahhh delish! the fried macaroni and cheese is so fucking delicious. but you can only finish one macaroni ball since its so rich and big. i also love the bread they give you. yum the brown bread.  kicks california pizza kitchen's bread's asss. and the cheesecake here is the best ever. all of it is good.
Bernardo E.,"Irvine, United States",0,12,,4.0,11/2/2011,"Good service, clean atmosphere, good food! Yum! You will like it."
Loren N.,"Buena Park, United States",32,15,,2.0,4/12/2010,i wasn't too impressed...the food seemed a bit over priced for what it was and the service was super slow...i might try it again sometime just to see if tonight was just an off night.
Robert M.,"Huntington Beach, United States",6,42,,5.0,20/1/2011,"I love the food here.  My favorite is the Chicken Piccatta (sp) But if you are on a diet don't eat here.  The portions are huge and so are the calories. If you have a salad, dinner, dessert and a drink, it is enough calories for two days.  When I order I know that I will be having enough for at least three meals. So plan on that.  Prices are good for the amount of food you get."
lisa n.,"Hacienda Heights, United States",121,55,97,3.0,12/2/2008,"so...what to say about the cheesecake factory here...lets start off with the good... the few times i've been here the service hasn't been too bad, though i try and avoid the main dinner times so that could be it. hehe. The servers have always been pleasant, and able to crack jokes back to me and my friends who have gone in.  Food is pretty good. I play it safe and get pasta most of the time, Evelyn's Favorite being my favorite as well. yummy spring-ish pasta =)  Pretty much you've gotta figure that it's your standard fare of pastas, pizzas burgers at prices a little bit more expensive than they are sometimes worth, but *shrug* what are you going to do.  If nothing else, stay for the main attraction, which since it's cheesecake factory, umm definately the cheesecake!!! yum!!!! faves have to be the key lime cheesecake, Dulce de leche, vanillla bean, and craig's crazy carrot. I'd love to reccomend some of the chocolate ones, however since i'm allergic...not so much =p But some of the ones that my friends like are the chocolate coconut and the godiva chocolate cheesecake. and now the not so good... since it's bella terra be prepared to possibly walk a decent distance to get wherever you're going Sometimes even the parking structure is packed.   Also, service can really be a hit or miss, especially when it starts to get busier and then your server tends to disappear.  okay. well go in and enjoy kiddies! =) hehehe"
Michelle N.,"Irvine, United States",42,135,26,4.0,2/1/2008,"I am not a huge fan of American food (as you can see by my reviews), especially chains, but this one is okay in my book! I have eaten here a few times now and I have to say that the food and service have been excellent. The place is massive and the wait will be a bit long weekend evenings, but the place is huge so you move through pretty quickly. The decor is a bit odd...a mix of Egyptian and art nouveau, but it is fun and the massive booths are comfy. My servers have always been quick and super nice, which is good when I bring along the fam. I have to say that I was surprised at how good their corn cakes (appetizers) and pizza were.  But what really got me was how tasty their fish and chips were. Almost brought a tear to my eye as I doused it with more malt vinegar...the fish was juicy and flaky, and the coating wasn't geasy and even stayed slightly crispy under my 2 cups of required vinegar required to eat it (because everyone knows that vinegar cancels out all that cholesterol, right?). I would happily go back and order it again, esp since it is cheaper than O'Malleys if you make it for the lunch special and it is a more manageable size.  Another thing I always get when I go here is their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Dear God, it is super rich, but it is super fluffy, dark chocolatey and good. What is nice is that the slice is so massive that it takes about 5 days to finish off a slice, so you get your money's worth. Ah, and I noticed parking is a huge issue with most reviews, and I can see why. If you actually attempt to park around this restaurant, be prepared to drive agressively because it is absolutely nuts around there. If you are not doing valet, then park over by Staples because it is always quiet in that area and you will need the walk after you finish eating there. So, check this place out if you are in the area and get there by 5 so you can take advantage of their lunch specials."
Ashley C.,"Huntington Beach, United States",197,92,26,5.0,29/12/2006,sometimes i get in that mood- and i crave bbq chix salad not just from anywhere... CHEESECAKE salad!!!! its soooo delicious with onion rings on top mmmm
M E.,"Los Angeles, United States",7,310,44,3.0,16/6/2007,"first of all the bruchetta no longer exisits in the appetizer section.  secondly, this particular location makes their ceasar dressing funky.... its SOOOOO SALTY/SOUR/i dunno what the hell was wrong with it... EVERYONE agreed it tasted rancid.... RANCID thats a good word for it... thirdly, theres a ""weight management section"" dang thats a harsh title... it should be called ""healthy choices"" or something else....  service was good. they took the salad back and the manager came out with his apologies which wasnt even needed... he said he tasted it and it seemed fine, IT WASNT.. i love ceasar especially when theres REAL anchovies sitting atop my bed of lettuce....  the rest of the food is aight, i just like the tirimisu and the cheesecake suggested dishes: (for most cheesecakes) *thai chicken wraps *fresh spinach salad *grilled portabella on a bun *chicken marsala *morning quesadilla (no beans) *pasta davinci *cajun jambalaya pasta *herb crusted filet of salmon *miso salmon *laua salad!!! YUMMY from the cheesecake side:  ORIGINAL    FRESH STRAWBERRY    WHITE CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY TRUFFLE   WHITE CHOCOLATE CARAMEL LATTE CHEESECAKE FRESH BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE  DULCE DE LECHE CARAMEL CHEESECAKE    TIRAMISU CHEESECAKE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE-DOUGH CHEESECAKE  SNICKERS BAR CHUNKS AND CHEESECAKE  CRAIG'S CRAZY CARROT CAKE CHEESECAKE  OREO CHEESECAKE  whats good about cheesecake is they dont mind if you give them multiple credit cards for the bill and you just tell them how much to charge on each card... the sucky thing is that they wont take reservations unless you are at least a party of 15... so if you have anything under that they ask that MOST of your party arrive before getting seated...."
Robin C.,"Long Beach, United States",13,107,,4.0,12/2/2010,"Went here last night with a friend to spend a gift card. Arrived early, maybe 5:30 and had no wait for a table, we were seated at a nice booth immediately. The waiter was terriffic-very friendly and quick. I ordered the shepherd's pie and coffee and my friend ordered a salad and tomato basil pasta with chicken. I have to say that I am a coffee snob to the highest degree and their coffee was really good for not being freshly ground and french pressed coffee. My friend's salad was big, very fresh ingredients and the vinagrette was good too. Then the main dishes arrived.  Holy crap they were huge!! Both entrees easily could be divided into 3 portions each and you would still be full. The shepherds pie was delicious. A hearty, winey, brown gravy with lots of mushrooms and the potato topping was awesome! The pasta was also really good-very flavorful and loved the feta cheese in it! Both of us took home a huge amount of food, enough for at least 2 more servings. We were too full for cheesecake, so maybe next time I will just order dessert! I am deducting 1 star for parking. The lot was packed and cars were trolling around looking for spots. We finally found one and enjoyed the walk."
Boe T.,"Seal Beach, United States",1,50,2,5.0,17/12/2011,"We went to the cheesecake factory in newport many years ago and was not impressed so we never went back.My wife received a gift card for CF from a friend so we went to the one at bella terra in HB. We were seated immediately since it was not very busy,our waiter Dylan came over promptly to take our drink order.After ordering drinks we asked Dylan what his recommendationso were for appetizers were and he gave us his suggestions for the chicken crouqettes and the shrimp stuffed peppers,both were DELICIOUS! My wife ordered the goat cheese,beet salad and I ordered the farmhouse burger,both were recommended by Dylan,again DELICIOUS!  The food was great BUT the service was even GREATER. Dylan was THE BEST server we have probably EVER had. Dylan is the perfect example of the perect server. He should open a school on how to be a waiter. Cheesecake Factory,promote Dylan to be your executive wait staff trainer and give him a big raise. We will go back."
Maureen E.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,15,,5.0,24/11/2009,"The filet mignon is slightly pricey, but not slightly anything but PERFECT! I had it on Christmas Eve last year, and then again for lunch with a friend, I treated myself and I really enjoyed!"
Ned S.,"Huntington Beach, United States",0,12,3,5.0,8/3/2010,"My favorite place to eat after a long night of work.  They are open late and their food is great.  I'm actually surprised this place isn't 4 stars yet.  But everything I've had has been great.  From Biscuits and Gravy to Chicken Madeira, to Lettuce Wraps, Hummas, and Santa Fe Salad.  It's so good.  Healthy?   No, but it's casual, affordable, and while the service is give or take sometimes, it's good more often than not.  Probably my favorite chain restaurant."
Prarie D.,"Placentia, United States",90,15,4,1.0,1/7/2008,"I made a reservation to this restaurant to celebrate my best friend's birthday.  food sucked, overpriced, I will never go back to that place again."
