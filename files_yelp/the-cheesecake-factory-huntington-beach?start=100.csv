Asma K.,"Perris, CA",3,2,,5.0,8/11/2017,I always come here and they always have great Service but today I had extraordinary service! Our waiters name was Jeff and I recommend you guys ask for him!
Steven O.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,18,1,5.0,8/19/2017,Ok as a musician i love finding a place where i can eat a great meal late night. This place closes at 12:00 pm...We all know the cheesecake here is to die for but I have to tell you the filet minion steak here is simply the best in Orange Country! They tell me most folks don't order it and order mosly pasta dishes at this restaurant but if you are like me and need a perfect steak now and again oder this baby! It's very large...thick..and juicy! It comes with mashed patatos and veggie. I ask them to add mushroom gravy to the mashed and it is yummy! Also start with a cup of potato soup...to die for when you dip their crusty white bread in it. Of course finish off with a slice of cheescake and coffee and then you can roll out of there...The steak is about $30.00 but worth every bit of it. I have orderd this meal about 4 times now and everytimeit is consistent and delicious....
Sean K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",35,2,1,1.0,5/1/2017,"Bad bad experience here.  I don't really like to write reviews but I had to do it today. Today was my son's birthday and the tradition continues for birthday dinner and some cheesecakes at Cheesecake Factory. We were greeted by a very cocky server and he stayed that way for the entire meal.  I don't know what we did wrong except maybe for the fact that we were Asian?  I just felt He was prejudiced because he seemed better at the other tables. Me, my wife, my 14yr son and 12yr son all felt the same about his attitude so it had to be him right?  And we don't normally complain about bad services but today we left this establishment with a very sour feeling.   And yeah my son didn't want any cheesecakes for dessert either.  He asked if he can get dessert somewhere else and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. Will never comeback to this establishment again.  Even the food seemed very off today too.  How can it be godd when you have a sour mouth. Thanks for ruining my son's birthday GABRIEL V(the server's name on the receipt)"
Theresa N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",801,298,665,1.0,4/10/2016,The server was the worst! He was super slow with attending to our tables. To make it worst he killed the birthday surprise. I brought a cake to surprise my sister and the front desk said they would notice our server. Towards the end of dinner the server comes out and says who's birthday is we can't find your cake. Thanks for killing the surprises (: I hate you server
Jennifer H.,"Tustin, CA",81,140,103,1.0,12/24/2016,"Absolutely abysmal host. We waited in line for 40 minutes and when we were called they told us to wait on the side, which we did. After waiting another twenty minutes they had forgot about us all together and then proceeded to seat another group. The most aggravating part was when we told the host we had been waiting on the side as instructed, they thought we were lying. The manager was talking the host and said, ""oh, they weren't lying."" Excuse me? We waited for over 50 minutes for a table and then were accused about lying. We never received an apology and i am so disappointed by the manager who did nothing to remedy the situation, and then proceeded to give the table to a group who came after us. I get it. You are busy, but there is a such thing as being wrong."
Kini M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",19,90,152,3.0,10/21/2016,"I  come here once in a while but every time I come I'm not happy with the food.  Only thing that I enjoy here is the firecracker salmon appetizer and probably cheesecake one in a while. I've had ribeye last night, I asked for medium rare,  it came medium well, 27 bucks waste of $.  Service, ok she was nice but took my beer away before i was done. Anyway,  things like that happens when I eat here and it's not often that I come."
Trisha B.,"Irvine, CA",541,110,130,4.0,10/13/2016,"Came here on a Saturday night to have a double date with our friends. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table for four. The downside here is that they don't take reservations on a weekend night so you have to physically come in to put your name down. Every time I come, there is always a wait. I am a total bread and butter lover so the best part about this restaurant is that they bring you this to start off with while looking at the menu! The brown bread that they serve is so good! I think it's rye bread but I call it ""chocolate bread"" because that's what it looks like hahah. The servers are always nice about it when I ask for more:) I love the pastas here! I ordered the pasta da vinci dish which was delicious. If you love mushrooms, this is the plate to choose! It comes with a mushroom wine sauce. My friend ordered the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. It comes with bow tied pastas topped with a white sauce and sun-dried tomatoes. This was heavy but really good!  Since this Cheesecake is located inside of Bella Terra, parking can be tough. Try the parking structure if you can't find close parking!"
Joe I.,"Costa Mesa, CA",14,78,61,4.0,3/10/2017,"We sat outside, food a little slower than inside but still a great spot to eat. Had the bam bam Chicken and shrimp."
Crystal S.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",52,22,3,5.0,8/1/2017,"The food is always fresh, delicious, and put together with such a nice presentation. I have always had great service too! I love The Cheesecake Factory so much, I'd eat here everyday if I could lol. I would recommend it to anyone!"
Mike N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",6,26,20,5.0,7/15/2017,"I love this place even though it's a chain restaurant. I only come for the chicken tenders, pasta da vinci, and the chipotle chicken pasta. I always order ranch with the bread, if you don't do this...GO kill yo self."
Angel B.,"Anaheim, CA",1935,1244,4434,3.0,5/9/2015,"Yelp Challenge 2015  71/365 Located in the Bella Terra off Beach Blvd just south of the 405 in a very busy shopping center. Parking close will never happen, unless its your lucky day! So, save yourself the trouble and park far away and walk. I have been eating at Cheesecake factories in So Cal well before any Social media existed. I have been to this location in Huntington Beach  multiple times to celebrate Birthdays and just because type of meals for parties of 2-4 people. It has always been a go to place since its such a crowd pleaser. Buuuuuuuuut  each visit here in HB has always been a different experience. Some good, some not so good. A few times our order was mutilated, forgotten, or completely jacked up. Some visits our service were spot on and a perfect experience. I have eaten inside, outside and at the bar. In my opinion the bar is the fastest and easiest place to eat.  Today I felt service was decent, but rushed.  Service has never been consistent here,  which is why the 3 stars. Good servive to me, makes it or breaks it.  Service is really hit or miss depending on the time. The wait is anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. After placing your name, take the buzzer and wait. They seem to want to seat you, and quickly get your order in and send you on your way. I understand, they are busy and need to move the show along to serve people in a timely matter, but I ALWAYS feel rushed here. Helllllllooo....their menu is like a novel. I do require more than 5 minutes to know what I want.  Food is great here. I gravitate towards their salads that are way to big, burgers, Philly and the cashew chicken. All of them are great. Especially paired with the loaf bread they bring out. They have something for everyone here. I mean everyone from Carnivores to Vegetarians, that takes them on a trip around the world with their diverse cuisine. Their menu is endless. They even have skinny portions, just in case your counting calories. If your not counting calories their desert menu is amazing, offering any kind of cheesecake, some chocolate cake, ice cream, ect.  Drink wise, refillable Coke products, iced teas, strawberry lemonade are all perfect to wash down a delicious meal. If your into wine and bear they have that too. There is also Expresso drinks, which I am not a fan of. They are not as strong as I like them. Lunch for 4 was about $100. Luckily, Daddy BigBucks usually pays for us, especially since we were celebrating my Birthday today!!! 3 star service....4 star food. Review #573"
Ron P.,"Buena Park, CA",27,33,8,5.0,10/27/2016,We had a an amazing Birthday Dinner for my daughter tonight. We were in a hurry. We got seated quickly  and was Blessed with a great server Christina Z. I let her know that we had a time that we had to leave by and she was very prompt at taking all nine of our orders and getting us served. we even had time for desert. Being in the customer service industry for over 28 years I like to give recognition when service is great. :) Thanks again to all the staff and especially Christina Z. :)
Jay K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,,3.0,7/31/2017,"Great food, lousy service- always. Stopped today for happy hour. Arrived at 3:53PM. Our server appeared at 3:57 and told us that happy hour started at 5 PM. Wrong, the menu clearly states 4-6 PM. After clearing that up with Gabriel, he would not take our order as it was before 4PM. Finally returned 10 minutes later.  Typical lousy, non-caring service.  We keep coming back because the food is delicious. Avocado egg rolls, Vietnamese spring rolls, buffalo blasts. Sure wish they had a better draft beer selection.  Lastly, they play FAKE news, CNN in the bar."
Tyler T.,"San Francisco, CA",361,840,1871,2.0,6/28/2015,"This place is located in the Bella Terra shopping area, right next to Barnes and Noble. I've always found the food here to be not that good though. I had the Carbonara with Chicken, and it wasn't really all that good. The dish was kind of salty, the pasta didn't have a very pleasant texture to it, the peas were rather mushy and felt kind of like they came from a can or frozen, and the overall flavor was kind of bland. The service was also rather slow, and our waiter seemed like he was stretch too thin between too many tables."
Elizabeth H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,60,55,2.0,3/7/2016,My daughter & her boyfriend took me to this location to celebrate my birthday. Our server was not good. She kept telling us she's waiting for the bread to be ready. It was 30 minutes before we got our bread. I had the crab cakes which were burnt. My daughter found a piece of rubber band in her cilantro rice. The server told us she would alert someone. That meal was not comped but should've been. On our way out I spoke to the Manager who apologized by saying 'rubber bands are on our produce'. That's not okay. They shouldn't be in our food. The cheesecakes we ordered took a really long time as well. Our server told us they were backed up but the restaurant was empty.  It was a terrible experience. I've eaten at other locations & never had a problem. This was just a terrible experience.
Hannah M.,"Garden Grove, CA",3,11,15,1.0,9/22/2017,"I love this place, but this location is not the greatest. My man and I love Cheesecake Factory, but every server we have had the past year has literally been the worst. On our last visit, Waited 45 minute just to get our bill back is unacceptable. When your server doesn't come by for refills, or to check how your food is, is just not great customer service either.  I had to ask some bus boy to bring more refills, and to bring the bill back to us, since it was already 45 minutes past since we finished our food, waiting for the bill. Another time, our waiter didn't check up on us, was in the worst mood possible, and also, when we said we didn't want our food boxed, he brought us someone else's food from a different table all boxed up! literally I think this has ruined my experiences with this place, and that's sad because it's always been one of my favorites."
Enjoli P.,"Tustin, CA",32,18,10,5.0,6/3/2017,"This 5 star review is specifically for our amazing server Scott. Came in today for lunch with my husband and our 10 month old daughter. Scott was so friendly and thoughtful. He brought out a finger food plate of bananas and bread for her and was very attentive to what we needed. Great service with a great attitude, knowledgeable and friendly. We've been to different Cheesecake Factories across the state and this has been our best experience. The food is always delicious but service can change your whole outlook and so this is why I'm giving this particular place such a high review. This time has stood out and always will."
Amy L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,21,,5.0,6/13/2017,"Absolutely amazing! I got a pina colada, it was large & delicious! In addition, i got the chicken bellagio. It was a large meal, and the best food I've ever received at any Cheesecake Factory. (I usually stick to a burger). Lol my boyfriend got a classic mojito, it was average size and yummy! He got a large pasta plate, it looked good and he said he loved it! It was all well worth it. In addition, we got one slice of cheesecake. It was the raspberry , lemon flavor. It was the best! 2 meals, 2 alcoholic drinks, and 1 slice of cheesecake was $72 + a tip. So it was a bit pricey, but definitely worth it for a date night. The lights were dimmed , with a small candle on our table. The atmosphere was romantic, and relaxing .. but this place can get extremely busy! I highly recommend dining here."
Will C.,"Garden Grove, CA",188,190,114,5.0,11/1/2016,"After calling it seemed that we would have a long wait for only two diners on Christmas Eve.  They only reservations for larger parties.  But when we arrived at 5 pm, We were only waiting about five minutes and got a middle booth away from the windows.  Corey was quick to take our drink orders and they arrived perfectly and in good time for us to toast Merry Christmas to all! Rachel then took our salad and main course order an the food arrived much faster than expected.  It was great all around, especially in a large restaurant like this chain, close to the holidays.  We ordered more than we could eat, and had a togo box prepared.  Only thing we missed was the dessert, which if you skip enough times, you can make it to 50 without getting fat, which we both did! Well recommended, we will return."
Tom R.,"Long Beach, CA",32,39,,1.0,7/8/2017,We goto this place all the time on sundays at the bar.  We both got terribly ill after eating here yesterday.  The food was horrid and looked thrown together it's gone down hill this location the last few months not sure if new mgr if so they should be fired it used to be great now it stinks and the food is potentially making you sick and looks horrid when comes to the table do yourself a favor drive farther to Fashion Island or go elsewhere I'm still to my stomach today ugh.
