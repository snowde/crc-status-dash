Vivian N.,"Ventura, CA",475,495,1734,3.0,4/7/2015,"I'm not really sure why it's always so crowded at a cheesecake factory because I think the food is pretty mediocre. However, our roommate gave us one of those free cheesecake coupon and we got ourselves a little piece of banana crème cheesecake and a slice of joy to go with that (hah!) Would I go to cheesecake factory otherwise? Probably not."

Nicholas R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",246,10,4,4.0,3/22/2017,Took the kids for food after the movies Christian was our server and he was awesome. The wontons on the mango salad were amazing fettuccini with broccoli was good too. Would definitely go back and with a 20 page menu there's a lot to try
Jennifer C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",15,34,1,1.0,8/13/2016,"I previously gave Cheesecake Factory the full five stars. But! I am reprising my previous review and rating after the excessively poor service we've received in our last three interactions with them. Tonight was the final straw. We called in for curbside To Go. Waited on hold for 10 minutes before Rachel got back on the line. She was confused and rude in her tone and service. We did not complain. She took the order, she was communicated to that we were paying by gift card, she was confused. My husband asked how long the process would take. She relaid approximately 25 minutes.  My husband drove to the restaurant within the timeframe, parked and called the curbside number. The hostess cut him off and put him on hold for 10 minutes. She got on the line finally then disregarded what he was saying and transferred him to make an order. He called back. He was placed on hold again. When the gal answered she asked him to drive around and come back. EXCUSE ME? My husband got a manager. In total it took staff about 45 minutes at curbside PLUS the 25 minutes when the order was placed to hand the food, now COLD, to my husband. Add another 10 minutes to figure out billing, surprise we paid by gift card - like they were not told multiple times. Needless to say, this is our last visit to the Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach. The staff and customer service is a sorry joke. We spend roughly $200 easy when we go. Fail Factory."
Mary L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,9,,1.0,10/6/2017,Horrible. Had ordered drinks and had finished food long before they arrived an hour at least. They continuously said they would check on them and disappeared. One waitress was nice and said it was slammed but shouldnt be that long and went to check..disapeared the other FINALLY said she would check came back after we ate and said she stood at rhe bar for 15 waiting.....BS ...it wasnt that packed...then took another while just to get our damn check.

Tonia B.,"Anaheim, CA",386,15,,2.0,2/1/2017,"I, normally, never write Yelp reviews, but the service I received today was inadequate enough for me to take the time to share my experience.  First off, I have work experience in the food industry. Therefore, I have an understanding of what it is like to deal with complicated customers or even just trying to get through a tedious shift on a bad day. I have been to this location recently in December and received the same subpar service but not enough to the point of publication. The repeat of a bad experience, regardless of whoever served me, had already set a mood.  My party of four was seated quickly. Alexandria, our waiter, promptly addressed the menu and was attentive to us from the very beginning, until we were waiting fifteen minutes for her to put in our order. She was stationed in an area that had about five distinct parties of three or less; therefore, a small wait was understandable. However, what we did not appreciate was the fact that we were waiting while she was chatting with another coworker at the register. It was not until I flagged her down as she was, again, passing her booth, that we finally put in our orders. She was very nice about accommodating to our orders, giving us advice about customizing our entrees, and suggesting me a dish that fit my preferences that was not my initial choice. So, we waited and noticed that the food was taking a while to come out. Thirty minutes had passed and the first dish came out. Just one. Normally, when only one dish comes out, other dishes follow right after, but we were left waiting another 10-15 minutes for two more dishes. At this point, we were agitated because we were hungry, like all humans. What was interesting was that another server came by to tell us that the last dish had been sitting on the counter for some time and got cold; therefore, they had to toss it up again for it to be warm. The very first dish had to be taken back to warm up as well. My dish was not the dish I had originally decided on with her upon ordering. The last dish was the only dish that did not have complications to it. When we received our bill, one dish was charged as a dinner entree when we had all said lunch sized portions. Though it could have been a misunderstanding, I thought it was a bit peculiar that one person out of a party of four who came during lunch special hours would order a dinner entree. I think she should have clarified our orders before giving them to the kitchen for the sake of that mistake.  Alexandria addressed our problems professionally and still maintained a level head despite the tension and frustration that came with the miscommunication. Mistakes are okay; they are what makes us human. However, when mistakes are being repeated and unattended to, they become problems and that was the case here.  Please consider being more organized or stationing employees better throughout the vicinity to ensure that each customer gets the undivided attention that comes with having exemplary customer service."
JEWELS Z.,"Placentia, CA",94,12,,3.0,6/15/2017,"I had been looking forward to the teriyaki chicken, as it is a favorite of mine, from their menu. As usual, it was very good, except for the bananas, which had been seasoned with pepper. However, my friend ordered the four cheese pasta,  which took too long to be brought out, and was surprisingly salty. We informed Rachel,  our server,  when she came to clear the plates, and she saw that more than half portion was still left, and her response was ""oh, no"", not can I get you something else, or something to that effect. I was really disappointed, and for that reason I only left her a $5 tip, despite being a very generous tipper. It's a shame their customers are not valued, to try to keep them happy. I will NOT be visiting this location any time soon, for sure."
Derrick B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",27,210,46,5.0,8/30/2016,Wonderful service. Great food selection and it's quality is consistent. I love going for brunch because it's less busy and the coffee is great. We make this a normal Saturday thing.
Ly L.,"Irvine, CA",34,83,699,3.0,6/13/2015,"When you have a group that everyone sorta want different things or perhaps you just not sure what to eat, this is the place to go.  Their menu is a book.  I come here and there, but I haven't really find a dish that wow me yet, although all dishes are good to enjoy.    Have a sweet tooth?  Can't go wrong with a glossary of cheesecakes and dessert."
Remus M.,"Orange County, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/23/2016,"Cheesecake was really the only good thing. Everything everything else really wasn't good, especially not for the price. Fettuccine Alfredo was disgustingly swimming in its sauce which just wasn't very good. The kind you get in a jar or frozen tasted better than that thing.  Fish in fish and chips was rubbery and the coating completely flavorless. Not really worth it for any food. Just dessert."
Delia J.,"Long Beach, CA",166,10,4,1.0,2/4/2017,"Worst. Experience. Ever. I came here with my husband and his cousin for her birthday. We waited approximately 30 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated we waited an additional 20 minutes before the waiter even acknowledged us. We had to get the hostess to bring us water. I'm usually not one to make a scene my husband however was starving and pissed off at this point. We asked to see the manager and it took another 15 minutes to see him. Mind you, we didn't even have our drink order in yet. He came out, didn't even apologize, had an ""I don't care"" attitude, took our order which was another 30 minutes! This was outrageous! We were there a total of 2+ hours with mediocre food and unbelievably horrible service. Leaving with a bad taste in our mouth is the understatement of the year!"
Omar B.,"Garden Grove, CA",140,43,10,2.0,5/10/2017,"Had a bad experience at this location tonight. First issue was the wait time, was told 10-15 which turned into 35 minutes. Second issue was the food, my wife's pasta was hard and undercooked. My pasta was so raw that it was crumpled together, I couldn't even break it apart with my fork. I showed the manager and picked it up with my fingers and it stayed as straight as my straw. It was spaghetti by the way. The bright spot was that the waiter was good, he gave us great service all around. But what pissed me off the most was when the bill came, the manager had the decency to tell me that he hooked me up by taking away my plate from the bill. I took 3 bites out of my plate before I asked you to remove it without replacing it. He didn't hook me up, he did his job!!!! Let's not get that mixed up."
Maila H.,"Orange County, CA",397,368,4584,4.0,12/28/2014,"After a day of shopping at Bella Terra, we decided to finish the day off by going to Cheesecake Factory. I've been to the one in Brea and Anaheim but this was a first for the Huntington Beach location. Last weekend of 2014, we expected the wait to be longer than usual. Went inside to give the hostess our name and was given a wait time of 30 min. Not to bad after seeing the amount of people waiting inside. The computer system had just crashed so it was a bit chaotic. Hostesses and management walking around like chickens with their heads cutoff was entertaining to watch while we waited for our seats. After waiting 20 minutes, our names were called and we were seated in the patio. Large patio area seating with fountains, heat lamps and decor lighting. Beautiful sunny California weather and people watching with the only downfall, the restaurant is located right next to the freeway. I inhaled more carbon monoxide than fresh air. Sometimes you can't have it all. FOOD- The Cheesecake Factory has one of the most extensive menus and is not only limited to Cheesecakes.  - Small plates - Snacks - Appetizers - Salads - Pizza - Hamburgers - Sandwhiches - Pastas - Steaks, Chops, Fish & Seafood - Specialties - Sunday brunch With so many different entrees, it made choosing difficult. Luckily, I wasnt hungry so I took my time ordering. I even passed up on the free breadsticks. I decided to order the Bang Bang chicken with shrimp and babes choose the Rib eye steak with steamed broccoli. Bang Bang chicken with shrimp was a spicy Thai dish with curry, peanuts, chili and coconut served over brown rice. The perfect definiton of DELICIOUS! I love me some Thai but this by far takes the crown for best Thai curry dish. Ironically, I wasn't even dining at a Thai restaurant. I sampled the rib eye cooked to medium. It wasn't the best presentation but the flavor and tenderness made up for it.  DESSERT- Finished the meal off with Pineapple upside down cheesecake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It wasnt my first choice as they had ran out of the seasonal Pumpkin cheesecake with pecans. Sad. The cheesecake was a little too sweet and the combination of upside cake and cheesecake was a bit off. Next time I'll stick with the red velvet or the carrot cheesecakes. Can never go wrong with those two choices. SERVICE- Our waiter was friendly and provided us with good service. The only bad thing I could say is when I asked him what was good on the menu, his reply would be "" everything "". Even when it came to Cheesecakes he said "" everything was good "". Suggestions would have been helpful, although I probably wouldn't have taken them. Other than that, no complaints. PARKING-  Cheesecake Factory valet parking $5.00 and general parking is free. Finding close parking is always a hit or miss, but there plenty available parking spread across the shopping center and restaurants. OVERALL EXPERIENCE- Not the biggest fan of restaurant chains, but Cheesecake Factory is an exception. Great menu, delicious food and decent prices. The Cheesecake... well some flavors are to die for! 4 Stars"
David M.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,10,,5.0,6/23/2017,"Cheesecake is amazing! Service is always great the servers all of them never have any complains. We usually sit in the patio if not in the bar top and all the bartenders making drinks really good. Our food always comes out to perfection, always go over there sundays after work"
G O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/30/2017,Hands down the worst service from rude waitress and the worst Chinese Chicken Salad ever.  I have been coming here for years too.
Becky A.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/1/2017,"Decided to use my giftcard finally and order take out. What a disappointment. First, i called in and was placed on hold to place my order for 12 min. After placing my order i was told it would be ready curbside in 20min. I arrived and called again and waited another 10min. Someone came out and collected my gift card. About 5 min later they came back.out to tell me there was an issue with their system and i would need to pay cash or wait. I did not have cash so i waited.  20min later the issue was still not resolved so i had to leave the gift card number and a credit card...just in case. I arrived home to cold food and burnt mushroom. I will not be back."
Mary A.,"Westminster, CA",747,438,889,5.0,1/14/2015,"The service at Cheesecake Factory is awesome.  I've been here a couple of times now and I'm always impressed by the level of attention we get from our waiter (came before the rush hour of lunch and during lunch).  The food size is enormous and most of the time, I take half or more home.   The Cheesecake Factory has a huge selection of food from chicken, seafood, pasta, steak.  If you're on a diet, they even have a skinny menu that have lean meats and small portion size and calories.  Quality wise, they always meet my expectations and I leave stuffed everytime I go.  I enjoy their jambalaya and gumbo platters. Place is usually pretty busy but the wait to get a table isn't too long.  The only gripe I have is the price of cheesecake.  $7 - $8 a slice is pretty expensive but it's so yummy!  Also why do they have advertisements on their menus? I guess it's extra income to them but they're probably only a handful of restaurants that do this.  I never read the ads though :X"
Kerry B.,"Tustin, CA",158,38,2,2.0,3/5/2017,Went here on a first date not too long ago and now I remember why I never eat here by choice.  The menu is so large you can't even get through it and it is all just mediocre made dishes.  She food portions are so large to try to make up for the lack of quality in their food.  This location is in Bella terra so the patio is close to the parking lot so there are cars passing by as well as the noise from the freeway not too far away.   Plus side is the service was great and the regular coffee was surprising good.
Iggy I.,"Midway City, CA",548,175,795,4.0,2/16/2016,"Nice food nice presentation. The manager Chris walked up and inform us our meal is about one minute away - never had that experience before so really gook service. Servers are all nice as well. One cheesecake slice is 1K calories - would be cool if there was a ""low calorie"" cheesecake option."
