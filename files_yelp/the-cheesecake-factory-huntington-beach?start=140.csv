Janet G.,"Upland, CA",10,9,13,5.0,2/27/2016,"I've had my fare share of great tasting gumbo when in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The shrimp and chicken gumbo combo is amazing!!!!!!!!  Shrimp, Chicken, Andouille Sausage, Tomatoes, Peppers, Onions and Garlic Simmered in a Spicy Cajun Style Broth with Cream. Topped with Steamed White Rice. I could just drown my bowl in Spicy Cajun Style Broth. Too much rice for my liking and it seems to soak up the soupy delight. I'll voice for the rice on the side or light on the rice next time. However, feel free to overflow my bowl with the broth filing. There's just enough chicken and shrimp to every bite. If you ask it to be a bit more spicy, it will be done! As for the temperature they never disappoint!!! How is it that all factors fit like a glove!!!?? The serving size falls in par with the cost $17.  With or without gift card, I come here for only the gumbo! Not even the complimentary bread does that to my soul."
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,5.0,12/16/2014,"Absolutely Amazing!! Service was fantastic. There was a little bit of a wait, about 10 minutes, but it did not bother us since this gave us time to preview the glass case filled with tempting cheesecakes. Each more decadent than the one before, it seemed. Once seated, we were immediately greeted by our waiter, and drinks were on their way. We decided to go with just a salad the first trip since we wanted the cheesecake. The salad was amazing. I had the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad and my friend has the smaller appetizer salad Factory Chopped Salad. Both were delicious and nothing was left shortly thereafter. Drinks were continuously being filled, but without that overbearing feeling of someone not in your party constantly at your table. (That is just a little creepy at times.) Desserts were, naturally, a couple of slices of cheesecake. The first night we went, we had a slice of Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake and a slice of Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Unbelievable. We had thought we had gone on to heaven. The second visit we decided to skip the salad and go straight to the desserts, so as to skip that feeling of someone rolling us out the door. We had a slice of Hershey's Chocolate Bar Cheesecake and a slice of Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake, This was unfathomable that these cheesecakes tasted better than the first trip. We just couldn't believe it. The pricing is a bit steep, and that would be my only negative if I had to give a negative point, but I believe for an amazing night out with great service, wonderful atmosphere, and amazing food, the price is worth it. We will be back soon."
James E.,"Irvine, CA",6,32,7,1.0,1/29/2017,"We came in for brunch, the hostess was quite pleasant but from there we did not have the greatest experience. 1. The waitress had a how dare you ask me for anything mentality. 2. The food took quite a while even though we ordered almost immediately after sitting. 3. My omelette sounded like it would be great... the farmhouse omelette but after waiting 27 minutes for the food to come out it was cold... but with 2 little kids I can't wait for them to fix it. 4. Only asking for the check did our waitress move quickly.  Not a great experience."
Heidi N.,"Long Beach, CA",6,31,,3.0,10/25/2016,"I wish I could write separate reviews for service and value. The service was 5 stars, by far.  We ordered a large pickup for lunch, and the woman who took the order was prompt, accurate, and very helpful, even thought she was slammed.  Here's where my disappointment lies:  The Firecracker salmon. Was it delicious?  Absolutely.  In fact, if I could write a separate review for taste and quality, it would be 5 stars. This appetizer, however, is $12.95. I get it--salmon is expensive. I wouldn't have ordered this if I didn't understand this concept. The problem was that it came with 4  pieces that were about the length and thickness of a mini Twix.  Really. Maybe about 2oz. of salmon in the whole thing. For $12.95? Recommended as a ""shareable"" item?  No and no. No no no no. Just no, Cheesecake factory.  You have GOT to be kidding yourselves.  I don't want to pick on this location because I know that's just a company standard, but it's a terrible one.  Don't get this when you could easily spend that much on a full lunch order--even one with seafood."
Diamond N.,"Westminster, CA",370,150,110,2.0,1/5/2016,Eh it's okay. Had places that are way better and cheaper.  Food- I would give one or maybe a half star for the food. The spicy chipotle chicken pasta was eh. The pasta was hard the plate was barely warm it was just not good. The gravy for the mash potatoes were so sour. Food sucked but bread was good.  Service- Service is decent. Nothing too bad. Good servers decent wait time overall it's not bad.  Price- $14 dollars for a bowl of pasta that tasted like it should be $5? No thank you.  Nothing from this place really was good. Maybe service but it was mediocre. Good really sucked or at least what I got had sucked. Would never come back.
Sue K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,48,4.0,11/4/2016,"It's all about their salads! I love getting their entree salads. It's not cheap. However, as an entree, it's well priced. Average is $15 - $15.50. I've tried most of their salads. My favorite 2 are the Luau Salad and the Santa Fe Salad. You get a large/huge portion with meat (usually grilled chicken). They are absolutely delicious.  Their salad dressings are so good! I especially like the spicy peanut-cilantro vinaigrette which comes on the Santa Fe Salad. It has a nice kick to it.  If you ever feel like having a nice entree salad, head over to The Cheesecake Factory."
Marianna E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,16,,4.0,9/18/2017,"Love this restaurant, great food lots of varitity. I love the patio, the bar area and the dinning room. The seating is very comfortable, with  Soft light very pleasent atmosphere. They are always busy with most always a very small wait! It's worth the wait.  however the servers are way to busy, as if they are overwhelmed with to many tables. I say this because I have been going here for many years and its always the same the servers are overwhelmed , but  No matter how busy they are they have always been kind ad polite. However something always goes wrong with the orders almost every time I go there. they forget or leave out something on the order.  Most recently I went here on my birthday and my boyfriends meal was missing a extra topping he asked for. it was forgotten,  he was it  frustrated over it. Almost always something goes wrong with the orders way to often. I wonder if the servers are forced to have to many tables or the  kitchen has poor management? who knows."
Sirapop R.,"Artesia, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/9/2017,"I always order take-out via door-dash couple times weekly; this is the first time I wanted to try Arnold palmer and this is what my deliver guy says he was given--btw they charged me 2.50 for this ""Arnold palmer""."
Emily D.,"Westminster, CA",366,13,1,4.0,4/9/2017,"The service is great. They really do accommodate to you. The manager personally came out to apologize because the food was taking to long but I honestly didn't think it was that long anyway. The food here is great too. Some are whatever but most are pretty good. So overall, the service and people are fantastic and the food is pretty decent and fulfilling. Definitely a MAJOR plus for service though."
Bryan V.,"Laguna Beach, CA",337,72,114,5.0,6/28/2016,"I don't go to Cheesecake Factory often, but when I do, I always leave a satisfied guest. My last visit was probably the best experienced I had thus far. Good enough to actually make me Yelp about it.  I remember it was on a Saturday, June 18th, 2016 that my family, a party of twelve, came in to dine. I remember because it was my birthday, now you all know when my birthday is, so don't forget it! Anyways, Cheesecake Factory does not take reservations (at least for a party of twelve, they may for bigger parties), not the biggest fan of that, but none the less it is their policy, and I respect that. My girlfriend and I were the first ones to arrive and they quoted us 30 mins, that was totally fine because my family is always late anyways.  As we were waiting for the table, Chris, the manager, came and greeted us and assured us that if we need anything to please let him know and he would take care of it. From the moment I met Chris, I just picked up such a comforting and genuine vibe from him. As we were eating, there was a small hiccup with my food, and without saying anything he let me know that he issue was being taken care of and to not worry. He then let me know that the meal had been comped. Working in the restaurant industry, I've seen many management styles and felt like Chris' is outstanding. He did not need to do that but went out of his way to do so to satisfy the guest, and I loved the way he was so hands on and wasn't a back office manager. Long story short, I had a great time. I always get the Orange Chicken because of the perfect flavor, crisp and portion. Strongly recommend it! Also try the sweet corn tamales as an appetizer, you will not be disappointed. Chris, thank you again for a great experience. With you managing there, Cheesecake Factory in Huntington should be in good hands."
Evangelin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,17,7,5.0,12/19/2015,"Though I grew up close by, I never been to this restaurant. I was quickly greeted by a wonderful hostess, but I would really like to emphasize on my waitress, Laurie. She is the sweetest, most informative waitress I've had in a while. I appreciate her service and how she went over and above to make sure the appetizers, dishes, and desserts were delivered promptly. The food here was amazing. I ordered the spinach and cheese dip and had the lunch crusted chicken Parmesan, and cherry cheesecake.  Wonderful service, and again a special thank you to Laurie."
Ash P.,"Amarillo, TX",1,37,52,2.0,5/26/2017,Well my sister and I had been traveling Southern California and she swore I had to try a Cheesecake Factory since I've never been. We were both pretty disappointed. The waitress paid minimal attention to us and didn't greet us until about 10-15 minutes after we sat down. The ice water was tap I'm sure... our calamari was all breading the food came our super late and the order was wrong. We couldn't hear over the very noisy restaurant. There was a child walking up and down our aisle backwards lol.. one server almost tripped over him. We finally tabbed out and weren't offered a cheesecake so we just got a cheesecake to take back to the hotel... which happened to be extremely small compared to the displays. Not sure I'll ever visit another Cheesecake Factory even though she swears other locations are better. Nice try HBCF.
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,5.0,12/1/2014,"Again, I had another wonderful group experience here. We had a group of 12 and they were able to accommodate our party on a Saturday afternoon. We had the most attentive service and with a group so large I know that can be a challenge.  I ordered the quesadilla and the pumpkin pecan cheesecake. I loved both items and would highly recommend both. The cheesecake is only seasonal though. There was a wide variety of dishes ordered from salads to burgers to pasta and sandwiches.  Everyone loved their food and cheesecakes that they ordered. Our waitress went the extra mile and she gave everyone in the party their own separate bill without us even asking. It was really nice not to have to pass the bill around and figure everything out. We loved coming here and we'll be back again to this location soon."
Paulina A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",254,118,99,4.0,12/30/2015,Came here tonight. This place was super packed! Waited about 30 minutes for a table for two.  Boyfriend and I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta and the grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich. Both were to die for! Spices and seasonings were on point. Ambience is amazing! Perfect place for date night or if you want to take your family out for a nice dinner. Service could be better. Our waiter only brought us our food and checked up on us after we finished our meals and were ready to pay.  Tip: the tuxedo cheesecake is the best! So yummy!
Ro K.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/30/2017,Waited for over 30 minutes for our food. When it arrived it was all cold and had to be sent back. Upon return one dish was still not warm. I don't care if all the food comes out at once. Cook your damn frozen food.
Nedra M.,"Long Beach, CA",174,110,36,3.0,6/17/2016,I've been here a few times and always order the same thing. This time I tried to do something different. That did not work out. I ordered the teriyaki chicken dinner from the skinnylicious menu. This chicken is so dry. Even with the extra teriyaki sauce that we received it is still extremely dry. Never again. He had the Herb Crusted Parmesan  chicken and his plate was delicious.
Linda M.,"Westminster, CA",63,304,190,5.0,12/13/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory.  This location gets crowded since it's located in a popular shopping center.  I try to go during the down times, after lunch or before dinner.  The in between times.   There's plenty of parking since there's a parking structure within walking distance.  When it gets crowded, they'll put you on their list and it doesn't take that long for them to call you.  Maybe half an hour.   I love their bread and butter, but I always end up eating too much of it.  I always order the same dish since I love it so.  I order the farfalle (bow tie pasta) with chicken and roasted garlic.   Food is always delicious and service is always on point.  Will be back for sure!!!"
Conner L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",41,8,2,1.0,12/30/2016,"Come to the Cheesecake Factory often for the delicious food, but last night I had a terrible experience. Our waiter breeann p was terribly rude rarely came by our table we waited for our order to be taken for a half hour then she never refilled our drinks which sat on the edge of the table empty for at least a half hour. I had to ask her for bread which is supposed to be brought before you eat your dinner. She always had dirty dishes in her hand and she was hardly working and neglected our table. There was also hair in the food which ruined my appetite after my perfectly fine day was ruined by the terrible service. We will not be returning to this location because of the service id rather drive an extra half hour. Terrible service"
Heidi And Jack B.,"Long Beach, CA",63,11,2,5.0,3/31/2017,Scott is a great waiter. Food was awesome. So surprised. But just great and reasonable. I had no idea so good. Had a gift card. Thanks to my sister and brother in law!! Thanks guys! I'm just impressed!
Nancy M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",317,68,2,5.0,1/9/2017,"When you think ""Huntington Beach"" you may conjure up thoughts of eating outside and this Cheesecake Factory location has an amazing patio to enjoy outdoor dining.  With a large fountain and plenty of room, their patio seating is perfect whether you're dining alone, with friends or just need to take in the Huntington Beach outdoor atmosphere!"
