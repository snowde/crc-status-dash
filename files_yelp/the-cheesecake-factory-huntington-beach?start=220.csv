Shan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",309,303,1518,3.0,2/26/2014,"When I visit a Cheesecake Factory, I always order the same thing. So my overall experience is based on how well they cooked my Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Ok, so I arrived here with my teenage son and two little girls. As we waited to be seated, we went next door to the Barnes and Nobles. We ended up missing the signal on the remote to come be seated. But, the host graciously got us another table within minutes. Unfortunately, it was in the bar area and the seating was kind of tight.  Our waitress was nice enough. Food came out within a reasonable amount of time.  THE TEST:   my pasta was alright. It was not the best Bistro Shrimp Pasta I've tasted. On a scale from 1 -10, I'll give it a 7.  We went home with slices of oreo Cheesecake and macadamia nut cheesecake. My son really enjoyed the Oreo. I can't give you a real assessment on mine because I ate it two days later and tasted kind of ""blah"". Probably should have eaten it that night. However, the location is beautiful and the shopping center is great."
Leslie L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",33,47,26,5.0,4/27/2015,"Ok call me cheesy but I've never had a bad time at the Cheesecake Factory! It's a place I can come to where I know the food will be good and the service is always great!  Drink recommendation is the ""well mannered martini"" it's their blue cheese stuffed olive martini  I am also a sucker for the pretzel chicken too!  I mean bottom line who doesn't like this place ... Let's be real  I didn't even want to start on the cheesecake ... (Godiva Chocolate or Oreo)  I love you Cheesecake Factory I just love you :)"
Daryl D.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,12,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Went there last night and met a very rude worker. She made some very uncomfortable comments, very racist in nature. I will not be bringing any friends or family here and you should be wary of this kind of environment. Extremely unwelcoming. Her name is Kate."
IMichael B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",87,8,2,3.0,1/1/2017,"This place is busy. Should be a profitable New Year's from a business prospective. Some people should not be in customer service, however. Rude and big fibbers in some sort of time warp at the front desk. 20 minutes is actually 40 minutes. No coffee cups for tea? I guess they quit washing dishes. Geez. Pasta with Shrimp and Sausage was good and Eric the waiter was dressed rather snappy and knew what a double Windsor was. He was also very attentive. A slice of strawberry cheesecake top dinner off. Ok enough. I'm about to be in a food coma...Itus for those well informed."
Tamara B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",317,61,47,1.0,10/16/2016,Pretty disappointed that we couldn't eat here with our 8lb Yorkie on the huge outdoor patio.  They said we could tie him up on the other side of then fence. Won't come back here.
Lena H.,"Long Beach, CA",897,233,1409,4.0,1/17/2015,"Oh the good ole Cheesecake Factory.  It's a wonderful choice when you don't have particular craving or when you have too many cravings.  This past Friday night (01/16/15) my husband and I could not come to an agreement on what we wanted to eat.  He had a craving for Mexican and I have not craving at all.  I did have an anti-craving....I knew I didn't want Mexican.  So after much deliberation and whining (yes I sometimes whine all women do) my husband finally acquiesced to my Cheesecake Factory suggestion. We went around 6pm on a Friday night.....big mistake! Parking was impossible, after driving in circles for about 30min we finally found a spot (go after 8pm crowds and parking lighten up).  We then checked in and were quoted a 35-minute wait (not too bad but it was a crowed night).  We told the hostess we'd take the first available table and were subsequently seated outside.  Now I get cold in 70-degree weather and I was expecting to suffer in silence but they had over hanging heaters, which kept me nice and toasty.   We decided to start dinner with a round of libations.  My husband ordered the gin & tonic and I order the traditional Mojito.  I'm not a fan of gin but I tasted my husband's drink, it was palatable.  Though I'm sure part of the reason is because they are rather light handed with the liquor.   My mojito was nice too, not overly minty though it could have used just a bit more lemon.  I much prefer mojitos from Bar Celona in Pasadena...does that place still exist??)  But, still good flavoring and very refreshing.  We then moved on to around of appetizers.  I had the beets & goat cheese salad, and my husband went with the Ahi Tartare.  I can't really opine on the tartare because my husband mixed in some wasabi.  He put a piece on my salad plate without me noticing and thinking that it was a piece of beet I ate it.  Being that I hate wasabi and it was the only thing I could taste, I can't honestly give an opinion.  My husband liked it though.   As for the beet & goat cheese salad, I would have loved if it were a full dinner sized plate.  It was delicious!  The beets were sweet and did not have an overwhelmingly earthy taste.  They were firm but not hard and beautifully mixed in with the tanginess of the vinaigrette, which complimented the sweetness just perfectly.  The greens just like the beets were fresh, crisp and nicely tossed in the vinaigrette.  The chunks of glazed pecans and goat cheese were a nice extra but I noticed myself eating the beets and greens together separate from the cheese & nuts.  According to the menu the salad also had pieces of apples, which quite honestly I've no recollection of.  I must have been completely entranced by the beets.  For our main course my husband went with the chicken picatta and I decided to be bad and go with the Americana burger.  The picatta is one of my husband's favorite dishes and Cheesecake Factory has never disappointed, today was no exception.  It was creamy, tangy and ""capery"".  Only issue if you could call it that, was that he does not like angel hair pasta and ordered linguine instead.  He did not realize that all the creamy and saucy goodness was under the pasta....he figured it out soon enough.  The burger was good, cooked perfectly medium and tender.  The only things I did not enjoy which were the selling points; were the potato crisps and grilled onions.  Combined the potato crisps and the grilled onions overpowered all the other flavors.  I think I will stick with the regular burger next time.   To end the night no trip to the Cheesecake Factory is complete without having a piece of cheesecake of course.  I don't have a sweet tooth, have never been much a of dessert person, and am easily warded off by a lot of sugar.  So, we always stick with the ""regular"" cheesecake.  It had been years since I had a slice and goodness I'd forgotten what I was missing out on.  They seriously make the best cheesecake in the world (at least in my world).  It's cool but not cold or frozen, smooth but not runny or mushy and sweet but now drowning in sugar/sweetener.  Absolutely delicious!!! What else is left to say??? The service you ask....great as always!  I've never had any negative interactions/contacts with the servers.  In my experiences they've always been friendly and attentive, it was no different this time around."
Jeff K.,"San Clemente, CA",472,246,619,3.0,1/25/2016,"We've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and I have to say, the last couple times the HB location hasn't been up to par compared to others. LOCATION and AMBIANCE (Rating 3.75) As usual the decor and ambiance is spot on for ""Cheesecake factory. They really do a good job in that regard. It's not quiet and seating is close on long rows of table dining, but overall it's done well. We went last night (Saturday at 6pm) and I expected a wait. Surprisingly, we were seated right away (party of 4). That may speak to my report of of the food quality slipping. SERVICE (Rating 3.5) Our server last night was nice enough, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, but he seemed to have a few too many tables as his attention span was short and visits infrequent.  SPICY CASHEW CHICKEN (Rating 3) This is my ""Go-To"" over the years. It's a spicy Mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews over rice. It typically is very good, but tonight.. not so much!. Very dry and the chicken quality and taste just so-so. I was disappointed. CAROLINA BBQ PORK SANDWICH (Rating 2.5) This sandwich sounded great, and it would have been if the meat was of better quality and not so tough. It said it was ""Tender"" pulled pork (barely could bite through it as it was so dry and overcooked). The applewood smoked bacon was good along with the coleslaw and grilled bun. But without good quality meat, this sandwich served was an embarrassment for The Cheesecake Factory in my opinion."
Sophia B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2017,"This restaurant had great food. I gave this place one star since I am 13 and I wasn't allowed to order off the kids menu. I know the menu said 10 years and under, but I did not like the portion of the normal menu. My friend also lost her tooth while eating dinner, it doesn't have to do with the review but I thought it was funny."
Glenn A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,11,,4.0,9/24/2016,I come here from time to time and the wait is never to bad. The bar area is never to crowded and you can usually manage to grab a table. Good ambience
Judy H.,"West Hollywood, CA",1,30,,3.0,12/21/2016,"I just go here for their overprice cheesecake once in awhile. The food are mediocre for their price. It's just a fancy chain restaurant that's why the norms go here. Though they have good customer service and a fancy ambiance, but that's about it."
Maricela R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",21,36,67,5.0,5/10/2016,I had a great Mother's Day dinner this Sunday !! We were seated fast and then is was amazing
Ed V.,"Lakewood, CA",0,36,21,4.0,11/4/2016,"Drinks were great, and food was delicious! Highly recommend the jambalaya dish and spinach&artichoke dip, you won't regret it. This place looks and feels amazing, the ambience, patrons, and staff r legit. You feel like ur at the Bellagio or another fine restaurant in Vegas. Awesome job HB Cheesecake Factory, u guys r doing it right"
Tiffany M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",2,20,,4.0,9/2/2016,"Great food!!! They were very busy in result of food taking an hour to get to us, also they delivered our dinner to the wrong table and that table ate our food, BUT we were a large party and didn't mind the wait too much. The food and dessert tasted incredible and our waiter was very good and kind."

Erin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",1593,435,2487,4.0,12/10/2013,"Cheesecake Factory-- the best place to go if you can't decide on what you feel like eating.  Seriously, the Factory has so many choices on their menu. From pasta to sandwiches, to shepards pie to BBQ chicken pizza, to carb conscious healthy options to a California omelette; there is something for everyone. Their menu is more like a novel with at least twelve pages of food options to please everybody at the table. As if it wasn't already hard enough to make a decision on what to eat, there are also pages of advertisement in the menu. With my short attention span and the ridiculous length of the menu, our server always has to come back like three times before I know what I want to order. Yeah, I'm THAT person. Embarrassing! Just don't forget to bring your reading glasses to dinner-- the lighting is dim in the restaurant and you have some serious homework to do. Here's a list of my favs: - Huevos Rancheros: SO simple, yet my favorite breakfast option here. Crispy quesadilla, cheese, black beans, eggs and salsa is a perfect combination and they do it so well here. - Everything Pizza: Sausage, pepperoni, olives, and more on a perfectly baked crust. Nom! - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad: Healthy and delish! Seared Tuna on a delicious bed of greens. My go to salad when I want something light, yet filling.  Oh, and I should mention servings are HUGE. Sharing a salad or an entree is probably a smart idea! Plus, you know-- gotta leave room for dessert. After all, this is the Cheesecake Factory we are talking about here.  FYI: Lunch specials are also offered before 4pm. Sunday Brunch is also offered until 2pm.   I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories but this location is probably my favorite. I like the layout of the restaurant and the outside patio area, not to mention the service here is always excellent. There is also valet for a few dollars, which comes in handy as Bella Terra is always busy on the weekends and the parking structure is quite a walk away.  Cheesecake MUSTS: - Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! My absolute favorite! - Smore's Cheesecake-- so so SO decadent. Must share with at least three people or your face will fall off from the richness of this cheesecake. - Banana Cream Cheesecake! if you love the pie you will love this cheesecake.  - Red Velvet Cheesecake! This is such the perfect combination, you can't go wrong with this one.  But seriously though, how this place always gets me to order cheesecake for dessert, despite being ridiculously full is beyond me. I have no self control when it comes to cheesecake, or yummy food in general. I see myself wearing a lot of stretchy pants in the future. #noshameinmycheesecakegame"
Ana B.,"Torrance, CA",212,551,231,4.0,3/20/2015,Great location! Very close to shops and an overall beautiful location.  The wait is a little on the long side so it's a good idea to call ahead. The staff is very friendly and helpful.  When it's a bit busier it does take a bit longer to get service though.  The location is on the larger side so it can really fill up.  The food we got was well cooked and overall delicious.  The desserts are fabulous! Recommended.
Hillman P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,2,2.0,6/10/2017,The food here was not that good. The pot stickers I ordered were not fully cooked. When I talked to the Manager regarding the pot stickers she said that's how they are supposed to be.
Loc N.,"Westminster, CA",347,124,196,4.0,3/8/2015,"The food is always consistent and service is usually good. The quality of service suffers during rush hours. Wait time can average around 40 mins to get a table when busy and parking is another battle itself.  Some of the things I like on the menu are; Pasta Da vinci (the wine sauce makes this dish so delicious) Louisiana Chicken Pasta (crispy chicken bits and bowtie pasta, some spice) Cajun Jambalaya (slight spice with a good kick to it) Chicken Marsala (shares a distinct taste with the da vinci) Chicken Madeira (comes w/ mashed potatoes and is mmhhmm good) All cheesecakes (makes sense since the name is...*enter business name here*) I like cheesecake factory because they give you so many choices to pick from and for those who count the carbs they eat, there's a section for lesser calories. I usually stay away from this bit and go straight into the life threatening section."
Mariah K.,"Westminster, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/12/2017,"My boyfriend and I we're craving lasagna and turns out they don't even have it anymore. Our waitress was very very rude. Right when we sat down and received the menu she didn't even give us a minute to think about what we wanted to drink. My boyfriend was still looking at the menu when she rudely said,"" do you want me to wait here?"" When we finally ordered and got our food our waitress rarely came to our table. Instead she was talking to the people behind us about her life and how much she makes. Like really... You see us waiting and you are busy talking. We ended up waiting 20 minutes to get the check. My boyfriend got so fed up that he asked another waiter for our check. Meanwhile, another waiter came up to us and asked if we needed anything. I guess he could tell by our faces that we were pissed. We ended up not tipping. We won't be back."
