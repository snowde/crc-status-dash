Ivan Q.,"Westminster, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/28/2016,Very good service..really enjoyed their tiramisu cheesecake first time trying and really recommend it! Also recommend as entree the parmesan crusted chicken.
Bobby B.,"Laguna Beach, CA",22,9,5,1.0,10/24/2015,"Well..... The bar seems to fail once again. Every time I've been here over the last two years, the bartender(s) have been extremely difficult to pull away from their own gossip column conversations, stocking a fridge or making a drink.  As it just took 22 minutes to get anyone's attention, it was a busser, who I caught during her run to get me a plate after my food was delivered.  32 minutes to get salt and pepper...... A couple sat down next to me and after 15 minutes, I saw them still waiting patiently so I flagged down someone who could take their order....  As an FYI, there were only three people at the bar. Obviously, they were training a blind girl who was only stocking beer as a slave to the main barkeep who was stuck in the server well. As I continue to come here, I continue to expect and have horrible service.... I would love it if anyone of a mgmt position would care snout to oversee anything in this place. The couple next to me just shouted out to the back of the bartender, as they were ignored, may we please have some salt and pepper. She asks me if I need anything as she is in front of me and I reply with, ""nope, just please pay attention to others"". Albeit, I had already paid my tab, she responded with, ""there are only a few people at the bar""... Their bar service is simply and absolutely pathetic.  FYI, this review only reflects the bartenders and does not reflect the servers at individual tables. I'm giving up on coming here...."
Jessica D.,"Irvine, CA",171,217,150,3.0,12/17/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants. So I was happy when we were told our company was having our Christmas lunch here. We sat outside in the patio it was a great seating area for a large group. However when it came to the service that was another story. Our orders were called in the day before due to the large quantity of people we had in our group. What a nightmare when it came to bringing out all of our orders. There was absolutely no structure what so ever when it came to bringing out everyone's order. They were all over the place. I get that we were a large group of people, but I just feel if you know you have that many people coming to your restaurant you need to have some type of system in place. It was just pure chaos. I felt we spent more time trying to get everyone their food on the table then getting to enjoy our meal. Plus some of my co workers mentioned their soups were cold. 3 star for their patio atmosphere and their cheesecake of course. I highly recommend their Adam peanut butter cheesecake. I had their Cobb salad it was pretty good, but I definitely would not recommend this place for a large group."
Kat C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,14,,2.0,4/7/2017,The food was terrible! We ordered the shrimp bistro pasta and carne asada medallions. I don't know what's happened in the kitchen but it's not worth it to visit the HB location anymore. The only thing that was great was the server! The Cerritos location is so much better! Had built up expectations that came crashing down.
Kathy L.,"Orange County, CA",69,1139,1515,3.0,12/12/2014,"Somehow I always end up at CF for group dinners- you can't really go wrong with its extensive menu, but the food is always just A-OK to me, this last time I got the fish tacos, tempura style. Again, just okay. The tacos are crispy, while I prefer soft, and the black beans it comes with were undercooked. The tempura batter felt a little heavy and overpowered the fish. I appreciate that they have a light menu (skinnylicious) for those that are watching their weight/calorie intake. Service here was better than other locations I've been to, though."
Barbara E.,"Norwalk, CA",1,18,,5.0,10/5/2016,Got seated right away and then our waiter Sean came up to the table welcomed us and got our drinks. And then we ordered the avocado eggrolls for an appetizer which was the bomb. Then we have the chicken avocado sandwich with fresh french fries and that was bomb too:) I would definitely be back. Next time to have cheesecake was way too full.
Kimberly S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",115,85,1,3.0,10/29/2015,"Food was great, as always! We came in, it wasn't busy, two hosts.  We were asked to wait about 5-10 minutes, again, the place was practically empty.  The host said the hostess who told is to wait, would be with us shortly.  He took his sweet ass time getting back to the front desk, visiting with waiters on his way back.  The hostess returns, made us wait for the host to return.  This was on 10-28-15 at about 5pm. Our waiter was very nice & accommodating but, being a waiter he should know that you serve the entire table at the same time. Management should really look into their host/hostesses work ethic.  Glad they aren't servers."
Heather Z.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/21/2017,"The only reason for the 2 stars is the taste of the food. I'm in the restaurant business and have been for 15 years. This is my very first yelp review, that shows how disappointed I am. We come here all the time because we eat here before the movie we see at Bella Terra at least 3 times a month. We usually have Bre as our server and she is great! Tonight we had Britany and while she had a nice smile the experience was terrible. She clearly forgot to ring in our food as 30 minutes or more passed after we ordered and she never came by the table. While we were looking for someone to let them know we hadn't received our food a manager showed up. James was his name I believe. He smelled like a cigarette and while he was apologetic he didn't even know what we ordered. Once the food arrived no one came by to even quality check our food. The check was dropped and again no server for 15 minutes. Thank goodness we paid cash so we could leave to make our movie.. I will not be coming back, which is sad because we usually really enjoy it here"
Nikki P.,"Orange, CA",171,118,21,2.0,9/4/2014,"I used to love the Cheesecake Factory. What happened? Quality of good has gone way down. One of my favorite dishes did not taste the same and thanks to this experience, I will never order that dish again. The only good part about dinner was the tuxedo cheesecake for dessert.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive. That is the only reason I'm giving two stars."
Mohib Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,363,3201,1.0,3/16/2013,"I came here on a Saturday night around 9:30 p.m., and to my surprise found seating within five minutes. This was by far the most impressive part of the night.  After being seated near a noisy bar, and noisy patrons, I found myself searching for a light to read my menu. This was downright ridiculous. The lighting in the restaurant was so dim that I could not see the menu, whether it was lighting from above or the candle at the table. After about 10 minutes of using my phone's light, I selected the mushroom burger. After flagging our waitress down, we finally ordered and waited another twenty minutes for the food to arrive. I couldn't say I was impressed by the service nor the people who were sitting next to us chatting away.  The mushroom burger was decent, but not outstanding. Taste did not stick out, nor did quantity. Instead, everything was noted to be fresh and filling, but rather bland and cold. I truly was not surprised at this point.  I realize that this was a poor choice in that I came on a busy night, where personal service could not really be guaranteed. Staff are being rushed and lean, and the pressure shouldn't be on them. It's a management issue, and surely the food could have more flavor. I just wanted a nice quiet dinner, and boy did I go to the wrong place for it."
Jr W.,"Orange, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/26/2017,"On June 23rd my family & myself decided to dine at one of your restaurant chains in Huntington beach because my girlfriend had received a gift card from one of her cousins a couple weeks prior as a birthday present because her cousin knows we tend to come dine at some of your restaurant locations at least a couple times a month because my family admires the great quality of food & service we always receive but sadly this was not one of those days. We can most of the time estimate how soon our appetizers & meals would come out especially if it's a packed house or not & we can understand when it's busy. But at 9pm to 11pm is not your peak hour on busyness tonight. Waiting over an hour for a Louisiana chicken pasta, bacon cheeseburger, kids quesadilla & chicken Madeira should not take that long to prepare. After paying for the bill I went up to the hostess desk to ask to speak the manager. Finally the manager who presented himself as Joe which Nicholas (the busboy) told me that was the manager he had told that i wanted to speak to him during our meal but never came after being told twice. I proceeded to let the manager know where I was sitting in the restaurant & that I seen him talking to the table next to us informing them of what I over heard him tell them apologizing on the food taking so long & he confirmed what I heard was true & that he said that. Then I told him that i asked Nicholas that I wanted to speak to a manager & he confirmed that Nicholas told him but Joe lost track of the time & after asking Nicholas a second time that I would like to speak to the manager he acknowledged that Nicholas told him again but then Joe said he looked at our table & seen our food was finally there so he figured the problem was solved without ever coming to talk to me & ask me what I needed. I then asked Joe why he never came by our table after being asked twice by Nicholas & he told me after the first time I asked to speak to him that he went up to our waitress Jenna & asked what I wanted to speak to him about but he said Jenna told him that we were just waiting on our food & wondering when it was coming out. I asked him why he did not come the 2nd time after asking for him & he said because he seen the food finally arrive on our table so he figured the problem was solved. I then asked him how he came to that assumption of why I wanted to speak to him because I never told Jenna or Nicholas that I wanted to speak to him on what was taking so long with our meals. I told him that i never even mentioned to Jenna our waitress that I wanted to speak him & that I only told Nicholas if he can ask the manager to come over. I then asked Joe if always puts his customers on hold or just ignores there request to speak with them without even knowing what they might need help with. He than apologized acknowledging he was wrong for not coming by after being requested twice & then I asked him why the food was taking so long today & that it was unacceptable for how long it took to get our meals when the restaurant was only half full at 10pm. He tried to tell me that the food was being prepared on time & when I brought up what he said to the customers who sat next to us & were seated after us that I over heard him apologizing about there food taking a long time that he would comp them salads & give more bread while they waited for there meals, he than agreed that he said that to them & apologized to me for our meals coming out so late. After hearing your manager Joe trying to lie to me & to keep getting caught in a lie & then apologizing to me after I keep bringing up the true facts, it's very upsetting to me that you would have a manager that has no respect for your customers & upon request to speak with him twice & Joe acknowledging that there seems to be a problem with the food taking longer than expected or a unhappy customer having terrible service, that he would just ignore them than instead try to figure out the problem & make both sides happy. I really hope you look into who you have in management in the future & that they get the right training to deal with their customers & not manage like Joe did tonight to ignore, lie & be comfortable w/ your customers leaving unhappy."
Amanda T.,"Long Beach, CA",16,29,42,4.0,9/11/2014,"I don't always come to Cheesecake Factory, but when I do I come with my boyfriend and never order any cheesecake and only ALWAYS order the Factory Famous Meatloaf. :) . The first time ever having the meatloaf, it was disappointingly salty along with the gravy that went with the mashed potatoes. Being a huge fan of meatloaf, I was pretty disappointed... I came a second time and ordered the same thing hoping they had stepped up their game and they did. Not as salty anymore! So I'm pretty happy about that. I love me my meatloaf! :) .  HERE'S A SUGGESTION: you literally HAVE TO order the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes as an appetizer. It'll make you cry tears of joy. It's perfect and I swear I'll order it EVERYTIME I visit. The Tex Mex eggroll appetizers are pretty awesome too!"
Sherri G.,"Irvine, CA",324,421,1067,4.0,7/7/2013,"English hubby likes the shepherd pie. ""Quality mate!"".  I love their skinnylicious menu. I'm not a fan of cheesecake in general but I'll go for their selection of food.  I'm never disappointed.  I like this location because they have a nice patio.  It was freaking hot today and we were in direct sunlight.  They'll put umbrellas up if you ask."
Linda H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",89,55,114,3.0,1/29/2016,"They don't take reservations but got lucky and there was no wait when we got there. The food was okay. My table had the miso salmon, bbq pizza, chicken madera, and smoke house bbq burger. The service was pretty slow. My bf tried to ask for extra bbq sauce but never got it. Parking was a little hard to find too."
Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1317,1460,7211,4.0,1/2/2015,"Got a craving for a slice of cheesecake and luckily this location wasn't far away! Headed in and were seated within a minute or two. We were escorted outside onto the patio where they had the heaters on, so it was a nice place to still enjoy the outdoors without the cold sinking in. Our waiter was very nice and helped us narrow down to one cheesecake slice for us to split and a cosmo for me. Both came out really quickly and we were able to enjoy our cheesecake in all its majesty - cause, cheesecake. We opted for the 30th anniversary slice - I would definitely get it again and recommend it to people that like cheesecake of the chocolate variety.  Overall: A Could easily say ""Yay! I'm a fan."""
Rahul S.,"Long Beach, CA",4,4,,4.0,3/17/2016,"My wife and I like this place. Lunch specials are good, my favorite is wheat bread. Khus Khus and salads are good."
E L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,155,278,5.0,3/25/2015,"Good food and awesome cheesecake!  Never had a bad meal.  :)  My favorite is the Shepherd's pie.  This location can get very loud and noisy during busy hours.  The volume level tends to be a bit louder if you sit near the bar, which is to be expected.  The only negative experience I've had here is a cranky hostess who got really annoyed with me when I asked to be seated somewhere else.  Other than that, I am a repeat customer. ****UPDATE**** I returned here today for lunch and the service was terrible!  We walked in around 11:30 and didn't leave until 1:00!  This was ridiculous!  There were only 3 of us and we ordered 1 pepperoni pizza, 3 beverages, and 3 slices of cheesecake.  Terrible service.  I'm tempted to downgrade my rating to a 3 star instead of 5."
Sariah C.,"Rialto, CA",0,5,2,5.0,9/29/2016,"We came here to celebrate our first anniversary almost a week ago. It seemed very busy when we parked but we were seated right away, our server's name was Brandon and he did a wonderful job. When we needed something we didn't have to wonder where he was at, he checked in with us at the perfect times. Never came too much to where it was annoying and also never waited too long! The food was great. Bathrooms were very clean. Definitely 5 star service."
Eric L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",283,11,3,5.0,8/30/2016,"This place has always been my favorite place :) good food and drink, esecially the cheese cake"
Hale' J.,"Los Angeles, CA",624,24,7,5.0,7/24/2016,Came here for lunch and food as usual is good but its was the service of a server named Gary the was more impressive. Gary was in tip off  everything and paid super attention to detail. When I come back I'm  for sure sitting in his section cause I know for sure i will get 5 star treatment. If he treats his customers like this I  would live to see him run this location!!
