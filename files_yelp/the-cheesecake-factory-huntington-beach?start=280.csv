Tiffany T.,"Long Beach, CA",10,10,26,2.0,2/21/2015,"A friend of mine talked up The Cheesecake Factory quite a bit. She frequents the Marina Del Rey location because she lives in L.A., but I'm in Long Beach closer to Orange County so I went to the location in Huntington Beach. Maybe this is the kind of chain where the quality fluctuates depending on the location but I was not impressed with the Huntington Beach location.  The restaurant is located in an outdoor shopping mall and it was a Saturday so of course parking sucked. They do have valet available for $5 which is a reasonable price, but I was with my sister and she refuses to pay for parking so we drove around until we found a space.  We arrived at about 3pm so there was no wait. When I first walked in I immediately thought of the theme restaurants in Vegas hotels. That isn't necessarily a bad thing although I'm not sure what theme The Cheesecake Factory is going for. The decor seems like they can't decide between Egyptian, Mayan, or Mardi Gras. It was a little disconcerting. The hostess was pleasant and the booth was spacious. Our waiter, Patrick, was also very nice, but one of the spoons in my sisters set up was dirty so we had to get a new one. It's worth mentioning, at least to me, that the booth lights look like the eye of Sauron, I kid you not!! I wish I'd taken a picture. My sister and I got full course meals, appetizers, entrée, and dessert. For appetizers we got the crab cake bites and the fried mac & cheese. I enjoyed my crab cake bites and I even liked the sauce that came with it. It was a tartar sauce with a hint of mustard. It sounds weird, but it was actually tasty. My sister didn't like her fried mac & cheese. I tasted it and it was ok, but not enjoyable. They do get points for giving her four good sized mac & cheese balls that can be easily shared between two or more people.  For entrées we ordered the margarita pizza and the chicken romano. My sister didn't like that they sprinkled Parmesan on the pizza. She said it was too salty. She also said she'd never had a margarita pizza without actual tomatoes. She said the pizza was edible but not good. I tasted it and agreed with her. My chicken romano was completely underwhelming. They put too much egg in the bread crumb coating to the point where that was all you could taste. Also, I understand that good pasta should be cooked al dente but my pasta was undercooked. It was also supposed to be tossed in a light tomato sauce but the sauce was heavy and full of Parmesan. I like Parmesan but they seem to put it in EVERYTHING.  We ordered cheesecake, the fresh strawberry for my sister and the key lime for me. They drowned both slices in whipped cream which wasn't necessary. The key lime was tangy and not too sweet like it should be, but for a place named The Cheesecake Factory, I didn't feel like it was a cheesecake I couldn't get at any other bakery/resturant like Polly's or Marie Calendars. My sister also felt that they went overboard with the glaze on the strawberries.  All of this amounted to an $85 dollar check which included an $11 cocktail. I probably should have been suspicious of the cocktails when I saw that there were no prices on the cocktail menu.  Overall verdict: underwhelming and over priced! As my sister said, you're basically paying for The Cheesecake Factory name, not for quality food. I must mention that the service we received was excellent which is the only reason this location gets two stars.  Although I haven't written off The Cheesecake Factory altogether (maybe the other locations are better), I'm not going to go out of my way to visit this location and I won't recommend it to friends."
Jocelyn M.,"Westminster, CA",22,2,1,4.0,10/5/2016,Lots of food to choose from delicious and fresh. I will definitely going to tell my friends and come here more often
Maite H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",606,470,2336,4.0,12/22/2012,"What happens when a family wants to eat out and someone wants a sandwich, another is craving pasta, and the third person wants tacos?  You head to The Cheesecake Factory because their menu has something for everyone.   Our last lunch consisted of: (1)  Bistro Shrimp Pasta Battered Shrimp, Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce.  One of my fav pastas...the arugula is a nice touch! (2)  Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich Crispy Coated Chicken Breast Covered with Melted Cheese and Spicy Buffalo.  Served on a Brioche Bun with French Fries.  Sonny boy always enjoys his sandwich with extra Buffalo sauce.  (3)  Baja Chicken Tacos Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Avocado,Tomato, Onions and Cilantro. Served with Black Beans and Rice.  Hubby enjoyed his meal. We've always experienced a pleasant meal at The Cheesecake Factory...there's a wide variety of entrees, good service, and it's in HB.  I'm a fan..... 4 Stars!"
Cady L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",77,106,161,4.0,11/7/2015,"I tried their beef, it was good. The caramel cheesecake was really ""something"" but it was just too sweet that we could not finish one. Moreover, their dark bread was tasty, must try."
Ellie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,74,81,2.0,8/1/2015,"Worst service ever by our server named Breann P. so un attentive. We had a birthday girl & she didn't bothered to say anything besides ""oh"" ... Like hello we excepted at least a happy birthday if not singing but nope nothing!  Also took forever to bring our check & another 20minutes to pick it up than another 20minutes to finally check out & leave.  She was unprofessional she looked lazy & bored! If you don't like your job quit! Or if your having a bad day don't show it take the day off! She never came to check on us or asked if we needed anything ...  Love the food at cheesecake but the lack of this server makes me not want to come back here!"
Sweetaspie B.,"Lynwood, CA",60,71,12,1.0,4/4/2016,"Run Away! Not for large groups or anyone wishing to be treated with common decency!! I wish that I could give this place a negative star!!! Please see below for my review and complaint that I left on the Cheesecake Factory's website! Shame on you Rob Cowle!! On Saturday April 2nd, after about 2 months of planning, my family attended a Group movie night with about 120 of friends and family and children from our Christian congregation. My dear friend Selena P. is an event planner in the Los Angeles area who frequently organizes weddings and other events. She is absolutely professional and meticulous in everything that she does. Prior to the event she let us know that she had made arrangements for us to have dinner together after the movies at your restaurant. I personally love Cheesecake Factory and was thrilled to hear that we would all have dinner together there. Unfortunately, when our large party arrived after the movies we were told that the manager onsite ROB COWLE would not honor the arrangements that our event planner had made with CHRIS WOOD. He was extremely rude to her while she tried to explain to him the prior arrangement. He would not even allow her to speak to Chris Wood who had been so kind in previously setting up the arrangement. As our large party (over 100 patrons) waited out front she tried to reasons with Mr. Cowle to accommodate us. He refused to do so or offer any other suggestion. He did not even apologize for not honoring her reservations. Selena did everything right. She visited the restaurant earlier in the week. She even provided pictures of the space days earlier after confirming with management. I arrived early to the theater and personally witnessed her go to your restaurant to reconfirm the reservation hours before our expected arrival time. I am the last one to ever complain about racism. However, I have never seen someone treated with such blatant disrespect. I could not help but ask myself whether or not the fact that we were predominantly African-American in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood had anything to do with the way Mr. Cowle was treating us. I have never been treated so horribly in my life, especially not by an establishment based in customer service. To see my friend brought to tears broke my heart and I am appalled at the way she was spoken to and treated. I can assure you that all of the other food establishments in the Bella Terra mall were thrilled that your company turned us away because we visited about 3 other restaurants who treated us with the respect that our patronage deserved. The only color that should have mattered in this situation was green. At least human decency and an apology were owed but Mr. Cowle had none of those for us. If Cheesecake Factory is in the habit of mistreating groups of paying customers then it is no longer a place that I care to visit!! Another Cheesecake Factory has opened in Santa Monica near my job and I have already vetoed anyone from my pharmaceutical company to have lunch or dinner meetings there. I was planning to patron the new restaurant in Cerritos also but I have a bad taste in my mouth from this experience...one that not even your Cheesecake can remove. I hope that your establishment can make things right as I don't believe that you are in the business of mistreating paying customers!"
Tiffany T.,"San Francisco, CA",283,336,1286,3.0,3/30/2013,"I love the cheesecake factory. hands down. the only reason why I am giving this a 3/5 star was because of the receptionist/hostesses. I came in the restaurant for brunch, there were three workers at the front and none of them greeted my party and I. We were waiting to ask for a table and the hostesses basically eyed us to come up front. She simply asked ""how many"" no welcome to the cheesecake factory or anything. This isn't a big deal but it would have been nice to be greeted warmly into the restaurant, thats what hostesses should do, and it was also my birthday. In addition the girl who walked us to our table wasn't very warming either.  Food: Order the Avocado Eggrolls which were AMAZING. Definitely recommend this as an appetizer. We also got the salmon of the day which was in a thai glaze and the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. The salmon was nicely cooked, good flavors. The pasta though was great! Loved the fast.  Waitress: was very nice, checked on our table and provided us great service."
Irene L.,"Anaheim, CA",180,404,83,3.0,4/19/2013,I got the factory meatloaf that was $15. Came with mashed potatoes & gravy with corn succotash which is roasted corn with roasted vegetables. Pros: excellent service. Our server was very attentative but came by way too much. We just assume she cared. Cons: my meatloaf was way TOO salty. Mashed potatoes were too salty & I ate this without the gravy. Corn was salty as well. I couldn't even eat half of my food because of the amount of salt they put in. I have no idea what I'm going to do with my leftovers.
Jackiee H.,"Santa Ana, CA",221,96,68,3.0,5/26/2016,"This is usually a go to spot with my best friend because we are able to share a meal (literally) and get scrumptious cheesecake to ourselves, but there are times that I come here that I seriously reconsider do we ever want to go back? I guess it's the closest to us and the wait isn't half as bad as the one in Disneyland, but I guess I shall try to break it down to some key memories here. (I've only checked in twice, but I've come here a lot more times than that...) 1) This memory sticks out to me like a sore thumb because it's my go to story for one of my worst experiences. I ordered a steak medium rare (like always), Cheesecake Factory is fairly dim, so it's hard to see things sometimes, but when I got the steak my friend and I noted that it was more blood rare (for those of you who don't know, it's basically a piece of steak that's flashed on a grill for marks, but the inside is completely rare. This is typically only ordered from high end steak places where their quality of meat is off the charts, since this is a dangerously easy to get sick. Anyways, I ramble,) I told the server (who was terribly difficult to flag down, despite the slow day) he went to get it changed, then somehow did a 180, came back and informed my friend and I that this was in fact medium rare, I may want to reconsider ordering well done next time. Honestly, it took every fiber of my being to not throw the plate at him. I literally opened my phone and googled steak cooking temperature and had to show him what medium rare is really like. Honestly, I wasn't even mean when I asked him to cook it more, I promise.  2) Went with some friends, and the server was upbeat and so nice. This is the quality I look for and anticipate here. I forgot her name, but she made me realize this placce was still worth going to.  3) The cheesecake, every time, without fail is great."
Alex F.,"Silver Spring, MD",262,39,43,4.0,1/6/2015,"Our waiter Kyle was really awesome!!! Kristen is so fabulous as well!!!   After dealing w an annoying waiter, Dean, the manager set us up with Kyle was such fun!!! Food was yummmm and cheesecake to die for"
Lynn N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",629,202,287,3.0,9/20/2014,This place is best for their cheesecakes.  The food quality ranges from okay to pretty good.  I had the tiramisu cheesecake. T'was chocolaty and decadent. The strawberry smoothie and the samosa was good but I've had better. Haven't we all?  Parking next to the restaurant is hard. There is plenty of parking in the plaza if you don't mind walking. They do have valet.  The decor is nice. Not a bad date place but the food won't blow you away. You can try to catch the wifi from Starbucks next door.
Sanae Y.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,2,1,1.0,7/12/2014,"ordered Turkey Burger. got home and saw that patty was consistantly red all inside. I called the manager on duty 7/12 around 3 pm and he offered to prepare me another one on the house for me to pick up. I was no longer in the facility so declined but accepted to have the charge taken off my card. He said he would take care of it ""RIGHT AWAY"" but nothing yet. be aware of the grill master here Follow up 3 working days later no credit from this establishment. stop payment with my bank and mind you I called them back to ask about my credit and some ridiculous excuse about talk to the person in accounting. Why is this my responsibility and another Manager to even tell me this. This is what I call No Customer Service"
Selena P.,"Lynwood, CA",71,4,7,1.0,4/3/2016,Just so everyone knows personally I was really hurt because I have never felt the blatant discrimination I felt yesterday (Saturday 4/2/16) and I have worked with so many different people (different races) in my line of business over the years...and for this to be 2016! I don't know why but I was just shocked!*** I came down during the week on (Tuesday 3/29/16) and spoke to a really nice manager I told him that I had a 100 of my close friends coming to the movies - Superman vs Batman and afterwards we would be coming to his restaurant for dinner- his name is CHRIS WOOD he was very welcoming an had every intention to accommodate us!  When I arrived BEFORE the movie I confirmed again with CHRIS that 100 people will be coming directly after the movie and requested again the patio and he welcomed me with open arms ensuring me that he would stop seating in the patio around 7:00pm so as to get ready for our large party!  Everything went south when I arrived to see the patio still full of people and another manager by the name of ROB COWLE when he decided that he would NOT HONOR the agreement I had with Chris! He wouldn't even let me speak to him. He informed me that he made the final decision not to accomodate our group. I understand completely the policy that they don't take reservations but I came in early said I had 100 people for the patio...spoke with a manager...he verbally agreed. What else could I have done?  ROB COWLE did NOTHING to accommodate us....!!!  Rob Cowle needs to know that outright discrimation is not tolerated and hopefully the corporate office will do what they have to and get rid of people like that in their company. It was just so wrong...I will NEVER come there again!
Lydia M.,"Long Beach, CA",10,2,,1.0,4/3/2016,"I've been to my fair share of Cheesecake Factory locations over the years, and I've always had awesome experiences. But, Saturday, April 2, 2016 @ the Huntington Beach Cheesecake Factory was THE WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!!!  Rob Cowle has demonstrated the true definition of unprofessional, disrespectful, and discriminatory. After dealing with a very accommodating manger named Chris, we had the unfortunate experience of having to meet Rob Cowle, who had absolutely NO INTENTION of honoring the agreement between Manager Chris and our PAYING party of 110 guests who were ultimately, displaced by Rob Cowle's refusal to honor our guests.  The demeanor and attitude demonstrated by Mr. Cowle should be of concern to any future guests as well as Cheesecake Factory Corporate."
Missy B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",156,83,13,5.0,8/7/2016,"Oksana is wonderful!!  Ask for her when you're here.  Friendly and quick, she is a gem.  Knows the menu, and best of all---she's always smiling!!"
Jay K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,65,11,1.0,9/12/2015,"Love CCF, but today the quality control was BAD.. Ordered Buffalo Blasts and it was served with VERY old, spoiled celery. Service was good and the Vietnamese egg rolls good as well"
Linda W.,"Westminster, CA",4,63,4,2.0,12/16/2015,"Dining outside is pretty romantic! Servers are good. However, food is just okay.. Oh, Don't waste your money on the orange chicken. It had a strange smell with it and the white rice was dry..  But their original cheesecake is yum.  Tip: price for an entire cheesecake is a better deal rather than just getting one slice."
Nancy L.,"Westminster, CA",276,59,84,2.0,6/12/2014,"Where to start? Well this location is lucky that I'm even giving them a two star review. The hostess greeted us without a smile. We waited 10 minutes to order and waited 40 minutes for the food to come out. Not only that, my pasta AND my mom's pasta was undercooked that we had some crunchy pasta. Flavor wise it was good. I just ordered fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp. My shrimp was a little on the dry side which was disappointing.  I've been to this location 3 times now and 2/3 times, it has always taken this long for my food to come out."
Roxanne S.,"Hawaiian Gardens, CA",3,25,5,3.0,12/31/2015,"Came to eat with some friends. I order the mac and cheese burger. It was rather salty, but eating the avocado egg rolls made up for it. It took us 50 minutes to get our meal but it was overall a good experience."
