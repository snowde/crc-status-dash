Cindy L.,"Walnut, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Worst service ever.  Time can Not be replaced.  I value my Sundays as it is The only few hours I have to Myself.  Waste of my valuable time.  Was told my first meal would not be charged.  His name is Jacob, or Jason. Justin is what the next table remembers.  At least, honor your word.  Being cheap and greedy just lost the company a long, and loyal customer.  I had ordered 2 as I expressed to the waiter of my extreme hunger.  Does a salad look fulfilling?!  I sit another 20-30 minutes.  To my disappointment, first waiter did not put my correct order in.  Had asked for my salad to be Without dressing, which had plenty of.  She took it away, after my disapproval.  I sit for another length of time for the order I originally ordered first.  Get my bill, and am charged for both!  Ridiculous.  I normally order 2-3 items as I can Eat, along with dessert.  My average bill runs upward towards 100 each time, me alone.  I will definitely Not return.  Waste of my time.  Instead of having to pay for my bill, my precious time should have been compensated.  Service horrendous.  Negative 5 stars if I could, from both waiters, to the manager.  I actually came last week for tiramisu.  I decided then, the Italian restaurant down my block had a better, tastier version.  Thank god."

Jonathan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1189,365,366,3.0,8/3/2013,"Usually I'd expect The Cheesecake Factory to be super packed. Well my visit went along with my expectations but surprisingly, my party of 12 were seated within half an hour which was pleasant. We got our drink orders maybe 10 minutes after sitting. The bad part was that it took them 20 minutes to send over somebody to take our orders. Just because we're a big party and we're instantly charged gratuity no matter what doesn't mean they can take their sweet time to deliver subpar service.  I'd imagine a reasonable wait because any real restaurant would attempt to send over the entire table top at the same time. The only problem with that is that a member of my party actually ended up getting served the wrong food and the waitress was insistent that that was what she ordered. I didn't know vegetarians ordered some kind of chicken sandwich. My friend must have been mistaken because she looked like she definitely ordered that and was obviously confused. However, I was lucky enough to get the dish that I ordered. I had the sheppard's pie and although I had an image in my head of what it would look like (and it came out looking different from most traditional servings of it), the taste was fairly on point. Nice mashed potatoes, good amount of vegetables that weren't cooked to kingdom come, the beef wasn't anything special, but overall, comfort food done alright. Just an average experience. Nothing too special. Nothing too terrible besides the neglect of service. I honestly would dine at a different location just because I've had better experiences with service at their other branches."
Pamela Z.,"Westminster, CA",62,28,7,2.0,12/28/2015,"Really disappointed! We ate at the Cheesecake Factory yesterday and ordered sliders for the kids and fries, Jambalaya, salmon and spinach. Only thing that came to our table hot was my salmon. The sliders came with no cheese, so when I requested cheese be added they were brought back with a piece of hard cheese thrown inside and still cold, my husbands Jambalaya was just warm. My salmon was hot, but the spinach was anything but edible. Last but least we ordered the Chocolate mouse cheese cake and as the last visit, it tasted old. I should have said something but l did not. This was not the first time I have been disappointed at the Bella Terra location. Shame on me we will not be back!"
Katie S.,"Redlands, CA",180,143,211,3.0,2/27/2013,"This is harder for me to rate.  I truly enjoyed this location.   For a corporate restaurant the service was amazing.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  There were 2 different managers who did table touches throughout our meal.  Also, something that stuck out for me was we ordered deep fried mac n cheese as an appetizer.  We'd only been waiting 8 minutes or so and the manager came by our table and mentioned that our appetizer didn't look as good as he wanted it to so he asked to have a new batch prepared.  He apologized for our non existent wait and asked if he could get us anything in the mean time.  What?  Seriously?  I was pleasantly surprised.  I've worked in restaurants for the majority of my life and managers aren't always as involved as you'd like them to be.  When our appetizer did arrive it was piping hot and looked delicious.   My boyfriend's family could talk about this dish for days.  They are all big fans.  It's pretty darn successful.  Although I don't know how you can go wrong with creamy mac n cheese, a crispy breading and a pink marinara dipping sauce.  It's very rich so I barely got through one but still they are worth ordering again. As if I hadn't had enough pasta I decided on more pasta for my entree.  However this dish was loaded with asparagus, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes all tossed with really tender chicken and a chipotle cream sauce.  I don't know how it works, but it works.  I ordered a lunch portion and I still couldn't get half way through it so they are really generous.   My boyfriend had the Steak Diane which was pretty good as well  The sauce alone was really nice.  The steak was cooked so nicely, which I like to point out because corporate places get that wrong more often than not.   Everything was good, above average for sure BUT  there are still many places I would rather head back to before this.  They are A Ok in my book in a good way.  I'd go 3.5 for sure."
Whitney C.,"Long Beach, CA",126,24,1,5.0,11/5/2015,"I am falling in love with the restaurant. I didn't expect that the food was going to be so delicious  but it honestly was.  The cheesecake, there's so much to choose from. it's pretty awesome!!!"
Jeff P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,19,27,5.0,6/2/2015,Sunday brunch is awesome had monte cristo and lemon ricotta pancakes highly recommend both
Federico G.,"Tustin, CA",0,26,18,4.0,3/20/2016,"The food is always good at any of the cheesecake locations they have good consistency , today I order  the monte cristo sandwich was great!  Super tasty And good for share between 2 the service was  mediocre and lack of effort today here service 2 stars."
Cristal L.,"Long Beach, CA",1,7,4,4.0,5/2/2015,"Best waiter I have met , unfortunately I don't remember his name. Very attentive funny and got my order all right . I had the bang bang chicken and shrimp. I have to say it was delicious.  I didn't have space for dessert this time . The food was out quick . I give it 4 stars"
Cathy M.,"Anaheim, CA",280,1133,1081,4.0,12/25/2013,"Mhmn delicious! The food is definitely pricey, but they give out large portions. I definitely recommend the Fettuccine Alfredo. It's so creamy and delicious. I also tried out their nachos + spinach dip as their appetizer. The dip wasn't as cheesy as I had hoped for it to be. I wish it had a bit more flavor to it. Regardless, it was a giant appetizer for the price we paid. My favorite part was probably the dessert. Red Velvet Cheesecake is just mouthwatering. The cheesecake was rich and moist. The cream cheese just melts in your mouth and there's white chocolate shavings decorated on the end of the cake. I'd kill for another slice. Screw the calories and eat the cheesecake. You're not living if you haven't tried their red velvet cheesecake before!"
Daisy G.,"Los Alamitos, CA",93,21,15,3.0,3/5/2016,Honestly the food was not worth the money and our waitress never came back after we got our food.  The pasta was extremely bland and disappointing.  I'm not interested in trying it again. The only think worth coming back for is to order a cheese cake to go.
Mohammad A.,"Anchorage, AK",0,2,,3.0,12/23/2015,"If you like Farm Raised Salmon, they serve them proudly !! Nasty !!! But they are good for Cheese Cake."
Mindy T.,"Westminster, CA",2,3,,1.0,4/23/2016,"all the waiters and waitresses be salty af here. like I'm just tryna eat some dank ass pasta, not wait 20 for a table outside in the freezing cold fam SMH I'm done byE"
Michelle C.,"Garden Grove, CA",38,6,1,1.0,8/2/2015,"Something has changed at this location and it's definitely not good!!! I have been going here since they opened and the food was good for a while. We just went to eat here a couple nights ago and it was the worst food I have ever had here! I keep thinking maybe it's because we came early at 5 before the dinner rush but that's no excuse. The waiter was not friendly at all. The food was barely warm and did not taste good. And the cheesecake was not even good. I feel like they must have new cooks and staff. They are way overpriced and don't seem to care about the quality of the food or the waitstaff being friendly and accommodating. I got the chicken and biscuits and the biscuits were really small and burnt, the mashed potatoes were not creamy and not hot at all. The chicken was thin and salty. I had this dish a long time ago and the biscuits were huge fluffy and homemade. They looked like frozen biscuits and come on if you burn them cook more don't serve your customers burnt food when it's expensive. My husband got jambalaya and it was also barely warm. Seemed to me the dishes were left overs from lunch cooking. They didn't even try to heat up the food.  Very disappointed we will not be coming back to this location. There are other locations that are better"
Diana C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4,5,6,1.0,10/13/2015,"I dined at this location with my family last night, for the first time, for my fathers birthday. Our experience was overall good, or so I thought. While everyone ordered something different my brother and I both ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo. Everything was fine until we got home. Both of us, an hour later, start feeling bad, bloated and just overall disgusting. Next thing you know we start throwing up that pasta we both had. Extremely disappointed especially that being our first (AND LAST) time dining there. BE CAREFUL THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY UNSANITARY. Today at work all day I felt disgusting, weak and lost my appetite. My mom finally gave me some vitamins which have made me feel a lot better thank goodness. SERIOUSLY BE CAREFUL WHEN DINING HERE!!"
Caitlin A.,"Alhambra, CA",1474,814,2210,4.0,11/20/2011,"I haven't ate at The Cheesecake Factory in years.. It was back when I was still working in Newport Beach, so we would always go to the one in Fashion Island. I had a $25 giftcard so I figured, why not? The hubby and I loaded the kids and off we went. The HB location is closer to home. We didn't have to wait at all, 2pm on a Friday afternoon. Yeah, late lunch. The host mispelled my name, kept calling me Carolyn even though I kept correcting him Caitlin. Whatevs.  Our waiter was exceptional. I think his name was Dylan. He was super friendly and checked on us just enough, not too little and not a lot. Refilled our drinks without us even having to ask. Definitely on his A game.  We ordered the chicken tenders w fries (kinda dry) and mac n cheese (really gourmet, yum!) for the kids. We started with the ahi tuna tartare and endive salad. I enjoyed both a lot. For our entrees, the hubby had the SkinnyLicious turkey & avocado sandwich w a clam chowder and I had the SkinnyLicious chicken salad sandwich w a caesar (shoulda substituted w a soup instead). Both our sandwiches were meh but the soup was really flavorful. My caesar was a little overkill since we shared the endive salad already.  Overall, I'm really impressed with their new menu selections. I mean, it has been a few years since I ate here, but it's definitely improved. I'll definitely be back."
mOe J.,"Orange County, CA",8,124,51,5.0,1/24/2015,"Sean M. The bartender gave the perfect amount of service for an exceptional dining at the bar experience.  The food was amazing.  The pecan, caramel cheesecake....  ZOMYGAWD!"
Loan B.,"Orange, CA",23,68,13,2.0,10/1/2014,"Quality has gone down as what Nikki P. had said. I went here a couple of days ago for dinner. 1 star for the bread and butter (love me some of that butter) and the other star for the drinks. All three entrees had issues. The white rice in my miso salmon was quite undercooked.  It was still very hard. The steak diane (one of my favs) was overcooked. I had ordered medium rare. The medallions came out medium and therefore lost its juiciness. Mashed potato was on point -soft and buttery. Lastly, I had the garlic chicken noodle. Noodle was al dente so no issue there. However, the bf bite into the drumstick and found the chicken undercooked.  I should have taken a picture of it. The chicken inside was between red and borderline pink.  I told the waitress to please tell the chefs that the chicken was not fully cooked.  She took out plates and that was it. No acknowledgement. I don't want to get sick from the food so if you're reading this management,  please tell your cooks to check their dishes before sending them out. Very much disappointed since my previous experiences were much better."
Wxy Z.,"Denver, CO",0,55,1,5.0,1/5/2016,"I've tried Cheesecake Factories throughout the country. I've always had a consistently good meal. Their menu is the most extensive menu I've seen! If you can't find something you like, you've got a problem."
