William W.,"Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, CA",20,2,,1.0,8/20/2017,"Service here is typically mediocre, but recently it's been atrocious.  Tonight our server James had a terrible attitude, never brought us bread or straws for our drinks, walked past our check several times, didn't even look at us when dropping off our money, ignored us when we thanked him for bringing food, and was using his phone while gossiping to coworkers between stops at our table.  In addition, two visits ago my party was seated for 20 minutes and our waiter never showed up so we just left. Great service, Cheesecake Factory!"
Lu K.,"Fountain Valley, CA",58,44,845,4.0,1/8/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory restaurant is located at the Bella Terra outside mall. Excellent location with a Century Stadium theaters within two minutes of waking. The parking structure is free and shared by the mall and theater and costco.  The food is pretty consistent and well as the service. I've tried the salads, skinny menu, regular menu, cocktails, which I have to say their blue cheese stuffed martini is pretty good and big!  Oh, and the cheesecakes, what's not to like about the thirty or so choices (no, I did not count) choices!!!  This is a great place to hang in the bar with the Tv's, or go into the restaurant area as a couple, with friends or for a group or party event. Always a fun time."
Rosy P.,"Westminster, CA",174,15,5,2.0,9/8/2017,"Super disappointed during my visit today. It is my favorite restaurant yet I didn't enjoy my meal.  It was my first time trying the Korean fried cauliflower and boy it tastes delicious. We ordered the napoletana pasta and the scrimp scampi/Diane streak combo.  First bite of the meat in the pasta, it was SUPER SALTY. The sauce and the pasta are great.  The steak was also SUPER SALTY. I've asked for it to be cooked in medium, it was burnt on one side and pretty much well done. We informed the server, C, she's beautiful but responded as in she didn't care. She just said she'll spread the word and walked to a different table.  Initially this review was 3-4 stars but after the food and service we received towards the end of the night I totally lost it.  We don't need the food to be comped or given a GC we just need some acknowledgement and at least offer to redo our plates because we ARE PAYING FOR THEM! Sorry for typos or grammatical error, I'm just so disappointed."
Rosey W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",79,16,1,1.0,11/20/2017,"We just left the restaurant with our group of 20. It was a pretty awful experience overall. We had 1 server for our entire group- and the server was also covering the entire section of the restaurant. It was between 20-35 minutes for the drinks to arrive after they were ordered and we had to ask for a few of the drinks twice. Our server was extremely pleasant, but the restaurant should have been better staffed. Waiting for the food and having everything come out at different times was just as bad. We won't be coming back anytime soon- even if the cheesecake is amazing"
Mindy V.,"Rosemead, CA",667,89,39,5.0,1/30/2017,"Came here for a little date night and ordered the 4 cheese pasta with chicken and loaded tots (for appetizer). The wait was about 30 mins for 2, but definitely worth because it was a Friday night. I have to say that the service was absolutely amazing and I would recommend the strawberry lemonade because free refills!  Would come back to try more pasta options, but if you never tried the 4-cheese pasta, go check it out!"
Maria E.,"Placentia, CA",2,32,33,5.0,4/30/2017,"Hi there, Well this evening I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach , the service was  outstanding you can tell that they give ""The Plus"" to make sure the enviroment and the consumers are well taking care of , we had two waitress and they were great always with a smile on their face great attitude make that environment feel more comfortable ... this evening a I chose a dish from their low calorie intake skinnylicious menu and the dish is called ""Tuscan Chicken"" it was great, the presentation on the plate was good eye catching very colorful and of course it was delicious...  Thank you guys for always givin a great services all the time we do see your commitment to the consumers and the quality of the food from the chefs -Maria"
KyHa V.,"Westminster, CA",41,199,309,4.0,6/22/2017,"It's one of those naughty places where you know your calorie and sweets intake will be off the wall and yet, you still indulge.There was a bit of a wait during lunch hour on a Wednesday but nothing too bad. My friend and I got seated at the booth and given water promptly.  We ordered:  Chicken Fettuccin $19.95 Very rich and creamy and the server was graciously loaded my dish with parmesan cheese to the point where I couldn't see any pasta and chicken -just the way I like it. Everything Pizza Very cheesy and the crust perfectly crispy. It was loaded with pepperoni, olives, sausages, peppers, and mushroom.  Red velvet cheesecake  So decadent and unfortunately we couldn't finish it because we were so full.  This place is so deliciously calorie-ridden. There's a 'Skinnylicious' menu but really, who really looks that that."
Marwan K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",42,43,137,3.0,8/11/2017,"My girlfriend and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price We came to Cheesecake Factory at Bella Terra for my girlfriend's dad's birthday.  FOOD My girlfriend and I shared the Jambalaya and it was pretty good.  The chicken was seasons well.  My girlfriends parents had the Grilled Fresh Salmon with a side of Shrimp and the Seared Ahi Tuna with a side of shrimp.   They both enjoyed their meals especially the shrimp.  However, the sides weren't the best.  We did not have cheesecake for desert, we were full.  Overall the food was decent for what it was and although the rest of the experience was not good, we give the food 3/4 of a star.  ALCOHOL I had a Whiskey Smash and my girlfriend had a Well Mannered Martini.  My Whisky Smash was a tad sweet but over all really good.  They pour generously here so that is a plus.  The Well Mannered Martini was good and you couldn't taste the blue cheese olives in the drink.  Overall the drinks are 3/4 of a star.  CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE  The restaurant and bathroom are relatively clean for the foot traffic Cheesecake Factory has which tends to be a lot on a Saturday.  The ambiance is also a little loud for my taste but it is a chain and that is part of the experience.  Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star.  SERVICE The service was horrific.  Our waiter Nathan G did not seem like he wanted to serve the table at all.  When he did come to the table to take the orders and my girlfriend was translating what she was ordering for her parents he got annoyed because they changed their minds one time.  Also he never let us know how late the appetizer was going to be.  It eventually came out after the meals so we sent it back.  Finally he didn't come by once to ask how we were or if we wanted desert.  We have had a string of good service so we were due, but this was bad.  Overall the service deserves zero stars a complete disappointment.  VALUE/PRICE The restaurant is a good value we spent $111 on three meals and three drinks without tip.  Obviously the tip was not very good on this night.   Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star.  In conclusion the restaurant is 3.25 stars.  I really wanted to give it closer to 2 stars but it did check off the necessary boxes I suppose.  I definitely won't be back for a meal here again unless someone specifically requests it for a birthday."
Avishek C.,"Anaheim, CA",79,223,11,4.0,7/29/2017,"The atmosphere has a pleasant atmosphere. The dining area is large and the wait staff was friendly and responsive. The food here is and always has been quite on the mark. I've yet to leave TCF not liking the food. The only thing to look out for is parking is a bit difficult to find sometimes. But, if you circle in the lot for 5 minutes, you generally can find somewhere to park."
Aaron M.,"Riverside, CA",96,141,51,2.0,8/19/2017,Parking is f'ing horrible. Had to park over in the parking garage for take out. Definitely won't be back here.
Kelly N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",214,80,520,5.0,1/4/2017,"My family and I go to Cheesecake Factory at LEAST once a month! It's pricey but we always share a few items so it makes it worth it. The service is usually really great with a few exceptions (we had one horrible experience during lunch but we usually go for dinner).  Our go to items are: - Cajun Jambalaya: The best jambalaya I've had so far! So delicious. Sometimes we get rice and sauce on the side for a variety! - Pasta Da Vinci: Penne pasta with a delicious sweet sauce and chicken, onions, and mushrooms.  - Chicken Madeira: a tender piece of a chicken filet with cheese on top, mushrooms, asparagus, and a Madeira sauce. So savory and delicious! We get this with mashed potatoes.  - Shrimp Scampi: large pieces of shrimp fried to perfection with a delicious sauce. Sometimes we add pasta with it because the sauce is so good! Everything we tried here so far is great! We wanna try more but we love the food we always order so it's always a struggle to decide what to eat lol"
Teresa N.,"Cypress, CA",663,486,1100,4.0,5/19/2016,"I really like the food here! I called to try to make a reservation for Monday night... but I was told that they only took reservations for the first hour they open... Corn cake tamales: My sister recommended this, and I'm so glad she did! They were amazing. It comes with three and we split them between six people. I wish I had more, but I'm glad I didn't because the entree portions are HUGE. Passionfruit and Blueberry Mojito: Good! Refreshing. I preferred the passionfruit since the alcohol was less apparent, but both were great! Hibatchi Steak: I had this medium rare and it was cooked great! I thought that there was too much sauce, but it was still good! The sauce is on the sweeter side. Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic: Amazing! My favorite pasta here is the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta, but this ones up there as well. Portion is HUGE. Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi: My sister really liked this! Sauce in this was very different. It wasn't sweet like the one on my plate. It went really well with the steak. I didn't try any of the other dishes, but I feel like Cheesecake Factory has a lot of really delicious foods! Salted Caramel Cheesecake: Good! I wish it was a little saltier, but it definitely hit the spot. I would order this again.  Service at Cheesecake Factory is always a little slow for me... but it's not terrible. The girl who helped us found out it was my birthday and got a few coworkers to sing to me and gave me a free small ice cream with whipped cream. It was very nice."
Daimci R.,"Orange County, CA",101,84,10,1.0,5/3/2017,"I'm writing this review based off my to go experience.  This is the second time our food wasn't what it's like when were served at the restaurant.  My mother and I always get the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi.  I got four little pieces of steak and one of my shrimps was completely burnt.  Usually when we eat inside the restaurant, we get a larger portion of steak.  We love eating inside because of the quality and the ingredients are delicious.  We just don't understand why there's a huge difference with take out and dinning in. It was a waste of money.  This was yesterday 5/2 after 5ish."
James H.,"Tustin, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/3/2017,"So after the disaster of The Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas I thought I would give it another try. This time they came through with flying colors. Despite being slammed and busy my wife and I got seated in 15 mins on a Friday night in OC which anyone will tell you is no mean feat. I ordered the factory make your own omelette with bacon, ham, cheddar and Jack cheese. I thought I would order something a little different and I got fries instead of the potatoes but I ordered a side of syrup. Our waitress came through and my fries where amazing. The omelette was equally amazing. I got a piece of lemon meringue cheesecake to go. Even though we where seated next to a family of four and a large party of 12 our server Yuki never forgot us or left us hanging. As I have said before good service is always worth paying for. Thank you Yuki for making dinner awesome after a crap day."
Jennifer T.,"Westminster, CA",47,16,119,4.0,7/25/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a very affordable, high quality restaurant. Food + Service = :) INSIDE: The restaurant allows you to choose to sit inside and outside. I have sat at both during dinner hours. If you are seated outside, it is a very calm and relaxing area even if there are cars around. Not loud at all, and they put out fire stand thingys (what are the called omg??) when it gets cold. Inside, you'll sit at a table or booth. Very clean and spacious.  SERVICE: Each time I go, servers will usually leave their shift and another server will substitute in. I love how nice and informative they are when they switch off their shifts. I get to meet my new server and things go on as if it didn't happen. One thing I love about this restaurant is how it ALWAYS refills my water even if I've sipped on it twice. It's the little things that matter. During all my visits at Cheesecake Factory, I have only gotten my order wrong once. My waiter will correct it, and my replacement comes about 5-10 minutes later which is fine with me. (I had ordered the Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls, but I received some Skinnylicious salmon dish).  THE FOOD: I love the menu selection at Cheesecake Factory. It includes anything you can think of. I love their fries and will order it despite what kind of dish I'm ordering! However, I docked one star off this review because their Cuban Sandwich. This sandwich came off as very, very greasy. It tasted pretty bad, and I felt like it was something made to be microwaved and was heated with a grill instead. It was a mess eating it. I love all the pastas here, but just that sandwich makes me feel a little sick.  THE CHEESECAKE: Oh I always gain a million pounds after leaving this place anyways, so I obviously order the cheesecakes here! I am a sucker for Red Velvet Cheesecake, and I would eat all of the cheesecakes on the menu if I could in one sitting. It's classic and the price is unbeatable.  BOTTOM LINE: -Always recommended -Service and most of the food is well loved by me"
Jonathan N.,"Anaheim, CA",0,20,14,3.0,8/14/2017,"SERVICE I've been to this specific Cheesecake quite a few times with generally mediocre to excellent service (really depends on your server). There have been 2 occasions out of 5-6 where the food took over an hour to come out, and the drinks we ordered almost just as long. It would've been understandable if it were busy, but it wasn't at all. We had to follow up 3 times with our waitress before what I assumed was the manager came out to personally apologize and deliver our food.  FOOD It's Cheesecake Factory - portions are generous (sometimes), food is food, and great selection for a casual dinner. WAITING Comparing it to my go-to Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach, the lines are pretty much nonexistent.  In the end, it's a decent location but when compared with the Redondo Beach location, service doesn't compare. They have more efficient staff with (what seems like) more genuine enthusiasm for their work, which for me always leads to bigger tips and more satisfaction.  I would've given it a 5/5 if it weren't for the 2 occasions of extremely poor service and failure to make up for their error from management. It varied too much to give it any higher than a 3/5. If you're looking for great service for a group of family or friends, I'd try another restaurant. If you're looking for vast selections of food at good value with minimal wait, than this place will do just fine."
Renee G.,"Los Alamitos, CA",328,417,149,1.0,3/28/2017,They had mediocre Thai lettuce chicken wraps which is unusual and my husband's steak Diane was so chewy he could hardly eat it our. Heescake to go was good until spoon broke they gave us and I cut my gums and bleed for 20 mins.
Dan E.,"Westminster, CA",0,15,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Over priced, lousy tasting food. Soup pretty sure came from a can. Firecracker salmon whatever was terrible. Burnt, hardly any  filling on a plate full of purple cabbage. .garbage. Never again."
Jessica P.,"Irvine, CA",1,13,2,3.0,10/2/2017,I'm not sure what the deal is with take out but the quality of the food was nothing compared to when I dine in. It's irritating because I am paying the same price! Specifically I'm talking about the Thai chx lettuce wraps. I got home and they literally put 3 strips of chx and the lettuce leaves we're old and obviously the bad edges had been ripped off which is not a big deal but the pieces were so small and almost white. When I eat In I always get these HUGE green beautiful leaves and a good portion of chx. This isn't the first take out meal that was disapointing from here. I did have an amazing tiramisu cheesecake slice! That's why I am giving any stars
Tammy N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",68,1,,5.0,8/11/2017,My husband and I had dinner here tonight. Ryan C was our waiter and have to say was excellent. He checked on us the perfect amount of times and made sure we had everything we needed .  My husband wanted a scotch and didn't know the name . Ryan went and took a picture of them (the different bottles) to make sure My husband got the right one .  Great service and the food very good .
