Robby C.,"Long Beach, CA",649,8,7,5.0,9/10/2015,"Had A Party Of 20 Loud Folks from long beach and our server Kristen B was not only a fantastic server, but she handled everything with grace and sound service. She even split the checks for us before hand without even grimacing at the fact that she knew we wanted splits! 5 stars for Kristen B. My couloutte steak came out perfectly cooked. The oreo cheesecake too decadent and beautiful to eat. Will return!"
Gary F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,18,,4.0,10/13/2015,I really go only for the breakfast on Sunday. Get there early at 10am when the doors open and you can have a nice quiet meal.  Eggs benedict was very good as well as some the other dishes.  Nice strong cup of java is great also.
Sonya G.,"Long Beach, CA",3,9,8,1.0,7/24/2015,"Worst staff ever! My friend ordered dessert instead of an entrée. The waitress said she would time it in order for it to come out at the same time the rest of our food came. Literally everybody received & finished their food & her cake still wasn't ""ready"". Last time I checked, the cakes are just sitting there. All you have to do is cut a slice. The waitress claimed they had given her slice to someone else and that they needed to make another one. At this point, we involved the manager and he came out with the cake one minute later. (Why couldn't they do this before?) Next day, 4 of us who tried the cake had diarrhea. Coincidence? Maybe. Or maybe not."
John D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",19,10,2,5.0,3/9/2016,Sean the bartender was really helpful with the menu we had a great time and we will return the food was great the new low calorie menu is amazing just what me and my girlfriend were looking for
Lydia D.,"Simi Valley, CA",17,30,7,1.0,8/14/2015,"Don't go here unless you like paying tons of money for bad food and the WORST service ever. I went it a friend for lunch today and really wish we had picked somewhere else.  It took at least 15 minutes just for the server to come by to take our order, another 10 minutes to get straws, and our food didn't come out til about 30 minutes after that. By that time we had to get boxes and go because I had to go back to work. (I would understand if it were busy, but our server was slowly strolling around and talking to other servers about their dating lives and weekend plans, so I don't think he had too many tables at that point.) Not only that, but once I had the chance to open the box with the pizza in it and take a bite, I realized that the crust was so hard that I couldn't even bite through it. Now the pizza was cold which I expected, but it was hard as though it had been microwaved several times. If I had been eating this in the restaurant I would have sent it back. And it's PIZZA--how do you even mess that up??"
J C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,38,,5.0,10/7/2015,"Had lunch, the salad was fantastic, the service from Gabriel was top notch. Great experience!"
Sam E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,105,313,4.0,1/18/2015,"My two favorite dishes here are: farfalle bow tie paste & chicken lettuce wraps. The chicken lettuce wraps comes with grilled chicken, lettuce cups, and various other veggies. It's not your usual chicken lettuce wrap and I love it! It's light and flavorful and makes me feel good when I eat it. The farfalle bowtie pasta is a little heavier and it has chicken, sundried tomato, peas and bacon. 4 stars because lack of customer service"
Michael M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",27,26,3,4.0,3/12/2015,"We were seated almost immediately then served quickly, pleasantly, such a pleasure with chain restaurant!"
Ammi B.,"San Diego, CA",29,8,,5.0,1/26/2016,"I'm not a big fan of Cheesecake Factory food, but I've always loved their cheesecakes. This review is mostly in regards to the service at the Bella Terra location, because the cheesecake was, as always, very delicious. My friend and I came here last week dessert and were seated immediately. We were brought water right after we sat down, and after we ordered, the food came out fast and our waitress stopped by regularly to check on us. The table we were seated at was in the line of direct afternoon sunlight, and for some reason, they decided to raise the shades and let in more piercing light, but I'm still going to give 5 stars 'cause we loved our waitress (the gal with the chin-length red hair)-- nicest, most genuine server ever!"
Peter N.,"Pico Rivera, CA",12,24,18,4.0,7/25/2016,"Our Grandson invited his family to join in celebrating his 24th birthday. It was for a group of 12 plus toddlers and a baby they were able to accommodate us all in a joint tables. every one ordered their favorites so it was a variety of dishes that made it to the table and added to festivities by sharing some of tastesr. Our grandson enjoyed the gether and his gifts, you never outgrow the gifts. The service was great and our server Ryan was very helpful in getting the various orders together for our group. I hadn't realized the variety of food that was a available  at the Cheesecake Factory, Fish Taco Wraps,Meatloal, Bistro Pasta, Pizza and more. Beef, Poultry, Fish, Pasta and a decicious selection of desserts. That the sang Happy Birthday was an bonus! Thanks Ryan and the Cheesecake Factory in Huntingdon Beach for a great Birthday experience."
Awan B.,"Fountain Valley, CA",39,35,422,5.0,8/25/2013,"On a date with the wife. I don't no why but she loves coming here. This place was our first date we ever event on. She loves her white chicken chillie.  We come here once in a while but I am not so fond of the place. It's ok with the food and taste. To me It just taste so same stuff. I love trying different things but the wife just wanna keep it simple and old. What can I say yea people are nice and food comes out fast. I just wish web I say I want the food spicy it comes out spicy not the same taste, but its k I give a great stars bc it's my wife place."
Rose Marie A.,"Long Beach, CA",167,154,120,4.0,2/11/2013,"This review has been long over due. Been here many times before for birthdays, lunch with the ladies or happy hour with my ladies, over the years. I don't have the patience to wait for a table so I always push for a early time when we go here, so I've waited for more than 8 minutes. The menu selection caters to whatever you're in the mood for, burgers, pasta, steak, salads, breakfast is served all day. It's all good. Never been disappointed with their food...always flavorful, portions are huge even half sizes, and drinks are flowing, especially with the water and ice teas. However service seems to slow down, when are getting ready to for our check -  2 1/2 stars. But I really come here for the cheesecake! - 5 stars ...to go of course or we'll go next door to Starbucks and have coffee with our cheesecake! Parking - go to the parking structure...it's free!"
Tamara T.,"Carson, CA",36,54,49,4.0,11/21/2015,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory  We started lunch with stuffed mushrooms and calamari. Both were on point!! Very delish.....calamari wasn't hard to chew and the battered use was not too salty and had good flavors.  I had the lunch portion chicken Alfredo with angel hair pasta, this is always my go to, delicious. My brother and sister had fish and chips and meatball & spaghetti (my sister liked this, but felt it was a little too salty. We also had the pumpkin pecan cheesecake (must have for thanksgiving) red velvet cheesecake (tasted more like a red velvet cake with cheesecake frosting, but it was good).  Overall, great tasting food!!!"
B S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,48,10,2.0,8/5/2015,"After ordering our food from the great waitress we received the ""Grilled Artichoke"", it was so dry, hard, and seemed like it was a week old.  We told the waitress who apologizes and said ""I'll show this to the cook"".  She came back and said ""the manager will be stopping by to discuss the bad artichoke"", and ""you won't be charged for it.  Well, the manager never bothered to stop by and when the check came SURPRISE SURPRISE WE WERE CHARGED FOR IT!  The waitress apologized and after waiting (still no manager showed up) they removed the charge for the artichoke that could choke.  What should have happened should have been the manager coming right over to our table and not charging us for anything or at least offering us desert.  Incase anyone at Cheesecake reads this; 8/2/15 18:06 receipt ref#0802010000544.  I'll update if they contact me to rectify."
Kenny C.,"La Mirada, CA",0,11,,3.0,4/1/2015,The staff were nice and friendly. Unfortunately we waited 55 minutes for our food to arrive.  Bistro Shrimp Pasta was disappointing.
Nick A.,"Irvine, CA",0,12,,1.0,5/6/2016,"I wish I could give them no star , food was cold, very bad service, no refill, they have bad attitudes, if you like to waste time and money go there.. I use to like this restaurant, but this location suck, stay away... I'm so upset about leaving such a review but this location needs higher attention"
Katie O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",100,41,3,2.0,8/10/2015,"You get 2 stars from me because the waitress was sweet and she gave 100% customer service. However I got horrendous food poisoning from whatever I ate. I got the grilled chicken Avocado club with no mayo first, tasted bad to me so I switched to the grilled chicken cesar. In bed trying to heal as we speak. Never again coming to this place."
Andres A.,"Tehachapi, CA",63,3,3,3.0,1/28/2016,"Quick seating, sat at the bar. Long wait for drinks. When food arrived, catfish dinner was over breaded and too crunchy. More bread than fish. Pasta dish was under cooked, pasta was chewy and quite firm.  Curry dish was VERY curry, although we were warned about that so can't really complain much. Margaritas are $10/EA. Overall, its a place we go to every once in a while, and kinda learn what you like and don't like. But unfortunately it has made us picky about what we get there."
