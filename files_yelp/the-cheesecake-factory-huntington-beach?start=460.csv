Christopher L.,"Westminster, CA",17,362,,3.0,7/26/2012,"Disclaimer: I did not have the cheesecake, so this is for the food only. Once I had the chicken fettucini alfredo. I don't recommend it. The pasta felt under-cooked and the consistency of the sauce was off. The pizza was half-decent, but not worth it. Might as well go to California Pizza Kitchen across the parking lot. But the chicken madeira and herb-crusted salmon plate (served with a mound of mashed potatoes) was delicious. My friend's steak medallion was as well. So depending on what you get, the Cheesecake Factory can be either hit or miss."
Brian A.,"Fountain Valley, CA",237,3,,5.0,10/3/2015,"I had a great birthday day dinner here at the cheese cake factory. The food was great and came very quickly. We didn't have to wait or ask for anything. That's all thanks to our sever Jessica. She was great she made sure all of aloud needs were taken care of, all while having a beautiful smile on her face. She was such a good sever I'll be sure to ask for her the next time I come in."
Roberto R.,"Orange, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/3/2016,"One star is too good for the service I received, terrible communication and customer service. I placed an order for two so it wasn't a big order, said it would be ready in 20 minutes. When I arrive I was told it'll be a few more minutes, in the mean time I took care of payment. After 50 minutes and several not one or two but several people complaining about the service, I asked if my order was ready and it was sitting in the counter for about 15 minutes, with two items missing while the food is getting cold. I asked to speak to the manager while the server gets the rest of the order and manager just said ""I'm so sorry"" that was he's solution. When I got home the food was cold and I don't live too far 15 minute drive. I hope this is just a one time occurrence because I love Cheesecake Factory and I would hate to have to stop going there. I would not recommend neither will I ever order to pick up or take out from there again."
Hugh A.,"Whittier, CA",124,252,66,5.0,3/16/2014,The Five Stars come from the restaurant's willingness to put bold dishes with flavor on the menu. On the brunch menu is a selection with classic Southwest style. Their Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas is a worthwhile walk on the wild side. It's like an omelet and nachos mixed together. Roasted Poblano peppers and tomatillo-chile sauce turn up the tasty meter. If you like a little adventure on your plate give it a try.
Shannon F.,"Yorba Linda, CA",149,96,48,1.0,1/22/2015,"I placed an order for pick up about a month ago for a group of employees** at work.  First, when I called in the order, no one answered.  I called back and was put on hold for over 10 minutes.  Finally I placed the order.   I was disappointed when I arrived and there were people parked in the 'curbside delivery' spaces for Cheesecake factory but were not waiting in their cars.  After search for parking, I had to park in a neighboring restaurants 'curbside' spot which I felt incredibly guilty about.  I called the number for curbside delivery and was put on hold.  I waited 10 minutes, then hung up and called back.  They answered and I explained that I had to park in the other restaurants spot and gave my car's make and model.  They said they'd be out.  When the server arrived with the food, I had been sitting in the parking lot approximately 20 minutes.  In fact, it was 20 minutes AFTER my food was scheduled to be done according to the order.  I paid and was given my food, and I hurridly drove back to the office where I knew hungry employees were waiting.  When I got there, we discovered that the order was wrong- one of the pasta dishes was missing a main component (Shrimp!) and was plain.  My employee was disappointed but did not want to call since it had been such an ordeal.  We decided we will order from somewhere else next time. **On a side note, I have contacted their corporate regarding a food allergy and asking for guidance on what would be safe to eat, and they basically told me that their ingredients are proprietary information and they refused to help me.  So when I ordered for my employees, I was forced to order for myself at a different restaurant who was able to provide ingredients and guidance for my allergies.  Judging from both experiences, it seems Cheesecake Factory is not a service oriented business."
G G.,"Long Beach, CA",33,582,4380,4.0,3/27/2014,The food here is always great...the menu has a wide selection of items that are sure to fit everyones taste. I like the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp but last time tried their carmel fried chicken and it was awesome. The only drawback here is the staff. Most are helpful and professional...every now and then one of the waitresses may have an off day which makes an otherwise great visit suck...at least the management is quick to resolve such matters. And the cheesecake selection is insane...if nothing else take some to go.
Elaine N.,"Santa Ana, CA",304,39,277,5.0,3/6/2014,"I came with my two sisters and my 1 year old nephew, so we ordered a total of three pastas. Pastas were cooked ON POINT. Loved it! Not too pricey either. I wish I remembered our waiter's name, but she was amazing. She showed how much she loves my nephew and I appreciate that! She was patient with us and even offered bananas and soft bread for the baby! It's a tradition to take my sister in law here before she pops! But I would come here if I am craving pasta :)"
P K.,"Buena Park, CA",694,202,15,4.0,5/14/2014,"This place already has a billion reviews so you guys probably don't need a run down on this place. Couple of the best dishes: The Shrimp Scampi and the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo They make a pretty mean Strawberry Lemonade, perfect for a hot day! I usually stick with the original cheesecake with strawberry."
Christine N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,15,4,4.0,1/2/2015,The bread that they serve with butter is so good! I rarely ever go out to eat at such fancy expensive places but I love this restaurant. The cheesecake is also
Brenda P.,"Garden Grove, CA",1083,416,482,4.0,2/18/2015,"Of course went with a burger here...decided to try the Bacon Bacon burger, one of their specials. The meat was pretty good. I probably should've read the details on the burger since I thought it was going to have EXTRA bacon. But its bacon and ham and I felt like the ham was not really needed. All in all it was a tasty burger but I'll go for my usual next time I come back."
Justine H.,"Santa Ana, CA",55,33,,4.0,6/19/2015,"Just had the strawberry shortcake a la mode. -It used to be my favorite dessert.  But now, they've changed the dessert- it is more like cornbread with strawberries a la mode. -still good, surprisingly, but i prefer the original recipe. I recommend the Luau salad or firecracker salmon appetizer, if you're looking for something on the light side. Those two dishes never let me down."
Tracie D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",53,88,18,4.0,12/20/2014,"Love this place!  As always the food is great and the service is always excellent.  We got the drop fried mac & cheese which was fanatic. I got the lettuce Asian tacos and my son got the chicken burger and both were really good  (the chicken burger was huge) and of course we had to get cheesecake, craig's carrot cake swirled cheesecake and it was AAAAMAZING!"
Matthew B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",194,97,52,4.0,8/3/2015,I love getting the pastas! And the cheesecake obviously! Really good and pretty good portions. A little pricy but that's how it is. The bread appetizers are always really good too.
Jocelyne R.,"Long Beach, CA",1,10,2,5.0,8/1/2014,Great service. The waitress was on point with the refills. The appetizers were really good so was my entree.  She recommended the s'mores cheesecake and it was delicious!
Pepper O.,"Westminster, CA",126,14,1,5.0,7/30/2015,Came in for lunch with a friend who wasn't able to have dairy due to the medication she was taking. She had mentioned that to our server at the beginning of our meal and then went on to order a cappuccino because she forgot that she couldn't have dairy. Thank goodness our server remembered and asked her if soy milk was okay for her cappuccino. I wish I got our servers name. She was very accommodating and saved my friend from a potential disaster.
Derrick F.,"Long Beach, CA",0,9,6,1.0,9/14/2014,"Went here for a birthday . Long wait . Horrible service ""Patrick "" took forever got orders wrong. Waited 30 mins for them to fix the birthday girls food . To much money for so little , got her birth cake wrong wow"
Erik H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,,5.0,8/12/2015,"The food here is amazing, the service is world class. I love Cheesecake Factory! The best thing on the menu is the Thai lettuce wraps followed by their cajun jambalaya. Oh and you can't forget their cheesecake! Chocolate tuxedo is a must try!"
Dana L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,92,39,3.0,4/26/2016,Olay place to eat.
George S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",31,15,35,4.0,6/16/2015,"Would be 5 if they had ""the original cheesecake""... It's all frozen and needs to be thawed... Seriously?? Service was on point and food was delicious as usual.."
Danster L.,"Orange County, CA",1683,730,2280,4.0,12/14/2009,"This location is great with my favorite, Pinkberry just nearby but the bad part about this CF is the parking. Parking here is a nightmare during peak hours but moving on... I love Cheesecake Factory and sometimes it can be a hit or miss with dishes but I generally have a great time with good food. I had ordered the chicken bellagio which is a pesto pasta with arugula and a breaded chicken breast. The pasta was angel hair which I am not a fan of but everything else was good. I capped off the night with some strawberry cheesecake. But the highlight of the night had to be the service!  Our server, I totally forgot her name, literally was on top of everything. She made sure we were happy with our food, made sure we weren't full, made sure if we had room for desserts and checked up on my friend and I constantly. She had used a sweet tone of voice which made everything more pleasant and my dining experience at CF more memorable. If I ever come back and see her, I would request her. Good food and impeccable service!"
