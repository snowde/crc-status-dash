Jennifer D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,2,1.0,5/24/2015,"So I've read this place is either a hit or miss .. Well my 1st time ever at a Cheesecake Factory was a total MISS I was soo disappointed.... And soo as I walk in they were able To seat us within 2-4 min, not bad ... The menu was a little overwhelming so I asked are waitress to come back in a few.. I didn't mean 15 min later... So we then ordered .. 2 couples sat down on each side of us , ordered and  ate there food before we even got ours .. So 3 baskets of bread later the waitress came to us realizing it's been over a 1/2 hour and apologized and brought us complimentary bowl of soup and more bread !! Yeahh ( being a smart ass ) and then said  she will be back with drink since our glasses have been empty for at least 10min . But still kept bring us bread . Then are food finally arrived .. Ohh my soo disappointed it taste sooo bad .. I got Evelyn's fav .. Well it was pasta noodles that tasted straight from  the boiling water NO FLAVOR AT ALL .. The eggplant was like rubber, mayb because it was cooked for over 40 min idk .. And the whole 2 small pieces of artichoke .. I was soo bummed .. But the time I filled up on bread and soup with nothing to drink and a crappy  flavorless plate and the over hour being there I just wanted to leave - and I missed the best part getting a slice of cheesecake to go .. At least they have that down !!"
Christina O.,"Garden Grove, CA",134,22,10,1.0,8/20/2014,"Cheesecake Factory used to be one of my favorite places to eat but now it's not so great. I notice this about a lot of food chain restaurants that are at first successful and then they become almost sluggish and careless. The food quality is not as great, and the service was almost nonexistent. But hey, people will still come to Cheesecake Factory no matter what, food is decent for price you pay for and it's a nice place to dine in without going anywhere too expensive. Now I never have a problem when I eat here, in fact the customer service is usually great the past couple times I've been here. I was here on Tuesday around 2-3pm (don't exactly remember the time). Me and my boyfriend decided to eat outside since it was pretty cold inside with the ac. Our server's name was Lori-Ellen. When she came to take our order she didn't even smile or greet us, she just asked us if we were ready to order. We got the Cajun Jambalaya pasta and fried calamari. What bothered me the most was when she came to bring us the food. She literally dropped off the plate on the corner of the table and left. Um hello?? It'd be nice if you left it in the center of the table for us to eat? Seriously..when she did that with the calamari and came back with the jambalaya, she did the same thing twice. Oh and the extra plates she brought us, the top one was dirty, I don't know why she thought we wouldn't notice that large stain on the dishes she handled us, but I guess she's TOO busy to check if they're clean before she gives them out. We actually told a different server who was working outside as well for a clean plate and she was a lot more friendlier. It was not even busy outside at all, it was just two other tables and us. She checked up on us once. Couldn't find her anywhere, we had to ask a busser for a different sauce for the calamari, he was really nice and helpful, brought it out quick. I wish I knew his name, I'm pretty sure he'd be a way better server than the one we had.  It took forever for her to come outside, we were waiting to ask for the check, ended up waiting for like 15-20mins. I don't know where she disappeared off to. She just seemed lazy about her job and didn't really care much about providing great customer service, please act like you like working there a bit more or don't even work there at all. She also seemed careless about taking the dirty plates off, I don't want to exaggerate and say she slammed the plates together, but it did seem kind of rude to make so much noise clearing plates off our table.I've been a server too so I know what looks acceptable and what doesn't as a server.  Things like this don't usually bother me that much, but I've never have a bad experience like this the other times I've dined, I probably won't be back for a while. We probably just had a bad server but meh, I'll think twice about eating here."
Emily S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",300,40,40,5.0,2/9/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is awesome 90% of the time we go, but our trip tonight had such excellent service that it prompted me to write a review. We were greeted upon arrival and sat promptly. We were sat by our server which gives him points as well. He was super helpful and ran our food as well. I almost order the same thing every time I go to ccf (which has a few modifications) but everything came out perfect just the was I asked for it. Our server Dane did an excellent job and his amazing service definitely is one of the best I've seen in a while."

Jordan V.,"Anaheim, CA",47,38,6,4.0,3/26/2014,Came here last night with the gf.  Girlfriends Steak and salmon was perfect. Gonna order that one next time. I got the Louisiana pasta with chicken it was mehhh... Felt like I coulda made it. Overall a good experience!
Francie R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,5,,4.0,3/30/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory!!  They were very accommodating to our large party and the food and service was excellent :) We had a great birthday celebration
Roban L.,"Tustin, CA",110,58,12,5.0,3/20/2015,Love Cheesecake Factory!! There is always something really good on the menu seeing as how it is so expansive! I don't see how anyone could rate less than 4 stars
Chris D.,"Garden Grove, CA",508,895,5311,3.0,1/15/2011,"Thanks to my work's white elephant gift exchange we did I ended up with a $25 cheesecake factory gift card. I've never been a fan of CF since in most of my experiences the food is pretty mediocre but hey, I'm willing to give it another chance. I haven't been in years since they baked wax paper in my pizza crust.  This location is beautiful inside. Marble everywhere and spotless. Our waitress Veronica was excellent. She was informative, had a great sense of humor, and was extremely friendly.  Bread basket here comes with squaw and french bread.  Both tasted very fresh.  My wife and I loved the squaw bread and were fighting over slices.   After perusing the giant menu of both food and advertisements I was strongly drawn to the crispy beef stir fry..... sounded delicious and I've had it before. When it was my turn to order for some reason I didn't order what I was craving.... out of my mouth came ""green chile cheeseburger"". Why I ordered this I have no clue but it was pretty disappointing. The burger should of been very tasty but it was so bland and boring. The ground beef had no flavor, the cheese had zero flavor, as did the thimble size portion of pico de gallo (had to ask for more). I was hoping for an ortega chile but it was just a few slices of pickled jalapeno. I felt bored and kept thinking ""Why the eff didn't I order what I was craving????"". Fries on the other hand were crispy and hot. I dipped them in BBQ sauce and they were very good.  My wife's entree was excellent. I had a few bites and was very envious. She had the ""Vietnamese Caramel Chicken"". Holy shyte was this good. Chunks of chicken fried crispy in a thick golden batter tossed with green beans, onions, shitake mushrooms, sweet red peppers, in a spicy and sweet sauce. It was excellent and for $12.95 a great deal given the portion and quality. It was on a specials menu so not sure how long they'll have it for but I'd come back for it.  Both of us had the unsweetened passion fruit iced tea. Refreshing!"
Michelle H.,"Santa Ana, CA",185,245,,4.0,6/7/2013,"I was never the biggest fan of Bella Terra because of its horrendous parking - especially late at night, but after trying to find parking to go to this restaurant, I realized there is actually a parking structure in the back. It's a little bit of a walk, but it's not too bad if you ordered a lot of food. The wait for a table is expected to be long. My parents made a poor decision to go to this specific location on a Friday evening without reservations, but the service wasn't all that bad despite the dinner rush. I appreciated our waiter's patience with my family members as they aren't very fluent in English and had a hard time explaining to our waiter what they wanted."
Steph W.,"San Francisco, CA",297,78,20,2.0,12/31/2013,"My family stopped by for dessert and coffee late one night. It wasn't busy at all but the service was slow! Even though we only ordered some cheesecake and a couple hot chocolates/coffees, we were waiting like we ordered entrées instead. The coffee was a bit weak. The hot chocolate was powdery.  Overall a bit disappointing."
Doug M.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",134,151,124,4.0,7/28/2013,"Normally, I avoid the cheesecake factory because the meals are real gut busters.  I was surprised on my visit to see a new ""skinny"" menu, which provides a selection of smaller portion sizes for a decent number of dining options.  Don't be fooled though, the items on the skinny menu are still large - but they are tasty and are priced a couple of bucks less than the main menu options.  ...if they could only bring out fruit instead of bread to munch on before being served, that would be amazing.  :) This location is near an outdoor mall, the freeway and the street.  We dined outdoors around noon and the sun was powerful.  Out table had an umbrella, but some others did not.  (Bring a hat and shades)  The street noise wasn't too bad, but does detract from the experience occasionally.  There is an outdoor fountain that the kids will love."
Dee A.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,10,11,4.0,4/9/2015,They took an 40 mins to make my bf's steak but gave us a free slice of cheesecake to apologize. So it's all good lol
Anthony J.,"Garden Grove, CA",188,51,28,4.0,10/11/2013,"Great place but above is always kinda slow, good odds really good and you have to love their cheesecake my favorite is the Adams peanut butter cup fudge cheesecake lol"
Calvary D.,"Westminster, CA",10,395,2,3.0,1/1/2015,"I go here many time but I never know what to order. I am more in favor of their appetizers such as the calamari and fried avocado, portabello, and zucchini."
nick r.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",62,38,28,5.0,1/15/2015,"Always sit in the bar and always have great service.  Friendly and attentive staff, consistent food."
Lourdes P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,10,5.0,4/26/2015,The eggs Benedict with spinach and bacon was bomb..the lemon ricotta pancake is so tastey as well as the monte cristo breakfast sandwich. I will definitely come back soon. I highly recommend.
Amy R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",33,29,2,1.0,1/12/2015,They get one star only because my Fiancé loves the Hershey cheesecake. Every time I've been to this Cheesecake Factory we have had HORRIBLE service. Tonight was the last straw. We initially waited 10 minutes for someone to come to our table before we got up and asked for a booth not next to the bathroom. Our waitress told us that we'd have to wait a while if we wanted bread. Our fried cheese appetizer was cold and I have been waiting now for 15 min for our waitress to come by again with the check. Our waitress was more interested in another waiter's big party of 7 than our party of 2.
Alex D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",14,2,,4.0,6/12/2015,"I went to this location last night with my family. I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza, which was a good blend of Italian cuisine and American flavor. The chicken was fresh and tender, and was not overpowered by the barbecue sauce like at some other restaurants. After the main course, I ordered the Oreo cheesecake for dessert, which was extremely rich and satisfying, even if it can be a little too filling. Overall, the service was friendly and prompt, and I would definitely recommend this location to those in the area. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of parking at Bella Terra."
Francisco T.,"Santa Clara, CA",13,53,17,1.0,8/14/2014,"The food was good, nothing to be amazed of. What contributed to my decision of one star was the server. I do not remember her name, but she was rude since the beginning. We kept just ignoring it hoping our service would improve, we were wrong. We asked her to box our food politely and when she returned she dropped bags with the food on the table. I still left her a 20 percent tip just to maybe get her to treat people my color a little better. I know Hispanics usually do not leave a big tip, but I always do I appreciate the service and compensate generously. We will not be returning."
Karen M.,"Long Beach, CA",37,34,16,4.0,2/19/2015,"Love love loved our experience here for lunch on Monday. Which was presidents day and super busy. Server really made our experience grand. My son was, well a hungry 17 month old. She asked if she could please bring him bananas. Not going to disagree with her. She cut up bananas super thin along with 4 pieces of bread. He was quiet the whole lunch and even when his HUGE portion sized mac n cheese came out. my lunch pasta and my moms lunch portion of fish & chips were delish a s filling. We had enough for dinner later on. And the dessert was perfect. I love traditional strawberry cheesecake, but the 30th anniversary chocolate one was to die for. I would suggest to not sit a toddler in a table so close next to other dining guest. I think its more common sense but the hostess didnt think so."
