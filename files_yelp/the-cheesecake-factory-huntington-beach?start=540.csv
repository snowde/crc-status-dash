Stas O.,"Fountain Valley, CA",305,243,83,4.0,9/15/2013,"Sat at a table near the bar.. Wasn't to bad. Ordered 4 shots, which came out about 15 minutes later, with the ice melted!! I must say they were pretty hefty shots, but came out so late. The service was ok, not the greatest, but not the worst. Overall i would come back, but would choose to not sit by the bar."
Sarah L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,2.0,2/16/2016,"Love the food, that's a 5 star for every time I come here.  But the server was getting my nerve last night.  At the beginning, he was super friendly.  After we ordered water and 3 dishes and an appetizer for 4 of us, he's starting to give us that ""you guys are wasting my time"" look.  When the time we needed to pack our food to go, he took our plates and disappeared for 20mins.  I asked him for the food that he packed for us, he said they were sitting at the table inside.  What on earth!"
Ken M.,"Gardena, CA",4,12,,4.0,2/19/2014,"Located right off the 405 and inside the Bella Tella outdoor shopping center, this one is pretty clean and modern and they've got an outdoor patio that can handle a table for two, as well as larger parties.  Parking can be tight on weekends in the nearby lot near Barnes & Noble, so if it's crowded, I'd suggest parking in the structure on the other side towards Costco.   If you've never been to a Cheesecake Factory, anticipate your entrée being a pretty good sized portion.  One of my favorite appetizers here has got to be the fried mac n' cheese, which is certainly not an everyday food, but heck, once in a while, you deserve it.  Their sweet tamale corn cakes are another winner, especially if you're not in the mood for meat.  Garlic noodles aren't too shabby, either.  Sandiwiches are also pretty solid and seriously, their menu has so many different types of food, there's bound to be something for everyone.   Of course, you probably want to save some room for cheesecake, though they're usually in the $7-9 range per slice, so they're not as reasonably priced as their entrees.  If you're looking for something not too sweet, opt for the vanilla cheesecake."
Kendra P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,8,,1.0,9/16/2014,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE 0 STARS, I WOULD.  I ate there about a week ago with my boyfriend and about half way through my meal, I saw a worm IN MY FOOD. It was so disgusting, I almost threw up. When I told the manager, he said ""well they are farm-fed so it happens sometimes."" He apologized and then walked away. We then asked our waiter what the manager was going to do about it and at that point, the manager came back and said he would comp our meal. Honestly, they should have done A LOT more than that. To make matters worse, I emailed corporate and NO REPLY. If they would have handled this better, I would not have posted this review. But I just had t share this story.  I have pictures, but I'll spare everyone the stomach ache."
Audrian N.,"Westminster, CA",83,147,29,1.0,8/15/2012,"First of all, I need to say that I used to be in love with Cheesecake Factory. However, a lot of things have changed. All my peers from local temple have warned me about the decreasing service of this particular location but I ignored all those and chose to come here for my birthday. And boy that was THE mistake I could have avoided. My server that night Nelson H. At first he was pretty nice and all. We ordered 2 appetizers, 4 entrees and a few drinks. The drinks came, then we waited waited and waited. Nelson stopped by once and told us the food would be out soon. Then entrees came. No appetizers at all. Getting very hungry after all those time waiting, we ate right away. And Nelson was nowhere to be found.  After a while, Nelson stopped by at the table, said sorry for the appetizers not coming out. We were already half way to the food so it was pointless.  After all the food, a friend of mine asked Nelson if he could do anything for my birthday, his reply was that Cheesecake Factory offers nothing for birthday. This is it No more Cheescake Factory. If they don't  value my business, I ll take it somewhere else.  Should have listened to my peers, should have, should have"
Yareli M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",123,161,393,4.0,2/9/2011,"I come here once in a while. I live pretty close id say about 5 miles. I come here because i love their dessert menu!! LOL. When you come eat here you gotta save room for dessert!! Last time i came here was on Friday, girls night out. My favorite plate that i always order is called ""The Louisiana Pasta""...ahh its so yummy full of flavor, its a bow tie paste topped off with 2 lightly fried chicken breast pieces. It is so delicious it keeps you wanting more. My sister order this other pasta plate which was also delicious but i forgot what its called, she actually got it thanks to the waitress (im sorry i forgot your name but if you read this review thank u so much for recommending this plate to my sister). She was also very helpful and nice. My cousin got the Louisiana pasta as well. She loved it! And my friend got the steak Diane with mashed potatoes and shrimp scampi, which was also delicious.  We then moved onto desserts, i got the tiramisu cheesecake, my sister and cousin got the fresh strawberry cheesecake, and my friend got the chocolate chip cheesecake. Very guilty pleasures but so good! Well worth it. Id say overall if your looking for a nice dinner maybe girls night out, date with the bf, lunch, or just because. This is a good place to go eat and enjoy yourself. Trust me...ive been there quite a few times!"
Josh S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",154,5,7,4.0,11/26/2013,"so, i am not a cheesecake/dessert/sweets guy, and i took my girlfriend here to grab dessert. We got the s'more cheesecake, and it was excellent (the few bites i took). Very nice setting at night. Speedy service. Go to cheesecake factory for a date :)"
Summer W.,"Westminster, CA",34,230,339,4.0,2/18/2013,"Miso Salmon...DELICIOUS!  I always order extra snow peas.  Their sauce is just to die for.  I've had it at other restaurants but it's just NEVER the same or even close. The service is always great here. I love their starter breads.   Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic- Delicious.  No peas though.  I think it's weird to have peas in your pasta.... The sauce is so good.  A lot of pastas, you can eat and get tired of the sauce immediately.  You can finish the whole plate and still want to scrape that sauce off with your bread! Asian Chicken Salad- great proportion of toppings.  Get the dressing on the side.  And get extra almonds.  YUM!!! Fave Cheesecakes:  Red Velvet, Reese's, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle The wait is sometimes out of control.  So make sure you get someone to put their name down and go shopping for a bit and come back.  The parking is crazy in this area.  go straight to the parking structure and dont waste gas circling around that parking lot. outdoor dining isnt bad, they have heat lamps out there.  i just hate eating outside because the tables are dusty and there's bugs that can fly in your food.  but it's beautiful out in the summer."
Jeri A.,"Gardena, CA",59,20,20,5.0,8/17/2013,"Love the avocado egg rolls, crab dip and especially the Miso Salmon!  So good!  Should make a miso salmon and scampi combo that would be awesome!   Everything is good here!"
Kali W.,"Fountain Valley, CA",25,5,1,5.0,3/10/2015,Best place ever!!! Very good service and waiters! Will deff come again! The back patio was beautiful with heat lamps very nice. I love there cheesecake sheesh who doesn't . Hella good scampi for real
Mollie L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/14/2015,"Worst Service ever from the waiter. Had to ask for every thing because he would not come to our table which was annoying. I ordered the ""Cajun chicken littles"" the chicken was bland no flavor whatsoever. The sauces literally tastes like jelly spread."
Cor V.,"Westminster, CA",0,383,294,3.0,1/8/2016,"Cheesecake Factory today after watching the Hateful 8 movie could not lift my spirits up....was it the movie or the omelette or the service??  Let's just say that the service could have been a bit better and the omelette was meh.....I really expected more from a simple spinach mushroom omelette...it came with dry slices of toast and I opted for their cubed potatoes.  Is it just me, or has the way you make omelettes changed....I expected the ingredients which also included cheese and bacon bits to be totally immersed and mixed within the omelette...helas it appeared that part was cooked separate and then FOLDED in separately cooked egg....oh well.  The toast came dry...no butter, no jellies.....and the potato squares got over cooked under the heat lamp....I can't blame the staff too much as one person waited on many many tables.....perhaps the movie had an influence on me.....you have to experience it yourself....and I should give the extensive menu at the Cheesecake Factory another chance...."
Claire G.,"Long Beach, CA",252,89,79,5.0,8/11/2013,"My family and I ordered the following when we visited The Cheesecake Factory: Fresh Kale Salad, Stuffed Mushrooms, Crispy Crab Bites, Thai Lettuce Wraps, Steak Diane, Chargrilled Coulotte Steak, Banana Cheesecake and Original Cheesecake. The Fresh Kale Salad was served with cranberries, apples, marcona almonds and green beans tossed with a Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing. Although this menu item is listed under the small plates and snacks, the serving size was enough for my husband and I to share. We asked for the dressing on the side, so that we could control how much dressing to put because we don't like our salads drenched in dressing. We will definitely order this salad again because it is healthy, fresh, and delicious! The Stuffed Mushrooms were also listed under the small plates and snacks menu item, so we got 6 bite sized stuffed mushrooms that I shared with my husband. The mushrooms are stuffed with fontina and parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We will definitely order this menu item again because it was very yummy! The Crispy Crab Bites are featured in the small plates and snacks menu as well as in the SkinnyLicious Menu. These bite-sized little crab cakes are served with mustard sauce. This item tasted okay. There was nothing special about the flavors, so I will most likely not order this menu item again. The Thai Lettuce Wraps are featured under the Appetizers menu. When you receive this item, you will be amazed by the display of food and colors!  All of the ingredients are laid out on a boat shaped dish, so that you can create your own lettuce tacos!  Ingredients: Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew. The mixture of all of these ingredients will burst into your mouth!  This dish is a bit messy, but definitely fun, colorful, and flavorful!  I will definitely order this menu item in future visits! Steak Diane: I asked the server about the most ordered menu item and he recommended the Steak Diane. This certified angus beef steak is adequately covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce (with few pieces of mushrooms) and served with perfectly mashed potatoes and grilled onions. This meal was by far, my most favorite menu item!  The portion sizes are large, so I was only able to eat half of what was provided.  This meal tasted even better for lunch the next day! My husband and daughter ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak (Prime Sirloin). Although this steak is served with French Fries and Crispy Onion Rings, both my husband and daughter substituted this part with steamed broccoli.  From what I heard, they both enjoyed the steak and broccoli very much.  The steak was nice and tender and the sauce from the steak was delicious! Dessert: I shared a Banana Cheesecake with my husband and our daughter ordered the Original Cheesecake. The cheesecake tasted like bananas and the sliced bananas that covered the cheesecake were fresh. This cheesecake wasn't rich and sweet, which is exactly what I like! I will definitely order the banana cheesecake the next time I visit The Cheesecake Factory! Don't forget to try the fresh, warm, and delicious rye bread that is provided as soon as you sit down at your table.  Slather some of their sweet butter on that rye bread to get a taste of it!"
Marcos M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,19,,3.0,3/7/2014,We come here to this location a few times a month. Food is always on point; never really had a bad dish. You can always find a plate that'll suite you.  What's hit and miss are the waiters/waitresses. They are on point or not. It hasn't gotten to a point where it will prevent me to go back but I can see it can become an issue if the string of bad service becomes more frequent.
Caleb H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,4.0,2/28/2014,"I love a restaurant with free bread! Portions here are huge, so I suggest sharing if you intend on sampling their assortment of cheesecakes. I like to get a simple grilled piece of salmon here--nothing too exciting, but it's my go-to because I always find it moist and not overly-seasoned. Entrees aside, I personally think the best part of coming here is the cheesecake selection. My favorites are vanilla bean, dulce de leche, and banana because of their relative lightness. The others (especially the chocolatey ones) are just way too sweet. Service is usually on point here; no complaints."
Tarek G.,"Orange, CA",30,128,54,4.0,8/30/2013,"We had a big group, the food was prepared nicely, our waitress was awesome and everyone had a good time.  I am glad we went at a not busy time because our lunch would of turned it an all day affair.  But, I've always liked Cheesecake Factory and will keep coming when I feel up to it."
Jesus O.,"Long Beach, CA",29,21,2,5.0,11/3/2014,"As usual, the food is great and the service is typically good. The beer selection is decent and I don't think I've ever had a cheesecake that I didn't like. This place is as good as any other Cheesecake Factory; the bar isn't huge, still a good size though. I keep coming back."
Jim J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9,9,,1.0,10/11/2012,"Took my wife here for dinner tonight after catching a movie.  They weren't terribly busy and got us seated quickly.  Brad, our server took our order and we waited, and waited...  After about 40 mins Brad stops by the table and apologizes for the wait but assures us our dinner is coming right up. About another ten mins later the manager pops by, also apologizes for the wait, and he too assures us our dinner is coming right out.  Mind you this whole time I'm watching other patrons being seated, receiving their food, finishing their food and leaving.   Finally a full hour after we first ordered Brad comes over with my wife's plate, and it's cold.  He tells me mine is coming right up, yeah.  Another ten mins go by, still no food.  Eventually Brad walks by the table again and I told him to tell the kitchen to never mind.  We cut our losses and walked out.  Worst service I've had in years and we'll definitely never go back.  Poor way to do business."
Elizabeth T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",123,63,6,4.0,7/14/2013,"It's Cheesecake Factory.   Too big of a menu with most things tasting pretty good. I had the raw tuna and it was delicious.   The three things that make them stand out are there customer service, their cheesecake, and their drinks.  Everyone is super helpful at this location.  I ordered a cheesecake for a baby shower and they even personalized it if you give them a few hours notice.  Moreover, whether it is their wine list or their mixed drinks, I have never had anything bad."
Shawna L.,"Westminster, CA",40,19,13,4.0,7/8/2013,"Finally making Yelp account to review =)) Been here several times. Always happy with the services. Servers are nice and attentive. Foods are well seasoned and delicious. However, knock off 1 star because of the parking spaces. This location located in Bella Tera mall which was occupied with tons of car. Took me good 20 minutes to find a freaking parking space. So you've been warned. Be prepare to come early if you are on a important date =))"
