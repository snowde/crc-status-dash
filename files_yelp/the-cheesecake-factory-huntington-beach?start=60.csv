Dianna P.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,39,34,3.0,4/3/2017,"Well we went Tuesday, March 28, 2017 for our anniversary. It was packed. Not as to what we would've thought. Hey said wait for ten minutes. It was a bit longer than that. After we got seated, we requested a high chair that they took a bit long to bring. My husband got something called Cajun shrimp with noodles. He said he only liked the shrimp. I order the filet mignon, and well done. Honestly it was over cooked on me he outside and raw in the inside. If I would've noticed at the restaurant, I would've complained. But I didn't eat much because I got full with appetizers and plus the dim light didn't help me much. I ate the following day for lunch and even after hearing it in microwave, the meat was still super raw. Well worth $30? No way. We got dessert afterwards, well couldn't go wrong there."
Emily W.,"Birmingham, MI",236,3,,5.0,12/9/2017,Hello cheesecake factory is good. Jenna my server is so nice very nice girl. thank you cheesecake
Summer T.,"Laguna Beach, CA",471,211,408,4.0,9/27/2016,"Service was great.  The waitress was very attentive.  Located inside the Bella Terra Plaza next to Barnes and Noble.  Grilled Steak Medallions:  decent, tender, flavorful, but still a bit dry.   Jambalaya:  decent, tasty.  Avocado eggrolls:  decent Snickers cheesecake:  delish."
Grace H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,46,15,5.0,10/14/2017,"15 minutes wait quoted exactly on Saturday evening was not bad. Dinner was good,  ambiance was superb and waiter was very good. However, the skinnicious chicken pot pie was on the salty side for someone who's trying to watch salt contents."
Trinity L.,"Corona, CA",75,49,107,5.0,3/12/2017,Everything was excellent. We all ordered the lunch size... which were perfect serving amount. The cheesecakes are to die for . Can't go wrong here. And Laurie B our server gets 10 stars. She went over and beyond making us feel like special guest in her home.
Esther S.,"Clovis, CA",138,456,122,4.0,9/1/2016,"The price-range is more than I would want to spend on this kind of food, but we had a gift card for my husband's birthday, so we went. The cheesecake is very good.  We went when the cheesecakes were half-off, so that was even better.  I recommend the white chocolate raspberry truffle.  It's a perfect blend of flavors, and even better with coffee. Food-wise, the menu is so extensive, and everything has been solid, but the one thing that stood out to me was their Stuffed Mushrooms -- Delicious.  Had to stop myself from slurping up the wine sauce leftover. I like this location.  There's generally not too much of a wait, even on a weekend."
David Q.,"Huntington Beach, CA",99,78,12,1.0,6/1/2017,"I don't know if we went on a bad day or if this place has really gone downhill. We went for dinner Memorial Day. We ordered a couple drinks. I ordered a Kettle One Dirty Martini. This is my go to drink because I always order it and know what it tastes like. It did not taste dirty and I could not tell if there was any alcohol in it. I didn't even catch a buzz. I don't know what it was but it seemed more like cold slightly sweet and salty water. During our 2 hours there our sections waiters switched out 3 times and our serves were never the same. We ordered a couple appetizers and entrees. The appetizers were fried and hard to mess up. They came out hot. My wife ordered chicken and biscuits, I ordered steak Diane. Her chicken and biscuits looked like it sat under a heat lamp all day. It was tuff, rubbery, the biscuits were tough and sad looking. She could've got better chicken and biscuits at Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). My Steak Diane did not look like Steak Diane. I called the waiter over and asked what it was. He said it was Hibachi Steak but it was missing the onions, bean sprouts, pesto and tempura asparagus... WTF! We go out to eat as a treat. When we go out to eat we expect food that is much better than we can make it. In the amount of time it took them to bring us terrible food I could've made the same food... only a 100 times better.  When did the quality at this place drop to below the level of fast food restaurants."
Tiffany L.,"Alhambra, CA",320,122,158,4.0,2/6/2017,"**WONDERFUL HAPPY HOUR!!!** This review is strictly based only on happy hour menu! I didn't think I'd ever give Cheesecake Factory 4 stars, but the price and food quality of what you get is pretty awesome.  -CRAB DIP was delicious!! I would definitely get this again. I assumed the taste would have been with imitation crab meat, but it wasn't! It tasted like actual crab, but who knows?  -BUFFALO BLASTS was full of deep fried goodness. Initially my friend and I believed it was buffalo wings, but when they delivered it out, it was basically chicken meat with some buffalo flavoring, covered in deep fried dough. Not a huge fan of deep fried goodness, but it was quite tasty!  I'd definitely come back strictly for happy hour 4-6pm!"
Bryce M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",217,47,37,1.0,9/12/2017,"This hurts me to do this because I've been eating at the cheesecake factory for over 20 years and I've never had a bad experience but last night was just awful.  As soon as we walked in it was like walking into a freezer, I'm a big guy I'm never cold, it was the first time I've ever been cold in a restaurant in my life everybody that was with us was freezing. We were celebrating my nieces birthday,  The hostess knew and the waitress knew, but they never acknowledged or brought out a birthday dessert which I thought was standard.  I don't want to sound cheap but when you run up a $400 tab a little birthday treat should be a thank you for your business kind of deal.  The worst part was, it took over an hour to get our entrées, by the time we got the food everything was delicious but the overall experience was just horrible, it will be a long time before we go back."
Kylie S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/1/2017,I am OBSESSED!!!! I have every birthday/celebration at this restaurant. It has always been my absolute favorite place. Best food always! I get the Louisiana chicken pasta with a glass (or 3) of seven daughters moscato. I can not get enough of this place! Great atmosphere and great staff! Can't wait to go back!!
Michelle V.,"Westminster, CA",0,17,21,3.0,6/5/2017,My first time ever here at cheese cake factory with my baby. I have to say I enjoy the drinks more then I did with the food. Wasn't all that hype for then I expected.
Darren P.,"Westminster, CA",0,1,1,1.0,4/2/2017,I ordered a pasta da Vinci full order then got a half one?! I guess someone was hungry in the kitchen! Don't ever go here 4/2/17
Em C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,19,,5.0,12/5/2017,"My family  comes here when we don't know exactly what we are craving for-there is so much variety in the menu it can be overwhelming! But everything we've tried so far is good, and I really love the salads-especially  the ones on the healthy menu ! Calamari is always a fave appetizer; I recently tried an Asian spring roll which was sooo good  (although price was on the high side for 2 small rolls ).   I highly recommend, haven't been disappointed yet!"
Leslie B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,13,24,2.0,6/8/2017,"I recently went to Cheesecake Factory in HB around 5pm. I decided to try breakfast.  2 eggs over medium, bagel (only one kind available) and cream cheese and potatoes.  VERY DISSAPPOINTED IN MEAL   DENNYS IS 100% BETTER. Potatoes burnt. Server said they use seasoning on potatoes, that is the way suppose to be. Brought back still burnt!  Eggs, must of came from tiny chicken lol  for the size of each egg very small.  Lastly bagel tosated to long burnt.  Service  was so so.  Extremely dissappointed"
Geri S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,5,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"This place sucks!! If you are hungry don't bother coming here. If you hate over air conditioned places definitely don't com here. It took 45 min to get an app that consisted of a one inch piece of chicken, lettuce, rice noodles and carrots. THEN, we got a a vegetarian pasta dish and asked to add chicken to it. Meanwhile we asked them to turn the air conditioning off. For some reason a manager came over and apologized that it was so cold and said they were working on fixing the problem. The pasta came out and was pretty dry so we asked for olive oil. The tipping point was the chicken. They put two different types of chicken. There were chunks (about 5 pieces) of juicy moist chicken and grilled slices of dry chicken on top. I ate some of the pasta and a chunk of chicken. It was ok. Then I took a bite of grilled chicken. It was awful. I asked the ""manager"" why two types of chicken. Her suggestion was she could take off one of the charges for one of the types of chicken. I said "" why am I being charged twice for chicken when I only asked for ONE side of chicken?"" Her explanation is that the chunks are in the pasta line and they added the grilled chicken and she could take off ONE of the charges for chicken. Again I asked "" why am I being charged twice for chicken when I only asked for one side of chicken? Again she repeated the same bull#%!*.  We told her to take the pasta off and she said she would only charge for one drink. When the bill came back she charged for both drinks and the app. I asked her to take the app off too. The bill came back and she charged for both drinks.  So I paid for the privilege of being frozen out and no dinner. Not coming back to this Cheesecake Factory again."
Tatiana R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/29/2017,I just want to thank you guys for forgetting to making my food gluten free . Real allergic and really sick now. It's not just a fad diet - some of us really suffer. You're the real MVP !
Stephanie I.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,43,9,3.0,9/19/2017,"Every time I go here I say I'm never coming back. Then another family event pops up, and I end up back at a Cheesecake Factory, again disappointed. The service is lacking, the food and drink is very over priced."
Rudy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,63,14,4.0,2/2/2017,"Arrived. Waited for 1/2 hour or so for a table to become available.  Hostess gets irritated when being asked for an update after about a 1/2 hour wait. (Looks like she was having a bad night.)  We finally get seated and can relax.   Our waitress apologized for the wait and asked us for our drink and appetizer order.  Took a while, but we were good. Bread was brought out. The waitress stated she was waiting for fresh bread. Got our drinks and placed our orders. I ordered the Chicken Picatta sans mushrooms. My gorgeous girlfriend ordered the Chicken Carbonara.  The waitress brought us a complimentary soup because of our long wait. My girlfriend really enjoyed it.  Our meals arrived hot and ready to eat. My pasta was over cooked. That was disappointing. Otherwise, the Chicken was great. Very tasty. My girlfriend really liked her Chicken Carbonara. She added red pepper flakes to taste. (No dish is complete- without the heat, or so she she says!) No room for dessert tonight. I would have given it a 3 star rating- but thought the waitress did the restaurant proud.   Will go back again hoping to have a better experience."
Jason V.,"CA, CA",18,178,928,5.0,8/19/2017,Had a great experience here....a incredible waitress named Megan....she took our order and made some suggestions and everything was delivered with incredible accuracy and quickly.....I never waited for anything.....she packaged all the extra food and has a great attitude and outlook.....Thanx again.....you rock......
Hannah M.,"Westminster, CA",0,14,4,1.0,12/24/2017,"Worst experience at this location. Neither our server nor the chef knows what's vegan or not. When they told us that honey and cheese is vegan, that's when we knew we couldn't trust anything they said because they clearly do not know anything about a vegan diet. Then we decided on the Evelyn's pasta with no cheese or butter and the veggie sandwich with a sourdough bun and no eggs. Guess what? They bring out the pasta with Parmesan on top! And a glistening brioche bun which clearly has egg and butter. WTF. Then the manager approaches us to apologize and offers to comp an item. The receipt comes out and it's not comped. Then we ordered the Asian chicken salad with no chicken with avocados instead. They charged $3 for the avocado when the server said we can substitute avocado instead of chicken. What kind of establishment is this? Needless to say we will not be coming back and reporting this to corporate so they can properly train their staff of food allergies and proper preparation."
