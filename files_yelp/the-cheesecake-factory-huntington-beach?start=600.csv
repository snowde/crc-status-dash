Joe M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/22/2014,"Service was fine. Food sucked. American style Kobe beef is an oxymoron.  The noodles in the pasta dish were so over cooked it fell apart and didn't taste right. The menu had too much writing, advertisement and the word specialties appeared too many times. they try to cover to many denominations of food. And it looked like the evil eye in the sky from lord of the rings decorated the place. Sorry, your food sucked."
J J.,"CA, CA",1,15,,5.0,5/23/2013,"Cheesecake Factory, 7871 Edinger Ave, Huntington Bch, CA The Cheesecake Factory gets it right !  This location is beautiful, and is very popular.  I love the steak diane, the lemon chicken, their appetizers, and the WHOLE menu !  The service is excellent. My only complaint about this location, is that they do not have an outdoor dining area.  Other than that, it is a fantastic dining experience.  Enjoy !"
Lola L.,"Hemet, CA",35,357,114,3.0,2/2/2013,"Ahhhh, what to say....nice ambiance, well trained staff, stiff drinks, nice music in the bar area but this place is so packed all the time, parking at Bella Terra SUX and the food isnt really all that. we had:  Popcorn Shrimp....just ok   Ahi Tartare....lots of avocado but not a lot of Ahi Crispy Crab Bites....not a lot of crab, actually bland and too soft for my taste Tex Mex Eggrolls...now these were pretty good. they were served with a spicy avocado dip that was pretty good Its ok but im not in any hurry to get back to Cheesecake Factory. They have a lot of business, i dont think it really matters...."
Michella F.,"Anaheim, CA",1,30,,5.0,8/9/2014,Come here alot :) Food is always good and fresh no matter what time we go. I have tried several menu items and have not been disappointed at all! The waiters are kind and quick. Love to eat here !
Jason A.,"Cerritos, CA",1079,700,1631,4.0,10/26/2009,"This is the closest Cheesecake Factory to my work, so I come here once in a while and when they have crazy promotions.  My first time at this particular location was during their anniversary last year when they had 50% off all cheesecakes. Man alive, there were people flooding the main entrance all trying to get a slice or two...or three. Now, I do admit that getting most cheesecake aficionados tend to be of the larger variety, so I could be exaggerating when I say there were a lot of people in the doorway. It may have been just a couple really big ones.  Nonetheless, I realized that it would probably be faster and more efficient to just ask for a table and eat lunch...THEN order a slice of cheesecake to go! See, that's how you maximize your lunch break and still take advantage of the promotion.  I had the Da Vinci pasta and decided to take a chocolate Godiva cheesecake to go, since it's more chocolate than actual cheese. Though I've never been a large fan of cheesecake, seeing the richness of the chocolate made me reconsider my stance and give it a try.  I could feel my ass get larger with every bite once I took it back to the office. I knew this was bad and made a promise to light some incense in front of a picture of my dead relatives to bring me some good luck in ridding myself of this chocolaty goodness.  I ended up just fasting for the rest of the day and ran a few hours on a treadmill when I got home that day. Good enough."
Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729,4.0,1/18/2012,"The wait on a Friday night for this location was estimated to be about 30-40 minutes so we walked around a bit and luckily there are a lot of cute little shops and live music that killed time. Within 30 minutes we were seated outside and I was amazed to see how nice the outside seating was! However, it was a bit cold and uncomfortable (and i was scared of bugs or ants). Our server didn't come by often enough, and we didn't have any plates to put our bread on.  I always hate how the menu at cheesecake is sooooo long!! I've always had the chicken bellagio but this time I got the chicken marsala and I LOVED IT!!!! I think that's what I'll get from now on. Although our server disappeared a lot, he was really nice.  For dessert I split the tiramisu cheesecake but didn't enjoy it too much. I could barely taste any cheesecake at all and it was too rich for me."
Mark N.,"Westminster, CA",878,103,6,3.0,6/15/2014,"The location, ambience, and cheesecakes are excellent. I keep telling myself to come back almost to force myself to like this place, because the food hasn't been satisfactory. I've tried entrees from pastas to steaks to enchiladas to the Kobe beef burger."
Rosemary T.,"Tustin, CA",533,677,2406,4.0,2/2/2012,"Yes, they do have a LARGE selection of different types of food here, but only thing that's worth while is their jambalaya, sheppard's pie, and lettuce wrape are the only way to go here."
Sam P.,"Redlands, CA",374,494,251,4.0,1/8/2012,"Good fresh food at an affordable price with great people watching.  The portion sizes are large enough that you'll be taking some food home with you.  I think that Cheesecake Factory is probably one of the best large chain restaurants.  And I'm not even a fan of cheesecake.  The menu is extensive, but all quality meals.  I had the chicken salad sandwich with a salad and a cup of soup.  All for $11. Maddy was able to hang out on the patio outside of the fence.  She ate half my sandwich!"
Hai N.,"Westminster, CA",5,23,6,4.0,2/24/2014,"My go to spot!!! Love all their pasta. Especially Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. My family and I could eat this every night. Only complaint, service at times could be better."
Richard And Elainne S.,"Garden Grove, CA",11,132,39,4.0,4/27/2014,Came here for dinner with the hubby and my girl Nancy. It seemed pretty crowded but when we put our name down the wait was only 15mins. I didn't think it would be that short because there were alot of people. But sure enough about 15mins later our name was called. Yaaaayy!!! We were all getting hungry and couldn't wait to order. We got seated and a few mintues later our waiter came and took our drink orders. When our drinks arrived he took our food order since we were all ready and not too long after our appetizier came out then our food. We are liking the fast service! The hubby got the louisiana chicken pasta which he said was good. I stole a bite and it was tastey. Nancy got the garlic noodles which is one of my faves. She enjoyed it. And I had the romano crusted chicken. It was salty! I mean it was like they poured salt all over my chicken and soaked my pasta in salt. It was unedible. Even Nancy took a bite and could not believe it. I had to send it back and our waiter was nice enough to ask whether I wanted a different dish or the same after he explained why it was too salty. I asked for the same and after a few minutes my new dish was out. He waited until I tried it before he left and it was perfect. So tastey and not salty at all! Thats great service. Plus he was very friendly too! I just forgot his name. Will definitely come here again since it is the closest Cheesecake Factory to me :)
Zed M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",137,3,,5.0,4/5/2013,"Came in earlier this evening after a bad day. The place was kind of empty but the waitress I had still payed very close attention to me. Constantly checking up on me, very prompt, and very, very polite. Almost seemed like I had company for the whole duration I was there. Despite my mood, her service alone managed to turn my whole evening around. If you decide to visit this place, ask to be catered to by a pretty one named Nedda. All five stars are singularly hers. Also, try the honey whiskey they serve. I think its called Wild Turkey Honey. Hits you right in the head and easy to enjoy."
R D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,26,,4.0,7/19/2014,"I don't think we've ever had a bad meal here and you can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes.  My only gripe is that self parking is a bit of a hassle during peak times and unless you valet park, it's likely you'll have to park in the parking structure near the theaters."
Gabriel P.,"Lakewood, CA",16,7,,3.0,1/18/2014,Good food but ssssslllllooooowwww service  & a tip of 18% factored in. I probably would've not left a tip. No refills on kids drinks or beers.
Chris A.,"Garden Grove, CA",9,82,,5.0,4/6/2014,"Don't sit in the bar if you're eating, service is slow and not the best there. But aside from that.. as a restaurant Itself cheesecake factory is my FAVORITE! Love the huge diverse menu. As a location I love it too! Great quality service everytime, except being in the bar, food tastes amazing, its just simply the best. Not overpriced either. Deserts are delicious. Next time you go try the Louisiana Chicken Pasta dish!! Amazing. Thats all I have to say :)"
Cindy Y.,"Boston, MA",576,333,878,4.0,8/31/2013,"Can't believe how good the service was. I really felt like they kept checking up on us and making sure that we had everything we needed. Additionally, my dish was splendid. I got the salmon, which came with 5 pieces of asparagus fanned out. This came with mashed potato in the middle and a nice big piece of salmon, brushed with herbs, placed in the middle. The whole plate came with a creamy, yet vinegary sauce that paired extremely well with both the salmon and mashed potatoes. The brown bread that they give you in the beginning is absolutely divine, especially when paired with this dish. So so great! My dad ordered this for me because I needed something soft to chew on, and it was perfect for that. Unfortunately, didn't get our waitress's name, but she was absolutely great! Wouldn't mind coming back if I'm in the area."
Michelle M.,"Irvine, CA",1220,350,2397,2.0,7/6/2011,"Ughhh...it's hard to give a Cheesecake Factory any less than 3 stars.  Usually their service and food are pretty consistent, but low and behold, this one may be the first Cheesecake I give below 3 stars. Came in around 10 pm last Friday for dinner.  I was having a mad craving for that strawberry shortcake dessert I love oh so much! We were seated immediately, thumbs up! Then, that's about as far as it goes... Waitress was slow in taking down our orders (both for drinks and meal), promised to bring bread, but it took her forever, promised to also check on my dessert, but it took her an excruciatingly long time.  Basically, our waitress was MIA for most of our meal and when she did come by to refill a drink, I had to wince every single time she hurriedly slammed down our drinks and rushed away.  Where are you rushing to?!? There are barely any customers in your section! Bad service = unhappy Michelle = never returning. THE END!"
Jenni I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",246,277,40,4.0,6/13/2012,"Great food, good service. Parking at bella terra is okay. They usually don't check the 40 minute spots (or we've just been lucky? extremely lucky? every single time? maybe). The wait was about 20 minutes... We were given a buzzer so that we could walk around the shopping center, though I'm not sure why they buzzed us if they weren't going to seat us right away.... Who knows. In any case, I ordered the shepherds pie (not what I expected it to be but I guess I should've read the description better...) and my bf got the filet mignon... which was meh in his opinion. On an unrelated note, they've gotten kind of cheap with their bread and gave only one roll of sourdough (I think it's sourdough) and one roll of squaw bread (but I'm sure if you asked they'll bring you more). The shepherds pie was good, but the meat wasn't what I expected. I thought I had read ""shredded beef"" which was actually more like... hamburger meat. Meh, I still like hamburgers... but my palate was not ready for that. It also comes with yummy mashed potatoes on top and is cooked with peas, carrots, and mushroom. I will say that the portion for the shepherds pie was HUGE. I'm still eating my leftovers and I think I'll be good for another meal (making three meals total) The filet mignon came with fries originally, but my bf switched it to mashed potatoes (it also came with two rather large onion rings, haha). He didn't really like the presentation. I'm not sure if he was completely full and satisfied with his meal. Prices are decent for what you get. Waitress was attentive and brought us many many waters (we were thirsty! what can I say~) Overall, it was a good meal, but I knocked off a star because we both seemed unsatisfied with our food."
demetria d.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,3,1,4.0,2/18/2014,"Breeann and Shannon are AMAZING!! Thank you ladies for giving my boyfriend and I a great experience :] We were relaxed and never rushed.  If we go back, we are so asking for Breeann or Shannon...til our next adventure..."
Cooper H.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,29,,3.0,5/8/2014,"I have been to the Cheese Cake Factory a few times and every-time I am not satisfied with meal I get, might just be my taste. However, if you are into Cheese Cake the name of the restaurant speaks for itself."
