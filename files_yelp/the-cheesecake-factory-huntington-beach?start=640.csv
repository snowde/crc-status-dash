Diane V.,"Long Beach, CA",191,168,162,4.0,5/11/2011,"Came here the other night with Julie and Len after going to the 24 hour fitness gym around the corner.  I always love coming here for their delicious but not too sweet Tiramisu.  Not today though.  We were on a ""healthy"" binge so I ordered their house salad from the ""small plates and portions"" side of the menu and shared an order of the lettuce wraps with Julie.  Julie also ordered the grilled spicy chicken salad and Len got the Jambalaya.   All our foods were delicious but the wait was a bit long (20-25) considering it was a Monday night and they weren't busy. The food was delicious though and well worth the wait.  My small salad ($3.95) was actually a good sized ""regular"" serving of salad with 2 freshly cut half slices of tomatoes tossed in their very own vinaigrette.  The lettuce wraps were also giant portion sized and could have fed 3 people so its a good thing we shared this plate.  I love it because they put 3 different sauces (peanut sauce, a thai sauce and some other one I didn't really take a liking to), some noodles, shredded carrots, pickled cucumbers, and grilled chicken teriyaki.  All for you to mix and pick which toppings would like to go inside your wrap.  The lettuce they used for the wraps were big itself and all the condiments and meat fit perfectly inside.  We devoured that thing, it was so good.   Len's jambalaya is on a league of its own.   The shrimp was so juicy and flavorful that I wished I'd gotten his order.  It's my next one to order when I go here again.  Our server, Mike was pretty good about frequenting our table and checking in on us.   It was a shame I didn't get my beloved Tiramisu..almost a sin!  I should get two next time to make up for this.  Try it!"
Kim Chi P.,"Garden Grove, CA",309,108,7,4.0,3/5/2012,"It's Friday and it's dinnertime, so of course it was busy.  They have those indicators that light up when your table is ready, so that helps, and it gives you chance to sit outside away from the hubbub for some stimulating conversation while you wait. Our party of two didn't have to wait long fortunately.  Also, our waiters were quick and attentive. We each ordered a burger, which comes with your choice of fries or garden salad.  It's still Lent, so I stuck with their portabella on a bun.   Although I enjoyed the burger initially, they blacken the ginormous portabella mushroom so the meld of flavors becomes tiresome 3/4 of the way through.  On the other hand, the kobe beef burger may very well become your new favorite! For dessert, we split a vanilla bean cheesecake.  It was light, airy and delicious."
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2372,8712,4.0,1/17/2012,"I used to come to this particular location often, like maybe every few months, because it is located in the Bella Terra Plaza. This plaza is a great place to go for a nice date night because you can walk around and check out all of the shops, check out a movie and have your pick of restaurants to dine at afterwards.  Well there is more than enough parking here if you choose to eat at The Cheesecake Factory (right next to Barnes and Noble Bookstore). The restaurant is nice and clean, cheesecake slices are deliciously displayed in the bakery case and restrooms are usually clean and adequately stocked. There is plenty of yummy and tasty foods you can choose from to order, salads, sandwiches, soups, pasta dishes, chicken and mashed potatoes, beef and rice, an array of appetizers and starters, etc. One of my most favorite appetizers to order is the Thai lettuce wraps. This a huge platter of food that can feed 4 or more people. You could also make this a full meal for 2 or 3 people. I love the sauces that come with this dish. The chicken is perfectly seasoned, very moist and tender. This is definitely a fun food to order (but can be messy, so maybe not the best dish to order on a first date).  Portions of whatever you order are generally pretty generous so you will leave satisfied and full. And if you are like me, you will probably fill up on the free bread in the beginning of the meal while you wait for your meal. I love that Cheesecake has a skinnylicious menu (but don't be fooled, these items are still pretty high in calories, so don't think these dishes are calorie free) and also a small plates menu (perfect for a nice late night bite). Now on to the cheesecakes! If you love desserts, then you MUST try one of their delectable flavors. I hope to someday try all of the flavors. I especially love the pumpkin cheesecake when it's in season (I like to call ahead of time to see if it's in). There are also noncheesecake desserts, but I have never tried them. I really want to try them, but I always get side tracked by the long list of cheesecakes.  The pricing here is a bit pricey, but I am willing to pay it because the food is so delicious. The service here has been pretty good, but sometimes on occassion, I have found some not so attentive servers. But it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't continue to come back here.  Oh and there is also the Sunday brunch menu you can try. The brunch menu is just okay, I find the omelettes and the hash to be a bit greasy and oily. The waffles are huge and the french toast is really thick and sweet. It's like eating dessert.  And by the way, if you come here for late night eating, just know that the lighting is dimmed. A bit too dark for me though. I prefer to be able to see what I am eating and be able to see my date better. But of course it's dimmed for the atmosphere. I just wished it was a little bit brighter.  Overall, food is excellent, service is usually pretty good and pricing is acceptable. A nice place for a date and has one of the best cheesecakes that's perfect for sharing."

Michelle N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",284,24,5,4.0,3/18/2013,Loved my chicken and grey goose martini
Courtney H.,"Westminster, CA",165,133,100,2.0,1/10/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory! I've been to this location many times being that I don't live far from it. Today I was meeting a friend for lunch I arrived before she did. As everyone knows this place can get pretty crowded so I went to the hostess and put my name on the list for party of two. I was told it would be only a few minutes which was fine. As names started to be called we were still waiting. We noticed people coming through the door and were being seated within minutes. I walk up to the podium and tell the girl I've been waiting for 20 minutes and have yet to be seated. She proceeds to tell me someone else must've have got seated when they heard my name. I thought to myself what a lame excuse my name is Courtney, I'm pretty sure I would've heard my own name! Anyway she puts my name in the system about a minute later we were seated at a table where the waiter had yet to pick up the check. Our waiter was Scott he was very nice and attentive. I had the shrimp angel hair pasta which was great as always. Food was great, Scott was great however I have to give this place two stars because of the fact that at least 5 other parties who arrived after me were seated before I was."
Vi V.,"Long Beach, CA",2,11,46,5.0,8/24/2012,Best first time experience at the cheesecake factory. It was saturday around 3 . Wait time: 5 min. Server name : dillon. He was awesome! Made great suggestions on the drink I had.. Strawberry martini... Best drink ever! And the peppermint cheesecake. I was stuffed from the meal but I was so glad I tried the dessert anyways. It was great. My bf had the steak diane and salmon combo. It was delicious. The steak and salmin were separates by mountain of mash potato both with different sauces but goes together very well. The bread was good. I had a reg house salad and I enjoyed that also. We had avocado egg rolls. It was ok.. I think a vegetarian might appreciate it more then I did but it wasnt bad. It just felt like it was missing something cuz the whole eggroll was avocado....
Mariah S.,"Orange County, CA",34,49,78,5.0,7/5/2013,Went for the second time on my birthday and still amazing service ..food is really good and the waitresses always so nice we had sue I believe the other day (july 4th ) awesome job I'm not a cheesecake fan but still want to come back because its more than worth it for the huge selection they have fresh sourdough bread yes !!
Daniel D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/28/2015,Worst service I have experienced in a long time...don't eat here if you can't sit and wait forever.  Do not order the breakfast items....
Karen B.,"Newport Beach, CA",530,549,62,5.0,2/3/2013,"I know 5 stars seems a bit high but everything last night was absolutely seamless. Was heading home from LA and decided to grab a bite here. People were already waiting outside and we expected at least a 30 minute wait. We were told 10-15 minutes and I thought that was doubtful but shocked after 10 minutes were seated. Sat outside on the patio and it was nice and warm and the gazebo added such a nice feel to the atmosphere. Our server came immediately, her name was Rachel and she had the sweetest disposition and great smile. Drinks and warm hot bread were served right away. The menu had some great selections and they had a separate menu called Skinnylicious, items were 590 calories or less. I liked that they serve breakfast all day too because sometimes I love breakfast for dinner. We ordered steak and a chicken sandwich, both served with fries(very good) and the steak had onion rings as well. Everything was delicious. Our server kept the water filled and checked on us, still with that great smile. After dinner we ordered cheesecake to go, always so decadent! I was so impressed on a Saturday night that everything went so perfectly. Even the valet parked the car close because we had a bunch of things inside that we were concerned about. $5.00 for valet was cheap and well worth peace of mind. I had to make a point of letting the manager know our server was awesome and the experience was exceptional. Oftentimes chains do not seemed to be as concerned because they have established themselves but this location and service was a stand out, therefore 5 stars."
Mer G.,"Lakewood, CA",5,15,31,5.0,3/25/2014,"Love their bread, their food, and their service! Came here for my mom's birthday. The server (guy with an old-school mustache) was excellent!! I was and still am really amazed by his outstanding customer service. Really enjoyed my visit to Cheesecake Factory this past weekend. =)"
Stacey K.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,4,,5.0,5/17/2014,"Samantha was my server. She was super friendly,  knew all the questions that i had about the food or cheesecake.  Was super busy but she gave me the right about of attention."
Karen P.,"Garden Grove, CA",83,8,,1.0,11/2/2013,"Bad receptionist. Gave us a 30 min or so wait notice. We - party of 3 - waited patiently. After 30 mins, my boyfriend Ricky came up and asked politely when it would be our turn. The young white boy with curly hair gave us a head-up that we would be the next party-of-3 to be seated. Okay. We continued to wait. Then 2 next groups of 3 got called to be seated. Still no sign of calling us. So my boyfriend asked again. Now the boy told us that he forgot where he left our ticket at. This is just totally ridiculous, something that i didnt expect from an American restaurant. We just left. Total waste of time. This is also the 1st time coming here. Since we want to give it a try. We were so disappointed. Never coming back here again. There are better places with better cheesecakes. And not to mention BETTER SERVICE."
Jenny C.,"Artesia, CA",57,35,46,4.0,10/10/2011,So..I've  been to several ..Cheesecake  Factory eateries. I like this one the best.  Depending on the day & time EXPECT to wait! We've always gotten great service here. The food is good. And the new Skinnylicious Menu is tasty & just the right size. Word to the wise...if you want the Potatoe soup..they only serve it on Wednesdays now =/. BUT the chicken & artichoke soup that they started serving is the bizzzness!!
Robert M.,"Norwalk, CA",58,4,,3.0,5/26/2012,"Let me start by saying that I love this restaurant, I use to come here all the time with some friends of mine, would make it a trip since its 30 mins away, but usually worth it.  Very nice and helpful staff, nice looking restaurant, and cant blame it for the view, it is what it is, most restaurants don't have great views anymore. The big thing about it that made me give it a 3 is the wait time on 2 of the 4 plates.  We received 2 of the plates, both pasta, and then took 7-10 minuets for the other 2, which one was a burger and the other was a salad.  There is no reason for that, no one came out to apologize or to tell us it would be a bit for it or anything.  The server didn't even come out to check on us during this time.  I work at a restaurant, and this is not acceptable.  I was going to talk to the manager, but just wanted to finish and get out. It was a Thursday night, slow, and just not acceptable.  I might give it another shot, but there are some good restaurants within 30 minuets."
Janet K.,"Corona, CA",5,65,,4.0,7/14/2012,"We celebrated my son-in-law's birthday at Cheesecake Factory.  A huge and very diverse menu from which to choose.  My daughter had the Chicken Picatta and found it absolutely perfect.  I tried the Crusted Salmon Salad with Vinegarette Dressing which was very tasty.  Almost too much salmon and not enough salad.  My son-in-law had Kobe Burger which he ordered medium with onions.  The burger was tasty, but more like well done and it came without the onions.   For dessert I had the 30th Anniversary Cheesecake that was scrumptious!  For a chocolate lover, it doesn't get any better.  Not too much chocolate, but just enough.  My daughter had the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and my son-in-law had the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.  Of course, being his birthday, they brought him a chocolate sundae and sang Happy Birthday to him.   The restaurant was busy, but the wait was minimal.  Service was very good and the prices are reasonable."
Mylinh H.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",143,305,375,3.0,11/13/2011,"Shrimp franchese - I liked this dish the best. The shrimp was well marinated and the pasta wasn't bland thanks to the sauce. Shrimp scampish and steak Diane with angel hair - The steak tasted weird. Personally, I don't believe steak belongs in pasta. The shrimp was okay, I didn't like how it was breaded. Cuban sandwhich (in a freaking pasta place) - My dad ordered this for some insane reason and never even ate it so I have no clue how it tastes. It did have cheese melted and what looked liked slices of real beef and not deli meats.  Red Velvet Cheesecake - It's good BUT share it. It gets too sweet after a few bites.  30th Anniversary choco cake - Dad's a chocoholic, 'nuff said. It's pretty good I like how it had bits of choco crumbs ( or something of the like) which added necessary texture. Sweet, very very sweet.  Brothers had sliders and chicken strips from the kids menu. Mom claimed the sliders were good. To me the chicken strips were dry and just not good. The mustard honey sauce covered its bad taste."
KarenQ W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",139,9,,3.0,4/7/2015,"Service was excellent from the start. We ordered the buffalo blasts which were delayed, manager apologized for the delay and it came out after our main meals were served.I ordered the white chicken chili which is way over priced. Its pretty much a small serving of soup with a small scoop of rice in a very large bowl at 13.95. I was expecting a stew style since it was listed as a main dish. I do not recommend. The buffalo blasts were oily and salty. The server took the appetizer off the bill.  Service is always excellent at cheesecake factory but the food is not as quality as i think it should be for their pricing."
Kurtis P.,"Fountain Valley, CA",51,114,3,4.0,1/23/2012,"Started with the chicken croquettes and they did not disappoint.  They were very tasty, check them out!  For dinner I had the Crusted Chicken Romano.  The chicken was great!  The pasta was a bit undercooked for me, but the pink sauce they served with it was awesome!  The highlight of the dish for me. Overall my GF and I dig this place.  We'll be back again!"
Jeannie B.,"Cerritos, CA",568,123,71,3.0,4/8/2011,"I LOVE CHEESECAKE!!! that being said, for my friend's birthday we decided to celebrate at the infamous Cheesecake factory! We were seated almost immediately despite our group of 7 and drinks and orders were taken within the first 10 minutes of being seated.  Everyone's food arrived about 15 minutes later, all but the BIRTHDAY GIRL'S dinner! The manager stopped by our table to inform us that her meal had been overcooked (*they overcooked her chicken in her Louisiana pasta dish) so they offered her a free cheesecake to go in return for her food being delayed. Her food didn't show up till the rest of us had finished our meals! ( we tried waiting for her food but it was more than a 30 min wait!) but when her food did arrive, the service after that was great. They continued to refill drinks and sang her a birthday song along with her free cheesecake they had promised her and a free birthday ice cream cup (which was mostly whip cream..but she loves whip cream so :) ) I would've given this place 4 stars if they had just hadn't made my birthday pal wait so long for her meal!"
