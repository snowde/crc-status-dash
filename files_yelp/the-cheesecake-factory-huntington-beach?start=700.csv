Elizabeth T.,"Garden Grove, CA",97,124,65,4.0,8/14/2013,"PROS: - The food is great and the portions are very generous! The presentation is nice, too. I've had the chicken marsala, grilled salmon, shrimp pasta, and calamari. - I love the ambiance of this place because of the low lighting, the low murmuring sound of people talking, and the marble floor and columns. - The waiters are pretty attentive to your needs. Even if they are constantly running around, they always stop by to ask if you need anything several times. - They give you a buzzer so you can browse the shops in the mall while you wait to be seated.  CONS: - There is usually a wait on nights and weekends that can last more than 1 hr. I don't go here for regular meals because I can't afford the time to wait. I only go here occasionally.  - It can be a little pricey here. - One time I had the shrimp pasta and it was super salty! I am someone who usually prefers to eat saltier foods, but this was even beyond me. I couldn't eat it so I sent it back. I haven't had that dish again so I don't know if that was just a fluke or it's usually that salty."
Jade C.,"Orange County, CA",1,117,51,5.0,8/9/2011,"This review is for their LUAU SALAD.  I have tried the luau salad at 4 different locations and all have been inconsistent. The luau salad at the Huntington Beach Cheesecake Factory is by far the BEST. They add more vegetables, portion is larger, and there is a tad more dressing. Odd because you would think all Cheesecake Factory's would produce the same luau salad, but there is actually a giant difference. Thumbs up to the Huntington Beach Cheese Fac!"
Ash T.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",54,24,12,4.0,8/8/2011,I really like the variety of food here. They have everything from breakfast to desserts and a lot of options within each category. Everything is reasonably priced and the food is amazing. Brown bread - sensational. only thing I didn't like was the wait time. Thee weren't many people at all but it seemed like we waited longer than days when it's busy.
Lance H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",22,373,36,1.0,12/13/2010,"F the Cheesecake Factory. Does not matter when I come in or with who, service sucks. Only way to get some service is to be pretty girl.  Waited and waited at bakery area to order cheesecake to get rid of these worthless gift cards some idiot got me. Of the two guys working, one left and the other did his best to ignore me standing 3 feet from him. Yeah go ahead and clean that dirty rag instead of acknowledge the f-ing customer.  Not the first time I have had problems at Cheesecake Factory so not an isolated event.  If I was homeless I still would not eat their food.  They do have a good patio area.  Parking is silly here."
Dan G.,"Irvine, CA",88,75,61,4.0,1/12/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, and this was my first time at this location. Shockingly, it was the best experience I've ever had at CF!!!  Great host, wonderful server, and amazing ambience on the heated, outside patio!!!  We caught it on a bust friday night, and even the 40 minute wait didn't detract from the overall experience. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio, and was completely satisfied with the preparation, presentation, and taste of the food. Mind you, I have been back to this restaurant yet, so there is a possibility that I caught it on a night where the better cooks were working....A+ in my book."
Kat S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",130,388,31,4.0,6/21/2011,"Not a bad place if you just want to hang out for a casual meal. Don't come here if you are in a hurry.  Also, if you have the opportunity, sit out on the patio... it's a whole lot more quiet out there!!  The CF menu is pretty overwhelming, so I tend to stick to the appetizers which aren't too bad.  It's great with a group to mix and match a bunch of appetizers and then do the cheesecake... yummy!   The customer service is always good at this location.  Instead of hunting for parking, take advantage of the valet parking ($4.50) that is right outside this restaurant.  My only gripe with this place is that they seem to have gotten away from the true cheescake desserts.  So many of them are mixed with cake or brownies... I just want cheesecake!!!"
Monica N.,"Alhambra, CA",395,673,443,3.0,5/12/2008,"The neighboring Starbucks is my usual location for internet first dates. I should have a table permanently reserved for me at Starbucks and here at the Cheesecake Factory because my internet dating turn-over rate is pretty high.  Sometimes I have second dates here, but they're rare.  No one has yet to move on to the elusive third date. But enough about my relationship issues...  There's always a long wait for a table here.  Partly because if it's location within the busy bustling Bella Terra. You're competing for a table with lots of movie-goers, casual shoppers and other couples who appear to be in happy committed relationships (not that I'm envious or anything..) Once you get your coveted table, you'll quickly realize that on a crowded evening it's a little diffcult to carry on a conversation. There's so much noise!  So while you're sitting there talking about your hobbies, interests and perhaps even your past relationship you realize that you're straining to be heard by your date across the table.  ""SO YEAH, WE BROKE UP BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T COMMIT....."" Hopefully by then your tuna tataki salad will arrive (my usual dish). Then the mood will lighten up *fingers crossed*.  Or perhaps you realize that you have no interest in computer programming and you promise yourself that you will no longer go on dates with engineers.  Of course, your experience here may be completely different than mine...but that tuna tataki salad is darn good."
Hoody H.,"Long Beach, CA",5,26,,4.0,12/5/2014,"I've been here several times and I almost order the same thing all the time, their chicken and biscuit. Yummmm! I never could finish it though so I end up taking it home. I've come to a conclusion that their strawberry lemonade is too sweet. Now I don't order it, so problem fixed lol"
Elizabeth O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",249,19,16,2.0,4/23/2011,"So my fiance and I decided to do a date night here since we had never been to a Cheesecake Factory and I have to say I think it'll be the one and only time we ever go back. The Ahi Carpaccio (appetizer) was AMAZING!! Even the beginning bread rolls were great. But then our server took her 30min break and the food & service went down hill from there!! The Salad came out half complete (it was a Pear Endive...but the pear, candied pecans, & cheese were all missing)! No one came out to ask and see how everything was going or if we needed refills on our drinks...NOTHING!! What I would recommend is that they have their staff take their 30min breaks before or after rush hour!! Replacement staff members never give a 100% because they know they are not walking away with the tip!! Not well managed!!"
Mouse N.,"Westminster, CA",1463,47,5,4.0,11/30/2010,I say service here is great. I've tried most of the stuff on the menu and suggestions for Fish: Miso Salmon Steak: Steak Diane Gumbo: Shrimp jambalaya Drink Non alcoholic: Strawberry Lemonade SUGGEST NOT TO EAT. HIBATCHI steak. its so bad I recommend you never to get this dish. If you haven't tried this place it is a must try.
Crystal W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",96,73,36,4.0,11/26/2010,Ok it's a chain but it's a damn good one. This is the place to go for people who have different opinions what to eat since they have a little bit of everything and I mean EVERYTHING.  The this has one of the best happy hours with $5.00 appetizers and drinks. You can eat like a King but not spend like one.  Friday and Saturday nights are busy but they handle the crowds well and efficiently.  Just an overall good place to go!
Nicole D.,"Torrance, CA",339,211,345,3.0,3/21/2013,"good, consistent, nice bar selection. Love the fish lunch specials"
Cheri W.,"Dallas, TX",23,128,48,4.0,5/16/2013,"What would have made our dining better? A hello from the manager!  With that said, our host Marissa was on point, professional yet friendly. Espresso, caramel pecan turtle cheesecake, fish & chips, mac 'n cheeseburger, yeah, NICE."
Eunice R.,"Los Alamitos, CA",1,26,,4.0,1/29/2013,"4.5 stars! Our waitress was AMAZING. After reading so many bad reviews about the service here, I went all anxious and worried, but oh man, she was amazing. She checked up on us every time our glasses were empty, and asked us how our food was. Very very nice waitress. The food was good, but it was a little bit heavy. We got the Thai Lettuce Wraps, Bistro Shrimp pasta, and buffalo wings (?). It was okay, but sort of expensive for the amount you get.  The cheesecake. We got the godiva chocolate cheesecake, and it was fabulous. amazing. You could taste the chocolate in your mouth at every bite. So so so good. The cheesecakes here are amazing. I would definitely come here just for the cheesecake."
Karey R.,"Seal Beach, CA",128,621,635,4.0,2/12/2009,"Do I have to review The Cheesecake Factory? I mean...it's a pretty common place, it's like reviewing my local Taco Bell. Oh well, I'll do it anyway. I like the Huntington Beach location better than the Redondo Beach location. The staff is a lot less snooty. Of course, you are giving up the possible view you could get in Redondo Beach.  Anyway, here is a list of my favorites:  Crispy Taquitos Crab Wontons Crabcake Sandwich Jambalaya Pasta Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake Brownie Sundae Cheesecake I wouldn't leave without a slice of cheesecake, whether it's to go or in your tummy. After all, it is the Cheesecake factory. The parking can be tricky here, also the wait could be long. One of us usually hops out and puts out name in while the other one parks in the structure."
Jane D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/5/2012,"I stopped by on a Thursday afternoon ( 4pm) to pick up a cheese cake to go. I figured since it's not during peak time so it should be a quick turnaround. I was wrong. The service was so slow and I didn't get what I ordered.  Seriously....how can you messed up a request for ""just strawberries topping no whipped cream""??!?? It took them about 45 minutes to give me my order eventho' there was only one customer ahead of me....the girl behind the counter did show me the cake and asked if it was ok, but I was running late and didn't want to wait around for another 45 minutes so I just took it and left. I was going to try their restaurant but this experience puts me off. Would not recommend this location to my friends or co-workers."
Jessica A.,"Long Beach, CA",133,413,71,2.0,2/24/2011,"I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but some friends wanted to meet here for lunch so I thought I'd give it a try. We were seated promptly. Our server, took one persons drink order, then walked away. Returned with a drink, then I jumped in and ordered a drink, ""sure, no problem"" but then walked away again before getting drink requests from the rest of the group. Not cool.  The drink, some strawberry boozy concoction was amazing.  Food was ok, I had some pasta thing that I picked out of their literally 13 page menu, and it was tasty enough.  I really enjoyed the real/fresh parmesan cheese.  I had a strawberry shortcake for dessert, everyone else had cheesecake and we were all happy....that is until the people seated directly behind us got their overly fishy smelling fish entree which permeated the air, making everything else taste fishy. Mango/Keylime/fishy cheesecake isn't awesome. Whatever, they can order what they want, but did they really need to be seated RIGHT behind us in the totally deserted restaurant?  Then, the shocker. Lunch for 4 people was $140. Food was ok, service was ok, drinks were ok, but not a hundred and forty friggen dollars ok.  Also, after we finished eating and paid, I stopped into the bakery to pick up a cheesecake my mom had requested. Sure, no problem, they charged my card, I stood around for 10 minutes until a manager told me they didn't have the kind I wanted. They refunded my card and gave me a slice of what they did have for free, so ok,,fine. Although I don't know if the free slice of cheesecake was intentional or not, either way, after a $40 per person after tax/tip meal, I'll take my $7 slice free, thanks.  Bottom line, for mediocre food, I'll go elsewhere. For cheesecake, I'll go to Costco."
Jake N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/28/2013,I called 3 times for a take out order the first call I waited 6 minutes then decided to call back the boy who answered didn't even address themselves as cheesecake factory and said please hold before I even got a chance to speak then waited 5 more minutes finally someone answered and put me on hold again! After finally making my order they didn't even greet me and it was a manager up front needless to say it was the second time this happened your store lacks in a lot of things
NG Y.,"Huntington Beach, CA",120,72,19,5.0,4/30/2013,"Probably my favorite restaurant! Everything is just amazing.. Food, service, drinks, atmosphere, and cheesecakes!!"
Tim M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/13/2015,"We went to the reception desk at 4 pm today., they took our name and said it would be a 5 minute wait. Never looked at us; kept walking away and not responding....when asked at the 10 minute mark if we would be seated we were told no because they had to balance tables and waiters. I understand but there were at least half the seats open and we were dealt with in  manner we felt antiseptic, curt and certainly non-informative.  A tip:manager should step in and train staff in customer service? We really wanted to eat there...but after 15 minutes we gave up and left. Very disappointing customer service. Totally indifferent attitude. And the place was half empty!  4 o'cock on a Tuesday and you cannot be seated or treated with a sense of at least apology for the wait?"
