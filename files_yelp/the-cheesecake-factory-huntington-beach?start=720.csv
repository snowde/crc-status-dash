Marie F.,"Fountain Valley, CA",22,123,37,4.0,7/27/2013,"I have two words for you- HAPPY HOUR.  It is THE best.  Good food, bread and drinks for such a good price.  My hubby and I get our little getaway on at Cheesecake.  We love the buffalo wraps, the calamari, sliders, ahi...oh hell, we like it all!  We LOVE the happy hour prices which are 1/2 off.  We always skip the cheesecake and get the chocolate mousse fudge cake which is SO good.  We even have enough for leftovers for the kids for dinner!  Check it out!"
J J.,"Westminster, CA",1,79,5,3.0,5/29/2011,"I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for years now.  Never had a ""bad"" experience before. In fact, it is usually pretty good. Today, not so much. I am without husband and kids for the weekend (I have to work) so I decided to treat myself to a little shopping (bought stuff for the kids, of course) and brunch. Since I was by myself, I headed to the bar, eager for a glass of champagne, eggs benedict, and reading my book. The bartender greeted me immediately. I asked her what she like and the first thing she said was the benedict with spinach, bacon and tomatoes. I took her suggestion, ordered my champagne and opened my Kindle. Food came out about 10 minutes later.  Potatoes were nice and hot and the eggs were cooked to perfection (I order them poached medium because I don't like them too runny). Only problem was that the were COLD (gross!). I let the bartender know and she was apologetic. She told the manager who also came over to apologize and assured me the next order would be hot.  So about 10 minutes went by and the new plate of food arrives. Potatoes were hot, eggs were warm and way too runny. I chose not to say anything because it really did taste good. Then I noticed that the tomatoes that menu describes as 'grilled' were raw. Again, I chose not to say anything because I like raw tomatoes. I take another bite and realize something is missing. THE BACON!! I bring it to the bartender attention and again she is apologizing. She orders a side of bacon, but by the time I get it, I am almost done and my eggs are cold. I still add it to a few more bites and admit it tasted even better. A little too late, though. The manager comps my meal and the bartender keeps apologizing. But it really is not the end of the world. I enjoyed my food (overall), the champagne was yummy, and I got to eat in peace and quiet without having to tell my kids to hurry up and eat. The bartender gave great service (she deserves 5 stars!) and I felt bad 'complaining'  because I know she was busy. The 3 stars had nothing to do with her - just the kitchen. So with that being said, I know I will be back. I just hope I enjoy my next visit a little bit more.  :)"
Melissa L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",26,137,,4.0,11/23/2010,"Look, haters can hate all they want, but I really like the Cheesecake Factory.   Here's why: 1.  HUGE Menu.  There is something for everyone in your group, or there is something new to try anytime you go.  I am especially liking the 'small plates' section of the menu.  The beets and goat cheese in really good.  (See later comment about this one...) 2.  Competent service.  I don't recall ever going to a Cheesecake Factory and having a completely useless server.  They are friendly and usually very on the ball.   3.  Quality.  Yes they have a giant menu, but the thing is, they get it right.  Food is cooked well and doesn't taste like it just came off the foodservice truck.  (It might have, for all I know, but they do a good job of fooling me if it does.) 4.  The Cheesecake.  I mean, holy God.  My all-time fave is the pumpkin-pecan.  How can this be so good?  If I knew how to make this at home, I would be at least 20 pounds heavier.   Are they overpriced?  Yes.   On a side note, I have gotten the beet and goat cheese small plate in the past and I feel like the one I got on this last trip was waaaay smaller that it has been.  So, I don't know if this is the trend for all of these items, but I hope not.   Also, the BF and I both got burgers on this trip and they were both AWESOME.  I highly recommend the Farm Boy Burger.  Out of control."
Lilli S.,"Long Beach, CA",148,96,,2.0,3/19/2010,"Oh no! Your having a business lunch, or a first date, or getting dragged along with your group of friends that don't know any better to the CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!  AHHHHHHHH!!!!  I know, I know, it sounds horrible, but trust me, you don't have to cancel your lunch meeting, tell your date your busy washing your hair or spend the night wishing you had smarter friends, but you do have to order smart; considering the menu is like a freaking encyclopedia with advertisements, its not always easy. Make sure to refer to yelp reviews should you start to feel nervous.  I'm no fan of Cheesecake Factory or its sister restaurant Grand Lux Cafe, but I'm also not a fan of being Debbie Downer I cant eat there super snob. Whenever I'm forced to partake at these not so fine establishments, I follow one rule:  Keep it simple  The only things I order here are the guacamole with chips. Shockingly the guacamole is pretty fresh. The Tuna Tataki Salad, the tuna is only lightly seared, and completely pink in the middle, so you know it wasn't bathed in preservatives before taking a months long sabbatical in your restaurants freezer. Not even the wizards behind deep fried macaroni balls have come up with a way to make frozen tuna look fresh......for now. If neither of those options sound appealing just be a fatty and/or a drunk and order deserts and/or drinks only. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is actually pretty good, I think Godiva must hold them to some higher standards.  The one thing you definitely under no circumstances order is the cashew chicken. Once you've eaten it, your committed to tasting it for at least the next 4 days. No amount of tooth brushing, extra strength Listerine, Clorox, oxyclean, engine degreaser, chemical peels, oral ablation or just straight acid will remove that taste from your mouth. Its punishment I think for eating at Cheesecake factory in the first place."
Michael A.,"Buena Park, CA",24,105,50,2.0,7/30/2012,Cheesecake sounds so good right now. But it's out of my reach now cause I'll gain 10 pounds after eating one slice. Now the restaurant it's not what I expect. The food is very expensive and does not have enough portions.
Donald S.,"Glendora, CA",141,357,339,4.0,3/19/2013,Consistenlty great food and service at reasonable price in an excellent atmosphere.
Minerva T.,"Pflugerville, TX",236,331,1844,4.0,12/31/2010,"I like going to Cheesecake Factory but I definitely made a special trip because I read that they had peppermint bark cheesecake in season. It was fantastic! The bread here is always great. I am a sucker for sourdough but have also been won over by the honey wheat they have as well. Their complimentary slices are warm and have great crustiness. The sourdough is not too sour either. If you're a lover of sweeter breads, try the honey wheat. Well actually, since they bring out however much you want, try both! The only problem is that you might get full eating the bread since it's so good - save yourself for all of the food that will come though! To feel fancy, I decided that I'd have myself a cocktail. Now, I'm not a big fan of vodka only because it's pretty much in everything. I mean, I don't hate it - I just don't prefer it, especially if I'm going to pay handsomely for a drink. This cut down my choices on the menu considerably but I did eventually find something to quench my thirst: the Blackjack Martini. It even sounds cool! It was basically a Manhattan with blackberry and Jack Daniel's. I found it quite tasty and hardly noticeable in terms of alcohol taste. My only quibble with this drink was that it was much too expensive. Generally restaurants don't put the prices on the menu for drinks, but from what I've seen, they range from $6-$8 or so at casual-type restaurants. That was my guess. You can imagine my surprise when $11.50 appeared on the bill. I was disappointed in the price and now know not to have a cocktail at Cheesecake Factory again. My friend's Red Raspberry Martini was the same price for a smaller quantity I believe. After much scrutiny of the menu (so many choices), I finally opted for the Bistro Shrimp Pasta dish, which has battered shrimp, mushrooms, tomato, and arugula mixed with spaghettini in a basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. It came in at $16.95 for the dish, a bit hefty but in the general price range for the pasta dishes. If you ordered this and expected crispy shrimp, you'd be disappointed because the shrimp was a bit soft. I didn't' mind though and actually preferred it; it was more fitting for the dish. I loved the inclusion of the fresh vegetables, especially the arugula. The spaghettini was prepared to just the right texture for pasta - cooked thoroughly but with enough hardness left in it to give you something to chew on; I guess it's what you would call ""al dente,"" or ""to the teeth"" in Italian. I'm a spaghettini and angel hair lover when it comes to noodle-y pastas, so this was a great choice for me. As for the sauce, it definitely made the whole entree worthwhile. I was wary of its advertisement as a cream sauce but the lemon made it light and delicious. I felt like the arugula was complemented well by the garlicky sauce. The portion was too much for me to have but I didn't mind taking it home for some more eating later. The whole reason for going - Peppermint Bark Cheesecake (a white chocolate cheesecake swirled with chunks of chocolate peppermint bark and topped with white chocolate mousse and finished with chopped peppermint). Though we were nearly popping our pants' buttons from the abundance of deliciousness we had, there was room to finish this off. Of course, my two friends and I shared this because we were afraid we wouldn't be able to handle individual slices. It was FANTASTIC. Unlike some of their cheesecakes there (I sure have tried a lot), this one was not too heavy. It's possible that that was an illusion caused by the inclusion of peppermint but either way, it did not make us stop after the first bite. The creaminess of the body was light enough to suggest that it had been whipped up a few times. The chocolate crust had been softened by the slice itself, and I could hardly taste it with all of the mint. I think the topping of the cheesecake with bits of peppermint was great, giving something to break with one's teeth and also to highlight the peppermint swirls in the cheese part itself. My only complaint is that they don't have this cheesecake year-round - I would surely buy it many times!"
James M.,"Seal Beach, CA",166,56,1,5.0,4/27/2013,We only eat there during Happy Hour.  $5 well drinks and half off apps.
Lauren M.,"Irvine, CA",240,145,6,4.0,6/24/2010,"No matter when you go, there's always a wait at The Cheesecake Factory. Most of the time it's not worth the wait but sometimes I'm in the mood for the Chinese Chicken Salad, so I wait it out. That being said, this Cheesecake Factory isn't very different from any of the others. Same menu, large dining area. Service is random, depending on what kind of server you get, it can be fast or it can be a really slow dinner. I highly recommend the Vietnamese Spring Rolls and the Chinese Chicken Salad. My sister always gets the garlic noodles and those are really good too."
Kate J.,"Long Beach, CA",2,28,4,4.0,9/12/2010,"Always enjoy myself when I hit up the CF. I could just order up a big plate of the avocado eggrolls and big slice of the 30th anniversary cheesecake and be a very happy girl. The atmosphere is great. The staff is usually very on top of their game. You can't go wrong with a 200 item menu. I've recently become a fan of their cashew chicken salad. Lovin the new addiction of the ""small bites"" menu. I basically wanna order all of the small bites every time I go. Yummy yummy!"
Cathy N.,"Westminster, CA",84,156,13,5.0,1/17/2011,"I live within a five-mile radius from here, but have never been to this restaurant before. On Sunday's noontime, friend and I decided to go for lunch. I got the pasta marinara with Parmesan cheese mixed in. Then I got some more grated on top. What a guilty pleasure. After looking at the nutritional facts booklet, this has the lowest calories. However, I probably killed myself with the cheesiness.  My friend got the Chipotle chicken pasta. SO GOOD. A hint of spice and a decent amount of peas, chicken, green beans/asparagus, zucchinis. The service was excellent, bread was unlimited, food was fantastic. The only problem I have is the whopping calories within the dishes! I'll probably come here occasionally .."
Bridgette A.,"San Clemente, CA",81,270,,4.0,1/16/2011,"My hubby and I had a lunch date here today after my class at Corepower yoga. We wanted to watch the end of the NFL playoff game, so we opted to sit at the bar--not IN the bar area, but physically AT the bar. We didn't get any alcoholic bevies, and felt a little bad, but the two bartenders were fabulous and didn't make us feel weird at all. We did get a raspberry lemonade (SUPER tasty but very sweet) and passion fruit iced tea (pretty  much the BEST iced tea I've ever had).  We decided to share 2 lunch specials--the thai pasta and the barbeque ranch chicken salad. The salad was super fresh and cold--tasted delicious on a nice day like today. The pasta was good, but hubby ate it first so by the time I got it, it was more of the bottom of the pasta, and there was too much sauce. I liked the bean sprouts for a nice crunch, tho, and overall it was tasty. The lunch portions were huge! More than enough for a hungry person, and we both left feeling full. Sometimes when you sit at the bar the service sucks, but that was definitely not the case here. The bartenders were great--friendly, attentive, and our food came out quickly. I wish I always got great service like this when sitting at a restaurant bar! We walked out of there with a total of about $35, for lunch for 2 with two non-alcoholic bevies and 2 lunch portions of food... including tax and tip. Not horrible. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because that is reserved for places that are amazing and blow me away--which this did not. It certainly was good though, and I'm happy to know there's a Cheesecake Factory so close to me :)."
Christina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,32,2,4.0,1/10/2013,"I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory a 4. 5 for the service, but a 3 for the food.  I've eaten here a few times, but have never written a review before. This trip sparked a need to write a review. Our server, Andre, was exceptional, attentive, and happy, but not overbearing.  The only complaints and issues I have are with the food. I ordered the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles.'"" With a name like that, I expected a few pieces of a spicy breaded friend chicken.  When another server brought out the PLATTER, I was blown away. It was a platter of fried chicken tenders enough to feed 4 people; it was more like a giant appetizer for a table of people. You get your monies worth with the portion size, but the ""cajun"" chicken had no cajun flavor at all. Big thumbs down. KFC chicken has more flavor than the ""Cajun Chicken 'Littles!'""  Even the honey mustard dipping sauce was weak. I love chicken tenders, but I really wanted something with a kick. The mashed potatoes, which they serve without gravy, were also on the bland and boring side, and to top this off the mashed potatoes were COLD. I had to ask the server to bring me another serving which ended up being warmer than the cold mashed potatoes, but not much warmer than room temp. Sad face. Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake was good though."
Christine J.,"Tulsa, OK",30,205,27,4.0,6/28/2008,"My boyfriend and I went here after donating blood and needed some energy because the free cookies wouldn't suffice. ;) He said they had huge servings. He wasn't fucking kidding.  It wasn't crowded on a Friday afternoon. We were seated promptly. They asked if we wanted outside or inside and I wish we'd chose outside because it was a nice day and there was a fountain with tables and umbrellas. The inside decor is interesting, with it's ceiling's painted. The atomosphere was pleasant and the staff were friendly.    There are so many things to choose from the menu! Agh! I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken tortillas. The first bite was heaven; sweet and spicy, tangy and robust, I think my mouth orgasmed. The coconut and chile complimented each other. I let him try it and he didn't want to eat his own food! That's ok because I got kind of sick (as in glutinously enjoying it) after eating half of it and gave the rest to him, the swine. He insisted we didn't need to take anything home.  I love dessert but was too full to try any cheesecake. I wouldn't know what to choose. I think next time we'll go and order coffee and a cheesecake though. Probably the Dulce de Leche."
Jody B.,"Westminster, CA",1,45,2,4.0,11/5/2013,"If you have a big group of people and cannot choose what type of food you feel like having Cheesecake factory is the place to go.  They have asian, american, and mexican dishes.  Something for everyone.  Not to mention the dessert is delicious."
Lynn H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",136,57,,2.0,1/8/2010,"No matter what day, or what time you go here, there is going to be a wait, annoying! Once you do get seated, the people next you are literally a foot away, annoying! The calamari was a bit too greasy. Husband had Breaded Chicken & Potatoes, and that's really all there was on his plate, a piece of chicken and a scoop of potatoes.. kind of plain. I had the Factory Chicken Salad. I really liked it. Not too much dressing, good portion of chopped chicken, and lots of bacon. Apple Martini was really sour, and the Jack and water was really watered down. Food and drinks are way too over priced!! I couldn't believe that was a $100 dinner. I would have gone somewhere else if I knew that was the case."
Kim N.,"Orange County, CA",64,83,238,4.0,2/4/2014,"Took my dad here for his birthday dinner because he'd been wanting to try this place out for a while but my mom was always against it. Since she's on vacation, we decided to go together. We ordered the wings as our appetizer and the shrimp scampi to share for our entree. The portions are a good size...not too big and not too small. We weren't too hungry that night so it was the perfect size to share. We also got the white chocolate raspberry cheese cake. Mmm soo good! My dad told me that I could have it all because he wasn't a big fan of cheesecake but the next morning, the entire slice was gone! The food is pricey but it's actually pretty good. I was very impressed with the customer service. Our waitress was really nice and quiet but attentive and generous. Overall, a good experience! Oh also, there dark bread is really really really addicting! It's honey wheat or something, but it's the best!"
Debby L.,"Atlanta, GA",1296,1143,1258,4.0,7/12/2008,"I have to say, I'm a fan. It's very American (i.e. very sweet and caramelized), but it's good. I have to split everything with at least one other person, but mostly everything is tasty and delectable.  My favorite staples are: 1) Chicken Madeira (this dish is WONDERFUL if you substitute Mahi Mahi instead of the chicken). The caramelized sauce tastes delicious with the fish. I usually tell the waitress I want the MAHI MAHI Madeira and they give me this confused look at first .. and then curiosity. Most of them order it to try afterwards, and have told me that this is their new favorite dish here. The downside: sometimes they charge you a lot for the substitution. If you get a nice server, they'll just leave the price as is. 2) BLT Salad. I always substitute the bacon dressing with Ranch dressing.  I'm not a big fan of lettuce, but this salad is surprisingly refreshing. Since its not a heavy salad, but just an appetizer dish, I love splitting this salad and the Mahi Mahi Madeira with my boyfriend. It's the perfect size meal for two.  3) White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake is my favorite dessert here. The others tend to be too rich for me, but this one goes perfectly with some English Breakfast tea.  4) Sangria:  I never thought I'd like the Sangria here. A bunch of us got drinks after a final, and maybe I was delirious from studying, but this Sangria was surprisingly good.  5) Mojito: Doesn't compare to Mercedes Grill at all, but still quite good. Lots of mint,  well done.  Don't Get:  1) California Omelet: bland bland bland. Too thick and dry.  2) Thai Chicken Pasta: go to a Thai restaurant if you want Thai food. This is way too sweet, thick, and just not good."
Gina D.,"Los Angeles, CA",458,224,25,1.0,12/29/2009,"I worked at Cheesecake Factory before. I've been to many different locations also. I ALWAYS order the Pasta Da Vinci and I am NEVER disappointed by it. I KNOW my Pasta D.V. until I came to the Bella Terra location. I ordered my usual Pasta D.V and one bite into it, I was so disappointed. You see, The Pasta DV is made with a Madeira Wine Sauce...Thats the best part of the whole thing! Unfortunately, this time, they practically put NO SAUCE in it. It was bland and it tasted like boiled pasta and oil...thats it. It was awful. Sorry, guys, but you guys gotta fix this before I give you a better rating =/"
Christi Lynn C.,"Newport Beach, CA",532,167,343,2.0,1/31/2010,"Really 2 and a half Stars.  So I have been to Cheesecake Factory's everywhere but this is the one I end up at the most. I live in HB and the Bella Terra location just happens to be next to the movie theater.   This location is particularly crowded all the time.  Last night my girlfriend and I just happen to get lucky and swoop a table in the bar otherwise the wait was about an hour for 2.  My favorite thing about this place is their Strawberry Martini They are so delicious but you pay up the you know what for them.  $11.25. I just think that's a lot for a chain and its not like we are even in LA .  The food is blahhh but the menu is huge so its a good place to come and know that everyone will find something they like. Last night I ordered a Caesar Salad, no croutons with grilled shrimp. My salad came and had no croutons or cheese. Haha. No big deal.  The server brought the cheese and I was good to go.  I also ordered a side salad and he brought me the large one.  Again not a big deal. Except for the fact that he charged me $11 for the salad and an additional $7 for the shrimp. And again no big deal. Just seemed like a lot for the Cheesecake Factory. The service has always been friendly and last night was no exception. Although our server complained to us that they had an early staff meeting at 8am and that he was fried.  Ummmm, Okay?  Then he kept saying ""Ohhhhh. I forgot to bring your alcohol"" (in reference to my martini.  Way to make a girl feel like a lush.  Hahaha. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory is perfectly passable. Opps, I did forget to mention the Cheesecake. It is delicious.  The raspberry truffle is out of control!"
