Beth H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",279,300,151,2.0,3/6/2010,"I just don't understand the continual line out the door at all hours of the day or night for this place. I admit.....the lemondrops are to die for. The salmon is cooked perfectly. The wasabi mashed potatoes are rockin'. This place is really freaking expensive for what it is, though. Yes it's good, but it's not THAT good. I'd rather spend my $100 + bucks somewhere else like a Mom & Pop joint that I truly enjoy, with a friendly, inviting atmosphere instead of a chain restaurant with an unreasonably long wait, deafening noise, such close quarters with other patrons and wait staff that seems to not really know what they are doing or why they are there. Parking is a nightmare and I feel like I'm in the middle of a can of sardines while I'm stacked up waiting for my table. Thanks, but no thanks."
Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1251,506,242,4.0,12/29/2009,"Good Lord do I love a great burger! I regularly........ well, maybe once a month or so, stop at this CF location on my way back from Los Angeles on business, or will take a Huntington Beach or Fountain Valley client here for lunch.  Today I shared lunch with a client, and from some primal place deep in my ""Alma"" (that's ""soul"" in both Spanish and Portuguese) had this driving desire for a really focused, basic, cheeseburger! Why am I giving 4-stars to CFHB (Cheesecake Factory Huntington Beach) today? Because I ordered the ""Classic-Original Burger"", and added what I believe make any great burger greater... carmelized onions, fresh avocado slices, and bacon....... in addition to the melted chedder, it came with tomato and lettuce on the side. I added the tomato back in, but didn't add in the lettuce.  The burger meat by itself was at least 1/3 pound, maybe a little more. I ordered my burger medium rare, and it was! PLUS...... CFHB must grill on an open flame grate, because the outside was chared with a wonderful crusty, smoke-char flavor, and the meat tasted like great burger meat. (cheap burgers sometimes don't have any flavor at all).  I'm going to try this again at our local Mission Viejo location. My bet is, if all CF locations follow the same prep and use the same grill, the burger will again rank up there with one of the best I've ever had; mid 80's...... Hamburger Hamlet, Pasadena. Damn..... now THAT was one char-grilled delicious burger, and that's my gold standard for taste. I'm saying that today's sandwich was a clean 7 out of 10, given that 10 = my Pasadena experience. On to my next ""greatest burger search."""
Holly C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",186,320,980,5.0,1/15/2012,"One of my all-time favorite restaurants! I never have as hard of time ordering at any other restaurant like I do here. The menu is like a magazine! To many choices for my brain to deal with.....Do I want American...Mexican...Hungarian! They have it all. The Fish Tacos are amazing! The Orange Chicken is delicious. Chicken enchiladas are great! And probably one of my favorite meals I've ever had here is the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp! SO GOOD and the name is catchy to - sometimes it pops in my head for no reason at all haha. The food is amazing and the servers are always super nice (Never had a bad one yet) and out of all the times I've come here I've only had one meal that I didn't like and that was the Teriyaki Chicken, It was just way to sweet for my taste. If you have an indecisive mind like me go to their website and look over the menu before you even get there, otherwise you will be there for an hour just deciding what to order and the waitress will come back and ask you if your ready 12 times before you finally decide on what to order.......Yeah that happened to me."
Linda S.,"Lakewood, CA",56,172,18,4.0,12/12/2010,Love the small plates.  Order just a few and share with a friend.  The Arugula salad and the beet salad with goat cheese were both quite good. I always eat too much to be able to order cheesecake.
Kim l.,"Santa Clara, CA",595,1236,897,4.0,9/7/2008,"Update:10/11/8 Bf and I got some cheesecake take out yesterday. I got the lemoncello torte. It was a big ole slice. Very very yummy. I love lemon anything! Bf got the blueberry cheesecake...we gonna eat that today. Can't wait! Cheesecake factory has some very yummy desserts for sure! Double dated at cheesecake last night. Bella Terra is so beautiful at night. I got my renee special (chicken salad sandwhich, soup, salad), bf got the shrimp bistro pasta(very flavorful however very heavy and filling), and the other couple shared the cajun pasta. My dish was very tasty, but I was so full I only had a couple spoonfuls of my soup. We all shared a yummy tiramisu for dessert. My lemonade was a tad sweet. Our waitress was very nice and efficient."
Jolili Q.,"Long Beach, CA",1,50,34,3.0,4/20/2013,"Sadly, this may be the last time i dine in here or any cheesecake factory.  I use to LOVE this place, but my experience today was not the very best. My service was ok, and the food was ok as well...  * * * * I got the steak diane and herb salmon.. If i knew i was getting 4 pint size a little bigger than a dollar coin size steak, and that my salmon was gonna be covered what look like algae, i wouldnt have order it.. I ate it anyway, with no complaint.. I would've enjoy it more if they seasoned my brocolini and asparagus.  By the end of the night, i still didnt know my servers name. He was the tall guy with glasses.."
Stacey B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",103,79,6,3.0,7/14/2012,Cheesecake Factory is one if those stand by places where everyone is guaranteed to find something they like. They have a huge menu to choose from. Portions are really big and some dishes can be pretty salty but for a chain restaraunt their food quality is pretty good. I like the Bella Terra location the service is always friendly and prompt.
Shannon F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",30,152,67,4.0,4/26/2010,"Friday night... packed... long wait for a table indoors, so we decided to eat on the patio with the heaters. It wasn't that bad, left side was warmer than the right, but I had my jacket.  Now I dont usually come here for the dinner portions, just the drinks and of course (the name implies) the cheesecake. I had a Georgia Peach cocktail, some kind of pasta (it was ok, not mind blowing or even worth remembering) and the dolce de leche cheesecake. (Gawd my mouth just watered while typing that cake out)  The server-chick was cool. Told us her take on the ""dessert before dinner"" and how she totally approves... as do I! And we also had a common interest in chocolate as well."
Thao V.,"Long Beach, CA",88,36,45,2.0,1/6/2013,The girl who spoke to us on the phone was beyond rude. This location is way too busy. The wait is usually an hour. Food is decent. Their Alfredo with sun dried tomatoes is good. Veggie burger is disgusting. I'd go to another location if I wanted Cheesecake Factory.
Nina B.,"Long Beach, CA",289,140,4,3.0,11/24/2012,"The only thing I really enough here is the cheesecake. The food is okay and service is lacking. Come before dinner time. The wait is bad. Also, valentines day here was packed and the wait is about 2 hours or more long."
CJ J.,"Irvine, CA",1367,1047,570,3.0,2/6/2008,"Always busy as you'd expect and parking here sucks.  Service is always a hit or miss. I've been here with 20 ppl and with 2 ppl and it just does not matter. I always get the Tuna Tataki Salad with the dressing on the side and IT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!  Get that, some coffee, a cheesecake, eat all of the salad and a bite or two of cheesecake and it's the PERFECT meal! Take the cheesecake home with some extra whip cream of course. :)"
Craig B.,"Carpinteria, CA",33,92,132,3.0,4/7/2013,Busy with average food... and the cheesecake is not as good as it used to be.... not the Cheesecake Factory I expected. Perhaps they're too big now.
Dave R.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/25/2013,"Have had the chance to visit Cheesecake Factory's all over the USA. And what I tell everyone is the consistency is unbelievable!  Well hit the wall here took some family that has never had the pleasure to dine here and so sorry to report bad service, bad food just all around not up to the Cheesecake Factory standards I have had before. Really sorry to say it but its true......"
Kate K.,"Costa Mesa, CA",185,428,62,3.0,4/4/2011,"If you've never been before, you should go just to check out the giant picture book of a menu. their cheesecake is great, but super rich, but great, but suuuper rich... but great. I always leave here feeling like a freakin' blimp, so I don't eat here often, but when I do the food is good and the portions are giant (not a good combination if you're on a diet, so be warned!) Anyway, try it out and see if you like it--it's one of those places where there's usually something for everyone."
Roark H.,"Los Alamitos, CA",31,31,,4.0,4/1/2013,Classic and consistent. Menu can be a bit redundant and tried to add depth by adding multitudes of very similar variations with different side dishes. This can be a bit annoying but sides are interchangeable. Overall it's a great restaurant.
David M.,"Yelm, WA",3,24,20,5.0,3/18/2013,"Large portions! We split a meal, but not the cheese cake."
TT T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",94,158,7,3.0,5/20/2012,"I had a less than perfect experience here tonight, mainly due to the server. He was slow both mentally and physically, got my drink order wrong, couldn't give us any recommendations (""everything here is ordered equally""), had the personality of a left toe, and I just felt so unlucky to have been assigned such a dismally lame waiter. On the plus side, the restaurant is big and has a nice patio and it was beautiful to sit outside on a nice day. All their cheesecakes are superior."
T C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",10,372,,3.0,10/15/2012,I recently tried the miso salmon w/ brown rice lunch portion ($10) and was thoroughly satisfied w/ the dish and the portion.  I'd order it again.
Jane B.,"Los Alamitos, CA",59,74,12,1.0,6/17/2013,After my last experience I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager.  I had told him about our negative experience and how disappointed we were with the service we received.  He apologized over and over again and took down my contact information and said he was going to send me a gift certificate as their way of regaining my business......two weeks and nothing from him..... Too many other good options...won't be back.
sara b.,"Long Beach, CA",94,24,,5.0,1/3/2011,"The wait gets crazy for dinner so go early! I lalala looooove this place & I will make the drive out if I have to!  So in love with their Red Velvet Cheesecake :] BOOOOMB!!! It's a nice place to have a birthday gathering or go on a date. Casual dress, but I always like to look nice :]"
