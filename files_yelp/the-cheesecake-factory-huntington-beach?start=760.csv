Cheryl L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,23,,1.0,10/25/2014,Went in for Happy Hour with a group of 10 on a Thurs evening at 5pm.  The bar was completely full so we asked if we could get Happy Hour in the dining room or patio. Both of which were empty. They said no so we went over to Bondi Grill and sat on their beautiful patio and enjoyed their Happy Hour. Won't go back to The Cheesecake Factory!!
Sadia C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",296,321,100,4.0,10/1/2010,"This specific location is my favorite! why? outstanding customer service each time! Its so hard to get good customer service lately -_- so i appreciate that this place is consistently great with service. Food: I have had many dishes from here and they are all good, not great. Only a few dishes here are actually really good. The complimentary bread served before your meal is amazinggggg. Cheesecakes are delicious, of course :) (esp the white chocolate raspberry, the tuxedo, the sundae and the dulce de leche). Price:  This place is a bit pricier than others because portions here are huge, so its worth it in the end."
Emily N.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,11,1,2.0,8/21/2014,"Cheesecake Factory used to be my favorite. I come here all the time and as the years go by I can totally see how customer service and quality of food has gone down. Servers usually never smile, food takes forever to come out..... I just feel like Cheesecake Factory has lost its value"
James T.,"Orange County, CA",210,150,12,4.0,9/6/2010,Nice spot to wine n dine. They have something for everyone. Try the Steak Diane and Herb Crusted Salmon combo for two to share.
Eugine Y.,"Westminster, CA",423,310,141,3.0,9/11/2009,"Any place that sings ""happy birthday to you"" on the day that commemorates your birth automatically sucks, but you already knew that.  It's situated in the otherwise useless Bella Terra. You've seen their menus right?  Them s#its remind me the of Nascar with all their sponsors and whatnot on/in them.  You can't frickin' turn a page in their catalogue of a menu without seeing an ad for diamond rings or gazebos to put in your backyard or even ads for a realtor that I'm sure isn't making a dime nowadays. How'd I end up here?  Well, after hours of deliberation my senses and I were completely watered down, so we ended up here.  This what happens when it's late and all your other go-to joints are closed for the night.  Don't get me wrong.  I've frequented CCF's, but they're never my first choice.  Although, nothing I've had is bad, nothing I've had turns me on to the point where I have had to adjust my pants in the crotch region to make room for a you-know-what ;) Our server this last time was Jeff.  Yes, Jeff with his style-at-the-time emo hair cut was quite the friendly and upbeat fellow.  So friendly it was downright annoying.   So friendly I wanted to take my fist to his face.  You ever get that feeling when you order and the server says, ""oh excellent choice"", that he's just BS'ing you?  And even if you decided on the liver and onions, he'd be all ""oh, that is quite the exquisite choice, sir"".  I feel bad, cuz he was a cool @ss kid, but whatever, whachu-on-do-eh?  Now take your skinny jean wearing @ss and get me some of that complimentary sourdough! Well, we ended up with stuff off their new smaller-cheaper-wannabe-tapas-section.  Their southern fried chicken sliders were what I needed in my life!  I thought Paula Dean had made them.  I tip my hat to you CCF.  Everything else was mediocre including the stuffed mushrooms that looked more like hardboiled egg yolks.  Also, I'm not a fan of FuFu drinks, but I must say, their Georgia Peach drink looks like a peach and is quite pleasing.  Still though, I stuck to my Sapporo beer and handed the GF her drink back.  Unwillingly, but I had to keep my manhood intact ;) I'm not a Cheesecakeologist, so I'm no expert on the subject on Cheescakeology.  I will say this though, their carrot cake cheesecake is pretty damn good.  No BS.  You know how I do, I come correct with the praise. What I am though, is a sneaker fanatic.  I can't help but stare at the dirty@ss sneakers that used to be white that they wear.  Look at them next time. They'll amaze you. But yeah yeah yeah, they're workin' so it's cool. Once you're done with your meal, there's really no where else to go besides Barnes and Noble to get your free read on.  Don't go towards the movie theatre unless you are a fan of lame@ss teenagers wearing skinny jeans that hang halfway down their @ss.   Straight up real talk."
Andi N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",59,109,,4.0,8/30/2012,"Good, clean, typical cheesecake factory. My favorite is the miso salmon;) Amazing cheesecake too, of course!"
Leslie B.,"Long Beach, CA",39,68,4,4.0,11/16/2009,"My friends and I came here straight after a butt kicking yoga session at Core Power Yoga (go check it out!) and were hungry monkeys. Our server brought us plenty of water and tea and was pretty friendly. She was very accomodating with our dietary needs (no pineapple and no wheat). Our food was served hot and was delicious, almost too perfect after working so hard on our bodies.  I was pleased with the service and the food, I know the prices are a little more than I'd like for lunch, but it was just fine to spend that today."
Bill E.,"Orange, CA",98,166,21,3.0,10/9/2010,I visited during lunch last week and sat on the patio. I ordered the black pepper Jamacian Shrimp which is one of my favorite dishes on their menu. The person with me also had the Jamacian Shrimp and Chicken which he also enjoyed. The biggest problem I have with this location is parking.. if you are just cruising in for lunch it is a pain in the but.. they have Valet but it is $5 with a restaurant validation. If you are in a hurry during lunch; this is not a quick location to get in and out based on the parking alone.
David N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",8,68,,2.0,1/24/2010,"It's been 10 years since I have been to a Cheesecake Factory, but we ended up here after discovering that the restaurant we wanted to go to at Bella Terra was no longer there. We arrived around 4:45, so the line wasn't too bad, but still there's a line. I don't know what it is that people go crazy for at Cheesecake Factory. The wife ordered the corn fritters appetizer, but it was rather bland. We were hoping for something either sweet or savory, but it was neither. The dipping sauce had a little kick to it, but I don't do to well with sauces, so I only had a little. The Chicken Medallions my wife had were alright. She didn't really like the sauce the used and the rice was kind of dry. It was kind of like someone was going to stir-fry the ingredients, but then decided not to at the last moment. I had a Classic Burger which was quite good and tasty. It was so filling that I barely touched the fries, which were also good. The service was quite good though, especially for a busy Saturday. For the prices, I would expect a lot better than Cocos-level food. I don't think we will be back if we don't have to."
Shong H.,"San Jose, CA",496,541,208,3.0,1/31/2008,"What can i say .. its cheesecake factory! and you can't leave without ordering their cheesecakes. Onto the cheesecake deserts later ... The place is usually packed at night, so be prepared to look for parking or drive to the structure.   They have a lot of items to choose from from their menu, so if you're an indecisive person, it might take you a while to come to a conclusion on what you want to eat. Unless you know exactly what you came for.  The waitress was attentive until we got our food, then she never even refilled our drinks.  Not even when we were like down to the bottom =( boo! I ordered their shrimp with angel hair and it was kinda dry.  It had chopped tomatoes on top.  Nothing too exciting.   When I got to the desert, I found that my fave cheesecake from there wasn't on the list??!!!! wtfreak!? I came in just for that slice ... so I went home unsatisfied even though I ordered my second fave, the adam's peanut butter one.  Still .. theres a void in my heart, and I don't know if I'll go back there anytime soon.  Not just here but at any cheesecake.  The food's mediocre .. and the service can be bad at times because they are busy and may not be aware of your needs all the time."
Gabe J.,"San Diego, CA",28,149,199,3.0,2/16/2014,"Bella Terra is a nightmare of a place to park but when your meeting a group at Cheesecake Factory you make the sacrifice. Last night 2/15/2014 was typically packed with people & long lines I was running late to meet my friends but it worked out since they had to wait about 1/2 hour anyway. We were in the patio & although a little chilly at night the heat lamps made it comfortable. The seats/tables  are pretty tight, when another table next to you is leaving they have no choice to bump yours in order to get out, noticed it on both ends & we are small so it wasn't because we needed additional room. Other than that it's a nice atmosphere, noisy which just means people are having a good time & talking, etc service was good, appetizer was good: the calamari was nice & crispy. My chopped salad was good, one of my faves. My friend laughed at her small sandwich & salad which was on the lite menu but we told her that's how they keep it light. We ordered a chocolate Sunday too share, they put lots of whip cream on it & some ice cream. We wanted cheesecake but we left the decision to our friend who had been craving a Sunday. It was a great night out with the girlfriends. Food we ordered wasn't exceptionally delicious but it was good."
Living I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/29/2014,"I was so sadly ignored here today 8/19/14 while I sat at the bar area table it was pretty annoying. I sat and was greeted after 15 minutes of waiting for someone to come to the table... I was alone yes. I was waiting to kill an hour or so before meeting my husband from work and ordered a drink and some lunch. After about 30 minutes and asking if my drink was ready Heather H my server went and made it and delivered it. I then ordered my lunch and waited and waited and waited while other diners entered, sat next to me, ordered... ate and left ! By the time the third party sat and received their food before me I complained and said I had to leave to cancel my food!!! They brought my food over to me as I was paying the check and I declined. I was so upset ... the service here usually is pretty good but I guess if you're going solo it's a NO! YOU WILL BE IGNORED IF YOU PATIENTLY WAIT and are seated alone !! The place was not that busy either it was mid week, middle of the day. I went in at 11:30am and left at 2:38 with no food ...talk about ignoring a customer they sure made me feel lousy that day.Thanks Cheescake for ignoring a customer! Bummer because usually service is great."
John N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9,87,27,3.0,3/19/2012,"I don't like this CCF, but I like their location.  Since CCF has a full bar, you can get drinks and walk to the movie theater nearby.  This is the only reason why I like going here. I'm not a huge fan of CCF food.  Every time I order something, the food taste either OK or below par.  I would recommend passing on their buffalo wings; the ones I had not only tasted like microwaved wings, but they were slightly cold. Service wise, they are OK.  The girl that was serving us wasn't there when we needed her, but was always there when we didn't want her there.  She kept on coming to our table and breaking up our conversation by asking if everything was ok.  I think she was trying to make up for the fact that she was too busy to be attentive in the beginning."
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,1888,1488,4.0,6/5/2012,I came here just because I had a cheesecake craving. The pineapple upside down cheesecake and banana cream pie cheesecake both were really good. Parking is a bit of a headache though.
Jordan P.,"Anaheim, CA",12,35,4,4.0,8/17/2010,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night and GEEZE.. We had to wait about an hour to be seated. It was super packed. But that's okay because by the time we sat down at our table which was outside, I was so freaking hungry! I got the Chicken Alfredo which was so delicious! I mean, the Alfredo sauce literally melted in my mouth. My boyfriend got the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and it came with fries. He really loved his burger, so we were both very satisfied with our food. We also ordered 2 cheesecakes - Strawberry Cheesecake and Velvet Cheesecake to go. When coming on the weekends, prepare to wait for a very long time. But it's usually worth it!"
Steve N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",94,46,30,3.0,7/6/2010,"You can't really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. From burgers to pasta everyone can find something to their liking. Cheesecake Factory doesn't do anything great, but they do things to satisfaction. Service: The service has always been good here. Most of the waiters are younger college age, they're attentive and work fast. Some waiters have been real helpful and made some good suggestions. Many of my experiences have been pleasant.   Food: Appitizers: The appitzers here are all average in taste. Nothing original but they have all the favorites like spinach/cheese dip, quesedilla, popcorn shrimp. Burgers:  Ive tried many burgers off the menu from the Classic to the Kobe beef. The burgers are just ok, I think the burgers at ""the Counter"" are cooked better. I don't think I'm gonna order anymore burgers here, Just too many better burgers in OC to be eating here.  Pasta: The pastas here are the items I generally enjoy the most. Anything with shrimp has been good. The portions on the pastas are always large, you can easily share between two.  Cheesecake: Sometimes I don't order anything except a slice of cheesecake. Their cheesecake isn't extraordinary but it hits that cheesecake spot pretty damn good. Every bite is like creamy soft calorie infused goodness. There's many different flavors and I'm unsure if I'll ever be able to try them all. If anything just get the cheesecake  When we can't decide on where to eat sometimes we'll end up at Cheesecake Factory. The prices are decent and you get good food. I personally would look for a more exciting eating experience, but usually no one complains about eating here.  Ups: Cheesecake, Friendly/Helpful service Downs: always have to wait in line to be seated during dinner hours"
Dom I.,"Buena Park, CA",84,11,2,3.0,1/13/2011,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all.  The wait time wasn't too bad, as it was raining when we went, and the waiter (Mike; he was extremely friendly and very helpful) was on top of their table service. Since my date and I were in a hurry, and not that hungry, we ordered and split the pasta carbonara with angel hair pasta (instead of the standard penne or spaghetti).  Definitely a good choice; the plate was large enough to feed us both.  We also ordered the stuffed mushroom appetized.  While very delicious, for the price I expected more than six tiny mushrooms. We were trying to decide between whether we wanted coffee or cheesecake for dessert, and in the end went with the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake.  It satisfied both cravings in one go. Unfortunately, the night was not a great success due to the obnoxious table next to us, as well as my date receiving her drink in a glass that had obviously not been washed, as was noticeable by the giant smear of pasta sauce residue/lipstick still present on the inside of the glass."
Mighty O.,"Cypress, CA",29,51,5,2.0,7/30/2009,"All that glitter isn't gold.  Just salty.  Like a pretty girl that you dated just once and never call her again. Cheesecake factory falls into the same boat.  After stopping @ Barnes and Noble to pick up some books, we decided to check out The CheeseCake Factory for lunch. I always see this place packed with mall crowd and just couldn't help myself to jump with bandwagon.   The ambiance was nice; rustic world meets trendy setting, with touch of an old school jazz music. It's nice cool place to hide from the relentless sun. I ordered Fettucini with Chicken & Sun-Dried Tomatoes. The service was fast and tentative. But I was fooled by a nice looking plate presentation. The pasta was undercook and salty, and the chicken too was salty. I only took a few bits and called it a day.  just like a date with a hottie who doesn't have much to offer other than her looks; i just couldn't waste anymore time. Is it just me? Maybe the cook is just looking out; Making sure that I'm loaded with salt and fluid in this heat.  Thanks. But my SUV has a working AC. Or I would be the only idiot that die of thirst in the city. CheeseCake factory might look pretty.  but just after a brief encounter, it left me with a salty impression."
Cindy P.,"Westminster, CA",344,360,728,4.0,7/30/2009,"Happy National Cheesecake Day! mMmMm, I love this holiday!!   The perfect excuse to go to the cheesecake factory for their yummy cheesecake at 50% off!!  MmMmMm!  Although many may find that the cheesecake factory is overrated, but I sincerely love their cheesecake.  I have not found a cheesecake that I did not swoon over.  My personal favorites are: the classic Fresh Strawberry, White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Stefanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, and Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake! Yum!  Beyond their cheesecakes, I really enjoy their Fresh Strawberry Shortcake as well because its simple and filled with strawberries!  I've been here so many times that I can not even think of a number, but I am obviously crazy about their cheesecakes!  I could have written more about how great their steaks are, special lunch menus, their garlic shrimp scampi, pastas, and chicken  - But ultimately, it really is just about their cheesecakes that make me drool and return."
Kenny T.,"Fountain Valley, CA",115,7,,5.0,2/24/2011,"I love Cheesecake and I love hearty food which makes me a fan of Cheesecake Factory.  The service is great but the wait is a bit slow.  The cool thing is they give you a pager that tells you when your table is ready. That gives you plenty of time to enjoy Bella Terra's many stores, shops, and all kinds of wonderful places in Bella Terra.  Once you get a table the service is great. The waiters are fast and friendly.  As you order, if your eating as a family I recommend sharing food by ordering a pasta, salad, and one or two entrées, since the portions are huge.  If your eating with friends or coworkers, stay away from very heavy and rich foods since you most likely can't finish.  For dessert you have tons of cheesecake to choose from, I recommend the Godiva cheesecake for any chocolate lovers.  Overall a spectacular place to spend the evening to have dinner."
