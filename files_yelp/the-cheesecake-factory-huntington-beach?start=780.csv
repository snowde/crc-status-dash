Misha K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",165,42,28,5.0,9/13/2012,"Great location, and service. Always seated our parties quickly and we really enjoy eating outside on the patio when the weather is nice. Recently had the Shrimp Scampi & Steak Diane combination and it was incredible. Best BBQ Salmon in town. Highly recommend dining here if your in the greater Huntington Beach area."
Trevor R.,"Los Alamitos, CA",118,22,22,5.0,10/31/2012,Had the chicken tacos and had to finish the night with the red velvet truffle..amazing. I can easily say that it was definitely worth the 45 min wait we had to wait to get a table. I will definitely be going back.
Yan F.,"Manhattan, NY",21,272,,4.0,11/6/2011,"Yelp...I think I am drifting away from you farther and farther away. Today, the thought of cheesecake crossed my mind and I suddenly remember this place back in Huntington Beach. There are Cheesecake Factories all over the US but this was the first Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I know. Shame on me.  This place is set up like a restaurant. There's a waiter to seat you in the front and give you menus. I always thought this place served only desserts but they actually served all kinds of food from salmon to salads and sandwiches. It wasn't any Cheesecake Factory after all but now I'm being a smarta$$. haha I ordered  a salad and a plain cheesecake. The salad was Huge like all food orders in California are and the cheesecake was super rich. I never thought I can cheesecake so rich and savory but this more than hit the spot. It was also super moist but the only problem is it was difficult to eat the whole slice at once because of it savoriness.  I had business to attend to afterwards but I can definitely see myself returning here to try the rest of their desserts. Maybe someday when sun is up and the palm tree leaves are green, I will make haste to return here. But for the first run, it was a quick sayonara."

Shelly H.,"Laguna Hills, CA",11,56,7,3.0,8/24/2012,Service could be better. But overall it's pretty good. Soup on Thursday is the best!
Elda P.,"Long Beach, CA",7,27,74,5.0,8/12/2012,"I love this place!!! The atmosphere, the location,and service. I usually, just stop by for red velvet cake!!! In which, I shall add it's a must if you have not already ordered. It takes you to another world."
Danielle T.,"San Francisco, CA",43,17,,4.0,8/11/2010,"I know it's a chain, but my experiences at Cheesecake Factory have been quite good.  The thing I don't like about it is that for an indecisive person like me,  their menu is way too broad.  On the other hand, there should be something on the menu to appeal to everyone.   Cajun Jambalaya Pasta - It is their most popular pasta dish for a reason.  Shrimp and chicken over linguine with a mildly-spicy, cajun sauce.   Chinese Chicken Salad - It's freaking huge! I don't believe I've ever finished it.  Quite possibly the best chinese chicken salad ever.   One of my favorites things about dining at Cheesecake is their complimentary pumpernickel (my fave) and french bread! For me, it's a toss-up between them and Macaroni Grill's rosemary bread as best free bread at a chain restaurant.  I don't think I can ever leave this place without order a slice of cheesecake.  I recommend the tiramisu cheesecake or the red velvet cake cheesecake.  Be warned that a slice of the latter is double the price of a slice of any other cheesecake but it is damn worth it.  It is extremely rich so I suggest sharing, and between 2 people, is almost a meal in itself."
TP 0.,"Anaheim, CA",61,19,5,4.0,11/8/2011,Must try there sweet corn tamale cake Appetizers. So delicious :)
Tejsah T.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,97,4,5.0,12/12/2009,"I go to cheesecake atleast almost every month or every other month since they were first open, the location I like best are Brea & Huntington Beach and I always almost get the same thing all the time.  I'm just going to yelp on what I never pass up on everytime I'm here, they all taste the same every other cheesecake factory, so these are just my recommendations: appetizers: the chicken tequito. They are so delicious. The shell is so crunchy yet so buttery it just melts in your mouth.  Thai wrap, their sauce is so yummy most  appetizer are probably under $12.  Main dish I always get the pasta canjun jambalaya, really yummy.  around $16.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - kinda sweet, kinda spicy, I love it. Honestly that's all I've really tried..I tend to always stick to the same thing..but I don't mind, because I love it.  Desert: godiva chocolate cheesecake, original cheesecake, and Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake."
Dan E.,"Irvine, CA",1,14,,3.0,1/4/2013,"Food was tasty. I had forgotten how loud a Cheesecake Factory restaurant could get. Our server was fairly unconcerned with our needs and rarely cared enough to make eye contact or let us finish our sentences. Other than that, good meal!"
Amber G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,29,,5.0,9/13/2012,One of my most favorite places to eat!!! I love this restaraunt! Every time I have gone here I always get a nice server and host. My favorite cheesecake is the cookie dough flavor :) Would definitely recommend this place!
Queen J.,"Palmdale, CA",158,73,183,5.0,7/31/2009,"I throughly enjoyed my visit yesterday. I walked in and was able to get a table in the bar area right away. I wanted something fried and something sweet. Told my waitress and she recommended two appetizers 1) Fried Olives stuffed with sausage 2) Fried Artichoke Hearts. MMMMM.....just the right mix of salty, meaty, and tang.  I appreciate a waitress who checks on me during the course of my stay and the young lady who was working with our table did just that.  Now i  was ready for the sweet, and she asked "" Do you like Red Velvet?"" Our waitress was clicking with me in so many ways. She recommened the New-Red Velvet Cheesecake.  That was one of the best cheesecakes that i have had in a long time. I am partial to Red Velvet, but as a cheesecake, OMG! I was in Red Velvet Cheesecake Heaven.  The service was excellent, i was catered to by at least 3 other servers as well as my main person . I was greeted at the door upon entering the establishment.  The restrooms were clean and as i left i was thanked and asked to come back.   Good Job Huntington Beach Cheesecake Factory!"
Alex V.,"Westminster, CA",1033,330,189,4.0,2/1/2010,"Just had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory, I've eaten there many times. The Louisiana chicken pasta is usually what I get. Lunch portions are huge still, if they could cut the dinner portion down to a third, that would be the perfect size. They have a new appetizer which we had, the white bean hummus. It was quite good, but still way too much food, appetizer, bread, meal, I felt like I was going to explode when we were done.  I'm a fan of about 6 dishes on the menu and tend to stick with them. I've found what I like there and they're always good dishes.  My only gripe is they give you way too much food, if they started offering a smaller portions menu that would be amazing."
Matt K.,"Long Beach, CA",228,99,8,3.0,4/14/2012,"Beautiful decor and pretty good service makes this location pretty good.  It seems to be very busy, though.  The avocado rolls are superior.  They had a good salad and the entrees were pretty good as well.  The thing for me is that it's crowded, the tables are close together and there's a rushed feeling as all the waiting guests stare at you while you eat.  I can't stand the pressure!"
Kira B.,"Broomfield, CO",307,1043,88,5.0,12/27/2007,"My review is based on a weekday lunch. I'm sure if this was a dinner review it would be quite different. My mom and I were seated without a wait. Our waitress was great and checked on us numerous times. I ordered a lunch sized salad and chicken pesto pizza, my mom ordered a spinach/apple salad. The food came out quick and I was really impressed by the presentation and taste. The complimentary brown bread is awesome and so is their tropical iced tea. I usually roll my eyes at the thought of eating at a chain restaurant, especially one as hyped as the Cheesecake Factory, but I was truly impressed with this visit. I know better than to go for a Saturday night, but I would recommend lunch here."
Nancy D.,"New York, NY",322,343,75,3.0,8/26/2009,"Despite what my friends seem to think, I DO like to come here. Just not on a first date. Long story. This is the cheesecake closest to my parent's. I love coming here with them (because they always pay and that means I can get whatever the hell I want). This location is pretty decently sized so the wait is never longer than 15 minutes. Gotta love my favorite go-to on the menu: Chicken Picatta!"
David N.,"Garden Grove, CA",280,72,,4.0,1/12/2012,"I'm been nice here for giving a 4 star lol, but yes honestly this place is amazing, been coming here for years, I love their variety of dishes, absolutely amazing for good prices as well, I mean theres not much to complain about this place, delicious dishes, yummy desserts and drinks, great beautiful interior inside and out, possibly one of the best restaurants I ever been, except for the waiting lines on the weekends, so do come early, and well nutritious..I dont know about that, but overall I love it here, one of the best restaurants I ever been too. Of all the cheesecake factories I been too, this one is the best ! hands down!"
Brittney C.,"Lake Forest, CA",13,5,,1.0,8/12/2012,"My husband I were completely bummed and will never go back for the dinner. I ordered takeout and the shrimp in the shrimp creole was overcooked. My husband had the shepherds pie and we both thought it was very greasy. Additionally we had onion rings that were extremely undercooked and doughy. Everything was terrible, we didnt bother eating the food at all. On a brighter note the cheesecake was good, but all in all everything was no where near being worth the price."
Diana N.,"Westminster, CA",178,150,13,4.0,6/5/2011,"I used to hate this place. I came here a few years ago and never came back again until a friend of mines did her birthday dinner here recently. I had a bad experience here because they had the worst fettuccine alfredo. EVER. How the hell could you go wrong with a typical pasta? Apparently, they do. Anyways, onto the good stuff. I returned here for a friend's birthday. I love how they give out complimentary breads and butter. Keeps my mouth entertained until my dinner comes out. Don't eat too much of it though! Last time i got carried away and got full off of it -_-. But i love coming here even for their bread baskets. Most places would taste bland and give out old bread but this place is legit. The bread baskets comes in white or wheat bread. The wheat bread is so good that I even request only wheat bread now. They even toast it for you too and it tastes even better because the butter would just melt onto it. Wow I didn't realize I wrote alot just for their complimentary breads lol =X  So, I had their Louisiana Pasta. It is so good. One of the best pastas I've had. I think it was a bow-tie pasta with some thick cream sauce and Cajun seasoning all over. it came with fried hand breaded chicken. Most places  would disgust me by over doing it with the batter and deep fry it but here, it was super thin battered and you can actually taste the chicken, I thought it would be dry but it was juicy! Loved it. I'd come back here again for that =)  I had their Salisbury Steak entree for dinner here too before. They give out a big portion of it. It came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was under $15 too! and It was very good and filling. Their Caesar salad is actually pretty bomb. I had a side order of that and Mac and cheese. the mac and cheese noodle was pretty big and they used lots of cheese. I love cheese. I think it was like tillamook or something but whatever it was, it was good! Thank god I live across the street so I'm a pretty frequent customer here. =)"
Matt E.,"Long Beach, CA",161,343,122,4.0,10/14/2009,"I have heard the good and the bad about the Cheesecake Factory from those who have been before but I had yet to experience it. That is until I was taken out to lunch by a work vendor the other day. Being a huge cheesecake fan, what could be the attraction? How good can the cheesecake be? AMAZINGLY GOOD...that's how good.  But not to get ahead of myself, the non-cheesecake items are also really, really good. The menu is HUGE...strangely full of advertisements for other consumer establishments.  Started things off with the fire roasted artichoke which was pretty good. Had the Rib-Eye Steak Cajun style for my main course. Ordered it medium rare and it literally melted in my mouth. It was seasoned perfectly so there was no need for any A-1 (if it's seasoned and cooked properly, a cut of steak...especially a rib-eye doesn't need any fixin's like A-1 or BBQ). It was honestly the best piece of meat I have ever had from a chain restaurant. This rib-eye comes runner up to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Vegas for best steak I have ever had.  Then there was the cheesecake...with maybe 30 to choose from I decided to check out the cookie dough cheesecake. I couldn't finish the whole thing and I do love me some cheesecake. Very rich and definitely worth the calories as a mega sweet treat.  The staff was on point with good service and the decor was quite interesting. A lot of brightly colored hand-blown glass work which I could only imagine is really cool looking at night.  I will be back for sure...maybe on a date night with the girlfriend...and I hear the wait for dinner can be really really long...so I think reservations are a must."
