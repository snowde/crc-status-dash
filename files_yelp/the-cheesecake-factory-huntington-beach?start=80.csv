Peter D.,"Westminster, CA",0,11,,4.0,11/29/2017,"Nice outside   Conveniently located   food fantastic   sometimes a few of the hostesses have a little attitude when there are long waits,  but other than that, a great place"
Krysti S.,"Long Beach, CA",2,7,22,5.0,6/11/2017,There is never a Cheescake Factory I have been to that disappointed! They are all so visually stunning.  This location has the cutest outdoor seating area surrounding a pretty fountain. I always eat something different when I come and it is always good. Service was excellent hear at Bella Terra.  I had the shrimp tacos from the skinnylicious menu and they were delicious as well as the vegetables.  I still can't believe that plate was under 500 calories and so good!
Brenda K.,"Buena Park, CA",9,134,16,2.0,4/2/2017,Very poor service. Mid day lunch. No wait to be seated. Plenty of people working but our server was very inattentive. Very disappointed.  Mushroom soup was good but very salty. Salad was fresh and tasty.
Dwayne Y.,"Long Beach, CA",3,52,53,5.0,3/4/2017,"I love this place!  You gotta get there early to beat the dinner rush, and to get better service and better prepped food. My wife and I both live a gluten-free life-style and this place has some decent gluten-free options. Today I got the salmon from the lunch menu with broccoli and asparagus. My wife got the half roasted chicken and I ate the white meat pieces and her carrots, which are seen on my salmon plate picture.  I usually get an iced tea, but today I ordered a black coffee. Their coffee isn't great, but it's not too bad."
Cristina R.,"Orange, CA",0,10,67,2.0,7/31/2017,"Tonight, I received terrible customer service from the bakery dept at The Cheesecake Factory at Huntington Beach. I just walked in the door and asked the crowd of people waiting where was the end of the line. While it was not too problematic that no one spoke up, my name was called by the employee at the cash register. I tried to sidestep my way to the front but no one would let me through. Then, I tried to speak with an employee to the side, but I could not catch her eye. So I stepped up after one other customer paid and asked the employee if she remembered calling ""Cristina"". She responded in an unprofessional manner, ""Yes. A long time ago."" I explained, ""I thought I heard you, but another customer moved up."" My thought that that the other customer could have the same name as me did not seem to be of import to the employee and she rang me up. I tipped as I deemed appropriate and as I was calculating the total, a customer walks up to the register and tells me, ""Miss, there's a line."" I explained again, ""I'm aware, but she called my name. And no one responded to me earlier or let me come up to the front when my name was called."" He chose to ignore me and face the employee, who chose to help him as she previously. I bid them both a good-night and walked out, with full intention of speaking with a supervisor. This was unacceptable."
Dagmar A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",53,76,14,2.0,11/4/2017,"After tonight's experience, I felt compelled to update my previous review.  I ordered a Super Antioxidant Salad to go (along with a side of mac n cheese) and the salad was quite the flop.  The menu lists avocados, blueberries, grapes, seeds, etc. to be a part of the salad.  Well, I had four tiny squares of avocado in the entire salad, ZERO blueberries, a total of four grapes (cut in half), and the portion size of the salad overall was SO MINUSCULE (not at all a generous Cheesecake Factory portion by any measure)!!  For $12, it was absolutely small.  Additionally, I requested beets on my salad--I even told the order taker on the phone that I would pay for them as an added side, but no matter what, I wanted (roasted) beets for that salad.  That request, I should mention, took forever, as I got put on hold two times just to secure this request.  When I came in to pick up this to-go order, I specifically opened by bag to check for the beets, and when I did not see them, I asked the checker at the register--she assured me up and down that they were in there (I think she was staring at the pears that came with the salad) and I was trying to tell her that I didn't see them, so she called the kitchen (or so she said) and they allegedly told her that the beets were there.  So what was I supposed to do at that point?  I said,  ""okay, maybe I'm just blind because this place is so dimly lit that I guess the dark beets are mixed in there with the greens and I'm just not seeing them.""  BUTTTTT, no such luck.  I get home, sort through the thin layer of salad that was supposed to be my full entree-sized salad, and found ZERO beets.  Colossal fail tonight Cheesecake Factory--I could go on with the errors, but I'm tired of writing."
David L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/23/2017,"Have you gotten so big on volume that you have forgotten a bout the quality of your food? Where is the flavor of your main dishes? It isn't the first time but most likely be the last. We were there on a Wednesday ordered our main chicken dishes and were very disappointed on the taste and flavored! The chicken marsella was my dish was terrible, it was 3 thin boiled chicken breast covered with lots of uncooked mushrooms and lots of bow pasta and a terrible marsella testing sauce! Our bill was high and we felt ripped off!! David 714 841-9978"
Anthony L.,"Irvine, CA",119,82,18,1.0,2/14/2017,"Easy to see why this place has such poor reviews rude to my wife on Valentine's Day and then she came home with lukewarm food that we ordered for pick up that looked like this. Who is rude to people on Valentine's Day? What is wrong with this place? We won't be back this is horrible, I'd rather have gone to a fast food place, like any of them."
Martha L.,"Orange County, CA",56,72,,3.0,11/28/2016,"I went with a friend from the East Coast who had never been to The Cheesecake Factory! We went to the movies and decided to come here and have dinner afterwards. We got seated rather quickly, but that was the only fast thing associated with our visit :-( It took a good fifteen minutes for our server to visit our table to get our drinks ordered, and then they were never refilled.  My friend liked his food but I didn't care for mine.  I have been to a few other locations and been a lot happier; I don't think I'll be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory."
Antonio P.,"Anaheim, CA",25,4,,2.0,11/20/2017,"This is my wife and I's favorite place to eat... we go to the Bella Terra location. We have been coming to this location for over 10 years.... we come to this location because we are big movie goers and this location is yards away from a 21 cinema theater..... the service is a hit or miss, sometimes we have the best service and sometimes is not even close, but we don't come here for the service, we come for the food...... for instance today is a Monday, busy but not unusual for them, they gave us a pager and said it was a 10 min wait, 10 minutes later the pager rings, I walk up and they say thank you we will call you, 6 people later they they call my name.... it left me wondering why the pager if I still have to wait for them to call me after so many people..... we get seated and wait for the waiter for what it seams for ever but it was only like 7 minutes, he takes our drinks then says I'll be back in a shake :)... long story short 35 minutes after we got seated we are eating our ribeye steak and it is he most tender, juicy flavorful  steak you can have as always with not too much fat but just enough that it melts in your mouth... wonderful mash potatoes that are nicely butters and salter, green beans that are seasoned to perfection and crunchy to the bite that make you forget about the service entirely... another great plate is the salmon and steak Diane plate :) great eats"
Sydney T.,"Garden Grove, CA",39,537,2458,4.0,6/13/2016,"We were seated right away upon arrival.  Our server Jessica was really awesome.  She took our orders and help us with our surprise birthday plan.  We ordered 4 dishes: steak diane with salmon, steak diane with shrimp, chicken/shrimp pasta jambalaya, shrimp pasta.  2 appetizers: chicken nachos (yummy) and buffalo blast (too salty).  Drinks: long Island ice tea, passion fruit mojitos, strawberry lemonade, and hibiscus lemonade.  Overall food was good and service was wonderful.  Our servers brought out our cake and sing happy birthday with us.  We had a wonderful experience here."
Jim V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,15,,4.0,9/5/2017,"Excellent Meal and huge potions. Date and I were able to eat about 1/2 the portions, so got the doggie bags.  The reason for 4 stars was they switched out our server twice during the meal, but all the servers were gracious. Even ordered a slice of cheesecake to take home. Was originally told about 25 minute wait and it was more like 10minutes.  Had some cocktails at the bar while waiting. Bar was a bit pricey for non-top shelf drinks."
Brock L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",7,44,29,4.0,1/30/2017,"This cheese cake factory is pretty well done-I always get the burger) or the Chinese chicken salad. Maybe even both if I  fell like I can still fit dessert after. Dessert here is mostly why it's called ""Cheesecake Factory"", and they named it right. All of the cheesecakes are delicious and they even have more after! At least they can guarantee to always have one thing!"
Kahlee R.,"Long Beach, CA",11,9,,1.0,7/18/2017,Worst experience ever! I come to cheesecake factory all the time and tonight was unacceptable.  My date order a sandwich with a salad and the salad had no dressing. I ordered carbonara and the sauce was beyond watery. We asked the server to return the pasta and get some dressing for my date and upon return she recieved a thick gunky dressing when it's suppose to be balsamic and viniger. Never again will we come to cheesecake factory! Btw my date was able to eat all her food and I still have not received my carbonara. Go figure.
Joe T.,"Westminster, CA",427,58,68,4.0,4/12/2017,"Food tasted amazing and service was great! Only bad part of my experience was the wait time, which was 50 minutes on a Saturday at 8 pm. Although the wait time was pretty long, we got our food pretty fast after we ordered. This place always seems to be packed, so I would definitely call in for a reservation beforehand!"
Amanda A.,"Long Beach, CA",121,9,,1.0,6/10/2017,"By far the worst experience I've had. I place an order almost every week for a cobb salad. My salad came absolutely HORRIBLE. As if they just threw on the salad not even tossed, chopped, or flavored. I called and complained and talked to the general manger JOE.  Who specially gave me attitude and refused to talk to me and mentioned ""to talk to me like a human being"". By far the worst customer services I've ever had in my entire life. Especially from a general manager when my food tasted completely HORRIBLE. JOE even gave me the number to corporate so I can call and complain about my horrible experience.  I have by far had the worst experience and the worst salad. And will be calling corporate on MONDAY for Joe the GENERAL MANAGER who told me to talk to him like ""human being""  Do not come to this place if u I want expect fresh food and good service. Worst experience."
Cindy V.,"Buena Park, CA",53,85,2,1.0,11/19/2016,"The worst service I have ever experienced at a Cheesecake Factory.  Came on a Saturday night at about 11pm. Got seated right away. The waitress took our order right away brought water and bread fairly quickly then everything went to shit after that.  We waited until like 11:25p to ask the waitress about an update for our order to which she kept apologizing as if she didn't put in the order. We were just like okay thanks. She went to check on it and walked around for a few minutes and came back and said they're still working on your order I'm sorry. I then said it's ok but you could have at least updated us on our order.  She then went on a huge rant about her having all of these tables to attend to (the place is fairly empty since they close in about an hour). She also said she only has two hands and two feet and she can't go back to the kitchen and tell them to hurry. What's interesting is that it was only 2 of us and we ordered 2 appetizers, Mac and cheese balls and the tamale Cakes. She was so ridiculously rude. I just said ok to everything she had said. In the middle of her rant the food came out. Then she left. I think the manager asked her something about us and they just walked away.  My bf and I just looked at each other after and decided let's just leave this food and leave. We walked out and left. The manager chased after us outside and asked us why we left. We told him what happened and he just kept nodding his head and apologizing and told us goodbye and walked away. Ok, cool bro.  The worst. Never will be back and honestly don't think they care. Peace out Cheesecake with your terrible customer service."
Tae L.,"Hesperia, CA",1,1,,1.0,8/20/2017,The place didn't look busy on a sunday at 3pm.  Service took too long after getting seated and ended up leaving after waiting for 30 minutes.  Didn't get a chance to see the waiter/waitress.
Jacks S.,"Tustin, CA",0,26,37,1.0,3/26/2017,"My dinner was ruined!!! After a long day at work wanted to enjoy dinner with my husband he really enjoys the chix. Chipotle pasta from here.. I order the gluten free pasta, THE WORST!!  It was under cooked. Had to send it back to the kitchen. Apparently our server was on a rush to get us out.  She did but us dessert but the MOD never visited our table., bad customer service. Never coming back."
James M.,"Riverside, CA",5,10,,2.0,6/14/2017,"I took a customer to this restaurant yesterday and the waiter dumped a Diet Coke on the table. Got all over my suit, shirt, and folder (suit and shirt will have to be cleaned).  Only had white napkins and trying to wipe off Diet Coke on a black shirt with a white napkin didn't go so well.  So we moved to another table and continued with our meal and discussion. Paid the bill and left; there were five of us.  After, we were talking outside and just realized, we didn't get a manager apology, nothing off the check, no offer of free dessert...NOTHING!!!  Just the bill.  I was not expecting anything for free but I think a manager apology would be in order.  Very disappointing. Is this the kind of service we should expect?   Am I being unreasonable?   Seriously!!!!!"
