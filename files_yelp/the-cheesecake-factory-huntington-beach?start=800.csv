James J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,5,1,1.0,7/17/2014,"Ok so we went to The Cheesecake factory this weekend and had the typical herding cattle experience, but this time the food was subpar. I ordered catfish and it lacked taste and was chew, but was alright. My wife ordered the fettuccini alfredo. The pasta and sauce was delicious, but she added chicken (a $3 charge) and it tasted and looked like it was boiled and not seasoned at all. At most restaurants when you add chicken to something the pasta will come out with a nicely grilled and seasoned chicken breast sliced and laying on top. This chicken was in odd chunks of all sizes and thrown haphazardly on top. It tasted bland. The first bite that she took she spit back out because it had a large piece of gristle in it. After that she didn't even eat the chicken. So we paid $3 extra for something that she couldn't even stomach. I'm hoping it was just an off night because in the past the food has been what has saved this place in my eyes."
Raven G.,"London, United Kingdom",166,45,56,5.0,3/9/2012,"So good! Everything was good, the service, the food, the dessert, the drinks were strong, Id say it was worth the price, and I will def go back."
Patric T.,"Westminster, CA",0,22,1,2.0,7/9/2014,"What a difference. Until today, this Cheesecake Factory location has been the ""go to"" restaurant whenever we have friends in town or just want an extraordinary meal and are willing to pay the high prices. I treated my wife to a birthday dinner and expected the same great-tasting food and attentive service as we've always enjoyed in the past. There seems to be a pall hovering over restaurants these days and the Cheesecake Factory seems to be its latest victim. We were seated soon and were led to a table whose waitress, at first, was attentive but then became less so as the meal went on. She pasted a phony smile on her face but she wasn't concerned much on getting our order or visiting our table during the meal. She ran through the ""specials"" as if she was giving a post-mortem account of how someone died. Asking for an additional round of bread was almost painful as, after I did, she gave me the look like, 'really'?  But what really caused us grief was the quality and condition of the food once if finally came. I don't mind waiting for hot and freshly cooked food, but when it comes out looking as if the chef's couldn't care less if it had any appeal, well, something's gone wrong. I ordered the Spicy Sesame Chicken and my wife, the Chicken Marsala. Let's start with mine. The chicken was cooked as I expected but, the brown rice was slathered in the sesame sauce, so much so that the rice was packed down and the sauce was floating in the dish. On the contrary, my wife's meal had little to almost no Marsala wine as part of the meal. She kept scraping the chicken on the dish hoping to gather some flavor. Our now largely missing-in-action waitress (she was not the euphemistic ""server"") came by only to re-fill our sodas and never inquired about our meal. Could I have spoken up? Of course and maybe I should have. I actually should have sent the food back and left. But we didn't want the reason we went there to be lost and we finished our meals. ""Did you leave room for dessert"" came the expected question from our waitress. ""No, sorry.""  Needless to say, her tip reflected not only her lousy service but the manner in which our food was prepared. Reading other reviews, I am not alone in my disappointment regarding our visit to Huntington Beach location of the Cheesecake Factory."
Natalie V.,"Islesford, ME",0,6,,1.0,12/5/2014,You think second times the charm...but we were very wrong! We waited to be sat in the dinning room but then were walked to be sat in the corner of the bar. We were in a booth so we thought...ugh...this isn't that bad! Well...we sat for a while and after hearing a full conversation with our server and the host which included him stating that he did not know why he was being sat and that if he could please not be sat anymore he would greatly appreciate it...he said hello. He told us he was having a horrible night and couldn't wait to get out of there and being a server myself through college know exactly what he was talking about but in the customer service industry I do not think it is at all appropriate to communicate this fact with your client!! So...the night did not get any better. My husband was hungry and I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I told him to order...but clearly held on to the menu to order in just a bit. He never came back and because we were in the corner no one walked by...my initial reaction was to chase someone down but my husband is a bit more reserved and asked that stay put! So my husbands food came...I shared because I was hungry too! His food was done...I finally then got my glass of wine I ordered. Never were asked how everything was...then  my husband had to ask for the check and he dropped it off and walked away. That was it! I never got any food...or even had the opportunity to order. I really am not a complainer and this is only the second yelp review I ever wrote and the other one was singing high praise! The food was good...but absolutely horrible service.
Lauren S.,"Fullerton, CA",103,126,19,3.0,2/4/2012,"I'm really only a fan of their desserts here, but boy are they good. Recently I went with a friend and got the warm apple crisp with ice cream and the banana cream cheesecake. Both were delicious and both were huge! My advice is if you get dessert here, share it with someone because the portions are enormous."
A Y.,"Glendale, AZ",16,238,14,4.0,2/24/2010,"Often times I dislike giving chains 4 stars. Everything just feels so un-original and uniform... McD's comes to mind, doesn't it? However, Cheesecake hasn't done anything wrong to warrant anything less than 4 stars, so I'll simply have to squash that feeling until I can find something to nitpick on. Cheesecake Factory is always a good time, mainly because the food is always good. And who doesn't like a nice looking restaurant? All the food I've tried is amazing, and each new dish only gets better. Wish the price is a bit lower, but I do feel like I get what I paid for. So what's to complain about?"
John C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",47,30,3,2.0,7/4/2012,"Ordered the Petite Filet, which I always order when coming to Cheesecake Factory, my steak was tough and sitting in a pool of blood and juices. The onion strings were to greasy and too much batter. The french fries used to be thin but now thick and under cooked. This is the last time I order steak here:("
Cathy K.,"Orange County, CA",600,427,77,2.0,2/1/2009,"Cheesecake Factory.  The name says it all.  Cheesecake + Factory = A factory for cheesecakes.  Am I making myself clear? Cheesecake Factory, for sure, has some of the best cheesecakes around, with an awesome variety of flavors to choose from.  The vanilla bean, the turtle, the pumpkin - all are delicious.  Sweet tooths - beware!  This place is gonna drive you buck-wild!  It's fun to make a stop at Cheesecake to sample some of their numerous offerings, but please keep in mind, it's a chain restaurant.  As is the case with any chain joint, you are going to find some pretty good dishes, but most are not all that spectacular.  Quantity of choices vs quality of offering, I suppose.  You won't be blown away, but your PMS is sure to dissipate within seconds of entering this place.  There's a plus!  ^^ But... beware the food.  This place has some of the most consistently nasty food offerings ever.  I've never actually had a meal here that I enjoyed.  Sure, I love any place with free bread, but the food's gotta taste good, too!  After numerous failed attempts at finding something good here, I've decided to just stick to dessert from here on out. Yes, a great place for dessert, but definitely not worth my money for dinner.  Nope~"
Adam Y.,"Long Beach, CA",106,48,,2.0,2/23/2012,"Um, no. Pasta was okay; but this place takes itself way too seriously for the middle of the road food that they serve."
Chialee L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",12,66,8,4.0,12/16/2009,"Came here last week with my girls for our annual holiday dinner...and all I gotta say is that I fell in love...I already loved their Small Bites offering of Beets and Goat Cheese salad as well as their Ahi dish, but man be still my beatin' heart when I opened the novel of a menu to find ""The Well Mannered Dirty Martini"". Now, I don't think any dirty martini should be ""well mannered"" because I like mine extra dirrrrty, but Cheesecake Factory makes a damn fine drink. The Ketel One already makes it a must for me, but to top it off with big fat blue cheese stuffed olives just put me over the moon! I didn't order an entree as I went for my small bites must haves, but dessert was an automatic ""Hell Yeah' when our friendly watier showed me a pic of their holiday star: Red Velvet Cheesecake. 'Nuff said, I died and went to heaven. Just the perfect balance of holiday cheer (red and white, come on, how Xmasy) and just the right amount of sweetness. Didn't put me in sugar shock so that i could continue to enjoy my buzz from my martini!"
Ashley F.,"Sacramento, CA",36,191,2,1.0,10/12/2011,"Hey Cheesecake Factory - Next time you seat me on the patio, give me water, and tell me someone will be with me in a minute - don't leave me sitting there hungry with no contact for 15 minutes while I listen to your bus boy drag tables across the cement.  We walked out.  Even the allure of cheesecake after a 13 mile run couldn't keep me seated."
Van P.,"Orange County, CA",794,154,34,1.0,1/8/2009,"SO LET ME TELL YOU WHY I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS CHEESECAKE FACTORY.... but before i begin, I've been to this Cheesecake Factory quiet a few times and the service and food here got worse and worse each time......I actually just got back from Cheesecake a few hours ago and my experience was BAD. I had the dumbest bitch as my waitress. I asked her if i can move to a booth so I can have a bit more privacy and the bitch answers ""you can go up front and ask"" and I asked her if she can ask for me and the bitch replied ""sorry i cant leave my area."" HELLOOO u retarded hoe, WHERE'S YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE ?!?!? and my fettucini with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes tasted like plastic. GROSS. back to what i was saying... SERVICE....one word. HORRIBLE. come on. u have one waiter for like 3 tables and they STILL can't provide a good service for shit. On top of that, they're unfriendly, bitchy, and dumb. FOOD....not that great. most of it tastes like shit | plastic. I usually get the fettucini w/ chicken and sun-dried tomatoes which is a HIT and MISS for me. sometimes its good. sometimes its not. RESERVATIONS....so I had my bday dinner here w/ a party of 40. yeah thats alot i know but it took them 3 hours to seat us EVEN THOUGH i had reservations at 7 30 and we all got there around 7. DOES IT REALLY TAKE 3 HRS TO CLEAN UP 4 LONG TABLES and SET THEM UP ?? I really dont know why ppl hype so much about Cheesecake. If you want quality food with good service, go to pomodoro, KABUKI, or Olive garden down on beach blvd."
kristen y.,"Childress, TX",17,110,2,4.0,6/24/2009,"I love this place!  The only reason I hold back the fifth star is for their prices.  They're a bit high. I love the crispy artichoke hearts.  They are an inexpensive appetizer too, only $4.  Super yummy. My favorite cheesecake is the white-chocolate caramel macadamia nut.  Or try the banana cream.  My favorite non-cheesecake dessert is the chocolate tower cake.  It has layers of chocolate mousse.  Service is good and consistent. Try the strawberry lemonade. They even put sugar around the rim of the glass. The menu is huge and wonderful.  I try to vary what I order.  I've never been disappointed.  Since there are so many locations, it makes it an easy decision when travelling."
Dana H.,"Corona del Mar, CA",1,39,,3.0,5/19/2010,"When my boyfriend and I came here, we were SO impressed by George's service! He was the most charming waiter ever! He deserves a raise! But to be real, I've never been impressed with their chain's food."
Clement C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",3,44,1,3.0,7/10/2010,"Average food, average value.   Nice ambiance and fancy decorations."
Liz G.,"Santa Ana, CA",3,5,4,1.0,5/6/2014,"The only reason why I give this place one star is cuz I can't give it any less than that. I came in here with my family celebrating my graduation. First off I gotta say the staff near the bar area are very inattentive, had to wait a while before we could order, when I finally ordered and received my food, the server disappeared, did not check up on us, and in the middle of my steak, and mashed potatoes, I pulled out a long hair. Disgusting!!!! I had to wait about 10 min for the server to come around so I could let her know about the incident. She took the plate and the manager came over, offered me a free side salad, as if that was going to make it up, and that was the end of it. Poor customer service, not what I expected from a place like this."
Evan N.,"Torrance, CA",134,198,164,3.0,5/4/2009,"Crispy Crab Wontons - very crispy and filled with a cream cheese filling; would definitely order again Sunrise Fiesta Burrito - an authentic Mexican burrito this ain't but this is The Cheesecake Factory so you know what you're getting into.  That being said it was large and all the flavors melded together nicely. Fettucini with Chicken and Sun-dried Tomatoes - Pasta is al dente, chicken moist, sauce uninspired Four Cheese Pasta - my friend ordered this and I tried a little bit.  For me, I need some meat or veggies in my pasta and this was a little too plain. I usually only hit up Cheesecake if my friends want to go.  Till that time comes again, take care Cheesecake Factory, I'm sure you'll be fine."
Lovely and Keo V.,"Long Beach, CA",1,24,,3.0,10/20/2010,Keo: good food. Overpriced. Good for a date. Lovely: the lighting at the restaurant were so dim I could barely see what I was eating but the fried mac and cheese were great.
Tara W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",16,10,2,1.0,3/27/2014,"I'm writing this post, because I'm so mad. Normally, I love the Cheesecake Factory. I crave their cheesecakes and other meals on their menu, oh and their bread! But, tonight I had to pick up a full red velvet cheesecake for a 30th birthday party, and I called twice the day of to ensure that the cheesecake would be defrosted by the time I got there. And guess what? It wasn't. All the girl behind the counter could say was ""I didn't know anything about that"". The guy who was standing in line in front of me had to wait for the manager (which took about 20 mins) because this girl gave his food away to someone else. Then, my order was messed up too. It would have been a little more forgivable if she didn't just brush me off, like 'oh well, sorry!' It's such a bummer because I love the food, but I will definitely think twice before ordering a cheesecake (maybe plan on picking it up 2 hrs earlier?). Poor customer service..."
Steve H.,"Irvine, CA",181,227,208,5.0,1/1/2012,"One of wife and I's favorites places to go on a date. Always delicious food - pizza, pasta, calamari, avocado egg rolls, etc etc. All good. Service is always great. We have yet to be disappointed."
