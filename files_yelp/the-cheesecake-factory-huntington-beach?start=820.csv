Jaime T.,"Orange County, CA",488,488,223,2.0,4/9/2009,"Ok, I usually love Cheesecake Factory.  A good diverse menu that pleases everyone's palate, good drinks and atmosphere and viola everyone's happy.  But last night, something was amiss.   We ordered the sliders with cheese, fried artichoke hearts and two drinks.  The artichoke hearts tasted like pure oil.  The artichoke had no flavor at all.  Our sliders were missing something very important... 1) cheese 2) meat Yes, they forgot the meat.  Ok so it wasn't gone completely, but it was half the size of what it usually is and um, sliders are small already.   We left very disappointed and about an hour later, our stomachs were hurting.  I don't know what happened.  I'm disappointed."
Kaia V.,"Berkeley, CA",517,876,836,3.0,3/25/2009,"So after my last experience at Cheesecake factory, I didn't think I'd ever go back (at least not to this location), but corporate actually replied to a letter my breakfast companion sent outlining the insane experience we had there. They provided their apologies as well as a gift card for something like $25. I might go back just to see if they fired that awful manager!!"
Enzia F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",63,36,,4.0,8/23/2011,"It is what it is.. another chain restaurant experience, but there's something to be said about that.  The food it reliable, and it's a great place for kids.  Their portions are large.  The menu is huge... many grimy pages.  I'm sure because of all those pages, it's hard to keep clean.  It would probably take another full time employee to wipe down all those menus before they go out again.  In any case, next time I'm bringing hand wipes."
Jason M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",53,142,35,4.0,10/2/2013,"This location has great service. My favorite dishes here are the Tuscan Chicken, Grilled Artichoke, Miso Salmon, Chinese Chicken Salad, oh and the French Country Salad. The service is pretty good here, I don't usually have to ask for a refill, and they check in just enough. Now a tip to the host, if we tell you we have 3 people in our party please do not sit us at the half booths! This is awkward and tight. Especially if I am a little larger than the rest of my party. The problem is when I am meeting new people for a business meeting I don't want to create a scene and ask you to move us after one person has already been sitting waiting. And the other piece of advice it's ok if a couple of crumbs are on the table no need to reach over and clean it off while we are finishing our conversation. Sorry guys other than that you are awesome! Those are just a couple tips to put you above the rest in your own elite customer service category. Thank you for being so attentive though. This is sometimes a rarity to find and large food chains. Management you are doing a great job with hires, just a little fine tuning! Keep it up! I will always come back to this location for the good food, good service, and clean atmosphere!"
Jennifer S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,15,,5.0,9/1/2010,"I LOVE the cheesecake factory!  I was surprised to see so many bad reviews!  Their menu is extensive and everything I've tried, I LOVE! I have to say I am a sucker for eating the same thing over and over and right now I always split a Cobb Salad and the Pasta Di Vinci and of course cheesecake.  The only cheesecake I had that I didn't like, was the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake, not a fan.  But the Key Lime Cheesecake is divine and the Apple Pie Cheesecake is so good too! So sad to see so many bad reviews!  I say go!  Eat pasta and cheesecake!"
Christina P.,"Santa Ana, CA",97,51,7,4.0,4/22/2009,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory for my birthday last week.  The place was pack as hell, but me and my 2 best friends manage to grab seating outside which was great cause there was heaters out there.  We had a nice server, great guy very tentative and helpful.   I ordered some thai chicken and shrimp dish which was amazing and my other friend got this chipotle chicken pasta which was awesome as well.  I love Cheesecake Factory for the fact that they have a lot of different dishes and the portion and prices are just right. For desert I got strawberry cheesecake which was delicious.  The best cheesecake I had in a while.  My server was great and I will definitely come back again.   I would have to come back to give it a full five star."
Samady L.,"Long Beach, CA",52,95,14,3.0,1/5/2010,"Never been to cheese cake factory before, but i heard that they are very good, and Known for their cheese cake, hence the name. I didnt go to this particular one, but im pretty sure if you been to one, you been to them all. I went to one on the east coast, its a very classy setting, Food, very expensive. I ordered the Double Bacon Cheeseburger, its pretty big, but not much flavor to it, kind of like fudruckers. so for desert, i had to try a cheese cake, so i tried the brown sunday cheese cake. it was mediocre at best. Nothing compared to Harriats Unlimited Cheesecake, in ingle wood."
Attila M.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,6,1,2.0,4/23/2015,"I met a friend there for lunch today.  We had a challenge being seated at a booth that was in the bar area.  We made this request because my friend is very sensitive to light and didn't want to sit at a table that had a lot of light reflection from the windows.   We initially sat at a table that wasn't quite in the bar and also wasn't next to a window.  It was still a bit bright for my friend so when our server arrived she asked if we could move to another table.  Her response was that we could go back to the hostess to be seated at another table. Really??? We ended up just moving ourselves to another table where she did serve us because it was still in her area.  In the interest of service, she should have welcomed us to make the change and if the hostess needed to know that we moved, she could have told her.  Also, she wasn't very attentive to our needs during our time there. She didn't ask if I needed my drink (water)refilled until I was done with not only my lunch, but I had almost finished my cheesecake when she noticed that my water was empty adn asked if I wanted more.  When we wanted to ask for our left overs to be package to take home, she didn't even look our way to see if we may have needed something.  In fact, earlier Gabriel (the busboy) noticed that we needed assistance. He came and asked if we needed something.  He took care of our requests, he was pleasant, welcoming and could have taught our server a thing or two about customer service.  This isn't our first visit to your location.  Let's just say that we come there for the product (cheescake), definitely not the service.  Overall, we need to get back to true customer service."
Kelly N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",18,30,1,3.0,2/9/2010,"The place was really packed when I went in which is round 12 ish?  They seated us in the corner, which I don't really mind but somehow the waiter himself took FOREVER to come to us. The service was OKAY, it come be better. The food itself was really good. It is fattening but good. So if you guys do not mind the high calories or cholesterols then go for it. The price is okay for it's quality of the food. I would recommend it."
Melissa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",308,538,11,2.0,8/16/2009,"Mediocre! Had the Cajun Chicken ""Littles"" which are just glorified chicken strips, which I knew, 'cause I think I used to order this consistently here when I was 12. But I used to remember them having more flavor. At $13.95, it was a week's worth of food, but I probably won't finish all the leftovers, so did I really get my money's worth?  I was going to have the Red Velvet Cheesecake for dessert but I was so full from the empty calories of fried chicken that I had to pass. This place is mediocre, but it's the only place that's not an izakaya or a loud bar that's open in Orange County past 11 pm on a Saturday."
fmc c.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,146,1,1.0,8/21/2011,Food is ok.  Recommend the chicken stuffed tortilla meal.  The service on the other hand sucks.  No matter what time you arrive (I've been there at 2-3 pm and at 9-10pm) you always have to wait.
Ryan M.,"Emeryville, CA",784,912,135,2.0,10/18/2008,"I came here, almost two years ago before I decided to make my move down here in SoCal. For the server girls and the ""would be"" Peanut Butter Truffle White Chocolate Cheescake offerings. Unfortunately they didn't have my favorite cheesecake on hand since they were sold out, but at least they had complimentary smiles (didn't Washington Mutual offer that as well). The temporary service was offered with the quickness. Then again, my mind can't help but fathom and think they aren't legal enough to even take out on a date. So I repress my thoughts, take the loss of cheesecake and be on my way. Oh the joys, of being a naive and once 1/2 legal college student. My, how much time has passed."
Doug A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",63,453,107,4.0,8/20/2011,"Always a great place to eat.  Great food and service.  This location gets very busy so go during off times.  Parking can be difficult.  During better economic times, there was more value on the plates."
Karen S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",164,182,101,2.0,12/20/2008,"i don't understand the hard-ons people get for the cheesecake factory. the food is ok at best. really though, when you have 1000000 items on the menu are the cooks going to excel at anything? every salad ive had here (trust me i have tried to like this place) has been mushy from a plethora of dressing poured all over. and the icing on top of the (cheese)cake is that the salad costs $14 fucking dollars and is mostly composed of iceberg lettuce. it really doesn't help either that the service is insanely slow for how many employees this place seems to have. i think every time ive been in there are at least 3 hosts standing at the front looking pretty. plus, i don't know if anyone else has noticed, but every single server acts EXACTLY the same...they're like freaking robots! wheres the personality people? bottom line: i once dined with friends and had a mojito with a piece of cheesecake and it cost me $20...WTF!"
Lillian W.,"Long Beach, CA",112,102,43,4.0,3/27/2011,"The lights are dim, the waitresses are friendly, the drinks are strong and the food is good, what more can you ask for? The only things are I don't like is their menu is extensive and the parking situation kind of stinks. There's a lot to choose from and sometimes that isn't a good thing. This time I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it was AMAZING. I let my fiancé try it and he wanted to send his Baja tacos back."
Ryan F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",107,129,1,3.0,3/15/2009,"All Cheesecake Factories are practically the same, as far as food goes: it's delicious, really bad for you, and they give you gigantic portions. This location, in particular, is always packed full of people. Expect to wait. The outdoor patio wouldn't be so bad if it weren't right next to the street; you get a lot of car exhaust blown at you. My recommended method of attack is to drop somebody off at the door who can put your name in, then go park your car in the multi-level parking structure. Walk on over, grab a drink in the bar, and you'll have wasted a lot less time."
Duke L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,,4.0,8/6/2010,"Ok, in the interest of writing a positive review rather than killing places all the time that deserve it................  Stopped in Cheesecake Factory Huntington Beach for a quick weekday lunch at the bar...........  Hadn't been to a CCF in years.....  You sort of know what to expect, which is exactly why we like chain restaurants in the 1st place...  This review is to say the food was exactly how i remember:  large portions, good, comfort food .........  But special mention & applause for the service!  The bartender was busy, but extremely friendly, polite, courteous & professional.....  That's it ! That is all we ask ! That is what so many places do not get.  Good food. Good value are only part of it.  Make me feel welcome, act like you are happy to be there.  These guys seem to get it !"
Black X.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,692,14,4.0,10/28/2008,"This place is great.  IF you know WHO to ask for. ""DYLAN!?  IS DYLAN WORKING?"" Reply:  ""Oh...his section is full."" DAMN. No--I do not get paid by this guy...and honestly only know him from having him wait my table at this location--but let me tell you--he'll mop the floor with some of the best servers on the planet.   Water.  Refilled before I could blink.  Want an opinion on a menu item?  He'll tell you what is not that great and what is.  Want somebody who actually GIVES A DAMN if your fries come out looking like the strands of a mop used to wipe Godzilla's oily snout?  He'll have you a fresh, crisp batch in a heartbeat. I am not usually a fan of these huge chains--but my mother loves to come here and refuses to venture out into the exotic and uncharted like I do--so on our weekly outings my hands are tied--but surprisingly this place has not disappointed.  I have tried many dishes but always return to the comfortable and tasty Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Chipolte Mayo and Fries--I know, I know--basic.  But lets see you refuse that mouth watering, steaming hot fried chicken with that lovely , creamy mayo and a side of cool, garlic ranch....LETS SEE YOU WALK AWAY.  That's what I thought. My mother loves the Teriyaki Chicken and some sort of Chicken Picatta w/ Capers.  My fiance likes their Navajo Sandwich, or the  Tuna Tataki Salad (even though it sucks compared to Houston's)... So.  Ask for Dylan--and relax.  Even if the kitchen screws up your order at least you can be assured that your server will make things right."
Christin D.,"San Antonio, TX",6,78,1,2.0,9/16/2011,"What's the hype about this place anyway? I went for my aunts birthday, yeah huge crowd of us. we took up half the place with all of us. Anyway, the menu.. Jesus can you have more food options on there? Took me 30 minutes to figure out what i wanted and i still had 3 pages of menu left. Its the ultimate munchies place to eat. The cheesecake is good, I'll give it that, we used to sell it at a place i worked at back in the day. but the red velvet? yarg. so much icing, and its the thick buttercream-esque stuff that leaves a thin film down your throat after you swallow it. Maybe its just me, when i go to a place to eat, i like an assortment of good eats, but this place just kind of overwhelms me. The staff, really nice people. We enjoyed our waiter. but sorry to say, I probably won't eat here again"
Garrett L.,"Los Alamitos, CA",498,332,76,4.0,10/13/2008,"I came here for my friend's birthday last Friday night. It was so busy that the wait for like an hour, but my friend wanted to wait. But then again....it is always busy. So we waited at the bar getting a little tipsy before we got to sit down for dinner. It took longer than i thought because i needed food to balance my body of food and alcohol. FINALLY they seat us and it was a huge relief. I was starving so i just got the 3 cheese pasta, which was really really good. It was a nice portion and it filled me up pretty well. I was pretty happy sipp'n on my long island ice tea. My friend forgot to tell the waiter that it was her birthday because she was too shy. We didn't want to embarrass her so we didn't say anything. The service was awesome. The guy was really nice and took our order correctly. We tipped him well since my friend thought he was cute. So actually she tipped him well, i tipped normally. They have to dress in all white which is cool, but it would suck if they spilled something on themselves because it would really show. After dinner i wanted to get some cheesecake to take home so i got a slice of the pecan cheesecake and it was like 7 bucks. Sorta expensive, but really good."
