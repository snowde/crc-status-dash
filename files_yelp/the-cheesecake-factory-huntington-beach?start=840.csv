Chris N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",15,173,45,2.0,9/2/2009,"This review is for their cheesecake specifically, not their meals. I have a thing for cheesecake (plain/ny style) and have tried a good amount of them from different places. It's my favorite dessert. One would expect cheesecake from cheesecake factory to be top notch cheesecake, but it's not. In fact, NY style cheesecake from my local pavilions bakery and honey baked ham, are vastly superior. First off, the cheesecake filling is very goopy, and has the consistency of pre-made filling cheesecake. Quality cheesecake is very dense, enough to stick a metal fork in. It wasn't. Also good cheesecake has a thicker outer skin, and a golden bronze color on the top. Didn't have either. The crust also sucked, and it's not as tall as NY style cheesecake is supposed to be. Price was a little steep. Was $7 per slice, and still not as good as a $4 slice from modest bakeries.  Of course the selection of cheesecake was very good. And maybe other varieties are better, but I doubt it. As any true cheesecake connoisseur knows, it's a sin to dump topping, and mix in flavors in a cheesecake that is supposed to be good enough on it's own!"
Austin M.,"Dallas, TX",132,135,62,5.0,1/12/2009,"Okay, I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory(s) many times. I'm a Cheesecake Factory veteran, but I must leave an excellent review for this one. I came here after a long day at the Huntington Beach pier. I was starving, and moody, so I wasn't in the best mood. The waiter that helped us was probably one of the most polite, nicest, well-mannered waiter I have ever had. He was super nice, and helpful, and very attentive. So the waiter was enough to shift my mood from mad, to happy. The food always taste great whenever I come here, so nothing new about that, but seriously, that waiter should get a raise, because he makes this particular Cheesecake Factory look good! I guess I should also say that I always love the way Cheesecake Factory(s) look inside. The decor is great, and I love how it's slightly dark during dinner, it's fabulous.  I will eat here again sometime, and hopefully I get that fantastic waiter again, ahah."
Anhers M.,"Santa Ana, CA",226,781,92,4.0,12/9/2008,"Gordon Ramsey would be utterly horrified by this place. For all you people who don't know what I'm talking about, Kitchen Nightmares number one rule is keep your menu simple. This show, by the way, is so funny. A British chef cursing at American restaurant owners who are usually idiots. GREAT TELEVISION.  The Cheesecake Factory's menu is thick filled with delicious choices and strange advertisements. I've never had bad service there so I don't know what everyone is talking about. The wait can be long sometimes but they give you a beeper so you can shop.  The cheesecake is pretty good but tastes very processed and manufactured. I'm a Junior's cheesecake kind of girl. My favorites: Macaroni balls factory burrito chopped salad (bleu cheese paradise)"
XO X.,"Fresno, CA",30,188,,4.0,1/14/2011,"Busy place on a Thursday evening! I  meet  with a friend/associate here for dinner and to discuss business. I was promptly greeted as I was told where I could find our table(my friend was seated just a few minutes before I arrived). Our server was attentive yet chill and gave us plenty of ""space"" to talk and do our thing. She checked on us a few times, and made sure we were okay. I do appreciate the relaxed yet attentive approach, because no one likes to be asked every few minutes...is everything okay? I would recommend ordering their salads and the Cappuccino was very good. Overall nice experience. Be advised the parking lot gets very full and can be frustrating. Also be careful on their floors...very very slick. Enjoy!"
Samantha T.,"Westminster, CA",61,76,1,3.0,7/11/2011,"So I was craving for some Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake and decided to go to this one since it's closest to home. I get there around 8:35pm, TODAY. Parking is a b*tch there, but anyways I walk straight to the bakery. No one greets me as I was gazing across the fridge full of cheesecake. Then the worker with glasses and curly hair told me to wait. I understand that the workers should take care of the dine-in customers first, but after she was done with it, she still didn't take my order and started to clean the work area. I saw two other people waiting there before me. I stood there for a good 15 minutes and I got fed up. All I wanted was a freakin slice of cheesecake. I didn't think it would take so long! All she could've done was at least take my order, cut out a slice, put it in a dam box and hand it to me, and I would be happy. I don't even need the whip cream nor a freakin bag for it. I've dine here 2-3 times. But first time ordering at the bakery. Honestly, I would not come back to this place. I'd rather drive to Irvine Spectrum for a piece of freakin cheesecake, which I'll probably do NOW.. Now I understand why my boss always tells me to stop at whatever I'm doing, always greet a customer and take their order right when they come in. As I thought about it, maybe I just happened to come at the wrong time on the wrong day. I would come back since it's the CLOSEST one to me.Dining in, I still have no problem. And since my boyfriend went in to get it for me, there wasn't a long wait this time. Though I did call in THIS TIME to order ahead of time. But my boyfriend did say when he came in, they cut out a slice and put it in a box for him right away. So all is dandy. BTW, new favorite plate, MISO SALMON. (: (tried it in Vegas and was absolutely hooked on it)"
Srinivasulu A.,"Irvine, CA",1,3,,2.0,11/29/2013,"Garlic bread was burnt, pasta was under cooked. Bad experience over all. Don't recommend."
Grace T.,"Huntington Beach, CA",101,485,44,4.0,6/22/2011,"RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. 5/5 stars, it is so decadent and DELICIOUS! they start you off with bread and butter. there's a dark brown bread, i don't know what it's called but its sweet and there's oats on the outside. it is so good, i always ask for more my favorite thing to order here is the louisiana cajun chicken pasta.it's bowtie pasta with parmesean crusted chicken in a semi spicy cream sauce."
Vi N.,"Los Angeles, CA",502,93,4,4.0,5/2/2011,I know I'm not supposed to like chain restaurants but this is one of those places to go to when you just want something consistent that you know will taste good. I come here for the chicken madeira and for their guacamole. Yum. The sauce for the madeira is delicious and the meat is always tender.
Sandra S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,13,,4.0,1/2/2012,"How surprised we are to read poor reviews for the customer service.   Our experience was just the opposite. Customer service:  5 stars Food: 4 stars When i called on New Year's Day to find out if the restaurant was open, the person answering the phone was friendly and helpful. We arrived about 7:30pm expecting to wait well over an hour for a holiday, but instead we were told it would only be 35-40 minutes.  How pleased we were when our buzzer vibrated after 15-20 minutes!   Several people attended to us (menus, set-ups, water, bread, and ordering) quickly without being pushy.  We had two food servers, Shelby and Ashley, who were wonderful.  When one was scheduled for a brief break, she brought the other over to introduce us and to make sure we knew what to expect.  This is what customer service is all about.  These two women were pleasant and professional.   Sometimes my husband and I feel cheated because quality service seems to be a thing of the past.  This was not the case on New Year's.  The food at the HB Cheesecake Factory was plentiful and tasty, however, the customer service at this location is why we would return."
Jon R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",114,53,1,5.0,6/9/2009,"It had been a while since i had been to the Cheesecake factory not because it isn't good but because it was always so busy and crowded, i wish i worked there lol... but one day i was craving it and went at an odd hour where i knew it wouldn't be busy....  Got seated right away, had an amazing, funny, down to earth surfer guy... which is always good but i ordered this pasta where i basically mixed 3 different kinds together and they not only did it, but they didn't charge me extra, it was perfect, and it tasted amazing, the server remembered my questions from before hand and checked up with me, it was just PERFECT SERVICE, the server deserved his 20 dollar tip... the avo rolls are also bomb... the service that night was a 5 star but over all the place gets 4"
Ethan H.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,10,,1.0,2/16/2009,"God, I fucking hate this place. For one, it literally took me half an hour to find a parking spot. I circled the lot outside Barnes and Noble for a good twenty minutes, dodging crazy Bella Terra-ers and their huge fucking SUVs and people who think the road is a sidewalk, before FINALLY driving all the way back to the structure to park on the second floor. And it was raining. Second, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY DAMN ITEMS ON THE MENU? It was like I was reading a cookbook. How many different salads and pastas can you possibly make? I decided to pick the basic soup and salad (because it was lunch) for fear of the chef forgetting to make what I ordered. The (garlic) caesar salad was more garlic than caesar, and my soup that looked like beef stew was mediocre. Towards the end, it felt like I was eating soil. The meat had a weird texture that settled on the bottom. At least our server was fast and a bit friendly, unlike other experiences I've had at this same location. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T EAT HERE."
Ariane C.,"Garden Grove, CA",8,6,23,4.0,11/6/2011,"Had brunch/llunch with my sister today in Bella Terra.  I know I'm biased because The Cheesecake Factory is my ""happy place"" but they never seem to fail to deliver a great meal.  I had the Bourbon Street Omelette today and it was delicious.  Love the andouille sausage."
Nancy N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",111,83,48,5.0,5/30/2011,They have the best calamari ever. Their customer service is immaculate and exceeds my expectations! I like the servers' white uniforms. I always have a great experience at Cheesecake. Love their delicious cheesecake and I rarely eat dessert.
Tracy H.,"Menifee, CA",404,6,1,1.0,1/30/2011,"SO...i was so super sad, cause our experience was so terrible. The food was okay, but the service was as stinky as rotten cheese. The waiter was m.i.a pretty much all night. My hubby ordered beer, and after waiting 20 minutes, the wrong freaking beer came...really? It got worse throughout the night, but all in all a horrible time. shame shame, you really let me down. Im not mad, just very disappointed!"
Anjelica A.,"Garden Grove, CA",95,49,9,4.0,11/26/2008,"I've been going to this Cheesecake Factory since it opened and I love it.  The servers are VERY nice and very attentive to you, as if you are their only customers, even though they are constantly busy.  Anything at Cheesecake Factory is great, they give large portions for their prices and you always end up bringing food home. The only downside is that the parking right by the Cheesecake Factory is a 2 hour limit, but there is a parking garage over by the movie theaters, and if you're there for dinner and a movie, or shopping, parking there isn't too bad. I highly suggest the Lemoncello Torte or Strawberry Shortcake for dessert if you do go! Cheers!"
desiree t.,"Westminster, CA",18,102,17,1.0,7/30/2008,"Only accepts reservations up until 5pm, meaning if you want to make a reservation for dinner, it's first come first served. Ridiculous. That place is always packed and they want to refuse reservations for the busiest few hours? I think I'll just use my gift certificate for desserts."
Tom L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,5,,3.0,1/27/2012,"Let me just start by saying that I have never been a big fan of this place, and I've been here 3 or 4 times.  But it was my mother's birthday, so here we are.  Well it's super dark in there, but I'm okay with that.  The decor is a little tacky if you actually look up and around.  The food was sub par as before, so nothing has changed.  However, our server was super friendly, and checked on us continually with drink refills, etc.  Dessert was good, obviously if the cheesecake was bad this place would be out of business.   TL;DR: Food (chicken parm) = bland              Cheesecake = good             Service = great"
Todd S.,"Long Beach, CA",27,25,,3.0,7/19/2011,Overrated. Don't get me wrong. The service is good. Staff is friendly. But the food was just average. No wow factor. But the cheesecake was delicious!
Suzn L.,"Anaheim, CA",71,325,55,4.0,5/23/2009,These stars are for the waitless bar and the new reasonably priced tapas style menu.  Wow the wild mushroom pizzarette was just yummilicious.   The garlic sausage was good and nicely presented in a rectangular mini pan. Drinks...the Ritz and Sangria...sooo good. Service...nicely done.  We had to only seats available at the bar.  Our server set up our bar table with white cloth like the actual dining experience.   I will definitely come back more often.
Crystal K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/3/2015,"First off, i came here on my birthday mid day for lunch on a weekday. I waited 15 minutes to be seated which i was fine with. Me and my bf got seated and knowing him he went to the ""bathroom"" to tell the host that it was my birthday since the waiter was running around covering what seemed to me like too many tables. So we got through dinner and we heard 4 other bday songs around us. I never got anything and im not big on the whole singing thing, me and my bf have been going here for both our bdays for the last 3 years and when he told the host when we were leaving what had happened she was chatting away with the other host and was said oh let me do that now. By then it was too late, i was headed towards them and so she asked oh so you dont want it? like it was a real question. Honestly, we do this to eachother for the fun behind it but for this to happen after last time a hair was found in our food and that it seemed like they cut back on servers but not chatty hosts i probably wont be coming here again."
