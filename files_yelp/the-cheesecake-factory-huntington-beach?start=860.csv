Sandilee M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,57,3,5.0,12/3/2011,"We stopped by for lunch today after Christmas shopping. Our waiter, Dillon, was SO sweet and friendly---I so appreciate good & friendly service! The food of course was so delish as usual and no cheesecake tastes as good as their Vanilla Bean, yum! Keep up the GREAT service folks! :D"

John B.,"Long Beach, CA",63,95,44,4.0,4/1/2011,"We went for Ken's Birthday.  Sunday after a movie.  We missed the lunch rush, so we had good service.  Of course we started with appetizers (for a great value, check out the Chicken Croquettes) and then more food than we could eat.  Take home containers were needed, BUT also a To-Go order of their new cheesecake- RED VELVET CAKE CEESECAKE - yes, they took Red Velvet Cake and merged it with Cheesecake, OMG, no make that O! My! Front Door! G! - I wanted to eat it all, but had to share and keeping my blood sugar in check that was the right thing to do.  If I was 20 again, I could eat multiple servings all by myself, it is that good."
Chi N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",15,165,85,4.0,12/26/2010,"If you're on a carb binge, the red velvet cheesecake is a MUST TRY. The slices are huge and the flavor is extremely rich so a few bites and you're on a sugar high. YUM!"
ben b.,"Edinburg, VA",0,18,,1.0,11/2/2011,"Yea, had horrible experiences across the board at ths one.  1. charged me for my food and my gf twice.  2. came back to complain and they said are you sure. No i am just looking at my bank statement and i cant read.  3. told me my arugula salad was arugula. no it actually was all spinach, mind you we were all in chefs whites and all graduated from culinary school and all have had experience in the industry.  4 manager was rude"
Morgan J.,"Orange, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/24/2013,I always enjoy there food. The Thai Lettuce wraps......YUM! very recommended...pairs well with the tempura shrimp.
Sd S.,"Long Beach, CA",5,23,,4.0,12/3/2011,"You know what you're getting here. Not the greatest food, but better than most and consistant. Parking is not that great at this location but you may also valet park."
Troy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1041,827,183,3.0,7/7/2008,"I've never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. But my past couple of visits have changed my mind.  Yesterday, I had lunch with a business associate and friend who happens to be in the upper ranks of the company. The food quality was actually quite tasty.   I tried the new chicken sliders. These things were amazing. They were a spin off the Chik Fil-A. But these things were moister, tender, and better!  The wasabi crusted Ahi was great. And the miso sauce and rice was terrific!   The fish was seared a perfect rare. The portion was HUGE! And even better: It was fresh, NOT frozen tuna!!!  This past experience has made me a believer....."
Maria H.,"Long Beach, CA",0,296,3,4.0,1/13/2011,Good service and food was good. We get take out here as well as have eaten here. I am a definite fan!
Julianne M.,"Anaheim, CA",26,88,,4.0,4/18/2011,"I'm always a fan of the Cheesecake factory. I tried the Thai lettuce wraps (an appetizer) for my main entree this time, and wasn't sure whether to expect something like PF Chang's famous lettuce wraps.  This was very delicious and quite different.  You assemble your own lettuce wraps, sort of like a fajita bar, and I had more food than I could manage.  I'll definitely be doing that again."
Craig D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,27,,4.0,11/12/2013,"One of my favorite places for lunch or a late breakfast.  These guys have a very eclectic menu and everything is good.  Their lunch cobb salad is outstanding, and their omelets are about as good as it gets."
Dianne L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",14,61,1,3.0,12/30/2010,"Normally, I wouldn't go to a Cheesecake Factory because I've been scarred from past experiences, but my cousin forced me to go this time. She somehow convinced me that this one is good and that I'd like it. However, she was only partly correct.    Since it was just the two of us, we were seated at a two person table, (obviously) but it was located right next to a cramped area, making movement limited. The table next to us was also extremely close to ours.    I ordered a Smokehouse Burger and it was a little over 10 dollars, so I guess that's a decent price for a restaurant burger..but the buns were soggy. As soon as I lifted it, the bottom bun just fell apart. My cousin ordered the Four Cheese Pasta and she enjoyed it, though. Our waitress was kind enough to bring us hot towels after our meal.    For dessert, we ordered a Chocolate Chip Cheesecake and it was delicious. Highlight of the meal, actually.  After we finished eating, it was hard to track down our waitress. She came a couple minutes later to drop off the check, but never came back to pick it up. We waited for about 15 minutes but nothing so we just decided to leave. Seems like it'd be easy to dine 'n dash there but at least we paid and gave a tip, right?"
Bess B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",31,21,6,4.0,6/27/2011,"My husband and I enjoy Cheesecake Factory. They do a pretty good job at offering a consistent product so we always know what to expect.   We don't care for their cheesecake. Ya, I know that sounds odd, but it is so over the top sweet and rich. It's like eating butter, no thanks. What we love is  the fresh basket of warm sourdough and brown bread they place on the table. Delicious!!!!!  Now on to what we had there Saturday evening. I had one of my favorites, the Chinese Chicken Salad. It is a huge salad with lettuce, cabbage, slivered almonds, thinly sliced chicken, mandarin oranges, a delicious tangy dressing and a gigantic mound of crispy rice noodles on top. Since I am never able to finish this salad, I ask for the dressing on the side to preserve the crispness of the lettuce, so I can bring 1/2 home and have it the following day. While the salad was delicious as always, I have noticed that on the last few visits there is less and less chicken. My husband got the club sandwich which comes with french fries. This is a typical club with turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato.. All this goodness is placed between three pieces of sourdough bread. He loved it, and also took 1/2 home for the following day. The fries were amazing, I know 1st hand as I periodically helped myself throughout our meal.  The service was outstanding. We were greeted warmly when we sat at a high top in the bar. Our server was friendly and promptly took our drink order and returned with my chardonnay and my husband's cold beer. She was attentive during our meal, but did not make us feel rushed. Hint: This place is very busy, we always skip the wait to  dine in the dining room and head for the bar where we can help ourselves to a high top. We go just before regular lunch or dinner hours. Their happy hour is really great too. Summary: *Huge portions *Consistent product *Many high calorie/high fat items, be careful if you are trying to eat   healthy *Grab a high top in the bar rather than waiting in line for the dining room *Fairly consistent service"
Kelli O.,"Costa Mesa, CA",13,25,,4.0,1/18/2011,"I always enjoy coming to Cheesecake because their service is great, the food is delicious and the drinks are yummy! I had lunch with my aunt at the Bella Terra location and it did not disappoint. We ordered some appetizers and drinks, and enjoyed every bit of it... their decor is gorgeous... and what surprised me the most was their service! I wish I could remember her name, but she served us in the bar area and she was soooo sweet and attentive... it was like we were getting pampered! Would definitely come to this location again!"
Mike P.,"Chino, CA",1,5,,5.0,8/24/2011,"Despite being super busy, quick seating and superlative service. Top notch."
Sarah T.,"Long Beach, CA",258,200,1,4.0,5/3/2007,"Seems I only review things I either love or hate so I'm changing this up a bit! Here's one straight down the middle for ya! Never been an uber fan of The Cheesecake Factory, although they do make some might fine cheesecake. (no surprise) Their food is typical--salads, pastas, pizzas, burgers, etc. None of which I've ever been disappointed with, but never been amazed. Tried this location after shopping @ DVD Planet (see next review) and was absolutely thrilled with the service! (thus the 4 stars) Even though it was the lunch rush we were promptly seated in a booth (love booths!) and greeted immediately by our server, Kimberly N. She was FANTASTIC! Super friendly--but not fake friendly or scary weird friendly--just seemed like she really enjoyed what she was doing. (maybe she's new?) Anyway, drinks came out quick, food came out quick & tasty and we were checked up on frequently. At one point they tried to give me another salad! Maybe they could smell the 'yelp' on me?? (ok, not really...they'd made a mistake) I'm just sad I didn't have room for their famous cheesecake. =( After this experience I'd definitely go back....maybe just for drinks & dessert....mmmMMmmmm"
Nicholas N.,"Bellflower, CA",45,15,1,4.0,4/16/2011,"Although I love this places food, I am not a fan of the length of time it sometimes takes. Although a lot of the servers here are also very great and polite and all around fun, you also have to be aware of the bad few that will literally make you feel as though you want to ask for another server. But, overall, it's a great place with great food."
Eric F.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,105,2,4.0,4/14/2013,"I hate to be biased, but for some reason, I wanted to dislike the Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe it was the incredible wait times I used to experience at the Redondo Beach and MDR locations from the past.  Came by for some lunch and was greeted warmily upon entering and my waitress was on top of her game.  I asked her for suggestions and she gladly provided some of her favorites.  Ordered the tuna tartare and cajun jambalaya suggestion.  Very good.  This location is a keeper.  Good food and excellent service.  What else can you ask for."
Eddie C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,48,,4.0,5/26/2011,"I went here yesterday and I must say, this is one of my favorite medium end restaurants. The decor reminds me of the Belagio hotel in Las Vegas. The food and service is always good. Parking on the weekends sucks, so I usually have the car valet parked by some high school space cadet working the valet. The wait was not too long either. I suggest this place to all who read my review. This place is groovy."
