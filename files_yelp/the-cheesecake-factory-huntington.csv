Kona K.,"Huntington Station, NY",11,281,2,4.0,1/4/2018,"I have been coming here since they demolished the Whitman Theatre on this spot ( I saw some of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, the original ""Jaws""  as well as some others over the years-- I'm old).  This is the better / best ? Cheesecake Factory out of all the Long Island locations. (The one by Roosevelt Field is a zoo/circus/ horror show on weekends! Lots of lovely police activity too!) The food here is always consistent . You'll never have a bad meal here. (Well, I didn't.)  You'll never have a bad server here- (well I never have).  But here's the thing (Jerry Seinfeld voice) ................................ I *never* come here during PEAK hours : Friday, Saturday ( 6 to 11 PM) & Sunday (brunch/early dinner time 12:00 noon to 5 PM) .  By choice-- I do not have a family and children. And as sad and lonely as that may be perceived -- by some-- it allows me to ....  GO OUT TO DINNER ANY TIME I WANT (ba ha ha ha ha ha!) .  (Tuesday night @ 9:58 PM-- c'mon let's GO! The entire place is empty and we can sit anywhere want--  like we own the f***ing place! Opulence! )  I avoid crowds here on Long Island like a bloody tampon avoids a shark tank. I actually never experienced that long long Cheescake Factory wait wherein the waiting area is clogged with people in heavy winter coats looking like they wanna kill & eat each other.  Moreover -that God damned ""wait for the buzzer"" thingie has never touched my greasy palm and I have NEVER pressed my snotty nose up against the Cheesecake glass display cases while waiting for a table and looking like a zombie from ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the case is filled with People flavored cheesecake.  The other pitfall of eating out during *PEAK* hours is that the staff  here (or anywhere) is only human- and humans get burnt out.  Food comes out less than perfect, orders take forever to come out, meat gets cooked wrong, orders get cold, orders get forgotten, kitchen runs outta food, server gets irritated, no utencils, no napkins, no drink refills, no space at the bar and then bartender ignores you, restrooms get gross and crowded & toilet paper all over the floor, place gets REALLY noisy , etc.  Oh yeah,  the food:  I ordered the Buffalo Strips and my gosh they were delicious - in fact I am ordering them as my DINNER next time (they were an appetizer-- plenty to share for 2 people. If had this as a dinner --this and a side salad would be perfect! ).   For dinner I had the Fried Shrimp platter and it was gigantic -- could not finish it (and I'm a ""big eater"" guy).  Of Note: Cheesecake Factory's condiments are outta this world ! I know this sounds strange but their tarter sauce and blue cheese (HUGE chunks of cheese within) dressing tasted better than what you'd get at a 5-star steak house in NYC !  Only Bummer:  a small single serve bottle of Ginger Ale was $3.50 as it ""came from the bar"". As you know , bars like to OVER CHARGE for drinks that are ""components"" to their mixers.  Nonsense. Ginger Ale should be on tap--it's a basic soft drink AND mixer.   So there ya go."
Kerry M.,"Manorville, NY",9,74,32,2.0,12/27/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the one in Smith Haven Mall a million times and always have a good experience. Even when the place is overflowing with people, staff is friendly and attentive.  Huntington Station location-awful. Our server was friendly but slow as anything. It took us an hour and a half to just have dinner. No appetizers. No dessert.  When the food finally came, my friend's salad was supposed to have chicken and it had none. But we were unable to get anyone's attention to get it rectified. When we finally spoke to another server we were told ""oh I'm watching her table for 15 minutes"" oh ok. Because we haven't seen her in 30 and you did a very bad job watching us. I then asked for a manager who never came over to the table. Wonderful customer service. They gave us a whopping $5 off for the salad. You clearly know we were unhappy for a number of reasons and we get $5. Fantastic. Then I order three slices of cheesecake to go...20 minutes later ....  Huntington Station Cheesecake Factory- you need to step up your game. This is unacceptable."
Chris R.,"East Meadow, NY",0,4,3,1.0,12/19/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has Cheesecakes that range from decent to good...but absolutely nothing else. The servers are nice but the management and chefs are challenged to say the least.  I ordered the Chipotle Chicken Pasta. It seemed intriguing because i didn't think the flavors would ever work together. I'm not the best chef, but my suspicion of the dish was warranted. Never have I smelled a more foul substance. The flavors flat out don't work. The combination of crunchy textures with soft texture do not mix. The sugary sweet cream sauce combined with the spice of chipotle do not mix. The pasta was a little undercooked but it was drenched in sauce. And altogether the dish was a mess. I took a few bites and sent it back. The server asked if I wanted to swap it out for something else but I was so revolted I just wanted to wait for my wife to finish her meal so we could leave. The server then came back and said her manager tasted it and he said it was fine. I disagreed but i thought that was that...then they BILLED me for it. I had a gift card from two years ago that I never used so I didn't argue and paid the bill.  I've never been a fan of this restaurant. The wait is never worth the sub, sub, SUB-par food. And now, since the managers don't give a shit about their restaurants inadequate performance, I'll never go back. Hell, never would've gone there to begin with if it weren't for finding an unused gift card in my junk drawer."
Kaitlyn K.,"Levittown, NY",215,119,295,4.0,10/3/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory location multiple times, for different meals, and have never been disappointed! Upon walking in, the lighting is warm, the seating is comfortable, and spaced well so you're not on top of the party next to or behind you.  The booths are roomy and comfortable.  I've had the nachos and the buffalo triangles for appetizers and WOW, both are very filling, so if you're just two people I'd advise you pick just one.  For a larger party, you can get both and everyone can enjoy each with a generous serving.  I've had multiple sandwiches and a few items off of the SkinnyLicious menu throughout my visits and loved everything I've ordered.  For dessert (if there is room... or if that's what you came for), I suggest the s'mores cheesecake or the seasonal pumpkin pecan cheesecake (it's devilishly delicious). Bon appetite!"
Amanda K R.,"Lindenhurst, NY",51,96,446,5.0,10/24/2017,"5 stars because they are sinfully delish and have amazing service.   If you're counting calories, this is not the place for you.  However, feel like I've somewhat circumvented that when I order from the appetizer/small plate part of the GIANT menu- extensive Goat cheese beet salad and the shrimp spring rolls- died and gone to foodie heaven.   Calories replaced with the Lemon Drop Martinis however. So good I've made every attempt to recreate and perfect at home- nailed it!  Never a disappointment except if you come during peak hours and weekends, Be patient and prepared to wait.  So worth it though."
Kristy F.,"East Northport, NY",210,38,53,5.0,8/29/2017,"I don't know how they manage to have a menu that's so large, yet everything I ever get is always amazing. The portions are huge, so whatever you get, if you want Dessert, skip the appetizers and save room for the Cheesecake. My boyfriend and I each got a slice for dessert and we didn't even nearly finish them, we were so full. We got the celebration cheesecake that looks like funfetti, and the lemon tarte cake which was also amazing.  There is a good wait too, so be prepared to wait or try and go for lunch or an odd time. They don't take reservations so trying to go here with a large party is very difficult and I do not recommend it. Anymore than 6 people and it becomes very difficult.  Also, if you go for lunch and are getting a pasta or salad, get the lunch portion. It's still massive and cheaper!"
James W.,"Old Bethpage, NY",25,3,,4.0,1/7/2018,"Surprisingly good. Haven't been to one in a long time. Long wait but food was good and so was the service . Cheesecake was also awesome. If you don't mind the wait during busy hours , it's definitely a great place to eat and grab some drinks."
Melissa J.,"Cairo, NY",16,80,19,2.0,12/3/2017,"Came in on a Friday night, which I 100% expect to be very crowded, and it was. Even despite the crowd, it wasn't too long of a wait after having a drink at the bar.  I have to say, my server was very nice but I couldn't believe the length of time it took for things to come out. We had nachos as an app the took nearly 30mins to come out, another 30 mins to get to the food. Ok I can still somewhat understand, the kitchen gets backed up, things coming out slower. By the time we had finished eating, much of the restaurant had emptied out. At this point we were ready for cheesecake. This is where I become most frustrated. The slices of cake take not time to get. They don't involve cooking but it still took nearly 30mins for them to make it to the table, and an insane amount of time for us to pay. I love Cheesecake Factory but don't think I'll be back to this location anytime soon."
Brenda J.,"Queens, NY",104,57,309,3.0,6/24/2017,"Just like any chain restaurant, it's crowded and noisy. It's mainly families and people celebrating different occasions and I even got to listen to a happy birthday song too.  The food was pretty good for a chain. We got the Mac and cheese balls, crispy Cuban rolls, parmesan chicken pizza and a house salad because I need some type of vegetable with my meals! The Mac and cheese was delicious and I was also amazed that the chicken parmesan pizza was a round flat chicken topped with sauce and pasta. The service was great although they tend to take away plates even though we weren't done yet. I also ordered the classic margarita which was smaller than I imagined. We got two cheesecakes - the Reeses cheesecake and the keylime cheesecake. I couldn't choose since there were dozens of choices! I would say it's not the best but definitely try one of their special concoctions!"
Mellie M.,"Flushing, NY",4,18,60,3.0,10/22/2017,"This place is ok, a little too noisy for me for a Saturday afternoon. The food was good, the service not so good, the server seemed to have too much going on, she took our order after her introduction and we rarely seen her after that. Another person brought our food and the meatballs were cold, so we returned them to get them reheated. We had to ask for refills of our waters twice by someone else, so by the time my husband's food came back out, I  ate my meal and was done with it. They ended up replacing his meal with a fresh one, which we appreciated, but still ate separately.  I will return to try other meals on the menu and hopefully have a better experience."
Butta D.,"Huntington Station, NY",1,27,48,1.0,11/30/2017,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory! From the miso salmon to the original cheesecake it's a delight to dine there EXCEPT for this location in huntington NY! This time I ordered fire cracker salmon. How on earth can you mess that up? Well look below and you will see. Yet it's still a whopping $15. To add insult to injury we didn't get bread, butter, napkins, or utensils. Now get ready for some real comedy!!! When I called back the manger said "" you must ask for utensils""! Wait what? When I sit down in your establishment I don't have to ask for utensils. His response ""you aren't dining in""! This establishment needs to close immediately. Just look at the other reviews"
Ms J.,"New York, NY",0,140,3912,5.0,12/3/2017,"Thank you for your outstanding and attentive service, Angel!!! Our family had a wonderful dining experience and definitely will be back and request for you. Thank you very much for your patience too, Angel!!! As you can see, we can eat! :)"
Joseph C.,"Garden City, NY",224,117,50,1.0,10/23/2017,Unfortunately  6/30/17 Every spot full in the curbside section - nobody in cars. On hold as a total over 30 minutes  Rang for three minutes each time no answer at the curbside phone line Already paid for order or else I would have left. Manager placed order and since it was two salads it was prepared quickly. I have no complaints about how fast the food is prepared and on time as mentioned at all. It's the fact that it takes from 20-45 minutes to just get the order placed. This is really unfortunate but this coupled with the last few times I ordered the food was improperly prepared I really am disappointed with the whole way this store has degraded. Perhaps a management change occurred here?  If I didn't like Cheesecake Factory it wouldn't be such a big deal but I'm not able to order here anymore unless I have a couple hours set aside. Such a waste. Sizes of chicken on accompanying salads Pizza parmigiana  No beets in vegetable salad
Crème B.,"Hunter, NY",0,57,,2.0,11/29/2017,"I would not return to this location.  I waited for a long time for  my food to come out. The place was not busy at all.  I THOUGHT it would be fresh, especially since I waited so long!  The food was not fresh and was not hot.  Dessert.......This is The Cheesecake Factory.  The cheesecake I ordered (plain) was not fresh, as well.  The management needs to get on top of things.....Either that or stop trying to cut corners. The restaurant is clean and the service is friendly.  I hope that the quality of the food will become what it should be."
Paula B.,"Carle Place, NY",14,92,253,4.0,6/22/2017,"This is always a great choice for lunch or dinner. Food is consistently prepared over the years. Today, we all had the Mexican tortilla salad from SkinnyLicious menu. It was delicious. The crispy tortilla at the bottom of the salad was the yummy treat once you cleared the salad from it. Chicken breast, black beans, romaine, salsa verde and cilantro dressing make this one enjoyable lunch."
Milli P.,"Bay Shore, NY",128,35,137,5.0,12/16/2017,"Hopefully he's workin when you go ask for Joe Z he literally saved me from making every mistake while ordering. His suggestions are amazing !! Listen to him and you will definitely have an amazing dinning experience. I had the south west egg rolls , loaded baked potato tater tots , the cheese burger . For drinks I had a mudslide with an extra shot of vodka ... don't judge me ... I just finished Christmas shopping ... then I had the strawberry creamsicle ... it's literally a spike strawberry milkshake."
Patrick G.,"Massapequa, NY",4,70,121,4.0,7/22/2017,"Happy Hour (Mon-Fri, 4-6p) is a very underrated good deal. Drink specials and discounts on what I think are the best things at CF, appetizers -- make for an enjoyable and budget-friendly visit. My wife and I share some beers (I'm always happy with Sam Summer Ale is on tap), and a few appies -- including delicious southern fried chicken sliders, the always tasty avacado eggrolls and yummy chicken samosas. As Walt Whitman mall is right there... and Macy's is at the opposite end... you can try to walk off some of those fried calories in comfort!"
Christine C.,"Brooklyn, NY",43,68,61,4.0,8/17/2017,"I like this place ... I know what can I say? I'm a salad lover and they have a really good lunch size Cobb salad that is very tasty and really perfect size. Sometimes these salads are so big it's like diving into a farm stand... too much! This one is a perfect size. Unsweetened mint green iced tea? Yes, please and thank you! Our waitress was sweet. I was full and stayed low calorie! Win - win!"
Liz C.,"Desert View Village, Phoenix, AZ",145,2,,3.0,10/14/2017,"Love the consistency of the food at this and other locations. In fact, when I visit NY it is the go to place when meeting up with friends. It is for that reason that I was highly disappointed last night. The food as always was great, but the service was less than satisfactory. It took over 10 minutes to have our waters refilled, I ordered a drink from the bar and my drink arrived 15-20 minutes after those for my friends. It also took an extremely long time to get our check at the end of the meal, to the point we needed to ask a manager to come over.  Hoping the service is better the next time around."
Mala L.,"New York, NY",469,282,1014,3.0,1/23/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is like a jack of all trades but master of none. Here you will find a very large variety of standard, American fare. The menu is a mini spiral bound book. There is something for everything. And the service is pretty friendly and attentive as well. Also, everything about this place is big. The restaurant is big; the menu is big; portions are big; the slices of cheesecake are BIG. I'm not a huge fan of chains...but if you must, you must. Overall, I like it here, this location specifically, because it's consistent. They've had a full house each time that I've dined which is always a good sign. Solid 3 stars."
Naina C.,"Venice, CA",127,1,,1.0,11/24/2017,"This is by far the worst cheesecake I've ever been to, I have traveled cross country and have been to the one in Hawaii as well. This has to be the worst cheesecake by far. They are always missing items on the menu. There are fruit flies all over the place. For a corporate company as big as cheesecake i expected better and you have lost me as a long life nationwide customer."
Amrita A.,"New York, NY",117,148,486,5.0,9/17/2016,"I have only had their cheesecake yet- the original, and t was just perfect. Not too dense and perfectly sweet.  I ate half before writing this review and I will cut it short this time to go back to the cheesecake. Love it. A perfect score for their original cheesecake"
Nate S.,"New York, NY",367,300,211,4.0,12/24/2016,"A solid chain restaurant that I consistently enjoy. Came here for the 2,456th time, and mid-meal I realized I haven't blessed this spot with a yelp review so here it is:  Atmosphere: All Cheesecake Factories have the same: titanic-esque appearance, so I won't bother with this part. Service: 95% of the time, I've received great service here, including last night Food: Calamari app never disappoints (the dipping sauces are partly to blame)            Usually meals are spot on. I did order the Kobe burger and instead of MEDIUM it was medium-well bordering well-done. Huge disappointment. But the quality, flavor, and portions are always spot on. Alcohol: past times I've drank here, drinks were strong, mixed well. This time I stuck with Shirley Temple on the rocks (I like to live life on the edge plus I was driving). All in all, my favorite chain restaurant."
kallie s.,"Patchogue, NY",592,43,33,3.0,7/27/2017,It is what it is the food is OK but it's like any other chain restaurant. The cheesecake is good though. Menu is giant and the place tends to get  super crowded and the service definitely lacks due to that factor. I hate sitting in a restaurant with an empty glass while I'm eating. The ambience is very nice and the bar is well stocked. It's better to go in there for a game or lunch... I just feel like this place doesn't pack the punch it should when it comes to dinner. I have gotten cakes out of there a few times to go and some of their flavor combinations are very delicious.
Ash M.,"Huntington, NY",0,4,4,1.0,11/24/2017,"Came into Cheesecake Factory with my family for a quick bite to eat tonight. First of all, we were just about to take our table before the manager, Rob, let his friends sit in front of us. Alright, a table by the bar was empty so we sat there instead. It took us twenty minutes to get a server to even acknowledge us, and then the server didn't even take our order, some other random man did. We wait just about an hour before my dad asked the waiter to check on our food, which he automatically brings out. This tells us it's been sitting out, so thanks for forgetting about us. Then the food comes and my brother asked for a burger with NO cheese, what comes out? A cheeseburger. Manager offers a single slice of cheesecake for a family of four. Great, but we declined. Manager offered to cover the bill. He then came back and told us he couldn't. That is so fantastic! Other manager, Oscar, came over and said there's nothing he can do and that we're lucky he took the burger off. Yeah so lucky cause my brother is lactose intolerant and wouldn't eat it anyways. Oscar gave us an issue saying we had to pay when my dad initially told Rob that he didn't want the bill covered and wanted to pay. Literally made no sense. Food was mediocre and beyond unsatisfactory. Went home and had thanksgiving leftovers for the fifth time. You will not be seeing us again, Cheesecake Factory. We will NEVER forget the horrible service at this restaurant. If you're looking for Cheesecake, make it yourself or head over to Westbury or Roosevelt field mall for the other establishments. Don't be subjected to horrible service for mediocre food. Don't let anyone fight with you at Cheesecake"
Jen S.,"Merrick, NY",152,206,264,4.0,5/20/2016,"Hm. What is this place? Not a factory, there were Egyptian faces on columns, wall paintings of birds and lighting on booth posts that looked like a dinosaur eye!  The service was prompt and friendly. The menus have the calories next to each dish which was discouraging lol. The drinks were standard restaurant style as my mule was made from a premix. The dinner was good and I would come back. We ordered two cheese cake slices to go which were consumed for breakfast the next day.  Now, the cheesecake containers were really well thought out! Engineered for cheese cake and whip cream, clear plastic tops and very secure. I marveled at them for quite sometime before the boy threw them out so I would pay attention to the movie we ordered.  Overall a good dinner in restaurant sharing the mall parking lot. Do it."
Glen F.,"Deer Park, NY",929,221,2223,4.0,4/28/2016,"Good food. Good service. HUGE menu with many, many choices. The chicken with dumplings is good (not great). The burgers are very good (flavorful and juicy). The omelette are excellent - I recommend Swiss cheese, spinach, mushrooms, & tomato. Of course the real reason we come is ... The Cheesecake!! ;-) The most popular flavor for the last 35 years (according to the menu) is the fresh strawberry.  Our personal favorite is the Banana Cream Pie Cheesecake. It's ahh-mazing!!!"
Jenna L.,"Massapequa, NY",222,121,12,4.0,5/17/2017,Mango chicken salad was delicious!! Got that for lunch! Feeds 2 people! Love their quality of food one of my favorite chains!
Impartial R.,"Melville, NY",0,3,,4.0,10/22/2017,"We went here for a family meal and the experience was great. The service was very friendly and professional. There was a long wait however it was ok. I wish they accept phone reservations. I was told they don't. Food quality, taste and cleanliness was good. However we felt the portion sizes were bit lesser and could have been more to justify the price tags. Also they could add some more veggie menu items."
David F.,"Farmingdale, NY",1,6,10,5.0,10/30/2016,"Bruleed French Toast @ 2560 calories. What can be bad.  Very quiet here 1st thing Sunday AM. As always good food, good service."
Robert S.,"Livingston, NJ",15,357,,4.0,2/4/2017,"Went for brunch.  It was surprisingly good.  Regular service, which is always good.  Food was good.  Price point was very good.  The brunch sampler looked to be the best deal for the price.  Next time near a Cheesecake Factory, if brunch time, I now know I can get a good brunch at a good price."
Tianna S.,"Lake Grove, NY",160,89,2104,3.0,4/10/2017,"Overall I enjoy going to cheesecake and enjoy the environment, the food and the waiters usually but this location made me feel a little different then normal. I normally go to the location in the Smithaven mall since It's close but I was in the area and In the mood for cheesecake so i stopped here. I feel like this location is smaller then usual but I still love the decor. The only reason this place doesn't get the normal 4 stars is becuase the waiter didn't seem to happy to be working with us and barley came around to ask us how our food was and everything. I ordered an entree I usually get and it didn't taste like normal so i brought it up to the waiter and long story short the waiter didn't handle it the best way possible and neither did the manager but in the long run the manager came back and addressed it properly so i will return and hope for a better time."
Christina N.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,19,,1.0,7/19/2017,If I had one last day on earth I would spend it here because they made my dinner feel like a goddamn eternity. Didn't get my food for like 2 hours. This place is THE WORST. And my food was undercooked but I was so desperate to eat that I just ate the pile of garbage in front of me. AVOID THIS GARBAGE PLACE AT ALL COSTS PLEEEEEASE
Fabs P.,"Huntington Station, NY",261,79,297,4.0,7/10/2016,I've been here a million times. This particular visit was great as usual. I will say this was my first time using the curb side to go towards the back of the restaurant. This gives you the ability to park and wait while your good comes out or quickly park and run in to grab your food yourself (limit of 10 mins). Either way it is a great perk!  So I had a bit of a sweet tooth and was in the mood for some cheesecake. But not just any cheesecake .... I was the salted caramel cheesecake. By far my favorite! Delicious! Creamy caramel cheesecake on blonde brownie with a crunch all topped off with a thick layer of the salted caramel. Yum! Oh and and don't forget the whipped cream on the side.
Lauren N.,"Old Bethpage, NY",122,88,120,1.0,9/24/2017,"I would give zero stars, but they get the one star only because the cheesecake was good. They failed to do anything else right. We went for my friends birthday. The wait at 5:30 was already an hour. I never understand why this place has such a wait!, but moving on, so we sat outside on the patio. It was actually really nice out and this was fine. The waiter came over and took our drink order. 5 drinks in total. 2 Arnold Palmers, a water, an iced tea, and a soda. So, the Arnie palmers come out and we're just kinda waiting around for the rest of our drinks. Our apps come out and still wondering, ""hmmm where are our drinks?"" I pull the waiter and ask if our drinks (not delayed 15 mins) are on the way. He literally looks at me like I have 5 heads and asks ""a dr. Pepper?"" I said yea and a water and an iced tea...So he goes off to get those. They finally get delivered when we're done with our apps. Moving on, we order our meals. I order a salad with balsamic dressing on the side. Long story short, my salad comes swimming in ranch dressing. I pull him aside and say, ""hey, there's a problem, my salad is covered in BBQ ranch dressing. I asked for balsamic on the side."" He says, ""oh no that's white ranch."" OKAY SO MY HEAD ALMOST EXPLODED! I think I laughed so I wouldn't go insane. ""Ok, but that's not what I ordered."" He stood there sooo freaking dumbfounded and finally took the salad away. He then conferred with the manager. So, I watched as everyone ate. It soon was 6, 630, almost 645. GUESS WHAT?! No salad. So we asked for a manager. We found the waiter who said the salad was on the way and we ordered another round of drinks. Drinks come out and the Arnie Palmers look suspiciously like they are just lemonade. But no! Genius waiter says the iced tea is just ""mixed in this time."" He then places a half full glass of tea in front of me with no ice in it. Literally, I almost jumped out of my chair. My friends husband started yelling ""dude what the hell is that?"" He stupidly comes back like ""what? What's wrong?"" I said, ""this is half a glass of tea and no ice."" He said ""oh there was no ice over here."" I wanted to throw it at him, but I somehow maintained my decorum. It took so much. I just said ""you have to be kidding me."" He said ""should I get you ice?"" I could have smashed my head into the wall. Was he high? Surely no one was this dumb. So off he went to get me ice. Finally, nearly 40 minutes later, we see him bringing my salad TO THE WRONG TABLE. The woman says it's not hers and he's like ""oh crap"". I say ""over here!"" At this point everyone else is done so he just says ""should I get you a box?"" My face must've looked like I wanted to freak out. He bring a box that way too small and someone at the table asks for a bigger one because at this point I think I'm incapable of speech. The manager finally swings by and we grab her. She gives a crappy apology and takes the salad and something else off the bill. This will go down in my top 3 most insane and horrible restaurant experiences. Screw You Cheesecake Factory."
Charlotte B.,"Glen Cove, NY",29,2,,3.0,7/28/2017,"So, I'm giving this a 3-star rating, because it's called The Cheesecake Factory, and I found that the cheesecake part of the cookie dough cheesecake wasn't very impressive. However, the S'mores cheesecake was scrumdidliumptious: so rich and creamy and downright delicious. Also, the chicken, mango, avocado salad was AMAZING, just a little skimpy on the chicken and mango, but still tasted great. Overall, a good experience. Would highly recommend the brown bread."
Sean L.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,3,1,4.0,8/26/2017,"Went to the restaurant yesterday around 4pm. My friend and I decided to sit at the bar. The food was good, we had the catfish meal and the jambalaya dish. The service was great. The bartender was very attentive. She made sure we were enjoying our meals as well as made sure our drinks were filled. Great job!"
Larry F.,"Bethpage, NY",0,18,2,5.0,8/5/2017,In my opinion CF is extremely underrated. We ate here today for the 4th or 5th time today. We always try something different. Portions are very generous. Everything always seems super fresh and honestly we've never left disappointed. Service and pricing is good too! I def recommend...
Udin S.,"Farmingdale, NY",154,84,673,5.0,4/18/2016,"Normally I don't go to large scale chain restaurants but I always seem to enjoy myself, the drinks and food here. Top notch location compared to the other cheesecake factories in the area. Also Alyson P. was probably the best waitress I've had here. The place was extremely busy at lunch and she had a bunch of tables to wait on. That didn't stop her from continuously filling our cups, asking if we are okay, and quickly getting anything we needed. Alyson thank you!"

And yes, I was disappointed at myself. But surprisingly, their food was pretty good. I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta from their lunch special, and I really enjoyed it. The sauce went perfectly with the chicken and the bowtie pasta. The good thing about my meal here was that I really liked the pasta. The bad thing is that next time, not only will I order their cheesecake, but now I'll also have to order a pasta on top of that!"
