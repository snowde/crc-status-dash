Diane S.,"St James, NY",0,1,,1.0,7/3/2011,"Lousey food....sugar overload from the cheesecake. The manager, Tom is not good. Never came back to my table to address a problem. Found something in my food. Didn't feel good all day from their low quality food. Overpriced and underserved. Never going back again."
Scott K.,"Melville, NY",2,89,1,2.0,7/28/2009,"A good place for drinks and dessert, the food is not exactly what I would call heart and/or stomach friendly. I usually regret eating meals here."
