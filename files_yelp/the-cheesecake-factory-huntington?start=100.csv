Karen R.,"Northport, NY",244,296,902,4.0,8/6/2013,"I am really not a fan of chain restaurants,I dont like them at all. But I was going out with a bunch of friends and this is a good place for a group. There is something for everybody.To start the menu is HUGE  with tons of options, fun drinks, the firefly cocktail was really good, great prices & the portions are gigantic. The food is good too. I had the Orange Chicken this time,actually anything I have had here I liked. Its got a fun atmosphere and the service was really good. And if you like rich decadent desserts this is the place for you."
Katie M.,"Garden City, NY",0,21,,5.0,9/23/2016,There are some of the nicest and most accommodating people working here. The manager Dana and servers Ava and Allison were amazing! I highly recommend this restaurant even on a busy Friday night!
Heather B.,"Farmingdale, NY",5,24,15,4.0,2/13/2015,"It's been over a year since I've been to the cheesecake factory. I had a gift card which on a cold day with not much to do why not use it! If the cheesecake factory was closer to me I would definitely go there more often! The menu is quite intimidating because there is so many choices to choose from. Bang, Bang chicken and shrimp was my selection and I chose wisely! It was chicken and shrimp in a coconut, peanut chili curry sauce served over rice and it was so delicious!! Even the bread they had on the table was very good. Of course you can't go to the cheesecake factory and not get cheese cake! So I got 1 piece of the traditional cherry cheesecake and another was the Reese's peanut butter cup cheesecake so delicious!! I was overall very happy with my experience and I think you would be too!"
S B.,"Commack, NY",0,6,,1.0,10/31/2015,"Closed at 11 even though the say 12 and the manager or whoever this guy in a suit was an asshole, disrespectful and unapologetic"
Mitch B.,"Nassau County, NY",8,77,12,2.0,10/12/2015,"Been to this and other Cheesecake Factory locations a number of times and always leave with the same thought:  ""Why did we come here again?""   Always crowded, always loud, the menu is overwhelming, and the food's generally just ok.  In fairness, we do steer clear of high calorie dishes heavily laden with sauces or cheese, which kind of defeats the purpose of going to CF in the first place, I guess.  But, still.  There are a great number of lighter dishes on the menu that look so appealing on paper, and then just fizzle.  Stay away from the veggie burger, a tasteless mound of grains barely holding itself together, unable to retain heat or obtain a crispy exterior, and just plain awful.  The other light dishes are no better or worse than anywhere else, so who needs to wait an hour plus for a table.  Having said that, the avocado egg roll appetizer is absolutely magnificent and a must try."
Patrizia V.,"Queens, Queens, NY",3,80,33,3.0,1/3/2015,"Great service, our waitress was Jacky.. She was awesome! So, happy, friendly.... Told us her favo dish...  Was salmon genovse , how ever u spell it...mom loved it! I got the Mac cheese burger... Was yummy! Fried mac n cheese on top of the burger...  Dessert was tuxedo cheese cake... Let's just say ... Drool worthy! Will deft come again"
Rich L.,"Long Island, NY",31,125,389,4.0,9/2/2015,"I have to say, I really enjoy eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  Their food always tastes delicious and an order of magnitude better than other chain restaurants.  I went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and waited for 2 minutes so no complaints there.  I've also been there on Friday and Saturday nights so don't be surprised if you have to wait an hour or more.  And you can't really go to the mall next door while you're waiting because their buzzers don't work that far.  Anyway, back to the food - did I mention it was delicious?  Even their bread is delectable.  When you take a small helping of butter and gently apply it to that warm pumpernickel bread, it simply makes my mouth water.   Their Vietnamese summer rolls were so good that it actually inspired me to try to look up the recipe online and try to make it by myself at home (without much success by the way).  And the Chicken Romano is one of my favorites.  It's so savory and just yummy overall.  Not overpowered by cheese and sauce like you would see with Chicken Parm at other restaurants.  Dessert?  Well, I'm not sure if it's more of a sin to not have cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory or to pay $8 a slice for one :).  On this occasion we skipped dessert."
Melissa P.,"Melville, NY",80,142,400,4.0,8/24/2014,"Huge restaurant interior with an equally large menu. Have dined here many times over the years. Never had a problem with the food and of course the list of decadent cheesecake selections verges on sinful. Had the tuxedo last night, wonderful contrast from one layer to the next yet all managed to  feed a chocolate lust. Large lists of cocktails, wine, beer. Had the strawberry Martini - very strong, perhaps too strong as the flavor of the strawberries struggled with the alcohol and the added sugar to mask the taste. Tried the firecracker salmon, pieces of salmon twisted in a fried egg roll wrapper, perfect decision if you're looking for a shareable salmon dish or smaller portions. The group was a fan of the chicken samosas and 4 cheese penne. Said the fried zucchini, portabello and avocado was lacking. Service was good overall."
John C.,"Dix Hills, NY",0,1,3,1.0,3/13/2015,"12 minutes waiting on the phone to order curb side. Arrived 30 minutes to pick up. 15 more minutes waiting at the counter. Paid 50$ for 2 dishes and 1 appetizer. Usually we get 6 summer rolls (we had just last week similar order, much better then) but only got 5 today. Lemon garlic pasta was like a kiddie meal. I don't eat much but this was ridiculously wrong. Took 3 bites before I finished the pasta. Way over priced and under delivered here. Really disappointed. There was another person there in a similar situation. Very painful. Wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt cause of the fire this past week but seriously if you can't deliver service then you should remain closed until staffed properly."
Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1285,982,738,4.0,1/7/2013,"It's been several years since I've been to this location.  Came in with my family this past Sunday night and had a great experience.  Couldn't believe that there was a half hour wait at eight o'clock on a Sunday night but that was a good sign that they are constantly busy I guess! Again, haven't been to this location in years but my recollection was that the hostesses were always extremely unwelcoming and rude.  That aspect hasn't changed a bit.  Their stand offish demeanor is not the way I wanted to begin my night hence the four start rating instead of the five. Happy to say though, they played a very small role in our overall experience. The restaurant is huge, almost as big as their menu.  There are options for every kind of diner, meat-eaters, mexican lovers, dieters, vegetarians, children, and so on.  We were sat in a booth in the front section of the restaurant.  The area was set apart from the rest of the restaurant and it was pretty private which was nice.  Our table wasn't set though, some of us had forks some of us didn't, there were no napkins and the booths clearly weren't wiped from the party before us.  I'll blame the hostesses.  The bread brought to our table consisted of white and some sort of whole wheat.  Nix the white bread, it sucks.  The brown bread which apparently is some sort of whole wheat rye with molasses is delicious.  Our table stuck to waters but their drink selection was quite impressive.  We ordered the tex mex egg rolls off the regular menu and the asian chicken lettuce wraps off the SkinnyLicious menu.  I didn't taste the egg rolls but my family loved them.  The Asian chicken lettuce wraps were STUPID good.  I couldn't believe the nutrition content, again ordered off the SkinnyLicious Menu and they had less than 500 calories. They were fresh, inventive and just really good.  I would have ordered them again as my entree if I hadn't already placed an order for something else. My mouth is actually watering just thinking about how good they were.   Waiter was young and inexperienced because he failed to do simple things like clear empty water glasses and garbage off the table.  I'm extremely critical of things like that and my family isn't so it didn't bother them.  He was very nice however so again, not a big deal.   Entrees for the table included two four cheese pasta dishes with chicken, the burrito grande and spicy chicken salad off the SkinnyLicious menu.  All of the dishes were phenomenal.  Seriously, for a chain, VERY impressed.  Sundays are questionable for receiving fresh food but there was no doubt what we were eating was fresh and well prepared.  The portions were generous as well.  My only complaint is that the side of black beans served with the burrito were cold.  Really cold.    I love the fact that the menu includes the calorie information next to each item, however that was the main reason why we passed on dessert. Over 1000 calories for one slice of cheesecake!  Holy moly, we opted for frozen yogurt instead!  We played guess the check and were happily surprised by the outcome since we were all OVER the actual cost.  Reasonably priced for what we were given.  Definitely recommend this place.  Will be back."
Roberta S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,98,4,2.0,1/15/2016,I was visiting family in New York and went to dinner with some friends. We got seated immediately and had a server come over quickly to take our drink orders. I love their very varied menu and always find it difficult to choose something but we were all able to pick something and place our order quickly.  Then we waited for a long time for our food to arrive and when it did there was a problem with each of our meals.  While they took care of it I found that this Cheesecake Factory is not as good as the others I visit frequently at home in Las Vegas.
Lon G.,"Huntington, NY",192,342,46,5.0,6/9/2015,"My meal today was poifect!! Really! I started with the beets with goat cheese salad. I was struck by the endless different delicious tastes in it! Then came the hamburger- YES MY FRIEND! It was perfect charred and cooked exactly to my liking. I got mashed potatoes instead of the fries, and they were fresh and still had the tater skins in them. They did a great job today!!"
Megan H.,"Long Island, NY",65,90,91,4.0,7/15/2013,"I can't believe the enormous portions in this place! I came here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. The first time, I tried to be modest and ordered a chicken Caesar salad, which could have fed a hungry family of four, and it was delicious!  For dinner, I ordered the macaroni and cheeseburger, half of which filled me up and I had the rest for lunch a day or two later. If you are trying to maintain a girlish figure, this is not the dish for you. However, if you are into fried, cheesy, kind-of greasy goodness, dig in!  I couldn't decide what I wanted to order for quite a while, but our waitress was patient and friendly, AND she kept the appetizer breads coming to our table while we waited.  After dinner, my table shared the Hershey chocolate cheesecake which was good, but the real winner was the (huge) slice of carrot cheesecake that I took home to share with my mother. It was outstanding! I can't wait to get that again for myself (far too delicious to feel an ounce of guilt!). I was in an absolute food-coma when I got home from dinner. So very filling!  I also loved the cool upscale atmosphere in this place, but in denim shorts and a linen button-up, I didn't feel underdressed for the place. The prices were very reasonable as well. There is something on the menu for every budget. Two thumbs up!"
Scott S.,"Plainview, NY",0,39,6,4.0,11/26/2014,It's a cheesecake factory and it's pretty much as good as they all are. The staff are usually better then most other places and are good at getting customizations right. They can't ever seem to cook a burger right the first time but once they do get it right it tastes great but watch out because its gigantic and theres no smaller option. I am always changing stuff when I come here with no complaints from the staff which is great because it really lets me get the exact meal that I want without much compromise.
Daphne P.,"Flushing, NY",5,38,7,5.0,10/15/2015,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my husband, sister, and kids. Great location btw, after you stuff your pie hole you can burn some calories walking around in the mall lol. We only waited about 5 minutes to be served. The food was delicious, even the Mac and Cheese! Drinks were also good and the desserts were amazing, lots to choose from. My sister had a vanilla bean cheesecake, heaven!! I thought the price was also reasonable, will definitely be returning in the future!"
Nikki T.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",217,213,102,5.0,10/12/2014,"I came yesterday for an early lunch with my mother and we were glad to see it wasn't super busy yet.  We split the sweet corn tamales to start, delish as usual. Then we split the skinny turkey burger. It was one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had, not dry at all.  Of course we finished with espresso and cappuccinos... And out waiter was more than accommodating to make them to go.  Great food, great service. Great end to a day of shopping."
Jon P.,"New York, NY",113,54,60,3.0,4/19/2015,For Desserts stick to Cheesecakes only!! The cakes displayed looked better then they tasted. I sent back Carrot Cake it was stale. We got there after Dinnet Rush. The place is hit or miss on Food? Great place for all menu huge . Service ok . We all ordered coffe and was old. They did make fresh pot after asking . Not running back
Jasmine M.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,2,1.0,1/1/2017,"Visiting NY from D.C. and have never had an experience at Cheesecake Factory like the one I have had today. Came here for Sunday's Brunch and received the worst service ever. First, it took a while for any waiter to acknowledge us after we were seated. After finally being acknowledged, we have the waitress out order who acted as if she had hearing issues -I just knew our order would come out incorrectly and it did after waiting for almost 40 minutes without any acknowledgement from our waitress. She must have walked by 6/7 times before I had to get her attention to let her know the plates on the table were dirty. My husband received all of his food and I simply receive 1/3 of my meal for it to get cold as I waited for the rest of my meal. We both got meals that required syrup and didn't get syrup until 5 minutes later. Usually not a harsh critique but was very unpleased with our service. The manager came over to apologize, deflect and place blame on the team instead of taking full responsibility. He didn't agree to comp anything (not that we needed anything free) but damn at least the $3.50 cold coffee. Conversely, ate dinner at Del Frisco's the previous night and the service was impeccable. Would not recommend this Cheesecake to visitors in the area."
Randi G.,"Walnut Creek, CA",42,46,29,4.0,10/1/2015,"I love this Cheesecake Factory. We usually go with my niece and nephew.  The kids menu is good.  The food is consistent wch is great.  My only complaint is the wait.  At times the wait can be 20-30 minutes which can be annoying with children.  Other than that, I'd say everything on the menu - especially the Cheesecake is awesome. I love this place.  I especially like the lower calorie menu/small bites menu."
Jeremy W.,"Babylon, NY",31,39,38,4.0,7/26/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory! This location is very nice and the service was great! We received our drinks and food very fast. I got the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and my wife got the Jamaican blacked shrimp.. Both were delicious!  My only negatives were the wait which is expected 30mins after 7 and the don't have IPAs!!!
