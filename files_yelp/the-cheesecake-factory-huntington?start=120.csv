Ozi D.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",1,18,24,3.0,8/29/2014,Expensive and too much calories and not worth the trip. The place setting is very nice and the environment is great just too much calories for the food offered.
Sanam A.,"Huntington Station, NY",94,26,16,1.0,9/10/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory so much! This is my go to restaurant! Unfortunately this location sucks in service and is nothing compared to the other locations I have been too!  I was actually there yesterday and the way the waiter served us is was unacceptable! What was worse is that when I told the manager for a new waiter, he completely ignored us! The whole experience got so unbearable that my family got up and wanted to leave! The manager wouldn't let us go and when he did decide, he even thought about bout charging us for the appetizer we never got! Which is whatever who cares because we were dying to get out! He later then changed his mind and never apologized for the whole situation, like at least acknowledge your shitty service! So done with this location they can learn a thing or two from bayshore or garden city's location!"
Stephanie W.,"Elmhurst, NY",18,84,56,5.0,5/24/2014,"The portions are on the big side...so what do you do? Sharing is caring.  Best way to eat is Family style anyhow.   We order - Sliders, Avocado Spring Rolls, & Cob Salad as appetizers.  The Cobb Salad was excellent.  Perfect balance with all the ingredients.  Sliders were tasty but could have used a little more beef.  Im allergic to pinenuts so I couldn't try the Avocade Spring Rolls that has Pesto.  But I heard it was delicious. Our Server was super attentive and very friendly."
Clarissa M.,"Amityville, NY",20,24,10,4.0,5/30/2015,The staff is very friendly and I just love the cheesecake. The food is also very good. It's not expensive and you get what you pay for. It has a bar section where you can have drinks
Jennifer W.,"East Northport, NY",4,55,,5.0,4/4/2015,"Unhinge your jaw before entering this establishment. In a nutshell, I probably consumed 25,000 calories during the course of an hour. Although I fooled myself into thinking that a turkey burger would be a healthy selection, the sweet potato fries that accompanied it sent me into a carboholic meltdown - something fierce. And then there was the Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake. Oh lord."
David M.,"Merrick, NY",94,466,346,4.0,12/16/2013,"Although I'd never come here for dinner fighting two hour wait times & the hordes of hungry people for seating, for lunch you avoid all that hub bub. We got Immediate seating, good service and reliable, familiar entrees. This made for a relatively pleasant experience. Best dish was the lunch sized Pasta Davinci with Madeira sauce , chicken and mushrooms.  We like sitting in the ""rotunda"" room with the bright windows and will often request seating there if it's not too crowded."
John D.,"Great Neck, NY",7,14,8,4.0,2/8/2014,"Food was good, dessert was great! The Greek salad was too small for the price. It's more like a personal size not to share. The avocado rolls are in unbelievable, especially the sauce it comes with. The pasta I ordered was a very big portion, very tasty. The dessert was over the top sweet but definitely amazing! I ordered the s'mores cake :)"
Tony M.,"Port Washington, NY",0,37,2,4.0,7/29/2014,"Had dinner there this past weekend and really enjoyed it.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich and really liked it a lot. The prices are fair, good sized portions and the service was great."
Kiran C.,"Melville, NY",2,6,,1.0,5/13/2015,"I had the worst experience when I went last night, the wait was an hour plus for a Tuesday night and they weren't organized at all. Not one person even reassured us that we will be seated soon. When we got to the table after an hour and a half later, we got hasty service and I don't blame the waiter, I just thought the restaurant was not organized at all! I am infuriated that a big restaurant was not even able to seat us quick."
Sydney G.,"New York, NY",78,43,22,4.0,11/23/2014,"I really enjoy shopping at the walt whitman mall so it's normal to take a break from shopping and grab a bite to eat.   Before this mall transformed into this awesome mall with tons of new restaurants.. Cheesecake was the best one in the vicinity. Since the new restaurants opened I definitely have new favorites.  However, cheesecake factory is still really good and clean and I will occasionally still stop here. I really like the teriyaki chicken meal they have here its a pretty big meal too. Obviously their cheesecake is amazing.. i could literally eat an entire s'mores cheesecake if i wanted it is soo good. The food is delicious and the service is good (as long as they aren't crazy busy.) The staff is friendly and helpful with making suggestions.  The wait time is what really turns me off from this place. During a rush you could be waiting upwards of 2 hours.. thats crazy! With so many new options in the area hopefully they come up with a way to speed the line along.  Beautiful place, nice staff, great food, long waits."
Reet u.,"New York, NY",0,6,2,1.0,2/20/2016,"They have a great menu and pretty good food. Service is really good if you are WHITE. This place is very racist, and the day shift manager fully supports this. Since, the tables are very close you could easily see and hear how differently they treat people. They make sweet excuses after excuses for there bad service but everything is perfect if you are white."
Alex C.,"San Francisco, CA",51,43,8,3.0,11/7/2014,"Do you love cheese and perhaps cake? Are you thinking, hey, I'm a classy lady or lass and I need to dine at a location that can match my worldliness and delusional sense of grandeur? Well look no further. Dine at the Cheesecake Factory Walt Whitman location and you'll find the answer to that age old question: can one enjoy fine dining while wearing sweatpants?"
Erica D.,"Copiague, NY",7,92,12,4.0,1/20/2015,"Ate here last night with two friends who are dieting... Atmosphere:  Pretty, clean...its a large restaurant and tends to be noisy but not so noisy we couldn't talk. Food:  Keeping with the dieting atmosphere at the table, I ordered:  Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos-Asian.  I wasn't really looking forward to it but from the first bite...with the delicious sauces, I didn't even miss the carbs.  It was AMAZING!  I would order it again in a heartbeat! Service:  Our waiter was Mark.  He was adorable and an EXCELLENT waiter and lucky for us, he had a great sense of humor.  My friend flirted with him shamelessly and he remained completely professional but totally playing into the flirting at the same time.   Really great. Cost:  My meal with tip and tax was $10.50!  A bargain."
Lauren M.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,63,,3.0,9/30/2015,Came here for my sisters birthday and she enjoyed every minute of it. The cheesecake was delicious but definitely something you'd ever eat again (calories!) the young girls enjoyed it but the food to me was very mediocre and expensive for what it was. Nice staff. I liked the complimentary bread.
Mike C.,"Brockton, MA",11,74,,2.0,9/28/2014,"Aside from the crazy wait times which is no fault if theirs, food quality has fallen off. My gf was served pasta that was barely cooked. I thought she might have been being picky or it was al dente, but no, I was rock hard and I almost chipped a tooth sampling it. Service was ultra slow and we were pissed at the delay to get it replaced. Our last time here."
Jess M.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",15,7,1,5.0,8/30/2014,"I love eating at the cheesecake factory. I called because I was bringing in one of the students I work with and explained to them my situation.  I spoke to the manager Ian and he was so helpful, I had an amazing waitress Ava she was very reliable on everything.  The best experience ever. I can't wait for the pumpkin cheesecake!"
Brenda W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,6,2,4.0,4/1/2015,"The 4 stars is for the cheesecake. As all cheesecake factories, this place is a mad house on Friday or Saturday nights. Staff is not the friendliest but I guess tey dont need to be when they have the monopoly on  the cheesecake. Portions on dinner are HUGE which is a great plus. Take home your leftovers and you got a second dinner!"
Elizabeth D.,"Plainview, NY",67,169,87,5.0,8/21/2013,Fantastic Food. Roomy indoors. Great outdoor seating. The burritos here are tremendous! Great desserts. Fun atomosphere.
Kerri B.,"Town of Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY",0,3,,4.0,2/8/2016,"There's always a long wait, but it's worth it! I've never had a bad meal here. Chicken Madeira is my favorite. Had the stuffed mushrooms and they were very good. Steak Diane was the only think I've had that was so so."
John H.,"East Northport, NY",0,20,16,1.0,9/7/2015,"We found wheat pasta mixed into our ""gluten free"" pasta dinner. Now my son is sick. Thanks Cheesecake Factory!"
