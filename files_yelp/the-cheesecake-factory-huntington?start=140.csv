Alan W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2973,885,1113,5.0,1/14/2013,"Was coming out Walt Whitman Mall and all of a sudden had a urge for cheesecake. oh what the heck, just so happens i was passing a Cheesecake Factory. I have eaten in a lot of the Cheesecake Factories and overall not very impressed with the food. But the Cheesecake is simply to die for. I could not decide between the Chocolate Mouse & the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. What a hard decision, Finally after a short debate i settled on the Chocolate Mouse Cheesecake with whip cream and strawberries. I took it to go and headed home to eat dinner and then the cheesecake. It took all my will power to not pull over and start munching on it. Needless to say it was deeeeee licious every bite. Generally the place is packed, But they move along quickly as there are tons of tables. Can not recommend the food so much but the cheesecake you don't know what you are missing till you try it. I give the cheesecake alone 5 stars *****."
Gil A.,"Huntington Station, NY",1,4,2,1.0,5/18/2014,Waiting over 1 and 1/2 hours for a party of 9. It started originally at 30 minute wait then escalated from there.
Maria A.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,7,2,5.0,1/27/2016,Food is delicious and the dessert is to die for. The wait can be pretty long some nights and the girls that work the phones/take names are quite rude - they should learn how to speak properly to people. But still 5 stars!
Jenny S.,"Melville, NY",0,19,,4.0,1/24/2016,"I have recently been in touch with their corporate office and there are 3 vegan breads.  The Sourdough, Wheat, and Rustic Batard.  The veggie burger is vegan, get it without cheese or mayo/sauce on it.  They have a new vegan cobb salad which I have not tried yet.  Still not sure about the l-cysteine in the other breads but at least I have a choice now."
Shari P.,"Hempstead, NY",2,23,2,5.0,10/26/2014,The food is so good! We ordered crab cakes ( amazing) & fried macaroni & cheese balls. The staff was very very nice. This cheesecake  factory isnt a big as the one in westbury. I like the atmosphere better here because its not as loud & feels more romantic.
Claire K.,"San Diego, CA",183,155,120,1.0,7/23/2015,"service was great but back of the house really needs to get back into cooking fundamental. first pasta came out salty. asked for Tabasco to balance it out and the inside cap was missing so a good 4 oz covered my entire pasta. 2nd set came out and it was 2 cups of pasta to 5 cups of diced tomato? the entire thing was covered in tomato. to make it worse, half of it was still hard and stuck together . stir your pasta guys!"
Jessica J.,"Plainview, NY",0,1,,1.0,8/16/2015,"This was the worst experience I have ever had in my entire life at a restaurant! I usually never write these, but with how much my mom and I were disrespected, I felt I had to say something. We waited at least 35-40 mins for our food maybe more for 2 simple chicken dishes. One was the pasta with scampi sauce and chicken. The other, grilled chicken with farrow and vegetables. After this very long wait, they gave her farrow hard as rock! We were both very annoyed after this and kindly asked the waitress for the manager. The manager himself took at least 15-20 mins just to get to us! My mom explained the situation and he promised to give her fresh farrow and not charge for the meal. He should have also given me my meal for free. She waited at least 25 mins for the new farrow! 25 mins after all that we endured! May I mention, in between all of this our waitress keep disappearing. I had to call her over when she went to other tables because she was not stopping at ours. My mother told me when she got back from the bathroom, all of the stalls locks were broken. This place is falling apart! I have never been more disrespected at any establishment in my life. My mom and I have been going to this Cheesecake for years and it used to be great. We have given them plenty of money from business and this is the thanks we get? Unacceptable. I wish I didn't have to give this place any stars. We will never be coming here again. Maybe the Cheesecake in Westbury will be better."
Shana K.,"New York, NY",5,25,1,1.0,3/1/2014,"TAKE-OUT I love the cheesecake factory and they consistently have good food and good portions.  The menu rarely changes and the specials have been the same for years, but that's not my problem right now.   I've ordered take out a number of times, over 10 times and I'm at the point where I'm so annoyed I must say something.  You must check your bags before you leave because so often I have to go back for them leaving out an entree.  This happened last night and we were so annoyed.  All they offered us was a free piece of cake, and I don't eat cheese cake, but thanks anyway.  Also, the take-out portions, unless you're getting a salad are extremely stingy.  Many times I've ordered grilled salmon, I don't eat potatoes or fries, so I get extra broccoli.  Last time I literally got 4 pieces of broccoli and that was it.  Last night I ordered chicken with asparagus and couscous, and I literally got a spoonful of couscous and 3 pieces of asparagus.  I know what you're thinking, this girl is fat and just wants huge portions, and I'm nothing of the sort, I want a good amount of food for what I paid for.  I know for a fact that If I am in the restaurant and ordered the same meals, which I have, I get a lot more broccoli, I get more than 3 pieces of asparagus.  It's as if they don't care because we are going home and won't come back, they can just throw in whatever.  I hate paying $26 for salmon and broccoli and I get a good size of the protein, and what is clearly not extra broccoli.  I think you need to check all your food before you get back in your car or else be prepared to back."
Kate R.,"Deer Park, NY",9,30,,5.0,11/4/2014,"I've been here several times and not once have I ever left disappointed. Sometimes there's a wait, obviously on the weekend. I've been there on weekdays and never had to wait more the 5/10 mins. It's a nice night out."
Lili Z.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",2,39,6,4.0,9/26/2012,"Love The Cheesecake Factory! If it weren't for the crowds I would eat there a lot more often. The food and service are always dependable. I like the new Skinnylicious menu with lower calorie counts and healthier choices. Some of the choices are the same as the regular menu and I can't taste much of a difference. I usually order my favorite...the white chicken chili. It is really flavorful with a little spicy kick. I also like the tuna tataki salad with it's slightly seared sesame crusted tuna slices and a salad with asian dressing. My son always gets the Chicken Romano. The chicken is pounded flat and crusted with cheese and served with pasta. The portion is so huge there is usually left overs and it's really big enough to share. Other dishes I've tried and liked are the Chicken Madeira and the Baja Chicken Tacos. Not to mention the amazing desserts. The cheesecakes are to die for but they are very rich and heavy, so I find that sharing is a good idea. I really like the atmosphere, the high ceilings and open floor plan give you the sense it is not as crowded as it really is. While is can be noisy, it's never too loud for conversation and you have plenty of room at the over-sized booths and large tables. My daughter had a birthday party here and they were very organized and accommodating to our needs.  I don't hesitate to recommend The Cheesecake Factory. Just try and come at off hours to beat the crowds."
Carolina D.,"Lindenhurst, NY",52,5,3,2.0,10/25/2015,I went this sunday wit my husband lets say it was kinda empty when we got there we got our drinks and appetizer quick but  the main dish I ordered chicken and biscuits (my favorite) nd my husband order the steak tacos we waited like 30 min for it !!!

Alyson R.,"Wantagh, NY",2,30,,4.0,10/11/2014,"I previously reviewed this restaurant and would like to update my thoughts several years later. I'm still a fan of TCF and would give it 3 1/2 stars out if 5. There is something for everyone at this place, the portions are huge, and of course the cheesecakes are delish. The prices are good considering how much you get. I wish there were more healthy options tho! The drink  selection is also pretty vast! There's something for everyone here, and I usually get overwhelmed when trying to decide what to order. But I'm always satisfied with my choice, so I recommend it. Just be prepared to eat a lot!"
Erica B.,"Levittown, NY",12,41,6,1.0,2/10/2014,"I stopped here on a Monday night to grab cheesecake to go. I waited at the counter for five minutes while the hostesses were busy talking to themselves. Finally one came over with a waiter and some other staff member. They completely ignored me and talked amongst themselves. I asked them loudly for some help out of frustration. The hostess looked at me like I had four heads but proceeded to help. I ordered a cheesecake slice with fruit and no whip cream to go. When I arrived home, my cheesecake was full of whip cream and no fruit. Even my boyfriend thought she opposed my order on purpose (and usually he is the one saying to me that I am crazy when I think that). She had a very ombré dye job (brown to blonde). So avoid her like the plague she is."
Vincent M.,"Framingham, MA",377,404,225,2.0,12/3/2010,"This location is beautiful. I really think it's the nicest looking Cheesecake I've ever been to.  That being said, it's still Cheesecake Factory. Over priced, huge portions of mediocre food and ridiculously marked up drinks! I'm sorry, $9.50 for a Jack Daniels? That's absurd!! I couldn't believe it. I was here the Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2010 and I was really impressed with our waitress. She was funny and attentive and took good care of us.  The service was great, it's just the prices and food that I'm not too crazy about."
Anisah B.,"Huntington, NY",7,92,20,3.0,3/28/2014,"A little pricey for lunch but my co-workers like to order from them. I've had a few different things, wasn't crazy about any of the items that I've had. Cannot comment on service or the facility itself as we have been doing curbside. They always seem to forget utensils though."
Eddie B.,"Greenlawn, NY",0,30,,1.0,10/26/2014,Take out..server jacqlyn l Whats so hard about taking a order and getting it right? forgot the fries with the chicken finger. FAIL AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Innocenzo C.,"Astoria, NY",223,15,17,4.0,8/19/2012,"Arrived early enough to beat the crowds , Promptly seated , Had a sufficient enough time to figure out our drinks and appetizers . I was undecided choosing  a dinner our server ( Maria ) recommended the tuna steak surrounded with vegetables and a wasabi pancake like topping . it was more than enough for me to eat, I actually could have passed on the appetizer because the dinner was large enough for 2 people . So 1 appetizer 2 dinners , 4 cocktails and 1 dessert to go 94.00 . Ample parking , get there early to be seated promptly , clean and relaxed environment . Great food , friendly staff . This is one of my favorited I will always frequent"
Christopher C.,"New York, NY",162,483,746,3.0,3/11/2010,"For what it is the Cheesecake Factory is actually pretty good, though it is massive and massively crowded with all sorts of people talking, running around and such. If you don't mind the crowds and high level of activity it's actually not bad.   As for the food, I've only really eaten here 3 times, and two of them I had salads, that equaled the size of a feedbag portion, although not bad my typical 400 calorie salad with light dressing turned into a 36,632 calorie salad and it was oddly glorious.  Overall not a bad place, just have to get past the crowds and that sometimes annoyingly long wait. Simply put, one of the best big box chain restaurants out there."
Mike P.,"Allentown, NJ",1,354,6,3.0,6/26/2014,"Just sooooo much food... consider sharing, anything and everything.  Good drinks, friendly service."
Larry B.,"Farmingdale, NY",113,325,9,1.0,12/29/2013,"i don't know what happened to this place, but dinner last night was god awful from start to finish - i get that it was a saturday night, but don't tell me 45 minutes when i'm still standing there and hour and a half later, and don't be rude & blame it on the pager not working - we know you screwed up and forgot to seat us...once seated, the experience somehow got even worse as were were more or less ignored the entire time, no offer of drink refills until halfway through entrees, then got stuck waiting 20 minutes after our plates were cleared before being asked if we wanted dessert because the waitress and her supervisor were busy arguing with the table next to us over a messed up bill - never fun to go out & drop money only to feel like redheaded stepchildren...return is doubtful"
