Michael F.,"Valley Stream, NY",10,376,203,4.0,7/16/2012,"I hate you The Cheesecake Factory. Your menu is so big. Your food is so damn tasty and fried. Your cheesecake is constantly clogging my left ventricle. Your calorie counts are so astronomical!! The Sweet Corn Fritters are addicting. The Navajo is my new favorite sandwich (hello fried bread). The Reese's Cheesecake haunts my dreams. Yes, I know it's just fancy Applebee's food, but it just tastes so good."
Kate O.,"Greenlawn, NY",0,5,,4.0,7/11/2015,"I love this place always have. But there was one time I had a very rude waitress. She was not attentive at all and didn't even care so serve us. She ran after Us outside with our bill very unhappy with the tip. Her words were ""here you obviously need this more then I do"". Very unprofessional but she is gone now. Anyway everyone of the waiters I have had before and since Her have been nice and knowledgable. The food is always good! My tip is to get the factory nachos!!! My favorite appetizer of all time. I will always go here"
Ana G.,"Woodbury, NY",0,15,,4.0,7/5/2015,We've ordered at this location for over 6 years. The avocado egg rolls and the Santa Fe salad are the favorite dishes to share! The salad is specially prepared without cheese and chicken on the side. The egg rolls are perfectly prepared with a delicious sauce to compliment the dish. Nice treat and end to a long weekend!
Kathleen B.,"Long Island, NY",135,451,17,3.0,8/14/2011,Not bad. I like their small plates the best. And of course their Mac and cheese balls.  Always very busy.
Eric F.,"Town of Huntington, Long Island, NY",0,44,7,1.0,4/1/2015,Good food very extensive menu. I know this is trivial but the bill suggests the tip based on total including tax. No way very sneaky. This is why one star. Beware
L G.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",5,74,3,1.0,10/23/2013,"Don't bother, I was here a few weeks ago, the food was ok, the service was ok, the peanut butter cheesecake was terrible! Tasteless and like it had been in the freezer for a long long time. I emailed them to complain before coming here to see if they would even say anything, and didn't get a response. Why on earth would I go to place called Cheesecake Factory if they only have bad cheesecakes? Go to juniors if you want good fresh cheesecake. The food you can get at any other chain restaurant.. Don't bother with this place!"
Lee M.,"New York, NY",49,270,5,3.0,2/10/2012,"For chain food, I think Cheesecake Factory is a notch above the places like Friday's, Chili's Ruby Tuesdays, etc.  I prefer this outpost to the one at the Source because of the layout.  Echoing other reviewers, this resto is very loud, but, very kid friendly - it was a great place for us to go with another couple and our toddler children. Beware of the very long waits.  Even at 5pm, there was a 20 minute wait on a recent Saturday evening. As for the food, I don't want to duplicate my review of the Source outpost, but there is a lower calorie menu.  Still, the kids mac and cheese was north of 1000 calories - I still can't in good conscience let my daughter eat that.  The portions are generous and the quality is not bad.  Not gourmet by any means, but good."
Megan O.,"Centerport, NY",264,89,13,2.0,10/3/2013,Hmm overpriced huge portion meals. They really try but when it gets busy they lack in service. The food is just whatever in my opinion.
Joe M.,"North Bellmore, NY",44,7,7,5.0,6/5/2013,Cheesecake Factory is great and they are all the same! Decent prices for great food.
Michael S.,"East Northport, NY",0,9,,1.0,6/5/2014,Gluten free customers beware.  Had dinner at Huntington cheese cake tonight ordered from gluten free menu. First waited a long time for our meal. But after we got home realized what we ordered and stressed big time from the gluten free menu was not gluten free. My wife is like in shock after over year of gluten free and recovering from a 7 year bout with IBS she is  sick as can be. This is it for us never again. Be aware if u r gluten free stay away from cheese cake. Idiot staff etc. And management. I will be writing to corp on this .
Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",829,2232,20,3.0,10/26/2008,"The latest edition of the Cheesie chain... This place has sprouted on the Route 110 corridor in Melville, and like its cousin over in Carle Place, is jammed to the rafters with the sheeple who love their big portions... The food is fine enough.  Why anyone would want to eat with a zillion other people is beyond me, but if that is your sort of thing, then this is the place for you. There are plenty of after dinner over indulgences available as well... Parking lots around the place."
Leonardo J.,"Manhattan, NY",94,5,20,2.0,10/20/2013,"Don't eat here, sad to say as much as I like cheesecake factory, this location sucks.  I took my mom here for her birthday and all we did was wait wait wait.  We got our seats fairly quickly but no no service.  People got in after us and got served and our stomachs just growled.  I'll go elsewhere I learned my lesson."
Jamie L.,"Melville, NY",7,7,,1.0,12/13/2014,"I went there today with my sister after a long morning of shopping. I was asked my name and was told it would be 10-15 minutes wait time. I looked around and noticed that the area by the bar was empty but I sat anyway figuring it wouldn't be too long. After awhile I noticed that people who gave their names after me were being called to sit. We waited a total of 25 minutes. A couple who had came were sat within 5 minutes. I went up to the frazzled hostess and asked her if she had forgotten to put my name down. She asked me who I was again and then asked for how many people were in the party. She then proceeded to tell me that someone should have called my name and then was told it'd be another 5 minute wait. I told her not to bother. My sister and I went to California Pizza Kitchen instead and were sat right away. Cheesecake Factory I will never go back to again, but California Pizza Kitchen I will definitely be back."
Sara P.,"Melville, NY",26,102,,2.0,1/19/2013,"Ive been to The Cheesecake Factory in Westbury and Smithtown and MANY others across the country...this one has the WORST service. I dont know what it is about this particular location but they just cannot get it together. Everytime, it is something...whether it is an inconsistency (that I would notice having visited so many times), food issue, or a service issue, there is always something... That being said, Cheesecake Factory has great food, large portions and some options that will exceed your daily recommended caloric intake...The new Skinnylicious menu offers some healthier, lower cal alternatives but nothing has really impressed me thus far... Small plates are a nice choice too! Lots of different things to choose from. Dynamite Shrimp and stuffed mushrooms YUM!! For entrees, I like Chicken Madeira, Herb Crusted Salmon, Pasta Davinci and the Barbecue Ranch Chicken Salad. If you do visit this particular location, expect something to go wrong. Whether it be the forgotten bread on your table, no refills, burnt food, flavorless sauces (I swear they have watered down everything from pasta sauces to salad dressings in my experience...maybe they just need to use a colander!)....there is no end to the list. if you are lucky, it will be a great meal!! If you have room for Cheesecake, definitely try Banana Cream or Tuxedo!! yum!!!  The other two locations have much better service if you can get to them!"
Edward S.,"Melville, NY",3,23,,4.0,9/26/2011,"HATE TO ADMIT But i am a fan. usually not a fan of chains, but I always find myself popping in for a bite Great Drinks and good food. BEST BLOODY MARYS AROUND!!!! Love the white bean hummus, and though really not healthy, the fried mac n cheese is sinful!"
Jason L.,"Flushing, NY",62,76,24,4.0,8/7/2013,"Definitely one of the better Cheesecake Factory's I've been to.  The Westbury location's quality has been dropping for awhile now and there aren't any signs of it picking up.  Most of the chain restaurants in Westbury in fact have been going downhill for quite awhile now(except for the new Shake Shack which I actually find it to be better than the one's in Manhattan, apart from the original location).  This location seems to at least try and keep the quality of the food and service up to par, like how it used to be when these chains first started opening.  I'd only wish they'd bring back the onion strings on there appetizer menu."
Jennifer L.,"Malba, Queens, NY",6,26,1,4.0,5/26/2014,"I always go to this Cheesecake Factory when I out shopping by the Walt Whitman mall. The menu is so big and it can be overwhelmed. But if you go during their lunch time hours, you can get a good portion of food for almost a fraction of the cost. I love to get the Parmesan crusted chicken. Although they have some good appetizer. I like the fried cheese ball."
Matthew H.,"Menlo Park, CA",77,442,84,3.0,2/1/2011,"I visited this version of the Cheesecake chain on a Saturday afternoon. Partly due to the nearby mall, we had a brief wait before being seated. Our server, Michelle, was busily running all over. But she didn't leave us waiting. The whole place was full, partly due to college football being on the big screens. On to the food! I had the Navajo sandwich with a side green salad. This was grilled chicken on the sinful fry bread. If you are here for lunch, definitely try it!"
Shana H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,29,1,4.0,4/13/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory! The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is bc  9 out 10 times I've gone, there's been about a 45 min wait. I guess it's not really their fault that business is great for them, but I don't want to wait 45 min every time I try to go there.  The layout and decor is really nice and I've never felt crammed even though it's always busy. The portions are big and the food is well flavored and delicious. Love the quesadilla, calamari, wings, pasta and chicken dishes. I love this drink they have - forgot the name - but it's a pink drink w/foam and tastes like desert. I'm not a big cheesecake eater but I love their brownie hot fudge sundae! YUMMM."
Louis C.,"Woodbury, NY",1,35,33,2.0,9/22/2013,Second or third time here. Overrated not impressed with the food & absolutely not worth 50 min wait. My wife had wasabi tuna & again the couldn't get it the way she liked. Her dinner arrived when we were all finished. No matter what I have ordered here it always taste the same. This place is not worth the money.
