Adam K.,"Plainview, NY",24,4,,5.0,8/12/2013,"Came here for my birthday, august 2 and my experience was amazing. The staff was very nice, the place was clean, and getting a table didn't take long either (and we were a party of 5)! For my appetizer, I went for the crispy fried cheese which we all shared (I got more than everybody lol). For my main course, I had the four cheese pasta. It was so good. SO GOOD! I wanted to finish it but I was filled but I had a tiny bit of room for a light dessert. I ordered vanilla ice cream but my grandma whispered to the waiter that it was my birthday and they put a candle in the ice cream and our waiter and 3 other waiters sang happy birthday to me! We left happy and I would definetly come here again!"
Dave N.,"Great Neck, NY",79,290,,5.0,1/12/2010,"This is my favorite restaurant chain.  Everything I've ever eaten here was amazing.  Favorite is the tons of fun burger (for you burger lovers this is awesome). I'm not a cheesecake fan, but like their cheesecake (adam's peanut butter fudge ripple is my favorite). The only downside is the wait sometimes. Don't plan on ever getting seated right away."
AJ P.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,68,12,3.0,9/16/2012,Ate here once Greasy food. Horrible. Slow service but it was full. Dessert was pretty good. Recommend it at least once for the experience. It is a really nice looking place.
Dank S.,"Austin, TX",48,100,22,4.0,1/12/2010,"Whatever, it's good, OK? The fries are awesome. The mashed potatoes are awesome. The eggplant sandwich is good, albeit greasy. On my most recent visit, I ordered the chicken burrito SANS chicken. It's gigantic and comes with rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole on the side. Unfortunately, there were giant chunks of chicken in it. Oh well, not a big deal, just sent it back! Well, the second time around, it came with tiny pieces of chicken in it. Odd...I can't figure out whether the chicken is already mixed in with the other ingredients (in which case just tell me they can't make it without chicken) or the chef doesn't understand the concept of a meat-free diet. Either way, I got my meal for free, but by the time my second burrito came out, my family was done eating and there was no time to order a new meal :( Just giving that anecdote to warn vegetarians to stick with the already meatless dishes. Aside from this, Cheesecake Factory rarely disappoints, and although I try to stay away from chains, sometimes you just have to have really well made, greasy food..."
Margaret M.,"Centerport, NY",0,23,,1.0,12/6/2013,"On a Monday night at 6pm there was more staff than customers all congregating at the hostess desk - they barely moved for you to get by.  Poor management.  Service ok - pleasant enough waiter.  In an empty restaurant waited 1/2 hour for a sandwich and burger.  The pit beef sandwich had an unusual aroma and the bread was too hard to bite.  The burger was ordered medium well but was sooo dry.  The waiter came by to ask if everything was ok almost 15 minutes later - too late for us to send anything back as we had an appointment at 7pm.  Asked for the check and left.  Stopped at Burger King after our appointment - better food, better service.  With all the new restaurants at the Walt Whitman Mall you would think management would be on their toes.  On the way out staff was still hanging out at the hostess desk - we could barely get past them.  Still empty at 7pm. We know why!"
Chrissy K.,"Huntington, NY",13,50,1,2.0,7/4/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory hasn't been much of a favorite of mine. The service always seems to be very slow. The portions are very large, especially the breakfast burrito! I do order the Chinese chicken salad when I go there. And I do have to say the cheesecakes are great. I had the Oreo Cheesecake last time I went. It was delish. But when I feel like having one, I just go for the desert because the plates are so large that I never have room for it when I have dinner also."
Apaar V.,"Wyandanch, NY",22,6,,4.0,2/18/2011,"Great for a late night dinner. Really big portions so you're always stuffed by the time you leave. And the cheesecakes! So many to choose from but I believe the classic is always the best way to go, although they should maybe have one or two more sugar free desserts."
Jeff O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",465,1254,214,3.0,10/24/2008,"Outstanding Avocado rolls. Crispy and sweet, fatty and soft. Wow.  Their space is either a tomb or a palace like a mahal or something else obsessively grand and purple. The air. There's plenty of air up there. The air. It's watching you.  The staff is nice and good looking and trained well. It's all a sham. What's real here? What's developed in a test lab with monkeys as mock diners and apes as their servers? All those ropes courses and leadership training activities paid off. I've always had textbook delightful service here.  Entrees are bland. I don't think they take chances with them as much as their appetizers.Their burgers are gigantic and pretty much delicious. Finishing a burger meal is sickening. Portion control, mother fuckers!"
Jeff P.,"Melville, NY",182,841,193,3.0,11/21/2008,"When I was growing up in Plainview, when we said we were going to ""the mall,"" we meant Walt Whitman. Back then the mall was kinda dumpy with Macy's where Bloomingdale's is now and A & S where Macy's is now and there was a McCrory's in between before it burned down. The only place to eat was a crappy Burger King or you could score some candy at Chez Chocolat or a cookie at some cookie place.  Now, there are plenty of places to eat including this Cheesecake Factory where the Century's Whitman movie theater stood for a long ass time.  When my mother asked what I was in the mood for for lunch, I could not make up my mind. Maybe it was jet lag, maybe it was just my general indecisiveness. So, I picked here since there menu has 42,378 selections on it.  I was surprised that the place was not more packed at 12:30 on a Friday. Happily surprised. It was also one of the smallest Cheesecake Factory's I think I have even been it. The room is fairly unimaginative with all the tables in straight rows.  Our server was very friendly and informative but she disappeared when I was aching for a refill on my Diet Coke. The food was Cheesecake Factory food . . . . large heaps of mediocre food at a decent price."
Zack S.,"Northport, NY",104,90,3,4.0,11/4/2013,Awesome time for my first experience at a Cheescake Factory! Food was very good and decor was awesome. Very unique!
Frank M.,"Northport, NY",42,80,4,4.0,7/26/2011,"Huge selection/menu. Something for everyone's taste. Food is very tasty. Some hits , some misses. Ask the wait staff what is good. Very crowded."
Matt K.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,13,7,5.0,11/8/2010,yeaaaaa buddddy good place right here! never get itailian food here stick wit the solids like burger. i forgot which one is got but i swear it had mac sauce on it man that thing was good! and huge! the cheesecake is amazing no doubt about it! every flavor is good i think! for apps i recommend ummm they are like buffalo wing triangles but inside of the triangle is the buffalo meat mmmm so good like a fried buffalo chicken stuffed ravioli yeaaaaaa man  the best experience i had was on a cold september night we sat outside and there was only another couple sitting outside. really nice around like 9pm it was chilly but the outdoor heaters made it perfect !!!!! it was very bust inside but outside was fabulous.   the waitress was very nice and quickly replaced my stale fries that were standing under a hot lamp with a new piping hot plate of fries!
Hannah S.,"Huntington, NY",92,104,55,4.0,5/21/2013,First of all I really loved this place until they started to put the calories on their menus!! Now eating there is always resulting in guilt. They probably have the best selection of American food here: the menu looks and weighs as much as a bible.
Shawn F.,"Old Bethpage, NY",48,11,3,3.0,7/31/2011,"Waitstaff is friendly, menu is extremely large with a lot of enchanting choices, very affordable pricing, service is fast, and the food is pretty good. One caveat though, I was delighted to enter the bathroom and find paper towels  and water all over the floor, also.. there was a honey nut cheerio in the urinal, how did it get there? I'll leave that for you to ponder."
Kelly H.,"South Huntington, NY",80,12,,4.0,6/22/2011,"Love the menu and the food, but the wait to be seated is ALWAYS way to long....even on weeknights.  Sometimes I will change my plans to go to another restaurant because of the dreadful wait.  4 stars for the food, menu, and waitress service!!"
Jessica R.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,4,,4.0,10/14/2014,really cool place to try their signature cheese cake. two thumbs up.
Dori D.,"Melville, NY",4,13,,4.0,2/27/2011,Love the cheesecakes!!! Went for brunch and the ricotta pancakes were yummy.
Sarah Elizabeth M.,"South Burlington, VT",0,15,,2.0,5/15/2013,The interior was great and pretty. I will only eat the fries and deserts. The chicken sandwich i had was fatty and veiny. My mom got extremely sick after eating a Cobb salad from this location. The eggs were most likely old.
Heather C.,"Alexandria, VA",436,279,165,5.0,7/13/2009,"I was here for lunch, and my experience far exceeded my expectations. We were seated right away, and the waitress came over very quickly to tell us the specials and take our drink orders as well as give us free bread (the brown bread- whole grain, pumpernickel?? i don't know what it is, but it was delicious).  We all ordered lunch specials, and for $11 we got these enormous salads with the best dressings I've had in a long time. I ordered the Santa Fe, which had a peanut cilantro dressing and my friend had the Asian salad which came with a plum dressing. We also had the spinach dip as an appetizer and it was garlicky and oniony and not too heavy, and the chips that came with it were warm and addictive. Everything was so good and we left with plenty of leftovers.  Also, the service was really on point and any time we needed refills for drinks or napkins, the waitress was really polite and did a great job. I wish there were locations closer to the city because this place is so good. I definitely recommend it especially for lunch."
Susan M.,"Plainview, NY",0,7,,5.0,9/5/2012,"I frequent Cheesecake Factory often, eat in and take out.  The last time we did takeout my family and I were very disappointed in the salads and one of the main dishes was incorrect.  I generally never complain and let things go, but this time I decided to  go back to the restaurant with my receipt and ask for a manager.  Well not only did he compensate me for all the food but generously rounded up for my trouble.  What incredible customer service!!  We will definitely return soon."
