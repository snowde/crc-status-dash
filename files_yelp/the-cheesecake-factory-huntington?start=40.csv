Pamala S.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,90,60,4.0,6/4/2016,"Seating was immediately available. No wait.  The Factory Nachos and The Everything Pizza was absolutely scrumptious. The other members of my party ordered the crispy shrimp sandwich and the fish and chips. I sampled their food and found the seafood to be bland, lacking any flavor. For dessert I had the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake.  It was too rich with no break at all from the intensity of the sweetness. It was literally like eating a slice of 20 candy bars at once.  Next time I'm sure I'll find a dessert I enjoy with all the options they have."
Theresa W.,"New York, NY",42,17,49,1.0,9/15/2017,"We visited this establishment around 8:30pm on a Friday night. We figured that it would be a wait, but we got sat right away. At first our server was very attentive. The appetizer came out super fast. Our server left for the evening and a new server was assigned to our table. Unfortunately, after we received our appetizers, we waited about an hour and twenty minutes for entrees that never came. The server noted about 40 minutes into us waiting that the food was on its way. There was tables next to us that were sat after us and received their food and their check. Finally, the server brought an entree out, but it was only one and it wasn't what was originally ordered. I noted to the server that we ordered two entrees and what was brought out wasn't even what I ordered. Needless to say we asked for the check which took an additional 10 minutes. I could understand if the restaurant was extremely busy, but it was not crowded. The server was apologetic about the experience but unfortunately, there is no way to make up wasting an hour and a half of your life. Sigh."
CJ R.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",0,1,1,5.0,1/9/2017,Food was Excelled Alison the server was attentive food came out and reasonable time and everything was delicious
Mathew F.,"Melville, NY",4,17,,1.0,5/21/2017,I came in and waited 20 minutes for a table: even though plenty of tables are available. I sat at the table for 1 hour with no service at all No water no anything.... I got frustrated and left Don't think I will be coming back here....
Maria K.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,5,,1.0,3/27/2017,"Cheesecake Factory what a joke about being a ""restaurant"" . I just called to request 2 tables for Saturday at 4:00 in the afternoon and was turned down. The manager Ian stated they tried reservations and it didn't work in the past. My reply so you judge everyone based on that.  I even offered my credit card, even offered to pay for the meals upfront, and to be told not our policy. Policies are made to be broken especially if I was willing to pay ahead of time.  Cheesecake Factory is obviously a fly by night ""fast food"" place if they can't accommodate respectable people. What a way to run a business.  Maria"
Autumn B.,"West Sayville, NY",83,2,,1.0,7/15/2017,"By far the worst experience ever; surprised as I've always been a fan. Should have had indication that this would be bad as gentlemen at table next to me complained that he was almost done with his meal and his protein still hadn't arrived.  So we sit down. My son orders a root beer, ceaser  salad no Parmesan cheese w steak (I had to remind the server to ask how he'd like it cooked) and his order came out fine. I ordered a club soda with lime, ahi tuni salad w dressing on the side with no carrots. Drinks come; he gets his club soda, I get a sprite- I  let the server know (very nice guy and is why I'm giving this a one star review). He replaced sprite with club soda- however bar never replaced the glass so now I have a healthy mix of club soda and sprite (I find this out later after I speak to the manager). I had to ask for bread (which is by far aside from cheesecake a favorite of mine) came with butter swimming in melting ice water. Ordered ahi tuni salad... this is served cold (yuck! Tuna pieces very small and ice chilled - meaning it was cooked earlier in the day and taken out later when ordered) requested it with dressing on the side and no carrots. Low and behold it comes swimming in dressing with additional dressing on the side....asked for the manager; explained why I wasn't happy as the tuna is cold, club soda was a sprite and the butter is swimming in ice water. I explained this isn't how an ahi tuna salad is made/served to which he repeatedly stated ' that's how it is here' advised I'm not happy with it to please bring me a menu. At this point is when I take a sip of club soda to find out they just dumped sprite out and refilled the same glass with club soda (gag.. not even a rinse out; forget a fresh glass). Server comes with menu, advised no longer interested in anything else, to just bring the check.  At this point bill comes and I see they nicely credited the ahi tuna salad but did not credit the unrinsed sprite/soda water. Which has me just peeved for basic hygienic reasons alone... Beware all those that choose to eat here 7/15/17 - as to response to review response - none appears from my response on google... so not sure whom you replied to. Don't worry will be contacting corporate as well as stockholders and investors :))"
N A.,"West Babylon, NY",2,48,73,5.0,5/8/2016,This is such a beautiful Cheesecake Factory. It feels like I'm in Disney World. Nicely decorated and built. Great location right next to Walt Whitman Mall. The waiters are so friendly; such good service. The food is fresh. I love the fried mac n cheese for appetizer. You can't go wrong with any of the cheese cakes. Key lime is a fave of mine.  I like going here for Sunday Brunch. Brunch ends at 2pm. The Monte Cristo sandwich is my absolute favorite. It's the ultimate brunch meal with mimosas. This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory.
Nancy F.,"Commack, NY",1,22,2,1.0,5/26/2017,"You'll be so hungry by the time you finally get seated anything will taste good. We waited over an hour when they told us 30-40 minutes. This is no way to treat customers. I was so hungry I had to eat a granola bar while waiting. If you're health conscious don't even bother looking at the regular menu. You can easily consume a few days' worth of fat, sodium and calories in one meal. But that's probably the case with a lot of restaurants. This one was just forced to reveal the dirty little secret. That said, I did like my dish--Tuscan Chicken from the Skinnylicious menu. But I wouldn't come back until they decide to start respecting their patrons' time and take reservations."
Jordan V.,"REGO PARK, NY",0,5,,1.0,4/22/2017,"I went to Walt Whitman mall Cheesecake Factory and waited two hours for two side salads, my drink never refilled my child's meal delivered incorrectly and sent back, my steak over cooked and fatty. I asked to speak to manager and he told me I should've asked to talk to a manager sooner, Mr. Benitez thanks for blaming me for inept service.He did not apologize or offer me anything but his card. He said he will take care of me next time I come back. That'll never happen, I'll never go back.Totally horrible experience , on my birthday no less.   $40 for two side salads and an hour and half for kids spaghetti and crispy rolls. Ridiculous."
A Felice B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,41,1,3.0,9/9/2017,"We always frequent this location because we love the food. The service is usually pretty good as well. However, last night it appears we were forgotten about. We had empty dishes on our table for quite some time with no waitress in sight. Finally, a hostess came by to seat other guests. We said excuse me to her maybe 5x and you could tell she did not want to be bothered. We asked her if she can bring us our check and her response was I'm not your waitress with an attitude. I know you are not my waitress, and sorry to bother you, but maybe if we could find her we wouldn't have to ask you. As someone who works in a service industry, a nice response would be let me go find your waitress. A hostess should always be friendly and pleasant ... that's just my opinion."
Ab W.,"Hewlett, NY",1,131,,3.0,5/4/2017,"In earlier days, I would have found this place acceptable, but not impressive. Today, lunching with my two 30 month old grand children and their mother, it was a delight. A step up from our usual diner in atmosphere, ambience, food quality and service (go Angela B). Kiddy menu had a great selection to please the kids. Pizza for one, sliders for her brother. Each double what the kids needed. My own food, a salad / sandwich / soup combo, was really good and much more food than I could handle.  Deserts were surprisingly unimpressive. Kids were  happy with ice cream, but the cakes struck me as dry.  This looks like it's going to be a regular stop for us in the area."
Ethan F.,"Melville, NY",0,1,,2.0,9/1/2017,"The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the nice bartender that took our order. Our waiter spent 30 minutes talking to the table next to us. After telling the hostess she told him to hurry up, but he didn't. After finally after two and a half hours and speaking to the manager. The manager was also not very helpful. He told us that if we wanted to ""chitchat"" we would have complained."
Renee J T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",212,674,2615,5.0,9/17/2015,"Its a chain  and its sometimes hard to find close parking in the lot..but if your going to eat a 1200 calorie slice you might as well take that little walk I honestly love this chain the warm brown bread they always give you is so good the menu boasts lots of salads and they are darn good they recently changed their menu and added lots of ""healthy salads""  called super food salads you would be hard pressed to find such decent salads at other eating establishments I have tried their Kale and quinoa its very earthy and good  and the super antioxidant salad made of Salad Greens, Spinach, Kale, Avocado, Broccoli, Grapes, Roasted Pear, Blueberries, Onion, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds with Lemon-Blueberry Vinaigrette the dressing is really good and such a change from most. The waiter told me they actually squeeze the blueberries. my daughter had chicken and biscuits big and hearty chicken and gravy  though their recipe changed on the biscuit recipe changed  menu is filled with everything salads, sandwiches,fish, you name they have it  the is a also a light menu  everything clearly has the calories shown including their cheesecakes  one of the main reasons we love the factory is their splenda cheesecake for my diabetic mom it is truly a godsend where else can you get a big fat slice of sugar free cheesecake that looks good and is good they will even put a real candle in and sing happy birthday  service is always very friendly the place is always clean  sometimes there is a wait ...I am willing to wait the  20 min"
Janet C.,"Mastic Beach, NY",15,10,6,2.0,1/27/2017,Usually I love coming here and enjoying a great meal. Today was different :(. My friend and I came in for a meal like normal and ended up waiting a while hour just for lettuce wraps and a pork chop. Katarina our waitress was friendly but I don't know why our meal took so long to arrive. I really would love to come back to The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington but it seems like for a Friday afternoon the service was unacceptable.
Calvin L.,"Elmhurst, NY",1,3,1,2.0,5/30/2016,"Disappointed... The floors were sooo slippery, it was super gross! Not sure if it management gets this place mopped or cleaned anywhere. Almost slipped on the way to my table, on the way to the restroom, in the restroom... Hell, technical anytime I'm not in my seat at the table I risk a fall. Unfortunately, this  set the tone for rest of the night.  I had ribeye... It was cooked decent however it was so rough and stuff that I wonder where they get their meat if there is any fat to it. Not much of a ribeye if you ask me, quality was bad but it was cooked fine.  Couldn't really complain about the service. Nothing stellar and nothing negative, just very middle of the road. Don't think I'd ever come back as food quality (food prep was ok) compared to other Cheesecake Factories was below average and the slippery floors... Oooooh the gross, slippery floors really did it for me."
Henry L.,"Greenlawn, NY",292,176,610,4.0,8/3/2015,"Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, decided to take the fam there for a Monday night dinner, we hate to go during crowded nights on Fridays or Saturdays.  Wasn't busy as expected and were seated immediately in a booth. The decor was an Egyptian theme with high ceilings, bar was nice and bottles stacked tall on glass shelves.  We felt Waiter Joe was rushing us a bit in the beginning but he warmed up a bit later.  He addressed our nut allergy concerns and actually looked into it more for us.  Drinks and apps came quickly with the right pace, he asked if we wanted bread which I thought was a bit strange, doesn't everybody get bread or did he not want to bother with the extra work? Apps were good, entrees followed shortly after.  My Hibachi steak was good but Luke warm, also the beef was marinated in a sweet sauce, too sweet for me!  My wife had the shrimp gumbo!! The sauce was an amazing spicy and extremely flavorful mixed broth!  It was fantastic, we also had a couple of pasta dishes which were good but nothing special to write about.  Biggest disappointment was the strawberry cheesecake, ok, but if your name is Cheesecake Factory, it should have blown my head off to Mars! My head stayed right there on my neck, and made me think about North Shore Farms Cherry Cheesecake instead.   After a few bites of our entrees, we all looked at each other and thought the same thing.....oh boy am I full! Took everything to go, asked for a check drop, left 20% tip (well deserved) and stuck $160 cash in the bill fold.  Rolled ourselves out to the parking lot groaning! Had a great experience!"
Dara E.,"Smithtown, NY",59,2,,4.0,8/9/2017,"Let me tell you about another experience at The Cheesecake Factory, this one quite different than the rest. My waiter, name unknown, simply wasn't amused by my enthusiasm. When I go to The Cheesecake Factory, I become the best version of myself. I sense the brown bread and I transform into someone with clear skin and a 4.0 GPA. Although my waiter did not contribute to this enthusiasm, he brought the 8th wonder of the world, brown bread. I wasn't sure what to order. I wasn't necessarily the hungriest I've ever been but I just can't pass up a good meal. After the brown bread, I got my meal. I chose a veggie burger and it was spectacular. However, I knew there was more potential. Once we ordered more brown bread, I figured it out. I stuffed my brown bread with veggie burger, pickles, and even a single French fry. It was the best decision I've ever made. Once we were done eating, our waiter's mood seemed to have changed. A once upset looking man turned into a happy and pleasant waiter. This helped my experience to become even better. Although this doesn't stand out to me as much as my other dining experiences, I ended up very happy with my time at The Cheesecake Factory."
Cristina G.,"Huntington Station, NY",18,6,,1.0,1/13/2017,"I've been coming here for many years and I usually always get the Tuna takai salad, but tonight I was not only disappointed with the service but also with the portion of tuna and avocado slices on my salad.  They were such skimpy pieces, not worth the money. Time to explore other restaurants."
Minee O.,"Melville, NY",25,3,,2.0,2/17/2017,Brought take out tonight and I didn't get part of my meal. I called 2xs to speak to a manager. I was on hold for 5-10 mins and manager never picked up. Both times I had to hang up. Couldn't wait forever.
Ted ..,"Paramus, NJ",1,10,,1.0,1/17/2017,"On a rainy night had the bad experience of having to deal with a ill mannered manager after ordering a cob salad for take out and driving 45 mins round trip in bad weather to find out the cobb salad had no chicken, no bacon, almost no egg and two cubes of tomato...only to have the manager simply offer a free of charge salad and a cheesecake which we declined. He made no attempts to satisfy the customer and only did the minimum required showing no consideration for the hassles, loss of time, peace and money driving back and forth. Make sure he does not bully you just because its business as usual for him but a bad experience when it was supposed to be an expensive treat for yourself or a loved one. Cheesecake factory is not cheap and one expects better service but most of all better treatment by the store manager."
