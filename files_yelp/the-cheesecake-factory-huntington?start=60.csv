Christina M.,"Bayville, NY",0,15,,4.0,2/9/2017,"Came here on a busy friday night however I was not disappointed one bit, service and food spot on. Very large portions. Pricing is very reasonable, I will be back. I enjoyed it thoroughly"
Char C.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",92,3,4,5.0,12/24/2016,"I go here on occasion and both the service and the food have been impeccable. They train their staff very well from what it seems. Usually, you never know what kind of service you are going to get but I can't say I've had a bad experience here yet. Nor do I want to"
Trivani R.,"New York, NY",2,16,,4.0,12/11/2016,I've been here on numerous occasions and their food always seems fresher than the other cheesecake factories I've been too. There usually isn't a very long wait and the staff is very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend the hot spinach and cheese dip for appetizers and spicy chipotle chicken pasta for main course. For dessert I haven't been able narrow down a favorite yet because they are all so delicious. I highly recommend this location!
Cephas K.,"Commack, NY",14,127,339,5.0,5/2/2016,"This is a good place like most of the other store but the staff is awesome, very friendly and funny. Food is really good like always. I would definitely recommend this place."
Bonnie E.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,34,,3.0,3/25/2017,"The food was okay minus.  My son's kids meal was spaghetti and meatballs (1 meatball - hard and on the small size by kid standards). My veggie burger was not tasty this time,and the salad was bitter. The iced teas were overpriced.  The only thing yummy was the tiramisu cheesecake."
Megan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,12,,5.0,5/28/2017,"The food was great.  I ordered a burger and fries, both of which were amazing.  Our server, Liz, was great and very friendly.  Was extremely satisfied."
Tony B.,"Hicksville, NY",1,21,,2.0,5/9/2016,"Um, we've been here many times and love the place. We just got home from a visit there that was quite subpar. We arrived at 9pm and there was no hostess at the entrance. We waited for about 10 minutes before a server came over and finally spoke to us. He sat us down at a booth. Although the place was empty, a waiter didn't arrive at our table for another 10 minutes. The service was slow as molasses. Our drinks were never refilled and one of our side orders was wrong. They brought us our correct side dish but it did take a long time. The food was great once it all arrived, can't complain about that. We'll be back. But I would suggest always having a hostess there, even later in the evening. And speed up the service a bit. I guess all the good staff took the day off after working so hard on Mothers Day."
Kori A.,"Deer Park, NY",9,141,15,3.0,9/15/2016,"Floors were so slippery I could have sled to my table. Food was okay, their avocado egg rolls are really good. Cheesecake wasn't great, I had their mango one. I'll probably come again during the week. Weekend's it gets crazy. Oh and if you hate Walt Whitman Mall, then avoid!"
Samantha M.,"Smithtown, NY",114,19,2,5.0,8/3/2016,"Last night I went to Cheesecake with my girlfriend, we had a lovely time and the food was great. I had only finished about half my salad when I decided I was done and wanted to take the rest home. This morning, I opened it up and to my displeasure saw that someone had dumped creamy salad dressing all over my food! I called them this morning and they gave me my salad, for free, dressing on the side. Thank you Ron, the manager, for excellent customer service!"
Aleksand A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,,4.0,5/30/2017,Food is delicious and  portions are huge. Love eating here for a quick place when I'm home. Food is OD fat tho
Christina R.,"Commack, NY",73,127,30,1.0,12/9/2015,"Let me start out by saying that I love Cheesecake Factory. I love the menu and always enjoy my food. I have visited several times throughout the years with no complaint. Until recently... My friend and I visited a few months back on a weekday. We were enjoying our meals which included appetizers, cocktails, entrees and desserts. All was well until a roach crawled up the wall and onto the table. We didn't freak out since there were other customers nearby and we have both worked in the restaurant business and sometimes roaches appear in restaurants-last thing we would want was to freak everyone out around us. We called over the busboy and who killed it for us and explained he would get the manager.  I wish I got the managers name but I didn't think I needed it because I assumed that we would get an apology and at the very least, some type of assurance that we would return. We got the apology but nothing else. Not a drink comp, appetizer or desserts. No discount on our bill either! I am still completely disgusted-not so much by the roach-but by the fact that the manager did nothing but utter an apology and an ""eh, you know...it happens"".  The ""Walt Whitman Shops"" attract people who are very, very quick to complain regarding just about everything; the clientele who frequent the upscale ""mall"" believe that they deserve nothing but the best. We could have made such a scene around these people regarding the roach or our treatment by the management but because the manager saw that we weren't that ""type"" our complaint was disregarded entirely. As I mentioned before, I have worked in the restaurant business and this manager was way off-no way do you let a customer leave without ensuring they would return after something as gross as a roach crawls near them while they are eating. HUGE fail on their part! There are also many other new restaurants that Walt Whitman Shops have added which I now frequent. Never will I return. Mr. Manager whom I wish I got your name: you're disgraceful!"
Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",319,759,47,3.0,12/14/2014,"When thinking of the word 'epic', certain cultural milestones come to mind. Think Homer's Odyssey, the travels of Ibn Battuta, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia and of course, Gilgamesh. Enter the Cheesecake Factory's menu and  calorie count. Future archaeologists will excavate the premises and speculate what gods were worshiped here based on the pillars, Egyptian-like faces and a staff adorned in all white. Many myths focus on a book and Cheesecake Factory is no different. Here it's called the menu and you can spend days visiting and never have the ill fortune of ordering the same item twice. It is that exhaustive and awe-inspiring, where the list of cheesecakes alone tops 20 and begins to enter new area of combinatorial possibilities. (Like key lime pie? Then why not have a key lime pie cheesecake? Do that for 'insert the blank' dessert and you'll likely find a mutation on the menu in cheesecake form) But before this takes a turn into predictable elitist bashing of a form of dining popular with the entire world, let's not forget that Cheesecake Factory started out as a mom and pop shop, or in this case, bakery. By 1978, the bakery spawned a restaurant and nearly forty years later spans the globe. (I walked past one in a mall in Dubai). I'm never one to disparage success and so went into the Factory with an open mind, hungry for lunch. And lunch is available until 5pm which includes discounted prices and smaller, healthier portions on certain combinations. Think sandwich and salad, selected entrees and pizza/salad combo. I went for the pizza/salad combo but not after some serious soul searching and health considerations. The health social engineers who mandate calorie counts on menus managed to dissuade me from 2000+ calorie choices...this time. So my pizza margherita and caesar salad arrived fairly quickly but not so quick as to arouse suspicion of microwaving my meal. A crispy crust, not too much sauce and an acceptable mozzarella made me realize that this actually isn't that bad. In fact, several bites in and I was thinking this was better than some pizzerias and other restaurants with less corporate cred.  The caesar salad arrived in a plate and filled the plate to capacity. I grazed away on 3/4s of the salad before calling it quits so as to save room for the restaurant's namesake-- cheesecake! I'll also add that seating was exceptionally comfortable, the bathrooms cleaner than most and the staff friendly and accommodating.  Coming in at under 1000 calories is the strawberry cheesecake which I shared with my wife. There were many other temptations calling out to me involving peanut butter, bananas, chocolate, mousse and other sweet treats. I resisted and plunged my fork into the chunk of cheesecake adorned with strawberries and a sugary sauce.  Creamy, rich and cleaning the plate worthy, this cheesecake sold me on the premise that I will return in the future. While the menu is a virtual bible, skip to the last chapter for the revelation that is cheesecake and you'll be saved."
Brian S.,"Roslyn, NY",28,24,,3.0,8/15/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory used to be my go to spot for end of the week binge eating sessions with a slice of cheesecake to seal the deal to bring me on the brink of unconsciousness from food coma related symptoms. Lately, the food has been just decent; there has definitely been a slight drop in quality. However, my biggest gripe is the tiny sliver of cheesecake you get when you order your dessert to go. My health can definitely benefit from eating less cheesecake, but for the premium price you pay, you should get a better product. All in all, the Cheesecake Factory is ok; your friends will think you're 10.5% classier for choosing the Cheesecake Factory over Applebee's and Friday's, the portions are still enormous, the food is typically somewhat decent and you now pay more for less cheesecake. That's America, I guess."
Marie L.,"New York, NY",343,256,1268,4.0,10/28/2015,"Visited today for lunch. We were seated right away. Our server was very friendly. We ordered a skinnylicious chopped factory salad and the southwestern chicken sandwich. Both dishes were delicious and the portions were nicely sized. For a chain restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory never fails."
Fawn G.,"Brooklyn, NY",92,153,2462,5.0,4/12/2015,Delicious grilled chicken tostada salad! The waitress Susan C is a terrific waitress: very accommodating and knowledgeable about caloric content on that delicious health bread.  All in all really enjoyable early dinner.
Orla M.,"Long Island, NY",539,256,2791,5.0,2/23/2014,Yummy in my tummy. The two floor location is busy and the 30min wait is so worth it.  The service was great. I ordered the factory burger. It was so good. My friend ordered the filet Mignon and if course I had to have a bite. It was a really really really good steak! This is a must stop in and grab a bite if your in the area.  I can't wait to go back to stuff my face.
Theresa G.,"North Babylon, NY",0,7,,5.0,11/11/2016,We have been here so many times and it's always great.  This past weekend was extra special because out of all the places my 16yo chose here for lunch with a bunch of friends and was so delighted when they sang happy birthday.  We always see it done but just felt special happening to her.  Bravo Cheesecake!
Victor H.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",133,628,2561,3.0,12/6/2013,"It has a  great environment, decoration, ambience, etc...  Not great for lunch as I went there for lunch with co-workers. Definitely great for date and celebrations.  Food is ok, not the best one ever not the worst... Been to places with better food. It was alright!"
Chris H.,"Dix Hills, NY",341,183,247,2.0,9/22/2014,"Some friends took us here for dinner the other night and I was a little disappointed. I heard so many great things about this restaurant but, as always, the experience did not live up to the expectations. One of the main reasons why we dined at Cheesecake was because our friends are addicted to the sweet corn tamale cakes and wanted us to try them. When we placed the order the waitress told us that they had run out of that appetizer. How does an established restaurant like Cheesecake Factory run out of an appetizer at 7:45 on a Tuesday evening? How is that even possible? The couple who took us there were devastated, however the waitress said that she would contact the manager to see if something could be done...a manager never came to the table. When the main courses arrived, only half of the table received their food. The other half had to wait another 10 minutes for the entrees to arrive. Why would you bring out only half of the meals knowing that it is rude to start eating when half of the table does not have a plate? By the time all of the food finally arrived, my food was cold. I ordered the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combination with the steak cooked medium rare. When the dish arrived my chicken had no sauce and the steak consisted of only two small medallions that were overcooked. People have always told me that the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory were huge so, needless to say, I was extremely disappointed with the size and execution of my dish. On a positive note, we enjoyed the crab cake appetizer which surprisingly was about 90% crab (which is rare to find) and it came with a delicious dipping sauce. Hopefully, if we come back, the food and service will be better. Perhaps Tuesday is not a good night to eat there."
Laina B.,"Melville, NY",0,26,,3.0,4/6/2017,"The food is okay, but the Dark Chocolate Godiva Cheesecake is the best thing ever!!!"
