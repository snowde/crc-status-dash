Damares R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,43,25,4.0,7/16/2016,"Went there and had a bad experience with the food served to me. Spoke to someone about it then the manager came to the table, although I did not ask for anything further than letting them know what I did not like, the manager was very sarcastic and was asking unacceptable questions which I was shocked to hear. Cheesecake Factory was always one of my favorite restaurants but not anymore. The manager's action was unacceptable."
Margaret C.,"Woodside, NY",0,7,3,5.0,10/25/2015,"Passion Fruit Margarita highly recomended. Wait time a little long, waited 25 min for party of 3 on a sunday night. The food... well worth it! Chicken Belagio sooo yummy! Tiramissu and Dulce de Leche Cheesecake was outta this world. Two thumbs up!!"
Danielle D.,"West Islip, NY",0,6,,4.0,3/24/2017,"I've had very poor experiences at this particular Cheesecake Factory (rude hostess, slow service, forgetful waiters, etc) however it has seemed to turn around completely these last couple months. The food is consistent and relatively fast for such a busy place. And I would have to say the bakery manager Ian is spectacular! Great customer service for take out bakery area as well as going around and checking on guests while he's the manager on duty. I've shared my positive feedback with him and would like to share it with yelp! Great job Ian and staff at cheesecake."
Ellen E.,"Melville, NY",0,3,,3.0,3/16/2017,"My friend and I went to cheesecake factory on Walt Whitman Rd., Huntington today because we saw that they had new items on their menu. One of the items was a salad with chicken avocado and mango. The chicken was visible because they sliced that but the mango and avocado was diced into  very small cubes and not at all satisfying. It probably won't be that bad if they presented it differently. I think it should all be whole slices and not diced up like a plate for a child. Then we decided to have dessert. We were looking at the ice cream. They have a wonderful ice cream sundae with nuts and  hot fudge that is now  $8.50. They also have a bowl of plain vanilla ice cream. When I asked if I could have hot fudge over the plain bowl of vanilla ice cream I was told that it would be $.40 more than the Hot fudge sundae?? What is that??  I think someone had better rethink and redo their pricing."
Philip C.,"Massapequa Park, NY",27,25,8,4.0,5/9/2016,This is not my first time at a Cheesecake Factory. The food was alright but I feel as if everything just taste he same after a while. This franchise is somewhat pricey even for appetizers and tapas. The tapas honestly sound better than their large selection of entrees. The staff was great and I have no complaints other than having to wait a while for the check. The desserts here are always fantastic. The food just kind of gets boring after a while.
Jessica D.,"Stratford, NJ",73,146,133,4.0,9/5/2015,Went here on a Friday night. The wait was about 25 min which isn't really that long for Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night. The service was quick and the food is what you expect from Cheesecake Factory.  I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp but this time I felt like the portion size was smaller. The plate was still as big but the amount of food that was on it was definitely less.
Alfredo D.,"Newark, NJ",12,164,16,4.0,2/24/2016,Great location & atmosphere for this restaurant. Decided to come here for a quick lunch with my wife.  Started with the tater tots which was delicious. For lunch i ordered the bacon-bacon cheeseburger which was fantastic.
Prince J.,"East Northport, NY",21,19,7,5.0,5/14/2016,"Been to a few cheesecake factories and this is by far my favorite! Food is perfection and staff is amazing. Steak Diane & Salmon combo is always my human's go-to. Love this place, always a pleasant visit. Can't wait to come back. Xoxo Prince"
Elizabeth V.,"Huntington Station, NY",1,2,,1.0,5/11/2016,"Came with a friend around 8:30pm on a Wednesday night for a quick appetizer and slice of cheesecake.....ended up being an hour and a half ordeal. We sat at our table with an EMPTY appetizer plate for at least 15 minutes while a group of servers (including our own) were a short 20 feet away chit chatting. Not to mention the restaurant was empty spare 3 or 4 tables. When our sever finally came over to us, it took several more minutes for our cheesecakes to come out. We once again sat with our empty plates while our sever visited the table next to us without even acknowledging us. When we FINALLY got our check at 9:30, my friend and I split it. She paid cash and the rest was put on my card. When our server returned with our check, my card was not in it. Of course, keeping with the theme of the night, our server was nowhere to be found. I had to walk over to the bakery section to get ANYONE'S attention. The very kind man at the bakery found our server in the kitchen. The server returned with my card.....which he had put in his POCKET.  I was a big fan of the cheesecake factory, but after my experience tonight with the service my friend and I received, I am seriously contemplating if I would ever come back. 0 stars if I could."
Alice H.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",8,25,17,2.0,9/2/2015,It's been a while since the last time I visited a Cheesecake Factory. I got the chicken & avocado sandwich and overall it was a mediocre meal. The chicken was dry and when the food came the bread was already soggy with tomato water. (The fries were good tho.) My friend asked for easy dressing on her chicken caesar salad and it was drenched with it.
Summer A.,"Manhattan, NY",55,77,89,5.0,3/27/2016,my favorite place in the world i love the herb crusted salmon. I would definently return again and again. great for a date or a large party
Karen M.,"Mineola, NY",0,16,,5.0,5/26/2015,"I'm somewhat mystified by The Cheesecake Factory. With a menu approximately the size of the Old Testament (complete with Talmudic commentary), you've gotta figure that a large percentage of their food has to come in frozen; how could it not be? No restaurant, especially a chain, could stock that many fresh ingredients, right? And yet, the food always tastes pretty darn good to me. Whether I get a tiny Endive Salad, a huge portion of Factory Huevos Rancheros for brunch, or the fried mozzarella balls for an appetizer, everything always tastes freshly-made and delicious. The Cheesecake *is* frozen, but it makes more sense to take that to go anyway, since you're usually too full after a meal there to indulge in dessert right away anyway (and their cheesecake softens up nicely a half-hour to an hour later.) Service at the Huntington location in particular has always treated me well, which isn't a small thing considering how busy it can get. I really don't understand how this restaurant does what they do, or if it's all an elaborate mind game I play on myself and the feeling of being inside a giant slice of cheesecake makes me think that the food tastes much better than it really does; maybe that makes more sense? Minor word of warning: I used to get the Factory Nachos, which were amazing, but the last few times we've gotten them, they just haven't been as good-- presentation is sloppier, components are too clumped together instead of spread throughout the plate, etc. Maybe this is just a fluke, but worth keeping in mind if you're in the mood for nachos; other appetizers are more consistent."
Ruben Q.,"Hicksville, NY",632,280,504,5.0,2/16/2015,"We came to this location with another couple and not by choice.  I'm really not a big fan of franchise. We had a gift card so we said what the hell... when we arrive the place was not busy at all. We were seated right away, and we were seated withh a waitres that knew her menu(Susan).  we started with apps and the cooks put the wrong sauce with the apps and she caught it..We had some drinks and they were pretty good... again overall everything was good but what made our experience a good one was susan..Kudos to susan, we will be back...."
Yellow L.,"Bethpage, NY",9,39,5,4.0,5/9/2016,"Went for Mother's day ... long wait which is normal for a holiday. Drinks excellent. Waiter was superb and attentive. However, sausage and shrimp pasta was way too salty. I could not eat half of it bc it was as such. My dad did not enjoy his either"
Melanie B.,"Huntington Station, NY",45,7,6,1.0,1/30/2016,"WMDSF Magazine Racism has many faces, some are extroverted while some are introverted. This may sound crazy but I have more respect for those whose racism is extroverted. I like to know what I'm dealing with, rather than finding out through small gestures. Today at The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Station, my good friend and I experienced racism from our introverted waitress, who denied serving us bread until we ordered, I however had already ordered an alcoholic beverage when the request for bread, while we decided what to order, was made. While I understand that certain policies might apply I get it, however when a Caucasian couple was seated right next to us they were immediately brought their drinks, water and bread all before they placed their order. Can someone anyone please tell me what's wrong with this picture? The situation got way worse from this point but I digress, needless to say this mixed race woman will not be returning to The Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Station, NY! #Banned #racismisnotaccepted#notwithmymoney #TheCheesecakeFactory#huntingtonstation #newyork"
M. B G.,,4,35,,2.0,1/31/2016,"I usually dine at The Cheesecake Factory a couple of times per year. It is nothing special, and the service never usally wows me -- to be honest, I come here because of the dessert and usually settle on a mediocre entree.  However, during my visit to this unit, they were out of MAC and CHEESE! Are you kidding me?! They were also out of the Godiva Brownie Sundae. Can you get a little bit better inventory management. I can imagine that a small mom-and-pop restaurant would be out of certain items, but at a publically traded restaurant like the Cheesecake Factory, this is simply unacceptable. Shame on you, CAKE."
Nicole P.,"Melville, NY",7,34,8,2.0,4/11/2015,"Service was wonderful and the restaurant was immaculate. The food unfortunately was  the greasiest I've ever had in my life. The nachos were not bad. I had the chicken tex egg roll app as my dinner and couldn't get 2 down. My hands were covered in oil. I understand they are deep fried, but it was a little much, and that was the end of my meal. I was not able to even try a piece of cheesecake. My son had Mac n cheese which he didn't finish and took home. I reheated today only to find a puddle of oil in the bottom of the plate. I threw it out. We will not be returning. I value our arteries way too much."
Baby5had0w ..,"Huntington Station, NY",12,4,21,1.0,4/26/2016,"Bad service. Never got my calamari. The drinks were horrible and still got charge for it. Food is over spiced. Tables smell dirty.  The fries were hard and salty. The bread was hard and cold. It was not a pleasant dinner. I just wanted to get out of there! Over priced meals, we were totally Disappointed!"
Jeff H.,"Sayville, NY",0,10,3,3.0,5/11/2016,"Food was alright, a little salty but that's been the generally trend of the cheese cake factory. The real reason for the 3 stars was the waiter and the fact he was not polite. Very sarcastic and rude towards the female guests. Think of when a boy is mean to a girl on the playground during recess. The guy needs to grow up."
Rina S.,"Greenlawn, NY",0,13,1,3.0,10/14/2016,Love the Godiva cheesecake and it's gluten free! Win win! The chicken dumpling sauce is delicious! Staff was friendly but slower than molasses! Their margarita recipe could use some work! I was surprisingly disappointed.
