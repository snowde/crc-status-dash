Mayan R.,"Irvine, CA",107,26,12,4.0,1/2/2018,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Spectrum is a great spot to meet up with friends for drinks and/or dinner. Unfortunately there are certain times (including Friday nights) when they are unable to make reservations, so we had to wait about 40 minutes to be seated. I wouldn't suggest waiting inside the restaurant because it is really rowdy, with lots of children running around. If you can find room in the bar, that's a nice place to chill out while waiting for a table. As always, Cheesecake Factory offers a menu filled with a wide selection of dishes (which are all massive-- big enough to share), complimentary bread baskets, and of course amazing dessert! Highly recommend the Oreo Cheesecake!"
Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",750,678,46,2.0,1/8/2018,"Et tu, Cheesecake Factory? I can't believe this abysmally low rating I'm giving to start out my 2018 on Yelp. But my brunch experience with the family this past Sunday sadly dashed my traditionally high expectations. Our server, Michael, and everyone else front of house that we encountered was very kind, if not a bit... off, to say the least. The hosts and hostesses seemed flummoxed, to put it mildly. If they're all turned upside down during quite possibly one of the busiest times of the week, then something else may be amiss. Toward the end of our meal, servers were asking if we would like boxes. Before we were all done. Then it took forever and a day to close out the bill. Right after receiving our food, we practically had to keep our water refills at bay. As we again were finishing, water was nowhere to be found. Thankfully a smile and genuine positive attitude, which all of our CF FOH exhibited, go a truly long way. Seven in our party, seven orders clearly made, six dishes come out. The missing one? The freaking pancakes, bacon and eggs. The easiest food. The kitchen had to redo my cousin's overeasy eggs because they'd become 'over hard' in the interim. What??? Apologies abound. These minute faults could easily be overlooked had I not been SUPREMELY disappointed in my entree. Fried chicken and waffles Benedict??? How could this go wrong? Chicken: fresh and plentiful but dreadfully underseasoned. A waffle clearly neither dense nor crisp enough to hold the weight of a Benedict dish. The breakfast potatoes, Hollandaise sauce and poached eggs were simply lovely. But sides, accompaniments, and nicely cooked eggs does not a brunch specialty make. The most heartbreaking component of this dish was the maple butter syrup. Which, btw, tasted like neither maple nor butter. Nor syrup. It was a thickened, glossy, watery version of lightly seasoned margarine. I don't get why this is even served when this is supposed to be the piece de resistance tying together an ambitious fusion dish as such. Anyway, the saving graces: the Pasta Napoletana, though denounced as being excessively unhealthy, is super yummy. Everyone else mostly loved their burgers and chicken dishes. Lastly, our key lime cheesecake was to die for! Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, but you're gonna have to win me back eventually if I'm gonna drop that much coin and wait that long for meh."
Shay N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",165,149,127,1.0,1/7/2018,"Just had the WORST visit to CCF that I've ever had. I have visited many locations in different states and have always had excellent experiences but today was unbelievable. I came here with two other people today (my boyfriend and friend). When we sat down, our waiter said he had 5 minutes left and someone else would be taking over. Once the new waiter arrived, I believe his name was Michael?, he seemed nice but we had no idea we would be stuck there for another 4 hours. After our dinner arrived, our waiter asked if we wanted anything else. My friend and I ordered a Smores cheesecake and a Salted caramel cheesecake. He said okay and left. 10 minutes later he came back and asked if we wanted dessert. We looked a little confused but repeated our order anyway. He left for another 10 minutes and came back and asked what we ordered. So we told him AGAIN. At this point, we are wondering why he did not write the order down. It was embarrassing that we had to tell him so many times.. Another 10 minutes goes by, he comes back around and says ""the receipt printer is broke can you tell me what your order was?"" So we told him AGAIN. Finally after waiting 45 minutes on our cheesecake, he finally brought it. For a while there, we actually thought we were being pranked because none of us have ever experienced something like this.  But the evening didn't end there. He brought a check by, it said 74 dollars. He didn't ask if we wanted to split it so we asked if we could split it (one check for my boyfriend and I combined, and another check for my friend). He said okay and took the check and walked away. 15 minutes later, he comes back and asks if we wanted to order anything. We looked at him, said no thanks, and he walked away. He came back shortly after with the SAME check and acted like we never asked for our check split. So we sat and waited for him to come back so we could tell him we wanted to split it again. Another 10 minutes goes by and he eventually comes by with the split check..  Our total ended up being around 47 dollars for my boyfriend and I. We put down TWO $20 bills and ONE $10.. He took our checks and came back saying we owed him $12 dollars. At this point we were furious. My boyfriend told him we paid with TWO $20s and ONE $10 and the waiter sat there ARGUING with us saying we did not give him any cash. We asked him how else would we have paid and he KEPT arguing saying we did not pay cash, again and again. After a few minutes he pulled out a check from his pocket and said ""oh is this your money??"" and Of course it was our correct ticket with both $20's and our $10. We have never heard of a waiter misplacing our money and then blaming us and accusing us of not paying.  I cannot believe that the management would let a waiter act like this to customers. We were so furious that we did not even wait for the manager. We hurried up and left as fast as we could since we had been there for almost 4 hours because our waiter kept us. What we dont understand is how tables with more people next to us, came in and out much faster than our table of 3... Either way, it was a miserable experience and I do not understand why this is acceptable."
Chase P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",26,35,11,1.0,1/6/2018,"This was literally the WORST restaurant experience I've ever had. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Obviously their food is so good and they have a huge menu. BUT.......the service I had tonight was HORRIBLE. I felt like I was being punk'd. CCF is one of the most known restaurants and this is the only one I've had a bad experience at. Usually they have very good/experienced waiters who are on it and I'm wondering if the waiter I had tonight is always like this or if it was just a bad day for him. I was looking around because I literally thought there were cameras or something and we were being pranked.  So my girlfriend, her friend, and I were going to have dinner and my gfs friend has been there plenty of times. She usually never has an issue. Our first waiter came to our table and said ""Hello, I'll be your waiter for the next five minutes."" That was just a weird way to approach customers. Anyways, our second waiter approached us in a nice manner and seemed fine. He took our order and then we asked for more bread. Five minutes later he came back and gave us water and asked if we needed anything else. Once again, we asked for more bread. No complaints. I understand people forget sometimes. Thirty minutes later he brought our food, which is normal, but then brought the bread after. Not a huge deal so whatever.  WHAT REALLY GOT ME is when he asked if we need anything else after we were done eating and we said we'd like to order cheesecake. He asked what kind, we told him what we wanted, and then he said he'll go get it. About ten minutes later he came back and was like ""can I get you guys anything else."" Once again, we told him what type of cc we wanted. He said he'll go get it. He then came five min later AGAIN, and asked what type of cheesecake we wanted because he forgot. At this point, I'm like is he high or just very forgetful. So we told him again. The FOURTH time he came back and said ""we had a mix up in the bakery with some receipts. The receipt machine broke.......so what kind of cheesecake did you want?"" We told him AGAIN. I feel like that was a lie to cover up him forgetting for the fourth time. We just thought it was funny and laughed about it but wasn't too annoyed......yet. Luckily, we weren't in a rush or anything but if this were to happen to anybody else, they would of complained to a manager at this point. I was whatever about it because we had plenty of time so oh well.  Later on, he brought the check and combined all three of our orders, without asking if we'd like so split. So I asked if he could split the check between my girlfriend and I, and her friend. He took the check and left but then about 10 min later, he came back with the same check and acted like nothing was wrong. I was convinced that we were being punk'd at this point. I was so confused, shocked, and annoyed. I waited for him to come back and asked again if we can split the check. He took the check again and brought us two separate checks this time. My total was like $47 and some change so I put two 20s and a ten then handed it to him. He brought back the check and said I owe $12.34!????? I was so frustrated and told him I gave him $50 and he argued with me saying that I didn't pay cash???? So I explained like 5 times that I paid $50 cash and finally he was like ""oh I gave you the wrong ticket."" He then brought back the correct ticket and said sorry about that, have a good night. I will NEVER be going back to this restaurant. Instead of complaining to a manager, I just left a $2 tip. I didn't want to complain and him possibly get fired because I don't know what his situation is or what personal problems he has. Definitely did not expect this to happen at CCF."
Jennifer G.,"La Mirada, CA",350,312,183,4.0,11/15/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner Sunday evening. It looked pretty busy but were actually seated within five minutes of arriving!  The staff is awesome. Our server was quick, efficient, polite. She gave us TWO servings of bread. I know what I'm grateful for this year. Thanks girl. The food is pretty good. However, in typical Cheesecake Factory style, their menu is EXTENSIVE. It will take a hot minute or two to read through it and decide. I ordered my spaghetti and meatballs and my boyfriend chose steak.  My only complaint is how loud it was. Granted, we were squeezed between two larger tables and groups of women obviously catching up with their girlfriends and bff alcohol, so yeah it was gonna be loud. I don't blame the restaurant for their customers lack of manners. However, my boyfriend does wish they served a bigger portion size of steak and mashed potatoes. I didn't even get a bite :( Haha but seriously overall, it was a good place to sit down, eat, and enjoy each other's company."
Danielle T.,"Irvine, CA",36,72,46,5.0,12/31/2017,This Cheesecake location looks perfect!!! They had remodeling last year and the place looks amazing.  The outside is so stylish and perfect for the California warm weather.  The staff is always nice and welcoming and the overall experience is always great at the Cheesecake Factory.
Lucia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",507,231,382,1.0,9/19/2017,"Honestly the worst experience and service that I've gotten at a Cheesecake Factory. I ordered a Vegan Cobb with the dressing on the side + chicken, but it came out dressed with no chicken. It was corrected the second time around, but I felt like they really skimped on the toppings.  In addition, there was pieces of bread and goldfish on the floor which made our dining experience a little unpleasant. I get that it's always busy here, but please take the time to do a quick sweep under the tables if there is food on the floor!  With all that being said, I'd still come back because their brown wheat bread is highly addicting. lol"
Jerry C.,"Irvine, CA",1,8,3,1.0,1/1/2018,"Similar quality as other Cheesecake Factory but poor customer service. If you read other reviews, they will agree. Unfortunately, the meal experience gets ruined when you get poor service. Our waitress was not interested in helping us. Was very cold and short. Was looking at another table's check while taking our water orders, was look around at other tables while taking our meal orders (we had to repeat ourselves), did not refill our waters at all throughout meal, ask if we wanted dessert (even though we had previously inquired about it). I hope management can really change their training or hiring. No food tastes the same when you get that sort of treatment."
Jannell L.,"San Marcos, CA",217,133,202,4.0,9/30/2017,"The cheesecake factory is my favorite restaurant! This particular location isn't exactly my favorite but it is up there. My most recent dinner here was a little atypical since I came around 10:30pm on a Friday night. They usually close at 11pm on other weekdays but Fridays they close at 12:30am so it was okay. We were seated right away and within 5 minutes, our server came. She was very nice and friendly and took our orders and asked if we wanted bread. We said yes and a few minutes later, she came back with bread and butter. However, there was only rye bread instead of the usual sourdough, white, and rye. It was okay though, I think it's just cause we came so late. But then, she also gave us butter but no butter knives. We used our spoons to spread the butter.  Then, she came back and said they were out of the buffalo blasts - once again, our fault for coming so late. So then we ordered the fried cheese (mozzarella sticks). They were shaped like Doritos and tasted wonderful. It came with marinara sauce but the sauce tasted a little to watery and tomato-y.  Our spicy chipotle chicken pasta came and it was delicious as always. When she was taking our order, I asked if they could split it (Which they usually do) but she said that she could just bring an extra plate. I thought it was weird since I've never had the cheesecake factory not split my entree when asked. But it's okay, maybe they just don't do that here. However, she also forgot to ask if we wanted cheese grated on top!  The pasta itself isn't too creamy or spicy, it's a very light hint of spice. It's perfectly savory and the portion is def share worthy. To end the night, we got the tiramisu cheesecake which was delicious. Not too creamy and not top sweet with just enough coffee flavor to balance out the cheesecake."
Sara G.,"Irvine, CA",130,56,65,5.0,1/3/2018,"Who can complain about cheesecake factory? The variety of the menu is great( its too long , sometimes get confusing lol) Love love love the brown bread with butter but sometimes there are stingy about it and you have to ask for more. I ordered chicken Madora it is absolutely delicious.  We also like the burgers , one of the best burgers in town, we asked for avocado and mushroom as well. They don't take reservations and on weekends they're so busy they recently remodeled the patio which is pretty nice."
Jason C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",21,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,"My wife and I went to Cheesecake Factory after a movie. We arrived at 10pm and ordered a salad for dinner. We didn't receive the salad until 10:50pm. They were mixing up all of the orders.  It's too bad. A while back, we used to go to this Cheesecake Factory often. I will not be visiting this location again. The service has fallen off dramatically. I do not recommend that you visit this Cheesecake Factory. There are a lot of other nice restaurants in the area."
Michael G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",244,338,12,4.0,11/7/2017,"As most of you know Cheesecake Factory menus are larger than most Sunday morning newspapers, so later I'll give my top 3 recommendations.  They probably have 50 items over 1500 calories but they've done a good job offering healthy alternatives.  We've at this particular location a few times and one of the highlights is always sitting outside which they have a huge amount of seating. One negative aspect is the wait, although they have a lot of tables many of them are not open for service. This trip today I waited over 30 minutes at 1230 for an outdoor spot - which for a Tuesday in November seems a bit excessive.  My top 3 dishes  1.  Chicken and Business (biscuits) 2. Super antioxidant salad with chicken 3. Meatloaf  Appetizers - avocado egg rolls and factory nachos  Pro Tip - no more calorie counts BEWARE!!!! BUT SkinnyLicious Menu and super food listings - check it! As well as the lunch menus specials.  Try the new birthday cake cheesecake to top it all off.  Great spot in the spectrum and for business meetings.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory"
Cristina S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",196,49,144,3.0,8/3/2017,"Cheesecake has been one of my favorite restaurants since I was young. Ambience is dim lighting with great service. Food is delicious!  Who: Family parties, Date night vibes, friends, kids are OK  What: Cheesecake, Pasta (Farfalle chicken bow tie w/ roasted garlic & Jambalaya), sandwiches, small hot plates  When: Weekend nights expect an hour + wait, lunch time is always better if you're just trying to test it out.  Where: Multiple Locations across Cali roughly 17 different ones, food is pretty consistent amongst most locations! Why: You want some delicious pasta paired with a mouth watering cheesecake, for a good price !"
Lynn B.,"Corona, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/7/2017,"Went to Cheesecake Factory for our Christmas work luncheon on December 6th. A little disappointing. Our reservation was for 1:00.  We did not get seated for 20 minutes. They told me they were busy with take out orders when I asked why we had to wait so long.  The Service was slow and we waited awhile for drinks and bread to be serviced. I understand that near the holidays any place can be busy.  But I noticed several people standing around talking. I would say you are unorganized.  I did not ask my co-workers about their meal.  My meal was not great. The brown rice was hard and not cooked.  The waiter noticed that I did not eat much of my meal, he asked if I did not like it. I told him about the meal.  He said oh we like to know these things I will tell the cook so we can improve. That was all that was said.  There were 12 in our party and I am sure my boss gave a generous tip.  Very disappointed to say the least. Next time will select another restaurant. You really have plenty of room for improvement."
Todd R.,"Lake Forest, CA",22,200,280,2.0,10/21/2017,"So our group had decided to all try something different, meaning other than the usual meal we've had in the past.  I picked the chicken and biscuits,  maybe I shouldn't have.    The chicken tasted like it was cooked in hot water, would it be too much to ask for it to be grilled. The mashed potatoes were not has hot as they should be, the gravy was okay, but the real sin was the biscuits.  For a restaurant of this size I expect freshly made biscuits. These were something you would get at McDonald's. Hard little hockey pucks, just terrible biscuits.  Staff was attentive, but if you know something is good at Cheesecake Factory. Stick with it. Don't switch."
Maheen K.,"Irvine, CA",46,70,159,3.0,7/11/2017,"We were seated quickly but then there wasn't too much traffic on a Monday night. The service was super slow. Our drink orders were put in quickly. I received my virgin pina colada and it was the best part of my meal.  I ordered the Miso Salmon with brown rice and my husband ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with brown rice.  We were a party of nine (7 adults and 2 kids). The waitress asked if we wanted the kids mac and cheese first so that came out with the complimentary bread. The rest of the food took close to 45 minutes. We basically filled up on the bread and butter and our drinks.  The salmon was pretty dry. The miso sauce was good so combining that with the rice, I was able to eat half of my meal. My husband's dish was pretty average tasting. Black beans had a weird after taste.  Go here if you are in no hurry to eat. If you have any plans afterwards, I would suggest going elsewhere."
Kathy G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",216,130,478,4.0,12/23/2017,I had both snacks and cheesecake here with a friend! We had salted caramel cheesecake and some fries! It was a great experience for both of us! The salted caramel cheesecake was delicious just like the other ones.
Todd B.,"La Habra, CA",0,127,18,5.0,12/21/2017,"Happy Hour! Prior to a movie at the Irvine Spectrum, my party and I stopped in for a happy hour bite and drink. It did not disappoint. The menu options were ample and the portions very good. The waitress was great. We will return.  I had the burger and a glass of wine. My partner had a spinach dip and we tried the guacamole, all were good."
Jasmine C.,"San Diego, CA",481,190,734,2.0,5/18/2017,"I feel like which ever location you decide to go to, the food will taste the same anywhere!  This location has really slow service though. There wasn't any wait, we got seated right away. It wasn't even that busy for a Wednesday night. After being seated our waitress didn't come over until 10 minutes later and she took a long time to give us and refill our waters.  My advice is to decide what you want to order ahead of time to make things quicker."
Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213,1.0,11/19/2017,"I really can't think of a worse dining experience I've had in a very long time I made the mistake of coming here with some friends for my birthday dinner.  We got seated fairly quickly and then everything just went downhill. The server came over and asked for our drink order.  Either a long night or just her, but man she was not friendly to deal with.  She was very rushed and gave us the feeling that we were slowing her down by not knowing exactly what we wanted to drink after 30 seconds of sitting down.  It wasn't busy, so I still don't understand the rush.    After hastily giving our drink orders, she returned to take our dinner orders. I asked her a question about a burger because I wanted to make sure I was getting what I wanted.  Don't worry - that piece of information will come back into play later. After awhile the food came and this is where it got really bad.  First, the orders came individually and at slow intervals.  Someone got their plate of food and then a few minutes later someone else got their order and so on.  After about 10 minutes, we all had our food.  Mine was last and it was wrong.  It came with some items on it I definitely didn't want (which is why I asked about it during ordering).  The guy who brought the food took it back to fix it.  When the waitress returned she said, ""earlier you challenged me on what came on your burger and I was wrong, so we're getting that taken care of for you.""  What an odd way to phrase that.  I challenged her?  It's called asking a question.  That somewhat passive aggressive statement really defined her service all night. Someone else at the table ordered baked potato soup and after one spoonful almost spit it out.  She said there was something clearly wrong with it, but couldn't figure out what it was.  We were all just curious at that point and took tastes and it was definitely very odd/gross tasting.  Almost like baked potato soup got mixed with clam chowder and rotten onions.  We sent that back of course.  But she didn't want anything else - the taste really killed it for her. My burger finally returned, but of course with another issue. I like my burgers cooked a bit more and ordered it medium well.  It wasn't.  It was medium rare - very undercooked.  I think they remade it and then rushed it. I hate undercooked ground beef.  I ate around the edges was done.  Didn't want to deal with it anymore.  And on top of all that, several other severs would stop by our table wanting to drop off food that we didn't order.  ""Who had the spaghetti?""  ""Not us"".  That happened with different items like 5 times during the evening.  I just wanted to leave.  I was done.  An odd terrible dining ""experience"". Why is this a big deal?  Not just because it was my birthday, but more importantly, we had a group of friends together that don't get to see each other that often and we just wanted to enjoy a meal together.  And  this restaurant wouldn't let us have a nice meal together.  We got a rushed passive aggressive server, staggered orders so we couldn't even eat as a group, gross food that tasted very troubling, and incorrect orders.  Now, I'm sure Cheesecake factory will respond to this review with the same somewhat generic response they've responded to ALL the negative reviews... and if you look there are a lot of them.  They'll apologize, say that they hope we return and give them another chance (can't wait for that - and plus, why the hell would I want to?), they'll very subtly shift blame and tell you that you should have let a manager know, and say they'll say they'll talk and address this with the team.  But that's all nonsense.  Look at all the negative reviews... if this place actually addressed the issues here like they say, why would it still be such a disaster?  Nothing will be done.  Cheap PR on Yelp to save face a bit. We wasted money and time here and hopefully this review will help you avoid doing the same."
Laurence S.,"Santa Ana, CA",129,2,,1.0,11/25/2017,Had coffee and desert with three friends last night and I witnessed a food handler /server leave the guest bathroom without washing his hands. Me and my buddy were so shocked we made a comment and he came back and said he was just fixing his apron. We asked for the manager and voiced our concern about this incident.  This is a reason I will never come back to this location or any other cheesecake factory location!!! Date of incident 11/24/2017 around 11 pm.
Michelle R.,"Del Mar, CA",327,78,226,4.0,1/1/2018,"Came in for lunch on New Years Eve and we got seated within 5 minutes. There was 7 of us and a baby. First off, our server, Ashley was amazing. Very sweet and on it. Our food was brought out at the same time. Everything was how we ordered it and delicious. I wish I took pictures of our food but I was a little busy with all the kids. I had brought my own avocado for my hungry baby and when I cut it open it was bad. Ashley didn't hesitate and right away said I will bring out a fresh avocado.  I didn't even have to ask.  Three of us had the burgers which we all finished and enjoyed. One salad, a kids corn dogs, a kid pasta and one half turkey and soup. I enjoyed my burger. It was so filling I couldn't finish it as hard as I tried. I don't eat them often so it was a real treat for me.  I don't live near, but will I be back? Absolutely and hopefully I get Ashley again!"
Jordan W.,"Irvine, CA",90,200,79,2.0,8/30/2017,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and got seated right away in a booth near the window. I love Cheesecake Factory as I often crave their Pasta Carbonara since it's comforting that I know how it will taste every single time.  The service at this location was quite slow. The floor under the table still had remnants of big pieces of bread and goldfish scattered amongst other food all over from the party before. My friend ordered the vegan cobb salad with dressing on the side and added chicken. The first time they brought it out, there was no chicken, and the salad was already dressed.  The carbonara was pretty average but I feel like it was a little saltier than normal and not as creamy as other locations. Some of the pasta was burnt together like it had been stuck to the bottom of the pan too long when being sauteed in the sauce.  Overall, I am not sure if I would come back to this specific location as the wait time to order was long, the food prepared wasn't up to par with other locations, and also not as clean as other locations."
Oankar A.,"Reading, PA",41,45,45,4.0,8/15/2017,"We visited them last christmas. Cheesecakes here are amazingly delicious!  we tried the godiva cheesecake and liked it so got another one as to-go! Staff is nice, courteous  and is constantly checking-up for any assistance. Parking can be a issue sometimes but still its definately a worth to try."
Arlee B.,"Portland, OR",4,33,2,1.0,12/17/2017,"Hey yelp, can you please allow us to give zero stars?  This was the worst experience ever! We were told 1-1.5 hrs and 3 hours later we were still not seated. 1.5 hours in they made us close our tab at the bar because, ""we were going to be seated soon"". Then it took us 30 minutes to get a tab opened again. At that point they offered us appetizers and it took 45 minutes. They were rude the entire time and were barely apologetic!!  At the 3 hour mark we walked out with our appetizers thank you very much!  We are a group of business leaders that specialize in customer service and this entire experience made us cringe.  Get your shit together, Cheesecake Factory!"
MadaCy S.,"Riverside, CA",0,33,14,1.0,12/17/2017,"We understood we were a large party and we're okay with the wait.  However, when you tell us it's going to be an hour wait, and an hour turns into 2.5 hours, that's when patience is out the window.  Spoke to the manager who seemed not to care about the fact that we had waited and, in fact, had a pregnant woman in our party that had been waiting to eat.  First and last time coming back to this location again!!"
Archie S.,"Lake Forest, CA",613,452,508,4.0,3/12/2017,This is probably the first Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to almost 18 years ago. Somehow it still is in great shape at the Irvine spectrum. I always sit in the bar area since there's usually not much of a wait because this place can get pretty packed with the wait time sometimes over and hour.  The location is very clean and service is standard and consistent with all the other locations. I tried their chicken and shrimp pineapple curry (I think that's the name) out of the new featured items. It was tasty! You get to pick white or brown rice with it. The chicken and shrimp were crispy and flavorful and the peas really gave it a nice texture. I followed the entree with a slice of mango key lime pie and it was just what I needed to be fully satisfied.
Kaadu M.,"Irvine, CA",5,398,13,3.0,12/28/2017,I don't really mind this place but it's nothing special! If you feel like having cheesecake then yes it's a great place! But I will pass on the food... We might come back...but not promising anything!
Dallas T.,"Mississauga, Canada",106,15,1,5.0,1/1/2018,I know it is not healthy and the whole point of it is getting to the cake! But this place is super dependable and the food is so good! We had the super professional and very nice Jeffery. There are lots of great places to eat in spectrum but this was great for our afternoon family lunch. My Chinese grandma and the vegetarian all found great options and Jefferey really took care of everything! Cool guy! Exactly what we like!

Edgar S.,"La Puente, CA",17,62,,4.0,12/2/2017,"Came here last month with my partner before we went to see a movie. We were just a party of two and were seated very quickly. Our server that evening (didn't catch his name) was excellent. Never had my glass of water go empty, he was always attentive if we needed something. Our food came in quickly, maybe 10 minutes after ordering. The section where we stayed at was a bit dark; granted it was near the bar area but still. They lit a candle at our table half way through the evening, but still it was dark though. That cheesecake though, oh it is to die far! Couldn't resist ordering it, and oh it is worth every bite. Overall had a pleasant experience and would come back here again if I'm ever back at the Irvine Spectrum."
Ryan H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",704,247,516,3.0,4/4/2017,"Came in for a late dinner around 8:40pm Service started a little slow, but it got a lot better once we ordered. We got the avocado egg roll, margarita pizza, and Godiva Cheesecake. Avocado egg rolls are freaking amazing!! The creamy avocado contrasts well with the crispy wrapping. The sweet sauce it comes with makes it even better! 5/5. Margarita pizza was terrible 1/5. Tasted like a cheesy bread. The cheese was chewy, sauce nonexistent-barely any. No tomatoes on the pizza. Only positive was the crust had a nice crust. Godiva cheesecake was not for me 3/5. It is extremely rich and the chocolate all blends together. Couldn't really taste the distinction between the mouse, cheesecake, and chocolate cake layers. There was only a texture difference. If you love chocolate and I mean LOVE chocolate this is probably for you...I guess I don't love chocolate as much as I thought I did."

Thi N.,"Garden Grove, CA",92,150,339,3.0,8/6/2017,"Used to eat at The Cheesecake Factory at Anaheim, the only different here is the wait is less longer! What we order: - Filet Mignon Steak x3  - Hibachi Steak x1 - Diane Steak x1 - Fried Macaroni & Cheese x1 - Strawberry Smoothie x1 Good + Service is nice and attentive + Nice ambience and very beautiful seating where we could actually watch the shopping center and people walking on the street + Nice patio area + Very yummy fruit smoothie + Good portion for the price Bad  + I order a medium rare and they give me a 90% rare steak, good side is the meat is tender, bad side is it's tender in an undercooked way + Flies + Utensils were not washed thoroughly so there's still vegetables stick on it + Sauce on Hibachi and Diane steak was too sweet + Not a fan of fried macaroni & cheese"
Maria C.,"Irvine, CA",16,7,1,3.0,10/10/2017,"The food is very blend,like in school canteen. Nothing tasty,just to fill your stomach. Thus dont understand the price range. Did not finish my meal and I was hungry."
J A.,"Orange County, CA",191,336,32,3.0,9/24/2017,"This review is for the day I went in to order Take Out. I went in, ordered my food by the Cheesecake section (that's where you order take out). The front area vibe was ok. Not too bad. I ordered my favorite on the Menu, which was the Orange Chicken Special. I did wait about 30 minutes to get my food (which was a little bummer since I could not finish the meal prior to entering work nearby). The only complaint I have is the parking. It is so difficult to find parking and it is quite a distance from my work to walk. The take out parking, where they bring the food out to you, always has vehicles or food trucks parked there. So I have refrained from ordering ahead as this can be an issue. But overall, the food is great. I love the Cheesecake Factory."
Abigail K.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",0,5,,4.0,12/24/2017,"Love this place as some of the employees have been there for over a decade. Lana, Terri, Johnny and the rest of the bar staff are some of the best in the Irvine Spectrum. Like visiting them"
Ting Ting W.,"Irvine, CA",200,136,86,4.0,10/22/2017,"My boyfriend and I love coming here. It's right across the street from where we live and they have such an extensive menu so there's always something you might be craving for. I love their new patio, it's a great addition to the restaurant that they didn't have for years. I love sitting outside, it's spacious and has a great atmosphere.  My favorite dish to get here is their pasta davinci. It's so good and addicting. Love the penne pasta with chicken and mushroom in that Marsala sauce.  I also really like their strawberry Martinis that they make with fresh puréed strawberries.  Don't forget a slice of cheesecake at the end. It's nice that they don't make their cheesecakes too sweet either. Delish!!!"
Cam C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",520,579,974,4.0,11/13/2016,"Let's be real, all Cheesecake Factories are essentially the same. Crazy big place with a massive menu, and delicious complimentary bread and butter. So my review is based solely on service and wait time and I had no complaints. We were seated as soon as our entire party arrived, waiter was outgoing and friendly, and our bread/water was constantly refilled. Food itself was good, as usual. It's kind of loud in there, but you're there for the gigantic portions and cheesecake, not the ambiance."
Doug M.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/23/2017,"We have had very positive experiences at other The Cheesecake Factory locations.  However, this time at the Spectrum location, it was the worst restaurant food and service ever.  As a party of eight , they forgot to bring us our appetizers and wine; then after a long wait, four of our entrees were cold and totally under cooked.  Once they redid the meals, it was not prepared the usual way - tasted poorly. Besides that it was so noisy, we could not hear one another across the table.  Something needs to change there - horrible restaurant experience."
