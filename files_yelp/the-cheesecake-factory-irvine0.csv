J G.,"Orange, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/10/2017,"I went in there for my order that was placed at 10:50pm, I arrived at 11:30 pm and it was a fettuccine alfredo. The manager refused to release the order to me. His reason is that ""fettuccine alfredo is hazardous to the customers health after an hour."" This is false and completely made up, as most food starts spoiling 4-6 hours after it has reached room temperature. This manager is a total idiot and should be fired. He does not understand basic customer service or basic science. He handled the situation extremely poorly stating a question to me ""are you a doctor?"" Although I am pursuing my PhD, that was completely uncalled for and extremely rude. Not only that, if the order was placed at 10:50 pm, and let's say it takes 10 minutes to make the fettuccine, then it would be done by 11:00pm. I got there at 11:30pm, which means it's been sitting there for 30 minutes not 1 hour like the manager claimed. So he is also a liar. Lying and insulting people are terrible qualities for your manager to have. Customers avoid this place if this dishonest and rude manager is working here. This was at the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum. His name is Roy."
Annie H.,"Orange County, CA",274,184,77,3.0,9/2/2014,"More of a 3.5! Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite ""date night"" places to go eat. Because it is conveniently located at the Spectrum (it's located more near the movie theatre side), I usually come here after shopping. But, because it is located at the Spectrum, do not be surprised if there's a wait for a table. You usually have to wait a good 20 minutes during dining hours. The service is fast and friendly, but might be subpar if your server is super busy.  I always get the Chicken Bellagio which is my favorite dish to get at any Cheesecake Factory, but when I get it here it's really a hit or miss. Sometimes it tastes great and everything is perfect, but sometimes it's too greasy or salty.  One of my all time favorite things is the brown bread here, and I always try to ask for more.  The seating here is roomy, pretty private, and clean. Pretty much the standard for Cheesecake factory! Because this is one of the pricer dining places, I wish they would provide better service, or something that will make you feel special."
Sherif K.,"Irvine, CA",53,1,,1.0,10/23/2016,"We were part of a group of 12 families, in total like 30 persons celebrating one of our friends birthday. Me and another friend stayed till the end and our check was the last, they claimed that there is still $20 left over on the table (the total orders for the group was more than $700) and after some discussion, they called their hero ""SHAWN"", he is supposed to be the manager of the place simply, I do not how did he was chosen and I do not wanna know but clearly he is totally away of any customer service. The guy is very nervous and aggressive. The worst part ever, even to Cheese Cake Factory management that this Shawn was threatening us that he has all group credit card details on the system and he is gonna use any credit card to cover this $20 balance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is very funny, is not it ? He is threatening to make a credit card fraud !!!!!!!!!!!!!  Watch out your credit cards guys when you go there.. Simply I need to receive a reply from Cheese Cake Factory management if you guys really care .."
h t.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,12,3,4.0,3/4/2017,"Good lunch menu. There was no wait time since we did the reservation ahead. It was a quiet afternoon. I ordered the shiitake steak, it was really good."
Ry D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",108,22,64,1.0,12/9/2016,"The women's bathroom was so disgusting, there was urine everywhere and no toilet paper. When I spoke with the manager Wesley his response was there was other restrooms. For the price they charge for food I would expect better service. Will not be coming back."
Shima M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,18,1,2.0,3/18/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory !!! The food is amazing !!!  But last night I had a terrible experience at this location !!! I ordered food for pick up !! when I went to pick up my food , I asked the person to provide some bread for us, but she rudely said we don't have it !!! How is that possible ? So if we were going to dine there, they weren't going to give us bread ? Highly unlikely !!! This location have the worst customer service !!! I paid a good amount of money for our food and they can't even provide me with some bread ?  The only reason I even wanted bread was for my cousin who is visiting here internationally , I wanted him to try it !!! But I guess I asked for too much !!!  I doubt I'll be going to this location again !!!"
Ava A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",642,116,157,4.0,6/7/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is a great dinner option when we are at the spectrum. The menu has EVERY genre of food on it, and some genres that I think are unique to The company it's self! My recommendation is to order the buffalo blasts. These can definitely be ordered as an entree for one person, or a large appetizer to be shared between two or more people. Shredded chicken, buffalo sauce, and cheese are wrapped in some sort of phyllo dough and deep fried-- so good! My favorite cheesecake there is a the peanut butter chocolate. I also enjoy the shepherd's pie!"
Terri K.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",0,70,51,2.0,3/15/2017,"Went there last night for dinner because I had a gift certificate. We hadn't been in a couple years & were disappointed. At first I was happy that they had a big ""skinnylicious"" menu for me as well as the standard items for my husband. He ordered the stuffed mushrooms appetizer & the iron pan they were served them in was hot, the mushrooms just barely warm. We've had much better.  We finished the appetizer & our entrees arrived before my drink, a skinny cosmo. The cosmo was tasty but not my garlic lemon shrimp. It was so bland & boring, I added a lot of salt & pepper. I asked to substitute broccoli for the noodles. Basically a huge head of broccoli was on the plate not cut up into florets. On to the low carb cheesecake for dessert which was great. The only reason to go to this restaurant is for the cheesecake. Maybe they've fallen victim to way too many items on the entree menu & they  taste microwaved, even my husbands chicken dish. Dessert yes, dinner definitely no with so many other awesome restaurants right there."
Amin S.,"Oak Creek, Irvine, CA",14,4,1,4.0,8/13/2017,"Great food! Love the steaks!! Good service, but since they are always crowded they delay on the orders- happened to me alot"
Ashley S.,"Glendora, CA",325,3,,5.0,3/9/2017,"Valerya and her service was almost as perfect as those bangin bangs of hers! Food 10/10 as always. The wait for the food 6/10. Overall, we are satisfied and leaving happy and buzzed! Cheers"
Chanel V.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/19/2017,Today is Sunday funday! Not at cheesecake factory with Terry! I'm not one to complain as everyone has a down day...so I went shopping and my bf stayed & left her $20.00 tip to brighten her day....she asked my bf where her tip was as he was leaving he said he left on bar with tab ...He then met up with me ...Then She saw us I guess from her bar as walking bye  and she came outside of the restaurant from a side door and aggressively approach us and asked my bf where was her tip??! I was shocked and thought quite rude as we always tip no matter how service is ...We also eat at that location frequently! It was awkward and I even spoke to the manager hours after due to the fact it was disrespectful... He acknowledged....But not what I expected..    .. .  Won't be spending my time there again ....As we use too.....
Patrick M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",10,2,,1.0,8/9/2017,"I love the food here but the problem is your server! Very rude and unprofessional. Me and my 2 friends did eat here yesterday excellent service at first with our female server, but when the guy server brings out our food, he just drop the plate in front of me (like he didn't care) and the sauce of Madeira chicken came flying into my shirt. The stain in my shirt is now permanent very disappointed!"
J. H.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,69,14,2.0,7/4/2016,"This is a very subpar Cheesecake location. The food is absolutely horribly prepared.  I fear coming to this location because the food is not predictable and usually really bad.  The chefs here really cannot cook properly.  Sometimes its hit or miss but mostly its a miss.  Its consistently bad compared to other locations. For example, all the chicken dishes are hot and fried and it seems they try, but the overal execution is terrible Compared to other locations.  Too salty,  too much cheese,  Too watery, etc.   There are just always problems.  The chicken romano and chicken dipana are terribly prepared every single time.  They should be embarrassed for how bad it is every single time.   Just to be clear, they try but i think its because most of the chefs at Irvine cant cook that well and have to crank out too many dishes with no line chef making sure the food looks proper to send out. Now much of the staff is very nice and kind and attentive.   I cannot fault the wait staff or reception staff as usually they are very nice and kind. Today We waited over 5 minutes to order an entire cheesecake to go at the entrance and were totally ignored even when an employee came over to prepare desserts.  Unfortunate.  Usually they are really nice and helpful with a smile.  Maybe understaffed for July 4th. In the end,  the food is horribly prepared here compared to other locations and doesnt taste right."
Giannina A.,"Fontana, CA",10,13,1,1.0,5/4/2017,do not order the bistro shrimp pasta. totally got food poisoning. never ever coming back to cheesecake factory!
Janet L.,"Orange, CA",175,61,92,1.0,6/19/2015,"I love chain American food. You name it I love it. Cpk, chilis, Applebee's, tgif etc etc.... The one star is not for the food at Cheesecake Factory. It is for the service that was provided to my companions and I. I was ready for an amazing meal with the amazing service I have come to know and love from this establishment. However, Elizabeth has ruined it all. My companions and I ordered avocado egg rolls to start with. They were okay but I didn't expect much from them. However, how is it that the appetizer comes out before our beverages?  Thank god the kind bartender or runner brought me my pineapple Moscow mule or I feel like I would've been waiting forever. The Alcoholic drink was NOT what I expected. The entire ginger beer taste was non existent and what it came in was NOT a copper mug. Since when is that acceptable? Elizabeth failed to check on us & went to every other table she had besides us. My companions and I are servers. We know how it can be but how is it excusable to go to every other table but ours just bcus we look young and Asian?!  The pasta we had was not great and we could tell it had just sat at the window instead of being brought out.  She finally checked on us, made sure we were okay, but then disappeared again until we had to call for our check while she tried to scurry past us. This experience has made me feel certain that the only place I will get excellent service anywhere is at the bar and not with magician servers like her. Thank you Elizabeth for making me feel small and a complete bother to your day."
Roman W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",71,6,3,5.0,3/2/2017,"Amazing atmosphere and service everyone was exceptionally nice. My girlfriend and I had ultimate margaritas and they are not skimpy on the alcohol! Made perfectly! The dinner was amazing, steak cooked to perfection, and pasta to die for."
Yuliana W.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",37,29,69,2.0,1/7/2017,"I give 2 star just because the food was good, otherwise I will only give 1 , the service was very bad..I went to this place on new year day to celebrated my friend birthday. The food came very long maybe 45mnts..even when we wanna ordered the food, the server came too long, and we asked for birthday treat, they even came very long and the ice cream melted already.. I was going to order dessert..but since everything was too long, we were kind a upset with it..so I don't ordered the dessert at dine in, instead I went to the front to buy my dessert for to go"
Matt K.,"Irvine, CA",12,261,416,4.0,8/9/2015,"I had a good experience here coming for lunch during the work-week.  I was surprised at how fast and easy it was to eat here for lunch.  I've been to Cheesecake Factory and usually for dinner so I know it can get busy/crowded. They do a nice job of advertising their lunch menu which gives you smaller portion options and helps you narrow down your list of choices.  As you may know, The Cheesecake Factory menu is long and extensive, which is good for variety and fun to come for dinner with groups.... but for lunch you want something a little more simplified and they do just that with their Lunch menu.   I had the cup of soup, sandwich, and salad option. First of all, I was surprised that I was able to get all 3.  Normally other restaurants provide you with a soup + sandwich or a salad + sandwich.  At The Cheesecake Factory, you get all 3.  Even though it's a lunch option, they don't skimp out on the usual Cheesecake Factory portions.  There was more than enough food for me.   I liked the caesar salad I had and the chicken almond salad sandwich.  The soup was ok, I think it was chicken tortilla but was thicker than I'm used to and I think it felt like there was rice in it and not the crunchy tortilla.  Maybe it was a different soup.  Still, I enjoyed the meal, the portions, service, and price was fair.  I would come again."
Silvia G.,"Orange County, CA",635,672,3264,3.0,6/9/2014,"To avoid the crowds and the waiting, hubby and I decided to have a late dinner after a movie, around 10ish on a Sat night. This was a good decision since we were seated just minutes later and received good service even though the restaurant was still pretty full. We sat in a booth facing the outdoor patio and it was nice to see all the lights from the mall and the movie theater. I ordered the garlic noodles and hubby the Chicken quesadillas. My noodle plate was pretty large, with lots of noodles, but not quite as much chicken and veggies. The noodles were VERY salty, I couldn't had more than a few bites. I told the waitress and she graciously offered to bring me another one or to exchange it. So I opted for the Chicken Da Vinci. By the time the second dish arrived, I was tired so I took a few bites (it was a little too al dente for me but flavor was fine) and asked to take it to go.   The following day I heated up at home and sure enough, the pasta was hard. I eat leftovers all the time and don't have that problem but probably the noodles were a little undercooked.  The quesadillas were fine so next time I go, ill probably just skip the pasta and try something else."
Sam S.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/16/2017,"I was with a party of 8, I went to check wait times and I was told that it was immediate, no waiting at all for inside seating. So I asked to reserve the table and I was informed that I need a minimum of four to be present I indicated that my family is right outside I will get them and come back I go outside get my family and come back to say I am here and they told me you have to wait for a manager. The manager comes to greet me and asks if I wanted an outside table instead. And I said no I want a table inside per my original request then he tells me the wait is 1 full hour and I was like I was just informed there was no wait went outside to get my family made the arrangements with the rest of my party.. Poor coordination, poor information and overall poor customer service."
