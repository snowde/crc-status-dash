Zach W.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",125,43,28,4.0,2/25/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is really good.   The wait time can be long, especially on the weekend and we waited over an hour for our table.   The food was great and there is something for everyone as the menu is huge.   I ordered the Pit Beef Sandwich and was not disappointed.  Very tasty sandwich.  I did get a piece of cheesecake with fresh strawberries and it was delicious."
Tiffany B.,"Tustin, CA",0,6,4,1.0,7/23/2017,"Manager is the worst. He was so rude to me. I called to get a table for a 10 year olds dinner with friends and he told me to call another restaurant. I will never go here again. So unacomadating.   Then asked if I was done so he could get off the phone.  Total jerk. No wonder they have bad reviews. They are so rude and I will never eat at this establishment again.  If you have a large party and don't want to wait over an hour definitely go somewhere else. Another reason to support small businesses, they treat their patrons with respect and don't have BS policies."
Gaby C.,"Tustin, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/26/2017,"My family and I came here for dinner since I had a gift card... and we were quite disappointed. The service was fine. We have no complaints about the service. The food however is another story. By no means were we expecting a fine dining experience. But no matter where you go or how much you spend one expects the food to be decent. For appetizers we ordered calamari. I ordered the pasta carbonara. My daughter ordered the pasta Alfredo. My husband ordered pepperoni pizza. All of these are pretty standard dishes. All of these except the pasta Alfredo were salty. The calamari was salty, greasy, and soggy. The pasta carbonara and the pizza were both salty. The chefs tonight must love salt! I will say that the pasta in both pasta dishes was cooked perfectly. But that goes out the window when the entire dish is salty. I had to keep eating off of my daughter's plate because her dinner wasn't salty. I could actually taste the food unlike my dinner. I brought my leftovers home and whipped up my own sauce for the pasta and now I can enjoy it for tomorrow's lunch. The food was just not worth the money. I'm only giving 2 stars because the waiter was nice and the bread was good."
Trina D.,"Orange County, CA",808,2005,7075,3.0,11/20/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory.  It has a large menu that will accommodate any picky eater.  This time around, we were celebrating a coworker and decided on dinner here before drinks elsewhere.  I arrived a little late but they were still able to seat the rest of my party without any hesitation.  I ordered a bourbon & honey cocktail to start and then the steak Diane & salmon combination.  If you're having problems deciding, this is the perfect plate for you to get two entrees in one.  The salmon and steak are plated side-by-side with a large helping of mashed potatoes down the middle.  It was pretty good.   The food is good for what it is but you're really there for the long list of cheesecake!  I've tried many different types of cheesecake over the years and some of my favorites are: red velvet, banana cream, caramel turtle, Godiva, Oreo cookies & cream, pumpkin, and lemon raspberry.  This time I went with the lemon raspberry.  It's slightly tart and cuts through the richness of the cheesecake.  There's also a layer of cake too so it's less dense than say the regular cheesecake.  I've been to Cheesecake Factory countless times, but I wish that they had a happy hour.  There's usually a wait at this Irvine Spectrum location but you can always make reservations. 3.5 stars."
Dayana Z.,"Santa Ana, CA",150,4,,1.0,6/10/2017,I love cheesecake factory but this one is too crazy packed that they appearantly can forget to get you a waitress and also forget to bring your buns....oh yeahh and also take 3 hours to dine there... The only good experience out of this was the nice people that served us and also the kobe burger was delsciousio
Hamed S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",7,7,4,1.0,4/13/2017,"Dirty dishes, I had to ask for clean utensils twice (piece of lettuce was on my spoon and knife). And food was frozen"
Breahna Y.,"Moorpark, CA",1,10,14,5.0,5/24/2017,"Go here for happy hour the drinks are 5.95 $ and really good(I love the margarita). The appetizers are so inexpensive compared to the normal prices this is the time to go! In the picture are the nachos, lodged tator tots and fried mac and cheese balls. My all time favorites are the nachos, buffalo blasts,and cuban egg rolls. The spinach dip quality as well as the white bread has decreased over the years. Anyway, if you love Cheesecake start going to happy hour to save your pennies."
Ms. C's Third Grade C.,"Irvine, CA",0,26,,5.0,5/24/2017,This is the three things about the Cheesecake Factory. The food is really delicious there. My favorite is the spaghetti with Marinara sauce on it and it is really good on the spaghetti it also has cheese on it that's so delicious. My other favorite is the mini corn dogs I can pick my own side and drink to go with it to. You can also pick other things to go with it you can even pick fries with it to.  I really love the different kinds of cakes there and I think you can get stuffed animals to. My favorite is the banana cake in the front of the restaurant. At the cheesecake factory you can eat the dessert at the restaurant or you can take it home.  The seating is very comfortable. and pretty there. The design is very beautiful there. On the couch chairs there is a bit of gold in it.   These are the things that I think is the best about the cheesecake factory.  -M
T W.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,47,14,1.0,9/22/2017,So was here last night picking up and online order and the girl who was checking out was such an ass.  Never experienced such an rude human being in a restaurant before. I think her name was Stephanie. This place is the worst. One time this location used my card to pay for someone elses bill and didn't tell me i had to find out after i left when my bank called me. Then i went back in and thats when they confessed. Poor customer service all around. The lady last night told me to sign but didn't give me a pen and when asked she was like it right there. Well you hand it to me bitch. Then she took 10 minutes sitting there before she went back to get my order. Wouldn't want this troll working in my establishment treating paying customers like crap. No tip was left last night. Beware of this troll.
Matthew J.,"Irvine, CA",308,80,154,5.0,7/20/2016,"I love this Cheesecake factory, especially now that they built that kickass patio. They have a huge menu, my favorites are: The Monte Carlo (breakfast) and the CA Cheesesteak (lunch, dinner, or breakfast...?).  They are both bomb. They have an awesome drink menu and obviously bomb Cheesecake. While all of the other spots in the Spectrum are jammed packed, do yourself a favor and grab a seat on their new patio and hangout. You won't regret it! Highly recommend!"
Daisy U.,"San Clemente, CA",29,22,1,5.0,7/24/2017,"I've been coming to this location for a couple of years and service has always been a 3 . Regardless I continue to come here because I like the food. Yesterday, someone who really stood out was our server, Christian. He was very attentive and made sure we had refills and extra bread as soon as we were low. The food was as always, delicious  We were sat in a two top outside the patio. The food came out in a timely matter."
Ashok J.,"Tustin, CA",19,302,35,4.0,1/3/2017,We came during happy hour and got seats only at the outside bar. We had only tapas and all were good. Nice atmosphere and good service. Standard cheesecake factory food with good presentation. Happy hour menu is the best value for money here.
Terri G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/10/2017,"Normally everything is so great at Cheesecake Factory's in general; but this was not a good experience.  We had 9 people/2 birthdays/$275.00 bill; and iffy service. All the food came out except for mine (host); when it did come out, it was the wrong dish.  When the right dish came out it wasn't prepared properly, had to send it back.  By the time the new dish came out, everyone else was finished...I ate some.  It was not great (rigatoni with shrimp and sausage) -- shrimp was overcooked...whole dish was blah.  I took most of it home since the other 8 people were done with their food by then and wanted to move onto cheesecake. We celebrated the 2 birthdays with 5 pieces of cheesecake and when I went to pay the bill, there was absolutely no consideration for the mistakes.  Kind of surprising considering it was the restaurants fault...and most places will cut you some slack and not charge you for your meal or throw in a dessert or something.  How disappointing..."
Zahid H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",4,30,41,1.0,6/22/2016,"Cheesecake Factories are hit or miss, unfortunately this was a miss.  Experience started of good, wait was only 5 mins.  Unfortunately that's where the good service ended.  Ordered meals for the kids plus our meal.  No exaggeration, we waited 45 mins for our meals.  Our 5 year old ended up falling asleep after bugging about when he'll get his meal. Granted, it's not the most kid friendly restaurant and they don't pretend to be but 45 mins waiting for corn dogs??? Eventually our food came, but we still had to wait another 5 mins for the little ones to get their meals.  Not once did any of the servers keep us updated or check in on us.  Not once throughout the whole meal were our drinks refilled.  Our server was so concerned about waiting on the party of 8 probably because of the gratuity that he didn't care about a table of four.  We had to ask three different servers for an extra plate.  Maybe instead of being photographers for customers they should prioritize what they got hired for...SERVE THE CUSTOMERS!!!  I'm not trying to be insulting to servers at a restaurant and I know it's not a dream job but you get hired to do a job that you applied for and you went out of your way to impress at the interview.  So take that enthusiasm they you showed when you applied for that job and serve all your customers in the same manner. I gave one star because the food was good.  That's one thing that is consistent with Cheesecake Factory, the food is really good.  The service though is atrocious.  So many restaurants at the Spectrum, avoid this at all costs!!!"
Lucas H.,"Irvine, CA",262,16,2,4.0,3/24/2017,Came here on a Wednesday night after watching beauty and the beast with my   was pretty empty so we got seated pretty quick. Took about 10 minutes to go over the menu and decide that we wanted the chicken chipotle pasta and the spaghetti and meatballs. Portions were pretty big and the food was delicious. Inside decor is pretty nice and waitress always checked up on us. Overall great experience would come back again.
Michael K.,"Norco, CA",8,8,1,5.0,8/20/2017,Morgan was super helpful and was on top of everything!! The food was perfect and the cheese cake was absolutely amazing!!
Leslie S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",675,535,469,2.0,9/16/2015,"Wow, what a disappointment! Never have I waited so long for a lunch meal! It's called a lunch break...it's not unlimited! 2 out of 4 of us were late to work. Thankfully it was my day off, otherwise I would have had to leave before I got my food. The only reason why they get more than 1 star was the food was good. Better than 1 star but nothing special. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a 'small plate' from the Skinny Menu. I ordered the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps and they were pretty good! Lots of teriyaki sauce tho so I used the little rice noodles to soak that up in the wrap. Oh, and their small plate was a perfect lunch portion, and it was only 8 bucks! My husband ordered a cheeseburger and they said 'classic' or 'old fashioned.' We asked the difference and the waiter made him read the description on the menu. Neither of us found a difference so we went with the 'old fashioned' because it was a dollar cheaper. Sadly they burnt his patty to a crisp...guess that's why they took so long to bring out the food. Would not go to this location again, especially with so many other great food options at the Irvine Spectrum."
Eileen T.,"Fullerton, CA",300,199,1491,1.0,1/25/2016,"I had the shrimp scampi. This dish should not be called shrimp scampi. The shrimp was fried, dry, and lack flavor. It came with angel hair pasta and no sauce. Husband ordered rib-eye. The dish arrived probably 20 minutes after I had my dish. I was almost done with my shrimp already. Bread basket was also brought at this point. The rib eye was edible because it was too salty. We sent it back to the kitchen. The waiter said that the kitchen told him they made the sauce too salty, and offered to make us another one without the sauce. We waited for another 20 minutes for the steak. This time the steak had no sauce, and also no seasoning. No salt. No pepper. Nothing. Just a piece of grilled beef. Good that we have salt and pepper on the table to season it ourselves. Very disappointed at our dinner experience. So disappointed that we didn't even have cheesecake and just left. :-("
Joshua S.,"San Diego, CA",198,486,234,2.0,7/10/2016,"So we are typically huge fans of the Cheesecake Factory. It's usually a go-to, although the Yard House is unbeatable IMO, but this Cheesecake has been subpar at best the four times we've been here.  The only reason I'm doing 2-stars versus a 1 is because we did have a semi-okay experience dining at the indoor bar side a few weeks ago. Service was okay, nothing to write home about, but the drinks were good and the food came out correct.  This review is based mainly on their new outdoor bar area. Been there three times in the last 1.5 weeks hoping it would be better each time and taking into consideration that it was new and might have some speed bumps.  The first time we weren't impressed. Service was s-l-O-w and the bar wasn't even busy. It seemed like a lot of confusion amongst the bartenders and servers. We had two drinks a piece but we waited for the second. Nobody thanked us for coming in, which is annoying when you pay over $45 for 4 drinks. We chalked it up as a bad night.  Went back a few nights ago hoping for a better experience. The bartender gal didn't seem to have much enthusiasm for being there as we were not greeted professionally and the drinks took a while. We left after we drank it. Main reason was it was super slow and the bartenders couldn't even check on us as we wanted to order another one. Too many places next door to have to wait for a bartender when they are standing around talking.  Last night did it for us. I posted a couple pics of food that just sat forever. It was disgusting. The bartenders couldn't not see it, the food runner saw it because he brought food out a couple times, and nobody bussed it. It was nasty. First off, we had to slide our bar stools down because nobody apparently bussed the dinner from whoever left the bar before us. That food sat there about ten mins after we got drinks also as the bartenders seemingly didn't care. I could see if it was slammed and nobody had time but that was far from the case. Anyways, what was tacky was my GF heard one of the bartenders say how the bar wasn't built properly and we could tell people were annoyed with probably how cramped it is back there. Then, the icing for us was this food and pineapple left by the departing guests prior to is sitting down. It sat so long literally about 40 mins. Eventually a bartender came around and took some of it but left a half a slice of pineapple between us and in front of new guests that sat down. They never came back. Long story short, the service literally sucked, the bar was filthy, and nobody cared enough to clean it up. My drink menu was sat down on top of crumbs that I had to blow away. Yuck. All that and hearing workers complain was enough for me.  Probably the last time we spend money there. Might try the indoor side again sometime but it will be a while. It's a shame because the outdoor space is cool but the service doesn't match."
Jackie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,7,11,1.0,12/12/2016,"45 minutes later, our server tells us she forgot to put in our order.  Mind you this was 5pm, and I had my 11 month old baby who just surpassed his patience in the high chair. ...NO I would not like a free French onion soup ...NO cheesecake either We asked for our meal Togo and got it comped but man what a horrible experience. Thanks for ruining our family night out."
