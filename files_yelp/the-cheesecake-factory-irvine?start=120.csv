Carley O.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/27/2017,"Wow. The girl working the cheesecake bakery bar at 10pm on 06/27 needs to be fired immediately. I've never experienced that type of customer service in my life. Casually walk in and the girl working took 5 minutes of putting cash away to take our order, and when she does shes sounded like she wanted us out right away. Asked what her favorite cheesecake was and said I HATE eating cheesecake and when I went on to ask further questions it was extremely rude short answers. Then after her going back to counting money she finally thinks hey let's get them there cheesecake after another 6 minutes. I pay and ask for forks and she throws them on the counter in front of us. Not sure how she has her job."
Carol L.,"Glendale, CA",1229,1447,2985,1.0,5/8/2016,"My family has been coming here the last three or so Mother's Days (mostly because it's a good half way point for most of us), but this year's visit is ending that tradition. First of all, they MESSED UP OUR RESERVATION.  I think we know how many people are in our family.  Instead of taking the customer-first approach the hostess and then the manager defended their incorrect reservation. Next, they SEATED US AT TWO SEPARATE BOOTHS so we did not even have a family meal.   And lastly, the two booths were the only tables with NEARLY COMPLETE SUNLIGHT BEATING DOWN on them.  After we inquired about other empty tables, the manager informed us that we couldn't be moved and assured us that the sun would soon shift away from us over the building.  Much like their botched reservation, the sun did not follow suit and we dined with the sun beating down on us for the next 90 minutes.  Not very enjoyable as you can imagine. Anyhow, the only bright spot was our server, Isabella.  She was apologetic and friendly and she deserves extra stars."
Adaline R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/14/2017,"For such a popular and busy restaurant the wait wasn't so bad for a table for two. I would probably recommend making a reservation for any more than 5+ The staff was extremely friendly and made date night extremely nice. I was a little disappointed with the serving on one of my plates. If you get one of the split plates ( I got shrimp scampi and steak Diane) the two entrees is separated by a wall of mash potatoes. Don't get me wrong it was delicious, but for that price I would expect a nicer presentation lol  I would definitely come again but stick to my usual pasta Alfredo (perfection)"
Roocky N.,"Corona, CA",31,8,2,1.0,8/17/2017,"I have ordered to go several times, and everything was okay, but a few weeks ago, I ordered Steak Diane but with salad instead of Mashed Potatoes.  I came back to my desk and opened the lunch box.  I found there were too many rotten leaves in the salad. I called and left a msg for the restaurant manager.  He called me back a week later, apologized and asked me to come back again for a better service.  wth?  I won't go back there again although the location is across street from us."
Liz H.,"Irvine, CA",15,167,22,1.0,11/11/2016,"My family and I ate here last night before our show at the Improv, and had a really disappointing experience. We were all shocked and bummed because this is not the norm at all for any Cheesecake Factory we've been to. Our waiter, Alejandro, was inattentive and largely absent. Our drinks were only refilled after asking multiple times. Another waiter (who was wonderful, I'm upset I missed his name) ended up taking our order because Alejandro was MIA. My father asked for more bread - it never came. My mother ordered a salad (from Alejandro, not from the good waiter). It never came. He never came to check up on us, and we sat with our empty appetizer plates crowding the table for ages until a busboy noticed and grabbed them up. We brushed it off and looked forward to our meals. Which were dreadful. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. My eggplant was undercooked. My mother had a dip sandwich that she said was all grease. My sister had a veggie melt, which she took a few bites of before abandoning for fries. The only one happy was my father, who had the Jambalaya and said it was very good. We would have alerted our waiter ... but he was missing.  By the time he reappeared, we'd given up and had a show to get to. In order to not be late, we simply paid and left.  Both my mother and I were sick to our stomachs for the rest of the evening. I'm really, really disappointed. I've never had a bad experience here and I'm a bit shocked by it, but I don't think we'll be returning to this particular location ever again."
Vicky K.,"Tustin, CA",814,205,144,4.0,11/28/2016,"I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars but Cheesecake factory is my default dinner spot if I can't decide where to eat.  Their menu is extensive, service is good and you know what to expect every time.  Not to mention the brown bread is oh so good and endless!  I enjoy going to the Irvine Spectrum location for happy hour.  Try to burger!  It's so yummy and I usually opt for protein style.  THe spinach dip on hh menu is also yummy."
Andrew D.,"Irvine, CA",0,12,1,5.0,8/14/2017,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. and I have a relatively good experience. We had a much shorter wait than I expected; we waited only 15 minutes for our table. We got seated in back which had a nice view of the high rises surrounded the premise. Since it was a beautiful California afternoon, it was a rather pleasant dining experience with the large windows.  It did take a little bit of time for the waiter to introduce himself but nothing out the ordinary for a busy Sunday afternoon. Since we utilized our time to figure out what we wanted to order before getting a table, that's why it felt longer to get our waiter. Since I am a vegetarian, I ordered one of their many pasta options without the chicken. The waiter was very cooperative with that.  Once we ordered our food, the waiter bought us the delicious bread. We didn't care too much for the sourdough but devoured the honey brown bread. The waiter was very proactive in filling our table with the bread because we kept eating it. To be honest, this is one of the reason I wanted to come here. Our waiter was also very proactive on making sure our water cups were full. He would make a round every now and then and kindly ask if we wanted more water before pouring. We appreciated the fact he kept checking up on us and also gave us update on when the food would be arriving.  Once we got the food, the quality of the food was excellent. I think for my dish, they could have gave me more portion but the quality was excellent. I ordered the Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta without the chicken. It wasn't the usual pasta I had at every Italian Restaurant and it was refreshing to have something different.  Since I stuffed myself with all the bread, I didn't have any room in my stomach for their signature cheesecake. My friends ordered a slice to go so I'll take a bite later. I'm sure it'll be as delicious as their pasta."
Brianna L.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/11/2017,"Horrible service. The guy gave my vegetarian friend a pasta with chicken in it. And my friend ATE the chicken. So they suck. The fries came out cold, our burgers were undercooked. The salmon and the bread were pretty appetizing though. Nice. That's about it. The atmosphere is nice. Make sure to be ready to wait twice, and possibly wait to be seated again after they bring you to your table. We had to wait another 5 minutes because it wasn't cleaned up and set up. My friends both work in restaurants, and they have seen better service/quality and were disappointed."
Olivia L.,"Irvine, CA",121,23,19,4.0,1/14/2017,I always love the food here and the service is good. My favorite is chicken Marsala and my sister loves the stuffed mushrooms and fried cheese. Great happy hours but only from 4-6pm. So many choices all of which are delicious.
Mercedes S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",33,84,10,1.0,11/24/2016,"This is the loudest, most chaotic restaurant I've ever been to. 10 minutes after being seated, I was starting to get a headache from all of the competing voices. The floor around our tiny table was sticky and there were crumbs all over my seat. While we waited for someone to take our order, we decided to take our food to go, which is something we don't generally do. When our waiter showed up, we were guilted about it because the tip would have to be split between her and another guy who had been helping us since she was too busy... Not our problem, sorry. The worst part of all of it was the food and the insane prices. We had a $50 gift card, which we thought would easily cover 2 pasta entrees, drinks and some cheesecake; wrong. Our total was over $60 and the food ended up making my boyfriend feel sick from the copious amounts of butter.  Everything about this place is awful!"
Steve T.,"Irvine, CA",107,29,2,2.0,7/12/2017,"I normally frequent this chain restaurant but this particular location was the worst by far. After waiting an hour for a table, I had to wait an addition 20 minutes to receive my food while the rest of my table had already completed their meal. The manager came over and apologized about the experience but that didn't help. I won't be coming to this location any longer and I don't recommend it to anyone."
Jennifer W.,"Bakersfield, CA",225,311,701,5.0,10/24/2015,"We celebrated my Dad retiring after 41 years at his company and The Cheesecake Factory was the perfect place to do it! We had quite a long wait, but we had a very large party. So, that was pretty much expected. Our waitress was fantastic. She was very attentive and was very knowledgeable of the menu. She acknowledged my Dad's retirement several times, which made our experience even more enjoyable.  The food was excellent. The portions were very generous and the food was delicious. We had 15 people at our table and everyone enjoyed their meal. From kids' meals to chicken fettuccine to veggie burgers to Chicken Di Pana to Louisiana Chicken Pasta to Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and more!  Most of us took a piece of cheesecake home and that topped our experience. The cheesecake I had was the best I've ever had in my life! I shared the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake with my husband. I still think about how delicious it was!  Thank you,  Cheesecake Factory for making my Daddy's Retirement lunch a memorable one!"
Tre E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,9,2,1.0,7/27/2017,"I am a fan of cheesecake factory. I enjoy their Chicken Piccata. However this location has lost my trust. Over several different occasions the quality of my food has lowered. Our bread was consistency hard. Our drinks have gone dry without a single waiter or server asking to refill it. I had to ask a bartender to refill it, and I was a restaurant guest. On our last visit we waited over double the estimated time for a table. Then our food took over an hour, they never made it. The only positive thing they did do for me was give us cheesecake within 30 min. Otherwise I would avoid this location."
Carolina F.,"San Clemente, CA",1,14,4,4.0,7/25/2017,Graet fast service the food was delicious me and my hosbend order the buffalo chicken wings and chicken Alfredo pasta it was jummy!!
Janelle J.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",922,393,925,4.0,10/7/2015,"The cheesecake factory in Irvine spectrum is a yummy place to eat. Recommendations: avocado eggrolls for appetizer, the buffalo wings were also a good appetizer with ranch. The Chinese chicken salad (order it off the lunch special menu, it's $5 cheaper) is also tasty. Their bread is always delicious here!  Let's be real, everyone comes here for the cheesecake. Recommendations for that would be the key lime cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake, the tuxedo cheesecake, lemon raspberry cheesecake, and of course original cheesecake with raspberry drizzle."
Stephanie V.,"Santa Ana, CA",218,54,45,2.0,5/14/2017,"I love cheesecake factory I always order the same dish everywhere so I know what to expect , so ok ordered the pasta da vinci first of all very runny the sauce like really ? I get its mother's day and they cooks are busy but if I'm paying over $12 for a plate of pasta I expect quality I asked my waitress to bring me extra sauce she looked at me puzzled girl what is so hard to comprehend that this is not tasting how it always does she looked annoyed and brought me back sauce it was still runny  try adding corn starch to thicken it this is still not the same quality and doesn't taste as other cheesecake factory restaurants well to be honest I think I preferred my appetizer better than the pasta I was honestly upset that it was not as good at it usually is ...But the cheesecake was great and the drink I hope that they can correct this mistake and don't serve people a plate like mine"
Kaera T.,"Irvine, CA",0,21,,4.0,7/6/2017,"I used to go more often with my family when Cheesecake Factory still offered their Lemon Chicken Couscous some months ago.  Nowadays, visits are less frequent although we've found new things to try.  Here are some that I remember:  Our new favorites there: 1) Steak Diane--juicy meat in delicious sweet sauce 2) Marsala Chicken--again, very juicy and tender 3) Chicken Samosas--appetizers with cool cucumber yogurt dip 4) Fried Mac/cheese balls--great but pricey appetizers 5) We haven't gone wrong with any of their cheesecakes!  However, their lemon raspberry cream one is especially light and refreshing after a heavy meal! What we've tried and may or may not order again: 1) Chicken Bellagio--crusted tender chicken breast but had way too much basil pasta What we've tried and will not order again: 1) Chicken Riesling--tasted somewhat bland. In conclusion, 4/5 stars because of the fact that we can't enjoy their craveable Lemon Chicken Couscous anymore :(  I've contacted them a few times to ask if they can place it back.  Hopefully, I get to enjoy it again here!"
Rain N.,"Irvine, CA",1,80,133,5.0,12/11/2016,"We love their chicken madeira, chicken marsala, and meatloaf. Cheesecake: We love their Godiva chocolate cheesecake and banana cheesecake."
Joshua H.,"Kirkland, WA",0,36,2,1.0,10/22/2017,"Terrible wait times for take out!! I live Cheesecake Factory, but this location is awful. I placed an order and upon arrival was told that my order had just been sent to the kitchen, but it shouldn't take too long. Fast forward 20 minutes and I'm still waiting for food!! What's even more annoying is there is a group of employees standing around doing seemingly nothing!!"
