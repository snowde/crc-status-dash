Michelle W.,"Melbourne, Australia",157,190,3176,4.0,10/2/2016,"I have been to a number of cheesecake factory and they never disappoint, their servings are huge, the service is always friendly (some friendlier than others, but always polite)."
Tifania N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",533,51,84,5.0,8/31/2016,"Ok so when I say that I've eaten at cheesecake factory, well over 250 times, I'm not joking you. My family literally eats here at least 1-2 times a week every week since I was little. I've stopped going that much, but my parents still go on the weekly. My brother was a waiter there. My parents know every server and manager, we even know the one in Dubai. They seat us before everyone if the line is long and they greet us when we come in because they know my parents. So I guess you could call me a Cheesecake Factory connoisseur  and this review is way over due. It's a rare occurrence if you open up our fridge and don't find a Cheesecake Factory box in there. I've tried almost every item on the menu, but I'm gonna go over some of my favorites and some menu hacks that I think are great.  First of all I only ask for the brown bread when I start, it's just better to me but that's a personal preference. Also I always ask for ranch dressing to dip the bread in when the waiter comes to the table. Sometimes my om will put butter on the brown bread and brown sugar and it's also delicious. Also remember that if the line is long you can seat yourself anywhere in the bar and the wait is never that long. The new patio here is beautiful too.  The best appetizers:  1. The Thai chicken lettuce wraps are amazing, i always used to order them as my main entree.  2. The Avocado egg rolls are also delicious, never get old.  3. The fried mac and cheese balls are a lot of peoples favorite, but they are a little to heavy and fried for me, still really good though.  4. The sweet corn tamale cakes are really good.  Underrated appetizers -buffalo blasts.  lighter appetizers -spring roles( good if you want something healthier -Roasted Artichoke (delicious balsamic dip) The sliders are pretty average I wouldn't opt for them, but good for kids.  Best Courses by category:  Top Pasta dishes  - Pasta Da Vinci (always good, but definitely need to ask for extra sauce on the side) - Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (good but spicy) - Four Cheese pasta with chicken (everyone's go to, simple but good) -Shrimp with angel hair is also simple but delicious.  Top Chicken Dishes  -Crusted Chicken Romano (substitute penne pasta and ask for extra sauce, way better) -Bang bang chicken and shrimp (if you like Thai) -Chicken madeira( Straight up AMAZING EVERY TIME) HIGHLY RECOMMEND -Chicken Picatta (NEEDS EXTRA SAUCE) -Spicy Cashew chicken(but wish it came with veggies) -The Factory burrito Grande (HUGEEEEE. For sharing. Grande is not a joke) Top Seafood  All the salmon options are fantastic but my opinion of the best flavors in order are      1. Miso      2. Thai       3. Barbeque      4. Grilled      5. Herb Crusted  -Jamaican black pepper shrimp is great too (served with plantains)  Top Steak dishes  -Hibachi steak is delicious (I order a side of mac and cheese in substitue of the mashed potatoes) -The steak Diane and the steak Diane medallions are so tender -most of the steaks are made really well  Burgers -Old fashioned burger (can't go wrong) -wild mushroom burger -blue cheese burger -Mac and Cheese burger (if you want something super heavy) -Veggie (just ok, wouldn't recommend over other dishes) Sandwiches -Grilled Chicken And Avocado Club (ask for ranch on the side, I ask for no mayo) -Chicken Parmesan Sandwich -California Cheesesteak Salads -Vegan cobb salad (healthy and delicious) -Bbq chicken salad (delicious, not very healthy though) Most of the salads actually aren't that healthy but they are good falafel salad (pretty bad, probably biased because I'm middle eastern so I know how good falafel should taste Desserts Dulce De leche caramel   Godiva  Red velvet (not sure if it's still on the menu)  Strawberry shortcake (ask for extra ice cream) No matter how sick of Cheesecake Factory I am it will always have a special place in my heart. We've come here for birthdays, graduations, anniversary's, and so many other important events in our life. It will always feel like home. No normal family should eat at one restaurant this much"
Brandi T.,"Vista, CA",37,7,1,2.0,7/18/2017,"We came here with our family for dinner after our wedding and I completely regret my decision of coming here. They refused to reserve a table for us of 23 people until we all showed up so we had to wait a half hour just to be seated. Then after we were seated it took longer than reasonable for us to be taken care of, drinks, appetizers entrees all took forever. Since my new husband and I were busy talking to our guests we asked to have our order placed at the end of the night for To Go, we ended up waiting well after our guests had left for our dinner to be finished which was cold when we got it and we also told the server we would be paying for everyone's desserts and that also got screwed up. I love the Cheesecake Factory in general but this particular location needs some major help."
Jo K.,"Orange County, CA",479,101,196,3.0,2/26/2016,"Huge plus! They got rid of advertising every other page on their menu!! If it weren't for the service, I might have gone to maybe 2 stars... When we were waiting to be seated, I glanced over at one of chefs sticking their hand in one of the prep stations and eating, while cooking food for the guests. That is not sanitary by any means... Service: - Again, exceptional service. He was friendly and professional throughout the entire night.  Food: Fish Taco Plate - This was surprisingly quite tasty. Four crispy fish tacos with a different flavor profile. I liked how they put the fish on top of the taco so it doesn't get soggy from the veggies. Unfortunately, the beans and the rice were definitely not something I would order again. Overall: I am sure everyone has had Cheesecake Factory at some point in their lives. I just wanted to mention that they finally discontinued advertising on their menus."
Pouya N.,"Mission Viejo, CA",31,27,4,1.0,12/27/2016,"This has to be the worst cheesecake we've been to ever. We eat out a lot and usually for a quick filler we eat at cheesecake mostly the one in mission viejo, for some reason when's ever we get to this one at the spectrum it is the worst service ever they get the food wrong every time, the quality of food is bad and the service from the host (trying to seat a party of 8 at a 6 person table and telling us it will fit)  all the way the service at the table sucks royalty! Big bummer for sure!!"
Maitha A.,"Irvine Spectrum Center, Irvine, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/28/2017,"Ive been to many other branches of cheesecake factory locally and internationally, but this branch by far has the worst service. Our waiter didnt seem happy to be serving us at all. He did not bring any bread basket to our table even though he did to other tables surrounding us.  We asked for an empty plastic cup for the kid but that didn't come through. The kids pasta order came without the chicken that we asked for, he took it to the kitchen, came back 2 mins later telling us they're out of chicken and asked whether we still want it or he'll just take it back without asking if we want anything else for the kid to eat.  We asked for tissue, and when he got it, it fell out of his hands on a plate of fries, he basically said oops sorry, turned around and left immediately without even getting new clean ones! Never once did he check on our table to ask if the food was okay or if we need anything else!! Never coming back again to this branch."
Chris R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",663,90,37,3.0,12/28/2016,"Meh.  I've been to nearly every Cheesecake Factory location in Southern California.  This one tends to have consistently slow service, along with untrained hostesses that will make you wait on one side until being seated, creating an annoying bottleneck. The menu is extensive, with selects for just about anyone.  Food is pretty consistent in all Cheesecake Factories, so here it's really just the service that leaves room for improvement. Favorites- Their Chicken Marsala.  Pizzas are good and their menu and small bites picks work as well.  Good for families, this restaurant is loud."
Nicole L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,31,7,5.0,6/16/2017,"Thank you Annalise! The service was flawless. You were so pleasant, sweet and accommodating, we had to tell your manager. We will be returning in the future!"
Cindy S.,"Irvine, CA",262,314,613,3.0,8/5/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is well known for its novel of a menu.  It takes hours to get through and everything ordered on the menu is pretty average.  It's no surprise that if you are serving a wide array of offerings, it's hard to perfect a particular genre. I'd say nothing is terribly bad except for their lettuce wraps.  My suggestion is not to get asian food at a nonasian restaurant and you should be safe. Anyhoo, came here for national cheesecake day.  I remember having cheesecake at the factory and loving every bite of it.  As it turns out cheesecake has its own day just as mothers do but cheesecake extends for 2 days.  I'm not complaining for half-off cheesecake for two days.  I was ecstatic.  I usually stick to my 2 favorites: classic (sometimes with strawberry topping) or the pumpkin when it's in season.  They are to die for.  This go round I tried another popular flavor as recommended by a server there and I was sorely disappointed.  Had the white chocolate mac nut cheesecake.   The cheesecake part of the dessert was spot on but the nuts baked into it were old and stale tasting.  The topping had fresh nuts which was better but the old nuts ruined the overall flavor.  On top of that the whipped cream machine was broken so that couldn't mask the old nut flavor.  I will be back for national cheesecake day next year and maybe another visit in between."
Babak Y.,"Irvine, CA",371,39,15,5.0,10/5/2016,They finally remodeled this place. Got a great server. His name was Mike. I think it was his first day and we were his first table. He was very nice and took care of everything. They finally remodeled this place too. The bar on the patio looks good...
Will A.,"Irvine, CA",0,46,11,2.0,7/24/2016,"I got the eggs Benedict and a bloody Mary.  Service is good and fast. The bloody Mary was only a liitle peppery (no horseradish), but simple and good.  That's a good thing.  Ugh, the eggs Benedict was very disappointing. The hollandaise sauce was very yellow and flat and tasted like it came from a Knorr mix. The English muffin was barely toasted, generic, and had no flavor. Then there are the undercooked poached eggs.  Yes, you want your yolk runny, but you don't want the white runny. Yes, they were running, not soft, running. There are much better options on the menu.  The eggs Benedict menu item is just a generic high margin brunch must have for Cheesecake Factory.  There are much better brunch options at the Irvine Spectrum."
Tizoc M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,150,293,3.0,12/4/2016,It wasn't amazing but surprisingly good.  It seems more of a touristy place with excellent  cheesecake.
Mimi D.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,13,1,1.0,6/16/2017,"Came in here on a Friday night and was seated within 20 mins which was impressive however, it was all downhill from there! We were starving and ordered everything at once, it took 25 mins for the starters and drinks to arrive at our table after which we waited a further 30 mins for entrees to arrive! Our server did not come to check on us to see if we needed anything or if the food was okay,  no apologies for the late food, ignored us by walking really fast and pretending not to hear our calls...all really frustrating and I was understandably HANGRY! Don't bother coming during busy times!"
Adriana V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1,12,3,4.0,3/19/2016,"The food was delicious!!! I do have to say that the girl that is a cashier (not sure what she is but it wasn't our hostess) was pretty rude.  Other than that, the server was really nice and attentive. The busboy was extremely nice though! I dare say he gave better service than our server. His name is Saul. So friendly, he was always asking if we needed anything and he even offered to box up our leftovers and got us refills on our drinks to go. I had never had such excellent service like his.  Again, the food was delicious. I strongly recommend the Crispy Chicken Costoletta!!! This is soooo good! The chicken is nice and tender, best dish I've had here at Cheesecake Factory!"
Zack R.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",4,40,18,1.0,8/1/2016,"Came to this place with low expectations and got even worse. Service was slower than a slug racing a snail. Orange chicken was basically just a honey glaze that left your mouth dry. Brown rice was dry and undercooked. Passion iced tea was too aggressive. My friend said his bacon was ""stale"" and the bagels were burnt. Eggs were tiny and the chef was lazy enough to barely even scramble them. Spinach and cheese dip was mediocre at best, the spinach was flavorless and overtook the cheese. They didn't even bring jam with my friend's bagels after he asked for it. This place is a joke. Never coming back and no tip."
Tina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,44,26,1.0,8/7/2016,"We eat there a lot but we decided to try the spectrum new outdoor seating. It's impressive. After an hour wait we sit down and order appetizers. 35 minutes later NOTHING. We ask and we get ""almost ready"". Meanwhile others around us got their DINNER...who sat after us. We ask for the manager and as soon as he got to our table he said (before even hearing our concern)...""so folks we understand there is some problem with your food and it's completely our fault but I am working on it personally"". I said ""40 minutes for appetizer"" and he said ""yes we are very busy"". I think his name was Mike. This was around 1030pm.  We weren't as hungry by that time. Finished all the bread and drinks. We were thinking maybe something gets credited and the bill came with nothing.  Admitted it was his fault and decided to do nothing for the inconvenience - truly disappointed in the way he handled it. Anywhere I been when it's their mistake they handle it better.  And if cheesecake management would reach out now then I would be happy to write an updated review."
Tatyana A.,"Irvine, CA",0,13,,1.0,11/8/2016,Came here with my service dog for lunch. Had the worse experience ever. The manager Dan is completely rude and did not do a good job of resolving anything. Normally come here all the time but now I will not be coming back because I do not appreciate being treated poorly. Dan needs to find a new job or take classes to be a better manager and person.  This place of horrible.
James M.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/19/2017,"I went to Sunday brunch,waited forever for service even with an empty bar...food came cold. ..and Terri was unprofessional and down right rude! I left and paid my 65.00 bill and she chased me out of cheesecake to the outside courtyard asking where her tip was...then later I walked by after shopping and she ran out if her bar and said she didn't find her tip...thought she was going to try to put me in an arm bar...but I wasn't scared as an ex swat member. .. happy Sunday Terri and Mike Mesias was worthless."
Kristin Leigh M.,"Las Flores, CA",702,1127,1788,4.0,1/10/2015,"Wear comfy shoes! Why? You'll likely be waiting for a very long time, if you come for supper, and there isn't ample space to sit. So you will be standing. Dinner waits are usually more than 30 minutes, and can be over 50 minutes on on the weekends. I personally don't have that type of patience as a party of two, so I've started to visit the Shops at Mission Viejo location more, where wait times are more reasonable. If you come for lunch during the week, you might not have to wait. On the weekends, could be around 15 minutes.  A few pointers: + tropical iced tea is delicious + I could live off of the bread baskets. And I'm not joking. If you dine with me, we will have at least two. (yes, I have an addiction to bread). + crusted chicken romano is the best dish. Lunch portion is plenty large, and I always have leftovers. + if you get the asian chicken salad, get it without the ""straws."" can't recall their exact name, but the white noodle things that come on top. look lovely but make eating the salad near impossible and are a huge filler. + if you don't like a TON of salad dressing, order it on the side. + service is always impeccable.  + indoor and outdoor (with heaters) seating available."
Deeah K.,"Santa Ana, CA",30,123,124,3.0,5/1/2017,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory many times, and it seems like it is getting pricier while the service and quality of food is not a the level to match the price increase. We went to this location and had a lunch special and asked the waiter what sides were offered and he told us, but neglected to tell us that the side we picked (Caesar salad) was a dollar per plate more. He should have said, ""If you like a Caesar it would be more"" but didn't. Also the food was cold when we got it and the waiter complained that he had too many tables. I'm not a fan of CCF anymore. It's overrated and overpriced."
