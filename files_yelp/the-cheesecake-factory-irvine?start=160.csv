Diana B.,"Orange County, CA",636,241,561,4.0,5/16/2015,"Same as other locations, great food with great friends for a great price. Ambience: --For some reason, I thought this restaurant was a little brighter than their chain counterparts, but I could be wrong. Probably because I was sitting closer to the Hostess Stand instead of deep into the restaurant. Service: --Excellent as always. As the hostess was walking the guests to their table, she asked everyone how they were doing and if they were having a nice day. Our server was super nice as well; he always came around to refill our waters and asked if we wanted more bread. Food: --All their dishes are large enough to share between two people. --Two words: brown bread. The bread is always fresh and warm and the butter just melts when you spread it on. Delicious. --Salmon Genovese: Salmon topped on a pesto sauce with pasta balls and sun dried tomatoes. OMG. I did not think that I would like this dish as much as I did. The sun-dried tomatoes add a perfect touch to the pesto sauce. The pasta balls were on the firmer side but I prefer to have them softer. --Chicken Alfredo: your typical chicken Alfredo just like at any other restaurant They grate actual parmesan cheese on it so if you put a lot, there's that cheesy string of cheese throughout the plate whenever you pick up a bite. Dessert: --Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake: Definitely can't go wrong with this one. It's their infamous cheesecake with 3 fresh strawberries on top. It adds a great touch and freshness to the cheesecake. It might look small, but it's very filling."
Tammy L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",32,122,72,1.0,7/26/2016,Waitress forgot items Was overcharged Manager came to speak to me in a condescending voice and only took $2 off.  Also apparently they don't need to tell you when they will charge you extra. They'll just do it. Manager was really snippy and rude. Just came back and overcharged me AGAIN.  What a night mare. Charged me and my date $38 when that was the whole tab. Charged twice?? Anna Rodriguez is the worst manager. She has resolved nothing and has actually made the waitress mistake even worse.
Anusha P.,"Alhambra, CA",38,34,,4.0,5/8/2017,"My favourite place to have cheesecakes. The food isn't that great but their delectable selection of desserts make up for it! The original, red velvet and Godiva chocolate cheesecakes are to Die for!"
Smally C.,"Irvine, CA",332,18,11,5.0,7/30/2016,What's not to love about this place! Other than the long wait....but sooo many stickin' great options!!! Been so long since I've been here with the recent visit I noticed the outside bar pretty darn cool!
Jim C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2,37,1,2.0,4/12/2017,"Very disappointed. Food always great but had a problem with this location. My wife and a friend both ordered crusted salmon salad. It came out with very little salmon and wasn't crusted. We complained to manager and they replaced it but argued, actually argued, about taking it off the check!!! We've gone to Cheesecake for years, always had great experiences, but couldn't believe the lack of customer service at this location!!"
Babak V.,"Redondo Beach, CA",19,5,3,3.0,6/3/2017,"I really expected more. Mediocre food quality, not clean glasses... This place is not recommended"
Ryan W.,"Torrance, CA",863,710,2912,1.0,11/24/2015,"WOW... It's hard to even explain my visit to this Cheesecake Factory location.. It really was that bad. We came here for lunch on a Saturday. We were excited since it only took a few minutes to get seated and we were all hungry. Once we were seated it already took a few minutes for our server to come and get our drink order. It took even longer for the drinks and bread to come out. After a few more minutes we finally put in our order. I ordered the Renee's Special which one-Half of a Fresh Turkey Sandwich or Chicken-Almond Salad Sandwich, a cup of soup and a small salad. I asked our waitress which sandwich was more popular and she tells me the chicken-almond sandwich is a lot better so I said I'll take that one. The soup for that day was the loaded potato soup. We also ordered the carbonara and the egg roll sampler.  IT TOOK AN HOUR FOR OUR FOOD TO COME OUT!!! Why?!?!? I have no idea... No apology for it taking so long. No refills on our drinks until we ask. Simply ridiculous. We even asked a random employee if we can get more water and bread and she just looked at us and said ""you can ask your waitress for that"". Seriously?  The thing that I found to be even more ridiculous was that they gave me a turkey sandwich when I clearly said that I would want the chicken-almond salad sandwich. I have never complained to a manager on site, but I wanted to so bad. I was going to say something, but I did not want to wait another hour for them to make the correct sandwich.  Absolutely horrible food and service at this location. I would never come back and I would highly recommend you eat elsewhere if you are looking for a place in The Spectrum."
Ms. B.,"Tustin, CA",0,14,1,2.0,5/28/2017,"Went here for a birthday dinner. We had a party of about ten people. We are very easy to wait on, so I was surprised at how slow the service was. By the time ate found arrived the kids were full from water and bread. They were tired and ready to leave. Basically, Friday night dinner here takes alllll night. I want pleased."
Hannah C.,"ON, Canada",236,229,153,3.0,7/13/2016,"The cheese cake was great and the server was friendly however the service was quite slow. I went on a Thursday evening and the place was not even too crowded. Noise level is quite high but the environment is casual and clean. I ordered a lemon raspberry and tasted fantastic. It was rich, dense and had the perfect amount of moisture for it to melt in your mouth and not crumble into pieces."
Amy C.,"Whittier, CA",101,31,1,4.0,5/23/2017,"I enjoyed this location. My Fiance, friends, and I were at the bar area before catching a movie drinks do the job and the Chicken samosas were great! Don't really have time to wait until a booth is open. :/ that is the only thing i dislick about the cheesecake factory that you can't make reservations"
Abby C.,"Glendale, CA",0,7,1,5.0,9/7/2017,"I've been to a number of Cheesecake Factory, and this one is one of my favorites. The staff here is very nice and our server took care of our table very well. Will come back here again!"
Christy V.,"Mission Viejo, CA",66,3,,1.0,2/3/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory totally disappointed me. Ordered take out of garlic shrimp noodles and the shrimp was not clean l,they were so small compared to the other cheesecake factories and there most of the shrimp were overcooked. I was so sad especially since i wasn't feeling well. My boyfriend said his food was ok he got a chicken sandwich"
Sherri G.,"Irvine, CA",324,421,1067,3.0,3/9/2015,"Lunch is better - less crowds. Dinner wait SUCKS! 30 minutes means you wait for 50 then wait for 30 more for food to come. Food is ok but I won't come back to wait 80 minutes to eat it.  On the positive side, the servers are friendly...probably because they see how irritated and hungry you are after being deceived by the hostess..."
Mimi S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",651,497,522,2.0,6/12/2016,"These folks need to get their act together.  I ordered a lemon meringue cheesecake they tell me they only have the frozen ones....I pass then a few minutes later someone else comes and tells me they have it.  But the banana cream pie is frozen....yeah no.  They are a chain and for the amount they charge for cheesecake you'd think they are making it in-house.  I am always surprised when people don't know its frozen.  Anyways, the server was barely ok...she didn't really come back and check on us."
Frank H.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/3/2017,Ordered a cheesecake 2 days in advance for my wife's birthday.  Arrived to pick it up and it wasn't ready. They told me the bakers in the back messed up.
Tricia M.,"Seal Beach, CA",201,454,985,5.0,2/22/2015,"Cheezy, cakey goodness. That sounds really gross actually. Three of us came to Cheesecake Factory at 11am and were the first ones there! Woooop. The menu is huge and varied, with a good amount of healthy and unhealthy options. Between the three of us, we each ordered a salad, as well as avocado rolls and an omelette to share.  Waitress: ""That's a lot of food.... Just letting you know..."" Us: ""Uhhh, its okay, we'll probably just take some home."" After she leaves..  Me: ""Yeah, I can finish it all."" -.- And that I did. Avocado rolls were crunchy on the outside and stuffed with creamy goodness on the inside, and the omelette did not lack in size or taste. The salads are pretty big too. The restaurant filled up quickly, but the service was always good!"
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,1/15/2015,"I've been here a few times since my last visit and I have discovered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Uh...one word...DELICIOUS!!!  It's a bowtie pasta with breaded chicken breasts and it's just the right amount of spicy. I absolutely LOVE this dish and I can't imagine ordering anything else for a long time when coming here. For dessert I had the Carmel Macadamia Cheesecake and it's wonderful. It's very sweet and I could only eat half so I took it home and had dessert for the next night.  The service here is always good and I can't complain. They tried seating us in the back room again and for some reason I just dislike the vibe of this room. I prefer the booths along the wall and would rather wait for one of those to open up. My friend and I had so much to catch up on so it was nice that our waitress let us enjoy ourselves without any pressure to leave. This has been my ""go to"" place when coming to the Spectrum."
Kelly M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/17/2017,"Great service and great food! 1st time at this location, and everything was delicious. Will definitely be back!"
Vi V.,"Orange County, CA",281,760,3358,3.0,11/29/2015,"Came here to celebrate me getting hired with my supervisor, the accounting supervisor, and the accounting manager. Came in before the lunch rush so got seated right away. Bread was brought out not too long after. What I got: Lunch Portion Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta: my go to dish! Penne is my favorite type of pasta, it wasn't too spicy, and chicken was juicy. It also comes with asparagus and crunchy tortilla strips on top. Loved everything about it! Can't go wrong with it! Salted Caramel Cheesecake: first time ordering a cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory...they have so many to choose from, but decided on this one. Blonde brownie on bottom, then the caramel cheesecake, then the caramel mousse, and then topped off with salted caramel.  A little bit on the sweeter side and I wished it had just a little bit more of the salted caramel part. The brownie part I could do without, but everything else was delicious! 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: higher ups wanted something that was like a chocolate cake, but yet a cheesecake so...servers recommended this cheesecake! Not a fan of chocolate, but higher ups enjoyed it. It was cheesecake with chocolate cake and a chocolate cream. Service: Drinks were refilled. Food took awhile to get out. Servers were always checking up on us though."
Philip O.,"Irvine, CA",7,4,,2.0,1/6/2017,"If you're putting thought into planning where to eat for an evening to the point that you're actually checking out reviews, then you probably don't want to come here. The food is simply not worth the price of admission or the hassle of slow service. The food quality is almost fine, although in that jack of all trades master of none signature style. As for my meal, they managed to forget half the ingredients in a 4 ingredient sandwich, and of course everyone in the party had finished long before it could  be rectified. Ultimately, they don't care about your patronage and aren't afraid to let it show. Good for them, but I obviously would only return under extreme duress. In conclusion, the cheesecake factory is the perfect choice if you want to make any special occasion feel a little less special."
