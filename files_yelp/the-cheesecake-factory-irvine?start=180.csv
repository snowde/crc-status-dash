Savannah R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,10,,4.0,4/18/2017,Another of my absolute favorite places to eat. Always am satisfied with the food and theres so many different things on the menu to order its always so hard to decide. At times it can be a bit chaotic in here on the weekends so if your looking for something not high volume and very loud to go with the family might want to go somewhere else but besides that everything great.
Margaret L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",1,76,,3.0,11/2/2016,The Cheesecake selection is delicious as this is what your restaurant and the name are known for. We tried both the white chocolate caramel and the chocolate chip.   My constructive criticism (I hope) to note is when entering your restaurant the wait for a hostess to seat the customer is not efficient. There were numerous open tables and it still took 10 minutes to be seated way in the back and the dark.The front staff staff chatted while deciding which table and where and then it took 2 people to escort a part of 2! Our server was very good and pleasant. I do think you could cut down on the huge scoops of whipped cream placed on the cake. Turned me off a little before I even tasted it. Maybe most diners like all the whipped cream but it takes away from the special cheesecake flavors.
Michael Y.,"North Hollywood, CA",72,2,1,4.0,10/30/2016,"After a 2-hour workout, my friends and I decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory at Irvine Spectrum Center on Friday night to get some fat. As a bodybuilder you need to get extra calories after your training in order to make up part of your expending. It was 9pm and there were not so many diners. There are several parking lots, so feel free to drive! It has nice location, nice service, nice environment, fine tastes and reasonable price. It's a fine place to relieve your hunger. You will enjoy the appetizer. They offer two kinds of breads. The first one is traditional baguette. It's as hard as the dumbbell so you may want to cut it into little pieces. The second one is chocolate flavor baguette. This one is smooth enough like a yoga mat. REMEMBER THIS! Do not finish the bread before your 20 dollars main course comes. I don't think your stomach can hold all of them. The food I ordered is ""Shrimp with Angel Hair"". As you can tell, I chose this because of the name. What the heck is Angel Hair, right?  After it arrived, I saw my Angel Hair. It has beige coat and it does look like hairs. It tastes like real hairs too! Well, that's not true. It's just pasta, thinner pasta. The food serving is ok, enough for a hungry bodybuilder. One of my friends got a XXL one! I would say the serving is just right, no extra and no surplus. This meal cost us $100 total ($25 each) which is acceptable for a bodybuilder. Steaks and lettuce are much more expansive, aren't they! My hairs tasted bad at the beginning. Actually it had no taste at all. :( So we asked for more cheese. The situation turned better with the extra cheese. There were 6 large fresh shrimps huddled up around the plate and a heap of hairs winded in the middle. Grilled tomato pieces are dotted on the top. The whole thing is surrounded by Marinara Sauce. Overall my hair tastes ok, looks good and my friends said theirs are fine too. ;) Servers there are absolutely kind and patient. When I was here the first time, I was not sure about what the dishes are. Our waitress explained everything perfectly clear for us. My bio97 professor did the same thing during lecture! LOL One big disadvantage of The Cheesecake Factory is that it takes forever to make your food. I mean, how much time can making pasta takes? You may have to finish all bread and butter and a cup of drink before getting your main course but AGAIN, DON'T DO IT. You can hear the sound of metal banging on metal if you are seated next to the kitchen but don't panic! It's not an earthquake!"
Nick W.,"Southwest Anaheim, CA",0,19,3,1.0,12/31/2015,"Worst dessert I've ever tasted. Strawberry short cake.  Had seen previous pictures that looked good, but they changed the recipe somehow.  The cake is instead 3 cold biscuits that are so hard and dry that you can't cut through them with a fork. They put a bunch of sugar on top of them and frozen solid ice cream in between, but it is still inedible.  Only took a bite and didn't get a refund."
Jazmine E.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,11,1,4.0,4/24/2017,I loved the time I went here before my winter formal. I went to Cheesecake Factory in my pretty blue dress and waited to be seated for 45 minutes. WOW!
Jessica S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",46,43,3,2.0,7/3/2016,"We came here to celebrate our 6 year anniversary. The food was great but the service was extremely lacking effort. I ordered a salad that was not good. I set it aside and not once did the waitress notice the plate was still there, full of salad, and not once did she ask if something was wrong with it or if I'd like something else.  Instead of being offered a refill on my iced tea I had to request it. She took my cup and brought it back full but with no ice. Oh, thanks. I love room temperature tea while seated outside on a hot patio.  Last but not least we were brought the bill very abruptly without being asked if we would like anything else. What else could we want? Oh, I don't know... Maybe CHEESECAKE?!  Needless to say we didn't partake in dessert due to the poor service and chose to get out of there as soon as we could, came home, and had dessert.  Unfortunate experience on such a special day. Our waitress' name was Ashley.  Two stars for good food. That's it."
Jasmin G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,3,,3.0,4/22/2017,It was a Wednesday and no one was  there but we still waited 10 minutes to get a table and 20 to order drinks . There was also a lot of staff just talking and laughing.
Sara K.,"Irvine, CA",6,8,1,1.0,7/4/2016,"1 star for the other good employees if there are any. Horrible experience ever :( services slow and unprofessional. Food is not cooked as I order and not clean well. Never go there again.  To ask for warm bread to replace the original cold bread that they served me take 15 minutes and 5 employees to notice that yeah a customer need warm bread. Result: cold bread was handed to me quickly and the servers avoid me when they are 6 feet away from me (their supply counter is exactly 6 feet from me and yes they facing me and yet avoid my call and my hand waving at them)  It was lunch time and there is not many customers. There are plenty of servers and employees, but they don't care to check on me or other customers near me. (waited 8 min for a straw) I keep calm because Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant. Maybe the food turn out fine. NO!!! My steak is too cooked, the taste is too dry and not good as I experienced plus mush potato has sand in it. I am so done.  When I stop eating the server suddenly appeared and check on me. Of course I only said I chew on rock. 5 min later the manager came and apologize. They don't believe me at first and I don't need them to believe me because I will not go there ever again. I have enough. 5min later after they inspected my spit out food, they apologize and pay for my plate. I paid the rest and tip them too. Why? Because I am not the one who want to eat free by making complain."
Linda J.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,15,,5.0,9/6/2017,Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. I love the parmesan crusted chicken...so good!!  My two favorite desserts combine in the Tiramisu cheesecake...heaven!
Mohammad Z.,"Irvine, CA",4,18,3,1.0,9/6/2016,"Honestly I would always go almost every week it was by far my favorite place the last two times I'm sorry food is extremely salty I would order the nachos and it was BURNED .. Come on cheeeecake factory and the worst part I was there last night I got food poison, they have given me old chicken I don't think I'll ever go back to you again I gave it two chances but I can't anymore ..  This place defiantly went down to lower quality."
Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720,3.0,11/5/2015,"I had spent over 5 hours straight in Dave and Buster's playing one arcade game. No water break and no food break. At 5 pm, I was hungry, dehydrated, and tired. Walking around the Spectrum in search of food, I ended up towards the other end from D & B's at the Cheesecake Factory. Very minimal wait for a table of 2 (less than 10 minutes), despite coming in on a Sunday. First order of business was sodas all around to replenish the low blood sugar from the unexpecting fasting during arcade game play. The first glass of Coke was very refreshing. After getting some sugar in, it was easier to think about what to order. Round one was the spinach and cheese dip appetizer ($11.95), which came with tortilla chips and salsa. I was pleased it came hot to our table, the temperature just right for the cheesy spinach and artichoke gooeyness to be scooped up by the chips. Seared tuna tataki salad ($18.50). This is my usual go-to salad at the Cheesecake Factory and BJ's and any other chain restaurants if they have such a salad on the menu. I asked for dressing on the side, but the dish came with dressing mixed into the salad + an additional container of dressing on the side. -_- That sort of defeated the purpose of me asking. Other than more dressing than I requested and wanted (the salad was drenched in the usual amounts as a salad with dressing mixed in would be), the seared tuna's quality and freshness matched the price and the avocado slices were just the right amount of ripe. Louisiana chicken pasta ($16.95). BF opted for the full dinner size portion (lunch size is also available). I took a couple of bites and while good, it lacked a certain umph. On a scale of 1 - 5 with 5 as the top, I'd rate it a 3.  Overall, this place is what you'd expect of a Cheesecake Factory. Thumbs up on consistency."
Katt L.,"Irvine, CA",33,69,165,1.0,9/6/2015,Came to get a 28 $ cheesecake waiting around forever  with a screaming tired 2year old.... and the guy forgot to go get it to give to me!!! I waited for like 15-20 minutes.. after i reminded the cashier he sends someone else to go get it.  Guess What they are all out... OMG     Im so stressed out i don't even want to go into a big rant about them so i will stop it here!
Cris G.,"Chula Vista, CA",227,16,1,4.0,12/31/2016,All you need to know is Chicken Bellagio. That's it. No need to look at the rest of the menu.
Matt R.,"San Clemente, CA",142,85,25,3.0,5/18/2016,"Generally pleased with cheesecake factory but last night was thoroughly disappointed with the food. I ordered the steak tacos... The meat was bland and little flavor in the dish. The rice was terrible and beans were blah. The other dishes of the people with me were equally as bland. I'll if course go back, bit there bad dishes in one sitting is something I can't overlook."
Mike F.,"Irvine, CA",60,133,178,2.0,8/31/2015,"***Bar Area Only** Stopped in after having dinner at a different place at the Spectrum but we wanted to continue to drink and have dessert here. We stopped in around 8 pm or so. Bar area was half full. #winning #winning, until we sat down! Our server had two speeds: Slow and Stop! My friend order the Lemoncello Cream Torte and two of us ordered Jack drinks. I'm pretty sure we watched a turtle walk two miles before our drinks came out. My friend said she saw our drinks sitting at the bar for a long time. Finally, after dropping our drinks off,  the waiter asked if there was anything else. We mentioned the dessert and he acted like he forgot.  Seriously, 3 items total sir! Would have kept drinking here but service sucked. We gone!"
Ryan A.,"Irvine, CA",6,1,1,5.0,9/15/2016,"Any1 who visits CCF, should try the strawberry cheesecake. It is literally the best desert ever!"
Kevin B.,"Irvine, CA",221,25,,1.0,8/14/2017,"Trash. That's what I have to say about this awful location. We came in during one of the oddest hours with minimal customers expecting the highest of food quality and customer service. This was approximately 3pm on a Tuesday. First and foremost, we were rudely told to wait 20 minutes. As we were seated, we were met with the sound of very loud and annoying music. I asked FIVE employees to lower the music until I had to find a sixth. Complimentary bread and butter took a very long time to be served and it came out cold. We ordered the chicken littles and da vinchi pasta which are two of our favorites. This time, the chicken littles were very cold and saturated in old oil, the da vinchi pasta also tasted like fish. Awful experience with this location and will not be coming back. I know management will read this, so I offer you the chance to fix this."
Ellie H.,"Irvine, CA",0,13,5,5.0,9/30/2016,3 words.. oh. My. God. The cheesecakes are to die for!! Coming from England I was expecting a lot with all the hype it had and it definitely didn't let me down. I had the snickers cheesecake and it was delicious!
Luis E.,"Orange, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/15/2016,Horrible service. Ordered curbside and order was incomplete. The best they could do was remove the item that was incomplete from my bill.  Geee how noble. Then they asked me to return after I was half way to my destination wth an incomplete order. So dissatisfied and never ordering or dining here ever
Marlyn V.,"Irvine, CA",1,73,1,3.0,2/4/2017,"Place is huge, super loud and filled with a bunch of strollers. Wow lol  Came here for my birthday with my amigas after work and we quickly got seated.  Food is good.  I enjoyed my time here.  Staff is nice."
