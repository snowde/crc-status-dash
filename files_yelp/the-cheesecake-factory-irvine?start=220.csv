Hungry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,143,139,2.0,1/28/2017,"This location is terrible. We live across the street and frequently dine in/take out and in both instances their customer service or lack thereof is atrocious. They are notorious for long hold times all times of the day when you place take out orders in which I've had to hang up and re-dial 3 or more times until order gets placed. Meh, too bad Bc we would eat here more often if it wasn't such a hassle to order food"
Richard K.,"San Diego, CA",12,88,7,5.0,6/26/2017,"Not my first visit to a cheesecake factory, but the best.  The service was outstanding, attentive and pleasant.  The Medallions of Beef lunch special was very tasty and cooked to perfection,  We sat outside and enjoyed the great weather and pleasant surroundings.  This place and its employees should be a model for all Cheesecake Factory restaurants."
Remie M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",864,652,525,4.0,5/12/2014,"I've been to this establishment since it opened.  This was my go to cheesecake when I lived in Irvine.   Love this resto!  this review is for the bar area. Amy and Johnny, u two totally made our night! Thanks for being so personable and fun! Tons of laughs! Really good bartenders.  Drinks were PERFECT! My bf and I came here on Sunday night, mother's day.  We came to grab a drink and appetizers before our movie started.  What better way to spend before watching Zac Efron on the big screen! YUM!  We ordered 2 original mojitos, small plate of fried zucchini and stuffed mushrooms.   Excellent food and service! Hope to have u as our bartenders again!"
Sai Deepthi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/31/2016,I love the ambience here and the staff are friendly .The lettuce wrap is very taste and awesome.Everyone should try that.I loved the margaritas here best one is pomegranate margarita.. We come almost once in 2-3 weeks and we never get bored of his food.I will come back again and again.
Robert H.,"Irvine, CA",0,17,3,2.0,7/23/2015,"Overall 2 star experience due to the last rating which ruined the night for me. Food - 4 stars.  They have great variety here, everyone in our party always loves the brown bread and butter and the entrees are never bad, some better than others.  My wife had a grilled chicken sandwich and I had Renee's special.  Cream of Chicken soup was great but both our salads were either not dressed or too light to tell.  Overall no major complaints. Service - 2 stars.  Couldn't figure out who our waitress was, I think they changed on us twice as someone either had to go on break or was leaving for the night.  Never knew who to flag down for a soda refill so ended up embarrassing myself asking another waitress who gave me a half eyeroll when she said she would let my server know. Facilities - 0 stars.  Please see below for my picture of the men's restroom on a Sunday night at 10:30pm.  The restaurant was nearly empty and the restrooms hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long.  This is the worst part about this place.  When either kid says they have to go to the restroom, I dread it as the men's restrooms here are always filthy.  I closed my eyes going in and hoped for the best, but this is what I got. Saying goes, you can usually tell how clean the kitchen is by judging the restroom cleanliness.  I certainly hope this isn't the case as we'll probably be back."
Em Jay S.,"Edison, NJ",1,42,58,3.0,4/14/2016,"2 out of 3 dishes were solid. We got the Four Cheeses Pasta, Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken, and Chicken and Biscuit. I got the Chicken and Biscuit thinking there's no way anyone can screw it up. Wrong. My biscuit was hard and overdone. The chicken and gravy were okay. My cousin was really happy with her pasta, and my aunt was happy with her Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken. Stick to what they do best, which is the pasta menu. The menu is huge, so I didn't expect everything to be great. I give the service and atmosphere a thumbs up. It's easy getting seated on a week day, btw."
Arthur D.,"Irvine, CA",1,136,6,4.0,1/7/2017,"We ordered curbside takeout a few months ago. Food was great.  The curbside pickup was kind of packed and a short walk to the front door.  I remember TCF employee coming out at least once to do the transaction and deliver food.  Maybe twice.  I believe other restaurants use the same curbside pickup parking space.  You had to park parallel.  I think spots for about 5 cars total. Not TCF's fault, but in my opinion Irvine Spectrum Parking is horrible overall. FYI, I just called and the restaurant does not take reservations."
Alice L.,"Buena Park, CA",678,666,3002,3.0,3/8/2014,"I wouldn't necessarily volunteer to go to Cheesecake Factory if I had a choice but I've come here mostly for company lunches and if there's a gift card in the picture ;) Notable dishes/items: Ahi Tartare Banana Cream Cheesecake Chicken Bellagio Coulotte Steak Happy Hour Items Meatloaf Disliked: Chinese Chicken Salad - completely bland, and the lettuce wasn't fresh Waitstaff are all pretty friendly though and food comes out fairly quick! I'm just not personally a fan of the food/prices in general :) If anything, I'd come here solely for the BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE. Yum!"
Brenda T.,"West Covina, CA",459,106,15,4.0,4/29/2015,"And people said that eating skinny was hard. Decided to check out the Skinnylicious menu tonight. Definitely worth it! The meals were soo satisfying and more than enough. Not quite big as the regular entrees but still had all the flavor. Food that tasted good, with half the calories? Who could pass that up? -CRISPY CRAB BITES *** Favorite app on the night. Wasn't expecting them to be small fried pieces of deliciousness. Broke so easily with the fork. Filled with lots of crab and served with a garlic mayo dip. Creamy, crunchy, and addicting with every single bite. GRILLED STEAK MEDALLIONS Grilled steak pieces served on top of mashed potatoes, mushrooms, asparagus with a red wine sauce. SOOOO GOOOD. Worth a try. Comfort food with a nice refreshing touch from the tomatoes."
Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",629,573,156,4.0,4/6/2015,"Hibachi Steak is certified Angus beef hanger steak with shiitake mushrooms, onions, and bean sprouts served with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus. The steak was a great cut, but I think it would have been better served as whole with the shiitake, onion, and bean sprout mixture on top. The sauce that everything was tossed in was overpowering whole plate. It would have been better as a marinade for the steak and let it caramelize on the grill. The wasabi mashed potatoes did not quite match. This would have paired better with fish like miso-glazed salmon. The tempura asparagus were cooked perfectly with a crispy, light batter while retaining the green flavor of the asparagus. Rating: 2/5 Grilled Rib-Eye Steak is served with French fries. I think a couple of tempura onion rings snuck onto my plate as well. The ribeye was grilled to a perfect rare. The meat was beautifully marbled for a juicy, tender steak. The fries were fried perfectly with a golden brown crispy outside and tender on the inside. The tempura onion rings were fantastic! The batter was light and crispy on the outside and the onion was sweet and tender inside. Rating: 5/5 Kobe Burger is an American style Kobe beef burger topped with sautéed mushrooms and onions. I can't eat a burger without cheese so I added a slice of cheddar. One of my friends had ordered it on a prior visit and she loved it. I love Wagyu beef so I knew the next time, I had to try it. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, blending the grilled flavor on the outside and taste the sweet, buttery flavor of the meat inside. This burger was onolicious! It's one of the best burgers I've ever had. The mushrooms and onions were the perfect topping. I am glad that I went with a green salad instead of fries. This was a burger to finish in one sitting. Reheating it would not do it justice. Rating: 5/5 Chicken Madeira is sautéed chicken breast topped with fresh asparagus, melted mozzarella, mushroom Madeira sauce, and served with mashed potatoes. This is my hubby's favorite dish of all time! He has been ordering it since we started dating back in the early 1990s. The flavor is always consistent and he always orders it for dinner. The chicken was tender and soaked up the addictive Madeira sauce. The mushrooms acted like sponges and absorbed the sauce as well. The mashed potatoes were creamy and had just enough lumpy texture of potato and red potato skin. Rating: 5/5 Cappuccino is double espresso and foamy steamed milk. I'm not sure what kind of beans that they use or if I'm just used to coffee in Europe, but the espresso used was very bitter and acidic. Even with sugar, the bitter bite just hits you like a freight train. Rating: 2/5 Chocolate Chip Cookie-Dough Cheesecake is creamy cheesecake loaded with chocolate chip cookie-dough and walnuts. The cheesecake was creamy and silky. The cookie-dough added a granular sugar texture and flavor. The chocolate chips can be hard as they were in the refrigerator but melt down pretty quickly on the palate. I also loved the whipped cream dollops sprinkled with even more chocolate chips. Rating: 5/5 Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple is creamy cheesecake swirled with caramel, peanut butter, Butterfinger and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. This is also my hubby's favorite cheesecake. He orders this cheesecake probably 90% of the time. It has all of his favorite flavors in it: chocolate, caramel, and peanut butter. It was very rich and decadent. He will usually take it home and will take two to three sittings to finish it. It goes great with a hot cup of coffee. Rating: 5/5"
Gerry B.,"Westminster, CA",986,557,569,3.0,2/19/2015,"We loved our evening meal at the Cheesecake Factory. We enjoyed it for many reasons...the menu was large with a great selection of drinks, appetizers, sandwiches, entrees, and desserts...all at a very reasonable price. We got two tap beers, fried calamari as an appetizer, and a couple of sandwiches, and spend a little over $50 with tip. Our server was polite, knowledgeable, and attentive to our needs...we didn't find many like this in most of our servers. The only minor complaint was the seating arrangement is cramped, but we came after supper rush, so it didn't take long for tables to empty out, so we had a bit more room. Overall, the food and service we receive was great, at terrific price! We highly recommend it if you are in or around the area of irvine spectrum."
Frank M.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,16,1,1.0,7/12/2017,"I placed an order with Door dash.  The food arrived 2 hours late, cold and not even correct.  Seems like this is a problem with this location.  I've ordered from other locations with no issue.  Maybe they need new management here"
Baleen F.,"El Toro, CA",48,26,4,2.0,11/14/2016,"My friend and I decided to split two dishes and ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad.  I cut a piece of chicken to eat and the chicken was rubbery or maybe even raw.  I shun my cell flashlight on the chicken, maybe it was pink, or maybe not.  My friend thought the same, so we both just stopped eating the chicken and just ate the salad.  Our server stopped by to ask how everything was and I couldn't give my usual answer, ""Great!""  I had to tell him about our issue with the chicken.  He apologized and later came back saying that the kitchen makes a few chicken and it just sits there, so it may be a bit rubbery (and old), so next time ask for new FRESH chicken. Are you kidding me?!?!? Why do we need to ask for FRESH chicken?  Shouldn't that be a given?  He said he didn't charge us for the chicken since it's extra.  Of course they shouldn't have!!!  The chicken wasn't even edible!"
Janet B.,"San Marcos, CA",364,361,358,5.0,6/29/2014,"My favorite location and favorite place to eat! Irvine, you have it right and you do it well!! I literally drive ALL the way from SanDiego just to come shopping here and well, we all know shopping works up an appetite so no matter what I end up eating here 9x out of 10! Hands down! This place is  gorgeous, huge and great on customer/wait service! Not to mention, I have NEVER had a bad experience or bad food ever reach my table. Plus- it's always immensely busy and they always seem to seat us pretty quickly! You guys are on it! And I love it. Right on the corner of valet service and halfway down the mall strip. This place is perfect and I can't help but brag brag brag about how much I love this location. Hands down my number 1 and hands down my favorite! No joke! I'll see you prolly tomorrow or the day after! Tuscan chicken- healthy and delicious!! That's my go to :-) and on the skinny menu!! ;)"
Kristen N.,"Rowland Heights, CA",301,11,15,4.0,12/18/2015,"I went here with my dad for lunch, and the food and service was great! Our waitress had a sense of humor which was nice! Food was terrific as well! Since it was lunchtime, I wanted to sit near the windows so we can enjoy some sunlight while we ate. They took us to the back where there were dim lights.. There was nobody around us. Im sure they have their waitresses and waiters that take turns on taking tables but it would have been nice if they asked which tables we preferred.. I ended us asking to switch our tables because I didn't feel very comfortable sitting there. They moved us, and the rest of our stay was great. I ordered the Santa Fe salad, which was a mountain full and it hit the spot! Can't forget about cheesecake! My dad and I ordered some extra cream on the side and they gave us a ton! It was wonderful haha"
Sadaf T.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/25/2017,"Yesterday, i went to this restaurant with 5 of my friends. Had the worse lunch experience ever!! 3 out of 5 of the dishes had to be returned because most of them were either over spiced, burned, or tasteless. We asked for the manager and she showed up after 20 minutes. This manager did nothing but giving us attitude and refused to  refund one of the dishes and didn't bother coming back to check how we're doing!! After 1 hour wait, the waiter brought the steak dish and it was literally nothing, but pieces of burned meat!! You couldn't even chew it! The other dish tasted nasty even though we asked for a simple chicken breast dish with a side of orange sauce!! we explained to the manager that the chickens seemed to be frozen and had no salt/pepper!! The manager gave us attitude and didn't do anything about it! I mean if you work at a famous restaurant like cheesecake and you can't cook or manage a simple chicken dish, then you're absolutely in a wrong place!!Horrible food, horrible manager!!!! would never go back to this place!!"
Jean S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",11,3,3,5.0,3/6/2016,I always sit at the bar so I don't have to wait to be seated and the bar staff is excellent. A great set of characters who love what they do and make you feel welcomed every time.  Food is always excellent. They will gladly make you whatever even if it isn't on the menu as long as they have the ingredients. And if there's a problem they'll bend of backward to make it right.
Molly C.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,16,,5.0,5/24/2017,"It's rare when I have the time or energy to review a restaurant, but truly feel this needs to be done! My little boys was given student of the month today at his elementary school, and chose Cheesecake Factory as his all-time favorite place to have a special mommy date night He never expects awards, as school has been tough for him, and tonight I vowed to celebrate the accomplishment. He didn't want to wait, and asked to sit in the bar area. Terry, our wonderful server, immediately asked what brought us in, and kindly congratulated my son, and made him feel like he was beyond special. She really was overly kind I mean, honestly, it was unexpected to have a waitress in the bar area welcome a 10 year old, compliment him on his school work, and later tell him Cheesecake Factory was giving him a dessert of his choice, which he decided would be a Vanilla milkshake! That kid looked like he'd been crowned the king!!! Eating his wontons and drinking a milkshake he said ""mom, Terry is the best waitress I've ever had""!!!! Insane!! Just an average Wednesday night that a waitress chose to show incredible kindness His tough school road makes this even more impactful. Thank you Terry....so glad I let him choose the spot"
Nam N.,"Orange, CA",1,71,,1.0,9/5/2016,"Had our food delivered. Not trying to be rude but food was absolutely horrible. Everything came soggy and the salad was so soggy it was like mush. Had to throw away right when I received it. Also asked for a side order of bread and never received. Ordered dynamite shrimp, avacado rolls, onion soup and Chinese chicken salad. For $50 it tasted like the on sale deli food at Ralph's that's gonna expire in one day."
William A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,14,6,5.0,8/14/2016,"Jerrod was our server. Make sure when you come out here to ask for this guy and you will get exceptional service. Kept us laughing and a smile on our face. Is good to talk with, down-to-earth got our food out super quick. I'll keep coming back and look for this server as for the service is just as important as the quality of the food. Made for a good date night with my wife"
