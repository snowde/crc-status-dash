Daisy R.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",107,3,1,5.0,11/4/2016,"Being the first time at the Cheesecake Factory outdoor bar, I couldn't decide what drink to order. So I asked the bartender what she recommended and she advised me to get the Strawberry Martini. Thanks to her I had one of the best martinis I've ever tasted. It tasted like a fresh sweet strawberry. (Recommended bartenders Jacob and Sherri)"
Feeras W.,"Oceanside, CA",3,4,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Manager was the worst ever, bad attitude, poor Managment skills. Unfortunately cheesecake has good food but bad manager for this branch."
Julian T.,"Long Beach, CA",487,371,728,3.0,3/25/2014,"I've come here for birthday dinners, group outings, and dates. Food is decent, service is decent, atmosphere is decent.  Everything is pricey for what it's worth, although the plates are really large. Some things are a hit and miss though.  Jambalaya Cajun pasta is good! Lots of shrimp and chicken  Fire roasted Chile rellanos are DELICIOUS stuffed green peppers that are fried in a salsa.  Pot pie was ok when I had it.  Steak Diane was good too, not the best I've ever had Drinks are very strong.  What really bothered me is that they don't include gratuity on the receipt BUT the waitress did handwrite a recommended amount to be tipped.. Which was OVER 20%. Service was decent, but not that good... We ended up tipping more than the recommended amount, but it was awkward and actually want to tip less (considering we tipped more than $60)."
Jessica A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,7,,3.0,5/16/2017,Mothers Day wait took 45 minutes for pick up and we called ahead the jambalaya was not good. The cheesecake was amazing that never changes
Fran C.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,26,1,3.0,12/13/2016,The wait time here is longer than the other cheesecake factories. But the food and service is good. We like to eat inside here.  Because patio service is too long a wait. I really like the lite menu portions and calories are good and the food doesn't lose its flavor.  I try to go after lunch crunch or before  main dinner time 6:30 pm.
Jessica W.,"Irvine, CA",25,79,69,4.0,8/22/2015,"Incredibly busy on a Friday night. If you're expecting a quiet dinner, don't come here. The hustle and bustle of all the waiters and people getting up to leave or be seated makes this place very chaotic.  Our waiter was attentive and always filled our waters. He brought us bread twice too! I got the meatloaf, which was delicious!!! Ended up not finishing it (of course), and took it home. My boyfriend ordered the parm chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed.  Overall, we had a good experience. We've gotten their cheesecake slices to go that were delicious."
Giz S.,"San Diego, CA",19,71,44,2.0,12/28/2014,"While the servers are mostly nice, they aren't attentive one bit. You're lucky if your waiter makes more than two appearances - once to take your order, and once to bring you the check. The menu items are pretty tasty and the atmosphere is nice, but service is what kills it. Also, we've noticed that the plastic glass water mugs are always cloudy, dirty, or have crap floating in them. On Sundays the water smells like eggs, and you're lucky if the silverware is 100% clean."
Poblanito N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",22,26,10,5.0,5/22/2016,"Great Service, Rico was very polite with our family and his integrity is phenomenal. Food was great I highly recommend this place. Rico is very watchful."
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,4.0,1/13/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory (CF) location is memorable to me because THIS is where I first tried the gourmet mac and cheese appetizer. My cousin had actually ordered it for her dinner, but it was seriously love at first bite. She prefers no-fuss, no-frills, straight-up mac and cheese (like the no-nonsense Kraft box kind), but I don't mind a little gourmet twist on my mac and cheese (panko crust, bacon bits, you name it). Thus, she wasn't too thrilled about her gourmet mac and cheese (which came in a bowl at that time), but I quickly devoured her leftovers! But I digress. I've only been to this CF location once, when I met some of my family members for dinner, but I remember being served quickly, and this CF restaurant seemed especially clean and nice because it was located in the Spectrum. I think we went for a pretty early dinner on a weeknight, so the eatery wasn't too crowded. The food tasted great, as usual; what we ordered was consistent in taste and flavor and dishes we ordered previously from other CF restaurants.  Here's what I would recommend: ""Fried Macaroni and Cheese"": This gooey, cheesy mac and cheese mixture gets even better when deep fried and covered with a thin, crispy crumb layer. Cheese simply oozes out of the shell with every bite (truly a must for cheese lovers). The four mac and cheese balls are served with a creamy marinara sauce (not a very strong tomatoey taste) and bits of shredded cheese on top.As mentioned previously, this was actually the first CF restaurant at which I discovered this amazing appetizer dish. It changed my life forever ... in fact, now I often order it as my meal! ""Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake"": This is the BF's go-to and I always manage to get a bite of this cheesecake before he devours it all. Though it's not my favorite--since my favorite candy is Reese's, not Snickers--I would have to say that this cheesecake is in my top 5. It features chunks of the Snickers Bar baked right into the creamy cheesecake and it's topped with fudge and caramel. I also really like this cheesecake because (similar to the Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple) it features that crumbly OREO cookie crust. I love chomping on the candy bar bits and the fudge and caramel add the perfect finishing touch to this delectable treat. ""Warm Crab & Artichoke Dip"": Spinach and artichoke dips are probably my favorite appetizer, but TCF changes things up a bit but including crab in its rendition. No joke. This app features a blend of crab, artichokes and cheese served warm with grilled bread. Now, I love spinach, cheese and artichoke dips, but when you throw pieces of fresh crab in there, you take that dip to an entirely different level. I hope this dip is super cheesy--like, filled with gooey, melted cheese--and I can't wait to taste the accompanying grilled bread, too. ""Linda's Fudge Cake"": I always see this colossal cake in the cake display case by the bakery/to-go area, and I always, always wish that I could try it ... but I always get a cheesecake from dessert. However, if I did order something other than cheesecake for my dessert, this is at the top of my must-try list. It features layers of rich chocolate cake and fudge frosting. As a chocoholic, nothing sounds better! This is a straight-up, no-fuss, no-frills chocolate cake. No nuts, almonds, whipped cream or other toppings to get in my way. I'm not sure when, but I do want to indulge in this super chocolaty treat one day. ""Brioche Breakfast Sandwich"":  This breakfast sando features some of my favorite ingredients, making it one of the many items on my must-try list. It includes scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, ham, melted Cheddar cheese and mayo (I would get it without that grilled tomato) in between slices of grilled brioche bread. It also comes served with potatoes. I've never had TCF's potatoes yet, but I'm sure it comes with plenty of savory flavor and just enough salty taste. This breakfast sandwich sounds absolutely stellar with all those components ... I might just lapse into a food coma after partaking in this savory feast. Definitely an entrée I would want to get if I were in the mood for something savory to kick off the day. ""Monte Cristo Sandwich"": If I ever go to TCF for breakfast again, this is what I would want to try. It's not every day that you find a restaurant with Monte Cristo on the menu! This version features crunchy French toast that's stuffed with bacon, grilled ham, melted Swiss cheese and grilled ham. It's then dusted with powdered sugar and served with strawberry preserves. I don't care much about the strawberry component of this dish, but just reading the menu description already has me drooling. I haven't had a Monte Cristo with all of these components--usually it's with ham, cheese, the thick egg bread and powdered sugar--but because there's bacon and scrambled eggs in this version, I'm definitely looking forward to trying it one day."
Rosemary T.,"Tustin, CA",533,677,2406,4.0,12/11/2013,"What's good here besides cheesecake? Well... nothing really except for the shepherds' pie and their flavored mojito and their red velvet cheese cake.  They are one of the few restaurant that opens until 12:00am in the Spectrum. Came here on a late night getting something to eat with some drinks.  That night, only drinks happened. Got pomegranate mojito which is my favorite. The drinks are perfectly mixed so it's not too strong and not too sweet. I also decided to try another one of their flavored mojito... can't remember the right now.... it's yellow and it's delicious.  Oh, my friend also gotten angle air with shrimp that night. The shrimp are perfectly cooked, fresh and yummy! I only wish we had a few more of those shrimps. The sauce was tomato garlic, which was light but favorable.  Tip: Rush hour are everyday during 5 ~ 8."
Ashley M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",13,214,12,2.0,9/21/2016,"Came here today for a late lunch, this place was pretty empty with alot of people just standing around talking, we were waiting forever to order and to get our food, refills on drinks and for our cheesecake.   I order the Cuban sandwich with a salad with ranch and they tossed the salad in some kind of vinegratte  and the brought the ranch on the side, told the waiter about the salad that I said with ranch not this vinegarette sauce but he never brought out a replacement. They also had dirty utensils at the table.   I've ordered this numerous times from the cheesecake factory at the shops in missing viejo  and never had this problem.  I don't recommend this location at all they don't care about there customers, we will never ever come to this location again ...go to the location at mall at the shops in mission viejo."
Andrew D.,"Tustin, CA",33,46,278,4.0,1/3/2015,"It has been about a year since the last time I went to this Cheesecake Factory. About this time last year, I took my wife there for her birthday dinner. Without going into too much details about that visit, it was a disaster. Our waiter completely forgot about us and essentially ruined my wife's dinner.  So, yesterday was once again my wife's birthday and I wanted to take her out for dinner. This is an important birthday, it's my wife's 30th. She got a giftcard for Cheesecake Factory for Christmas and she decided that we should give this location another shot.  I walked into this trip with a very critical eye. I was not about to let anyone ruin this birthday for my wife. Once we were seated I started paying attention to all the details that matter (how long does it take to be greeted, are our drinks refilled, etc...).  After waiting less than 30 minutes to be seated, which was fantastic for a Friday night, we were seated and our waitress Brittani came over very quickly and got our drink order. Here's what made me know this was going to be a great trip, upon looking at my wife's ID, Brittani noticed that it was in fact my wife's birthday and wished her a happy one. Major points! We ordered dinner soon after and it came out pretty quickly. She ordered her favorite item on the menu, the Chickeb Bellagio. I changed things up and ordered the Hibachi Steak. It was awesome. Delicious mashed potatoes with a wasabi butter. The steak was great and cooked perfectly.  Of course, we ended the night by sharing a slice of cheesecake. Brittani in all her fantastic insight, brought a few coworkers with her to deliver the dessert. They sang happy birthday to my wife, which, while typical for a restaurant, meant a lot to me, considering how rough things were last year.  The only thing I can complain about was that one of the napkins on our table was stained with lipstick. It was a little gross, but they replaced it for us.  Overall, a very fantastic trip and we will be back for sure. Much sooner this time."
Charley H.,"Chico, CA",16,64,18,3.0,1/30/2016,"I usually don't like reviewing chain restaurants, but last night was an exception.  we visited last night and during our ""10 minute"" wait (actually 35) we decided to have some cheesecake from the case.  At the counter, Laura was not helpful to my mom and my siblings. She couldn't answer any questions and would not move from her stance (leaning her head on her hand against the counter-- very professional) On the way to the table the manager who we mentioned what happened w Laura. He told us Ashely would take care of us and he was sorry.  Ashely was attentive and friendly, with good recommendations!  At the end we saw Laura again, and after 2.5 hours had passed she was still a bitch.  Bad night or bad life?  Word to the wise: Find a new job where you are not as unhappy."
Vivian V.,"Walnut, CA",258,58,86,4.0,2/13/2015,"Way too many kids come to the spectrum. Cheesecake factory's food and service was superb. I had the farfalle chicken pasta- SO NOMS. I was having a nice dinner with my friend and we were seated next to a table full of boys. They kept pestering us (saying excuse me/asking us if we wanted to try their food), introducing themselves, cussing loudly, talking extremely loudly with no regard to anyone in their vicinity. It was ridiculous how these boys had NO manners and were a bit harassing us because.. We were women. That's not cheesecake factory's fault, obviously but that personally made the meal less than 4 stars. Otherwise, the food was great!!"
Angelena G.,"Orange County, CA",42,79,43,3.0,3/2/2016,"I usually enjoy TCF very much. This night, my service was great but the food was far from it. Our order came out after a long while, a looong while. But the server was attentive throughout, and very friendly. The chicken Madeira was brought out first, with a smile. Delicious as usual. A few minutes later, the turkey avocado sandwich, not by our server, was slid in front of me with such force that the sandwich slid across the plate, no smile, no ""Here ya go"", nothing. And the bread could have been a cornerstone in the house I dream of building one day. I couldn't even tear it, it barely bent. You know the way a bun looks if you microwave it? It gets wrinkled and shrunken. It was doused in some butter flavored something. Yuck. They took it back, with apologies, and very quickly brought out another. Very quickly. The bacon was less on the 2nd 'wich, but the bread was softer. Still microwaved. A mom knows microwaved bread. NOT toasted as the description tells. Still drenched in ""butter"" flavor. I couldn't eat it. Just completely disappointed. The manager gave us a free dessert. Thanks, unbeknownst to him it is my birthday, so that was something. I think this is my first food let down at TCF in the 10 years + we've been diners. The food is always good, and we've been in FL, NC, and all over SoCal. Blah. Lemon drop martini and mojito were on point though. But not good enough that I don't miss having dinner tonight. I brought it home thinking one of my kids would like it. Nah. Waste of twelve dollars. It was something I'd expect from Panera Bread. And I don't go there, so......"
D S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/26/2016,I 'm having great experiences at the Cheesecake Factory.  The main menu is huge with so many choices its hard to decide BUT there is another menu to choose from called the Skinnylicious  Menu.  It has great selections of lower calorie and healthy foods.  I have been there several times trying different salads from that menu. All of the salads I tried were delicious and filling. I liked that I could enjoy good food and feel full with less calories. The salads I had were all under 500 calories. I have also had very good service.  I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory. I for sure will go there again.
Jessica W.,"Irvine, CA",113,112,143,3.0,1/6/2015,"Cheesecake Factory for lunch is a silent agreement to satisfy a large variety of cravings in one sitting.  Today I tried the pink lemonade and ahi tuna carpaccio appetizer. There's excellent. There is good. And then there is Cheesecake Factory! It's edible, drinkable, not the best I have ever had but certainly not the worst.  Watch the calories! Don't say I didn't warn you."
Jeff N.,"San Clemente, CA",94,118,97,4.0,7/15/2015,"Cheesecake is 5 stars, always delicious and creamy.  The restaurant is 4 stars, lots of choices...  I like the pasta dishes.  My favorite is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta! The restaurant itself is amazing, a nice ambiance!"
Chelsea C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",11,78,132,4.0,7/19/2016,"The new outside bar is amazing! We had drinks out there and the service and ambiance was great! Their menu is large but I recommend the ca cheesesteak or the Chinese chicken salad. Their lunch menu ""Renees special"" is great as well. We have had awesome servers outside on he patio I highly recommend coming to check it out !"
Michelle Ann C.,"Boston, MA",54,139,218,4.0,4/11/2015,This is usually the default place to go to when we're at Irvine Spectrum and we can't decide where to go. Definitely come for the lunch special rather than having to wait half an hour to an hour for dinner. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is amazing! Totally worth every penny!
