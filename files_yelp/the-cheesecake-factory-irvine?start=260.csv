J T.,"Fullerton, CA",11,501,49,4.0,3/21/2016,"We have been to numerous Cheesecake Factory Restaurants. This location is decent with plenty of parking within the Irvine Spectrum. The wait is always long since this place is always packed. At least, you can walk around the shops while you wait.  The service is always great. We love the classy decor. The Thai Lettuce Wrap is amazing. I order this item every time. Of course, the dessert is great but $10.00 per slice is a little steep. We love the Mint Chip Cheesecake and Pumpkin Cheesecake whenever they are in season."
Linda K.,"Corona, CA",15,51,48,1.0,11/21/2016,"On 09/14/16, members of our family dined at the Cheesecake Factory in Irvine, CA. We had just attended the funeral of my beloved Mother at a nearby cemetary. We chose this restaurant due to it's convenience and ability to please all members of our group with a variety menu. Once seated, we began to notice 'gnats'. A few at first, but as we waited for our meals it was apparent the 'gnats' were not diminishing in number. Mgmt was notified, Â offered to relocate our entire group, but, not with a guarantee we would not deal with the bugs in another area. Mgmt informed us that the restaurant was due the following day to receive a 'monthly' bug treatment, and was very nonchalant about the ordeal. We tolerated the gnats, we ate our meals and then received the bill, $375.57. Nothing deducted. While waiting to pay our bill, members our family used the restroom facilities. As they walked down the hallway where restrooms are located, they passed by a small wait-staff area. There they noticed the parmesan cheese that had been grated upon several of our meals. It was uncovered and had GNATS on it! We watched our waitress go to thy area of the restaurant to retrieve the block of parmesan when it was requested. There is no doubt it was the same cheese!. Anyone had access to that cheese, yuck! If that wasn't enough, the cheese is in plain site of everyone, adults, children...bugs. Mgmt gave me a $50 gift card after all was said and done. I expected a refund after that nonsense and health department violation filled experience. I have contacted the corporate office. Waiting for a response. I did tip the waitress $75.00 ,after all she was just following protocol of the restaurant."
Amy G.,"Laguna Hills, CA",107,20,2,1.0,10/16/2016,"Literally the worst place ever. The Christophe guy whatever his name is did a horrible job, 20 minutes just to get my drink? Another 30 just for an order? Another 30 for 2 salads to be brought out? Yeah he's more focused on his looks than his service."
Frank R. K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",102,118,875,5.0,6/3/2015,The food is great. Cheesecake Factory still excellent. I suggest not to have the Garlic Cheese Bread if you want to have some cheesecake  Than Carbonara with grated parmesan  In the end we forced ourselves to have some Strawberry Cheesecake  Yummy. Our waiter was really nice. He brought lots of boxes for doggie bags All in all a great last evening for my friends from Vienna
Steven N.,"Orange, CA",41,79,137,4.0,1/24/2016,"The food and service are great. Our food did came out to us very quick. That was awesome because we thought it would take a lot longer. The only thing I can complain was that I kept raising my hand for the check and no one realize it. But, I would still come back again."
Rachel B.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Obviously it is going to be crowded, and their is not anything that they can do to prevent that, but the food took way to long, and the waitresses where very unprofessional and food was not even that great. Not impressed. Also the bathroom was ABSOLUTELY discussing. So if you do go here, be cautious. The only thing that was okay was the cheese cake itself, hence the name."
Lin N.,"Placentia, CA",17,10,4,5.0,11/13/2015,I love going here and the food and service is always wonderful. I had dinner here the other night and I need to compliment the way they handle their customers.  Our entrees were not brought out at the same time and they immediately informed us of their mistake. The manager delivered the second plate himself and apologized for the inconvenience and comped my husbands dinner. To me its the way you handle situations that shows you what real customer service is all about!
Edgar R.,"Lake Forest, CA",19,16,8,5.0,5/10/2016,We came here to celebrate mother's day with my wife and mother in law we enjoy lunch and the sever name Angela was very nice and friendly to my family we will come back again. The food and the service was great
PAIGE W.,"Dana Point, CA",704,26,42,1.0,8/4/2016,"I just had THE WORST EXPERIENCE WITH THE TO GO AND THE MANAGEMENT HERE. Who gives you an answer of I don't know when your food will be ready , a better answer would be shortly not I don't know . They messed up my order I called to correct it . Then I come back and after thirty min my second order still wasn't ready . The manager doesn't seem to care. They are a huge chain that will always get customers so who cares about customer service right???!!!! Seriously step it up and your management . Eleven just a smile and I'm sorry makes things better . And angel hair with butter and Parmesan shouldn't be that hard. But the attitude was the WORST"
Marina B.,"Irvine, CA",1,17,4,1.0,7/24/2016,"I usually come to this location because I like the Irvine Spectrum area. Came here a lot of times and I have never had an experience this bad. The table was dirty, the menu was sticky, and the servers were lost in the restaurant. We started being served by a girl and suddenly a guy came to help us, nobody told us anything. The drinks took a long time to arrive, no water was served or asked if we would like some. We ordered the fettuccini alfredo pasta and the coulotte steak with fries as we always do. The sauce in the pasta was nothing like alfredo, there was also too much persil which I haven't seen before, at least not on the ones I had at the Cheesecake Factory before. The coulotte was way too much rare. We normally have it medium rare which comes in the perfect way, not too much rare and not too much dry. But this time it was completely rare, it was bloody inside and burned outside. We asked the server to make it a little bit less rare, and when it came back it was still the same way and the server told us that when we order medium rare that's how it comes. I'm sorry but we came here more than ten times, for sure, none of the times we were here the steak came like that.  I do not recommend this location for both service and taste reasons. For sure not coming back to this location."
Nicole W.,"Denver, CO",254,1723,580,4.0,11/22/2013,"I know it's a chain, and a chain at the spectrum - oh my! But i love Cheesecake factory. I used to come to this location for every birthday with my close gal pals! Most recently we popped in for some HH action! The ladies behind the bar were fabulous! The deals at HH are fabulous! And my fav beverage the the JW Lemonade (i can never remember if it is jw or jd, i just know it's yummy and there is sugar on the rim!) Avocado egg rolls are also my most fav appetizer and they are on the HH menu as well! All in all, for a friday the bar was pretty open, and the staff wasn't overlly stressed or overlly pushy, great night!"
Krystle B.,"Irvine, CA",140,138,382,2.0,12/18/2015,The food was overwhelming salted. I didn't know whether I was eating pasta or sodium. The wait to get seated wasn't that bad but when we ordered our food it took forever to come out. Needles to say I won't be coming back here. If you want to come to a place where the waiters don't check on you and the food is salty then please come here.
Jake J.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,19,1,1.0,4/13/2017,"45 minutes to get food and one of the 4 dishes was burnt. Tell the waiter who has to check with his manager who had to ok making it again, it seemed. So we wait another 15-20 min to get a 'new dish' all the while the waiters and manager make it seem like they're doing us a favor by making it new. It was burnt! Waiter asked 3 times if replacement dish was better. Of course it's better! It's not burnt! Aside from a condescending apology from the manager, no other form of compensation offered. This location has really declined in its service over the years. Service was poor on a Thursday night with it not being a very busy night."
Justine T.,"Irvine, CA",87,6,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Terrible service! I came in for lunch with my family & Michael C was our server. After he brought us our drinks & finally took our order he ignored us for the next 45 minutes, no refills , didn't check on us or even look over at our table for us to get his attention. We then went up to the front & complained to the hostess after asking for a manager. The food finally came out after we had been sitting for about an hour after we ordered & my moms cheeseburger came with no cheese. When Michael came to check on us my mom simply asked for a piece of cheese for her burger. He took the burger & as he was walking away rolled his eyes! SO RUDE. didn't apologize or anything. So we asked for the manager AGAIN. this time he came to our table, we explained to him what happened and he said sorry & that Michael rolling his eyes was unacceptable . Michael then continued to check on us after that but with an attitude. When he brought the bill we expected a little something for the inconvenience & poor service but nothing. the manager never came back over to check on us nor did michael ever apologize. worst service i've ever had & i will definitely not go back here after poor management. very disappointed ."
Cash S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,11,1.0,9/7/2016,"The wait is long (over an hour for 2 guest). The food was horrible. No fancy plates on our table. Our table was filthy. The waitress forgot our drinks, so we had to remind her once we received the bill. The only thing worth going for is the cheesecake. This place has too much status for their employees to not really care about providing good service."
Rosa L.,"San Diego, CA",405,36,51,3.0,3/7/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! Although service can be hit or miss with the host/waiter, the food is still amazing. This particular location is always crowded so prepare to wait if you're going there on the weekend (especially with a big crowd)! My favorite appetizers are the buffalo blast, macaroni cheese balls, crab cake bites, or the calamari! You can't go wrong with either! Especially with the buffalo blast or the macaroni balls! As for courses, I love the Louisiana chicken pasta or the chipotle chicken pasta! As well as the shrimp scampi and steak Dianne! It all depends on what you're in the mood for."
Carrie U.,"Irvine, CA",609,1041,701,1.0,6/27/2013,"I came here for the first time in a long time today. I ended up not ordering anything though, and here's why.  I asked for a table and was given one that was in the process of being cleared. Because the busboy was rushed by the hostess, he did a half-assed job of wiping it down. There were crumbs and liquid on the table. We flagged someone down to get them to wipe it. No one came.  15 minutes or so later, after no one cleaned our table, and no one came to even ask for drink orders, we walked out. I told the hostess we were leaving, and why, and she said nothing. Not coming back, seriously I'd rather buy my previously frozen cheesecake at Costco."
Stacy F.,"Orlando, FL",1317,1460,7211,4.0,2/10/2015,"One of the restaurants that you can find within the Irvine Spectrum Center - this location has all the typical offerings one can expect from the chain. We have always had a good experience here. It's important to note that Thurs - Sun it can get really hectic inside of the Spectrum area in general, so having a reservation or being okay with a slight wait time is part of the deal. They have a good happy hour menu during the regular week so if you want to partake in that you'll need to find a seat at the bar.  Overall: A A good spot for the chain. Can get busy on weekends. Parking garage is your best option for a spot!"
P.A. H.,"Irvine, CA",0,41,4,5.0,4/4/2017,"Had dinner here tonite with two friends. Shrimp scampi, pasta primavera; wine, cheesecake (of course). Waiter was charming, professional, food was perfect and on time. Couldn't ask for more!!"
Chelsea R.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,9,5.0,3/21/2017,"I ordered a pasta dish with a modification and was generally dissatisfied. I asked to speak to the manager who kindly offered to make exactly what I wanted. Feeling like a brat after making a fuss over freakin noodles, I wanted to say thank you to the team who served me tonight. Y'all went the extra mile for me and I truly appreciate it. Thanks to my server Mike and Aaron, the MOD who helped me out!"
