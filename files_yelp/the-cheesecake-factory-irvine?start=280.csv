Samantha M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",13,7,2,1.0,3/18/2017,"My husband and I ate at this location on March 16th, we use to enjoy Cheesecake Factory food and drink, however we had not been in a few years. I can say we will never go again, this has nothing to do with the service our waitress was very attentive and polite. Nope, this has to with the food and drinks to start I ordered Sangria and my husband ordered their specialty Dirty Martini, my Sangria tasted of rotten fruit and my husbands martini of do dirty dish water. We did not finish our drinks, then the food, my husbands potstickers were soggy and over salted. The arugula on my salad was wilted and staring to rot, so I moved on to my chicken lettuce wraps, the chicken tastes old and was chewy, the salsa that came with the lettuce wraps was inedible like ketchup mixed with sour cream and red chili flakes. Needless to say the food and drinks were not worth the money that we paid. We will never return to Cheesecake​ Factory, not just this location, any location."
Nathalie C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,21,14,5.0,8/25/2016,I went there on my birthday for dinner with my family. The hostess Ashley welcomed us with a very warming smile. She was very professional and she knew what she was doing. She listened to us very well and took great care of us. She helped my youngest sister pick a pizza very patiently which i really appreciate. She checked on us multiple times and made sure we had everything we wanted. She was very friendly and seemed like she loved the job she does. Its one of the flvery few times that i get a great service like the one Ashley provided us with. I commend her for the great job she does. From a Very happy customer!!
Nathan K.,"San Diego, CA",63,78,13,3.0,1/16/2016,"When it comes to service at Cheesecake, it's just hit or miss, no matter the location. We beat the dinner crowd this evening and were seated right away. Devin was our server to begin with and she was excellent. Very attentive and pleasant the entire time. Then she was relieved by another server--Alicia, I think--who just wasn't up to snuff. Our food took much longer than usual to come out. I ordered the Crusted Chicken Romano, a popular specialty they have. Apparently, my order was served to another table by accident. A supervisor actually came by and apologized, which I appreciated. I wish more restaurants would this. It actually matters. Frustrating, in any event, when a restaurant bungles the basics. But the food was good and the outside patio heaters kept us toasty the entire time. Pretty average experience overall, which is sort of the norm here."
Tabi K.,"Orange County, CA",2,94,2,3.0,8/20/2016,"Standard Cheescake Factory experience. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it was fine. The service is pretty good, as well. They accidentally brought my cousin the wrong dish, caught their mistake, and brought her the correct one. They were very apologetic and we didn't have to pay for the additional dish."
Nalika K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,31,4,1.0,5/26/2016,"Seriously the most messed up Cheesecake Factory I ever been at! I'm literally 39 weeks pregnant...ok so 9 months 3 weeks. I get it I'm big! He's already 9 pounds! We go today right before 6pm with tons of tables available and they sit us in a little table 1/2 booth. I ask can I have a full booth it might be a little more comfortable. :) she replies....well if it's the distance between u and the table it won't make a difference! Um what? Ok I get it never mind....I'm a little embarrassed right now. So I see someone else pass and I say hey can we move over 1 table please...it's a half booth full table that way I can sit on the booth side and the table moves....oh let me check. Literally 4 different employees (the server, the first girl who sat us, and 2 other hosts) call the front to ask! To ask what?! There are literally 20 tables available! Never mind....I say, I don't want to put U guys out at all! I totally don't understand how there are so many tables and this is a big deal. I leave. I am embarrassed and they are ridiculous. We go to the Cheesecake factories all the time in Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and now Cerritos and have never been treated like idiots over a table. I am so upset. Now we are at a different restaurant who were as nice as can be! We even asked for a more comfortable table...of course no problem! When are u due? How exciting! THATS HOW YOU TREAT CUSTOMERS!"
Kevin L.,"Irvine, CA",21,313,200,4.0,1/7/2016,"I had not come to Cheese Cake Factory for a long time.  We had ordered Pasta with shrimp and sauage, Cajun  Jambalaya Pasta and a combination Plate of steak Diane and Salmon.  They were good.  We went there early, there was no wait.  We were seated right away.  When we left there were plently of people waiting in the lobby.  We sure glad we went at the right time.  It would not be right to leave this restaurant without ordering cheese cake.  We had the white chocolate rasberry truffle.  It was creamy and good."
Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1368,948,3941,3.0,3/24/2013,"DisapPOINted. (Kevin Kline in ""Fish Called Wanda"")  I have been to most of the Cheesecake Factory locations and this is not one of the best.  Love the interior, love the location, but the food has gone downhill. One caveat:  the appetizers are KILLER.  Next time that's all I'm eating. The Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes are so yummy that I could eat them every day for a month.  They melt in your mouth and the mixture of flavors is just simply heavenly.  We also had the crab and artichoke dip but it was waaay too fatty creamy.  Tasted good though, served with little pieces of toasted crispy bread. For the main course, Diane had the Cobb Salad.  It was your typical Cobb salad, with the chicken, avo, egg, greens, etc.  She liked it, nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Taco Salad. When it arrived I sat and looked at it.  Then I picked at it a little to see what was under the top lettuce. Not much.  Then I called the server and sent it back and ordered Chicken Marsala. Problem is, what I meant to order was Chicken Madeira, the best selling dish at CCF.  The chicken marsala was much less satisfying and I left most of it.  It was just the chicken on a bed of bow tie pasta.  But it was m,y fault that I ordered the wrong thing so I just contented myself with one piece of chicken (3 pieces of boneless skinless in all), and a big piece of cheesecake! We both got the Original Cheesecake.  I'm always hoping for cheesecake like I used to eat at the old Stage Deli in New York, had been going there since I was a kid until they closed.  But nothing compares.  The Original Cheesecake used to be really good:  a solid cheesecake with a big layer of sour cream on the top.  The inside part is now too mooshy, and the layer of sour cream is miniscule.  And the graham cracker crust doesn't taste as good either. Sheesh.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.  But I'll be back because this is a great meeting place and has a vibrant atmosphere."
Lisa M.,"Orange, CA",94,14,1,2.0,3/17/2017,"My friend and I went out Wednesday night for some time away from the kids. It was about 7:30 when we arrived and were told there was no wait (for them to then have me wait 10 minutes. Not a problem I just wish they would have told me it was going to be a ten minute wait.) We were seated on the patio. It took the waitress some time to come and see us, and when she did she was a little bit off. I am not sure if she was new or what was going on. I asked for a recommendation on a drink and she basically couldn't give me one. I ordered a small bite salad and the buffalo blasts and a glass of moscato. My friend had a Caesar salad. She got her drink and I never got my wine. By the time I was half way though the meal we also had not gotten any refills on water. She didn't come back until the end of the meal when we had to ask for more water.  Also with the buffalo blasts, it was like they weren't cooked right and in the frying process all of the chicken inside about half of them had fallen out because there was. I filling in them. It almost seems as though the cooks knew that was there case because there were big holes in the wonton, but they were turned upside down on the plate so you wouldn't notice until you picked it up. To make matters worse because the centers were kind of wet they stuck to the napkin that they had put on the bottom of the plate. It was just all around a bad situation, which is sad because it is one of my favorite dishes there."
Lisa A.,"Irvine, CA",143,587,113,4.0,12/28/2014,"So many choices, so little time. Portions are huge, and food is usually good. Tasted the cashew chicken and it was really good. I had the spicy chicken sandwich and it was delicious. Fries are mediocre, and definitely need something.  Hand cut fries, seasoning, something. Good for everyone, including cocktails, kids menu, and plenty of cheesecake choices!"
Viann C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",220,124,287,3.0,8/10/2015,"Only 3 stars tonight! Just got seated and the hostess kept saying my name wrong so I corrected her at least three times and she then says ""whatever.""   Ugh!  Not off to a good start! And I really like this place..... ! Hope the rest of the evening is better then the service.   Of course, a piece of Cheesecake will make it better."
Beth U.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,7,2,1.0,10/2/2016,"Save 2 1/2 hours! Got there at 6:30pm left at 9pm, slow. It was a birthday party for 3 people. We were told 1 and a half wait so we disbursed then the pager went off 15 minutes later which is great but our party had already taken off all directions to shop. So service was real slow, waitress did not know the menu. The first entree came out 15 minutes before the last, and the manager showed up at dessert time and then didn't even make things right. We will never go back! We were in fashion island location a couple weeks ago and that was fabulous. It's too bad, Cheesecake Factory is a good meeting spot for parties......there is something for everyone! Oh yeah and they sang happy birthday only to one of us and it was after the cheesecake was eaten."
Sophia H.,"Bakersfield, CA",29,46,7,2.0,5/7/2016,"Got our pager for table at 8pm, seated at 9pm. Staff is too busy and not able to be very attentive. It's 9:50 and we're still waiting on our food. I think things could be more efficient. The setting is VERY loud and crowded on a Saturday. Will update review once we try our food."
Nancy H.,"Westminster, CA",135,221,11,4.0,12/20/2015,"good and friendly waiters always packed on the weekends have to wait for a seat food here tastes good but quite expensive, but not small portions"
Mathew F.,"Anaheim, CA",26,32,1,1.0,2/25/2017,"Seated and waited for our waiter for approximately 15 minutes. Ordered 2 waters and 2 burgers, one of them being Kobe. Ordered side salad instead of fries. We get a new waiter whom asks us 25 minutes into our experience if we would like bread. Burgers come out...still no water. Have to ask for water.  Ordered side salad and instead fries come out(a little warmer than room temperature). Couple seated directly behind us 30 minutes into our stay gets water and attention immediately. Bite into Kobe burger(asked for medium) and it's well done. Finally get water...never offered a refill. $40 later we are headed out the door never to come back."
Luis R.,"Irvine, CA",139,46,6,5.0,5/23/2016,"As a business owner I can understand the challenges of satisfying the customer. Well today I took my daughter on a daddy date. Not only was she thrilled on how awesome the food was, but ""Comander Cody""  (our server) did an excellent job in service.  The food came out promptly and it was very good. We always have a great time when we come. Will be back again."
Nansy P.,"Tustin, CA",124,46,252,3.0,2/25/2015,The Cheesecake Factory!  I'm a cheesecake lover and it's a wander why I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  And I'm so use to small menus; I like smaller menus :)  And the menu at the Cheesecake Factory is so big and there's many things to choose from; with this said I asked the waiter what recommends and he tells me the shrimp scampi and Diane steak as a combination plate.  For dessert I order the original cheesecake.  The staff is excellent; wait time --Ok.
Stephanie D.,"Universal City, CA",51,8,1,5.0,9/7/2016,"I usually come here a few times out of the year and each time I do it's been great. However, this specific time I had the pleasure of having Jerrod J as our server and he was just phenomenal! I truly appreciate great service!! He was definitely interactive with us, funny and joking around, all while being attentive and on top of everything! After a long day of work in the customer service world, I truly appreciated the service that he provided! The food was a plus too, but the experience I had today reminded me to stay kind and pay it forward! Thanks Jerrod!"
Brice O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,1,5.0,9/7/2016,"If you need a review to try a restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory, this may not be the restaurant for you. Otherwise, you must be a Cheesecake fan and with a menu like this you can't go wrong. Johnny provided excellent and personable service. It's very refreshing to be welcomed and just feel appreciated as a customer in Orange County. Terrific service."
Mary Ann M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",209,279,30,4.0,1/19/2016,"This place is all of the above.  Clean, courteous servers, speedy service, good tasting food.  Favorites:  chicken marsala, avocado rolls, buffalo wings, and of course the cheesecakes!  Best cheesecakes IMO:  fresh strawberry, vanilla bean, and pumpkin spice.   Minus one star because this particular restaurant does not have the best layout.  The farthest round-shaped room in the back seems secluded from the rest of the restaurant.  Also the walkways are not wide enough and I found myself walking through the kitchen (a wide area parallel to one of the aisles, which I clearly mistook as an aisle to exit)."
