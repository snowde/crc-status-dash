Evelyn B.,"Santa Ana, CA",58,14,5,5.0,2/7/2016,"Excellent food service every single time! The Cajun Jambalaya is to die for, it's still great to eat later because I can never finish it. No matter how busy it is, we always get our food almost the same time we finish our bread basket."
Stephanie R.,"Corona, CA",41,59,4,4.0,5/3/2016,"I was suprised i did not have to wait in order to be seated since it is always busy. The server was very friendly and attentive. He checked up if we needed any refills and if the food tasted great. Overall, i had an enjoyable experience."
James M.,"Tustin, CA",4,12,11,5.0,9/2/2016,I waited a while to review this restaurant  and the time is now.The food here is the best. Every time I come here the food is great. The servers work hard to make sure you get what you ordered. Let's not forget the Cheese Cake. I will be bake again.
Asia U.,"Cerritos, CA",3,49,27,1.0,2/16/2017,they are so ridiculous here!!! came in an ordered 2 loafs of bread and the manager with the glasses and black hair said it will be out right away then a lady comes and says 10 mins after we sat down and already waited 10 mins!! then i told the guy i would come back so i came back 20 mins later and still had to wait 10 mins!! then the manager tells me sorry they burnt the bread and to top it off it is not fully cooked after i specifically asked for it to be when i ordered it !!! are they serious and it was not busy what so ever! came in at 3 pm & saw 6 workers just standing around just starring!! TO top it off there are no instructions on how to fully cook this bread!! Once I called and asked how long to bake it for the manager answered and offered to mail me a $5 gift card.... like no thank you am I suppose to buy another bread and wait another 20-30 mins for something not cooked?
Khoa H.,"Garden Grove, CA",8,66,27,4.0,1/24/2016,"Great service & great food! Very fast service, and super good food as usual. Highly recommend the Fried macaroni cheese, super delicious appetizer! Will be back very soon :)"
Dave B.,"Irvine, CA",8,38,,2.0,2/14/2016,"Our family has always been big fans of the Cheesecake Factory.  Our previous experience has been mostly the location on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki where we have always been really happy with the decor, service, food quality and selection, etc. The reason that this location gets only 2 stars is due to the relatively lower food preparation quality compared with what we are used to.  The Waikiki location we normally eat at has noticably better food.  In particular we noticed that the Santa Fe salad at this location was uninspiring compared with the same salad ordered numerous times in Hawaii.  It lacked flavor compared with the other location.  Similarly the Burrito at the Irvine location was dry and filled with rice instead of saucey and delicious as we have been used to at the Hawaii location.   However, the Strawberry Shortcake was really good in Irvine... at least as good, maybe better than the eqivalent version in Hawaii. We continue to like The Cheesecake Factory and will likely go back...we only wish that the Irvine location could step up their game in the kitchen a bit."
Ellie Q.,"Irvine, CA",54,100,150,1.0,8/7/2015,"So it's Friday night about 8pm and I call this place to ask how long the wait was for a party of eight. We wanted to celebrate a birthday dinner here. The spunky girl that answered says, ""That's considered a large party and I can't quote it over the phone. You'll have to speak to the manager in person."" ARE YOU KIDDING!?!  So we drive the fifteen miles there, deal with the crazy Irvine Spectrum on Friday night parking, and once we get in to ""speak to the manager about our large party"" he tells us it will be an hour and a half to two hours!!! That is so rude and such HORRIBLE customer service! Who makes up these stupid rules?!  Thanks a lot! We left of course and found a different restaurant that had the courtesy and consideration of answering the simple question over the phone.  I will never eat at this restaurant! Ridiculous management! Way to watch your backs and leave us hanging!"
Anna M.,"Irvine, CA",13,72,136,5.0,9/30/2015,"Service: on Sunday night got seated quickly. We choose bar area booth. Our waitress was very attentive. Food:  Started with some fresh bread: dark and baguette with some butter. Be careful not to fill up. Ahi Carpaccio - best thing ever.  Buttery Ahi Tuna thinly sliced with creamy avocado and tangy soy dressing. Bacon-bacon burger was so good. Full of flavor with light bunn and perfectly cooked crispy bacon. French frys were disappointing.  They were not as crispy as I  expected and lacked basic salt or any other seasoning.  Chicken Bellagio - was super exited to try on recommendation of waitress. The portion comes out rediculously huge. It is a meal for two. I wish they would offer half portion so you could justify a slice of cheese cake. Well, you started with lightly dressed arugula salad which is on top. Under I found two huge pieces of chicken.  Chicken was perfectly cooked with crispy breading. That's where positive ends pasta under chicken lacked in flavor. I had two small pools of sauce on the sides but nothing but greasy oily tasting pasta in the middle. Would not order again. Dulcet de Leche cheese cake - don't think about sugar and calories you will be consuming. Cheese, creamy,  salty heaven."
Erica H.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/10/2017,"Let me start with I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. Aside from it being on the pricey side, the food is always phenomenal and i'm always satisfied. The last time we went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum, we ordered lunch salads. Despite their being little to no people there at the time, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out. When it finally did come out, my friend's salad had a food sticker in it! We alerted our server, who took back the food to be remade and sent the manager over to speak with us. He apologized for it and let us know it was being remade.  After the remade salad came out, everything was fine with the food. We were there for about two hours and our server came around to check on us and refill waters only twice. After we left we were ticked that we had to pay for the salad that they left their dirty food sticker in, so we only left an 8% tip instead of the ""suggested 15%"". But to be fare, they messed up our food and the service was below average. Before I had even left the table the server came around and looked at the bills to find her tip-- while i was still putting my jacket on. My friends had already exited the restaurant, as i was leaving my server chased me down to let me know that her tips are taxed and we are supposed to tip at least 15%. I explained to her that i wasn't satisfied with the service and that tips are not mandated. She finally let me alone all pissed off. I finally left 15 minutes later after having a conversation with the manager there, Sal, who was also less than helpful regarding the situation."
Kimmy T.,"Lake Forest, CA",704,352,1672,4.0,6/25/2014,"Normally I like to support small businesses but it was my husband's birthday and he was craving cheesecake so he choose this spot and I couldn't argue. We parked in the structure nearest the movie theater and walked in.  I suppose you could valet for closer access to your car but we like a little spectrum stroll so the structure won. We walked in and there was about 10 people around waiting for tables but we only waited 10 mins or so - which I was thankful for since I got extra time to look at the menu. The novel-length menu gives me a mild anxiety attack every time.  Normally I'm a bit indecisive in ordering which is why I use my trusty yelp app to guide my restaurant endeavors but this trip my phone was dead so I asked our server what she recommended and she came back with ""Well what do you feel like?"" and all I could say was ""chicken"" so she directed me to the chicken page but I ended up throwing my hands up and letting my husband choose both dishes anyway.... go figure. If there's one thing I know about this place (besides the menu being 100+ entrees long) its that the portion is at least 3x the size it should be.  Thankfully, this trip around the menu stumped my husband as well so he and I agreed to share the two dishes he was between - it was his birthday after all. I ordered Cajun Jambalaya Pasta (Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini.) and he got the Chicken Bellagio (Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad). He doesn't normally eat greens so I got his arugula salad which was nicely dressed with a lemon dressing.  My Cajun Jambalaya was really delicious. I was actually very surprised that a chain could produce such tender linguini and the spice was just right... I wouldn't consider it ""very spicy"" like the menu states.  It was flavorful without blowing my head off or anything. My husband gave me a bite of his chicken bellagio and the prosciutto/chicken/basil pasta combo was very delicious as well.  I was happily surprised!  We both ate about half and took the rest home... the price reflects the portion - at least you know you're going to have a yummy lunch the next day as well! We ordered a piece of banana cheesecake to share and it was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness.  Sometimes cheesecake is too decadent to have more than 2 bites of... not this one. We definitely finished it. All in all, I was glad hubby chose this for his birthday meal.   I have a new respect for cheesecake factory and probably won't avoid it like the plague anymore... at least I know that I'll always have something new to try and I'll never exhaust the menu! :)"
John E.,"Seal Beach, CA",21,27,4,4.0,7/28/2016,Great service. Sunday afternoon. Favorite part of the meal was the Factory Salad. Thank you Michael!
MArina R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",15,8,3,1.0,8/9/2016,"I was disappointed on 8-5-2016 My 4 year old grandsons wanted a Chessecake for his birthday. So I went to Irvine Spectrum at 1 pm and all thier cakes are frozen ""Fully aware "" drove home to Orange and took it out  when it was time to sing  3 hrs later and it was falling apart literally the gram was stuck to the cupboard and it was not Fresh at all never again will I throw money that way very disappointed and checkout was at a crawl I was the only one ordering"
Joy S.,"El Toro, CA",2,29,10,2.0,6/1/2016,This place has really lost its quality.  We ordered take out and when we got home our Cobb salad has brown wilted lettuce.  Disgusting!  The other food was just okay.  I seriously wondered if the lights were dim in the kitchen to have served this food to us or if they just didn't care.  Guess we will be eating at CPK instead of CF from now on at the Irvine Spectrum.  Cheesecake seems to be the only thing good here anymore.
Ashley E.,"Orange County, CA",163,29,16,3.0,2/16/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here the day before Valentine's Day and had Stephanie as our server. We've had her before and she's not the friendliest. We were checked on only a couple of times and not offered what is always available. Food was good, service was OK."
Khadijah S.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,3,4.0,9/23/2014,"I go to cheesecake factory almost every weekend. Even though it gets busy during the weekends, the staff are always doing their best to serve people as fast as they can. The food is always great, and my fave dish would have to be the cajun jambalaya pasta ; perfection.  Also, I always try a different smoothie and all of them are refreshing, especially the peach smoothie. Yumm * gets dressed and heads to the place*"
Jo Ann D.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",13,49,19,1.0,5/26/2016,I ate here a few Sunday's ago and the food was so bad I couldn't eAt it. The place was so busy I felt sorry for our waiter so I didn't ask for my money back on the calamari . I thought I would write the Manager a little note with my receipt and it's been two weeks and I've not heard from them . I wanted them to write back with a apology before I went to Yelp . Oh well I guess their to busy
Kelley U.,"Lake Forest, CA",654,718,11379,4.0,9/29/2012,"We usually avoid eating at this restaurant at the Spectrum because it is usually always crazy busy and too long of a wait to eat here.  I had a gift card to redeem and we decided to grab some dinner here on a weekday.  Since summer season was over and we arrived early for dinner, we were seated right away and it was great! I do enjoy that their menu is basically a little book and there are many, many options for eats here.  Always helpful when you have a large group of people with varied eating preferences.  But it is hard to make a decision sometimes when you have so many choices.  I do enjoy their Factory Burger Kobe burger and decided to try the Mushroom Burger since it recently won their Glamburger challenge according to the menu.  I enjoyed the sauteed mushrooms and melted Fontina and Swiss cheeses on the burger.    A nice burger but I still think the Factory burger and Kobe burger here are my favorites.  The fries that came with the burger were awesome, perfectly good and straight out of the fryer.  Everything on the plate arrived piping hot to the table, so that was great.   It is a very rare occasion I come to eat here and forgo cheesecake, since i LOVE cheesecake, and they have so many wonderful varieties here.  We decided to split their featured cheesecake which was the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.     Our waiter described it as not too sweet but extremely rich.  That was a perfect way to describe it.  It had a bottom layer of chocolate cake and had a layer of cheesecake with Oreos in it, Oreo cookie mousse and chocolate icing with an Oreo cookie wafer on top and a dollop of whipped cream on the side.  OMG, it was heavenly.  A perfect slice.  Definitely one I would order again.  An Oreo cookie lover's dream and not too sweet.  Our waiter, Johnny, was outstanding.  He was working hard, serving tables both inside the restaurant and outside on the patio, but he was such a great waiter, super friendly, very informative, attentive on our refills and checked back on us often.  A definite standout as far as servers I have had at any Cheesecake Factory.  Always nice to get out on a weekday, have a good meal, outstanding service and end the evening with a yummy piece of cheesecake :)"
Mike C.,"San Diego, CA",863,1381,6483,3.0,10/11/2012,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's a good date night hang out stop for this location. It's pretty convenient since you can do other stuff too, like go shopping or watch a movie or something.  And I love their cheesecakes too. It's rich and fatty.  But you should do yourself a favor and never ever look at the calorie count of the stuff you eat here. You will be very surprised on how high these things can go up to. Take for example the Pasta Carbonara with chicken I ordered. Great stuff, super buttery, fatty richy goodness. My friend told me to look up the nutritutional value for shits and giggles on our way out of the restaurant, and it was over 2600 calories. I almost literally fell into shock...literally. For the next several hours, I felt like the whole world was spinning, that I was hallucinating and all that...and this coming from a bowl of some fatty pasta. Well, it was a good lessons learned. Don't look at the calorie count. It will seriously f you up. But the cheesecake helps though"
Doug L.,"Irvine, CA",6,14,7,2.0,7/27/2015,"Came here to celebrate mom's bday. Came late to meet little sister and mom after work. Went up to hostesses to ask where they were seated I get a ""you can just look around."" WTF is that? This place gets flow because it's at Irvine spectrum so I wasn't expecting much, but seriously?? I mean ain't your job to greet and say hello? I was so surprised I didn't even get upset at first just shocked followed by pure disappointment. HIRE BETTER HOSTESSES PLEASE. On a side note. Our server was awesome and food was what was to be expected.  3.5 stars for Food 5 stars for our server 1 star for the WORST greeting I've ever received when entering a restaurant. Date was 7/27/15 for management to reference."
Greg M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",5,61,7,1.0,7/5/2015,"Cold soup, wrong food served and it was a circus getting the right food as we watched our returned sandwich travel throughout the restaurant.  After complaining, manager did absolutely nothing. My worst experiences at a Cheese Cake Factory."
