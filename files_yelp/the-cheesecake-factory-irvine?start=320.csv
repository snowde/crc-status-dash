Emily H.,"Santa Ana, CA",10,8,30,3.0,9/21/2014,"What we ordered: 1. Fried Zucchini 2. Loaded Potato Tots 3. Cuban Rolls 4. Chicken Bellagio 5. Strawberry Shortcake 1. Always gotta get the [Fried Zucchini] when you go to the Cheesecake Factory! It's a good small snack. 2. The [Loaded Potato Tots] is definitely something different. It has a strong bacon taste so if you don't like bacon, this is not for you. But, nonetheless, this small snack is also extremely good. 3. The [Cuban Rolls] look exactly like egg rolls, just Cuban style on the inside. It's also a pretty good small snack if you're not too hungry. 4. The [Chicken Bellagio] was the most disappointing. Although the crusted chicken and arugula salad were delicious, the basil pasta underneath was not cooked to perfection. It was on the hard side and the sauce was not distributed evenly. On top of that, the pasta was stuck together so it was difficult to eat. It made me question whether the pasta was made to order and it just sucked or if they just had it pre-cooked. If I knew, I would've just ordered the chicken and arugula salad without the pasta. 5. The [Strawberry Shortcake] was good. Definitely not a normal cake you would imagine it to be."
Rachan S.,"Lake Forest, CA",320,685,1308,2.0,6/2/2014,Cheesecake: - Kahlua coffee cheesecake - too fluffy and couldnt taste the kahlua or cream cheese texture at all. its more like cake in a dense form witg whip cream. disappointed..  Price: - priceyy.. $8.10 including tax for a slice of cheesecake.. you could actually eat a good lunch meal somewhere else with this price. Service: - friendly. . i got my cheesecake in less than 5mins after i paid. no complain about it
Mark F.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/20/2016,Great experience at this branch! Great customer service by Adriana! She was very friendly and helpful. Thank you Adriana. Try their Alfredo chicken pasta and the original cheesecake
Charles R.,"Irvine, CA",163,167,271,5.0,12/11/2014,Great sandwiches and the fries were nice and hot. Our server Grace did an excellent job!!!
Nazek Q.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/1/2016,"When the waitress got us the drink I had to ask her for straws 3 times and she didn't get them. Likewise, I had to ask for bread and butter twice until I got it. Also, after I ate half my meal I wanted to take the rest of it to go and I asked for the check, after 45 min I finally got the check.. And when I asked for the rest of my meal that I requested to take home, she said that she threw it away :/ It was the worst experience ever."
L W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/16/2016,"Tried to have a nice celebration lunch today but Cheesecake Factory was awful.  Service terrible, took over 10 minutes to get water on a hot summer day.  Waiter was nice, but not good, never came back to check on us after we got our food (after waiting over 40 minutes) .  We asked him to check on the good, said it was coming, still another 15 minutes, and then one dish didn't come, we just cancelled the order and shared.   Good was unappealing to look at - frozen strawberries in the fruit salad?  Yuk.  Salad must have been tossed 2 hours ahead of lunch, soggy, not fresh at all. Had to flag down busboy to get check.  Our waiter was on the computer almost the whole time, never looking up at any of his tables.  So many places in the OC, won't be going here again!"
Carmen M.,"Chula Vista, CA",57,128,207,4.0,8/20/2015,Great food. Recommend the chicken Marsala I think that's the name. Very good!!! Love the location right at the corner so you can easily get valet and couple of steps to the main door. The service was great. The gentlemen that was our server was super nice and really informative on the allergy ingredients.. Since my son is allergic to dairy eggs and shellfish. The only reason why I didn't have 5 is because the lighting is too dimmed for me. I'm all for dimmed lighting but it's too much. lol seriously like u felt I needed to turn on my phone light. Other than that great food great service!!!!!
Britt P.,"Tustin, CA",134,5,,5.0,2/10/2017,Came here with my boyfriend on a friday night. Very busy but the server Mike was very friendly and made us feel welcomed and he was very well informed about the menu and gave us great customer service! Will come again
Emil C.,"Irvine, CA",413,1053,4118,3.0,5/23/2013,"Food: It's American food and cheesecake. Both are not my favorites, but you know what you're getting into when you come here to eat. While most of their food on their menu could be better, I do love their burgers. Everything is reasonably priced. My Order: Monterey cheeseburger with green salad (good) Kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake (good) Service: It's always good here. They are nice and attentive to your dining needs even if you have a big group. If they were rated solely on service, they would get 5 stars. Parking: It's the Spectrum. During weekends and meal times, the parking structures can get pretty crowded. Parking can always be found but sometimes you will need to walk a little more. Or you can valet which is right in front of the restaurant."
Cheryl S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,603,22,3.0,6/6/2014,"We didn't have great service, but the food was mostly good. We arrived around 5:15, and waited about 10 minutes for our waitress, Valeriya, to acknowledge us.  She wasn't very friendly. The baja chicken tacos were really good.  My daughter liked her pasta.  The broccoli was mushy and lacked any type of seasoning. When I needed a refill of water, my water glass sat at the edge of the table for some time before she noticed. In general, I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan, but didn't consider this to be a great experience."
Ivana D.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",5,35,214,2.0,7/18/2015,Ordered by phone and Kendall wasn't very pleasant. She was rude! She said 20 minutes and I was waiting at the curbside for extra 10 minutes!  Food is great I'm a fan but their customer service needs to change!
maria m.,"Gardena, CA",16,20,,1.0,6/22/2017,"I need to share this experience. My hairdresser that I have been going to for many years told me what happened to her daughter & her friend @ this cheesecake factory. It was very upseting. Her daughter & her friend were having lunch last week. She just recently graduated with Masters. It was a special time for them. Her freind had got up to use the restroom. Apparently a customer or someone from the restaurant followed her male friend in the restroom. While in the restroom, this person told her male friend ""He was too ghetto to be there"". This young American man, was told this awful racial remark. He said absolutely nothing to this poor excuse of a man. He had more class & honor than any human being. Just to let you know, this young man was a United States Marine, serving our country. This was disgusting to me. As I myself have a son who is a USMC. I will never visit this restaurant again, because of this treatment. I told my son the story & he said, ""Mom I guess he,was using his first amendment right."". The right that these young men have fought for, that he calls ""Ghetto""."
Yvonne L.,"Irvine, CA",53,41,14,2.0,7/27/2015,"First off, I love Cheesecake Factory and I've been coming to this location for at least a decade BUT today's experience had an extremely rough start. To the curly haired hostess in the front...you're literally  the first impression anyone has of the establishment. When you're rude, give out false information (aka tell someone there is no wait and then make them wait 30+ minutes), and talk smack about your customers openly... it really creates a very unpleasant experience. That being said the servers were awesome and the food was great as always. Maybe management can use the same hiring team for your servers for the hostesses as well."
Samuel C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",105,58,,2.0,10/15/2015,"I feel like friends shouldn't give their opinion. Just like every Cheesecake Factory, I feel like I asked to be abused in these places. We didn't go to Yardhouse bc that place was super crowded & outdoor area wasn't that impressive while the cheese cake factory had a better outdoor area. Waited with pager. After waiting for it to ring for 30 minutes, I had to wait more time for a person to seat us. Why page if we have to wait more? After waiting about 10 minutes, we were seated. Waiter took forever to come with simple water since I was super thirsty from waiting. I have given it a higher review than I was thinking of originally giving it since I felt bad for the overwhelmed waiters which I feel like they need more waiters to not have that experience. Plus, food wasn't over cooked or given a lot of salt like other Cheesecake Factories."
Brad L.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",100,2,,5.0,8/1/2016,Had Kenny as my server. Funniest guy in the world. Never had a server make my day and make me laugh so much. Just hoping I can get him every time!
Golnaz J.,"Irvine, CA",20,51,86,2.0,10/14/2015,"The last time I went to Cheesecake factory was 8 years ago. My girlfriends insisted on going couple of days ago! and honestly, I remembered why I tried to stay away from this place. It's too loud, too crowded, too Americanized! it's a sad environment really..  There are so many staff running around and mostly confused! The meat is not fresh and the fish frozen! The sauce tastes strange and I'm sure not made from scratch at the restaurant.  The only thing that is edible is the Ahi Tartar. it's fresh! I hate chain-restaurants, the quality is low. Eating is supposed to be fun and there has to be lots of time and effort put into it. This place is like a pig factory..  Oh, the brown bread is another positive aspect. So maybe go there for a glass of wine, the bread and the Ahi tartar! But dine elsewhere.."
Mei D.,"Irvine, CA",1,13,12,3.0,12/15/2015,"Very disappointing initial service. Was seated outside but we requested to be inside to avoid the cold and had an additional wait of twenty minutes when the hostess forgot to add us back onto the waiting list. Needless to say, we were not happy when we found out that we were waiting for nothing. Hostess even started back talking to us, claiming we never asked to be seated. Not even a single apology. Are people not trained before working here?  The upsetting interaction with the lady in the front made our moods sour, but I was lit with joy when they brought out the bread and butter. Truly a classic. If I want to justify eating a slice of cheesecake for $9, this bread would be my justification. And probably the best part of the meal. Hubby and I split the chicken fingers, which was sub-par at best. (You're probably better off getting some KFC on a Tuesday--take advantage of they Tuesday $1 special!) We barely ate half of it, as the mashed potatoes and diced vegetables (cucumbers, pumpkin, other types of weird squash) along with the rye bread filled us up. The cheesecake came and we were delighted. Server toppled over my whipped cream so my Instagram photo was delayed a couple minutes. White chocolate macadamia nut and cheesecake did not mix at all. All I could taste was the nut (and these buggers were huge!) and barely any cheesecake. I'm a picky eater but last time I recalled this was the Cheesecake Factory not the Nuts With Cheesecake On The Side Factory. Overall service was splendid from the nice gentleman. Water was refilled quickly and he constantly checked up on our emotional well being. If it wasn't for the disappointing cheesecake, which is their advertised speciality, I would have come back again just to eat more of that bread."
Al S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1218,173,340,3.0,5/10/2015,Good food as always but we had a very slow service. Took almost an hour and it wasn't even the busy time. I think it's a Cheesrcake factory thing.
Mohamad A.,"Mississauga, Canada",1,21,9,4.0,7/28/2016,"Only second time here, first was over 3 years ago. We ordered only fish and pizza since they don't serve halal meat. Loved the salmon and fish and chips. Wished they didn't cook their Herb Salmon with wine, it may have been a tasty choice."
Kris B.,"Oceanside, CA",399,602,4414,4.0,3/17/2013,"We lucked out and found seats at the bar, which was awesome because there was a 40 minute wait.  We'd spent almost the same amount of time trying to find a parking space at the Irvine Spectrum and were in dire need of a cocktail! These are the best potstickers ever! ($8.95) and also the calamari is pretty good too. ($10.95) I made the mistake of ordering from the Skinnylicious menu which was dumb because after all, this is the Cheesecake Factory.  Although their chicken salad is good, it's just not as satisfying as all the comfort food on the regular menu! Friendly service at the bar!"
