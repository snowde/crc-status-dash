Anna W.,"Newmarket, Canada",33,106,217,1.0,8/6/2014,"Worst service ever. Waited 20 minutes for two slices of cheesecake. The server had already taken out the slices and left it near the sink where several employees habitually washed their hands. The service was inefficient as they prioritized those seated, leaving a long line of customers who are ordering takeouts waiting a long time. In future, please inform your patrons of the wait time and seriously serve those in accordance with the order queue separating patrons who are eating in and those who are ordering takeouts."
John N.,"Bonsall, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/17/2016,"This place was horrible. It took 45 minutes to get seated. It took 20 minutes to finally we got to order anything. The appetizer came out with our main course. The steak was over cooked and was way to salty, couldn't eat it. The only thing that was good was the drinks and desert. The service and food is horrible. I do not recommend this place to anyone and I'm easy to please."
Jim M.,"El Segundo, CA",930,806,165,4.0,7/23/2015,This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory in a long time. We wound up here after dodging some rare July rain last weekend on an OC staycation and decided to come to the mall. We were seated in about ten minutes and the service was great. Food was great too.
Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",666,562,1974,5.0,2/19/2015,"I can't complain. I really like The Cheesecake Factory as far as restaurant chains go. Okay. Well, sometimes I am a little overwhelmed by their vast menu, but they have enough choices to the point I appreciate it - not to the point where I feel like I'm reading a novel. Hehe. Anyway, our server's name was Angela. She was friendly, nice, and knowledgeable. She brought out our drinks in a timely manner and kept them refilled. She even brought out water and food - bananas and bread - for my baby. (Thank you!) We ordered cream of mushroom soup, a hamburger, shepherd's pie, and lemon garlic shrimp. For dessert, we got the mango key lime cheesecake to share. All the food was delicious, thus making out visit to The Cheesecake Factory satisfactory!"
Taylor A.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,18,2,5.0,5/31/2016,"Had an amazing time with my wife here. Sean H. was our waiter and he absolutely did an amazing job. Absolutely flawless service, I don't know if you can request waiters but if so ask for Sean."
Shera B.,"Santa Ana, CA",9,14,6,5.0,9/27/2015,"Go for the Sunday brunch. The French toast and lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for delicious! No bottomless mimosas but just going for the food is worth it! For breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or drinks, I always get excellent service and the food is great!"
Renee G.,"Los Alamitos, CA",328,417,149,5.0,3/2/2016,Love this place and this location staff is great our waitress was wonderful the bartender was slow but poured a good drink the food was great and portions were good variety if cheesecakes are always amazing
Yona P.,"Irvine, CA",880,419,2167,3.0,4/28/2014,"Never dined in this location, I just stopped by to pick up a few slices of cakes. Review is based on flavor of two particular cake slices only, nothing about service, ambience, other foods, and cleanness.  I got the tallest chocolate layer cake slice and a slice of Adam's crunch peanut butter cheese cake to go. These two slices will last for a week. They are big, rich in flavor, and dense in texture. I hate whipped cream but they didn't put it on top of cakes so I scraped them off as soon as I got home. I wish they ask before putting whipped cream chunks because not everyone likes the cream.  The crunch candy was like butter finger orange colored candy piece inside Adam's cheese cake was very sweet, also light peanut butter colored cream chunk on top of cake was also too sweet and nasty. But cheese cake itself was tasted very rich cheese cakey, and the cookie crust was perfectly thin and crispy.  Layer chocolate cake was very rich and dense. It was sweet, but it was also good enough to satisfy sugar craving with just a few bites.  I am set for sugar craving for a while and the two big cake slices will last for a while as well. They are pretty pricey."
Andrew L.,"Irvine, CA",972,117,2262,4.0,7/30/2014,"Pros and Cons  Pros  1. Delicious food  2. Nice Decor  3. Lots of Seating 4. Good Location  Cons 1. Service can be slow at times I enjoy coming to the Cheesecake Factory a lot because their food is always delicious. The best dish they have in my opinion is their Cuban Sandwich which has ham, pork, pickles, and mustard.  Their Sunrise Fiesta Burrito is also very good as well.  The location is very accessible and easy to find."
Jeremy C.,"Cypress, TX",515,101,198,4.0,6/29/2015,Food is always delicious and service is great if for any reason something is wrong they fix it and comp your meal.
Mel R.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,3.0,7/4/2016,"Not my first choice in dining, but would be happy to go if invited with friends. Menu selection is good and probably why the restaurant is crowded.  From sandwiches to steaks, or ice-cream to cheesecake, there's probably something on the menu for every guest of your dinner party. I gave it a 3 star because the food itself is just okay and the service is hit or miss.  Though most of the time I have had good service once the food arrives; it's the long wait times to sit at a table or to finally get your food that take away from the enjoyment of eating here."
Ashley M.,"East Los Angeles, CA",37,60,13,3.0,5/14/2015,"The most unorganized Cheesecake Factory and restaurant overall that I've ever been to.  Waited about 20 minutes (I was told it was a 10 minute wait) and our beeper buzzed. Came inside and was told to wait on the side for my server... It's been an additional 15 minutes :) Group after group were being called with no response but they still waited for these people to show up when there's customers here that are ready to go. There has to be a better system but doesn't matter, we won't be returning."
Aaron D.,"Irvine, CA",5,9,1,5.0,7/2/2016,"The portions are big I haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory in over 15 years came with a friend I haven't seen in awhile, I have traveled all over the world , and had dinner at several fine restaurants. The food is awesome at the Cheesecake Factory. I can highly recommend  the Chipotle Chicken pasta and the Sheila's chicken and avocado salad . Our server armenica was the best she should be head server.  Don't forget to get the passion fruit mojitos to go with it and to finish off with the sea salted caramel cheesecake."
Tricia W.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",21,4,,2.0,12/27/2016,"We were told the wait would be 25-30 minutes, which was not a problem.  Buzzer went off, so we went to the counter.  We were told to wait on the tile.  Twenty minutes later we were still waiting!  The slip with our party's name was misplaced.  After we  brought this to the manager's attention, we were seated.  Waited 15 minutes for our drinks after ordering them (mostly waters). Ordered food and had to wait 25 minutes for that to be served."
Mike M.,"Long Beach, CA",18,12,,1.0,12/11/2015,"Attitude.   We walk in all smiles and on our runners high as we just finished a 5k down the road.  We walk up to the hostess kind of a short gal with dark hair she doesn't even look up from the computer screen she's just says how many??  Um.. Ok.. Party of four.   Again without even looking up from the computer screen she says - 15mins.   Wow! We sat down at the little bench seating near the hostess station. I decided to wash my hands before lunch and walk back up to her.  I asked where the restrooms were located and for the third time she refused to make eye contact, smile or even pretend that she's happy to be there-  she just says they're behind her or something.   I'm over this place and ready to walk but just then another gal says our table is ready.  We're hungry and decide to stay.   A different gal who brought us to our table said the rude gals name was Sylvia but who knows.  What I do know is this hostess is HORRIBLE. Our server was awesome and of course the food was good but our experience with the hostess ruined our $120.00 lunch.   Thanks Sylvia!"
Bashar I.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,5.0,3/27/2015,"I had great experience at the Spectrum's branch!  Kayla, our waitress was amazing!! She did great job in her recommendations and was very polite."
Michelle L.,"Irvine, CA",1223,1106,161,4.0,4/12/2012,"Cheesecake Factory. It's always been a place where I went with friends for hours of catch up over way too much food. It's always been a place where we stopped to eat after shopping and ogle at the rows of cheesecake and deciding before we even order our entrees what kind of cheesecake we are going to get. Maybe it's because I just have so many fond memories here, I find it really hard to dislike this restaurant despite the crazy long lines and food I get tired of eating half way through.  I've tried bits of everything here over the years and there is no doubt that the food tastes good. Yes its a bit pricey, but its huge so you can't really complain. My favorite here is the Chicken Carbonara and I usually stick to that now. I always want to get the cheesecake here but usually end up not getting any because I am simply too full. But the classic strawberry cheesecake is quite delightful.  Come here with your friends, grab a few drinks and laugh the night away. Or bring a lover. It's just as good. 4/5"
Tim D.,"Tustin, CA",139,1,,1.0,8/28/2016,"So I've always known the cheesecake factory had exceptional food, but this experience completely ruined any good taste in my mouth. Nothing wrong with the service in particular just the manager Wesley!  So, my fiance ordered a mojito and it came garnished with a fluttering bug inside. She told the waiter she did not want to drink it, because she is creeped out by bugs. The server trying to recover the situation naturally brought a new drink for my fiance saying it was ""on them"" and he was so sorry for the drink she received prior. All was well til the bill came and the mojito was still there ""not on them"". At that time my fiance brought it to the servers attention and he said that shouldn't be on there let me talk to my boss. So the boss came to our table of 12 and asked so who had the bug in their drink? So she responded ""me"".  Feeling somehow like she did something wrong. Then the manager Wesley responded sorry we don't comp alcohol.  So my finances uncle left to talk to Wesley privately and let him know they didn't care about the $11 dollar drink it was about them charging her for it even though they said they would take care of it. Then Wesley told her that she should have told a manager not her server that there was a bug in her drink.(once again she feels she has done something wrong). Then she witnessed the manager go reprimand the bartender for the bug. And our poor server was visibly uncomfortable during this mess not having any power to enhance his guests experience. It took 20 minutes to remove the mojito from the check, and an additional 20 to process the payment.(probably a penalty for the complaint). I expected a higher degree of customer service from somewhere as corporate. But this company must clearly be going through a struggle if you hire people like Wesley to chase your guests away."
Jade R.,"San Diego, CA",326,290,589,4.0,5/21/2014,"I've never liked The Cheesecake Factory until I discovered their veggie burger. It sounds very lack-luster, but it is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. It's a hearty, yet flavorful patty that's served with a delicious garlicky-mayo.  And of course, the dessert! My favorite cheesecake here is the Banana Cream Cheesecake. It sounds gross, and a little boring, but it's absolutely delectable. Don't write it off before trying it! Another favorite is the Stephanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake- so utterly rich and tasty."
Dana R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",178,257,35,4.0,3/25/2015,Server was great and food is the usual.  Just a wait to sit down even though they had tables outside BBQ salad with Ahi Tuna was really good.
