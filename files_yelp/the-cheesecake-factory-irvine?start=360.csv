Shayda H.,"La Palma, CA",2,7,3,1.0,10/16/2016,"If I could give this place less than 1 star, I would. So, my friend and I decided to come here for lunch so we could catch up as we hadn't seen each other in a while. I came about 15 minutes after she was already seated and as I arrive she had told me that not one person had come up to her. I thought maybe they were just waiting until I came to get the drink orders; boy was I wrong. Another 5 minutes goes by and still no one comes by asking for drinks or to give us bread until a gentlemen came by finally asking for our drinks. We get our drinks and appetizers in until finally our actual waiter arrives, Christophe letting us know our appetizers are in. Another 10 minutes goes by, our calamari is out but we still hadn't even had our entree orders in. Finally, he takes our orders and the food comes out. He checks up on us at most twice. Firstly, I had asked for the avocado sauce to my salad on the side, but he misunderstood and charged me for a side of avocado. Secondly, he didn't mention that an up-charge for ahi Tuna was going to be $10. Even though they want it added you should let a customer know how much an additional charge is going to be. If I ever come here again I do not want him as a waiter and I don't recommend him for anyone but for the most part, Cheesecake Factory in Irvine spectrum, you won't be seeing us again."
Soren I.,"La Mirada, CA",2,101,3,2.0,10/9/2015,"Halfway through the meal a rat scurried across the floor! I don't want to eat somewhere where there are rodents in the kitchen. Besides that, the service was slow. The food however, was fine. The cheesecake was fine, but served pretty warm. It still made for good leftovers though. All in all I was not impressed and won't be going back to that location anytime soon. The rat thing freaked me out too."
Charita A.,"Murrieta, CA",281,421,1206,4.0,4/11/2015,"I love the Cheesecake  at the Chesecake Factory. This one gets very crowded, so dont go if you're in a rush because  there is almost always a wait. Raspberry Lemon Cheesecake is yum."
Ed A.,"Irvine, CA",164,109,161,3.0,5/28/2015,"The restaurant it self is beautiful & have a nice ambiance, the food was average and service was mediocre at best.  I meet two of my Freind there around 7:45 and the restaurant was busy with a lots of table full inside as well as the patio.  We got our drinks and bread and then the food and never seen our waiter after that, I end up going to the server station to find another waiters whom was very nice and getting my bill to pay for.  It's  the location that keeps this place busy & could be much better with some more help & Extera person on the floor."
Joy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,553,35,5.0,5/27/2014,"We had the BEST waitress! She was super funny, cool and ugh I wanted to be her friend by the end of our meal. I mean, not that I need to have a super outgoing waitress, but it's always nice when that happens. I had the soup of the day, Clam Chowder and seriously, it was pretty good. Like, I would have been fine even if it came in a can but DANG this chowder was great!!  Eating outside was nice as well, I will be back!"
Comedy P.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,192,314,4.0,5/26/2014,"As I mentioned earlier, we got our Red Velvet Cheesecake to-go. I tasted it last night and the cheesecake part tasted greasy and oily. Not very sweet and the back side of the cake tastes ""exposed"", not fresh. The cake part was ok. I figured ""Maybe I'm still full and not in the mood to eat.....just being greedy......I'll have it with coffee in the morning"".  Nope. No Bueño. Also in better light I could see that the bottom cake layer was brown and the top red. Red Velvet cake is a cocoa cake with red food color.  I texted my friend to ask him about his cake and he said the same.  We still love the place. This was a ""First"". He will go back to his Oreo Cheesecake favorite and I will taste any cake I choose before I leave, because I love them all."
J. V.,"Corona, CA",105,170,786,4.0,2/8/2014,"Absolutely adore this Cheesecake Factory. As soon as we entered we were seated promptly, the wait was no more then ten minutes. I had the chocolate chip cheesecake recommended by our waiter and it was the first cheesecake that I close to finishing. It was not too rich like most of the other chocolate cheesecakes. There was mixture of chocolate chips inside the cookie dough filling that made it taste absolutely balanced. The crust was made out of a thin layer of dark/milk chocolate and it added an extra kick of chocolate. The whipped creamed was also sprinkled with chocolate chips. This is probably one of my favorite cheesecakes I have tried at the Cheesecake Factory. Highly recommend to anyone who loves a chocolate chips cookies and cheesecake. It's a perfect combination.  You also get free bread when being seated. I love the wheat bread at this place. It's fresh, soft, flavorful and addicting."
Katriona M.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,20,31,3.0,5/20/2014,"Ehh. Okay. Meh.  Those were the words that basically summed up my evening (and 5 others) at the Cheesecake Factory yesterday night. Let's note, that this happened during Monday night. Monday. It wasn't busy nor was it hustlin' and bustlin'. Had a group of 6 (plus a child) and waited about 10 minutes for a table, which is fine, I checked out the cheesecake selection at the bakery area.  Food was okay. Drinks were okay. Nothing spectacular. Had a very extensive menu but I just wish they would focus on something and make it GOOD. They have too many cultural items on their menu but they do not get the flavors right.  Appetizers: Factory Nachos, Fried Calamari, and Thai Lettuce Wraps. Nachos were pretty good actually, I love that the chips that were soaked in the toppings were crispy and crunchy instead of soggy from the cheese/sour cream/pico de gallo/guacamole. The chicken that was supposed to be in the nachos was nonexistent. Fried Calamari was weak. The sauces felt like they came out of a squeeze packet you get from a fast food joint, the amount of calamari was so little, and the breading had a weird and really bitter bitter aftertaste.  Thai lettuce wraps were okay. Liked the chicken.  Everyone ordered their own stuff, from Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane to Rib Eye and Herb Crusted Salmon. All I can say was the steak was okay, but the rest of the entrees was MEH. My herb crusted Salmon was gross, it was like too sweet and too lemony from the sauce. I didn't even finish it. And seriously the shrimp scampi? That was a pathetic excuse of an Italian dish. But then again, it is the cheesecake factory so we did know what we were going into when we entered.  Waitress was good, she was really nice and had good customer service. Decent, and went by our tables enough times.  Tiramisu cheesecake is nasty. White chocolate Raspberry truffle is delish though.  $228+ bill for decent customer service and overall crap food. Lovely."
Krystle G.,"Orange County, CA",538,410,299,3.0,12/10/2013,"This place is always a hit or miss with me. I have tried more than half of the menu and I have narrowed it down to just a few items that are actually good. Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Fried Zucchini, Stuffed Mushrooms, Ahi Tartar (good but so small), Bistro Shrimp Pasta (so bad in calories), and Fish Tacos (change the sides). Other items are so bland and not worth the money. You know you can't go wrong with there desserts, especially the Limoncello Torte = my fave!  Staff is always different. You know some of them will be really attentive, others just go missing for a very long time.  Overall, it is an ok place to grab a bite."
Joel R.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2016,"I made an account just to leave this review because I was so disappointed with our server. My work is around here so my family and I would always come here and up until now, we were always super pleased with the customer service and food. However, after today we will not be coming here anymore. Firstly, our food was taking so long to come out that the table next to us (who sat down AFTER us) was already finished with their food. We pointed this out to our server, a guy named Christopher and after that, he was super rude and completely ignored us the entire night. His attitude towards us was so bad that the table next to us even noticed. We tried to ask for some sauce for my food and of course, he didn't bring it until we asked again. By this point the table next to us kindly asked their waiter for some sauce for my food because they noticed Christopher was completely ignoring us. They even joked that by the time we get our sauce it would be Christmas already. He ignored us until the end and didn't even bring us our check. And it's not because he forgot either, he intentionally ignored us and served all the tables around us, except us. And when we tried to get his attention, he shut us down telling us ""i'm talking to another customer.""  I really hope this restaurant does something about this because having a server like him is not going to help their business at all. We won't be eating here anymore."
Sam C.,"Irvine, CA",0,10,,5.0,11/12/2016,Nice place good customer service and food just the person who get your seat seems so tired
Niki N.,"Santa Ana, CA",158,23,14,2.0,2/28/2016,"Seriously the worst service ever, waited so long for our food, no one came to check on us, server looked like he didn't even wanna be here. I'd only come to take a cheesecake to go and that's probably it."
Jennifer N.,"Irvine, CA",212,99,218,4.0,9/8/2013,"People always rate chain restaurants so badly.  This restaurant consistently serves me great quality , amazing quantity food at good prices. quality: ***  not Michelin good but definitely better than most casual dining establishments quantitiy: ***  some of the largest portions you will ever see. When in doubt, always share an entree and you will usually be stuffed what i've tried: Miso Salmon: **** Bistro shrimp Pasta: **** Shrimp scampi: ** (small and underwhelming) Tuscan Chicken: **** avocado rolls **** calamari: *** (standard) wanton appetizer: *** (not as good as pf changs, not much crab meat inside) tuxedo cheesecake ****BEST one red velvet cheesecake **** banana cream  *** oreo ** reeses peanut butter chocolate cake cheesecake **** (almost as good as tuxedo) dutch apple cheesecake*** warning: dinner on weekends is terrible due to the crazy wait . They do not take reservations :("
Deniz A.,"Irvine, CA",3,12,3,4.0,3/2/2014,"Love their cheese cake options .I am very regular of this place with my family . First We order spinach dip ,garlic bread then grilled solman fish then strawberry cheese cake .. Little expensive but worth it , Sometimes servis slow you need to follow the waiter ."
Bahar P.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/8/2016,"Me & my family love coming here all the time for family dinners! Service is great & the remodel is amazing, love sitting in the patio now!!"
Jennifer L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",509,501,67,3.0,1/4/2014,"They are always busy here, even at non peak meal times! My sister and I came for lunch around 2 pm and after waiting about 10 minutes, we were seated in the bar area. We ordered 2 salads off of the lunch menu. For lunch portions, they were huge!!!! I recommend the BBQ ranch chicken salad or the luau salad. Our server seemed busy and distracted but still checked in on us and kept our drinks full. I have never had a bad meal at the Cheesecake Factory and it's awesome that anyone can get what they want. The menu can be a bit overwhelming but as long as you have an idea what you want, it's probably there somewhere! Great atmosphere and like I said I've negrt had a bad meal."
Abd Al Alim T.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",13,82,18,1.0,4/5/2016,I tried really hard giving this restaurant my money but they didn't want to serve me. I was sitting in the bar area for 30 minutes with no one even giving me a menu or water. I noticed 5 staff members standing around chit chatting and just looking at the customers instead of helping there customers. There were 2 other people that left at the same time that was complaining about their service. I spoke with the hostess about it but they didn't seem to care. I left and went to paul martins instead.  I will not return to this location.
Keith A.,"Oceanside, CA",703,331,5347,5.0,12/18/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. Excellent tasting food, large menu, lots of options. $10 to $20. Chicken piccata, large burrito. Chicken masala, jambalaya, Kobe burger. One of my favorite places to eat out. Outstanding cake and cheesecake desserts $7 to $10. Adams pb cup, Reese's pb cup, and several others."
LuCy t.,"Irvine, CA",302,468,254,3.0,3/16/2015,"Review for curbside take out order: Tips:  1) Never order curbside takeout order on a Friday night during happy hour. Why? Because the curbside that you are supposed to go to is shared with the Valet Parking that services Paul Martin's and Javiers. You will have a really hard time getting to the Curbside area. So if you can, avoid doing the curbside pick up during peak valet times. 2) Request the free bread. It's yummy. Especially the dark bread. Foodwise, Cheesecake is a 3 star rating. It's decent but not great. The plus side is that they do have an extensive menu so there will be something for everyone."
Sopa S.,"Irvine, CA",23,47,2,4.0,1/7/2015,"Went here for a quick dinner.  My take: 1.  Service was good, no complaints there. 2.  Ordered a steak, medium rare.  Came out well.  Still good, but not great. 3.  Other appetizers I've  had were decent enough. Summary:  Not a bad spot if you like Cheesecake Factory.  Reading other reviews, it seems the service is a hit or miss.  Fortunately our hostess and waiter was attentive, professional, and nice."
