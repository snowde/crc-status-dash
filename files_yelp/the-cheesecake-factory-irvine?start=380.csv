Carolyn H.,"Mesa, AZ",471,352,91,4.0,12/18/2013,"Let me just say two things to properly entice to you visit Cheesecake Factory: 1. Sunday Brunch.  2. Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes. Sunday brunch is IN-FREAKING-CREDIBLE. For the reals. I have a soft spot for waffles, so when you add a load of fresh strawberries, pecans and chantilly cream, the world instantly becomes brighter, happier and tastier. And where to start with sweet corn tamale cakes...sweet corn cakes, lightly toasted on the outside, then topped with salsa verde, pico de gallo, a ton of fresh avocado, cilantro and sour cream and it is a PARTY in your mouth. This is a great location at the Spectrum, they get you in and out quick and the staff is always super helpful."
Rohit R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,73,3,3.0,3/26/2016,3 star average for this restaurant is accurate.   Food wasn't bad. Had to be really careful to about the fat/sugar/sodium that all their food is so high in.  Nothing to write home about.
Victoria M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",932,468,310,4.0,7/19/2013,"Excellent food quality and friendly staff!  I drove 2 hrs to visit a friend who was in town from Chicago on business.   A group of 5 of us were seated in a booth made for 4; they added a chair at the end of the table for me.  I was a bit unhappy when we were stuffed in that booth. Another ""beef"" of mine was that our waiter/waitress changed 3 different times!!  The first girl went on break and we were greeted by a new server, then another new server came along and introduced himself as our waiter... very confusing! The food and company more than made up for the lack of seating and confusion though.  :)"
Nina Q.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,11,5,1.0,9/18/2016,"Went out with my mom friends last Saturday for an early dinner and movie night. We rarely have a night out without kids so we wanted it to be a fun night for us all. We decided to go early (4:30pm) and have dinner and drinks at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated right away, at that point I thought that we were lucky because there wasn't  a lot of people in the restaurant. The server took our drink orders, and the drinks came out just in time, then our server came back to bring our bread and to get our orders- Chicken Bellagio, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Chicken Salad Sandwich with fruit. My girlfriends and I were chatting away when I noticed that the server brought the food of the people in the other table that were seated about 20 minutes after us. My friends and I realized that we have been sitting for well over 45 MINUTES already WITHOUT OUR FOOD. The SERVER DIDN'T COME BY OUR TABLE TO CHECK ON US though she had passed our table a number of times. My friend flagged down another server to ask where our food was, a few minutes later our server came by and said that she was sorry but she FORGOT TO PUT IN THE ORDER and that she told the kitchen to expedite our order so our food should come out soon. Another 20 MINUTES PASSED and our SERVER kept on PASSING OUR TABLE WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING. My friend flagged the server and asked how long our food will take, she said it should come out soon. A few minutes later a runner came out with a plate of sandwich and brought it to our table- IT WAS THE WRONG SANDWICH. Another runner brought the rest of our orders- but no chicken salad sandwich. Our SERVER PASSED THE TABLE ONCE AGAIN WITHOUT STOPPING AT OUR TABLE, my friend called her and asked where our other friend's sandwich was, the server casually said ""OH, I PRESSED THE WRONG BUTTON AND ORDERED THE WRONG SANDWICH instead of chicken salad sandwich, they're making it now""- NO APOLOGY WHATSOEVER! This was the 2nd TIME SHE MADE A MISTAKE AND DIDN'T APPEAR REMORSEFUL- DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE. At that point my friend got up and talked to the manager, the manager came by our table and apologized- she didn't know what was going on because the server didn't say anything to her except that she had to key in a code for a change order: Cuban sandwich to chicken salad sandwich. The server didn't even say that it was her fault. The manager offered us free dessert and said that she would come by again to check on us. At that point we were all pissed and had lost our appetite. Our supposedly fun night was ruined! We had a movie to catch so we had to go quickly. Our server came by with the dessert menu- no apology, no nothing- we declined the free dessert since we had to go straight to the movies. We asked for our check- the manager didn't come back.  This was the WORST SERVICE I have ever received in a restaurant. So needless to say, we won't be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory again."
Ron G.,"San Clemente, CA",99,20,216,4.0,5/2/2015,"Just had a great dinner at The Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum.  Huge menu,  what to choose,  stand by food ready to be taken to tables,  saw the Chicken Luau Salad and said Yes,  that's the one,  very impressed.  And for dessert,  the chocolate smores Cheesecake.  An end to a perfect evening following a movie,  The Avengers at the IMAX"
Dennis G.,"Irvine, CA",14,22,8,4.0,11/9/2015,"Cheated tonight with the chocolate mousse cheese cake.  Wow was it sweet...  I had to chill it down with my black coffee. The patio area was refreshing which sits in front entry to the Spectrum area.  I hear that they will be upgrading their patio as some of the gas lamps don't work anymore.  Service was a little slow and the waiter experience was ehh...  We only came in for the dessert and coffee and of course the cheesecake was awesome. With 10,000 cheese cakes on the menu how could you go wrong.  :)"
Jane G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",89,271,16,5.0,3/16/2016,Great service at this location I'm the bar area for happy hour.  We had 5 glasses of wine and walked out with bellies full of food for less than 50 dollar tab!  No cheesecake this trip though ; (
Fredella S.,"Anaheim, CA",270,38,45,4.0,4/1/2015,"The best chicken Alfredo ever! It was so creamy and delicious! And for dessert, red velvet cheesecake! I've never been so satisfied :)"
Billy D.,"Irvine, CA",33,26,45,5.0,10/19/2014,Great brunch and the FULL menu is available all day Sunday.  Cheese cake has always been a safe bet to eat with HUGE portions and reasonably priced.
Syeda S.,"Irvine, CA",11,14,10,1.0,10/7/2015,"We've been loyal Cheesecake Factory customers for 15+ years but since our last experience I or my family will never be going there again! My husband I came here with our 8yr old and 2 yr old for dinner on 8/28/15. After the usual weekend 30 min+ wait we were seated. We ordered our food...I ordered a burger, my husband ordered pasta and for the kids we ordered the chicken madeira to share. We finished our food but the kids weren't that hungry so we had to get their chicken madeira to go. The next morning my son warmed up the left overs and began eating. As he bit into a bite he felt something hard and spit it out. I was absolutely horrified to see a metal screw come out of his mouth! Not a hair, or a dead bug or something gross but something physically DANGEROUS that could have ended very badly. Right away everyone stopped eating and I was so relieved I wasn't feeding that to my 2 yr old because I dont even want to think what could have happened if she'd been the one with that bite. Of,course I called them right away and was given Mike Macias (Manager) information. I spoke with him in a very civil and calm manner- I did not lay blame on him or did not disrespect him in any way. He wanted me to send him pictures and an email explaining everything, which my husband sent. After he saw the pictures he called my husband and spoke to him about investigating the problem He said he will look into how a screw got into our food and will send us a gift card to compensate us for the chicken madeira.  It's been well over a month and we have yet to receive any update regarding the issue- no follow up email, phone call, no gift card...nothing. Clearly loyal customers mean nothing to them.  It's not even care about the money or the gift card because we will not be eating there again so I don't need your gift card. If anything I'd want to get a refund back to my card. But the reason why I'm so upset is because they dont have the courtesy to even call or email a loyal customer to follow up after such a disturbing ordeal. If you have young kids and you decide to come here for dinner make sure you're paying attention to whats going in their mouths. I cringe every time I think about that disgusting screw ending up in my 2 yr old daughters mouth. I will be sharing pictures below as well."
Chayla G.,"San Leandro, CA",284,170,116,4.0,1/20/2016,"Nice location, service was great. Our wait was only about 10 minutes. We ordered 4 dishes to share and they were all great. Shared a couple cheesecakes & they were good too- red velvet & salted caramel. Hibiscus martini was pretty good as well!"
Ileana G.,"Downey, CA",1,59,7,3.0,2/29/2016,So I went to Cheesecake Factory about a week ago for my anniversary and there was practically no one there thankfully we went on a Tuesday. We got in and ordered after maybe 20 minutes ( couldn't make up my mind so many choices !!) I got the shrimp scampi and steak Diane and my boyfriend got the steak Diane and salmon. My food was delicious but my boyfriend did not got full lol he's a big guy but he said it was delicious as well. My only complaint would be that our waitress never checked up on us and only refilled our drinks once. They weren't busy so idk why she couldn't check on us more often. I would probably come back but I just wished they had a little bit more curtesy.
Giovanny G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,5,,3.0,3/30/2016,"Not to good of service today like I'm used to, I expected better but the food was good.. Nachos are amazing"
Derek H.,"Santa Monica, CA",400,258,,2.0,4/1/2013,"Finally came to this place for the first time after living in Irvine for so many years. This place is so crowded... We came in at around 5 pm and we still had to wait a while before we could get a seat. My favorite thing here is always the brown bread... absolutely amazing but it's pretty bad when you're favorite thing at a restaurant is the starter bread.  I wanted to try something different this time and so I got the eggplant sandwich, which was pretty big and filling but lacking in many ways. It would have been so much better if they put the sandwich on a ciabatta or a bread roll but instead they put it on a hamburger bun. And I basically had to eat also eat it with a knife and fork since everything just fell out of the sandwich with the first bite I took. Only the melted cheese was actually holding the contents of the sandwich together. I ended up full though, but not satisfied. Again the bread was awesome, my main course, not so much. Probably going to order something else the next time I come."
Alexa M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",3,16,,5.0,2/14/2016,"Amazing service, and an even more amazing staff. Came here tonight with a large group of friends. Being the day before Valentine's Day, the restaurant was pretty crazy and crowded. The manager talked to us about our wait time and even asked us follow-up question about how our dinner was after the meal. He was on top of everything. Additionally, our server Kelly was entertaining as well as being a good server. I could not have been more pleased with the restaurant and the staff during this busy season."
Debbie M.,"Orange, CA",8,187,109,5.0,2/26/2015,"I tried an item from the skinny liscious menu and it was awesome!  It was the beef medallions with asparagus, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes.  It was 590 calories or under.  It was the perfect portion size, enough but not too much.  The medallions were cooked perfectly, and seasoned perfectly.  All of the tastes went perfect together.  There weren't too many mashed potatoes which was great.  I would definitely order this again!  I got an original cheesecake slice for dessert, it was beyond heavenly!  It was so light and creamy.  I definitely recommend the original one, it showed me what real cheesecake is supposed to be like!   The service was impeccable.  It was a fantastic experience."
Janice O.,"Irvine, CA",28,143,78,2.0,12/15/2014,"I've been here a few times and I think the food is OK. It's not the best. The place looks so elegant but the food doesn't match up to the decor. When I come here, I've really only gotten a great server once. Other than that, the servers are pretty rude and never check up on my table. I came today and the server never didn't come by once to refill my drink even though I knew for a fact he saw my cup was empty. As I watched him, he checked up on all his tables multiple times but mine... Ummm ok. He seemed pretty annoyed when I asked him questions about the menu too. It's a hit or miss for this place. I would rather just go to Yard House.. Service && Food is better."
Timmy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",503,1624,2998,4.0,12/20/2012,"This is just about the cheesecake. Came at an off hour between lunch and dinner so the wait was short - only 5 minutes. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. I was here for a brief business related meeting so just had a piece of cheesecake. In the back of the extensive book-like menu are two pages of cheesecake options. I didn't count but I would guess there were 50 choices. I had the key lime cheesecake. Ala mode. It tasted like key lime and I ate every bite. Except for the whipped cream. I'm not a big whipped cream fan so the two giant blobs they put on it were mostly left on the plate. If nothing else, the cheesecake seems to be pretty good. Which is what you'd expect since they call themselves The Cheesecake Factory."
Kristin F.,"Escondido, CA",3,10,,4.0,5/28/2015,Came here late and the stewardess and waiter were happy to take us in. The service was great and our food came quickly. My husband and I shared the meatloaf and came home with leftovers. The portions are very large and good for sharing. We also ordered the spinach dip and it was delicious.
Hector W P.,"Downey, CA",16,37,121,5.0,1/1/2015,"It's not only the food, it's the servers that can make or break an establishment .... In this case, this cheesecake factory at the Irvine spectrum gets 10 stars if I could give them thanks to waiters such as Salman M ( aka mojo): the man is 100% on it and just an absolute pleasure to talk to.... Great way to start the new year"
