Karen C.,"Long Beach, CA",11,8,,1.0,12/9/2017,"I went to the cheese cake factory 12/08/17 along with my family, been here multiple times and this time was by far the worst experience, prior to been seated I requested a hi chair/booster for my little one,5 minutes after being seated I noticed that the server didn't bring what was requested, after the server was taking our order we asked for a hi chair again, our beverages and bread arrived but our bread wasn't warm it was cold and very hard, our food arrived 25 minutes after being placed, the my dish was slightly warm upon arrival ,I was at the establishment for about 1 hour and a half and I never received the hi chair and trying to balance my child in my lap while eating my slightly warm food, that should conclude my experience."
Glenn B.,"Lakewood, CA",0,7,8,1.0,12/2/2017,"This place has gone downhill ...far!  Don't order curbside.  I spent 25 minutes in the car waiting --after the time they said it'd be ready...to receive cold food that clearly had been sitting there and likely only came out because I called a second time.  All I got was a manager's pathetic ""sorry"" 3 times and offer for ""new hot fries"" even though I had 3 cold entrees... reminds me of my brunch there few months ago when we asked waitress for an extra share plate and she grabbed 2 small bread plates and said that's all that was clean... while another waitress is giving the table nearby entree-sized  share plates...too many better alternatives at the Spectrum.  RIP TCF."
Kylie K.,"Irvine, CA",304,70,108,5.0,6/4/2017,"Walked in 20 minutes before closing on a Saturday night and they still took us! Granted we knew exactly what we were going to order and was done in 30 minutes.  Our server was very patient with us and reassured us that we were no trouble, even though it seemed like she was one of the last servers there. You already know we tipped her well!  I always order the chicken madeira and steak Diane combo, and a mango freeze. I'm never let down at any and every Cheesecake Factory that I go to. The sauces for the madeira and steak are phenomenal and go extremely well together. And the mango freeze is so refreshing.  I usually come to the Irvine Spectrum Cheesecake Factory for happy hour, which is also one of the best happy hours EVER. The bartenders are always so nice, $6 cocktails, and great food selection! Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite restaurants. Haven't been to one that's disappointed me so far."
Mona H.,"Anaheim, CA",443,20,16,1.0,9/10/2017,Normally i dont like to give bad review. But a server by the name of Lorinne is very rude and would treaf arabs bad. The manger tried to help but waa not much of help Do not go there unless you are white
Lorena L.,"Irvine, CA",1,28,52,3.0,9/28/2017,"I come to this location a lot! I love their food, but the service is very slow most of the time, and the food takes a long time to come out! It doesn't happen at all their locations but for some reason, the Irvine Spectrum location always has this problem! I will come here again, but just because it's close to my home, not because I really like it!"
Lauren V.,"Austin, TX",200,123,34,2.0,4/1/2017,"I went here the other day with a few friends.  2 of them had to leave by 1pm and let the waitress know.  We sat down by 12 and we put our order in around 12:15 and didn't get food for a good half hour while other tables that ordered later/came later were getting food.  When they brought the food, they brought one of the entrees out at least 5 minutes before anyone else (she ordered the crusted chicken romano and someone else at the table ordered exactly that as well so there is no excuse).  I ordered a salad and added grilled chicken.  The food was fine once it actually came, no complaints there.   The waitress really could have cared less about the inconvenience of my friends not being able to actually eat their meals there, they had a few bites and took it with them to go.  My one friend asked to speak to the manager because she had noted specifically at the beginning that 2 of the people were on a time crunch and was upset our food seemed to come out as less of a priority than other tables. The manager was nice and took off the appetizer (which only the other 2 people ordered so it didn't benefit me in any way really).  She offered dessert but we declined.   When the bill came the waitress had forgotten to put on my coffee and made a point to come back with a new check for the 3.50 coffee which seemed petty considering the circumstance of a ruined lunch in which we didn't get to eat with our friends. After our 2 friends left I had some more coffee and the 2 of us left ended up ordering a piece of cheesecake to share.  Not that I wanted it for free but don't offer something and then not follow through.  On top of that the waitress stopped by every 3 minutes to ""check on us"" because I think she wanted us to leave.  I had come here 1 time previously and would rate that visit 3 stars.  On that visit we had to ask twice for a baby sling (to put the carrier in) before someone went and got it.  The service on that visit was otherwise okay but not spectacular. So I totaled it to 2 stars for an average. I won't be coming back to this location, I have frequented the one in Fashion Island and prefer that location, there are plenty of other places to eat at the Spectrum."
Fabby N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",157,3,,2.0,12/16/2017,"This restaurant has a been an all time favorite for my family and myself. We've never had any trouble up until today. I know it's always risky calling the same day you want to make reservations for but I do know how it works. On weekends they do take reservations the first hour they're open, which is from 10-11am. I called and was immediately put on hold for a little over 10 mins. By the time they got back to me they had told me that they can't take any reservations after 11:00 am. Which I already knew but that is why I called before 11. I just think they should stick with what they say."
gabriel a.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,11,4,1.0,10/20/2017,"They are the worst , they were very good tho! We waited half an hour and they mass it up! Then they said sorry wait another half an hour, can u imagine another half an hour for their mistake. Their kindness and customer service was zero !!!"
Alice W.,"Irvine, CA",294,215,256,4.0,11/24/2016,"For this specific location, the service is always nice, but there is always quite a long wait. But, that just means more friend bonding time. Food portions are quite large and the cheescakes are the same as any other cheesecake factory. Some of my favorite foods: - Thai Lettuce Wraps: 5/5 - Get ready to delve into your food. Making the lettuce wraps is always fun and the presentation of the plate is gorgeous. Add your grilled chicken into any of the lettuce wraps, drizzle on your favorite (or all) of the sauces, add the beansprouts, carrots, etc, and then consume. Not too heavy at all. - Chicken Madeira: 5/5 Tender chicken atop fluffy mashed potatoes and decorated with skinny asparagus. The dish is on the heavier side and will get you full quickly. Lots of flavor and texture going on, which I love. - Fave cheesecake: Banana Creme Cheesecake: 5/5 - If you are a fan of banana creme, try the banana cream cheesecake. Although I wish there was more than just the layer of banana cream on top of the cheesecake, it is still so good, and I recommend it! I usually only go here when we have larger parties so the wait is always long, but I continue to dine at Cheesecake Factory since it is nice and has something for everyone."
Paula R.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",247,249,815,3.0,3/18/2017,"Located at the Irvine spectrum after shopping all night we decided to get a sweet treat. Friday night so it was some what busy, we did get seated with in 10 minutes. In the lobby they have displayed all their cheesecakes, good place to look at they have. The menu has lots of cheesecake choices along with other dessert a long detailed list but not many pictures. We sat outside in the big patio with a centered bar, and under heated lamps. Mental note great place to have a happy hour get together. Our waitress was nice and attentive. The raspberry lemon cheesecake was delicious, tart not to sweet and rich and creamy. Along with my cappuccino a great end to a night of shopping. With so many choices it was a bit hard to decide, I like that they have Low-Carb cheesecake options, I'll try those next time!"
Judy R.,"Fullerton, CA",20,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"If I could give this place a zero star I would! This was the worst experience ever! Our holiday manager party of 20 waited for almost 2.5 hours before we were told that we had to wait another HOUR to be seated.  The manager just kept saying that ""they had slotted us for a specific area and that it was not ready for us yet"". This was unacceptable considering I saw party of 4, party of 5 and party of 8 just strolling by before us. We were really patient and understanding but someone dropped the ball. We could have easily been seated outside or in another area. It didn't seem like they cared! And although they tried by comping the appetizers, it took the kitchen nearly 40 min to bring the food. They could have been honest when I spoke to the first 2 managers and told us that they couldn't seat us or that they were too busy to serve us. Instead they just let sit spring for nearly 3 hours to just tell us we were going to wait longer. As popular as they are, they need to fix the system when it comes to guest seating. Never coming back again!"
Sheena B.,"Irvine, CA",118,25,2,5.0,10/22/2017,"I love this place,  I love the service..I ordered the wrong item and they exchanged it without any hesitation at all.  Try the chicken and waffles eggs Benedict.  Holy crap,  I will be back!!! This place ROCKS!!!! A MILLION GOLD STARS!!!! XOXO SHEENA"
Urban Diner D.,"Laguna Beach, CA",20,70,40,5.0,9/20/2017,"Shandi was our amazing waitress and she could not have done a better job at-pampering us! Met my old friend  Dede of 40 something years after just moving back and we felt like we were at a 5-Star Resort!! Shandi gave us such a great dessert presentation I felt the need to reach out to her manager Jamie!! Jamie was also very upbeat and positive and we suggested that Shandi train all the new hires;-)) Good times, great food, fabulous service!!"
Denise B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",56,1,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Worst costumer service. Waited two and half hours. Kept asking how much longer, was told 20-30 minutes every time. The last manager we spoke with was a total jerk. (The manager that was on at 8pm on 12/17/17) didn't care and said it's gonna be another hour at least. This was a company party, they wouldn't let us make a reservation in advanced and we were treated terribly. Will never recommend this location to anyone."
Puzant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,559,460,5.0,2/21/2017,"When it comes to The Cheesecake Factory, you can be rest assured that you're going to end up with the same menu and same delicious food every single time. The plates are recreated identically at every location, portions are huge, and prices are competitive. This location stood out because customer service was fantastic. We were a large party and our waitress handled everything very well. She was attentive, refilling our waters and following up on orders. They have a really beautiful outside seating area. It was pretty cold when we came by, but all the heaters were blasting and we ended up having a great experience. I would definitely frequent this location if I lived in the area."
James B.,"Irvine, CA",0,41,2,1.0,11/10/2017,"Restaurant (service, menu/choices) has drastically changed. Only 2-3 items for vegetarians. Shocking. Considering the quality/taste and wait times, not worth it at all. They don't even have tofu to substitute any protein (chicken) on salads like CPK, PF Chang, etc. Wife and I came here on Friday date night and left half-empty stomach; extremely disappointed. NOT for VEGETARIANS! Avoid. Outside of the above, restrooms had spider webs. Bad! If I could give zero stars, would do so."
Roxanne E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,2,1,5.0,10/14/2017,"Great experience at this location. Food was excellent and Our server Vanessa Estrada and Brianna was amazing. Very friendly, quick and efficient. They both handled our party of 23 with ease. Will definately be back."
Simon S.,"Torrance, CA",438,22,33,5.0,9/24/2017,We had great customer service they found a C in five minutes the waiter had a big smile when he greeted us and the food was delicious
dave b.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Just horrible service ! Waited 30 minutes to be seated than 30 minutes for our food which was absolutely awful . Pasta had no sauce on it and the waiter said "" oh I'll get more sauce from the kitchen"" and proceeds to bring me a small cup of sauce to put on my own pasta!  Wife's burger was charbroiled instead of medium and sons was awful but he was starving so he ate it . They did get 2 meals correct so I guess that's something . Manager took off the three awful meals but seemed more interested in making sure I knew "" we usually do a good job "" . Well not tonight won't be back for quite a while after this mess."
Calvin W.,"Irvine, CA",162,236,169,1.0,4/9/2017,"Called twice waited 6 mins both times for employee to transfer me to someone who can take curbside to go order. Second time I called I told her nobody was answering when she transferred the first time and she said ""i will get someone to take your order"" Was on hold for over 6 minutes. Horrible. Can't even take an order..."
