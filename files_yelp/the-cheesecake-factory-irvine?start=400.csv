Anthony A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",779,1013,99,1.0,12/20/2012,"Do you like chicken piccata? How would you like it if someone made you a plate of decently cooked pasta with a couple grocery store deli case-quality chicken breasts... and then proceeded to violently drown it in a sauce made from what appears to be a 1/2 lb. of butter, cream, and a hint of lemon? You'd think it tastes like Caloric Death, and if you were able to get it down your gullet, your stomach and colon would surely punish you for this heinous act.  Welcome to my lunch here."
Brian S.,"Irvine, CA",17,86,,1.0,1/25/2016,"The server was nice and helpful. I ordered the sliders and the fried cheese. They were good. My wife ordered the corn soup without onions - it came with onions we returned it. Then she ordered chicken Marsala. The pasta was undercooked and the Marsala hadn't burnt off it was horrible, my wife didn't eat it, she returned it after two bites. The manager came over and comped the dish but did not offer to make amends. It was too late to order and wait for a third meal but she could have said get a slice of cheesecake on me or let me whip you up a quick salad for free. My son and I are leaving full and my wife is hungry ...  We are unlikely to return."
Derek W.,"Irvine, CA",53,1,,1.0,9/17/2016,I have both eaten here and consistently deliver from here through a third party service. This is consistently some of the worst service I've ever received. My food has never been ready on time and usually 15+mins late not to mention only being correct half the time. The servers just seem to be careless and the fact that Irvine company will allow any of their tenants to continue to run in this fashion is Ridiculous. If you want Cheesecake Factory go to fashion island. They actually care there.
Miranda L.,"Irvine, CA",0,24,1,1.0,11/10/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory. BUT last night myself and a friend went around 8 o'clock. We ordered drinks and the bread came soon after. then the waitress never came back. we sat there for two hours without the waitress coming back to offer us food. she only come back to give us another drink and still did not offer anything from the food menu. good thing I was with good company or i would have raised hell. I guess its a good thing she did not tell us her name or I would have mentioned it now.  another thing, she did not ask my friend and I for our ID's when we ordered alcohol. I am a bartender and I know the rules. Big mistake.  So I will not be going back to this location ever again."
Jenna D.,"Irvine, CA",435,346,333,4.0,6/25/2014,"Johnny the bartender is the shiznittle snip snap snappy. extra star just for him. i really wanted to hate this place because, it's the cheesecake factory. but the food is pretty good for a chain. thai lettuce wraps. bomb. skinnylicious turkey burg. pretty good. firecracker salmon rolls. surprisingly awesome. BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE. damn, just writing that made my mouth wawta. curbside pickup is legit, just a little pricey for what it is. 3.3"

Romina G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/12/2016,Isn't this restaurant supposed to close at 11 pm on Thursdays? I got here a few minutes before 11 pm last Thursday and it was already closed. I left hungry because of them. Two stars though because I have been here in the past and I really like this place but I can't stand the fact that they do close early some days.
Bryan H.,"Alpine, UT",0,4,,1.0,2/23/2016,"The worst service I've ever experienced in my life. The server walked up, asked if I wanted something to drink. I said possibly, and asked her a question. She promptly walked away with no explanation. I spoke to the manager, and he sent her back.  She stood at the table just looking at me. It's practically obscene to me that service could actually be this bad."
Gary B.,"Irvine, CA",72,124,27,3.0,3/10/2015,"I really had to take a couple of days before posting a review for my experience, because quite frankly I was a bit confused as to how I was going to express my views. It was early evening and there was a slight chill in the air, but my wife and I decided to sit outdoors because it was pretty busy indoors and they had heaters on the patio. After being seated and receiving our drinks, some women were seated at the table next to us. Immediately after sitting down they asked the waiter to turn off the heat. Well the heater was being mutually shared by their table and ours. So do you think that the waiter bothered to ask if we would be ok with it being turned off, especially since we were seated first? NOPE! Anyway I sucked it up and went back to being chilly. So while ordering I jumped on the Fish and chips while my wife was being a bit more indecisive. She asked if she could possible get an Angel Hair Pasta with Marinara Sauce and Chicken. He replied by informing her that they had Angel Hair with Shrimp. She was insistent on what she wanted so he went to ask the Chef if they could do it. After taking forever he came back with an affirmative answer so my wife ordered it.  Being busy we figured it would take some tie to get our food and it did.  As we started eating I noticed my wife playing with her food. Now if you were to ever have dinner with us, you would soon discover that my wife never messes around and is always finished twice as fast as I am. Anyway, I asked what was wrong and she told me that the sauce was so spicy that she couldn't eat it. So I called our waiter over and explained that this wasn't the Marinara she asked for. After 3 or 4 ""Are you sure?"" comments he took it to the Chef in an attempt to have it done right the second time around. All the while I'm sitting there picking at my fish, but more about that later. 2 or 3 minutes later our waiter comes back with a saucer of Marinara Sauce and asks my wife if this would work. She tasted it and said that will be fine. Instead of taking her at her word he kept insisting on making sure. ""Are you sure?"" ""Are you really sure?"" ""Are you REALLY sure?"" ""We doing want to have to repeat this."" Of course by this time the people around us were captivated by the conversation taking place between my wife and our waiter. Back to my plate, I have Fish & Chips all of the time so I'm smart enough to know that I will find a small bone from time to time. This time was different. Rarely if ever have I bit into a piece of fish and had a bone be so thick that it pierced the roof of my mouth. There were so many bones that after picking through the first 2 pieces I gave up and left the rest. The bed of fries underneath the fish did a better job of playing fish with all of the grease they soaked up that I ate some of those instead. When it was all said and done, the $50.00 plus that we spent on this eating experience might have been better spent on a Filet-o-Fish sandwich snuck into a movie. I give this review only because I believe the waiters intentions were good. Yes he got a tip. Gary"
Thea P.,"Escondido, CA",54,83,23,4.0,11/11/2014,"Love the Cheesecake Factory,  since there isn't one near where I live whenever I come to Irvine I eat here.  Service is usually pretty good and the food is always yummy and way too big a serving."
J C.,"Irvine, CA",2154,428,10,3.0,6/7/2014,"Upgrading to 3.5 stars with a round up.  Food quality over the years has improved albeit very slightly, while other chain competitors quality has gone down.  In addition, price hikes here have lagged the competition.   The happy hour during the week is killer! edit 8/14 -- based on last visit, setting back to 3 stars.  Nachos were awful, and they served me stale chips. Lastly, they need to retrain their staff on cleaning procedures.  We saw over a months worth of dust on a counter less than 3 feet from where we were eating. YUCK!"
Noor D.,"La Quinta, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/21/2016,"Good place and convenient for families,the girl who served us was awesome I forgot her name but she was smiling all the time ,helpful and really nice.i highly recommend this place."
Paul A.,"Anaheim, CA",394,1075,513,4.0,9/3/2013,"I usually don't come here, because you get so much food, and you pay for a ton of food, but if you aren't that hungry, there are probably options that make more sense. I came with a couple guys visiting my office. my order came out just like I ordered it cobb salad, extra chopped and tossed- perfection! delicious perfection and I could have ate the whole thing but I was obligated to talk occasionally. Great spot, but tons of food and kind of a silly waiter."
Sarah E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",98,39,46,4.0,12/27/2015,"Friendly and attentive server, good food with large portions. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large party during the holiday season however, they wouldn't take a reservation for our party and so I had to get there nearly 2 hours in advance in order to get a table for my party. There was no room inside to wait as well. With that said, once we were seated our experience went well. The server was there promptly and we enjoyed our yummy and large meals. I've never been disappointed with a Cheesecake Factory dish and always love their bread."
Steven D.,"Whittier, CA",7,65,10,4.0,1/9/2016,"I can always count on the Cheesecake Factory to deliver delicious food when I want it. The location is Irvine, while the food was still great, the design suffers. The tables seemed crammed in versue the location in Brea adn the one at the Americana. Not the location to come to if you are claustrophobic. Overall good experience though."
Ana L.,"Irvine, CA",128,88,297,5.0,9/22/2013,"Great place to eat or just come and get a drink! Most of the waiters I had are always friendly and the staff is nice! I never have had to wait more than 10 minutes to get a seat. I love how they attend to you write away and get your drinks immediately with a basket of bread! I always get fast service here and the prices are great, in my opinion, for the portions of food you are getting! You will never leave hungry! I suggest getting a strawberry banana smoothie for sure! And if your hungry try the Louisiana Chicken pasta!"
Shelby G.,"Murrieta, CA",217,86,108,5.0,9/19/2013,"This place was everything I hoped it would be. We went in for happy hour on the way to the Backstreet boys concert.. along with everyone else. When we got there happy hour just started so we were lucky enough to get the last 4 person table in the bar area. Table was small but its in the bar.. not surprised. Happy hour was great. $5 appetizers, the full portions! I have the buffalo bites and they were phenomenal! Absolutely excellent and a huge potion they are each a good 3"" triangle and there are 8 of them, buffalo chicken and cheese stuffed in a spicy wanton wrapper and deep fried!  Next I had the full size 4 cheese pasta which was absolutely ravishing, I ate a ton of it and took a full meal home. $17 was worth it, I got almost 3 meals out of it.  I can't wait to give them another try, so many good things on the menu!"
Luke B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",123,20,9,4.0,9/3/2014,"Great place for lunch. Not too crowded on a Tuesday. Great relaxed vibe but nice for a lunch meeting. The staff was great and not ""all up in your chili"" so to speak!  The food wasn't too shabby either! Will be back for sure."
Tom B.,"Irvine, CA",675,177,32,4.0,6/29/2014,"Every Cheesecake Factory is the same, so... this goes for all of them. The food is good, usually consistent.  The columns and marble (i.e. ambiance)... a bit odd, but whatever.  CF's are always busy (20 minute wait most of the times I've been).  Typical Yard House-like menu where they offer a billion dishes.  I start with the Crispy Cuban Rolls and Dynamite Shrimp, then get the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  It's one of the best things ever.  Eva's, in Laguna, has some good Caribbean food, but I would take CF's JBPS (ooh... look at me abbreviating) over anything Eva puts out.  Now for the rating... I wouldn't give it 3 stars (it's better than that), but it's not really 4 stars, either.  Again, wish we could tweak the rating system.  I'll go with 4, though, as it's certainly better than ""A-OK.""  Hmm... how would I tweak the ratings?  Let's see. 1 star - Dog food is better (and sometimes really tasty; what?). 1 1/2 stars - It's not quite dog food, but Purina has clouded my judgment. 2 stars - Like a bad buffet, but... it served its purpose at the time. Won't be back. 2 1/2 stars - I went back, but not sure why. It's just as bland as I remember. 3 stars - It's not terrible, nor is it amazing.  Works in a pinch.  Think Yard House. 3 1/2 stars - Pretty good.  Consistent.  I like it. 4 stars - Wow... that was an awesome meal.  Cool place. 4 1/2 stars - I don't know... this might be one of my favorites now.  Delicious. 5 stars - Sublime.  Everything was perfect.  Think Nobu."
Lauren B.,"Santa Ana, CA",674,428,936,1.0,9/6/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is a very confused restaurant. They have Chinese, Thai, American, Italian and Mexican. It is so much of everything, it's nothing.  The reason I came here tonight was because we had a gift card, normally I would never spend this kind of money on generic dishes.  I ordered the crabcake sandwich which was okay, a little mushy, it needed texture. Maybe a raw red onion or something. But I felt like an old person eating this dish. The other dish we ordered was the pulled pork sandwich, that was disgusting. The bbq sauce tasted like it had a lot of pineapple in it. However, both had french fries and those were decent. To top it all off we got the 30th anniversary cheesecake. Chocolate and cheesecake. Good, but you couldn't really only taste the chocolate, it overwhelmed cheesecake.  Several children, many many high school kids and three birthday parties just to give you an idea of setting. Our waitress was nice however new, her suggestions were not good. (i.e. pulled pork) And she didn't really know what was on the menu. High schoolers love food like this... it's not offensive and blah. (Sorry if you're a high schooler. )  Stars 1 1/2"
