Babak F.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/24/2016,"Service and food not bad but spoons, forks, and glass were old, the table was old and dirty. Never take your date here, expensive and no quality."
Temenah C.,"Anaheim, CA",393,1040,3,3.0,1/7/2013,"To be fair, I've only eaten at Cheesecake Factory at someone else's expense. As in, I've never paid my own money to eat here. I received a gift card from my boss to this place and knowing it's a sodium/calorie bomb, we decided to clear away this gift card in preparation of New Year's detoxing. Now, what I love about the place is that menu is so large. There's something for everyone. What I hate about this place, is that the menu is so large it takes forever to narrow down your selections and make a choice. Like, you always feel like you really shoulda ordered something else. I mean, this menu covers Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and American cuisines.  Now, everytime I've ever been here and had a few different dishes, I've never been blown away. Like, the food is always ok, but it's never great. The service is always good, so no complaints there. The cheesecake is always the light of the meal. In fact, eat dinner somewhere else and come here for dessert."
Anna R.,"Menifee, CA",100,361,1251,5.0,8/23/2014,"As previously stated by other reviews, this is a chain restaurant. Basically, if you've been to one, you've been to all.  I agree that the set up and decor are the same and the menu items are the same. But I disagree that every Cheesecake Factory is the ""same"". I walked into this particular location planning to dislike it. Why? There were tons of people in line. It was a Friday night and it was noisy and crowded. I had to be at a concert and we decided to sit at the bar to avoid a wait for a table. Now I really didn't expect the bartenders to be happy about serving three customers dinner and only one bar drink out of the three of us. But I was wrong. The bartenders were awesome. I ordered a pineapple mojito and the avocado rolls. My son has the Caesar salad and my husband had the veggie burger and side salad. We all three love love love the bread that comes before dinner. The bartenders had no problem refilling our basket of bread! Let me start with the pineapple mojito. It was beautiful. It looked like something out of a food magazine. It tasted even better. The avocado rolls were served warm and with fresh avocado. I adore the dipping sauce it comes with.  My son ordered the appetizer sized salad and it was more than enough for my 21 year old son.  My husband enjoyed his veggie burger and salad. In the meantime the bartenders made sure to keep the non alcoholic drinks flowing and I sipped my oversized pineapple mojito the entire time we were there. My only complaint was the two couples, two older balding men with two blonde women in white dresses. They seemed to be in their 50s but acted and talked like teenagers. They decided to plant themselves directly behind us at the bar, one of the men put his hand on my chair back rest and made me feel very uncomfortable. They were talking very loud and were not respectful of personal space. That was not a reflection of the quality of food or service so I did not reduce the stars based on those rude customers. I've been to lots of Cheesecake Factory locations, this one is not my favorite location but it is by far superior in service and food quality.  I highly recommend the bar area. Despite the crowd, the service rocks!"
Laila A.,"Corona, CA",6,26,30,2.0,6/15/2015,"My first time at this location, Irvine spectrum EXTREMELY AWFUL FOOD , I usually go to the one in riverside. Amanda tried so hard to please us and she was honestly the only good thing about this location. The other waitress was very rude and had an attitude when I made a complaint about my food. Overall bad experience apart from Amanda herself."
Christina C.,"Newport Beach, CA",148,68,7,1.0,9/1/2015,Is this place for real? I don't eat carbs and try to order spinach dip w veggies instead of chips. First they say they can't do it then she comes back and says it would be $4 per vegetable. Who does that? Ridiculous!! Not to mention horrible service and gross old tasting spinach dip. Wish I had picked a different birthday dinner location now.
Susie Y.,"Garden Grove, CA",69,46,43,4.0,9/12/2015,"Daisy the hostess is such a sweet girl! She took great care of us, sat us in a great spot! My fave here is the chicken and biscuits followed by their tiramisu cheesecake; delish! Don't forget their BREAD BREAD BREAD!"
Zed K.,"Buena Park, CA",1,7,1,1.0,8/3/2016,"I was having dinner with my girlfriend and her sister on August 2nd, 2016. We ordered two dishes and one appetizer to share. We waited about 15 minutes and our dishes arrived. Our food runner passed our food to my girlfriends hands when he knew the plate was extremely hot. She was surprised and almost dropped our plates.He didnt bother apologizing to us. Secondly when we asked for a knife our server handed the knife blade pointing at us then passing it to us on the handle side for safety. I thought cheese cake factory is a professional restaurant. Its the worse"
Rita F.,"Culver City, CA",135,232,312,3.0,8/3/2014,"I agree with other reviewers, it is a 3.5 stars. I made the trek to the Irvine Spectrum to see Paul Rodriguez Jr signing with my nephews. After that we came to Cheesecake Factory because I remembered the generous lunch portions and specials. I ordered herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and five pieces of asparagus covered in a hollandaise sauce. The sauce was too tangy, too much lemon was used. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the herbs were not burnt or unevenly cooked. My sister had the Chinese chicken salad which portion could be shared between two people! I can only imagine the size of dinner portion. My only problem was that I had to leave my stroller in the front along with others which had me worry about it being out of sight. Overall our server was pleasant, was consistent on our drinks being refilled, and the remainder of party were attended promptly when they arrived. She was not pushy on the bill which I dislike when I'm half way through my meal and they leave the bill receipt side up. If I'm around the area, I will consider this place."
Pooneh A.,"Irvine, CA",0,41,,2.0,8/13/2015,We ordered pasta with Alfredo sauce and chicken. The pasta tasted good but there was a lot of sauce which made it similar to a soup rather than a pasta! It didn't look good. And the chicken was not soft at all but hard to chew.  The servant had a nice attitude but we had to keep telling him over and over to get all parts of our order. He also brought a wrong order.  The most terrible part was the bill! He forgot to charge us for something and charged us with a higher price for something els. At the end we payed more than we had to because we couldn't figure out the messed up bill ! This restaurant is a pricy one and not a well organized one. I prefer to go to other restaurants next time and don't suggest it to anyone!
Chelsea C.,"Austin, TX",0,16,4,2.0,1/12/2016,"Came here with my boyfriend for a celebration last night... He got the falafel salad and I got the bistro shrimp pasta.. Everything tasted great at the time, but it wasn't so great when I was up all night with food poisoning"
Janene B.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,8,,2.0,8/14/2016,"I think everyone knows that the CF has really good food and great desserts.  Met my Sister there yesterday for an early lunch.  We got there at 11:30, right after they opened.  I asked if we could sit on window side and after a brief wait we were walked back to the very back (no booths, just tables) and showed a table right next to a party of 4.  We declined and asked if we could sit at one of the empty booths we passed on the way back.  We were walked back to the front, the hostess then tried to seat us on the side I told her we didn't want to sit in the bar area. Again we declined and asked about an empty booth.  We were kind of indifferently told there were no servers available to cover that area and that we would have a 15 minute wait.  Um,  look around you ...  there were maybe 5 or 6 people waiting that came in after we did.  There were a multitude of open tables and a few open booths.  Hey, I'm paying to eat here and I think I get to sit where I choose within reason.  Note to management:   Maybe train your front desk staff to be a little more customer oriented.  What would have worked for us is if we had been offered one of the empty booths, given a glass of water or other beverage and politely told that we might have to wait for a short time before a server could get back to us.  Waiting up front by the door for a server to show up wasn't the right option.  We left and chose another one of the many nice restaurants at the Spectrum.  Probably will next time we go too."
Ms F.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,48,11,2.0,8/30/2015,The food is always good but the service  just get worse.  Our waiter never told us his name.  Never brought us water.  We had to chase him over and over again.  I was talking and he just walked away while I was asking a question.  Later on he said he had 10 tables that's why he is running around so much.  It's pretty bad when u have to get up and walk to find someone to get water and ask someone wAlking by to remove dirty plates.  But I guess the worst part is when u go to the rest room and you see such a disgusting mess that you lose your appetite.  I actually walked out and tried to show the photos to the manager but he told me he doesn't have the see because he know????   Seriously????  Wow
Kid S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",12,97,25,5.0,11/28/2014,"I dont like that they switched the soup of the day to Sat from Sunday give me my Potatoe soup back on Sunday. this was my after Church treat. But with out corrine,JOHNNY,and Sheila-blond hair bartender? I always sit @ the Bar i get better service I can see the Game and My order is never messed up and I dont have to look for my waiter to pass and I dont mind Tipping them more"
Kaytlin K.,"Newport Beach, CA",304,207,280,5.0,10/16/2014,"This place is awesome because service is really fast! Their cheesecake is obviously fantastic, but I do like the layout of this one better than others. I feel like the sound travels differently in the bar to where it's not as noisy. Anyways, try their miso salmon or their amazing potstickers! Shocking, but their asian food on the menu is worth a try."
Icee P.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,47,111,1.0,8/23/2015,"I haven't even sat down yet and rating this place one star for service.  I understand that a large group like is takes some time to be seated.  We were told 35 minutes but we have been waiting for 45 minutes when we followed up with the hostess what the status of out table was. ""5-10 minutes"" she said. 10 minutes pass by and another follow-up. ""We are setting your table up"" ok. Fifteen minutes pass and another follow-up. ""Oh, the party was about to leave but sat back down"" then wtf would you say that the table was being set up if the party currently occupying the table has not left yet???? This is definitely a fail on managing customer expectations especially if they have been waiting for a while.  But I guess what do you expect? It's a cheesecake factory. :/"
Rodney M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,26,18,1.0,1/3/2016,I came on 01/03/2016 at 8:40-ish for dinner. I ordered an Angel hair pasta Alfredo with salmon and unsweetened tropical iced tea. The forks on the table had food residue. I asked for another set. The new set came and all utensils had water residue and looked quite dirty. When my dinner arrived the side of the white plate multiple stains (manager claims its water stains) stemming from the bowl side of the plate all the way to the side of the rim. Almost as if someone took a dirty rag and wiped the plate with it before putting in the food. When i ensisted to pay my bill and get out of the place the male manager kicked me out like a dog. What a creep. There were about a 100 different ways he could've managed this but he chose to do so in the worst possible way. I am calling the helth dept.
Nancy N.,"South Coast, CA",0,29,5,2.0,8/26/2015,Had a family birthday dinner last night. There were 10 of us. 6 adults and 4 children. The food was fabulous. The server sucked big time. Apparently she was having a bad night and was NOT happy to have a large group. She ignored our several requests for water and when she finally brought it she sat our water AND glasses on a table next to us and rather then serve us walked over to table next to us to take their order. And that was as good as it got. Had to ask for bread and butter. She was pretty much invisible. We finally got the attention of another waiters to help us. When he spoke to her she snapped at him. Very disappointing. She really should NOT Be a server. Possibly she needs to be retrained. Hopefully that will help.
Valerie N.,"Midway City, CA",38,8,2,5.0,12/8/2015,"I came here last Saturday at 5pm with a party of 20 and the service was great! I avoided going to the Cheesecake Factory at Bella Terra due to the two hour wait I experienced. When I came in, I only had to wait for 10 minutes to get seated. The waitress was super friendly and took everyone's order with a smile on her face. I had a great experience!"
R S.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,70,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Never order from this location via Door Dash! Last night I ordered some spicy cashew chicken, and nearly every single piece of the chicken was CHARRED, BURNED black to the point I couldn't eat it. I'm pretty sure they sent me a burnt order because they couldn't serve that in the restaurant, but they knew I couldn't send it back."
Parisa H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1072,62,68,4.0,11/11/2014,"The managers are super friendly and helpful, but the wait on Friday night is super long. They do not take reservations after 12:00 Noon. Our server, Balal,  was great, super friendly and fun. The skinny menu is my favorite."
