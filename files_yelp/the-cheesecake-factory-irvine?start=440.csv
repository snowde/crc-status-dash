Norm N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",2,100,47,5.0,12/18/2015,Awesome! Told her we had a yellow cab coming @ 7pm & the food arrived fast in time. P.S. It's loud in here as the kitchen is in the middle so you hear a lot of plates clanking and noise. The food & service was great otherwise. Will go back again. Thanks.
Daniel P.,"Winchester, CA",18,9,1,3.0,12/15/2015,"Good thing about eating here on a Tuesday, 5 minute wait time. The bread of course was warm and delicious and our drinks were served quick and strong! The stuffed mushroom appetizer was well worth the 7 bucks too. But! The lemon herb chicken was served cold, which was sad because that's why we came. They made up for it with dessert, but the chicken left a bad taste for our experience."
Christine K.,"Irvine, CA",109,341,69,4.0,9/29/2012,"Since the wait at the Yard House was too long, we decided to saunter over to The Cheesecake Factory to check the wait times...5 minutes baby! (actually, about 2 minutes before they called our names). It's been awhile since the both of us have been here but we both knew the menu would be a small novel. I was craving a burger so I got the mushroom burger with regular fries. The burger was pretty decent - loaded with different kinds of mushrooms and a healthy serving of cheese on top. It would've tasted better if it was ""juicier"" and had some type of mayo/chiptole sauce in it - that would've put it over the top! The fries were nothing special but not bad either. However - the cheesecake (no surprise) is the true surprise of this place. The godiva cheesecake is ALMOST as good to me as Maggiano's Zuccotto cake but it's definitely on top 5 best dessert list!"
Erica H.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/30/2016,Food is horrible go to Javier's across the way. Wait was long... Don't expect to get your appetizer before your meal.
Kevin Bobby N.,"Orange County, CA",385,84,32,2.0,6/25/2014,"I came here with my little brother today for lunch. I ordered the Kobe Beef Burger (American Style) medium rare with some sweet potato fries. It came topped with caramelized onions mushrooms, shredded lettuce, and a sliced tomato. The first initial bite was AMAZING. However, every bite after left me wondering when I would taste that ridiculously tasty flavor again. 1 minute past, and the bun could no longer handle the juices of the burger. All in all, if they upgrade their bun to a higher quality one and went a little heavier on the seasoning, I would probably write an updated review for this burger alone at higher rating! My brother ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza which is both of our favorite type of pizza! However, it was under cooked for our taste. You would since it's thin crust that it would be a little bit more on the crispier side, but it was extremely soft. Limp would be the perfect word to describe it.  I had a decent experience, but my brother, on the other hand, barely touched his food."
Shariff L.,"Lake Forest, CA",37,273,1391,3.0,10/13/2015,"the Cheesecake Factory has amazing deserts so pick any of them, especially,  of course the cheesecakes.  my favorite is the tuxedo chocolate cheesecake. what you should not order is anything off of the Skinnylicious menu.  the calorie reduced salads such as the house chopped salad or the Chinese Chicken salad are weakly flavored and poor imitations of the original classics.  Instead go to California Pizza Kitchen for low calorie wonderful tasting full flavored salads!"
Rohlin A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",174,801,3655,4.0,4/11/2012,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory several times over the years and it is one of the most consistent restaurants I have visited. The most recent visit was after we left another restaurant and we were much happier with the food here.  We waited about 5 minutes to be seated outside and our drink orders were taken.  Our server brought the drinks back, some bread and took our orders.  The Strawberry Lemonade is very good and they have an excellent ratio of flavoriing to lemonade. We ordered an appetizer of Buffalo Blasts, the wife ordered the Chargrilled Coulotte Steak and I ordered the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club. The bread was warm and there is a sourdough and grain bread.  The appetizer came a short time later and was outstanding.  Buffalo Blasts are like deep fried wontons filled with chicken breast and bleu cheese dressing and buffalo sauce for dipping.  It is also a huge portion, 8 large wontons which we came no where near finishing. Our dinner came a short time later and my wife's steak was okay.  It was a little over cooked and looked a little tough to me.  The mashed potatoes were okay as well, but my wife is not a fan of red potatoes.  I loved my club, it had plenty of shrimp and bacon in it and again was a huge portion. For dessert, we shared the cheesecake on special, the Hershey Chocolate Bar Cheesecake with Creamy Chocolate Frosting and Chocolate Chips. A quarter from the sale of each slice will be donated to Feeding America, the nation's leading domestic hunger relief charity.  Talk about chocolate overload! Finally, our server Morgan was very friendly and engaging.  She checked on us several times and spent time to talk to us during the meal, even though her tables were busy.  We would probably come here more often, but Chief isn't allowed in the outside eating area, so this limits our visits."
Genie K.,"Irvine, CA",63,18,9,1.0,10/10/2015,"For the catering: I'm so unhappy right now... Cheesecake is one of my favorite places to eat, and they have an excellent reputation, so I was so excited to cater my son's 5 th birthday through them.  I placed my order on the phone 2 days before and was assured everything would be curbside at the time by a really really nice manager on the phone.  When my husband got there today they had no order and no food!  30 min later they found the order hand written on someone's desk, and told him that sometimes things just get lost?!  That is so unprofessional!  I was livid, but what can we do. Party was starting in 30 min at this point ( he waited 45 min) , so they scrambled to make the food.  And they offered a 25% discount which was okay, but they could have done more.  The food was fine, people enjoyed the party, and now that I look at the receipt I realized that they didn't charge us for the party package, but a la carte!  My husband didn't know it was a specific package.  So we ended up with more food than we needed and got a discount,  but it was not what the order was supposed to be even after they found it on the desk!         I will probably never cater from them again, and would not recommend it to anyone.  The catering orders are not computerized so if you do it, I would call and call again to make sure they are literally cooking it right before you need it.   Party hosting is stressful enough, and I didn't need to be worried that I needed to delivery order pizza for my guests.   Seriously did not live up to my expectations at all.  I have ordered from other restaurants for parties ( I have three kids and never had a problem like this)."
Michaelanthon R.,"Orange, CA",0,11,3,4.0,1/17/2016,Just celebrated a family birthday and everyone enjoyed the food very much. It was crowded but service was great and it's always fun for the birthday person to get to choose a complimentary piece of delicious cheesecake. I had the vegetarian burger and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Best I've ever had...I highly recommend it!
Kelsey S.,"Vista, CA",0,9,6,1.0,12/18/2015,"Had a horrible experience here, wrote in to the website about the whole experience and never heard back from them. Don't waste your money at this location!"
Dan D.,"Santa Ana, CA",631,302,2030,1.0,12/26/2012,"""The Cheesecake Factory has earned the title of America's Worst Restaurant for the 4th year running"" - Men's Health Magazine Take a look at their nutrition facts. Well, at least the ones they decide to disclose (lots of N/A's). For example, the Bistro Shrimp Pasta has 73 grams of SATURATED fat. No wonder I felt sick after the one meal that I had here.  Do you really want to sabotage your diet and health for an average chain restaurant?"
A B.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,1,1.0,4/1/2016,"Very rarely do I take time out of my busy life to write a bad review about a place but my experience here was just so unprofessional and unacceptable I knew it had to be heard. Went to this Cheesecake Factory branch at the Spectrum a couple months ago with my family and a guest. Everything started out fine (if you forget about the ~45 minute wait after we got seated to actually get our food to us.... keep in mind it was pretty late at night and the restaurant was half empty). When our food did come to us (finally), that's when all the shit went down. For starters, you could totally tell the food was cold and not fresh. The worst part was when our waiter brought us our drinks, THERE WAS GUNK ON THE FREAKING CUP. LIKE SERIOUSLY?? YOU HAD ONE JOB. The glass had some disgusting brown ish on the inside of the glass (probably some leftover chocolate shake I imagine) but how could they have missed that?! And how disrespectful of them to just go along with it and serve it to a customer and not even care that it's there? It's not like they didn't see it.. it was pretty damn noticeable. Honestly, the cold food wasn't a huge problem, I get it, it's late and they all want to go home, whatever. I could care less if it wasn't 5-star quality dining. But that cup was disgusting!! And when I called over the waiter, he had the most smug, rude smile on his face and he laughed in our faces when I told him that about the situation. Then I asked him to bring the manager and he did, and I told him we are going to leave because of the disrespectful treatment we got from our waiter, along with our Albertsons frozen food lookin meals and disgusting, unwashed cup. He even made us PAY for the food. WE DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THE FOOD AND WE TOOK LIKE TWO SIPS OF THE DRINK BEFORE SEEING THE GUNK INSIDE THE CUP. Very inconsiderate, rude, unprofessional workers and service. Do not go here unless you are looking for an hour-long migraine and food poisoning. 0/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Anyways we paid and we bounced. We then headed to BJ's at the Tustin Marketplace and had an amazing experience there as per usual. Great quality food and quality people. Don't waste your time here."
Christopher M.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,12,6,1.0,7/15/2016,"We just returned home from what was supposed to be a very special day -- an anniversary. We are regulars in this place and have been for the last 3 years, but after today, I feel compelled to leave a very poor feedback. In the past, almost every visit starts with us asking for a lemon wedge so we can properly clean and disinfect the filthy, under-washed silverware. Today, in addition to that, my eggplant parmesan dish was under-cooked. It literally tasted and chewed like a hockey puck. They were re-doing it for 16 minutes. My wife was forced to eat her dish alone, and I lost my appetite completely. My wife and I were sitting in front of dirty dishes for another 11 minutes awaiting a manager. My special 26th anniversary was further destroy when Shawn Welch, the assistant general manager showed up at our table with an arrogant attitude and fake smile."
Tom H.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,9,,5.0,11/13/2015,"This place is pure class. As fierce as you can get! When Rita and I come here, I look around and see all the great things that go on in this place and I am filled with euphoria. You can go on a date, take the family out to dinner, or even have a bachelor party! Not gonna lie, I went to a cheesecake factory birthday party for my friend, Ron, back in my day. It was quite the rager! Although the factory (as I like to call it) is extremely loud and incredibly close to my house, I have nothing but love and passion for it. Five stars!"
Wendie S.,"San Diego, CA",19,24,,2.0,11/12/2014,"Came here for lunch after suggesting it to my friend as a first time experience for her. We both ordered a lunch pizza/salad special and received our salad right away. However, we waited and waited for pizza, until.....the manager came out to the table and explained they ""made a mistake"" with my friends pizza and they had to start over. I explained that we could share my pizza and forget about the other pizza. The manager said, ""we are making the pizza again and go ahead and take it to go."" Fine, we will take it to go...... Well, when I received the bill, we were charged for this ""mistake"" pizza...... Seriously, is there any communication or customer service left? I get the cheesecake factory is corporate, but you couldn't comp the price of a mini lunch pizza...... Next time I will go to one of the many competitors in the area!"
Michelle P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",213,92,1,4.0,4/23/2014,"Came here on a busy Saturday night for dinner then to a movie with friends. Needless to say there was a wait, but it barely made it to 30 minutes. Once we were sat, the drinks and bread came out so quickly and never ended. :-) Right there made me happy. I have to premise my review with I was never really a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I may be changing my ways after this last visit. They have a healthy section of the menu now and I ordered the enchiladas. They were very tasty for being so healthy! I definitely would order again! Of course we ended the meal with cheesecake. My best friend and I split Chris' Crazy cheesecake, and it was HEAVENLY!"
C P.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/11/2016,"They ""misplaced"" my curbside pickup order that I had placed just yesterday, causing me to be over 30 minutes late for my event since I had to wait for them to get my order ready. The girl who helped me was unapologetic and didn't seem to care that their mistake made me extremely late for my event that evening."
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2304,3723,3.0,7/18/2012,"Another chain restaurant within the Spectrum. There's usually a long wait to dine here, but I usually don't mind as I can hit up some stores to shop at while waiting. I also like dining outside, so sometimes that wait is a lot shorter as well. Food is comparable to all other locations, although service can be subpar at times. I don't blame them at times though, as it's always busy and I can't imagine waiting on so many different people at all times. One of the things I frequently get here are the pizzas. It's made for 1, but CF standards, it's at least 2. Lucky for me, I love leftover pizza! Also, I love dipping it in their ranch sauce. One of the best I've had. Their fries here are really good as well, and go perfectly with the ranch! :) I can never go wrong here, just the feeling of guilt as I know how many calories I've consumed."
Stephanie S.,"Irvine, CA",23,7,1,5.0,7/10/2016,"Always love coming to Cheesecake Factory at the spectrum!! Everyone is so friendly, and nice. They always have a smile on there face. Love what they have done to the new outdoor patio area!! This was much needed. The manager, Annie, was very nice to meet. She was very personable and does an amazing job at Cheesecake, and with her staff.. Thanks to my server, Rachel, I had a great time! And the food, always Amazing!!!5 stars!!!"
Jan C.,"Irvine, CA",694,175,94,2.0,3/8/2015,Well  I guess I'm disappointment because my mom came to visit and I wanted us to have a nice dinner.  This review is only for the service not the food. The waiter treated us like we didn't have money to pay.  If that was it I would not review but the fact he never came back to offer dessert  or a refill on my drink really pissed me off! !! Yes I had to call in the manager  which I never do but it was ridiculous! !!! I hope it was an off day because their food was good to bad we got treated so bad.
