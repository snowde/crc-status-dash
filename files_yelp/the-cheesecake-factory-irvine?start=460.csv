Elvia R.,"Kailua, HI",0,9,,1.0,7/9/2016,"Food was horribly, ask for a chicken burrito and it taste like it was out of the can, I did not eat it was terrible experience, I do not recommend this place."
TJ S.,"Yorba Linda, CA",73,124,56,5.0,8/28/2015,Ashley D was a great waitress! She was on it and funny as well as attentive. The food here is always cooked to perfection I recommend the chicken Madeira. That is by far my favorite dish! I will be back that is for sure
Eva L.,"Los Angeles, CA",889,1039,1707,4.0,8/24/2012,"I love their wheat bread *_* But anyways... I've tried their -Fettucine Alfredo: it will not disappoint. -Four Cheese Pasta: with mozarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan cheese!  -Evelyn's Favorite Pasta: I love the roasted eggplant, artichoke, and broccoli! It's a great vegetarian pick! -Grilled Rib-Eye Steak: medium rare, pretty good for a non-steak place. This is my go-to dining place whenever I hit the Spectrum for a movie and shopping. It never disappoints me. :)"
Chang L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,116,161,5.0,10/26/2014,"I had the best fettuccini alfredo pasta here! We sat in the patio and were really relaxed! One waitress was a little impolite though, but didnt spoil our time"
Zoey O.,"San Diego, CA",508,391,292,5.0,7/11/2014,"My girlfriend and I went here on our way back from long beach. We were seated immediately and our server came right over. Our drinks were continuously being filled, we were offered more bread, and our salads were just up to par! Even a manager came over to make sure we were doing okay! Wish we could have been hungry for some cheesecake!  I am not a big cheesecake fan, but he s'mores is to die for!"
Andrea M.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,18,4,5.0,10/18/2015,"Today I had some pepperoni pizza and hibiscus lemonade,  I've come here twice before and usually had the same thing, except I've also tried the calamari which was deliciously crispy and the perfect amount.  Don't have any real complaints about the food, there's a lot of variety from steaks to seafood to hamburgers and pizza. I enjoy the pizza, it's not too greasy and had the right amount of pepperoni. Only thing that was off this time was the hibiscus lemonade, can't quite pinpoint what was different about it this time but still very satisfying visit!"
Teddy B.,"Irvine, CA",0,23,6,4.0,5/26/2015,"Food is fantastic and portions are large.  Calories tend to run high as well...so if you're calorie-conscious watch what you order. Service is usually prompt and the wait time for food is on par with most restaurants. Some of our favorites:  Miso Salmon, Orange Chicken, Chicken Picatta, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, White Chicken Chili, Sausage and Ricotta Flatbread"
Lucy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,10,2.0,5/1/2015,"This place let me down. the 3 times I have been here the service has been weak. I had gone and the wait was 30 min for 2 people. No big deal. But then an hour went by and other people after us were getting seated. So we talked to the Hostess and she never wrote our names down she ""forgot"". Then another 45 min went by and still nothing, so we talked to her. Still she spaced. I should have just left but at that point i was hungry and didnt want to find another place. So we finally got seated. Our food took another 45 min to get to us. Shake my head, this place is dissapointing. Only come here if you dont mind waiting hours."
Emily D.,"Newport Coast, CA",2,10,2,4.0,5/22/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has the best..... CHEESECAKE! (obviously). I also enjoy their calamari appetizer and salad! Their strawberry daquiris are also delicious. We usually visit the Irvine Spectrum and Fashion Island Mall locations. I have never had bad service. The Fashion Island location has better views. I wish that you could bring your dog on the patio, but I'm pretty confident that's not allowed. I have never seen someone bring their dog. It's nice to have that option."
Chon T.,"Orange, CA",253,332,75,4.0,11/15/2012,"3 star quality food, 5 star quality service.  Our server Juan was super attentive and won over our fussy 18 month old son (all it took was a plate  of fries, and a small dessert). Very friendly! We ordered the farro salad, crab dip, the chicken bellagio and the garlic noodles.  the farro salad we ordered was mediocre at best and the crab dip was served lukewarm(not cool).  Chicken bellagio was super rich, with spaghettini in a pesto cream sauce and a hunk of chicken served on top, dressed with arugula to hide the fatness of the dish. Good, bit rich.  The garlic noodles tasted ho-hum, a little too much butter but edible. Overall, not bad.  I didn't expect this chain to blow me away, but the service is always good.  Props for great customer service!"
Carrie C.,"Santa Monica, CA",284,11,2,1.0,9/6/2015,"It was our sisters Birthday day  party of 9 , and my sister made the reservation and made sure to let the host and server know that it was a birthday. No one recognized the birthday ,and when my sister asked to get a cheesecake and put a candle on it . The server said they couldn't do that. I think she thought our intentions was to get a free dessert . But that was not the intent at all. (we wanted to pay for a better dessert)  We wanted something big and meaningful instead of a ounce of whip cream in a port glass as that's how cheesecake celebrates birthdays.  Not to mention half our food came out cold and not all together. So half our table was finished eating while the other half just received our food. Not an great experience at all."
Kathy T.,"Beaverton, OR",6,106,38,2.0,4/25/2015,"They have quite an extensive menu and the food is good but I have to give them only 2 stars due to the terrible service. There was only a 10 minute wait, which was a shock, but we got there at 5:15 since we had 2 toddlers with us ages 1 & 2 1/2 plus 3 adults. We were waited on promptly, ordered, & they brought the kids dinner first like we asked. Then we sat for at least 45 minutes before our food came. Brought out the 2 salads and we waited another 10 minutes for the omelet. Everyone around us ordered after we did and they all had their food. In fact our appetizer came after our dinner. By this time we had been there 1 1/2 hrs and the kids were very restless. The adults had to scarf down dinner. This was totally unacceptable!"
Sal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",293,1582,2037,4.0,10/27/2012,"Had dinner here last night and I enjoyed the place. The staff were nice and the service was quick. The wait was about 25 minutes but I do have to admit it would be nice for those ""your table is ready devices"" to let you walk out a few steps from their establishment. The lobby can get a bit crowded at times. Anyhow, food was great, had me the Chicken Chipotle Pasta and my date had the Cheese-steak, we tried their avocado rolls and then a few cheesecakes (pumpkin & peanut butter). All was great and the prices are wonderful for the portions."
Jody L.,"Irvine, CA",13,28,22,1.0,9/2/2015,"Be careful when deciding on how much you want to leave for a tip. When you go by the suggested amounts based on percentages provided in the bill, they are including the tax in their calculation.   Why are we tipping in tax?"
SUSAN D.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,24,,5.0,8/11/2015,"Great lunch we both had the BBQ Carolina pork sandwich, it was tender and very juicy.  Since their desserts are enough for two we shared a Strawberry Shortcake it was as expected very good lots of Ice Cream which I ate most of and 3 wonderful shortbreads it is without a doubt a great dessert to enjoy on any occasion."
Rick A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,16,,1.0,3/26/2015,"Well I should listen to my own review. The service is no better, and the food came out cold. My GF's food came out later so she ate alone. Won't be back again. Very sad."
David N.,"San Diego, CA",143,46,7,2.0,8/5/2014,"Overpriced for what you get.  The quality didn't seem much better than TGI Fridays, to be honest.  I ordered the mac and cheese burger. The best part of the burger was definitely the fried mac and cheese - but interestingly, when it was paired with the rest of the burger the flavors were lost.  It was only when bits of it fell onto my plate and I ate them separately that I was able to taste it properly.  The meat was lacking flavor.  The veggies were pedestrian.  The fries were good, but not outstanding.   The best part (or possibly worst, depending your stance in the War of the Ring) is having the Eye of Sauron looking over your shoulder at all times.  Don't get what I'm talking about?  Eat at cheesecake factory and look around."
Dave L.,"Irvine, CA",529,100,62,4.0,2/17/2014,"I""m a fan of the Cheesecake Factory because it's solid in all three areas: decor, service, and food quality. The restaurant is massive with a very nice outdoor seating patio.  Inside are booths and three separate rooms. All are with high ceilings and nicely decorated.  The service is consistently good and professional. The menu is huge, but they do have a lighter side menu that offers smaller portions with an emphasis on healthy choices. You can order straight American fair or Asian or even Latin choices. It's all there for you to choose from.  The food is quality and reasonably priced. My favorite is the Cuban sandwich, but there are a lot of other good choices. The iced tea is five star excellent, served in large glasses with free refills the way it should be.  Here are the pros and cons: Pros:  1. Tons of food choices including breakfast burritos all day long. 2. Iced tea is delicious  3. Great place to people watch (Spectrum) 4. Huge portions  5. Cheesecake heaven 6. Great service and good food 7. Reasonably prices Cons: 1. We usually have to wait to sit down.  2. Back room is kind of dark with no window and that's why I prefer to sit in front.  It's a great place to go and is a consistent winner."
Nikki M.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,297,278,3.0,8/3/2014,"Food was good, service not so much. It wasn't very busy, but our waitress was less than attentive. I had the skinnylicious salmon rolls and the hubby had the miso salmon. I also had the blueberry mojito which was good, strong and expensive ($11). I will probably go back, but not for a while."
Jennifer H.,"Lake Forest, CA",689,213,241,4.0,5/21/2014,"Yummy place with a ton of options. My faves are the meatloaf, chicken Romano and piccata. You can't go wrong here and besides: cheesecake. Did I say cheesecake??!!"
