R S.,"Westminster, CA",288,31,19,5.0,7/10/2015,"I had the best lunch in a very long time. My server Mike went above and beyond and accommodated my every request. The food was amazing, the best spicy chicken sandwich I've ever had. I'm very surprised to get such good food and service here, but in definitely coming back. I need more chicken sandwich, cheesecake, and service please!"
Dr. Bradley S.,"San Clemente, CA",156,10,1,4.0,11/8/2015,Delicious food and an amazing birthday lunch. We were greeted by a manager who was very helpful and smiling. Our waitress was attentive and we had very good service. We pasta shrimp scampi which was excellent as was the cheesecake.
Amazing T.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/10/2016,"Terrible service, especially curbside pick-up of to go orders.  I do not think they have ever gotten an order right the first time, take forever to come out the forever to come back with whatever they forgot.  Today, they even came back with the wrong missing items. In addition, more than once the salad I've ordered has had brown lettuce and ingredients that clearly were not fresh. Every couple of months, i think it may be better, but its not so far."
Nick K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",42,32,8,4.0,9/2/2014,"Cheesecake factory is such a wonderful place to eat. I have yet to be disappointed with my several visits to this location. I have been coming here for several years now and always loved the friendly and helpful staff as well as the incredible food. There is such a wide variety of food at Cheesecake it is incredible of how they still find new items to add to their menu. The wait times can be kinda long depending on the day, but even when the place is very busy the quality of service and food is not shortened in the slightest!  One of my favorite waitresses who I am not sure she still works there is Amy! She has to have been the best waitress I have ever had during my experiences at any sit-down restaurant. I for sure recommend this location if you want a great place to catch up with friends, or a simple date night with great decor and atmosphere!"
Kevin J.,"Irvine, CA",233,154,65,2.0,12/30/2014,"we came here on Sunday for brunch and was very disappointed - not in the food but with service and details.  from the 4 place settings, 2 guests ended up with filthy silver wear while all four had water served in way too old and cloudy plastic glasses. The tea was served in a mug that reeked of egg.  server was not too nice... very serious and seemed like she would rather have the day off. she decided to memorize our complex order. she came back 15 minutes later with 3 of 4 orders asking if we were all good and if we needed anything else. we reminded her that we are missing an order and she immediately said the kitchen messed up timing and the other order will be out in 5 minutes.... so obvious she had messed up but offered no apologies whatsoever. naturally we all waited for the last item to arrive 9 minutes later before we all ate. by now everything was cold and very unappealing.  i will not come back for a long time just because the standards here are no longer what they used to be. before it was an experience to go to the Cheesecake Factory now it's only a filling station and glorified Denny's."
Jacelyn C.,"Irvine, CA",21,458,321,3.0,8/2/2014,Food is good. Portions are big. Service not so much. Their hostesses here need some training because this location is always busy. And they cant handle the crowd. Too darn bad.
Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,4.0,11/2/2011,"I like Cheesecake Factory. I do.  This one in particular as it holds some sentimental value for me. But, that's a story for another day.  Like this past weekend, I usually end up here for dessert, later at night, after the dinner rush. Translates to, no wait and better customer service as it's not as busy.  I haven't had a dessert I didn't enjoy. There are some I enjoy more than others but nothing was so bad that I didn't finish them. Considering it was the day before Halloween, I tried their Pumpkin Cheesecake. Nothing negative to say.  The service was awesome as well. I don't remember the server's name but he's waited on my (my party) a few times now. He somehow seems to be able to know when to approach the table or when to leave us alone. Also - geniunely friendly. Not superficial like those who are just working the tip.  Yay! I'm a fan."
Marinette Y.,"Corona, CA",0,5,2,2.0,10/26/2015,Last night my family had a most disappointing experience at this location. The food was late & service was very poor. We usually have Sunday dinner here almost every time we visit Irvine Spectrum but it looks like we're not going to be eating here for a very long time.
Terry S.,"Tustin, CA",252,99,17,1.0,1/24/2016,"I have been wanting to post this for ages, so here is my feedback.  I DREAD going here and can't stand being dragged here by my extended family.  Why?  Because with your HUGE menu you virtually have nothing for a plant based eater aside from a salad, pasta marina and a portobello mushroom burger.  No tofu, no alternative plant meat AND no vegan cheesecake.... Honestly you guys are in the dark ages with regard to your plant based menu and choices and could be appealing to a huge growing population of plant based and vegan eaters.  As a mom, if Cheesecake Factory comes up as an option, like many other mainstream ""blah"" restaurant chains, I adamantly protest and usually get my way.  I am hoping you will read this review and take it into consideration and instead of ignoring us, add a ""plant based"" menu for ""us"" who are quickly growing in number.  Your chain should be offering the BEST vegan cheesecake and leading the way...."
Carly L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1,32,,4.0,8/21/2015,"Perfect for lunch. Soup and salad combo is just enough. Our waiter, Jeffrey, was great very attentive."
Julie N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",10,89,63,2.0,3/3/2014,"Came here on a Fri night and the wait was as expected. Our server, forgot her name, was very nice (hence the 2 stars). Our food, however, was a diff story.  We've been to many Cheesecake Factories, but this one, by far, tasted the most disappointing. My Evelyn's Fav Pasta was bland, my sister's Bistro Shrimp Pasta was tasteless as well, and my mom's Herb Crusted Salmon tasted no bueno.  Should've suck up the rush hr traffic on the 405N and gone to the Bella Terra location."
Esmeralda H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",153,9,,1.0,7/6/2015,"Service is not at all friendly. The food is mediocre to say the least, I had the nachos which were definitely the WORST nachos I've ever had the tortillas on the nachos were mostly burnt, nachos are meant to have cheese they had nearly none. I had a taste(just a taste because I was not tempted to have more) of my nephews orange chicken he ordered.. So dry and had nothing special about it I could have gotten the same plate at Panda Express less expensive and so much tastier. I would defiantly not recommend this location nothing good about it."
A K.,"Irvine, CA",134,35,4,1.0,4/17/2016,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night a little past 11PM so the restaurant wasn't crowded but there were still a good amount of people. We got seated right away by the bar area. When we got seated, I got up to use the restroom and told my boyfriend to order for me. When I got back, he said our server didn't come by yet. I thought that was strange cause usually they come by right when you get seated. Get this, we waited 10 minutes until a nice female server came up to us, shocked, that nobody came around to help us. I was beyond annoyed but she was so nice and apologized and told us that our server, Victor, would be helping us. She took our order and drinks and told us she'll get Victor to help us out now. We waited and this male server came to our table and dropped bread off and said ""We don't have anymore wheat bread so I gave you whatever we have left"" and then he just left. Wtf...No introduction, nothing. I saw that he was waiting the 4 tables in front of us and behind us but not ONCE did he stop by our table after that. I'm not sure if he was supposed to be our server but it felt like he was purposely avoiding us. At one point, my boyfriend and I thought he was racist and refused to wait our table. The nice female server dropped off our food and still no word on Victor. When we were done, we grabbed her and told her what we encountered with the male server and that Victor never once stopped by our table. She apologized profusely and assured us that service at the restaurant really isn't this bad. We tipped her cash, didn't tip Victor and left.  How terrible is that!? What kind of service is this! I left the restaurant flabbergasted...never have I encountered such terrible customer service. But anyways, shout out to the female server that helped us that night! Even though she clocked out, she made sure we were taken care of. And, Victor, where the hell were you, man!? I'm making sure I call the manager and letting him/her know the lack of service you provided and how completely unprofessional you are. Since you work at a restaurant and wait tables, I have a little advice for you: Do your job. It might help."
Will M.,"Santa Ana, CA",554,646,2467,4.0,10/18/2009,"Overall a nice Sunday lunch again.  We had a different waitress than last time. Though Janelle W. was new, she definitely knew the menu. I played dumb, not hard for me, and she knew exactly how they  prepared each dish, a welcome relief from some places where they hire them without knowing anything about their menu. She also was not shy telling us her favorite things on the menu, and why she'd recommend them. About the Caesar salad she asked if you liked the authentic version with anchovy paste in the dressing, otherwise the more typical green salad might be better with your choice of dressing.  She was very friendly, food arrived promptly, food was as good as usual, and few minor complaints.   The warm bread came out with the too-hard butter. Someone forgot to set our table with bread plates, so when the bread arrived, we had to wait for plates.  The host also didn't bring the special value friendly menu that had specials like caramel chicken. I had to ask if that was still available, and the waitress grabbed the proper menu.   So caramel chicken ($13) is what I ordered. It's like orange chicken with a tinge of caramel in the orange sauce with an overall sweet-sour-salty-taste with a little kick.  They put carrots, crispy green beans, mushrooms togeher atop crispy fried chicken breast.  Overall very good especially when it first arrives, and the sauce hasn't made the breading limp. Like some of the people you may have dated, it's  something to enjoy now but not take home, and it's served with rice. The other orders on our table were cheese quesadilla ($8) appetizer and the sausage pizza lunch ($12) that came with the small bowl of caesar or green salad.  The soft drink prices have climbed to $3.00 now, but I had the 16 oz Hefeweizen on tap ($6). They kept the soft drink glasses filled.  It's a family friendly place so they did have the usual crying kids. Also, I'm not usually into the interior of places too much, but today, I just happened to notice how nice the walls and ceiling and overall style of this place is.  It was a very good lunch overall."
Melissa R.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",1,24,2,5.0,7/18/2015,Every time I go there service is great and food is amazing!  Of course I stock up on cheesecake.  They always keep my water glass full and to me that is important since I drink tons of water and means they are paying attention.  I love to take friends and family there!
T P.,"Orange County, CA",1,510,190,5.0,4/25/2016,"We came here on a Saturday night after watching a movie.   We sat at a high round table in the bar area and ate cheesecake and drank wine.  It is certainly busy Sat night, even after 9:30 pm.   Our waitress was great, easy going, funny and served us well.  We know that she could have made a bigger tip if a foursome sat down, regardless, she took very good care of us and we tipped her graciously.  Great place for night cap."
Lillian T.,"New York, NY",320,186,648,4.0,7/14/2012,"They gave us bread and butter for starters. I would have preferred to eat it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar like Italian restaurants do, but oh well. I am not sure if they provide those. Besides that, I love their Cajun jumbalaya pasta! I was afraid it'd be too spicy, but it turned out it wasn't spicy at all. I would definitely come here again."
Khalid S.,"Eden Prairie, MN",0,7,1,5.0,8/4/2015,I like this restaurant they have a variety of food so you have many choices i dont like fried chicken except there ( cujan chicken ) i believe it's strip of chicken but taste amazing try it i will pay for your order .. Heyyy i am joking
Matt D.,"Irvine, CA",437,45,36,4.0,8/15/2013,"I have been here here more than 20 times.I also visit many others CCF but i must say that this is the best one so far. I always get same thing every CCF branch but here has the best taste . Cons; too cold and back circle area is the worst place that you can eat in that restaurant,everyone is so close to each other and always less waitress there."
Neluta G.,"Anaheim, CA",187,699,1832,2.0,4/4/2014,"Not a place of choice, if the rest of the group I am with wants to go there then I will go. The menu is large, each dish loaded with thousands of calories. They do have lighter items too, but they are average, like the grilled tuna salad."
