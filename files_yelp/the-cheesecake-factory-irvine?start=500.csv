Nicole D.,"Framingham, MA",13,64,131,2.0,2/9/2014,"I'm so saddened to have to update my review because it means my opinion since my first review has changed. My husband and I decided to grab lunch here today as we normally do on the weekends. Today wasn't overly crowded considering it was a weekend. However the service was considerably slow and our waitress was incredibly overwhelmed. She was very kind but my husband and I, along with the neighboring tables who she was responsible for, felt forgotten.  We placed our orders. I ordered the soup of the day as my appetizer and we each ordered entrees. The bread came out and my soup didn't. We waited for my soup for about 10 minutes and it eventually came about 2 minutes before our entrees ( so the table space was limited).  My plate was hot but the food on it was like warm... That didn't make sense.  I should also note that we were seated before a neighboring party of 4 and they all got their appetizers and entrees before my soup even came out.  My husband ordered a spicy buffalo chicken sandwich and asked for a side of blue cheese crumbles. It came out with blue cheese dressing,which was no big deal. We simply asked the food runner for the crumbles and that came our right away. Our server checked on us and we asked for more buffalo sauce since there was only a dash on the sandwich. It took about 10 minutes to get that ( and we had to remind her). So by the time my husband could enjoy his meal it was cold. That was disappointing.  We wanted dessert but there was no way I was going to sit around and wait for that. I just witnessed the party of 4 next to us wait about 15 minutes for their dessert. So we asked for the check which took another 10 minutes. We paid the bill and walked up to the to go counter and got our dessert in less than 3 minutes.  I felt our waitress was incredibly overwhelmed. I really feel like we spent the entire time just waiting. It took away from our dining experience. So I guess we will see what happens the next time we decide to eat there. I should also note that normally we sit along the wall with the windows that face the valet parking. Today we dined in the room over where the bar is. I wonder if the window tables just get better service."
Mark F.,"Lake Forest, CA",43,62,58,3.0,5/17/2015,"Went here to grab a bite after work with the wife, and have to say the food and service were decent. Had the mushroom and Swiss burger which was not bad, but the food just didn't thrill me. I guess I just expected a bit more for the prices you pay."
Jenny R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,1,4.0,10/12/2014,Just got from dinner.we celabretad my dear husband 40 year birthday!!(-: The staff where amazing  the ravioli even better.. Can't wait for my next visit there.. Ohhh and by the way the browniecheese is the best cake i ever had lol
Mary F.,"Culver City, CA",5,50,43,3.0,6/1/2014,"Very noisy. Bad seating, cramped places.  Bad receptionist, probably a racist/elitist.  Good food. Good service."
Corey P.,"Long Beach, CA",141,57,7,4.0,2/1/2015,"I really like this location, the service is always great, my partner and I are always seated within 15 minutes. My last visit was the best, our server was Jenae and she was awesome, she had great suggestions about the menu, she has a great personality, and was very attentive. Ps the peanut butter Adams cheesecake was delicious!"
Sheri W.,"Silverado, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/13/2016,"Outstanding service by Jonathan O., however the food left a lot to be desired.  Pasta was underdone and over salted.  Cheesecake Factory has declined in their food quality, especially for the price.  Will not be returning."
Haihey S.,"Irvine, CA",92,172,31,3.0,9/7/2013,"I typically like coming to The Cheesecake Factory, because the menu is vast, and the food is pretty consistent no matter where you go.  Obviously, I would give the cheesecake 5/5 for breadth of selection and consistent quality. The service is typically quite good across the board.  Also, 5/5 stars for having their ""Skinnylicious"" menu offerings. It is a separate menu altogether that has about 50 different menu items all under approx. 600 calories. The walnut and pear salad is very good from the Skinnylicious menu.  However, the reason I am giving only 3 stars is that they recently CHANGED their normal menu, and I believe the quality has decreased as a result.  My husband enjoys their nachos, however when he ordered them today, instead of the regular melted cheese on top, it came with what looked like cheese whiz all over the top. We asked the waiter what had changed and he went back to the kitchen and came back to us and said instead of melted cheese, they now put ""cheese sauce"" on top. He said they had menu-wide changes that went into effect three weeks ago, and this was on of them.  Not impressed so far :("
Troy E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",291,66,27,2.0,5/8/2012,"I've been to several different cheesecake factories, but this one was probably the worst.   Cons:  The girl who sat us, was very unfriendly, and didn't say a word when she sat us.  With the open kitchen next to most of the seating, it is loud, and sounds more like a deli/bar than a restaurant.  The floors have a weird waxy feel and my date almost slipped and fell in her heels.  I ordered the chicken and biscuits, the chicken was severely overcooked, and the gravy, when expo'd to the table had a film, like it had been sitting for awhile.  My date's chicken madeira was burnt, and we both agreed that we would never visit this location ever again. Pros: The service was good."
Elissa S.,"Irvine, CA",112,8,5,1.0,2/12/2015,"I used to visit this place on a regular basis because of how excellent their cheese cake was, but I will not be returning ever again because their staff and manger Megan was so rude to myself and my guests last time we tried to dine there! I am Australian and have been living in America for the past year. I used to rave to my friends and family back home about the cheese cake and have taken everyone of my friends there when they come to visit. I still hold my Australian drivers license and by law it is still valid and I can not apply for a Californian drivers license until my residency is fully approved! My Australian ID contains a microchip, a hologram of my country and being that my date of birth was 24 years ago using it to purchased alcoholic beverages has never caused an issue before! Last night one older lady waitress and her ""manager"" Megan, accused me of forgery and told me they could not accept my form of ID! The staff were so ignorant of my accent and anything my husband or his parents had to say about my license. I personally hardly ever drink, being that we were out celebrating MY BIRTHDAY, I thought one cocktail would be nice, if the manager had spoken to us with some kind of politeness in her tone I would have been happy to just drink water, instead she constantly stood over our table talking at us about how they don't accept anything other then a Californian drivers license. Even though I had used it there previously on several occasions!  My husband, his parents and myself were all bullied out of the restaurant because of there staffs lack of knowledge, her attitude and the way she spoke to us all was disgusting. As long as that girl still has a job at the cheese cake factory myself, my husband his family or mine will never visit there again!!!"
John S.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/8/2016,"Went there today for Mothers a Day, moms pick even though the kids don't like the place. Waited an hr for table which is understandable for the day. Was there twice the past 2 weeks with friends visiting CA.  Nice lunch, good food and service. We ordered 5 pieces of cheese to take home and enjoy while opening presents. Only had 4 pieces in the bag. I called to let them know. Was asked for my ticket number and server name. manager Mike comes on and tells me ""we"" can't offer you credit on something you didn't pay for? Great customer service. He then tells me we weren't charged for some random swirls type? I asked him how he came up with that choice? If we didn't pay for it? He asks me what types did you get than? Really, I ask my wife and kids what they ordered and again I told him we ordered 5 and got 4??? I never asked for a free piece but thought after spending $180 for lunch a more professional approach would have been, I'm very sorry for the confusion it's crazy here today how can I help. After three visits in a month, it will be my last. The kids laughed and said dad they don't care, I told them I've heard that before at Blockbuster and Sears during their heydays!! I guess they get a lot of people calling looking for a free piece of cheesecake!!!"
Cristel P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,7,3,5.0,7/30/2015,"On July 29 my friend and I came in after a late night movie, an hour before closing. Our server Alec (who was still training) did an outstanding job, he recommended the banana cheesecake which was superb. He has a great attitude I will definitely be back and request for his service."
Todd S.,"Corona, CA",0,10,8,5.0,8/30/2014,Stopped here on our anniversary for dessert.  I could not believe how great the staff was.  They made us feel quite special.  We will come back.
OrangeCounty E.,"Foothill Ranch, Foothill Ranch, CA",1,27,,1.0,3/21/2016,"i can't eat here anymore.   I took my family here for dinner and ordered sliders, fries and a diet coke.  Nothing too difficult.  My burgers were really dry and overcooked.  The fries were very clearly leftovers from sitting in a heat pan for a long time since they were the consistency of crusty cardboard.  To top off the sub-par food quality, I politely mentioned to our server that i couldn't finish because the food was not edible and she just said ""oh, ok"" and walked off.  Given the hundreds and hundreds of other options for eating in Orange County, I won't be coming back to this place."
Kevin H.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,31,7,4.0,8/24/2014,"Today, I was visiting the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum.  This location is big.  It has alot of indoor seating, as well as outdoor seating.  This location is also very busy every time I come by.   On this particular visit, it was busy as usual.  Considering the pure number of customers here, the wait wasn't very bad.  I arrived towards the later part of dinnertime. I met my waitress Melanie.  She was very nice and accommodating.    As many people know, the menu here has alot of things to try, but today I was going to keep it simple and order spaghetti and meatballs.  Melanie comes back to inform me that they were *out of meatballs.  ok then....I told her I was interested in the rib eye steak.  *Denied!  They were out.  I then ordered something much less interesting: a burger.  Like many restaurants it appears the burger was cooked at a little too high a temperature resulting in a little surface charring.  Regardless, the charring was not too much to overlook.  Overall, I would give the burger an 8.  It was actually a good burger.  Partly into the meal, the manager...Anh?  can out and he told me the burger was on him.  Nice.  That was the proper thing to do in that situation.  As a customer, I appreciate the gesture to make up for what happened earlier.   Overall, Melanie was a very good server.  She was very friendly, and accommodating.  The manager passed my test, and performed great customer service by doing the right thing, and making it up to me.   This review I give them a 4 star.  If there were no hitches, I would not have had a problem giving them a 5 star. Suggestions: 1) Service was a little slow getting my water and initial bread.  Perhaps something can be done to make the customer wait less.   2) Maybe track sales better, and order more food based off those reports. General Impression:  This is a busy but good location."
Al S.,"Irvine, CA",58,10,2,1.0,2/11/2015,"I come here about 3 days a week at various times with friends and clients. I just had the worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. Megan, the manager, was completely rude to us. So much for a nice dinner on my wife's birthday... Glad to know I'll not be frequenting this establish ever again."
Ray H.,"Irvine, CA",31,328,1127,4.0,10/20/2013,"Had a 15 people group b-day lunch here and I am surprised they took good care of us. Been coming here for over 10 years and this is still my favorite restaurant in the Irvine Spectrum. Whether it is the fresh salad or hot pasta, the food has not disappointed me yet. Overall: Food          4 Service      4 Price          4 Ambience 4"
M L.,"Irvine, CA",379,413,196,4.0,10/14/2013,"I'm a sucker for cheesecake... and so far this is still the best cheesecake I've had. If you know a better place, please PM me. I don't like how extensive the menu here is. I already have trouble deciding between 2-3 places to eat, let alone 40 menu items. Over the years, I think I've tried them all (or at least 50%). My favorite is the Chicken Bellagio ($15). One thing I've learned is that the pasta dishes tend to all be pretty decent and are ""safe"" choices (taste-wise, not health-wise). Don't look at the nutritional content because it will make you cry. When it comes to cheesecake, I think some of their options are a little over the top. Flavors like Oreo Dream Extreme, Hershey's Chocolate Bar, Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake, they're just way, way, way too ridiculously sweet. I like to keep it simple with the Pumpkin Cheesecake (only in fall), Dulce de Leche, Chocolate Mousse, or the plain Oreo."
Hanriette T.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/31/2014,"I been in to many Cheesecake Factory for last 10 years but hits on in Irvine is the worse I have ever been the food vas not good the fries was stall and old & cold the service was the very very very bad theater ting  front desk reception to the waiter the manager the entire place and management should be change in my opinion. I will never go back to this cheesecake ever again . Just don't go,  find some other restaurant,"
Wayne N.,"Anaheim, CA",108,29,5,4.0,5/24/2015,Had a very nice time at the Irvine location. Service was above average and food about average. They were very attentive to refills and water. Haven't been to one in years and was impressed. Strong recommendation.
Elle C.,"Irvine, CA",63,670,605,4.0,2/13/2012,"My eyes grow to the exaggerated size of those cartoon animals as I study the display of cheesecakes and cakes at the entrance -- I love a place with so many dessert options! The dim lighting, the decorative walls, and the colors makes me feel any meal here is a celebration. We finally visited for Sunday brunch. Although we arrived soon after opening, I was disappointed that we passed several bright-and-open window tables; we were, instead, seated at one of the 2 dull booths with a view of the door leading to the restroom (my error; I should've made my request earlier). As if our seating location wasn't enough of a disappoitment, the table exuded a rank smell of stale sponge/rag -- so unpleasant. I've detected that disagreeable smell at some fast-food counters, but didn't expect it here. Thankfully, the seating location and the smell was eased by the fact that we had a very sweet and pleasant server; in addition, the food was delightful, attractive, and generous (no room for dessert this visit). Next time, I'm hoping they'll have replaced (or at least washed) their cleaning rags, and I'm requesting a different section"
