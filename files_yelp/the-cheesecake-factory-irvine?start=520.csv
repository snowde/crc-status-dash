Jose F.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3,1,,1.0,5/11/2015,"So I want to start of by saying I'm a server so I don't get annoyed when foods takes to long, or the wait is to long, or the server makes an error because it happens to everyone.... but when our server (Jessica) is clearly discriminating use because we are Hispanic and ""we aren't"" going to tip good that's not ok! Especially since it was on mother days and I worked a 10 hour shift after we got early brunch. She took our order and then never talked to use or asked if we needed anything till we where done! I'm a server so I can tell when a server is busy or if they aren't able to handle what's going on but she wasn't just not paying attention to use! Yet still tipped her 18%... I understand the stereo type and I get it but I treat every table the same regardless of who they are!"
Maria L.,"Tustin, CA",0,43,20,3.0,3/24/2014,"My family is a regular at Cheesecake Factory coz it has such a huge menu you can't usually go wrong. The servers are usually very nice and attentive every time we dine at this location.  I took two stars off for a couple things: 1) the music on Sunday 3/23 was super loud and our server couldn't hear us while she took our orders. Got the type of pasta wrong (I asked for angel hair & got tube pasta) but it still tasted good so no biggie.  The other star off was for: 2) the main thing that bothered me was when we got served the food. My son is 4 1/2 and ordered Mac & cheese (shocker!) It's usually good and appeases his appetite. BUT yesterday when they brought the dish, it was SUPER HOT!!! I could barely touch the bowl coz it felt like it was straight out of the over and the mac & cheese was bubbling hot! I get that they wanna serve it hot to the customers... But not scalding hot to a child! My son couldn't eat it for several minutes. I had to keep stirring the dish & blowing on each spoonful to cool it down. Pretty annoying and quite dangerous when being served to a child!  Other than that annoyance we would go back and just request they don't burn my child's tongue with the food temp.  We totally could've pulled a Kramer and burned myself with the food then sued! But that's just not my style!"
Marvel Z.,"Irvine, CA",524,249,276,5.0,3/8/2013,"I love cheesecake factory! I have been to multiple cheesecake factory locations a dozen times in my life and I realized that this place is always good if you order the right thing.... and turn a blind eye to the nutrition facts.  Some of my favorites!  1. Chicken Ballagio - angle hair pasta tossed in a light pesto sauce with perfectly moist breaded chicken breast topped with pieces of prosciutto and a light arugula salad.  2. Shrimp bistro pasta - pasta in a light cream sauce filled with shrimp, veges, and peppers.  3. Original cheesecake - not too sweet and perfectly sinful"
Ashley F.,"Irvine, CA",385,141,126,4.0,4/28/2011,Came here during lunch with one of my co workers. They have many selection of foods so it was hard to decide what to eat. I just wish they had more pictures in their menu. It helps me to see what i will be ordering looks good or not.  I ended up ordering the grilled salmon   and my co worker ordered the  sandwich and soup. When we got our entrées the portions were big and for how much we were paying it was so worth it.  My salmon was cooked to perfection and was very good. The mashed potatoes though were a bit salty and my broccoli was still raw which I do not like. For dessert we got the red velvet cheese cake. It was so good and the slice is a decent size.
Lucy P.,"Newport Coast, CA",2,13,,3.0,7/26/2015,"They have a great location, Ive always had good things to say about this location. Recently my friend and I placed a curb side order and we had to wait 35min for them to bring it to us. We had to call twice and it sounded like they had forgotten to tell the bakery that we were waiting at the valet area."
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,4.0,7/25/2011,"I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in the Irvine Spectrum last week with a friend and had a great time.   The place is really nice and it was quite crowded, especially for a Tuesday night.  I was seated relatively quickly (considering it's cheesecake factory).  We sat in the back in the round domed area.  Our waitress was really sweet and kept bringing out bread and butter.  She also was really nice about giving us a lot of time to order and was patient.   I ordered the cajun jambalaya pasta and it was delicious.  It had chicken and shrimp and had lots of cajun spices.  It was extremely filling and I actually had to take half of it home, which became a wonderful breakfast for the morning after. What I've noticed is that, as I'm sure is the case with many other restaurants, their ""healthiest/lower-calorie"" foods are the most expensive.  Believe it or not, the cajun jambalaya I ordered was one of the lowest-calorie items listed under the specialty pasta section of their nutrition menu.     In all, this place was really nice. One thing, though, is that the floor was really slippery in one area and I almost slipped and fell so I told the nearest employee there about it and asked if he could do something about it so that others wouldn't fall but he just stood there and stared and gave me an attitude... it was pretty weird.  Honestly, he should want to clean that up because the restaurant could be sued if someone slipped and fell.  Trust me, one does not need to take Torts to know that much.   In all, this place is cute and my friend really enjoyed celebrating her birthday here."
Carter L.,"Arcadia, CA",209,33,58,1.0,9/16/2014,"This particular location was like a Dyson vacuum, it never lost ""SUCK-tion"" We had ordered 4 dishes and 1 appetizer, and sadly 3 out of the 4 entrées were untouched because of over use of oil/butter and salt. Customer service boggled this staff so beware. Look elsewhere to dine trust me."
Diana B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",50,10,9,5.0,5/10/2014,"The best food at The Cheesecake Factory is Miso Salmon and Jamaican black pepper shrimp ( shrimp only, not the combo chicken and shrimp - you get around 18 shrimps )! It's worthed to try them ! Just amazing !  From the Skinny menu - shrimp tacos , Mexican salad or the steak medallions ! The best food ever !!!!"
Rob W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",186,15,8,4.0,3/27/2013,"Wow...I normally don't write reviews for ""chain stores"", but today is the exception. I went to The Cheesecake factory the other night and was pleasantly surprised! With the exception of the wait the experience was great. The service was phenomenal. If you have the ability to get Lauren's station, do it. She was GREAT. I normally tip pretty decent because I understand how the service industry works, but Lauren got a little extra. She made the night. The drinks were on time, the bread was full, meal served timely, and she served with a smile and didn't give that ""hovering"" feeling. I hope Cheesecake Factory reads this and give her a big Kudos. The food was above par and better than my last time at ""The Cheesecake Factory"", but this time I had a plan. There was no way I was going to read through that 30 page menu so I just told Lauren my 2 choices of what I wanted and she told me what it matched on the menu...Thanks again, the Pork chop was great. The ambiance was pleasant, which is common for Cheesecake Factory..all in all a worthy enough experience for a review of one of ""the chain guys"""
Nathaniel C.,"Long Beach, CA",9,27,4,1.0,2/28/2015,EAT AT YOUR OWN HEALTH RISK! We waited to be seated for a half hour then all nine pieces of silverware they brought us had pieces of food on them...
Sondor E.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",693,85,48,3.0,10/5/2014,"Alright, it's safe to say that this Cheesecake Factory location is mediocre at best. The server took like 20 min to get our drinks. The food was okay, we got everything to go. Not impressed."
Franco C.,"San Gabriel, CA",7,8,1,1.0,7/23/2013,"Food poisoning. We went here 07/21/2013, group of 4 friends. It had been a while since I went to cheesecake factory, it's not my dream restaurant but it's usually ok.  We ordered 2 hamburgers, a salad and a sandwich. We eat and go home.  Day after we are all nauseous and feeling sick. I know food poisoning and I can recognize it.  This is the last time I eat here. For cheesecake kitchen managers: you most likely have a bacteria contamination widespread in your kitchen."
Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1723,1189,1870,3.0,4/18/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is usually hit and miss. Back in the day, I used to love eating here however it would take me forever to decide what I wanted to eat. If you've never been, the menu is exhaustive. I think it's over 20 pages long and has an equally overwhelming dessert selection. I visited this location to meet up with a friend and grab some dinner. Despite there being a mad crowd of Spring Break teens, the wait was only 30 minutes and seemed to be shorter than that. We were seated quickly and bread arrived promptly.  I couldn't figure out what I wanted - again. I was debating the popular pasta dish - the jambalaya but settled on the stuffed chicken tortillas. As if the menu wasn't bad enough, the portions are gargantuan. I got through about half of it before I just couldn't eat anymore.  I was considering dessert but this is one of those places you have to eat dessert first and then get a half portion of dinner or forgo dessert for another day. I settled for coffee instead.  Overall, my meal was pretty good. The chicken was spicy and the tortillas were topped with a pico de gallo salsa mix and served with corn cakes and sour cream. Next time I might just try the jambalaya.."
B T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",7,106,12,1.0,1/6/2015,Came here not so busy Tuesday evening. Ended up walking out after our food didn't arrive for 45 minutes and the waitress never checked in our table. Been plenty times pleased at other locations.
Laura B.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",2,45,,3.0,2/16/2015,The service here is wonderful. The food was not that great. The grande burrito I would not recommend. It was gross. My favorite is the squaw bread. It's amazing but it was burnt today.
Sothea M.,"Long Beach, CA",151,87,19,4.0,1/5/2015,One of my favorite places to eat at! I love their tropical ice tea. It comes unsweetened but you can always add sugar if you want it sweet. Their fried mac and cheese is good. They're rolled up Mac and cheese balls that are deep fried with marinara sauce. Fried calamari is crispy and they give you two sauce to dip it with. The meatloaf is huge! Everything there is huge! You can definitely share it with another person. Can't go home without a slice of cheesecake.. Mmm
Sandy V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",122,376,329,4.0,1/2/2013,"2 extra stars for the great server Brianna R.  I tried the curb side pick up for the first time.  You call in your order and in about 20 mins you park on the curb, call inside and someone will bring out your food.  I dont know what was going on the day I was here but I guess Valet was the place to be.  This made me feel like a sitting duck while the valets maneuvered cars about 3 inches from my bumper.   I ordered about 8 entrees for my office holiday party and was nervous about not getting what I ordered.  I asked the Brianna if she could please make sure my order was correct.  I would have gone inside and checked myself but I was not allowed to leave my car..... :(   The Brianna not only made sure that the order was checked by the manager but personally did a 3rd inspection! I ordered everything from steak, burgers, jambalaya, to an entire tray of Tiramisu and it was Divine!  Nobody complained and all the food was correct.   Food was exactly as you would expect but service was above average for a Cheesecake Factory."
Bomby K.,"Chicago, IL",53,67,50,1.0,2/5/2013,"I did a phone order for curbside pick up. I got there 20 minutes later and the lady whom answered the phone said someone will be  right out.. 10 minutes later Brianna Came out with my bill and I gave her my gift card with a $400.14 balance on it as of 2/1/2013). about 15 minutes later she returned with my food and receipt but ""forgot"" my giftcard.  I told her that there was a very large balance on it and i will need to call and confirm that she gave the correct one back. She said she would be right back.. well 10 minutes later Patrick walks out to me because I've been sitting at their curbside pickup for over 30 minutes now and I explained that Brianna lost my $400 gift card.  He said he would go find her... another 5 minutes or so passes and Casper ( Kassandra) comes out and says its lost and apologizes.. gives me her card and takes my information... I think that it is ridiculous that they 1) did not offer my now cold meal for me for free at this point because of their incompetent employee but just as a gesture of customer service and making me wait for over 30 minutes at curbside when I called it in.. ( now it had  been nearly an hour!) and 2) why couldn't they just use the balance to put it on a new gift card for me instead of ""going through corporate and having it mailed out"" This is horrible customer service.. and now I have to wait weeks before I get my gift card.  I obviously know that they are able to do this because they did it on Friday, Feb 1st for me!!!  SO frustrating!!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!"
Diana C.,"Corona, CA",204,691,796,4.0,11/5/2013,Always great and willing to host large parties. I come here all the time with large parties of 10-12 and the staff is always willing to accommodate. Service here can be a hit or miss. Some waiters are on point and some forget about our existence until our meal is almost over. in the end we keep coming back to this place for the food. They have great food at reasonable prices and give large portions. I could never finish my Chicken Bellagio even though it is delicious!
Tina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",207,136,518,3.0,10/19/2013,I do like this place for a variety of food.  Been coming here for years and probably one of the best chain restaurants.
