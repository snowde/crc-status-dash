Cynthia R.,"Corona, CA",24,2,,4.0,2/14/2015,"The steak Diane is good. I wouldn't recommend the club sandwich, their was nothing spectacular about it.  The drinks are a little pricey. The service is good and very friendly."
Jaqueline Y.,"Tustin, CA",429,273,334,3.0,10/15/2012,"Dropped by for Nam's brother's birthday. Usually we get the Chicken bellagio which is pretty good, but Nam had a craving for the rib eye steak. Most of the plates I've seen served at Cheesecake Factory have had excellent presentation. The pasta is always well garnished on a large plate and comes served steaming hot and looking delicious. However, the steak that Nam ordered looked like something you would've seen served in a hospital cafeteria. It came on a small plain white dish in a pool of its juices, about half the size of the pasta plates, with a small bowl of fries on the side. Restaurants should know that customers eat with their eyes first, and this did not look appetizing at all. Especially at $26 a plate. I could've made this at home! The steak itself is a no frills type steak. No sauce, no garnish, just a slab of steak. Taste-wise it was about as plain as it looked. Very tender and good meaty flavor but lacking in even the salt and pepper it seemed.  Overall the family meal experience was pleasant, all except for the steak. Frown."
Craig L.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/28/2014,Everything is pure GOLD!!!!! Amazing Food and Huge portions. First time at the Cheese Cake Factory and absolutely loved it. Much Love all the way from Sunny South Africa to The Cheesecake Factory in Sunny SoCal!
Damien O.,"Irvine, CA",0,23,,5.0,4/26/2014,Excellent food and service every time.. Eat here regularly both week nights and weekends and love it. Can be busy but worth the wait
Tiny T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,12,,2.0,8/26/2014,"My wife and i visited this place in mid of Aigust 2014 while shopping at Spectrum. We made the choice thinking we would have the usual good service and food. My rating is heavily weighted on the service part of it. Our table was very dirty, if it wasnt for us asking the waiter to clean it, we would have been surrounded a very dirty table. The waiter was very slow and almost never available to serve. At some point he smelled like cigarettes. When it was time for payment, he circled the tip section of the receipts and asked me that i need to use one of the percentages that appeared there. Luckily for him my wife convinced me to increase it to 10%, down from 5% that i was thinking of giving him. The food good but not Cheesecake Factory good."
Michelle M.,"Irvine, CA",1220,350,2397,3.0,10/12/2010,"Is it weird that I come to Cheesecake Factory not for their cheesecakes, but for their Strawberry Shortcake?   In my opinion, their cheesecakes are a little too thick and hard to chew, but I am absolutely in LOOOOOOOOVEEEEE with their tasty strawberry shortcake.  Why you ask?  Well, just look at the picture!  They give you generous amounts of strawberries and they taste so sweet with every bite!  In between the two shortcakes, you have massive globs of vanilla ice cream.  Mmm..vanilla is my favorite.  Right on top, they add in another generous layer of strawberries and top it off with a load of whipped cream.  Basically a heart attack waiting to happen if you eat this baby, but it's so worth it!  Pair it with a hot cappuccino and go to town on that baby! If you come here to meet up your friends for drinks, try getting the Carribean Cooler.  It basically tastes like strawberries with whipped cream with a little punch of alcohol.  It is so delicious and my friend Christine and I make sure we order it every time we come here. Other than that, you really can't go wrong with any of the foods here.  The food comes out pretty consistent each time I am here.  Service is okay- not great. Also, this Cheesecake can get pretty crowded during the lunch and dinner hours!!  Wait times can be anywhere from 20-45 minutes.  So keep that in mind and plan accordingly!"
Natassia C.,"Anaheim, CA",1,18,6,1.0,12/31/2014,"I had such a bad experience here, my boyfriend took me here for what we thought was going to be a nice dinner and the service was terrible, everything took a really long time and when we finally got the food it was so salty that i immediately lost my appetite and felt sick, I'd never experienced that before and it was just such a bummer. I might as well have swallowed the salt shaker. Ruined my night and i wont be going back. Zero stars."
Frances G.,"Orange County, CA",126,397,770,3.0,6/20/2011,"This is just for the cheesecake. It was my mom's birthday and she had a craving for Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake (it's been years since we last had one).  She ended up picking out a 7"" strawberry cheesecake ($28.95) to eat with the family, and a slice of the banana cream cheesecake ($6.95) and an upside down pineapple cheesecake ($6.95) just to see what it tastes like. I was actually caught off guard to hear that the strawberry cheesecake was frozen.  The girl behind the counter told us that we couldn't eat it right away and would have to wait until it thaws.  The strawberries were frozen too.  Luckily, we were planning to eat it as an after dinner dessert, and we had enough time for it to thaw out until then.  When we did try it, no one could tell it was frozen before. Although the sliced cheesecakes are a lot smaller than I last remembered, they're still very creamy goooood.  The banana cream one had a layer of, what else, banana cream on top of the cheesecake layer and freshly sliced banana on top, and the pineapple upside down one was just that with cheesecake layered in between. Just beware that a slice alone is like almost eating a whole day's worth of calories (a slice of the banana cream is supposedly 925 calories, and the pineapple upside down is 1187 calories...).  Gaaaaah."
Katrina N.,"Irvine, CA",91,390,1861,5.0,2/16/2011,"We came on a weekday around 6ish?  So serivce was really good. I dont know if it was becaues they weren't as busy on a weekday or that we beat the dinner rush. Ofcourse i chose the seared ahi tuna tataki salad.  It was AWESOME! I would know becuaes  if you've read my previous review, all I eat is seared ahi tuna.  These tasted good becuase of the slightly sour dipping sauce and prefectly tossed salad.   And of course the avocado doesn't hurt. This dish is definetly recommended for all you fish lovers and those that want to be adventurous and try something raw.  Service was great and very attentive.  Thanks cheese cake in irvine!"
Alice C.,"London, United Kingdom",460,403,55,4.0,8/13/2013,Cheesecake Factory is always good with their extensive menu selections. The hardest thing is choosing what to order.  Oh how I wish they would take reservations so I can come for dinner instead of lunches.
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1032,765,1723,1.0,7/31/2010,"The family and I were in town and we decided to give this place a visit after a long day. I called ahead and talked to a guy named ""Christopher"" I believe, and he told me there was ""no wait"" and I didn't have to worry about not getting a table.  We arrive 15 mins later from our hotel nearby.  To our surprise, there's a crowd of people inside and outside the door. Families were bunched together, sitting on the lobby benches. Strollers and children everywhere. We were told it was a 30 minute wait, MINIMUM. We were obviously misled and lied to, just so we can make the trouble to arrive.  We've been loyal and happy customers of this restaurant chain.... until now. Disappointed and with very hungry kids in tow, we decided to leave and headed out to Ruby's Diner instead.  Hey Christopher....you're an asshole. I hope the karma truck runs your ass over. I also hope your boss reads my review and reprimands you."
S Y.,"Anaheim, CA",0,93,4,2.0,12/20/2014,"came here on a Friday evening with two small children, we had walked the whole spectrum to get to the restaurant so by the time we got there we were ok with waiting.  we took the pager and waited, and waited, with two small children under age 2, and then finally!  our pager goes off and we can be seated.  But no!  Do not be deceived!  they have a SECOND waiting area!  So your pager goes off, and then they escort you to ANOTHER waiting area where the other bozos like you are standing around, waiting AGAIN.   So at that point, after we had gotten our two hungry and ancy kids up and thinking we were going to start eating, we were upset.  So we turned around and decided to eat at the bar, where they have multiple small booths and some tall tables with stools.  One of the staff told us we could take the booth in the corner of the bar, which we gladly did.  We got our kids settled and finally all was good.  But no!!!!!!!!!! our server came up and said that actually that we are not allowed to sit at that table and that we have to get up!  WHAT?????????????  At this point, I said no - please go check it out, we are at the bar and it's open seating, AND your own staff member set us up here.  So he goes back to check and then comes back and tells us that we have a table assigned to us in a different location.   Basically we refused to uproot the kids and trek across the restaurant again to get to a different ""assigned"" table.  This whole system about the second level waiting area was frustrating enough - not to mention being guided to an OPEN SEATING TABLE at the BAR and then being told we can't sit there?  They need to get their act together.  Totally ruined the experience.  My husband ordered the Jambalaya, I ordered the Salmon Salad, we also got a grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots for the kids.  The grilled chicken for the kids was perfect, delicious.  The Jambalaya was also very good.  The salmon salad was definitely 2/5 stars - apparently the salmon is traditionally served cold but you can ask for it hot - it came lukewarm and undercooked with no seasoning at all.   I bumped them up a star because after the whole fiasco the server treated us nicely and except for the salmon salad the food was good."
Dani B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",800,204,261,1.0,4/20/2014,"I've finally had it with this restaurant. I live not far and take my daughter here several times per month. I place 3 to 5 takeout orders per month; long before they had curbside delivery. Here are the pros: Standard big cheesecake menu.  Here are the cons: Bathrooms almost always a mess (intolerably so) Hostesses are frequently rude Bartenders don't know ""how"" to make common drinks Food often comes out cold Hi-chairs can take an extra 10 minutes to get upon request after being seated But here is the biggest issue. Takeout. Whether curbside or at the bakery, it's a disaster.  1. When you call be prepared to hold. Tonight was a 15 minute hold. 2. Be prepared to wait - a long time - when you get there ... Well after the estimated time 3. The order is often wrong. This restaurant needs some serious quality control. Tonight was the proverbial straw! My friend called in ahead. Waited 15 mins for the call to be taken. Placed the order. Waited 30 mins in valet (curbside area) for the order. Didnt check (his fault - I always remind him) if it was right ..got to our spot to eat and ... Not even close to the order. In fact given dietary restrictions not edible. 4. Called restaurant 5. Wasn't offered a refund but instead ""free potstickers"". Hello????  I've had it with this place. After coming here years I am committed to never coming back. The few times I've brought issues to managements attention nothing happens. On the visit before last, I watched the manager yelling at a party of 6 about their reservation. Isn't this backwards? I've been to dozens of cheesecake factories. This is up there with the worst .. Most poorly run. Tip.. If you are doing curbside always double check your order. About 75 percent of the time (a sample of over 100 orders) there is something incorrect. By the time you get home it's a hassle to fix it."
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",154,46,,4.0,8/12/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a fantastic chain which offers nearly unlimited options of food and drinks. Although the primary type of food is more American style they also have a variety of options from different spectrums.  Since the menu is over 20 pages long here are a few items which are great (from appetizers to desserts): Thai Lettuce Wraps, Factory Nachos, Factory Chopped Salad, Baja Chicken Tacos, Fish and Chips, Four Cheese Pasta, Steak Diane, Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. This location is decent but gets fairly cramped. Some of the tables are very close together, so unless you're a big party you may want to hope for a booth table. If it's busy there is also a bar area that may be easier to sit at, since they serve a full menu there as well. Service here is usually great and I have never had problems with it at this location."
Fritzie C.,"National City, CA",0,13,1,4.0,3/2/2014,"My boyfriend took me here on Friday the 28th and it was my first time going to any Cheesecake Factory and I loved it! The service was great, our server, Allyssa was attentive and super friendly.  I had the Chicken Katsu, yummy, and I think my boyfriend got a meal with a mix of mashed potatoes,  steak, and chicken and he loved it. The meal portions were huge so make sure you've got an empty stomach when you come! I had the hot chocolate drink and it was delicious, Allyssa had suggested if I wanted it to be any sweeter we could do that but I like chocolate was as sweet as it is. And it was good, not too sweet, and not too bland. Perfect for me and the weather at the time. Ill definitely come back to any Cheesecake Factory but going to this one for my first time left a good impression."
Shannon M.,"Irvine, CA",16,10,5,4.0,1/26/2015,"A wonderful to come with your family for dinner! Large menu to chose from, large portions, and everything tastes amazing! The only thing we didn't like is the long wait... Last time we were there it was a 30 min wait"
Allison R.,"Dana Point, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/28/2015,"I have eaten at many locations but this experience was not good at all. The wait was quoted at 45 minutes but it took 1 hr and 15 minutes. This wasn't even what prompted me to write this review. I had the chicken maderias avid strake didn't combo(Med well).2hrs after we left my stomach started  hurting. After staying up all night sick, being  sick from it all day and not being able to eat all day the next day, I decided to call and tell a manager. Calling there and telling her this info was even more frustrating after being sick and me personally spending $150 on my parties dinner last night. She said they take this seriously and will look into it, niy then proceeded to say no one else had called complaining, and she started questioning me about what else I had eaten throughout the day, mentioning maybe I have the flu etc etc. I finally stopped her and said look; I don't get sick and I don't have the flu. It was only a little bit of time after I ate there and I know it was that dinner. You would think she would have been more sympathetic and accountable and just say sorry but no. She was very off putting,  accusational towards me...thanks a lot Cheesecake Factory. You really know how to treat your long time customers."
Can C.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,2.0,2/28/2015,"Delicious tastes terrible service. Beg for the parmesan, salad dressing and bread. 35 minutes for salmon. However the manager tries to do his best. But the Lady who serves us was total disaster. They need name tags."
Jenelle G.,"Napa Valley, CA",172,137,78,5.0,4/23/2013,Hibachi steak can't go wrong!
