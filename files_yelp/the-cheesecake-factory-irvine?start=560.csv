Vincent M.,"Dana Point, CA",23,57,4,3.0,10/20/2013,"Big portions, good food, huge menu.....great Cheesecake... Went this weekend.....we actually split the lunch special of a Pizza and a salad and still enough food........Server Jennifer excellent...warm bread....... Next visit...bad service, wrong food... So a bit inconsistent.......consistency is what we look for in a restaurant... CCF is not that..."
Sara P.,"Irvine, CA",243,577,248,3.0,4/19/2011,"Stopped in for a quick drink before a movie. There was plenty of seating but do to the shift change, they were waiting 15-20 mins to seat anyone. We opted to sit in the bar area since we only had about 30 mins before the movie started. Still the service was slow. :(  We both got a Strawberry Martini and it was perfect! Wish I could have relaxed and enjoyed it a little more! This particular drink is not part of the happy hour specials though, so be ready to fork over $11.50 a glass."
Tyler K.,"Irvine, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2014,"Normally , I do not give any restaurant bad review . However , I received a really horrible treat on last Sunday ( 4/27/14) with the host there .(This host had a glass on)   I came around 8 pm and signed in with party for 2 . The host seated the similar parties that came & signed in after I am . After, she seated several more parties....I noticed that those parties are all white people  . I complained to her but still she seated another parties until no more. (She even did not said sorry ) . Therefore I got mad & walked out the door . I think this is discrimination since I am Asian .  I walked to Paul Martin , they provided great service & excellent food !"
Jerry M.,"Hemet, CA",0,7,,2.0,4/19/2014,"Food quality and service have rapidly gone downhill. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants and I'm not sure what happened. On my last visit there was a 45 min wait for food AFTER being seated, the waiter had no experience and when the salad was served the lettuce was wilted."
John N.,"Austin, TX",349,486,182,4.0,3/27/2013,"If you go to one Cheesecake Factory, you have been to all of them.  Keep in mind though that experiences DO vary from location to location, particularly in the service or seating department. The food, of course, is like all the other Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Very flavorable, large, and unhealthy portions, with the exception of the skinny menu.  The bigger difference with this location is the seating.  At this location you have your outdoor seating semi overlooking the valet parking area out towards another restaurant.  For larger parties, there is seating towards the inside of the restaurant near the restrooms.  Thank goodness.  Service from what I can remember was friendly, which I'm surprised how many different Cheesecake Factory restaurants keep up.  Very impressive. Overall, not bad for those looking for something large and with variety.  Unless you are on a diet, you cannot go wrong with Cheesecake Factory."
Discerning T.,"Newport Beach, CA",3,65,,3.0,12/11/2014,"My family frequents CheesecakeFactory on a weekly basis........we go so often because it has a big menu and the food is consistent.   Although tonight was a different story......I was sick and my husband picked up salads and fettucini Alfredo and brought it home.  The fettucini Alfredo had so much pepper and nutmeg, we could not eat it!  My salad was good but my husband Thai Crunch Salad had absolutely NO chicken! The food needs to be consistent in and out of the restaurant.  When he called to advise the manager about the salad and fettucini, he graciously refunded our credit card. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for doing the right thing!"
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,4.0,9/20/2010,"I came here for HH on Friday and got here around 5:30pm unfortunately there was not a seat or booth open in the bar so we decided to eat in the dinning area.  I Ordered the almost everything salad and the wild mushroom burger.  The salad consist of chopped Romaine, marinated artichokes, salami, shrimp, tomato, green beans, olives, garbanzo beans, roasted red peppers and blue cheese tossed with vinaigrette. The combination of all the ingredients were delicious and light.  The wild mushroom burger was very juicy and tender but the fries were disappointing - lack of flavor and they tasted like they were from a fast food chain.  The server was friendly and polite. The food selection is huge at the Cheesecake Factory and is consistent on quality and flavor for a large chain restaurant chain."
Adria L.,"Tustin, CA",88,200,89,4.0,5/20/2013,"this one is my 2nd favorite (like hb location better) as, the wait is sometimes lengthy for food but the entrees never disappoint and staff is very nice clean restrooms as well...little pricey but the portions make up for it"
Veronica V.,"Garden Grove, CA",350,81,24,4.0,6/21/2011,"The food is delicious.. and you have to try the cheesecake.  Their food is absolutely wonderful, and there is a wide variety in options. I love their pasta dishes and pizza. Make sure to try your favorite type of cheesecake. The best ones I have tried are the red velvet and tiramasu ones. They are so yummy! This location can get busy, so try to call ahead or know that you may need to wait a few minutes before being seated. Their drinks are strong and tasty as well."
Nadine F.,"Orange, CA",92,133,2,5.0,5/5/2013,"I come here solely for the happy hour.  I have no problem leaving work early to meet my friends here for drinks and appetizers.  I have tried almost everything on the happy hour menu.  The Vietnamese spring rolls are fabulous.  I love the tamale cakes. I'm pretty simple when it comes to drinks.  I enjoy just a plain vodka soda, but the bartenders are great about making sure I have a new one ready when I'm running low on the previous. Whenever anyone asks me about a good happy hour place in Irvine, this is ALWAYS my go to!"
Maria D.,"Anaheim, CA",1,14,,2.0,12/27/2014,"Careful with the check in area. When we checked in they forgot they gave us a pager. When it paged the girl gave us the weirdest look when we gave it to her. Told us to wait at the 2nd waiting area. They forgot about us again for 30 min. Went up to the check in area and asked what's up, same girl said we should wait. Then we saw her get chewed out by her boss and was told to go to the back, she said no and stayed put. Waited more. Finally went to the check in again asked if we were on a list or something to another girl and was seated, original girl was still ignoring us and other customers. Food is always good but the customer service is now lacking. If you want to throw a tantrum at work please do not take it out on customers. You are a hostess for a reason, not a ""be mean and ignore people and make them wait forever."""
Jerome D.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,20,6,2.0,8/25/2013,"Maybe I'm too dense, but I don't understand the fascination with Cheesecake Factory. Yes, they have a ton of items on their menu, which generally means one thing (no, not which to choose) -- they all pretty much suck.  We met a friend here on a Sunday afternoon, it was busy, but not ridiculous. We waited a few minutes to be seated, and when they took us back the table was still dirty from the previous diners. They apologized and we waited a few more minutes while they cleared the table. That was not really a problem for me. What was the problem was the floor near our table was so greasy my shoes slipped around as I walked. I ordered a tostada salad that was mostly lettuce and rather bland while my wife had a Chinese chicken salad. Both are pretty standard fare. Nothing particularly good or bad.  The server was fine. She checked in on us and kept the glasses full.  We decided to use the restrooms before we left, which was a mistake. They were pretty gross. Paper everywhere, trash cans overflowing--a general uncleanliness.  I guess my biggest gripe is that this place just didn't seem clean. And if it's not clean in the places where customers CAN see, I would hate to imagine what goes on where we can't see.  We won't be coming back."
Hanna P.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",185,188,1214,4.0,4/25/2013,"Came for Sunday brunch and found the perfect healthy dish for the carb conscious.  The Energy platter is egg whites with chicken breast,  spinach,  mushrooms and tomatoes. Pretty good. Service was great and Sunday brunch is pretty empty so no wait."
Helena S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,100,28,4.0,1/22/2015,"This one is good, but I like the other ones I have been to better. The food was good, but it wasn't as good as the food from other Cheesecake Factories. I would still reccomend it though."
Jason L.,"Irvine, CA",1323,421,241,3.0,5/18/2010,"MMMm Cheesecake Factory. My first experience was in SF on the 7th floor of Macy's. It was a super fancy restaurant to me. Plus I had a $100 gift card so it was fun trying to use it up with a few friends. However... Cheesecake Factory is like a BMW (which I'm not a fan of). A lot of people hear the name and think WOW Cheesecake Factory. Just like a BMW, a lot of people are more in love with name than with the car. Sometimes a brand name does not mean its better. There is a great varied of food here with large portions. I've tried everything from Jambalaya, pizza, pasta, steak, burgers, and other fine entrees. Every item was delicious a bit pricey, but given the quality and size makes it worth it. The Irvine location always has a long wait, but is a great place to lounge with friends or celebrate a birthday. One problem... you CAN have too much of a good thing. There are lot of fruity cocktail drinks and great meals, but after a while its all the same thing without any change to the menu. I forgot! They actually have Cheesecake!! Not a big fan of cheesecake, but most of the time after consuming some 5,000 calorie it is hard to have room left for cheesecake. Its a great idea to share with a friend or many friends. Overall rating about 3 to 3.5 ish stars. If you asked me about 5 or more years ago, Cheesecake factory would have about 4 or 5 stars, but not anymore. Now living in south OC, there are more Cheesecake Factories than McDonald's in this area. Yes, I dare you to check. CF was once a fancy restaurant that you go to, but now its as common as Denny's. In underdeveloped areas shopping malls are considered ""fancy"" because they have CF or PF Chang's. I am a bit sad that there are too many chain restaurants. Where's the home style cooking?"
G F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,,4.0,11/19/2014,"Great ambience!  Went with a friend and had an overall enjoyable experience.  If you are lucky and get a young lady server by the name of Cherish, then you are in for a treat.  She was efficient, attentive, engaging, and pleasant.  The restaurant was bustling but we were seated immediately.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala.  It was great and the portion was huge.  Outside the restaurant, they have the Christmas decor up already, which made the whole evening more festive.  The Cheesecake Factory and the Grove made for a great night out.  Try it for yourself."
Brandon C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",6,57,34,5.0,8/1/2013,"Devon, our server, was friendly and attentive. Cheesecake and fresh brewed coffee delicious."
Negin I.,"Mission Viejo, CA",55,49,15,1.0,5/29/2014,"love their food but service is ZERO ..... i prefer to go to mission viejo one more ,"
Laina A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",483,696,935,4.0,4/12/2012,"As my fellow yelpers Rohlin A., Al S. and Randoll C. say I've always had very good experiences at Cheesecake Factory, so lucky me! This is a popular place so there can be a wait.  I recommend going in a half an hour early and put your name in, then you can cruise the Spectrum and get extra hungry.  You're going to need to be.  The Cheesecake Factory has a huge menu and the portions are huge.  There is a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and just perusing the menu can take some time.  I love the chicken littles and the bbq ranch chicken salad and the navajo (a chicken sandwich).   Once you're order is taken, your drinks arrive, along with a bread basket with real butter.  The breads are sourdough and a type of squaw.  Both are always warm and tasty and you can always get more.  I do wish the butter wasn't so hard, but here is a tip:  it's in wrapped pats and you gently squeeze the sides and the warmth of your hands translates to the butter and it softens, so you are able to open it and spread on your warm bread. Sunday brunch, how about lemon ricotta pancakes or sunrise fiesta burrito? The appetizers, small plates and snacks are pages and you can order 3 or 4 of those and split it all and get to taste test a lot of different items.  I really like the buffalo blasts. Did I mention dessert?  Cheesecake galore.  Pretty much if you can dream it, it's there.  We split and tried the Hershey chocolate bar cheesecake and it was divine, although the chocolate infusion was on overload, so you really need to love chocolate!  Not a problem, I do!  25 cents of each slice of this cheesecake is donated to Feeding America, so you're doing good deeds too!  Does it get better than eating good and doing good?  Nope. Warning, you need to like leftovers!  The Cheesecake Factory has huge portions and taking home food is just part of the experience.  Certain items, think salad, really do not survive the transition well.  Luckily, you can get a cheaper lunch size portion of salads, and a few other items.  Did I mention that even the lunch size portion is big?  It is!  No salad in/on some small bowl/plate.  You will still have plenty to eat. I've found staff to usually be helpful and friendly and management wants to please.  Any time I've had an issue, it's been addressed and fixed.  I love the decor of Cheesecake Factory.  Brighter color swirls and modern fixtures.  I personally do not like the booths, as they backs are almost completely straight up, not the most comfy in my opinion, so I usually opt for a chair. Overall, I'm definitely a fan and this is one of the few chains that I really like a lot."
Hannah K.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",148,85,21,4.0,2/25/2013,"Tonight was my first experience at this particular Cheesecake Factory. The one in the Mission Viejo mall is never really that good (I'm not usually a big fan of these huge corperate chain restaurants). I've been served rock hard avocado on a salad before at the Mission Viejo location and the service typically just ok. I have to say I was WAY more satisfied with this location in the spectrum. My friend and I got a big booth right away which was nice. I LOVED our waiter, I wish I asked his name so I could give him props! This guy was on top of everything, drinks refills, and checking up on us often (not to the point where it was annoying though).  I got a little worried when our appetizer wasnt very hot but it wasnt undercooked or anything so we didnt really worry about. We ordered a  chinese chicken salad next and we decided to share it. Good thing we decided to share, this thing was HUGE! Even with the 2 of us eating the salad we still couldnt finish it. It was a tasty salad and not too over dressed or anything. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with my experience here and would return :)"
