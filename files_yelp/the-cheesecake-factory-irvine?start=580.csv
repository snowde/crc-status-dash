Henry F.,"Irvine, CA",107,73,18,4.0,10/10/2014,"I have been to this location several times and I usually get the Hibachi Steak. It always tastes amazing, but the side of mashed potatoes can use some work. Other than that, this is a great place to bring your friends and family for that Sunday Lunch."
Ed P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",193,17,1,4.0,10/28/2012,"This is a great location, open late, and food is fresh. Oddly, the floors are super-greasy so be careful not to slip and fall. The skinnylicious menu is great and the burger with a salad is my fav. Beer is fresh; don't fill up on the bread and butter-- unless you're on a budget ;-)"
Dougie G.,"Newport Beach, CA",30,63,15,4.0,4/8/2013,"Always good and super dependable! you can't really go wrong by eating here. Well trained staff and good recipes and delivery of the Goods. basically love most of the menu.  Yeah I said it, cuz its true said DougieFresh"
Ghazal K.,"Temecula, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/28/2014,"Disgusting, plz don't come here , expensive, bad services, bad food , almost zero quality , believe me,"
Shahla I.,"Irvine, CA",0,4,,4.0,12/26/2014,"Foods were perfectly ok , I recommend try Salmons which is well backed and mashed potato was great too , cheesecakes are so big so if you want to order one consider it first of all before you get full ;)"
Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1251,506,242,5.0,2/14/2012,"Five Stars? For what...? Well, I guess I've always dodged ""bad experience bullets"" when stopping at Cheesecake Factory restaurants. I've visited a large number across the Western US, and frankly, have never had anything less than good service and good food. And that would be the worst that has happened. Usually whatever I order is just plain ""really good."" I'm rarely if ever disappointed. If there were an award for consistency in customer service, and dependable quality across the menu, then this restaurant group deserves my 5-stars. I can't think of another chain doing as good a job.  I took my wife and two of our grand-girls to the Spectrum CF for an early Valentine's Day dinner. As usual, the visit included great customer service, from the hostesses to the wait staff. And tonight, Ryan, our server, was at the top of his CF customer-service-game. We were never without bread and drink refills, and the guy was just one of the nicest servers we've had while at any restaurant. It seems I've lucked out, because this is pretty much what I get at every location I visit.  When my wife and I travel together, and we want a late lunch or dinner with no surprises, we'll look for a Cheesecake Factory location. I've found every location amazingly consistent in both service level and food prep and quality. And as for the Spectrum location... it's one of our reliable favorites. The only ""OK"" visit I can remember was at the Tyler Mall, Riverside store, and then it was a worn out server that I remember, not a food issue. And even then I remember her covering all the bases, but obviously at the end of her shift, tired and distracted. She didn't take it out on us, she just didn't have the spunkiness we're used to. So if that's the worst I can remember, I'd say that's a good thing. While I can understand and empathize with anyone who's had a bad experience at a CF location, including this one, I tend to think it's an anomoly. It just doesn't happen that often, and when it does, I'll bet a call to the location's manager will produce both a sincere apology and a complimentary dinner, or at minimum, fair compensation for whatever may have happened.  Our corporation has sold to some of the chain and franchise food groups here in the US, and in my ""black book and private list"" of best operations..... CKE (Carl's Jr. and Hardy's), and Cheesecake Factory are at the top of my list. My recommendation for a ""Table for Two?"" Try ordering the Chicken Madera and the full size Santa Fe Salad. Ask for two extra plates, and split both items. It makes for a great ""salad-entree"" combo, and I assure you, there will be more than enough food. The chicken is served with two chicken breast filets and plenty of mashed potatoes. And the salad? Well, it's probably enough for three to four guests!"
Shelly O.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,29,,1.0,5/19/2015,"I went here last night with my friend and both of us ended up with food poisoning today. I have called here and was told a manager would call back. But guess what no one has called. Not only have i spent the entire day in bed, but i have also made a trip to the emergency room and had to take the day of work. I am disgusted with the aftermath of this entire situation and i will be sharing my experience with all my friends who are mommy bloggers!!!!"
Elaine H.,"Irvine, CA",137,237,15,4.0,10/26/2012,Oh cheesecake factory.  A pretty good price to food quality & quantity ratio type of place. Not too formal. Not too casual. Balanced perfectly right in between. Never been? Try their jambalaya pasta if you want something of strong flavors and a nice little kick to it :o) Yummy!
Lidia K.,"Silverado, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/17/2015,Our family ate here and 5 out of 7 of us got food poisoning. Management is denying it but we were sick as dogs!
Felesia D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",36,32,30,4.0,1/12/2014,"The food was very good, it was fresh! The waiter was great to start with but he could have checked on us more."
L W.,"Lake Forest, CA",160,136,185,3.0,4/8/2012,"This evening, a group of friends and I sat at a table bar-side and had the worst service ever. The bread was great, as usual - but that's where the pleasantries ended.  We waited a solid 25 minutes before we even got our menus. There was nobody checking up on the tables on this side of the restaurant, apparently.  Before we ordered, we instructed the waiter that we wanted separate checks for every party member. Of course, when the check came at the very end (after waiting 30 minutes for him to come, no less) it was NOT separated as we had asked. Big oversights and mismanagement bar-side were really disappointing, especially after the great experience we had two weeks ago with Patrick (in the regular dining section)."
Michael K.,"Portland, OR",11,105,10,4.0,8/9/2014,"I agree with the gentlemen before me, all of the cheesecake factories are the same, but i have my favorite locations. My first time at this location, love the spectrum, i used to come here all the time when i lived in OC. I really love the jambalaya meals, shrimp tacos, my girlfriends favorite menu, we had fun at this location, waitresses arent that attentive, a bit stuck into their shells, but it didnt spoil our good time. Not sure when i will be in the area again, it will be on my next vacation on the way to San Diego."
Dean B.,"West Hollywood, CA",4,33,21,5.0,12/14/2014,Ordered the Steak Diane and Crusted Salmon combo with steamed veggies!  Great food and service!
Ryan D.,"Fountain Valley, CA",205,94,10,4.0,2/27/2013,"Very nice cheesecake factory. Came here on a monday night around 7 and there was no wait. We were quickly seated and given a basket of their bread. My gf loves he brown wheat bread, while I like their regular french bread.  Our waitress was Megan and he was very friendly. We ordered the Avocado Eggrolls as our appetizer. I got the Mushroom Burger and my gf got the Garlic Noodles. Avocado Eggrolls 3 large avocado stuffed egg rolls, cut in half and served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. These were very good. I usually do not care much for avocados, but these were very refreshing. Pretty filling though. After were split these and had some bread, we weren't that hungry anymore. Mushroom Burger Nice huge burger with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms. I enjoyed the nice toasted bun and the meat was nicely cooked. The onions were very sweet and the swiss cheese was very nice. The mushrooms were a little thick for me and had a little too much mushroomy flavor that I personally do not like that much. Overall a nice burger for mushroom lovers. Garlic Noodles My gf always gets these noodles as they are her favorite. It is a simple clean noodle with a light sauce. The actually didnt finish much of it this time as we were stuffed from the eggrolls. I am very happy with their service. We asked to get the garlic noodles boxed up while we paid the bill and by the time we paid and were ready to go, we forgot we had the noodles boxed up. We left for about 10 minutes by the time we realized we forgot the noodles. Basically the entire dish was left and we paid for it, so we were hoping they didnt throw it away. We called in and they said the usually throw it away, but Megan saved it for us and it was in the bakery fridge. I give Megan a thumbs up! (She was also wearing a Dr. Seuss tie)"
Melica K.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",1,2,1,2.0,6/24/2016,"the service was awful, everyone seemed to be in grumpy mood and had an unacceptable attitude, was really disappointed. our waitress kept rolling her eyes at us as well."
Donna J.,"Westminster, CA",1,14,12,4.0,10/30/2014,I really like there entree Pasta DaVinci.  Penne pasta with mushrooms and chicken.  The best part of the pasta of course the madiera sauce.  I always get there Tiramisu cheesecake.  This time I tried there 30th anniversary cheesecake.  Both of the cheesecakes were good.
Chris F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",8,85,7,4.0,9/7/2014,"Love this restaurant. Overall they have the best menu selection. You think the quality would suffer with such a large menu, but it doesn't. From the delicious Kobe burger to the fantastic orange chicken... So good!! Not to mention the best cheesecake you can imagine."
Sheila K.,"Emeryville, CA",261,598,51,4.0,10/31/2010,"Came here today and i just love it when there is no wait.  Of course when you dine during sr. hour that definitely helps.  came here for an earlier dinner and had the bbq salmon on their special menu.  It was pretty good and tasty.  Love the portions.  My boyfriend got the caramel chicken and that also was pretty tasty. It's got an asian twist so its full of flavor.  We opted to get desert.  The tiramisu cheesecake, a safe choice.  I am still sad that they took off the tres leches cheesecake from their menu.   Overall, the service was great and I can always expect a good meal when I come here."
Eddie C.,"Davidson, NC",86,124,,4.0,7/2/2014,"Avocado Eggrolls, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Crusted Chicken Romano are some of my favorites. We went on a Sunday around 1:00 PM and didn't have to wait, excellent service as well!"
Mickelle G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",5,20,22,1.0,8/5/2015,Got a cup of cold water dropped on my table and all over me by my waiter; and no one seemed to care not even the manger!!!  Went out for what should have been a nice meal with the family; and I ended up cold outside at a table not hunger...
