Rachel T.,"Irvine, CA",67,969,239,3.0,2/20/2017,"Came here on my birthday (02.19.17) and it was our first time at this location, it feels like eons since I've actually been to the Spectrum everything seemed brand new to me! One thing I hate is the parking situation! I would hate to be around here during busy peak times! Even though I came on a Sunday we came late around 9PM so it was a breeze but still! My sister had to drop me and mom off at the curb to cross the street to get to the restaurant while she was circling for parking since we only saw Valet across from the restaurant we had KL with us and had to self park. By the time our name was called my sister walked in right on time, the wait was no more than 10 minutes which was excellent! We even got a booth instead of those half table/booth those are the worst! Our waitress came around to us in a timely manner, we didn't feel like she didn't know we were there which is a pet peeve of us when we go out! Even though she still had a good amount of tables she always checked on us and was attentive!  We mainly ordered appetizers so we could share without ordering a ton of food. We ordered: -Crispy crab bites -Chicken Potstickers -Sliders with fries -Custom pizza I loved our appetizers minus the seafood one (I didn't try it since I don't like seafood) my mom did note that our Potstickers could have been hotter which I agree, they were lukewarm :/ My sliders came on these perfectly buttered buns! The presentation was so cute! I filled up on bread and potstickers so I took the other half home. I haven't tried my sisters pizza yet but she said the pizza was lame :/ Hardly no sauce and was lacking that ""ooey gooey"" pizza feel. She gave her leftovers to me and I'm sure I can spruce it up a bit with more sauce!  They brought me out a free Sundae and sang HBD to me which was nice! Overall the whole dining experience was great! I can't even imagine what it's like during rush hour time since there was still a good amount of people around the time we were there! I'm content, but if I was really craving Cheesecake Factory again I'd probably just go to the Bella Terra location since it's much easier to navigate! ^___^"
George H.,"Riverside, CA",115,5,2,1.0,11/26/2017,The food was alright but the service was horrible. The waiter took over 30 minutes to even take our order and the food took around an hour and a half.
Kelley L.,"Long Beach, CA",24,430,463,5.0,1/14/2017,"This is one of the nicest Cheesecake Factories I have had the chance to eat at! I love the outdoor patio space! It is definitely not as loud outside, and it is quite cosy with the heating lamps and plethora of space. I was glad it was not too crowded on a Friday afternoon. The hostess seated my mum and me immediately after we walked in. I ordered the hibachi steak, which is amazing, per usual. My server was excellent, and the rest of the staff were just as awesome! No complaints here! Food came out within a good time range, too. Definitely will be back here again."
Gary F.,"San Diego, CA",8,7,,5.0,10/29/2017,"It was a last minute decision to check out The Cheesecake Factory, as I wasn't sure I had ever been to one. We ordered a round of drinks and basically a stream of appetizers.  Pamela, our server was a joy.  She sensed that we were indecisive and sort of random, yet she managed to breeze in and out at just the right times. She was also very professional and made us feel comfortable. The apps, especially the Korean BBQ cauliflower and the beef sliders were above expectations. We sat on the patio as the sun was setting. A chilly breeze began to blow and it was clear that this something for which management was prepared. The heat lamps came on gently and at exactly the right time.  The icing on the cake was the friendly wave accompanying the ""thank you, have a great night"" we received from a manager or staff member as we departed. Score one for The Cheesecake Factory."
Angela C.,"Orange County, CA",227,1627,693,1.0,7/9/2017,"We got seated, and nobody ever came back to acknowledge us or take even a drink order. They took so long that my husband actually started timing them with his phone to see how long it would take a server to come over to our table. We'll never know because we ended up walking out without ever being served. I did see plenty of servers and hostesses just standing around and chit chatting though.  I guess their priority is not their customers."
Samira J.,"Irvine, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/17/2017,Had dinner there Sunday night ... food was great and staff was nice ... However bathroom was filthy ... napkins overflowing from the waste basket and floor wet and no toilet paper.. Told the restaurant manager and found it in same condition when I went back 30 minutes later ... And they always say you can tell cleanness of a restaurant kitchen by their bathrooms ...
Ted S.,"Lake Forest, CA",199,448,970,4.0,7/11/2016,"I'm not a fan of chains like this, but I have to admit that they have great service, consistently good food, and fair prices. I can't seem to find anyone who hates it here. This review will focus only on their happy hour, which is Monday thru Friday from 4-6. We arrived at 5:30, expecting it to be packed on a Thursday afternoon, but found the bar area relatively empty, with only a few tables taken. Our server was there in seconds, offering water, and took our drink orders.  We ordered their specialty martini drinks on the happy hour menu for $5.50. They were delicious, and large. Before the drinks even arrived, she brought out a bread basket with butter, and it was warm and very tasty.  We placed our order for food, and chose the happy hour burger, the Vietnamese spring rolls, and the fried mix of avocado, zucchini, and mushroom.  The food arrived at our table surprisingly fast, about 5-7 minutes. Burger: Two patties, two slices of cheese, and a big brioche bun. A tasty burger for five bucks. Not the best, but top notch for a happy hour item. Fried stuff: Loved the dipping sauces, the mushrooms, and the zucchini, but wasn't into the fried avocado. Just weird on flavor and texture.  Spring rolls: I loved these, and the two dipping sauces. One was oily and spicy, the other peanut based. Both were good. I will order these for sure next time. Service: Fast, efficient, and friendly. At 5:50 our server came by again to check on us, and to inform us that happy hour would be ending soon, but that she would be back to tell us when last call for happy hour was. When she did, a few minutes later, we ordered another round of drinks, which arrived about two minutes later.  For two people, we ate half the burger, half the fried stuff, and all of the spring rolls. It was just too much food, at an unbeatable price for the fare."
Scherry B.,"Hemet, CA",20,259,40,4.0,7/31/2017,Best BBQ chicken salad !  Menu is too big and this place is very expensive but the food is good.  Plan on waiting for a table.  Service is a hit or miss. Not consistent. Cheesecake is good but the chocolate cakes are amazing !
Nan S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",9,15,19,5.0,9/10/2017,"Excellent place, I ordered grilled Steak Medallion, and delicious plate, it's very cool place. Not expensive. And many desserts. I'm crazy !!"
Tootie Y.,"Irvine, CA",62,38,124,3.0,11/7/2017,Too much menu!  Too much noise and nothing to absorb the sound.  It takes a good 15 minutes just to read the menu!  I haven't really found anything that I found really tasty.  But I come back at least once a year to try it again.
Judy T.,"San Marino, CA",326,362,1170,3.0,6/30/2016,"Came here strictly for happy hour and it was alright.. Service was great. Our server was fairly attentive and friendly. I got the pink lemonade cocktail for around 5.50 and it wasn't very good. To me, it tasted too sweet. There was also a sugar rim on the glass. For food, I got to taste the fried cheese which was pretty good. Just friend mozzarella in a wedge shape instead of a stick. Kale salad: okay..tastes like the salad I used to buy in ready packs from Costco. It was fresh and had a mild taste with a few golden raspberries Tamale cakes: this is good! I used to get this whenever I came to Cheesecake Factory for dinner as an appetizer. It's amazing that it is on the happy hour menu. The size is the same and delicious. The soft tamale cakes mixed with sour cream and salsa tastes just right.  The price can add up but it's a good price for around 5 to 6 per item."
Andrew M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,17,2,1.0,6/28/2017,"Not going to lie worker at the to-go cheesecake bakery bar really hates her life. She was completely rude and didn't want anything to do with taking our order and preparing it. I wish I got her name but I didn't. She was making snark remarks and was not helpful whatsoever. Plus when I asked for an extra side of whip cream she turns her head, gets me a side of whip cream, and throws it on the counter almost to have it slide off. She didn't say a word , just threw it.  Seriously rude."
Carlene P.,"Lake Forest, CA",39,238,187,4.0,8/16/2016,"Dessert only review: Stopped in for dessert after Taco Tuesday dinner over at Urban Seoul. If you're into carrot cake, as i am, then Crazy Craig's Carrot Cake Cheesecake is the way to go. It's perfection. Crunchy walnuts, bits of carrot cake, creamy cheesecake with a sweet cream cheese dollop on top and a delicate and tasty crust.  My dining partner chose Chris's something or other which had chocolate chip cookie dough and I'm not sure just what else, but I found it to be just too sweet.  Service was pretty good. Prices are steep with the cheesecake slices coming in at just under 8 bucks each and a cup of decaf will cost you $3.50, so dessert for two will set you back about 25 bucks, plus tip."
Amanda Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",409,257,449,4.0,12/19/2016,"Had dinner here with a friend, as we were both hadn't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while. We both weren't especially craving anything special, and Cheesecake Factory is good for that because they have such a varied and extensive menu. They've got pastas, pizza, burgers, salads, burritos, omelettes, a bunch of appetizers, and of course, cheesecake. We ended up ordering calamari for our appetizer. Nice and crispy and perfectly seasoned. I ordered a veggie burger with fries. The veggie burger here is made of rice, quinoa, beans, and more. My friend ordered the classic burger with a side of salad. Cheesecake Factory always gives large portions, as as usual we were so full we had to pack half our meal for later. And no room for dessert. Haha. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive and checked up on us a few times. Water was always refilled. This is a good place for both large and small groups, as I'm sure everyone will find something they'd enjoy."
Food Finder G.,"Irvine, CA",4,69,7,5.0,8/12/2017,"I've been here before like 7 years ago and was not impressed so never went back . This time around, it was my son's birthday and he wanted to come here . We came early at 5 pm and sat at the bar and ordered dinner and happy hour appetizers. The food was all good.  But our table at the bar was too small to hold all our items so it was a little overwhelming. The service was good . We had 2 waitresses and they were very attentitive.  *The pasta Napoletana was really good  *Crab and artichoke dip was really good *Avocado spring rolls ok if you want that much avocado inside . A little overwhelming for me.  *2 item combo of steak Diane and salmon . Was ok . Steak was really good  *Louisiana chicken pasta was good * fried macaroni and cheese was good as I was told my the kids . I don't eat that  *the kids spaghetti and meat ball was good and the portion was big for kids meal * fried calamari was classic but one of the white sauce , garlic ranch I'm assuming was the bomb!  * deserts : creme brûlée cheesecake and white chocolate carmel cheesecake  Will go back to happy hour again ."
Tara L.,"Seattle, WA",212,344,708,5.0,12/12/2016,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory and have no idea why people rate it poorly! I have been coming to this location for at least 10 years now and I have never had a bad experience with the food or customer service. My personal favorite pasta that I would recommend is their 'pasta da vinci'. It is a penne pasta served with mushrooms, caramelized onions, chicken, and a madeira wine sauce that is heavenly. I always like to ask for extra sauce on the side. This most recent visit, I decided to also try out a healthy option. I ordered their kale salad which was the best kale salad I've ever had. It came with lemon vinaigrette, grapes, and bell pepper...I added a side of avocado as well. If you're ever hesitant to try this place, you definitely shouldn't be. I've had tons of their entrees, appetizers, and desserts, and I have enjoyed all of them!"
Jinnie N.,"Orange County, CA",76,245,888,4.0,12/30/2016,"Impressed with the Happy Hour menu and it's value!!! I have been recently scouring the OC on a hunt for FABULOUS Happy Hour eats and I am glad to have re-discovered this place. Honestly, I was ""done"" with The Cheesecake Factory years ago because I was tired of the ""chain""/pre-prepped food for $$. Orange County is brimming with fresh non-cookie cutter eats for about the same price, so I stopped eating here.  However, the other night my friend INSISTED that we go to TCF with a bunch of girlfriends for Happy Hour. We went straight to the bar and we were able to get 2 tables INSTANTLY!!! This was one of the tedious things that I hated about TCF. In the past, I have waited 1-2 hours to eat at this chain. The bar was too easy!! They even allow kids, which I don't think was the case years ago.  Margaritas and other cocktails for $5!!!! I was also sweetly surprised that the margaritas were really yummy and not watered down to cater to the HH crowds. They rivaled Javier's across the way...who does NOT have a HH menu...Ahem!!! The eats were also really good for the INCREDIBLE prices!!! They were all about $5. We got loaded nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes, southern fried chicken sliders, fried calamari, parmesan garlic cheese bread, edamame, & kale salad...had to throw some greens in there!! EVERYthing was full-sized & freshly prepared...for a chain. We left there happy & content...especially for only spending about $20 each (including tip!!!!!).  The AMBIENCE in the bar was spacious & the noise level was good. All of us could carry a conversation with one another without screaming or yelling over one another. Another PLUS is that the bar area is near a window...which I love. One wall is all glass so you can ""people watch"" the folks walking around The Spectrum, which is something I enjoy!!! Will definitely have to come here again and try some other stuff!!!"
Ema V.,"Fullerton, CA",43,124,72,1.0,5/26/2017,"Came here for lunch in between wedding dress shopping. We sat outside on the patio. Emma was our server. I don't recommend coming to this restaurant at all. Has nothing to do with the cheesecake brand but more so the service. 3 of us order side salads with our meals and our salads came out with our meals. One of my pet peeves when going out to eat. Basically you are telling me that I have to eat my salad and my meal all at the same time now? Not to mention my food will be cold after I finish eating my salad. In the middle of our meal, my friend starting freaking out. I assumed she got a horrible text or phone call but when I looked at what she was pointing to there was a cockroach in her salad. YES, I am not exaggerating nor am I making this up. This insect crawled out from bottom of her salad and was just laying on its back in the plate. When we told the server she immediately went and told her manager. What really put me off was when the manager came to our table, she apologized but then decided to say ""that did not come from inside our salad, it probably flew into your salad out here."" UGH NO LADY! This roach was covered in salad dressing and would not been if it ""flew"" into our salad and it crawled out from the bottom of the bed of lettuce. Instead of taking responsibility she blamed it on us for eating on the patio. Didn't get the managers name, but she was female, blonde short curly hair and eyelashes caked on with layers of mascara. I wouldn't recommend coming to this restaurant. There are many other to choose from if you are in the area."
Sami S.,"Irvine, CA",83,9,,2.0,11/8/2017,"I don't normally bother to write reviews but this has been bugging me a lot lately and hopefully the restaurant can make some changes. My mom and I love coming here for brunch & for their cheesecakes but honestly the service at this location is HORRIBLE :( everyone is friendly and there are plenty of workers but we constantly find ourselves waiting around for much much longer than is appropriate.. not only when we dine in, but when we call for to go orders as well (I've seen plenty of people walk out because they have been waiting so long). It's becoming completely unpleasant to come here which makes me sad because my mom and I enjoy eating the food together."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,10/30/2016,"Enormous menu, way too many options, you get bored with the menu, way too much reading and way too overwhelming. Service was rushed, they are way too busy to offer great service. Prices are a bit high for the quality that you get, don't expect great meats, best to stick to the basic dishes. You can tell the food is mass produced and while it is a bit better than some of your run of the mill chain restaurants, it's not a place I would chose to return to."
