Phillip L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,11,,5.0,9/17/2014,"Had a great birthday dinner.. Michael T.  was a polite and attentive server, kept the drinks flowing and was attentive to our every need.  Would visit again!"
Rachel B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,3,1.0,4/21/2015,"Waited a really long time expected.  Then our server missed placed our order, had it remade. That was nice, about an hour later didn't feel right from the grilled chicken. Two days later still unable to consume solids with out cramps, thank you cheesecake factory. Glad we left 22% tip out of feeling grateful for the remake of our food."
Barbra D.,"Santa Ana, CA",89,19,2,1.0,3/30/2014,"PEOPLE WITH SEAFOOD ALLERGIES BEWARE!!!!!! They fry everything in the same oil so if you are allergic to shellfish you can't eat anything fried! Very disappointing! I called a head to verify that they don't fry seafood with their avocado egg rolls and they told me they didn't but when I came in, they said they do fry everything together! Can you believe that? Unbelievable! I've been to about 20 Cheesecake Factories and they all fry everything in the same oil! And they don't tell you this unless you ask! I told them I was allergic to shrimp and they just said ok but they didn't say I couldn't eat anything fried! I had to ask if they fry it separately which they said YES so I asked them to make sure and that's when they said no I couldn't eat anything fried! Just unbelievable! Very disappointing!"
Angela I.,"Artesia, CA",0,8,6,1.0,4/20/2014,If you want good food it's a great place. But if you lookin for service for your money it's not the place to go. The waiter ruined every part of our meal and all the manager could do was hand us a bill with a smile saying sorry.
Leyna K.,"Garden Grove, CA",33,49,13,4.0,2/23/2012,"I came here around noon with my boyfriend and even though it looked really filled, we were seated immediately. The servers were nice and really attentive. We got the Firecracker Salmon ($11) as an appetizer and it was AMAZING. The sauce is so good!! I only wish they would make it into an entree, instead of having it be an appetizer with a measly four pieces!  I always order the Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon (lunch portion is $13, dinner is $16) for my entree. I tell myself I'll order something else the next time I come, but I can't seem to stray from it! I guess I just love me some salmon. :) The Frozen Iced Mango is also really good. At $6, it's a little overpriced but I think it deserves a try. I really like the red velvet cheesecake, but we were too full for dessert. We'll come back for you, red velvet!"
Hiking M.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,35,3,4.0,7/5/2014,Love the cajun chicken Littles. Best place to people watch is at the booth in the bar area. If you want exceptional service every time male sure to ask for Tim. He is the best. :)
Sumayyah E.,"Irvine, CA",5,36,7,1.0,8/13/2015,"Zero stars if I could. The service is horrible. Me and my friend were seated for 15 min and no one came I had to call someone and say can we order, the waiter left and came and he was like oh I didn't know they opened my section. Great. We ordered the big nachos for an appetizer and if was overly salty. The waiter came to our table a total of 2 times and that's after I had to ask where my salad was after our main meal came. The food was okay but nothing that would make me come back. Oh and I went into the women's restroom and nearly fell- it was flooded with sewer water . It was right at the entrance so my ballet flAt went right into it. Disgusting. The toilets were clogged up with toilet paper and water all around them as well. I told a waitress and she was like yeah we'll look we didn't know. How can you not know there's wAter coming from underneath and the bathroom is flooded. I would never return to this location. Absolutely disgusting."
Rachel H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",745,954,13280,1.0,11/2/2013,This is the third time I've been to the Cheesecake Factory. First time actually eating food other than cheesecake. The first time I went we just got cheesecake at this location. A few months back we went to the MV location and they tried to seat us at a dirty table then realizing this moved us to another one once we were seated I looked at our silver wear and noticed green stuff in my fork wile my lady noticed lipstick still on her glass we were just over it and grossed out with how dirty it was so we walked out. The management ended up mailing us a gift card to come back because my lady complained to them hence why we went here for Halloween. Once seated it took quite a wile for them to ask us for drinks and even longer to get the drinks (Alcoholic and waters) once we finally got them my lady's water glass was half full when the server put it on the table kinda strange but okay the daiquiri I ordered wasn't bad but it definitely tasted virgin. For some reason they said they were out of bread and making more a good amount of time went by and once we got bread it wasn't fresh it was kinda cold definitely were lied to about that. About 45min or so passed from when we ordered food to when got it thats a really long time for pasta when its uncrowded. Both of our dishes were tasty and hot I just wish I could have ordered another drink our server never came back to check on us or to get us more drinks or even fill our water for that matter. Cheesecake Factory lacks customer service and is overrated I don't see what the big deal about this place is doubt ill ever come back.
Christine Y.,"Irvine, CA",182,103,18,1.0,12/13/2014,"I'll preface this by saying I am usually left unsatisfied whenever I come here but there's such a large variety of menu options that I usually come back when I'm feeling indecisive. Since it was a Saturday evening, it was pretty packed. We were seated outside which was okay but, of course, people seated in the outdoor lounge areas were obnoxious. People clearly don't read the ""no smoking"" signs (think chain smokers that are just lounging without anything better to do on a Saturday night) and this older (mid to late 30s or maybe 40s) couple were making out (think soft porn.. I think I puked a little).  Now that you have an idea of the ambience, or lack thereof, on to the food and service. It was busy so I'll take it easy on the server. But when you run out of the brown bread, and double up on sourdough, make sure to bring the brown bread out when it's ready rather than me having to ask for it seeing other tables get served the usual brown and sour combo. THEN the server takes back the sourdough and comes out with a double up on brown. No, I didn't want any sourdough, thanks. Ugh. Then our food arrives, I ordered the chicken Alfredo. Big mistake. It had so much salt I literally drank 2.5 cups of water at the restaurant, ordered a strawberry lemonade to go (which I downed by the time I got back to my car) AND when I got to my next destination, I drank an entire Snapple. Yup, ridiculous. Worst $50 ever spent."
Michele K.,"Irvine, CA",534,307,475,2.0,11/20/2011,"Don't get me wrong.  I LOVE Cheesecake factory!  However, this review is solely for the last time I went there.   It was a friday night and my friend and I totally expected a long wait to eat at Cheesecake.  When we walked up to the front, they told us that we would be seated immediately if we sat outside.  We were told to stand on the side for a ""moment"" and they would call us right away.  At least 15 minutes passed and they still didn't call us.   I went up to the front and asked if they had called our name... just in case we didn't hear them... and apparently they hadn't.  After waiting 20 minutes, we left.  It's one thing to give an accurate approximation of the wait time and its another to straight up lie and then make you wait longer than you expect to.   Cheesecake, next time say the truth and don't say that you can immediately seat people when you can't."
Kim R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",43,54,,4.0,4/22/2013,"We were bored so we went to Irvine Spectrum for a movie and had a dinner at this place. We tried a Filet Mignon and Grilled Rib-Eye Steak, they were delicious/ tasty. Delicious french fries too. We sat in the outside of the building.. it was a good ambience. It wasn't take that long for the food to arrived even though it was super busy. (Irvine Spectrum on Saturday night, you can imagine)."
Hannah C.,"New York, NY",557,398,1013,2.0,8/23/2012,"As always, the food is super good. But for this one occasion, I decided to choose a healthier choice so I chose the Asian chicken lettuce wraps out of the ""Skinnylicious"" menu. When I told the waiter my order, he said that the Asian chicken lettuce wraps are actually Thai and if that's okay. And I said that was fine. When I got the check, it said 13$ instead of 6$. I asked my waiter about it and he said that he would get the manager. When I talked to the manager, she made it seem like it was MY fault that I made the wrong order. Um, how is it my fault that your waiter got my order messed up? Anyways, she gave me attitude for something that wasn't my fault which just ruined the night. The food is great, but I have to say, the service is terrible."
Jen L.,"Irvine, CA",894,652,69,4.0,12/28/2013,Hmmm... I'm surprised by all the mixed reviews! This location along with the Bella Terra location are my favorites. My only gripe is the line can be a long wait on weekends... aside from that I've never had a bad experience. The patio is a nice option for seating if the weather permits. Great for people watching too! The service here has always been great and prompt! My fave thing to indulge on here is the Steak Diane with Shrimp Scampi or the Salmon with Mashed Potatoes. If I feel like not fitting into my jeans tomorrow then I always go for the Strawberry Cheesecake. It's like 5000 calories but who's counting. There is a skinny menu for folks watching their figure!
Suzanne R.,"San Diego, CA",244,5,4,1.0,9/20/2014,First time here and it took them 20 minutes to realize we were sitting without even the waiter asking to give us waters. The waitress didn't even talk to us one time and forced a tip 5 minutes before we were leaving. Two people walked out of the restaurant without even being served and that should be enough of a sign. Never coming here again.
Brad T.,"Lake Forest, CA",111,190,14,4.0,3/7/2012,"I'm with Al S., as far as his opinion on this Cheesecake Factory location.  I've been here numerous times and the food and service are always superb.  Food always comes out hot and fresh, and servers are always attentive.  The menu is extensive, with plenty of comfort food.  They now have nutritional information on the tables too... or if your table doesn't have a pamphlet, you can request one.  I usually order comfort food here, so accordingly, here are my favorite items: 1) Factory meatloaf - try mixing the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes on your fork at the same time - wow! 2) Salisbury steak - I know it's a retro-type food, but I got it for the first time last time I was here and it's pretty damn good - similar to the meatloaf, but smaller 3) Chicken and biscuits - grilled chicken along with mashed potatoes and gravy, and biscuits.  Calorie overload, so take some home - or get the gravy on the side 4) Shepard's Pie - more meat and potatoes... All of the small bite appetizers we've tried are good too - and always brought out quickly.  For cocktails, try their manhattan - assuming you like bourbon.  Some places you can wait 10+ minutes to get your drink... not so at the Cheesecake Factory.  I won't go into detail on dessert choices... they aren't called the Cheesecake Factory for nothing."
Jpiggy C.,"Irvine, CA",8,31,1,3.0,2/16/2014,"Our server was great, and the food we got was fresh and tasty, the only bummer is that they took away the sweetened green tea and they changed the sauce that comes with their spring rolls, such a bummer, it's also weird that they only have two tables to accommodate people with small lap dogs, considering the spectrum is So canine friendly everywhere else, over all its an ok place for lunch and we will presumably be back"
Kelsey B.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",5,26,6,4.0,9/12/2014,"I ordered take out last night for my husband and I and it was amazing! I went in and patiently waited while the girl at the take out counter was on the phone she hadn't acknowledged i was there but that's OK. Another girl came up she was very nice and was eager to help me! As she was greeting me another gal was bringing my food out and was very nice and offered warm bread and butter to take home. If this was my entire experience i would of rated 5 stars however when the girl finally got off the phone she was not friendly, welcoming and made me feel like an inconvenience. The food was amazing when we got home i would definitely recommend this to friends and family!"
Kevin A.,"Irvine, CA",2,6,1,5.0,10/8/2014,This place is great. Staff are polite and professional. One of the best.  Times that are busy they try their best to keep everything organized. Usually you are called before the estimated wait time which is great.
Leo R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,,2.0,8/2/2015,Below par with the neighboring restaurants in the area. Drinks are expensive and food has bland flavor.
Vanessa C.,"Temecula, CA",75,9,7,4.0,4/11/2013,"I recently came here to celebrate moms birthday & we loved it! We came during a weekday for lunch so the wait wasn't bad but I would imagine it gets busy on the weekends, especially because of the location. The restaurant is very nice & the service was amazing! Big Upps to Tim! We loved the food & of course the cheesecake was delicious! So basically you would love it!"
