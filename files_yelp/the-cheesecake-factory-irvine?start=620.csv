Jennifer L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",145,177,145,2.0,2/23/2012,"So I am generally not a fan of chains, however, I am simply writing this review because the Manager here is absolutely positively the nicest woman I have ever met.  She is accommodating and even with our bad experience here she really did make our night better.  I feel terrible for losing her card but in case anyone from the restaurant is reading this she has brown hair, is caucasian, and really nice! (idk if that helps much but I tried!)  She really does deserve a raise.   Now, on to the next note.  Their waiting staff is not a very bright bunch.  They are slow, don't check up on you very often, and seem to have a common trait of forgetting various parts of your order.  I have been here probably 5 times in the past 4 months and 5 out of those 5 times I have had something wrong with my order.  There has been hair in my food, plates coming in extremely cold, and appetizers completely forgotten. The most recent time I came here we didn't even receive our food for 45 minutes to an hour because they had forgotten to place our orders!!!  It's a wonder that our waiter didn't even say anything to us, I personally think she forgot we were a a part of her section!  Despite these terrible experiences I am simply giving this place 2 stars. 1 for the cheesecake and 1 for the manager. Hazzaaa!"
Lawrence L.,"Covina, CA",513,1037,7335,4.0,6/13/2010,"Been to the Cheesecake Factory in Pasadena and Huntington Beach many times, this is the first time at this location at the Spectrum... Known for their desserts, their regular menu is also pretty good.  I had a bowl of clam chowder that was thoroughly satisfying and filling... not the cheap skimpy portion that you sometimes get at other places. I wish I remembered how big the portions were to begin with because I also ordered the Chicken Avocado Club sandwich too and although it was delicious, I could only eat half of it and bag the rest. My better half was smarter and although she also had the bowl of clam chowder, she was absolutely delighted with the arugula, beet, and feta salad that she had. My other dinner guests were happy with their Chicken Madeira and Chicken Marsala and Mushroom plates. One warning: the portions are huge -- 3 out of 4 of us wound up bagging.  Our server was very courteous and attentive.  Thumbs up for being open late... a little bit of a wait at this location but that's pretty typical of them all I think."
Dianne H.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,32,4,3.0,9/20/2012,"My friends and I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I brought my friends here thinking that everything on the menu was pretty good.  One of my friends is a vegetarian.  I suggested trying their Veggie Burger.  Logical idea.. or so I thought.  Much to my dismay, this ""burger"" comes out looking like it's bleeding on the plate.  Rest assured, it was just the coloring of the beets they're using in the patty, but it's just not a good look for anyone.  My friend could barely stand to look at the ""burger"", much less eat it.  Despite the lack of food appeal, I have to say that our server, Brandon, was absolutely delightful.   Just a thought... Change your veggie patty Cheesecake Factory... It's the only reason you got 3 stars :("
Mandy M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",39,45,1,4.0,6/3/2014,"Have had nothing but good experiences here despite what other reviews say. Experienced good food, service and take out."
Myrna C.,"New York, NY",214,118,42,5.0,8/31/2012,"One of my favorite places to go when I'm looking for a place to eat out at close to home. I've been coming here since I was a kid, but stopped coming at one point. Now, I'm back here all the time. The best part about this place is how extensive their menu is. It's pretty easy to find something for everyone. My two favorite dishes, as of late, have been the Pasta Da Vinci and the Sausage Ricotta Flatbread. I think I've ordered that pasta dish EVERY SINGLE TIME for the last five or six times; it hasn't gotten old. The flavors are so amazing; the sauce is a little on the sweeter side, which isn't usually something that I like, but something about this pasta is just bomb. Plus, the portobello mushrooms really add something to it. What's great about the Sausage Ricotta Flatbread is that it's on their new Skinnylicious menu. I think it's only $5.95 and under 490 calories!!!  Cheap and healthy, not to mention delicious.  We always get a slice of cheesecake after the meal too. The last one we tried was the Pina Colada as well as the Banana Cream. I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the flavors. They're all superb. Since it's a chain, if I'm out travelling and don't know where to go, there's usually a Cheesecake Factory somewhere nearby to satisfy my hunger."
J R.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,6,,4.0,9/8/2015,GREAT place to come with friends and all ages will find something on the menu they like.  Love the gift bears in the front too!  My 17 year old just bought one!
Marla W.,"Corona, CA",341,125,6,4.0,4/27/2014,"I had no idea that the Cheesecake Factory had a happy hour in the bar area with discounted food and drink specials! We had some great appetizers and the service was wonderful! We had our toddler with us and his kids mac and cheese was delicious (not that boxed Kraft junk). I will definitely come here again! Happy Hour is from 4-7 in the bar! Also, don't forget the dulce de leche cheesecake! Amazing!"
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,1888,1488,3.0,1/6/2012,"No wait if you go before 6 pm. Service was nice, but all the dishes were not as tasty as I remember from 10 years ago.  Avocado rolls: meh Rib eye: good but a little salty Garlic noodles: deceiving, not very garlic-y at all and they charge $3 extra for 4 shrimps. Just 4!"
Patrick E.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/22/2015,"Let me preface this one star with the fact that my family meets here 4-5 times a year for birthdays, usually a party of 10-12 and have always had a good experience. This one star is for the manager Chris. Here's my story... I was taking my brother, sister and our families out for their birthdays. We arrived at 5pm, put our name in and was told it would be about 20 min. But didn't get seated until 5:40 but figured no big deal. Our waitress was very nice, took our drink orders but she was very busy. She took our food order at about 6:00 but our food did not arrive until about  6:45. Again, no big deal. At 7:15 they came and sang happy birthday. Here is where the 1 star comes in. At about 7:25 Chris the manager comes over to ask how everything was and then proceeded to tell us they had a 2 hour time limit and we needed to leave. It took 40-45 min for our food to arrive but now we have out stayed our welcome. I feel this was very rude and needless to say we will not be going back to the Irvine spectrum Cheesecake Factory again!"
Wesley V.,"West Covina, CA",61,192,66,4.0,1/7/2014,"I took a friend here for brunch. It was busy but not too busy for a Sunday morning. According to my friend, this place gets crazy packed starting at lunchtime.  I was a little appalled to realize that they actually had to ask us if we wanted their bread. I thought every Cheesecake Factory brings some out unconditionally. Anyway I had the skinnylicious chicken sandwich which has less than 590 calories with some salad on the plate. My friend had the blueberry pancakes and his son had the kids pancakes with some fruits. The blueberry pancakes came out as two large pieces with blueberries inside and an extra three on top. He ordered a side of potatoes. Being the assertive guy that he is, he asked for a completely new plate because the initial one was hotter than the potatoes themselves.  The waitress, whom I forgot her name, was very nice. She always made sure we enjoyed everything we had.  I would say that this Cheesecake Factory is good but not the best I've been to yet. I still think the Pasadena location is my favorite."
FoodLover G.,"Laguna Beach, CA",0,17,40,2.0,6/22/2014,"The food is always hit or miss. Today was a miss. The server, Arman, was very helpful and attentive. But the eggs were cold and runny."
Monica S.,"Seattle, WA",787,515,1496,3.0,9/17/2011,"Ok, so this isn't my first time to cheesecake factory, but I just had to review it because there are just some things that bug me about this place! This quality of food is good, and the bread is delicious! I swear you could just have a meal with that! Oh and of course the delicious cheesecake, but they discontinued my favorite one (oreo mudslide)! :( Basically, in a nutshell, I don't see the big deal in not being able to split checks, which is almost every time in the evening because they get crazy busy! C.F. should know they almost always get big groups of people. Our waiter was good in the beginning, but later started slacking. I ordered a Passion fruit mojito (which was REALLY GOOD, btw), but the server forgot to tell the bartender so I got it like 45 minutes late. I mean why don't they write it down or go tell the person ASAP?! Who did he think he told? The little man inside of his head?? Also, our server took a break in between so this other man took over and forgot to add the birthday cheesecake onto our order, and took FOREVER to get the other check which means we were just sitting there waiting for the check for a good 30 minutes. In the end, we were thoroughly upset with Cheesecake factory and just wanted to get out of there.  This is definitely not the first time it has happened, the staff just don't really care about their customers and they are always way too crowded!"
J S.,"Irvine, CA",86,400,11,4.0,10/11/2011,"My daughters love the chicken romano. In fact, when they order, the servers are amazed that they can take down a full adult sized portion. I've moved around on my ordering from pastas, to jumbalayas, to sandwiches. Service has always been a plus there, and the dessert are to die for. Yeah it's a chain, but it doesn't feel like a chain.   It feels like the meals are prepared with care."
Rachel R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",83,352,187,4.0,4/8/2014,"Good ol' Cheesecake Factory.  I got my usual spicy cashew chicken.  We had a really nice waitress who kept the bread and drinks coming.  It was busy but we didn't have to wait too long for the food.  We got a chocolate rasberry truffle piece of cheesecake and Chris' crazy cheesecake to share.  Both are so good.  Chris' piece is great if you really like a lot of flavors:  coconut, German chocolate, fudge, etc.  Overall it was a good experience."
Max N.,"Irvine, CA",8,11,,4.0,1/1/2013,"New Year's Eve dinner last night..... The food was great, the service excellent and humorous... It's not the cheapest place to eat, but we like it a lot....."
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,7/17/2009,"For a group of 11 girls, our waiter was nice, but not very good...Someone had to ask for buffalo sauce 4 times.. and by the time she got it - we were all done eating!  They now have a separate booklet that includes the calories of each dish they have. CHeck it out! It looks just like a menu, but thinner. You'll be surprised how many calories some dishes are. The booklet is great though! You can order based on how many calories you're willing to consume. I used to love cheesecake factory but i think their lunch menu got smaller. Even so, definitely get the lunch salad + pizza because it's actually a lot more than you expect! My da vinci pasta was only so so. I rather have their carbonara.  Their cheesecakes are still amazing though! My favorite is still the original with fresh strawberries, even with all their fancy schmancy cheesecakes. Decadent, rich, and sooo good."
Ron A.,"Whittier, CA",105,711,214,4.0,3/13/2012,"We typically come here on a Saturday evening. It is busy and noisy, but the cheesecake is always good."
Criss P.,"Lake Forest, CA",9,6,,5.0,5/12/2014,"This restaurant chain always seems to get it right. Sometimes they are busy and can't seat you on time but the great service, excellent ambiance and exceptional food make up for the wait. Went there for mothers day and only waited 10 minutes before we were seated. Bang bang chicken and shrimp is delicious highly recommend it!"
Joe S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/3/2015,"Had a fantastic experience here yesterday.  The hosts were very friendly, greeting us promptly and seating us within a few minutes as promised.  Our server Natalie was awesome!  She was happy to answer any question we had about the extensive menu and provided excellent service."
MarMaz M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",4,28,13,5.0,12/14/2013,"We were there on sat noon. We ordered a Kobe burger and a chicken Madeira. They were delicious and tasty. Also, we order a dulce de leche caramel cheese cake, which was so sweet and suited to my wife taste. In overall, everything was perfect and it was worthy."
