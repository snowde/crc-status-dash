S T.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,7,2,1.0,7/31/2011,"I will never eat here again. (See Photos) First off, I loved The Cheescake Factory but I am disgusted with the experience I had there today. It was extremely busy, which I understand, but that does not excuse unsanitary practices. When I first sat down, my fork was dirty. I excused that because I thought, hey I have two forks here I am not getting a salad I will just use the other one. Then, the dish that my ranch was brought out in had a used Splenda packet plastered to the side of it. I didn't notice this until I had already eaten the ranch. Needless to say I was thoroughly disgusted. Obviously the dish was either unwashed and reused, or the machine that washes the dishes is so ineffective that it leaves Splenda packets adhered to the side of everything. Whatever the explanation, it was absolutely disgusting. The fact that it made it all the way to my table escaping notice is just unsanitary.  I was unable to finish my meal and when I told the waiter he said ""hey that looks like a Splenda packet."" Yea, it does. He did not even offer any sort of consolation for the fact that I couldn't even finish my food.  If I had more time I would have complained to the manager, but I had to catch a train.  Our server was really nice, but I can honestly say never again."

Joe L.,"Murrieta, CA",241,47,131,4.0,4/17/2012,"I have never had a meal here.  I only go for the cheese cake.  It's good.   When I walk around and see the food it all looks very good.  I just for some reason, I don't know why, have never thought to eat here."
Dan N.,"Santa Ana, CA",388,252,364,4.0,2/4/2012,"Came here last night and had Dorothy, I think she goes by Dotty, as our server and she was AWESOME. Not like I equate The Cheesecake Factory with bad service, though I've had before from the Irvine location, Dotty was very warm and sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. I liked that she asked questions. I say this because when I asked for warm water, she asked if I meant tap or actual heated water."
Joseph R.,"Irvine, CA",43,22,,5.0,10/16/2013,The best day IMHO to eat at cheesecake is Sunday Brunch. Between the Belgium Waffles with Strawberries and Chantilly Cream and the Brioche French Toast you'll almost forget to save room for the Smore's Cheesecake. Top any of the fluffy cakebattery treats with a sugary sticky maple syrup that makes a bee jealous. I also recommend the fresh Orange Juice.
Terri S.,"Santa Ana, CA",11,119,,1.0,3/28/2014,"Ok so we have tried them 3 times now thinking things would get better. The place is cramped, the food says spicy but it is not!, their menu is too big for their cooks to making any dishes well. I feel like food is from out of a can. Your never sure who your server is and the uniforms are always stained-then why wear white!! Unimpressed."
James K.,"Irvine, CA",0,21,,3.0,5/4/2014,Portions are huge but the quality is average. My kids love the bread.  Our server was ok today but kinda cold to our kids.  He also took a while I bring the drinks and forgot the kids lemonade twice.
Daniel S.,"Oceanside, CA",51,12,,4.0,5/1/2014,Good food and great cheesecake. I bought a whole cake one for the office and everyone loved it. I generally get the chicken bellagio as it is a lot of food for a decent price. The lunch combo with a salad and pizza for about 10$ is a good deal. Sometimes it takes a while to get your food though. Also one things my friends all notice is that the scenery posts inside look like the eye of sauron.
Ellen S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,29,,4.0,12/21/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory has wonderful food, and a great variety!  But for some reason they have discontinued my favorite menu item - Thai Chicken Pasta. It was absolutely outstanding! Although it was very popular, it's gone.  ??   Never the less, they have great food and excellent service. You just have to go during non-busy times...if you can!"
Anne T.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",157,1,,1.0,5/13/2011,"Don't eat the pasta! Totally got food poisoning from this restaurant and everyone I tell my story to is not surprised. They always ask ""was it the cheesecake factory at the spectrum?"" Due to complications, I had to use a bunch of sick time this week.... Nightmare! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone, but i have heard the other cheesecake factories are good."
Gabe P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",321,961,698,3.0,12/26/2013,"Since it was Christmas Eve and other restaurants closed early we ended up here. Not sure why but this one is not very appealing to me, it might just be that it looks like everything is all set up in a perfect order and you just have to get in and ride it like on a conveyor belt or something. It's too well structured and it follows a pattern, like there is no room to move or be a little outside of what they want you to be. Low and behold it was full so we sat at the bar, outside of the perfectly aligned tables, and it was OK. They have a full menu there and they have more items there now than before, we tried a few small plates and some beer on tap. The Samosas are good but nothing special, the crab cakes are good but nothing special, the fried cheese sticks are good, but I would say there is nothing special. And even though the tables were all taken and they had a long line at the door there were plenty of empty tables in the bar area, where they serve a full menu! So I guess the customers actually like the perfect table pattern and they'd rather wait 20 minutes than seat at a different shaped table. The service was absolutely perfect and the peanut butter cheese we had for dessert was great."
Kaitlin S.,"Vancouver, WA",0,2,,1.0,6/29/2015,"Gave us the worst seat in the place (others were available), took FOREVER to bring us our drinks only to find out they don't have diet coke (weird) so they brought water, took FOREVER to take our order, FOREVER to bring us our food then gave my friend a salad when she ordered french fries, FOREVER to bring us dessert, FOREVER to bring us the check- we had to ask for it, 'forgot' to bring a box when I asked. It was ridiculous. The only thing good about this place is the food. I had the farfalle and strawberry cheesecake and it was amazing."
Eric R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",241,28,9,2.0,5/17/2012,"HH drink deals ok HH sliders were not worth it, skipped out on the grilled onions, i had to ask for extra HH crab wontons, enough on the plate for 3-4, i just didn't enjoy the flavor HH avocado egg rolls were just deep fried diced avocados, sounded better on the menu"
Michelle H.,"Irvine, CA",218,395,47,3.0,2/23/2012,"I was here for lunch with my fiance and it was filled with families doing the same thing.  Like any true OC resident, I've been here a million times and I knew that we would go and probably nosh on a tasty salad and burger.  What I did not anticipate was the SCREAMING table of children on either side of me.  Now let's get one thing straight, I realize that kids are tough to deal with.... But to let your kids take complete control of the dining table and aisle ways is completely ridiculous.   When we asked our waitress if we could be moved, she went to the server station but came back with a no go since the wait had been so long for ANY tables in the restaraunt (1 HOUR!).  She offered us an outside table, but it was a little too chilly for my taste.  We stayed inside and the waitress tried to keep us comfortable by keeping service quick and making sure our drinks were consistently filled so we could get outta there ASAP.   I ordered a BBQ chicken salad and my fiance and a the pulled pork sandwich.  As usual, Cheesecake delivered with tasty food.  The BBQ chicken salad is always pretty perfect and my fiance's pulled pork sandwich was good, but I think he wished he had ordered a burger instead since the pulled pork was DOUSED in BBQ sauce and a little to goopy for his taste.   We opted to skip dessert because both screaming tables of children had gone from bad to worse.   Pros: -Good Food  -Large Portions -Nice Servers Cons: -LOUD... LOUD... LOUUUUDD! -Long waits for tables -Food/Drinks are pricy for such a large chain"
Caitlyn C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/21/2014,"Amazing food, friendly and attentive (but not obnoxious) service, and a wonderful atmosphere. I recommend this restaurant highly, if you want a great steak check it out."
Brij P.,"Irvine, CA",1,19,3,4.0,6/17/2015,"I think the service is excellent here. The waitress went out of her way to accommodate for our needs. The food though is inconsistent. I go here pretty often since I am a fan of the dinner. I feel like everytime, I am trying something different even while ordering the same food. Consistency would definitely help this place."
Lauren D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,53,,4.0,1/7/2014,"Love the Cheesecake Factory. They literally have anything and everything you might be craving. The service has always been good when i've gone and because of it's size the seating is very accommodating whether it be outside, inside, somewhere quiet, loud, etc.  The prices are a little steep but then again they do give you HUGE portions of food!"
Jim L.,"San Diego, CA",252,712,226,4.0,5/11/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory basically has something for everyone. Whether it be pasta, seafood, steaks or sandwiches, this place has got it. A great selection of appetizers to choose from so you're able to start your meal off with one of their tasty combinations.  The thing I find ironic about their menu is that they have a listing called weight management salads and below that is the desert menu. I'm always willing to sacrifice a meal to have desert.  You cannot come here without having some cheesecake. I'm as vanilla as they get and whenever I want cheesecake, I have to go with The Original. My wife however is under the believe that cheese and cake should not be in the same word so needless to say, I don't eat cheesecake often, which is probably a good thing.  This location is in the Irvine Spectrum and can get very busy on any given night. There is plenty of parking however a walk may be necessary.  With that being said, this is basically like any other Cheesecake Factory out there."
Christine K.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",103,288,19,3.0,12/5/2011,"Service was okay.  When they brought us the appetizer and main course that we were sharing, they didn't bring us plates so we either had to eat from the main dish directly or wait until our food  got cold.  Other than that a pretty standard cheesecake factory. They're notorious for being consistent."
Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2,3.0,1/9/2014,"I wish you could give half stars on Yelp because I think this place really rightfully falls between ""meh i've experienced better"" and ""a-ok"".  Since that's not an option, I'll be generous and round up. As I've said before, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but my boyfriend got a giftcard for Christmas so we decided to take a night off from cooking and grab dinner here.  Despite the epic length of their menu, there was nothing I was dying to try, only options I was willing to eat.  My boyfriend and I each ordered a glass of wine and I ordered the Cajun chicken littles (essentially breaded chicken fingers with mashed potatoes and succotash) and he ordered the Bellagio Chicken (I think that's what it was called) on the server's recommendation.  While my meal was fine, there was absolutely nothing Cajun about the chicken fingers - the breading was absolutely bland and I would have killed from some tapito or sirracha or something.  Happily, my boyfriend really enjoyed his meal.  The bill for this relatively simple meal came to $50.17 which I consider pricey for a chain given what we orderd, but the portions were absolutely gargantuan.  We both could have easily been full (despite being starving when we sat down) just sharing one entree, but we weren't familiar with the restaurant so we ordered two. While the service was good and the meal was fine, I don't think we'll hurry back.  I'd prefer to go to a non-chain that serves better meals with more reasonable portions for the same money or less."
