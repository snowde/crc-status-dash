Caroline C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,2,2,4.0,6/5/2014,"It's already packed by the time I went there,around 4:30 p.m.The menu is huge.The  ones recommended taste good.Still,I have to say food on skinnylicious menu doesn't seem to go for me."
Han K.,"Cerritos, CA",75,43,34,3.0,1/23/2011,"You know you might be going to a restaurant a little too often when you've just about tried every single item on the menu.  I wish this weren't true, especially since Cheesecake Factory is always on the ""Not That!"" section of every ""Eat This..Not That!"" article, but sadly it is.  On the plus side, I get to give ya'll a comprehensive idea of the highs and lows of my visits here. Highs - Love the bread - you get unlimited sourdough and whole wheat baguettes. - Spicy crispy chicken sandwich - try this at least once if you like Jack In the Box's version - upscale junk food at its finest. - Thai lettuce wraps - appetizer that can be eaten as a meal.  One of the lowest calorie options on the menu and won't make you feel bloated afterwards. - One of the best places for dessert.  I've gone in a few times just to order a cheesecake with my girlfriend. - Salads are huge and quite delicious.  Every salad has a strong crunch element, making each salad texturally unique and interesting to eat. Lows - Food is inconsistent.  I wanted to label jambalaya and the gumbo as highs, but unfortunately the dishes can be hit or miss.  One day you get it, it will be tremendously flavorful.  At other times it will be too oily and bland.   - Happy hour is a joke (if they still have it).  Just walk a few stores down to Yardhouse instead. - Cocktails are overpriced and not good - The Robert Mondavi house wines are awful - believe it or not Charles Shaw is better. - Never, ever get the breakfast food - far too greasy for my tastes.  Not sure exactly why, but this place is always packed with people.  If you've got better options or have a place bookmarked that you'd like to try, do yourself a favor and go there instead."
Cyndi H.,"Vista, CA",37,17,,4.0,2/12/2014,"What's new bout this place! 9 out of 10 times it's amazing!!! Great food, great service and as always a lil cheesecake for the family to take home! This time I chose from the skinnylicious menu and was quite surprised at the size of portion and flavor. Way too much to eat and so much rich flavor! It was delish! Only thing I was surprised about was that we arrived at 5:30 and they said they didn't have enough servers for the patio... This is southern California and yes a much warmer day than usual in February but still be prepared to seat the patio at all times in so cal!!"
Kim M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",258,250,10,4.0,12/20/2013,Menu has changed.  They took off the taquitos which were my favorite appetizer.  Prices seem to have increased but service is great.
Senor C.,"Blue Lake, CA",1,47,1,1.0,3/29/2011,"Food-borne illness review:  This an excerpt from a letter sent to headquarters.  Which I received a response to within 24 hours (+1star), however it was the restaurant manager who proceeded to make excuses and state how he checked the books and made sure all food was cooked to proper temperature.  What he was not aware of and did not address was that I probably gt sick from either a sick server or food prep employee.  All I received was excuses and no responsibility taken.  I did write a formal complaint to the county department of health.    ""My wife and I had been visiting family and we decided to enjoy a Sunday breakfast at the restaurant.  The service from our patio server was attentive and courteous, however the menu selection I chose was very flavorless and off-tasting.  This complaint is not with the taste or appearance of the food, but rather the food-borne illness I contracted immediately afterwords.  I became very ill and was incapacitated for about two days."""
Erik S.,"Tustin, CA",12,33,18,2.0,7/17/2013,"I love the food but I had a bad experience there for the second time in 12 months. I went with my grandfather and he broke his denture on an olive that was supposed to be pitted but they missed one. The manger apologized and paid for the meal and the dental bill. At least they made it right. I am going again tonight, looking forward to a better experience."
Edson H.,"Irvine, CA",306,183,106,4.0,6/23/2011,"Food is always pretty good, wait times are, well, wait times.  Anyone else wonder why I need to wear mountain climbing shoes when I come here so I don't slip and fall on my face? That floor is like greased the heck up.  What's up with the mega slippery floors?"
Evan S.,"Santa Ana, CA",48,45,9,3.0,1/23/2011,"My opinion of The Cheesecake Factory in general is that it is normally pretty good service/food wise.  This location fit right into that category and in my mind was as usual, just OK. Service-Seated promptly, waiter brought water and bread while I was in the bathroom.  Prompt with taking our order, bringing the food, and the check.  Very impersonal service, but the guy seemed nice enough.  A refill on my water that was empty for about 75% of the time would have been nice  **waves hands in the air menacingly!!!** I decided that as a new couple rule (we both yelp) that we can't eat the same thing anymore.  I ended up being the first victim of this rule and had to forgo my Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp..CUUURRSSSEESS!!  Instead, I got some Vietnamese spicy garlic w/e the hell it was.  When it came I took my first bite annnndddd...ehhermm drum roll please..the chicken tasted like glorified sweet and sour chicken.  It left me with the feeling that the 5$ meal at Panda Express would have offered me the same satisfaction.  Moral of the story, don't get this item..boring and not really spicy at all.  The gf's food was good as usual, but I didn't pick too much.  However, she was warned that I might attack her at any second to steal her food..muahaha!..=p. Long story short, predictable, boring, and reliable.  Not much more to ask of from a chain restaurant, but still a good place to stop by."
J S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,36,3,1.0,7/4/2013,"Granted it was July 4th, and employees have the day off, thus being short staffed is a given. After being seated for 15 minutes, and not one of the 10 waiters/waitresses passing by even acknowledged our presence, we left.     I agree with reviews that the staff here is in need of additional basic training.  The manager was no where to be found either.  I think the Cheesecake Factory (Irvine Spectrum location) should start placing manuals on how to use the computers so customers can place their own orders."
Steven L.,"Irvine, CA",1,10,3,1.0,10/9/2014,"I have tried cheesecake factory in the past and the food was always great . however this review was for curbside. Just skip it, it's a mess. Person who took the order was okay. Was told it would take 15 min. Took 40 min while the curbside pickup spot is located where the valet parking is so if you are in a hurry, just dine-in. Food was way too salty like they based their pasta sauces with extreme amounts of bacon fat and not in a good way. Only good thing about this experience was the free bread so +1."
Jessica J.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,19,,5.0,4/9/2015,"Happy hour rocks!! Appetizers are the bomb for $5.50 each & good drinks. So far best server in bar is Johnny. Week days are less crowded, bar area is small.."
Gigi M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1001,687,2181,4.0,3/31/2011,"We hung out at the bar for drinks and dessert.  I liked my red raspberry martini, very sweet and I could barely taste the alqui!  That's fine in my book since I drink more for the flavor than to get wasted but I will say that others would feel jipped cuz they were skimping on the alqui!  I usually get a little buzzed after a drink but I didn't feel anything at all when I finished this one!   We decided to share a slice of keylime cheesecake, so glad we tried their mango keylime instead, as suggested by our server!  We all loved it!  It had a great combo of sweet, tangy and coconuty!"
Dominique M.,"Laguna Beach, CA",32,74,9,4.0,12/25/2011,"This is only about dessert.  My boyfriend took me here last Tuesday, the 20th to celebrate us standing each other for a whole year. He loves cheesecake, and oreos, and coffee, and I love chocolate and what do you know, the Cheesecake Factory has it all, and more. He ordered a Kahula Coffee Chessecake, and of course an Oreo Cheesecake, and I ordered a Godiva Chocolate Brownie...Sundae (pretty sure that's what it was).  Woo, little did I know how BIG the sundae was going to be. Well of course my boyfriend devoured his cakes, while I slowly worked half way through my extremely rich, chocolaty brownies with vanilla ice cream and piles of whipped cream drizzled in chocolate syrup. Ugh, sooo delicious but I could only handle half, my boyfriend had to finish the rest. As of right now, I would not order it again just because of it's thick, dark, richness, I went through 2 1/2 glasses of water to help, but don't get me wrong, I'm a chocoholic and I loved it, it was just too much. My boyfriend absolutely loved his cheesecake, ""divine."" We only came for dessert and that was enough to make us want to go the sleep instead of go to the movies, but we went to the movies. :)"
Mark W.,"Greene, NY",0,11,,4.0,6/27/2012,"Dining with an infant who isn't old enough to sit in a high chair is sometimes an issue -- but not here at the Cheesecake Factory.  My wife and I have visited twice now with a stroller in tow and each time, they've cheerfully found us a place where we can take the stroller to our table!  Score! Food here has been consistent and flavorful.  The Tuna Tataki Salad is very good, and the other menu items we've ordered have been average or above. The one biggest complaint is their lack of refills for soda beverages.  When you're going to charge over two dollars for a drink, I expect refills when it's empty without having to ask. Overall, a great place to dine with children."
Ying-Hsuan L.,"Irvine, CA",32,32,45,4.0,12/20/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a good choice. Some of my favorites here are the Chicken Bellagio, Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, Four Cheese Pasta and the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Their pastas do not come with sides, but you get a choice of two sides for the burgers and fish dishes. The mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and french fries are my go-to sides. And if you want, you can switch out any of the sides that come with whatever you order. If you substitute sweet potato fries instead of regular fries for your side, there is an extra charge.  This specific location is always pretty busy and the wait time can get pretty long especially during the weekends. All the staff members are friendly and the overall service is good. If there is anything wrong with your dish, you can tell your server and they'll bring you a whole new one.  If you're planning to eat here or buy a gift card, now's the time! For every $25 gift card you buy, you get a free cheesecake slice during your visit between 12/26/11-3/31/12."
Alex T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",417,168,104,2.0,11/14/2010,"This cheesecake factory in Irvine is weak. Very weak. First of all, they have a ton of items on the menu ranging from American steaks to Chinese dishes? That's a big NO for a restaurant. Ask Gordon Ramsay.   Service: 45 mins for an entree. that's on a weekday. The waiters are very nice though, it's the cooks who are messing up the food. Food: my brother-in-law's chicken came out raw.How do you tell if it's raw? The chicken is hard and still got blood on the inside! that's how! He didn't complain but simply sent it back. The manager came to apologize but that's another 45 min wait for it to come back out. Price: I'd rather go to Marche Moderne for the same price. 2 stars for the cheescake and the nice waiters. I like other cheesecake factories though, like the one in sherman oaks or san gabriel but not returning to this one for sure."
Nicole K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",141,33,5,2.0,12/27/2014,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory last night..pretty terrible experience. I have never had a bad experience here until last night. We went in to put our name on the wait list, we had a party of 8. The hostess told us that we needed to wait off to the side so her manager could do a walk around of the restaurant to find out how long our wait would be . So we waited and he said 20-30 minutes which was fine but the he told us we had a two hour maximum that we could be there for. This seemed a little silly seeing as how we were about to spend a pretty penny. When we got seated it was around 9:30 which was the time they said we would be waiting. We ordered our drinks which were good. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating, maybe a little slow but fine just the same. It took around 45 minutes for us to get our food after we ordered it and when it came out it was Ice cold. We all had the same issue but we were hungry and we had been there for over two hours any way. My boyfriend ordered a couple sides of ranch which came out with his burger but then one of our friends also decided to order some ranch. The person who brought our food told us that we needed to share the ranch and that it would take a while to get more which was kind of weird..my friend never got his ranch. We ate our food and went home but then this morning I got sick and I'm positive it was from the food. Probably won't eat here for a while especially for the price."
Christine W.,"Corona, CA",51,13,1,1.0,3/21/2013,"So the last time I gave a restaurant a bad review, I got a waitress fired...but because what I said prompted the owner to look into the waitress' service which ultimately led to his disapproval of her behavior. However, she wasn't going down without a fight so she ended up harassing me on yelp but the owner apologized to me and she eventually stopped. So, fingers crossed that it doesn't happen here.  I don't know if it's just the specific waiter that I had or perhaps the waiters mentally checked out because my bf and I went late, but the service was terrible. Firstly, I wanted to point out that for some reason, we got sat in the very back. I saw some empty tables on my way allllll the way to the back. I don't remember the waiter's name because he didn't care to get our attention or greet us when he came to our table. Every time that we interacted with him, I could tell he didn't give a flip what we had to say and he would walk away abruptly after we'd asked for something. And of course, no smiles. I get that it's no Nick and Stef's or Ruth's Chris but does it hurt to smile? The nice lady at the $5 ramen place near my house that I go to gives better service than this. I have nothing against cheesecake factorys. In fact, it used to be my favorite restaurant growing up. However, I have to comment on the fact that this particular Cheesecake just didn't have the same friendliness. At another Cheesecake, when I asked if I could take the delicious brown bread we all love home, the waitress boxed it up for me and gave me an extra fresh one still warm. This guy over here tin foiled my half brown bread along with the white bread, and threw it in our to-go bag.  Sigh, it was just disappointing to not be given good service. It was a special day for me! I know that I can't judge because it's just one server but don't you think they should make sure that every server gives excellent service to every customer? It's important to remember that every customer counts and that every customer has family and friends and could be a potential regular. Oh, and the food was really greasy. Or at least the pasta was. Don't order a pasta dish unless you're splurging. In which case, I ordered the farfalle, which was not bad. But a dining experience is not complete without excellent service or it really kills the mood for all of us involved."
Jason M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",53,142,35,4.0,9/30/2013,"Bar is open seating! They have a nice outside patio with heaters! I love the Tuscan Chicken on the Skinnylicious menu. It is full of flavor lots of food and under 500 calories. I tried the Kale Salad here and I was not a fan. I believe they use some type of ranch dressing in it. The Grilled Artichokes are delicous, and melt in your mouth. The only gripe I have is when water is ordered always be sure to offer a straw. Not just here but many places I go I have to request a straw a minimum of 2 times prior to actully getting it. Why would you deliver coke and tea with sraws but not water. If I did not have to request the staw twice I would have rated this a 5 star. Other than that good job!!!"
Michelle L.,"San Mateo, CA",1,29,13,4.0,3/24/2015,"Food was awesome. Manager was very accommodating for our large group of 20 on a Saturday night. Both waitresses were very good. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars, is because I knew they had a Skinny-licious menu, but they weren't given to us with the regular menu. Realizing this, I asked for a skinny-licious menu. The manager brought over a few, but said he didn't have enough of them for the entire table.  A majority of my group had already ordered, but didn't have the opportunity to order from a healthier menu, because they didn't get the menus in time. I suggest that you print out a lot more skinny-licious menus, so that your customers can feel satisified eating wonderful food, without all the sodium and calories. Thanks again and see you next time."
