Mooki x.,"Irvine, CA",0,332,2,3.0,3/22/2015,"Pretty standard.  Not sure the server knew what she was doing.  'Forgot' things a lot.  She was nice but I don't think she was all there.  Food was pretty standard.  Make sure you check your bill when you go.  We asked for the bill, which I think she forgot to give us for a long time.  When we got the bill, luckily we checked it because she gave us the wrong bill!  It wouldn't have been bad, but our whole visit was a bunch of 'forgots'.  A little surprising since it is in a very busy location.  Hopefully she was just having a bad day."
Annika Jo L.,"Charlotte, NC",75,131,38,3.0,10/6/2013,"What can I say? Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. Despite an annoyingly large and extensive menu, the food is reliable. We can always count on CF for a good slice of cheesecake to take home for dessert. They're always super accommodating when it comes to kids and strollers too. They always bring out a plate of sliced bananas and sliced bread for the kiddo as soon as they seat us. CF isn't anything mind blowing but it is reliable and that goes a long way when I don't feel like trying the latest new restaurant and potentially having mediocre food and bad service."
Scott M.,"Corona Del Mar, CA",27,255,5,3.0,11/16/2011,"What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory? I can say I like it and I might like it better if the lines weren't 45-60 minutes most of the time. If I knew I could make reservations or wait no more than 10 minutes it would be an okay place to go with friends because the menu is so varied everyone can get what they want, Italian, American comfort food, etc. But it is also that varied menu that is a major drawback of TCF. You can't really execute like ten pages of menu items and do a great job on all or maybe even most of them. And when you are trying to appeal to a broad audience you don't take chances on bold and innovative flavors, you play it pretty safe. What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory? I can say I like it, but don't love it, liked it better when it first opened in Beverly Hills and I wish they would cut out half the menu, settle on about 7 entrees to do really well and have 3 nightly specials based on bold, brash flavors and what they can source locally at that location so that the specials at the Irvine TCF would be completely different from the Honolulu TCF or even the Pasadena TCF."
Katie T.,"Placentia, CA",2,15,2,1.0,2/16/2014,Two words FOOD POISONING. I decided to eat here on valentines day and now I am more sick then ever!!! I spent the last two days have been the absolute worst experience for me. I will NEVER eat here again!!!
Addy C.,"Irvine, CA",325,23,2,5.0,10/25/2011,"Oh my gosh. I have to say I just LOVE, LOVE Cheesecake Factory, especially this one.  First of all, it has a very nice environment for family events or for a date. Got a long line? Well, it's okay it's conveniently located at Irvine Spectruct, so just walk around. The buzzer actually detects pretty far, so don't worry. I usually get pasta at Cheesecake (I LOVE pasta) and out of all the pasta I've tried, my favorite are Pasta Da Vinci. It is because it's just perfect for me! I love the sauce and everything in the pasta. Best of all, after I'm done eating, I don't feel disguested or guilty. Another favorite of mine is the cajun jambalaya pasta. SO GOOD! I've had some friends who complain that Cheesecake is on the pricer side, but if you share with someone, it's not that bad. One plate of pasta will usually fill 2 people too. And if you're still hungry after that....there's always desserts! Out of all the amazing cheesecake, I love the Godiva one! So rich and delicious!"
Connie C.,"Fullerton, CA",27,162,50,3.0,10/19/2011,"I came here to catch some dinner with my girl friend. FOOD: The bread they serve in the beginning is warm, soft, and so delicious! But of course e ordered the spicy chipotle pasta & she ordered some steak with mashed potatoes & veggies.. I forget what it was called. But the pasta was very tasty, but I just wish they gave me more sauce.. My friend really like her meal as well. We both enjoyed it, it was very good.. and large portions. SERVICE: She was nice, and some what..... attentive. We had to flag her down sometimes. But one thing that threw me off was.. we asked for the check, then she goes would you like to try our cheesecake blahblah, and we're like oh no we're full.. and then she goes oh then would you like to try out other cakes? then we say.. no we're full.... can we get the check? and literally, she asks oh then would you like some espresso? Are you serious now? Me and my friend were just like what are you doing???????? We just wanted our check cos we're full and we already said we didn't want any desserts and she just kept going and going. I don't know why she couldn't get that in her head the first time. I'll be back, but I really don't want to be served by her next time lol."
Sepi G.,"Cologne, Germany",103,161,107,4.0,8/6/2013,"For Orange County standards where most known restaurants are chains, this is one of the better ones. Try the Thai Lettuce Wraps  it's one of my favorite dishes. Typically fantastic service and a lot of food for a great price. Good date night location."
J N.,"Irvine, CA",0,21,1,4.0,1/28/2014,"I eat here regularly and its always a pleasure, food is always great even when its so busy. Over all great, their food choice is gurenteed to suits all tastes."
J. F.,"Orange County, CA",134,10,,2.0,2/22/2015,"Service is slow at best. Food was either bland or over-seasoned. Hostess crammed our party of 7 into a 6 person booth, as we were leaving another large party (of 8) was sat at a much larger table which was available when we were seated but told was unavailable."
Allyson M.,"Seattle, WA",189,669,394,3.0,12/14/2008,"Food is 3 stars, but cheesecake is off the charts!!! This is a fatty's paradise (Fatty in a ""I like food, but I'm skinny, so I can eat all I want"" way... Not saying that it's the place for those who love food and it shows). The portions are pretty huge, although you can get lunch-sized portions until 5 PM.  The menu is quite extensive. It would take many years to try every dish on the menu. I must say that while none of the entrees I've tried are above excellent, I must say I f-ing LOVE the Avocado Eggrolls. If you enjoy the sweet taste of avocado and the crispiness of deep-fried pastry wrappers, then this is the appetizer for you! We often come here just for the cheesecake, though. You can't go wrong with the original. We recently tried the 30th anniversary cheesecake, which was decadent and just totally awesome!!! Since this location is located in the Spectrum, don't come here hungry on a Friday night. The wait is horrendous."
Michelle S.,"Orange County, CA",35,6,2,3.0,10/30/2011,"Summary: Okay food, service (though friendly) is slow, what's with the flies??, cheesecake is good as always. I would have given it a 2 except for the cheesecakes. This location has a special memory for my husband and I since it was one of our first places to visit together as a couple. So when we decided to go on a VERY rare date without the kids, we ended up here. We came a bit before the dinner crowd so we were seated really quickly. I'm used to standing in line for the Cheesecake Factory. The hostess actually took us past empty tables next to the window and seated us right next to the bathroom entrance. ???? I'm not sure if she was doing a waiter/waitress a favor by placing us in their area, but I definitely asked her to seat us next to the several window seats that were open. The waitress promptly showed up and offered us bread and drinks, so we munched on that while we decided on food. My husband commented that his menu needed to be cleaned. I have often found their menus a bit greasy, but I have a thing about clean menus. I decided on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp Thai dish with white rice. My husband decided on the crab cake sandwich. We were planning on trying each other's food.  I hadn't read everything in detail and missed that toasted coconut topped the dish, so I had missed telling my waitress that I wanted it on the side. I don't prefer coconut over my rice dishes. They were very nice about replacing it though my husband had already tasted it.  Service was a bit slow as soon as the dinner ""rush"" started. I had asked for a cup of decaf coffee, but the waitress had forgotten, so the hostess that came by to ask if I had gotten my replacement dish had to get it herself. (I think it took about another 20 minutes for my replacement Bang Bang dish to come.) I wasn't expecting a great thai dish at the CF, so considering that, it was decent. It tasted more like alfredo sauce with a bit of curry in it, but it did hit the spot that was craving Asian food. There wasn't much meat in it, and a few of the chicken pieces were tough and dry. However, the few shrimp that I did have tasted pretty good. My husband said his crab cake sandwich was pretty good, but he liked better the Bang Bang dish WITH the coconut on top. As for dessert, we ended up getting their new Reeses peanut butter cup choco cake cheesecake with the layers of salted caramel. It was good but VERY thick. I don't think I'll order it again as I like more of their lighter and fluffier cheesecakes like the tiramisu or tuxedo cream. My husband loves Reeses peanut butter cups and salted caramel so he was in love with it. Oh yeah... flies. I'm not sure what was going on, but there were 3 flies that were hanging all over our window. My husband ended up shooing one away and killing another. It was disgusting. And as we were leaving another fly just croaked right on to our table. I was so glad it was when we were leaving and not when we had food on the table. I noticed that the place wasn't as full as it used to be even on a Thursday night. My husband thought that it was because it was on a week night, but I remember having to wait for tables even on week days. I hope this place isn't going out of business like so many SoCal restaurants."
Nikki P.,"Orange, CA",171,118,21,4.0,9/15/2013,"First visit to this location and I was very pleased with it. First impression was not that good though. The hostess did not great us. She didn't even ask us how many. She assumed that it was just two, picked up two menus, and requested that we follow her. Boo... Very bad customer service on her part. Our waitress however, was very friendly. Our beer took forever to get there though. Food was good. Waitress came to check up on us a few times to see how everything was. I would say that I'll be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory."
Tejas M.,"Anaheim, CA",300,298,51,3.0,3/12/2012,"We went here for a family dinner on Sunday evening.  Luckily, we did not have to wait and got seated quickly!  Food and services were good too. Somehow, we had ended up at their development office first as that was the address pulled out by wife!  Wish they can block such other office locations from popping up under restaurants! Also, the link listed udner the ANNOUNCEMENTS section here in Yelp isn't working..."
Lindsay H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",37,92,1,3.0,12/13/2012,"Food is always good but seating is a pain (they should have built it larger) and there is always a wait unless you are there right when they open. The heavy volume brings on the sub-par, hit and miss service."
KEITH S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",5,30,,2.0,11/28/2013,"Service was slow. The salad wilted. The waiters helpful when around (small lunch time crowd, not busy). The drinks watery. Both he toilet paper in the ladies room and the toilet seat liners, non-existent."
Paul L.,"Irvine, CA",730,418,1098,2.0,9/9/2010,"About three years ago, I wrote a review of The Cheesecake Factory that began with the following sentence: ""The Cheesecake Factory just blows."" Three years later, I pretty much feel the same way. But since I had a gift certificate, I decided to give this place another shot. If nothing else, at least the cheesecake would be good, right? Dinner started off well. I have always been a fan of their bread basket -- warm sourdough and pumpernickel -- and could have eaten the entire thing. But sadly that is where the good food ended. Upon our server's recommendation, I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, which came with Coleslaw and Fries. Big mistake! The pork tasted like it had been braised instead of smoked (ZERO smoke flavor) and the sauce was so cloying sweet that it could have been served for dessert. I tend to like my pulled pork Carolina style, which uses a vinegar-based sauce, but this sauce was very tropical; it was loaded down with pineapple, mangos, and fruit punch. Great for a smoothie, maybe, but not for BBQ.  The Crabcake Sandwich was a little better, but still missed the mark in terms of flavor and texture. The crab did not taste very fresh, and really needed an acid to brighten it up, and the patty was kind of mushy. To be honest, the best thing about the sandwich was the brioche bun. Both sandwiches went unfinished, hoping that the cheesecake would really deliver. Sadly, and to be honest quite surprisingly, it didn't. We disregarded our server's recommendations (fool me once) and ordered instead the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, which has layers of cheesecake, fudge cake and chocolate truffle cream. As a dessert, it was fine, but you couldn't even taste the cheesecake! All you tasted was chocolate, so overwhelmed was the cheesecake. For a place that has the word ""cheesecake"" in its name, you would think that the cheesecake flavor would be front and center. So three years later, my impressions of The Cheesecake Factory have not changed. Lesson learned, again. The only thing bums me out now is that I still have money left on my gift card but have absolutely no desire to return. 1 1/2 stars"
Eric D.,"Orange, CA",0,31,3,4.0,1/3/2014,"Ok, dont judge. Sometimes you end up at the Cheesecake Factory.   I like the skinny menu and enjoyed the Asian lettuce wraps, the grilled artichoke and the basil flatbread.   Each thing under 500 calories.  So it's OK to order 5 things off of it for dinner right?"
Richard B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",148,829,3,3.0,5/14/2011,"This restaurant chain packs on the calories, with an expansive menu heavy on American, Asian and Italian style ""mall food"" linked to the notion we are building a super race of fat idiots.  I would be down on this concept even more if it did not actually taste great. So be warned: the portions are huge, 1,200 to 3,000 calories, more than you will likely need for a week, not a night out on the town.  The cheesecake should put your heart over the cliff like a bad horse stunt in a Western.  With that said, you can eat on the lighter side of the menu, which sports wonderful appetizers such as Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which is my go-to meal.  BTW: The Irvine location has a wonderful patio, perfect for the summer."
Eddy K.,"Buena Park, CA",0,3,1,1.0,4/11/2013,"Today, I took my family to the Cheesecake factory in Irvine spectrum for lunch.  We sat on a booth right next to window and ordered foods.  Our server was 50's and only a old women among the servers.  She seemed not happy serving our table at first sight.  Since she took our order, she brought the food and THAT WAS IT!!!  We were out of water and napkins but she just passed our table several times without any looking.  She had NEVER stopped by or asked if we needed anything.  NOT even one time!!   She was NOT absolutely busy.  If she was, I would definitely understand cuz I used to work as a waiter.  She even took our plates without asking any word.  My wife was still working on her plate, and the old server tried to take it away while my wife turned her head to my son and not looked at the food.  I should raised my hands and made her stop taking the plate.  OMG, I could not believe this happened at my favorite Cheesecake Factory.  Is she out of mind??  She seemed she was in need of money and THAT'S IT!!  She had no service mind at all.  I really wondered why she was there and what she was doing there..    Only a word that I heard from her since I walked in the restaurant was ""Have a good afternoon"" with NO smile when she brought me a check!!  I wished to just get the hell out of there without any tip but left average amount.  Her service was not even worth a CENT.. Before I left, I tried to leave a comment regarding her bad attitude and terrible service but unfortunately there was none of such a comment card.  I just told the manager, ""It was the WORST service I ever had in my life"". If you go the Cheesecake factory and see she's coming to your table, you better change your seat to other server.  Otherwise, you would be pissed off!!!"
F. S.,"San Diego, CA",1,27,6,1.0,3/28/2013,"Horrible experience there today.  Waited over an hour to be seated, then our waiter was rude. I asked for the manager in hopes to help resolve the problem I was having with our waiter and he was even worse. Mike, the manager did not show proper management skills nor did he make his customers happy. I will not be going back to this restaurant. I would rathet travel the distance and go to the one in san Diego."
