Julie L.,"Brea, CA",2336,456,640,3.0,7/7/2010,"My first impression was, ""The first and then only Cheesecake location I've been too."" It works coincidently, but every time I go for The Cheesecake Factory, it's been this one at Irvine Spectrum. It's a pretty pricey restaurant for pasta, but the decor, delightful service, and large amounts make it worth it. Really, their portions are HUGE so be cautious when each person in your party orders their own dish. My friends and I usually go family-style on this one and just order one dish from beginning to end: drinks, an appetizer, main dish, and cheesecake for dessert and just share everything. That way, we can have a little of everything! In terms of chain restaurants, Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites. Good pasta dishes are the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, and Cajun Jambalya Pasta. The lasting impression? ""When you want to go chain with a bit of class, go cheesecake."""
Lida K.,"Irvine, CA",126,216,9,3.0,2/15/2011,"Standard Cheesecake Factory. After reading what others have written I can understand that why they're saying that in comparison to other Cheesecake Factory...you actually get service! Woot.  Read my Anaheim review if you want to read what the standard experience is like.  But for the most part this place is your standard Cheesecake Factory.  Butter slathered, agoraphobia inducing, loud, overpriced, but you knew what you were getting yourself into experience. Drinks were decent pours and the pasta was a little overcooked for my personal taste but overall it's good and predictable =] And sometimes, that's exactly what hits the spot. BTW Fried Macaroni Balls...ughhhhh yaeeeessss....MOARRRR"
Kay A.,"Dana Point, CA",179,368,376,3.0,4/12/2011,"I'm actually embarrassed to write about this place, however, we were not able to get into Javier's. Sorry no offense to this place but I just try not to eat at big chains. I don't think I've eaten here since 2004! S and I shared the avocado egg rolls and bang bang chicken. The egg rolls were big and fat and stuffed with avocado, so that's a plus, but I wasn't a fan of the egg roll wrapper. I was secretly hoping for the crispier rice paper. We shared the chicken & shrimp curry dish on white rice. It was good but I didn't like that the shrimp shell was still on. Yes, it's very soft so you could actually eat it, but I am a baby and didnt' want to! Service was umm...okay...waitress kinda weird but I guess she was busy. Not my usual type of place so I probably won't be back for awhile...unless I don't get a table at Javier's again..."
Suzanne M.,"Kapolei, HI",152,156,142,4.0,6/11/2011,"Went for appetizers and drinks. Food was yummy.  My daughter and I shared Greek salad, stuffed mushrooms, ahi something, firecracker salmon and artichoke hearts.  The ahi something wasn't all that.  I liked the stuffed mushroom and Greek salad.  The strawberry martinis are the best!  The worst part is the waiting for a table and there isn't a HH or if there is I always miss it because it's soooo frictin crowded.   Best time to go is during the week.  Atmosphere is very different then."
Nicole A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",64,21,3,2.0,11/25/2013,"Extremely slow service, order incorrect, and sketchy customers which made the experience uncomfortable. Food is mediocre and for the time we waited it should've been spectacular. A good friend graciously gave us a gift card otherwise we don't patronize this establishment on a regular basis"
Jomamma H.,"Riverside, CA",39,75,24,1.0,10/18/2010,"Dear Manager? Christopher I think? You know who you are.  After my husband and friends husband landed a bar top last busy Saturday night a waiter offered a booth. Like good husbands they accepted and us ladies joined them. After about 7-8 min. of patience we began to wonder about having our order taken. We only came for dessert and drinks.  Then the ""manager"" came and told us we had to leave. ?? I'm sorry what? It's not like we looked like some teenagers that swiped a table. We were able to tell them which waiter gave us the table and he couldn't care less. Didn't even offer us another place to sit.  When we asked for the real manager we were given a pager. I kid you not.  No Mr. Cheesecake we are no longer interested in giving you our business, we wanted to get your name and maybe you would take the opportunity to redeem yourself with some actual HOSPITALITY.  I was not a big fan of this chain before and this experience reminded why. If you like to be treated like cattle, enjoy. If you can, go somewhere else."
Terry H.,"Irvine, CA",7,58,10,4.0,7/7/2011,You can't beat the extensive selection available here.  Tried their pasta carbonara for the first time and now I'm hooked. Sooo good!  It even heated up well the next day. We often enjoy this restaurant for family dinners.  Can't be beat.
Cat Q.,"Irvine, CA",536,537,1489,3.0,8/16/2011,"Good service. Long waiting list. Food is just OKAY. what's with the slippery floor, the most restaurants on Spectrum have this slippery floor thing going on.  It seems I am not the only one with that problem.  Food is just okay,  food court styled dish in a better looking environment. Godiva cheese cake is the best. Chocolate cake is a killer, too big to eat. It's a entree, not a dessert.   I am not a huge fan of them, but I am okay with their food.  once a while, when you don't want to cook, when you have enough of healthy food, when you run out of the idea where to eat, when you are too tired to view the Yelp reviews, when you are just done with Spectrum shopping center, You can just go there. It won't disappoint you too much."
Steve P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",66,68,29,4.0,11/10/2013,The food was really good. The service was a little spotty. Although she was very nice. Maybe she was just very busy. Timing is everything!
Geeyoung L.,"Irvine, CA",60,243,451,3.0,5/7/2013,"The spicy chipotle chicken pasta is pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of the other foods. I tried their four cheese pasta, salads, burgers, steak and eggs, burrito but they weren't that good. The cheesecakes are yummy though."
gene d.,"Irvine, CA",301,360,143,3.0,6/1/2010,"Came here for lunch last week and luckily we beat the lunch crowd.  And guessing from all the patrons in business attire, this location gets a good share of traffic from the nearby offices during the week. Anyways, I ordered the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta.  As I waited for the food, I munched on fresh baked bread and my Arnold Palmer, which they use a tropical tea.  The drink was just okay just because I'm not used to drinking lemonade blended with tropical teas.  But the bread was good. The food took forever, especially considering its lunch time and you'd expect faster turnover so patrons can have time to eat.  But no, I guess they were skinning the chicken and bringing my shrimp direct from the sea with the time it took them. When the food finally arrived, all the bread was gone and I had licked all the crumbs.  The aroma from all the spices blending with the tender chicken and firm yet juicy shrimp was divine.  The sauce wasn't overly spicy and was just right.  The bed of noodle (mixed spinach & plain linguini) was really good, but afterwards I think it would have been better if I'd opted for rice.  Not only would the rice soak up all the juices, unlike the noodles, but also with rice the chances of me splattering little red dots of juice all over my dress shirt would be considerably less. All in all, food was 4 stars, but the delayed service time was 3 (sorry CF)"
Adam H.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,15,4,3.0,8/28/2013,"I went here a couple of times in my life, I loved the avocado roles they are my favorite but the problem was last time i ordered the egg rolls, they told me they ran out,but overall it was  a pretty relaxing area"
Tiffany O.,"Anaheim, CA",73,34,1,4.0,7/9/2013,"Come on, who is not a fan? They have a bazillion items on the menu to choose from, there cocktails are great and more importantly the cheesecake. I do have to recommend the Miso salmon, so fantastic and light. There are other items that are great on the menu too, but I really like this one and I am getting my omega's which is super important to stay fit and healthy."
Chloe C.,"Santa Monica, CA",200,542,91,3.0,2/15/2011,"Previously known for their MASSIVE portions, my boyfriend and I came here for Valentines Day because we were fortunate enough to get a giftcard from AMEX and thought we'd give this place a go! What seemed like EONS ago, I came here with my family for my birthday (probably like 5 years ago) and they had HUGE portions and there were BIG baskets of bread.... Not anymore :( It's not that my appetite increased, and everything looks small to me now, but this place has shrunken their size. Probably to combat American obesity? Well to begin, I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken and my boyfriend ordered some bbq burger. We began our meal with yummy and soft bread. Then our food came soon after (decent service for Valentines Day) and my food, obviously, was super greasy because I'm pretty sure the sauce was butter based. The vegetables in the pasta was pretty soft and their chicken was battered and pan fried, not what I was expecting, but it wasn't dry! yay! Overall, my entree was mediocre. My boyfriend's burger came with A LOT of fries, they were o.k.! And he seemed to like his burger, it smelled good! And it didn't seem that greasy! We finished the meal with the traditional cheesecake with strawberries and a side of fudge sauce, now that was good! It was light and fluffy but super rich and delicious, all at the same time. Fresh strawberries and yummy, thick and WARM fudge sauce. I thought this place was overpriced and just ok, the ambiance was nice, however."
Adam M.,"Irvine, CA",13,36,6,3.0,5/18/2011,Husband says:Gross. Way too much butter in every meal. (2 stars) Wife says: Loved it! (4 stars) :)
Nelson D.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,39,1,2.0,1/11/2014,"Food and service are average. The gripe is the archaic pager system. Wouldn't be a big deal if you could leave their restaurant while waiting. But you can't. And if it's crowded you're left standing around in a crowded wait area with no where to sit.  most other restaurants in the spectrum will take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, allowing you to walk around while you wait."
Joanna R.,"Anaheim, CA",18,4,2,4.0,6/12/2013,"This is always the go-to place when I can't figure out what I'm in the mood for or what to eat...  Huge selection, decent prices."
Krystal R.,"Anaheim, CA",209,188,198,4.0,7/30/2010,"Yesterday, my sister and I participated in the early celebration of a National Cheesecake Day. Being facebook groupies and social media fans we got a coupon for any slice of cheesecake for $1.50 - but the catch was to dine-in and to enjoy your slice of cake there. Not a problem!  We had been wanting to check out the new cheesecake to join the family - the Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The other cheesecake we enjoyed was the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. The Reese's cheesecake was overbearing of peanut butter goodness. If you're a peanut butter lover, and truly love everything Reese's Piece's this slice of cheesecake is perfect for you. It had a nice layer of chocolate cake on the bottom, Reese's cheesecake on the following layer, a heavy layer of caramel, and more Reese's cheesecake, then another layer of chocolate, and more cheesecake.. It's a gigantic slice of everything Reece's if you ask me. After trying it out, I thought it needed a hint of more chocolate and the caramel layer in the middle was a little too much...but seriously it never hurts to taste a cheesecake from here. All the cheesecakes are pretty fabulous - I've enjoyed many of the candy-themed cheesecakes. But one of my recent favorites is the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake - it's just a beautiful melody of chocolate cake and cheesecake. Classic and simple and perfect for any chocolate lovers out there.  Today is National Cheesecake Day, so if you dine-in today, you get any slice of cheesecake for half the price. Fight the lines and keep your kitchen clean by enjoying a nice slice of cheesecake today!"
Jon N.,"Garden Grove, CA",225,548,58,3.0,3/8/2009,"I've eaten at this location several times over the last couple of years and I've never became a fan of this place.  For some reason I'm always dragged here by my friends and I always try to order something cheap on the menu because I frankly don't enjoy the food here that much. The wait is long during weekends, service is alright, and the food is seemly overpriced.. especially the cheesecake.  I guess if you're a guy going on a date with a girl it's an alright place to take her.. something mainstream and clean.  But if it's your girlfriend or wife there are much better and interesting places to eat around Irvine for much much cheaper."
Maria H.,"Orange County, CA",1160,193,83,2.0,3/5/2010,"This is about my last choice in restaurants. I've been there two times by invitation. Had their pasta, potato, some sort of pizza, desserts, and more. Pasta was grossly oily and I just left it there as is was. The rest were just OK and edible I should say.  Our serves were both goofing around and rarely checked our table and messed up our order once.... Luckily I didn't have to deal with it as I was just a guest there :-)  I don't think I would ever go there by choice, but I always see there is a long line there on weekend nights which is hard to believe."
