Cynthia A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",464,718,330,4.0,4/1/2010,"Normally I'm not a fan of the Cheesecake factory because I don't really like their food.  Love their ambiance though. Met a friend here for lunch the other day.  Our waitress, Maureen, was super nice and funny, added a nice touch to our meal.   They have really decently priced lunch specials at CF and large portions.  My friend had a $12 dollar pasta lunch special and it looked like a full portion of food!  Very hefty she barely made a dent in it!  They also have the basic soup, salad or sandwich combos.  They've really been improving on the variety of different foods on their menu, not just your basic sandwiches, meatloaf, etc I'll def come back here for their lunch specials!   And of course, I had to top the meal off with red velvet cheesecake!! so good! They also have a new one that has mango or something, for next time!"
Shelly N.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,4.0,12/16/2013,"The cheesecake factory always has something for everyone, their wine selection is better than average and what you can find at comparable places, and the cheesecake is to die for - my fav is the chocolate chip and cookie dough!!"
Stephen C.,"Torrance, CA",0,92,,5.0,8/4/2013,We both had their combo steak Diane with crusted salmon. It was excellent. Both the steak and salmon were moist and delicious. Ate on the patio which was very nice on a great SoCal day.
Jd H.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,24,,5.0,5/7/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory in general, my favorite restaurant by far. The one in Irvine is one of my favorites. The service is always excellent and the quality of the food is consistently high. The wait times are typically long to get seated but it is too be expected as it is the Cheesecake Factory which is very popular. If you get the chance to go I don't think you will be disappointed!"
Lisa T.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,325,88,3.0,1/6/2011,"Good is generally good here, but the menu is so large I have the hardest time trying to figure out what to eat.... and the menu is so confusing! I don't ever remember what I ordered last time... food isn't memorable.  Service was excellent though when I ate here with a group of six during lunch!"
Kimberly T.,"Irvine, CA",97,63,1,3.0,1/27/2011,"We came early during a week night, so the restaurant wasn't as packed as it would be on a friday or saturday night.  Our hostess took us to the back of the restaurant, passing by several empty booths and seated us at a little table in between 2 others.  I asked her if we could be seated at the booth and she replied ""that will take longer.""  well why would it take longer?? Our waiter was courteous and brought us the bread in a timely manner.  I ordered the crispy crab wontons and farfelle chicken mushroom pasta.  In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a bit overpriced, I mean, $15 burgers? $12 salads? Anyway, it's a nice place once in awhile, good place to socialize with friends or clients."
Robert Y.,"Redlands, CA",4,65,22,4.0,10/29/2012,As a vegetarian you have quite a few selections that will make you salivate.  It is funny that most of them are in the appetizer section.  The crispy artichoke hearts are the must.  The quesadilla was very good with chilis inside.  The avocado egg rolls are too much to handle.  Got to eat your french country salad with goat cheese.  Make sure you order your olive oil and balsamic vineger to go with your bread and salad.  High monounsaturated oil diet will make you lose weight.
Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1070,875,388,3.0,11/15/2008,"It is what it is. I've been to this location a handful of times because usually there's a long wait and it's just not worth it. Today, however, there were a ton of people waiting around at 6 on a Saturday, and since there were only two of us, I decided to try.  Only a 10-15 minute wait! And the buzzer went off within that promised timeframe.  We were seated waaaay in the back, in the rotunda end of the restaurant. The new thing I noticed was a ""special"" menu that was handed separately from the book they give you. It was strange because it wasn't like ""limited specials"" or ""specials of the day"" so I have no idea what it was about, but it seemed more reasonably priced.  I decided to go with the tomato basil pasta, which was $11.95 and consisted of grilled chicken, pesto sauce, penne pasta, tomatoes, basil all tossed in olive oil. It was actually really good, and since I scarfed down two loaves of bread, I ended up taking about 75% of it home. Yay, lunch tomorrow!"
Bridgette R.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,30,,2.0,8/23/2011,"Eww. I don't get what the fuss is. They serve like everything and it's gross and greasy and somehow manages to be tasteless. The cheescake's decent, but sometimes, depending on when you get it, tastes a little dry and older. I'll say the servers are nice, but they kinda half to be cause the food sucks. The price doesn't help."
Sandy N.,"Santa Monica, CA",171,242,175,3.0,12/31/2010,"Went here recently to get together with some high school friends. They always have a consistent selection of pretty good American food. Some of it is a bit pricey but if you go for lunch there are lunch portions (and prices) for some of the items which is nice. The cheesecake is always good, as well as the rye bread. Portions are huge. Some of my favorite dishes: avocado egg rolls, bistro shrimp pasta, chicken madiera, miso salmon. It's a really high quality chain.. I think it doesn't stand out in my head just because I sort of outgrew it. The biggest con is mostly that the line is always so long at this location."
Ossy B.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",0,13,,5.0,7/29/2013,"Beautiful Place!!!  great food, good prices, very nice people work there, their time on the food is perfect ! you order appetizer and when you finish they bring the salad or soup next your meal..  they always very busy but always do the best. for the customer Love this place !"
Monica N.,"Alhambra, CA",395,673,443,4.0,4/9/2007,"Standing outside the Cheesecake at the Irvine Spectrum with a friend I watched the multitudes of OCers stroll around on a Saturday night. Monica: I'm hungry, when will our table be ready? OC Friend: As soon as most of our group is here.  Monica: What's good here? OC Friend: (surprised) You've never been to the Cheesecake Factory? Monica: No, I don't really eat at most chain restaurants. OC Friend: (puzzled) oh.  Thus summarizing why I don't like Orange County.  It seems as though everything is commercialized and marketed for mass appeal. I was at the Spectrum though, so I can't really expect to find local unique mom & pop type cuisine.   However, I did award The Cheesecake Factory 4 stars. The food was fine, and considering I was dining with a party of 15 we were seated without delay and received good service.  I was amused that their laminated and spiral bound menu was so thick not just because they offer so much variety but because every other page featured full page advertisements for tanning salons, plastic surgery and real estate.  You know, all the basics for survival in the OC. :) I didn't have cheesecake."
Jim G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12,29,,2.0,7/18/2013,Poor service during meal.  Took family there for middle son's birthday.  When food arrived I asked for another round of drinks and some additional items.  None were ever delivered.  I didn't eat as I needed the additional items to be able to eat my food and after a few minutes everyone else quiet eating.  Couldn't get our waitress back to the table till 10 minutes after food was delivered and at that time the food was cold so we just asked for it all to be boxed up.  She said she was sorry she didn't get to our table earlier and didn't know why the person who delivered our food didn't follow up with the requests that we made.  All in all a ruined birthday.
Stacey C.,"Los Angeles, CA",259,352,135,4.0,11/1/2010,"Cheesecake is my FAVORITE chain sit down restaurant... whatever you order on the menu you just can't go wrong! Tasty & humongous! I always have a to-go box in hand when I leave this place.  My favorites are:  -Chicken Madeira  -Chicken & biscuits  -Salads  -Lettuce wraps  and for cheesecake, I ALWAYS get the banana creme cheesecake! YUMMMMMM!  Their bread is good, service is good. The ambiance is a little too dark for my taste... are they trying to get a romantic setting going on? I have no clue... the wait is LONG, so be prepared to wait or get there EARLY."
Kimberly R.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",17,3,,4.0,7/2/2010,"I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy.     I've been here a few times, and we always have excellent service.  Also, I love that it's very family friendly.  I was here recently with my daughter (1 yr old) and they offered us a ""baby plate.""  Nothing fancy, just some bread and bananas, but they brought it out right away.  This was awesome and kept my daughter happy until the real food got there."
Dave L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",294,31,14,4.0,5/17/2011,"You can't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is overwhelming at times because there are so many choices. Some things I have had: I love the pasta da Vinci.  Also tried the Thai chicken pasta. Not bad. The spicy cashew chicken tastes awesome too. I love too that they serve Coke Zero. Most places just have Diet Coke as an option. They also have lunch portions of many of their most popular dishes. the lunch portions are still substantial. And of course, the Cheesecake is awesome. Godiva Chocolate = 5 stars Chris's awesome cake - good but very little cheesecake and also has coconut in it which isn't my favorite."
Lisa D.,"Irvine, CA",120,140,163,3.0,4/10/2010,"Cheesecake factory! Oh CHEESECAKE FACTORY!  I guess i have a love & hate relationship with this place.  There's always a RIDICULOUS long wait everytime you go here. ANd they won't seat u unless everyone in your party there. Even if you make reservations for 15 friends, make sure you're all there!  My go to dish is the CHICKEN something... it comes with asparaugs & mash potatoes and it's my favoritest EVER!!!!! i'd eat it everyday if i could :-)"
Kelly T.,"Orange County, CA",0,78,101,4.0,6/15/2010,"As far as family-friendly chain restaurants go, Cheesecake Factory is one of the best, in my opinion. In fact, one of the reasons I like it is because it can be what you need it to be - from a family outing with kids, to a girls night out for cocktails. Other chains are not so adaptable. They have an extensive menu with all kinds of food on it, a large cocktail menu, and of course a large selection of different types of cheesecake.  My favorite thing about the menu is the fairly recent addition of a ""small plates"" section on their menu. Most of the items are $5 and there are some great choices like croquettes, bacon wrapped dates, small salads, and pizettes which are actually pretty big for their price.  The only things I DON'T like about the menu are all the advertisements, and also that there are a few ""lighter"" salads called ""Weight Management"". So if you want to order the lighter salad, you have to order the ""Weight Management Pear and Endive Salad"", and that's kind of embarassing to say. Even to just put the word ""Light"" in front of it would be better than ""Weight Management"" :) I've ordered cocktails a few times there, and they are usually a good size and strong. The bathroom has a good baby changing station in the large stall. I'm not sure about every Cheesecake Factory location, but at the Irvine Spectrum location I've noticed the floor is super slippery. Or maybe just certain shoes I wear catch air under them. I'm not sure what it is, but I do know I've almost eaten shit walking through that place, unless I'm wearing sneakers, so ladies be careful."
Sunny C.,"Irvine, CA",120,198,62,5.0,2/12/2013,Sunday Brunch menu is awesome.  Come early for their french toast.  It sells out fast.
JJ W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,28,5,5.0,5/8/2011,Yes they got five star for today's experience only  thanks to our wonderful server Christine. Not sure what her last name was but she was awesome. At some point i thought I was at some five star restaurant in Berverly Hills lol. My husband ordered a crab cake sandwich me I got a Thai chicken wrap and the usual for the boys: sliders and French fries.  We wrapped up our wonderful meals with some tiramisue cheesecake which was better than the best Sex on The beach ( I meant the drink):)- I told my husband to tip her 30 percent but the damn cheapo tipped her only 20 percent.. Which was weird bc she was a great server and also a hot blond too.:)- so why did I want to tip her more and I'm super straight? I highly recommend the crab cake sandwich and Thai chicken wrap.. Super yummy and light in calorie not sure if it was though... Looks can be deceiving .
