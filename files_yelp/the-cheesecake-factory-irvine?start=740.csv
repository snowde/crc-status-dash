Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729,3.0,10/2/2010,"Good place to come for bday dinners and get togethers.  I had calamari once and it didn't taste very fresh, so I always stay away from the appetizers.  The salads are soooo GOOD! Da Vinci is also really good. Portions are BIG. Prices are reasonable. Free bread to munch on while you wait.  Good service, can be a long wait.  Cheesecake slices are around 6.75-7ish, and are really sweet. I had the red velvet cheesecake and kinda got sick of it ( I didn't eat the whole thing).  I'd come here again... probably in another year or so when I'm forced to go."
Ryan M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",130,218,17,3.0,10/4/2010,"This is great place to get together with a group. The breadth of options on the menu means that everyone should find something they like. The quality and service are on-par with other Cheesecake Factory locations. My favorites: Santa Fe chicken salad (minus corn, beans and tortilla strips) and the Hibachi hanger steak (with tempura asparagus and wasabi mashed potatoes). Conveniently located next to valet service."
Andrew P.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,388,,4.0,3/7/2011,"Most of you know the drill for lunch/dinner, but the latest Nagasaki-calorie payload goodness comes from a serendipitous Mystery Guest assignment for Sunday Brunch. My Lord and all that He does right, like beer, soccer, music, great books, etc., do we have a winner with the breakfast version of the Monte Cristo sandwich. Eggs, bacon, ham, cheese on the powdered-sugar dusted French-toast bread?   This shall be my new church on Sundays, when we get the urge to massacre our cholesterol levels. And most of the time, the service is pretty good and they are kid-friendly; always a plus.   Get there by 11:30AM and no rush yet, no wait for a table."
Jay D.,"Irvine, CA",49,122,,3.0,4/22/2010,Normally a 4 or 5 star restaurant in my book - the Spectrum CF is lacking more often than not.   Service (on many visits) is mediocre and the management seems indifferent when it is brought up. Thus - 4.5 stars becomes 3.  Try Mission Viejo or Newport Beach.
T.T. T.,"San Francisco, CA",260,16,7,3.0,1/11/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is such a guilty pleasure for me, and despite what people say about eating at chain restaurants, I love it. I think Cheesecake Factory really anchors Irvine Spectrum and it's a great place for large groups. Today we went for lunch, and of course, our outings are nothing without our little dog. The staff was so accommodating and friendly and seated us right away next to heatlamps jut in case we were cold. Our server could have been more attentive I think but she was probably tending to other customers. The food was good as usual. We got the avocado egg rolls which were amazing and for the entree I got the chicken BLT which was pretty good but I was feeling sick so it wasn't the most enjoyable time. Other than that, the experience wasn't particularly stellar, or at least more pizzazzy than usual. Cheesecake is a reliable and pretty tasty restaurant that is sure to satisfy."
Rolando P.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,208,183,4.0,9/11/2010,"My co-worker likes coming here for lunch and if she pays, I too.   They have a lunch menu and of course the bread and cheesecake (vanilla bean)."
Raven G.,"London, United Kingdom",166,45,56,5.0,6/18/2012,"Love, love, love this place. Everything I've ever ordered is delicious. The avacado egg rolls. Goat cheese pizza. Any pasta. Banana Bavarian creme cheesecake is to die for. Strong drinks. I try to come here once a week."
Veronica C.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,4.0,11/9/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has amazing meals. We normally go to the Brea Cheesecake factory but happened to try the one at the Irvine Spectrum on  Sunday 11/8/15 after Church.We were seated by a very courteous young lady, but when our waitress/server arrived she had a terrible attitude the entire time.1) We asked for water with lemon in it. She brought back water with no lemon. 2) My Husband showed her a dirty spoon and she just took it without a word. 3) No apologies, or anything else i can get you, no smile at all. We seemed like a complete inconvenience to her. I wanted to tell the manager but my Husband said no....she'll know she had poor service by her tip. I caught her name tag which said Kimora was her name. It wasn't so much about us but I felt so sad for her poor attitude and I even prayed for her. We ordered the portabella mushrooms, fried avocado & fried zucchini which was delicious! My Husband ordered the Cajun Jambalaya & I ordered the Pasta with shrimp, sausage & basil which was cooked perfectly thanks to some awesome chefs. We will not let one poor attitude ruin one of our favorite places to eat."
Dee N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",1049,428,85,4.0,2/8/2010,"#299...almost done for the night... x_x Had a wonderful time here for my friend's b-day. Tried all kinds of appetizers and entrees--pizzettes and pastas...everything tasted great, and we all had a blast. (Margherita Pizette, Sausage & Ricotta Pizzette, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Pasta Carbonara, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, and a few others.) I wouldn't say the food (or service) was worthy of 5 stars, but a solid 4 star experience, definitely. Last but not least, our group purchased $70 worth of cheesecake slices to take home. :p"
Chandra H.,"Long Beach, CA",52,66,24,3.0,9/3/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a go to place for my friends and I when we can't decide what to eat. This time we made a pit stop for dinner and it was delicious. This particular restaurant has plentiful parking and absolutely no wait during the work week. I ordered the California Cheesesteak which could have used a little more meat and sauce, but it was still yummy. To top everything off we shared a slice of my favorite Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake for dessert. Is it just me or did everything I ordered have cheese in it? Next time I need to find a cheese themed drink and the whole meal would be complete!"
Caril W.,"Anaheim, CA",3,22,11,1.0,7/18/2014,"No stars because I had the worst dining experience ever at this location. My sister and I took my four year old daughter and my three teenage nieces to this location. Let me say I love the Cheescake factory in general. I have dined at many of their different locations across the country. However, I will never dine at the one in Irvine spectrum again. My sister's salmon was prepared poorly. Dry and tasteless. The other dishes were ok but the kicker was when the manager chased us across the outside courtyard to the valet and accused us of not paying our check. He later discovered that we paid and tipped quite well. Our server was gone from the table for over 40 minutes, so we found a hostess and paid our bill because we were ready to leave. The manager then runs out screaming and accusing us of not paying our bill. Once another person runs out to tell him he is wrong, he gives a sheepish grin and poor apology claiming ""we get all kind in here"". Really do me and my sister and four kids look like ""all kinds"" to you. I was appalled. I called their corporate office who assured me that this manager had completely defied protocol in that NO ONE should ever be chased out of a restaurant like that and be accused of such. I was not comforted. That manager needs to be retrained pronto!"
Choice P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1002,8,,1.0,8/10/2014,"Every experience up until yesterday has been flawless at this location. Party of 9 and 3 of us orders the tostada salad. One of them we ordered extra chicken. As it is... the salad is $15.00. With the extra chicken it has now turned into an $18.00 salad. The presentation was good as always but my 2 year old who we ordered chicken fingers for received more chicken on his plate then ALL 3 of us put together.  $48.00 for 3 heads of lettuce, REALLY? We complained to the waitress that there really was no chicken in any of the salads and she came back with... ""Each salad has 6oz of chicken in it.""  We told her there must of been a mistake and that there was NO WAY ours did. We aren't ones to complain on site and it was either me calling her a liar or us calling us liars. Never got the manager and didn't offer anything in return for out dissatisfaction for the service. We paid and left it alone but will never be back to this particular Cheesecake Factory again. So if you do go and you do order this salad... ask for the chicken on the side so you know you're not paying $15.00 for $0.59 head of lettuce. I'm in the food industry and this was handled terribly."
DOUGLAS K.,"Tustin, CA",0,31,4,2.0,4/4/2015,"Just experienced very bad service from the hostess to bus boy to waiter to expediter. Problem is Manager is too busy with Administrative duties instead of training and overseeing his Staff. A bunch of college students who just go through the motions and mingle at the resister and talk. First,  Hostess wants to put us in a booth that is literally, no kidding, three feet from the bath room door. Really? And, nice restaurant design. Are you kidding me? Next Waiter acts like he is close to his shift end so we hurry up and order at 3pm. Next, we politely ask the Expediter for some more sauce for the avocado rolls (since they only give you about two teaspoons) and she does not say a word and just nods. I thank her when she brings it back and, again, she does not say a word. Made me feel like my request, and her job, was an inconvenience to her. Next, we ask the Waiter for some bread. He says he has to wait until it comes out of the oven. Really? Sat afternoon and the Manager is not assuring the cooks to have enough bread ?? Next, as we are eating and finishing our meals, the Waiter comes by twice, the bus boys walk by twice empty handed until we finally have to wave down our waiter and ask him to remove the empty plates and glasses. He does get a bus tray, instead he tries to stack as many as possible and in the process spills sauce and crumbs all over the table. Do you think he comes back with a towel to wipe it up? Nope, he just comes back and gives us the bill and places the bill folder right in sauce. I ask him to please just bring me a towel and I'll clean it up for him. Worst service I have ever experienced. You get better service at McDonalds or Taco Bell. Three people and a bill for $138 with this bad of service? Sorry Cheesecake Factory and all other Irvine Company located Restaurants, I'm done."
Jordan P.,"Tustin, CA",42,606,194,4.0,12/6/2010,"Not bad for overpriced impersonal chain. But good place to come with some friends every once in a while. A big fan of their avocado rolls and the corn fritters! Tried the chipotle chicken pasta this time and it does have some bite which was surprisingly good to find out. The server was friendly enough and got the orders right, and was prompt. So not bad at all..."
Brandon N.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",7,22,1,4.0,2/27/2012,"Okay, I've heard some people talk about cheesecake factory complaining how it's expensive, and really, if you're going to come to a place like this, you shouldn't expect to be spending only five dollars. You get what you pay for, and for the price, you get some pretty nice quality food here.  Onto the food. I've been here with my girlfriend, and we get the Firecracker Salmon appetizer, which is pretty gosh darn good. I usually skimp on appetizers because I feel like, for the price, it's not worth it. (10 dollars an appetizer, 13 an entree, might as well get the entree right?) but this was a pretty nice exception. It was pretty great! Although the measly four pieces left much to be desired, and I craved more. The bread that they give as an appetizer is also pretty great. I love their honey wheat bread, with a light bit of butter in between, and even though I normally hate sourdough, it was pretty good here too.  As far as entree's are concerned, we ordered two entrees, the salmon filet and the jambalaya. We tried sharing to finish but frankly, two entrees is a HUGE amount of food. (Part of why you should expect that you're paying a lot). So we had planned to get cheesecake too, but honestly, we just had no room.  The cheesecake here is phenomenal though. I've tried the classic, the strawberry, the kahlua, and the red velvet. All of which are smooth and creamy and sweet. The perfect little dessert to cap off a great dinner. All in all, this place would make a great little lunch place or a fantastic dinner restaurant. The bill might be high in the end, but what do you expect?"
Tanda M.,"Los Angeles County, CA",134,437,102,3.0,9/10/2012,"Typical Cheesecake Factory at the Spectrum. Most times there is a wait to get a table. SOm prepare yourself, especially on weekends or late week. They close pretty late too. But, I think that has to do with the location and Irvine Company (who owns the land in which they operate). Otherwise, the set up is about the same as any other CF, the food is typical and the location is obviously convenient. The cheesecakes/desserts are always fresh and the appetizers tend to be better than the actual entrees...not sure why, but thats been my experience.  On my last note...The Red velvet Cheesecake...TO DIE FOR! You would be playing yourself to NOT get it when you go here!"
Vivienne L.,"Irvine, CA",90,80,5,2.0,12/25/2009,"Merry Christmas Everyone! I thought I should be nice and give them an extra star but I was disappointed not only in the service but in the food. We arrived at about 7PM and we sat down at about 7:45, the wait wasn't the problem but the method in which they decide to seat people.  OK, you walk in they give you a pager, that's all good; after your pager buzzes you think that you are about to be seated, think again then you are moved into the bar area where a server appears about 15 min. later yelling out your name searching for you in a room, not only packed with waiting customers but people at the bar already eating. This was complete confusion and chaos. Why not just buzz your pager and seat you!  We decide to sit at a table at the bar instead of being seated outside in the cold. The table still had cups and shot glasses from the previous customers, but we didn't care we were hungry. The cups and shot glasses were never cleared from our table and our server was obviously so flustered she barely got our orders right. We could see that by the expression on her face she couldn't wait for the night to be over, by this point we were feeling the same way.  Now the food... I ordered the cheeseburger, the meat was gross and chewy and the burger was cold as well. The only thing good was my banana cream cheesecake is was delish. Next time I want to try the red velvet cheesecake. This place is good for cheesecake and that's about it."
Amanda S.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2013,"Just ate here the other day. It was a weekday when I went so we were seated quickly. Our server was nice, except she walked away as soon as she finished taking our orders, getting our drinks, etc. I had to repeat myself multiple times and she STILL didn't hear me. We were seated by a register and I had to loudly yell ""Excuse me!"", in order to get her attention. Also, the bread was cold. We asked for more and it was STILL cold. I ordered a pasta dish, which I can't remember the name of, but it wasn't that great. (If it were great, wouldn't I remember the name of it?) This restaurant sucks compared to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Never coming back again."
George G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,73,1,2.0,8/30/2015,"Cheesecake Factory in general?  Usually fabulous.  Consistent good food, service with a smile, family friendly.  This location?  Not so much and I really don't understand why the service is sooooooo bad.  Takes forever to get your food, you might as well being a bottle of water with you because good luck getting a refill.  Apps and entrees always show up at the same despite PURPOSELY ordering time separately to avoid this.  What?!?!?!  This time we were brought to a table not even set up yet....""please stand here in the corner while he finishes.""  Bread crumbs all over the seat and the areas that were actually wiped were soaked.  The topper?  The waitress circles the suggested tipping amounts on the bill.  Here's a tip...learn how to take care of your customers.  Three times and it never got better.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere unless you are a glutton for punishment.  Maybe it was how bad the service was, or maybe it's how long it took for food to come out, but I didn't even feel it was as good as other locations.  The dynamite shrimp small plate wasn't even tossed in ""dynamite"" sauce, it was dry tempura shrimp.  Waitress looked at us like we were nuts.  Corporate really needs to address this place."
val a.,"Irvine, CA",8,42,50,4.0,9/30/2010,"Hey ,I know the food is great and all here but waiting to be seated  here is a bitch during the weekends. Don't come here during the rush hours. 1. You put your name down to be seated (10 mins wait ... not bad)  2. Your name is called, then you move into a staging area ( 10 mins) 3. You are seated."
