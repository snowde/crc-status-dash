Bill E.,"Orange, CA",98,166,21,3.0,9/30/2010,I have eaten at this location several times and it is stable. The food quality is pretty much the  same as other locations and the staff is decent. The problem with this location is that there are so many other restaurants to choose from. I usaully get the Jamacian Shrimp dish which I always enjoy. I think they should add more items to their menu though as there arent many choices on the different 30 pages.
Jason T.,"Garden Grove, CA",41,103,26,3.0,10/12/2009,"i probably would have rated it higher if i got something else, but i decided to splurge and get the 4-cheese pasta.. bad idea. haha the only other thing i ate that day was a homemade 3cheese egg quesadilla so the cheese was overwhelming! It hit my stomach like a brick. The service was adequate, courteous but a bit slow probably because of how crowded it was but im sure it is faster at other times.  Everyone seemed to like thier food and we ordered 3 different cheesecakes. I dont remember the names of them but i liked the chocolate one most.... im not a fan of a million flavors so i probably would have enjoyed just a regular one most. But of course we didnt get that one. haha"
Linda Y.,"Irvine, CA",371,549,21,4.0,1/19/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those places you never really crave but offer almost everything food you might want to eat that actually tastes consistently good so you eat there. Well, that's how I felt Friday night and I was pleasantly satisifed with my decision. The bread never fails to satisfy my carb craving although I wish the butter wouldn't come cold. I ordered the chicken di panna which was very decent! The chicken cutlets were pounded thin, covered in a light batter, and probably pan fried in butter on top of a mini puddle of white wine butter. The sides were perfectly cooked and seasoned broccoli and buttery mashed potatoes.  Oh and the cheesecake isn't too shabby either."
Eric B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",153,200,13,4.0,11/6/2009,"OK - here's a chain that really works. Built out to resemble, and like an upscale New York bakery cafe- The Cheesecake Factory gets packed early. Can you believe people are willing to wait 2 hours to eat...like, anywhere? Everything I have ever seen at my table has been god. One of my favorites is the firecracker salmon rolls on purple cabbage. God mixture of swet and spicy. Yes - the desserts are awesome - duh!"
Ryan B.,"West Covina, CA",34,172,,3.0,9/12/2010,"BEWARE.  This location has horrendous wait times.  That and the crazy parking and crowds detract from the experience. Once at your table, expect good service, we were always taken care of.  Cheesecake Factory has a crazy array of dishes, experiment and see which ones you like.  Some are tasty, others are misses.  Same with the cheesecakes, some are heavenly, but a few are much too sweet. Again, it's one of the few chains that I will visit on a regular basis.  That's high praise from myself."
Raina M.,"Las Vegas, NV",192,293,234,2.0,5/23/2010,"I love the Cheesecake Factory because they have THE BEST Miso Salmon and all of their cheesecakes are good!   But seriously, the employees who work the bakery/take out order counter really need to provide better customer service.   Scenario 1: Placed a take out order at the bakery counter.  After I paid, I asked the guy how long it would take.  He said 10-15 minutes.  Then he asked me if I would be waiting in the restaurant or if I was going step out and come back.  I told him I would just wait in the restaurant.  25 minutes have gone by, so I walk back up to the bakery counter to check on my order.  The manager who was standing there apparently knew who I was.  She said, ""oh right, you were the one with the take out order.  Your order somehow got lost in our system, so they are making it for you right now.""  Umm okay, so they knew that I was sitting there for 25 minutes and they couldn't come up to me and explain what happened?   Scenario 2:  Placed a take out order over the phone.  The lady who took the order told me that it would be ready for pick up in 20 minutes. I show up 20 minutes later and they can't find my order in the computer. Are you kidding me?? Again!?!?  So again, I had to wait a long time in the restaurant to get my order.   All I have to say is, keep note of what happened, complain to the right people, and they may give you something for free."
Payam A.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,18,,1.0,12/9/2014,"Really don't like leaving negative reviews but had to let you know what an unbelievably poor experience we had! We ordered our food and waited a long time. OK, it was a busy weekend night. When the food finally arrived, we had no silverware. We wanted to let our server know, but she was in a real rush and ran off before we could explain what we needed. After that we waved to her a couple more times, but she was too busy to respond. We waved down another server who came by and said he would make sure we got our silverware immdiately, but we never saw him again. We waved down a third server, but he said he would let our server know immediately and she was the one who had to take care of our table. We were very frustrated after around 10 minutes of this, my friend got up and walked to the serving station which was only three tables away from us and was confronted by a bus-boy. He was told to go and sit down as 'guests' were not allowed to take silverware or napkins, they had to be deliverd by an employee. He tapped the bus-boy on the shoulder and laughingly told him we had waited for over ten minutes. He was sternly told to sit at his table and they would be brought soon. He returned a little shaken up and surprised at the experience. Almost 4 minutes later, the cutlery arrived, and we finally got to eat our food, which by now of course, was quite cold. My friend asked for a whole lemon so that it would not squirt everywhere when he squeeze it for the juice, and was told he would have to pay extra for it. My friend was surprised and said that was not right. A few minutes later, the manager arrived. I thought, 'good, he found out about our cutlery problem and is here to apologize'. Well here was the real shocker! He began to shout at us, telling my friend if he wanted a whole lemon he had to pay extra and then he started shouting that my friend had no right to touch an employee, and every time my friend tried to explain, he was immediately and aggressively interrupted and shouted down by the manager. I could not believe what was happening. Then I tried to talk too and the manager kept shouting saying if we didn't like it, we could leave! We were both in absolute shock and disbelief at what was happening and how we were being treated. Everyone within several tables of us, was now staring in our direction and at the spectacle. Completely embarrased and publicly humiliated, my friend agreed to pay extra for the lemon and the manager left in a huff. Our server was very apologetic and said she had no idea he was going to react that way. We had completely lost our appetite and could not eat anymore. We had barely eaten any of our food, and when the lemon arrived with more apologies from our server we just asked for the bill and our waitress brought it quickly and just kept on apologizing. We had spent over $80 on food we hadn't eaten and had been treated worse than criminals! Guests sitting at the tables around us said they were shocked at how poorly we had been treated, and would never come to this restaurant again. Two other guests, came by as they were leaving and voiced the same thing. One said the manager was a real bully and should be fired for what he had done. We got out of there with a horrible sick feeling. It ruined my whole weekend. Couldn't get the stress and embarrasment out of my head. I wrote to their corporate offices to let them know everything is not alright with their Irvine Spectrum restaurant. Have no desire to ever visit any Cheesecake factory again! Just thinking of going there puts a horrible pit in my stomach."
Darryl T.,"Irvine, CA",23,17,5,2.0,3/3/2012,"I've frequented this restaurant many times, but the management has taken a turn for the worse. The cocktails are weak, at best. When I asked the manager about this, he condescendingly said ""We're not in the business of getting you drunk."" Suffice it to say I won't be ordering any alcoholic beverages from them again. At $10 a pop, they should alter one's mood more than iced tea. I received decent service, but management makes this a non-starter for me for return dining."
Aaron P.,"West Covina, CA",1,1,,4.0,2/14/2013,"Had an awesome dinner with my girlfriend tonight.   She got the seared Ahi tuna and I had the Filet Mignon.  The food is same as usual but we had an awesome waiter, his name was Brandon.   Very nice and came back from time to time to check on us to see if we needed anything and had some small talk with us.   Overall it was a great experience especially since we did not have to wait too long on Valentine's day."
Tina L.,"Newport Beach, CA",76,22,,5.0,9/21/2010,"Best cheesecakes ever!!   I was hooked on Stephanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake for the longest time.  When it first came out, the slices were enormous.  Maybe it was a promotional thing, because now that it's been out longer, the slices seem to have gotten smaller ...  Maybe it's better that they're smaller so you don't eat as much! Anyway, their Avocado Eggrolls are awesome!!  I usually get their Shepard's Pie, which is even better with Tabasco.  All their salads are excellent, especially their Chinese Chicken Salad - best plum sauce ever.  End dessert with Stephanie's Red Velvet Cheesecake.  You'll have no regrets."
William T.,"San Jose, CA",524,62,39,4.0,8/4/2010,"Went here for lunch with a friend of mine and the weirdest most friendly waiter served me and my friend. I felt like I was in France at a 5 Star restaurant. I actually felt a little weird.  I'm a regular at cheesecake and I love pretty much all their pasta. If you don't know what to order, just order any pasta with red sauce. I'm sure you'll like it =)  Ironically I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I never order cheesecake =X Haha!"
J W.,"Irvine, CA",0,32,,2.0,7/18/2014,"The quality of this place has gone down considerably since the last I was there. We arrived at 7pm and were seated in less than 10 min, so it wasn't bad. Server was nice and helpful. However, bread arrived microwaved. Ordered chicken Marsala and spicy chicken sandwich. Pasta was microwaved. Sandwich was called spicy chicken, but there was no spiciness. There was suppose to be buffalo sauce, I could barely see it, I certainly couldn't taste it. Instead, there was a cup of sauce on the side that was a mixture of blue cheese, sour cream, mayo etc. i think the sandwich missed the point of 'buffalo' and 'spicy' in its name. One slice of tomato with a some shredded lettuce on the side. The glam burger was not that glamorous. Wendy's spicy chicken burger tasted better than this! Microwaved food was totally unacceptable in a restaurant at this price level."
Michelle P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",26,10,2,4.0,11/17/2012,I love cheescake factory!! the food is amazing and of course the cheescake is amazing!! I have never been let down ever before until i started going to this location. Im a manager in a store in the irvine spectrum and my team and i and are always ordering food to go from this location and every time someone in our staff has a birthday we buy a cheescake to go for thier birthday. For some reason every time we order from this location our orders get messed up or completly forgotten all together or we get charged incorrectly. I have never had any issues with the dine in service here. Its only the to go orders.
Kathy S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,7,,2.0,8/11/2014,"My daughter wanted her 18th birthday dinner here.  We are from San Diego, and the rest of the family lives in L.A. County so we thought this would be a good half-way point to meet up.  The restaurant website says they can easily accommodate large parties so we sent out the invitations.  A week before the dinner, we tried to make a reservation for 26 (yeah, we have a large family).  We were told they do not accept reservations but if a member of our party came about an hour before we'd like to be seated, it shouldn't be a problem.  You can probably guess what happened... upon my daugher's arrival at 5:30, the manager denied any employee would have instructed us as they did (insinuating that she was lying), said they really aren't equipped to handle large parties (so why does their website say otherwise?) but they would do their best to accommodate us, and to come back in an hour to check on things.  She actually seemed annoyed that we had a large party.   LOOOONG story short (literally), the servers were attentive, the food was excellent, but don't go here if you're hungry, and definitely don't go here if you have a large party unless you're willing to wait several hours to be seated.  We were finally seated at 9:00.  Our extremely long wait was not even acknowledged when were eventually seated.  They DO NOT easily accommodate large parties and the message we received loud and clear was that they certainly do not welcome large parties, no matter what you're told over the phone and in spite of what their website states.   If we had just been told the truth when we called the week before, we would have had the time to make other arrangements with a restaurant better equipped to handle our party.  Perhaps the person answering the phone needs additional training and the restaurant website requires updating."
Rebekah D.,"Minneapolis, MN",25,9,6,4.0,3/8/2013,This was an amazing restaurant. The service was great! The food is a little pricey but well worth it. The portions are huge. I got the four cheese pasta and wasn't even able to eat 1/2 of it. The cheesecake was delicious! I will definitly go back when I can! =)
LiveAloha L.,"Cerritos, CA",0,4,,2.0,8/9/2014,We had a party of 25 for a special birthday party. We checked in around 5:30 and did not get seated until 8:50. The wait was not acceptable.  Luckily our servers were efficient and the food was pretty good. If it was not for that my rating for this location would be lower.
Tim S.,"Orange County, CA",71,140,9,3.0,4/18/2013,"This chain used to be the in thing like 20 years ago. Just more of the same ol same ol. Their cheesecakes are delish of course. My fave is the original with fresh strawberries. Ever since they got rid of their cajun ribeye, I havent been back for a real meal. Its a shame because a whole gang of us (party of 8) would get the cajun ribeye and just eat ourselves silly. Now our money goes to the competition."
Jeannie C.,"Orange County, CA",53,175,42,3.0,7/30/2009,"I used to love Cheesecake Factory and went there often; the portions and variety are great, however, ever since Yelp, it opened my eyes to an entire new world of food that I need to try.  Today, I was informed a slice of cheesecake is half off and if you choose their new Red Velvet cheesecake, 25 cents goes to a Hunger Foundation. Any way to assist in changing the world, I am definitely there.  We went here for happy hour and was surprised they had some pretty good bar menu items. The price ranges from $3.95 -$4.95. We ordered the avocado egg, Cuban sandwiches, Thai chicken wraps, and fried mac and cheese. I know, it sounds like a lot of food, but the bar menus are small portions so you can have a sample of almost everything if you wanted to. Everything was pretty good. We definitely filled up our tummies.  As I mentioned earlier, we came here because of the half off cheesecake today and we did order the Red Velvet. The Red Velvet was moist, silky and so heavenly. I was afraid it would be too sweet but it wasn't at all. It tasted like the red velvet cupcake at Sprinkles. YUM!  I hope they do this promotion again, I will definitely be back for some half off cheesecake. On a side note, it seems that this Cheesecake factory lowered their standards. My plate was a little dirty and I didn't get a water refill."
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,4.0,6/12/2010,"Happy Hour (4-6?) for house wine, beer on tap, and selected appetizers The pot stickers were delicious The salads are very good and large; my favorite is the Santa Fe with chicken, beans, corns, and tortilla strips The fish tacos are great. Favorite dessert is the mud pie. Brandon was great food server"
Christina O.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,3.0,7/31/2014,"I came here with my sister and a few friends. It was a little busy but we didn't have to wait that long for a table. The appetizers are a little overpriced for the small portions that they give but it was pretty good. Our waitress didn't give us much attention so the service could have been a little better. Overall, it was okay."
