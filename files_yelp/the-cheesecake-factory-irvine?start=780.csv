Dave M.,"Los Alamitos, CA",0,16,6,4.0,8/29/2012,"There are 2 dishes here you can't go wrong with and which also happen to be quite exceptional.  First, is the fried calamari appetizer.  In my opinion, they have the best around and I've generally stopped ordering it at other restaurants because I always end up comparing it to the Cheesecake Factory's version.   The second is the herb crusted salmon which comes with asparagus and the most delicious lemon sauce.   The flavors in this dish wouldn't be out of place in a five star restaurant.  Order these items followed by some cheesecake and you will not be disappointed.    Unfortunately the rest of their huge menu is mediocre.  I would like to see them slim down the menu and focus on making a few great dishes rather then several so-so dishes. The ambiance at this restaurant is pleasant and I'd recommend dining off of peak hours.   Head in on a weekday for dinner or lunch and things are a little less rowdy, and you get to appreciate the place a little more.  If you go on a weekend for dinner expect there to be huge crowds in the waiting area, lots of noise,  and a long wait---usually an hour plus.   As far as the seating itself goes I prefer the high tables in the bar area.  They are first come-first serve and this space feels more open than the regular dining area.  If you like eating outdoors they have a patio which is nice as well."
Paul A.,"Irvine, CA",700,105,63,3.0,4/25/2010,"See my review on the Cheesecake Factory in Newport Beach for more detail on food. I'm giving this location 3 stars because the wait is ALWAYS horrendous and the service is very slow...slower than at Newport. That aside, the food is pretty consistent with the other Cheesecake factories I've been to."
Tian H.,"Irvine, CA",316,21,19,4.0,5/18/2010,"Great place! I do admit that this place gets really crowded during weekends~ but if you put in the reservation and then walk around and then come back you will be just in time~ the seating is great because you can choose from booth, chair and table sitting, or outside patio~ it's quiet outside~ it does take a little time to order and wait for ur food~  but not if you have great friends with u to cache up with~ food is great~ but there are so many things to choose from~ we always go there for girls night out~"
Leif E.,"Fort Collins, CO",12,59,20,4.0,9/15/2012,Great food and love the patio. Typically very friendly and helpful staff. I have been to this location and the Mission Viejo restaurant many times over the last year and have not had any bad meals or experiences. The food is consistent and the portions can feed a small family...
Paul T.,"Lake Forest, CA",3,5,,1.0,5/17/2013,"Took my wife to the movies last night and stopped at the Cheesecake Factory for dinner around 5 o'clock.  We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and my wife had the steak Diane and I had a pasta dish. They brought us the artichoke appetizer and it was cut in quarters I was eating mine and my wife was eating part of hers when she stops suddenly and says I am through let's get out of here. I ask her what was wrong and she says lift up one of the leaves which I did and there was about an inch long caterpillar/worm partially cooked but still moving.  She wanted to leave immediately which I understood, but I convinced her to stay and called the waiter to remove the artichoke. A couple of minutes later the restaurant manager came by with a rather patronizing smile on his face and said sorry about that would you like another artichoke I'll remove this one from your bill.  No apologies, no embarrassment, no what can I do to turn this into a better evening for you, just that smile like it was really funny.  I said no to the artichoke and he was gone. I didn't want our dinner comped nor did we ask, but a little offer of something like a slice of cheesecake for desert would have been nice touch or at least an apology neither of which we got.  I've eaten at this Cheesecake Factory at least 50 times but haven't been there lately and if this is the way the new management acts and treats it customers I won't be back.   In closing I work at and am one of the managers of a retail business and if I ever caught any of our managers acting like he thought a customers problem was a joke and didn't offer some sort or apology, try to find a solution to the problem, offer a small gift of appreciation, or something else to take the unpleasantness out of the situation he would be facing some serious customer satisfaction training or would be looking elsewhere for work."
David Y.,"Tustin, CA",3,14,,1.0,12/19/2011,"DO NOT EAT AT THIS CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!!! my wife ate there last night for dinner with her friends. about an hour and a half after she ate their food, she became very ill with food poisoning.  no joke, no lie.  dont risk it!! a friends wife work at a cheesecake factory and she even told me to not eat the that certain location....somewhere in pasadena."
Melissa R.,"Escondido, CA",63,67,7,3.0,6/2/2010,"Believe it or not, this was my first Cheesecake Factory experience! I know, I know, I need to get out more. Anyway, the place was beautiful inside! The decor was pretty cool. I found myself admiring the walls and paintings even as we were leaving. Very neat. We were seated quickly for a party of 7 adults and 3 kids. I don't even think we waited 5 minutes! Service was quick and efficient. Our server was very friendly. I was pretty happy with her. Their Roadside sliders were delicious! I had a Veggie garden salad with chicken which was gigantic, but it wasn't anything to write home about. The hubby had the fish tacos which had an excellent sauce. Kids had a kids cheese and pepperoni pizza which they ate but didn't really like the cheese. I thought they were being picky, but I tried it and I didn't like it either.  It was my brother's birthday so we asked for something special for him, and I think we all thought they would have something complimentary for him, but they took our dessert order (a mango cheesecake) and put Happy Birthday on that. We all shared it, which was the original plan, but we thought the birthday boy would get something just for him. Oh well. They also didn't have any crayons or coloring pages for the kiddos. Fortunately they were sweet little angels! :) Overall a decent experience. I'll definitely be back for more cheesecake!"
William M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",252,439,155,2.0,2/13/2010,"My Friends and I decided to have dinner here before seeing Jo Koy at the Improv.  This wouldn't have been my first choice, but I was out voted. 3 to 1.  The lobby was packed (you think they were handing out money or something), there was a line to put our name on the waiting list. We were told about 35 Min's. Our lil pager starts buzzing - we get up and head to the counter, they tell us to wait in the bar now. Ummm we had seats in the lobby! So the pager was only to move us to the stage 2 holding area.  50 Min's later were seated. We were ready to order since we asked for a menu while waiting. But our waiter was busy.  I felt like breakfast so I ordered the Spinach, Bacon, Mushroom Omelette's w/ potato's and English muffin. Got our food like 25 Min's later. My omelet did taste right, it was like they used eggs from a carton and not real eggs. The bacon was soggy and chewy, kinda like the bacon you get from McDonald's. I for one like my bacon crispy. The English muffin was good, as were the potato's.  Midway thru dinner I slipped my credit card to the waiter so he can get that done as we only had 30 Min's to finish our meal and get over to the improv. well he didn't. he waited til we were done, went thru the whole cheesecake menu. Dude I gave you my card early for a reason.  Ive never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory - its just an overpriced Marie Calendars in my opinion."
Tanya M.,"Irvine, CA",0,27,7,5.0,12/18/2012,Food is great. Good far the whole family and the menu is huge not to mention  the cheesecake!!!!
Allison P.,"Newport Beach, CA",164,221,59,5.0,2/1/2010,"I'm a creature of habit, I usually order one of any of these app's; Avocado Egg rolls, Fried Calamari, Tex Mex Egg rolls**. My favorite main dish to get is the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic Pasta, My friend always orders the BBQ Salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I have to say that ALL the flavors of cheesecake are great, I haven't tried ALL. You can never go wrong when choosing a cheesecake. hmmmm  This place can never disappoint me.  10/05/11  I came here last night with my friend Jing.  We arrived a little before 5pm and were seated fast.  I ordered my usual, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic Pasta. Delicious!  My friend ordered her usual, the BBQ Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  We both loved our meals, but were too full for Dessert."
Isabela F.,"Irvine, CA",1,21,,4.0,12/3/2012,"I'm a fan of the Cheesecake factory food. The portions are big and it's possible to share or even take home for another meal. I have pasta and chicken and they were both delicious!! The waitress we had was so nice, she talked to us, explained the specials but wasn't pushy. My friend had no idea what she wanted to eat, and the waitress was very patient in suggesting different dishes, asking for her preference in food etc. We were served pretty fast for a busy Saturday at lunch time, and there was space on the bar and the seating area, which was a surprise.  I recommend checking it out, and trying their specials."
RF G.,"Orange County, CA",103,207,51,5.0,1/7/2010,"This CF is located at the Irvine Spectrum Mall, and is extremely popular. Not too long ago, they added a second wing to double its size. BEEN THERE: Over the last ~10 years, I can't even count anymore. I go there with family, with friends, and for business. STAFF: Generally Friendly, although busy. The restaurant is very well staffed to deal with the high traffic. WAIT TIME: Expect to wait a lot during peak hours.  SERVICE: Good to Very Good most of the time. Once in a while Excellent, and very rarely Poor. MENU: Very broad range of selections, although mostly american, you will find Mexican and Asian selections. FOOD: I have tried too many dishes to even name, although I highly recommend: - Thai Lettuce Wraps (Appetizer) - Chinese Chicken Salad (warning it is huge, you can order the smaller lunch portion though) - Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp - Blackened Chicken Sandwich (relatively cheap and great) - Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak - Carne Asada Skirt Steak - Terriyaki Chicken (excellent quality) - Pasta with Meat Sauce (rivals some authentic Italian Bologneses!) Cheesecake Factory claims their Jambalaya is their most popular dish. I have tried it once. Tried it twice, just to be sure.... but I do not see the big deal? It's good, but there are so many other selections that are better (imo)...  AMBIANCE: Great ambiance, very well decorated, appropriate... nice outdoor patio that opens up to the Irvine Spectrum mall.  Cheesecake Factory is always my ""go to"" restaurant."
Amir A.,"Orange County, CA",193,44,29,3.0,10/26/2012,I was there on a Sat night and we know Saturday nights are the busiest nights for restaurant. I would say this place is just OKAY!
Rachel V.,"Riverside, CA",13,20,,2.0,1/27/2011,"A couple months ago my significant other and I decided to go buy a slice of cheesecake and therefore went to this Cheesecake Factory location since we were in close proximity. I ordered the slice (Key Lime Pie) and paid for it. I stepped out of the line as I was suppose to. I was expecting to get some form of call or waive allowing us to know that the order was ready. Several minutes after I paid we were waiting, waiting, and waiting... no call. Approximately 8 minutes passed and still no call or anything of that sort. I looked around me and saw other people waiting for (I'm assuming) an order as well. They looked confused as I did. Finally, after approximately 12 minutes I went in the line and waited another 6 minutes to be helped and I told the cashier (the same cashier that helped me earlier) that my order had not been taken into account. He asked me what I had ordered, and therefore I told him. Immediately, he handed me a small bag that was next to him all along (yes, I witnessed that bag since ""decades"" ago). I asked him, ""So, next time I order something from you guys (If I ever do) what do I have to do in order to receive my order in a timely manner? Do I have to go in line and ask for it myself?"" His answer was, ""Yes"". He had no expression on his face and made it obvious that I had to step aside in order for him to assist the next customer. Wow, what a pleasant experience, and what amazing customer service?! So... to my fellow Yelpers, if you ever decide to order an overpriced slice of cheesecake or an amazingly overpriced jelly from this Cheesecake Factory location - Go back in line AFTER you pay for your order, because apparently YOU make the estimate of when your order is ready for pick up (Yes, you need to make line twice. One to order/pay and the second to pick up, that is after your assumption of your order's completion). This is some advice from me (a kind person) for the purpose of saving you approximately 18 minutes of your experience at this Cheesecake Factory location. You're welcome.  I've attended other Cheesecake Factory locations and I have received great customer service, but this specific location was something-else that's for sure!"
Charlie C.,"Irvine, CA",333,410,347,3.0,11/30/2013,"After a little shopping spree at H&M I wanted to grab something to eat. I was thinking to myself I haven't been to the Factory in a while and decided to hop in for a bite at the bar. For today's late lunch or early dinner I went with the Ahi Tartar and the Mac n Cheese Cheese burger cooked rare. The Ahi tartar was okay. The tuna was chopped a bit too small for my liking. The dish included chunks of avocado, large wonton chips and some pickled ginger all stacked on a mini cylinder tower while laying in a pool of flavorful soy.  The Mac n Cheese cheese burger, I did not know what I was getting myself into. After finding out The Farmhouse Burger was taken off the menu I wanted a fun burger to eat, so I guess thats why I picked this one.  The burger included the normal fix-ens and a fried mac n cheese bite. I was pretty surprised that I enjoyed the burger. The patty was cooked to my liking, nice crust outside and nice and pink in the center. The toasted bun, crispy lettuce, crisp thin slice of onions and that crispy warm gooey cheese from the mac n cheese bite made it oh so wonderful. I seriously did enjoy every rich delishious bite."
Matthew T.,"Irvine, CA",3,21,,5.0,3/7/2009,"Hahaha, I have to laugh seeing how bad the reviews are for the Irvine Spectrum Cheesecake Factory when this is consistently the most crowded, most popular restaurant in the Spectrum. I could try to be one of the ""cool kids"" and pan Cheesecake in favor of the quirky, hidden away places, but let's face it: Cheesecake Factory dominates the restaurant business for some pretty good reasons. Their menu is large, has a lot of variety, and nearly all the choices are consistently good.  Cheesecake Factory pasta is better than most dedicated Italian food restaurants. Everything from their salads to their desserts is great, and while other restaurants might have them beat in some areas, no other place is strong is such a wide variety of kinds of food. The atmosphere is better than most alternatives, and the service is above average. The Spectrum location can probably hold on to some of the better talent in the area, though service can be inconsistent like anywhere else. As for the food, personal favorites are the Crabcake Sandwich, almost all of their Pastas, and the Strawberry Shortcake dessert. Another thing many people don't realize about Cheesecake Factory is that it is one of the few places you can go for breakfast, and probably the only nice place you can go for breakfast in the area. It also has additional breakfast choices on Sundays until 2pm. The bread here is good too, and considering the bread and large portions for entrées, even if you share an entrée, it can be difficult to save room for dessert."
Pauline P.,"Lake Forest, CA",9,21,,5.0,1/9/2011,"This review is for the Double Crunch Cheeseburger only. For as long as I can remember i've been either a vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, no beef meat, or whatever whatever. 9 out of ten times do I  ever order a burger with real meat. I am always ordering a veggie or garden burger. And, the times I have eaten a burger with real beef was probably 5 or more years ago. After eating this burger I did not regret it at all. It tasted so delicious. It had 2 layers of American and cheddar cheese, some sort of crunchy topping, secret sauce, and a huge and thick beef patty. SO GOOD. I almost cried after my first bite. And this was not because meat actually tastes delicious and I am crying just because I am missing out because usually after eating beef I am not digging it. But this time I was in love. So big and juicy and flavorful it's making me starve right now while I type this even though I just ate. This will be the only thing I will ever order form here from now on. Not only that but if it is so good that if I am ever craving a cheeseburger I won't just settle for any cheeseburger, I will come here  especially."
Albert J.,"Irvine, CA",23,32,,3.0,1/7/2010,"A group of us from church recently went to this location for a late lunch.  But it was just packed, which is not unusual.  Our waitress was very attentive to our group, but overall the food delivery was very slow.  Maybe it's because we had a large group. I haven't been to Cheesecake in a while, and the food was not as good as I remember.  The portions of food were still large.  We did indulge in some red velvet cheesecake at the end, and it was fantastic. Overall, it's what I expect from a franchise-type restaurant.  It's good to go once in a while, but it's not an absolute favorite."
Steven P.,"Irvine, CA",175,176,1,3.0,1/14/2009,I just ordered a lunch special : small veggie goat cheese pizza + side salad. The side salad was as big as my head! And I am told I have a large head. The pizza was good. The salad was okay. I would have gotten a cheesecake alas we only had an hour for lunch and were already 45 minutes over. Bit of a wait at all times. Now I want cheesecake. I will go after work.
Raymond S.,"Irvine, CA",337,192,30,3.0,1/22/2009,"For years, Cheesecake Factory has managed to be a tease to me.  The food is decent, but let's be real here - the whole point of coming here is for their decadent cheesecakes.  But how can you, when they give you so much food there's just no way you can possibly stomach room for dessert AND enjoy it?   Most of the time I have to order cake to go. Most of the food entrees I've eaten over the years here have been fine.  There's just nothing special in the flavor department to really highlight.  I do like my Pasta Da Vinci though.  It's just okay food blown to semi-ridiculous portions.  By the time the topic of dessert comes around, you have to ask the server, ""Are you JOKING?""  Yet, the thought of eating that soft yummy goodness called cheesecake only CF knows how to make, in dozens of flavors and varieties...oh man... But for years, there's been something that I've always - if reluctantly - wanted to know: Does Cheesecake Factory make their own cheesecakes fresh in their restaurants?  Knowing the dreaded answer already in my head, there's nothing more depressing than to hear firsthand from a waiter that NONE of the cheesecakes are baked fresh.  They're ALL shipped frozen; not even the basic cheesecakes! Talk about my hopes and dreams shattered.   It's like being told Santa doesn't exist (oops!).  Sigh... What's the point of coming here if I can buy the same cheesecakes available from Costco in the frozen isle?  Well variety for one thing.  Even if it's not made fresh from scratch it's still damn good enough to compel me to stop in and eat their food. Is that no surprise?  We're talking about one of the world's largest and most successful restaurant chains here.  That means a chain of this caliber isn't expected to blow you away with their food.  Just marvel away over their cheesecakes; their classy interior for an uncharacteristically non-classy restaurant; and their menus filled annoyingly with bourgeois-class advertising."
