Samara J.,"San Jose, CA",86,157,58,1.0,11/16/2016,The two things I expect when I go to a chain restaurant is consistency and cleanliness. This place was gross. The cups were dirty and none of them were matching. We sent one glass back because it had stuff floating in it. The waitress hardly came around even though the place was almost entirely empty.  My boyfriend's dad ordered a salad that had all wilted and yellowed greens. He did let the server know and they replaced it.
Nadia M.,"Bothell, WA",10,54,7,5.0,6/4/2017,"Great service and wonderful food. I recommend the California Whiskey Sour, it's really really good. Also, cheesecake, must have cheesecake... Came in with my mom who needs special accomodations due to her back problem. They kindly sat us at a table where she was comfortable, I really appreciate that. My only feedback would be to have more waiting area seating as the front desk can get really busy and elderly people like my mom can get very tired."
Audrey D.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,30,2,4.0,10/28/2017,"Taylor was one of the most friendly, genuine, and knowledgeable servers my boyfriend and I have encountered when out on a dinner date. He made great recommendations for us as the menu here is pretty extensive. Asian pear martini and whiskey smash drinks were recommended and proved to be very satisfying and delicious. We don't frequent Cheesecake Factory or chain restaurants too often so we appreciate the great service attention that is hard to find nowadays. Personal dessert favorite from here: original cheesecake with strawberry (one slice is perfect for 2 to share)"
Eugene L.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",232,8,,2.0,10/27/2017,"I don't expect exceptional service at Cheesecake Factory, that being said, I was very disappointed in my last visit. The food was very consistent to previous visits, so this review does not pertain to the chefs or any of the backroom staff. This review is about my server in particular. My server, his name started with an ""S"" and he was Persian, seemed very disinterested in my table. It was not a particularly busy night I could tell since he spent a significant amount of time chatting up another table all while ignoring mine. Overall, this particular server really hurt my experience and failed to meet my already substandard expectations."
Maggie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3683,2700,11555,3.0,10/2/2016,Happy hour with my girlfriend @ Irvine Spectrum. We shared tamale cake and banana cream cheesecake. The tamale cake was ok and the cheesecake was not as good as its usual banana cream cheesecake. 3 stars!! The Cheesecake Factory is almost yummylicious!!
Yesenia C.,"Anaheim, CA",12,8,6,3.0,6/2/2017,"The food itself was pretty good. It was my first time and the service was okay, they took long to bring our food and it was practically cold when we got it. Other than that i liked the service our waiter provided so I guess that makes up for it since he was very polite."
Karen C.,"Orange County, CA",385,363,440,4.0,10/11/2016,"My twin brother and I decided on this place to go celebrate our Birthday with our family! Our experience here was wonderful. When we walked in we were seated immediately by the bar area next to a window, which was nice because we were people watching.  The lights at this location were very dim that my parents weren't able to read the menu. Our waiter was nice. My family decided on ordering the Hibachi Steak and I opted for the Chicken Garlic Noodles. The plate servings are huge, so if you get full fast either share or take some back home for the next day. My pasta tasted good and filled me up rather quickly. However, I did notice that the bottom of my plate was oily. I tried a piece of the Hibachi steak and that tasted amazing ! Next time I would definitely have to come back and try that. Towards the end our waiter brought out one ice cream with one candle and gave it to my brother who was furthest away from him and had to go in front of me to hand it to him. He then told him happy birthday then I think he remembered it was my birthday too and looked at me and said happy birthday to you too. It was really awkward because it was this small one scoop ice cream with one candle and a bunch of whip cream. We both blew out our 1 candle and he walked away. I was like way to make me feel special. That was the only disappointing thing of the night."
Ken T.,"Irvine, CA",113,22,9,1.0,4/21/2017,"They told me there's a one hour wait time and gave me one of those fancy pagers.  I waited over an hour then decided to check with them.  They gave me a perfect explanation of why my pager never rang......they sat another party under our name.  It still doesn't explain why my pager never rang.  They called the manager over and he said sorry and promised to seat us next.  We waited another 20 minutes before we were seated.  More apologies but no discount.....no free drinks for screwing up our night.   For the price, the food was sad.  I don't know why we bothered to come."
Zar N.,"Orange County, CA",29,154,25,4.0,10/4/2017,They don't take reservations. My friends and I walked in around 11:30am sat and the place is still empty. Got busy after 12. The waiter is very nice. The food was excellent. The only problem I have is they used to have tuna carpaccio as an appetizer but not anymore. 4 stars because the restrooms need attention. Almost slip and fall carrying baby in the restroom. Water on the floor.
Roger H.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,40,1,4.0,9/28/2017,The pasta here is delicious. I recommend getting the Michaelangelo pasta- very tasta with lots of flavors
Yessenia O.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,3,8,4.0,7/31/2017,"Came to enjoy some Cheesecake here with family for National Cheesecake Day. All Cheesecakes here are amazingly delicious! Staff is nice, and is constantly checking-up for any assistance. Parking can be a hassle sometimes, but overall, is pretty fair. We arrived at about 2:00pm, so the wait was very little. Overall, great place to catch-up with friends and family while enjoying a yummy dessert!"
Richard D.,"Felton, CA",11,13,5,5.0,3/13/2017,This was great service and food was great. For sure 5 stars. Had a waitress named Ashley and she was so friendly and made me feel like I had known her forever. Everything she recommended was very good. This girl needs a BIG raise. She is a big plus for that cheese factory. GREAT JOB ASHLEY!!!
Miss T.,"Glendale, CA",1,169,289,4.0,5/15/2017,Favorite location to come to sit in the bar and service is fast and all the staff is on top of there game! Food is always great here!
Kelly N.,"Orange County, CA",128,353,2087,3.0,8/25/2016,"Came here for happy hour and there was no wait. We ordered crab & artichoke dip, chicken sliders, ahi tartare, beef dip and spaghetti from kid's menu. The portions were huge. Chicken sliders came in fours and looked like regular size chicken sandwiches. Crab & artichoke dip was delish and portion was big. Ahi tartare was ok and nothing really special. Beef dip was juicy and tender. The spaghetti from the kids menu was surprisingly tasty and was the portion of regular size pasta dish. By looking at it, I wouldn't have guess it was from a kids menu."
Elizabeth S.,"Tustin, CA",1,1,,1.0,12/18/2017,"If I could give this location zero stars, I would.  I had high hopes at the start of our evening, as we didn't have to wait long to be seated. However, once seated we waited nearly 20 minutes before anyone stopped at our table to offer us water. We finally had a server arrive who apologized and stated that there was a mix up in servers assigned to our table. We ordered an appetizer and our entrees. Our appetizer finally makes it to our table and we meet our new server. Nothing against our new server, David, as he did his best to provide great customer service. After an hour of waiting patiently, our entrees finally arrive. Unfortunately, there was a mix up in the kitchen with one of our entrees, lack of sauce for the rest and an incompetent manager that brought us to the worse dinner experience ever at a Cheesecake Factory. After an additional 30 minute wait on the corrected entree, our server apologized yet again and said he would send the manager over to help address not only the service provided or lack thereof as well as issues with our entrees. The manager arrives at our table and only addresses our friend who encountered the entree issue. She leaves without bothering to ask the table how everyone's dinner was and overall experience was. Shall I add, this manager Jamie Mattera does not provide an introduction. I only learned of her name when I asked for Cheesecake Factory's corporate number. Not once does she ask what she can do to resolve the obvious. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location, as not only was the service poor but the food was not the normal quality you receive at a Cheesecake Factory. I believe this is a direct reflection on the manager."
Sagiv L.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,4.0,10/6/2017,"Amazing steak, I enjoyed every bite. Varied menu. And nice service. Highly recommend. Put it on the top of my options to go eat."
Lara K.,"Newport Beach, CA",8,29,1,2.0,2/21/2017,"I don't eat at Cheesecake all that often, but I do get nostalgic cravings every now again for the Avocado Egg Rolls. Today, Feb 21, 2017 we dinned in for lunch because I had a Free Slice of Cheesecake to redeem. Sadly, I rather lost my appetite within the first 30 seconds of being seated as there was extreme dirt and grim everywhere I looked.  Essentially the restaurant is not getting any deep cleanings. No one is wiping the edge of the table booth benches and mountains of dried up food was plastered to the bench just under my hamstrings behind my knees.  Additionally, the top of the black granite baseboards are not being wiped down and had layers of dust on them.  While the waiter was friendly enough he had dirt and grime under his fingernails. The bread was served near cold and a bit hard which was disappointing as I love the sourdough baguette bread. The Avocado Egg Rolls were just OK, not quite as good as they could have been. I went to the restroom and saw the restroom door plate covered in fingerprint smudges, but thankfully I am tall and always push on doors high up, around the 6ft mark. In the bathroom I entered a stall to which I had to become a contortionist to even close the door and since I am slender I can't help but wonder how larger people get in and out of the stalls. Personally I don't allow my clothing to ever tough the toilet bowl but it's a very tight space and requires agile movements to not rub up against the stall and bowl. There was toilet paper on the floor and the toilet flushed before I was done, with its auto-flush. As I exited the stall I observed 3 Cheesecake employees enter the bathroom. It appeared they were tidying up the sink area but to my amazement they left a wet paper towel sitting in the center basin. Then a young girl went into the stall I'd been in and with her bare hands picked up the toilet paper from the floor. That might have been great had she washed her hands before exiting the bathroom but she didn't and all I could think about is where she was headed next.  After lunch, up at the Cheesecake counter I ordered two slices of cheesecake to go. The counter area was also dusty but by this stage I had to stop looking at all the dirt. I also informed the cashier that I did not need a bag. Apparently she didn't understand what I meant and asked me something about the plastic containers so I tried to clarify that I didn't need a carry bag and so she pulled out a plastic carry bag and said one of these as if she still wasn't clear on the issue and I said yes, I have my own carry bag so I don't need to waste more plastic and she just gave me a look of disdain, as if I was some weirdo. She also told me she would let me know when the order was ready and it seemed as if she wanted me to leave the bakery area and go wait somewhere else but there was no one behind me so I stood at the cake front. Next thing I noticed is she was packaging the wrong slice of cake. So I asked her if that was our order and let her know it was the wrong cake. It's fine to make mistakes, we are all human but her attitude was abrasive and she was not friendly or personable at all.  In the end I won't be eating again at this location because of how unbelievably dirty it was. I know the guys that bus the tables work really hard but unfortunately management is not ensuring proper cleaning methods of the tables, benches, chairs, baseboards, countertops, etc."
Marc N.,"La Palma, CA",188,135,110,1.0,1/28/2017,"Came in for just drinks and an appetizer before we catch a movie.   So we sit at the bar and wait 5 minutes before someone says anything to us.  Granted the bartender was by herself and a pretty full bar area.   So another 15 minutes go by and still nothing.  Bartender tells manager she needs help and the manager looks confused and say what do you need help with and then walks away.   We ended up going across the way at Paul Martin and got some drinks. Granted it was 3pm on a Friday, but come on and pull your head out."
Sarah S.,"Irvine, CA",2,4,5,1.0,1/20/2017,"The food is always fantastic but their customer service and attitude is extremely disrespectful and rude. I called an order for pick up and was put on hold for 7 minutes (4 pm, not a busy time at all). When I went to pick up my order the lady behind the counter pretty much threw my order at me saying ""here's your food"" and walked away. I was appalled and said ""that was rude"" but she ignored me. They messed up my order and I had to come back to get them to fix it.  Worst customer service I've ever experienced and would drive to Newport Beach for their Cheesecake Factory any day."
Frances J.,"Tustin, CA",137,78,4,5.0,2/10/2017,"My coworkers and I came here today for lunch to celebrate, as my manager put it, that I am ""with child"". :D Our waiter was extremely attentive and refilled our waters often. He gave recommendations and patiently answered all our questions. And the food was amazing! For appetizers, we got the fried macaroni and cheese balls, fried cauliflower, and spinach and artichoke dip. A table full of meat-eaters (except for me) all enjoyed these vegetarian appetizers. There was so much flavor! I got the four cheese pasta after seeing others recommend it on Yelp, and was not disappointed!  :) Other entrees ordered that were enjoyed included: The Cajun Jambalaya (perfect amount of spice), Vegan Cobb salad (lots of flavor but my coworker felt it needed salt), and the Tomato Basil Pasta with chicken. We all got Cheesecake, and the Strawberries with Whipped cream. Truly a great dining experience! I don't remember Cheesecake Factory tasting this good before. Definitely worth the price, especially if you are celebrating a special occasion like we did. :)"
