Amy D.,"Irvine, CA",12,47,13,5.0,7/24/2011,"Ordered the brioche breakfast sandwich, the brioche bread nicely trumps this sandwich and makes it the best breakfast sandwich I ever had."
mac h.,"Orange, CA",4,12,2,2.0,1/21/2009,"Everything I hate about chain restaurants..  they even put ads on the menu!  What?  Ads?  Really?  Ads?  While I'm looking at your menu?  Where is your flair?  You need 11 pieces of flair!   Is this the most corporatized restaurant chain ever?  Everything on the menu is exactly the same: decent.  It's not gonna disappoint, but it won't wow you.  I am dragged here once a year and only remember when the food arrives that it's just well made cafeteria food.  They take the flavors from all the dishes on the menu and mix it in a big vat and put it on everything, nothing is spicy, there are no strong flavors, there is nothing interesting here.  It's a safe boring choice.   Perfect for Irvine at the Spectrum.  The safest menu in the safest city.   Plus one for the cheesecake, the best thing here."
MK D.,"Burlingame, CA",59,1986,1591,3.0,3/4/2009,"Before the SF Bay Area had built any Cheesecake Factory restaurants, this Irvine branch was the first time I ever tried their food.  My then-bf at the time (1998) lived in Orange County so we'd frequent the Irvine Spectrum often. He took me here for dinners and I liked the novelty of having to sample different cheesecakes.  Their skirt steak was memorable but some other dishes were afterthoughts. It was the first time to ever see such a grand booklet menu like Cheesecake Factory, page by page, to get lost in.  I loved the Tuxedo cheesecake and it was my default dessert every time.  It's been over 10 years now but for some reason, this location will always stand out as one of my special memories."
Amy W.,"Orange, CA",0,2,4,1.0,9/8/2014,"Worst experience ever!!! Came here Saturday night around 830 with a friend, waited about 15 minutes. Server Megan took forever to greet our table, when she finally came over we just ordered water. Brought our water about 5 minutes later and took our order, salmon for my friend and basil pasta for me. We also asked for straws.  15 minutes later, our food arrived(still didn't get straws) we ask the food runner for some and he brings them right away. My pasta was hard and undercooked. Had to flag down our server, who only had 4 tables. She wasn't sure what I wanted, told her I wanted my pasta refired, she gave me some attitude and took it back. New pasta finally comes out and it was cooked better but there is no chicken. Again had to flag her down and she thought I was lying when I said I have no chicken and took my pasta to check herself. I asked her for a side of chicken finally came out and the chicken was robbery and tasted like it was in the microwave. By this time we just want to leave, we had enough of her attitude and snarky remarks. We asked for our check and a manager who we never got, guessing she never went to tell one a table wanted to speak with them. When we are walking out I stopped to manager and told him what had happened he was apologetic but that was it. This is the last time we'll ever be back to this cheesecake factory"
Jeff S.,"Tustin, CA",34,22,,3.0,4/28/2012,"Went to Irvine Spectrum location with my wife on a Saturday night around 7:30 pm.  Waited approx. 30 mins. For table --- not bad.  Seated on heated patio just as it cooled down that night, very ""toasty"".  Tables set up very close to each other but servers seemed to working well with set up.  Server almost forgot wife's glass of wine and she had to remind him to bring it out.  Food arrived promptly after ordering but before wine.  I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich and it has never failed to be a great choice.  Wife had the Mexican Chicken Salad off the ""Skinnylicious"" menu and enjoyed it.  Refills of my soft drink came at a good pace.  Believe it or not, we did not have cheesecake.  I would recommend ths location, just be careful what day and time you go."
Tara L.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,17,4,3.0,4/20/2012,"I eat here all the time.  The wait can get pretty long depending on how big your party is.  On a Friday night, any party bigger than 3 or 4 will probably be looking at 30 minutes at least.  That wouldn't be so horrible for a Friday night, but the waiting area is sooooo small!  You struggle to find a place to stand so you're not in the way of people waiting in line to put their name in.  Chaos.   The food itself is good.  I always get the Chinese Chicken Salad.  It's gigantic.  And it should be for $13.99.  I've also tried the Americana Burger, Skinnylicious lettuce wrap tacos, white cheddar soup, and a few other items.  All of them were worth eating again. Overall, I really like the food from here, I just get annoyed by how difficult it is to get seated and served.  Not for the impatient or the absolutely starving."
Troy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1041,827,183,3.0,11/12/2008,"So a friend of mine invites me here to celebrate his birthday with about 20 other people. I figure with such a large group, I'd call anothe friend who works for the company. And he helps me secure a table for the group and tells me who to ask for when we arrive.   I arrived later, and asked the hostess to speak to the guy. She then tells me there's no manager by that name. She then says he might have worked there in the past.   She then tells me she's incorrect and he just left.  And to make it more interesting, she said ""Oh, do you mean so-n-so?""  I said yes.   How damn hard is it to know the names of the frickin managers who work there?????"
Melissa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",308,538,11,3.0,9/22/2008,"Everybody wants to hate on successful chain restaurants-- especially Yelpers, who like to consider themselves ""foodies"". Honestly though? The Cheesecake Factory is pretty damn good! We got outta here with a dinner for two for under $45 with alcohol and tip, and that's nothing to shake a stick at. I had pasta, he had a sandwich, and we left happy. We passed on cheesecake this time, but there will be other occasions. We'll definitely be back-- at the Spectrum, there isn't much better than this-- but everyone needs to lay off the Haterade!! Yeah, it's a chain restaurant, who gives? It's supply and demand, bros, if you don't like it eat somewhere else!"
Jason T.,"Westminster, CA",1,20,,3.0,2/22/2014,"This place is all right... Nothing special. The fact that you can't make reservations is really a dealbreaker. They do a good job of trying to look like a classy restaurant, but it's pretty much a facade. Food is overpriced for the amount you get and how satisfying it is. With a little searching, you can definitely find a better american restaurant that's actually classy and worth your money."
L L.,"Toronto, Canada",10,24,,4.0,3/20/2009,"The food here is just traditional american food. Nothing that stands out but it's good food none the less if that's what your looking for. The price could be a little lower if you ask me. There is one dish that I always have and cannot never find anywhere else, it's the Chicken Madiera. Very very yummy. The sauce does it all! The Cakes are also AMAZING. I always go back for the Chocolate tower truffle cake. All the other cheesecakes are also amazing."
George B.,"Torrance, CA",241,331,530,1.0,8/24/2009,"FOOD POISONING?  Possibly I came here with my friends on 8/22/09 around 1pm.  I had not eaten anything throughout the morning.  I ordered the soup of the day.  I can't recall what soup it was but i was in the mood for soup since I was not too hungry.   About two hours later, i began to feel very tired and my temperature was rising.  By 8pm, i found myself throwing up in the toilet with a headache, high fever, diarrhea (ewww) and an aching back.  I was able to fully recover by the end of the next day. So what caused my illness?   It had to be the soup of the day..."
Lauren C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",25,15,,1.0,12/4/2010,"My husband and I frequently enjoy lunch at The Yard House in the Irvine Spectrum.  Today, we ventured there as usual only to find they weren't open until 1:00 because they were hosting a special event....much to our dismay.  After hearing the news, we decided to settle on The Cheescake Factory.  There was quite a long wait for a table but there were several bar tables open, so we grabbed one. Once we sat down, it took approx 10 minutes for someone, who I assumed was our waitress (waitress #1) to ask if we'd like something to drink.  My husband ordered an iced tea to which the waitress replied, ""Passionfruit""?  My husband responded, ""Regular Tea, please""....only to have her walk off without acknowledging his reply.  It took approximately another ten minutes for someone else (waitress #2) to bring us our drinks only to find out that it was indeed a passionfruit tea instead of a regular.  Waitress #2 took the drink back and minutes later brought back a regular tea.   Once we finally had our drinks, it took approximately another 10-15 minutes to have the bartender (waitress #3) stop by and take our food order.  I don't typically like to place my entree order at the same time as my appetizer order, but figured I may as well get while the gettin's good!  My husband and I ordered spinach dip (blaahhhhh...i think it was low sodium or something b/c it was terrible!) and split the Chicken Avocado Club with fries. We waited for about another 20 minutes before a young man (waiter #4) to bring our spinach dip who was kind enough to refill our drinks for us as they had been empty since waitress #3 took our order. Our sandwich followed about 15 minutes after the delivery of the spinach dip only to be delivered by waitress #5.  When she dropped the sandwich off, we had to ask her to clear our empty plates so we could fit the sandwich plate b/c she simply wanted to shove it in amongst the other dirty dishes.  Once she took the dirty plates, I asked her if we could have an extra plate because we were splitting the sandwich.  (btw, the sandwich was the only redeeming factor in the entire debacle...it was fairly tasty)  We waited on the extra plate about 5 minutes before figuring out it wasn't coming at all, so we hovered over the same plate.  The side dish that accompanied the sandwich was french fries for which we were brought no ketchup.  However, I managed to snag waitress #1's attention and asked for a bottle. Our drinks have now been empty since half way through our meal.  10 minutes goes by before waitress #3 walks by and asks if we want cheesecake.  We reply that we're full and before having a chance to request the check, she disappears as quickly as she came from behind the bar.  Another ten minutes goes by and still no check.  Absolutely fed up at this point, my husband makes the call that we'll add up what our food and drink purchases were plus tax and leave the cash......which is exactly what we did.  We never received our check and even though we left cash (no tip, just for the food) I still felt like we did a dine and dash b/c we NEVER received the check. During our visit, I observed two tables in the same vicinity get up and walk out because they hadn't been served.  We even witnessed a woman who seemed to be 8 or 9 months pregnant sit at the bar to have lunch.  She was there for at least 20 minutes, waiting much more patiently that I would have, to order her iced tea and a sandwich.   This was the hands down worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  I cannot speak for the dining room service, but do not go to this bar and expect to be treated like anything but a bother to the staff.  The manager was even going to a few of the tables and asking how everything was.  He took a look at me and could tell I was super pissed and looked down like a dog with a tail between his legs and walked away.  I guess he only wants feedback if he knows it's good.  I will never step foot in another Cheesecake Factory again. STAYYYYYY AWAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!"
Sean S.,"San Jose, CA",5,17,,1.0,11/30/2009,"My wife and I decided to go to this restaurant because we knew we would get a huge portion that the two of us could split.  Our experience was that we were told it was a 20 minute wait. 45 minutes later we were told to go wait near the bar. 10 minutes after standing around our waitress took us to our table which was right next to where apparently the bus boys like to put silverware into napkins and bullshit about how hot or not waitress are... Awesome. So we ordered a pasta dish to split, and some avacado rolls as an appetizer... 20 minutes later having not seen our waitress we get our main dish. The waitress then comes by to reassure us that her main goal is to ""make sure that our experience is a happy experience"" and apologizes for either not ordering the appetizer or just not picking it up.  After we finished our meal the waitress was still trying to upsell us on after dinner liquors and coffees, and I couldn't believe the nerve of the woman. I still regret leaving the 2$ tip on a 30$ bill."
david h.,"Irvine, CA",63,15,,1.0,6/30/2010,1 star for the chicken marsala (about $17) 4 stars for the godiva cheesecake (about $7) 1 star for the wait to get a table (about 40 minutes) 1 star for the waitress (really slow and pretty rude)
M D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,30,4,5.0,2/17/2010,"Been to many Cheesecake Factories, but this one is ""me 'ole faithful"" it could be that I'm partial to this one because I worked across the street from here for so many years so I never go when it's really crowded at dinner time.  I usually go for brunch on the weekend when I work. It's always perfect temp. for sitting outside and the atmosphere is always cracking that this location.   Breaking it down.... *Great to go for brunch on the weekends (never too crowded) *Price average to high *service is fast and good *menu enormous *food .... Very tasty! Oh and.... Appetizer & drinks will fill you up!!!!"
Justin L.,"San Francisco, CA",201,212,36,2.0,1/12/2009,"Sorely disappointing visit yesterday to the classic cheesecake factory.  I hadn't been here in awhile, I went to Grand Lux a couple months ago, but finally came back here.   Deserves a mono two stars from me - the Cajun Jambalaya, which I remember being really tasty, hearty, and filling, was actually sort of bland tasting; the sauce didn't stick, it wasn't very filling, and it was a whopping $17!!  Did cheesecake raise their prices within 1-2 yrs?  I don't remember it being that expensive.  Also, the service was mediocre and nothing special.   Overall I felt disappointed after revisiting this chain that I used to like."
Alaine L.,"San Francisco, CA",27,15,,2.0,4/17/2010,I have such mixed feelings about this place Think it is overrated and the portion sizes are way too big the Cuban sandwich was good I will give them that my daughter's salad had a hair in it and we were so grossed out  staff was nice though and comped our meal as usual too full to order the cheesecake!
Taro T.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,56,4,4.0,6/11/2011,"the cheesecake was pretty nice and the most memorable of the whole meal.  i have been to a few cheescake factories and the entrees are all pretty much the same!  The food is good here thats for sure, its def a nice spot to dine for a date or with the fam! :)"
F. C.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,62,,4.0,11/12/2012,"Great place.  Good place to take a date or gf and it won't break the bank unless she buys a lot of drinks but that only helps your chances I am sure.  Either way, food is super good I like their pastas and their salads a lot.  Good sandwiches and  Cheesecake is always a plus.  Ambiance is nice.  The bread they bring out is good...not sure why I like it so much.  Service is usually on point.  I am happy with this place overall."
Erika G.,"Orange, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/4/2015,"Let me start off by saying that I wouldn't be writing this had the awful management team Including Dan and Erica Edwards followed through with their word in correcting this awful experience. On Sat Jan 24th  my husband, 10 month old baby and myself attempted to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Irvine Spectrum. We checked in at 7pm and were told it would be about 35 minute wait. After an hour, I go check what is happening only to find out they cant find my name in the computer even though I have a pager in my hand. I was asked to wait a few more minutes for them to clear off the next available table in the patio. 15 Minutes later after watching other people get seated, I once again go ask what is happening. It is now 8:30PM. We finally get seated. order our food...and an hour later, after everyone around us has been seated, fed and brought the check, we STILL had no food. So needless to say at now 9:30pm, as our 10 month old has had it and our evening is ruined we get up to leave without dinner and the waitress has the odacity to give us attitude. Upon our departure I ask to speak with the manager, out comes Erica Edwards who apparently was too busy to handle the situation at that moment and asked for my name and number so she can call later that night to discuss how the Cheesecake Factory would handle this. Well apparently their customers are not important as she never called. A few days later I called there and asked to speak with the General Manager, I was put on the phone with Dan who was very apologetic, and sounded like he was genuine and offered to send us a gift card to come back and give them another try. Well , here we are two weeks later and have not received a call, a card or a slight acknowledgement from anyone at this location. For anyone who has a baby, you would completely understand the extreme patience we exercised after almost 3 hours. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory and your unprofessional management team."
