Miriam G.,"Irvine, CA",29,100,,2.0,5/7/2013,"I am a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory but the experience I had at this location was beyond disappointing. My mom and and I went on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. It wasn't busy and there were several waiters and waitresses but for some reason my waitress, shelby was super slow and not very kind. She wasn't rude, she jutst wasn't the over and beyond nice I usually experience at cheesecake.  My bigger complaint is that she was soooooo slow! We kept looking for her Bc we needed more water and then looked for her again Bc we wanted another dish and then looked for her again Bc my mom wanted coffee.... Usually the wait staff is so on top of things we are always asked if we want something but this girl had us waiting and longing. She was the worst waitress (in terms of considering the customer).  She packed our to go box and left out all of the sauces that comes with the Thai lettuce wraps.  Ding dong. Next time i come here I will make sure I'm not waited by Shelby."
Elaine H.,"Paris, France",19,22,1,2.0,9/6/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is a little overrated. There's always a huge line, which gives the allusion that it's a great place, even though the food is only mediocre. I have nonetheless continued to go even though I know it's not the best food ever. Maybe it's the dim lighting and plush seats? I've had many different dishes here, but I'll just write about three. One is chicken marsala, which is apparently one of their most popular dishes. I got it with angel hair pasta; maybe that was a mistake. I hated the sauce! It had this really odd sensation when it went down my throat, like it was burning. It made me feel sick after eating it. It's a brown-wine sauce, so that may be it, but I highly do not recommend it. I've also had a combination meal before, of steak diane and shrimp scampi that came with mashed potatoes. The steak was decent; make sure you get it medium or so because it came out a little bit tough. The sauce on the steak with the mushrooms was excellent, however. The shrimp scampi was also very good, and the sauce was just the way I like it: rich and tangy, and it also had some fresh tomatoes in it. The mashed potatoes are thick and creamy. Lastly, the cheesecake. This is something that they always get right. The Godiva chocolate cheesecake is amazing! Please try it, you won't regret it. It is, however, very chocolate-y and dense.  Even though some of the things at cheesecake are not that bad, it's really hit or miss. The huge line and overpriced food doesn't help."
Caitlin K.,"Culver City, CA",112,78,3,4.0,6/2/2011,"Although I try not to go to chains so much, Cheesecake Factory is pretty reliable for good food. This time we went for the happy hour which I'd never been to. They have a huge happy hour menu (big surprise, right?) I think there were about 5 drink specials and over 25 appetizers in the $5-$7 range, very good deal for Cheesecake Factory. My waiter was being trained, they were very nice. The only thing that would have been better is if I could have sat outside, as the happy hour menu only applies at the bar area."
Ernest K.,"Irvine, CA",49,19,,2.0,1/2/2009,"Our family grew up on your run-of-the-mill chain restaurants. We have fond memories of places like Apple Bee's, Chili's and Olive Garden.  So when my brother comes into town from NY for the holidays, he craves the chain food because it's so uncool to even suggest a place like this in Manhattan. This past Christmas, he wanted something more upscale in the chain families...so we settled on Cheesecake Factory.   We got there at 6PM and were told the wait was 50-70 minutes.  No problem, we just walked around the Spectrum for 50 minutes and came back.  We made sure to check-in when we got back to make sure they didn't already call our name...check, we were third on the list.  Minutes turned into almost an hour and we checked back in.  The hostess said they paged us, but no one answered.  This did not sit well with my brother because a two hour wait for a table in NY meant that Mario Batali was stopping by your table. We barely touched our food because of the Wetzel's pretzels we ended up eating from the long wait...which, by the way, I would give a higher rating to.  The only saving grace of this place was the tag-team service, which had us leaving with a smile (surprisingly)."
Alain T.,"Orange County, CA",141,364,921,4.0,5/18/2011,I like the Cheesecake Factory for the portion. I usually order the Thai Lettuce Wraps or Salmon with miso sauce. I've never had a bad selection when coming here. They also have a good cuban sandwich. They also have a great Velvet cake.
Alex Z.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,4,4,1.0,11/18/2013,Came on last Friday. As this place gets busier the service gets worse. Don't go there when it's busy...
johanna l.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,13,,4.0,1/18/2010,"We (I)enjoyed this location over the past 5 years.  Great for birthdays, anniversary, or just meeting back with friends after shopping the mall. The roll-up on lettuce-such a great idea, and usually there is always a huge appetizer to share with the group.   I'm heading that way again - soon.  There's always room for dessert!"
Suzanne S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,100,,2.0,8/23/2011,SUPER-Slow! The kitchen doesn't seem to have enough staff to accommodate such a large dining area.
Rachelle B.,"San Diego, CA",293,543,125,3.0,12/30/2008,"it's been a few years since i've been to cheesecake factory, so while shopping at irvine spectrum, i decided to take my boyfriend here for dinner. same ol' same ol'. the portions are still huge, food was yummy, but the service wasn't good. i ordered the chicken and dumplings, while boyfriend ordered the jambalaya pasta. the pasta was great. i'd never had it before, but it was really yummy. spicy, but not too spicy. my food was pretty good. one thing i didn't like about it were the carrots. i was expecting them to be cut really small, like the size of the peas, but they were huge. and they weren't cooked to my liking. they seemed like they were just heated for a minute or two, than plated. i like carrots cooked until tender, or raw. it was prepared neither way, which i hated. i had to fish 'em out so that i didn't have to take them home. our waiter wasn't very good at checking up on us and he took forever getting our order, drink refills, and check. i wasn't very happy with him, or this location. wait was long, even though they told us it would only be 10 mins. if it's going to be a 30 minute wait, say it's a 30-minute wait. i just don't get it. another annoying thing about cheesecake factory is the music's very loud in the waiting area. it's hard to hear your name being called when your table is ready. honestly, i don't think the cheesecake was that good. i've had way better (ahem, junior's in brooklyn, NY). i remember it being better, but that didn't surprise me at all. the cheesecake factory i remember from a few years back was way better. maybe now that so many are popping up, their food isn't as good anymore. maybe i'll be back, maybe i won't. we'll see."
Brooke R.,"Bay Area, CA",530,962,32,1.0,7/28/2008,"I've been to many a Cheesecake Factory in the past and was expecting the same architecture, the same decor, and the same level of gross food as the others.  I walked in and was astonished.  This place was so ugly compared to the others!  There were a few outside tables, which were cute, but inside there were rows of booths.  Rows.  Of booths.  They couldn't be more creative?  All we wanted was cheesecake (it's amazing) so we took a two seater in the bar area. The man waiting on the tables in the bar area didn't seem to have too much to do, yet he still took forever to bring us our check.  Ordering was fast, but we didn't get our drinks until he brought out our cheesecake.  The bread, however, came out fast, but left me in dire need of a drink. I didn't think this place could have a wait, seeing as how many tables they have, but as we walked out the line was out the door. 2 stars go to what Cheesecake Factories should be, 1 star for this one."
Jeff L.,"Tustin, CA",122,44,6,2.0,4/8/2011,Cheesecake Factory offers a vast menu of what seems like dozens of pages of options but also vast calories associated with each. Ask for the nutritional guide which our waitress hesitated to give to us and you'll be hard pressed to find more than two to three options that clock in at under 1000 calories. Even a simple club sandwich with fries and some ketchup clocks in close to 2000 calories. Add in eating some of the great bread with butter that they bring and your entire days calorie allocation is consumed.
Joseph H.,"Corona, CA",1,13,,2.0,10/2/2013,Manager needs to better coordinate wait staff. One of the nicest days of the year so we picked the restaurant to sit outside. There were plenty of tables available outside. There were only a few outside eating with dozens of tables open. We were told we could not sit outside. Once inside we see extra waiters working a few tables inside.  The restaurant was not crowded.  Food was OK but not a lot of flavor on many dishes.
Max V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",8,77,1,1.0,10/24/2010,"if you like this place you have terrible taste.  Now that you know this, the next appropriate step would be to stop recommending anything to anyone. Kinda harsh?  It's tough love."
Melody L.,"San Francisco, CA",36,517,104,3.0,2/13/2011,"Huge portions, pretty nice waiter! But not the most exciting ""Italian/american"" place I've been to..."
Ivan L.,"Santa Ana, CA",407,411,30,4.0,8/17/2010,Ok I like the irvine Cheescake factory... Theres always a buzz the service is decent and its not too expensive.  However the main reason I like this place is because they are the only ones that know how to bring back an old school omelette that isn't on the menu anymore. Bacon mashed potato omelette! I'm not sh!tting you! This is good try it for real!
O D.,"Irvine, CA",85,27,,5.0,7/14/2010,The food here is delicious and always a treat to have. The assortments are of wide variety and the atmosphere of this place is perfect for any get together.
Marisa M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",228,263,348,3.0,12/22/2008,"I'm not really a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, though I've found this to be the best location in South OC. The wait is always so long, and the service relatively slow. Some redeeming qualities are their Avocado Egg Rolls and, of course, the cheesecake. Their patio here is nice; on weekends, you get a free car show with all the pricey cars being valeted. NOT - by far - worth 5 stars (come on, people)."
Mary R.,"Tustin, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/28/2013,I came here last night for the first time with my husband for his birthday and I have to admit that at first I wasnt so convinced the hostess that got our names at first wasnt so friendly but our waiter was awesome! Her name was Brittani she was super nice from the beginning to the end answered all the questions that we had and recommended an awesome cheesecake that like she said exploded in our mouths! Definitely will be going back!
Sarah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,176,93,4.0,1/15/2010,"I love Cheesecake Factory! All the food is tasty and comes in big portions. However, the thing that stands out the most and is so food-orgasmic is the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. It is light and oh so tasty. I absolutely LOVE it."
Rudy F.,"Irvine, CA",144,63,181,5.0,12/22/2008,"So we went to the Cheesecake Factory TWICE last week on 12/16 & 12/18...GREAT experiences both times.  Cheesecake Factory ranks up there with Houston's in our books,  as dependable comfort restaurants that we know what to expect when we're having an awful experience elsewhere. On 12/16,  my wife & I went there for dessert,  we got there around 8:30pm,  waited for about 10 mins to be seated.  Everyone was very nice & friendly. I ordered the Fresh Strawberry Poundcake along with a Rasberry White Chocolate Latte,  & my wife ordered their 30 Yr Anniv cheesecake,  which had 2 layers each of chocolate cake & original cheesecake.  It's what you'd expect from Cheesecake Factory.  Good service,  good food.  Status quo. On 12/18,  we went to Cheesecake Factory after our horrible experience from Niko Niko Sushi,  please see that review. We came here after feeling like we needed to redeem our horrible dinner @ Niko Niko.  We ordered the Spinach Dip & the  Avocado Rolls for appetizers,  & I ordered the Fresh Strawberry Poundcake again (didn't quite get enough from Tue.)  My mother in law ordered the White Chocolate Rasberry Cheesecake.  Everything was delish as usual,  service was good. It's what we've come to know Cheesecake Factory as,  somewhere we can go,  that we know what kind of food & service to expect & not be disappointed!!!"
