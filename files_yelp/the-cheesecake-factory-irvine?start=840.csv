David Y.,"Sacramento, CA",83,178,9,3.0,1/29/2009,"Known for its gigantic portions, this American cuisine chain has lost some of its luster of late for mediocre food.  Favorites include the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and Strawberry Cheesecake. $$"
A B.,"Stockton, CA",2,151,,2.0,1/19/2013,"Service was terrible. Bread and butter was literally thrown down at our table because the waitress couldn't get to our table... shouldn't seating be arranged the waitress can have full access to waiting the table? Ya, with that being said, we saw our waitress once, when she took our order OVER the table next to us. Food was mediocre, I ordered the same thing I normally order at the cheesecake factory in mission viejo.. at this location it was cold and bland :( Definitely not worth the long wait, we probably won't be back."
Hrayr A.,"Oak Park, IL",4,50,,3.0,5/29/2011,Excellent service but the food is bland and the portions are so huge that they can feed 2 people easily.
Queen K.,"Newport Beach, CA",25,6,5,2.0,4/10/2011,"We went here for dinner, seated quick at 7 pm on a Sunday, thats pretty good... Waiter is nice, I ask for water with lemon and my friend ask for beer,.... Water came and 5-10 mins later then lemon ugh... And beers comes with a small bug,. Elk and eww!.. Called waiter and he say sorry and all and gave us new mug of beer..(thumb down still) .. Then ordered grilled salmon, he said I can have the salmon cook however I wanted, so I asked for medium grilled salmon and it came as fully grilled salmon,..well its still good but thats not what I ask for, oh well... Not too satisfied with food service."
Amanda A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/15/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory A famous American Eatery Marble columns, windows looking out onto the scenery, and great service are all great qualities to a restaurant. Adding up to all of these qualities includes The Cheesecake Factory, an American eatery. With close to one hundred and seventy locations in America, The Cheesecake Factory is a must go to restaurant. Many of the customers range from casual get togethers with friends to fancy dinner dates or celebrations. The brown decor on the inside adds a modern vibe to the hip bistro. With an affordable price range leading anywhere from $12 to $20, this place is always packed with people.  Being a no brainer, The Cheesecake Factory is most known for its signature cheesecake. Cheesecake flavors range from a tropical piña colada to a rich dark chocolate. Where most dessert menus list about five different options, the menu for cheesecake at this bistro includes around fifty different flavors of their rich and creamy cake. All in all, when you take a bite of the cheesecake, the creamy texture and rich flavors keep you coming back for more! Where dessert is the most popular dish on the menu, the appetizers are great for large parties. Appetizers set the mood for a restaurant leading the customer onto how the quality of the rest of their meal will be. The appetizer menu at The Cheesecake restaurant is filled with many delicious samplers. Fried Calamari is one of the most popular appetizers at many different restaurants, but once you get the calamari at The Cheesecake Factory you will never want to get it anywhere else! The savory calamari is lightly crisped giving it a wonderful texture, and to create a bursting of flavors in your mouth, it comes with a tangy garlic sauce. Another great appetizer is the Tex Mex Eggrolls. Being Hispanic, no Mexican dish compares to mother's cooking, yet this appetizer is absolutely to die for. The savory yet spicy chicken with cheese, beans, corn, and peppers go great with their avocado cream and salsa creating its own sensual party of the taste buds.  The Cheesecake Factory also has an enormous menu of delicious entrees. With large competitions from reigning pizzerias, The Cheesecake Factory puts up a good fight with their cheesy goodness. Consisting of dough, sauce, and cheese, this amazing bistro goes above and beyond when creating their pizza. When anyone can create a simple pizza pie, The Cheesecake Factory bakes them to utter perfection. Personally I would say that their Margherita pizza is their best including the fresh tomato and delicious basil baking until the flavors mold into each other making an aroma to for sure salivate your mouth. This restaurant deserves the gold medal for not only cheesecake but their amazing entrees too! This amazing restaurant is a favorite of mine that I would no doubt recommend. If your planning on a nice date or a casual get together this is the perfect bistro. All in all, the cheesecake makes the restaurant famous, but the food in general is adored across the nation. Therefore, the next time you come across The Cheesecake Factory don't mind dropping by, even if its just for dessert."
Fernando F.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",7,15,3,5.0,7/8/2009,Love Love Love Cheesecake Factory. Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken is my Fav.! I just cant get enough of it!  reasonably priced for what you get. Big portions though so be careful! :]
Amy K.,"Irvine, CA",595,754,1040,2.0,2/12/2008,"I don't understand the appeal of the Cheesecake Factory.  At least the one at Fashion Island has an amazing ocean view.  I just can't see waiting for hours to get a table here. Sure the portions are big, but why do I want that much food that's pretty mediocre?  I usually stick to the salads if I come here.  The bread is good, and I like that they serve tropical iced tea.  But that's just not enough to make me choose Cheesecake Factory.  When I do eat here, it's because someone else picked it."
Sunny M.,"Irvine, CA",7,119,203,4.0,11/11/2010,"My fiance and I had a great dinner experience with our pastor and his wife.  We ordered our usual Miso Salmon, which was delicious, and tried the garlic noodles with chicken, which was descent but a bit bland.  Since I wanted to save room for a cheesecake, I didn't finish my garlic noodles and asked for a box.  Our server brought out the check, but not my box.   When we flagged her down, she apologized and made us a new meal.  Now THAT's excellent customer service!  We gave it to our pastor's son who didn't have dinner, yet, so it worked out perfectly!"
Adrienne M.,"San Diego, CA",11,27,,4.0,11/7/2010,"This place is a mainstay for me.  I've been there too many times to count.   The food is consistent, the service is great, and the ambiance is nice. My favorite item on the menu is Renee's Special, which is one half of a sandwich, soup, and salad. Their Jambalaya dish is also a favorite.  If you haven't been to the Cheesecake Factory, you need to visit it sometime!"
Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,2.0,8/31/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this one sucks.  I've been here a few times and they are ok if they have few customers.  If they are busy go somewhere else.  The service exponentially gets worse as more customers come in.  The food is good and the decor is great, but I avoid this particular Cheesecake Factory b/c service is terrible."
Ryan L.,"Irvine, CA",23,36,,4.0,3/1/2011,"This place never disappoints me. The fish tacos are great, got the Thai sandwich which is awesome, salads are great, avocado eggrolls are always very tasty. Great portions, And theres like 30 different choices for cheesecake, whats not to love??"
Cali F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,,4.0,8/18/2013,"Great restaurant to go to once in a long while - food is great but so many calories :) Complimentary fresh bread (especially the wheat!) is delicious. Pastas and salads are wonderful and generous in size. Miso salmon is always a great choice. Service is always friendly. Cheesecake is..... well this is ""THE"" best place for white chocolate raspberry cheesecake."
Josh B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",39,655,,3.0,1/11/2011,"This location gets really, really crowded. It's consistent. It's Cheesecake Factory.  There is very little healthy on the menu, so don't go for healthy!"
Valerie B.,"Wildomar, CA",109,11,3,1.0,2/17/2013,"I was in Irvine overnight for a business trip. Met w/ a friend to have dinner while I was in town. Had dinner there on a Tuesday night (2/12) @ 7pm. Our service was TERRIBLE! The worst service I have ever received at Cheesecake Factory. I've been to CF many times in various locations throughout CA, this being my 1st time at the Irvine Spectrum and was very disappointed. I had high expectations, especially since the location was in such a nice area, many business professionals there and because typically they have good food and service. Our server took almost 25 min to take our order. We were not offered ANY refills on our beverages and worst of all, we only ordered 2 small appetizer salads and the small macaroni appetizer! Food took forever to get and when we did get it, the macaroni was cold! Perhaps the server had a bad day, but that is no exception to give such awful customer service. We were shocked that service was so bad and with no reason, especially because it was a Tuesday night! The place was not packed at all. When we got our bill, she never came by to collect it, so we stood up and had to look and wait around for a manager. When we complained to the manager (a younger lady) she didn't do anything abut it! She just said, ""Oh, I'm sorry about that."" UNBELIEVABLE! She didn't offer to comp our meal which was not even close to a $30 tab or offer us anything for the HORRIBLE and INEXCUSABLE service. I will never go back to this location again, and I'd rather go the other nearby restaurants to give my business to. I feel that server and that manager should get written up and counseled, especially the manager! She should go back and get trained/educated and how to deal with customers in giving exceptional customer service! She should never have been promoted to upper management."
Sam Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",1193,964,194,4.0,10/26/2009,"Nonfoodies think this place is great food. Foodies know it's not. But I must say this, Cheesecake always has some of the best service barnone... next to PF Chang of course lol."
Jay P.,"Tustin, CA",0,48,14,2.0,3/20/2011,"There's a really short Mexican or Filipino hostess (probably about 4'8"" tall) who ""pretends"" to wash her hands after using the restroom.  She rinses her hands under water for about half a second and doesn't use any soap.  Gross!"
Jen R B.,"Lake Forest, CA",46,183,83,4.0,9/4/2010,"I love that their menu has changed and they are offering a few additional things and sample size plates as well.  I went here with a group for a going away lunch for a coworker and our service was pretty good.  I prefer to come here during the day because the wait at night could be too much for someone hungry and looking to get seated right away... even their bar could be busy.  We've had to skip this place a couple times at night because the wait was too long for us.   During this last visit, I had the Renee Lunch Special with the chicken sandwich, soup and salad.  The soup was potato and it was pretty thick and filling.  I got full alone on one half of the sandwich and the salad.  The sandwich was pretty awesome.  We also shared appetizers...the avocado rolls are the best and I highly recommend ordering these because they are super yummy.  We also had the shrimp rolls, which were OK too but you have to use the dipping sauce or they are just too plain.  It was a great lunch... our server was quick to get all our orders and wait wasn't too bad for the size group we had, about 12 people."
Manni P.,"Alameda, CA",18,55,,2.0,12/15/2008,If you've been to one of these restaurants-you've been to all. 30 page menu? come on!  pistachio cheescake - flourless! that was the only good thing there. on yeah one more thing-no waiting! on a Tuesday night however.
Ron H.,"Manhattan, NY",151,335,200,2.0,4/4/2007,"Eh. I heard a lot about this place from people I trust, but was pretty disappointed. I'm wondering if it's because they expanded the seating at this particular cheesecake, without expanding the staff (they assimilated the building next door). The service was bad, and the food was average.   I'm hoping it was just a bad day, because my friend who had eaten there an hour earlier described the same situation. I'll give it another go some day."
Mark M.,"Long Beach, CA",13,38,8,4.0,11/17/2008,"Too Skinny? Not worried about the POUNDS you can pack on? Looking to have the KILLER CHEESECAKE of all times? Then Cheesecake Factory is for you!  Located at the Irvine Spectrum you will find the BEST DAMN CHEESECAKE ever! But it does not stop there! The food is outstanding also! Make sure you wear the EXPANDABLE pants to this place, and on your way out, you will see what I am talking about.  The menu is quite large, and it is hard to decide on what to order. From Burgers to Pasta, from Steaks to Seafood, everyone will find something that they will love from this place, and to top it off with a different kind of Cheesecake, not just a Cheesecake, but blends you will only see at this place! Peanut butter Cheesecake, Cherry Cheesecake, Carrot Cake Cheese Cake, you name it, they got it in a cheesecake!  I bit pricey, say for two people with of course the cheese cake and tip, you will be putting out around a FIFTY DOLLAR BILL, or close to it.  On my visit the other day, the service was a bit off. Waiter kept forgetting to bring something, and had to make more trips than he should. Coffee was not kept filled, and until he went on a break, is when the service improved. She filled my coffee, and took our CHEESECAKE order, packaged it to go and even gave me a coffee to go on top if it all, Yay! she made me happy with the coffee!  So, go expand that waist line for a change and enjoy one of the evils of dining!"
