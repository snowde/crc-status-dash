IrvineHousewife I.,"Irvine, CA",71,369,,4.0,1/31/2010,"A complete turnaround! Maybe different management, maybe better economy, either way, we had one of the best service in a very, very long time, esp. in a family friendly restaurant. Our server, Olivia, deserves a raise and a mandatory 25%+ tip from all patrons. :) She was all smiles, very patient with our table full of kids who could not make up their mind when ordering their drinks, lunch, and desserts from their kids' menu (think endless questions and constantly changing decisions). very friendly, made small talks, the others who brought the food were all smiles too. Our crabcakes, fish and chips, hawaiian pizza, fettucine alfredo, Fried calamari, white cheddar and broccoli soup, Kobe burger, and popcorn shrimp were all fantastic. So much better than last time.  One tip: Do not order the sliders. I felt it was a total rip off. For $7.95, you  get four small burgers that are absolutely unremarkable, tasted like boiled beef patties on buns with ketchup. I could not take a second bite.  Cheesecakes, mmmm... I wish they did not put the calories sign next to the cake display. Hubby dear naively asked me if the 1,000 calories applies to the whole cake.... I WISH!!! I remember my friend Kevin in college, he gained 33 lb.. in a year while working at Cheesecake factory. I am having water for dinner tonight."
Mike L.,"Norwalk, CA",834,917,3105,4.0,9/1/2006,"Going down to Irvine Spectrum to visit a friend, we decided to stop here for dinner first.  Boy, was it ever packed!  We probably need to make reservations next time because it's almost impossible to get in. Looking at the past reviews, it looked liked this place doesn't take reservations. We were practically starving by the time we got seated.  It was a long drive to get to Irvine and having to wait was even more excruciating.  I ordered a medium well Filet Mignon.  I have to say it's well done.  The atmosphere was like almost family reunion for most tables as it looked to be the place to be for most households.  The parking will tough to navigate if you come on a busy night.  The big plus for anyone is that is was so close to a lot of spots in Irvine Spectrum, it's probably the restaurant choice for the spectrum crowds.  So plan ahead if you want to this particular Cheesecake Factory."
flo c.,"Irvine, CA",147,775,98,2.0,10/26/2007,"My boyfriend and I don't always agree on food. Our points of contention include pho, sushi and kabobs. However, we do agree on some things, and Cheesecake Factory is one of them.  Cheesecake Factory is a Don't. It's like we're programmed to like the place because apparently everyone else and their 10 BFFs are here, waiting for a table. When you walk past the throng of people eyeing you in jealousy because your buzzer buzzed, it's almost like beckoned by the bouncer at the hottest club.  But the food is mediocre at best. The only good things we've tried (aside from maybe the complimentary bread- when warm) would be the garlic noodles, the chinese chicken salad (or something to that effect) and the desserts, especially the chocolate cake. The low-carb cheesecake isn't too shoddy either. I think I semi-liked the jerk shrimp but it was mostly for the fried plantains. The sheer amount of calories and cholesterol in the burger our friend ordered is ridiculous. I mean a double-stack with cheese, bacon and bread...with fries. OMG. You would have to be an alligator for that thing to fit into your mouth.  I also thought that the avocado egg rolls, while applauded by most, were just okay. The first piece was good, but subsequent pieces seemed to be an overkill. That's a sign of just okay-ness. Service is a hit or miss. The best server we ever had was a tall brunette with pink makeup and bangs across her forehead. Too bad she was the sub while the real guy was on lunch. I think her name may have been Olga or Helga, or maybe that's what I secretly called her in my head? Patio service was a miss for me. Maybe it's because we're outside, but I found it to be rather unattentive. If you're willing to stand the wait, get yourself over to Javier's because that at least is tasty and unique. Price-wise, it's about the same (it IS the Spectrum, after all) and you get your money's worth here. Just get the dessert(s) to go. A la mode."
Annalisa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,71,3,2.0,8/9/2010,"Usually I always have good experience with Cheesecake Factory (all locations) and they have been a favorite spur-of-the-moment dining for me since a while back.  The waiters/waitresses are usually very attentive and friendly.  I don't mind the wait for a table, because like any other restaurant like this, it's normal. However, last Tuesday I came here and I realized that on some days these guys REALLY went downhill. 1-We were taken to a table by the hostess, who REALLY needs more training in common sense.  She seated my Fiance at a window table with the sun shining STRAIGHT in his face (is this even okay? the glare-sheet-window things didn't help one bit), so he squintedly but politely asked to move tables, to which she said okay. 2-After we moved tables, we were not given utensils, so I had to go grab it from the table we were originally placed at (it's my job to get my own utensils now?...).  I knew something was missing, but until I was trying to eat my food and realized there were no utensils.  No one on the staff noticed... 3-Not more than 5 minutes later, the senseless woman (the hostess) seat someone else at the exact same spot that we asked to move from.  That poor couple was too nice to ask to change seats, even though they looked very uncomfortble with the glare in their face. 4-The Calamari sucked (normally it's good, but what's with today?).  Gosh, I know you guys are busy, but I know undercooked food when I eat it.  It's probably cooked enough to legal standards but taste-wise I should have just kept my money. 5-The waitress needed more training.  I had better service and professionalism from waitresses at other restaurants who have trouble opening wine bottles (at least they were professional about it).  Our waitress today was leaning left and right excessively and slouching as she spoke to us and took our orders.  And it took FOREVER to get anything done.  It made me feel like I was at a Carls Jr. or something. +1 Star for the excellent main dish, though.  But other than that, what a dissapointing day.  My only reason to ever return to this restaurant after this experience is in the hope that that was just a one-day ordeal where they were training new restaurant staff or something.  Normally everything is much better.  What gives lately?"
Benjamin M.,"Palo Alto, CA",102,257,18,3.0,1/19/2007,"Cheesecake is not what this place is all about: grab a martini and kick back dude! This location is nothing special: there's a lot of people there usually, so it would be worth calling in advance. The portions of food are huge, so  get food for yourself and your partner in crime."
Caroline B.,"Irvine, CA",27,258,4,2.0,6/14/2008,"After seeing a movie the other day at the spectrum, my friends and I couldnt decide on a place to eat so we settled on Cheesecake Factory under the theory that the menu has something for everyone (which I think is a huge detractor because when you have a million things on the menu how can any of them be that good?)  The wait here was insane so we grabbed a table in the bar. We ordered drinks and our food.  The drinks were not that great and cost $10.50 each.  I can see $10.50 at a upscale place in Orange County, but at cheesecake factory?  Also there are no prices listed for their cocktails.  I find it hard to believe they charge that much anywhere else.   The food was ok, but the real problem was with the server.  I was in a group of 3 girls and 1 guy.  The waiter touched us all at some point in the meal.  He also would come up really close behind one of us and kind of hover there.  Suffice to say it was not an enjoyable dining experience."
Shani D.,"Los Angeles, CA",223,216,7,3.0,9/30/2009,"Ahhh The Cheesecake Factory at the Spectrum....I'm not really sure where to start this review. Seeing as I waited tables here for 5 years ('02-'07) I definitely have a love/hate relationship with this restaurant.  As someone who is no longer an employee here, if I was at the Spectrum....I'd eat at Javier's. You can eat at Cheesecake anyplace, anytime, because apparently they're trying to be Starbucks and want to have a location on every corner. When I first started working there in '02, it was still an annoying corporate chain....but not half as bad as it is now. I mean, they cater now?? What is that?? I'm sorry, but who the hell wants their event catered by The Cheese?? And there's a kid's menu now too....what are they turning in to?? Denny's?? Gross.  Anyways, all the food here is beyond fattening...which is fine when you're waiting tables and on your feet 8 hours a day....but for the average consumer you might want to watch out. Yea there are salads...but beware of the dressing....even the balsamic vinaigrette is loaded with sugar. They have a ""weight management"" section of the menu for those of you trying to watch the calories. You can lift your head proud and say, ""I'd like to order the weight management _____ salad."" Weight Management?? They couldn't come up with a less humiliating term?? When I waited tables my favorite was when people would order a ""weight management"" salad, diet coke, and finish their meal with a slice of cheesecake....all the slices are at least 600+ calories a slice by the way. When I visited a different location recently I noticed that they now list the number of calories in each slice.....their new red velvet cake cheesecake has something like 1300 calories a slice!! I mean, it tastes great...but that's close to your entire daily caloric intake! Alright...enough with the crazy calorie counting....even thought this place gave me nightmares of being stuck in a freezer full of cheesecakes coming to life there are a few dishes that I fondly remember. I worked here when I ate meat so these are the entrees I used to love: Bistro Shrimp Pasta, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Jambalaya, Stuffed Chicken Tortillas, and the Shrimp Scampi. Favorite desserts are the Key Lime Cheesecake, Lemoncello Cake and the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel Cheesecake.  As much as I want to hate this place, there are a few fond memories.....but I don't plan on going back anytime soon... P.S.- The brown bread is WHEAT....not chocolate, rye, pumpernickel, or squaw bread.  Thanks."
KristieN N.,"Westminster, CA",0,12,40,4.0,5/12/2011,"I like the foods here, but service is slow.  We come here often for happy hour and lunch.  So many choices on the menu, but we like the $5-focused Happy Hour menu the most.  Before going home, we just jump in there, have a few drinks and appetizers, chitchat, then it is time to go home .... :)"
Lina S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",2,16,1,4.0,12/31/2010,Took my mom and son for dinner. Great food and good service. Anyway I am a cheese cake factory fan. A great place with great food :)
Robert C.,"Riverside, CA",223,307,15,3.0,5/23/2007,"Upscale Formulaic Restaurant Chain. Good food though. The namesake Cheesecake is pretty decent. Not the best, but not the worst. It gets pretty busy on Weekend nights (Fri/Sat) which is my usual sit down chow down dining time, so -1 for me, but else it's pretty good. The ads in the Menu are also -1 for me. WTF, I want to enjoy my eating, not have to be exposed more commercialism than I already am.  Wait staff is competent. A little story: Last time I ate here, my girlfriend and I were witness to see a waitress accidentally knock over a glass of wine onto some fine gentlemen. Instantly, the Manager was out, they were getting him a new shirt. And either the meal was comped or the dessert was. So pretty good service. In short, go there, it's popular, but it's take it or leave it American/Asian Fusion."
Marlon O.,"Benicia, CA",246,376,96,3.0,8/3/2008,Cheesecake Factory has never done me wrong from the Bay to LA. At this location and time we had to settle for it. Everything else was jam packed! Food was good but our service was garbage. I absolutely hate my glass staying empty and having to ask the server for a refill. Whenever I go to a CHeesecake Factory I stick to the script and order lettuce wraps. Cant really go wrong w/ em and they make them pretty good.
K K.,"Irvine, CA",6,29,,3.0,4/12/2011,Cheescake= 5 Stars This place is all about the Cheescake. The price of one slice of Cheescake is a little ridiculous but it is delicious!!! One slice is genrally enough for two people. They really do a great job with varity and taste!!!!!!!!!! Food= 2.5 Stars  They serve nice bread with every meal. I found the BBQ chicken Salad to be more about presentation then taste. It was 13.95 and pretty soggy. They have a few dishes that are decent but the portion size is so large that  it defeats the whole point of coming there to eat the Cheesecake. Food is very average. I didn't care for the Sweet Potato fries at all. I've had much better. The drinks are also very average. Service= 4 stars The servers are almost always really good here.
Real R.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,6,,3.0,1/20/2011,Steak - soft juicy  Pasta - excellent Waiter - friendly awesome guy. Diablo Margarita - not bad.  Got a Sam Adams instead. waiting to be seated.....worst ever.  40 minutes.  I wouldn't go again.  They need to do something about their system.  Get speakers when you call out names!
Brad F.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,131,,4.0,5/31/2006,"I know I know, it's a chain and we have all eaten there, but...this place is so good. And if you find yourself at the Irvine Palace for the Seemingly Aware, this is the place to go. You can valet right next to it, or use the business parking lots that are available on the weekends. The portions here are grandiose (read: lunch the following day is provided) and everything tastes so fresh. At this particular Cheesecake Factory, there are great seats and good shopping while you wait for your table. And don't worry about missing your name being called while you are browsing at the sunglass kisok, the plastic mini mac like device will radiate and beckon you onward. I actually saw a kid salavate when his spaceship went off at Anchor Blue. I usually order the salads, any of them, but my favorite is the one with the salmon all up in it served with spinach leaves.  The Spectrum, a mega-review in itself, does provide some good stores to shop so you can burn off a bite of that cheescake as you parade with the other Orange Coasters.  This is by far my favorite chain. It has never let me down.  SIDENOTE: if you are looking for a good stock pick, Cheesefactory has split several times since the 80s and continues to turn out large profits on every one of their stores. Buy some cheesecake, buy some stock (Nq: CAKE), live in Irvine, and plan your lunch. What a happy world we could live in..."
Maryanne S.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/28/2010,"Um okay. Six of us ordered entrées and an appetizer. The total came to about $109, and we even had a dollar extra for the waitress after we accounted for the appetizer we shared, the tax AND the added gratuity (18%, not our choice). The receipts come out and they charged us EACH an extra few dollars for tip, so the new total came to about $124. Double tip for mediocre service? No thanks. The waitress promised to fix it. After about ten minutes the manager came out, didn't apologize and was very impersonal. Finally, we ended up voiding the previous transaction after explaining to the manager countless times that we got charged DOUBLE for tip. Then, we got separate checks, and the waitress reminded us over and over that gratuity wasn't added on these. Pfft. Thanks. All in all, we waited 40 minutes after initially paying the check. It was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life."
Jenn N.,"San Jose, CA",50,106,,3.0,3/7/2008,I can always count of the cheesecake factory to have decent food. Everything is ok and the portions are nicely sized. The only really good things here are the free bread they give you and the actual cheesecakes (especially the tres leches cheesecake). They also make pretty good drinks. I had the yummiest mojito here. Overall it's like any other cheesecake factory. It's location near the theatre and shopping is quite convenient.
Ryan T.,"Irvine, CA",214,29,1,3.0,6/22/2010,"Don't get me wrong--I love cheesecake more than anyone, but when you come here that should be the only thing you should order here. First of all, the food Is okay but pretty expensive during dinner time...I ordered the shepards pie during lunch and it still rang up to around 20 bucks. The atmosphere would have been nice--if it weren't for the countless people chatting their mouths off lol. I thought the cheesecake factory would have a more sophisticated style, but that's only reserved for their cheesecake. :)"
Ryan M.,"Emeryville, CA",784,912,135,3.0,1/16/2007,"Well my third review, here on   so let's get started. I've never dined at a Cheesecake factory, so I was truly skeptical in the beginning about the cuisine (other than its lavish cheesecakes). The reason is because of the same stuff everyone has already mentioned. Extremely packed, and it lacks the reservations system (which would have been preferred). However after you've overcome those hurdles, you sit on a table accompanied with your friends or date, and actually enjoy the ambiance everyone is familiar with. Kind of reminds me of Spaghetti Factory actually, just with the extra incentive for Cheesecake. From appetizers to main courses, they are on point, and again the Cheesecake (White Chocolate/ Peanut Butter Truffle) a SoCal exclusive for those of you familiar, with the Cheesecake Factory offerings in NorCal.  It was frustrating, but definitely well worth the wait, and it gives me an extra push to drive 15-20 mins just to get a box of my own, once in a blue moon The service is excellent there is nothing for me to complain about, they are prompt and courteous to all dining guests. Overall, this is one of the many gems of the Irvine Spectrum Center, so if you haven't enjoyed the cuisine of Cheesecake Factory, then I suggest this place for sure."
Michael C.,"Saratoga, CA",219,257,19,3.0,12/4/2007,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory for the longest time, but was called last minute to take a biz trip down to SoCal, and my first meeting was here.  I guess I don't go to Cheesecake too often... I was early, so I had to wait for about 30 mins, and I noticed that there isn't a bar inside, so I was debating whether to go to the bar across the way, but it was way packed, so decided not to at the end.   Finally met up with everyone, and I ended up ordering the Kobe Burger.  It tasted like a regular burger, but wasn't too bad.   Overall, it was a pretty non-eventful business dinner, and I got business done, but food was just like I would have expected any other Cheesecake to be."
