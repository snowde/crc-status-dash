Bryan R.,"Long Beach, CA",233,269,53,1.0,8/14/2007,"Don't really know why anyone would go here, other than they offer a little bit of everything.  And everything is all very, very bland. My excuse was I had a gift card.  I ordered some sort of a Thai Chicken Pasta thing (minus the chicken) and it just tasted like very bland, flavorless, soggy pad thai.  Except it was twice as expensive as any other pad thai in the area.   No thanks."
Trevor T.,"Irvine, CA",80,365,27,3.0,1/24/2007,"I'll start by saying that the food is really good, for a chain restaurant. Note that this place is PACKED on the weekends - if you don't reserve your spot, expect a long, long wait. We went on a Friday night and it took 75 minutes for us to be seated.  But the service was good and the food was really tasty. I had the orange peel chicken. Served hot."
Jasmine S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",6,110,,1.0,8/12/2011,"We were at the spectrum so decided to give the place a whirl. The place was packed and really noisy which was expected. The food was ok but I probably wouldn't order the veggie pizza again. We were ready to get a dessert or another drink when the waitress spilled an entitre glass of water in my lap. At first we were ok with it but then she kept telling my husband sorry when I was the one she spilled on. She wiped up the mess with my napkin and asked if I wanted her to wipe it more. There was still a ton of water and I said you need a towel I can't sit there it still has water on it. She left and came back with the bill. In the meantime we had been standing in the aisle. We still had drinks (that she hadn't spilled) so we had to just leave them, she didn't get us a new table just the check. Unbelievable how bad the service is."
Lori S.,"San Clemente, CA",0,67,,3.0,8/28/2010,"How can people say ""The food here isn't any good.' They have a ton of selections; have you tried everything? They have lots of great dishes here.  That's the beauty of the menu; something for everyone. The only thing I don't like is the acoustics; it's noisy and the tables are too close togehter."
Maome S.,"Emerson, NJ",28,209,4,4.0,9/15/2006,Been to this cheesecake forever and I'll never get tired of it. Herb crusted salmon.  Yum.
Jasmine O.,"Arcadia, CA",59,284,36,3.0,12/28/2006,"Humongous portions. I can never decide what to get because they have five million options. Chicken madiera? Thai pasta? Luau salad? But what's with the wait all the time? I think they have some special managing practice where they require at least 10 people to be waiting in the lobby at all times.  But the food, portions, and value I can't complain about."
N L.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,109,33,2.0,7/9/2007,"We came to Cheesecake Factory for my Sis' early birthday dinner last night.  I've been to many different locations of this chain before, just never the one at the Spectrum.  Not that I think Cheesecake Factory is all that spectacular in general...but it's just a normal restaurant with basic foods to go for dinner and the option to have cheesecake for dessert (I do love cheesecake) if I feel up to it.  In any case, when we eat at the restaurant (regardless of the location) I do expect decent service and definitely a clean spot to sit on.  I've learned to check my seats before parking down my behind to enjoy my meal from past experiences.  Needless to say,  I was so disappointed with this place.  We were told to wait 5-10 minutes for a table when we arrived.  We ended up waiting 35 minutes.  Fine, no problem since it was just an estimate that they provide.  We were lead to a tiny table in the corner with huge people right next to the shared side, so instead of taking it, we asked the hostess if we can wait for a different table, maybe a booth.  She said she'll check and told us to wait.  But within 1 minute, she turned around to us and said follow her to the other side of the restaurant, there may be a booth over there.  Well, we got to the other side, and there were plenty of available seating.  Didn't understand why she wanted us to step back out to wait.  Okay, so we get a booth.  Once I sat down, I jumped back up almost immediately.  There were what looked like dried up, caked-on mash potatoes smeared on my side of  the wall where I was going to lean my purse against.  SEE the PHOTO I took. (Is it just moi or something?  Do I have ""pick me"" written on my forehead?!  Lately I've just had the worst luck with service, food, cleanliness, etc... when I eat out!).  I asked our waitress to get someone to come with a rag to wipe it down.  She didn't look too happy to begin with (bad attitude!) and gave me a weird look.  The bus boy came to wipe the wall down but didn't bother with the debris and the food particles that fell onto my seat, just left quickly.  I sat almost to the edge of the opposite side, feeling really gross about it and looking around for our waitress to come back.  But finally the manager (I think) noticed something was wrong and asked me what's the matter, so I told him I wanted to change to another table.  I wasn't trying to be difficult, I just wanted a clean spot to sit to enjoy my din-din with my sis!!  He immediately took us to a bigger, cleaner booth only an aisle away.  Now I was happy, and with a different waiter, yeah!  Two minutes after we sat down, our waiter brings that same waitress from the dirty booth over to introduce to us, telling us she will be covering for him while he goes on break.  Great... same bad, lame attitude.  Okay, so we order (drinks and dinner) from her.  I say I want water with lemon, she forgets the lemon.  Then I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon with lemon sauce, asked for extra sauce on the side. Then she repeats my order and says ""no sauce"".  WTF!  Lady, wake up!  She was stoned or something!  I said extra sauce!  How do you eat that dish with no sauce?  Mind you, her section pretty much  was empty, not busy at all.  Btw, I get this dish a lot and I've never had one quite this odd and below standard.  They must have run out of herbs or got a rookie chef!  The ""herb"" was very wet and was simply slapped onto the salmon. The ""herb"" was just chopped up wet parsley!  What crusted herbs? The asparagus that came with the dish were wet and limp, not fresh at all.  They had the nerve to serve it that way.  Amazing.   The Louisiana Chicken pasta seemed okay but our Chopped Salad was drenched with dressing served on a warm plate.  Not that appealing.  I wonder why a chain restaurant fails to have consistency at what they make daily.  Btw, that waitress never came back to check on us.  Our waiter came back only shortly before we were done with dinner.  No dessert there, wanted to get out fast.  However, I did get a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake to-go.  The cheesecake is good, thus the 2 stars. Next time I'm at the Spectrum, I will go to Yardhouse for dinner instead.  Never Cheesecake Factory at this location again."
James K.,"Cerritos, CA",8,172,42,3.0,12/4/2007,"My last visit to this place was in 2005.  The cheesecake is good but the food you eat before it is questionable.   My date's food was nasty so we traded. -_-  My dish tasted just fine before the trade. Tt has a nice and ambient environment.  The server's were very friendly, and extra friendly to my date! rawr. :( The price is moderate.  The overall experience was good and I can't say anything to discredit the validity of this place."
Fatemeh S.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,97,33,5.0,3/27/2009,"I ordered the eggplant. Hated it. Melissa, my server gladly took it away. Johnny, the manager, offered complimentary soup or salad to hold me over til my alternative order came in. My portabella is perfect. Three bites into this gigantic sob and I'm full. But happy."
ColomboArgentino C.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",3,159,111,1.0,4/13/2009,"This is Irvine Spectrum restaurant is a SOMKER'S REFUGE. If you sit outside, you will have the SMELL OF CIGARETTE AND CIGAR SMOKE wafting on to and into your meal!  (Just like in Europe.) The service at night was poor and unattentive. The food is OK if you are starving.  The appetizers are light and overpriced, and the cocktails are a bit pricey and overrated.  BUT ask if they have the dessert you like before being seated for they may be out of it.  Not a family-oriented eatery / OUTDOOR DINING HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR SMOKERS.  (This tobacco friendly establishment is for you. Enjoy a bit of the Old World in the OC.!"
Lin X.,"Tustin, CA",19,14,2,2.0,8/1/2012,"Met up with friends for dinner and ordered the jambalaya.  It  wasn't as good as I remembered but good enough.  So then comes time for dessert and I bust out their coupon for half price for any slice cheesecake.  I just have to say: If you're going to offer a half price coupon, don't bring your customers HALF the size of a slice that you usually make!!  That's all."
Debbie M.,"Orange County, CA",435,122,14,2.0,6/19/2009,"I was a bit hestiant about writing reviews about ""chained"" restaurants, but in this case, I think this restaurant deserves a review for my experience today. Generally, the portions are large enough to feed two people (unless you order from the limited lunch menu). There is a large crowd for lunch, normally local business people working around the Spectrum. I'd advise you to arrive here around 11:30 to avoid a long wait time. My take on Cheesecake Factory in general is that the cost per dish is pretty pricey - avg $15/dish. I've never really understood why people loved this place so much. Yes, there are some good dishes, notably the avocado egg rolls, miso salmon, and cheesecake, but I never thought that other dishes were that good...well for the price that is.  I didn't see much ""value"" in the dish.  Now about my review of this particular location - My water mug had some weird unknown object stuck to the inside where the water was. Both of my forks and my friend's fork still had food stuck on it. In addition, my favorite bread was burnt.  I find these things unacceptable. It shows me that their kitchen isn't properly washing the dishes nor is there quality check on the silverware or bread. For a restaurant to not be able to get the basics down, I question the operation of the business.  I wasn't mad at the waiter, he didn't do anything wrong so the level of service was okay. But I wasn't too satisfied with my experience today.  I don't think I'll be coming back unless I have to."
Conspicuous C.,"Lake Forest, CA",48,389,2,4.0,7/8/2006,"Cheesecake Factory is consistently great, with great food, a giant menu, huge portions, and attentive service. Unfortunately they don't take reservations and this particular location gets crazy busy except off-hours.  It's also gotten more pricey over time.  So I took off a star."
Ai M.,"Bellflower, CA",100,2017,4020,3.0,1/4/2009,"Even if you can't think of another restaurant to eat at, how can people stand to wait for this?  I guess people like to eat within sight of the valet.  My mother used to send me here before the holidays to buy her cheesecake for a Christmas party.  The floor traffic inside the restaurant is obnoxious and I've gotten lost trying to get out.  Why is there always a line?"
Sam G.,"Atlanta, GA",310,31,1,2.0,1/23/2011,"I had lunch at this Cheesecake factory location early last week with my partner and have to say we were both shocked at the poor service we received. My partner ordered the same salad he gets almost every visit to a Cheesecake Factory, the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. He asked for extra chicken and for the dressing on the side. I ordered the club sandwich and substituted sweet potato fries instead of regular fries. Our meals arrive, while I am sitting with an empty glass of tea, and both orders are wrong. Mine was a minor error. They brought regular fries and had to return with sweet potato fries. His salad, at first glance, had 2 small problems, no extra chicken and no dressing on the side. We explained all this to the runner who brought our plates out and she first said she was sure he had received extra chicken but would take it back to the kitchen to check. A different runner returned with my fries and his salad that now had extra chicken. We then had to ask again for the dressing. They finally returned with that and then our server stopped by. We told her we were OK but a little disappointed that both meals arrived incorrect and that we needed more tea. We were VERY polite about the situation and did not even tell her that one of the runners had a lot of attitude. Once my partner begins eating his salad he learns that they added apple and avocado to his salad. He first overlooked it and tried to eat it until he found 8-10 pieces of apple and more avocado. When the server returned he told her what he discovered and she said she was sure the salad came with those items. We then asked for a manager because we knew she was completely wrong. When the manager arrived he instantly had bad attitude. He began to explain that when they are mixing salads in the back ""lots of things are flying"" and ""sometimes other ingredients land in the wrong salad"". I told him that was unacceptable under any condition. This is not a $4 Subway salad we are talking about. They charge $15 for salads like this at Cheesecake Factory and we expect them to get it right. What about customers with food allergies?? Are they supposed to keep their EpiPen close by in case they get an ingredient that they are allergic to ""that was flying around"" in the back. I would think that the liability and basic customer satisfaction would be enough to make sure people GET WHAT THEY ORDER! In the end we had to ask for the salad to be taken off of our bill and the manager was TOTALLY not the kind of Cheesecake Factory trained employee we were used to dealing with. We both normally love this chain and eat there several times a month. Now that we moved to this area and this location is the closest to our home, we will be rethinking that and will likely not be returning. We expect to get what we pay for and at this CF location we simply did not get that.  The biggest problem here is poor management.  The manager's poor attitude and lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is clearly reflected in his employees' poor performance."
John A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,26,,2.0,5/26/2009,"Don't ever eat here near closing time. I was on a date, decided to splurge and buy a steak. Needless to say it was a let down. I thought I knew after watching the restaurant movie not to eat anywhere close to closing time... but oh well. I didn't complain but I guess I learned my lesson about eating so late."
Rachel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,52,6,4.0,11/13/2009,"I like Cheesecake Factory a lot because their food and desserts are delicious!! Their meals are always in HUGE portions, so I make sure to always share a meal with whomever I go with! Since I work right across the street, it's a great place to have friends meet me for after-work drinks and/or dinner. They staff is usually friendly, though they always seem to be super busy and short-handed whenever I go. Even though there's usually a wait (approx 15 mins beginning around 5:30pm to as high as 2 1/2 hours later on) the food is worth it! I love to start with the avocado egg rolls (mmmm::SALIVATING::mmmm) and a side salad.  The great part about their menu is that everyone can find something they like and want off of it. From my lactose-intolerant father to my vegetarian sister, and all us foodies in-between, it's a great place for cocktails and celebrations! I like that they added the small dishes (tapas) menu as well because the corncakes and stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks are AMAZING!!!! :)  Yeah some dishes are a little pricey, but overall it's a great restaurant!"
N G.,"San Diego, CA",41,114,,1.0,9/25/2010,"Worst cheesecake factory experience ever. You would think someone bringing in a wedding party of about 10 people would actually be treated well. But no, don't expect anything from the horrible manager that worked on Monday September 20, 2010. He was a huge jerk. We had a coupon for a free cheesecake but he wouldn't let us use it because it apparently wasn't good 'til next week. Also, they supposedly had happy hour when we were there, but because there were 10 of us and we wanted to sit outside, he wouldn't let us buy the drinks at the happy hour price and sit outside with them. The angry stain covered tie manager came and just said, no he can't do anything for us. No apologies, no thank you so much for bringing in a big group of people but f- you. Pretty much just told us no and walked back in. No smiles or anything. Really hope that manager gets fired. I go to various cheesecake factories regularly, but I will go out of my way to not go to this one. The food was of course the usual. Reasonably ok, but of course way overpriced which could be overlooked if it wasn't for the crappy manager."
Charles H.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,59,13,5.0,8/3/2011,I love this restaurant and visit quite often for the great food and service.
Tara M.,"Claremont, CA",45,137,150,2.0,7/4/2011,"The boyfriend and I stopped in Saturday night for appetizers after a concert. The wait was quoted as 25 min, 45 min later we were seated (Friday night, it's busy no lost love on that). We ordered the Vietnamese Tacos, Firecracker salmon, pot stickers and 2 sodas. Waitress was great, very friendly and service was spot on. Our food arrived in  timely manner. The Firecracker Salmon (I was expecting some kind of spice or kick) was bland, the fish was fresh, well prepared, the dish just lacked flavor. Potstickers (which is a standard fare for us, at this location and others) were horrid, they put the dipping sauce over the dumplings and they were so salty they were inedible. The high point of the meal  was the tacos, flat steamed buns (think bao) with nicely seasoned shredded beef, spicy peppers and crisp marinated veggies (tasted like rice wine vinegar, sesame, little sugar and soy). We will be ordering the tacos again, they were really great, the rest of the meal not so much."
