SuperGirl ..,"Los Angeles, CA",1697,73,113,3.0,6/7/2008,"I never understood why this place is soooooo popular or the fact that people are willing to wait forever just to be seated here.  Huh?  Why?  Really, why, oh, why??????  Their food is not great.  They have some interesting items.  They do have large portions, if I do say so Myself.  But when it comes to portions, I want huge portions of great items, not these so much, lol.  Their salmon is always farm raised and not wild.  A lot of their items are things like pastas and pizzas and such, booooo!  Their mixed appetizer platter is interesting in the fact that it gives you chance to try different appetizers and that it's huge, haha.  In fact they bring it out on four different plates, hehe.  That's cool.  A lot of the foods here are filling, but not great.  I have never been impressed with the food here.....if I go here to eat it is out of desperation and convenience, like if I am in a certain area and the other places are closed and stuff, then, you know, you do what you must, lol. I do like their desserts, however!  The cheesecake.  Their chocolate mousse cheesecake is soooo good, it is soooo good, I am trembling a little thinking of it right now, haha.  I prefer My Cheesecake factory cheese cake in frozen form though, I think it's way yummier that way. So, overall, if other places are closed and you don't have choices, then sure, try this place and you will get full.....the issue is full of what though, lol.  The food is just not great.  You would be wiser going somewhere else for the meal and just coming here for the dessert. :) Actually, I would suggest you go straight to the take out counter, which actually offers you the full menu to go, food as well as the desserts.  :)  So, just use that and don't wait forever for a table.  Who needs that?!  Also, you can get their cheesecakes by the whole cheesecake or half, I think, they will give them to you frozen when you order the whole one, yay, the way I love it, before they defrost it.  So, if feel like being badd and enjoying it, just get the whole chocolate mousse cheesecake to go....they have a million other cheesecake flavors, too.....I have tried a lot of the flavors over the years and that one remains My absolute favorite!  I think you can also get like a sampler cheesecake to go which has a few different kinds, which can be fun.  :)  They also have a low carb cheesecake which is good if you want to enjoy cheesecake and not be quite as naughty.  There are various other delicious desserts as well.  Their teramisu is quite creamy and yummy.  All their desserts are pretty good and pretty good size.  So, this place is good for some things and not for others.  Now you know, haha.  :)  Oh, and they are not economical.  Both the desserts and the food are not cheap by any means considering what you get.   But if cheesecake is what you crave, then do stop by the take out counter and get one to go.  Get a whole one, you can always give Me half of it or more, haha.  :)                                       ...XooX SuperGirl"
Mya H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,29,,2.0,8/19/2009,"Had an awful experience tonight. I come here almost every night to eat with my friends. Meal was good and everything was great, until we were done and the waitress actually asked us to pile up the plates and to ""clean up"" the table. Are you kidding? She then proceeded to take away our bread right when my friend went to reach for a peice. I was so appauled, I didn't leave a tip."
I. K.,"Irvine, CA",1,83,,1.0,9/6/2011,"My husband got food poisoning there after he ate the veggie burger! He is feeling miserable! After researching, I found that The Cheesecake Factory has a problem with food poisoning in different locations all over the US!"
Stephanie L.,"Irvine, CA",57,193,2,3.0,3/17/2011,"My opinion of The Cheesecake Factory is torn.  There have been times where I've gone here and and the food is bad.  Their sandwiches?  Bad.   Their salads?  Bad.  Then there are times when I come here and think, ""This is why I come back!""  Those thoughts cross my mind after I have a bite of their pasta.  Don't ask me why, but I've tried a good half of their pastas and they're delicious.  Then there are those nights when you want to enjoy a simple evening on the patio with a good friend and just talk over dessert and cocktails.  I would say The Cheesecake Factory is a good place to go for that.  I know this review is for the Irvine location, but the same can be said about its other locations.  There are very few restaurants who can charge over $10 for a simple cocktail and The Cheesecake Factory has no qualms about their prices.  I'll be damned to pay that much for a drink in Rancho Cucamonga."
Lori X.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,26,,2.0,1/14/2012,"2 1/2 problems: They're one of those restaurants that don't have the prices of alcoholic drinks listed on the menu!!  That reaks of sneakiness!  The food isn't that flavor-ful & the menu is a bit too big, kind of tiring to look through.  Yeah the desserts are great."
Kione E.,"San Jose, CA",321,693,402,2.0,6/23/2008,"oh. my. god. i never thought that we'd ever come here. of course, when someone usually asks, ""where you all wanna eat?"" saying "" i don't care."" will usually send you too the last last you'd expect. and even though you'd wanna protest, you can't, because you already said, ""i don't care."" so here i am, standing in front of the host stand already feeling nauseous. the decor is gaudy enough to make me puke. oh man. this is bad. i hope we don't get some overly happy idiot trained and ready to do a song and dance all for a scooby snack. i hope we don't get sat in the middle of this bright noisy mess. oh man. i can't believe i'm here. ih well, let's see what happens. we are sat in the bar, in a far corner booth away from the hubbub. it was a lot dimmer, quieter,  than most of the restaurant. but what the fuck is all this advertisements in the menu? how trashy is this shit? not only so i have to  siphon through all this crap to figure out what item i think they won't fuck up that will be bearable to eat. but now i'm bombarded with advertisement. and i'm surrounded by a shopping mall. i'm in no way into safe eatting. i'm a flip. i et eberyting. but i hate being disappointed. so i'm reading through the epitome of corporate american restaurant menu. wondering what the hell does these idiots know about asian or italian or mexican. oh yeah, they don't have to, because consumer america already bought into this shit. our server was actually cool. he really knows how to pace himself and he wasn't trying to sell us the whole menu.over all, the guy was very accommodating, chill and he was not trying to be in our face. very detailed, very professional. what to order? what to eat? well i can't order a salad if i want a entree, because if i order the salad, it's gonna be huge and i'd have to only eat half of the salad, but i can't take it home, cus it's gonna get soggy. or, i can eat the whole salad, and only half of the entree, but it'll be soggy byt he time i....no half size salad? no. fuck, i hate places that serve all their dishes family size. supprise. the spicy tuna tempura was actually pretty good. i could have eaten the whole thing, but i had a ""ton of fun"" headed my way. no, i'm not talking about fat-bastard. i'm talking about a double decker burger with a huge mound of  fries. and that was pretty good to. a bit difficult to eat, but worth the effort. the fries were rubbery. what ever that unidentifiable brown bread was that was in the basket, that was pretty good too. the baguette, eh. uh, no we don't happen to have any room for dessert."
Brad K.,"Irvine, CA",6,31,7,4.0,12/12/2006,"Great place to go and the ambience is awesome.  I'm continually amazed at the amount of varying decor and interior design they've used.  Obviously the cheesecake is to die for but some other goodies are the Vietnamese Summer Rolls, Lual Salad, and the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp.  I recommend going there for dinner or even for a late night coffee/cheesecake place - it's a great place for a date or meeting."
Mei N.,"San Diego, CA",126,251,39,2.0,6/26/2007,"just like other mass productions of food, you'd expect this place to have the same consistency as all the other millions of cheesecake factories around but it doesn't. i ordered a bowl of soup, half salad and half turkey sandwich for lunch. well, the salad as wilted and the bread on the sandwich was so hard that i could barely bite into it. i had to dip the sandwich in my soup in order to bite it. we sat out in the patio with some friends and my dog. none of the waiters seemed to care for my dog since he was just laying there on the ground on his stomach and not bothering anyone. it's not like if you could miss him. he's a 95 pound rotti. who could miss him? anyway, after being seating for well over 15 minutes with our drinks on the table, the manager comes up to us and tells us that dogs aren't allowed on their patio. wtf? you couldn't tell me that earlier as we were walking in with this ginormous dog??? so we changed tables and tied Rocky outside of the patio."
Sunflower M.,"Temecula, CA",1,92,40,1.0,10/18/2012,"just going to make this short & sweet......since my fingers are broken from emailing corporate. good for kids: yes......i think not!! they provided discrimination at it's finest last night, when were approached by mgr becky last night, and told our 1 year olds were too loud and there were complaints. and what we could do to quiet them down. too loud consisted of the little girl screeching about once every  20 mins because she has just discovered her voice. and let me say, we were able to have full conversations, she would quiet instantly when asked & i think we all know how loud that restaurant is!! this is so ridiculous, humiliating, and not too mention they left us there another 30 minutes waiting on boxes & the bill, and that mgr was no where to be seen!!!! my friend has worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and has never seen anything like this done!!! comped-i don't think so. offered to move to a different table-nope. patrons being offered dif tables in our area-not at all. free cheesecake for our trouble-what are you joking.....that would be polite. fully paying for the ice tea i got  a few sips of-absolutely. being humiliated in the middle of the restaurant-done and done. good bye cheesecake factory, it's been nice dining with you for the past 15 years!!! yes & this is blasted all over facebook & boy did you lose more than just us!!!"
Robert B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",172,17,1,5.0,12/4/2007,"For all the people above griping about the wait ... have you ever tried eating in the bar? If you just want to get in and out to catch a movie or are absolutely starving and can't wait another second to eat, go talk to the bartenders. They serve a full menu and give CONSISTENTLY great service....just a thought. And you get your drink faster. Like, right away."
Sherry V.,"Irvine, CA",8,52,4,4.0,5/15/2010,"Yumm! I came here last weekend and ordered the peppered salmon (I think that's what it was called) and it was absolutely delicious!! The salmon was very flavorful and moist.  It was served on top of a thing of chunky mashed potatoes that blended in well with the juices from the salmon.  It was also served with asparagus.  I think this is one of my favorite restaurant entrees of all times.  The place itself was like any other cheesecake factory. Staff was attentive and enjoyable (they made a lot of jokes). The place was crowded, my girl friend and I waited 1.5 hours for a table and we were seated very close to another party (literally a foot away).  It didn't bother me, but others might be irked if that happened to them. The cheesecake was melt-in-your-mouth heavenly, as usual.  You can't go wrong with the original. Last thing: I took a portion of my entree home and it was as delicious as it was the night before (sans the asparagus--it was limp and not crunchy). Overall, I had a good experience and would recommended this place."
Monica P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",131,217,28,5.0,10/4/2007,"Great Service, great food, long wait, but good things come to those who wait. I always tip 20%!"
b t.,"Irvine, CA",34,38,,1.0,1/16/2011,"Im going to say this is as bad as dennys. $16 for 2lbs of pasta with tomato, milk and water. NO Meat, nothing. $8 for frozen cheese cake. How Do people keep coming back here."
ben m.,"La Mirada, CA",0,13,1,5.0,1/12/2011,I love their outdoor patio and the waiting time is not bad compared to many other cheesecake locations. good food as well
Jonathan Y.,"Monrovia, CA",61,198,1,3.0,12/30/2006,"Great food, great portions, extremely crowded, and a tough location IF you're here just to eat. I'd recommended the Newport location for pure dining. But hey it's socal so come here to do so much more before and after your great meal!"
Jessica S.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",186,77,1,4.0,10/27/2006,"great place, long wait. great menu, but Id skip out on the Fedichinni Alfredo there, love the stuff, but their version tastes like plastic. although   I do HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Mediera especially if you like mushrooms   and for desert skip the cheesecake and get the strawberry shortcake"
Eileen C.,"Irvine, CA",7,56,8,2.0,7/8/2007,"I pretty much dislike The Cheesecake Factory menu in general. It's also overpriced for mediocre food. However, I must say the burgers are tasty! The bun is always toasted just right and the meat has a great texture. It's my go-to dish when one of my friends just insists on eating here."
Tiffany L.,"Pleasanton, CA",134,286,1,4.0,8/25/2007,"Yum, cheesecake!! I have always loved eating at cheesecake. Large portions, decent prices for what you get, to die for cheesecake, honestly there is nothing better than loading yourself up to stupor proportions. The avocado egg rolls are bomb and so is the shrimp scampi!! My all time favorite cheesecake has to be the strawberry cheesecake, even though its like the most ordered cheesecake, you know there has to be a reason why that is. Also waits can be quite ridiculous, thank god its at spectrum so you at least can wander the shops a bit to kill some time."
Megan M.,"Irvine, CA",63,18,2,4.0,8/24/2006,Far too busy for it's own good. I would suggest going in for lunch maybe there's now wait then. The utmost extensive menu. You can satisfy any taste and go back hundreds of times and never order the same thing.
