Lil' Chef F.,"Grand Terrace, CA",69,53,3,4.0,10/7/2009,"What an extremely LOOOONG menu! Phew!!!! ...Which is a good thing for me (and the folks who want more than the VERY limited In-N-Out fare, no offense) We went there a mth ago - our 1st time since moving to the US over a year ago. Why? Because I was always repelled by the name assuming they only served cake & desserts here! (Change the name, People!!) Ok, coming back to the food...  They've got, like, 400 items on their menu, so you should order your drinks & savor their warm bread before you begin browsing their menu - its gonna be a while! But the great thing is that their service is SUPER-fast.. for that volume of business, I must say, they're pretty fast! Be sure to go in a bit early, say 6-ish, in the evenings cuz they usually have a long queue.. but its worth the wait, trust me! Now, I realize they're goin the Starbucks way & mushrooming all over the place but you have to remember, not all of them are low-quality. I've been to just 1 (Irvine Spectrum) but I get good reviews on their Riverside & Rancho Cucamonga outlets! I'm giving them 4 stars b'cuz of their waiting time."
Jamie A.,"Irvine, CA",10,55,,2.0,11/26/2008,I've been going out ALOT now that I live across the street from the Spectrum. Last night a friend and I decided to walk back to the Spectrum and have coffee and cheesecake. We got there about 8:30 and were seated right away. We got a great table with a huge picture window that looked out onto the valet and was great to people watch from. Our server came by right away but was quick to tell us she wasn't our server and he would probably be around in half an hour. She took our drink order and came back. I ordered my typical double shot raspberry mocha. Took a sip and there was NO raspberry and luke warm milk. . . yuck! I didn't complain and just made the best of it. Next she went over there new specials and breezed through the menu but was quick to point out that she thought the Pot Pie on the menu was gross and it's been sent back a lot. Even though we knew dinner was on our agenda we were completely turned off. She made some good suggestions and brought our cheesecake. Never saw our mystery server. The other appetizing part was watching the servers out of our large picture windows going to take their smoke breaks. . .that was hot! It wasn't a horrible experience but I think I'll stick to Happy Hour appetizers and take home cheesecake.
Leanne M.,"Anaheim, CA",4,43,2,2.0,1/7/2009,"I honestly don't know why I bother with this place. Turns out 3rd time is not a charm. There isn't really anything wrong with the food. And i think it's great that a place has a lunch menu on the weekends. Love the fact that I can get a personal sized pizza and a hefty salad combo for under $10 and it's more than enough to feed my 10-year-old sister and myself. So enough with the positivity. SERVICE. SUCKS. I mean, we didn't have to wait long to get a table, but after being seated, needing a moment for drinks, and then not being able to order our drinks for 15 mins, I couldn't get a straw to save my life!! I tried everything (and 3 waiters/waitresses) before giving up and stealing the straw out of my brother's lemonade. Seriously, how hard is a straw? That past us, we commence eating (20mins for food) and wait another 20 after getting the bill for our $$ to be collected and processed. Spent longer waiting on the (heh) waitstaff than actually eating. Don't go here if you're in a hurry!"
janice w.,"Irvine, CA",133,31,,4.0,9/23/2008,"i love the cheesecake factory!  (and i don't even like cheesecake.)  their menu is the most extensive i've ever seen, and despite the variety, almost everything is tasty and well-made.  the seared ahi salad is delicious, with the special dressing, and is surprisingly filling.  their shepherd's pie is so hearty and flavorful with the mashed potatoes inside.  and my all-time favorite is their chicken madeira over mashed potatoes.  the sauce they use is so rich, and the chicken is moist and cooked well; and their mashed potatoes with the skin are so creamy and delicious.  there's always so much to choose from, and i'm rarely disappointed.  the only downside is the wait, which is usually at least 20 minutes at the Spectrum.  and i always feel like i'm in Vegas with the over-the-top decor."
jill j.,"Irvine, CA",98,157,134,4.0,8/27/2008,"what's not to like when they have a menu that seems never-ending?! well, to me, it's not so much the food but the service and/or the wait. let's start off with a few selections that i find very tasty to the palate.  miso salmon (our fave ..mm...), cuban sandwich, shrimp scampi, wasabi crusted ahi tuna, kobe burger (huge!), grilled pork chops, godiva chocolate cheesecake.. and now for the downside.. service is a hit or miss (yes, definitely agree with my fellow yelpers). if your lucky, u get someone who will attend to your table like they are supposed to or you get the newb who's just working for the paycheck. then there's the long wait especially if you come in during lunch/dinner hours. refrain from getting your nerves frazzled and have a late lunch or early dinner instead."
Sean M.,"San Francisco, CA",81,477,8,2.0,6/14/2008,"We came here on the night before my daughter graduated from college, a little tired from a long drive down and very hungry. Opening the door, a wave of music and conversation, louder than even the fabled Abercrombie and Fitch ear drum bursting levels greated us. We let the 20 something greater know how many in our party, he told us it would be 20 minutes wait to get a pager an another 45 minutes to get a table. I was for bailing, but my party really wanted to come here. So, wandered around, spent even more money and finally was sitted in a booth. Shouting as loud as I could, I asked for some ice tea, the waitress said ""passion fruit?"" I said no, regular, she says ""passion fruit?"" I say, no ""black tea!!""  Oh, we don't have regular tea, only passion fruit. Okay water? Right, water.  My daughters got shirley temples and their mother and my sister got passion fruit ice tea, they give up easily. On to the pot stickers, okay, light and not greasy, sort of what PF Chang would make if the chefs were Thai and not Mexican, but I checked the chefs were hispanic. So, I stuck with (sometimes literally) with the pulled pork sandwich, one daughter got some fetticini alfredo, the other a salad, the other parties a pizza and some soup. Unfortunaly, the meal didn't come with night vision goggles, so I could barely see my kids, my food or the other guests. The food arrives and its fine, not great but heavy, heavy and ultimatly not tasty. The fetticini was old with the noodles almost as crispy as hong kong style noodles, clam chowder bland and thick with milk and potatoes, not a clam to be seen and in the salad, my daughter found a hair which the manager swore was corn silk from the salad bar that must have slipped in and wasn't detectible except to the touch. Finally, the moment of truth, the cheescake. It was not what I expected, after the meal that was so heavy, I could use it to work out on, the cheese cake was not so much cake as meringe, very light. The cream cheese flavor came out once I scrapped away the buick sized hunk of whipped cream away. It was okay, but California light when what I really craved was New York heavy and authentic. 120 bucks out the door, we escaped, or at least, me and my wallet escaped. Once at this place is enough for me."
Karen S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",164,182,101,2.0,1/10/2010,"for a huge chain restaurant, the way cheesecake factory operates when it's busy is wack with a capital w. i mean really, a line 20+ people deep just to put your name in to get a table? then the host tells us we have to come back in a half an hour to receive a pager. 30 minutes later i skip the still huge line to put your name in, and walk right up to the front where no one acknowledges me, so i just butt in and ask the host if i can have a pager yet. she tells me i was told 35 minutes and they still don't have any. no, i could hear, you told me 30. so i send a friend up to get the pager a second time so that i do not decapitate the ONE host they have working on a saturday night at 8pm. 10 minutes after that, a total of 50 minutes later, even though we were told the wait would be 40 minutes (hello, don't you know you should over quote people on their wait time so they don't get pissed off?) we are then told, and i quote to ""go stand in between the pillars and wait for your name to be called"". she didn't even say please! and as a crowd of people are standing idly in mass confusion and waiters are trying to push their way through with food that needs to be delivered, we can hear several other people discussing how they were told to ""go stand on the black tile"". since when did it become cheesecake procedure to heard people into the middle of the restaurant after they have been paged to wait AGAIN to be sat? finally someone yells the name of our party, and if it couldn't get any worse, the girl who is seating us doesn't even come over, she just puts her hand in the air and motions for us to follow her. i just about died. we are sat at the first available table, outside of course, and right by the cabinet where dirty dishes are thrown, making a loud clanking noise every couple of minutes. fortunately, and the only reason i am not giving this location one star, our waiter johnny was hilarious, and absolutely accommodating. he even informed us that our table had been open for almost 30 minutes and no one had sat him. come on cheesecake, you really need to get your shit together."
mel m.,"Danville, CA",37,115,59,2.0,4/25/2009,"so i figured i'd try the cheesecake factory again tonight. my first experience was awful. but i figured maybe i was being too hard because of the lack of service at the other one. now i'm sitting here still trying to figure out what the big deal about this place is. i ordered the pulled pork sandwich. by far the most disgusting pork sandwich i've ever ate. or should i say, tried to eat. it looked amazing. then two bites into it i nearly gagged on the chewy fat. i figured i'd better make sure there weren't anymore big bites of fat. i expected to find a little more fat. what i wasn't expecting was to have to take apart my entire sandwich and find myself with more fat on my plate than actual meat (you know, that gooey, jiggly kind of fat). at this point i was still hoping i could enjoy the little bit that was left of my sandwich. but no. on the next bite i nearly choked on a piece of bone. when the waitress asked if i wanted a box i said i would take the fries but that the sandwich was awful. then, instead of offering me something else she brings back my sandwich in a box to go. i explained again that it was disgusting but she still wasn't getting it. the only reason i'm giving 2 stars is because the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake was to die for."
karen k.,"Irvine, CA",2,74,,4.0,6/24/2008,"never been to cheesecake until a few friends suggested it.  im a big fan of the drinks and desserts, cant seem to get enough of the strawberry martini, cosmo, mai tai, pina colada, malibu colada and of course the desserts.  yes im an alcoholic lol and the food is pretty good too."
