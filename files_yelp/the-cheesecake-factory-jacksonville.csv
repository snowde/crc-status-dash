Phil F.,"Vaughan, Canada",56,93,188,4.0,11/29/2017,The charm that accompanied the cheesecake Factory is not what it used to be but the restaurants never disappoint .   Service is always excellent and extremely Consistent across all locations.  Food is always served hot and fresh.   Classics and favourites tastes the same at each location and the Jacksonville restaurant doesn't disappoint.  Surprisingly enough I didn't get a piece of cheesecake again! Portions are just way too big to leave any room For desert! Value for your dollar is great but you may want to tone down the meal sizes.  I'll be back!
Tiffany B.,"Tallahassee, FL",38,58,30,3.0,12/14/2017,"Let me start by saying I have been to a lot of Cheesecake Factory restaurants all over the country.  We don't have one where I live so I always go when I see one traveling. We went on a Wednesday night @6. 20 min wait, which is not unusual. When we were seated I was a little taken back by all the empty seats.  Then we are seated almost on top of a family with kids.  Now it's not the restaurants fault that the kids were unruly, jumping around and kept hitting us, but there were plenty of other open tables we could have been seated at. When the waitress finally came, which took a while, we were ready to order drinks. When she came back we ordered fried mac and cheese. The appetizer came before the drinks. The mac and cheese is always good. I ordered the sweet corn tamales, which were ok.  Corn flavor but not much else. My daughter ordered the steak and cheese, which she enjoyed. I normally love the miso salmon but I decided to try something else this time and wouldn't order it again. There are a lot of other restaurants in the area that I would try before coming back. Prices have also gone up,  which is unfortunate because it was already pricy."
Dottie T.,"Tallahassee, FL",29,48,116,2.0,12/9/2017,"I have to say I was highly disappointed in the cheesecake factory. I've gone several times and the food is extremely inconsistent. I'm really hoping that in the future the shifts will be trained to produce consistent food. That said the first time I went there my pasta dish was incredible. The second time I went expecting the same thing it was absolutely horrible and I sent it back which I never do. I didn't have a big problem with our waiter but my daughter had to ask for things multiple times and that was a little frustrating as she won't need it until it's exactly the way she wants it. The second time the waitress was wonderful and it wasn't her fault that the chef wasn't trained well. The cheesecakes are always beautiful and while not house made quality still tasty.  In short, if you're willing to gamble you may get really nice dinner."
Virginia M.,"Jacksonville, FL",216,867,301,4.0,1/6/2018,"This is one of the OGs of chain restaurants that is still going strong. They have ridiculously high caloric dishes (not including the cheesecake) that are super tasty as well as cocktails. My out of town friends always want to come here despite my suggestions for something more local, but we have a nice time catching up. They do however have a counter where you can order cheesecakes to go, which is a great invention. I found myself wandering around the town center in the cold and thought it would be a good idea to stop in and grab 2 slices of cheesecake, which I may of had 1 for breakfast.  I went with the classic cheesecake with cherry topping. Very delicious!"
Trang V.,"Jacksonville, FL",105,66,389,3.0,11/15/2017,"I've been to Cheesecake factory on and off for the past 7-8 years. Usually is to celebrate birthdays, anniversary or Valentine's. I haven't found a dish that I truly love yet because the food is just mediocre. The salad is small and bland, the salmon dish I had last time was under-seasoned as well. The servers are usually very busy because it's a huge restaurant so our guy only checked up on us one or twice at my last dining experience. I really love the atmosphere and decor because everything is tall and fancy. But I definitely will not come here for the food their cheesecake is quite good but overpriced."
Jennifer O.,"Jacksonville, FL",185,19,14,5.0,1/5/2018,"I am very impressed with this rating, because I normally have to send back any and everything I get from Cheesecake Factory. I decided to give them one more try since I am pretty big on reviews. The herb crusted salmon is so delicious I couldn't even finish the plate. I don't know if you ever heard of the saying, ""the food is good, if you get full pretty fast"" (it's an island ting). That saying was the reflection of my meal. The salmon was juice and well seasoned. The citrus sauce on the plate was extra delicious with a dab of salt and pepper. I recommend everyone try this dish, if you're into seafood."
Brittany O.,"Tampa, FL",64,18,3,1.0,1/8/2018,"I ordered a salad with crusted salmon for takeout Saturday night.  My order was prepared with dairy, even after I mentioned I couldn't have any dairy over the phone.  I was told it could be remade, but the wait would take awhile, because they were slammed!  I took my order anyway, had to take the entire piece of salmon out of the salad (because it was covered in dairy) and basically had to eat dressing and lettuce.  I heard great things about their salads before ordering, but was not happy with my experience!"
Son N.,"Jacksonville, FL",115,101,222,4.0,10/8/2017,"The waiting can be hectic during peak times. But other than that, the food is great. Service is good. The atmosphere is friendly and nice. Highly recommended!"
Elysia C.,"Jacksonville, FL",110,257,402,3.0,6/26/2017,We stopped in for lunch while shopping in the Town Center. We were seated right away and the server brought over water and drinks and bread (I love the bread so much here).  We ordered a cheese pizza for our son and I ordered the Chicken Avocado Club while my husband ordered the regular club.  They brought our son's pizza first which I appreciated. More restaurants should do this. Kids aren't patient and they also eat slower from my experience than adults. I took a bite of the pizza and it was very good.  My chicken club arrived and it was ridiculously huge. Three slices of tomato and lots of lettuce. There is no way you can easily eat this without it falling apart. I removed two slices of tomato and most of the lettuce then enjoyed my sandwich. It was good...not great but good. The bread it was on was the highlight of the sandwich (but I'm a bread girl so...). My husband's club was very good but the portions here are known to be huge and this one was the same. After eating a quarter of it he was full. Both sandwiches came with their delicious fries.  This is a great option to get out of the heat and have a nice lunch. Service was spotty as my pet peeve is when we have to wait for our check it has become the norm with many restaurants lately and I'm not a fan.
Rich N Mechelle C.,"Opelika, AL",50,66,158,2.0,12/31/2017,"Just not that good anymore. The cheesecake saves this place. The food us mediocre to not good. Always crowded tho, is in Town Center of course. Staff is overwhelmed, never got refills and took forever to get check and leave. Will go to any drive thru next time for same foid, quucker"
Nicole J.,"Orange Park, FL",18,109,243,3.0,10/3/2017,"I am torn between 3 stars and 4, so let me explain.  It is a good restaurant to start.  We had drinks at the bar while waiting for our table to be ready. They give you an estimated time, but it is so extremely busy that we were waiting much longer than the expected time.  My Whiskey Smash was perfect.  The bartenders were attentive and precise.   When we were finally seated,  the usual happened, drink orders, then dinner orders, then bread. We were given very polite, attentive, and well mannered servers who deserve a 5 star review alone.   But it took a long time time get our food.  For as large as the restaurant is and for as busy as it is, I would expect them to have adequate staffing in the kitchen, but it didn't seem so on this night.   Cheesecake Factory has a humongous menu, with very few vegetarian choices.  Obviously one of them being salad.   When I did receive my food it was perfect.  I ordered Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes.  I had not had them in 7 years, and they were just as delicious as I remember!  The presentation was pretty.   After being there for more than two hours I was very ready to go, but I found out that when you are with a larger party, everyone has to be completely done ordering everything before they can split checks.  So I had to wait even longer.  I would definitely visit again, those corn cakes are mouth watering, but it will probably be a while."
Edward A.,"Jacksonville, FL",178,264,1545,4.0,3/15/2017,"For a chain, this place does a good job. Service from our waiter Steve was excellent as he was always checking on us and was very personable. The things I like: - Extensive menu - lots of choices - Menu provides calories for each meal - Complimentary unlimited bread with your meal - Great service - Overall a nice restaurant for ambiance - It's HUGE - Portions are huge Things I don't like: - Extensive menu - TOO many choices - can they really do EVERYTHING well? Quality has to suffer somewhere - Menu provides calories for each meal - kinda makes you feel guilty to order anything to eat. I saw some menu items with close to 2000 calories - that's a day's worth of food - They do have a skinny menu and that's a good thing - better portion control - Location/parking - being that I'm not a big fan of the Town Center set up - I get it, I'm not their target demographic - I don't really enjoy coming any where near this shopping center. - The biggest issue I have is they don't take reservations! I get it as this place doesn't need to. For a random Tuesday evening, this place was steadily full. Our quoted 20 minute wait ended up being 5 minutes so that was a big plus. Our food was good but nothing extraordinary. The table had chicken caeser salad, a Mexican tortilla salad from the skinny menu, egg roll sampler, and some glazed beets which I personally did enjoy (by myself - because no one else wanted any). While we don't frequent CF, we came to use a gift card and overall was a pleasant experience."
Terry A.,"Jacksonville, FL",92,92,410,4.0,3/14/2017,"We have always had great service here, and the food is good, with plenty of choices, as the menu is huge.  Our waiter, Steve, was excellent, very attentive, knowledgeable, friendly and the food came out quickly.  We would visit more often, but it is always packed, and they don't take reservations so the hour to hour and a half wait is a deterrent.  I ordered the Mexican tortilla salad off of their skinnylicious menu which was flavorful and very large, for only 540 calories, it was awesome! Too full to try one of their many desserts. The atmosphere is nice, low lighting is great for date night!"
Durrant S.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,3,19,3.0,10/6/2017,"This is my second favorite go to place for dessert, ""Five F(x) Ice Cream & Taiyaki"" takes first place. Their key lime cheesecake gives the ""Key West Key Lime Pie Company"" a good run for their money. On another note, for dinner, they serve the best Grilled Pork Chop I've ever tasted. Minus 1 star due to very inconsistent and sometimes lacking customer service. Minus another star due to the inability to place a call in order for dessert (especially since they are usually crowded and sometimes I just want dessert to go)."
Bryan R.,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",11,235,155,2.0,5/9/2017,This was our first time at the Cheesecake Factory and was really looking forward to it. We were surprisingly disappointed. My wife and mother in-law had the filet minion and it was extremely salty. I tried it and it was overpowering. The vegetables appeared to be frozen and not fresh.   I had the pasta and it was okay. The cheesecake itself was very good.  We tried it but don't think we would go back.
Alyssa P.,"Jacksonville, FL",164,213,1173,4.0,1/24/2017,"Prior to tonight, I've only placed order carryout orders but we dined in today because it was my daughter's birthday. She loves cheesecakes so this was the place she picked for her birthday dinner.  When I did carryout, it was usually in the late evenings and I thought to myself, when I this place never packed? Apparently around 5 pm. We were able to get a table with no problems. Even when we left at 6 something, it wasn't busy. Probably avoid late evenings or weekends to avoid the crowd. Their menu is large, perhaps too big. It's hard for an indecisive person like myself to pick. I ended up ordering the Santa Fe salad. It was good and huge. I was only able to eat half of it. Wished I had requested the dressing on the side bc everything was coated with the vinaigrette. My oldest ordered the pasta carbonara and hubby ordered the shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo. Both were delicious. The birthday girl ordered a spaghetti and meatball from the kids menu but barely touched it, she was probably only there for the dessert.  Their cheesecakes are good but can be super rich. Their red velvet, original with strawberry, and white chocolate and raspberry truffle are probably my favorites. My daughter picked the oreo dream extreme cheesecake and that was way too rich. They do not offer complimentary birthday desserts, but did write Happy Birthday on the cheesecake, put a candle on it and sang to which was nice.  I purchased a $25 giftcard during the Holidays and received two ""slice of joy"" certificates for cheesecakes which was a really good deal considering the cost of cheesecake is around $8. Seems like they run this promo annually.  Prices are moderate but portions are fairly large depending on what you order. Service was really good. I didn't realize they have a brunch menu and would go back to give it a try."
Jeff W.,"Jacksonville, FL",63,144,369,4.0,1/15/2017,Not bad we come here often and really don't have any issues most the time. I usually stick with several options here the chicken parm sandwich or the Louisiana chicken pasta. My wife tried the chicken carbonara which was good the chicken in it was bland but the rest of the dish will make you feel like you ate a bulb of garlic. That and the bacon over powered the dish itself I would say less garlic and bacon and season the chicken better.      Service is never a problem they are attentive. This place is always an option for lunch or dinner. But I'll stick to what I know is good here.
Teresa C.,"Jacksonville, FL",27,136,125,1.0,10/17/2017,"I've been to this location a handful of times. It's always busy and there is always a wait. Make sure your entire party is present or they will just leave them out all together. Most of the staff is helpful and friendly. However, there is a female working the hostess station that is unpleasant. I've had a run in with her before and she did a good job of keeping her name out of the mix. Asked for a manager only to be given a business card. If you have a terrible experience before getting seated, then it's not going to be a good time. I left with my family because she refused to seat us. We were meeting a large group for a birthday. We specifically told them we would join them for dessert. The party made room for us, but the hostess insisted that we cannot be seated or served along with them. She didn't offer a solution even though the table next to our party even watched the event and offered us their table as they were finished. Being thoroughly upset, we opted to leave in which she was more than happy to smile and say bye in the most condicending way.  I will not return to this location. They really do not care for your business as there are people lined up out the door anyway. It's sad really, because my son really likes it there. I've been to other locations where we've had a wonderful time and the staff has been amazing. Luckily there are tons of other options. No one should be treated like this anywhere. Especially when you have two hungry boys in tow."
Tevin B.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,12,7,2.0,11/22/2017,"The staff are okay but could be better considering the prices. The food is definitely worth it, some think it's pricey but it depends on what you get. BEWARE of the bare prices as the drinks are the proceeds of entrees ! The manger is not sincere at all and talks to you as if your stupid..."
Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",387,1093,4867,4.0,10/18/2016,"We've been to this Cheesecake Factory a few times and it's always the same.  It's always the same at any Cheesecake Factory in fact.  They are so standard across the board it's almost scary to think they can live up to their high standards just about anywhere and maintain it so perfectly. My key dish at this place has been the Hibachi steak for quite some time.  I've had it in so many places now I've lost count.  It's made just as good here as just about any other place I've had it.   The service again just like all the other restaurants in this golden standard of chains is just as good.  I can't say I've ever been disappointed at the food or service at any Cheesecake Factory, this one included. Being in the Town Center there's a lot of choices to eat here but to me, TCF is one of those staples that I'm happy to have at just about every higher end shopping center in every city (Tyson's Corner VA, Aventura FL, Galleria in Buffalo NY, John Hancock Center in Chicago etc). While the bread is good, it's a trap.  Don't get full from it.  The appetizers are huge so share if you even consider getting it.  Don't be greedy on your main because you can take it with you if you want to leave room for dessert and if you don't leave room just get a slice of one of the many cheesecakes to go.  Options... use them."
April R.,"Jacksonville, FL",45,32,3,3.0,10/11/2017,Not going to be the best or fanciest place. Big portions of okay food. Really don't go for food just cheesecake. Oh and don't read the calories just enjoy the cheesecake you deserve it. Service can be slow so don't be in a hurry if you are dining in. The music is also always really loud like sometimes difficult to talk to person at same table.
Matt J.,"Jacksonville, FL",33,117,106,4.0,4/22/2017,"A factory for cheesecake, we are truly in the future now.  Cheesecake has everything on their menu from Ahi tuna to Zucchini fries. Some of my favorite dishes are the jambalaya over rice and the steak Diane / chicken Madeira combination entree. I have dabbled into other dishes from time to time like the enchiladas or the meatloaf, but the ones I mentioned before are my go to meals. The entrees all range from not so great to really freakin good, but because of that broad range of quality between dishes I sometimes leave unsatisfied. Now this isn't saying you can't find your perfect entree among the 20 page menu, I would be impressed if you can't find something you like.  The menu is the standout feature of cheesecake just because there is almost too much to choose from and if you end up getting past their massive entrees, you have two pages of cheesecake flavors to choose from. The cheesecake is also perfect every time. I'm not a big sweets type of guy, but their cheesecake is actually a great way to end a meal.  The decor is really nice with a huge painted ceiling and romantic lighting. The service is mostly top notch and I can't recall a bad experience. Besides some of the dishes hitting some low points, the Cheesecake Factory has an impressive menu and once you find your go to dish you are set."
Garrett P.,"Jacksonville, FL",67,11,27,4.0,10/8/2017,I love this place. We waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated at 5 on a Friday. Not bad. I started with a Long Island at like 12 bucks a pop but going here you should know it's going to be a little pricey. They gave us our bread and such. My wife eats way to much of it as always. She got some Chinese salad and I had the Cajun pasta. Our daughter got a kids portion of spaghetti and meat balls. Which was huge for a 8 month old our waiter was great very attentive. The biggest problem I have with this place is the seating. I felt like the couple next to us should have been on our bill they were so close. All in all very enjoyable experience.
Cheala M.,"Jacksonville, FL",160,67,142,4.0,2/25/2017,I can't believe as many times as I've been here I've yet to give them a review. While on the pricey side I would definitely say that The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite go to restaurant. Whether I want comfort food or healthier options I know they have what I'm looking for. It may take you a while to find parking or some time to get seated but once you're in it'll all be worth it.  They may be famous for their nice and creamy Cheesecake but I must admit the cooks know their way around a bacon cheese burger. That first bite just melts away all cares in the world and your only focus is savoring the flavor of their juicy burger.  Don't even get me started on their Steaks. Regardless of how you like your steaks cooked I would definitely say that you won't be disappointed. Every bite is like a party on your taste buds.  My favorite Cheesecake will have to be the original and of course the Turtle Cheesecake. Every bite melts away all worries and doesn't make you feel bad about those extra pounds you're trying to work off. It'll make you work harder just to enjoy another slice of their delicious cheesecake.
Jon M.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",25,28,32,5.0,9/23/2017,"Stopped in for lunch today, placed was packed, but we only waited 5 minutes to be seated ? Wish it was like that every time. Started off with their famous bread ! Ordered the crab bites for starters, scrumptious little bites of crab. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp over Linguini(normally Rice), thank you to the kitchen staff for that ! My wife had the Chicken Parm sandwich, they left off the peppers. My son ordered the kids Salmon, he loved it !! But the mashed potatoes looked like they had been sitting for quite awhile and were cold along with the broccoli. Small hiccups, but all in all a good lunch. Love the Factory ! Oreo Madness and Celebration Cake to go...."
Danielle M.,"Jacksonville, FL",96,116,215,4.0,7/20/2017,"I know It's wrong to complain abut a menu being TOO extensive, but I swear that CF menus are bigger than a phone book They are always crazy busy and don't take reservations, so seating is slow but you already know this before you arrive. Our service here has always been friendly and flawless, the food always arrives hot, is always tasty and well seasoned, my order is always accurate and any special requests my party have are always followed. Portion sizes are generous and carb-heavy, so if you any have room for cheesecake afterwards it'll be a miracle.  Thankfully you can get a slice to go."
Linda V.,"Jacksonville, FL",64,307,785,5.0,1/18/2017,"You know...I didnt want to go here for lunch because it has been so fattening! BUT now they have a Skinny menu with meals under 490 calories and such! Perfect! I ordered the skinny burger with salad and was very pleased! I don't need a 12-16oz burger at no time in my life so this size fit the bill and appetite. Friend got chicken lettuce tacos (3) and they looked great. Others got the Asian salad, soup/sandwich, just soup; all left full and content! I'm glad Cheesecake Factory had added this menu!"
Maryam O.,"Jacksonville, FL",186,67,170,3.0,4/4/2017,"I have been to this place many times and I am a big fan of their extensive food variety, large portions and great taste but this was the first time I tried their breakfast menu. I ordered the Farm Fresh Egg on a bagel with the Caramel Royale Macchiato. The bagel was a little stale and the side potatoes not very fresh, and the eggs were very bland. The Macchiato deserves to be praised though; (it is VERY sweet) so make sure you keep that in mind when ordering. Next time I come to The Cheesecake Factory, it will be for lunch and dinner. I don't think I want to give their breakfast food another try."
Katie W.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,131,48,4.0,3/27/2017,"For my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory I enjoyed the sausage and ricotta flatbread and a piece of the Adams peanut butter cup cheesecake. Service was good, food was good, and prices were reasonable. Being at the town center is a great location since you can take a walk after dinner to some of the stores. I definitely will be back to try some of their other offerings!"
David L.,"Charleston, SC",122,50,186,4.0,11/16/2016,"Years since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory. I had the Cuban sandwich -- very good! The pork was very tender and the bread they used was pressed and toasted perfectly. I couldn't leave the place without having cheesecake. I had the Godiva chocolate cheesecake...awesome! It's so rich, it could be split between two people. I was there during happy hour and the place had a good vibe. I didn't take advantage of their happy hour menu, but I will next time."
Scott B.,"Gainesville, FL",11,104,92,4.0,7/2/2016,This is my first time to this place. It was so busy on Saturday night. We reserved a table for 20 but still had to wait about 30 minutes for our table. Once we were seated the servers did a pretty good job. However our food took a while to come out. I had the Santa Fe chicken salad which sounded real good but I have had much better from other places. I don't think I would ever order it again.  Everyone else in my group really enjoyed their food. I wish I would have had something else but I wanted to save room for cheesecake.  Most of us had cheesecake for desert. I shared the 30th anniversary cheesecake with my wife. It was one of the best that I've had.
Cynthia D.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,5.0,10/28/2017,"Today was one of the best experiences I've ever had dining out. Not only was the food, drinks and desserts awesome, but so was our waiter James G. He was so professional and attentive to us and kept a smile on his face at all times. We celebrated my eleven year old daughter birthday and she definitely left with a full stomach and a smile. I am a firm believer that a restaurant is as good as those who represent it. Kudos to James G, you're the best!!! My family and I thank you for a fantastic experience. Cynthia D"
Kayleigh T.,"Orange Park, FL",0,10,,4.0,8/6/2017,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars for my latest visit is because the manager stopped my friend, who was with my boyfriend and I, when we were called for a party of 3, asking him if he was with us. I don't understand why he was even stopped, we were all waiting together and he walked in with me when we put our name on the list. It was extremely unprofessional. Our server was great and attentive even with them being extremely busy. The appetizer was amazing and our food came out hot and was delicious. Our server topped our dishes off with fresh cheese. He kept our drinks topped off and we got our cheesecake slices in a timely manner to go with our checks.  The Cheesecake Factory is my boyfriend's favorite restaurant and we really were taken aback by the manager stopping our friend on the way to be seated, we have never experienced something like this when going out with friends and having an odd number."
Your Worst Nightmare ..,"Jacksonville, FL",10,59,7,5.0,7/9/2017,Its been a couple of years since we've been to cheesecake factory.   We decided to give it a try today since there were no lines waiting outside the door.   I had the lunch portion of the four cheese pasta which tasted amazing.  I hate to see what the dinner portion looked like because I couldn't finish what i had.  The sauce with the ricotta cheese in the center was right the amount and when mixed in with parmesan cheese on top made this dish a hit.  Next I had the Adams peanutbutter  cheesecake....YUMMY.  I'm a big peanut butter fan and this didn't last long at the table.
Kristof R.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",27,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,"We reserved a table 7 hours before arrival for 10 people; they made us wait 55 minutes! Ridiculously expensive for the quality of the food, I'd rank it with Chilis maybe or worse. Never again..."
Linda V.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",0,4,8,5.0,10/25/2017,"You can never go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory . This is one of my favorite places to go to catch up with girlfriends. Although there may be a wait, it is always worth it . Five stars !"
Charles L.,"Gainesville, FL",6,34,7,3.0,10/1/2017,The food was good but the kitchen was backwards. The dinner came out first and about 5 min later the appetizer came. Drink refills where slow the desserts where Great but for what we paid the experience was lacking! This is the second time we have come from Gainesville Fl and have had a bad experience. The Cheesecake Factory in Orlando was much better!
Kelly M.,"Jacksonville, FL",175,184,337,5.0,11/9/2016,"This is a chain that I could go to every week.  The luau salad is everything.  Sometimes the wait is pretty long, but if you go just at the right time, you can get right in.  The one thing I like, of course besides the cheesecake, is that there is a large selection, even for the pickiest person."
Fuarosa A.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,24,25,3.0,9/25/2017,"My husband and I love Cheesecake Factory, but this particular one kind of was a let down. Service was great, we were seated right away & our server was very attentive. I could say otherwise for my meal. One of our favorites from the restaurant is their bread. We had 3 rounds of bread, they were either burnt or hard. I ordered my usual, fettuccini alfredo with shrimp. The alfredo sauce was runny and the shrimp was dry & I found some that were stuck together. Not sure how that happens but I was surely disappointed. My husband's order, on the other hand, tasted 10x better than what I had and it was spaghetti and meatballs. It won't be a last visit, but I will be definitely taking notes on the entrees I order from now on."
Victoria D.,"Jacksonville, FL",31,93,126,4.0,3/16/2017,"I am a fan of the Cheesecake factory.  We stopped in after getting Hubs phone serviced at the Apple Store. There was a big ol' line to be seated and I was really in the mood for some suga NOW. Luckily they have a counter where you can just order what you want and take it out with you. So that is what we did.  The service was friendly and efficient.  We ordered the Classic Cheesecake, a slice with strawberries on top and a slice of the Limoncello cake.  The cheesecake was pretty good. I love cheesecake so all cheesecake is nice. But this isn't the best I've had. Also the Lemon cake was a *tad* dry for my liking.  I am looking forward to returning for the actual dining experience and the banana foster cheesecake."
