John S.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,26,1,3.0,5/25/2015,Great food and great service!  I know of places to get the same caliber of food for cheaper prices though.  I really don't like that if you are a party of two they sit you at tables where you feel uncomfortably close to the patrons that are seated next to you.  The menu is huge and diverse so if you usually have difficulty deciding what you want to order I would recommend pulling up their menu before you go.  I would have give this review 4 stars but the seating arrangements are big deal for me.
M C.,"Jacksonville, FL",43,31,35,5.0,2/22/2014,"Ok, here's the review from the night before!  As it turned out, the wait really wasn't too long.. About 15 mins.  We asked to sit on the patio and got a great waitress - ""Samantha"".  She was VER attentive but not up our butt.  We had a couple Firefly martinis, and had crab cakes as well as the  guacamole.  All were just fine.  We had cheesecake for desert - who goes to Cheesecake Factory and doesn't have cheesecake? So we had, Keylime Cheesecake, and the Anniversary Cheesecake.  Samantha was excellent and made our visit really nice."
Shawm C.,"Garner, NC",1,8,4,1.0,9/25/2011,"Overbearing smell of propane gas as soon as you enter- 1st bad clue I shouldn't have stayed and eaten here. I ordered the California omelet because of the avocado, mushrooms, tomatoes and cheeses in it. Guess what?! After four bites, NO avocado! I had to ask our server to bring a few slices. I also ordered coffee and a diet coke. Coffee came, no coke. I didn't even bother asking because they think they're ssooo with it by not writing anything down. Asked for salt - don't bother- it's like they poured water in there with it. It all comes down to management not  being on top of things. I've been to many Cheesecake Factory locations across the country, and this by far is the only bad, terrible one. Not ever going back to this location."
Michael W.,"Orlando, FL",159,180,294,4.0,8/5/2011,"Came with my family first time in Jax and second with my friends Food:  Great beef ribs,  good burger,  amazing avocado egg roll,  great crab artichoke dip -    5/5 Service -  the wait to sit was ridiculous sometimes, they could not clean up fast enough . However - great waitress and waiter-  no complain  -  refill water and check on you promptly    4/5 Atmosphere -  its too loud - u have to talk really loud especially when the restaurant is packed. Sometimes I do feel like it jammed back too cluster  3/5  - however it is theme decently and good ambience Overall - great food - consistent service and consistent food -  word of advice to Cheesecake factory - remove any food item that has to do with Taco - it sucks! everyone knows that and they wont order them! replace it with something else.. thnks"
Keely P.,"Jacksonville, FL",13,94,91,4.0,2/17/2014,"Big menu, tons of options..my only complaint is sometimes the service and if they are super busy, the cheesecakes come right out of the cooler and can be super cold in the middle.. the food quality is typically top notch though! The Ahi Carpaccio is one of my fav dishes anywhere!"
K S.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,5,,1.0,4/15/2014,"Their cheesecake is always good, but I really just can't go there for dinner anymore.  They are overpriced for the quality you get. I've been disappointed too many times. Honestly BJ's Brewhouse in town center has some similar items but is much MUCH better.  I think Cheesecake Factory is Applebee's kinda quality with twice the price. The service is average at best."
Kara P.,"Reading, PA",31,18,,1.0,2/6/2013,"Super loud. It took forever for us to get seated and when we did, it took forever for us to get served. I tried to make sure I ordered something semi-healthy since the food here is kinda horrible for you, so I ordered the skinny burger with no buttered bun, a slice of cheese and a salad instead of fries with the dressing on the side. They brought me just a plain burger on a buttered bun (really? why do I need butter with a hamburger? America, man.) and plain salad. They did bring me out a slice of cheese when I asked and offered to have it melted for me, but by that point I was so done here and wanted to just go. Cheesecake is always good so maybe I'll just go here once every six years for a piece of that."
Jay B.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,29,1,4.0,4/15/2013,"I only go to Cheesecake Factory for Sunday brunch (they open at 10a on Sundays). Their brunch menu, while small, is packed with great items. Their coffee is excellent and there is rarely a wait."
Donna Y.,"Jacksonville, FL",46,326,939,5.0,4/25/2009,"Wow! Incredibly GINORMOUS menu with a 4-5 star twist on your favorites.  Altho this is a chain store you will find no matter what state you're in the Cheesecake factory has high standards, great service and a very courteous staff. We've been to ones in Oklahoma City and near Dayton and have not been disappointed at all.  Try the ahi carpaccio for an appetizer. It's a thinly sliced ahi tartar with a wasabi pesto, creamy avocado and togarashi aiolo. Mmmmmm!!! One of our favs is the fried macaroni and cheese - a crunchy fried breading on the outside with a creamy mac & cheese center  4 larger than golfball sized delights sitting on top of a light tomato saucy pesto. The Kobe burgers are soooo tender! Daughter and I have ordered the fried mac & cheese and kobe burgers and split both so we'd have enough room left for cheesecake later.  The miso salmon is my fav - sweet miso glazed salmon placed on top of an island of white rice decorated with snow peas and dots of miso sauce circling another creamy pool of white sauce. Awesome and light! Ask for a lunch portion. Or if you're famished ask for the dinner portion. Hubby ordered a seared tuna tataki salad  which is seared albacore tuna served rare with avocado, tomatoes and mixed greens  with a wasabi vinegarette. Mmmmmm!   Always a pleasure to rubberneck as wait staff quickly sweep by with armfulls of piled high salads and meals and ""just rub on your thigh"" cheesecakes topped with billowy whipped cream. And speaking of cheesecake, take your pick of 35 spectacular flavors! Favs are Godiva cheesecake, tuxedo, white choco macadamia and Choco peanut butter cookie dough! Just don't let the waiter take all of the menus away -- ya gotta plan which one of those cheesecakes you're going to have after you're done with the meal!"
Will K.,"Marathon, FL",12,21,36,4.0,12/1/2013,"Beneath all the glitz and glimmer there is a true restaurant at work here! Plenty of vegan offers and great salmon. Full bar with fun staff. My favorite cheesecake is the godiva, so decadent you cant eat the whole piece ; )"
Renee G.,"Middleburg, FL",1,8,,5.0,2/2/2015,Steak Diane best thing on menu with side of onion rings then for dessert chocolate mousse cheesecake
Bill K.,"Jacksonville, FL",98,376,419,4.0,12/15/2012,"We went to The Cheesecake Factory (TCF) for dinner last night, only because my wife loves their Chicken Maderia and when my wife is happy all is well with the world. I'm not a big fan of TCF but I will endure it for her. So we get there and park nowhere near the enterance, but maybe a 15 minute walk away which is not bad for the Town Center. We finally fight our way to the hostess booth (like salmon fighting to get upstream) and are told its a 45 minute wait. Now I usually don't hardly ever wait but ""somebody"" who shall remain nameless gave me a look that said ""Were Waiting"" so we waited. Went into the bar area and actually found 2 seats at the bar next to each olther and ordered drinks, A Mai Tai for the missus and a craft beer for me. I was then informed that TCF doesn't have any craft beers on tap or anywhere. The bartender said that the closet they had was a Sierra Nevada which didn't taste too bad, but still not what I really wanted. The tab for that was $17 which to me is ridiculous for 1 Mai Tai and an average bottled beer. Finally 1/2 hr later our pager goes off and were lead to a really small table in the back and wait for our server, (who was fantastic BTW) and ordered 2 iced teas and an order of Onion rings to munch on. Along with my wifes Chicken Maderia  and my (server recommended) Mahi Mediterrainian, The Onion rings arrived and truth be told they were the best Onion Rings I have ever eaten, I just wish they had some/any sauce that accompanied them other than catsup, like most other places do. The food arrives in a timely manner and it's, it's uasual great tasting self. Then my wife gets a Vanilla Bean slice of Cheesecake and some hot fudge on the side and immediately slips into her ""I am now officially happy mode"" and everything is all right with the world in general."
Shawn L.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,122,37,3.0,10/28/2011,"3.5 stars for this location I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory. I tend to look for them while in a new city for business or personal. This location was nestled in to a high end shopping center with a nice patio. It was an amazing 74 degrees on this October day when a friend and I enjoyed our lunch outside. The Good --- Hostess was friendly and was spot on for how long of a wait we had. She told us 8 mins tops and well I kinda laughed with my buddy and ...8 mins later we were seated. Nothing worse than walking into a place and being told it will only be a couple mins....20 mins later your still waiting. So very good job Cheesecake factory. Food is always great. I have ordered many things and I still have not found anything I dont like. This day I had the Steak Diane and Shrimp scampi combo and my friend had the chicken medeira. Both meals were Hot and tasty.  The OK ---- Waitress was friendly, but with that said... we hardly ever saw her. My buddy could of used a refill a couple times and I was drinking  a Large Blue Moon, so I decided to sip slowly because I didnt want to be out of a drink. Maybe it was because we were on the patio...Not sure. Also, when the food came ....the little extras that one would request were not able to....for at least 5mins into having the food. It was dropped off my kitchen helper? waitress was MIA. The Bad---- Only thing I think is bad about this place is the temptation to have some cheesecake...lol God knows Its not in my diet....got 10lbs more to lose."
Alan K.,"Orange Park, FL",5,13,,2.0,3/20/2013,"Service was not great. Did not see our server most of the night until it was time to get the bill. Food was so so, nothing to brag about. I hope it was just an off night but will need to think twice before wanting to try a return visit."
Jeff K.,"Saddle River, NJ",323,302,33,4.0,6/7/2010,"It's hard to go wrong with the cheesecake factory. They have a little bit of every type of food. Even if your selection turned out to be not as expected, you will always get a second chance to redeem yourself when it comes time to select your cheesecake.  Luckily my select of the shrimp scampi & Steak Diane combo was excellent. I was so full that I amazingly skipped cheesecake! That was a first."
Ryan R.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,2/14/2015,"Had an absolute terrible experience tonight at this restaurant. My wife and I waited over 2 hours in the cold for a meal that was sloppy by any standard. My burger was burnt to a crisp when it arrived, and my wife's shrimp had greasy, oily batter just falling apart. She also ordered a smaller portion of soup than what she got and charged us for. The only upside was the quality of our waitress. I will never bring my wife there again. They simply can not handle an extremely busy service. Shame"
Adam H.,"Jacksonville, FL",69,49,6,2.0,7/27/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory at St. Johns Town Center seems to be the hot hang out for loud obnoxious youth. The location is downtown Chicago is awesome, and my wife and I still reminess on our dining experience there. The one here is so freakin loud I could barely hear myself think. Don't get me wrong, CF is good...at cheesecake, real food, eh not so much. The cheesecake is great, and you couldn't ask for more variety. Appetizers prove to be on par as well, love the crab cakes. Unfortantely, I just cannot get a decent entree at CF. My wife waited over 30 minutes for a burger! We were informed it was overcooked, but  once her's arrived it was super rare. The accompanying fries and my New Orleans shrimp entree must have sat waiting under heat lamps while the cook attempted to fail at making a freaking burger. Fries were gross cold and my rice had formed a nice dry shell on top. I'll just go to Ted's for dinner next time I'm at Town Center and then hop over to CF for a slice of Lemon Rasberry cheesecake, oh so good!"
Paul C.,"Jacksonville, FL",37,233,,2.0,11/21/2012,"One of the most overpriced lunches I ever had for what was served, and was a very small portion to boot.  Bathrooms were filthy; although service was good, and food was just OK regardless of price."
Jacki F.,"Richardson, TX",33,28,454,4.0,7/14/2013,"I love this place, but the only downfall is the cafeteria feel from the noise."
Tessa M.,"Stuart, FL",42,119,16,3.0,7/15/2011,"Same as any other cheesecake factory. My salad, their version of the southwest salad, could of been a little bigger for the cost. It was mainly toppings. But I guess that's the cheesecake factory for you.  I love cheesecake so I might be a bad judge. I loved it! I got the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. My husband had Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. I had soon 8-). It was too sweet for me. I thought the peanut butter would help cut out the sweetness, no it was sweet. My husband couldn't even finish it and we ate our cheesecake an hour or so after leaving the cheesecake factory."
