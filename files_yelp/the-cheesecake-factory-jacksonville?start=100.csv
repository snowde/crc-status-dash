Kay D.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,43,31,3.0,12/7/2015,"A lot of people rave about it. The desserts are good,Somewhat similar to the the cheesecake at junior's in ny. After a few visits...I'm not a fan of the meal items. My sister and her  husband were visiting from California and they said they were disappointed as well.  Apperently,i have to try the cheesecake factory out there because it is much better,both in terms of food quality and customer service. We were attempting to purchase quite a few desserts prior to arriving.but were informed we couldn't have a taste sample of anything. That made no sense, so rather then potentially waste money on deserts we weren't sure we would like,when we left we went to panera and purchased our deserts there instead."
Stephen S.,"Jacksonville, FL",48,99,118,3.0,5/22/2016,"Service took this from 4 to 3. I know tons of folk that have had nothing but great service, but my experiences have been bad. Food is good, maybe a little on the pricey side for what you get."
Jasa S.,"Fleming Island, FL",5,42,60,3.0,3/15/2015,"Not bad but not incredible. Even the cheese cake to go was just ""ok"". I will say the lettuce wraps as a meal were the way to go. They were so good. Daughters pesto pasta was ok Hubby's Cajun dished him sick"
Sandra W.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,7,2,5.0,6/9/2015,They have great food and great customer service I love buying their salad dressings! My favorite is  Cashew chicken with rice!  Not to mention their strawberry shortcake that's made with this huge biscuit  Yummy!!!
Rodney M.,"Jacksonville, FL",78,143,372,4.0,9/29/2015,"Can Always count on them for a good meal and outing that won't break your bank but it may well bend it. LOL! They've always been consistent & have the best assortment of deserts hands down.  I often get the gargantuan burrito...think it's called the Factory Burrito. Specific ratings: The Service was 4-4.5 (always greeted quickly and good wait staff; can be a wait during busy times), Facility 5 (immaculately kept and decorated), Food 4-4.5 (pretty good on taste; portions are huge), Price/cost 3.5-4 (comparatively priced with competitors; overall a lil pricey but fine for what you receive).  Summary: Definitely recommended."
Eric M.,"St. Augustine, FL",0,7,2,4.0,8/28/2016,Really love cheesecake factory. Never lets me down.  Went in on a Wednesday around 7pm and wanted my favorite mushroom soup. Sold out?? Had to find something new  and branched out to the chicken chili. Found a new favorite.  Factory chopped salad is always outstanding. Service was great this visit.
Scott L.,"Pilot, VA",0,17,,4.0,6/11/2016,"Good food, good selection and they have huge portions!  Great selection of cheesecake ! Be prepared to wait for a table because the are usually very busy! Try it you'll like it!"
Joe A.,"Jacksonville, FL",45,19,2,2.0,7/21/2016,"My girlfriend and I have eaten here 3 times, awesome location. Large portions, great customer service, however once we didn't feel so great after.. Seems like we might have had a slight food poisoning issue. She was done for, and we hand to cancel our evening plans."
Lsev-efive-osev Y.,"Chicago, IL",5,56,92,1.0,5/13/2016,This 1 star is strictly based on the valet driver almost hitting me as i was halfway backed up in the drive way. The Dumb fvck didnt even look back...kept his speed at unsafe rate for a parking area. Watch out for them. They dont care if u not using their service.
Salvador V.,"Miami, FL",145,5,,1.0,3/14/2016,"I've never been so dissatisfied and humiliated with a cheese cake factory than this one. I've had the best experiences in Arizona and Miami, but this one I feel discriminated against it was Terrible, we were sat down at 8:00 and weren't served till 8:25 the women in the front had the worst attitude. The manager in charge didn't care at all either it was a mess."
Teresa J.,"Jacksonville, FL",48,1,,1.0,5/8/2016,"Just had the worst service ever..Our waiter Dallas H was so rude and had no personality..every response was ""Yea""......then to top it off... as me and my party were speaking he reached in the middle of us..accross our face to grab a dirty plate....did not say excuse me and was completely rude...I am totally turned off to this place..."
Mariko S.,"Jacksonville, FL",70,82,77,5.0,10/8/2014,"All time favorite HUGE amount of drinks, food and cheese cake selections. Page after page after page. I need at least 10-15 min.  They also give you many  ""skinny"" menu. Low calories in drinks , food etc....  Their breads are awesome especially the brown one.  The portion is perfect for lunch and dinner. Price isn't bad either. I love their angle hair shrimp spaghetti. And Asian pair martini is the BEST! not too sweet just perfect !  I never had room for cheese cakes. It is a HUGE slice if you order a piece !  Servers are great. They sang birthday for my friend. If there is a birthday, you can either get a free ice cream with candle or a slice of cheese cake and they will write happy birthday around the plate with candles  and sing . For a busy night or lunch hour, I will recommend to call ahead or you will be waiting for a while."
Patricia F.,"Brunswick, GA",7,158,,4.0,11/6/2015,"The cheesecake is fantastic of course.  The pumpkin and the chocolate peanut butter cup are my favorites.  I do not care for the ""cheesecakes"" that are really just two big layers of cake with a layer of cheese cake like icing in the middle. If you are looking for a good lunch or dinner dish try the Pasta Alfredo and add Chicken."
Shenika L.,"Tallahassee, FL",172,102,43,3.0,8/2/2015,Cheesecake always the best food good I just like how close you can sit next to other guess food took a long time to come out other then that it was good
Michael H.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,22,9,4.0,5/9/2015,"My wife loves this place. I just never gave it a fair chance until today. The menu has a huge selection. I wanted to try everything but could not afford it :) I couldn't believe the rib eye steak only came with fries and was $27!! Say Wha!?!? I went with the hamburger which I would never order at a restaurant because, well, I'm at a restaurant.  It was the mushroom burger. The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare. Unfortunately the dang thing was just too darn soggy. My bun was falling apart before I could even get my mits in it. The lettuce they used for it was shredded lettuce. Really!? I asked for extra lettuce and maybe they misunderstood me for shreddded? The martini was great. The cheesecake should be as well. I love their bread. Yummy :) atmosphere is nice and noisy where we can talk without sounding too loud because I am. Service was great.  Probably could have done without the LONG wait before we got a seat but not their fault.  Wish they could have texted me when our seat was available so we could walk around town center a little."
Annie K.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",729,41,393,4.0,2/15/2015,"We decided to make a visit to Cheesecake Factory tonight. We were both craving it and it sounded like a fast easy dinner that we both enjoy. It ended up being not so fast but ended well. When we got there it was quite a surprise even for tomorrow being a holiday that it was jammed packed! They told us that it would be 20 minutes at 7:15. By the time I pager went off it was 8 o'clock. Thinking that we were being sat 45 minutes later we then waited another 10 minutes to get our table. I do understand the uncertainty of never predicting how business will be in a restaurant but a fair judgment of giving wait times is only common curtesy.  When we were sat we noticed that we were sat in a section that a large party just got up so the poor server got quadruple sat with four two top tables. I completely felt for how he was feeling because I know how it is as a server to be in this position. He definitely didn't let the challenge stop him from delivering great service. We ordered both our favorite dirty martinis that are always delicious with fresh Blue cheese olives. We also ordered our favorite appetizer the shrimp spring rolls with a delicious peanut and ginger dipping sauce. My husband always gets his favorite pasta Da Vinci and I decided to try something new the luau salad which was absolutely phenomenal! The salad was enormous it could've fed four! With excellent flavors of mango, macadamia nuts thin sliced chicken all layered on crisp wontons with a sesame drizzle and green onions and green beans it was all so fresh and delicious. I will definitely order it again! Not to mention it will be lunch tomorrow! Overall the dinner was great and like any other dinner at cheesecake that leaves you very full and no room for cheesecake lol I guess you always have to expect this place to be super busy because obviously they're doing something right there food is always great and the services as well."
Vick T.,"Brunswick, GA",63,2,,2.0,7/7/2016,Steak was over cooked. Sides were under cooked. I never complain but damn... Best thing was the mashed potatoes. Bar tender was par at best. Better restaurants in the area. By the way... Had to ask for A1 to eat the steak..
Stewart P.,"Birmingham, AL",120,269,79,2.0,6/23/2015,"There is really only one reason to go to The Cheesecake Factory, and that is for cheesecake. I've never really understood why people choose to frequent this place when it is overpriced and the food is poor to mediocre in quality and flavor. However, the cheesecake is great (because all cheesecake is great)!  The only reason I actually stopped in for lunch was because a very gracious student gave me a gift card for the restaurant after I mentored her for a month. I've been to a few other locations in different cities throughout the nation and have had a similar experience (hey, at least they're consistent). I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (a horridly bland thing that I later found out has over 2000 calories!! - how!? The stuff tasted like nothing) that was aggravatingly disappointing. I love Louisiana and I love pasta so surely some sort of magic should have happened... but lets just say that it was très ennuyeux. It was an insult to one of the most vibrant areas of the country.  As far as service was concerned, it was pretty poor too. Our server was working way too many tables for his skill level and wasn't managing very well. Service was slow and not all that impressive.  The only thing that was great was the cheesecake... and let's face it, that's because it combines two of the greatest things known to man: cheese and cake. Voila! Ecstasy! Cheesecake factory is not the best cheesecake in the world but it is good and probably one of the better ones you'll find in Jax (although I can't be sure because I've never had cheesecake at any other restaurant in Jax so don't believe a word of that statement - I just assume that Jax isn't teeming with cheesecakeries).  Anyways, go here for the dessert. Get your dinner or lunch elsewhere. It is way to expensive for crappy flavorless food that you could prepare better at home."
Gabrielle J.,"Tallahassee, FL",6,1,2,4.0,3/17/2015,"Salmon Genovese--THE BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN! The cheesecake was divine of course...love the romantic atmosphere. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in one of my favorite places, Jacksonville!"
Diane A.,"Saint Johns, FL",169,187,600,1.0,3/2/2014,"Service of wait staff and front hostess is fine it's the horrible cooking. Today was their off day esp since it wasn't busy when we came in, we were one of the first. Considering being the first customers today it took considerably long to get our food. Parents got their food and they both had side orders of potatoes and both side orders were burnt, overlooked, & had the taste of burnt. Moms toast were well done and also burnt! It must be ""burn the food day!"" I got the chicken katsu which was good except the jasmine rice was overdone and hard. I've been cooking jasmine rice since I was 11 yrs old and my 11yr old self could've made better jasmine rice. The rice today was stale and hard!  It'll be a while till I come back here. Maybe it's their off day but you wouldn't think so bec we were one of the first today to visit so it should be good. Oh well...."
