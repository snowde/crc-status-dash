Laura B.,"Jacksonville, FL",120,61,19,4.0,7/26/2015,"For starters, we had a party of over a dozen. I realize that affects some things, like out wait time to be seated, so I won't get into that. My advice, tell your party to arrive earlier than you actually want to sit, be sure the majority of your party is present before putting your name on the list. They'll back list you otherwise. Here's what I ordered: passion fruit monitor (amazing), tomato basil pasta (too much garlic, not enough mozzarella), chicken picatta (decent), limoncello cheesecake (yummo, my fave), and tiramisu cheesecake (not bad). Now to the good, our server, Brent, was fantastic. Very patient and polite with a sense of humor. My drinks were always full and the food was timed great - even my take out meal. I also too leftovers and cheesecake home and he bagged them separately so the cake wouldn't melt. Much appreciated. He definitely boosted my fairing."
Kelly N.,"Jacksonville, FL",19,1,,1.0,6/13/2016,Staff was rude and took over an hour to seat with a reservation. I don't do reviews but I thought the service was so bad and want to let people know you should spend your money somewhere you are treated well.
Athena C.,"Jacksonville, FL",422,179,788,5.0,1/24/2014,"I'm finally writing this review now (a few months after my visit) because my dumb phone was in service at the Sprint in the town center.  My boyfriend and I were enjoying our day of errands and I begged him to let us go to Cheesecake Factory because I've been dying to go. I love cheesecake and apparently they also have regular meals here, too. Whodathought?! So, after trying to find parking in a very full Town Center we were the first people there. They open right at 11 am and we were seated right away in this big whopping table. I felt so tiny in the booth.  We started off with the parmesan-garlic cheese bread with the marinara sauce for dipping and a tortilla soup. The tortilla soup had a spicy little kick to it, but not enough to make the mouth burn too much. The bread was delicious, aside from the original bread they usually provide to snack on while you're waiting on your food. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich with French fries. I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The portions were generous, and by generous I mean there was no way I finishing that AND eating a piece of their fabulous cheesecake, too.  The chicken parmesan was perfectly cooked on the most deliciously toasted French bread. The French fries were on and nothing spectacular, but still filling. The sandwich was delicious.  My salmon was cooked to flaky perfection and the zesty lemon sauce made for a perfect complement to the herbs it was seasoned with. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes because I like the chunks of potatoes and the skins mixed into the creamy goodness. I thoroughly enjoyed my food and will be looking forward to exploring the rest of the menu.  I, of course, being the cheesecake fan that I am HAD to order some. I mean, it is, after all, the cheesecake factory, right? So after perusing the long list of over 30 flavors of cheesecake I finally decided on the White Chocolate and Macadamia Nut cheesecake.  *drools* it was the most decadent cheesecake with a delicious flavor I've ever had. I was floored and definitely ate EVERY bite of that delicious dessert.  The server was very nice and she suggested a lot of great choices when I had trouble choosing my lunch and my dessert, and I went with both of her suggestions. She was right on the money.  I will definitely be coming back because the service, The food, and the environment were absolutely top notch for me."
Hugh P.,"Jacksonville, FL",1273,226,1751,4.0,3/2/2014,"A wide selection of food and always on point. I like the friendly atmosphere and the high quality of service. The steak, Jamaican jerk, and salads great. You might have to wait but you will be happy you did. Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is to die for."
Ra'kiah L.,"Fleming Island, FL",65,4,4,4.0,9/18/2015,"Very good service , although I wish it wasn't as cold as it was . I had the southern fried catfish with green beans (which could have been cooked a little longer , but was still very good), corn, and mashed potatoes . Our server was very nice and tried his best to accommodate all my party's needs ! Will definitely be returning"
Khondker I.,"Hollywood, FL",1,11,17,5.0,5/15/2015,"One of my favorite place to eat. Kale salad rocks. Great menus to choose from. The service and quality of the food is excellent. Went there multiple times , can't get tired of it. Go with your friends and family and enjoy the fine dining."
Austin O.,"Valdosta, GA",24,32,22,4.0,3/7/2016,This location never disappoints. Even when they are crowded you can still get in and out in a reasonable amount of time. I have been dozens of times and I don't recall ever having a bad meal. Try the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake... you'll thank me later.
Lori G.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,16,1,5.0,5/22/2016,We have visited the Cheesecake Factory many times and have never been disappointed. Everything EXCEPT the cheesecake is made fresh daily on premises and is absolutely delish. Now that we're WFPB (whole food plant based) eaters we especially appreciate the new vegan cob salad. Now if only they'd come up with a vegan cheesecake... :)
RoverTreks T.,"Green Cove Springs, FL",2,129,52,3.0,12/16/2014,"5-Star cheesecake and 3-star dining experience I've thought about what rating to issue this place for 7-years.   And I've always struggled with my decision.   That's because there's a stark difference between the ""cheesecake experience"" and the ""rest of the restaurant"" experience. In short, if you go for the cheesecake, you'll experience is a 5.   Otherwise, this is just an average restaurant.   Details Seven years ago, I ate at this restaurant and left feeling something was not quite right about the experience.  Off and on since then, I've visited when in the area.  I've always come away with the same feeling.   This has been my experience every time I eat at this restaurant.   And I keep going back thinking that my next experience will be different.   Partly, that's because my experience with this chain has been good elsewhere. We've all been there.  At one time or another in our lives, we've eaten at a restaurant  and left with that ""something is not quite right"" feeling.   Either the food is tasteless, or ""off"", not fresh,  --- but not quite right.   And sometimes it is difficult to pin down what exactly is wrong or where improvements can be made. This raises a question:  how does one rate a place that is ""not quite right""?  An experience between 1 and 5 is average.  Hence, my 3-star rating.  I ordered a cup of coffee and a club sandwich with a salad as a side recently.  The coffee was burnt and I sent it back.  That was an easy call.  Either coffee is burnt or it isn't.   Foul tasting coffee usually stems from unclean brewers (white vinegar folks!) or leaving a pot coffee too long on a heating element. The club sandwich was beautiful.  The toast was just right.  Each section was chock full of meat and veggies with a skewer through the middle.  But they were tasteless.  My immediate thought was, ""why do I keep coming back?"" The salad was OK but there was something off about it too.  It was drenched in blue cheese dressing.  Perhaps this was the problem?  I can't say.    My wife ordered the lettuce Mexican tacos for lunch.  She reports they were OK, not great.  The good news?  The Peppermint Cheesecake was excellent.   When we left the restaurant my wife said, ""well, that was a waste of $40.  The only reason to go there is for the cheesecake"". And that's what we've resolved to do in the future.  I want to give this restaurant a 5-star rating -- truly I do.   I've written my consistent, visceral reaction here for the first time after visits over many years.    Usually, when I write less than stellar reviews, I try to leave tips for the restaurant to consider.  I wish I could be more specific here.  Go for the Cheesecake and you'll get a 5-star experience.  With all else, lower your expectations.  To be fair, I haven't tried all 200+ offerings.  Those I have tried, spanning salads, pizzas, heavier dinner-like entrees, to breakfasts are just OK at best.   I'm resolved.  This is a 3-star dining experience."
Susan P.,"Jacksonville, FL",312,354,3002,3.0,3/29/2014,"This is my third or fourth visit to the cheesecake factory. They originally put us in this itty-bitty table right near the doorway but the waitress was very astute and noticed that we didn't really fit in there so she moved us to a booth. It was a Friday night at perhaps 9 o'clock so it was crowded but there was no wait. We ordered the fried avocado, zucchini and Portobello appetizer which was shockingly good. It's so simple but I never thought to fry avocado and it just explodes in your mouth with flavor. I also ordered the crab dip which was not so good. There was a good amount of crabmeat in the dip however it was probably overcooked so it was crab and cheese and possibly mayonnaise and it was very greasy. It was served with a handful of basically homemade croutons   This could have been so much better if executed correctly. We ordered two frozen drinks which turned out to be $10 apiece which is kind of expensive for Jacksonville for not really high-level alcohol brands. For dinner I ordered the Thai shrimp and chicken. The taste was quite good although they poured a ton of pepper on the shrimp which made it distracting. The presentation was nice and the food was good but probably because it was so late it appeared that the cooks were just on autopilot.  We also ordered a shrimp pasta which was supposed to have fried shrimp and a lemon cream sauce with Fettuccini noodles, mushrooms, and asparagus.  This also appears to be a victim of a tired cook. The flavor of the sauce was okay but the noodles were very dry and the shrimp appeared to be dunked in a batter and then sautéed in a pan. The results of that is that one side was crispy brown the other side was basically still soft batter   The waitress noticed that I could not eat the shrimp from my Thai  chicken and shrimp because it was just way too spicy completely covered with pepper, and she offered to take it back but I didn't want to get any ""special sauce""...  For dessert we ordered blueberry cheesecake with white chocolate and the DuLce de Leche cheesecake. Both were exceptionally delicious.  I also ordered the double chocolate cheesecake to bring home to my son and he said it was excellent also it was thick and rich and chocolatey.  All in all it was an adequate dining experience but the waitress was great. I might come back there but I would not order the menu items we ordered except for the fried zucchini avocado appetizer. Price for 2 drinks 2 apps 2 entrees and 3 cheesecakes was $110 before tip. Next time I'll stick to apps and cheesecake only."
Ouida P.,"Charlottesville, VA",152,53,311,5.0,1/10/2014,BLASPHEME!!! They no longer serve the veggie pizza!!!! Curses upon the menu demon!!!! Ok. This is still one of my favorite restaurants. The service is great. The cheesecake is delicious. And the Renee's Special is faithfully good and filling for less than 12 bucks. WhaddayaGonnaDo?
Shannon S.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,10,5,5.0,4/5/2015,"I definitely enjoyed myself here.  The food and staff are amazing! The wait was no more than 5 minutes.  The seating can be a little weird but if your a social butterfly, you can handle it.  I ordered steak Diane and it was perfect.  The portion sizes were good for the price. The cheesecake  was the real treat though.  We ordered an original cheesecake with whip cream and fresh strawberries. I think I died and went to cheesecake heaven"
Justin L.,"Tampa, FL",0,1,,2.0,5/5/2017,"2 stars only because the mojito.one meal was cold (maybe because she brought one meal 5 minutes before the other) and bland food.  terrible, forgetful, and unattentive service."
Dayna G.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,9,,4.0,10/24/2016,I had lunch at this location today with my daughter. The waiter (Jeff) was very attentive and accommodating. The lunch portions were huge! Our food was delish! The chicken potstickers appetizer was excelld
Valerian L.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,18,15,2.0,5/10/2015,"I will start by saying that their reservation policy is.... Well strange. We called them yesterday to make a reservation, which they let us. But we were running late and asked to have it rescheduled, but then they told us that they don't take reservations. Keep this in mind. Either way, the food was okay, and the Raspberry Lemonade I had was delicious, but way too sour. The entree was definitely not worth the price. The cheesecake though, that was good. I had the 30th anniversary cheesecake (á la mode) and it was spectacular.  Cheesecake Factory owns it's cheesecake pedigree, but the food itself is like a pretentious version of Chick-Fil-A: well praised, but actually overpriced and not worth it."
Jamie V.,"Jacksonville, FL",113,197,308,3.0,7/11/2013,"For a chain restaurant it's pretty decent.  I'm a big fan of the sweet corn tamale cakes - even found a copycat recipe and tried it.  Portions at this place are outrageous and I always end up taking at last half my meal home.   The addition of small plates to the menu was a nice touch.  My last visit was during a hot summer day and I didn't want anything too heavy.  My friend and I shared the kale salad, tamale cakes and lettuce wraps.  The kale salad was kale, cranberries, apples, almonds and green beans in a creamy dressing  We both really liked it.  The tamale cakes were fabulous as always.  And we barely touched the lettuce wraps.  I took the rest home for later.  I was tempted by the caramel macadamia nut white chocolate cheesecake but resisted.  Frankly I find many of the cheesecakes too rich and can only have a few bites. The restaurant was busy as usual but just a few minutes wait so quicker than normal.  Service was particularly slow.  I don't know if our server was overloaded or if we were a ""cheap"" check and got ignored.  I waited way longer than I like to get a to-go box and the check.    I'll also give this warning - be careful when paying with a credit card.  Both my mother and I had card numbers skimmed months apart from each other immediately after using them at Cheescake.  And both cards were higher limit credit cards that had not been used for a couple weeks prior to usage at Cheesecake.  My mom's card was duplicated and fraudulent charges made within two hours of paying.  My card was used within three days in Europe to buy about $2k worth of airplane tickets.  Both of us never had card numbers stolen before nor have we had an issues after.  Frankly, I think it's too similar to have been a coincidence and while I have absolutely no proof, I believe some servers were involved in a skimming ring.   I called management both times and was brushed off.  Obviously I've continued to go to the restaurant since I was there a couple weeks ago, but now I always use cash."
BS B.,"San Diego, CA",8,42,85,4.0,4/10/2014,Good food but I think it's a little bit pricy.. Try the Ahi Tuna salad it's delicious Another think.. The place busy.. So u should wait for awhile till you have seated
Trika R.,"Orange Park, FL",34,232,92,5.0,2/21/2015,"I really like this place, husband and I came here last min during the evening on a weekday and it wasn't packed. The food was really good along with the atmosphere. If we lived closer to this location we would visit it often."
Alan L.,"Jacksonville, FL",21,75,49,3.0,9/13/2014,"This is a breakfast/brunch review. We were looking for somewhere nice-ish for breakfast/brunch that opened earlier than 11 am and Cheesecake Factory was about the only option. We've mostly given up on them for dinner - crowded, noisy, overpriced, unhealthy, cheesecake doesn't seem as good (Capital Grill cheesecake blows it out of the water, but I digress...).  We arrived early to be seated right away at a very small table for two right against a wall - should have asked to move somewhere more comfortable since they were empty. Service was mediocre at best, mostly indifferent. Not bad, just not very good either. We both had the French Toast Napoleon (one with, one without pecans).  The French bread toast was perfectly cooked - crispy outside, soft but not squishy inside, with a flavorful chantilly creme and numerous sliced strawberries. The butter syrup was also good, though not much was needed. Very tasty French toast, and I'm a French toast snob. Not my favorite ever, but a fun twist and one I would get again. Bacon was good and thick enough but a little on the floppy side."
Arwyn W.,"Jacksonville, FL",52,30,570,3.0,10/9/2015,The wait is overwhelming and the service is average. The cheese cake is great but the wait was like ten min for a slice of cake. The apps are great and the salads are to die for. I prefer to visit during there down time because I receive better service. The buffalo rolls are great as well it'll feed two to three.
