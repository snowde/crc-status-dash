Kimberly M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,6/7/2015,"I experienced some terrible service from this bartender at the Jacksonville, FL,  Town Center location named Wagner.  He was rude and insisted that I  pay for an unfinished drink prior to going to the restroom,  as me and the 20+ members of my family waited to be seated...just because I am an African American male. Ironically enough, the white guy sitting next to me left and returned from the restroom and nothing was said. The manager condoned his behavior by confirming that this is their practice, but does this practice only apply to Blacks? If my twin niece and nephew hadn't been celebrating their high school graduation and so many family members weren't there, not only would I have lost my cool on this Wagner dude, but I would've refused to eat there.

Lisa D.,"Jacksonville, FL",189,498,1051,3.0,1/18/2015,"Good food and generous portions but the service can be mediocre. The blueberry, white chocolate cheesecake was amazing. I never choose to dine here, but if someone else chooses to go here, I will go along. We tried the meatloaf which was great but the mashed potatoes and gravy was the clear winner on the plate. My favorite appetizer is the fried veges, portabello mushrooms, avocados, and zuichini, sadly not as large of a portion as the other appetisers, but definitely worth a try."
Lawrence C.,"San Diego, CA",285,1104,5328,4.0,11/2/2013,Quick service from Andrew on to go orders.  Better than relying on doorstep or grubhub!! The quality and quantity of portions and salads are great.  Pricing is also very fair.  I continue to be impressed by this chain.
Erik C.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,35,3,2.0,3/23/2015,"My wife and I have been here twice and both times, we have not been impressed. First off the menu, decor and cheese cake are great. The problems are elsewhere.  Don't bother coming here on a Friday or Saturday because you will wait hours for a seat. The place is as loud as a school cafeteria on these nights so conversation is not a easy thing.  Service is a little slow (Monday) and dispute them messing up my drink, the waiter laugh without even asking to fix it.  The food is not all that good, at least what we ordered both times were not and my steak was burnt black on the outside and underdone on the inside. I asked if they had sauce like cream of mushroom or brandy sauce to top my steak with and the waiter snarled and said ""properly cook steaks don't need a sauce to make them taste good"". Strange, most high end restaurants with chefs cooking, prepare steak with sauces!  My ribbye was served with single side of French fries.... Nothing screams classy, like fries with your steak and no other sides. I substituted them for mash and was charged 3$ without them telling me. Mash was blane with no flavor at all.  I ordered a few drinks at 12.50 each which my same drink at a high end place only cost 10.50.  Tab came out to 105.00 in the end.  Overall, the place is not terrible, but for the price, I can did much better."
Kayla V.,"Winter Park, FL",15,21,29,4.0,3/10/2015,"Went here yesterday for me and my boyfriends six month anniversary, a bit before the dinner rush. We have both been to the Cheesecake Factory before at different locations, but this experience was especially lovely! Our server, I believe her name was Laura, really took her time with us and was very nice and funny. We had the chicken pot stickers as an app, they weren't the BEST I've ever had, but they were still pretty good. My boyfriend had the Orange chicken and its a huge portion! Really yummy. And I got the Steak Diane. It was cooked perfectly to my liking and the sauce it comes with is amazing! Definitely recommend this dish! Some of the menu items do seem pretty pricey for what you're getting. We didn't have time for dessert, but overall the meal was very relaxed and enjoyable, would definitely suggest this location."
Erin C.,"Satellite Beach, FL",0,2,,5.0,10/25/2015,Just had the best lunch sitting outside at The Cheesecake Factory with my son and puppy dog. The staff is great and we had a fabulous waiter. It was great to be able to enjoy a beautiful day and have a delicious lunch and being able to bring the dog.
Krista O.,"East Palatka, FL",49,8,1,5.0,3/7/2015,Service was amazing. VERY good quality food. And it was delicious! Wait time is kind of long. But definitely worth it. Prices are pretty reasonable too.
Kim Y.,"Jacksonville, FL",21,37,12,1.0,12/31/2015,"I have been to so many different locations in different states and I have to say this ine is not that great. Within the last 2 months we have been to this location 5 times and 3 out of the 5 times something was wrong. The last 2 times, we were given the wrong food completely.  This last time we ordered 3 meals and some cheesecake  to go and a salad while we waited.  The salad was great. The food on the other hand was misplaced and took over 30 mins to come out after 2 different people went to check on it. I think management needs to step it up on this. A manager walked by us 6 times stopping to watch the football game on the tv. Maybe they should have been doing a little more to make sure the right food or any food got to the customers.  The food ended up being cooked wrong. We ordered med-well done stake and it was bright red. The rest of the food was cold by time we got home and we only live less than 5 mins away. So you can say that this may be the last time we go to this location for a long time."
George P.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,7/30/2016,Terrible! I love the cheesecake here but it's absolutely absurd that it takes 45 mins to serve me a piece of cheesecake to go in the to go line.
S.J. B.,"Jacksonville, FL",58,4,,1.0,2/14/2016,30 minutes JUST to order cheesecake to go.  Re-god-damn-diculous!!!  Way over Max Occupancy of 369 (easily by 100 or more)!  There is insufficient space for people to wait for their takeaway orders.  They also don't/won't call your number outside.  Lack of buzzer type equipment to alert you of when it is finally time to get your order or be seated.
Apryl P.,"The Colony, TX",19,72,55,1.0,3/15/2016,"Hey Y'all...I know it's been a minute and I hate the be the bearer of bad news, but this where I find myself at again...I'm in Jax on business and my peer decided to try out the Infamous Cheesecake Factory. After waiting for the waitress for 7 minutes to tell us that she will be right with us, we look out the window and her and about 8 of her coworkers are singing happy birthday to a lady...after she wonders back of to us...she takes our drink order...in which the RootBeer was flat not a true servicing issue but she take another 8 plus mins to come with the strawberry lemonades, not s servicing issue again right...so we finally are able to order and at that point, I trying to get her attention for 2 Splenda in which I have to wait till she brings the food out, because she never came back over to check on is to see if everything was okay. The advises me to be careful because the food and dish itself was piping hot...well in the famous words of Maury Polvich THAT WAS A LIE...my shit was ice fucking cold...once the manager wondered over with his unapologetic azz, asked if I wanted something else, in which I gracefully declined, he removed the food and was never seen again. The Worst Service Ever, I Will Never Set Foot In A Cheesecake Factory Again!!!!"
Nick J.,"Dover, NC",7,7,1,5.0,8/25/2015,Well...I feel like curling up in a little ball and dying a very happy man..One of the best meals I've had in awhile..The service was very nice and fast with prices that were worth every penny. Deff would go back if in the area again
Julie B.,"Jacksonville, FL",8,10,,5.0,8/14/2015,"My husband and I really love this place.  We eat out every Friday and Saturday and this place has quickly become our favorite.  My husband orders the Steak Diane with mashed potatoes and I love the Chicken Piccata with angel hair pasta.  I always order a small salad with it. They never disappoint us. They are always packed, but turn tables quickly and food arrives in record time. We really love this place.  Oh, and service has been on point.  Drinks remain full, servers check in often. And the bread is to die for!"
Don S.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,29,6,4.0,12/1/2015,It was very good. We elected to sit out on the porch in the evening and it was perfect with the outside heaters going. Our meals were delicious and service was excellent.
Laura M.,"Orange Park, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/27/2017,"My family and I just dined in this restaurant at the St. John's Town Center in Jacksonville, FL. After our young son ate some of his macaroni and cheese we found what appeared to be blue chewing gum in his food. We alerted the waitress who got the attention of the manager on staff this evening. He came to our table and said that hey had nothing of that texture in his restaurant and that perhaps our children had candy at the table that might have gotten into his food. After explaining to him that that was definitely not the case, he insisted that no one in his kitchen would have been chewing gum and that he was dumbfounded at what we found in our the food. He suggested that perhaps it was the packaging plant for the pasta even, anything to avoid taking responsibility for what was clearly the fault of someone in his kitchen. After taking my son's meal off the check, I paid the balance and left in literal disgust. We have eaten many times at this same establishment and cannot believe what we just experienced. We will not be back, we are completely disgusted, and I would recommend your management staff be trained to handle situations differently."
Sumi W.,"Jacksonville, FL",62,24,5,2.0,7/20/2015,"I feel like Cheesecake Factory alone has gone downhill. Not how it use to be. With that being said I got food poisoning from eating the red velvet cheesecake at this particular location. My other friends got food poisoning as well, and they had other kinds of cheesecake. I contacted Cheesecake Factory to inform them and they never responded back to me. Rude! I will never eat your cheesecake ever again!"
Carter R.,"Jacksonville, FL",8,19,1,5.0,6/22/2014,"When my friends wanted me to go to the Cheesecake Factory 3 years ago, I saw the menu and immediately answered with a resounding ""NO.""  With an EPIC NOVEL as a menu, how can a restaurant possibly make any of the dishes properly??? (I am a Gordon Ramsey fan). I ate there today, and I was so wrong.  The fried mac and cheese was the best I've ever had, and INSPIRED ME to undertake a cooking project at home. My Steak Diane was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I have a great deal of respect for any chef who can season *AND* cook meat to such a high degree of accuracy (As a scientist, I was hypothesizing how I might be able to measure the concentration ratio of salt to meat to achieve such a perfect balance, and then if that formula could be extrapolated to ANY meat, or just with beef???)  I tasted the ""Chicken and Biscuits"" that my companion ordered and it was served with the most savory and delicious gravy I've ever had in my life. Then I had the Red Velvet cheesecake.  Look, guys...I know it's frozen cheesecake.  I don't care.  It was G-D delicious and plated beautifully with a tuft of fresh whipped cream on top.  Flawless meal.  Top-notch service."
Zipporah BelongstoGod M.,"Memphis, TN",159,13,20,3.0,11/11/2015,My miso salmon was burnt today! It didn't taste burnt but it sure looked it! There is nothing Cajun about my salmon smh
Deprina G.,"Bay Shore, NY",403,235,450,5.0,8/11/2014,I love there Oreo Cheese cake and I go on National Cheesecake day. They never have coupons and is always too expensive but with the large portion they have it is worth it. I only go here on pay day.. Free Pay day. ( ya know no bills due) You can't be made about the price when you still get good service and food. I ordered a Large BBQ chicken salad ate on it for 2 days. My fiance could eat his for 2 days also.
CJ S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,60,5,3.0,9/10/2015,"Located in the heart of the Town Center, Cheesecake Factory os your basic chain. I have eaten in this chain in NY, Jacksonville etc as a safe place when I did not know where to eat. However, the cheesecake is not New York Cheesecake by any standard. True New York Cheesecake is creamy, melt in your mouth and made with quality cream cheese and sour cream. Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake is simply ok. They cover their lack of quality ingredients (such as premium cheese) by utilizing half of the ""cheesecake"" disguised by peanut butter or cookie dough, red velvet et cetera. Those things should accentuate not make up half of the cheesecake. As for the dinners as Cheesecake Factory, they are your basic chain menu. They do not stand out as exceptional. However they are good in a pinch when other options are unavailable. I do not see where all the lines and excitement come from. Except perhaps because of the varieties of cheesecake. I prefer quality over quantity."
