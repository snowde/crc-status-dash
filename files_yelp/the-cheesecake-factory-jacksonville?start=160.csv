Kate W.,"Jacksonville, FL",130,106,163,4.0,6/20/2015,The food is never a let down. Would be 5 stars if they could do something about the length of wait and how crowded the entrance area is due to the amt of people.  Nachos were just plain delicious! Could have not shared...but it was plenty for 4 people. Chicken madeira is delish! My husband got the pork chop and was disappointed in the mashed potato ( too dry). Louisiana chicken has great flavor but the breading is a little different. Stuffed chicken tortilla are wonderful too and the corn cake that comes with it are yummy!!!
Eric J.,"Jacksonville, FL",4,5,5,4.0,1/4/2015,Breakfast food was good on Sunday brunch.  The waitress was pleasant and efficient.  Low quality carton scrambled eggs.  The fresh tomatoes looked good but were not good at all.  If you go order over hard eggs or similar so they have to crack fresh eggs for you.  Price is high but not awful.  Serving sizes are large.  I would go back.
Matthew S.,"Historic District - South, GA",1,5,2,2.0,5/17/2015,"We were seated after a 30 minute wait. Which is fine because it was a Saturday night. I opened my napkin roll up to find someone else's soup/ meal still on the spoon and none of the silverware polished. I asked for another roll up to find that only one fork that was useable. My meal comes out with a nice little hair mixed in, something I did not ask for. Manager came out and cracked a joke about it because he was bald. NOT FUNNY! Then to my surprise I had to pay for my entire bad experience. Very disappointing from a fellow restaurant manager!"
Jenny Mai D.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,36,46,2.0,4/16/2015,"I've been to a few Cheesecake Factory and I got to say this one does not live up to the restaurant's reputation. My family (cousin and her kid) and I had the Bang Bang Shrimp, fish tacos, and chicken enchiladas. I wasn't impressed with the Bang Bang shrimp at all, presentation wise and taste. The sauce was too tangy and not enought shrimp. The fish taco was the most depressing. I've had many fish tacos in my life and I got to say that was one of the worst. The taco wrap fell apart after one bit because the fish was probably placed there right of the grill without letting it drip away the water. The garnish for it was sadly not fresh. I mean my avacado looked lit it was cooked which is never good on a taco. I can say the enchiladas were the only thing I thought was decent because the cheesecake did not live up to expectations."
John H.,"Rancho San Diego, San Diego, CA",14,36,14,1.0,4/19/2015,"Came here the night before when they were super packed, and the waiter was very attentive and helpful. I ordered a Fettecini Alfredo With Shrimp and it was delicious! I came back the next day after some shopping and ordered the same dish, and it didn't taste good at all, there was only 6 or 7 pieces of shrimp in it, and after eating for a few min I chewed into a piece of plastic mixed in with the food!! I was disgusted and informed the waitress. The manager came out after a few min to apologize, and stated that she did some research and found that it was a piece of plastic from the bag that the pasta came in. The manager was kind and apologized sincerely, but I will not be returning to this restaurant again. I am very disappointed with the quality of the food the second day and finding plastic in my food."
Elizabeth L.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",1,25,4,1.0,9/26/2015,Terrible. My chicken Tuscan plate was drowned in balsamic vinaigrette. Waitress didn't care to offer me something but then I again I didn't ask but she knew I hated it as I asked for a separate plate of Farro with no sauce to put my chicken on. And then ridiculously priced. I don't paying money for food but when it's terrible that's when it hurts.
N G.,"Savannah, GA",1,19,27,1.0,4/15/2015,Long wait to be seated. Food is kind of bland and presentation is not so appetizing. Cheese cake was good but OVER PRICED for a small piece (compared to the slice I got the last time. I didn't notice until I got home). Waitress was very accommodating. There are better restaurants around this area for less price and shorter wait time. Better dessert bakeries around the area.
Amanda S.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,141,6,3.0,1/26/2014,"If you're going for dessert, you will not be disappointed and I think that obvious for the giant case of cake in the lobby.   Food can be hit or miss and pricey.   Go off normal meal times for less of a wait. Always loud, not great for conversation"
l b.,"Jacksonville, FL",23,188,48,3.0,1/11/2014,"Service was great. We loved Pippi!! I'm such a food snob so I really should not have gone here for lunch. But alas, we were in fake America, commercial, capitalism at it's best, Saint John's Towne Center in Jacksonville. There, you are surrounded by everything perfect. I digress. The food is fine. It's a chain restaurant. And this one, though they make the presentation very pretty, it's just okay. It's nothing too special."
Carmen G.,"Jacksonville, FL",20,15,11,5.0,5/13/2016,"Great happy hour speciaks, just wish it didnt end at 630pm since i work downtown.  But ive had several of the items on the menu. Today venyured into the hamburger special and it was much more than i expected. Two patties, melted cheese, etc. Delish!"
Tanya B.,"Jacksonville, FL",13,52,50,1.0,10/19/2015,"I normally dont go out of my way to make a complaint but this just ticked me of through the roof. My husband and I FINALLY went on a date. We have a new baby (5 months) and its incredibly hard to get out of the house. We went all out, asked for the table we wanted. Waited 40 min specifically for it. (outside area) We needed a particular spot because we did have a stroller. We sat down, our waitress was very nice and all was good. After we ordered, 4 people sat down next to us. And they started smoking. And not just smoking, CHAIN SMOKING!!! Did I mention, I was with a 5 month baby? I politely asked one of the waiters (not our girl) if this was even allowed. She questioned it for a second and told me she would double check. She came back and told me they had full right to smoke and I kinda had to deal with it. She asked if we wanted to be moved inside and I said no. We waited 40 min to get this particular table. Our night was officially done! The 2 couples next to us over heard this and on purpose smoked away. Even when there food arrived. I was so upset and couldnt believe it! Didnt I go to a family restaurant or to a bar?!  When our food came, I honestly had no appetite. All I could smell is smoke. I barely ate it. It was disgusting to me. My husband finished eating and we were out! We left so fast! I couldnt believe we just paid for an evening out and we absolutely hated it! I couldnt believe the waitress couldnt tell them not to smoke or step out. I really want Cheesecake Factory to consider this situation and really do something about it.  I wasted an evening and around $50 bucks on a night that went from great to disaster!"
Amanda N.,"Jacksonville, FL",100,171,413,4.0,3/13/2014,We stopped in for lunch bc those dinner portions r nuts. I got a pasta that I can't pronounce lol but had chicken carmelized onions peas bacon capers etc. soooo good. Only complaint is we both though our two different pastas were too salty. We were sucking down water. Of course had to get a cheesecake. Got some extreme one w like german choc coconut etc and holy cow I'm glad I wore a dress bc I'm sure I would have popped a button. Btw lunch portion was still huge.
Darrah R.,"Jacksonville, FL",72,19,2,4.0,6/12/2015,"Great stop for lunch or dinner. I recommend the turkey burger for lunch and the cashew chicken for dinner. The cheesecake slices are huge! Definitely enough for two. Friendly service and atmosphere. The menu is ginormous so really hard to choose. Note to corporate, men don't like ordering from a menu where everything has skinnylicious in the name."
Craig E.,"Jacksonville, FL",47,58,5,3.0,7/5/2013,"I have eaten at a couple of Cheesecake Factory locations between NY and Florida, and they are all pretty consistent.  Food quality is always good, although often unremarkable.  That said, I have to admit I am not one to frequent what I call restaurant ""factories"" - large corporate chains where there is always a wait of some length, too many noisy people, etc.  On this particular outing, we arrived for dinner around 6 and had to wait a short time - 5 -10 minutes.  We got crammed into a very small table for 2 in a row of small tables with constant traffic behind us in the aisle.  One of the reasons I don't like these huge restaurant factories....... Drinks and appetizer course were delivered promptly, and we enjoyed the Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls - although it was hard to find any shrimp in them.  We've had much better at our local Thai restaurant. Dinners were Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice, and Fish Tacos with cilantro rice and black beans on the side.  Both dishes were cooked right and the portions were generous.  The tacos were in soft corn tortillas, with a fairly substantial piece of fried fish in each.  A little lacking in seasoning, but good quality.  The brown rice made the Bang Bang plate more interesting, better texture than plain white rice and the sauce had a good balance of seasoning and mild heat.  However, if you have sampled the Bang Bang shrimp at a Bonefish Grill restaurant then Cheesecake Factory doesn't quite make the grade.  The Bonefish version is killer, Cheesecake Factory is just ok.  Of course, if you are eating at Cheesecake Factory - what do you have for dessert?  We had a piece of Reece's Peanut Butter and a piece of Lemon Raspberry Cream.  Hard to beat - they were everything we expected.  Then again, $7.50 for a slice of cheesecake?  We're not going to do that very often.  Bill with tax and tap went over $80. So, overall we enjoyed the food but think it is overpriced for what it is.  You can get better quality at independent local restaurants for less - except for the cheesecake.  If you like to spend too much in a crowded noisy restaurant for food that is decent but not exceptional (once again, excepting the cheesecake) - by all means go ahead.  Its not bad."
Don L.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",450,210,13,2.0,10/19/2013,"Unlike our experience in Orlando, this location was NOT good.  My wife made the mistake of ordering a bone-in pork chop and it was the most horrible pork chop in the history of dining out!  So tough and absolutely tasteless!  Please take this thing off your menu - it would take a blind person without taste buds to enjoy this. My meatloaf was good.  The veggies that came with it were obviously frozen or canned as they turned into mushy grit the instant you put them in your mouth.  That absolute lack of texture was disgusting! The red velvet cheesecake was very good but the only highlight of the visit.  Service?  Not so great.  We told the waiter that the pork chop was horrible.  He apologized and left.  The pork chop was left uneaten and picked up with the dirty dishes.  Unfortunately, no manager ever came by to follow-up as should have been the case. We won't come back to this location."
Mai N.,"Jacksonville, FL",166,26,33,4.0,2/8/2015,Gluten Free Cheesecake is a must! Great service and food is delicuous. Recommend ordering the turkey burger gluten free!
Rachel P.,"Saint Henry, OH",1,7,6,5.0,7/24/2014,"I am from a small town in ohio and we don't have a Cheesecake Factory near me , but we love the Cheesecake Factory! The Chicken Alfredo is spectacular ! Conner was our waiter and was fantastic as well ! Made me feel as if I was at home & just great ! I recommend the Cheesecake Factory to anyone . A little pricey but well worth it!"
Cari B.,"Jacksonville, FL",175,83,896,5.0,9/18/2013,"Consistently good . Cheesecake Factory has a extensive menu and while I haven't tried everything on it the things I have tried have all been consistently good . I love their skinny licious menu . I've tried the pasta , tacos , salad , chicken and hamburger off this menu and never was I disappointed . Actually had a hard time believing these could be low calorie meals and lets face it you're going to have a piece of cheesecake so it never hurts to save some extra calories for that . Now that we're on desserts I mean come on its Cheesecake Factory of course they're fabulous . My all time fav is the blueberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake . Mmm mmm soooo good . The chocolate fudge cake is a close second . I always sit at the bar for the best service ."
Jordan W.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,,5.0,3/21/2016,Alexis is a doll. She was so pleasant and a pleasure to have. We stayed late and she never made us feel unwelcomed. We will definitely be returning.
Lina M.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,92,108,4.0,3/6/2015,"Great food, usually too many choices! Not a bad thing.  I haven't ever had poor service until tonight when I was surprised by the actions of my waitress Rebecca. Though she was kind and refilled our water and bread often I was surprised when she tried to cover her mistake and not put more effort into getting my food right. I ordered the salad with ranch on the side. The salad came out with the usual vinaigrette mixed in and she told me that she would bring me ranch in a sec and I could drown the salad and not taste the vinaigrette. You're kidding right? Thanks for not suggesting that you should take it back immediately. If I wanted vinaigrette on the salad I wouldn't have asked for a different dressing altogether. I had to tell her that she needed to take it back. That was weird. :-/."
