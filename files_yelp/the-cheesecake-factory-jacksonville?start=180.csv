Chloe S.,"Jacksonville, FL",15,13,98,4.0,10/25/2014,"The Pasta Da Vinci is superb, I loooovvveee this dish. The cheesecake selections were great... the wait was 45 minutes... I guess you have to wait for great things"
Justin J.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",18,18,,1.0,11/11/2014,"Server was rude and couldn't stop laughing for whatever reason, everyone else was given bread except for us. The guy who brought out our appetizer sat it directly on our menu and was very rude. Horrible service, we asked for the check after our appetizer and left. Food's usually great but I don't think we'll go back to this location again."
Michael G.,"Jacksonville, FL",42,11,,4.0,4/9/2015,"Delicious food with HUGE portions. Plan on splitting a meal or else plan to take a bunch home. The cheesecake is going to be a wonderful finish to the meal. And the menu is endless - there is something there for everyone :) If it were a little bit more affordable, my wife and I would go more often."
Pinky P.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",51,15,136,3.0,7/24/2014,"I would give it 4 stars but the wait time is just ridiculous. The food is good with a good size amount of portions. It's always so crowded, so at times you have to raise your voice to talk especially on the weekends and in the bar area. I do think that their prices are a little high and their menu reads like a book- just a little busy. I do like that they have an assortment of cheesecake, hence the name- The Cheesecake Factory! Every time I've gone there the servers were all really polite and attentive. I think the ahi tuna salad is awesome as well as the carbonara. This is good place to take your family and groups of friends."
Bryan W.,"St. Augustine, FL",17,214,12,4.0,6/14/2013,I can't stress enough for people to do their research before eating here. The menu is probably the biggest menu I have ever seen. With so much variety it could take awile to look through and decide on what to eat.  The prices here are very good if you don't go crazy on dessert and drinks. Those are the areas they over charge in my opinion.  This place is always packed so I reccomend getting there early!  Some things I have enjoyed there: The buffalo chicken stuffed appetizer Mac and Cheese burger Lemon Chicken Tiromizo Cheesecake
Debbi C.,"Jacksonville, FL",196,169,169,3.0,1/12/2013,"It's good food and huge portions but the menu is sooooo big and there's always a wait for the food. Even if you tell them you're in a hurry, For taste they get a solid 3 1/2 but the wait after you sit is crazy.  Try the avocado egg rolls.yummy!!!"
Amanda C.,"Jacksonville, FL",80,98,98,4.0,9/11/2014,"The cheesecake factory is a fun place to go eat. Their menu is HUGE, it's like a small book. It's cool because they have so many options, but if it is your 1st time it will probably take you a while to decide what you want. I had a mojito last time and it was really yummy and refreshing. For my food I ordered some breaded chicken, I think chicken a pana or something like that, and the cream sauce they use is delicious. The thing I don't like is that it is always packed, always! Weekends are even more so. Luckily we got one of the tables in the bar area where it is just first come, first serve.So it's not really a place to go for an intimate dinner or anything since there are so many people and the tables are close together but it is good food at reasonable prices. And of course the cheesecake is amazing!"
Rick D.,"Troy, MI",77,83,38,4.0,2/3/2015,"Tonight I had the mushroom soup with a turkey burger and salad. The food is always  good here. Seems like this is a standard to provide exceptional food across  all locations. I normally do not order cheesecake  due to my healthy lifestyle, but I enjoy their turkey burger."
Theresa P.,"Bettendorf, IA",0,12,11,4.0,4/12/2014,Chicken Maderia was to die for. Waitress said it was their best selling chicken entree and I can see why.  Mom ordered shrimp scampi and was not thrilled with it. It is not your typical shrimp scampi with white sauce. Mom said it had a tart taste. The shrimp that came with it were huge.
Sayaka B.,"Waynesville, MO",52,105,50,3.0,11/19/2014,"this place was busy,,, I had to wait for my dinner about 4mins..On my Bday!!!! the manager offered free desserts so I really don't complain about the wait but they need to train the server more."
Ryna J.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,7,1,2.0,7/16/2016,"I generally LOVE Cheesecake Factory but the experience we had today will leave a bad taste in our mouth for sometime.   Our order was placed on hold instead of ordered (waitress came over and told us as apologize, if just that's mistake it would be fine) took another 20 min after that (min) for our orders to start coming out. And they were all wrong. Daughter ordered chicken quesadilla, she got cheese only. Some order buffalo chicken sandwich ONLY buffalo sauce same with everything on it BUT the buffalo sauce. My chicken was cold and tasteless (I ended up uses some ketchup to dip it in so it at least tasted like something) along with the side items being wrong as well. Husband order was delayed as they ran out or mashed potatoes.  This is not what we have experienced any other time we have gone to this establishment and quite shocked. The waitress was nice apologized over and over (kitchen screw up after screw up clearly not her fault) she asked her manager to come over to talk to us (we didn't ask for it she told us she had) Manager came over and said she was sorry. That was pretty much it and she never came back again. Even after hearing me say we would lot return she just let us walk out not saying a word.  The manager on duty tonight needs some serious retraining so she can properly address customer concerns and assist her Staff.  Again not the waitress but the kitchen staff and manager that really blew it."
Phuong N.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,26,92,5.0,11/28/2014,"There is always a line, or at least everytime I come here. Servers were very attentive and nice. The foods seem clean and taste very delicious. Their cheesecakes are always a must to end your meal!!!"
Al N.,"Hialeah, FL",0,97,8,4.0,10/7/2014,"This place plays on a higher plain than most.  This location doesn't disappoint. I had the texmex rolls whicb were as good as ever. The establishment seems disorganized in comparison to other locales. The chocolate mousse cheesecake is beyond pleasurable.  Overall good, could be cleaner."
A. M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",19,54,5,2.0,4/25/2014,This not the best location - it's somewhat dirty and the wait staff is extremely unprofessional and not well trained.  Ordered an appetizer that never arrived - didn't even receive an apology.  Chicken dumplings were overdone.  Would not return to this particular location.
Linc A.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,1.0,6/24/2015,It is difficult for me to give a 1 star however this place deserves it. They might have good cheesecake but the restaurant was a fail. Never again.
Bonneil K.,"New York, NY",9,63,17,4.0,8/2/2014,"Delicious cheesecake. Highly recommend the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Slice portions are huge, and every bite of the cheesecake was heavenly."
Tyrone F.,"Titusville, FL",675,68,3,4.0,10/21/2013,"YUM!! One of my favorite places to eat and I have never been disappointed at any location.  Had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and as always it was simply delicious.  They have excellent kids meals selections as well as a menu to cater to any type of food you crave. Don't get me started on the cheesecake...if you think selecting your main course is tough, try choosing a cheesecake!!!  I settled this time on the S'Mores cheesecake...and OMG...need I say more?"
Kelli P.,"Kings Bay Base, GA",54,158,,4.0,1/25/2012,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. It is one of my favorite restaurants in the world! When I moved down south, I thought ""Oh, well... that's it.... no more delicious Cheesecake Factory for me!"", but imagine my surprise when I found out there was one only 45 minutes from me!!!!!  My husband and dined here the other night and we were lucky enough to get a seat right away and outside! It was a beautiful night!! Our waitress was so nice and funny. Everything we ordered came at the perfect times and we just simply had a wonderful meal!!! I am so glad I didn't have to give up my Cheesecake Factory!!!"
David M.,"Orlando, FL",0,38,12,5.0,10/21/2015,Consistently good. Enjoying Shepard's pie again. Hearty with great flavor. Trying to save room for dessert. Lol. I will always recommend and return to enjoy the large menu selections.
Julio S.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,19,48,5.0,8/2/2013,"I hate eating chain restaurants but I don't mind Cheesecake Factory at all. The menu is huge, you could find pasta,sandwiches,etc. it's very good and the prices aren't bad. Try the strawberry cheesecake you won't regret it."
