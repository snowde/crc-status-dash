Matt C.,"Jacksonville, FL",11,4,,5.0,10/14/2013,"No complaints at all. Overall great food and the staff is the best in the business.  My server was getting a little overwhelmed due to circumstances that she couldn't control, and she handled it with class and professionalism. The jerk she was dealing with didn't think so, but all the other customers around all seem to agree with me."
John D.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",2,5,,4.0,11/22/2013,Me and the wife came here on a Friday night! The wait was only 5 minutes. Very good staff and friendly too. Ordered the garlic cheese bread and it was amazing. Then we ordered their Madeira Chicken and it was very good but could have used a little seasoning. My wife had the caesar and it was very good! The price was pretty good. We will definitely return
Karen H.,"Jacksonville, FL",23,123,4,1.0,6/12/2012,"If you enjoy hyped up, over priced, noisy restaurant, with people packed in tight places, then go and enjoy.  They do have HUGE pieces of cake and pie, but not that wonderful that I will ever go back.  This is one restaurant I hope they don't bring to ""my side of town"".  I'll never go out of my way to eat here again."
Thomas A.,"Atlanta, GA",29,71,27,4.0,12/29/2012,"The food here is really good. I would say it is above average in terms of price but well worth it. I have only experienced long lines and slow service on the weekends. The inside is nice but very loud, the ""round room"" is my favorite place to sit here. All the servers have been friendly and attentive considering the large volume of people they serve."
Matthew P.,"Fayetteville, NC",1,53,2,2.0,7/18/2012,"I've only done the cheesecake here, and it's fantastic, but the service was very bad! The waitress was very rude to my wife, and I definitely will not be returning."
Jen L.,"Orange Park, FL",0,32,,1.0,4/21/2014,"Disappointing all the way around. The buzzer died so after 45 minutes I checked and the hostess said I must have been too far away or the battery died. Well I was inside the entire time so they said you are next...20 minutes later we sat down. The tables are so crammed together you feel like you are on a cruise ship eating with 3,000 people at the same time. You have no privacy and for the outrageous prices I would expect better. I will not be back."
Ed L.,"Jacksonville, FL",146,172,14,5.0,9/5/2009,"5 Words - Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  -10 Stars-  A slightly sweet Thai dish with spicy flavors of curry, peanut, chile, and coconut. sauteed with light vegetables and served with white rice. This lip-smacking creamy curry sauce with a peanut sauce drizzled and coconut sprinkled over the top compliments and completes the complexities of its flavors.  Only one complaint; I wish it was a larger portion so I could bring more home."
Khristopher B.,"Jacksonville, FL",133,93,95,4.0,4/8/2014,"I have never been to another Cheesecake Factory outside of this Jacksonville/St. Johns Town Center location, but the experience was solid. I went there with a friend of mine from FSCJ and even though the place was packed, the waitress had the ability to make my party feel like we were the other patrons there. The waitress pushed for us to eat or take home the restaurant's legendary cheesecake, which we didn't, but I cannot blame her for trying. On a different day, I went to this cheesecake factory and bought a cheesecake and it was wonderful. One of the things I like most about this location, and perhaps all the cheesecake factories, is the robust menu. Much like the way nearby BJ's has pages and pages of food items, The Cheesecake Factory has something for any type of taste. With this particular location, no matter what time of day, expect a long wait time because it is always packed. The outdoor dining area is scenic and sectioned-off properly. However, like all the other restaurants in the Town Center, the cheesecake factory is plagued by terrible parking."
Kimberly B.,"Detroit, MI",9,38,34,4.0,10/16/2012,"On a sunny day, this is a great spot to have lunch on the outdoor patio.  The service is fast and friendly and the ""Skinny"" menu has some wonderful options for the right portions at the right price.  The food tastes fresh and flavorful!  Only downfall is that people can smoke outside on the patio, but other than that, it's a great restaurant."
Kathrin E.,"Guyton, GA",3,111,68,4.0,11/13/2012,Loved my bang bang shrimp and lemon drop martini.. Had a wonderful time with family and friends and will be back !!!!!
Chris F.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,10,,3.0,9/24/2012,"Food and drinks were good, but our server was too pushy. She was pushing us to get a cocktail. I made it clear I don't drink but she asked at least three times. She also pushed us getting dessert. Not in a rush to go back"
Corey A.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,13,,2.0,1/3/2013,"Overpriced Olive Garden, but the food is slothered in butter and olive oil. I am confused why this restaurant typically has a wait at least of 20 minutes. I will not return due to the quality of the food. Typical chain restaurant prepackaged food with bland to nasty flavor. I gave it a two star due to the above average service. I also would like to mention that most of the seating is tables literally RIGHT next to the other. I did not enjoy sitting two feet away from a total stranger and hearing their conversations as well the other couple on the other side. Save yourself the miserable 45 minute wait and $30 and go somewhere else."
Gregory D.,"Jacksonville, FL",7,27,1,4.0,7/17/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is fantastic! I've not been disappointed the few times that I've visited here and plan on visiting again. On my last visit last Sunday (7/11/10) which happened to be my wedding anniversary, I ordered the fettucine alfredo which was excellent. My wife, however, ordered an eggplant sandwich which did not meet her expectations and asked the manager for a discount. The manager (I'm sorry, I don't recall his name) was extremely gracious and offered to completely remove her meal from our check and offered her another choice from the menu. We were completely impressed by the excellent customer service. On that basis alone, we would definitely return. And then, of course, there is the cheesecake. More varieties than you can keep track of and all the ones I've tried were delicious."
Sharon M.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,19,,5.0,1/15/2011,"Yummy food, huge portions so there's always something to snack on the next day. I'm always surprised at how great the service is for a restaurant so large (& for a chain) but we've yet to be disappointed. I recommend ( if there's just the two of you) that you try & grab a seat at the bar - you'll bypass all the waiting & the entire menu is available with plenty of room to eat. The bartenders are always super friendly & on their game. I'm currently suffering from Cheesecake Factory burn out. I've eaten more  Advocado spring rolls, Thai lettuce wraps & sweet corn tamale cakes than I care to confess - but they're all soooo good.  & don't even get me started on the beef ribs... I'll be back Cheesecake Factory but not for a while - absence makes the heart grow fonder ,,,"
Julie G.,"Richmond Hill, GA",3,4,,1.0,6/12/2012,The food was decent but the bathroom was disgusting. A little maintenance would go a long way here.
Alexandria S.,"Orlando, FL",4,45,1,3.0,11/19/2011,"I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory here in Jacksonville since about 2006, and I can say that I've always loved it despite a few things. For one, don't even try to get in on the weekends without a reservation, you'll be waiting at LEAST an hour. The place is also extremely noisy, so be sure that you talk really loud so the person next to you can hear! The service is also really slow, and the food is...meh. I'm a huge salad lover but I despise their salads because to me, they lack in flavor and how is anyone supposed to eat a salad that's literally two stories tall? The cheesecake is of course really good though, and their sandwiches are good. Overall, it's a nice place but definitely not my first choice."
James R.,"Jacksonville, FL",10,29,5,3.0,7/10/2011,Cheesecake Factory at the Town Center is Cheesecake Factory everywhere.  But that doesn't take away from the fact that their food is very good.  They serve one of the best ahi tuna steaks I've had from a chain.  And I'm an ahi tuna aficionado of the worst kind.
Jennifer P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,33,,4.0,12/27/2009,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory many times and have never had a bad experience.  The fried macaroni and cheese is a favorite appetizer of mine, and Evelyn's favorite pasta is a yummy entree loaded with healthy veggies. The menu is huge and it's guaranteed that there's something for everyone.  Once you're done with your meal, it's a given that you stay for a slice of cheesecake. My favorite is the chocolate coconut.  They usually are pretty crowded, but I typically have not had to wait too long, unless I was with a larger group. Prices are reasonable and it's great for a nice dinner or lunch after some shopping at the town center."
Brian F.,"Richardson, TX",51,160,739,4.0,7/23/2011,I am not a fan of chain restaurants so I am not sure why the Cheesecake Factory appeals to me but it does. I think the food is very good and of course the quantity you get on your plate is astounding. Now do I even have to say it? Yes the cheesecake is fabulous!
d k.,"King George, VA",0,30,,4.0,7/31/2011,"The thing i like best about the cheesecake factory is that no matter where you are, the food (and the cheesecake) is great.  It's one of our family favorites...along with Texas de Brazil. I think the prices are pretty good, we spent 150 for our family of five including appetizers, entrees and of course dessert.  I have spent more..and less..elsewhere and been less satisfied.  Since they're all over the country, it's an easy go-to choice - there are menu options for almost every cuisine and appetite.  On the down side, the menu is almost overwhelmingly large.  You almost have to pick a favorite and stick with it. My favorite is the shrimp scampi, it's garlicky heaven with a side of angel hair pasta.   Our waitress was attentive but very busy...it was jam packed in there.  What I appreciated was that although they were really busy, all of the wait staff and bus boys were smiling and seemed to enjoy doing their jobs.  Usually a sign of a well run restaurant.  And although it was busy and the wait was long, we did not feel rushed to get through our meal. Solid thumbs up."
