Andy Z.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,22,,3.0,12/5/2012,"this place is great if some one else is paying!  the good: clean, upscale. huge menu. white table cloth tables, big room. service: good but rude and pushy at first,  once your order get there you better check your food quick, if there a problem and its a peak times, get ready to get mad. we learned to go during times it's not crowded! food: varies ALLOT! at these prices there is no excuses in my book! tbh yesterday visit was only because of birthday deal!  I personally think their cheesecake is not that good, I prefer NYC style. at 7 bucks a slice its overpriced! bad: prices, dirty bathrooms. noisy as hell, seems to be trend lately. their hamburger I had does not hold a candle to five guys..... bottom line been twice, we will NOT go back, if I have to pay!"
Matt S.,"St. Augustine, FL",63,515,58,5.0,4/27/2010,"I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. It seems that every time you bring up the name of the place to any of your friends or relatives, they all just gasp with excitement at the thought of eating at this delicious restaurant. This particular TCF is located at the St. Johns Town Center, and there is usually plenty of parking within the immediate area, although since it is in a mall, if you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to walk for a bit, unless you go with the valet parking. The decor of the place is great, and I love how the restaurant is WIDE OPEN, although the tables and booths are somewhat close together, but it feels very relaxed and inviting. You can sit inside, at the bar, or they have tables outside, usually with large tiki torches lit and heaters above your tables for chilly nights. The few times I have been here, I did not have to wait to get a table, but if you do show up on busier nights / afternoons, be prepared to wait, and wait a little while. The service is actually fantastic here. The servers here only have 3-4 tables max at one time, so that ensures that they will be at your table more often than not, making sure your food comes out at a good pace, that your drinks are filled, and that you have everything you need. I legitimately have not had bad service at a Cheesecake Factory, EVER, which is quite an accomplishment. Now we get to the food.... Wow. It does seem like a lot of the menu items are hit or miss. The great thing is that there is such a diversity in what you can order, whatever you're in the mood for, it's there. Feeling like a thick, juicy burger? Check. Seafood or pasta? Check. Classic comfort food? Check. It's all here. Some of the items on the menu just won't suit everyone's taste buds, so be sure to thoroughly look over the menu to decide what you really want, and you will walk away a winner. There are so many fantastic dishes, it's really hard to decide. Last time I was in I had a black and bleu burger and it flat-out kicked ass. With such great service and great food, what else could you ask for? Oh yeah, CHEESECAKE! I always liked Jimmy's line on ""Yes, Dear"", when he expected to walk in and see Cheesecakes being built and traveling around on conveyer belts, which you won't see here. But it is the first thing you will notice walking in, a HUGE case filled with delicious cheesecakes right next to the seats in the lobby. I believe it takes up two pages in the menu, if I'm not mistaken... There are so many unbelievably delicious choices, it is near impossible to choose. I also usually order so much food I can never have room at the end. Well I'm telling you- MAKE ROOM. The key lime was un-f'n-believable. The Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake will bring you to your knees.  Overall, I really enjoy this place... I don't know too many people, if any, who DON'T like eating here. I highly recommend it to anyone, it's a great family place, or great to take a date. Delicious food, great service, good prices, you can't beat The Cheesecake Factory."
randy l.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,9,,5.0,8/16/2010,"A favorite of ours!!! And they did not disappoint us again tonight. Great service and hot, great tasting, and well presented food.  Shrimp Scampi appetizer was excellent."
Christina S.,"New Orleans, LA",2,27,3,5.0,3/25/2011,"I'm pretty sure that The Cheesecake Factory is in my top 3 for the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. The interior is so unique and lovely that it almost makes you feel like you are in an art museum. It makes for a really fun atmosphere. I usually like to start off with some of their great drinks. The strawberry lemonade is excellent, but I don't order it very often because anyone can easily succumb to a sugar coma after a glass or two. The passion fruit tea is pretty good, too, with a hint of fruit in it. I think you can purchase it from them, but I'm not sure on that. It's good enough to make at home in my opinion.  If you are ordering an appetizer, order the avocado eggrolls. They are amazing, AMAZING. It can easily be served as an entree. Trust me, I will not steer you wrong. The sauce that comes with it is so good. Try them! Entrees I have tried recently are: Fish tacos- They are ok, nothing that I would order again. I'm not that crazy about corn tortillas, though. If you like them, you may like these. Miso salmon- Out of this world! I've tried to duplicate it at home, and it never turns out like theirs. It's a bit expensive, so it usually becomes the ""birthday meal"" for me when I go around that time. Roasted vegetables and goat cheese pizza- It's great to order when you are in the mood for pizza. I recommend! Obviously, most people go for their desserts...cheescake! I have tried a bunch of them over the years, and I recommend all of them. My favorite would have to be a 3-way tie between tiramisu, chocolate raspberry, and Godiva chocolate. Trying a slice of cheesecake is pretty mandatory there. It's the only time I ever actually order dessert from any restaurant. Oh yeah, the whipped cream that they dollop beside every cheesecake is the best I have ever had, ever.  I recently moved away, and the nearest Cheesecake Factory is 6 hours away. Cheesecake Factory, come to Louisiana.  Please?"
Eugene P.,"Santa Clara, CA",15,216,144,4.0,4/23/2010,"We typically go here here a few times especially if we are craving cheesecake or desserts.  It seems that their menu has changed since we were last there.  They added quite a bit more and can get a bit overwhelming.  You really have to make reservations or give yourself 30-45 mins ahead of time, especially during peak hours.  We usually drop our name and then go shopping.  We went during lunch about 30 mins before noon so we got a seat in 10 mins. The inside is quiet large and several table where you can line up to accommodate a large party.  They also have outdoor seating which unfortunately can be extremely bright during lunch.  Typically outdoor seating is faster than indoor but I'm sure you can guess why. We started with the tex mex eggrolls.  To be honest it isn't AS good as the bang bang chicken and shrimp but close.  If you can't take spicy then this is a great appetizer to get. For an entree I got the cashew chicken salad which a decent size.  It can come in both lunch and dinner portions.  The lunch size was plenty for me.  I was going to get the tostada salad but unfortunately they do not serve lunch portions.  The grilled chicken tostada salad is HUGE by the way.  The other entree was the chicken enchilada.  The sauce was really good.  I can't remember if this comes as a lunch special/portion but it was the same price as the salad. We finished off with the mango key lime and Stefanies red velvet cheesecake.   To be honest the red velvet cheesecake is a little overrated because the cake is slightly stiff.  The trick is to order it take out and let it sit for 15-30 mins.  It melts in your mouth after you do that. The food is good, the desserts are good, the drinks are good, the price is a little on the higher side (but expected), and its at a good location.  The only downside is the wait."
Jason T.,"Jacksonville, FL",49,9,,4.0,5/11/2011,"Great food and generous portions, bit pricey. Awesome no sugar added cheesecake."
Kim H.,"Ormond Beach, FL",37,202,113,4.0,8/21/2010,It is a standard Cheesecake Factory. I thought the service was good and speedy. The food was pretty good too.
David R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,14,,4.0,3/29/2010,"My wife and I have been to this place a few dozen times over the years.  I can explain why some of these reviewers are giving 5s and some are giving 3s: the items on the menu are really hit-or-miss.  The menu is really quite large and i promise you that some of the dishes work much better than others.  The bang-bang-shrimp, as multiple other people have mentioned, is great.  If you like a spicy shrimp dish, it's sure fire.  I'm not going to go through the whole menu and pick winners/losers, but I've had 2 or 3 meals here that were really quite bland or even tasted poor.  If you ask the servers they'll often tell you about dishes that are on a trial basis or dishes that they didn't like themselves.   One of my least favorite things about this place is that they never seat you as quickly as they claim.  If they say it will be '20 minutes' then it will be 45.  Every time."
Burger G.,"Jacksonville, FL",6,24,,4.0,4/9/2012,"The Cheesecake factory was our next target for doing a burger review.  One of the reasons was that I heard they had a Kobe burger.  Let me get right to the meat of things sorte say. Right from the start I have to say the burger looked great.  Everything looked fresh, well presented. Cutting open the burger was perfectly cooked just how I ordered it.  Now, here comes the important part.  Was my first bite the wow factor that I expected.  Well, yes and no.  I was looking for that, oh my God, this is Kobe meat. The cows that are feed only the best and from what I've seen on TV being massaged to make the meat nice and juicy.  Hmmm, maybe I was expecting someone to come by and massage me while I'm eating this.  I really don't know what I expected.  But, it didn't happen.  Now for the overall taste of the burger I have to admit.  That was one great tasting burger.  It was juicy, well seasoned, perfectly cooked.  Everything a burger should have.  Did I taste anything different?  Sorry to say, I didn't.  As from some of our previous reviews you can get some great tasting burger from regular beef.  Would I recommend this burger to someone?  Absolutely.  It was a great, great burger.  One of best I had and for this they get a high score from us as a 8 out of 10 for burgers.  To read our entire review, please visit us at   and check out our other reviews for the best burger in Jacksonville.  Lucky for us Burgergeeks it just means, the hunt continues, for the holy grail of Burgers....."
Laura T.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,5,,5.0,5/17/2009,"I go to Cheesecake factory often. I really like their ""Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta.""  Cheesecake often a mighty big portion for a good price. Usually I go with a group of friends and we usually just share our plates with each other. It's often busy there but there is privacy between the booth. The service is quick and the people are nice. The only thing I would not recommend is their ""Orange Chicken."" Other than that, everything on the menu is delicious."
Ali P.,"Chester, VA",3,24,,4.0,8/15/2010,"The appetizers are the best here! We had the Sushi Tuna Ahi and the rest of them sounded very tantalizing. The crunchy noodles added superb excitement that flirts with your tongue. We got the kids corn fritters it had a lot of batter in it. Don't fill up on appetizers or the entree' wait for the Cheesecake! For my entree' I got the Jamaican Shrimp & Chicken with mango salsa with white rice. The blend of  mango and cilantro was exquisitely delightfully with the sweet tang in the shrimp. Overall I felt I took a mini journey to the Caribbean with every bite! My sister had the beef ribs ( supposedly the best on the menu for $26.00) In my opinion you can buy it yourself at the grocery yourself and add some seasoning throw that in the oven yourself!!! We topped the lunch off with the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's insanely suppose to be an "" food orgasm in your mouth"" as my sister said, but I would say the taste is ""delightfully entertaining and expected at the Cheesecake Factory"".....=) Good eating!!!"
Alen L.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,25,,5.0,2/21/2009,"I'm shocked no one had reviewed The Cheesecake Factory yet. Located in the heart of the St. John's Town Center, it's a very popular spot to stop by for dinner and/or dessert and is typically extremely busy in the evening. Though I've had their cheesecake before, tonight was the first time I ate dinner there. We ate outside, where it was certainly less noisy and busy than inside. Though it was a bit chilly, the patio was heated, which was definitely a nice touch. The service was solid, especially when you consider that the waiter was obviously having a very long time and seemed ready to collapse at any moment. What amazes me about Cheesecake Factory is the sheer size of its menu. In addition to their beers, wines, and cocktails (which I didn't even look at since I don't drink), they serve a variety of dishes, ranging from hamburgers and pizza to your typical Italian fare, oriental pasta, seafood, and steak. With such a hodgepodge menu, I wasn't sure what to expect about the quality of the food. But my misgivings were soon alleviated. For the appetizer, we ordered the Crispy Crab Wantons (you might know this as crab rangoon). This dish absolutely blew me away. The breading was delicate and fluffy, the crab meat was creamy and practically melted in your mouth, and the accompanying sauce was a perfect compliment to the meat. As hard as it was to choose a main course, I decided to stick with another oriental dish and ordered the Thai Chicken Pasta. Again, I'd say that I made a good choice. It consisted of linguini tossed with sauteed chicken and topped with plenty of vegetables and a hot peanut sauce. The pasta was of the perfect consistency and the chicken was delicious. There was also plenty of it; I took home a little less than half of the dish and will be having it for lunch tomorrow. For desert, I got the Tiramisu Cheesecake. This blend of a traditional Italian custard and fluffy cheesecake served with whipped cream on the side was wonderful and a nice deviation from the norm. Overall, a wonderful experience. An appetizer, dinner for 2, desserts, tax and tip came out to $70."
