April F.,"Tampa, FL",57,113,121,4.0,9/22/2017,Huge menu.  Really good food.  I had a huge salad.  It was so good! The drinks are outstanding.  Our server was excellent. Staff friendly. My husband had the pasta which he insisted I try.  It was so good I took three bites instead of my usual one bite.     Upscale with the best cheesecake.  Need I say more?
Susan A.,"Jacksonville, FL",100,227,497,4.0,8/8/2016,I've been here many times and love it here. Some dishes are better than others but their menu is so big that I'll just keep trying new things. But I love coming here for Sunday brunch. I'm in love with their BRULEED FRENCH TOAST. Love love love!!!! Hubby and I shared this dish along with some sides and it was a lot of food. In my option this may be the best French toast I've ever had.
Jeffrey P.,"Jacksonville, FL",127,61,180,3.0,4/21/2017,The cheesecake is delicious The greeter needs to work on her human skills And the waiter needs to work on his human skills What happened to common courtesy and service Disappointed with the experience of the human interaction
Angela D.,"Jacksonville, FL",194,471,4827,4.0,1/17/2016,"I have only been here a couple of times and each time I have gotten pasta dishes. The food is usually good but the shrimp tends to be severely overcooked. Their veggies however always seem very fresh. The menu is absolutely gigantic so there is bound to be something for everyone which is great. I have never had the cheesecake as I am lactose intolerant but it of course always looks amazing and hurts my stomach just thinking of it.  They have a bar area which really needs to be larger but has an extensive offering just like the menu and desserts.  The service had been good each time. If you go for dinner though, expect a wait. Sometimes you can get seated faster if you want to sit outside. On colder nights they do have the heaters on which on a night like my last visit (it was in he 50's) it made it nicer but hot tea was still required! The prices are a tad high but the portions are a good size I would return with a group but this isn't my first choice if I am on my own."
A J.,"Leesburg, VA",0,13,1,5.0,12/28/2017,"Decided to head out and grab a bite to eat at Cheesecake Factory at the St. John's Town Center in Jacksonville, FL with my daughter and husband.   We were all lucky to get seated at a high top table in the bar area and even luckier when we had an awesome waiter name Anthony aka: Dyre.  We had really good food and service.  My husband and daughter said it was one of the best meals we had at Cheesecake and we are regulars at this location. (Thanks to the cooks in the back, Great Job!) The chocolate milkshake was the best we ever tasted and a really nice portion size. The atmosphere was nice this evening and everyone seemed happy around us!  My family always talks about how customer service is so bad anymore wherever you go, but not here.  We were so happy to get our server Dyre because he was kind, polite, efficient and the bonus.... very handsome.  (My 17 yr old said to say that)  The menu has everything on it for all taste buds and we have always had exceptional service with our wait staff, which says a lot about the management when it comes to picking their top notch employees!   We will definitely be back here for many future meals and great cheesecake!"
Alexandra M.,"Jacksonville, FL",60,104,491,3.0,10/2/2016,"I rarely come here just because of the crowds. The atmosphere is great, the waitress and waiters are normally very nice and helpful. My last experience here wasn't as great.  We got seated in a tiny nook at the back of the restaurant, which normally would be great but not this time.  Our waiter started the evening by stating he was leaving soon and someone would be taking his place, then proceeded to try to rush us to order, maybe so he wouldn't have to come back?  We placed our drinks and ordered two apps, the fried mushrooms turned into an argument- he said just mushrooms and not avocado and zucchini with it wasn't allowed. You had to get a mix of all three. Well my friend had ordered just the mushrooms multiple times before with no issue.  A whole later or drinks came out and there was something floating in mine, we had to wait about 15 minutes for him to come back.  At this time we managed to order with him and beg for bread for about the 3rd time. (Normally it's brought out)  FINALLY his relief came, she was awesome. Continuously checked on us, packed our food up and brought cheesecake. All in a timely manner.  I understand you're getting off work and you won't be receiving a tip from the tables around us, BUT you choose to be a waiter- suck it up and work like you would be receiving a tip until your relief shows up. Otherwise change jobs... The fried cheese was delicious and so was the fried mushrooms!  I had the orange chicken, I wasn't a fan of honestly and my friend had the crusted chicken breast with mashed potatoes. It smelt amazing and she said it was yummy, wish I would've ordered it So many options, can't go wrong."
Becky W.,"Lake City, FL",0,11,7,5.0,9/22/2017,"I'm writing this review because of how awesome our waitress was! And of course the cheesecake was amazing too! Patty went above and beyond our expectations. She was friendly, funny and brought out extra cookies and choc chips to top one of the desserts with. It may sound like a small thing, but she really did care about us!"
Kassie C.,"Jacksonville, FL",200,100,414,3.0,12/2/2015,"I'm really not sure what all the hype is about over Cheesecake Factory. After multiple visits I'm just not a big fan. If the review was based strictly on the cheesecake itself than yes I would give at least 4 stars because it is delish! Pricey but delish! As far as the food, I have yet to leave impressed. The last time I came to Cheesecake Factory I ordered buffalo chicken strips off the appetizers for $10 and they tasted like frozen, heavily breaded chicken tenders. I also got an angry orchard cider and with tip it was right over $20. Just seems pricey for the quality of food you receive. I have also had several of the specialty cocktails which are also very good but again expect to pay $10-$12.  For two people, with an appetizer, 2 entrees, a dessert and a few cocktails be prepared to spend well over $100.  I hear they have a decent happy hour so perhaps that may be a better idea than a full blown dinner."
Ilsa M.,"Jacksonville, FL",354,283,395,5.0,11/15/2015,"So this place is amazing. My girlfriends and I went here after a night out and loved it! Our server was awesome. He was honest and so helpful. Not once did I think about something I ""needed' because he was attentive and on top of things. I had the salmon dish with broccoli and mash potatoes. My dish was huge.  I had salmon for leftovers which was great! The mash potatoes were perfect! SO yummy. And the broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked. I also ordered a glass of prosecco which completed my dinner nicely. Being on a gluten free diet I couldn't eat the cheesecake or try there bread but I loved my meal and will for sure come back ! Both of my friends were very satisfied with there entrees as well. I am not sure how this night is during prime time as we came after rush hour ( around 11pm) but I look forward to the next time I can go here."
Hope M.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,5.0,8/26/2017,I love this place! All the workers are very kind and professional. My husband and I were able to get in very quickly. The food was delicious and our waiter Aaron was kind and efficient! The manager Kenny even came by to check if everything was ok several times! They truly care about the Customer!
Brittney G.,"Tallahassee, FL",477,220,137,5.0,1/4/2017,Just divine. Anytime I am on my way back to Tallahassee I stop in for a piece of cheesecake. One time I even took back a mini six inch cheesecake and froze half of it to eat later. Service is efficient and friendly. This place is always crowded.
Ralph S.,"Miramar Beach, FL",33,339,538,4.0,6/18/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant. I have eaten in them from one side of the country to the other. The menus are not unique in each restaurant so when going to one of their locations, one can be quite certain the dishes that will be available. So, while there is less drama or concern about a restaurant one may have when going to a mom and pop restaurant in a strip shopping mall, the chain is successful for a reason. The food is very good, there is a long menu and their desserts are hard to resist. On our latest visit to a Cheesecake Factory in Jacksonville, FL, I opted for a pasta dish with angel hair pasta, shrimp with garlic and on a bed of asparagus. The pasta was perfect. The shrimp were very flavorful and also cooked perfectly. I even liked the asparagus which is not often a dish that I favor.  My dining companion has a flatbread margherita dish that would pass for a margherita pizza in many restaurants but it is not as thick. I was not offered any of the dish so I cannot speak from personal experience but my lack of tasting opportunity was due to the fact it was very good and she wanted to eat all of it herself. I like the low calorie menu options that are available for those who care about such things while eating at a restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory. Options are good and I usually order off of this menu although sometimes I will finish the meal with a piece of the red velvet cheesecake. If I were in therapy, no doubt the psychologist would make something out of this foible. There are about 40 different flavors of cheesecake that will either appeal to everyone or generate stomach problems when thinking about the possibility of consuming so many calories at one meal.  I have never had a piece of any of the options that I did not like. Enjoy the dessert and plan on hitting the gym shortly. There is a good wine list at the Cheesecake Factory as well. It is not one that would put a good Italian restaurant to shame but still there are plenty of choices and the prices are reasonable. I like the restaurant. I still do not understand the decor. It looks like a large bar and dining area sitting inside of an Egyptian pyramid. Interesting and good conversation piece with no apparent reason for the selection. Anyone eating here could be forgiven for thinking they are on a movie set playing the role of a movie extra chowing down a large meal topped off with a large piece of cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is worth a trip. Not very expensive for the quality of the food and portion sizes served."
Dick E.,"Jacksonville, FL",12,22,,5.0,12/27/2016,"Had lunch there with my daughter over the holiday and it was terrific.   There menu has something for everyone.   The salmon firecracker wraps are delicious! Most importantly was there service, sat in the Bar area and had Nicole C as our server who was unbelievably attentive and just fun to have around.   I will ask for her when I go back in the future."
Sheterra S.,"Jacksonville, FL",288,321,694,4.0,3/15/2016,"I have an extreme love/hate relationship with The Cheesecake Factory! I love everything on the menu, I hate that its so unhealthy! They do have a skinnylicious menu to come to their defense but the regular menu is where its at! My favorites are the  Miso salmon, avocado egg rolls, firecracker salmon rolls and the fresh strawberry cheesecake mmmmm with a mojito or two and i'm in heaven!  The staff is friendly, I have always been grateful to have an awesome waitress, theres happy hour in the bar area starting at 4pm and they have curbside takeout. Although I complain about the calorie intake, thats not the reason I took off one star. My last visit I was eating alone and was approached several times by this employee who was insistent on getting my phone number. Its flattering but so unprofessional and quite annoying, nonetheless my addiction out weights his desperation so I will be back sooner than later :)"
Angela M.,"Savannah, GA",0,24,1,3.0,7/23/2017,Not the best Cheesecake Factory. The corn cakes were really mushy and the steak Diane was very lacking in flavor. Cheesecake was good as always.
Pamela B.,"Leesburg, GA",8,2,,4.0,7/30/2017,Loved the burger...the service was great and oh my goodness the cheesecake was amazing. We got the s'more one and it was so good!
LaTonaya B.,"Orange County, CA",14,104,3,5.0,7/24/2017,Great food great service...Jessica was our server & she checked on us frequently & provide service with a smile & friendly attitude.The place was clean even though it was packed.Cheesecake is very consistent with their service & food & they did not let us down
King S.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",0,5,,1.0,10/14/2017,"Horrible... I would just leave it at that but apparently I am required to write more.  Water was leaking from the ceiling.  When brought to the waitresses attention, she acknowledges it's been a problem all night.  The manager is totally incompetent and probably would not cut it at McDonald's. Wants to dust the ceiling above the tables while they eat.  On top of that the food Service was terrible.   They could not even keep water in the glass."
Karena R.,"Jacksonville, FL",97,269,322,4.0,8/21/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory-this particular location is always, always crowded. The wait was forever but because we chose to sit outside we waiting about 10 minutes but the line on this day was out the door. Today I experienced eating off the skinny menu. I ordered the crab cakes and the tacos. The crab cakes were to die for-just enough but I wasn't a fan of the lettuce tacos. Not something I'd order again. Our server was very pleasant. Will definitely go back."
Skye K.,"Jacksonville, FL",48,3,,1.0,6/19/2017,"my wife and I just left the Cheesecake Factory thats located at 10260 midtown parkway Jacksonville Florida. we both ordered alcohol beverages, as my wife orders a mai Thai. It was very good at first but when she got to the middle of the drink it was very unbearable and she had me take a sip. it took everything in me to not spit it out on the table. I asked the server if she could take the drink back because my wife wasn't satisfied. so the the server went to take it back and came back out to see what was so bad about it. while she was inside she told the manage, Kenny, that she didn't like the drink and he came outside to talk to her about it. and asked what was wrong with the drink, proceeded to say that my wife asked him to take it off the bill, which she never said. and then he said that he can't because it was more than half way gone, which it wasn't. and she looked at him saying I never said that, all I wanted was it to be taken back. he said that he will take it off anyways, while he was giving her attitude. so she wanted to leave as we didn't finish our food because he was very rude to her. as he was leaving she asked if we can get to go boxes and as he was walking back in he said under his breath that he isn't going to bring us boxes that he will get someone else to do it because he said that he felt very uncomfortable.  as he approached us in the beginning not asking about our food, I could tell that he already started off on the wrong foot, he was being judgmental to us before the situation occurred because I took my wife out for dinner, which might I add I am also a woman and in a bi-racial relationship. his customer service skills were very poor. on our way home my wife decided to call them and asked to speak to him again. so she could understand what he said to her as he was walking away. and he responded with I felt very uncomfortable, as he interrupted her. and then he said that I am not staying on this phone to argue with you and then he hung up on her.  I will never be eating there again. besides the issues that I stated above my wife asked for her burger medium well and it came out well done."
