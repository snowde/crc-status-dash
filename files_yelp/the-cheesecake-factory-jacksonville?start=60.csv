Rob C.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,4,4,4.0,10/17/2016,"I went on a Monday night to watch football at the bar and to have dinner. The atmosphere was very pleasant and professional. The lighting and music levels were spot on. They both complimented my experience. For dinner, I had the pasta Carbonara. It was perfect.  The egg sauce was delicious. The pasta was al dente. The peas were firm. The amount of bacon was nice and subtle. I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake for desert. The cheesecake was very nice.  After the healthy portion size of the pasta I did not want a huge slice of cheesecake. The size of the slice was just what I wanted, reasonable and not gargantuan. The lemon and raspberry flavors worked very well together neither overpowered the other. The ladyfingers cookie crust was a very pleasant surprise. The price of my Beefeater martini was the only disappointment of my evening. The $12 price was a little steep but not a deal breaker."
Maria W.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,,1.0,9/14/2017,I had the deer headlight moment when the manager (female) told me that we don't taste our food before it comes out.  This is after the spring rolls reeked of fish.
Maya C.,"Jacksonville, FL",207,524,2099,4.0,10/27/2015,"Some friends were in town and both of them liked cheesecake but had never been to ""The Factory"". Mom and I decided to meet them one Sunday morning for brunch. Now I've been to the Town Center that early before so I knew where I could find a parking spot easily. (Nope, not sharing hahaha). We all met up and walked inside. It's about 11:45-Noon and there was no wait. Thank god. We sat in a booth on the side near the front. The ""Jags in London"" game was on and the bar area was full and glued to the TVs. Not interested. We spent most of the time gabbing but we did over food, eventually. I got a Strawberry Lemonade to drink and it was good but sweet. Most of the syrup was on the bottom. And the glasses it came in were huge! Wow. I spent most of the time stuck on the brunch and eggs & omelettes menu inserts since it was still that time and settled on the Crab Hash: Sauteed Crab, Red, Yellow, and Green Peppers, Onions and Potatoes, and topped with two Poached Eggs with Hollandaise Sauce. My dining companions were skeptical about that dish like, how much crab, is it real crab, is there a lot of hash, etc. But I bit the bullet, it sounded good and I was gonna get it. Our server was very attentive and brought us bread service and oh my goodness. I loved that the bread was of different varieties and the butter, while packaged, tasted freshly churned. It was about 15-20 mins before our food came out and I tore into it, after my family inspected it. It was delicious! Everything was great. I couldn't eat the toast that also came with it or all the potatoes. But that's ok. I was saving room for dessert I'd been told beforehand that they had Mango Key Lime Cheesecake so I only focused on that one and got it. The cheesecake was good but I really wasn't feeling the layer of shredded coconut on top of the crust. That's just my preference though.  Go get your cheesecake fix but go early!"
A S.,"Washington, DC",13,12,61,5.0,5/12/2017,"Love this place for any occasion! I feel that when I eat at Cheesecake Factory my food is being prepared by world class chefs. As crowded and busy a place it is, they seem to operate the place as a smooth machine."
Steve J.,"Selma, NC",0,7,,1.0,9/3/2017,This was a bad idea. I urge anyone who is considering this place to reconsider. For my son's 18th birthday which was today he chose this place. After a lengthy wait they brought out food that was just as good as anything you might find in a Chef Boy R Dee can. The pasta was undercooked and hard. The chicken was cold and dry. You really have to work hard to ruin spaghetti but in this effort they succeeded. Upon calling out the disinterested manager I was still presented with a bill for $100.00. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a meal.  I hate that a bad and expensive mistake caused such a blemish on my son's birthday.
Sharde N.,"Jacksonville, FL",112,82,226,5.0,6/11/2016,"Not my first time at the Cheesecake Factory and definitely not my last.  I ordered the Stuffed Chicken Tortillas and the Tex Mex eggrolls and as usual its always good. I also ordered an Arnold Palmer and it was not good, the Sweet tea wasnt very sweet and the lemonade was pretty sour."
Kim M.,"Jacksonville, FL",159,180,394,2.0,5/15/2016,"We were excited to find a place that could accommodate our large group, however service is less than average.  Remember that I mentioned we were seated immediately so waiting over an hour for our food is unacceptable.  Our drinks were not refilled without begging. Apparently since root beer was flat, I would want water, other options weren't even offered yet he still charged us for our sodas. .  Our food was decent for the most part once it finally arrived except that the steak sandwich was poor quality meat. The eggplant Parmesan is delicious but served with a pesto pasta that was dry (most likely from sitting). The manager was understanding and I would assume appreciative for constructive criticism because it always leaves an opportunity to turn the situation around. I will give them a chance to make a few changes before visiting again."
BobbieJo S.,"Hoboken, GA",25,17,12,5.0,7/11/2016,This was my first time here. We went for my birthday. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful!! Very helpful. Explained the foods to us very well. I got a mixed drink which was yummy but costly! $13!! I have never paid that much for a mixed drink lol. The food was soooo delicious! I can't remember what mine was called but it was fried. Chicken fillets in an amazing pasta and sauce!! Of course we finished it off with a slice of Cheesecake. I just had to have the red velvet cheesecake. Absolutely the best cheesecake I have ever eaten in my life!! Oh we also had yummy appetizers too. It is a little pricey but it was soooo good!!!
Summer P.,"Palm Coast, FL",0,8,,5.0,2/27/2017,My Favorite place to eat. The best food and service I ever had. The management is awesome and efficient. I highly recommend Taylor at the bar. Waiters are outstanding . I highly recommend Ryan C or Josh. Are my favorites.  The best service in town. I go there often to eat and always very happy when I leave.
Errol J.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,5,1,5.0,2/25/2017,Cheesecake Factory was crowded as usual with a 30 minute wait. But this time the wait went faster than normal for a afternoon. The food was excellent and the waitress never allowed or drink to get half empty. I didn't get her name but she was very courteous friendly knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. We will most definitely be returning
Madison S.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,19,,5.0,8/2/2017,"Great for a large group of people! There is something on the menu for everyone! And not to mention, the cheesecakes are to die for!"
Daisy D.,"Jacksonville, FL",308,1485,1829,4.0,8/14/2014,"It may be a  big chain. It may be a big restaurant. And it definitely has a big menu. But it's consistently delicious and that wins big in my book. On one of our recent trips to the Town Center we decided to pop in to an old stand by; we opted to grab a seat at the bar rather than wait for a table.   We ordered the salmon firecracker rolls to start. They are one of the highlighted items on the 'lighter options' menu. Definitely a tasty option and I loved that they weren't rolled in a heavy wrapper. Just the thinnest of wrappers that provided just the right amount of crunch. It's perfect for two people to share because you each get two pieces.  For my entree, I went with the Eggplant Parm Sandwich. Definitely a knife and fork kind of sandwich as it is top heavy with eggplant. My only complaint about the meal would be the preparation on the eggplant. I've learned to salt my eggplant (multiple times) at home to pull out all the excess water. It helps it not be as spongy in cooking. While I still ate every bite, the eggplant was approaching spongy. The sammie is so large, I had enough leftover to repurpose half my sandwich into a whole second sandwich the next day for lunch. Pressed eggplant held up very well.  We skipped on the cheesecake this time, but it didn't stop us from drooling over the menu. One day I will play it smart and order a small appetizer and a piece of cheesecake. One day..."
Brianna P.,"Savannah, GA",470,6,2,5.0,11/30/2016,"I really like this location. I went there last week and I was impressed by the service and how quickly we received our food. I ordered the veggie burger and my friend ordered the Miso Salmon. When I received my food, the fries were a bit cold, I mentioned it and she quickly went to the back and got me a fresh and piping hot order. The veggie burger is not no regular boring burger. It is homemade, delicious and very satisfying! Dessert was fabulous, we shared a lemon cheesecake, it was amazing. Overall great ambience, affordable and perfect for a date!"
Skylar F.,"Jacksonville, FL",83,1,,1.0,7/29/2017,"looking forward to treating myself to one of them fancy burgers, i called up the factory and i said to them ""hey there i'll take one of your fancy burgers."" 24 dollars and 30 minutes of standing in the to go line later, skylar fain i got back home to enjoy my fancy burger. lo and behold i open the to go box and they had put the damn thing on a loaf concrete with razor sharp edges an the damn taste of a damn assed dominoes pizza box manufactured from hot dog lunchables and fingernail spunk."
Nyla S.,"Jacksonville, FL",534,337,1181,4.0,11/1/2014,"Our first double date took place two weeks ago. It was a Saturday night and of course we chose the worse day to go to the cheesecake factory. It was packed wall to wall, and outside so we had a hour wait.  Our waiters name was Tre(something) he wasn't really attentive to our particular table but showed his other customers great attention. For that he lost $20 off his tip. The food took some time but our great conversations overlooked that small details. We had the spicy chicken nachos for the appetizer and they were amazing. Definitely enough to share with four ppl. We also ordered a Thai dish, the gumbo, meatloaf mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, and steak. The food was very good, we all seemed to like each other's more than our own. Cheesecake selections: Plain, Turtle and two Red Velvet cheesecakes. They were amazing, of course, I mean it isn't called the cheesecake factory for nothing. Go in the morning/afternoon time to avoid the rush of the night owls. Other than that it's truly a great experience."
Jean L.,"Tallahassee, FL",131,53,57,5.0,8/2/2015,"Even when this place is crowed, the service was great. It took our food no time to get to us and our server did great keeping our cups full.  The Louisiana Pasta Chicken is always my favorite from here."
Nikki S.,"Jupiter, FL",100,13,,5.0,8/5/2016,"There's something for everyone. The size of this menu does not allow you to say you're not in the mood for this restaurant. Whether it's Asian, Italian, or continental, it's on there. Oh, and the cheesecakes good too lol.  Great for meetings, family meals, shopping days, ANY days. Good job CF!"
Kayla E.,"Akron, OH",53,62,100,4.0,2/17/2016,"Ohhhhh man.... This was honestly my very first time at Cheesecake Factory..

alan K.,"Odessa, FL",0,41,5,1.0,10/9/2016,$17.00 for two slivers of cheesecake!   Never again.  Village Inn slices are twice the size and half the price.   The cheesecake is not that good.  I calculated wth the size of the cake and the size of my slice it was a 170.00 cake.
Alexis S.,"Middleburg, FL",115,10,2,3.0,12/23/2016,"Love how late this place is open! Food is very average but always come here after dinner to get cheesecake to-go. Hershey's chocolate cheesecake is my go-to, soooo good."
