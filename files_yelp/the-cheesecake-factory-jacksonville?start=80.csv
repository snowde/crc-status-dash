Christine A.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,2.0,1/6/2017,I just left from the Cheesecake Factory and I'm very fair when it comes to writing a review. But I was very disappointed in my experience. We were sat right away which was awesome for a Friday night. Our waitress was nice but very very slow...drink refills had to be asked and then were even forgotten. Our meals were good and came out in a timely fashion but my alcohol drink was very weak. It was disappointing because the drink was actually tasty. There was just way to many waiters and waitress standing around together talking verse doing their job. The floors were extremely slippery as usual but with the rain I would of expected them to try and make it more safe. Sorry to write a crappy review but this place just isn't worth the money!
Lisa G.,"Jacksonville, FL",80,12,29,5.0,4/27/2016,"I hadn't been here in a few years because last time I went the food was mediocre for a not so mediocre price. We got giftcard for my birthday so we figured we'd give it another shot. Suprisingly - EVERYTHING we had was good!! I had the crabcake balls for appetizer and, for entree, an Asian salad (forget the name), my husband had steak and we were very satisfied.. our waiter was amaaaaaazing!!!... definitely changed my mind!!"
Laytan G.,"Jacksonville, FL",22,14,35,2.0,4/16/2016,"I'll start off by saying that I only ever go to the Cheesecake Factory if someone I'm with suggests it. Their menu is way too long and the food is very basic. I've been here several times and I've never been thrilled at the food or the service. It's all just ok... This time I got a Cesar salad and a margarita pizza. Neither were very good and both tasted bland.   The lighting is dim and the decor is very wannabe-fancy. People do come here a lot for special occasions so there's a lot of people dressed up but there's also plenty of people in cutoff jean shorts as well so I wouldn't say it's very classy.  The cheesecake is really good, and they're open really late at night so that's a plus. But honestly the food, wine and drinks are just so overpriced and not very good that I don't really like coming here. It's always really busy on the weekends and parking is a nightmare at the town center unless you wanna walk far or use the valet."
Kathleene C.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",2,27,21,4.0,10/13/2016,"OK I've eaten at the cheesecake factory before and I'm not impressed. The food is American cuisine  so they have most of people's favorites. I like the  strawberry cheesecake best. When I'm in the mood to adventure I try,  different flavors. But  sometimes I just stick to what I know   Best."
Cathrine C.,"Newport News, VA",389,343,506,4.0,1/29/2015,"I came here for my wedding reception and it was kind of a pain getting it set up, but they made it happen. We did their ""call ahead"" seating, which doesn't work like a reservation and you need at least 15 people in your party to be seated in a big space. WELL, in this case we had 25 and they made it work for us on a Saturday at 430pm (THANKS GUYS!!!!).  Everyone we said that was going to come, came. And it was wonderful. The customer service was great and they kept our tables full of food and our glasses of water, soda, and wine full. Appetizers and food came very fast. They may have been trying to get us to go, but we took our time, after all, my family did spend a lot of money there for everyone to eat.  I think heading OUT of the restaurant was the WORST. It's so packed and everyone is just standing inside waiting to get seated. It's a pretty noisy restaurant too, but it's because it's so open. I had a great time with good people and yummy food. I ordered the calamari, the BangBang Chicken and Shrimp (HUGE PORTION, good for like 3-4 people), and a pina colada - DELICIOUS. ALL OF IT, DELICIOUS.  I have never been let down by Cheescake Factory. Worth the wait for sure. Just shop around while you're waiting."
Patty G.,"Saint Johns, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/31/2016,"They make fantastic cheesecake but boy they make you work for it!  Can't find the line to stand in at the walk in counter to buy a slice or whole cake. Cashier just shouting for ""next customer"" and thereso many people waiting to be seated and waiting for "" to go orders"" there is zero organization to any form of a line.  Get your act together Cheesecake Factory. Your cake may be good but it's $7+ dollars a slice AND you have to fight your way through the line and pushed and shoved .  Maybe do your customers a favor and buy a stanchion or two."
Ana N.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,31,14,2.0,9/20/2016,"I like the Cheesecake Factory but haven't been since I witnessed one of planet earth's oldest inhabitant (read: cockroach) crawl on the wall next to my table. The cockroach did not touch my food, well, not that I have noticed, but its sight terminated my appetite. Perhaps a cuter animal, something like an iguana, would have been more pleasant."
Lisa P.,"Jacksonville, FL",191,75,11,3.0,9/17/2016,"Had two polar opposite lunches here this past week. One on a non-busy Tuesday and the other on a much busier Friday. No problems with the first lunch, except maybe a while to get the check if I'm nitpicking. Food was delicious, full of flavor. Loved the ratatouille and broccoli sides specifically which had lots of garlic. Yum-o! They have a big healthy menu called Skinnylicious and mom I both had salads the vegetable one for me and the chopped Cobb for her. Both were really good and full of vegetables and toppings abd almost more stuff in the salad the lettuce. On Friday I ordered the same thing and noticed there were very little vegetables in my vegetable salad mostly lettuce. When I told the waitress she said ""oh I can bring you some on the side"". Also had the salad drenched in salad dressing which I had clearly ordered on side and the waitress had repeated it back to me. When I asked the waitress to take it back she rolled her eyes at me. Sorry that would warrant a 1 star rating from me automatically but based on the great lunch Tuesday I averaged the stars. Maybe it was an off day, but I don't really think being busy is an excuse for bad service. Also noticed how the broccoli came out almost raw Friday and completely plain with no garlic nothing. It didn't taste very good and almost broke a tooth trying to chew it. I hate sending food back so I ate it, but come on some constancy would be great. I think it's more of a kitchen issue then waitress issue, but rolling eyes is a big no no."
James G.,"Jacksonville, FL",21,70,91,3.0,2/2/2016,"An exceeding average and commercialized restaurant. My partner and I decided this would be a great last minute supper location. We were seated quickly, but at the smallest table for two I've ever seen. With less than two feet between tables, it was very awkward sitting down. The other side effect of packing in customers is the noise level makes it hard to have conversations. It was disappointing. It took awhile using their weird lengthy menu, flipping through alternating advertisements and menu items. I feel the ""healthy"" items are unnecessary, no one comes to The Cheese Cake Factory to eat healthy. The extra dishes just bloat the menu even more. I suppose they couldn't cram as many customers in if they didn't try to appeal to everyone. Not even going to comment on the décor. Ordered Buffalo Blasts®, which is blobs of buffalo chicken dip battered and fried. They were actually very good and plenty for two people. For my main dish, Pasta With Chicken And Scampi Sauce, it was delicious. Garlic, cream, and pasta! I was hooked as soon as I read it.  Although I admit the food is good, it doesn't make up for a disappointing dining experience. The dinning room was clean, as well the restroom. The staff friendly and efficient. This could have been great, but they sacrifice customer experience for profits."
Liz C.,"Honolulu, HI",2,41,,2.0,2/29/2016,"There was a lot wrong with our visit. For a 100$ minimum meal for 2 people this place was so lame considering you can go to Moxie. Seating: They at first sat us at the smallest tiniest table width wise, and really far length wise. I couldn't hear what my bf was saying across from me, and I was closer to the person next to me than I was to him. I'd rather talk to my date than a random stranger at a nice dinner, so we asked to move. Drinks: We ordered an extra dirty martini. When it arrived, it didn't have any olives in it, so I sent it back to get olives. I feel that this is just common bartending knowledge. I've never gotten a dirty martini that didn't come with olives! Was it just that the bartender didn't care? When it came back I found that it wasn't dirty at all. I sent it back again and it was barely dirty but I didn't feel like sending it back a third time. I feel that to a restaurant that is this expensive and claims to have a bar that an extra dirty martini shouldn't be this complicated. I could have made it better myself and gotten it right the first time. An extra dirty martini shouldn't have to be sent back three times. It is a very simple drink to make. Food: My food, the farfalle pasta with chicken, tasted exactly like the premade frozen bags of pasta in the freezer section. The pasta was undercooked and hard. The sauce came out of a bag. I didn't even want the leftovers. My bf wanted something that wasn't on the menu exactly which threw the kitchen into a loop. We wanted pasta, but wanted some steak chopped on top of it. We were willing to pay for both the pasta dish and the steak separately. Our waiter asked the kitchen if they could do this, but they were too corporate. They couldn't present the dish other than it usually made because it would mess up the plating. To me, that's stupid. So they gave us the steak separate and we had to cut it up ourselves and put it on top of the pasta. I feel that the kitchen could have done this. It wasn't that complicated. Not a big deal but still. Service: Our server was great, two stars are for him! He was only hindered but the lack of drink making skills of the bartender. And the cheesecake was delicious as well."
M O.,"Bellingham, WA",0,9,2,1.0,5/28/2017,"I have never had a bad experience at this place, and I have been to Vegas, Seattle, and many more along the way. This had to have been the WORST experience with out to eat I have had, and mainly because of how the issue was handled. I ordered salmon, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Very simple. My husband had the same with chicken. We assumed that waiting for his chicken, they sat out asparagus and potatoes aside, with my fish, and then finally got his chicken ready. My potatoes were stiff to the point that my fork kind of stuck. I thought it was pretty cold but said oh well let's try the fish. It was also-cold! Not just like warm, cold. I politely asked the server about this and said it was really cold, no problem, just wanted it hot. He brought it back with a scalding hot plate, and mildly luke fish. Potatoes were Luke, and still the same now reheated old mash. How hard would a new scoop of mash have been? I said no I didn't want anything else as it was late and he said ok, left, and hardly offered a piece of bread. Coming by later, asked again about how things were and I thought really? I just sat and watched my husband eat...you could have offered a cracker! I asked my husband to pay while I spoke to the manager, as I did not want a free meal or coupon, and the manager clearly is not going to do anything other than listen to my gripe. I ordered my cheesecake and went on my way, which again, dissatisfaction. Melted merengue! What a joke. I have never been so insulted and quite frankly have never had to return a dish of food. Very insulted."
Raye L.,"Atlanta, GA",32,59,120,4.0,12/30/2015,"Went on a Monday during lunch and ate at the bar. Bartender Anthony recommended his favorite salmon, the miso and it was so so so so so so good!!!! The flavor was a little sweet but perfect. The mashed potatoes were flavorful and the broccoli was immaculate. It was a little over $14 but well worth it! I ate everything on my plate."
Ronnie J.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,12,23,5.0,2/19/2016,"I been here multiple times, but I normally go at lunch to save a few dollars.  The atmosphere is mostly mixed on any given night.  They have a variety of dishes which I admire. The waiter/waitress are normally pretty good.  I know they don't take reservation,  but the earlier you go the better chance you have not to wait. Like I mention earlier in normally go at lunch which the prices are decent, because you can get lunch size portions.  Dinner in would recommend you bring your wallet/ purse. There isn't any Two  for 20.00 going on here."
Misty S.,"Atlantic Beach, FL",168,173,26,3.0,10/12/2015,"First, let me preface with ...it is very corporate.  That being said, it's a decent place to go if you want a massive menu and tons of items to choose from. Obviously, have to try the cheesecakes.  I've tried a number of different ones and they are pretty darn tasty.  I love the fact that they have the skinnylicious menu because it doesn't have as much fat, butter, etc...and I know exactly how many calories I'm sucking down before I can get dessert ;) The staff has been friendly and the servers as well, although they do take a bit of time to bring your drinks and orders, even when it's not busy.  I've been to this location approximately 4 times and it's always the same. I wish there prices weren't so high, but....the food is pretty consistent."
Ginny Z.,"Jacksonville, FL",55,62,39,3.0,9/2/2016,It's ok. Foods good. Service is ok. There are just so many amazing places to go here that you have to be top notch every single time and this was ok.
Boya L.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",73,4,2,5.0,8/9/2016,"Everything was good! We didn't expect to wait on week days though. Cakes are delicious, so does pasta! Spicy chicken chipotle is the best!"
William S.,"Jacksonville, FL",18,38,12,5.0,6/22/2016,"Always always always busy.. I still haven't got a chance to sit and eat here, but I've gotten to-go here and they are amazing. Thanks for the great service even though you're always PACKED!"
Lisa T.,"Jacksonville, FL",30,3,2,1.0,10/17/2016,"I can honestly say one of the WORST experiences EVER.... how difficult is it to put the dressing on the side of a salad..NO CHEESE in an omelette and my entire meal with no refills of drink.  Finally when waitress stops by and asks how is everything we state the problems..no fix no apology...so I am paying 16.00$ for an omelet that I can only eat the edges of ...because as stated NO DAIRY. and still 17min after asking for a refill and finishing our meal got the check, still no refill.  Thank u for a horrible eating out experience."
Danielle C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",478,233,88,3.0,8/24/2014,"I hae been to this location a couple of times now when I go to visit friends in Jax.  The first time I went I sat at the bar and just add some small bites. I also downed about 2 delicious frozen bellinis. Service was decent. They were pretty dead that afternoon. I think the staff was pretty bored, so they weren't too attentive. But my water got filled up every time it was half full!  I did go here for brunch on Father's Day. Why? Well, because I wasn't home for Father's Day, and we were hungover and wanted foooooood! This trip was less enjoyable.  We had to wait to be seated for about 15 minutes--which was fine. We got there right there right when they opened, so the got a bit rushed. Once seated, however, we had to wait for about 30 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order. He was nice, but couldn't handle the amount of tables he had and seemed completely overwhelmed.  We got our drinks, but it was difficult to get refills. After ordering, our food took awhile. So we gobbled down 2 servings of bread. I had just ordered some eggs, bacon, and potatoes. It was decent, but the potatoes were TOTALLY overcooked.  Basically, getting anything extra from our waiter was incredibly difficult and after awhile we just gave up.  I understand it was a Holiday and they were busy, but a chain like this should plan better for these instances. I have gone to better locations in Miami (shocker). Also, the restaurant was not very clean. The floors looked like they hadn't been swept or mopped all weekend.....which is strange because they had just opened when we got there. Oh well, its fine to run here, but we know what we are getting!"
Audrie T.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,1,,1.0,4/10/2017,"The cheesecake here is not baked I house. It comes frozen daily and to be honest, the cheesecake from Sam's Wholesale Club is better and fresher. The restaurant is filthy. The servers just throw their trash wherever they happen to be, which isn't usually anywhere near a trashcan. If they ever got a surprise visit from the health inspector, they would fail, bc of how filthy the place is. The POS stations aren't wiped down from the morning until they close at night. The food is glorified fast food. Truthfully, I've have realer food At Applebee's and most of their cooking was done in the microwave. I've seen roaches at the Cheesecake Factory and the server and cook bathrooms are disgusting!! I've seen cleaner bathrooms at gas stations. This will be continued."
