Christa Y.,"New York, NY",108,102,10,3.0,1/8/2018,"Food: The mushroom croquettes and herb crusted salmon were average. The Jamaican shrimp and chicken was a disaster. For a $20 entree, there are 3 small pieces of shrimp. The dish is described as ""very spicy"" on the menu, but tastes almost sweet with no hint of spice. The chicken taquitos were cold and tasteless with no hint of chicken in them.  Drinks: Absolutely watered down. Service: The server (Dominique K) seemed disinterested, took a while to get the bread, forgot the straw and had to be asked 3 times to get us a box at the end. We saw staff at other tables being much more friendly and attentive to their patrons. Overall: Will never repeat. The Newport Mall has so many better options"
Christie T.,"Randall Manor, NY",6,18,12,3.0,1/1/2018,The wait was not terrible and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was pretty Good but not amazing and it's expected but we have always had a great meal the few times we have gone. The pink lemonade drink was not my style but sounded good so I ordered it And the waitress was kind enough to switch It out for a glass of wine it was just very sweet. The loaded potato ball things were so good as well as the flat bread pizza. Dinner my husband absolutely didn't enjoy his but they changed it out and he got a new dish (to go) by the time he got it. Mine and the kids were just fine. I got 2 cheesecakes to go and just had some today and a piece of paper or something was inside of it so I am not happy about that but not much I can do being it was to go and 2 days later. Overall place was good because of the staff and the food was as expected and somethings tasted great and some not so much.
Voncia H.,"Union City, NJ",0,2,2,1.0,12/27/2017,"Called in ordered for pickup, Angel hair pasta with shrimp. This is what got for $19.50. It's so nasty and only four shrimp, disgusted.  FOUR shrimp really!! So disappointing never again!"
Chao X.,"Manhattan, NY",67,135,630,4.0,12/12/2017,Occasion: Casual lunch It was one of the days I craved pasta for lunch! So a colleague and I went to Cheesecake Factory to fulfill our pasta starvation!  Overall: Maybe it's because I didn't expect much from Cheesecake Factory but to me the food was actually more than decent! We shared 1 Jambalaya Chicken linguini and 1 huge quac with chips. The portion was so huge that we were so full and couldn't finish all of them.  Highly recommend:  Jambalaya Chicken Linguini Two kinds of linguini - regular and green - were covered with delicious sauce! Chicken was cooked perfectly - charred outside but juicy and tender inside! Definitely get this when you get a chance! But only large portion is available for this dish so recommend sharing among at least 2 friends  Guacamole with chips Even though it's not anything special - the chips are freshly fried and guac was well flavored! The portion is more than enough to feed 3 people.
Nzingha Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",112,43,519,4.0,11/10/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a no brainer establishment...why? because you know exactly what you're going to get! Good food! Oddly enough whenever I've gone to the Cheesecake Factory I never order cheesecake as my dessert...I haven't figured out yet why that always happens. Well anyway I ordered simple food today...crab bites, bang bang shrimp, Chinese chicken salad and Passionfruit Mojito. Let me get right to the point and close this post. Crab Bites Salad and Mojito and even the table wheat bread...I LOVE !!!!....but, those Shrimp were tasteless bland...blah blah blah I sent em back and got another order of the Crab Bites instead...then I was happy.  I also love how the Newport Mall now has made steps to improve the eateries and slowly the quality of shops...okay I'm done with this post..G'night!"
Marissa Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",739,1111,1531,3.0,9/29/2017,"Omg  This place is the absolute worst Cheesecake Factory in the USA  Stephanie the server was very nice The problem was my aunts burger was illegally served rare, there was blood on the plate.  Unbelievable.  Even our server Ally was shocked Then Stephanie The manager came by and apologized  That we had to wait for another brother to come out while me and my mother went about our fish plates The server offered my aunts a glass of wine while she waited and said that it would be comped We finally get the bill and of course there's two glasses of wine on the bill Stephanie approached the table And me told her that there was two glasses of wine when we were already told that The one glass would become we thought it was a simple mistake but Stephanie told us that Ally should've known better that it's illegal to comp alcohol in the state of New Jersey Actually it's illegal to serve warm eat undercooked to a person to consume.  She said that she could not take the wine off of the bill nor is she able to take the burger off when my aunt finally got the broker my mother and I were already finished eating Absolutely terrible Stephanie's attitude was like ""oh well"" No she did not offer a complimentary slice of cake- no we didn't want cheesecake, only what was promised.  It took the general manager Gilbert hear about it from Ally and we explained and he took off the burger G was very nice, so was our server,  The Asst Manager Stephanie is rude, unprofessional as a manager.  Our problem was Stephanie.  The restaurant was clean, busy Clean bathrooms were clean  I won't return.  Not this location  But thank you Gilbert"
Kenneth C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,34,50,3.0,1/9/2018,"Stopped by here for lunch today with immediate seating!  There was an extended wait for our order, but people watching is fun from the sidewalk patio tables while waiting.  I ordered the Southwestern salad with jalapeños added.  It was very good and the way I wanted it.  The fish tacos my guest ordered was cool on delivery and should have been hot.  The Orange chicken and other orders were satisfactory but nothing to write home about!  This is Avery pleasant dining environment."
Kathy G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",216,130,478,4.0,12/23/2017,"I've had this for many time back in California, and I went here for cheesecake again! It was great! I enjoyed the new flavor I tried and, same as I did before, I finished the whole slice of cheesecake! I appreciated it! This may be too much for people who don't like sweets and heavy cheesecakes."
Stephanie S.,"Jersey City, NJ",280,101,71,4.0,12/30/2017,I come here very frequent and when I do I always always always get the chipotle chicken pasta. Its my ultimate favorite plate on the menu in their massive options. I also occasionally order their calamari which is also great. There seems to always be a HUGE crowd at this establishment which is good. Luckily I was able to find a place in the Bar to sit and not wait on that long wait list to get a table. I never had any issues with the place. Only issue is that they messed up on my orders a couple of times but they always rectify it by either giving it to me for free or offering me something else which is always a plus.
Joy Y.,"New York, NY",215,734,1115,4.0,9/6/2017,"My friend recently moved to an apt building 5 minutes away from here and I will never miss out on an adventure to check out the Cheesecake Factory. We came here for lunch, and when dinner time came, despite not being hungry, we scrolled through Seamless for half an hour until we decided to order from the CF twice in one day. The food from this chain is alway decent but never exceeds expectations other than with its sheer portion size. The inaptly named Skinnylicious menu should just be the regular menu. Even the Superfoods section consists of dishes well over 1k calories. Flavorwise, both the vegan cobb and the salmon salad are tasty, and so is the free bread. My bf's buffalo cauliflower also smelled amazing. Service is generally slow for both dine-in and take-out."
Sam V.,"New York, NY",79,121,256,4.0,9/16/2017,"Um still sitting and waiting for a server after 15 mins of trying to get someone's attention. Only got service after we called over the matre-d  Okay so after we got a server, things went more smoothly. Complimentary warm bread was provided. I ordered the Mac and cheese burger which I thoroughly enjoyed."
Kananaii M.,"Jersey City, NJ",93,10,1,3.0,9/2/2017,"Food is great but the service SUCKS. After sitting at our table for 20+ mins, receiving our kids meal and app, we had to ask our waiter for our waters and complimentary bread. Now, we've been here for about 45 mins and we're still waiting on our entrees while the table around us have been served (yes, they got here after us). I'm at the point where im not even hungry anymore and i just want to grab the check and go. It's even worse that the waitress for the table next to us keeps checking in on them and the food they already received, while we have to flag down our waiter."
Tony J.,"Jersey City, NJ",119,382,43,3.0,8/27/2017,"Shared some appetizers - avocado egg rolls, fried shrimp, and chicken samosas. Generally speaking they were pretty good. For entrees the portion size is ridiculous - if you had appetizers and want to save room for dessert, there's no way to finish a pasta dish without having some left over. I had the Louisiana chicken pasta, which was very tasty but a little bit on the oily side. For dessert we shared a selection of cheesecakes. True to its name, the Cheesecake Factory does make pretty good cheesecakes."
Wei V.,"Jersey City, NJ",194,488,2568,3.0,9/5/2017,"I really wanted to like this place because I am a fan of their cheesecakes from other locations. However, the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake, which I took to go, left a bad taste in my mouth. I wasn't able to have more than one bite. It seemed the nuts went bad somehow."
Sandra M.,"Jersey City, NJ",49,461,329,5.0,12/1/2017,"I'm not one to usually give five stars to a chain... But so far I really like the food here. The Cheesecake Factory and general was where I first discovered a love for sliders. I love the table bread here and recently tried the Truffle bacon grilled cheese appetizer. It was sinfully good. My girlfriend and I shared a filet mignon medium and they let us substitute the mashed potatoes and beans for asparagus and grilled broccoli. The asparagus came at a small of charge though, but that was okay. We actually then order dessert and got Godiva brownie sundae- it was really good. I typically order from the skinnylicious menu, but was craving a protein other than chicken. The Fiji Waters were a bit expensive at about $ 4 a bottle. Also, we were sitting at the bar area with the stroller and the management was nice enough to lower the music a bit as it got very loud early on into our lunch."
Angelica P.,"Jersey City, NJ",593,209,144,2.0,12/28/2017,Wait was surprisingly long but likely because of the holiday week. Staff are nice but slow and not good with busy hours. Had to ask for the bread which came out with entrees. Food was alright. Drinks were okay. Huge space though.
Christine J.,"Sparta Township, NJ",73,116,5,1.0,9/22/2017,"Update to my previous rating. I went back to the Cheesecake Factory to give them another chance after the slow service last time.  This place is awful! I got take out to avoid the poor service all together. And what do I get, at the bottom of my edamame there is A HUGE FUCKING DEAD BUG!!! So disgusting. Will never go back here. Ever again.  They clearly don't care about their customers. Who knows what other unsanitary conditions are in this kitchen!!"
Aparna M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",42,16,22,4.0,8/31/2017,"Looking for a nice ambience but reasonable food? This is the place for you.  About food: it's so delicious. I had chicken samosas and dynamite shrimp in appetizers. Perfect quantity , so soft to eat and delicious.  Shrimp pasta for main course! Enough for 2 people to share and equally tasty. Dessert: the cheese cake! Obviously! It has to be good but this delicious?"
Victor R.,"Jersey City, NJ",165,81,35,4.0,3/24/2017,"No longer do you have to travel to Wayne, NJ for the Cheesecake Factory, here is one in JC.  I like to visit restaurants a few times before reviewing (depending on experience). First off, I never have any issues with the staff, they are all friendly and attentive.  The food has been pretty good so far with my personal favorite being the southern chicken sliders. They offer a few lemonade mixes but all seem to be a little to sweet.  Most recent visit, they have added a few more items to their menu and the kids menu has plenty of different options. My son ordered salmon, broccoli, and French fries which looked and tasted awesome. So far they are holding their own in my book."
Judy C.,"Claremont, CA",181,17,,4.0,12/28/2017,"Wide selection, adequate portion size, above-average taste, okay service, affordable price."
Jeff S.,"New York, NY",1,111,6,1.0,12/28/2017,"Waiter was very good and nice Food - took 30 minutes and one of the items came out cold though they did redo it, though it was just less gross when warm (avoid the nachos; it's mostly cheese whiz and the burger i had was completely underwhelming; I'd much rather have a burger from five guys) if you have to eat at the [ghetto] mall, just get something quick and cheap at the food court; don't overspend and get something gross at this factory"
Bhavnit K.,"Jersey City, NJ",94,81,895,2.0,2/5/2017,I have been to Cheesecake Factory a couple of times in other cities and this one really disappointed me. In terms of portion and quality although service was good. Me and my husband ordered one appetizer of Avocado Toast and an entree of Tuscan Chicken. We split the entree to two.  Avocado Toast- 1/5         It is one of my favorite dish and here at cheesecake it is the worst thing I ever had. The bread was too rough even the avocado spread on it could not make it soggy. Tuscan Chicken - 3/5          It has very small pieces of chicken breast and the plate was covered in oil and lemon juice. Not at all tasty. It says it is a skinnilicious dish but I can see hell lot of calories. Overall the experience of cheesecake factory here in  the mall is very bad.
Sara M.,"North Bergen, NJ",35,63,50,1.0,12/24/2017,Miserable hostess! Server never came to the table! We left! Last minute Christmas Eve shopping and no time for attitude and nonsense from Cheesecake Factory staff.
Christian D.,"Union City, NJ",144,4,,4.0,12/25/2017,The food here is really good but the timing is hot or miss- i ordered chicken parm (pizza style) i really liked my entree and i would order it again.
Gerard R.,"Jersey City, NJ",188,56,8,2.0,10/14/2017,Nothing to see here...Standard Cheesecake Factory you know the deal. Although for some reason the service here is lacking. Prefer the location in the Shops at Riverside in Hackensack.
May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",432,575,457,4.0,12/31/2016,"Came here for dinner one night with the boyfriend and we had a great time. The set up in JC is pretty big and the ""outdoor"" space is really nice. I say outdoor with quotes because you're still sitting inside of the mall, just outside of the restaurant. It was nice and relaxing how they have it set up. Food here is always about quantity, but that's kinda why I like cheesecake factory. They give me a lot, though let me tell you, my stomach regrets it the next day. My go to here is the chicken bellagio, but their chicken sandwich and eggplant parm are my faves too. I usually get cheesecake too (tiramisu is my favorite), but this time, I opted for the apple strudel. It was pretty darn good! I wish they put more ice cream on it though to balance out the warm caramelized apples. Overall, had a great time here and probably will be back!"
Michelle O.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,119,426,3.0,12/3/2016,"This place is always packed! 30 minutes wait for a table for 2 on Saturday at 7:30pm. They hand out buzzers so you can shop around while waiting for the table. Free bread: nice and warm! Whole wheat and white. Chicken Madeira: chicken, melted cheese, asparagus and mushrooms in a wine sauce. Comes with mashed potatoes. It's pretty good, although I felt the wine sauce was a little too sweet. Louisiana style chicken and pasta: Parmesan crusted chicken over bow tie pasta. The chicken was super crispy and great, but the pasta was bland. This dish showed up as the #1 dish to order in Cheesecake Factory in my research. I was surprised when it didn't turn out as good.  Tiramisu cheesecake: when tiramisu and cheesecake married and had a child, this is it. Coffee-soaked lady finger bottoms, mascarpone-cheesecake filling and topped with a layer of chocolate powdered mascarpone cream. My only small complaint is the chocolate cream swirl is too sweet (you can remove it if u want - it's not mixed into the cake). Our 2 entrees could probably feed 3. We brought home leftovers. Our bill was $46. They are running a promo now where if you purchase a $25 gift card, you get a free slice of cake."
Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,116,18,3.0,10/21/2017,"This review is for both dine in and takeout.  My first experience here was dine in, my date and I were seated promptly, waitress was very helpful and well mannered. As an appetizer, we chose the Tex Mex egg rolls. I ordered the farfalle with pancetta, mushrooms, and chicken (minus the peas and carmelized onions that usually come with it). I also opted for spaghettini instead of farfalle and my waiter graciously accepted my alterations. My date went for the chicken alfredo. Both dishes came to us piping hot, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. The Cheesecake Factory goodness that I fondly remember from years ago. Unfortunately my delivery experience was far from as pleasant as the dine in. Last night, via DoorDash, my date and I went for TCF again. He went for the turkey burger with cheese and french fries on the side. I went for the same pasta, instead I got shrimp instead of chicken in it. The food came fairly cold, there were still onions in mine, the shrimp was tough and cold, and they didn't put any pancetta in even though I didn't ask for that to be removed. There was also no sauce in it. It seemed like they made the dish in a pan, drained the remaining sauce and let it sit and dry out for 30 minutes. My date's burger was a little cold but seemingly good, although the fries were no dice; soggy and cold. I know that I had a few alterations but I really can't see myself sending out a such a crappy dish like this, being in their place. Can't see myself ordering delivery from ever again. Not exactly fun spending almost $20 a mediocre, hardly edible dinner."
Satyam K.,"West New York, NJ",8,22,17,1.0,9/2/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I would like to repeat what so many ppl have already said.  This place has HORRIBLE SERVICE. Pathetic !  The order took 35 minutes for two dishes !!! How much time does it take to make Spicy Chicken over rice fellas ?????  They say the dish took longer than usual to make. After 35 min, all We got was cold food. They have no explanation to that. It only means that the food was ready sometime back and they didn't get it to the table. The food was taken back to kitchen and when the re-served one dish had too much salt in it. By then our appetite was over and we got food packed cuz we couldn't eat. They sent their manager to talk to us who turned out to be another waiter.  Bunch of a**holes and liars work here. The whole management & staff needs to be 'fired'. Even after all this, I had to PAY for the late food !!  We are never coming back. And neither We will recommend this place to anyone. There is a reason why this place got 2.5 star as compared to other cheesecake factories. Re-Edit after reading other reviews-- Cheesecake Factory Guest Services ! Plz don't bother apologizing for poor service or thanking for honest feedback. Your manager needs to be fired for consistent poor reviews from so many ppl !"
Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,159,204,4.0,7/16/2017,"Surprised to see a 3/5 for this joint...but it was also my first time here. My friends and I came from NYC just to eat here. I was blown away; never have I given chain restaurants any credit, in fact, it has always been one disappointment after another. But the incredibly high number of calories of each drink, entree, and dessert on this menu only made me want more. I don't really remember the names of the plates we got, but I was surprised to see them range from pasta to Thai to good ol' American. I loved my shrimp pasta and got a good kick out of my friend's spicy Thai chicken (actually don't even know if it's called that). So the lesson is: don't be alarmed that you'll go over your calorie intake in less than 45 minutes and don't let the 1000 items on the menu dissuade you from ordering too much :) Better advice: don't wear skinny jeans to this meal. Oh, and the cheesecake IS amazing. Touché."
david l.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,283,752,4.0,6/21/2017,Came here on a Monday evening after a movie and there was no wait. Food and service was great. The steak and salmon dishes were simply grilled and reminded of a home cooked meal. The Kale Quinoa salad was pretty awesome. The vinaigrette was perfect. Save room for Cheesecake which is always good
Sally W.,"Vancouver, Canada",17,188,308,5.0,1/8/2017,"First time EVER having cheesecake from here and it was amazing! I think this is the best place for cheesecake, really beats anywhere in BC, Canada. Came here for take out got the Toasted Marshmallow Smores Gallore, was told it would take around 5 mins because they torch the marshmallow. No worries, even though we missed our Uber ride because of this, But it was worth it! The cheesecake was light, fluffy and almost melts in your mouth with gooey torched marshmallow anddd that whipping cream!    Love, a Canadian Tourist really wanting to drive to states for this."
Jas M.,"Edgewater, NJ",1,10,8,5.0,10/29/2017,"I dont know how they do that but they have tens of choices in their menu and all of them are great! The buffalo strips are something beyond!!!!! I can eat that everyday! And the caramel salted cheesecake, oh my!!!  Love cheesecake factory! And Brittany served us, she was reeeally nice and sweet! Just one negative thing all of their restaurants smell weird, like wet cloth and it makes me sick when i enter.. just a small thing :)"
Praksshal D.,"Hoboken, NJ",26,6,,5.0,11/27/2017,"I had Shrimp Scampi at this Cheescake location and it was amazing!!!! The service was also amazing, I highly recommend this location!"
Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,4,8,3.0,5/7/2017,"We came over for brunch and we ordered traditional Benedicts, for huge fans of Benedicts on the brunch I must say those were the worst, I would never recommend to order it. Despite on that, I still love this place for for evening, homely atmosphere and for the service which is wasn't bad, but not excellent as well, we had to ask for bread to the dish it should be served with and we never got water on the table.  However, There is one appetizer I would come there for Sweet corn trample cakes. It's it just a gem hidden in the huge ocean of the restaurant's menu! You just gotta try it!  Interior: 5/5 Service: 3/5 Food: 3/5"
Alice P.,"Morristown, NJ",0,1,,5.0,1/3/2018,Loved it. Food exceeded expectations. Maybe the lettuce in the Asian lettuce chicken wrap should be bigger to avoid getting messy. 20 min of waiting time at dinner to get seated.
Frankie M.,"Jersey City, NJ",232,160,1542,4.0,7/18/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is high class chain restaurant that has many options to eat.  It has a wide variety of food that is prepared and presented very well.  I have been to many locations and this one in Newport mall is a smaller one but the good is still very good.  The workers there are very friendly and helpful.  The ambiance is like its other locations, very cozy and intimate.  It does get crowded and you might be waiting some time for a table during peek dining hours.   The food is flavorful a little on the pricey side but it's a better option then most chain restaurants if u don't feel like cooking.  Don't forget to grab yourself a slice of cheesecake heaven.  I don't even like cheesecake or sweets like that but I tried a slice of the salted caramel cheesecake.  WOW!!!! It put me in another atmosphere the lady next to me was laughing Bc my eyes were rolling to the back of my head....yes that feeling!!! Lol."
Sam K.,"Jersey City, NJ",4,91,20,3.0,8/4/2017,Like one of the earlier reviewers said- This place does give the Cheesecake Factory a bad name. Agreed this is in a mall and does get crowded most of the time over the weekends but when it's not- I don't understand what the strategy is in putting your customers on a waitlist despite having plenty of empty tables. The portions are big enough just like at any other Cheesecake Factory. Thrice I have been here and all the three times they got us the molasses(brown) bread late with the meal. Considering that the neighborhood(unless you travel to grove st.) is devoid of good ambience restaurants I might come back.
Dhvani S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,4,4.0,3/2/2017,"Overall, I really love everything about the Cheesecake Factory. They have amazing service, great food, and beautiful ambience.This is my go-to place at least 1 a week. Their portions are really big that it is fit for 2 people!  Whenever I go, I always order the fried cheese, avocado toast, and their chipotle pasta! I would rate them 5/5! However, the last time we went, not only did our waiter forget about our order for a half hour, we ordered their new dish called ""Korean style cauliflower"" and it came really cold and soggy. It is only good if it is hot and crispy.    Always go during their happy hour on weekdays. Appetisers for about $5-$7! Amazing portion for such a great price!"
Boobie B.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,23,5,1.0,7/27/2017,"Food was great! However, the table dirty floor dirty and the utensils sticky. Ladies room no toilet paper had to chase down a server who said she would be right back!  Waiting five minutes I walk out head to concierge to ask for managernot available but the helpful young lady   followed me to the ladies room and replenished and swept the floor, thank you. This was my first dining experience there celebrating my birthday hopefully they improve on sanitation    If you cant keep the bathroom clean for customers and employees then i do not want to eat at your establishment! Boo"
