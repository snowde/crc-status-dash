Tommy H.,"Secaucus, NJ",84,20,1,2.0,6/5/2016,"First time here since they open inside the mall. We came here to celebrate a friend birthday. Let me start of by saying that so far the service was decent. Now to talk about the food I order steak Diane and chicken madeira the combination plate, as I was eating I realize that the chicken was not cook. I told the waiter that my dish is undercook, he stated ""I will have my manager come and talk to you"". So They took my plate and made me a new one. When my food came everything was fine, I been waiting for the manager for more then 30 mins now. Please note that the store wasn't even busy. With that being said, if it was my restaurant and I made a dish that was undercook. I would have a manager bring out the new plate in a heartbeat. It's now been 40 mins and still no manager this is poor customer service. I will not come back to this place. I recommend not eating here."
Nikki G.,"Jersey City, NJ",42,20,11,1.0,7/16/2017,This place deserves no stars after my experience last night. I went out with my fiancé and best friend for dinner my best friend suggested this location since it was closer to home. I had order the chicken madeira as I do at all Cheesecake Factory's I go to. I received my food after waiting 20 mins later I was so hungry as I cut into my food I find my chicken to be semi pink I showed my friend and she just thought it was just me until I cut into the edge then she noticed my chicken was raw we called a waiter over which he was willing to get the manager I hate !!! Returning food I never do but my chicken was raw and I refuse ! To get sick. The manager ran out and was very kind he had asked me if I wanted a Cheesecake ... I responded no thank you I just want my chicken madeira I was very hungry... 15 mins goes by ( thinking their remaking my meal) are waitress came back to us with the check telling me they removed the meal from are bill. My friend asked if they were bringing me a new one remind you I've been here for about a hour my fiancé and friend had ate while I still haven't had anything. She tells us she didn't know she would check I told her if it wasn't made I didn't want it anymore. Well it was never made I was literally offered Cheesecake over a meal that I waited over a hour for. I will NOT be going back to this location. Just a heads up check your food before and if your offered Cheesecake take it ! Because your meal isn't being remade while you wait.
Maegan L.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,3,1,3.0,6/18/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, especially their herb crusted salmon. However the hostess with the reddish brown hair with the nose piercing was rude, she saw me coming and just left"
Jo O.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,,2.0,2/13/2017,"I go to this location very often. The first couple of times it was amazing! But recently, for some odd reason, the service has been terrible. Our entrees come before our appetizers & yesterday I was there with my sister and they brought my meal out first, and hers came out 20 mins after mine. our appetizers came out before our drinks, and to top it off, I ordered a filet mignon, medium rare and it's always either too cooked or undercooked."
Leena B.,"Jersey City, NJ",45,6,1,4.0,8/8/2016,It might be a 3 star for many but definitely a 4 star for me because I love the service and food here. The portion sizes are good and I love my salads and desserts. My friends have had greasy encounters with their food orders though and drinks not on point but never a problem with me. It's spot on if you are tired shopping in a mall on weekday and want to grab lunch dinner or snacks but weekends.. Dayum! U have to wait for more than an hour to get seated but then you have the rescue of mall !
John D.,"New York, NY",42,167,63,3.0,3/28/2016,Ordinary Cheesecake Factory; however the wait times can be very long due to little food choices in the immediate area. Some of the entrees are pretty good but I find the food here is very salty. It's like they pour half a bottle of salt on everything..it truly ruins the food in my opinion.
Kristy H.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,27,,2.0,12/13/2016,I enjoy Cheesecake Factory like everyone else and find myself craving from time to time as I live in the area BUT you must come to this Cheesecake Factory with a lot of patience as the service if ur lucky is just ok but usually is awful!
Andrew C.,"Jersey City, NJ",82,83,15,4.0,5/29/2016,Love this place. love the atmosphere and the food is amazing. Place is very clean and the desserts are out of this world. The waitress was very knowledgeable. I had the tacos which for amazing. Finding parking is hard but if you're already in the mall you have full access to them.
Ivan S.,"New York, NY",0,24,2,1.0,6/23/2016,"Although I like Cheesecake Factory, this location is 1 star for their service, host and the manager. Had a group of people for lunch, we were told we would be sited in 30 minutes - end up waiting an hour. Asked to talk to a manager, manager never showed up."
Juan Pablo M.,"Jersey City, NJ",33,2,,1.0,3/5/2016,"Not the first time at the restaurant but this one in particular has to have major problems if every time that you come the wait time is more than an hour regardless of the time that you come, either their not well staffed or they didn't planned properly for the demand.... Won't try again to come here."
Sharif R.,"Riverwoods, IL",26,25,10,1.0,5/17/2016,Not happy this location sucks I waited 20 minutes for cheesecake my bread came out the same time as my entree when I called the manager he brought the cheesecakes right away but I shouldn't have had to do that. The employees are overworked and are given too many tables. This is the closest cheesecake to me but won't be coming back
Osvaldo R.,"Jersey City, NJ",31,7,,2.0,7/7/2016,"This isn't like the other cheese cake factory I've visited, and I don't mean this in a good way. The service was slow, played it safe and just ordered a burger, which wasn't bad. The family member that was with me was still eating and they took his plate. Next time I will take my chances and eat upstairs in the food court."
John C.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,7,2,1.0,6/26/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this location seriously needs some help.  I've never seen the same staff here more than once. The last time I was here my salad had moldy blueberries and tasted like dirt. Plus, there are suspiciously way too many flies floating around.  Avoid."
Pradip P.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,7,1,4.0,11/24/2016,As everyone says long waiting time but I would say it's worth the wait. Good place to go with the kids too and loads of vegetarian options.
Anjana M.,"Jersey City, NJ",46,40,,2.0,3/8/2016,Had been there yesterday.. Even though I liked the ambiance of the place food  wasn't so appealing... Order Buffalo wings which tasted average have had better ones...n a Salmon appetizer which I felt had a. Little raw taste...main course followed the chipotle sauce paste which was assured to be spicy bt  ended up being sweet and disappointing.... The main course Salmon dish with rice was reasonably good and then orderer the truffle pastry which was again a decent option....bt having gone for a birthday treat was not really satisfied :( :(
Dayna O.,"Weehawken, NJ",71,34,,5.0,2/22/2016,Best idea EVER to place the most delicious restaurant at this location. I have yet to go but it always seems packed and full of cheesecake. I'll be sure to stop by in the next month or so.
Bumble B.,"New York, NY",19,233,33,1.0,2/6/2016,"I was so excited when this new location opened. My husband and I PLANNED on having a late lunch/early dinner here today. When we arrived, it was packed which we were expecting. We had to wait 30mins. to be seated. We placed our orders right away. Me: A glass of Sprite, Fried Mac n' cheese and nachos with chicken. Hubby: A glass of water and a Mac n' cheese burger with fries. After about 10 mins. of waiting, our waitress returned and informed us that they ran out of Mac n' cheese. Huh?!  She suggested that we look at the menu again to order something else but we decided to leave and eat somewhere else after she charged us for two sodas and we only had one. For a restaurant this busy, you would think that they would be prepared with enough food to accommodate everyone. We won't be back!!"
Young A.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,29,5,1.0,4/23/2016,The worst phone service I've seen. Tried to make a reservation - left on hold for over 10 minutes. Finally hung up and called back. Suddenly I'm told they don't take reservations at this time and nobody remembers anything about anyone being left on hold. Ridiculous.
Jason V.,"Chicago, IL",3,45,3,1.0,12/11/2015,"This place is mess, disorganized, and completely dysfunctional!!  We ordered literally 2 slices of cheesecake and its taking over 10mins waiting!!!!!this is completely unacceptable!  Better yet 8 dollars for one slice of cheesecake are you freaking kidding me?   I am NOT coming here again to pick up just one slice of freaken cheesecake!!  This place is a mess!!"
Dan G.,"Clifton, NJ",1,6,,5.0,12/9/2015,I worked at cheesecake factory for several years in college. I can say first hand from seeing the behind the scenes at several restaurants that the cheesecake factory is top quality. The restaurant has very high standards for the quality of their food and service. The food is all prepared fresh daily along with fresh fish. The sauces are prepared to order. The dressings are made from scratch. It is all delicious. My favorite thing is the variety. There are over 250 items on the menu including skinilicious items and vegatarian items. Do not be turned off by the wait- there is a reason for it. The food is great and they try their best to not send food to the table that is not up to their standards. I've personally seen a manager try a sauce for a dish and make the kitchen remake the whole thing. The manager chose to make the guest wait for a quality product and even bought them dessert after explaining why they were making them wait. Just a note... don't order brown bread or pumpernickel...it's whole wheat!
