EZamani P.,"Jersey City, United States",146,103,106,5.0,19/12/2015,"Great new addition to jersey city.  Welcome Cheesecake Factory.  I love the  .  What a great location to have this restaurant. Just opened a couple of weeks ago, no reservations yet. Staffs are friendly and the food is fresh."
Joy Y.,"New York, United States",215,734,1115,4.0,6/9/2017,"My friend recently moved to an apt building 5 minutes away from here and I will never miss out on an adventure to check out the Cheesecake Factory. We came here for lunch, and when dinner time came, despite not being hungry, we scrolled through Seamless for half an hour until we decided to order from the CF twice in one day. The food from this chain is alway decent but never exceeds expectations other than with its sheer portion size. The inaptly named   should just be the regular menu. Even the Superfoods section consists of dishes well over 1k calories. Flavorwise, both the vegan cobb and the salmon salad are tasty, and so is the free bread. My bf's buffalo cauliflower also smelled amazing. Service is generally slow for both dine-in and take-out."
Sandra M.,"Jersey City, United States",49,461,329,5.0,1/12/2017,"I'm not one to usually give five stars to a chain... But so far I really like the food here. The Cheesecake Factory and general was where I first discovered a love for sliders. I love the table bread here and recently tried the Truffle bacon grilled cheese appetizer. It was sinfully good. My girlfriend and I shared a filet mignon medium and they let us substitute the mashed potatoes and beans for asparagus and grilled broccoli. The asparagus came at a small of charge though, but that was okay. We actually then order dessert and got Godiva brownie sundae- it was really good. I typically order from the  , but was craving a protein other than chicken. The Fiji Waters were a bit expensive at about $ 4 a bottle. Also, we were sitting at the bar area with the stroller and the management was nice enough to lower the music a bit as it got very loud early on into our lunch."
Cheryl S.,"Dumont, United States",53,101,22,2.0,16/10/2017,Typical Cheesecake Factory. Food was decent. I had the Mexican Tortilla Salad off the   and it was huge. Very filling. Also had the lemon merengue cheesecake which was good. Would have given more stars if the service wasn't terrible.
