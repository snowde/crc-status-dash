Amee G.,"Bayonne, NJ",5,21,8,5.0,3/6/2017,"The food is always amazing and of course the cheesecake is to die for! I have always enjoyed eating at Cheesecake Factory, so when one opened up a few miles from my house I was super excited. I have been to this location several times and mostly I solo dine at the bar. This review can be credited to Ally who is bartending this Monday afternoon. She is super friendly and efficient. I was never offered bread at the bar prior to today's experience. I usually order 1 or 2 small plates for myself. She always made sure my glass of water was full! I am super critical of dining out because I work in the restaurant industry. Thank you Ally!"
Andrew L.,"New York, NY",0,57,124,4.0,11/11/2016,"Went on a Friday evening and the restaurant was busy but the crowd and the wait was manageable. We had high expectations for the desserts but did not know what to expect with the rest of the food. It turned out that both entrees that we had, the Chicken Bellagio and the Miso Salmon, we're excellent. Ironically it was the cheesecakes (Salted Caramel and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream) that didn't overwhelm us - they were okay. Would definitely go back for the entrees that we had but would try something else for dessert.  Our server Tamara was also extremely friendly and helpful though she was stretched thin at times."
Jack L.,"Malvern, PA",0,1,1,2.0,12/27/2015,"I came with my girlfriend on a Sunday night. Waited an hour to be seated, took them another hour for my entrees to be served. Terrible terrible experience. Not recommended.  Plus, my shrimp with angel hair is way too much to the point of disgusting."
Serena N.,"Jersey City, NJ",115,528,7140,2.0,8/20/2016,"We just visited this location and I have to say it was the most disappointing experience at Cheesecake Factory I have ever had. The air is very stale in this restaurant and whomever designed the HVAC did a poor job.  The restaurant also has a mildew like smell. To start, there were a lot of empty tables but the wait was still 15 minutes. We were seated and given menu's. We ordered a passion fruit margarita (served in a martini glass) which was extremely too sweet, again it taste like chemicals and not freshly made. Our server brought us water but for some reason put no ice in it so it was luke warm.  We didn't get any bread, and like the table next to us we had to ask our server for it. For the appetizer we got the zucchini, mushroom and avocado batter dipped ($6.95). There were 2 pieces of avocado and the rest was all soggy mushroom and zucchini pieces. Not good at all. They also threw Parmesan on top of it which made the sogginess worse. For the entree I ordered the Luau Salad which did not taste fresh at all. The salad was wilted and soggy. They also put way too much dressing in the salad. The crisp part was drowning in dressing, which had a chemical taste. Nothing tastes fresh. We decided to try the strawberry cheesecake (since it my husband's first time to Cheesecake Factory) and the strawberries ARE NOT fresh (like the menu states) but drowning in a strawberry concentrate and is extremely sugary and taste like corn syrup. Very disappointing experience. The food sucks as well as the ambiance. Complete waste of $70 (we also were not given an itemized receipt when we asked for the check, and were unable to locate our server to get one)."
Will G.,"North Bergen, NJ",2,4,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Lunch portions for the price r too high.had pasta dish, meats were over cooked and even burnt."
Howard P.,"New York, NY",108,44,833,4.0,1/25/2016,"So I'm going to give this place a 4-star mostly because the nachos were awesome (perhaps somewhat surprisingly to me... Could've been low expectations sure. But they were tasty!).  After being trapped inside due to snowmageddon, my lady and I came to the mall to relieve some cabin fever. Mostly an empty mall. But Cheesecake Factory was open and we got thirsty. The bar is first come first serve and no seats. Despite seeing many a table open the hostess advised is was a 30 minute wait. We decided to put our name in and grab a drink. Luckily we were able to sit and just order from the bar so we never had to wait.  Drinks (margarita and some Mai tai's) were pretty good. As I said the nachos were delicious.  Service was slow. But could be because they were not expecting much with the storm? I don't know....  They had a tv to see the game if you wanted.  I guess it's a Cheesecake Factory and when you are at the mall it suffices. But get the nachos. And another tip: out your name Down and go shopping. They willing give you a beeper (antiquated technology but still does the job)"
Lissa P.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,6,,2.0,2/26/2017,"We were told we would have a 20 minute wait, which was fine since one usually expects a wait on a weekend afternoon. Once we were seated, the people in the booth behind us were in an argument with their server, who was yelling back at them - so the server was replaced with another who now seemed to have to cover a bigger area. There were 5 of us...we put in our drink order - sodas and lemonades and while the sodas arrived quickly, we waited another 5 minutes for the lemonades. The food seemed to be slow coming out, the appetizers about 30 minutes after we ordered, one which was the wrong item and corrected quickly and the entrees, another 30 minutes later, with 2 of the 5 delayed another few minutes. All in all, we spent over 2 hours when it should have only been 1. While the server was pleasant, I feel that the pace needs to be picked up a bit. I won't say that I will never visit another CF, but I doubt that I will revisit the Jersey City location."
Mondriahn M.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",112,4,,3.0,5/28/2017,I visited this restaurant today and initially ordered from the brunch menu. I will never do that again. Their brunch is equivalent to Denny's or Ihop - not worth it. I ended up swapping my meal with chicken tacos which was pretty good. Our waiter Omar was really nice and apologetic about my bad experience but he wasn't the problem. The chefs need to revamp the brunch menu ASAP and change the syrup. It was GROSS!
Royal V.,"Bronx, NY",10,112,196,4.0,4/3/2016,"I had no idea this place was open until i saw it on the malls website. We came out on a saturday late afternoon and had only a 10 min wait for a party of 5 after being told 30 mins.... Not bad!  Our waitress was efficient and personable and all of our food came out as ordered, hot, and on time. Waitress was very good on our refills both on drinks and bread :) Food as usual was good and cheesecakes yummy. Wish they would bring back the pineapple upside down cheesecake. Lol."
Mark A.,"Jersey City, NJ",235,252,867,5.0,12/8/2015,"Came for the grand opening today in my city(jersey city), had a wait of 20 min but I didn't mind...I noticed it was where pay half used to be...they gave me a sort of pager that would vibrate when I had a table, when it did I got the booth I asked for which was awesome, I was walked to my table by a beautiful hostess...I already kind of knew what I was going to eat so I ordered it which was the chicken costelleta which came with asparagus and a hefty portion of bacon mash potatoes...to start off I received the two breads, I'm going to keep it one thousand it was garbage! BASURA! ...really didn't like it...but the good part is my main meal was awesome, would recommend it to anyone who does not know what to get off the menu!"
Alisa Olivia L.,"Queens, NY",198,111,57,2.0,12/30/2015,Everyone always talks about the Cheesecake Factory as if it is this great place so as soon as I seen it was now in Jersey City I made an effort to go. I had such high expectations for this place but sadly I was very disappointed.  Service: The wait time was an hour but since the restaurant was new it was understandable. But the wait time also made me expect more...and honestly it was not worth the wait. The waiter was nice and friendly but when I asked her if she could recommend something she said everything was good and they had lots of specialties....umm wrong answer ...sigh. The menu was so long I really wanted a recommendation.  Food: The Fried Macaroni appetizer was incredible. For my entree I ordered the chicken Marsala. When it arrived I noticed my pasta was extremely over cooked. I tried to eat it anyway but I just couldn't it tasted horrible so the waitress took it back and nicely removed it from the bill.  I doubt I will return here and am disappointed in my first cheesecake factory experience.
Danny E.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,10,,1.0,3/18/2017,"This managed to fall short of my already wildly low expectations.  Service with a scowl and brutally obvious disdain for my group from the outset.  Not sure what it was about 4 normal people that infuriated the server so much.  I can get terrible food anywhere, and don't plan to return for a second helping at the restaurant that won  'Most Joyless Place on Earth, 2017'."
Tian T.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,6,,3.0,5/24/2017,It's not a bad American traditional food. Convenient for people who are around Newport and the shopping mall.
Meesch B.,"Jersey City, NJ",73,83,110,2.0,2/4/2017,"About every 3 years or so I go to a Cheesecake Factory (somewhere in the US) and ehhhh...It's never good...barely edible. I order my usual,  the Sautéed Shrimp (sub with chicken) with a Very Spicy Jamaican Black Pepper Sauce. Served with Rice, Black Beans, Plantains and Mango Salsa. The rice was cold and hard, the beans were BLAH, the mango taste spoiled, the chicken was barely done (has a slimly feel) BUT the plantains were delicious. My meal was so unsatisfying I wanted to just bolt out of there...no cheese cake. It's insulting that food this expensive could be so bad. It's not worth the money or the calories.  Got a gift card from co-workers...I will be RE-gifting. I have no desire to return."
Cynthia M.,"Jersey City, NJ",232,54,369,5.0,3/14/2016,Not bad for a Cheesecake Factory in Newport Mall. Food was delicious as always. Bottle service was great with a proper presentation. Food Service was great on time & ofcourse dessert was delicious!
Patricia C.,"Stockholm, Sweden",2,34,1,3.0,7/11/2016,"I was really hungry for cheesecake this one day so i walked in and they were like hey. you can sit down at a table. it was really big for a cheesecake cafe. then they came out with what looked like Harry potter and the gobbo of fire, (you know.. the book) but when I opened it up.. it was... Chinese food, Mexican food, Pizza, Italian food, Hamburgers, Seafood, Southern food, sandwiches, Sushi, spagget. It was all the foods in the world! Super big menu! I forgot why i even was there in the first place there and i ended up getting a hamburger, but it took me an hour to order because i am not a fast reader so it took a while to get through the menu. I think its a good place if you have picky eaters because they have absolutely every food you could think of, they have very nice food presentation, and it kicks any TGIF type place in the butthole because its actually really good for this kinda style of restaurant. oh yeah I almost forgot. i got a hambuger with fried macaroni and cheese ball on it! It was kinda fun!"
David D.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,20,25,3.0,5/16/2016,"Clean **** Food *** Service **** Over all was ok, salty but great flavor  Just don't let them sit you all the way in the corner on a Monday when the place is empty that was rude! I say NO WAY!! Anyway I refused and I sit where I want it period!!! Had a great time with my wife"
Marielis M.,"Jersey City, NJ",55,16,7,4.0,4/4/2016,"We had no wait time since we came in on a Monday night around 9pm. We were greeted by the hostess and sat down right away. Our server James was awesome. He was very attentive and helpful.  We ordered the smokehouse burger with sweet potato fries and I had the bow tie chicken pasta with a garlic sauce (I forgot what it's called). My bf said his burger was pretty good but wished he got more fries since all you get is about a cup full. My pasta was pretty good. It had really good flavors and  I really liked the tomatoes in it. My only thing is it had kind of a burnt aftertaste. Not sure if it was supposed to taste like that or it was the pancetta. Regardless I ate it and it was still good. Probably won't order that again though. James was great with keeping our cups full and answering any questions we had. CHEESECAKE TIME!  We ordered two kinds, the red velvet cake and the white chocolate macadamia caramel cheesecake. My boyfriend liked them both. I was pretty meh about the red velvet but the caramel macadamia was soooooo good. Definetly a must try.   Didn't spend a fortune and we enjoyed a nice night out. Would be back again soon."
Cassandra H.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,107,31,5.0,7/2/2016,"Many tasty options with something for everyone. My girlfriend and I celebrated with my cousin here post graduation  we had the house salad, fried cheese, dynamite shrimp, the bacon bacon burger, the fish tacos, the meal with basil noodles and chicken, strawberry cheesecake and Oreo dream. All was absolutely delicious and fresh. Try everything! The service was spot on too!"
Gamalier R.,"Jersey City, NJ",75,2,1,2.0,4/21/2017,"The management staff are young, this place need to change the unorganized management staff."
