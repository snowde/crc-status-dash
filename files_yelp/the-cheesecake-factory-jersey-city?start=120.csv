Danielle G.,"Jersey City, NJ",11,106,79,4.0,7/31/2016,"First time trying the new Cheesecake Factory in JC. Great service and clean establishment. Serving are huge as they are known for. Food was well cooked and seasoned. Our waiter was great gave us the history of the restaurant, was nice to learn. I will definitely recommend this location and we will be back again. There was plenty for a hungry picky teenager to choose from, he was very satisfied. And my to go strawberry cheesecake was delicious."
Nevik N.,"Palm Harbor, FL",7,51,39,1.0,1/5/2017,"I frequent many Cheesecake Factory all around but I've never had service as bad as this one.  The food wasn't too bad, a little colder than the usual but nothing worth complaining about. Now let's get to the service. I arrived and the hostess was on her phone, no big deal since she turns around and seats me right away.  Next I get seated with my party of four, and we look at the menu for about 5 minutes and are ready to order. 5 minutes past nobody even came to take our drinks. Another 10 minutes went by and still no one to even ask for drinks. Raise my hand up to call for a server but another 10 minutes nobody.  With probably 10 servers running back and forth, after 30 minutes my server walks up casually and has the audacity to ask if we had the chance to decide what we want to drink!!! After ordering and getting out drinks I'm seeing others that ordered after us started getting their food already. It was 24 more minutes before we all got our food. My family literally spent almost 2 hours waiting!!!"
Rocco S.,"Newport News, VA",15,38,1,4.0,9/4/2016,Great food and service as usual! Erica the waitress was the best! Took good care of us. Its always good to see customer service is still alive and well.
Anggie T.,"Jersey City, NJ",27,9,2,2.0,4/9/2017,"I've been to this location twice and so far every time the wait for the food is horrendous! The first time I understood it was kind of busy but yesterday my family & I went when they first opened for brunch & we had to wait atleast 45 mins for our orders and there weren't so many people, I had the fettuccini alfredo with extra shrimp the texture of the shrimp was nasty and it didn't even look like they put any extra shrimp in my fettuccini. The cheesecake was great that's why I have 2 stars but the entrees are mediocre and could be so much better!"
William D.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,2,5.0,1/17/2016,"Wow! I thought the food would be under rated, but to my surprise the food was better than I thought. It was stated it would be a 45 min wait, so I decided to shop at JCPennys. To my surprise upon arrival I decided to check at the front desk to see, if I was called and I sure was. I never should have left. Yet I had the best seat in the joint, corner table. I hope I can get that table all the time I will request it, near the waiters station. Our Customer Service Host Adan M, was the best 10 stars, Adan proceeded to ask if this was our first time and I stated yes, and he explained the menu in a way that most other restaurants will not do and take out the time to explain. I would recommend you to sit in his section near the bar. Once again I under estimated this place. Never again!"
Catherine W.,"Jersey City, NJ",21,10,1,3.0,6/17/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's reliable and you know what to expect.  I came here with my husband and two week old baby as we were walking past and there was ten minutes left of happy hour. Two drinks later and we were happy. The entire bar area is happy hour from 4-6pm so we ordered a beer and a cocktail which were both great. We also ordered a factory nachos which was $5.95 alongside many other happy hour apps. The plate that arrived was humongous! Seriously crazy sized - we didn't even finish it. Best value for $6 ever.  So all in all, a great pit stop when we needed a seat and a chill out. It's not fine dining, and it's not crappy. It is what it is. Just don't take me there on an anniversary or special occasion!"
Affluent O.,"Jersey City, NJ",307,31,4,3.0,12/11/2016,"I like to try all kinds of different establishments, I went to The Cheesecake Factory in Florida one year and it was amazing. When I saw one open at the Newport Mall I was so open to try it, got there and totally forgot about the waiting lines. Wow its like a club with groups of people waiting with their buzzers to get in. Hilarious but was lucky to only wait 15 min. So I originally went to get dessert but when they hit you with the big menu I couldnt say no. Surprisingly the food was ok but got so stuffed that my dessert came short lol. Cool spot and def the local date spot on the weekends for some but other than the long wait not bad. Next time ordering dessert first."
T P.,"Newark, NJ",14,56,131,3.0,7/16/2016,"Nice addition to the Newport mall. When you want to grab a drink , especially during happy hour. It's nice just like any other Cheesecake Factory . I'm not sure if they just opened , but they need better bartenders . They are not attentive to was going on at all. They drinks sucked . None of them know how to make anything they kept getting books out to read recipes . At one point I was shocked , because I was sitting there , and was not even offered a full menu , or asked if I wanted another drink. I had to wave the 4 bartenders that were back there down for another drink . I think this can be a great environment, but the bartenders seem like they all just graduated bartender school."
Anna T.,"New York, NY",203,155,177,4.0,1/4/2017,"Although the Cheesecake Factory is just another American chain restaurant I believe it deserves a 4 star just because I do think that it is the upper echelon of American chain restaurants.               First off, this is the first place I got to try the pumpernickel bread. I immediately fell in love.  The portion of the entrees is overwhelming and although you'll be packing on the calories, you get your monies worth and a doggy bag to go. The menu is extremely extensive with so many options from Asian cuisine to Italian to Mexican. I almost always get the spicy chipotle chicken sandwich with a side of fries which never ever disappoints. The shrimp scampi is pretty good as well. I recently had the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus and it was so good. Finish off the meal with one of their amazing cheesecake and you'll be a satisfied customer. Don't forget to get the strawberry lemonade too.       There's usually a little wait every time I come here but the high tops and bars are a little more accessible. Our servers have always been efficient and nice. I enjoy this place when I'm in the mood to feel gluttonous."
Marlon M.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,16,7,5.0,7/13/2016,"Emily was a rock star. She hooked us up with the best service one could ever ask for. She smiled, explained the menu thoroughly and guided my girlfriend and I to exactly what our taste buds where looking for. It was my first experience and will not be my last. I choose to go with the Chicken Madeira and Fried Mac while my girlfriend elected to go with the Chicken Chipotle Pasta. For drinks, I had a Whiskey Smash and she had a Passion Fruit Margarita. I love this place. We'll be back with more people next time. Everyone deserves to have at least eaten from this establishment once. It's a sin no to."
Mohammad S.,"Washington, DC",2,9,,2.0,1/15/2017,"I really Thank the waitress Ashly she was great and wonderful and deserve a 5 star! The reason why I gave 2 stars for this Cheesecake Factory branch is that when me and my family woke up . Me and my mother where vomiting and we are having upset stomach now.  Since we where 5 in total eat and all the other 3 where fine. The only food me and my mother had in common that the rest didn't have was that small ""mayo-like /egg-like thing"" they put in a small plastic coin dollar size plastic. !! I have eat many times in cheese cake factory but this is my worst ""food experience"". Do not mix with waitress as she was keen and full of energy . I feel so terrible right now !!!"
Greg C.,"South Orange, NJ",466,332,624,3.0,4/11/2016,"Food, 5 Stars Value, 5 Stars Ambiance, 4 Stars Service, 2 Stars I think the reputation of Cheesecake Factory is well established.  The food is consistently good, and the portions are big for the price.  We were very happy when this store opened in our neighborhood.  We finally had a chance to try it out for an early dinner on Saturday, with 7 family members. The service was so slow and inattentive it was a bit annoying, and I'm generally a fairly patient person.  The restaurant was pretty crowded, but they seemed to have enough staff to handle the tables, and then some, as there seemed to be servers and runners milling about all over the place.  It took about 15 minutes before our server came to take our drink order, and then another 15 before he brought the drinks and took our food order.  He forgot one of our appetizers.  Also, the food came out at different times, which should never happen at a restaurant.  When we did need something, our server often came to take orders from neighboring tables without ever looking our way.  I have worked as a server and bartender, so I know, you never come onto the floor without giving a quick glance to all of your tables to see if someone is trying to flag you down.  It is really frustrating when you are waving your arms and the server never even looks your way.  Why do I have to yell across the restaurant?  Clearly they were not that interested in seating the growing crowd of people in their lobby, because I even had to get up and go hand him my credit card personally, because I wasn't sure if he was ever going to come pick it up. The food was all very good (except the appetizer we never got...at least he remembered to take it off the check).  Hopefully this was an isolated incident and they will get their act together, because we do enjoy their food."
Carol S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,20,,2.0,7/14/2017,"Went to Cheesecake factory this evening at Newport Mall,JC,NJ.  Though the atmosphere and the waitress are nice the food was not impressive I guess a different cook perhaps.  First of all the 3 of us ordered the Catfish dinner but to only be told they were out of it.  Shrimp scampi watery.  Chose herb crusted salmon was more like blackened salmon. I ate mine, a small bottle of ginger ale is 6 bucks whereas I could have bought a big bottle for $1.99.  Don't know if I would try  this place again.  Oh the manager did give us free buffalo wings after the Catfish episode."
John F.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",25,14,35,1.0,1/8/2017,The slowest most uncoordinated restaurant ever. Don't waste your time because the staff at this cheese cake factory certainly pales in comparison to the location in NY.
Pratik B.,"Jersey City, NJ",54,6,,4.0,2/16/2017,Though the cocktails weren't that great!Food and presentation was amazing.And the cheesecake is delicious.Beware of the wait time(@60minutes) during rush time.
Cindy C.,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",66,7,5,2.0,7/11/2016,"I came here for my anniversary with my husband. I ordered a Shrimp Scampi and Steak Diane $21.99. It only has 4 pieces of cut up steak and 3 shrimps with a scoop of mashed potato in the middle. I was still hungry afterward. The waitress, Cindy was nice tho. She tries her best to see what she can do to address the issue. Too bad she can't do much about it since her manager refused to. The 2 stars are for the waitress, Cindy. Other than that this place sucks!"
AL B.,"West New York, NJ",0,10,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Started coming here when first opened, came here today with Family and it was terrible. Food + 10 Service - 100  We were seated as soon as we walked and about 15 minutes went by and a server came up and asked if we were being taken of. I answered no and since we waited so long we were ready to order the whole dinner appetizers/dinner and even desert. When the appetizers came, one of them was not what was ordered so that was taken back and right one was bought to us shortly. We had to ask for bread 3 times from three different servers and finally the bread arrived. Now it was time for dinner and 3 out of the 4 dinners ordered arrived so we all waited to eat and about 20 minutes later we had to ask the server where the dinner was, she went back to check and came back later on and bought the much awaited dinner which by this time all the rest of our food was cold. The server stated that the manager would be coming to our table shortly. The manager arrived and stated he was sorry that the order was delayed !!!!!!! That was all he said !!!!!! WTF Dinner taste was very good and now it was time for coffee and desert. Coffee came out and had to ask the server for sugar and that was also a project. OMG :-( get me out of here. Not looking for Freebie, hopefully the management staff would see this write up and use it as a training tool so that the Cheesecake Factory of Jersey City maintains the great standard of food and exceptional service as in all of the other Cheesecake restaurants."
Vartika S.,"Manhattan, NY",37,36,13,1.0,10/3/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this location is the most disappointing one ever. It's close to my Apt so I've been here more than 5-6 times and each time the service has been bad. I didn't get their usual bread first two times so I started asking for it and to my disbelief I didn't get it on any of my visits !! Once I even asked my server where was my bread and he kept saying it's coming ! The servers are very inattentive, they'll takes ages to get to you after they've taken your order. No water refills, we had to chase our server for the check ! Seriously disappointed! I hope the management fixes the situation at this location ! I love their food and would have loved it if my experience here was better !!!!"
Ali C.,"Jersey City, NJ",69,35,15,2.0,4/21/2016,"Came here for the first time on a Thursday night, the restaurant was busy but not packed. Our server was nice and friendly, but we waited 30 minutes for our entrees and the ""Garlic Noodles with Chicken"" came out to be very bland. I had to add lots of salt to make it somewhat more flavorful. The noodles were not garlicky at all! The Chicken and Biscuits came out okay but the biscuits were dry and hard. Very disappointed about the quality of food. Even though service was decent, but I would not come back. The food court in the mall would be better choices."
Christine B.,"Washington, DC",3,5,6,1.0,11/16/2016,"Hostess did not have good customer service. Stood there for 5mins and seemed to ignore me until I greeted her and asked for a table. Offered the bar top, which my dad could not sit at due to disability. I kindly requested for a table to sit at just for dessert. Told me wait was 15mins because they did not have any servers?! We ordered cheesecake to go and as we were leaving, saw her seat another group of three at a booth. But no one else there really had great customer service except the employee at the to-go dessert bar. Since I had been living in the west and south, it's Hard for me to accept that my home town is not as friendly as I remembered. Makes me worry for my mom and dad who are not so outspoken that they me would be taken advantage of or so easily ignored."
