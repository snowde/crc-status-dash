Katrinka B.,"Livingston, NJ",0,11,,4.0,1/28/2017,"Emanuel at the cashier desk was awesome--super friendly and very helpful, went out of his way to accommodate. Five stars for service based on him.  Food seems to have gone down in quality over the years. Salads used to be chock full of stuff--Santa Fe had a lot of corn and beans, chopped tomatoes. Now it's got a couple wedges of tomatoes, and it's pretty chintzy on the corn, beans, and chicken. A pity. Three stars for that."
Shirl P.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,6,,1.0,1/2/2017,"Slow, lots of servers running around. I realize it's busy, but it's been open for too long since the start to have this type of service.  Appetizers and entrees out at the same time?  An hour for others at the table to get food.  This place needs a serious management overhaul.  We're here for the cheesecake, but this may be the last time we give it a chance."
Alicja A.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,6,4,1.0,1/2/2017,"Unfortunately, the standard at this restaurant was very poor. Where do I start? Having entered the restaurant, we had to wait for 25 minutes to be greeted and seated, finally the buzzer vibrated and the waitress took us to our table, which had crumbs all over the table and benches, not only that when we sat down our feet were sticking to the floor underneath the table that's how dirty it was, therefore my silverware was very disgusting and had food on it ( When I asked our waiter to bring me some clean silverware he apologized about it being dirty and said he would bring me some but...... I had to ask him twice because he kept on forgetting).....We ordered our drinks, and soon enough we ordered our appetizer which was the Thai Lettuce Wraps, they were delicious! We ordered our mains and they were very good as well. I strongly suggest for this Cheese Cake Factory to be cleaned more and more organized. I will never go there again !!! It was terrible !!!Don't be fooled, this place is very dirty, and the service was very poor. The upstairs food court would of been a way better choice!  P.S. I was really looking forward to having the tiramisu cheese cake, because that's what I always have.........BUT it was not good at this location, it tasted old and not worth buying."
Stan R.,"San Diego, CA",3,83,,3.0,5/4/2017,"The food was usual Cheesecake Factory fare, which is always too much food and rich in caloric content. However, the service here was just atrocious! It took forever to get waited on, forever to get our drinks, and forever to get our dinner. The cheesecake was very good--decadent Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake, but we found much better versions of this wonderful desert at Juniors in NYC in the theater district and Eilleen's Cheesecake."
Victoria C.,"New York, NY",330,90,173,4.0,3/30/2016,"Food: B The food here was awesome mostly. We started with the Fried Calamari, and it came with both a garlic aioli and cocktail sauce - super tasty - and I noticed that the squid was very tender. Every time I order fried calamari, it's usually quite tough - it was ~delish~ here. The aioli, I think, consisted mainly of mayo - not complaining about, since it was SO good - but I wish it had been lighter so I didn't immediately feel my arteries clog up after taking one bite. Would have loved to eat more of it. The cocktail sauce was a more refreshing alternative. I actually really enjoy fried calamari with marinara sauce, though, so I wish that they had provided that as well. For our entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio and the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo. The chicken dish was a breaded chicken breast over angel hair pasta (with a light pesto?) topped with prosciutto and arugula. My boyfriend loved it, and it came in a large portion. He has a good appetite and didn't finish it. Can't say the same about my combo dish, which also came with (a small amount of) mashed potatoes. It wasn't a huge problem for me since I still barely finished it - I was so full from the bread, appetizer and also barely touched the side of fries that I ordered (so unlike me). The presentation of this dish wasn't impressive, since the portions were small and it was spaced out over such a large dish. But the shrimp scampi was cooked very well - the sauce was absolutely delicious. Gotta warn you though, if garlic isn't your thing, I wouldn't get the shrimp scampi. Luckily, I LOVE garlic. As for the salmon, meh - overcooked IMO. I like my salmon with the center still a bit tender/soft, but it was tough/crumbly. The ""herb crusted"" part apparently just meant that some herbs were thrown on top of it. It just didn't look (or taste) that appetizing. A bit disappointing. After dinner, we ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse cheesecake to share, which we've had before, and it was super rich and chocolatey. It was very heavy, so I would recommend ordering a tall glass of milk or something on the side. I could barely eat any since I was so full already, but I really wish I could have eaten more of it. Service: A The service here was great - our waitress was very friendly but not intrusive. She was patient when we needed some time to look at the menu, and she was also good with timing - how much time we needed to look at the menu, when to space out our bread, appetizer, and entrees, etc. Our wine was taking a bit due to a backup at the bar, so she was kind enough to give us a heads up so we weren't left wondering if it was forgotten. She checked up on us to see how our food was after giving us enough time to actually eat a bit (some waiters ask only a moment after setting the food down, and I'm like...I've barely touched my food yet...) Timing is a huge thing when it comes to waiting tables. Good timing makes the patrons feel comfortable, relaxed and able to enjoy their meal; poor timing gives customers an experience where they feel rushed, impatient, and/or uncomfortable or even frustrated. I distinctly noticed that she was very good at her job. Ambiance: B This Cheesecake Factory is a part of the Newport Mall. We were seated in the ""patio"" area, outside the restaurant but inside the halls of the mall. They made sure to ask to make sure it was okay to be seated here. Seems weird since people shopping at the mall walk past you, but it wasn't that bad. I actually thought that we had a bit more privacy here than we would have inside, where it was super busy. I was a little concerned that because we were kind of separate from the rest of the tables, we would be forgotten (it happens) and the waitress would busy herself with the customers in the main area, but it was totally fine - our waitress was very attentive :) *thumbs up* A heads up, the patio area has patio furniture (wrought iron tables and all weather wicker sofas to sit on which was comfortable). Not everyone's cup of tea - some people might like the ""fancier"" vibe inside, but this was totally fine for us, even better since it was quieter and we could have a conversation. Other (Sanitation): C When we were seated, we saw that the table had not been cleaned properly - grease marks all over. After I asked our waitress about it, she sent someone over to wipe it, and the guy apologized. Understandable since the metal that the table was made of made it hard to see whether it was a grease mark or drying water. But what was annoying after that, though, was that they later gave us spoons for our cheesecake (dessert after our meal) that were also not very clean. Both my boyfriend and I took a look at our respective spoons and dipped them into a water glass and wiped them down before we felt comfortable enough to use them... Not ideal, especially after already giving us a table that hadn't been cleaned properly *thumbs down* Overall, I had a great time here and would come back! :)"
M L.,"Bayside, NY",186,23,,2.0,11/20/2016,"Where do I start... Ok 1st I'm the a person that rarely has issues with food...I will even let slide somewhat mediocre food and or service...but I'm getting ahead...let's start with the server Sinead J at Newport Centre Mall CCF..1-didn't tell us the soup of the day..especially being that it's colder than normal due to a broken seal of a store being build next door inside the mall which all the outside draft is inside (she told us the story) 2-no fish special 3-hair in the bread 4-cold cappuccino 5-she disappeared until food was dropped off 6-she didn't take away all the plates piled in the front of the table 7-forgot the bacon on one the plates (SHE dropped off the food) 8-brought the bacon and guess what...it was cold 9-asked for hot milk to try to at least fix the cappuccino, she opted for an excuse 1st instead of an apology 10-home fries weren't special, could get better at a diner...it's sad cuz my girl really loves this place and wanted to bring me to give our Sunday a new experience...did I mention she's a DT at Cheesecake Factory at another location and felt bad making it known..."
Tripti B.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,7,,4.0,1/1/2017,"The variety of Cheesecakes available are enough to satiate everyone's taste buds. The food is delicious and in large quantities so we usually take the leftovers with us for the next meal as well (better than eating too much). The place is bit loud as it is always packed ( forget about going there on special days/ holidays). Since they do not take reservations wait times can be excrutiatingly long especially if you are really hungry. However, there is always a perfect option to make the Cheesecake to-go."
Diana H.,"Montclair, NJ",45,137,165,4.0,2/20/2016,"I've been to other CF before but it was my first time at the Newport location. Nice set up. No wait for their ""patio"" which is an area where they have tables set up in the mall. Server was great. We were dining with our baby and she made sure we had everything we needed. I ordered their skinnylicious lemon Garlic shrimp and it was delicious although very small (hence the skinny part). The cheesecake was amazing like always. I'd come back to this location."
Aida T.,"Jersey City, NJ",19,7,,5.0,10/5/2016,Love The View the interior of this restaurant it is so romantic but at the same time family oriented price pretty ok food good we'll go back they do have excellent cheesecake the people inside are beautiful very attentive to you and that is something I love in a restaurant they were even intended to my son who could be a little irritating calling them for every little thing my little bubba who is 8 years old
James K.,"Middletown, NJ",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2016,Very disappointed tonight could they be out of anything else and still be open for business!!!  A word of advice just list what your out of it should not take 30 minutes to find out what's available.  Just close if you can't provide services.  Bad management did not try to make things right.  Sorry just AWFUL!!!!!!!
Lorena S.,"Jersey City, NJ",43,30,41,3.0,1/31/2016,"Made it in with a girlfriend on a Friday night for drinks & apps. It was busy so we went straight to the bar & luckily someone one was leaving, so we had a zero wait time. The table was cleaned up right away & menus were put down.  Our waitress was friendly & took the time to review & give drink recommendations.  I had already read other yelp reviews, so went in the expectation of slow service, which I can't disagree with those reviews.  It was Friday night, busy, realize the place is still new & in no rush, so it didn't bother me. Apps & drinks came out in a timely matter once the order was put in, all was tasty & satisfying! The waitress did spend time at our table when she did come around & was very pleasant.   Overall it was a good experience! I'm sure I'll be back & hopefully the service will be speedier at that time."
Eric L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,154,,3.0,12/19/2016,"Wait time was 45 mins, but it was a Saturday evening, so expected.  It's hard to give it a 4 or 5 rating, it's really just a chain restaurant with dim lighting, and crowded seating.  They herd you in, they herd you out.  The food was very good though, I liked the Hibachi Steak, $20.50 was a little steep.  And the service was prompt and with a smile.  Still, if you're going to order overpriced food, you may as well take the Path across the river and get actual good chefs to make something great instead of typical stuff like Cheesecake sells.  No offense if you like the place tho!"
Shelly D.,"Staten Island, NY",0,11,8,1.0,11/6/2016,"Wish I could rate them a ZERO. I was there lastnight and the service was horrible. The staff was rude. We were seated at a dirty table with so much food on the floor. Then the host apologized then sat us right by the restroom. When asked to be seated somewhere else, she sat us with the most rudest waitress ever. Then we waited 40 mins for our food. The food was good. Our waitress never apologized, never smiled, never asked how was the food. She was very short in her dialogue. Therefore I didn't leave her a tip. Normally I would've left something, but this situation called for no tip."
Ayman B.,"Hoboken, NJ",33,45,38,5.0,1/28/2016,"Always like to go there. plates are gigantic and delicious. My favorite dish is shrimp jambalaya,  you should go and try"
Shikha A.,"Jersey City, NJ",28,2,4,1.0,12/28/2015,"I wish I had an option of half a star.I am a big fan of cheesecake factory and that was the first time when I went out with my friends to this new location, we waited for 45 minutes and at the end the expereince was awful! I ordered Rigatoni Pasta, it was raw, extremely Al-Dente(So hard to chew) and had no taste.. Talked to manager had him changed to Four Cheese pasta for To-Go! When I got back they had packed Chicken Pasta for me.. I have been vegetarian whole of my life. This was the most disgusting experience everrrr...Not going back to this location and maybe not any of their franchises."
Andre E.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,10,,5.0,9/28/2016,"Normally don't do these chain restaurants as the food is usually nasty and bland, went there on a Wednesday evening so the place was not that packed, Hostess was very pleasant, My wife got the fish tacos which the tacos were basic but everything else that filled it was great & tasted really fresh& I got some kind of Parmesan Chicken with pesto & Couscous, which was really great, a tad bit too much oil but was still great. We split a slice of pumpkin cheesecake, which was really really great & we were tempted to get another slice. Great food, great atmosphere, great service & price was not bad. Will definitely be going back. Not many of these types of chain restaurants in Jersey City & none as good as Cheesecake factory."
Gil R.,"Middlesex, NJ",29,10,2,1.0,5/13/2017,I've been to many Cheesecake Factory before. This one has the worst service by far. I've been here twice and both times I've had to wait over an hour for my food. This is after we are already seated. The staff is also very rude. Every time we asked for our food we were told to please be patient.
Hansika S.,"New York, NY",26,42,26,1.0,12/28/2015,"Went to Cheesecake and got served almost raw excessively al-dente pasta, the rigatoni barely gets cooked here. Got it changed and this time got served chicken in a vegetarian pasta. Discovered it when we got home. Called them, manager apologized and that's it.  Came back yesterday to give them another chance, got served chicken in a vegetarian pasta AGAIN. This time it happened to my friend who has been a vegetarian all her life for religious reasons. It is absolutely not acceptable. What if she was allergic? Would that make it a bigger deal for them?  Shut it down if you can't handle the rush. Shitty service is one thing, always serving us meat we don't eat is beyond my tolerance."
Phoenix A.,"Newark, NJ",486,40,13,4.0,11/9/2016,Food was great. Hosting staff talked about customers and gave attitude at patrons. We had a movie to catch and we advised our server of this and she got our drinks from the bar and dinner quickly.
Fedaa J.,"Wayne, NJ",151,82,55,1.0,12/11/2015,So I called in to place an order their phone was not working so I went over there to place it in person and it was complete madness. Very unorganized!!!!! They were receiving the orders and no one was calling out the names so people were there waiting for 40 minutes +  A manager has to jump in and take control and get the orders out after the amount of people waiting was immense. I ended up finally getting my order 45 minutes later and they forgot my cheese cakes!! So I had to go back and then when I got back to work 2 of the salads didn't have dressing. They need to get it together!!
