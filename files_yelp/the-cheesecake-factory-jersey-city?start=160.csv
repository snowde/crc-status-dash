Taneka S.,"New York, NY",2,24,5,1.0,9/11/2016,"On our way back to NYC we were listening to Drake then heard ""why you gotta fight with me at cheesecake you know I love to go there"" and decided to try it here. Not a good idea and after our experience here im also convinced he prob never eats the cheesecake here. We decided to stay to eat our cheesecake and have coffee.... Big mistake. It wasn't so much the mediocre and overly sweet cheesecake but our waiter was terrible!!! Had to wait 20 mins for water while the cheesecake and macchiato already arrived. We were over it at this point but what was annoying was that he kept circling our table, clearly not busy and not bringing back our $10 change!! He wanted a $10 tip for a $32 bill and literally doing nothing. We obviously would never return here. Not even for free."
Justine M.,"Ridgefield, NJ",0,6,,2.0,5/25/2017,"Had dinner last Sunday with my bf and we weren't happy with our experience. The host in the front counter had such a nasty attitude with my bf. [probably having a bad day but the sassy attitude was uncalled for] They ran out of bread and none was available until after we already asked for our check. [the bread was the main reason we went to eat here that day (craving it)] We had ordered a few entrees as take out and I should've checked them before leaving because when we got home, one of our orders had french fries instead of sweet potato fries. One of our entrees had way too much oil on the bottom of the plate. On a positive note, our waitress was very attentive and friendly."
Charlaine M.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,4,4,5.0,12/8/2015,1st day of opening and awesome service. The staff are sharp and attentive and the ambiance is to live for.
Melissa B.,"Huntington Station, NY",63,1,,3.0,12/27/2015,Honestly last night was my first an last visit!! The place is beautiful but they need better seating arrangements for customers who are waiting for over an hour just to be seated. We waited outside because there was just too many people waiting to be seated. As we waited out side the restaurant too many teenagers where walking past I was wondering if I was going to have front row tickets to see a fight break out. Honestly I felt unsafe for the little girl I had with me and for my boyfriends safety because security wasn't doing there job! So after a hour and a half the buzzer finally rings we had sometime to look at the menu on our phone and knew what we wanted. I ordered  pasta Da Vinci it was awesome. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon burger he loved it. And the little lady had the cheese pizza for kids and that was a thumbs up in her book!!  The wait staff needs better training. We had to keep reminding the waitress to bring out our drinks more then three times and when she finally did of course we finished our sodas not a minute after we got them. And we had to keep reminding her to bring the kid size milkshake she needed to keep checking on. All in all the food was good. The wait was horrible and the waitress was below average I don't see myself visiting this Cheesecake Factory in the near future. I rather visit another location with more staff experience.
Kathrine L.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,51,,3.0,10/28/2016,Service is extremely slow and you have to search for your server in order to place your order & check. Bread takes long to come out. My drink glass also had lipstick on it. Food is good.
Tara K.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,71,62,4.0,12/16/2015,It's packed after 6pm everyday and earlier on weekends. Staff is very friendly and patient.  The portions are huge.  Evelyn's pasta was really really good. Didn't love the vegetable salad though. It Didn't have the right blend of sweet and sour. I pulled out the romaine and Brought it home and will fix it with my dressing.  Didn't have room for cheesecake thanks to dinner and the delicious bread! :( Next time only pasta and dessert!
Kimi S.,"Everywhere Branch, MO",0,21,3,4.0,1/31/2016,"Pros: Went with my family and we had a great time! Very clean and upscale. Our waitress was Erica and she was the best! You want a fun and outgoing person then choose her. Food was yummy and perfect temperature.  Cons: The wait is a bit lengthy. When dinner came one of the plates were delayed for a few minutes. So while everyone was eating, one person from our party had to wait a little longer. (Erica did offer a soup on the house and apologized multiple times so that was nice) I think the chairs might not be tight enough because the table next to us complained that their chair was shaking due to one of us moving our legs. That was weird.  Good location overall. I recommend."
Brian S.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",65,225,102,4.0,12/10/2015,"Made my way over to the Cheesecake Factory for their opening on December 8th. The wait time was about on par with any other location, about twenty minutes. Once we were seated, our server was nice but definitely very inexperienced. He had to continually go ask other employees questions that he didn't know the answer to, which while a little more time consuming, is preferable to him making up an answer or not even bothering. Overall, however, everyone was very helpful and attentive. In terms of food, I got my staples, which are the Buffalo Blasts for appetizer and the Cajun Chicken Littles for an entree. I think it's great that a Cheesecake Factory opened up in the Newport Mall, it definitely spruces the place up a bit."
Lumin D.,"Woodhaven, NY",52,7,18,3.0,12/26/2015,"The food is good but the service is terrible! I know this is a new spot thats why there is so many people. So when i went here, i got one of those buzzer things like to put you on a waiting list. the assistant said it would take 40 minutes. so we went and walked around the mall waiting for the buzzer to beat. around an hour later, still hasnt buzzed. so went back to cheesecake, my aunt complained why it hasnt buzzed, and the person said that they had paged the name on the list. ??? they changed the buzzer and put us on the top of the list. 20 minutes later, they get us a table. we order food. food is great. but the waitress keeps coming back to us asking if the food is good as if she hasnt asked it the last 3 times already. we take the food as take out. overall, service to get a table is so crazy. it was only a table for 2 for us so wasnt a big of a deal. although if you are coming in big groups, i advice you to come 2 hours before you plan on eating here."
EZamani P.,"Jersey City, NJ",146,103,106,5.0,12/19/2015,"Great new addition to jersey city.  Welcome Cheesecake Factory.  I love the skinnylicious menu.  What a great location to have this restaurant. Just opened a couple of weeks ago, no reservations yet. Staffs are friendly and the food is fresh."
Kendal K.,"Hoboken, NJ",119,58,186,4.0,12/27/2015,Great new option in the Newport area. I have been here twice for lunch and it does get very crowded around 12:00. They have great lunch specials which are generously portioned and reasonably priced. I had the chipotle chicken pasta (pictured) very tasty and filling! Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  Will definitely be back!
Kelsey M.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,3,,1.0,5/14/2017,"First and last time. The 20 minute wait that the host had told us turned into a 45 minute wait. We asked him how much longer and he sarcastically asked, ""Wait for what?"" We waited another 15 minutes to get asked for drinks. The utensils on the table were still full of cake and the table full of crumbs. Never again."
Sean E.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,20,37,3.0,12/22/2015,"Went there for the first time last night.  Had to wait 40 minutes for a table but chalk that up to the Holiday season and all the shoppers in the mall. My friend ordered a margarita when he took the 1st sip he discovered that instead of salt on the rim of the glass they put sugar.  Totally ruined the drink.  Menu is extensive, at least 6 pages. Food ranges from burgers to pasta dishes to burritos. Had crab cakes for an appetizer which were pretty good. Then I had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken.  Had to add salt and pepper to give it some flavor otherwise it was a bit blandness My friend had the burrito supreme which lived up to its name  (12"")  which was pretty good definitely worth ordering again.  Portions were plenty full.  Didn't have room for cheesecake had to get it to go. I'll go back again after the holidays to give it another chance."
Mallory W.,"West New York, NJ",40,33,28,4.0,9/16/2016,Food was AMAZING...  service was cool. Drinks took forever to come. I had to check at the bar twice because my waiter took forever.  My fiance's drink was weak ( typhoon). I returned it.
Melissa D.,"Newark, NJ",0,1,,1.0,5/27/2017,"Bad service . They had an issue because we had my 8 month old baby in her stroller .Literally the person that was supposed to take us to our table told us that there was no room where to put the stroller because they need it space to go trough hallways. Me and my husband told her that we couldn't leave the stroller behind (we had been shopping , baby bag was there and baby...), she said that , been that the case we had to wait for another location and table.After 10 minutes I approach the front service person and asked him , Why the inconvenience? , that we just wanted to be seated and eat.The same girl just interrupted our conversation saying that there were no tables available yet because of the stroller. At this point I felt discrimination against us for having a baby with us. We still waited about 2 more minutes and then the girl said :Ok , come with me there is a booth available ,as long the stroller is out of the way is fine."
Sophia B.,"New York, NY",72,10,18,1.0,12/26/2015,"I am currently in the establishment waiting for 15 minutes for my cheesecake. Not to mention I waited about an hour for the food, which came subpar and cold. The place is also half empty, so there is no excuse for it arriving so late. Also, they select who to give bread baskets to. After being seated for 15 minutes I asked when we were getting the bread basket to which he replied that they had just ran out. Then, he said that they said it was coming out of the oven and we would shortly receive it. We never got the basket btw. This place was a headache of constant waiting! Go to the one in short hills. I have been to that one over ten times and have loved every moment there. Update: After 30 minutes we got the slice. We denied and then they offered it for free."
Sanjana A.,"Jersey City, NJ",30,87,322,4.0,3/5/2016,The roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread was yummy. Blueberry mojito very refreshing. And service is nice. Our hostess was super nice.
Jeff O.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",63,44,2,3.0,1/5/2016,"This lower review is strictly based on the waitress.. Tried to order a moscow mule (which consist of vodka, ginger beer and lime). They have their own version of the drink which also has pineapple.. I told her i wanted a regular mule no pineapple. I was unable to get it.. The reasoning made absolutely no sense. The attention we got was very subpar. I understand its the holidays, but when you come by my table to let me know the food is delayed and see that my water is empty. And walk away is not the standard im used to. That was after waiting 15min to have her stop by to see how we were doing. I order some water for my son because he finished his juice.. And this waitress took another 15 min. And its not like she is busy. I see her talking with co workers.. Its just horrible. Now for the food.. THE AVOCADO Egg roll is amazing. Highly recommend it."
Yilin H.,"Jersey City, NJ",19,4,14,4.0,12/22/2015,"Everything is yummy here I'm not kidding. They also provide skinny meals with a 590 or less calories. Still tasty! The only thing they need to improve is service. The longest waiting time I have ever experienced so far compared to other states cheesecake factory. Please hire more host and servers!! I waited outside for about 30mins that's fine, but I'm not comfortable with an another 60mins to get my food!"
Ben B.,"New York, NY",0,14,,2.0,10/28/2016,"I live in the neighborhood and was looking forward to coming here. There is definitely some issues with management:  - Too many staff members not really serving anyone. There were 4 people behind the host stand, chatting and laughing with eachother... never looking me in the eye. I felt ignored.  - The waitress was nice, but seemed overworked. She was hard to find throughout the meal - One of our appetizers never came out..... by the time the entrees came we didn't want it anymore  - I ordered a burger and the bottom of the bun was soggy wet. I couldn't find the waitress and had to flag down another staff member (also asking for ketchup). I got a new bun, but the meal wasn't very good due to this. The ketchup eventually came - 10 minutes later.  - Waitstaff always seemed rushed, and asking for things like refills on drinks was hard to do because I felt I always had to chase down someone.  - I felt that becuase an appetizer never came out and the burger bun was so soggy, there would have been some sort of apology (a free apetizer, soda, dessert... something) Nothing was ever offered and because of this, I probably won't be back for sometime to come.  Overall, I give this place a subpar review (especially relative to other locations throughout the US). There were a few things that were on-par but there is a lot of work that needs to be done. I see this a management error.  Too many staff members for poor customer service. Wake up."
