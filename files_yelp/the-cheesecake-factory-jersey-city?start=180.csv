Marlon S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,7,,1.0,10/2/2016,"The utensils they gave has still has sauce and rice. So gross!!!!!!      The manager apologized and said she will come back to check on us, but never came back.  Eeeeewwwww!!!!!"
Christina L.,"Cerritos, CA",98,12,14,5.0,1/30/2016,"Wait time was around 45 min, but that gave me time to shop around! The staff was very friendly, and food came out very quickly! Like all other Cheesecake Factories, portions are HUGE and makes the price definitely worth it! I got the Tuna Tataki salad, and it was delicious! The tuna was prepared perfectly and melted in your mouth. The dressing for the salad was amazing! If I could buy that dressing to bring home, I would! It was light yet flavorful, and it really helped compliment the tuna! I would definitely recommend it!"
Julia B.,"Bayonne, NJ",21,22,64,4.0,12/12/2015,I love the cheese cake factory so when I saw they were opening one up at newport mall I had to come. First we had to wait 54 mins for a table the place was packed.  Once we sat down i order a Pina colada to drink once it came it was really watery I sent it back and they made me a better one. The food was delicious and our waiter steven was very nice. I am giving this location a 4 out 5 because of the watery drink and the fact they seemed a bit disorganized service was not fast at all. They just opened so hopefully they will get better because the food is outstanding.
LP R.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,19,54,5.0,2/9/2016,"Ok this is my new favorite spot.  I live in the area and I've come here atleast 3 times, and plan on going back.  If you come at their busiest time, there will be a wait, but I've come before 4 and haven't had to wait.   My favorite dish is the Hibachi Steak, and I'm in love with avocado egg rolls and Cuban egg rolls.  I've had eggplant parmesan and it was huge portions.  The lettuce wraps are a fun appetizer.   The Typhoon punch and the Tropical Martini were good. The cheesecakes are delicious, I've had the salted caramel and the tiramisu cheesecake. I plan on going back, there's so much to try. The food is delicious."
Scott S.,"Jersey City, NJ",32,66,23,4.0,1/23/2016,"What can you say about the Cheesecake Factory?  Honestly, it doesn't matter what city you're in, the menu is always consistent and the food is always great! I dined there last night and for 2 people, it was a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad for a Friday.  I overheard parties more than 2 people ranged from an hour to two.   The only reason I gave this establishment 4 out of 5 stars is because of the server we had.  It's really a crap shot when you dine at TCF.  We ordered our app of the factory nachos and it came out before we even received our drinks.  We were extremely disappointed with the service.  The server tried to push us forward with the meal but we made sure to take our time.   I ordered the crusted chicken Romano and it was delicious but if you order it, ensure to ask for the sauce on the side as they over sauced the pasta on my plate.   Also, we got the peanut butter fudge ripple cheesecake to go only to realize that they give you a smaller piece of cake when you get it to-go rather than order it at the table.   Regardless of my experience last night, this restaurant is always a great place to dine!"
Ana S.,"Jersey City, NJ",471,8,4,5.0,9/23/2016,"Omg I'm so happy to have The cheesecake factory so close to me...love the food, the ambience and the customer service. Best appetizer ever are the mac and cheese fried balls... must have. The one thing I wish they would do its simplify the menu... it has soooo much and it's kind of overwhelming, that I often skip looking at it and go for the same dish. But the staff is super and the food delish. And now I have a new personal fav when it come to the cheesecake... tiramisu cheesecake... ummm the best of both world."
G E.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,5,,1.0,4/10/2017,"The service and management at this Cheesecake Factory located in Newport Mall, Jersey City has gone from poor to terrible. The first time I ever made an attempt to visit was shortly after they opened 2 years ago. I loved the establishment in other locations, and was always pleased with the Miso Salmon dish for nearly 16 years without a problem. I tried to pick up an order at the Newport Mall location shortly after they opened and they kept me on hold for 15-20 minutes or more (sounds unbelievable right...yeah I know, I couldn't believe it either). After all that hold time they still never took my order. I hung up the phone and opted for another restaurant   The last time I visited was last year. I ordered salmon that tasted somewhat like old fish, it was so bad I actually couldn't eat it and had to send it back (something I really hate to do). I then asked for chicken and biscuits as a substitute and they told me it was sold out.   Tonight I went back. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (with no one ahead of us) even though there were empty seats and I was told our wait would be short. Staff was nonchalant about clearing and cleaning the tables that were recently vacated by previous patrons.    I proceeded to the men's restroom once we were seated, and to my surprise there was absolutely no hand soap! I asked staff could i get some soap. After 5 minutes of waiting near the restroom for soap, I saw staff approach the manager who gave a nonchalant gesture toward my direction. Staff then gave a shameful look in my direction and went back to preparing tables. I waited another couple of minutes and approached the same staff, who then went on another search. This time the hostess went to the restroom to check. When she came out of the women's room without soap I asked her for soap. She said ok. Then the manager who wouldn't move to help me before finally comes in my direction to apologize. He blamed the lack of soap on the mall being closed at the time and said they're waiting for a shipment. I didn't believe him. Needless to say, a restaurant should always have soap in the restroom at all times, otherwise the restaurant itself should be closed.    Another 2-3 minutes later the manager comes back with soap from the kitchen. I waited for soap so long until my sister who accompanied me thought something bad possibly happened and told my son to check on me.   I ordered chicken and biscuits. The waitress was pleasant, but my chicken and mashed potatoes was lukewarm, and the biscuits were cold. I was afraid to send it back after the poor service I already received. I begrudgingly ate it with a resolve that I would never return to this establishment again.   This place is giving the Cheesecake Factory franchise a bad reputation. They really need to do something about this. If anyone wants to try Cheesecake Factory, don't go to the Newport Mall Jersey City location. Choose another location, or you might be as disappointed as I was and am now."
Beverly C.,"Jersey City, NJ",26,123,171,5.0,2/10/2016,Excellent food and service. The menu is fun and fresh. Skip the food court on the upper level and go here you will not be disappointed.
Abhi K.,"Jersey City, NJ",38,23,19,4.0,2/28/2016,"Great ambience, food and drinks. Always super packed, so make sure you are not time bound."
Jennifer M.,"Honolulu, HI",337,2,1,1.0,2/15/2017,"I am a regular at the Cheesecake Factory in my hometown in CA, I have never had a problem... until now. My friends and I came in on 2/13 for  lunch around 2:30pm, The restaurant was quite empty. Our server came right up and was quite attentive at first. He went ahead took our order, 20+min later no food and no server in site. Our drinks were empty we had to ask other employees for refills. Finally, our waiter saw us and noticed we had no food, he was like let me go check but never made eye contact or asked if we needed anything. It took approximately 40 min for our food to arrive at our table. This is unacceptable for a restaurant that wAs not busy. The food was dropped off and again our server went missing. Each rare time he would pass by we would try just over look our table. We wanted to order dessert and once again it was a mission to locate our server. He finally came by took our dessert ordered and dropped off our check. When I took a look at my check I noticed that he Charged me for a dinner dish when I specifically told him the lunch size. When I brought it to his attention he wanted to start arguing with me saying I was wrong. He finally sorry let me get that fixed. After fixing the check our dessert took approx 15 min to arrive at our table as well as our revised check. I forgot to add that the server was also waiting the table behind us and he also messed up their order. In the end, this has been clearly the worst experience I have had at a Cheesecake Factory and I have been to many all over the country. I still love the food and hopefully this was just an off day for the server. My friend and I are previous restaurant workers and we know when we are receiving bad service and we both agreed this clearly was horrible service."
Tim K.,"North Bergen, NJ",8,12,8,5.0,1/3/2016,"My wife and I came here Christmas eve. and the place was packed! We were excited that a new place opened so we tried it and glad we did. It was about a 40 min wait as we expected since its new and on a holiday night but didn't mind. Service: The waiter...Tyquan...was extremely friendly and got down low enough so we were all face to face. He answered our questions and ordered our meal. He served us well, asked how everything was going 15 minutes after we started and the two of us were pleased. 5 stars here Meals: I ordered their Louisiana chicken, My wife got the Thai glazed salmon . The taste was great !!!  The amount of pasta they gave me was in abundance compared to other places and it was spicy! My wife loved her Salmon and the two of us could""nt  finish. The serving size is huge. 5 stars Setting inside : Dimmed lights, very cozy and unique shape. There is outside seating if you wish. I highly recommend this place if you don't mind the wait. After all, if this place was bad, there wouldn't be so many people inside. That tells you something. Cheesecake: How many varieties do you like? there are so many that you can try a different type each day and you will be done with the menu in 3-4 weeks. The taste is great ."
Jamielee N.,"Henderson, NV",210,9,9,5.0,12/29/2015,This is new to Jersey City so everyone wants to come and try out the food so don't be surprised if it's packed when you come inside. They opened December 8th so it's always busy when you come in. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating. The servers were so polite and attentive to my table. The managers are very friendly. I definitely recommend you coming in and trying out the food and cheesecake despite the really long wait. It is definitely worth it despite what others say. You should definitely try it out and have a taste for your self!!! I recommend the steak diane and the Godiva cheesecake for sure!  P.S. Come around 2-3ish pm. That's when people from work start to leave to go back to work. There shouldn't be a wait by then.
Jennifer V.,"Hoboken, NJ",10,46,,4.0,12/29/2015,"Obviously since this place is so new, I went in hoping for the worst and the result was much better so I was pleased! We booked a business lunch for 15 people during the holidays which is a task for any restaurant.  Cheesecake did as best as they could with our group.  We had to arrive at 11:30 to be seated at 12pm to ensure our table was set up (they don't take reservations).  I am rating this 4 stars mainly due to the servers.  We had 2 servers and they were both amazing and tentative.  The manager was friendly as well. Food came out just as ordered which is another plus. They still need to work on timing, as everything took a long time to come out, but anyone that excepts 5 star service at a chain restaurant during the holidays is kidding themselves!  Come on people - this is a Cheesecake Factory!"
Miao X.,"Manhattan, NY",184,75,52,4.0,7/31/2016,Ordered 6 inch original cheesecake for my birthday. It's far more a good deal than buying as slices. You pay extra 3 dollar to write birthday words on a chocolate plate.
Adonis M.,"Newark, NJ",1,50,7,2.0,1/1/2016,"Horrible service. Came here on New Year's Day and fortunately found a first come first serve high-top table within a minute. However, for others that weren't so lucky, they had to wait about 50-60 minutes.  The table still had the mess from the previous people sitting there (dirty dishes, napkins, and glasses) it took about 15 minutes for someone to clear the table.  The waitress was ok but not very talkative or friendly. The food was good as was the strawberry cheesecake. I thought it would have the strawberry sauce on the top but it was only 3 strawberries hanging out on the top.  It took about another 10 minutes for them to bring our check and another 10 for them to pick it up and charge it. Overall, decent food but bad service."
R P.,"New York, NY",3,60,5,1.0,6/13/2016,"I have always maintained that Cheesecake Factory was one of the only ""dine in "" chains I didn't mind eating at .  The service here was atrocious.  Our waiter was great but the hostess and hostess station is a mess.  Lots of eye rolling, snarky comments, and butting in to customer conversations there.  I don't often leave bad reviews, BUT when you walk in there is a sign directing you to go see the hostess.... She shouldn't ignore you for 10 minutes while you stand in front of the booth.  CHEESECAKE factory I would be happy to tell you exactly when I was there.... I certainly won't be back ."
Jessica G.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,32,48,3.0,12/26/2015,Didn't have to wait long to be seated. Eton was a great attentive server. My chicken Alfredo was very tasty & fresh & I made sure I took my strawberry cheese cake to go.
Elle D.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,,1.0,3/15/2017,Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever and this is my favorite restaurant. We waited 2 hours to seat a table of 13 after we were told 45 minutes. We asked multiple times the status of our table for an ETA. Once we were finally seated there was only a table seating for 11 and then they stated we can all just squeeze in. Completely unprofessional and the hostesses were not interested and rude in accommodating us. Not to mention we tried to call ahead to make them aware of the large party we planned on bringing so they would be prepared. I will never return to this location. Once again Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant and this was by far the worst experience.
Cyndi Where L.,"Jersey City, NJ",35,2,1,4.0,12/29/2015,"Well I for one am excited to have this restaurant in our city it's beautiful inside and the food is tasty, I've found the service to be on point they may have to work out some kinks but overall I'm pleased and I will visit often you gotta try the mango key lime cheesecake *****"
Sharon D.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,58,4,1.0,8/5/2016,"I was so excited to be going to Cheesecake Factory for the first time in my life after hearing about how great it was, how much food you get, blah blah.  My friend and I went last Friday night.  We had quite a long wait, which I expected.  We bought drinks.  They were supposed to have alcohol in them.  I have a very low alcohol tolerance level an can basically get drunk if you show me a picture of a bottle of vodka. It's ridiculous how little alcohol it takes to give me a nice buzz.  Finishing a single drink is hard for me to do.  I downed a huge Caribbean style drink and didn't feel a thing, which means only one thing .... their drinks have hardly any alcohol in them.  So we finally order dinner.  I had a craving for the fish & chips.  It was so greasy I couldn't eat it.  What's worse is that when I brought it home my pets wouldn't touch it either.  It came with fries (which I normally don't eat) but since I wasn't eating that fish, I tried a couple.  They were also greasy and tasted just like fish.  It turns out they cook the fish and the fries in the same oil.  In short, it was a big waste of time and money.  I was very disappointed. The waited was hard to get hold of, so I didn't bother complaining.  He didn't seem like he would care anyway."
