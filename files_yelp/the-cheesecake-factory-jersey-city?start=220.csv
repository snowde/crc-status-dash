Jennifer M.,"Jersey City, NJ",109,9,3,2.0,1/11/2016,I generally enjoy The Cheesecake Factory and have on occasion gone to the ones in PARAMUS and such. I am super happy to have it here in Jersey City YET the staff continues to not step up. They are nice. Yes. But inexperienced. Frequently bringing food to the wrong table. We waited over 25 minutes for cheesecake (already made) to be brought to the table. Our waitress (super nice) forgot things multiple times - after multiple reminders - like a straw. Honestly there are so so many staff and waiters / waitresses and it feels aimless and unfocused. Is it management?  Is it inexperienced servers?  All I know is I won't be coming here often.  Sorry :( I wanted to love ya.
Rebecca P.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,6,19,1.0,12/11/2015,"This place has the WORST service when ordering cheesecake to go!! We have people just standing there when all the orders were taken but takeout cheesecake orders were coming out! There's no proactive staff to bag the dessert and giving out to the million people waiting for their order as soon as they were boxed!!! I know it might be your job just to take orders at the register but when u don't have any orders to take, it doesn't take much to help the pack the orders and call out the names! It's not a crime to step in and help out!  Price of cheesecake is ridiculous!! 8 dollars per slice??!!! Are these made out of gold??!!! That is crazy!!! I won't come here again! Restaurant is all about the service and the service at this restaurant was -1 star!!!!  Even the people behind me was stating that it shouldn't take this long to get a slice of cheesecake when it's already pre made and pre-cut  so all they have to do is take a slice and put it in a box! I didn't realize i was asking for them to build me a rocket!  I thought this was a great addition to jersey city dining experience but I was completely fooled!!!"
Shari M.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,19,24,3.0,12/4/2015,"Attended their first day opening practice/training session where management uses the time to train staff. The decor is beautiful, more modern than a few of the Cheesecake Factory's ive been to which is a plus because some look dated. The music played was nice, Selena Gomez, India Aire, Adele so it was a mix of r&b and pop with the occasional Christmas song as it is December. My server was Tey. He was handsome and kind but spoke way too low. I could hardly hear him sitting a few inches away from him. His trainer Grecia was awesome. She was kind, attentive and cheerful. It's nice to be served by someone who knows their stuff. The session included a complimentary beverage, a shared appetizer, entree and shared desert. For drinks I had a Blueberry Mojito, it wasn't to berry-y or minty. It was the perfect blend and refreshing. My mom had a glass of moscato and they're not stingy with the pour. The appetizer we chose was the fried chicken sliders, they were huge! and spicy. My entree was the fettuccini Alfredo which I didn't like. the noodles were tooo chewy and the sauce was underseasoned. My mom had the everything pizza pie which she enjoyed. it had pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach and something else i can't recall. On the the cheesecake which is always the best part. The Dulce De Leche caramel cheesecake was delicious. It's really sweet so it may be too sweet for some but it was perfect for me."
Hayley K.,"Vancouver, WA",0,4,1,5.0,1/22/2016,"I was impressed with the great service and delicious food that I received here. Sherry, my server, was so nice and so knowledgable about the entire menu. She made me feel like a valued customer. I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and was thoroughly pleased with my decision. I will definitely be coming back to The Cheesecake Factory. Hopefully it'll be just as good the second time around."
Angelo R.,"Middletown, NJ",0,20,,4.0,12/15/2015,"The food was excellent not the usual franchise run of the mill fare. Burger was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Service was ok as our waitress must have been new. Long waits in between the bread, the meal, the dessert, and finally the check. I had my 4 year old niece with me so you can imagine those waits seemed even longer. Lol. Godiva cheesecake was heavenly! Overall I will go again when time is not pressing."
Anelise D.,"Manhattan, NY",11,7,,5.0,5/14/2016,"So good! Our server was great, in a party of 4 every single appetizer, dish and cheescake we ordered were delicious."
Lori B.,"Bushwick, NY",0,5,1,5.0,5/13/2016,"Funny things, I don't like cheesecake, I usually order the carrot cake! Yummy! And my favorite, shrimp scampi! EXTRA large shrimp! I forgot what drink I ordered, I believe it was a mojito, but it was delish!!"
Ebony J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,124,7,4.0,3/12/2016,This is my first time experiencing Cheesecake Factory and I was very pleased with my food and service. I would have given 5 stars but the wait time was very long. We were told the wait time was 40 minutes but we ended up waiting for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Once we were seated we were greeted immediately and everything from there went smoothly. I enjoyed the calamari and the large portion of buffalo blast. I loved the chicken and shrimp jambalaya pasta. I was so full that I didn't order any dessert so I will need to do this on my next visit.
Sara S.,"Union City, NJ",52,60,1,3.0,3/14/2016,They need to manage the waiting area a little better. So many people everywhere it gets confusing.  Not sure why we didn't get served bread. Ordered a pasta dish and the pasta was over cooked. Didn't enjoy my meal.
N S.,"San Diego, CA",0,26,,2.0,10/9/2016,"Below average falafel salad. It  was missing two of the important ingredients, cucumbers and feta. I told the waiter but he could care less. I am usually a fan of Cheesecake Factory but this experience does not make me eager to go back. Disappointing meal indeed!"
Kristine T.,"Bayonne, NJ",211,13,4,5.0,12/28/2015,My experience was very nice! I came in and there was a short wait. The host was so sweet and found us a booth that was very comfortable. I got the pasta carbonara which was good and also my favorite toasted marshmallow cheesecake. Our server was nice and she was quick to bring us everything we needed. I was very happy !!
Joshua R.,"Manhattan, NY",39,8,6,1.0,10/31/2016,"Wish i can give a 0.... I Walked in and was at at 4:11pm i was sat/dining alone i went through the menu and decided on my full order quickly since i love cheesecake factory and at 430pm i proceeded to walk out because no one greeted or even acknowledged after the hostess sat me... its a monday afternoon on halloween the restaurant was empty and there were only 4 ppl at the bar. TERRIBLE SERVICE! OR NON EXISTANT SERVICE!! MY FIRST TIME IN THIS MALL AND IN NJ AND WHAT AN EMPRESSION!  I FREQUENT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IN NYC, WHERE IM FROM AND EVEN THERE IN A SUPER BUSY NIGHT THEY AT LEAST SAY HELLO OR BRING WATER... what made it worst was i see servers bringing out food and serving other tables so i was patient but once i noticed staff walking paste over and over was when i walked and and of course no one even noticed. I wont blame it on me being latino since i hope in 2016 i wasnt being ignored because of that but i was the only single person there not hard to spot. Please address the issue i hope it doesnt happen to someone else... i am happily at johnny rockets eating and writing this horrible experience review at now 4:40pm and i was sat order taken and my soda and water in hand!"
Nichel T.,"Mount Vernon, NY",27,1,,5.0,5/2/2016,"Great environment, very attentive staff and the food is delicious... The miso salmon is always on point, I really enjoy eating here. I've been there multiple times n I'm always a very happy patron... Chipotle pasta n the bbq wings r a must have also ... Really love that they do takeout also"
Alexander P.,"New York, NY",128,6,6,4.0,12/12/2015,"Good food good atmosphere , great ,friendly service , would have gotten 5 stars but the fried Mac and cheese balls my fiancee order they ran out of ,"
Jun M.,"Jersey City, NJ",19,19,11,1.0,1/20/2016,"I really can't understand why people said here is a good place to eat. Neither beef nor salad is fit what I image get from here. Try here without a mind for treating your sense of taste is a good idea. But if you have a official meeting held only in Newport, come here."
Cami P.,"ASTORIA, NY",20,48,66,2.0,1/2/2016,"This place has a lot of kinks to work out. I'm going to blame it on the fact that it's still new. They told me the wait was 70 mins which was ok cuz I had to shop so came back about 45 mins later and was next so that wasn't too bad. Service was lacking major!! Ordered kale salad, they forgot the apples and green beans that go in there. I finished my salad app before we even got our drinks, water & lemonade. Shrimp angel hair pasta, shrimp was way over cooked, tough  My dish orange chicken, mash was cold, veggies way over cooked. Oh and we had to ask for bread, even after my appetizer. Smh!! Hackensack is so much better!!!!"
Jeet S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,6,4.0,12/18/2015,40 min was waiting  time..Service is good..No any good arrangements for people who will be in waiting. You should have really  good patience  to wait..I will suggest  people call them and reserve  table before going..overall good experience. .deserts must try item..cocktails  are OK ok..
Oleksandr R.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,27,9,2.0,3/3/2016,"Waited for 30 mins and nobody stopped by to take the order. Interesting, what's the waiting time when the place is full... Anyway left without trying the food, nobody even noticed. Time wasting. Disappointing."
Divya M.,"Jersey City, NJ",26,161,12,3.0,2/8/2016,"I feel so good to see Cheesecake factory in Jersey City. so close to the place. However, the taste quality is way too different from their regular restaurant."
Tasha C.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,84,351,4.0,1/18/2016,Went there on the first day of opening so everything was shining brand new. Workers w. huge smiles their faces must have been hurting lol. Best thing I had on all visits was the cheesecake (one was carrot) n the fried Mac n cheese balls I live for these but pretty sure it's artery clogging otherwise  would eat them every other day .  When very busy wait for take out can be nerve wrecking even for cheesecake which located AT the take out counter.
