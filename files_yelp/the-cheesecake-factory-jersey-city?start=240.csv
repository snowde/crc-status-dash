Victor B.,"New York, NY",4,183,,2.0,9/12/2016,"Great food but lousy, rude service... We came saturday night and expected a long wait, which was fine, but then our buzzers rang and the girl in the front of the restaurant said we were ready, after telling us it's a 15 min wait. Then she told us it was a mistake and the table wasn't ready, which would've been nice to know before making us walk the whole way thru the restaurant.  Then our waiter came and took our orders but it took forever for him to come. I had to flag someone else down twice to get the waiter. I ordered a drink and he never delivered my drink. We ordered the hot cheese and spinach dip as the appetizer and it was great. I was then ready to order the main entree and it took him at least a half an hour to come. I ordered my entree (the farfalle with chicken and garlic) and it was very tasty. Had absolutely no complaints and the portion sizes were reasonable. I asked him again for my drink (Mai Tai margarita) and he said he would get it. Second time around, STILL no drink and I decided to just call it quits. Then when we were ready to pay, he did not come back until for another 15 minutes. We assumed to just pay one front register then, until the waiter FINALLY came and said ""where do you think you're going""? I told him we were going to pay in the front and he rudely said ""NO, YOU PAY ME!!"" Well, yes, but you never showed up, so we assumed you forgot, and were just going to go the register which was right next to our table.  Should not have even given him a 20% tip given his attitude and his ability to forget my Mai Tai cocktail TWICE. The service was terrible, and while the food was good, the service alone will not make us come back. There are so many better places in the area."
Lauren D.,"Montgomery, AL",36,1,,1.0,4/3/2016,Worst experience. There was leftover food on the silverware and my cup had stickiness on the outside. I got the chicken Alfredo and it taste like they had put shrimp on it and took it off.
N M.,"Montclair, NJ",7,34,5,3.0,1/12/2016,"I have been to other cheesecake locations in the past, but had been disappointed with this one.  It has been a little while since I have been to one, but was not impressed with the food.  The service was good, but the food.  Had the mac and cheese balls that was good also the avacado egg rolls that was ok.  Decided to have the quesadilla with chicken , but not only was it not hot, but I asked for chicken and it looked as if they counted how many pieces of cube chicken would be used.  I just really thought you really can't mess up a quesadilla.  Since it is my first time to this location I would give it another try, but if it is a chain shouldn't the results be the same regardless where you go?"
Chet N.,"Bayonne, NJ",105,7,11,1.0,4/15/2016,"A little disappointed because I don't drink and I ordered an odouls ( non alcoholic beer) they don't carry any. Also I ordered the turkey burger and asked for it with no mushrooms, they said it is a premade patty with mushrooms already in it . That is kind of stupid because if you don't like mushrooms or are allergic you are out of luck!"
Alison F.,"Jersey City, NJ",349,21,2,4.0,12/31/2015,I received a $30 gift card from Cheesecake factory.... They were extremely apologetic
Janki T.,"Jersey City, NJ",33,3,,3.0,3/21/2016,"The service is very bad. We had to wait for 40 mins after ordering the food. Short staffed. But as it is new to the area, i can give it a pass."
Jenny L.,"Jersey City, NJ",81,27,3,5.0,2/20/2016,Theres a reason why this restaurant is always busy and packed. Their drinks & food are delicious. My 1st time coming here and the wait was long but it was worth it. Definitely coming back.
Joey M.,"Jersey City, NJ",109,6,,1.0,12/30/2015,The server was extremely slow.  Major delays getting a table ready. Extremely disorganized.  Will never return to this location for sure.
Angela D.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,3,,1.0,3/11/2017,"The food came dried out; from being under heat lamp for about 10 minutes. (I have 20 years food and bar experience). 2 people out of four recieved the wrong order out of 3 medium, 1 medium well mac cheese hamburgers. The food tasted like trash. The fries were cold and the tomatoe was wilting/soggy. Not worth $100 bill. Bad service. It was not even half full and they gave us resistance to have a big table instead of being cramped into a small table. We are tall persons. It used to be good back in december; now very disappointing. There are also many children/teens causing great disturbance out side. Fighting and filming getting thrown out of the mall. Big embarassment to bring family and friends for an enjoyable meal. I wont go again. Thanks for the great december meals but now the cheese cake slices are geting very small as well. Not worth the value any more. The waiter was making a face when he saw people eating with knife and fork. Very rude."
Amna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,,2.0,7/31/2016,Food was disgusting first they gave us undercooked or over cooked pasta. We then talked to the manager who gave us a different meal which was bad as well we ordered cheesecakes which was ok not worth your money. There factory nachos were very good the only good thing we received.
A V.,"New York, NY",9,52,9,4.0,7/14/2016,"Had dinner here with a friend a few months ago. It was my first time at any Cheescake Factory. Very long wait on a Saturday night to the point of getting fed up. But let me just say, value for the buck was top notch. I mean, the quantity and quality of the foods was amazing for very cheap. I get the whole cheesecake factory thing now. Mexican tortilla salad without the meat was enough to feed 3 people."
Charmaine B.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,13,,4.0,2/13/2016,I enjoyed my visit here. This location is very busy but food is great and excellent customer service. Be prepared for a wait time.
Diana C.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,5,,2.0,2/9/2016,Food was good nonething great but the service was horrible 30 minutes for a glass of water 45 for food sat with empty glasses of drinks  for entire meal won't be back
Amanda A.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,6,,3.0,2/18/2016,"I've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory locations and this one is generally unimpressive. For starters the drink I ordered was huge and it was a frozen drink which wasn't specified on the menu.  I don't particularly like frozen drinks and if I would've known I wouldn't have ordered it.  Most of the menu items you couldn't even order. I've worked in the restaurant industry and I know how it can get but it was just a little too disorganized.  The food was just lacking.  It looks nice and all but flavor just falls short.  The wait was a little long to get a table but knowing the business it didn't really bother me too much. It was an OK experience, nothing that really grasped my attention."
Henny Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,2,1.0,7/25/2016,you guys should watch who you hire. Went for lunch and left with a broken relationship thanks to your nasty waiter.
Brian H.,"Ozone Park, NY",0,7,,5.0,1/17/2016,"Great place to come eat with the family. Great food, fast service and love the drinks not much to complain about"
Igor M.,"Woodrow, Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2016,"Horrible service. We were seated and waited. Waitress never showed up. They simply forgot about us. At the same time, new people were coming and would be served. We had  to leave. Hostesses were useless and had no clue what and how it happened..."
Dawn P.,"West New York, NJ",2,3,,3.0,11/16/2016,"My boyfriend and I were just at this location today.. a Wednesday afternoon around 4pm. Shouldn't be too busy, right? So, we walk in and make our way to the host. There was one party in front of us who were being taken care of. They get seated. Our turn! Yay! Sooo hungry! So we move up to the desk, and the host decided that now would be a good time to start shooting the breeze with her friend, (could've been a coworker not sure on that) for what ends up being 5 minutes. She completely ignores our presence. For 5 whole minutes. Now, we are the only two standing there. No one blocking her view of us. No way she could've missed us. She just chose to ignore us. When she was finally done with her very important  convo, we ask to be seated.  There's a wait because they're ""short staffed"". Mind you the restaurant was probably half filled, if that. Plenty of available tables! We were so beyond annoyed at this point that we decide to buy a cheesecake and get the hell out of Dodge. Here's where the three stars come into play... the gentlemen who helped us at the counter was a doll. Very attentive, very sweet! It was much appreciated after being blatantly ignored by the host. Won't come back to eat here. But again, my hats off to the man at the cheesecake counter. Two thumbs up for your service with a smile. You're a diamond in the very rude rough."
Robert M.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,9,,5.0,6/5/2016,My favorite place to come for breakfast since I live in Newport. Their Juevos rancheros are so good. I have tried every restaurants Juevos rancheros in the area including a high end steak house and Cheececake factory is still better and was less expansive.  Yum.
Richard L.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,7,,5.0,5/22/2016,Its a great place to eat monday-thursday but this is place is a nightmare friday-sunday
