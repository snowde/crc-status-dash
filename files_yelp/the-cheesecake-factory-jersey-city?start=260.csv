Jailyne A.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,,4.0,12/28/2015,"For a brand new opening restaurant, the service was great! Food was delicious and I would definitely recommend the buffalo blast an appetizer, a pasta as a entree, and the marshmallow s'more cheesecake as an dessert! The wait was a reasonable time to wait considering how busy it was, but if the restaurant is busy, that says something! I would highly recommend this restaurant to have a great time and great food!"
K M.,"Middle River, MD",0,8,,1.0,12/13/2015,"Would give zero stars if I could. Worst service I've ever experienced. Not sure if our waitress was high or heavily medicated but she knew nothing about the menu, didn't even know what a L.I.T. was.  So disorganized, was seated for a half hour before we even got bread. We got to-go boxes as soon as our entrees came out because we were desperate to get out of there. The best part is we had ordered an entree to go and our waitress brought that out before she brought our entrees to us. Could go on and on but long story short, go to any other cheesecake factory!!"
Jorge S.,"Jersey City, NJ",52,1,,2.0,12/10/2015,"The restaurant looks great but the wait was 1 hrs 15 min to be fair they literally just opened yesterday but still kinda sucked it's Wednesday.we get to the table silverware is directly on the table kinda nasty.there was no water served to the table even after requested by several members of our party.We ordered three Bar Drinks but only got two, ordered three sodas and the sprite was a bit flat the Coke was perfect. Bread was served once after about a half hour of sitting at a table with nothing but two of the three bar drinks we ordered.the appetizers came out and looked great food was delicious.entree was next and again delicious even though the burgers looked like brown snowballs instead of a patty but the taste was quality good food.we ordered cheesecake slices to go and our check. We literally sat there for 15 min waiting for our check and our Togo cheesecake. Waitress finally comes with our check but no cheesecake it was very clear she forgot. She did come back with the cheesecake but that was like another 10 min wait.overall the Wait to sit plus dinner this took like 3 hours."
John C.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,,3.0,5/4/2016,"I've been to this location quite a few times.  The food is consistently good.  Service is attentive, aside from once or twice when they seems short staffed.  They almost never get my order right though."
Ketkee M.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,2.0,1/12/2016,"I have always loved cheesecake factory. I never faced any problems but jersey mall branch has terrible service. We visited twice to the same branch and given terrible service. Waiters are not trained properly. Order is not served on time. You need to request for food, complimentary bread even cutlery."
Stefano T.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,43,13,2.0,12/14/2015,"Went there yesterday. Had a 50 minute wait for a table, it was pretty busy but we did see tables that were free but just not being flipped quickly enough. When we eventually got seated, our server was nice and took drinks/food order, the drinks took a fair amount of time to be brought to the table and the order was not complete. Probably took around 20-30 minutes to receive complete drinks order. Appetizers took around 30-40 minutes to be brought up, we had literally just finished our Apps when they brought the entree's up. The app plates had not even been cleared, the entree orders were wrong (One contained meat for a vegetarian...Even though we made it absolutely clear that the order should not contain meat) for two of the party and one was sent back completely. I just lived with the mistake on mine as i did not want to wait an eternity for it to be changed. One of the managers came over and comp'd one app and took the entree off the bill that had to be sent back due to length of time it took to receive the food and then the lack of break between courses. I get that this place is new and they are ironing out the kinks but we were hearing that other tables were being comp'd food due to the wait times. There are a ton of staff working at the restaurant but there just seems to be a lack of direction for them...Maybe management needs to step in more and direct as it seems that no one seems to know what they are doing there. Will try again in a few weeks and hopefully they have sorted their issues out."
Bryan A.,"Avon Park, FL",0,2,,2.0,5/1/2016,First time to this location.  Been to MANY locations over the past 15 years.  Was first introduced to beets in west palm beach fl location as a mistake but fell in LOVE with the country French salad.   I ordered it in JC tonight and wow did it fall short!!!Mixed greens with the slightest coating of dressing NO beets and NO goat cheese.  Whoever is on salads needs to be let go!!!!    Beets and cheese came quickly as server was totally on it. Soo sorry!! No prob.....salad is completed with more dressing and yummy just like always.  just like all other visits to other locations (I travel for a living so).   Ordered a tasty farfalle cream chicken and roasted garlic dish.  So tasty.   Sadly it was WAY short on the chicken.  Not sure if this is corporate policy or new mgmt trying to impress corporate.  We left here in November and are back now for our season.  This location has opened since we left and WE were exited to try out the new spot as we  love the experience most always  elsewhere.  So indeed a few more times at this location (2min walk from marina) will be in order.  Usually newly opened restaurants don't hold back on the ingredients hope this is just an off night.  Love this place usually    Fire and oak has been our go to for 10 years now.  Just saying.
Mansoor K.,"Chicago, IL",109,63,1,1.0,12/14/2015,"Server was very nice for starters . But everything else was a hot mess, a real hot mess. There's no reason why you have to wait for your full dinner experience to be two hours. This is isn't fine dining or semi fine dining for things to take that long. I was so excited for this new location to open up close to Manhattan, actually very close from 34th St. you can take the path train straight to Newport in less than 10 minutes, but it's not worth it."
Manoj G.,"New York, NY",1,9,,1.0,1/7/2016,"I live close by and when I saw a new restaurant had opened up, I thought of checking it out. I was in thew newport mall and walked by the area where the server was standing by her computer. I asked her if I could take a look at the menu, the multiple copies of which were sitting right by her. She said ""no, you have to come through the front to take a look at the menu"". Thanks but no thanks!"
Maeve K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,2,1.0,4/2/2016,I read the warnings about the bad service and disorganization but figured they would have it worked out by now - I was wrong! We were quoted a 30min wait and after an hour we had to leave and go upstairs to the food court otherwise we would have missed our movie. There were several empty tables that were still messy from there previous guests and most people there all looked the same - frustrated at either waiting for their table or waiting for their food.
Celine G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,,1.0,3/21/2016,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Waited 30 mins for appetizer, and 45 minutes for the main entree, and when our food came, the order was all wrong!! Do not waste your money here!!"
Anon A.,"Jersey City, NJ",6,4,,2.0,1/24/2016,"So, we finally went to the Cheesecake Factory after hearing all the hoopla and seeing the crazy long lines. I figured since it was the day after the big storm, it shouldn't be as bad. We waited 20 minutes for a table - not bad. Then downhill from there...The waiter was nice, but terrible. I had to ask 4 different waiters for basic things like - water, ketchup, salad dressing, cream, coffee refill 2x, strawberries 2x, cheesecake 2x. The old fashioned burger was terrible - I asked for medium well and received medium rare. The seasonings on the burger were nasty also. I couldn't even eat it. I was about to not leave a tip, but the waiter apologized for poor service saying they were understaffed. So, I left a 15% tip anyway. However, I will not be returning! People must like this place for the booze! We will stick with Johnny Rockets upstairs."
Cynthia C.,"Edgewater, NJ",114,30,98,5.0,1/2/2016,"Lauralie greeted us advised wait time would be 1 hour handed us a pager we were able to roam around until it was time. I've visited other locations Riverside and Willowbrook. This is not an uncommon wait time for a weekend around 4:30pm. This particular location is a nice addition to Newport Mall & Jersey City residents. They didn't offer to validate parking however you can go to the member service to get a discount of $1. Ambiance is ok, food is mediocre lighting is very dim inside. I went on a weekend, you can imagine the traffic. Our server Shaqueria was very attentive and visited our table often about (4 times ). I appreciated her kindness towards us as I informed her this was my first visit at this branch. She seated us comfortably in a section where it wasn't so noisy. Several managers visited our table briefly to ensure we were well taken care of. This is a high volume restaurant that will be successful. Keep smiling associates on the front line &  thank your guests for their patience and business. This is the key to having them return. I look forward to my next week day visit."
M B.,"Hudson, NJ",1,36,2,4.0,1/11/2016,Food is pretty good and the staff are very accommodating. Large portions and drinks are good. Went on a Saturday and the wait was about an hour but it was expected. You can walk around to nearby stores in the mall while waiting.
James B.,"Hoboken, NJ",241,6,,1.0,3/24/2016,"Had an early dinner there today. Waiter was frazzled and forgot to put in orders, food was cold and terrible and soda was flat....worst part... I left my wallet on the table by accident. I take full responsibility for that. I quickly realized I left it and went back to the restaurant.  The waiter claimed he found it on the ground ""kicked under a table"" and gave it in to the manager. After a few moments the waiter returns with my wallet but...All OF THE MONEY THAT WAS IN IT WAS TAKEN over 100.00!!! The manager claimed the waiter never reported the wallet to him. So he lied about that. Obviously the waiter planned to take my wallet home. When I arrived he had a change of heart (or got scared) lied and gave me the wallet back but had already taken the money. That is fucked!! I am glad I have my wallet and credit cards back but really??? I was thrilled my wallet was there and returned but the experience completely soured by the blatant lying and theft of he staff.  The manager said he would investigate it but we all know what that means. So it basically cost me 100 bucks to realize I will never return to that establishment as long as I have a mouth to eat with. I was given a gift card as an xmass gift. I used the card for the food at least. Thanks for the gift of lousy food, failed service and thievery!!! Merry xmass to me. Never go here!! The manager seemed sweet and concerned. Said he would call with news but never did. Corporate, if you read this I expect a 100 gift card on you asap which I will donate to the homeless. The host staff were extremely lovely!! Only good part"
Brianna A.,"New York, NY",17,17,1,4.0,12/28/2015,"We came to cheesecake factory on Sunday December 20th, it had been open for a week at that point. We were promptly informed there was an hour wait. We were not surprised at all so we took a pager and waited out the hour. We got the page on time and went to claim our table. However the host took my fiances name down as Cory which is far from his name, luckily my fiance heard her say cory when she first asked his name and so he remembered that the table for 2 under cory was actually for us lmao. We were seated and then our waitress greeted us promptly. I forgot our waitress name but she also has a cousin who is a waitress there as well and they look like sisters.She was sweet, attentive and funny.They did a good job building the restaurant hard to believe payhalf used to be here it is really nice. But they should have built a bigger waiting area at the host desk because it was jam packed. We had the loaded nachos, crab cakes, macaroni and cheese balls and red velvet cheesecake for dessert. The food was quite tasty but the service was excellent, I hope its not just because it is brand new because everyone was friendly accommodating and checked on us frequently great customer experience. We will be back in the next two weeks"
Melissa T.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,13,,1.0,12/27/2015,"I went with my husband and it was by far THE WORST SERVICE. We waited an hr plus to be seated, then another hour plus trying to get our orders even in!!! Then i ask the server if the order i made had pork in it. The idiot didn't know but said no. Come to find out there was and complained. Manager came over offered a free dessert and then it took forever to get the server back to take the dessert order, coming to find out that he thought it was already taken! Ridiculously annoying dinner."
John D.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,,4.0,4/3/2016,"Usually meets my expectations, good food. It is one of the few choices in the mall if you do not want fast food style eating for the moment."
Lu O.,"Newark, NJ",0,3,,1.0,12/20/2015,"Watched several people get seats before we did and asked if they did reservations and was told they did not.  Food came at least 30 minutes after everybody was done eating. Worst service, please save your money and time."
Ahmed M.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,,1.0,12/13/2015,"Slow staff Thats uneducated about their menu. I understand that its a new restaurant but that shouldn't be an excuse for crap service. Wife asked if a meal contained a certain ingredient, waiter said no. Halfway into the meal my wife is checks online and sees that the ingredient is actually part of the dish... Horrible"
