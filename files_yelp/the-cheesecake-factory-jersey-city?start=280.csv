Anthony F.,"Brooklyn, NY",70,6,,1.0,2/8/2016,This location served me raw catfish and never got a glass a water till after the incident with my dinner. The server was sweet and nice just not attentive.
Nick P.,"Morristown, NJ",0,11,,2.0,3/2/2016,Leave it up to Jersey City and the Newport Mall to screw up the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is great as they all are but the service is awful.  Been 3 times and the incompetency is consistent.
Elana G.,"Tinton Falls, NJ",1,5,,1.0,2/13/2016,"Came here last night for valentines dinner and I was very disappointed! I love the cheesecake factory which is why I chose to take my girlfriend here but this location was awful. We usually go to the one in short hills, and we never have an issue! We waited almost an hour to get a table which I understand being that it was Friday night and valentines weekend, but to wait an hour and then have a bad experience was not how I wanted to spend my valentines dinner. First the bread was hard and burnt, then we were served water without straws! My girlfriend ordered lugini pasta which she figured would be long spaghetti type noodles but it was cut up and honesty looked like a plate of cabbage..she barely ate any of it. I got the 4 cheese pasts which was delicious and cant ever complain about that. I ordered coffee and the waited forgot the milk. Speaking of the waiter (James M), Anything we asked for, he brought out one at a time, which made us wait even longer. We then asked for a slice of cheesecake to go and was brought out on a plate. Was not happy with this location at all."
Rosemarie R.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,8,2,1.0,2/6/2016,For the price of the cheesecake you would think the cheesecake would be good. Unfortunately when it opened i decided to have my husband get strawberry cheescake for me! Disappointed in so many ways! Your name is cheesecake factory and you cant even get cheesecake right. It so dry and i think 2 small strawberries then a bunch of whoop cream! I definately wont be going back!
Juan P.,"Cambridge, MA",0,1,,2.0,7/8/2016,"Disclaimer: I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. In general(although last time was ~4-5 years back). Not this one. First, food was mediocre. Bread was not warm and little stiffer than usual. Chicken in pasta was overcooked. Carbonara was tasteless. No dressing in salad. Buffalo chicken wings was the only decent dish. Second, service was atrocious. First waitress told me ""beers are $4."" ""Any of the beers here?"" ""Yes"" ""four dollars?"" ""Yes"". Later check comes and price was $7-9 dollars each. The best part was the joker manager: ""sorry for the misinformation"" ""so what are we going to do about it?"" ""Sorry can't do anything"". ""Ok whatever"". It's one of those places where you might hear ""sorry I don't know. I just work here."" Interestingly, 2 min later our second waitress brings a check that has at least some adjustment to the price (She is great. Thank you). Third, most of the negative experience due to the incompetent and arrogant service could have been avoided if Cheesecake Factory didn't try to desperately increase their same-store-sales by not bothering to show prices for the alcoholic beverages on the menu. Nice tricks guys. Not coming back - thanks."
