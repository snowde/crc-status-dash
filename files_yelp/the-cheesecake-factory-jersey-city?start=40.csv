Sakti P.,"Herndon, VA",0,2,,1.0,12/24/2017,This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have eaten . The guys who served us treated very bad . So I left him 1$ dollar tip . He was not even worth that . And he yelled in front of everyone that we left him a dollar.  Worst food and highly racist environment.
Chang W.,"Manhattan, NY",19,8,50,1.0,12/26/2016,"Honestly, it is a decent American restaurant in the neighborhood. We go there almost every week. It is not the first time we experienced the extremely long waiting for the food. But this time is the most disappointed experience. The waiter placed the wrong order for us. Before they brought the wrong food, we already have waited for 40min. When he kept telling us, it was just 5min away. Then what happened after 5min was just another 5min. He kept saying that it was someone else ordered the wrong food and overrided his order. But he couldn't explain what happened. So don't go there if you don't have enough time to wait.  P.S. Another lady sitting next to our table experienced a similar situation."
Andrew M.,"St Petersburg, FL",56,21,22,1.0,7/24/2017,"Came here with my boss and wife one night after leaving work across the street at Citi. We came here because it was close and ""reasonably priced"". Do yourself a favor - keep on walking to whatever is next. Horrible service, cold food and waiting forever. Don't really need to say more except apparently at this restaurant, attitude is commonplace."
Leonard G.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",35,112,447,3.0,9/11/2017,"The food is absolutely amazing and the portions are very large.  The Thai lettuce wraps and miso salmon are mouthwatering delicious.  Unfortunately, the service here is dreadfully slow.  We love going to all of the Cheesecake Factory's because we love the food and service is usually very good but at this particular location, something is just off.  I definitely recommend the Cheesecake Factory but not this particular location.  Of course if you love cheesecake, this place will certainly satisfy your cravings as there are about 50 available variations.  We try to eat healthy so we typically skip the dessert and also because the main course portions are so large that we are just too full to have dessert at that point."
Arpana B.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,58,51,5.0,8/26/2017,"I went there with my colleague and had chicken enchiladas. It was delicious. Nothing different though. Just like any other Mexican restaurant like Chillis. I wasn't a big fan of cheese cakes until I tried their red velvet cake Cheesecake. It was very yummy and moist. Next time, I do wanna try their Tiramisu cheesecake. They have so many different kinds of cheesecakes that I think one must differently try!!"
Krunal J.,"Journal Square, Jersey City, NJ",28,2,2,5.0,8/31/2017,Dynamite shrimp . Cant stop eating. Its delicious. Cant ask more good than this. Amazing food.
Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1605,2590,51,3.0,11/11/2016,"Still a lot of waiting around. I almost wish there was a better timer to manage it - the bread and the delays in drinks didn't help. Fried avocado/mushroom/zucchini appetizer came 20 minutes after my pasta...odd. I would've canceled it had Antonella not been so nice about it. The Pasta da Vinci is actually quite good - not nearly as salty and a very mild sauce with mushrooms and chicken balancing the penne. Better experience, though portions seem to have gotten smaller - the last time I had pasta here, it was 2x the meal."
Gourav S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,4,1,3.0,10/27/2017,Get ready to spend 1-2 hours before you get food on your table. Although food is good here but service is pathetic. Nobody will come to check if food is delayed. I waited more than 40 mins before we complained and then manager of the restaurant got us our order. No doubt food is good but come prepared to wait especially on weekends.
DeShawn A.,"Las Vegas, NV",232,202,209,2.0,6/8/2017,I don't know what the deal is with the CCF! Came here since it was located across from the hotel I was staying at thinking it was a safe bet for good food! Well food was mediocre and service was even worse! Hostess acted as we weren't standing there and I had to ask if we could get a table.....no such luck as we were forced to sit at high table in the bar area. I asked if it was okay that I had a minor in my party and I was surprised when they said yes it was fine....Our server acted as if we were bothering her by being there! She hardly checked on us and by the time it was time to pay we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for her to come and process the check! My husband literally walked around the restaurant trying to locate her so we could pay! I give 2 stars for the so/so food! Plain awful! Glad I was just visiting and don't have to subject myself to this craziness!
Michael W.,"Orlando, FL",159,180,294,3.0,11/1/2016,"Ordered to go food: Food:  I ordered chicken lettuce wrap and beet goat cheese salad.  The food was okay.  I was disappointed with the lack of avocado in my lettuce wrap (see picture).  The flavors of the salad were pretty well balanced and adequate.  The goat cheese blended well w the beets.  3/5 Service:  they took my order really quickly but the pain was in the waiting time. It has been over 32 min for a simple to go order.  It is on Tuesday night at 9:38pm when I came in and it was slow for them. This is a bit ridiculous! Manager needs to pay attention to this kind service. With such a small simple order, it should never ever take this long especially for a professional chain restaurant. 1.5/5 Atmosphere: your typical chill cheese cake factory. It is a smaller location than others.  4/5"
Annie M.,"Sacramento, CA",235,71,199,1.0,4/12/2017,"I typically love Cheesecake Factory. But this location: service was cold and standoffish. No bread or water offered. Hey, maybe he was having a bad day, I don't know. But the food was equally unsatisfying. I got a Cobb salad which came with maybe 3 heads of chopped romaine lettuce and a sliver of chicken. A SLIVER lol I've had chicken nuggets bigger than the chicken provided in this salad. I was hungry after my one sliver of chicken so finally asked for bread. The end :)"
Cheryl S.,"Dumont, NJ",53,101,22,2.0,10/16/2017,Typical Cheesecake Factory. Food was decent. I had the Mexican Tortilla Salad off the skinnylicious menu and it was huge. Very filling. Also had the lemon merengue cheesecake which was good. Would have given more stars if the service wasn't terrible.
N P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,,4.0,12/19/2017,Finger licking mouth watering great food as well as great drinks went there on a Sunday wasn't expecting it to be as crowded but it was but the wait wasn't as bad a thought... the lights are very dark for no real reason but it still was good service there's was a Variety of cheese cake to satisfy your taste buds overall a really good place to eat
John C.,"West New York, NJ",21,16,,1.0,10/20/2017,"So we decided to come here on a Saturday evening on and try this place because it was a new place for us. We had never been there and everybody talks about it , what looks to be a promising place with a dark bar like atmosphere seem to have good promise but we were extremely disappointed by the food. The service was OK , the waitress was very busy to check up on her table every so often. We did order some food,  two of my guests had burgers which came out terrible. They had to be returned and still came out wrong. No seasoning and did not know what medium term was. I had some steak dish which was just ok. Took two pieces of overpriced cheesecake home which one was good and the other had to go to the trash. I do not recommend this place to anybody especially for the price you will pay you're better off going to a burger  place maybe even the one next to them. Don't believe the hype!"
Karrie D.,"Jersey City, NJ",113,73,251,2.0,4/1/2016,"Came for brunch on a Sunday. We were promptly seated and they brought our bread right away. I ordered the chicken and waffle eggs Benedict and my mom got the brûléed French toast.  DO NOT EVER ORDER THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES FRENCH EGGS BENEDICT. The hollandaise sauce was so thick and tastes congealed. It got all over everything and just grossed me out. I barely finished my meal, and even then I was scraping that sauce off of it.  My moms French toast was good. It was very thick and sweet, but pretty decent. Overpriced for only two slices but we did enjoy it.  I wouldn't go back for brunch."
Jaritza M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,14,7,4.0,10/29/2017,"Let's start off with the waiter . Antonella S, how can I put this nicely ? She was a horrible waiter. She seemed very nice, smiled and Took our order. Then I barely saw her. I was with two kids and my boyfriend. After the kids food came she got lost. She never brought me the water I asked for, for the whole table. She never came to bring us bread. She didn't bring me the drink I ordered which was a smoothie. She comes back in what seemed like forever to me and I then had to ask her for bread because she didn't seem like she was ever going to bring it and I felt like I was starving to death. Still didn't bring me my water or my drink. Didn't come back to check if the kids food was okay or if they needed anything. The kids are almost done with their food and she STILL didn't come back with my water or bread or anything. By this point I was BEYOND frustrated and starving half to death. Another waiter by the name Yoval not sure his position but must of noticed the frustration in my face because he randomly came up to us and asked if we would want some bread. He was awesome compared to my waiter who lacked bunch of waiter skills. Then she came with my drink after she saw him helping us. Not sure if she had too many tables or if she just kept forgetting about us because she didn't even apologize the times she did happen to come back. He also came around to see if we needed refills on our drinks. She came and gave us the dessert menu and then never came back. The same gentleman kept looking at us and eventually came to see what we wanted to order. Im not going to let one sour apple ruin the tree so my waiter may have been horrible at customer service but the food was BEYONDDDDDDDD GOOD. I had the hibachi steak with mashx2 And some fried shrimp on top and it was to die for. I don't think I even stoped to breath lol my boyfriend had the chicken with steak combo with mash and Mac and cheese on the side . Which was also very good . Ultimately this place has GREAT food they probably should just coach that specific waiter on paying attention to her tables. World of advice If your going to disappear please make sure they table is good before doing so. Thank you YIVAL for acknowledging me and my family !"
Noroelma A.,"Union City, NJ",0,8,2,2.0,12/16/2017,Overpriced decent food. My dad was unhappy with the service. Overall it's ok but nothing memorable
Lea G.,"Montclair, NJ",1,30,2,1.0,3/21/2017,Ordered pick up several times from Cheesecake Factory in Jersey City. NEVER AGAIN! The food is never consistent with the way they serve it when you dine in. DO NOT order take out from this location. They overcook and burn everything. In addition to that they do not give consistent portions when you take your food to go. Pick up orders are half the portion every time. Every single time we order they mess up at least two of the dishes. Fed up with giving this place several chances.
Yikai L.,"New York, NY",91,331,504,4.0,4/13/2017,"My third Cheesecake Factory experience. Bartender was super nice and efficient. Mai Tai was good, and pineapple Mojito was lighter. Shrimp Salad was huge in portion, just like its other dishes."
Xiao F.,"Jersey City, NJ",138,9,37,4.0,7/25/2017,"Other than the fact that the wait is pretty long, all is well. After trying out most of the cheesecakes on the menu, I feel like Godiva Cheesecake has become my personal favorite."
