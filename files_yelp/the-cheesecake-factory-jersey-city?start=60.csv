Yash K.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,3,5.0,4/3/2017,"Great ambience, great hospitality !!! Amazing drinks from the bar !!! Factory Nachos and chicken parm pizza style were mouthwatering, loved it. In cheesecakes, Tiramisu was the best. I'd say great place for celebrations and weekends."
Jan B.,"Warren, NJ",75,246,323,4.0,5/7/2017,"Came in here with my mother in law.  It was first trip to this mall and this area and i must admit, i am NOT a fan of chain restaurants.  But, with the lack of parking in Jersey City these days, this was an easy option.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The place was busy and humming. We each had a cocktail and the pineapple moscow mule was quite good!  I ordered the Nashville hot chicken app and while it really was nothing like the hot chicken in Nashville, it was good.  We each had a salad, my MIL the chopped which was quite a generous portion and i had the seared tuna salad.  It was good, and not at all a large portion - just enough for lunch.  I will say that for the $19 price tag on this salad, it could have had more than 3 slices of the tuna but that would be my only complaint.   We were seated quickly, waited on promptly, with a waiter who was attentive and not distracting.  If you are shopping in the mall, its an easy spot for lunch or dinner."
Juan C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,74,12,2.0,5/22/2017,"I think it's decent, nothing special. It's a restaurant chain, with tons of options. Maybe too many options. I've never had the cheese cake but they have tons of options for them. I ate the pasta with chicken; very basic. Nice decor, the main floor looks clean, I got a glimpse of the back and I wanted to throw up, may never eat at this location ever again"
Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",202,439,2581,4.0,2/19/2016,"Great start to our visit - being told there was a 20 minute wait! Yes, il take that! My husband was flying out of Newark so we decided to have a meal at Cheesecake Factory beforehand. We were worried we wouldn't be able to fit it in, but were pleasantly surprised at the wait time, especially compared to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants that we have been to. We grabbed our drinks at the bar and soon after we were seated.  My husband had the grilled chicken tostada salad and I had the Kobe burger. The portions were huge, so we didn't make it to the cheesecake, but we really enjoyed our meals. My burger had great flavor and was really juicy and I loved the fries!! They were so good. Everything on the salad looked so colorful and fresh. We were very full and didn't even manage to finish! I'm already planning my return already!"
Jerica B.,"Longwood, Bronx, NY",0,18,94,3.0,10/31/2016,"I've never been here before but heard great things about it. So I decided to take my fiancé here for date night. The wait for two people wasn't bad about 20 minutes. The mall had seats outside the restaurant playing Christmas movies on the tv. I personally don't like how close the tables are together preferred a little more privacy. I wasn't to crazy about what I ordered the black beans had no flavor what's so ever and the ""Jamaican"" Chicken was nasty. If it's going to be Jamaican it should have a little spice in it. He ordered pasta that he really like. The red velvet cheesecake was amazing as it should be since it's there specialty. Waiter should listen more when taking an order as well as repeat it back to make sure it's what you ordered. I'm willing to give this place one more try."
Thomas Christopher Blackhawk W.,"Bayonne, NJ",79,55,53,1.0,3/8/2017,"My wife and I Wanted to get the World famous CHEESE CAKE  from the cheese cake factory I'm disabled and can't stand too long we was told, it's a ""TALK OUT ITEM ONLY"" and had to see on this  Bench, like homeless bombs !!!!!! Item"
Caroline G.,"Jersey City, NJ",61,54,10,1.0,9/15/2017,"Ever walk out of a restaurant because no one ever brought you anything? Yup...that happened. If you enjoy being frustrated, this is your spot. I love the Cheesecake Factory...every location apparently but this one."
Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,937,15249,5.0,7/31/2016,"Today, National Cheesecake Day July 30, 2016 was a four star experience. From the time we entered the restaurant we were smiled at and greeted by friendly employees. My daughter asked for a booth for two. We were seated promptly near the kitchen area. Better to be closer to the food!! We looked over the menu and made our decision. We were told out server would be with us soon. I assumed he was the server assisting a huge party of about twelve. Sure enough he came over introduced himself as Ty. So nice and knowledgeable about everything Cheesecake Factory. We were hungry and ready to order. He took our order making special note of my allergy to tomato.  In no time our food arrived looking absolutely delicious. We were chewing down and Ty gave us a check to see if we were fine. He was great with his timing and not a pest. He still kept up with that huge group that looked like they were having a ball! Our dishes were removed when we were done and Ty promptly took our desert request. Again it was no time before I had my Vanilla Bean Cheesecake that I inhaled with no problem. My daughter took her Nutella Cheesecake to go.  Only two small problems. I won't take away stars because overall it was the best experience I've had at this location.  First, my daughter didn't want whipped cream to go. She got it anyway. I couldn't get a decent photo. Her slice was a mess in the container before we left. It shouldn't change the taste. I'll get a report when she eats it.  Second, every time we've been to eat at this location we have had something flying around our food. Once it was a fly. Today it was a little bug of some kind. I really wish they would fix that problem. I don't like to share my food!! Maybe N.J. doesn't have the strict rules we have in NYC. Didn't have this issue in Wayne or Hackensack though at their Cheesecake Factory.  Still Ty especially made this a great experience. Half price Cheesecake didn't hurt either. Transportation to get there and home added big cost to our meals!!"
Ms. R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,63,14,3.0,4/2/2017,"Great Passion Fruit Mojito to celebrate my birthday! Brunch took entirely too long to come! Dirty utensils and drinking glasses. I was going to purchase 3 slices of cheesecake, but left in a hurry out of sheer disappointment"
Shonnie H.,"Manhattan, NY",570,535,2361,3.0,1/25/2016,"Not different from any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to, with the exception of seeming more disorganized. There were tables that were emptied for 20-30 minutes without having people be seated there. No wonder there was a half hour wait the day after snowpocalypse.... there weren't that many people, ya'll just weren't doing your job right. Again, the wait is EXCESSIVE.  I understand this is a fairly new establishment, but it seems like the manager has to step up his/her game. Stop making people wait longer than necessary. It's in everyone's best interest, right? I've never been to this mall before, and was appalled to find that CF was, really, the only place to go for a drink and some apps to finish off our shopping. Wait, what shopping? Most stores were closed and the stores that the Newport Centre had sucked anyway. The nachos with chicken? NAILED IT. BEST I've ever had - so I'll give ya'll a 3. Our drinks (mmmm mai tai) were delicious. I've been to the Hackensack CF the most, and that place is noticeably more organized than this place. The bathrooms were fairly clean though and service was fine. The bartender wasn't that hard to get a hold of."
Donna P.,"Jersey City, NJ",28,6,1,1.0,11/6/2017,"Worst Experience ever! What an embarrassment to my guests.  I made a reservation for 7 about 2 weeks ago, received  a conformation call about 4 days prior to us going.   On the day of... I called in to change the reservation to 6:30 from 6pm and  was told I was not in the book!. Explained I got a conformation call  how could i not be in the book...I was like ok, I  can let this pass..as long as they could seat myself and my guests. We get there and were seated in a booth clearly made for 4 people to be comfortable..we all squeezed in  and had one person sit with a chair at the end of the table.  The place wasn't super busy, I would of thought we have a comfortable place in the back ..but we dealt with it.  We ordered drinks and appetizers..appetizers came out  right away..the drinks about 20 minutes after. Then our waitress disappeared for over 10 minutes and we wanted to place our dinner orders. I had to flag another waitress to find her.  We were done with the appetizers and drinks and no one came back to the table to see if we wanted refills or more appetizers. Fast forward 45 minutes later...finally our dinner plates started showing up at the table 2 at a time. 1 person had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the Chicken & biscuits meal. At this point everyone was clearly aggravated. The manager came to our table once just to hand us our drinks from the bar..When we requested him to come to the table again he sent someone else. Long story short. 3 people had to send their dinner plates back, we barely saw our waitress  and the manager cowardly hid from us. What a way to ruin a Friday night celebration dinner."
Monica T.,"New York, NY",65,635,574,4.0,2/12/2017,"It's been a while since we went to Cheesecake Factory and we are thrilled!! This place is huge and the menu, wow, I think I need 30 minutes to fully digest what's on the menu!!! We were there around 3:30pm on a Saturday, and they serve lunch portion until 5pm. Scored!!! We ordered the fried mac and cheese appetizer (which was delicious!!!), chicken piccata (lunch portion for $12.95) and chicken and biscuit (full size). Wow that's a lot of food!!!!!!! Food was pretty good, service was great!! We skipped dessert but I know, I'll be back!!"
Steph A.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,206,199,4.0,1/7/2017,"First time in the location an I was starving after walking in the mall, (this spot is directly in the mall) Not so bad  Anyways yeah I walked in an was seated right away. I was greeted with a nice server who was from down south which you can tell she had a cute ascent. I over ordered the portions are huge, from the appetizers which where amazing I had the chicken nachos an some wings. All very very good.  Came out fast an hot I guess when I told her I was starving she new I meant it I was 8 months pregnant ready to eat anything lol My children's loves it here, there kids meals are yummy my boys had chicken tenders an frys. Sounds so boring and simple but they actually where really good.  I enjoyed my entree as well as my husband.  Now let's get down to the cheesecakes OMG so many flavors so delicious. How can one control them selfs here.  I love cheese cake  We ordered 3 cheese cake to stay an a huge cake to go not realizing how much an how big of a portion they serve. One can share with literally 3 people it's huge an very rich and creamy.  Definitely a good compliment  All so delicious. Great experience in this location."
Giselle C.,"North Bergen, NJ",54,8,,1.0,11/29/2017,"The absolute worst experience ever. Disgusting food, worst service and smells GOD awful. Ugh I hate this place. Never again!"
I J.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,6,4,5.0,6/23/2017,I was at Cheesecake Factory last week. We ordered a ribeye steak over medium it was good and juicy. Highly recommend this place for my friends!
Julia F.,"Princeville, HI",3,135,46,3.0,8/30/2017,Fine food. The food here is ok nothing that special the pasta dish was alright and we had to sit a the bar because there were no more tables. Cheesecake is good same with the service. Atmosphere is big and is nice. Recommend for informal meals that could be quick.
Laurent P.,"Jersey City, NJ",180,1,,1.0,2/13/2017,"If I could I would give this location zero stars. Just extremely slow and inattentive service. Our waitress apologized multiple times explaining that she had been busy running all over the place. It was the night before Valentines Day so you would think they'd staff accordingly.  After ordering our drinks it took about 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again to take our food order. Then it was another half hour for our food to arrive. There were 5 people in our party and 2 of the orders came incorrectly. For one, a well done steak came out very red/pink. Didn't bother asking for a new order because of how long we had already been waiting.  We also overheard the table next to us complaining to their waitress about their orders coming out wrong as well. Unfortunately we could not find a manager to vent our frustrations. At this point all I can say is good luck on Valentines Day."
Taquana J.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,6,1,3.0,8/29/2017,"I'm here as I write this. Food is good BUT this chick at the take out register is rude!! She doesn't have a name tag on but she does have on a gold name necklace, she's probably Latino or Caucasian. But she slid me my debit card when I placed it in her hand... blew spit bubbles because I wasn't sure of what I wanted. Horrible."
Sampad D.,"Reston, VA",168,723,401,2.0,5/30/2016,"Very disappointed with the service.  First, no body even asked us for water Second: Appetizers and main course was served together (that too after 30 mins) Third: Drinks were served towards the end of our meal."
Nelly F.,"Jersey City, NJ",83,8,16,4.0,4/5/2017,My bf and I were craving cheesecakes so obviously we came to the kindom of cheesecakes. Leo was attentive and gave us descriptions of some flavors he thought we would enjoy. I also got a tropical smoothie. Amazing. The cheesecakes were Oreo and Peanut butter Reese's soooo delish!  This place hit our sweet spot
