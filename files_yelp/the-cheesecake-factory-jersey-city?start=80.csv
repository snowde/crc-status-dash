Bruno P.,"Montreal, Canada",15,53,100,4.0,6/4/2016,"It was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory and obvious I thought they sell desserts only. But seriously that is only a reason to go to that place.  So many choices on the menu I couldn't make my mind, but thanks God they have ""combinations"" options. The crusted salmon with shrimp scampi was my choice and I don't regret. At all!  For dessert... Lemoncello cream torte. Jesus. The cake itself was a little bit too sweet for my taste, but the big fresh strawberries were there just to balance the sweetness and bitterness. Just as perfect as I am saying.  Thanks for this extraordinary experience I'm leaving the city tomorrow... But thinking on when I will be coming back!"
Matt R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",7,11,5,2.0,5/7/2017,"I am very disappointed of this location, as a big fan of Cheesecake factory I can say that this is the worst location I have ever visited at. First when we stepped into the restaurant we had to wait over 25 min Jut to be seated, when they finally found a table for us it was out of the restaurant where they had over 10 empty tables, I really could not figure out why they let us wait so long. The server was super slow took him a while to take our order ,I had to wait over 30 min just for a glass of water, they never checked how's the food or if we need anything. The food was standard but I honestly at this point I didn't care about the food taste. Hope they will get better"
Esmeralda C.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",108,287,2613,4.0,6/17/2016,"Was at the mall and decided to stop in and try their lunch menu.  Thankfully there was no wait time, since it was pretty early and we were able to get seated quickly.  We scanned the lunch menu, decided to have a few appetizers/small plates to share and were very happy with our choices as some of the apps were a bigger portion than others.   Overall the space is big, the décor is bright, clean and modern.  The wait staff was on point and very helpful with questions and accommodations."
John I.,"North Bergen, NJ",55,79,4,2.0,6/10/2017,"I love cheesecake factory.  This is a fake one.  The food is not the same.  Ive been to at least 4 other locations in nj and fl, over a dozen times, and this was by far the worst.  Service was ok, the food just sucked compared to the others.  What was unfortunate was we brought other people that had never eaten here, set high expectations, and we were all diapointed.  No more."
Angela F.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,9,,1.0,6/8/2017,"Walked in at 5:15pm on a Thursday. Empty restaurant except for ""work party"" at bar. Hostess asked if we (party of 2) wanted to sit at the bar with them. Why would I want to sit with them??? I asked for a table and she replied, ""Well, it will be a wait, the servers are having a meeting"".  Really??!!  Outta there, and won't be back.  First and last time."
Olisa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,96,302,5.0,11/17/2016,This is by far THE BEST CHEESECAKE FACTORY IVE EVER BEEN TOO! The food was amazing! I mean finger licking good AMAZING! Not to mention our waitress was very nice! Extremely knowledgeable on the dishes and very courteous! We ordered so many things like the firecracker salmon and the mac & cheese balls that was my favorite! I will upload all the picture so you can see greatness for yourself! This location I will definitely recommend!
Xenia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,242,468,4.0,6/4/2016,"I ordered the spaghetti carbonara with chicken. The food was okay, I'd give it 3 stars. However, the customer service was excellent. Management was able to accommodate our party of 10 with ease."
Janine C.,"Jersey City, NJ",111,36,,4.0,7/30/2017,"This restaurant is always a good choice. Got their alcoholic strawberry milkshake which was amazing!! I then got the gumbo which tasted so spicy and comforting, so good! It's not a special place but it's very good!"
Liz C.,"Jersey City, NJ",13,16,13,1.0,6/16/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR CREDIT CARD STOLEN. I left my card here after paying the bill and went back the next day to get it. Shortly after, random charges start popping up on my account even though I had the card. Someone working there clearly made a copy of my card. I further called the manager and asked him to investigate. then he never followed up or returned my call. Very sketch, avoid."
Yezenia M.,"Bayonne, NJ",2,50,4,4.0,1/1/2017,"Walked in & the hostess' had their backs to the front door. One turned around & asked how many without really even looking at us. For a table of 2 she estimated a 15 minute wait.. cool...  We went to sit at the bar. The bartender Alex had great energy the entire time. I had a Jameson & Ginger for my first round, then a pineapple mojito from their cocktail menu. Both were good..  After 25 min of waiting my friend & I decided to just eat at the bar.. we order the ari tartare and potato tots for app. I liked the tartare, but the overwhelming amount of ginger was killing it for me. I might be a drama queen because I'm just not a fan of ginger.. potato tots were fine. I didn't care for them either way.. I ordered the crispy chicken costa-something for an entree. Mashed potatoes, bomb. Asparagus, bomb. Chicken, bomb. I would come back no hesitation, & I'll probably keep to the bar. The place seemed packed and the table service seemed slow from what I saw. I'm disappointed in myself for being too full for dessert. Next time"
Briana C.,"Jersey City, NJ",147,94,261,3.0,12/3/2016,"Food was good as per usual for this restaurant chain. However hostess service was not only slow but incompetent. They gave us a buzzer for a legit two min wait. Then they brought us to two tables that were 1) occupied and 2) not yet cleaned. Before actually being able to seat us. They hostess was unapologetic and made us walk all the way back to the hostess station (past plenty of open/clean tables). When they finally sat us the floor was filthy and table was sticky. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 130 and the place was not exceptionally crowded at all. The family who eventually was seated next to us had a baby and requested a booth which they did not give them. The mom was requesting a booth and the hostess told them they would have to go back and wait again even though the booth across from us was open. Then proceeded to take 15 min to bring them a height chair. The only reason this location didn't get one star was because we had James m. as our server and he made up for the lack of customer service the rest of the team presented with. He was friendly , timely and out order came out exactly as expected. If it wasn't for him our experience would have been regretful. I would recommend checking out the situation at this place before ordering and requesting James' section for great service"
Paula M.,"Bronx, NY",195,310,172,4.0,6/3/2016,"I love the cheesecake factory! The food is always great and most of the time so is the service. I had my usual, crispy chicken costolletta, so yummy!!!! I ordered mac and cheese this time instead of the asparagus it comes with and I got charged extra, I didn't appreciate that. I wish the waitress would have told me. I usually order a different side since I don't like asparagus and have never been charged extra.  Anyways, my only other gripe is it smelled fishy or like wet socks, just a strange smell."
Brianna B.,"Manhattan, NY",56,21,2,5.0,6/12/2017,"Amazing experience here from the apps to the cheesecake. My friend got the chicken bellagio which was phenomenal, as were the cheese bites and the burger. Our server, James, was phenomenal! We will def be returning."
Christine B.,"Dunellen, NJ",31,170,408,3.0,5/20/2016,"I've been to a few locations in the past but I decided to take my parents to the newly opened Newport location for brunch last Sunday. We were seated quickly and our server was prompt to take orders and have them out to us. We tried the crab hash, creme brûlée French toast, and monte cristo. All dishes were huge portions and true to form for Cheesecake Factory. The coffee was on the weak side so you're probably better off having your own from one of the places in the mall. All in all, a nice location with nice service. I would bring my parents back again."
Patty G.,"Jersey City, NJ",507,278,417,4.0,2/11/2016,Ive heard mix reviews about this location from their initial launch to some reviews on here already. Came by a few weeks ago with some of my favorite amigos and must say we left super full and satisfied.  We had about a 10 minute wait before being seated which was a little confusing because it was 2pm on a week day and it wasn't a full restaurant. We finally sat at a booth really enjoyed that you can look right into the kitchen as they are busy preparing peoples meals. We were greeted by our waiter who seemed nice.  We orders some apps and cocktails everything came out pretty good. We waiting a while for our food but at this point we really should have just stopped at apps because we were pretty full.  Service was okay nothing majorly great about it. I would definitely come back if I was in the mood for a chain restaurant. Its nice to know that is right at the mall so you know do not have to travel to other locations.
Amanda T.,"Tenafly, NJ",2,1,,2.0,3/27/2017,"This is one of the Cheesecake Factory locations you should pass on. Had their angel hair shrimp pasta and it was literally diced tomatoes thrown into boiled pasta with some over cooked shrimp on the side. They might as well have made it on an assembly line... one where the salt person was asleep. I hope this was just a night when the main chef was out of the kitchen. If you're an avid Cheesecake Factory fan like me, go to the one in Hackensack where their pasta, steaks, and salads are delectable cohesive dishes. Or just stick with the cheesecakes since those are delicious at every location."
Desirae C.,"West New York, NJ",3,10,4,3.0,3/30/2017,Went for a birthday party and not a pleasant experience. Waitress will keep forgetting what we asked. They did not even serve plates even after we got our appetizer. Waitress was trying to do her job and pretending she is servicing us. Food was ok. Cheesecake were awesome and 3 stars for that purpose only.
P S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,6,,1.0,7/1/2017,Firstly I love CF but today we had the worst experience at this location. Usually they accommodate us always. We requested a table which had reg chairs instead of the booth with leather couches because I had a back issue so couldn't sit on the leather couch. Plus we asked for a high chair. This was clearly explained to the manager at the front desk.after making us wait for 20 min they still give us the wrong table. When we requested a reg chair they denied us. They could not accommodate us at all anywhere in the entire restaurant and we had  to leave. They did not even consider accommodating. Not to mention the crying baby.  Really bad CF!!!! Really bad service!!!!
T H.,"Hudson, NJ",4,18,,1.0,7/21/2016,"I'd been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants before and had relatively pleasant experiences, but this one was absolutely the worst...might even be the second worst experience I have ever had at a casual restaurant. Took around 20 minutes to be seated...which was not unheard of. Then it took about 20 minutes for someone to come take our orders. We weren't offered water or bread. Also the silverware was dirty and laying on the bare table (with no napkin)! Finally we place our order for the appetizer and drinks. After about a half hour, we go the drinks, but not the appetizer.  30 MORE minutes pass, and we are wondering where our appetizer (nachos and guac) is. The server (who was very nice), said they accidentally gave it to another table. We then had to wait another 10 minutes to get the appetizer. By the time we got it, our entrees had come out. We didn't even finish the appetizer.  I ordered tasteless, greasy, Chicken Piccata, which looked like something you'd get at an army base. The portions were really small (it was like chicken tenders drenched in greasy butter sauce), and the noodles were overcooked. My friend ordered enchiladas and told me the ones I made at home were better than CCFs. We decided to ask for water, and it took the server 10 more minutes to bring the water!  By this time we were annoyed and just wanted to go. We didn't even order the cheesecake because we wanted to get the hell out of there! We got the check, and they didn't even offer to comp the nachos appetizer. We paid for the meal, and decided that this would be our last time at CCF in Newport Mall."
Earle H.,"Atlanta, GA",204,168,77,4.0,7/25/2016,"Well, it has probably been about 8 years since I've dined at the Cheesecake Factory.  I generally stay away from chain restaurants but this was the most convenient food nearby and you can't really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory.  The flavor is consistent and the menu is quite extensive to satisfy your taste for just about whatever you may want on a given day. I had the Cobb Salad.  It was pretty good and for those who don't know, The Cheesecake Factory salads can normally feed 2 people easily.  A few other items were being passed around on the table like fried calamari and crab bites, both pretty good appetizers.  And who can forget about their warm bread, especially that pumpernickel loaf. Yum! The tropical-flavored house iced tea is always a welcomed refreshing treat to wash it all down.  I didn't taste the other items that my family order but all I heard was ""nom, nom, nom..."" as we all stuffed our hungry faces so that's always a good sign.  For dessert, we shared the banana cheesecake and the turtle cheesecake.  If you have ever had Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, you know that they don't play when it comes to the cheesecake in terms of the size of their menu and the flavor.   I spent many an evening at The Cheesecake Factory when they first opened and began expanding beyond Atlanta all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area.  All in all, even though I don't visit often nowadays, the Cheesecake Factory still holds a special place in my heart for nostalgia's sake if nothing else and I was happy to find that the food was still what I expected and the martini menu is still on point!"
