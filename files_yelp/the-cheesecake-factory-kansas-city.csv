Megan K.,"Kansas City, MO",0,18,,5.0,11/30/2017,"Even though the Cheesecake Factory is in the Plaza area it is pretty hard to find. It has a sign that says ""The Cheesecake Factory"". There is a very nice garden/fountain in a little courtyard. When you walk in, there is a big display case just full of cheesecakes. I like to admire them while I wait. There is a lot of seating. And that's probably a good thing. They get a lot of people at the Cheesecake Factory. As you wait you can look at the TV. It shows a slideshow of all the food and cheesecakes plus the names of all of them. Speaking of food, even for a cheesecake place they have the best food EVER. I got Skinnylicious Chicken Enchiladas and let me tell you they are to die for!! Now for the thing you have been waiting for: the cheesecakes. They are also to die for. There are so many different flavors that you can choose from. There are fruit flavors and chocolate flavors and crazy flavors and original flavors, I could go on and on. My favorite is the Reese's Peanut Putter Cup Cheesecake. If you like peanut butter, chocolate and cheesecake you will love this one! That being said, they are all good. This time though I got the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake. It was fabulously good. It has candy canes inside it too!! This place is the best. I would totally recommend going here for any meal (except breakfast)."
Eric G.,"Kansas City, MO",20,108,102,3.0,1/7/2018,"My wife and I have been coming to cheesecake factory for many new year eves. The menu is extensive and the food is pretty good but a little expensive. Service has been good every time but was disappointed this past new years. They did pass out champaign but no party favors. No biggie but that's part of why we go every year. So! If you want cheese cake, yes this is the place to go. If you want a fancy dining experience, head on over. Good selection of great tasting food and good service...yes. There will always be a place in my stomach for the cheesecake factory but it's only for cheesecake and/or new years eve celebrations. If you haven't been and want a fancy dinner...I'd recommend it."
Lauren M.,"Mission, KS",62,150,2,1.0,12/9/2017,"They don't take reservations, so our party of 10 came on a Saturday around 2:45. We knew we'd have to wait, and the hostess said an hour and fifteen to an hour an forty five. It took about an hour and fifteen. We were sat and we were close to the door and with the line out the door most of the time, the chilly air plagued us most of the meal. We froze, but were pretty hungry due to being there for a while. I liked my Romano chicken. The chicken itself was tasty, but the pasta was a bit bland. We had an amazing server that kept up with us. He was friendly and very professional. I feel I've consistently had mediocre, non-memorable experiences here. The whole time we were eating, more and more people crammed around us, causing an unpleasant atmosphere to eat in."
Patricia R.,"Kansas City, MO",184,5,1,1.0,12/20/2017,"Wow, really bad service tonight. Followed the instructions on the website for Curbside to go. Stated during the order it was for Curbside to go. Arrive at the Plaza location band cannot find designated parking, so call the restaurant to ask where they were. Were then told, uh, we don't like take food outside. Ok, go inside to pick up our order and stood, ignored for 4 minutes (yes we times it, at this point, why not?) Treated very rudely by staff once someone came over to the to go counter.  Not happy, and probably not returning."
Katie S.,"Kansas City, MO",4,1,1,5.0,1/4/2018,Every time I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory I always get something different. This last time I went (1/1/18) I tried the Chicken Bellagio. It is now my favorite dish & will definitely get it next time I go. Our server was very friendly and informative about the menu. I will definitely try to go back more!
Dina R.,"Kansas City, KS",98,90,213,4.0,4/24/2017,"Been to this location a couple of times .  I always get the Shrimp and chicken Gumbo . I believe it's a Jamaican inspired dish -  It's a little on the spicy side but nothing unbearable, it's a great first choice , depending on what you like. Portions are large so expect to have leftovers.  Overall delicious food and of course what is dinner without cheesecake. They have a Fantastic selection of cheesecake- I always get the Mango cheesecake its not too sweet So it works for me.  I've also tried there happy hour drinks - I got the Mojito and cosmopolitan (great drink selection) and presentation. Definitely recommend coming to this location"
Lauryn W.,"Lee's Summit, MO",95,103,27,3.0,8/27/2017,"I would not normally come here unless I was bribed with free cheesecake. I attended a work dinner and wondered why they had to choose this place.... it's not the worst place ever, but chains aren't my first choice for a Friday night dinner.  We waited about two hours for a table. Yeah, it was a Friday night but waiting is never fun. I really wondered why so many people lined up for this restaurant when there are so many better restaurants.  The menu has wayyy, way too much. Bad sign in my opinion. This place was insanely busy, so my first thought was, ""What is something that they cannot mess up?"" I chose the Fried Macaroni and CheeseBurger"". While this is something I would never usually order, I figured it would be delicious and fail proof. It turns out it was freaking delicious. Out of our party of ten, pretty much everyone agreed they should have ordered what I did. Everyone else complained or was dissatisfied with what they ordered. I agreed - none of their food looked good. Things were over-sauced and over-seasoned.  Our server sucked. I will never understand why people wait two hours for overpriced food with the risk of crappy service."
Simon N.,"Lee's Summit, MO",217,62,27,2.0,8/26/2017,"We came on a Friday night at 7:00pm, and waited 80 minutes (wait time was expected; not the reason for the 2-stars).  Here's all the things that were wrong: 1) There were eight people in our party and the server only brought out two bread baskets.  There should have been at least 3 or 4.   2) There were times when our server disappeared for extended periods of time.  He dropped off bread and disappeared for fifteen minutes, and we had to keep asking for bread. 3) I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costaletta, and the meat was dry.  Usually, there's a tangy cream sauce that the chicken breasts lay on top of, but there was barely any on my plate.  I didn't even bother asking for more, because our server disappeared after dropping off our food and didn't even come by to check if everything was alright until our food was halfway eaten. I've eaten at a handful of Cheesecake Factory locations across the United States, and this one was the worst.  Poor service & poor quality food--not worth the money.  Only ONE out of the EIGHT in our party enjoyed their food.  I sure am noticing poor-quality trend in mid-West chain restaurants..."
Brandon H.,"Kansas City, MO",133,100,210,5.0,8/27/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I don't know if it is their 20 page menu or the endless baskets of warm bread and butter that keep me coming back. I just know I leave this place happy almost every time. My favorite menu item is the chicken belagio. It is a huge plate of food, so my wife and I always share. It is two large pieces of breaded chicken topped with prosciutto and arugula, served on a mountain of pasta bathed in a pesto/alfredo type sauce. It's amazing. In my opinion, this specific location made it better than all the others I've been to.  I'm giving this location 5 stars for the food, service, and location. After eating at the Cheesecake Factory during my travels to California and elsewhere I almost swore off this restaurant for good. These other locations had horrible service and the effort they put into making their food was severely lacking. For example, the pasta had very little sauce on it, and it looked/tasted like it sat out for over an hour.  Of course you can't leave without getting a slice of cheesecake. We have probably tried over half of them by now. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them."
Rich B.,"Kansas City, MO",182,110,106,4.0,7/12/2017,"It seems to me that The Cheesecake Factory and consistency are synonymous. Any one of their locations I have been to around the nation has been solid. I have been to this location a handful of times and can say that I have had all great experiences. Being on the Plaza though, this location can be packed to the gills with people along with a wait that is longer than an hour on a weekend night in summer. Happy hour here is the way to go for cheap eats and great drinks. Don't forget to save room for cheesecake, though!"
Sylvia T.,"Duluth, GA",0,10,14,3.0,5/27/2017,"The presentation of the food was kinda messy but the flavors were there. What can you really expect from a large chain like this, though?  Service was mediocre, at best. The server promptly took our drink orders but brought the wrong drinks so she let us have the wrong drinks for free along with the ones we actually ordered, which would have been great had I actually liked what she brought.  The rest of the night we had to search for her. Maybe she was embarrassed but we had look for her to place our food order, get drink refills, and get the check.  Hopefully it'll be better next time."
C H.,"Overland Park, KS",6,4,,5.0,12/22/2017,"Our food was excellent today for lunch. The service was great. Want to give a special hand to our waiter, Corey R. He has been the best waiter by far at any restaurant in a long time. Attentive, anticipated what we wanted before we asked, genuine. Made lunch so enjoyable. He's a keeper. We had two kids with us and he took the effort to engage them. Everyone of the wait staff were on their game today!"
Monica M.,"White Plains, NY",43,296,287,5.0,2/22/2017,"Every time I've come to this location I have always had excellent customer service. The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant so for any occasion I come here. This time it was my boyfriend's birthday and he didn't want anything major so we came here and I informed our waiter. Our waiter brought out our cheesecake of choice with ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate. Was a really nice gesture. I love the food here, I always get the Chicken Piccata and it's always amazing. He loves getting the Cajun pasta/jambalaya. There lunch menu is a really good value too. I have such a sweet tooth so I'm still trying to try every flavor of cheesecake, about halfway there."
Meijuan L.,"Noble Square, Chicago, IL",1,3,3,5.0,5/18/2017,"I have tried New York steak and Key Lime Cheesecake, both are great! And the service is great too. We ordered for 4 people and a friend came and joined us. They helped to join 2 tables for us although we can add a chair in the 4 seats table. Personally I highly recommend. lol"
Raoul D.,"Tampa, FL",0,21,2,3.0,11/20/2017,"The food gained this place an easy 4 stars but the service knocked it down a bit. Cheesecake Factories are always a reliable good time. This trip, though, was bizarre. The guy working the host counter was a bit creepy and gave off a pedo vibe. Unkempt and stared at everyone. Our waitress was pleasant but not very smart. Her timing was also incredibly off. She interpreted ""give me a minute to look at the menu"" as ""neglect us for 20 minutes without even bringing the drinks already ordered."" When the food was finally delivered by someone else, our server decided to come up from right behind the other server before we even took a bite and ask ""how is everything tasting?"" Can we have ten seconds?  Leftovers were stuffed into a tiny box which leaked all over by the time we got home. She got us two pieces of cheesecakes to go in two separate small containers... now we have three separate (tiny) boxes in three separate smaller plastic bags. Apparently, it would take too long for her to get a bigger bag to consolidate everything, so we walked up to the cheesecake counter ourselves and got a large bag within two seconds. Great food experience spoiled by poor hiring decisions and, perhaps, inadequate employee development. Your experience may vary. Cheers!"
Dominique B.,"Gladstone, MO",85,112,76,5.0,1/11/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is decently priced and a great place to go for dinner while on The Country Club Plaza. The ambience is calming, as the lights are usually dim during dinner time. The food is flavorful, and I recommend the Louisiana Chicken Pasta. They offer a large variety of creamy cheesecakes."
Kevin A.,"Schaumburg, IL",4,1,,2.0,6/24/2017,"Hey Sandra, the Bartender... Please don't argue with the customer. YOU ARE in the wrong..."
Ronnie R.,"Lowell, AR",0,6,6,1.0,8/28/2017,"Having dinner at CFactory should be an amazing experience, we all agree! ....well tonight was not the experience expected; either with Food or Service that we received... Started with a phone in order....after being left on hold for 7 mins we decided to call into another line, of course it was answered....took our order. Started a little bumpy....should have been our first sign to go a different direction. But we wanted CF so bad..... Arrived, My wife went into the Restaurant ( while I waited in the car)....15mins later (which is @10-15 mins after we were told our dinner would be ready for pickup) my wife returns to the car not so happy...she was apparently told to wait in the ""need a table line"" for a pickup order , while our dinner sit at the counter getting cold. 5 mins later we arrive back to our Hotel ( CCPlaza)....and noticed that our $65.00 dinner was a mess ( picture included) ...it was cold...and NO cheesecake in the bag! Yep - the signature item was left out of the bag and yes we were charged the $8.... So we called again ( third time now) - spoke with Manager ( Nick), explained the incredible experience that began about an hour and 25 mins ago....and was told to return and we could have our $8 cheesecake, we of course we could we paid for it... ...after I reiterated that our dinner was an upside mess and cold he agreed to remake the $65 order( seemed obvious to me that would be a given ....was I suppose to be grateful? Thought I was the customer....guess not!  Confused...why would I make a second trip and hour and 30-45 mins from our first phone call to finally get my food (and pay the full ticket)...surely he would make the right call ( customer first)...not quite...after I stressed my continued unhappiness Nick said he would comp a slice of cheesecake...so now we're making progress - I expected the entire dinner to be com'd ( seriously two trips/ three phone calls -nearly 2hrs from my first phone call- is this too much to expect?!?). Manager Nick disagreed....slice of Cheesecake and nothing else...true story! Well my wife and I decided to eat the cold food, let the Manager take the additional profit from charging us and not giving us anything and next time eat elsewhere.... What did the customer do wrong? Doesn't a manager have the authority to remedy a horrible customer experience??  I Additionally, is CFactory leadership comfortable with an experience ending this way?  Why are loyal customers being treated like this...are profit margins at corporate stores so tight that the  customer pays more and gets less...another reason why we love eating ""local"" owned/operated...better quality food and certainly better customer service!"
Sharon M.,"Lee's Summit, MO",149,158,373,1.0,3/4/2017,"Really disappointing experience here last night. I'd called earlier in the day to verify the happy hour was 4-6. My friend & I arrived at 4:45. Seeing the downstairs bar full, we headed to the upstairs bar where I've sat before. We were told it wasn't open yet, but would be in about 30 minutes.... We went back downstairs to see if any spots had opened up yet & they hadn't. I asked the hostess what she recommended (thinking she might offer to seat us near the bar & still let us enjoy the happy hour pricing) and she offered nothing.  I asked if we just needed to go someplace else and she 'guessed so'.  The good news is we went to Plaza 3 to enjoy their happy hour and had a great experience! (Loaded house made potato chips with blue cheese & bacon $3.95, tenderloin skewers $3.95, prime rib sliders $ 5.95- many other choices very reasonably priced!)  At the end of the night we went back to The Cheesecake Factory to get a couple pieces of cheesecake to go. While there was a very large crowd of people waiting to be seated, the line for to go orders was only about 8 deep. It took OVER 30 MINUTES for us to finally get to place our order for cheesecake and then at least another 5 minutes to get our cheesecake to go. Serious management problems here with planning and execution."
Shellie A.,"Starkville, MS",0,17,18,4.0,10/17/2017,Get something new every time I go and this is the first time I could've done without the meal chosen. Matter of personal taste and confident it was not the fault of theirs at all. As always the Cheesecake is perfect. Great location and friendly service.
A D.,"Leawood, KS",22,127,47,2.0,10/28/2016,This place can be hit or miss. I have eaten here roughly 3 times. Twice take out once dinning in. This last time I ate at the bar and had a drink. I ordered the shrimp tacos and a couple of margaritas. They were good the drinks were ok. I have 2 major problems with places like this. When your drinks are $12 they should pack a punch. After 2 I was sure I would be feeling good. Nope nothing. The tacos were 4 small sized soft tacos with one piece of fish cabbage and a chipotle sauce. Rice and black beans. The beans were great rice bland and horrible. Tacos had a unique flavor with the slaw. $16. Places like this take regular meals that are normal $10-12 and jack them up and served iced up drinks. I only give into this place if I haven't eaten all day and don't know what I want but want options. The cheese cake itself I could careless about.  The times I have ordered takeout I have been asked if I want bread but get none after saying I do. So I have given up on that and didn't need it so not to mad. I only eat fish so I order the salmon the first time my potatoes were a tad salty on the second visit my green beans were burnt. Like I said for the price the food should have better quality. $20 meals but they can't cook sides properly is displeasing.
Sefika M.,"Kansas City, MO",0,1,,1.0,12/11/2017,Decided to go to this restaurant for my birthday to celebrate. After looking through the menu for 20 minutes not a single server came to my table. I was not even offered water. This is terrible service and don't expect to be coming back anytime in the future when the server was more focused on holding side conversations with others.
Matthew L.,"Gainesville, FL",512,318,475,4.0,9/24/2016,Busy and slow.  I like the Cheesecake Factory but the wait staff is very slow at this location.  Besides that hat the food is great!
B I.,"MIDDLE VLG, NY",0,145,,4.0,9/4/2017,"Came here (a part of 4) for lunch. The experience is consistent with my prior experience here. Food - 5 To start with the best, the food here is pretty good. I've only been here twice, but on both occasions me and my companions have enjoyed the food here. Portions are large and dishes are tasty. They have a tremendous variety so it's good for those that don't know what they want or if you have many different tastes in the party. However, the menu can also be overwhelming. Cheesecakes are super tasty. Drinks are good as well. I do hate that they don't put prices on both.  Service - 3 Again, both times i have been disappointed with the service. They don't take reservations so you will usually wait if you come on a busy day. Our wait wasn't long (2-5) minutes, but expect up to 60 minute wait during very busy evenings. The service is very slow (probably the kitchen and not the servers themselves). No  matter, we waited for our food for way too long. Each time the servers apologized, but that doesn't do much and seems like a common occurrence. The servers are friendly despite being very busy.   Atmosphere - 4 The decor is all over the place, but it isn't bad, it just doesn't have a very uniform theme. Outside (when it's not hot) the setting is really nice, next to the fountains. Value/Price - 3.5 While the food is tasty and portions are great the service is negative due to long waits and propensity to get things wrong. The atmosphere is relatively neutral. Prices are above my expectations, but not totally out whack with the area. I hate that they don't put prices on cheesecakes and drinks. Drinks range at around $12. Overall, i would recommend to attend, but aim for the least busy time and know that the place is priced slightly above average."
Kristen F.,"Kansas City, MO",28,456,708,4.0,1/23/2016,"We don't eat at chain restaurants very often, but so far, our experiences with this Cheesecake Factory have mostly been good. We have come here numerous times for a quick dinner on a weeknight and several times for brunch. Our service has ranged anywhere from excellent to terrible (only terrible one time though) and I really think that depends on who you get as your server. The brunch is definitely more outstanding to me than the dinners. The waffle with whipped cream, candied pecans and fresh strawberries is incredible. I could literally eat it every Sunday and never complain. The food here is very consistent and is always good. The extensive menu holds several options for everyone, which is nice."
Eric R.,"Homestead, FL",0,5,2,1.0,6/4/2017,If you want privacy with your wife make sure you ask the front desk for a booth or you will get crammed in with strangers who cough without covering their mouth
M Q.,"River Run, River Run, TX",10,29,13,3.0,11/24/2017,"Food was mediocre, disappointed in food.,service good, ambience good. I ordered the mango avocado salad with chicken was overcooked and dry."
Phatmomma P.,"Kansas City, MO",25,9,5,3.0,5/22/2017,Food was good and well seasoned but a bit over priced for the small portions they serve. My waitress didnt offer any bread not that I need it. I asked her if she could bring my child's beverage with her meal so sh wouldn't fill up on juice and she brings it before the meal anyway.... But I enjoyed the outside seating on that beautiful day.
M. O.,"Overland Park, KS",80,174,292,3.0,12/9/2016,"It's a bit of a Christmas season tradition for our family to make at least one trip to the Plaza for frolicking around under the glimmering Christmas lights and enjoying a nice, festive dinner by the windows of a nice restaurant, watching passers by as we eat. This year, we landed at Cheesecake Factory for the aforementioned meal. Yes, I know that CF on a holiday weekend is slightly ill-advised, but we had a giftcard, and with kids in tow, you just can't go wrong with their mega-menu. We thought we'd beat the rush by arriving at 4:45.  We thought, ""Oh, maybe we'll wait a few minutes, but surely we'll miss the 2-3 hour wait."" Dead wrong. Name went in at 4:45.  We were told it would be a 90 minute wait.  Ugggh.  Will the kids make it?  Should we go somewhere else?  Ehh, by the time we walk 15 minutes back to the car, drive 10-30 minutes somewhere else, undoubtedly wait a few minutes there...we might as well have stayed.  So we did. After an hour and forty minutes, I went to check up on where we were at within the line.   ""It'll be about another 25 minutes."" Double uggggghhh. Forty-five minutes later, our buzzer buzzed and we were shown to a (windowless) table by the kitchen.  But, by that time, we were ready to eat eight-day old garbage within a dirty, third-world ghetto, so it didn't really matter.  And, also, we found great ""seats"" (window sills) inside, upstairs, outside the bathrooms that we sat at for about half our wait.  The view was Plaza-Christmas-tastic! The food was as the food is at Cheesecake Factory - solid.  As it should be, the namesake dessert was F A N T A S T I C.  I can't recall the exact name, but lots of Nutella and hazelnuts were involved. Table service was just slightly under-average for Cheesecake Factory, but the dude said he had been working since open, which would have had him there well-past a normal shift.  A little goofy, but still attentive, helpful, and half-way charming...in a sleepy way. Were it not for the grossly inaccurate estimates for wait times (for which I've docked them on ""Service"" below), the overall for this location would have scored a bit better.  I'll make sure to provide an updated review next time we're in on a non-holiday weekend to give ol' CF a fair shake. Food = 4/5  Facility = 4/5 Service = 1/5 Ambiance = 2/5 Value = 3/5"
Steffie M.,"Lawrence, KS",88,9,,1.0,8/27/2017,"I called ahead of time to advise I will have a party of up to 15. The lady I started talking to did not allow me to finish and cut me off with an abrupt ""We don't do reservations"". I advised that it's not my concern, I told her she was rude and turned to speak with Jenny who was friendly and helpful. We had a few ladies trickle in late and we felt pressure about one of our tables, the manager came and started clearing the table and scooting it from us. We advised we still need the table and he stated ""We thought you were consolidating"". He was not happy and it was visible. I do not suggest a big party eat here."
Shellie W.,"Kansas City, MO",50,133,318,4.0,12/10/2016,Let me tell you this location of the Cheesecake Factory has great service! I believe that service can make or break a business.  Well this location had no problems with serving our party of 10. Even after having our waitress come back several time to take our orders & continues to have later people needing to be added to our tables the waitress didn't miss a beat.  I can really appreciate how well organized & knowledgeable of the menu she was. There were several people who asked for her opinion on what to get & they we all happy with their selections. I ordered the crab cake balls & they came out excellent.  They were served with a lemon sauce & I didn't know how that would taste with them but the waitress assured me that they were good. When is got the balls they were crunchy on the outside & moist on the inside. The flavor was well seasoned but had a little bit too much breading for my liking but I still ate them! Lol  When it was time to pay the waitress only took a few a Credit cards & bills at a time. I really appreciate that so that she doesn't get mixed up & mess up someone's charges. It takes great waitress to know what your limitations are & to work within them. I would rather wait a extra few minutes to be charged correctly then to get done faster now & have to fight about the wrong charges later.
Caitlin C.,"Pittsburg, KS",21,98,194,5.0,7/10/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is never a disappointment. I have always enjoyed whatever I choose off the menu. Today I decided to go with the greek salad small plate. It was filled with chunks of miniature cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese and olives. I loved it!"
Sanaz M.,"Wichita, KS",155,317,978,3.0,6/20/2016,"I love the Mango Key Lime cheesecake here and that is always what I order prior to my meal!  Our recent visit was an OK visit.  I enjoy the atmosphere along with the patio seating when it is a nice day.  I will say though I was not happy with the wait though.... We waited a long time to order our water and then for it to arrive and the place was not very busy.  We never got checked on when we ate desert first and then when we were done we finally were asked what we wanted for dinner.  Dinner came out in less than 10 minutes, way to fast, I was not ready for food to come out so fast and super hot on the plate so I knew it was super fresh!  We ordered a popular pasta marina dish with two large pieces of crusted chicken, amazing!  The flavors at cheesecake factory are amazing I just don't always receive the best service here from the employees."
Chloe C.,"Kansas City, MO",0,6,,2.0,7/21/2017,Went here for a to go order. Specifically asked for bread and butter. Bread and butter didn't come with. The staff was rude as well. The CF in Overland Park is much better.
Tanya D.,"Bentonville, AR",0,7,8,4.0,7/20/2017,So we love the Cheesecake Factory but this trip was just so so. Went at lunch they were not busy yet but service slow. They took away the shrimp bacon sandwich that I am so bummed about. Key lime cheesecake AMAZING!!
Kim M.,"Shawnee, KS",7,2,,2.0,12/10/2017,"Got there at 245pm to eat dinner. They won't take reservations. We had a party of 8 adults, 1 child, 1 baby. We were told 1hr 15 min to 1hr 45 min wait. They clearly don't like and can barely handle large parties and should have said so. Jack Stack last year had no problem. It took the entire 1 hr 45min (of course). The entire restaurant was packed with people standing and sitting on the steps, standing around the tables where we were eating, the entire lobby was full etc. Most likely some fire codes were being broken and definitely some safety rules for blocking safety exits. The food was ok, but barely warm and placed on a hot plate. Brought me the wrong glass of wine to top it off. Cheesecake was delish though. Do not plan a holiday gathering here or you will be disappointed. Severely mismanaged. If you can't handle large parties  just say so and we can go to another restaurant that can. Or, how about a new idea....RESERVATIONS for large parties. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
Bailey T.,"Phoenix, AZ",79,1,,1.0,12/5/2017,"My issue tonight was not with the food, my cheesecake taste wonderful as always. The service tonight was absolutely horrendous. I only ordered a piece of cheesecake to go, so I can't say anything about the dining service, although I'm sure it was less than superior due to the fact that 6 of the waiters and waitresses were huddled around the cheesecake counter talking and joking around with each other. Shoving each other, hitting each other and very obviously flirting (which was incredibly cringe worthy.) Instead of interrupting their party I decided to wait and observe,  It took a good 2 and a half minutes for anyone to notice me standing at the counter. Which I can understand on a busy night, but not when I am the only one waiting in the front area. I ordered my cheesecake, and was told ""give us a few minutes."" A few minutes? I am the only one in line and clearly see 2 giant cheesecakes (so they didn't have to make another one or anything.) After 2 minutes of watching the employees continue to talk and mess with each other, I started looking at my phone. It only took another minute for me to be rudely interrupted by the behind the counter employee yelling ""HELLO!"" to my face multiple times to get my attention, and dangling my cheesecake off her finger. I grabbed my cheesecake and abruptly left. Unbelievable service. I will not be visiting this location again."

The space is not overwhelming, but a theater type atmosphere with tons of booths and tables.  There is a spiral staircase that takes you to extra seating, and a not so handy bathroom.  The nicely dressed servers give a dressy appearance, but cheesecake is super casual, additionally reinforced once you open the novel length menu.  Page after page of delicious entrees temp you on every level.  Only the truly adventurous foodies would dare order an appetizer, as the mammoth main dishes are sized to feed two. We went for a lighter meal this evening, my son grabbed the omelet, and fixings.  Nice size meal, good flavor, but it's hard to screw up breakfast, even in a factory of cheesecakes.  I had the chicken pasta with asparagus.  The pasta and chicken were perfect, adding a light pesto, did the trick on my taste buds...try the smaller portions if you want to enjoy one of their many cheesecake offerings...none for me...I have a dairy allergy that keeps me away from those sinful treats... Go to cheesecake, if you're hungry, otherwise, be prepared to eat the same dish a couple times...LO central..."

The wait was over 30 minutes which I wouldn't have waited that long if not for her looking forward to it. The service was pretty good, can't complain. Now the food, my wife tried a Mexican corn cake chicken taco/enchilada plate that she didn't love. She said the black beans were dry flavorless, they called the tacos but by my photos, they're enchiladas. I think the chef may be a Gringo. Our God-daughter had the orange chicken which looked great and her and my wife liked it. I tried the Cajun jambalaya which was good but the the value isn't there for almost $18 (noodles, couple shrimp, chicken and spices are pretty cheap. They make a killing on that order. White chocolate chip macadamia nut cheesecake kept it from being a ""2"" overall. It's definitely only a place I'll go if I'm taking nieces, nephews etc."
Denise E.,"Kansas City, MO",2,34,37,1.0,4/14/2017,"Say no!!! Today I waited over 30 minutes for my food, my utensils were dirty with old salad pieces and my burrito had at least two pieces of hair in it! I spoke with the general manager name Jackie and she was extremely rude. She didn't seem to care that my lunch date with my sons was ruined and I had to literally beg her to offer more compensation other than a slice of cheesecake! Don't waste your money or energy here."
