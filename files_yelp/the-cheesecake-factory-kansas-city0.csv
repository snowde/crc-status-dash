Noelle M.,"San Francisco, CA",212,407,163,2.0,2/25/2008,"...... yea.... I don't know, I use to LOVE going to the Cheesecake in SF like, allll the time when I went to go shopping for the day. But now, that I've gotten older and realize that quality should go over quantity...my thought on the place have changed. For one, if you need ads in your menu...it is too big. Anyway, I came here with my GM to check out their closing, just for kicks, we got a couple of apps---which were WAY too big and I got a vodka cran. which was alright. I've been told their strawberry shortcake was TO DIE FOR, so I got that and my GM got a something cheesecakeish, hers was okay but mine sucked, seriously-not impressed. If you're with like 50 people and everyone wants something else, come here, if not don't."
