Katie H.,"Lawrence, KS",43,202,30,4.0,4/11/2016,"I have yet to come into the Cheesecake Factory and actually eat dinner -- My husband and I swung by to pick up a couple slices of cheesecake to go one night.  Unfortunately, we had to rough it and stand in the to-go line for well over 30 minutes just for those two pieces of cheesecake but lemme tell ya.. It was worth it! I can't wait to go back and have another slice of the banana creme cheesecake!! :)"
Lilyanna S.,"Olathe, KS",0,20,,2.0,9/22/2015,Food was okay. Place was clean. 2 Stars for service. Waitress decided to let our drinks stay empty for 5m at a time while she was fussing over another table. Under staffing imo. Giving too many tables. Will probably not return.
Kevin C.,"Kansas City, MO",7,164,1,4.0,7/11/2015,The food was good and decently priced. The wait was non-existent. Our waiter was professional but needed to be a little louder than the environment. The cheesecake pieces are huge but exactly as described. The downside?  The manager wearing grey on this date needs to learn to not hover over tables and be less loud communicating using his earpiece.
Whitney J.,"Kansas City, MO",23,27,2,5.0,7/25/2015,"Great place... Extremely fattening, but great, hahaha! This is a once a month or every other month affair, because once you leave here, in between the bread basket (plus butta), excellent entrees and cheesecake and coffee, you will need to let your pants out by the end of the evening. They do have a lighter menu... but let's be real... AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FO DAT! IT'S THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY MAN!!! So eat your fill and enjoy yourself. The food will not disappoint and the decor is beautiful! Every time I go I have a great waiter or waitress and enjoy my experience through and through! And chocolate lovers, it is your duty to try the Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake... CHOCOLATE OVERLOAD!!!! YEEEESSSSS!!!!"
Melissa A.,"Kansas City, MO",4,5,,2.0,4/16/2015,"I was here about a week ago and had a really tough time being satisfied when I finally walked out the door. I don't eat here often, but met some friends this week for a birthday dinner. The food was good, but the poor waiter was over-extended having several large tables at the same time. But, that wasn't why I was so disappointed. Mostly, I had a the toughest time with the host stand. I had arrived first because out of my friends that were coming, I live the closest. This normally isn't a problem because I am usually just sat at our table and allowed to wait. NOT THE CASE HERE!! When I got to the front of the mass of people in the restaurant, after mentioning that there would be six of us I was promptly told that I had to wait until at least three people from our party were present before I could be put at a table. I have never heard of this before... Really? Being willing to be patient I accept their answer and took my buzzer and sat down. Well, when it became clear that my friends were running late due to traffic and an accident on the highway, I thought maybe they would make an exception and let me sit at a table. I was wrong. Not only did I get the feeling that I didn't matter to them because I was just one person, but they continued to give tables to fit the size of our party to other people and when my friends finally arrived we still had to wait an additional half hour to be seated! So a customer that got to a ""first come first serve type restaurant"" got shoved to the side and made to wait over an hour and a half before getting a table. This ""there must be half of your party present"" idea does not make for a good customer experience. Whether you are super-busy or not, EVERY customer should be made to feel important. I'm pretty sure the next time someone asks me to come to the Cheesecake Factory on a weekend, I am going to politely decline!"
Chris G.,"Kansas City, MO",244,531,54,3.0,12/11/2013,"Sure it's a chain, but sometimes you just want some comfort food, and to know what you're going to get.  Food was decent, service was good. Sitting next to the goalkeeper of the 2013 MLS Champions, Sporting KC, was pretty cool, too!  I don't go here much, but I've spotted some sports 'stars' here on more than one occasion."
Maddie D.,"Saint Louis, MO",117,8,,1.0,9/21/2015,"I wish i could give it 0 stars. First off our buzzer never went off so eventually i went up and they were like ""oh i don't know what happened"" so we had to wait longer to get our table. Then we ordered and our waiter got literally every single one of our orders wrong. It was just a mess. They didn't even take anything off the bill. I got a soda, pizza, and slice of cheesecake. After tip, it ended up being 30 dollars, and i tipped the minimum i could. Not worth it. terrible and over priced"
Scott G.,"Kansas City, MO",75,102,14,3.0,2/23/2015,"My wife and I typically steer clear of corporate chain restaurants whenever possible, but when mom sends us a gift card to Cheesecake Factory for Valentine's Day, all sense of discretion apparently goes out the window.  Seriously!  What kind of person in their right mind would choose to go here on a Saturday night?  Well that, my friend, would be us - and about 5,000 other insane and hungry people.   When you set foot inside this Cheesecake Factory, it's a wonder that this place could ever actually be filled to capacity.  It's enormous... with 2 levels of dining space, 2 bars, and (I believe anyway) 2 separate kitchens.  But no - when we arrived shortly after 7pm we were told that it would be 1.5 hours before we would be seated.  They didn't even have any more pagers left it was so busy!  Don't people know that there are a bunch of other great restaurants on the Plaza? Instead of waiting, we decided to wander upstairs to the bar area to see if we could snag an open high-top table (first-come, first-served).  Getting upstairs proved to be an adventure as we had to climb over hordes of people who were seated on both sides of the stairway waiting for their name to be called.  When we finally reached the top, we were in luck - there was a table just getting up from their meal, so we quickly grabbed it and took a seat. Now for the actual dining experience.  Have I mentioned yet that I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory?  They have one of the most overwhelming menus that I've ever seen in my life.  I swear it's 20-something pages long, with every type of food imaginable represented.  Personally, I'd prefer them to pick one or two types of cuisine, perfect those, and get rid of the rest.  But nobody asked me, so I had a decision to make.  Not really in the mood for anything in particular, I decided to order the Cajun Chicken Pasta.  My wife ordered some type of salad.  When the food arrived, I immediately thought to myself, ""Wow... this is why the obesity rate in America continues to rise.""  My oversized plate was full of pasta, which was drenched in an oil (or butter)-based sauce and topped with 4 pieces of breaded chicken.  The taste was fabulous, but I couldn't even finish half of it, and I wasn't about to try because I knew I had to save room for the best part of the meal - the CHEESECAKE, which as always was delicious. All-in-all, our visit really wasn't all that bad.  We didn't end up having to wait for a table, our service was very good, and the food exceeded my expectations.  I just wouldn't choose to come here on a regular basis and battle the crowds when there are all sorts of other great dining options available in the area."
Ginger M.,"Joplin, MO",36,1055,759,5.0,5/31/2012,"I know a lot of people love to hate big chains like The Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not one of those people.  I've been to this location a half-dozen times over the years and have never had a bad experience.  It's usually very busy but the wait has never been as long (in my experience) as their estimate.  On my most recent visit, I wasn't super hungry so I chose the Vietnamese tacos from their small plates menu; it was less than six dollars for one of the best meals I've had all YEAR, folks.  Truly phenomenal.  I split a piece of chocolate something-or-other cheesecake with two other ladies and we still did not finish it all.  It was great, but a little too rich and the portion was ridiculously large."
Charley B.,"Kansas City, KS",113,494,227,3.0,1/15/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is open year around, but I want to begin my synopsis with a holiday time recommendation.  During the holidays when the Plaza lights are on, ask for a seat on the second level by the windows.  Your wait might be a little longer than if you regularly had to wait, but you will enjoy a fantastic view of the Plaza Lights while you enjoy your dinner or your dessert. Okay, now for main review.  Most of the menu features sandwiches, burgers, small pizzas and comfort foods.  None of the dishes are particularly mind blowing, but they are solid meals served in large portions.  You might want to ask for a to-go box.  I particularly like the artichoke and crab dip. After you've boxed up your leftovers please make sure to leave room for dessert.  The cheesecake is amazing.  It comes in plenty of flavors and my favorite is the pineapple upside down concoction. The service is pretty good, but I will say things will slow down during times when the restaurant is at its peak rush.  The restaurant will become busy and there is usually a wait, but luckily there is a nice patio where you can wait until a table opens up.  If you're out and about and looking for dinner or dessert on the Plaza, this is a good place to start."
Aimee M.,"Lancaster, PA",24,57,234,3.0,4/13/2014,I am really sad that they no longer offer Thai chicken pasta. It was always my go to dish.
Stephen H.,"Paris, France",661,2124,92,4.0,8/23/2011,"So, confession.  In a past life, before I became absolutely obsessed with food, I went to chain restaurants like Red Lobster or Olive Garden and...Cheescake Factory.  But I definitely considered Cheesecake the top of the heap.  And here's why: 1.  I've eaten at Cheesecake in 5 states and there was a consistent high standard of service and food at all five. 2.  Great selection of dishes of all kinds of varieties. 3.  Really reasonable prices. 4.  Huge portions. Have been here with friends for drinks a couple times and had - of course  - the amazing cheesecake.  This location is scenic and always busy."
Alisa C.,"Toledo, OH",141,193,358,3.0,5/30/2012,"CHEESECAKE!!! That's why I come here because the food is just ok. So I decided to get the Reese's cheesecake because I was in the mood for some peanut butter and it was just peanut butter overload! It was too heavy and rich for me and I should have just stuck to my fave, the Red Velvet cheesecake that is encrusted in white chocolate shavings. There cheesecakes are usually very light, but this Reese's one was just too much! We sat outside since it was a nice day out which I'm really glad we had this option in the Plaza. I wish more Cheesecake Factorys would do this!  Pros: -CHEESECAKE=YUMMY!!! Cons: -none really....I just don't think the food is that spectacular here so oI only come for the cheesecake Why I gave it a 3...... Come for the cheesecake and leave the food behind! Seriously people, the food is something I could make but that cheesecake is like a little slice of heaven because it is very light and rich at the same time. Definitely will be back for the cheesecake!"
Samantha A.,"Key West, FL",7,13,,5.0,5/7/2015,Will was our server and he was great! Great sense of humor and very kind. Southwest chicken sandwich was very flavorful and right amount of spice. They make their Bloody Mary mix in house and it is fabulous! Totally recommend.
Rhonda S.,"Independence, MO",787,1010,914,4.0,9/8/2011,"Sara and I were down on the plaza, and contemplating dinner. I had never been to the Cheesecake Factory, (yes, me, I HAVE never been to the famous Cheesecake factory till now) so we decided cheesecake for dinner. There was no line, we walked in, and were waited on immediately. Fantastic service.  The bathrooms are up a spiral staircase. There are gorgeous columns of stone in the dining area. The dining area has both tables, and also booth tables. There is a cake rack with most of the cheesecakes near the cash register. We were handed the menus,and the happy hour menu! My God, Kansas City, the happy hour drink prices were $5.00 for a mojihito, makes me think the actual drink prices are...what? Seems to be a pattern. We didn't order from the drink menu.  On the cheesecake menu, it lists over 30 types of cheesecake. It is in the back of the menu, which is a spiral bound menu of many pages. I took a while to read them all, and settled on a yummy piece of pineapple upside down cheesecake. I wasn't sure of the price...uh, they could add the price to the menu, it'd be kind of kind. Some of the prices are $6.95, some are 7.95. Sometimes that might make a difference,and the individual prices aren't on the menu. My cheesecake rocked my world. It really was good.  Other than the little things, I can think of 30 reasons to go back to the Cheesecake Factory. Is it worth a huge line? I'm not sure. I'd not go there when there's a huge line, but that's just me.I don't wait in line in Kansas City, I go to the next place.  It is a beautiful place to eat, with outside eating, a bar with over priced beverages, and wonderful cheesecake."
Katie I.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/18/2015,"We had a wonderful experience here! There was a large party of us coming for dessert and drinks after my friend's wedding. Kyle, our server was amazing! He gave beautiful service and the cheesecake was to die for! Thank you Kyle with your awesome beard for making our night extra special with great service!  He was on top of drinks and added in the perfect amount of humor to the night! Ask for Kyle! He's da shiiiiiiit!"
Lacey J.,"Kansas City, MO",8,16,,2.0,10/23/2014,Not a fan. Generic American food. Too many things on the menu that I feel they don't specialize in anything. I never eat here.
Lauryn D.,"Dallas, TX",129,155,71,4.0,5/9/2013,"I've been to a bunch of Cheesecake Factories in various states: NY, NJ, GA... and then I come here and i'm like ""Meh?""  Arrival and Ambience:  Like every other CF, this location is beautifully maintained. Impeccably clean, even on a rainy night. We went on a Friday evening and got immediate service. We sat at a booth by the window.  Service:  Waitress seemed really 'green'. Wasn't sure if she was new or having an off day. She didn't visit us regularly and forgot a few things. Cute, sweet lil girl though.  Food:  This is the stingiest portioned Cheesecake Factory in terms of bread. Every one that I usually visit gives you 3 loaves of bread, and this one only gives you 2 --- and they are so small in comparison to other locations. Were the grains on strike in the kitchen? I need answers.  I ordered the pizza... and it was large, fresh and delicious. Crust was on point. The heartburn was worth it.  Drank lemonade... tart and delicious as usual.  Got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake. Delicious but couldn't finish it all.  I LOVED the atmosphere though. Cheesecake is always a place where you can go and kick back with your friends in an unrushed, unhurried manner and catch up.  So I would go again, and just hope the service is a little better --- thassit!"
Daniel M.,"Crossroads, Kansas City, MO",43,60,160,4.0,1/6/2015,"This place is going to overwhelm you with food. It's going to be pretty good, more than you wanted, better than you expected, and somehow still wanting some cheesecake afterward. God bless the heroes who can eat all their eyes desire at this place."
Michelle G.,"Kansas City, MO",17,2,1,3.0,2/28/2016,"My husband and I decided that this year we would celebrate our anniversary at Cheesecake Factory. When we woke up my husband called to try and make arrest stood to find that unfortunately they don't take reservations, which was fine, however whoever answered the phone was very rude about it. We still decided to go cause my husband had never been. When we got there you could tell the hostess wanted to go home and was a little agitated and actually had an argument with one of the servers at the stand right by the main door. Just so happened that the server she was fighting with was our server when we sat down. Our food was great we had two different appetizers cause we couldn't decide on just one. Our meal got there and it was fanatic however halfway through our meal the hostess came around the corner and was talking to one of the busboys rather loud saying she wanted to go home and was ready to locked the doors. I looked and my phone cause I though we couldn't have been there that long I knew that we had gotten there late about 8:00 but there was no way we had been there for three hours. Overall the food was great and our server who I saw get chewed out at the front was fairly good. I just could not believe the way the hostess was acting. I understand wanting to go home but there is no reason to go through the restaurant like that.  If it hadnt been for the hostess I would have given the restaurant a 4 star."
