Stacy B.,"Overland Park, KS",0,4,,1.0,3/30/2016,Went for my daughters Birthday with a large party and the waiter disappeared during dinner and finally someone came around and said he had to leave because of an Emergency but we saw him arguing with the GM at the front. The service from there was terrible. We never got asked if we needed another drink or anything. The GM basically stood at the end of the table waiting for us to leave so he could turn the table. The General Manager had no clue what he was doing. Food was horrible and not fresh. Will not go there if I want to spend money on a nice meal.
Stacey S.,"Dallas, TX",1,61,1,5.0,3/19/2015,I eat here all the time!! It has a great happy hour with happy hour drinks and apps! The waiters are always great and attentive. My favorite is Adam at the bar downstairs! He is great!! The managers are always nice as well. They help out their staff and everyone seems to enjoy their job!  The menu is extensive. You will always find something you like here! And they have a great cocktail list!
Victoria H.,"Kansas City, MO",60,21,17,4.0,8/4/2014,"Came here for dinner before my appointment at Apple Store. We sat at the bar and was greeted by the bartender. I could not understand a single thing he said to us. It's not a language barrier that we encountered, it was his mouth full of marbles that prevented us from understanding him. With that being said, every time he talked to us, we just agreed out of sheer embarrassment or just stupidity. Lol. Other than that the food was awesome and picked up the S'mores cheesecake, which is AAAMMMAAAZZINNNGG!  It must be Gods food!"
Jessica G.,"Topeka, KS",0,2,,2.0,10/29/2014,"First off, the food was great. I wish I could say the same for the service, but I can't. Our waiter was too ""preoccupied"" staring at the woman next to us. Im guessing that she was his friend, but I thought it was supposed to be customers first? Anyway, while he kept talking to her, we saw our cheese cakes sitting on the counter ready to be served, and which they sat there a little too long. To round it all up, in the end while he was still preoccupied, he messed up our bills and gave us the wrong change. I think all of this could've been avoided if our waiter would of just done his job right, and saved the friend visiting for after work."
Amy R.,"Kansas City, MO",145,241,1,4.0,10/19/2013,"I have no idea why I don't go here more often.  The menu is HUGE, staff is friendly, food is good to great. They ALWAYS have tables because it is seriously huge inside. We went for brunch and I had the Monte Christo sandwich which was lovely.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their food and the bonus was that we were sitting out by the fountain, it was gorgeous out and Plaza Art Fair weekend so the people watching couldn't be beat!"
Josh P.,"Horton, KS",26,7,1,5.0,2/21/2015,"I must say it was truly amazing! Of course The Cheesecake Factory is known for its deserts, but unfortunately we didn't get a desert. We still let ourselves go with a delicious appetizer as well as a Stake Diane and a Hibachi Steak! Despite the waiting time it was still worth it in the end! 5/5 would do again"
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,12/15/2010,"The wait was 1.5 hours. We opted to take the food to go and eat it elsewhere. It took 15 minutes for my food to be ready as carry out. I definitely recommend taking this route if you are craving Cheesecake factory food! I ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Its my GO-TO dish for Cheesecake factory. I love this stuff! So what if it was voted the worst food in America 2010?!?! Cheesecake Factory's Bistro Shrimp Pasta 2,730 calories 78 g saturated fat 919 mg sodium 141 g carbohydrates Service was good and fast. Me likes!"
Klent H.,"Wichita, KS",43,67,15,2.0,11/20/2012,When in Kansas City I always try to make a stop at the Cheese Cake Factory on the Plaza. This trip was no different with the exception that Sunday brunch was the only time I had available. Expectations were high but I must say I was let down. I arrived with my party at 11:00 and we ordered Bloody Mary's and examined the menu. There were only aout 8 other people in the restaurant but we noticed right away our server seemed distracted and was absent a great deal. She took our orders but the drinks too 15 minuets to arrive and later she brought water and some bread. We kept looking but it appeared she was busy elsewhere.  Our orders took nearly 40 minuets to arrive and the Mexican egg dish I ordered was cold and did not have much flavor. Our server never asked if we wanted another round of drinks and finally brought out our checks. Since we were a group of 6 an 18% gratuity was automatically added which did not set well with our group based on the service we had received.  Everyone in our group was disappointed. It could have just been an off day for the restaurant  crew but  overall  this was not a very satisfactory brunch. We will be back the next time we are in KC but with some apprehension.
Patrick Y.,"Lakewood, WA",24,54,23,4.0,1/25/2015,Food is delicious. Service was prompt and very acoomodating. The lunch portion is very generous and I can only imagine how big the dinner portions are.... and of course there are plenty of cheesecakes to choose from. If you're a coffee lover. . I recommend the tiramisu. We had the Banana cream and oreo cheesecake tonight and it was exquisite. I think the crowds are usually a little slow on Sundays between 2-5 ( which I believe are the best times to visit if you want to avoid the standard 30-40 minute waits for a table). Will return.
Zach A.,"Kansas City, MO",0,18,,4.0,3/18/2015,"I've been here with family and friends and have yet to be disappointing. The other night, my friends and I went there for late night cheesecake, and even though it was getting late, the waiters were as friendly and accommodating as ever. The cheesecake was sublime and he even rounded down our checks! The reason for the 4 stars and not 5? The price. Delicious food, decadent cheesecake, but a little pricey. But great in every other aspect!"
Rainbow C.,"Orange County, CA",12,134,6,3.0,8/6/2013,"Food (aka appetizers): 1) Avocado Egg Rolls:  Generous amounts of avocado, tomato, onion, with a dash of cilantro in a fried crisp wrapper.  Quite delicious and paired nicely with the tamarind-cashew dipping sauce.   2) Fried Avocado, Mushrooms, and Zucchini: paired with a ranch and another slightly spicy dipping sauce.  Fried avocado was ok, but the fried zucchini was quite good 3) Tropical Fruit Smoothie: fresh mango, passion fruit, pineapple, and coconut blended and topped with a strawberry and pineapple slice.  Refreshing, not too thick.   Ambiance: Nice restaurant, great location near the plaza, but the service was incredibly slow.  Maybe I'm comparing to quick LA style service, but it took FOREVER!   Bottom Line: A-OK.  Would probably dine elsewhere if I ever came back to KC.  Good vegetarian options, though."
Austin S.,"Springfield, MO",10,8,3,4.0,6/25/2014,"We have always had good food and good service here , that said,sometimes you feel somewhat close to other tables and it is a little on the noisy side. The menu is comprehensive and if you can't find a cheesecake you like out of THAT selection there is no hope for you!"
Jonny K.,"Grandview, MO",113,35,1,2.0,1/10/2016,"This place gets worse every time I dine here. The first couple times I enjoyed it alright, but the last two times were unbearable. The place is mostly popular with teenagers and tends to be very loud. The menu has so many options that it really shouldn't be surprising that the food tastes like it was hastily thrown together without much attention to taste or detail. I tried the avocado egg rolls and enjoyed them once before, but the last time I tried them they made my friends and I very sick. For dessert during my last visit, I asked the server to recommend the least rich/sweet cheesecake, as I wanted something mild, and he recommended some sort of apple cobbler nonsense that ended up being the most overpoweringly sweet thing I had ever tried there. I tried to make a complaint but it was over 30 minutes before he came back. At this point, we were both out of water, very thirsty, and ready to leave. My date was ready to just walk out, but I managed to get the attention of another server who was kind enough to go find our own. It was about another 10-15 minutes before we finally had our check, and of course it took him another 10 minutes to run my card. We both ended up being very late for our plans and very disappointed in our meals."
Andy W.,"Wichita, KS",0,1,1,5.0,11/5/2015,"Utter perfection! From the steak Diane to the always yummy mashed potatoes, you can't go wrong. And they will serve you cheesecake!"
Bill N.,"Hollywood, FL",26,44,77,4.0,8/18/2014,Went on Friday of last week again and enjoyed the service and the quality of food is just that quality!
Angela K.,"Kansas City, MO",161,221,37,4.0,1/17/2012,"Depending on when you show up here, it could either be a nightmare to get in or a breeze.  When they first opened...back in the roaring 90s...this was a frequent gathering spot after work.  And it was ALWAYS packed. My last visit was this weekend and we were seated right away by an overly friendly host.  Having not been here in a while, I was surprised at how empty the place was on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  But I'm not gonna complain about getting seated quickly. The menu, as always, was a novel.  I had a hard time narrowing down my choices.  They have a new ""Skinnylicious"" menu with low-cal options that looked delicious.  Especially the Lettuce Mushroom Wraps.  I was tempted to try the veggie burger, but opted for the comfort of the Four Cheese Pasta.  I was happy that they offered most of their dishes in lunch portions, knowing the gargantuan size of their normal dinner dishes.   The pasta was right on the money.  Tender penne pasta with a creamy tomato sauce.  Just what my belly was looking for.   Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  All in all it was an extremely nice lunch on the Plaza.  And it reminded me how much I really like this place. My visit reminded me how much I love their brunches on Sunday, so I'm definitely going to remember to come here.  The Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes look divine!"
Mari M.,"Kansas City, MO",95,115,19,3.0,9/12/2012,"We came here for a co-worker's birthday and told them that we needed to be timely with our return to the office. The server was good about being conscientious about the timing. Good job! Since the last time I have been here (who knows how many years??) they have added more items that are smaller sized or lower in calories. That's good but the sheer number of items on the menu is overwhelming. Typical, I chose poorly. I saw a chopped salad that was smaller and lower in calories and it had blue cheese. Sold. It was very flavor-less. Boo. The other people all seemed to really enjoy their choices. No cheesecake was consumed on this visit. Overall, our service was good and, for the most part, our group enjoyed their food. I would say this is a decent place to visit if you have a diverse group that cannot decide on one option. Just don't order the boring little chopped salad."
Nicole B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",151,173,,4.0,12/16/2011,"Yes, it's a chain, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I love Cheesecake Factory.  It never disappoints!  The portions are huge and it's reasonably priced.  This location in particular has a great outdoor dining area.  Cheesecake Factory also offers a great cocktail menu....martinis, mojitos, etc. My favorite things to eat at Cheesecake Factory: The Whole Grain Bread!! Luau Salad Thai Lettuce Wraps Crispy Chicken Costoletta Brownie Sundae Cheesecake (which I usually take home since I never have room)"
Kelly T.,"Grandview, MO",0,4,,2.0,10/14/2015,"Really long wait to get seated, and a really long wait to get served.. Food was okay. Appetizers were better than the entrées. We asked the server for a more plain cheesecake that would be less sweet and he recommended one with apple streusel- sweetest cheesecake I've ever tasted. Took a few bites and left the rest. Kept having to ask people to find our server. Waited almost twenty minutes just for the check. Wouldn't recommend it."
Molly K.,"Kansas City, MO",12,44,,3.0,12/5/2013,"Cheesecake Factory   I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory in the past and I have always had mixed feelings about the food. I often get the orange chicken lunch size, but once I got it dinner style. Well, I was astonished. They were both about the same size, yet you should be getting more for the dinner size. Second, I wish there had been less chicken and rice and more veggies. There were some veggies, but not as much as was needed to call it a side. The chicken was very high in calories and the chicken had too much batter on it. I was literally taking huge bites of batter when it should have been chicken. The Cheesecake Factory advertises it as Orange chicken, but when I was eating the chicken I could not taste the citrusy taste that comes with oranges. Their cheesecakes though are delicious and creamy. . The Cheesecake Factory has been criticized in the past by many people and even in books about the portion sizes and the portions are indeed huge.  But, that shouldn't surprise anyone!"
