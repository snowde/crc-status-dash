Crystal C.,"Lathrop, MO",86,156,33,5.0,4/7/2014,"This being our first visit here I'm almost opposed to give it 5 stars because I try & go at least twice before giving such an outstanding rating. We had such a good experience I could not resist!!  Our waiter was very nice & warming as soon as we sat down.. we had our toddler with us and went from a booster to a high chair and he was more than willing to help us get comfortable.  We started off with some cocktails, apple juice & cherry coke.  Nothing fancy.  Then came our appetizer which was ordered the spicy chicken nachos.  Fresh guac, sour cream, pica de gallo  atop the enormous tray of cheesy nachos.  They were really good and almost filled us up.  Not to mention they serve you warm french & this oat bran bread at the beginning with your drinks.  Then came our appetizers... I went with the spicy Louisiana chicken pasta & my husband ordered the chicken & biscuits.  OH MY GOSH!  No words can describe my pasta, the sauce absolutely perfect & spicy, creamy!  Went perfect with the honey glazed chicken, peas, asparagus, and penne pasta.  Best pasta I've ever eaten!!!  My husbands dish was equally simple yet divine in taste!  The sauce they used on the chicken and biscuits was to die for!  Our toddler LOVED both.  He absolutely loves spicy so he favored my dish! :)   We couldn't resist to try the mouth watering cheesecake that we had seen in a display case when awaiting our table.  There's so many to choose from & it's hard to decipher which you want.  So we went with the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake (at the table for dessert to share)................................ need I say more?  The name explains it all and it was drizzled in caramel sauce with homemade whip topping!  Best cheesecake ever!  We ordered the carrot cheesecake to GO--- nothing short of amazing & indulging as well.   Our first trip here was great!  We many laughs, our serves were fabulous, the food was even better, drinks were the right price for consistency of the drink.  We left VERY happy & very full.  Our toddler didn't even make it out of the parking garage without falling asleep.  Great evening.  I must say the decor of the place is outstanding as well.   We will be returning very shortly & recommending to all of our friends and family!  Thank you Cheesecake Factory for an extradoniary evening!"
Melanie G.,"Lee's Summit, MO",0,5,,3.0,8/28/2015,cheesecake is really the only thing I go there for anymore. Nothing really sounds appetizing on the menu for the price you are paying.  The food is not as tasty as people make it out to be. I ordered the shrimp alfredo and there was NO taste in it. I ate two bites and was ready for the cake part of the dinner.
Amanda F.,"Republic, MO",1,12,1,5.0,7/29/2014,Delicious!! This was well worth the wait! It was very busy but the whole staff was very nice and helpful. We will be going back next time we are in Kansas City!
Shelley Y.,"Kansas City, MO",90,276,244,4.0,7/8/2011,"Who hasn't been to the Cheesecake Factory by now? Until this afternoon it was ME, that's who! I know it's been there for what seems like forever but I've never been. I went this afternoon with the intention of coffee and conversation. I ended up ordering two small plates (which I couldn't finish), cheese cake, AND coffee. Honestly, when you compare my order to the vastness of the menu, it's measly. I didn't even read through it all it was so large! I did make a note that they offered lunch until 5pm. Who does that?!  Some of the items are pricey, but the small plates were tempting and on the cheap. I got a Greek Salad. It wasn't very Greek in my opinion. There was so much chopped cucumber and tomatoes I didn't even notice the arugula. It was positively swimming in vinaigrette too. I don't like an over-dressed salad. The worst error of all was that it had goat cheese instead of feta. I adore feta. I detest goat cheese.  I also ordered the Vietnamese Tacos. The order came with 3 and I had to pawn one off on my friend because the steamed bun was so filling I could not eat all 3 and also eat cheesecake. They were absolutely delicious!! I would order them again in a heartbeat.  Finally the cheesecake: I ordered the Godiva chocolate which was a chocolate lovers dream. I ate half of it, which is a normal portion, I'm sure. The coffee was just as my friend expected. It was a little too strong with a bitter aftertaste. Loads of cream and two Splenda's made it drinkable to me. I had one and a half cups.  Our waiter was friendly and appeared at just the right moments. The bathroom was clean, but lacked hooks to hang your purse in at least one stall. Boo to that! I have no idea if I will ever find myself back at The Cheesecake Factory, as my Hubby doesn't like cheesecake and for the price we would choose a different place. If invited by friends, I would happily return however poor the coffee."
Michael E.,"Junction City, OR",1,2,,5.0,5/15/2015,"The service was amazing from the start, the food was amazing, and we had the Oreo dream cheesecake  a very good choice. Seating arrangements could be better, but overall for the stuff that mattered it was great! This thing at the bottom says ""keep those thumbs rolling, you wizard of words."" That's where I draw the line. Good job Cheesecake Factory."
Jen K.,"Kansas City, MO",33,5,17,3.0,8/13/2012,"Enjoy coming to the CF and have been many times. Decided to try brunch and was extremely disappointed. I ordered a basic omelette that came with three cheeses and lots of veggies. The omelette was thick, hockey-puck like and perfectly round, texture of a sponge. Avocados didn't make it on the plate, the three SLICES of cheese were still hard, unmelted and extremely oily. Mushrooms were burnt.  Wastress spoke so fast that we had to have her repeat everything. Not a good visit this time."
Kenna B.,"West Des Moines, IA",47,117,80,4.0,12/25/2011,"I love the cheesecake!  Love it! Some of my past experiences have been less than stellar.  The wait staff disappears, the food takes forever, there is a 2 hour wait, and the worst strike: I'm not in love with any of their menu items (but the mandarine orange chicken dish is YUM).  However, my last visit was for dessert only, and I was extremely pleased. It was about 10:40 pm when my friend and I wandered in for dessert (and to kill some time before the midnight premiere of the Sherlock Holmes movie).  A long island was ordered (perfectly mixed and in a large glass!), along with a Carmel Macadamia Cheesecake (our waitress' favorite) and their Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake (death by chocolate, anyone?).  The desserts were amazing, the drinks wonderful, and the service excellent. Even though it was just a few minutes before closing, the waitress didn't rush us at all.  At 11:15 (15 minutes after closing time), she told us to take our time and enjoy ourselves. I noticed that they had several new low calorie options on their menu, and had changed some of their entrees.  I'm hopeful that I can find some ""real food"" that will steal my heart in future visits."
Sara B.,"Kansas City, MO",0,14,,4.0,5/24/2015,"We love coming here, the only critique I'd have is the food is a little pricey for what it is. The cheesecake is to die for though/!!"
Tina M.,"Kansas City, MO",0,7,1,4.0,7/21/2011,"I love this place! My fav is the turkey burger w/black beans. I can somewhat stay on my diet and still get a slice of cheesecake low carb with splenda! Who wouldn't love that! The atmosphere is awesome on the Plaza, def. a must see! Not so great is the beggers that stand right outside waiting to ask you for change as you come out of the restaurant.:("
Ali C.,"Harrisonville, MO",7,65,3,3.0,2/1/2014,"I prefer the Overland Park location. The plaza location is busy 24/7. Definitely not their fault, but with lots of customers comes not as great of service. I also have not been impressed with my food the past couple of times I have been here. It's just been mediocre overall."
Ashley N.,"Kansas City, MO",22,34,1,1.0,8/13/2013,Had a drink which as great and crab dip. Me no likey. I tried my best to eat it. After hating Chicago's Cheesecake Factory and now this one I'm done with this place in any city.
Christyn K.,"Kansas City, MO",259,481,234,4.0,1/8/2011,"So the wait for a table can be a little long, the parking can be a bit down the street, and the menu can be overwhelming, but I  must say that these are all things I LOVE about this Cheesecake Factory - I feel like I am at an event of sorts in a downtown escapade of class and super indulgent food. Even if I am in Kansas City : ) I don't know why people have to hate on ""chain"" places - in the past month, I have gone out of my way to try local favorites, mostly out of an obligatory feel that I should support, ya know, ""local."" After each disappointing experience (and they have ALL been disappointing, I hate to say), I say to my pals: ""You know, for that much money, I could have eaten twice as much at CKF and been four times as satisfied with the food!""  That said, this place is an anchor in the Plaza as it welcomes you while you drive down Emmanuel Clever and past that beautiful KC fountain. It is especially beautiful around Christmas-time when the whole Plaza is lit up, ready to entertain you (and your money!). The facility is quite unique in its two-story layout (bathrooms are upstairs - there is also an elevator), always very clean, and of course boasts a little cheesecake display at the entrance where all your sweet tooth needs are indulged. Who cares if the cheesecakes aren't made there - they are heavenly!"
Troy D.,"Kansas City, MO",230,229,113,3.0,6/26/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a place I'll go to once or twice a year, more often than not, just for dessert. The food is pretty good -- the chain is famous for big portions, and that's what you get.  But, unless you choose to eat your meal really early or really late.... you'll have to deal with the crowd.  And there's always a crowd.  The restaurant is big, but it still always seems like there's a ridiculously long wait.  There's nothing that can really be done about it -- it's the nature of the beast -- but it's it's just obnoxious. As for the cheesecake, when it's good - it's great.  When it's not... it's not.  I've been blown away by the 30th anniversary cake and the Godiva cake -- yet extremely disappointed by the tiramisu cake and the chocolate chip cookie dough cake. There are plenty of dining options on the Plaza, and unless you're lucky enough to get in at a time when there's no wait, I just can't see the place as worth waiting for."
Nathaniel H.,"Springfield, MO",4,38,12,5.0,7/21/2013,"I was very happy with my experience. It was my second trip to this specific Cheesecake Factory and both times I was highly satisfied. I ate at the bar and the bartender was on top of things. Not once did I have to ask for a refill. The food was also great, as usual."
Kelsey C.,"Olathe, KS",269,534,224,3.0,11/20/2008,"This place is okay, the last few times that i have been here, I haven't really liked it. The food is kind of over-priced for the quality of it (but the portions are HUGE). I haven't tried anything that I have especially liked. I think at first, I came here (and most other people did) was because well, it's the Cheesecake Factory! You have to go! Everyone's gone! But really, I think that The Cheesecake Factory is over-rated in all areas except for their namesake- the cheesecake. But then again, how can you go wrong with cheesecake? I've never really had a 'bad' tasting piece of cheesecake. Sure, the inside and outside, but usually the wait staff is lousy and the food is sub-par."
Valetta M.,"Webb City, MO",88,350,253,4.0,12/26/2012,Looked great but unfortunately we were there about 8:00pm on a Sat night & the wait was 3.5 hrs. Didn't stay.
Erica P.,"Kansas City, KS",4,31,4,4.0,7/16/2013,"I always enjoy Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistent, but that's to be expected from a major chain. Service is always good. Can't really complain about the Factory. Their happy hour is AWESOME!!"
Kyle F.,"Germantown, MD",3,164,28,4.0,6/4/2011,"This place is always packed so show up early or be prepared to wait.  When you are finally seated, the service is quick and the food is excellent.  It can be a bit pricey but well worth the money. Make sure you save room for desert, they have a separate menu dedicated to cheese cakes.  Or do what I do, order the cheese cake first :)  Highly recommended if you're downtown and want a decent meal and desert (or in my case, desert then meal)."
A B.,"Kansas City, MO",0,1,,2.0,3/10/2015,"I was recently here on a Sunday. I would have to say that i was not very satisfied. When i first sat down the table was very dirty, i had to wait 7 minutes before the waiter came to get our drink order. Once he brought our drinks there was a huge piece of bubble gum wrapper floating in my drink. The manager offered to pay for one entree. I wont return."
Ashley C.,"Lee's Summit, MO",3,20,2,3.0,6/6/2013,"First I will tell the reason it got three stars: The food quality and taste are phenomenal!! That alone got three stars. Unfortunately, there is one big reason I probably won't be going back of my own volition: Prices and portions. I had not been to the factory in many years remembering that the meal portions were gargantuan and the food often over-cooked (especially chicken). I went as part of a bachelorette party.  First, they refused to take a reservation, even for a group as large as us, so we had to sit and wait for nearly two hours outside in the rain, because they do not have an indoor waiting area. Then, being on a bit of a budget and remembering those enormous portion sizes, I went for the small plates. The waitress confirmed that two small plates was perfect for a meal. Wrong! These were not small plates. They were baby plates! I had the ahi tare tare and the mushroom/zucchini/avocado fries. Those put together would equal a standard appetizer in your typical restaurant. No where near a full meal. Nonetheless, I had spent all I had allotted for my meal so I ordered cheesecake. I didn't have a menu in front of me to know that it was nearly $10 for one slice!!! I could understand that if they made it all fresh in house, but they don't! Then add to it the fact that my ""skinny"" margarita (150 calories or less) cost as much as the cheesecake! I could have bought two standard margaritas at the bar we would be heading two for the same price (still in down town KC). Then it came time for the bills. Several from our party asked to take pieces of the brides check. The waitress fumbled orally for a minute then just announced that she would figure it out and left, declaring she was smart enough. Well, that wasn't entirely true. I ended up with part of the bride's faire, and everyone else declared their checks correct and handed over their money before I even figured out why mine was so ding dong expensive. I ended up paying for a $12 dollar drink I didn't even get to taste (most expensive thing on my bill) and have gratuity included already. All in all, the food is fantastic, but you better be willing to empty your bank account if you do anything but nibble at this place. Thank God I got to bring my cheesecake home cuz with the amount of money I dropped there, I should have had a whole meal waiting for me in the fridge! Great food. Horribly overpriced for the portions I received."
