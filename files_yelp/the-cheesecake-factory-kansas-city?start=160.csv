Nikki H.,"Kansas City, KS",0,14,,5.0,12/14/2014,"The service, Erica at the bar, the cheesecake(Dulce De Leche Caramel) and drinks were great!"
Zach J.,"Columbia, MO",3,21,2,5.0,7/7/2013,Cheesecake is to die for! We only come here for the cheesecake and we drive 2.5 hours from our hometown to come here jus for it
J C.,"Lincoln, NE",0,328,,3.0,7/8/2014,"Great cheese cake with huge variety.  Menu still big but not as big as I remember cheesecake factories used to be , but have not been many years since I've been to one.  We ended up here cause the kids always wanted to go and if they have been to one they didn't remember it and this one has a great patio and the weather was perfect for it."
Chase G.,"Wichita, KS",24,21,1,3.0,6/27/2012,"If you are going to the Cheesecake Factory, just get the cheese cake. The food was ok but not worth the money. However, the cheesecake was awesome! So I would recommend going to diner somewhere else and then going to The Cheesecake Factory for dessert!"
Mick B.,"Manhattan, NY",919,221,494,2.0,3/29/2012,"Mmmm, I'll have a plate of uninspired food with a side of annoying waiter who will be ""taking care of me."" High school prom photos out front, anyone?"
Sara B.,"Kansas City, MO",0,19,,4.0,3/17/2014,"The food here is hit or miss.  Stay away from the pizza and pasta.  They overcook the pasta, and the pizza tastes like it came straight out of a tostino's box.  There are much better places on the Plaza for Italian.  The good food here is the bar-type food:  burgers, chicken, fish, anything tex-mex.  Never had a bad appetizer here, and the salads were actually fresh with an interesting combination of flavors (my favorites are the Santa Fe salad and the BBQ ranch chicken salad).  The drinks at the bar are so tasty, I have come here just for cocktails.  As for the cheesecake..I am not really a cheesecake person, but my daughter is crazy about the strawberry cheesecake.  Service is consistently good.  Try to eat on the patio if the weather's nice..the inside can get crowded and noisy."
Hunter R.,"Seattle, WA",430,160,79,1.0,3/14/2010,"I've long been a fan of cheese cake, though have always suspected that you could not expect to get good cheese cake from any place calling itself the cheesecake factory.  The name alone implies what I've come to unfortunately learn is true, the food is as bland as if processed in a factory line.   Incredibly overpriced for the quality and level of hospitable service, I was unimpressed and will never return to one of my own free will.  Cheesecake factory seems very much like the McDonalds of deserts. Their presentation and taste are lacking in inspiration."
Sherri T.,"Lee's Summit, MO",24,15,,1.0,11/30/2013,"We went to your restaurant on the Plaza, which is our annual tradition, and were told that there was an hour and a half wait.  This was 4:15 pm.  We put our name on the list.  We sat and waited for our turn.  We were a party of nine.  We watched many small and large parties come and go while we waited.  At 5:45 pm we were told that it would be another 30 minutes.  We waited that 30 minutes and were told that it would be another 45 minutes.  When we complained we were told that it was our fault because we asked to be taken off of the list.  It was not true.  They said that we would be added to the bottom of the list again.  We were finally seated at 6:30 pm. after many words were exchanged with your rude manager, Ash.  Finally at the end of the nightmare they admitted that they had given our table away and had placed us at the bottom of the list.  For this they comped us an appetizer that had less chips than we get for free at any Mexican restaurant.  This was for nine people.  It was hot on one side and cool on the other.  The whole experience was a nightmare.  Many of us wanted to leave, but five of the members of our group are from out of state and wanted to continue our tradition.  If it had been up to me, we would have left at 5:45 pm.  There was hardly anyone on the wait list when we signed up at 4:15 pm.  It shouldn't have been an hour and a half wait at that point.  It never should have taken 2 hours and fifteen minutes.  Ash represented himself as the manager.  He was rude and very unprofessional.  We will no longer continue this celebration.  We will find a new place to celebrate the holidays.   At the end of this nightmare we were presented with our individual checks with an 18% gratuity attached.  I understand this is the practice, but, in this case, we would have never left such a tip.  We were finally given our checks at 8 pm.  This means this whole nightmare took close to four hours.  I will be posting this on my social pages so that everyone will know what happened to us and what to expect at Cheesecake Factory."
Samantha B.,"Blue Springs, MO",0,23,2,4.0,8/2/2015,"Went for dinner at the Cheesecake Factory for the first time Friday evening. Went early because we knew it would be packed. We got there just in time before the dinner rush and were seated right away. The food was really good and the server was excellent and very attentive. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits and he really enjoyed it. The prices for entrees are just a bit high, but where they get you are the appetizers and the alcohol. We didn't order appetizers because we thought they were just too overpriced. My boyfriend had a Long Island iced tea and it was $10 and change and that wasn't even for the top shelf. We got 3 slices of cheesecake to take home and share. Plain, white chocolate blueberry and the outrageous. They were awesome. Too much to eat in one sitting so we saved the rest for the next evening. Nice place to go for a special evening out for us but a bit too pricey to go regularly."
Steven M.,"Mokena, IL",1162,1210,14,3.0,10/30/2011,"We sat outside as it was one of the last nice nights of the year. The waiter was a little sporatic, but we only came here for dessert anyway. I had the original and it was not as good as I remember. I also tried some of the banana cheese cake and it was not as special as the price would dictate. I am quite sure that this place is not worth the coin they are charging. But it has a great building in an awsome location."
Liz L.,"Wheatland, WY",0,24,,4.0,2/4/2013,"This location was close to the Embassy Suites where we stayed, so every time we drove by it on our way to somewhere else my mouth watered. They have a free parking garage and there is some street parking. It's close to lots of shops and other restaurants (including Jack Stack Barbecue where we also ate). We went on a Thursday night around 6:30 and there was no wait. The staff was friendly and the service was good. It was a little loud (echo and the music was too loud). I really liked my food. I had the Carlton Salad, which I thought was divine, and the Tiramisu Cheesecake; which I wanted to marry because it was that good. My husband had the cheese steak sandwich and the strawberry cheesecake. He didn't care for the bread on the sandwich, but thought his cheesecake was very good. The menu is huge and the cheesecake selection is so fun. I would recommend eating here."
Rasheda H.,"Frisco, TX",60,63,27,3.0,9/14/2011,"I come here for cheesecake and their strawberry leomande. The food here is bleh. The ONLY dish I like is the jambalaya pasta. Other than that, skip this place. My grandma makes better cheesecake!"
Graham S.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,344,52,4.0,7/21/2011,"Pretty good stuff as far as uber-chains go. Huge portions and a menu the length of the Magna Carta, if you can't find something you like you may have a medical problem. Usually go here with the whole fam in tow, and they're always very accommodating."
Aimee G.,"Kansas City, MO",2,9,4,3.0,7/24/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is A-Ok. Our family consisting of husband, 7yo, 5yo and 3yo plus g'ma and three adult family friends dined there on Thursday evening.  We arrived at 5:45 and the approximate wait time for an inside table was 25-30 minutes.  The outdoor tables were available right away.  We opted to wait for the indoor table. We were seated in about 20 minutes.  The service was OUTSTANDING.  She was very helpful, suggesting several items for the kiddos.  We ended up splitting the slider app with broccoli and fries b/w the three kids.  They loved it.   I had the Santa Fe Chicken salad which I absolutely love.  MrAimeeG had the jambalaya pasta & he literally wiped the plate clean.  Our other guests had sandwiches and pasta which received good reviews as well. My dessert was a bowl of strawberries.  The cheesecakes ordered were strawberry, chocolate Oreo, Butterfinger and a cake/cheesecake combo.   It was perfect for a big crowd like ours.   Service was excellent! Not outstanding food but absolutely o-kay."
Jessica F.,"Kansas City, MO",9,11,,2.0,1/9/2009,"This place is way over-hyped. And over-priced. The wait staff is OK... just like anywhere depends on who you get! I remember back when they first came to KC, it was almost difficult to get a job there, they were so hard core about experience and training.  I hate to burst anyones bubble about the cheesecake itself.. IT COMES TO THEM FROZEN!!!!!!!! It is made in a factory, yes, but it is trucked. Dont dare say the word frozen there, though! They call it ""deeply chilled"". If Im lyin Im dyin.. ask anyone that works there and they will probably tell you the truth!  There are MANY MANY better places to spend your money- and get home made desserts!"
Colleen O.,"New York, NY",67,263,616,4.0,11/8/2008,"Look, everyone has got a story about Cheesecake, good and bad. Everyone has been waited on by that ass of a server, everyone loves the bread. Here's why I like it:  1. You don't ask yourself, ""What am I in the mood for?"" before coming here, because there is no speciality - it's the cuisine for all peoples. If you want pasta and your friend wants American, no problem. Cafeterias provide the same concept only the food is, well, cafeteria food. Cheesecake is not cafeteria food. It's food to fill you, it tastes good - I don't care abut the stigma that it's a chain.  2. You pay for the portions. Most of the dishes I've seen or eaten are fit for two. I've even noticed couples sharing a plate, which I would never do (I can eat my own well past a single portion to be too honest with you) but you get the point. CF isn't friendly for dieters - it's more like outright hostile.  I've even heard from their own staff members that Cheesecake salads are as healthy their fried macaroni and cheese. It's pretty killer food and CF is notorious for sliding around any exact figures as to how high in calories their dishes actually are and although I think's that's pretty slimy of management -  it's America! If the restaurant skimped rather than plate too much, the franchise wouldn't have made it past the first restaurant.  3. The bathrooms. I'll inevitably take the trip if I'm at CF and starving (but trying to keep a promise to myself not to eat the full loaf of molasses rye bread before my meal comes) and bored too. So, I'll excuse myself and walk around a bit, take the long way up the stairs twisting around the ridiculous crowds in the waiting area. I'll look at other people's food choices (the menu is so large, I've only tried a fraction of it so it's a smart idea to peak around). Finally, I'll get to the bathrooms. Great bathrooms, love the full-length mirror.  And it's so important for a restaurant to have a nice bathroom. It's like the tell tale sign that the food will be good or something, I swear. It's like how a woman looks to see if her boyfriend treats his mother right (if he doesn't, he's supposedly going to be a cruel husband) - well, the same goes for bathrooms. 4. The cheesy male servers. This isn't what I consider the 'best' part about CF, more like the most entertaining to exhibit. Look, five of my friends have been picked up by these goons -FIVE - ew, I hate to admit that, but it's true. It's like they see a table of women and call dibs on it or something, very strange. And for the 5 that have been picked up, probably 50 more have been harmlessly hit on, myself included. CF must attract an oversexed staff - maybe it's in the water - who knows?! 5. The dessert. It's what everyone looks forward to, it's the reason why so many women throw caution to the wind and go off their crazy fad diets, it's the topic of conversation among a group of female girlfriends, just chatting: ""Oh my GOD - we have to split it cheesecake,"" one says. ""Um....I'm getting my own,"" the other replies. ""LET'S BE BAD!"" they both say. And then, kind of sadly, they'll eat it and talk about how BAD it is for them.  6. Their strawberry lemonade - served in a glass with the rim lined with a tablespoons' worth of sugar and a giant strawberry. I don't like to order fruity drinks, especially if it's nonalcoholic - but I always make an exception for this one drink - TRY IT. And honestly, the list goes on. Cheesecake attempts to make your meal as comfortable and appealing as you want it to be and few chains, be it Applebee's or McDonald's can state that in their restaurant manuals."
Sophia S.,"Overland Park, KS",0,16,,4.0,7/10/2012,"I so love there entrees,  The atmosphere is great and the wait staff are wonderful.  I especially like the deserts.... yum"
Anne W.,"Kansas City, MO",162,11,16,2.0,10/31/2011,Boooo.  I found the Overland Park store to be far better run and operationally efficient.  The servers here are unsophisticated and sloppy looking. What a shame.
Mykie D.,"Valley Ranch, TX",498,898,757,5.0,11/20/2008,lemon-raspberry cheesecake is really all i need to say about it.... wash it down with either a hot chocolate or a glass of champagne. you're all set. great location too. there are cheesecake factorys all over the U.S. so whichever you go to probably has the same menu
Michael P.,"Hammond, LA",33,51,38,5.0,6/15/2011,Lunch today was incredible. I don't know how they keep up with the extensive menu they have. Wow
