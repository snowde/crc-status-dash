Adam V.,"Greenwood, MO",14,81,11,5.0,6/20/2011,"We'll be back!  I took my wife to The Cheesecake Factory to celebrate our 12th year wedding anniversary. It was on a Saturday around 4pm so the lunch menu was still available.  We started out with their lemonade which was very good and fresh tasting in a sugar-dipped rimmed glass.  Nice presentation.  I ordered their four cheese pasta.  It was absolutely wonderfull and their mozzarella cheese that was heavily applied was fresh and decadently delicious.  My wife had their chicken salad which was humongous and very delicious with a beautiful presentation.  One very small complaint with the pasta was that I found it to be too al dente. It needed to be cooked just a speck longer, but it wasn't too bad. I prefer it that way much more so than the pasta being overcooked.  We had their delicious fried avocado appetizer with the tamarind cashew dipping sauce.  It was tangy and delicious.  For dessert, we split the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake.  It was beautifully decorated with ""Happy Anniversarry"" written on the plate's border in chocolate syrup.  The chocolate cheesecake was to die for.  It was more than enough dessert split between the two of us. The service was very good but not quite excellent as I had to request more water and it would have been nice if the server would have wiped the dinner crumbs from the table (I had to do that myself) before serving dessert.  But overall, the service was very good, the food fantastic and we'll be back for our date nights.  Nice atomosphere too!  Try to get a booth window so you can watch the passerby's shop in the plaza."
Scott D.,"Kansas City, MO",39,146,167,2.0,1/31/2009,"Nothing good, nothing bad = Mediocrity.  Excellent restaurants close, while the Cheesecake Factory marches on.  I guess it helps to have 500 menu options, even if none of them are particularly good, and Very Large Portions.  Meh."
Ravena F.,"Daly City, CA",316,528,45,3.0,5/29/2008,"It was a sunny afternoon, we were stuck in that in between time post-wedding & pre-reception.  We had hours & I was hungry.  I was also obsessed with sitting outside since it was much nicer weather than the foggy San Francisco I'm used to. I spotted their expansive outdoor seating complete with fountain from across the street and made a dash.  Unfortunately, they were not serving outside until 5pm.  (Huh?  It was so perfectly gorgeous out!  Why not take advantage?)  Seeing my fallen expression, the host quickly suggested that I order take-out & sit outside.  Perfect.  We had drinks at the bar (nice Bloody Mary!) while we waited.   Sitting outside, slurping up my Vietnamese spring rolls was mighty fine.  Nothing outstanding, nothing horrid.  Just even-keel, pleasant."
Skipper B.,"Frisco, TX",113,17,6,5.0,9/9/2011,"The menu is huge, the wine list lengthy (the Coppola Cheescake Factory is excellent Cabernet) and of course the cheesecake is delicious!"
Jonathan F.,"Webb City, MO",4,91,2,4.0,1/28/2011,"The wait can be a little long, especially on the weekends.  There is outside seating, which in good weather seems to fill up quickly.  The food was good, as was the service.  I've eaten here a couple of times and would go back again."

Michelle G.,"Omaha, NE",49,404,2,4.0,5/6/2008,"I love the Cheesecake factory, this location was one of the first places i ate at in KC,  but i prefer the location at 119th and Metcalf to this one. my work friends and i always had good lunches here but the 119Th street location is the one closest to my apartment and has given me excellent meals since it opened along with my out of state guests that raved about it and the cheesecake. the menu is huge,  my favorite is the tex mex eggrolls, i've tried other menu items but this is the one i go back to and will stop for after shopping in the afternoon. nice bartender and waitstaff huge portions and the handy takeout cheesecake counter."
Brian H.,"Harker Heights, TX",7,103,14,4.0,5/26/2013,slurp!  i just wish there was more parking and more tables to fit more people so i could come here more often.
Jeff P.,"Thornhill, Canada",129,2,,5.0,5/19/2011,"As all cheesecake factorys.... Standard service and great huge protions! I dont even know what to recommend... My faves are the ""bang bang chicken and shrimp"" and the ""Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna""... Both are sensational and the cheesecake is to die for. Great tasting food , huge selection and protions all for a great price. I love this place... unfortunately my diet doesnt though!"
Stephanie B.,"Springfield, IL",5,49,3,2.0,2/12/2011,I love the Cheesecake Factory but this location is not the best. We had to wait FOREVER for a table and they weren't even that busy. In fact the manager came over to apologize to us and actually sounded like a complete moron. They were out of some of the appetizers we ordered so another manager apologized and said she would take the other 2 off of our bill. Then we got our receipts to find that they added gratuity to our checks automatically. We only had a party of 6 and I've been there with a larger party and have not had that happen. My food wasn't that warm when it was served. I was really disappointed with the whole experience.
Jackie P.,"Chicago, IL",238,385,11,3.0,2/24/2008,"I'm giving this place three stars because the cheesecake here is great...duh!  it's called the Cheesecake Factory.  However, the food here is not good...AT ALL! My friends and I ordered the nachos as an appetizer and they were okay.  And then I split a steak with another friend and had a salad.  The salad consisted of 4 or 5 wilted leaves of lettuce a bunch of salad dressing and a couple of tomatoes.  Please!  The steak was okay but had to be sent back once because it wasn't cooked right.  The waitress literally looked like she wanted to kill me. We waited for almost an hour and a half.  Our wait was suppose to be 45 minutes but when we finally asked they lost our name and weren't going to call us.  They said it would be ANOTHER 30 minutes.  Did I mention this was on top of the wait we already had.  After having a talk with the manager we were seated immediately but the mood had already been set! There are much better places to eat in KC."
Heather Anne B.,"Columbia, MO",12,222,,4.0,1/8/2013,"I've been here for dinner dozens of times, but I finally got to visit for brunch and I wasn't disappointed. The wait was long, as usual, but once we were seated we got the same awesome service and tasty food Cheesecake Factory is known for. There were four people in my group and I can't remember what everyone ordered, but I got the crab hash. There were too many onions or something I wasn't crazy about, but the combination of the hollandaise and crab and hash brown was so good! My husband and I also each ordered a cheesecake to take home and both were delicious. I have probably only tried three or four of their cheesecakes ever, but they are consistently very good, probably even better than the food. Caramel is my weakness so I ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake and it was freaking amazing. Even my husband, who doesn't care for caramel, ended up eating half of it. Of course this is always more of a special occasion kind of place, because there's no way I could afford a trip here just on a whim, but every time I visit I thoroughly enjoy my meal start to finish."
Nicole E.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,215,60,4.0,5/21/2007,"Let me just start off by saying I love the Cheesecake Factory!  Whether its been in L.A., Phoenix, Atlanta or Kansas City, I'm usually never disappointed. However, they have changed the menu and some items have been removed, like the Fried Chicken Salad.  But anyhow. The location on the Plaza is everything that you expect.  We went for lunch, about 1p on a Friday.  We had to wait about 15 minutes.  Not too bad.  Our server was very nice, prompt and knowledgeable. And my Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake - to die for!"
Lori H.,"Newport, MI",182,302,24,3.0,4/5/2010,"People rave about Cheesecake Factory.  I have been there three times now, and everytime I leave,  I leave happy, but am not overly blown away by the place.  We ate here on Easter Sunday for our Easter dinner.  Pretty short wait considering it was crazy busy.  We were seated upstairs and service was PERFECT.  Our waitress was incredible, especially considering how busy it was.  You get an excessive amount of food here, even with the lunch portions.  I had a 4 cheese pasta which was OK, and some crab rangoon with my husband for an appetizer, which was good, but a little too well done.  Anyway, I leave again, thinking, good meal, but just ""OK"".  Great location though."
Nicole G.,"Springfield, IL",2,23,,2.0,2/15/2011,The wait time was insane.  I understand a wait but when you are told 15-20 minutes and wait for over an hour it gets ridiculous!  The food is amazing because it's the Cheesecake Factory.
Travis C.,"Shawnee, KS",1,2,,5.0,12/24/2010,Fiance and I go here every year for Christmas Eve and have had great service every time. Food is always great as well.
Jon S.,"Jasper, MO",39,60,59,5.0,11/2/2009,"Thickest menu I've ever seen.  They've got some of everything and it's all good.  The atmosphere is dress/casual.  And, of course, the cheesecake is out of this world.  They have an outdoor patio for warmer weather, and the smoking area is upstairs, well away from non-smokers.  These guys truly understand how to provide a great dining experience.  A good place to take a date for dessert (especially since there's a Coldstone Creamery across the street) or for a formal dinner (like prom)."
L L.,"Maricopa County, AZ",57,102,6,3.0,11/8/2009,"I LOVE the food, but it's very cost-prohibitive.  Don't even bother to order alcohol at $10 a drink.  The wide selection of food and every cheesecake I've ever tried are delicious.  I like this location, because there are 2 floors, which makes the wait a little shorter."
Helen G.,"Brooklyn, NY",140,114,10,4.0,5/4/2009,People are being really hard on the Cheesecake Factory.  I do admit there are some fantastic places in KC but I think it is convenient enough though it is very popular which makes it difficult to get a seat on the weekends and a little over price because it's a chain.  The people are nice and the portions are good.  And they cheesecakes are great.  So here's a little internet hug for the Cheesecake Factory.  We can be friends. Enjoy!
M T.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,,3.0,5/23/2010,"I was in KC for a few days, and got hungry while checking out their downtown country club in the early eve.  Not knowing which restaurant to try, I decided to conservativcely go into Cheesecake Factory for quick bite. I ordered some dinner and cocktail.   The cocktail arrived after I was done with my dinner.  Oh well, I must be eating fast than normal.  That's when I realized my drink costed me more than my meal.  Interesting discovery.  Upon paying the bill, the waitress was trying to figure out how to spell my last name... I think she felt bad for bringing me my bill before my drink.   Nice girl, but overall the restaurant was slow and not attentive.  Food was just ok."
