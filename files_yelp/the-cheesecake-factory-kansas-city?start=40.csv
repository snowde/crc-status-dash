Eduardo C.,"Plaza Area, Kansas City, MO",71,15,,5.0,4/12/2017,"Great service! Wanted to sit outside and had to wait 15-20 mins even though there were several open tables outside but we understand sometimes we have to wait. Our server Cory do an amazing job! He was on top of our orders, gave us great recommendations on the food, and was constantly stopping by to make sure we were going fine. AMAZING JOB by Cory!"
Charles M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,11,18,5.0,10/10/2016,"Great food at a great value. They have a very extensive menu, there is sure to be something for everyone!  I had the pit beef dip sandwich, and tried the veggie melt, both were outstanding."
Mazin J.,"Kansas City, MO",207,2,,1.0,9/24/2016,Michelle is the epitome of low class. She is a classic example of a person with zero people skills.  Never in my life will I look at cheesecake the same again without thinking about this experience.  I never plan on going that Applebee's like restaurant ever again. Brio kona mccormicks jack stack or any other restaurant on the plaza would love the added business.  I'm just mad at myself that I wanted a slice of frozen cheese cake that's not even made in house 816-977-7737 if you want to ask me about my experience over the phone.  Disrespect is not something I will tolerate.

Lauren D.,"St. Charles, MO",0,21,18,5.0,1/23/2016,"There was a long wait to get inside, but it was a Saturday without reservations downtown. It was definitely worth the wait. Cheesecake Factory is famous for cheesecake for a reason.  I had the s'mores cheesecake covered it hot fudge paired with the pineapple mojito. Both were fantastic! I was too excited to snap a picture of the cheesecake. I split the cheesecake with my boyfriend. It's extremely heavy and delicious, but it's too much to eat in one sitting. You'll need to take it home or split with at least one other person. Whew! I can't imagine having dessert  and dinner here. Wow. I would love to come back as try their delicious dinner entrees. I'll be back! Wonderful service and tasty desserts. What's not to love?!"
John D.,"Kansas City, MO",1,2,1,1.0,7/29/2017,If you're going to take part in Postmates at least follow through. Every time I've ordered from you through them you've dropped the ball. Unexpected for a corporate fancy Applebee's.
Ted C.,"Covina, CA",339,48,34,5.0,12/17/2015,"Well there you go! Completely happy with this place! I've been to many of them but this one really set the bar. Extremely friendly staff, well organized and really nice.  I had a huge family et together and we had a blast. I haven't been in Kansas City in years and we had a blast. I had the salmon on a bed of brown rice. I also had their IPA to wash everything doe with. The salmon was amazing!!!! And the rice had a little bit of sauce on it. It was none the less amazing too haha. Thank you for a great experience! Happy holidays."
Ashley E.,"Lake Lotawana, MO",101,13,5,5.0,1/5/2017,"Always delicious! My favorite entree is the orange chicken. It's well spiced and huge portion. The typhoon punch is $10 but also with the splurge. There seems to always be a wait, I always check the bar upstairs and downstairs for a seat or two and usually get right in."
Koby K.,"Warrensburg, MO",29,1,,5.0,11/5/2016,"The Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane combination is a great dish. Both have unique, fantastic flavor and for only 21.95 it's a great price. Topping it off with any of their signature cheesecake makes the meal complete."
Kentucky M.,"Kansas City, MO",5,11,,2.0,2/14/2017,"Do not do take out without checking your order! Wrecks your meal.For the money and headaches, go elsewhere. Oh, and they won't post prices online. If they did, you would probably bail anyway."
Karen R.,"Shawnee, KS",2,39,11,5.0,11/25/2016,I completely love this place. Their food is delicious and they don't call it the Cheesecake Factory for nothing. I love the variety in desserts and drinks. I have yet to have a bad experience here.
Carol A.,"Kansas City, MO",53,333,42,3.0,3/17/2016,"If your main objective for lunch with a sister is an enormous menu of choices and decent service in a dynamic atmosphere, then The Cheesecake Factory will fulfil your needs.  I have not had a bad experience there, the food is always tasty and it is certainly plentiful.  But, considering they have been on the Plaza for quite a number of years and I have been a customer only 3 or 4 times, it isn't exactly what I am seeking very often. Lunch on Monday was Sis' treat and so the choice was hers.  I had a very good and extremely filling selection from the SKINNYLICIOUS® menu.  I chose the Chicken Salad Sandwich with a side salad dressed with Balsamic dressing.  The greens were plentiful and a nice Spring mix with absolutely no iceberg in sight.  The housemade chicken salad included Roasted Almonds, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayonnaise and was served on Toasted Brioche Bread that really made the sandwich something special.  Sis also ordered from the Skinnylicious menu and got a Hamburger on a Toasted Bun with Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickles and Mayonnaise which is also served with a Green Salad.  Neither of us had room for dessert, which was disappointing, as luscious looking cheesecake slices as well as other goodies kept whizzing by our table for delivery to all our dining neighbors (who had planned their eating and drinking more judiciously -- or else they just waddled out of the restaurant, I'm not sure which).  We arrived at about 1:15 and after a five minute wait were seated.  To correspond with my recollections of past visits, the noise level made it difficult to carry on conversation and I remembered why I tend to avoid the experience.  But the service was very efficient and the food was quite good, so I balanced the pros and cons to a solid 3-star rating.  The Cheesecake Factory is never going to be a favorite for me, but it is obviously a winner with hundreds of customers every single day, so they must be doing something ""Right"".  And maybe I'll make another visit in about five years and remember to ""Save room for some Cheesecake"" when I go. PS: Thanks again for lunch, Sis."
Batricia D.,"Kansas City, MO",47,18,12,4.0,11/19/2016,"I want to acknowledge Brett, the manager who so kindly took care of me during my entree moment of distress, he was very polite and pleasant to encounter.  I first ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp, not expecting the taste to be so sweet, I am used to spicier thai type food. I called Brent and explained my distress, without any hassle, he asked me which entree would I like to replace my order with. I ordered my usual the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, one of the best dishes on the menu.  I also ordered the cuban sandwich with fries for my hubby, it was a very delicious experience, and his first experience trying it at The Cheesecake Factory.   My husband is picky when it comes to cuban sandwiches and he found the cuban sandwich from The Cheesecake Factory to be the one of best cuban sandwiches.  He would order it again."
Jonathan F.,"Lenexa, KS",29,10,,5.0,7/7/2016,"Try their Oreo Cheese cake and their New Orleans Cajun Dish. Both are very good! Also, the coffee is fantastic!  Sincerely, Jonathan Fayard"
Ashley R.,"Kansas City, MO",28,12,25,5.0,6/29/2016,"Very big menu , but you can't go wrong! This is one of those restaurants that you'll have to keep trying a new dish , but once you find your favorite dish you'll fall in love with this restaurant"
Reggie M.,"Kansas City, MO",1,7,,1.0,9/6/2016,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! The sad thing is, my wife really enjoys their cheesecake...but we can't stand bad service! A group of friends and I decided to go here to celebrate my birthday, this past weekend, which was a bad idea. Lousy waitress (didn't receive drinks for at least 30 minutes after being seated), Delayed food, and worst of them all....poor customer service!!"
Nicki F.,"Kansas City, MO",38,153,1,4.0,10/1/2016,They are always super busy at this location. Even if you want just cheesecake at 10 pm on a Saturday night it's still a wait. They do have the bake case right by the entry though so if you're there for just dessert you can easily get it to go and eat it on a bench on the plaza.
Sara C.,"Kansas City, MO",379,542,367,4.0,12/20/2014,"I have to admit that my guilty pleasure lies in a creamy, majestic piece of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. I don't care if they're a chain or even if their cheesecake is frozen....I love it. One piece can make a meal and I write their 1/2 price Cheesecake Day on my calendar like it's a National Holiday. The White Chocolate Raspberry and Mango Key Lime are both top runners for favorite flavor.  Now I'm hungry."
Kevin B.,"Overland Park, KS",263,1,,2.0,2/3/2017,"After an evening at the theater we decided to have dinner at the Cheesecake Factor.  We arrived around 9:30 and things were very slow.  No one was at the hostess station and very few tables were occupied.  We asked for a table for two and we were told we would have to wait 5-10 minutes.  Really?  The hostess continued to organize things behind her station, carry on conversation with waitresses and totally ignore us for a good amount of time.  She then looked up and called out our name as if there was a crowd of 100 there when it was just the two of us.  We were taken to our table and waited almost 10 minutes to be waited on.  We finally put in our order.  We ordered Nachos as an appetizer and Spicy Cashew Chicken and a Chopped Salad.  When the Nachos came they were burnt, not just browned but actually black on the edges.  The food finally came and it was fine.  We had to almost beg for drink refills.  The Cheesecake Factory  has really raised their prices to where it's almost a fine dining experience (or should be).  It's hard to find even a simple entree for under $15 and most are more than that.  We ended up spending over $50.  Needless to say we won't be going back.  It's crazy to have to pay that much for bad service, being ignored and burnt food.  There are great places on the Plaza to dine.  I'd steer clear of this one."
Jay J.,"Raymore, MO",0,2,,2.0,11/20/2016,"Was there yesterday evening with family and was told 1 hour wait. After 1 hour and 30 mins we were seated.We were so hungry that we all ordered right away. Food came with in 15 mins. All good so far. I ordered factory grande burrito, which came in cold. After 7 mins got hold of our waitress, she took the burrito back and said we will warm it up. After 15 mins she emerged again and said it's taking longer as they are making me a new one. Another 10 mins later same old plate emerged and burrito was hot this time but it was very dry. Marinara was sticking to plate. We go to cheesecake quite a few times but this time I was dissatisfied and disappointed"
MB W.,"Kansas City, MO",55,38,12,4.0,10/9/2016,Such a surprise to know that my husband can read minds and bring home an entire strawberry cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory. So delish!!
