Conor D.,"Lawrence, KS",0,10,,2.0,10/16/2016,"Great food as always, but waited 45 mins between appetizers and entree.  Said it to the 'manager' who didn't give a damn, was completely stand offish and never offered an apology or excuse.  Obviously has no problem that her company is represented this way, and obviously doesn't deserve the title of manager either.  Very disappointed, been to other CF locations and have had impeccable service.  Shame on you."
Tom R.,"Kansas City, MO",4,21,4,5.0,3/13/2016,"Always great food, always great service. Mostly we go here for appetizers and drinks. Because they are delicious. I was just now listing all of the ones I love but it was ridiculous so I'm instead going to merely highlight the Crispy Cuban thingies and the Firecracker Salmon. I don't even try to remember which cocktails of theirs I've gotten before, haven't had a bad one yet, so I just choose the ones that appeal to me most that day. If you go during busy times SHOCK it's going to be busy. So we like to go during the less busy times so we can enjoy ourselves at our leisure without feeling bad. Bartender guy is awesome, and of course the waitstaff is all quite good."
Kyle N.,"Topeka, KS",34,6,,4.0,10/10/2016,This was the second time coming to this location and we were not disappointed either time. We went over the noon hour on a Saturday and surprisingly they were not busy at all.  The mac and cheese burger is definitely a favorite of mine. How can it not be with all that cheese! We then followed our meal with cheesecake of course. I enjoyed a piece of raspberry lemon cheesecake.  Overall it was a great experience with great food. From now on I think we will order our cheesecake first and then decide if we want something else because I left feeling miserable.  I didn't want to take a doggy bag because we were walking and definitely couldn't let it go to waste.
Regina W.,"Enid, OK",14,4,,2.0,10/8/2016,"Poor service, overly salted potatoes,  verrryyyy fishy salmon, chicken gristle in pasta dish. Won't  return. Not the restaurant I  remember  visiting a few years back. What a disappointment  for my  son's  birthday dinner :("
Tiffany T.,"Austin, TX",1283,122,1051,3.0,11/4/2014,"I enjoy the pasta dishes at Cheesecake Factory and of course, the cheesecakes, but waiting around for an hour was a cluster due to the absent mind individual that was the host.  Our buzzer gave us the indication that they were ready for us after 20 minutes, we gave it to them, the host took it and looked lost as to why we were standing there. We were waiting for our ticket for proof that we are able to be sat soon. He accused us of not giving him the buzzer at all. So strange as we were standing in front of him the entire time. I understand that it was a hectic Saturday night, but he could at least apologize and let us know that he will do what he can instead of such accusations.  The manager came and spoke with us and apologized. He stated that it'll be another 30 minutes. We waited around and after checking up on the host 2 more times, he finally said he got us a table after 40 minutes. Total wait time was about an hour and a half.  It was a busy night with high school homecoming so we gave them some slack and was happy with the service that we received from the wait staff. Food is always consistent and delicious!  Thanks to our waiter for bringing up the mood! He was great!"
Rabecca C.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,33,38,5.0,8/10/2016,"It was soooo good. Had dinner last night with my friend, it was about 10:30 when we got there, the service still excellent and they didn't rush us until we finish our meal after 11:10. Ordered mango lime cheesecake as desert at the end, even I was so full, can't help to finish it all."
Renee H.,"Kansas City, KS",44,5,2,5.0,8/21/2016,"Food was fantastic- Chicken Lemon Couscous, patio dining and tasty drinks made for a perfect summer evening. Cesar took great care of us and our puppy!"
Saige L.,"Kansas City, MO",69,94,11,4.0,8/12/2015,"Delicious, reasonably priced, and always busy! We typically come here for cheesecake alone but we went for the full meal this time.  Arriving at 9:00 on a Saturday night we were put on a thirty minute wait. Once sat we were promptly greeted by our server who was good, no real complaints with him. Food was okay, margaritas were okay and expensive for the quality we got.  This review only get four starts because of one little issue that arised. I had ordered the pasta dish, meat on the side. Once our food arrived the chicken was in the dish and I had it sent back. By time it came back, my boyfriend was finished with his meal and it had already been boxed up. Although the manager did deliver my meal there was no further action taken. It kind of dampered the entire meal and we weren't compensated in any way. Finishing with the usual cheesecake we were out of there two hours later full and content.  Next time were just going to do cheesecake and go elsewhere for dinner like normal."
Madison M.,"Kansas City, MO",0,2,,3.0,2/28/2017,The food was great. My only complaint was how long it took to get our lunch. It took 30 minutes for us to get the food we ordered. This was on a Monday afternoon when it wasn't that busy. I suggest you take their offer when they ask you if you want bread. That way you won't starve before your meal gets to the table.
John L.,"Sylvania, OH",0,23,7,4.0,7/30/2016,This place is great regardless of what city I'm in. Everything from the orange chicken to the seafood gumbo is fantastic. My family loves the food here. 4 different cheesecake slices today and none of them disappointed.
Stephanie S.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,97,110,5.0,6/21/2016,"Went here last night after a few other places failed. Yes, we are out of town and ate at a restaurant we have in our hometown. But this meal was amazing!  we had the orange chicken and chicken bellagio. Both were fantastic!! We had the ultimate margarita and a Long Island to drink, although pricey, they too, were amazing. We will definitely go back!"
anthony l.,"Topeka, KS",37,33,3,3.0,1/2/2017,We went to Kansas City tonight for something different to do and go to one of our favorite places to eat. Well we got seated pretty quick which was great but it took a little long to get our supper but I understand it was busy. But my daughter ordered the salmon dinner and we had to send it back because it was raw and it took another 30 minutes to get it back in which my daughter lost interest in it. So that was disappointing. None the less the waitress kept telling us it was just a few minutes away well that was not true. All I suggest is that the manager should of come over to apologize for the inconvenience and what was disturbing was the still charged me for it. You know it's not our fault the cook didn't do his job properly. It's amazing how we expect so many things to be perfect and we get disappointed when it doesn't go over well. I hope I get some feedback so I can feel like I can go back someday. Thank you for your quick response  but not to be greedy is there a way to complete my satisfaction with a gift card or something to get me and my family back as loyal customers.
Denise L.,"Rochester, MN",6,32,,4.0,12/3/2016,"Our server was AWESOME! One of the nicest servers I've had in a long time. She was knowledgeable, brought our food as soon as it was done, apologized for the delay with our food, and was really great. The food, as usual was good. i had the Thai glazed salmon dish; love, love, LOVE the sauce for that dish!"
Antoinette C.,"Olathe, KS",42,8,,1.0,6/30/2017,This is one of the rudest places to eat I called to place a to go order I was left on hold for twenty minutes I drove there while still on hold as soon as I reached to open the door the girl picked up the phone and asked who was I holding for I replied to place a order she said I don't know where the girl went to take your order but I'll just do it. Then she took my order so after we hung up I walked in no one acknowledged me I stood there and listened to about five employees complain about people calling in and placing a to go order so close to closing time. In my defense I called around 5 till 10 . So the order taking girl walked over gave the cashier my order and said it was some lady with a weird name. Still I said nothing so after listening for about five to seven minutes I walk over and say in my defense I was left on hold for twenty minutes. They all got quiet then one guy said we wasn't talking about you we were talking about employees. I said ok at that point I was just Praying they didn't spit in my food or do some other gross thing to it because one of the girls gave me this look like yeah I got you walked to the back came back out looked at me and left. So by now my food was ready which it was cold ugh!!!!! I just took it and left I was very upset. Never again will I ever eat at that location . I emailed the office over a week ago I still haven't heard anything back. The funny thing is I stood there and watch them goof off like they were just hanging out.
angela a.,"Opa-locka, FL",0,8,,2.0,9/4/2016,"It's not too often I write a negative post. And to write one for a Cheesecake Factory is almost absurd, But I have to! Minus the server poor guy .. Today I was served cold bread to start and then for breakfast I got served MOLDY bread and a cold breakfast. Bacon and eggs were cold!  manager came out with fresh hard bread and said he really does apologize and to let him know if there is anything else he can do .. And also promised  this had never happened before. Really?come on."
Adam S.,"Overland Park, KS",24,193,20,4.0,3/23/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has good food, enormous portions, and a menu the size of a book. I've been to both KC locations numerous times, and my wife and I typically split an entree (usually the orange chicken). The portion sizes are such that you can get two full meals out of one entree. Maybe not the burgers, but most of the $16-20 items. The cheesecake is also delicious. I'm a big fan of the pineapple upside down cheesecake. The Plaza location is a little cramped and super busy. If you'd like a Friday/Saturday night cheesecake fix, I'd recommend the Overland Park location. It is laid out better, and you aren't packed in like sardines while waiting for a table. My favorite time to go to the Plaza location is on a nice warm day for Sunday brunch and get a table outside."
Anurag K.,"San Francisco, CA",119,16,2,5.0,5/15/2016,"Can not rate anything because everything there is awesome and best. Avocado rolls, and what so ever."
Desiree B.,"Overland Park, KS",0,3,,5.0,6/11/2016,"Of course the food is always fantastic, (I'd highly recommend the chicken and biscuits if you're looking for a delicious comfort food). But I brought my sister here for her bachelorette party as her first Cheesecake Factory experience, and our server made the night unforgettable. Jared B. was attentive, knowledgeable of the menu, and had the best personality that kept us laughing all night! Thank you for the incredible ending to our night!"
Kim S.,"Kansas City, KS",167,149,224,3.0,12/12/2014,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Nothing. That's because that's really the impression that I get here. Everything that is here has been done before. There is nothing that just catches my eye and says pick me, Kim. That's sad to me. It was a 50 min wait on a Thursday which hey, I'm okay with as long as I will be dazzled. I'm easily dazzled. I've been dazzled by shiny buttons but back to the subject at hand. The seating is discouraging. We were a group of six adults and we were sat in a booth that would have been uncomfortable for me and my four teens. That's standard for them according to their manager though. He apologized profusely. So I picked the chicken Parmesan sandwich and can say, yep it's a sandwich. I wasn't wowed but I wasn't upset. I was overwhelmingly underwhelmed. I ended up bringing it home. I don't know what's the deal with the current trend of big bread on sandwiches but I don't like it. The flavors were meh. I will say I'm glad that I got the chicken parm since two people at the table opted to not even take their leftovers since they were disappointed. I will say that they are generous with their portions. Also, I truly did enjoy the raspberry lemonade. It was the shining star of my meal. I couldn't get enough of it. I hate that this restaurant makes me feel like a food snob because I've found joy in $1 tacos. This just doesn't do it for me."
Ken M.,"Rock Island, IL",0,34,17,5.0,1/25/2016,"I went with my co workers tonight and I got the spicy skinny chicken tacos.  So good! Plenty of food too! I would normally not order off the ""light"" menu, but I am SO glad that I did! My co workers also enjoyed their meals and no one left hungry! I also got the salted caramel cheesecake to go and it was the bomb! All the ingredients were fresh as well!"
