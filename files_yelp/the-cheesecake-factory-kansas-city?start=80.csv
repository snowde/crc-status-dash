Brian E.,"Olathe, KS",94,40,,2.0,6/12/2015,"The service is impeccable, but you can comparable food at most other places cheaper. On my last visit, I had ordered a pizza. The crust on half of the pizza was as black as can be, but they still brought it out. Due to time constraints, I didn't send it back.  The Peach Bellini here is very delicious."
Dale T.,"Olathe, KS",18,9,8,1.0,12/11/2014,"The wait was over an hr, then they stuck 6 women with coats and purses in a tiny booth, then said we could wait another hr for a larger table, then manager was not helpful, kept giving excuses that did not make the experience any better. I told him to go away, he huffed off and said fine. Really, so much for our first annual Christmas Party! We decided to stay, hell been here all night anyway! Will see about the food. Our server Holly, very apologetic, better manners!"
Silver F.,"Overland Park, KS",0,2,49,4.0,6/28/2015,Great restaurant. Bangbang chicken my favorite one. The bread was wonderful and I had the carbonara. Hubby had the pizza. Loved the cheesecake and our server was excellent! They know how to treat their customers!!
Kait O.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",107,4,,5.0,9/23/2016,Stopped in for a drink and was blown away by the hospitality. Everyone was friendly and had a smile on their face and that's all I've ever wanted from a restaurant.
Ted K.,"The Plaza, Kansas City, MO",33,17,31,4.0,8/23/2013,"Something for everyone on the menu. Cheesecake Factory has probably the largest menu of any restaurant I have ever been to.  All the foods are prepared and presented professionally. All the foods taste fantastic. Highly recommend the BBQ Salmon, which is one of my favorites.  And of course you can't go there without ordering dessert. Having over 30 different cheesecakes makes this the hardest choice of the night for you. Recommend the Oreo Extreme Dream Cheesecake. Oreos cooked into the cheesecake?  Yes please."
Gregory S.,"McGaheysville, VA",219,3,,3.0,2/2/2016,They do not take reservations even for large parties.  The yelp listing are misleading.  The food and ambiance is superlative but expect to wait.  Every.  Single.  Time.
Ettya F.,"Boston, MA",307,701,206,4.0,1/8/2013,"Once upon a time there lived a girl who resided in Wichita, Kansas. From the time she was just a wee lil' sprout until those awkward teenage years, her parents would cart her to the shopping/food mecca 150 minutes away known as Kansas City - which she would later refer to as KCK thanks to high school debate. What started out as trips to Laura Ashley where she and her mother would walk out in floral jumpsuits, and that little German sweets shop, where she and her father would walk out with chocolate smears on their faces, evolved into more hip outings. She would drag her parents to Abercrombie and insist on eating at that looming restaurant on the corner. The Cheesecake Factory became her favorite restaurant - it's uniqueness unbeknownst to Wichita, and having only visited one other time in Chicago, the demanding 16 year old would insist on ordering multiple baskets of brown, gooey, oaty bread - warm and fresh from the oven. She would scarf down avocado egg rolls - damning the abmoniation that those surely are against her Asian background - sparing not the even the puffy rice noodles adorning the plate. Soft, warm and creamy avocado filling be-speckled with peppers wrapped in delicate, golden brown fried wonton wrappers - surely these were health food that would not disrupt her teenage diet. And to cap off a meal, she would indulge - depending on the season - in either a chocolate peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake (which she now bemoans the loss of and didn't/still doesn't give a hoot about the inevitable hives that would accompany that luscious histamine inducing dessert) or her favorite dessert of all time: the White Chocolate Peppermint Bark cheesecake that would debut only in the holiday season.  Not much has changed: instead of engorging in all 8 half eggrolls solo, she now shares these with her kinfolk - ordering, instead, some raw tuna piled atop avocado and served with four delicately fried wonton chips (Ahi Tartare). But somehow she manages to lick clean the luscious mashed potatoes adorning her father's plate and the sweet potato fries served with her aunt's beautiful burger. These, she declares, are sweet potato fry perfection. Chain restaurants have the advantage of millions of tasters, and thanks to that, those fries rule...when dipped in honey mustard dressing. And once a year, she insists...ABSOLUTELY DEMANDS that she get her White Chocolate Peppermint Bark cheesecake, a red peppermint dotted cake with a white chocolate topping that sits upon a dense brownie bottom...and please, serve this with hot fudge."
Dean D.,"Vancouver, WA",110,327,628,4.0,12/24/2012,"I like this place and have been to many throughout the country.  Their menu is always somewhat overwhelming but the food and service is generally pretty good.  This Kansas City location in particular has been very good, always offering up friendly service and good quality food items.  Today I tried the Gumbo which was nicely presented and had plenty of shrimp and meat but was slightly on the bland side.  I also chose the Asian Shrimp Spring Rolls which were very good and came with two very nice dipping sauces.   This is the Cheese Cake Factory and their specialty is cheese cake!  Unfortunately, I had no room for desert today but I've had their cheese cake before and it's good!  All their baked goods are excellent.  I could eat their bread all day long! As chain restaurants go, this one is very good."
Lillian D.,"Kansas City, MO",3,37,19,2.0,11/8/2015,"So, normally I don't like eating at these kinds of restaurants, but today I wanted some variety. They have an extensive menu so I ordered a few small plates and an appetizer. I ordered the portabella, avocado, zucchini fries but when it came out, there were no zucchini pieces. Now had they told me they'd run out, I wouldn't be so peeved. The server came back saying she would send over the manager for the kitchen not letting the server know ""they had not prepared any."" Oh, the manager never came by! They did try to amend their mistake by making up a fresh order for us to take home, however. The chicken samosas were very oily... I'd already been waiting for thirty-five minutes for the apps to come out and then my entree, sweet corn tamales, came out and it was lukewarm! My friend's pasta da vinci had an over  abundance of black pepper for anyone's taste. Overall, I was not pleased with my dining experience today. The food quality was poor. Customer service was lacking. This is the reason why I don't like chains. Their inconsistency in food preparation and taste, and their lack of attention to its consumers is a pity."
Tonya M.,"Springfield, MO",0,7,2,3.0,4/14/2015,well whats not to love about the cheesecake factory.  pretty good food at a decent price.  My only complaint was the server completely forgot to put our kids order in.  so we all got our food and then had to wait for our kids hot dog to come out.
Mici B.,"Honolulu, HI",63,46,137,4.0,4/20/2013,"The male host as you walk in is funny and greets everyone as soon as you walk in. We ate at the bar and it was entertaining watching him make people laugh...he's a character.  Everyone knows the portions are huge so we ordered appetizers for lunch. Had my favs: Thai Chicken Wrap, Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Strawberry Shortcake. Just the right amount for 2 hungry people without feeling overly stuffed.  Whitney was the bartender as we sat at the bar. She is friendly, service-oriented and attentive. She took care of our needs before we even asked. We'll be back!!!"
Renee L.,"Kansas City, MO",17,50,13,5.0,1/8/2016,"I have a wonderful time everytime I go..even in the summer when it's packed and you got to get a pager or blinker and wait. I do know if you go to the bar you can get in faster and order and eat. They make wonderful drinks and great white wine. I usually order appetizers the tacos and fried calamari. Daughter gets nachos son gets jambalaya my fried gets spaghetti with large shrimp. And yes cheesecake red velvet, snicker, turtle and my die hard flavor is PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN. how could you not enjoy the buttery goodness of the cake and sweet pineapples with the luscious smooth cheesecake."
Kevin M.,"Kansas City, MO",45,10,18,1.0,11/5/2015,"Can't make a reservation on your birthday for a large party, so unless you want,to waste 40-60 minutes, on your birthday avoid."
Renee G.,"Parker, CO",0,5,2,1.0,4/5/2016,"I am still baffled about what happened to me last night at Cheesecake Factory. I was dining by myself (very close to my hotel) and waited about 10 minutes when my buzzer went off. I saw the hostess grab a stack of menus and lead me to a table set up for 6 people. I informed her it was just myself, and she looked at me like I was crazy and asked if I was sure I didn't have a party of 6. Yep, pretty sure it's just me... Ended up there was a mix up at the hostess stand; they paged the wrong buzzer. Then the three ladies at the hostess stand basically started arguing in front of me and other guests about their mix up.  I ended up getting taken to a different table and sat down. Shortly after the server came by, but offered no greeting. The first words out of his mouth were ""you need to give me a few minutes to get caught up"". WOW! There are more tactful ways to address a waiting guest, such as ""hi, how are you? I'll be with you shortly"". I was just taken aback by this and sat at my table about two minutes before getting up and leaving. There was no chance I was going to get good service even when he did ""catch up"". Had a very nice meal across the street at PF Changs instead."
Mike C.,"Blue Springs, MO",3,26,8,1.0,11/22/2015,"This place is a wreck. I waited an hour to be seated and the food was warm, not even hot and the prices are sky high. Last time I ever go there."
Ray C.,"Mary Esther, FL",0,60,85,3.0,6/7/2014,I used to really enjoy The Cheesecake Factory but they have become so focused on creating profit that they have taken away from a great experience.  Tables are too close to each other to the point that it's awkward and uncomfortable.  At the 2-top tables you might as well be sitting with the people to your left and right. Then there's the price.  We ordered 2 sandwiches and shared a dessert and the bill was $40.   The meal and the experience were certainly not worth that.  The service was timely and friendly but the sandwiches were not hot.  Perhaps they sat in the queue waiting to be served for a bit.  It will probably be a long time before I'm back to give them another chance.  There are just too many other places that are better across the board.
Mike F.,"Longview, TX",19,55,1,3.0,1/2/2016,"I am not used to waiting an hour and a half to eat, and normally would not do it if it was not for a family outing. It was a week night and the place was packed, elbow to elbow standing around waiting. After being seating the service was good, Our waiter was very attentive and did a good job taking care of 5 adults and 2 teenagers. Everyone was pleased with their dinner. My major problem was value. $16.95 for a bowl of pasta is a bit on the expensive scale for me. If you want to go eat out at a nice restaurant and don't mind waiting and paying inflated prices then you will enjoy it here."
Marissa W.,"Kansas City, MO",104,61,157,4.0,7/11/2015,"Not bad for a chain! I've always had good service. It's great to come here for a couple small plates. I love the (not so) little house salad! The crab cakes and crab bites are also very good. For dessert I ALWAYS get the Tiramisu cheesecake, is the absolute BOMB. Try it!"
Shawn B.,"Kansas City, MO",105,465,357,4.0,7/9/2012,"We hadn't been here in a while so decided to check it out again for lunch.  I noticed they now have small plates, quite a variety too.  We ordered the Vietnamese Tacos off of that menu and then our regular orders of Shrimp Bistro (my fave) and burgers for the boys.  The tacos were very tasty, but could have had a higher quality of pork in them.  There were so many other flavors going on with it that the stringy, overcooked pork really didn't detract from it too much.  The Shrimp Bistro was excellent, as always.  I don't know how, but they seem to have the freshest tasting shrimp in that dish.  For the price, next time we are going to order several small plates and see how that goes. I do not eat the cheesecake here.  I guess I'm a cheesecake snob, but for a place to have it in their name you'd think it would be better than it is.  I have been spoiled by Eli's in Chicago, Claim Jumper's out west, and of course, my own."
Michele N.,"Seattle, WA",82,372,377,4.0,6/8/2014,"This is our ""go to"" dessert place on the Plaza and it has never disappointed. I can't imagine a cheesecake that isn't delicious. The fresh whipped cream on the side just adds bonus points. The coffee is good, not great, but that is ok since the dessert is soooo good. My review is strictly based on Cheesecake and I promise, it is all good!"
