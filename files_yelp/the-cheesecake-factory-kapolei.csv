Michael G.,"Kapolei, HI",345,17,10,5.0,1/7/2018,I have been there four different times since they opened and enjoyed each visit. The staff is friendly and professional.  The food was hot and tasty.  I recommend it highly! Yes there will be a long wait if you go with a large party during peak hours.
Jo Ann G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",143,236,227,4.0,1/6/2018,"Our first time dining at the new Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei and perhaps the new pasta I tried just wasn't the greatest for me, however the beets and goat cheese was delicious, and of course the honey oat bread is still my favorite! The dynamite shrimp is still a hit and we tried some new libations this time. I had the pineapple Moscow mule and hubby had the bourbon and honey and both were interestingly tasty! To end our night we took home a low carb cheesecake with strawberries and plowed through it leaving not even a crumb!  We drove to the mall and found plenty of good parking, checked in at front desk around 5:30pm on a Friday and was seated within 10-15 minutes, our host was very consistent and checked on us regularly. Refilling our waters and clearing our dishes. She was friendly and bubbly, and very informative about the menu items.  It was date night for us making use of Gift cards we received from family and friends and I must say, we enjoyed every bit of it!  We look forward to visiting again!"
Charlene A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,39,18,4.0,1/5/2018,"This is my third time here & I had a just okay experience  Chicken piccata was very good , chicken was tender My boyfriend had the rib steak ..cooked perfect Fried calamari was terrific  Our waitress Vanessa F was alright, not much to complain about  But if I have anything to complain about  The tables were very small  me an my boyfriend had to turn the tables sideways to fit the appetizer plate,  My diner & my BF diner plate . it was like puzzeling everything on the table a coffee cup , cup of water , an a cup of ice tea & 3 plates plus condiments  Without offering assistance in trying to make it all fit the person who brought out the food  ""the server"" had that oh well look an walked away then she came back an asked if i was ready for cheese now? The table didnt have a complete set of utensils , no butter knife , a spoon to stir my coffee  Even the table to my right , they were having the same issues with the utensil, both tables used a fork to butter the bread"
Ray B.,"Mililani, HI",7,51,167,4.0,1/5/2018,"I finally got a chance to come here about a month after opening. Horror stories of long wait times turned me off on the idea of coming any sooner. Well, this place is still pretty busy but it's a big restaurant that can accommodate indoor and outdoor dining. The only other Cheesecake Factory is in Waikiki and I'm pretty sure that one is worse when it comes to wait times.  There's plenty of parking at the mall so that isn't an issue. The restaurant is nicely decorated just like every other Cheesecake Factory. Standard setup with an open kitchen and a variety of cheesecakes behind the glass.  The menu is extensive. Probably too many choices as I was given 3 different menus. The main menu, a specialty menu, and the kids menu. If you haven't been here before it could be overwhelming and may take some time before you can figure out what you want. There's a lunch special menu tucked away in the main menu that's worth checking out.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp, and chicken taquitos. I asked that my taquitos come out with the rest of the food but that never happened. I was pretty much finished with my spaghetti by the time the taquitos came out. I never even touched it. Better communication next time hopefully. The chicken and shrimp felt like it needed more balance as it was too sweet. Maybe more cilantro. I thought the kids menu was a great deal. Good sized portions with a beverage included. Not to be outdone was the cheesecakes. There's a separate menu for that too. Lol. The hazelnut cheesecake was great. Not too sweet and served with whip cream.  Overall I'm glad to have access to a popular mainland restaurant. With good service and a reasonably priced menu, I'll be back.  For a discount don't forget to buy gift cards from the wholesale clubs and save $$$."
Amy M.,"Honolulu, HI",347,456,1951,5.0,1/3/2018,"I love love the Cheesecake Factory on the west side! From our last visit with takeout, I knew there were kinks that needed to be fixed. It was only a matter of time, and it never discouraged the hubs and I to revisit. This time it was New Year's Eve..... no wait and we were seated in a booth at 8:30pm. I couldn't believe it!!! The hubs and I were greeted by a polite, personable, and awesome waiter. Argh....I did not catch his name unfortunately. We started out with a whiskey smash for me, and bourbon with honey for him to celebrate. My drink was delicious and not too strong. I grew up on jack on the rocks lol. For appetizers it was stuffed mushrooms and fried cheese. Yummy and great starters! For our main course, I couldn't decide between the honey truffle chicken and chicken Madeira. Thankfully our waiter has tasted majority of the menu and swore that the truffle chicken would not disappoint. He was telling the truth, because it was unbelievable!! The battered chicken was seasoned and fried to perfection. It was crispy and tender with every bite. I though the bed of mash potatoes were delightful as well. Gosh talk about good comfort food! The asparagus was a nice touch of greens:) The hubs devoured the meatloaf entree and said it was better than mine;):::rollingeyes::: Lastly, for dessert it was raspberry cheesecake and I literally had to psychologically prepare my mind for my stomach to make room. Well it worked and we left Cheesecake Factory with a food coma:) We will be back!!!"
Heather S.,"Waipahu, HI",171,541,1281,4.0,1/4/2018,"Other than the one time we ordered take out, this is our first time sitting in at this location. The boyfriend and I came during lunch, not busy at all and therefore no wait time.  Once seated, we were quickly given water, bread and the menus. We both had a bit of difficulty in choosing what to eat because there were just so many options to choose from. We finally decided on the egg roll sampler and the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks for appetizers and for our entrees, the pasta da vinci and spicy meat pizza with mushrooms.  The egg roll sampler came with 4 different egg rolls: avocado, tex mex, salmon, and cuban. The sampler also came with 4 dipping sauces. The salmon egg roll I can do without. It had no taste and the sauce that came with it didn't make it taste any better. The cuban egg roll had the same problem, the meat just lacked flavor and actually went better with the dipping sauce that's suppose to be for the salmon egg roll. I've had the avocado egg roll before and loved it, but this time around it wasn't made too well. The tex mex was my favorite, it is very much like the egg roll you get at Chili's.  The truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks are a must! I just loved how right before you take a bite you get a strong aroma of truffle oil (I, personally, can't get enough of truffle oil). The cheese sticks are perfect as is that I found myself not needing to dip it into the marinara sauce it came with, which I feel overcomes the truffle oil.  Just like the avocado egg rolls, the pasta da vinci wasn't as flavorful as I remembered it to be. A little more chicken, onions, and mushrooms could probably do the trick. I was, however, impressed by the lunch portion (although it was mostly just pasta), which in my opinion could feed two people.  The spicy meat pizza (and added mushroom by request) was tasty but an item we would not order again. More cheese could have gone a long way and maybe if it is an option, order it with a thin crust instead. No complaints on the amount of meat the pizza was topped with, however.  We end our lunch with the Tiramisu cheesecake. It did not make my top three but is worth trying at least once. I would have liked more cocoa powder and no chocolate mousse topping.  Although there were some misses here and there, we will be back. There's just so much more to try!"
Kristin C.,"Mililani, HI",189,293,1419,5.0,12/27/2017,"Came here with a group of 15 people, staff was friendly as usual.  There was only 1 server to help us the entire time and she did an excellent job and was so attentive. I ordered the Chicken Riesling, the chicken was juicy and so tender.  The white wine sauce had some bacon and cream, but the sauce was still light and super flavorful.  The pasta however was a bit undone, it was difficult to swallow but still tasted good. I also tasted the steak diane, wish I ordered that dish instead.  The steak medallions were soft and tender, and the sauce was yummy.  It was served with a generous portion of real mashed potato that I wanted to devour from my neighbors plate. The Hershey chocolate cheese cake was super rich, just a small sliver of it was satisfying.  And the red velvet, always a favorite of most people I know, it is cheesecake to savor for sure."
Mika G.,"Kailua, HI",70,51,143,3.0,12/20/2017,"I have been on a diet since March. I was looking forward to my birthday dinner here last week for the better part of this entire year. The last time I went to a Cheesecake Factory was within the first few years of its Waikiki location opening. I don't know if it was sub par because that's how it is or because I hyped it up to much. Either way I think their menu is too extensive to have great quality control. Service was average. Nothing really wrong with my server other than he was a soft talker. The restaurant was already loud and I have 3 kids 6 and under with me. In the beginning he was almost annoyingly attentive but that did taper off as the dinner rush came in (we started at 5...on a Wednesday).  Ambiance- it is kept way too dim for dinner time. Usually restaurants do that to lighting to create a more intimate setting so that you spend more. The restaurant is already too loud for that so the lighting Just makes it hard to read the menu.  Food- appetizers are better than dinner. Dinner I could probably make at home. Which was disappointing to me because the descriptions of each dish make it sound really good but when it comes it is not plated nicely and tastes basic-ish.  Dessert- the only reason to actually eat here. Godiva flourless Cheesecake is always my go to. The hazelnut cheesecake was to creamy with not enough crunch as the menu indicates and my husband bombed on his choice of cookie dough cheesecake. The real winner though is the brownie sundae. 3 dense brownies, 2 scoop ice cream, and whip cream with chocolate syrup. Clearly my 4 year old made the best choice. I do want to try more cheesecakes though.  One thing that was weird was that they were many other birthdays happening around me. I know this because the staff brought a cheesecake with a candle, and everyone sang Happy Birthday. I think at least 3 other having a birthday around me. I was wearing a Lei, a Lei po'o, was reading birthday cards and opening gifts... all at my table. And my waiter told me Happy Birthday as we left. But I got no cake and candle or happy birthday sang to me.... it was just a little odd..."
William G.,"Honolulu, HI",751,181,79,3.0,1/4/2018,"""The wait is about 1 hour!"" Ok, I've heard horror stories about the wait exceeding 2 hours. So, 1 hour? Not bad right? Wrong! When you're hangry and need food ASAP, that's the last statement you want to hear.  Due to the long wait times I decided to order and pick up. Luckily, they were open on Christmas Day because I was starving. I called and placed my order and was asked if I wanted to do curbside or walk in. I opted for curbside.  When I pulled up to curbside I was greeted by cars parked in the assigned stalls. Only one car was picking up food while the others were parked! So I found a stall and decided to walk in.  When you enter the doors you are greeted by not so friendly staff. They just fake smile and make you stand in line. The host stand is positioned horribly! If the line is long it'll literally go out the door. It blocks the counter for take out orders.  Anyways, I picked up my food and took it home to eat. I ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 cheesecake slices. My total was about $75. The portions are HUGE. The quality of the food was basic. Nothing extravagant.  It was an ok experience."
Mel B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",345,601,5729,4.0,11/30/2017,"#112 of 2017 After gorging ourselves to lunch we decided it wasn't enough certainly room for dessert.  It was busy but we weren't in a rush to go nowhere.  We decided to sit in the bar area because we felt it would easier to get a table.  About 45 minutes later, I believe, we did.  So be prepared and have plenty of patience.  We got a table in between the bar and the booths.  We appropriated extra chairs to squeeze our group around the table.  I was left standing but didn't mind at all. I can't help compare  this location to Waikiki.  This feels much better.  First, the lighting is brighter using more natural light.  Some areas are tight but there are clear paths to walk to get to certain areas.  I don't have to step  aside as much to let the staff get through.  I feel it's better to let them go first.  The large bar areas is much appreciated that offers booth and high round tables with bar stools for 4.  We managed to squeeze 7.  Coupled with the easy parking, this location, hands down is more laid back conforming to our island way of life. We were lucky to get Alicia Keys (not really) who was like a splash of hot coffee in our faces.  Can we do that again?  She is a high octane adrenalin rush of freshness bringing smiles out of all of us.  I don't need to come back just for the food. She made it easy to set our order on what decadent cheesecakes to sink our teeth into.  Tuxedo for chocolate.  A rich decadent thick chocolate.  I can eat some if this but the richness is overwhelming.  Banana Creme was accented with caramel crunch that paired well with the bananas.  Now my favorite Dulce de Leche is creamy silky smooth that pushed my delicious button hard.  Oh so good.  I think I ate most of it.  lol Great company.  Delicious cakes. Mix that up with the darlin' Alicia Keys and you got nothing but sweetness.  Ready for 2nds."
Holly B.,"Honolulu, HI",125,965,312,4.0,12/30/2017,"Located in the new Ka Makani Alii Shopping Center in Kapolei, the Cheesecake Factory is busy like the restaurant in Waikiki, but the wait is not nearly as long. The waitstaff are cheerful and friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and beet and goat cheese salad as appetizers before getting to our main entrees. The bang bang chicken and shrimp was good though not much shrimp in the dish. Love the refillable lemonade. Too stuffed to enjoy dessert, but definitely will be back again!"
Justin C.,"Honolulu, HI",364,381,265,4.0,12/6/2017,Be sure to get in line early so that you can avoid the long wait that can usually happen. There is a lot of seating inside and outside but that fills up quickly.   The service is really good and they are very attentive. Our  waitress was really funny and gave some good recommendations about the menu. I was very surprised by the waffle and chicken and poached eggs. It sounded like a very odd combination but the chicken was nicely breaded so it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It really complimented the waffle when you added the syrup. There was no end to the delicious sourdough bread and rye bread that they served.
Lyla D.,"Honolulu, HI",541,1010,13784,4.0,11/25/2017,"This review is for their bar area only. After being stuffed full at Sura Hawai'i II, we still found room in our stomachs to have dessert.  Ahem, isn't there some saying that goes like this ""There's always room for dessert""?  Oops, that was for Jell-O!  Anyway, since we were out at Ka Makana Ali'i, we finished our day with dessert. Our group of 7 people got a pager from TCF's host but stood in line patiently for a table to open at the bar.   The turnover at the bar is usually quicker than in the dining room so we planned on returning the pager as soon as we got a table in the bar.  Most of the bar tables seat 4 but we were seated at a high-top so we were able to grab 2 unused chairs while one person volunteered to stand.   We probably waited about 30 minutes until a table opened and we converged like vultures.   We were immediately greeted by vivacious Alicia S, who joked that we could remember her name by thinking of singer-songwriter Alicia Keys.  Wow!  Alicia's outgoing personality and cheerful smile was so genuine and comforting.  She brought us menus, water and took our beverage orders.  We told her that we were planning on ordering cheesecakes but their menu is so varied that it would take us a few more minutes.  With that in mind, Alicia asked us 3 questions concerning our flavor preferences.     - Chocolate?    - Fruit?    -Sweet/caramelly? With those questions, she helped us narrow down our cheesecake choices to Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, Fresh Banana Cream and Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecakes.    Each slice of cheesecake was dense, flavorful, silky, creamy and oh so rich!      We knew that we wouldn't be disappointed with their delicious cheesecakes but having a positive and energetic server like Alicia S made our experience worth repeating."
Elizabeth M.,"Honolulu, HI",113,237,240,5.0,12/28/2017,"I do enjoy going to the Cheesecake Factory once in a while, but I am usually not willing to wait in the insane Waikiki lines. When we heard that a second location was opening, we definitely wanted to check it out after the initial excitement and overcrowding had subsided a bit. After catching a movie next door, we headed over for dinner and saw that there was a pretty sizable line. Undeterred, we decided to see if any seats were available at the bar and found a nice open area at the end. They even placed cloth napkins on the countertop for us.  The bartender gave us both menus, or should I say a giant stack of menus! I am amazed that a restaurant can function with such an expansive menu. If someone can't find something that they will eat, then I have no idea what would make them happy.  After we ordered, they brought us bread to munch on while we waited. The food was brought out promptly. I ordered two of the wrap appetizers from the ""skinny"" menu and they were delicious. I loved the salmon in the fried wrap and the shrimp was fresh in the spring roll. I would order both of these again for sure.  The service was great throughout the visit. The bartenders checked on us frequently to make sure we were enjoying everything. It looks like they have ample servers to meet the huge diner demand. Again, I'm amazed that the kitchen can handle such a huge menu and get out dishes so quickly. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Kapolei!"
Will C.,"Kapolei, HI",72,61,63,3.0,12/28/2017,"We were lucky enough to be seated without a wait a little before noon on a Saturday.  Everyone must've been busy getting in their last minute shopping. The food was good, the service was good.  I don't mean to be that guy, but the menu is toooo overwhelming.  I like choices, but a 20 page menu...overkill.   We shared the avocado egg rolls.  I'm an avocado fan so that helped.   They are different from your typical egg roll, and I would definitely order them again, I just wish it was a little more crunchy.  After what seemed like 20 minutes of perusing the menu I decided on the pasta napolitana.  It was a mix of a garlic cream sauce and tomato sauce on a bed of fettuccine.   Considering all of the other choices in the area, I'd rather suggest somewhere else in the mall."
Gabby T.,"Honolulu, HI",56,67,222,5.0,11/25/2017,"As a HUGE fan of the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory I was hesitant to try this new location. We waited for maybe ten minutes on Saturday around 230pm I visited this location today with five friends and every one raved about their meal.  The ingredients are fresh and portions are well sized.  If you are a mashed potato fan like myself, make sure to order these if the do not come with your meal. Oh yeah!  Ok so everything we ordered was seriously good today.  Deivan was our server and an absolute joy. He was attentive and personable. I wish I could have someone like him in every restaurant I visited.  We had such a great experience which was especially wonderful as it was my friends birthday."
Gabrielle C.,"Pearl City, HI",197,103,642,4.0,11/19/2017,"Finally the hype is dying down as we came to this location for the first time with NO WAIT! Say whaaaat!?!?! Lol. We came on a Saturday around 1pm in the afternoon. There was unbelievably no wait and we were greeted and seated right away.  Everyone was welcoming and friendly which is a good first impression. This location is obviously smaller than the Waikiki location but a good thing is that it is part of Ka Makana Ali'i mall with free parking!  Being regular customers over the past few years at cheesecake in Waikiki (coming like 1-3 times a year Lol, nothing to crazy), we knew what we all wanted to order and were familiar with the menu items and it's flavors. We've all had our appetizers salads, and main entrees. One complaint and reason for the 4 star rating was the wait for the food. The restaurant wasn't quite as full or busy but the wait for the food took a bit and we were not updated on the wait time at all. Also, we had to constantly look for our waitress or someone whenever we wanted something whether it was more bread, a straw, questions, etc. I do understand it is a new staff and restaurant so I won't be to harsh but 40 minutes for food wait? Ahh. Not to sure about that. However when we did get our food, it was all so delicious!!! My mom couldn't stop talking about how perfectly cooked and tender her steak Diane was. My dad couldn't stop talking about how filling and fresh the ahi poke was (comes on wonton and salad as an appetizer dish). My grandma was impressed with all the food presentations. My boyfriend was impressed how flavorful his shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo was along with the cesear salad we both shared (excellent portion as well!). And although I ordered the Kalua Pig nachos for myself, the whole table couldn't stop picking off my plate to have some! Service and wait time could improve as I have observed the staff was all over the place but the food itself was excellent. Also loved the fact I noticed all table were organized and spot clean. We'll be back definitely. Can't go wrong with this location!"
Derek N.,"Honolulu, HI",87,30,84,3.0,11/20/2017,"The food here just doesn't really compare to the Waikiki branch, which I'm going to be comparing it to. The wait was just as long and wasn't really worth it. The decor reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory in California, and it's moderately lit inside compared to the Waikiki branch. I ordered my current go-to, the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. My girl ordered her go-to, the Chicken Madeira. First off, the flavors from my Farfalle and her Madeira was off from our usual. The Farfalle's flavors were dull and restrained, and the chicken was overcooked and tough. The Madeira Gad this cloying sweet taste to the sauce and seemed extra wine-y. The service was really though. The wait for the food took longer than usual, but our server was very attentive and on point the whole night.  Food 3/5 Service 4/5 Overall 3.5/5"
Lorilynn L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",150,241,139,4.0,11/20/2017,"I must say, The Cheesecake Factory has definitely redeemed itself tonight. I walked into a Hostess that was more than friendly, she acknowledged us as soon as we entered. She was helpful and friendly and we felt very welcome. We were immediately see that, although it was a non peak-hour, the service was nothing short of excellent. We were seated in a comfortable spot, and our server came almost immediately to provide us with excellent service. She was friendly and catered to my little granddaughter immediately. We ordered our drinks and appetizer immediately and the food came out right away, tasty guacamole with very crispy and delicious chips. We were also served bread and butter with our advertisers and this bread was splendid. It wasn't long before we we gave our order to the server, and soon thereafter are piping warm food started pouring out of the kitchen. I ordered the New York steak with mashed potatoes and green beans and it was very delicious. The food came out in generous portions, and appropriately warm with a haunting aroma. I love how our drinks were refilled often and without reminder. Highlight of the night was the s'mores Galore cheesecake. It was perfect, it was stupendous, a small Slice of Heaven. Suffice it to say that Cheesecake Factory Kapolei has definitely redeemed itself for my previous review. I enjoyed every single bite of it. Ambiance perfect, wait staff attentive, food delicious, service on point. Overall experience, two thumbs up."
Mahj F.,"Ewa Beach, HI",98,81,224,5.0,1/7/2018,"My experienced here was amazing, seated less than what we were told . Then we had to switched from outdoor to indoor seating, hunter was so awesome, and willingly found us a new seating arrangement..He even gave us an awesome idea of what he recommend for us to order. Good job Hunter in knowing your menu. Alyssa, who was our server, gave her 100% customer service . She also knows her menu, especially the drink menu.Btw flying gorilla drink was a seller, it is crossed between chocolate and banana shake, yummo!!!we had ordered 3 different items: chicken fettuccini, chicken wrap,and breakfast sandwich that I can't remember lol.. manager Stephanie, walked by and assured us that they are making our meal. So she offered to give us another round of bread. Austin, our pepper and permasan grater was also awesome! He was cool, rode along when I asked him to put pepper on my friends hair lol. Good sense of humor  Austin ..all in all my experience her was above and beyond my expectation...good job everyone!!!"
Krystal Y.,"Honolulu, HI",134,144,45,5.0,12/25/2017,"Mmmmmm what's NOT good here?! When is it NOT busy? This Kapolei location is BOOMING. Everywhere. There are so many options to dine at, but Cheesecake Factory has to be my favorite! We went on a Sunday, at 5:30pm & parking is hard to find but we got lucky because the change of shift workers were leaving and so you can score some behind Cheesecake Factory around that time!  We were seated 10 minutes later -- we didn't have a preference and were seated outside. I actually would prefer outside more because outside can get pretty LOUD. Outside was perfect. We were seated in front of the stage by the door. Score! Because there was live music that night :) Kona played. Well done and great songs. Okay, and so for the food. I love cheesecake factory because ANYONE can find something they like. The menu is HUGE. Pasta, pizza, chicken, steak, salad....whatever!! We got the zucchini sticks and crab dip to start it off! Awesome!!!!! I got the steak and shrimp Diane. Delish! I can't stray away from that dish because whatever they make their sauce in for the shrimp is YUM. And then the cheesecake. I'm simple -- strawberry. Mmmmm. So light and yet so heavy and delicious. And our service? Impeccable. I don't remember her name, shame on me. But she's from Puerto Rico. And transferred for a couple of months to help out. But wow, if anyone's smart, they'd keep her. Promote her. Her customer service was awesome!"
Haikela M.,"Honolulu, HI",101,131,316,5.0,11/20/2017,The service at the cheesecake factory is much much better! I've never really had a problem with any cheesecake factory but this one in Kapolei really want above and beyond when it comes to their service! This will be my new favorite spot!  We ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp dish and the soup and salad lunch combo. The portions are huge! Even though it was lunch menu!  They catered to my kids way better than any restaurant we have been to. They offered a special appetizer just for them which was bananas and bread. The other cheesecake factory in Waikiki has never done that and we have been there a couple times with the kids. This one really stepped up!
Aggie C.,"Kapolei, HI",528,278,2406,5.0,10/27/2017,"You really can't go wrong with a place that has ""cheesecake"" in its name. Seriously.  I've been here a couple of times already. Service has been on great on all occasions! Cheesecake Factory knows how to keep the service and food quality consistent no matter which location you go to.  This location has PLENTY of free parking as it is part of Kamakana Alii in Kapolei. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I still have yet to try their happy hour, but for sure lunch and brunch have been great.   Food is always awesome here. They also have a variety of things to choose from. My kids usually get the pastas. My husband always get a chicken dish. Then there is me. I always choose something different. Lately I've been choosing the new skinnylicious options and the new appetizers. So as you can see, you can bring anyone here and they will love the food!  Some of my faves: The sweet tamales corn cakes. So darn amazing. I didnt even know i loved tamales until I had this.  Korean fried cauliflower. Don't be fooled because it's a vegetable. It was crispy, seasoned with korean tangy flavors and at one point I thought it was chicken.  Skinnylicious morracan chicken. Ok i don't remember the name, but whatever that chicken dish was, it was amazeballs. It just goes to show the flavor isn't gone when you watch what you eat.  Honey truffle chicken. Honestly can't go wrong with anything that says truffle in it. Sweet, crispy and savory. Overall, this is becoming a frequent spot for me and the family. We love the variety of food options, the service and it's location!"
Trish I.,"Ewa Beach, HI",56,93,373,4.0,11/7/2017,"I've been here for both lunch and dinner.  The times I've come for lunch, the wait time has been little to none.  Dinner, on the other hand, is a whole different story.  Wait times came be as little as 25 min.  to as long as 2 hrs.   The restaurant is spacious, you have a choice to be seated right away (if you want to eat at the bar, or outside) or wait to eat inside.  I don't like sitting outside because it does get hot, but I would give the bar a try if it was just the hubby and I and there's a wait.   They have lunch specials available for a good price and it is a generous portion!  I've already tried the parmesan crusted chicken and pasta di vinci and loved it.  For dinner, I've tried the truffle honey chicken and bacon bacon cheeseburger.  Everything is delicious, it just depends on what yuou feel like eating at the time. My husband was looking forward to the shrimp scampi and steak Diane because the first time he ordered it, they sold out.  (The server jokingly said that we she got hired, they were told that they will never run out of food---and she continued by saying that they are always running out of something, lol) When he finally got to order it, he was utterly disappointed.  For $24, you get 3 pcs. Of U-10 shrimp in a beurre blanc sauce and 4 oz. Of steak medallions with mushrooms in what tasted like  red wine demi-glace.  Although the flavor was there, the small portion does not justify the cost.  Sadly enough, he left  starving! The many times I've been there, I have yet to taste the cheesecake!  But then again, I hardly ever get appetizers or desserts because the entrees always fill me up.    The cheesecake display is located to the right of the entrance, and if you are just looking for just dessert, you can just order it to go.  Slices of cheesecake can run you $7.50-$8.50."
Lauren M.,"Honolulu, HI",404,87,132,5.0,11/6/2017,"Pastas galore to choose from, but don't be mistaken... the filet mignon is to die for. I literally cut it with a butter knife. The mashed potatoes were like home maid, the perfect texture. They did perfectly with the asparagus too... cooked just right! We also got the dynamite shrimp and the ahi salad. It was amazing. And the BREAD DONT FORGET was amazing. Yum. We also tried the cheesecake factory cabernet which was delightful. For dessert we got the celebration cheesecake because why not it's date night?!  The wait was long but isn't it always for this place? Did I mention they also had live music?! and did I mention we didn't have to drive to waikiki and deal with...well...waikiki! Major win! My favorite thing too was how genuinely nice and kind each staff was. Especially our server who recommended the steak. Good job! Wish I knew his name to give a shout out! I love Ka Makana Alii so much! Best, cutest mall and Cheesecake Factory ever."
Marie C.,"Honolulu, HI",266,109,450,4.0,10/16/2017,"First experience here was great. Came in around noon and my party of 2 did not have to wait. All the food came out with the right order. No complications! Our server was great and she was nice and friendly. The second time we came here, about a week after, not sure why this keeps happening, but I ordered the Jamaican shrimp and they brought my dish out with chicken. I don't eat meat, otherwise I wouldn't. Have minded. The server didn't see my food come to the table and said that, ""Your food isn't ready yet."" Long story short, the order kept messing up. They said I could have a complimentary cheese cake, but I was going to the movies after and I don't live in this area. The server was really nice and apologetic. I know it was not her fault. I feel that this is still a new restaurant and everyone is trying to get the flow of things. Otherwise the food was good and the wait was only an hour, for how crowded it was."
Celestine V.,"Honolulu, HI",491,300,1020,5.0,10/16/2017,"It feels a little ridiculous writing a 5 star review for the Cheesecake Factory, but this being the 4th or 5th one I've visited has definitely outperformed them all. The first thing that probably needs to be addressed is the wait - surprisingly quick if you're open to sit anywhere and come late enough (around 9:30pm on a Sunday), and that includes the bar, which we did in our second trip, and got us out with a to-go order in 30 minutes tops. Pretty much every Cheesecake Factory has a wait, so it's to be expected. First of all, the menu is touted to be the most extensive of all Cheesecake Factories (including Waikiki), and my waiter was so incredibly optimistic and passionate about everything, I almost had a hard time deciding. She was incredibly sweet though, and despite a busy opening season, was on top of all of her tables and never once lost her cheery demeanor.  On top of this, we only got light meals, given that we had just come from another gathering, but still left full and satisfied, and I even had leftovers in hand. We started with a Cucumber Lemonade and Raspberry Lemonade - the former has become my favorite drink, and I don't believe it was on the menu at any other locations I've seen. After that, we got Avocado Toast as an appetizer, and I must say, this dish changed my life. I feel like it's such a millennial thing to say, but I'd come back for that alone, and I would love to figure out how to make it because it's that phenomenal.  He got the Skinnylicious chicken tacos and I got a side of mac n cheese (that's 2 meals worth if you eat conscientiously), both viable options. Of course we ended off the meal with Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake for him, and I opted for Linda's Chocolate Cake (because what's life if you're not going against the grain, right?), both were delicious, and I definitely had leftovers of my cake for the next day as well. It was a great chocolate fix, not too rich, but just good enough. The check was to be expected as well, Cheesecake Factory is fairly pricey, and in Hawaii even worse, but if you find something that's good enough there, it feels worth it."
Chris K.,"Waipahu, HI",365,60,47,2.0,12/17/2017,"This was a really horrible experience. Got there at around 5:20 pm on a Saturday, parking lot was really crowded and they had a 40 minute wait. Both are expected as it is holiday season so no biggie. They were actually really on time with their estimate and got the buzz around 6:10. Sat down, ordered...then proceeded to wait 50 minutes for our food. That is so unacceptable!!!  I ordered the chicken club with avacado and their bread was so greasy with butter it made it hard to eat. The chicken was so thick along with the tomatoes and spry letteuce that made it difficult to enjoy. Everything was falling out everywhere, I didn't even finish it was so unappetizing. Their bread is really good...that is the only nice thing I can say. Well their ceasar salad was good too but it was served in this bowl that was very rounded everywhere so when ever you tried to pierce some greens it went all off to the sides and spilled out of the bowl.  Our server didn't even come to ask how the food was. I had a 7:45 movie showing so we asked for the check right after our food and left after we finished."
Ariel N.,"Kapolei, HI",180,100,547,5.0,10/27/2017,"Finally was able to try this location since it's closer to home! My friend and I had waited in line near opening time for about 15-20 minutes. The tables outside were pretty much open and this line was just to get our names down, so we understood that it was going to take some time for everyone to get settled in. But when we got to the front of the line, we were told to wait about 30 minutes for an inside table or go straight outside (we, of course, didn't want to sit in the hot). So we decided upon the open bar! -- Best idea ever! There was no wait and got served immediately by our bar hostess! Service was A+! Although I didn't get our waitress'/bartender's name, she certainly made our day! Always re-filling our bottomless plantation iced tea and making sure we had what we needed. She was also more than happy to split of bill and give us to-go cups for our drinks! I ordered the seafood gumbo which is my go-to favorite dish. Right amount of spicy heat, white rice, and lots of seafood and sausage. My friends and I also shared the Chinese chicken salad which has become my go-to salad dish! It had crunch won-tons and noodles on top!  Can't wait to to be come here again!"
Tawny H.,"Honolulu, HI",148,103,310,5.0,10/17/2017,"My friend and I stood in line for about 15 minutes during lunch time to get a table. When we got to the front, they told us we could sit outside now or wait 30 minutes for an indoor table. We noticed the bar top was open and opted to sit there. The service was great. Our bartender was friendly and patient. I loved the gumbo and the lunch salads are HUGE. We were able to take home gumbo and salad for another meal! We will definitely be back again and will go directly to the bar the next time to avoid the lines."
Robyn F.,"Honolulu, HI",4,44,113,3.0,10/30/2017,"My beloved Cheesecake Factory. We frequent the restaurant at least 3-4 times a month (that's about once a week) and every time, there has been some sort of mistake or issue. We let it slide the first few times because it's new but it seems as if they would have gotten a lot better since the Grand Opening.  We went on Sunday afternoon and the wake was about 50mins. We were happy when our table was ready in about 40mins. After being seated we were served cold hard bread. It was literally rock hard to the point that it just crumbled in to crispy crumbs all over our table when we tried to break it in half. We requested for warm bread to be brought out and of course the bread came after our appetizer.  My husband and I have ordering down to a science to get our meal in a timely fashion. As soon as we sit down and are greeted by our waitress, we place our drink AND appetizer order. That way it's already cooking and being prepped when the waitress comes back to take our entree order. When the waitress comes back with our drinks we go ahead and order our entree and our dessert to go. Lastly, when our entree/dessert comes out we ask for our check before we even start eating. It's a little aggressive but ordering this way ensures that our meal doesn't take forever and a day to arrive and we're not eating idly for our food/check/dessert. We learned the hard way our first time when our meal (from being seated to waking out the door) took over 2.5 hours for just 2 people.  Food: Buffalo blasts and the Bellagio Pasta-5stars everything was hot and fresh Cheesecake: Adams Cheesecake 3stars. This by far is my favorite cheesecake but the portion size was so small compared to what I'm used to? Not sure if I got a slimy slice or what but the manager made me feel as if I was crazy when I told her that the portion size seemed smaller than usual.  Overall they are getting better. We always love the food but we've never had an experience where everything was great from the bread to dessert or from service/speed/accuracy. Of course we'll be back though!"
Tami M.,"Honolulu, HI",152,159,679,5.0,10/10/2017,"First of all, I was expecting this visit to be a bit chaotic since they've been open for less than a month. We pulled in the parking lot to find a line wrapped around the building. We decide to give it a try anyway. The doors open at 1130 and people began being seated. I'd say the worst part about the line was having to listen to the people behind me constantly complain about the heat and the long line. A mere 30 minutes after getting in line, we were comfortably seated at our table. Not a bad wait at all! Our server was super attentive and friendly. She immediately brought bread and water to our table. She kept our water and soft drinks full and checked on us often. She definitely made my first impression of the restaurant a positive one.  Now for the food! We ordered the spicy ahi Tempura Roll and calamari to start. The portions were very generous and both really tasty. For entrees, I ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta. It was delish!! The shrimp were lightly bartered and cooked perfectly!! My friends got a Loco Moco and fish and chips. I didn't get a taste of their entrees but I didn't here any complaints so I'm sure they enjoyed it.  Of course I can't come to the Cheesecake Factory without eating CHEESECAKE! I got the Resess peanut butter cheesecake and the slice was ENORMOUS! It was layers of chocolate cake, cheesecake and creamy peanut butter goodness. I was in cheesecake heaven!  Im surprised at how great the service was and how fast our food came out even though we all basically sat at the same time! Excellent organization and training! I'll definitely be back to this location!"
Janelle N.,"Ewa Beach, HI",97,113,567,4.0,10/28/2017,"If you want to avoid the wait time just order takeout over the phone and pick it up by the front cheesecake counter. I've heard stories of friends waiting 4 hours overall for a table and food although it was a few weeks after opening. It was basically 2 hour wait for a table, 1 hour for food and 1 for dessert/check. Currently they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait especially if you have a larger party. Going later in the evening might decrease the wait time as they are open until midnight. Closer to ten, it took about 15-20 min for a party of 2. The overall look of the restaurant has a Las Vegas hotel feel to me. The pillars remind me of ceasars palace and the other interior of the Paris. We got seated in one of the two seated booths. The menu is hugeeee. There are so many options so good luck trying to pick an item. We decided to share to appetizers which were the skinnylicious salmon rolls and truffle bacon cheese sticks.  Skinnylicious? Is that even a word? It was posted throughout the menu and honestly made the items seem less appealing. I was confused how the salmon rolls were in that category as they were in a deep fried wrapper. The truffle bacon cheese sticks were essentially grilled cheese sticks coated with truffle oil and marinara sauce on the side. The tastes wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't unique or worth the price. The marinara also greatly overpowered the cheese sticks itself. The salmon rolls on the other hand were great. It was essentially salmon and spinach deep fried in a lumpia wrapper with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Onto dessert, we got the tuxedo cream cheesecake and Oreo cream cheesecake. The Oreo one was super good! The Oreo one trumped the tuxedo one by far. The tuxedo cheesecake had a chocolate cheesecake with a vanilla mousse while the Oreo one had a chocolate cheesecake with oreo mousse and tons of Oreo cookie bits. The whipped cream itself on the cheesecakes were a bit excessive but they do make pics look more appetizing. I will probably be back to try more cheesecake flavors."
Cat B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",226,108,483,4.0,10/27/2017,"Walk right in and seated immediately at 12:15pm on a Wednesday!! Imagine that?!?! LOL!  And a window seat no less! The hostess said that the opening rush definitely calmed down a little, but they are still super busy after 4pm.  Drink: Georgia Peach- was the cutest little thing. Well, little as in short and stout that packs a punch! So pretty and sooooooo goooood!! LOVED IT! Sweet Corn tamales- always great. Though not quiet as dense as I've had in the San Diego location. Ya'll figure that one out! Haha ;) Calamari- always great! Light, crispy, good Shrimp Scampi- sooo my husband was kinda mad and felt like they shorted him on the pasta. There was ample shrimp, but ill have to agree that the amount of pasta was not enough to have with the amount of shrimp. Its kinda funny though, most places will fill the entree with pasta and have just a few shrimp. It was the opposite here. Another thing, the shrimp itself, seemed fried with a very light batter with lots of spices. Love it or hate it, I didn't love it.  Shepherd's Pie- It was tasty, but very very oily. I even took a napkin to it to absorb the oil, but the oil kept coming. I ended up asking the server to take it back. She kindly did so and asked if I wanted them to remake it, but not as oily. I declined and asked for Shrimp with Angel Hair.  Shrimp with Angel Hair- not good. The shrimp looked like it was drenched in black pepper seasoning. And now the pasta was too dry as if they put no oil on it. LOL! Too oily or no oil at all.  I didn't take it back, but wrapped it up for my teenager who eats anything!  Carrot Cake with coffee- So underrated as people gawk over the array of cheesecake, but thier carrot cake is always my first love. Pair with coffee, it's the perfect ending to a lunch date!  I typically don't prefer big conglomerates, but when I do go to one, CF is definitely one that I frequent. I have been coming to CF for many years and in all different cities like in New Jersey, San Diego and Hawaii. I have come to learn over the years that they have the best drinks and appetizers- never fails. That said, I have yet to find a main entree that I like. Today's visit, being no exception.  All in all, even with the 2 entrees that bombed today, I'm still rating them 4 stars. The service was super friendly, professional, and accommodating without judgement! And that there my friends is what brings people like me back! Aloha!"
Jam A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",460,144,1371,4.0,10/2/2017,"Delicious food, delicious drinks, lots of yummy desserts to choose from. They have a lean menu and a variety of scrumptious Salad. My go to, is the Jamaican peppers shrimp. It comes with black beans with your choice of white or brown rice. A mango salsa and sweet plantains.    Our wait was about 45 minutes, which is kind of normal for cheesecake factories. You can sit at the bar if there's available seating, it's first come first serve.  The service was excellent, our food was fast. And I am happy that there is the cheesecake factory close by. My husband and I are cheesecake lovers. We tried the macadamia nut cheesecake, which is my favorite and then we tried the chocolate peanut butter.  Another one of my favorites is the red velvet cake. Mental note, the cake  has half the calories of the cheesecakes."
Amber B.,"Kapolei, HI",112,22,60,5.0,1/6/2018,"Came here for appetizers and cheesecake! I love that this place is open til midnight because it's one of the only places in the kapolei area that I would want to eat at that late. The server que was awesome. He had a lively personality. The wait was short and it's not as crowded as the one in Waikiki. I had the loaded baked potatoe tater tots, Oreo cheesecake and tiramisu! So awesome and highly recommended. The desserts are huge btw."
Terri P.,"Honolulu, HI",55,77,144,5.0,10/21/2017,"Finally made it to Cheesecake Factory today. My husband and I came five minutes before they opened today and there was a line but it moved fairly quickly and we got seated within ten minutes. When we left the restaurant an hour later, there was still a line at the front door and the restaurant looked very busy.  The menu is vast, with our waiter telling us there's over 250 items inclusive to the drinks and cheesecake. I settled with the grilled chicken w/ avocado club sandwich and my husband got the carne asada medallions. The food is great quality for a chain restaurant, in my opinion, way better than Ruby Tuesdays or Applebees. On Saturday and Sundays there's a brunch menu, something I want to try next time I come back. I was so full we took cheesecake to go.  Service was impeccable and friendly, from the hostess to the wait staff. My hubby enjoyed the service so much he left a twenty five percent tip.  It is a little pricey, but it's a good place to go every now and then, especially with the vast menu items. Can't wait for my next visit!"
Nat W.,"Kapolei, HI",241,1882,1401,4.0,12/2/2017,"I finally got to try this newly opened Cheesecake factory in Kapolei.  The key is to go before 5pm to avoid a wait.  Plus they have lunch menu till 5pm too!   The atomasphere is cool and especially outside is nice, if it's not too hot.  They usually have a band playing for dinner time.   Our server was very nice and attentive.  The price was surpsingly about the same as on the mainland.   The food was not amazing but good.  Pretty consistent among all the other cheesecake factories.  Hopefully this craziness will die down soon."
Javier T.,"Honolulu, HI",3,97,75,5.0,12/14/2017,"Recently I took all my managers out to Cheesecake Factory, actually this past Tuesday. We had big table of 14, and our wait was ok, I came in early to wait for the table. They quoted me 1 hour and 20 minutes... understandable for a big table. So I sat and waited, amazingly it only took 45 minutes which is awesome! A few of us were there early so we sat and talked and waited for the rest. The server was awesome very helpful she obviously has handled big tables before. She took so many precautions to get WAY in front of orders and everything! Management was great! I wish I could tip the server more, but my company only allows for a certain percentage. All and all amazing experience anyone who wants to hit up Cheesecake Factory with a big group! DO IT!! They totally take care of you!!! Thanks!!!"
Laura M.,"Kapolei, HI",38,136,1634,5.0,9/26/2017,"I went on the opening day and had an amazing experience! I originally went to just get a cheesecake but since I had gone at a perfect time I waited. Hostess informed me 15 minute wait but actually got seated in 7 minutes. Water and bread came shortly after. The server was very knowledgeable as she informed me of menu options. I ordered and as I waited for my dinner any server walking by asked if I was doing okay or needed anything. Water continuously came and I was amazed at how attentive the severs were. My food came out in about 20 mins and it was plentiful and awesome. I could not finish it all and ended up boxing the rest for later.  I ordered the Celebration Cheesecake that took a little longer to get about 25 minutes due to the many in dining and to go dessert orders. I ordered 3 dessert items to go and was surprised to get it when my leftover cheesecake was packed. I honestly didn't expect to get in at all since it was their opening day but I was blessed! Would I go again most definitely the service, food and ambience was so worth it. Enjoy your experience when you go. It's the happening place right now that a lot of people outside of East Oahu have been waiting for."
