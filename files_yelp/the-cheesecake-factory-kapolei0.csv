Heavenly G.,"Waipahu, HI",2,11,3,5.0,9/24/2017,"Considering it's only been a week or two since their opening, the service was great! Came for dinner around 8ish and was told the wait would be 75-90 minutes. Unlike the Waikiki location, the front check-in desk wasn't packed and crowded, and we actually had benches with lots of space inside/outside for customers to wait.  We waited for only an hour until we were called, which is relative to the Waikiki location. Ordered the avocado egg rolls and fried mac n cheese balls, which I get all the time! Delicious! Also got the veggie burger and recess peanut butter cheesecake for dessert. The wait for the food was usual however we did get our complimentary bread awhile after our appetizers.  Our waitress Yanira was AMAZING! She was super sweet and apologetic for our bread taking too long and constantly reassured us that our food is on the way. She even asked us if we wanted to put in our order for our cheesecake early, because the wait for the bakery was 30 min. We ordered our dessert the same time as our entrees and it came out right on time! Definitely worth the wait and will be coming back :)"
Shilene D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",226,36,21,2.0,12/28/2017,"First visit my daughter ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo - it was clumpy & lumpy & tasted horrible - needless to say my daughter didn't eat it. I asked to speak to a manager to see what they would do (expecting to have it removed from my bill - since she didn't have but one bite, it was not) -- fast forward to Christmas day, thought I'd give them a second chance to turn the experience around. Again, asked to speak to a manager - told him about the previous visit & asked him to do what he could to turn it around & win us over. Gave him the date & time of our last visit & showed him my bank statement so he could research it - manager said he couldn't find it - at this point I said forget it, don't worry about it ( but really expecting that the manager would offer something, anything - Nope, he walked away and didn't bother to come back to check on us at all.)  Strike 2 - food is decent, I don't want to completely write them off but service is paramount in my book. I might give them one more chance to thrill me... but really really as someone who works in guest services I expect more."
Taira G.,"Waipahu, HI",0,1,4,4.0,10/22/2017,"I've always loved Cheesecake Factory since I was younger, but the only location available was Waikiki. But now that the restaurant opened another location in Kapolei, which is closer to my home, I was happy! Today, I went with my family and the wait was an hour but that's normal and actually good considering Cheesecake Factory being busy all the time. The service was great, our waitress, Nicole, was excellent! She didn't forget any of our needs and was nice. One reason why I took one star off is because when we received our food, my mom's food was cold(the last picture).... however, everyone else's food was warm-hot. All in all, good first time experience at the new Cheesecake Factory location!"
Sophie B.,"Katy, TX",286,15,2,5.0,9/30/2017,With all things considered I was very please with my experience. Came in around 8pm on a Friday it was about an hour wait. Great waitstaff even though it was very busy. Our complimentary bread was fresh and hot. I got the Cajun jambalaya pasta and the coffee and chocolate cheese cake. Food came out at a reasonable time and tasted fantastic. Our Waiter Makani was very attentive and overall gave us a really good experience. Thank you so much Cheesecake Factory!
Debra A.,"Pearl City, HI",1,50,141,4.0,9/28/2017,"First visit here. I've been to Waikiki location many times. Fortunate to meet Johnny from Downtown Las Vegas Cheesecake Factory! I'm impressed with Cheesecake Factory for ensuring excellent service during the opening and transition! Ample parking at Ka Makana Alii Mall. Sat within 20 minutes. Cool breezy lanai seating. Tried the fried calami and sample spring roll appetizers. Both were excellent. My usual fav Shepard's pie was excellent, as always!"
Jill N.,"Atwater, CA",37,45,10,4.0,12/27/2017,We went for my husbands birthday 12-19-17. We started off at the bar I had a drink Mango Eruption and we ordered crab cakes. Our party was still not all there so I ordered another drink Lava Flow and an appetizer Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes was different but tasty. We moved to our table of ten and had a fantastic meal I ordered the chicken pot pie was Ono. Grandkids ordered Mac n Cheese Bites and chicken strips n Fries they loved it. Son in-law ordered the rib eye my daughter ordered the bacon burger husband and son ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. My daughter ordered my husband a banana cream cheesecake n ice cream for his birthday and all the staff sang for him Happy Birthday. Definitely will be back again this is our second time here and we all got gift certificates for Christmas so we'll be back soon. The wait was no waiting we just needed our party to show up great staff and waiter.
Agbayani T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,4,2,2.0,10/20/2017,"Came here this week for lunch to buy some cheesecake slices and decided to order fish tacos and a spinach dip to go. It wasn't too busy at all. They took my order and I said I'll be sitting here waiting (bench near the door). 20 mins...no irder. I patiently waited over 30 minutes and still no order. Finally decided to remind them hey what's going on and they said oh sorry here's your order, we got busy taking other phone orders and forgot.  By the time I got my food the shell on the tacos was already soggy and the tempura fish on it was too. The dip had already gotten cold as well. They need to write something on the ticket that says the customer was a walk-in or give me one of those light alert thingies (idk wtf they're called) so they know the customer is there waiting, which I suggested but doubt they'll do.  The cheesecake slices seem smaller now...then again it's been awhile since I've been to the Waikiki location."
Rae B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",82,5,,2.0,1/2/2018,"I am only giving this a 2 star because food was good and manager Anne assisted us after  But the service was horrible!! First, we were served by a guy who was pushy and rude to my wife. He assumed what my wife would order so he went ahead and placed the order. Second he was impatient. He asked if we needed more time to look over drinks, we said no unfortunately to him 10 seconds was not enough for him to wait for our response so he fled to pick up drinks for another table. When we looked up to tell him what we wanted to drink he was gone! So thereafter we asked for a manager, this got worse!! The first manager was rude with attitude off the wide. "" Uh I'm always in the back and I know no one would do anything to your food"" oh really you're ALWAYS in the back watching over. No he was not able to take criticism like a real manager and deliver customer service. Bunch of back n forth, then we were seated in a different section  for a different server. Things looked better however my wife was very offended by our first server n manager. Kapolei cheesecake is 90% local not like Waikiki where it's 90% tourist. Serve and treat the locals with great service and deliver the best so we return!! Bad news travels faster than good news."
Chez T.,"Mililani, HI",0,27,6,4.0,10/9/2017,So this location is relatively new and they seem to be still working out some kinks. The wait for food was long but the service was excellent so I still gave them 4 stars. The wait was so long the waiter brought us bread 3 times and refilled my soda 3 times before the meal actually came. I was surprised at the wait considering we only ordered tacos and a pasta but the food was good. It was very busy and the bread was delicious so I would return ....maybe not at peak lunch hrs though! I'd probably go after 1:30pm to cutdown on wait time.
Marc F.,"Kapolei, HI",21,16,6,5.0,9/26/2017,Friendly staff.  Great food.  Highly recommended. It's still a bit on the busy side. Best to go earlier but don't go walking off  in the mall.  The pager doesn't reach that far.
Annabelle V.,"Ewa Beach, HI",14,4,9,5.0,9/23/2017,"I love to eat here not only the food here is delicious, it's also affordable. The service here is always excellent.  I'll surely coming back again."
Heather E.,"Kapolei, HI",5,37,28,4.0,11/22/2017,I've always loved The Cheesecake Factory!  This new location on the westside is great!  They tend to run out of a lot of things but thankfully they had my sisters favorite fried macaroni cheese balls this time!  I loved the cucumber lemonade.  Pretty stoked on the variety of vegan options as well!
Nicolette S.,"San Clemente, CA",186,1,,1.0,12/5/2017,We got seated after a 10 minute wait. Once we got seated we sat there and got absolutely no service (no drink order or anything) even though there was multiple tables around us getting service. During a weekday and it wasn't super busy so there was no excuse as to why we didn't get service. No body tried to solve the issue so we ended up leaving and going to Wendy's which is a across the street and it was a 100x better.
Lisiate H.,"Kapolei, HI",89,9,1,1.0,11/7/2017,"Not what I expected. Portions for appetizers and main meals were alright nothing to run to Mom about. They were out of ribeye steak, draft beers, regular bottle beers. My New York steak substitute was dry with no flavor and was not cooked to medium rare, it was almost well done. For a company that is suppose to be top notch wasn't even close. The Waikiki location is 10x better then this location. Will be going to CPK across the street on my next one."
Leanne H.,"Wahiawā, HI",95,14,10,4.0,10/2/2017,"First try at this new location. Already knew there was gonna be a cheesecake factory, my hubby drew the building so I was excited. Got there by 530 pm, didnt have to wait that long at all, although it was a Monday night. It is my birthday so I expected a wonderful dinner. Ambience was as expected, a little loud but nice. The hostess that seated us had a pleasant face, love the eye contact when greeting us. The waitress had a wonderful smile, great attitude & again eye contact was on point. The menu had lot of options especially their desserts. I had the eggplant parmigiana. First impression? Wow 3 huge pieces. The pesto pasta was just a bit dry, not much flavor, but amount of pasta was just right. Eggplant breading was slightly overcooked but loved it. My hubby had the chicken basil pasta. Portions was spot on, lot of flavor. My daughter had the mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. She love it, couldnt really give a review because all she said was ""it was good mom"".  The hostess came back to check on us, which was awesome. All in all, I thought my experience was fabulous. 4 out 5 and that was for my eggplant. I would go back.  Thank you to staff who made my irthday dinner wonderful!"
Chance C.,"Honolulu, HI",12,8,5,5.0,11/5/2017,"I am a longtime lover of The Cheesecake Factory.  My friend and I would wait for that hour and a half that it took to get a table in Waikiki. When I heard they were opening one in Kapolei I was so excited (to have another so that maybe the wait for either wouldn't be so long) I decided to wait til the ""newness"" of the Kapolei location to die down before heading over. Went on a Thursday around 10pm and yes..no line..we were shown to our table immediately. I love the dim lights and the atmosphere in there. Of course the fresh warm bread is always amazing and instead of my usual pasta, I decided to go with the Parmesan crusted chicken breast with mashed potatoes...AMAZING!!! Their food was always worth the wait..but now it seems the wait isn't a problem anymore! Yay!"
Charles W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,4,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Food we ordered there was not good, food lacked taste and service was very poor. Would not recommend this location, Waikiki is 100% better thus would be worth the drive"
Darin H.,"Aiea, HI",49,73,9,4.0,11/11/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory and have been to the one in Waikiki on several occasion, when I heard they were opening one in Kapolei I got hyped. I have to admit when i read somewhere about the health code violation i stayed away for a good amount of time until i thought it was safe to give this place a try. I went on a busy night so the place was packed. The wait wasn't too long and it gave me time to shop around. For drinks my girlfriend got a mojito and i got the flying gorilla (adult version of a banana shake). Our waiter recommended the mac & cheese burger so i got that and my girlfriend had this spicy chicken pasta dish. The only thing that makes me take away a star is that the burger was only decent for the price i paid for it, will try a pasta next visit. Be warned, stuff here isn't cheap so just keep that in mind. Overall, i had a great first experience at this Cheesecake Factory and will definitely be coming back. 4 shakas out of 5!"
kristen n.,"Aiea, HI",30,42,1,1.0,10/15/2017,"This was probably the worse dining experience I've had in awhile, so strap in for a long read. We pull up at 1030 and are supervisors there is already a long line. We figure, hey, it's popular we just have to wait. We stand in line for five minutes and the line is not moving at all. My husband even checks to see if they are open. They are, they have 2 hostesses literally holding the doors open and four more behind the desk but no one is moving. We figure it busy, and just wait. We finally are being seated and floor manage walks up to one the door hostesses and signals to let us in. She then says, ""this group, then wait a bit.""  Wait... are they artificially keeping people waiting to make it look popular? Because there are empty seats everywhere and three hostesses just standing around and an entire lanai section open. Maybe they really are crowded and have tons of tables ready to be bussed? Nope, 4 empty tables in our section 2 of which were not filled too we about left. We order and the waitress has to come back not once, not twice, but three times! She forgot to ask if we wanted fries versus salad. Then she forgot to ask if we wanted a drink, then she forgot what I ordered off the keiki menu. It did seem to enlongate our wait time as we saw people who sat the same time as us get our food. It's a bit of a wait so I excuse myself to the bathroom. When I come back, my food is leaving the table... wait, what?  The waitress reports that the hollandaise sauce I ordered on the side was poured over everything and would have to be sent back. Well, at least she caught it? A manager rolls up, since it was an error on the kitchens part. She then just says, ""so you don't liekholaidaise eauce? I get it, it can be an overwhelming taste."" Um, okay? I acknowledge I don't like large amounts of it, but I reported this when I first ordered. The manager made it seem like I tasted it and sent it back. No, I told them not to put any on, and the kitchen made the error. WTF? I just didn't want to deal with this so I told her, ""okay."" And she walked away. I had already resolved never to come again. But it could've been partially forgiven if the food was even good, but this was worse than chicken and waffle BLD in Aiea. The waffle really mushy and there was a big chunk of unmixed batter in one, The fried chicken or really just chicken tenders, and their maple syrup with butter tasted like crap. To add to the insult it took five minutes just to get her check and while I was waiting for the check a hostess asked if she could take an unused chair for my table.  I agreed, and when she pulled the chair out, it got stuck in the table and a bunch of utensils fell on the floor. Never again. TL;DR: The wait was long, the service was terrible,  and worst of all, the food was awful."
Abra K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,2,2,4.0,11/7/2017,Wonderful experience would come again. Very enjoyable live music good vibes. I ordered the Shrimp & chicken gumbo. And it reminded me of grandmas cooking.
