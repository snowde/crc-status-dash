Bonnie H.,"Honolulu, HI",15,113,149,4.0,1/1/2018,"Tried this place out finally. The first time we wanted to try it, it was not open even though Yelp said it was.. the wait was about 10 minutes longer than we were told but this place is always packed so we expected a wait. Our waiter came quick and got our drink and appetizer order. We got the egg roll sampler. The husband and son said the salmon egg rolls were pretty good, I thought the avocado egg role wasn't anything more than avocado in an egg roll wrapper... kinda soggy too.... but the 2 other egg rolls (southwest chicken and some other one with chicken) were soooo good!! Our lunch size pastas came out pretty quick too. We ordered cheesecake to go since we were way too full to eat it there. Man oh man the lemon meringue cheesecake is heaven! We ordered 3 different types of cheesecake slices and they were packaged and bagged nice for our ride home. We will return and it will probably always be during off peak eating times so our wait will be less than an hour."
Megs B.,"Kapolei, HI",86,11,17,4.0,10/22/2017,"Would be 5 stars except for two things.... Took one star because it's strictly first come first serve, even for large parties.  Can't believe a restaurant this size doesn't have designated large party tables & time slots. The second star for having to wait over an hour and a half for our food.   BUT... alas,  they took back a star and redeemed themselves.  Just as we're wondering where tf is our food,  the manager comes in and introduces herself.  Apologized for the long wait.  She brought out bread & salads & fries.  Talked to my son,  who was being very dramatic and dying of starvation,  she made sure he was all good. She also turned the music down.  Before that,  we could barely hear each other,  and the sound was so distorted.  It was awful.   So over all,  the only negative thing I can say about my experience is that the volume of the music was the worst aspect.  The music was way to loud, and the sound system was terrible. Felt like leaving a concert afterwards, ears ring.  Food was delicious.  The BANANA CREAM PIE CHEESECAKE - to die. Service was on point.  RIVER was our server: attentive,  knowledgeable. STEPHANIE,  manager on duty: Really. Good."
Anela G.,"Honolulu, HI",55,76,112,5.0,9/20/2017,"This is so awesome that Cheesecake Factory is here in Kapolei! I'm so happy! I'll tell you why! Came here for lunch around 2pm on a Wednesday. We got seated right away. Very nice ambiance, beautiful decorations. Very very awesome customer service! We ordered what we usually get in Waikiki and guess what!? It tasted the same! Just as delicious. I got the rib eye meal, which was very tender and delish. The rib eye steak was just a bit over salted, but I like things a bit salty. I also got the pecan cheesecake which was very good, perfect sweetness. Only had a tiny bit left, but I put it in a to go container lol. My husband got the ahi tempura and calamari as his meal. They both were very good.  We'll be back soon!"
Kennes H.,"Honolulu, HI",70,2,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"Poor representation of Cheesecake Factory. Flavorless Chicken and Rare Hibachi Steak when ordered medium well. This is a ""never to return"" place for us. In the words of Gordon Ramsey: ""damn, what a shame."""
Jackie O.,"Mililani, HI",19,219,524,4.0,10/1/2017,"Of course, the number one and initial downside to coming here was expected upon arrival...the wait!! It's a reminder of how I sometimes want to move away from Hawaii because on the mainland there are SO many options of places to eat and then so many option locations of 1 place to eat such as Cheesecake Factory so there never seems to be a wait. My friend and I went to the one at the Americana in Glendale and there was no such chaos as the one at Kamakana Ali'i or Waikiki for that matter.  Luckily, last night at the Kapolei location, we sneakily slid in at the reservations counter and got a buzzer right away with a forty minute wait, but we ended up relinquishing the buzzer because we got two seats at the bar which is first-come-first-serve seating. Our waiter, Michael, who's part of the bar team was so nice and personable. He gave us insight to various appetizer options as I was leaning toward the egg roll sampler. I'm glad we got that because it was good and as Michael mentioned, 'it allows you to try all eggrolls.' I ordered my usual Louisiana Chicken Pasta and my boyfriend got his usual, hibachi steak with mashed potatoes. The bow tie pasta in my dish seemed a little undercooked, but nothing major. The wait was also really long to get our food, and I think our waiter Michael recognized that because shortly after he acknowledged that our food 'was taking awhile but will be out shortly,'  the manager came to apologize to us and assure us that our food will be coming soon. The prices seemed to be a little more than I remember it at the Waikiki location. I'm not sure if that's because it's a brand new location or if it's normal inflation and those higher prices are also currently reflected at the Waikiki location. In any case, they do give so much especially my pasta. I can never finish it so it's like two meals since I always take the leftovers to go. When ready to leave, we ordered a whole red velvet Cheesecake to take home since my sister and her family is staying with us before they move to LV. We had them write on it, but since they don't actually write on the top of the Cheesecake, they will write on a plaque of chocolate (either white or milk), which is then put on the cheesecake. I wish they had someone with nicer penmanship to do the writing. It didn't come out too nice (I attached a picture). The wait too on the bakery side was long. The area space is a little tight that you feel like you're in the way when waiting for your order.  On the upside, they had nice live music while we were eating...not sure who the band was but they sang nice Hawaiian music.  Overall good experience! It's just the wait (both to get a table and for your food) and the chaos that compromises the overall experience, but I would come here again!"
Marty F.,"Kapolei, HI",0,16,6,5.0,12/28/2017,Great lunch!! The Cuban sandwich was awesome as were the Vietnamese summer rolls and the potstickers! Professional service at the bar. Very friendly and made great drinks!! Never disappointed coming here!!keep it up!
Brysen T.,"Honolulu, HI",0,8,2,5.0,1/6/2018,the fish tacos was good and the rice. The godiva cheesecake was so good. i like the fish it was good and the beans.i also like the strawberry lemonade!
Chantelle M.,"Waipahu, HI",53,23,20,4.0,10/7/2017,"Love that they finally opened a Cheesecake Factory on the west side! Beats driving all the way to the Waikiki location where you would have to find and pay for parking.  It was three days after their grand opening, and I came in on a weekday at about 5:00. I was hesitant at first to go because I've heard of the long wait time since it's still new. However, because it was just a party of two, our total wait time was about only 10-15 minutes.  The servers seem like that they're trying to get a hang of things, which gives them an excuse as to why it took forever for a server to come to our table to ask what we would like to drink. After ordering our drinks, it took even longer to get them.  It was a busy night, being that it was grand opening week. Therefore, it honestly took about an hour to hour and a half to receive our entrees. The two parties to the left and right of us were also waiting a while for their entrees. It took so long that the manager had to come and make his rounds to apologize to everyone for the long wait. I did notice that the kitchen looked pretty busy, so it's understandable.  My favorite new go to is the Bang Bang Chicken. It consists of chicken, and coconut curry! Will return for this dish!!"
Charmaine C.,"Waianae, HI",40,112,65,4.0,9/28/2017,"Ok I've been here twice now and soon to be a third time coming this Sunday (having a special dinner). Well let me share both times since I've come. First time we were seated quickly because we came at the right time which there was no waiting time around 2pm on a Sunday, which made it nice. Waitress was pleasant and friendly. We ordered the steak Diane and it was off the hook delicious. The food was oh so GOOD!! The drinks not so much maybe cause we just didn't know how to order, we were told that there isn't any flavored iced teas which made me sad but we moved on to the latte which was good but it took a while before we got it and we ordered dessert, the chocolate tower cake so so chocolatey. But when it came to paying our check we had a set back cause it took some time which we were wondering why but we eventually did.  Second visit, wait time was 50 minutes which I didn't feel all that bad because this other lady's wait time was 90 minutes so we get in and it was a little chaotic because we were called but when I said ""here"" the hostess by passed me and took someone else, so sad how i felt then we were seated by the same lady and this time she showed us to a table for 2 when we were a Party of 5?????Huh??? Was I confused that's a big YES???!! Mind you she grabbed 5 menus but seated us on a table for 2??? Ok ok I understand that your busy so again I over looked this mistake because we all have those days. Now we are all seated outside and the experience was so wonderful and pleasant, talk about they went the extra mile to make it right. The waiters and waitresses was on target !!! They saved the day for me!!! If the hostesses fail, the waitresses and waiters will make it up big time!! The way I look at things concerning other restaurants is some have their pluses and some have their minuses but it all depends on how you look at things and the situation on that day. So remember we all make mistakes and we all have bad days but if the restaurants try their best to make it better why now give it another try!!! It might become your favorite restaurant one day!!!"
Jacob D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,73,70,1.0,12/1/2017,"Ok so first time ever coming to a cheese cake factory. The review is based purely off service, group of 7 people, we were sat rather quickly. Then no one showed, half a hour passed still no one had come by to even greet us or to order drinks. Finally waved down a bus boy and complained. More time went by about 15 minutes later we flagged another server down. She was great and came back after about minutes and took our drink order. About 5 minutes after that the lady who was supposed to be our server and the manager (stephanie) came over. They both apologized and took the rest of out order. Our drinks finally showed up after we had been there for a hour and 15 minutes. The rest of the dinner was more of the same, one of our appetizers never showed up but we didn't complain bc we were getting full. It took so long that appetizers came out same time as main meal. Then two of us ordered cheesecake to go. Manager came back over at the end and took the two cheesecakes off the tab, however seemed a small thing for having a table be forgotten about for 45 mins.  Other food is actually really good, I had fish and chips (cod), wife had seared ahi salad. Both were very well done. The rest of our group all very much enjoyed the food."
Ann C.,"Honolulu, HI",11,104,293,5.0,9/27/2017,"I am not usually a fan of this chain but was happy I got to try this new location. The staff was attentive and informative. The food was good and hot. Cheesecake was on point as always. Inside was much bigger than I thought it would be. Of course there's a line to get in even at the start of the day before they open. We got there around 11:15 and there was about 20-25 people in front of us. By the time the doors opened there was a much longer line behind us. The staff slowly let us all in, group by group so as not to bombard the kitchen staff. I'm glad I went today and will be back."
Shaldene B.,"Waipahu, HI",129,40,162,4.0,10/2/2017,"Wanted to try their kapolei location, since they are close to me. They do not open till 11:30 am and we and other customers were waiting in line at 11. My suggestions would at least provide water to their guest while waiting in the sun. Service was on top...very fast and friendly like the waikiki location.  Their menu is no different than the waikiki location. Always indecisive about what to get, so I chose items from the light portions. Greek salad was the right portion, crab cakes was really good being its small little balls. My hubby had the lettuce wrap which he always orders.  Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. We will be seeing you again.  Please open at 11 instead"
Arrianne D.,"Kapolei, HI",60,31,70,4.0,10/2/2017,"Finally! ate lunch here yesterday (Sunday)! yay! I haven't been to the Waikiki location, so this was my 1st time to dine in here. Since this restaurant just  recently opened, the wait for a table was 1hr to 2hrs! I'm not surprised, but seriously thou you need eat something before you come here or dine in here sometime next year! :) In a nutshell: For party of 4, we waited 45mins for a table, service was kinda slow since the restaurant is packed! We ordered some drinks and appetizers and our entree took 1hr to come out, so the Manager offered us free cheesecakes! yay! Food (5 out of 5): they offer plenty choices and serving sizes are big! For apps, we ordered beet salad and tex mex eggrolls! those eggrolls was the best! for our entrees, we ordered: chxn & waffle benedict, bellagio pasta, and some breaded chicken with mash potatoes (not sure what was the name). For dessert, we ordered Dulce de Leche! yum! our fave cheesecake flavor! Everything was good! Service (5 out of 5): our waitress was friendly and attentive BUT be prepared to wait. Ambience (5 out of 5): very nice decor!  Overall, I will come back again with family and friends!"
Phil V.,"Honolulu, HI",284,84,89,4.0,9/23/2017,"Wanted come here cuz i really like this restaraunt and the one in Waikiki is such a hassle to get to. It opens at 1130, but got there around 1045 and was the 5th person in line. By the Time it officially opened, there was about 30 or so ppl behind us. Once they opened they quickly got us in and got us seated which was good. Took our orders....as you all know Cheesecake Factory has soo many items to choose from, u might get overwhelmed. So my suggestion would be to look at their menu online first so you have an idea of what you would like. I ordered the Avocado Toast, and the Chicken Riesling. Food took a little longer than expected but the bread kept us occupied. The avocado Toast was hella bomb! Kinda wish I didn't share it haha. Then my chicken came, it was really good as well! All cooked to perfection.  The only thing is tho, once we were done with our food, we ordered desert (Cheesecake of course) but we waited about 20 or so minutes for our Cheesecake. Granted it got more busy but we had to flag our waiter down to see what the deal was on the wait. She didn't check in with us or anything letting us know why it was taking long. The meal was perfect up till that point so that's why I gave it 4stars instead of 5. I know they just opened so I'll give them a little handicap for that..... Anyways overall good experience, good food."
Jessica P.,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",122,84,116,3.0,12/1/2017,"We went to this new location today because we were on this side of the island today. We love the one in Waikiki.  I was expecting a long wait because it's a Friday night, but we were seated immediately. That was a welcome surprise because we were starving! After arriving at the table, however, we waited about 15 minutes before a waitress finally came over to the table and asked if our server had come to the table yet... we told her no and she immediately apologized and took our drink and dinner orders. She told us that we were not in her section, but that she would take care of us. We were so thankful to just finally get some food.  The place was pretty packed, so there was a bit of a wait for the food. It came out about 20-30 minutes after we ordered, but was all hot and delicious. The manager did come over and apologize for the other server forgetting about us, but was very nice and thanked us for our patience.  Besides the wait for service and the food, the server that did take care of us and the manager were very nice. We enjoyed the food and would probably go back if we were not moving soon."
Katherine R.,"Green Valley, AZ",20,51,11,5.0,11/28/2017,Went here for my husband's birthday. We were seated almost straight away which was nice because I was hearing how packed it was when it first opened and dreading a long wait. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. They even have a live band playing which is a super cool touch. Our server was very attentive despite it being really busy. She frequently checked up on us throughout our meal. I was impressed.  We ordered a mojito each for drinks and the fried calamari as an appetizer. Both were excellent. Loved the amount of mint they put in the mojito. Your meal also comes with two types of complimentary bread. Both delicious. For entree my husband got the habatchi steak and I got the shrimp and chicken gumbo. Both have excellent flavours but I preferred mine. The gumbo has a really tasty smoked flavour from the sausage they put in the dish. For dessert we ordered the Christmas seasonal peppermint bark cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake. Loved them. Tasted amazing but unfortunately we could not finish it as we were both bursting at the seams. Overall this place deserves 5 stars. It was a really nice evening for my husband's birthday. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a nice dining out experience. If you order cocktails it can get a little pricey but totally worth it for a special occasion. I leave the island shortly but might come back for a cheeky slice of delicious cheesecake. Thanks for a memorable time Cheesecake Factory Kapolei!
Vernon Y.,"Mililani, HI",0,38,,5.0,12/5/2017,"I had lunch at the new ""The Cheescake Factory"" at the Ka Makana at Kapolei Shopping Mall and I thought the food and service was great.  We had the ""daVinci"" pasta and a Barbecue ""bacon"" burger.  It was a good size serving.  We ended up taking home part of the pasta.  Mary, our server did a super job making sure we had water and molasses bread before our meal.   I am glad that our second city in Kapolei has some wonderful places to eat and shop.  It is also wonderful that there is another .....The Cheescake Factory other than Waikiki."
Kelli N.,"O‘ahu, HI",21,40,114,3.0,9/24/2017,"First time here at the newly opened location. We arrived at 10:00am when they first opened. Had to wait in line to get seated and finally got sat at 10:30. We had already took a look at the menu so we knew what we wanted to get. Ordered our food and drinks at 10:36. The food came out at 11:27 and the rest of our parties food came out at 11:32. We finished our lunch at 12:00 and started to look over the cheesecake menu. Our cheesecakes finally came out at 12:24. Overall, our food took really long to come out, waiting an hour for our lunch and 20 minutes for cheesecake.  3 stars for the taste of the food (can't go wrong with cheesecake and their food is always great). Not 5 stars because of how long everything took to come out.  Side note- at least our server was really nice! I'm pretty sure she was training, her name is Nicole F. Keep up the good work!"
Debbie G.,"Mililani, HI",86,14,22,3.0,12/10/2017,"Wait to be seated - the women selling gift cards outside said there was no wait so we decided to try it.   Walked in and there was a line at the hostess stand but 5 minutes later when it was our turn we were told to step on the side we would be seated right away.   We waited another 2 minutes and were seated.   Ordering - The first waitress was very friendly and got our drink orders right away and brought us sour dough and honey brown bread to munch on while we looked over their extensive menu.   After she returned she introduced our second waitress ""Regina"".   She too was very friendly and took our food order.   We didn't have to wait too long for our food but asked for more bread while we waited.    Regina came back with just the sour dough bread but said she would return with the brown bread when it can out of the oven.  She didn't.  Food came out hot.   Large portions and very tasty.  From there it went down hill. Regina gave us 5 minutes to try our food and then came back to see how we were doing. She barely waited long enough to hear our answer and never came back until we had someone call her.   She never refilled water or my over $3 soda which was still 2/3's filled with ice when I finished the soda.  It's hard to finish your food without a beverage to wash it down with so we finally gave up and asked a manager to pack up our food and give us the bill.    She compensated us by giving me a soda to go but I still paid for the 1/3 cup soda I had at the table.    Regina and a few other servers spent a majority of our meal talking to the customers two table away from ours.  Even the check presentation was rushed.   Food was good so we would try it again They just need to work on their customer service skills."
Kristin R.,"Pearl City, HI",1,4,8,5.0,10/10/2017,"We couldn't wait for this place to open on this side of the island. We decided to go early anticpating a long wait about 430p. When we got there it was already a lot of people waiting outside. But we got seated within 30 minutes we're only a party of 3 but the front hosts we're organized, patient and not overwhelmed with the amount of people coming in at all directions asking questions and checking in.  We got greeted by the friendliest server Aaron E. He had the best attitude and so attentive and never skipped a beat. He really made our dining experience that much greater. We were sat outside which is kinda nice cause it is very noisy inside but it was drizzling rain that day. We let Aaron E. know and right away a manager came to put the screens down. There was even a hawaiian band that night and they were good. Everything was great even the food. We felt the food came in a timely manner, we even managed to order and split 2 desserts. The Hersheys bar cheesecake has to be the best. But we just might have to come back to try more. I hope that they keep up the good work. We've been to so many places that start out so great and then become so inconsistent we stop going there."
