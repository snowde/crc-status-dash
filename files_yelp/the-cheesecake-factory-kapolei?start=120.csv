Catherine Y.,"Kapolei, HI",0,9,58,5.0,10/26/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory and am super excited they opened closer to home! Who: party of 2 (just me & bf) When: Sunday evening 6pm Wait time: ***THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS :(      we were told 50 min and given a buzzer but were seated in 20m:) There were 2 bigger parties ahead of us but we definitely seemed to beat the dinner rush. Where: we chose to be seated inside the restaurant as the weather was very rainy that day (they do have covered outside seating with blinds to pull down), we were shown to a very private and spacious 2 seat booth in the middle of the restaurant. ***10/10 will be coming back regularly :) NO RESERVATIONS fyi, so be prepared to wait 1+ hrs if you come during the lunch/dinner hour with a big party. I am verrrry understanding about this and both times came with a party of only 2 people so my wait was very short! Please don't get upset with the staff over long wait times, plan better and come early or after peak hours to avoid crazy wait times! -Both times I've been here I had a small party so we got seated a lot quicker then bigger parties that have to wait for big booths, the 2 seat booths are very private and spacious. They have high partitions so you won't see your neighbors and can have easy conversation without fighting to be heard, and I love that the table is big enough for food and drinks unlike some places where the tiny round tabletops barely fit two plates. -We were offered complimentary bread, a basket of sour dough and whole grain with butter. I love the whole grain but I would love the sour dough more if they had balsamic vinegar sauce hehe, its okay though. -Our waitress was very attentive and checked in on us regularly at appropriate intervals and even told us the specials they had and recommendations. FOOD: I got the Gumbo and I've had this a couple of times at other places and loved it enough to want to try Cheesecakes version, DELISH! Spicy and saucy and so good with white rice! My bf got the Hibachi Steak- medium. It was cooked perfectly and came with many sides like asparagus, mashed potatoes, and bean sprouts yum!"
Crystal F.,"Ewa Beach, HI",295,4,6,3.0,10/2/2017,"So obviously there was going to be a wait ... right so look forward to that when you go...  Got seated after a 50 min wait, the waitress took our drink order promptly. Drinks came 15 minutes later after we ordered.    Ordered our appetizers, I got the Chicken Potstickers, my guy ordered the Thai Chicken Wraps.  When they arrived a random waiter brought the apps, he had raved about how the Potstickers was going to be the best ones I'll ever eat on this island. For me being a Dim Sum connoisseur I had high hopes for these. Meh I ate one and definitely was not impressed, they were sitting in a shoyu/vinegar watery base and the inside was just chopped up white chicken meat. It was on the very dry side. ( I could have gone next door to CPK and gotten way better potstickers over there). The Thai Chicken wraps were very nicely plated, everything looked very enticing. This came with three styles of dips, one was a cilantro style (yuck, would be great for burritos) next was a peanut butter style ( best one in my opinion ) and last was the sweet chili pepper kind.. also was good.   For our entree my guy ordered the fish and chips, . We go out somewhere nice and he ordered something that he can get everywhere else... .  As for me I got the Factory Meatloaf. Our waitress informed us that there was going to be a 45 minute delay for my plate. I shrugged and said that's fine cause I eat like a bird and needed time to settle after our apps.   We finally got our dinner, I had a couple bites  and that was it for me I was full to the brim. Same thing for my guy. We packaged up our food and got the Lemon raspberry cheesecake to go with. That cake was so yummy..   Overall I think it was fun but expensive and expect to be sitting for long periods of time. I'll definitely come again maybe at a later time at night when not so busy."
MelissaAnne B.,"Honolulu, HI",1,6,7,4.0,11/11/2017,"UPDATE: went to Cheesecake Factory to celebrate a birthday. We checked in at 5:30 pm and we're told that our party of 8 was a 2 hour wait, which is why we checked in early. We walked around the mall during the wait. After 2 hours we returned and waited for another 20 min till our buzzer rang. The wait time wasn't so bad. It was a reasonable wait. Waiter: she was really friendly. I forgot her name :(  Service: 2 managers came by to greet us and notify us that the food were about to come out. And since our appetizer came our after our entree, we got that free. Thank you!! I can definitely say that the service was much quicker and very well improved.!  Quality: the food was good. But the rice was hard. It was more of a crumble on our plate. You could feel the texture, and it felt uncooked. Those who got steak at medium rare. Received their steak cooked to perfection! The pasta I had was the bistro, which was AMAZING. And everyone else's foods seemed to taste good as well. Other than that, everything was amazing! Opinion: I love Cheesecake Factory and I enjoy that they have improved their service from when I visited the first time!  --------------- Decided to wait a while till the rush slowed down. But the support of the community filled the place with joy and excitement and because we wanted to celebrate my little brothers birthday!  we checked in at 8:11pm and were told the wait was 90 min. We were given a paper slip and asked to return within that time zone. Since the mall was still open, we decided to walk around a bit. We returned at 8:50 ish and the crowd definitely lessened before our given time. We got our buzzer and waited for about 5 more minutes, which we were thankful since the people we seen arrive later than us get called in before we did.   Waiter: she was so friendly. Her name was Angel I believe? She went beyond her efforts to get us a manager to explain why our food took so long. And the teamwork that it took to get our food out at one time.!  Service: where can I start?. Let's just say that the group next to us were served their food first before we did. When we got seated, their table was still filled with the leftovers from the last party. So we got kind of concerned. Our food arrived at 10:12... which is like more than an hour since we sat down. BUT... we were greeted by the manager and were told that our food got ""mixed up"" ‍ we ended up not staying to get the birthday treat or a cheesecake since it was already 10:40 and that's almost 3 hours of our time that was spent at Cheesecake Factory... mind that the food took almost more than an hour.  Quality: the pasta was not cooked (it was very hard to pick up with my fork. I had to poke at it harder than usual) and looked very dry. The plate was hot but the food was very much cooled down...  Opinion: although the first visit to our newly opened Cheesecake Factory was not the 'best', I can't deny that I won't return. Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. And hopefully when I return, I will not be writing the same review."
Kim W.,"Honolulu, HI",155,11,,2.0,11/13/2017,So the reason behind my 2 star review is for a number for reasons.  I'll start that we got seated right away which was good.  Now this is where the 2 Star review come into starts.  It took the server about 5 minutes to come to the table to greet us.  We ordered the buffalo blast which was very salty.  Then we waited about 30 minutes plus for our dinner.  The server did apologize saying there was a big party's order in front of ours and the sad thing is that she forgot what ordered.    While waiting for our food she said that they'll comp our cheesecake which it was nice.  Once we got our food our server asked if we know what kind of cheesecake we wanted.. which made us feel rushed.  I got the shrimp with angel hair my other half got the meatloaf.  Both food was super salty and since we didn't want to wait again for something else we just ate it. I've been here while they did their test run and service and food was good. But I don't know what happened?!?  I think I'll just come to pick up cheesecake and not dine in.  Sorry it's really not worth the wait especially on a weekday!
Janelle A.,"Waianae, HI",196,11,2,5.0,1/10/2018,"I love coming to the Kapolei Cheesecake Factory. I honestly gotta say they have stepped up their game. At first it was really slow but we knew they just opened and they were learning, but by the time we came back for our boss's surprise birthday lunch and my Christmas break with my life group sisters. They were very attentive. Great customer service. I can't wait to eat back there again."
Jenn R.,"Honolulu, HI",118,52,142,5.0,10/30/2017,"Had dinner with my other half this past Saturday night and we both had a good time. Was told wait time would be 20 mins which it turned out to be exact wait time. Walked in, got seated and our female server was very nice and friendly. First we ordered our drinks and appetizers which both came out in a timely manner. Eggroll sampler and crab artichoke dip was pretty bomb. We both enjoyed it very much. For our main dish we ordered their Louisiana Parmesan chicken pasta and decided to share. Thank god we decided that because portion was huge! Way more than enough for two! Dish came out hot and very tasty. I like how the pasta was ribbon shaped as well. Overall food & drinks was satisfying good as well as the service received. We both enjoyed the live music very much! Such a great fun ambience to be in. We definitely will be back for sure."
Rachael O.,"Ewa Beach, HI",241,96,55,5.0,11/1/2017,"I had been waiting to come here, because I wanted to wait a while after it first opened. First we called to see how long the wait was, they said they don't do reservations. They said we should get seated within 20 to 30 mins. We got to the restaurant and we didn't get seated until a hour and a half. Even though,it was a pain to wait that long... the food was amazing  and the service was great! The food was so so delicious . We will definitely be coming back."
Chris A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,21,8,3.0,11/1/2017,"Excited that our wait was only 5-10 minutes however the dining experience spiraled down as the early eve progressed. Atmosphere loud especially with nearby family with screaming child so understandably hubby's order 'mixed' up. Got club vs. chicken/avocado club. Yes, apology offered and accepted but we finished our meals before hubby's sandwich finally arrived. Chicken sandwich arrived with NO avocado. Manager came by & said it would be fixed but we didn't want to wait another 15-20minutes for just avocado. Fortunately no charge for this sandwich which never arrived as ordered. Guess staff still working out the kinks. Love Cheesecake Factory on mainland, so give it another shot in a month or so.."
Lynn U.,"Pearl City, HI",0,9,,3.0,12/19/2017,"Was seated fast, amazing food, but I was sadden by the service! Andrew was our server. Drinks took awhile to come. Every time we asked for something we had to wait. He didn't keep our drinks filled. Food came out and someone handed the plate to my sister and made it well known that it burned her fingers but no sorry. He paid more attention to other guess but I guess we where just not in his radar!!! Maybe next time! Three stars for location and great food!!"
Basilio M.,"Kapolei, HI",2,81,35,4.0,11/4/2017,"2017.11.03:  So to be clear this is the actual first time I've ever been to any Cheesecake Factory.  The last check in I never made it to even get a pager to wait for a table.  So tasty is my first real check in.  So far we have ordered and there is live music jam only a table away.  I'm liking the tunes.      So didn't get our appetizers when an appetizer was supposed to come out.  Though they apologized, it is still a miss.  Server and manager very helpful, though really I'm not concerned about the apology simply get my order to me.  All considered I will likely come again.      Sooo many people not sure the cook situation but such a large crowd may need more folks, meal took about 30 mins to get to us.  That is after it took 5 min to check in, and 1 hour to get page for the open table.  Not sure how much longer they can stay the ""thing"" in Kapolei if they don't speed up time.  There are many options to head out to in Kapolei, though they do have Cheesecake.        Truth be told I really want them to succeed and become a cornerstone.  Despite the problems I understand that they care about the folks they serve so they earned a 4 Star Dragonball.  If they can pull off the Japanese fluffy Cheesecake I may be very driven to give them a try sooner."
LaGina L.,"Henderson, NV",0,7,3,4.0,12/28/2017,"My husband and I came in for a late lunch early dinner. I had the soup and salad with 1/2 chicken sandwich. My husband ordered chips, guacamole, salsa and came with sour cream. Then the chicken tacos. He ate the tacos although said he'd order something different next time. Large portions for guacamole and I took my 1/2 sandwich and soup home. Suggestion... Have warm chips to serve. Our waitress Felisha and Yani were fabulous.  oh my great food, service, and too much to eat. When we go for our next movie. Getting dessert for sure."
Julianne O.,"Waipahu, HI",494,203,851,3.0,10/16/2017,"I have mixed feelings about this place. We were invited to their pre-opening test runs and had a FANTASTIC experience, however I felt that it was not a fair experience to base my review on.  So we actually decided to go on opening day for happy hour.  Now, I normally don't go to ANY restaurant openings and avoid crowds at all costs, however, we had such a great experience prior that we were so excited to return.  It actually wasn't too bad since we came early for happy hour and bar seating is first come first serve- we waited about 10 mins for a high-top.  We arrived around 4:30pm for their great happy hour that had a nice selection of foods and discounted drinks.  Throughout the night, we were joined by more and more people, mostly industry people from other Food & Beverage outlets and hotels who wanted to scope things out.  Service was slow but we totally expected that on their first night so didn't really mind waiting.  The only thing we had an issue with was one of our friends ordered the ""fried cheese"" (essentially cheese sticks), that had not come out for about an hour.  We kept asking the waiter who was very apologetic and nice about it which we appreciated but yet, still no cheese sticks.  Eventually we decided to tell a manager about it and after a while, we finally got the cheese sticks an hour and a half later. SO I know this is a sensitive subject and this story is one-sided so it's impossible for Yelpers reading this to get a full understating of the situation without being there so I'll keep it short...a summary of what happened was: After we complained, the manager who helped us get our cheese sticks then came back to our table and started randomly talking about how he knows everyone was in a ""celebration mood"" and that there was a lot of alcohol ordered at the table but he just wants to make sure we get home safe.  Essentially he was cutting us off.  I know he was just trying to do his job, but we felt like the reasons he was cutting us off were: 1. Because we complained  2. Because we had been there for a few hours already (which wasn't our fault since service was extremely slow) and 3. Because we had a large group taking up two tables.  It's impossible to know his real intent but if he truly thought we had too much to drink, then I understand his point of view.  It's a hard thing to determine so I'll just leave it at that. Like I said, we can't hold it against them so we gave them another shot about a month later, hoping things were a little bit smoother.  That experience was very slow as well and when checking the receipt, the server had charged us an extra item we didn't order.  Thankfully they were able to take it off no problem.  We went AGAIN even after this and decided to sit at the actual bar.  I can honestly say that the bar is where we got the best service.  Bartenders were super friendly and attentive.  We really like Cheesecake Factory and want them to succeed but so far we haven't been impressed and the odds of us having a good experience have been quite low.  Let's hope they improve by our next visit!"
LooLicious L.,"Honolulu, HI",3,59,38,5.0,11/6/2017,"I love this restaurant! They have a huge menu for whatever you're in the mood for, everything is pretty good and always leftovers for the next day, validated parking which comes out to about two dollars for two hours. At dinner there's always a huge wait so I try to go for lunch or an off hour like at 3 PM. I've not had anything bad there and the service is always pretty good as well"
V K.,"Waipahu, HI",0,33,,3.0,1/1/2018,"First time visit to the New restaurant.  Our server was Jeff B, who was very patient and nice.  Good service! The Factory Nachos were the best. Everything Pizza was a disappointment.  My nephew was not too happy.  Not enough toppings.  Did not have any flavor. Eggs Benedict was ok. Sauce a little thick, no flavor... The Chicken Waffle Benedict was good.  Chicken was good."
Henry L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,3,,5.0,10/23/2017,"First visit was during Sunday brunch. There was a line & the weather was regular to us westsiders but ""unbearable & hot"" to others, lol... it took awhile for get seated but cant complain since 1) the place was brand new & the hype is still in effect and 2) what do you expect? Cheesecake Factory was always, and still is, busy (aka Waikiki!) so idk why people would fault them for that (if u disagree, go CPK across the street, they have time ) Service was great. Big shouts to our new friend and favorite Kapolei Cheesecake waitress Sheralynn ""I-got yo-refills-before-you-could-ask-for-one"" M... she took care of us good. Despite the mayhem of starving people, busy cooks, and servers running about a marathon, Sheralynn was very communicative when our items was taking a little longer to get out, insightful on the menu and iquiries, patient and overall a pleasure to have as our waitress. She was great and would definitely liked to have her as our waitress anytime...  food was good, service was consistent, restaurant was nice and clean, but the French toast they only serve during brunch was ehh. Lol"
Nicole M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",69,12,9,3.0,12/2/2017,"The restaurant is beautiful, idk if it's just me but it gives me a Vegas casino type of feel. The workers are all nice for the most part. I do hate how crowded it is sometimes but I do make sure to go when there is no wait. I do NOT care for the food or for their novel of a menu. First time I went I ordered a shrimp pasta w marinara sauce and there was hardly any sauce on it and there was so much pasta I couldn't finish it. The second time I ordered some type of steak and mashed potatoes from the specials menu and there were too many flavors and too many contrasting flavors. I would've enjoyed it more without the wine sauce they cooked it in. The plate my boyfriend had looked super good till I had a bite of his shrimp and it had a really weird and strong bite to it. It wasn't a spicy bite but it was over-seasoned with something I can't figure out but it was not enjoyable. We did enjoy their drinks. I had the peach Bellini and it was nice and light but I still got that buzz I look for. My boyfriend had a mango something and it was super good I believe he ordered a second one but can't remember. But the CHEESECAKE is to die for. Specifically the original w the strawberry on top. However, the slices do seem a little small, a lot smaller than I remember it being a few years back when I ate at the town location. Don't care for the amount of whipped cream they put in the container also.  Probably won't be eating here for awhile unless we're tired of our usual spots bc I do only live around the corner but for now it will only be a cheesecake crave spot for my boyfriend and I."
Donna V.,"Kapolei, HI",18,124,70,4.0,12/19/2017,"I love that there is a cheesecake factory on the west side. When it first opened I strayed away from eating there since the wait was long (we were told it would be a 4 hour wait). They don't reservations which is a peeve of mine for restaurants. The best times to go would be lunch or early dinner on the weekdays.  Complimentary bread is provided while you look through the menu and order your food. The menu book is extensive so spend some time looking through the menu. Some of my favorite appetizers are the calamari and summer rolls. I have ordered the summer rolls as my meal since it's fulfilling. I love the Cobb salad here, the portions are HUGE and can serve 2 people. My boyfriend likes their loco moco here. The egg is just how he likes it (over easy without being overcooked) and you can order it with fried rice. My favorite cheesecake here is cookie dough. There is lots of parking since it's located in Ka Makana Alii mall. I would call ahead to see what the estimated wait time would be."
Muziq L.,"Shelbyville, KY",0,1,2,5.0,12/1/2017,"Although the wait was long it's understandable. We enjoyed everything. The live entertainment, the food, drinks & our always smiling & ever so helpful waitress Jessica!"
Jessa F.,"Waipahu, HI",1,5,,5.0,11/6/2017,"I was so excited to find out that they were opening a Cheesecake Factory closer to home because we all know going to Waikiki can be beyond hectic! Today was my first time at the Kapolei location. My boyfriend, kids, & I went first thing in the morning. They opened 10am on Sundays and we got there at about 10:15 am. There was already a pretty long line before it even opened! While waiting, I noticed that there were two large parties ahead of us (I'm taking about 15+ people each party). I'll be completely honestly and say I was getting a bit impatient and was gonna give 4 stars but I had to remind myself that they just opened and already have two large groups to set tables for while still attending to the other customers. While observing the hostess handling both groups and other customers waiting, I believe that they deserve 5 stars for that!  We got finally got seated at about 10:30 and we had a stroller, the host was kind to take our stroller and put up at the front desk so it's out of the way. Our server was awesome! She was quick to refill our drinks, made sure we were all good, packed our food to take home, etc. From beginning to end she showed is excellent service.  My boyfriend & I both got burgers and my son got a kids cheese pizza. I got the Bacon-bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend got the mushroom burger. We both shared half of our burger, and they were amazing! But be warned that they are really messy to eat! My boyfriend was really surprised to see a piece of fried pork belly (I think it was lol) in the bacon burger. It made the burger that much better because it set itself apart from any ordinary bacon burger. The fries were a bit dry but nothing that bothered me. And the kids pizza was pretty big! For the price plus a drink, it was an A+!  Now just to add a side note, we overheard from the couple next to us found parchment paper in his omelette. I believe the manager on duty was the one to directly came to him and apologized for the incident and offered a couple things to make up for the mistake. Fortunately, he was very understanding and even said he's still gonna eat it all haha.  Overall, we had a great experience! We're so happy we don't need to travel all the way to Waikiki to get some excellent customer service and yummy food!"
Shannon D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",3,40,34,4.0,11/5/2017,"Firsts time to this location since opening about a month ago. Got there as soon as they opened at 10. Took a while to be seated but probably since they were just starting their day. When we were finally seated our waiter was quick to take drink orders. House bread was great but for some reason the butter was the best part lol. Our food took a good 20-25 minutes to get to us. I felt like that was a bit long since it was a salad and kids quesadilla. The eggs, potatoes and bagel were just okay nothing fancy but the Santa Fe salad was amazing!!! Love love loved it! Besides the wait for the food everything was fine. I've been to the one in Waikiki many of times and there's no difference at all which was great. Great for family time."
