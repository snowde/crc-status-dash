Tonika G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,64,16,5.0,10/31/2017,"This is our favorite restaurant, the menu is extensive. Everyone can find something from the appetizers to that delicious drink in the pineapple (bomb). There is something for everyone. If you don't like cheesecake try the other desserts, the chocolate cake is a monster so rich and decedent. I'm happy we don't have to drive all the way to town. And we love the curbside pick up!"
Chad S.,"Honolulu, HI",29,203,19,2.0,10/31/2017,Eh!  I loved the Cheesecake Factory in the mainland. Granted we went on opening day. Perhaps they didn't have their act together yet. But the service was lackluster and the food was kind of a bummer.
D D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,17,15,4.0,12/21/2017,Great food- OMG try the Korean fried cauliflower!!  So. Darned. Good!!!  Everything we ordered was perfect and flavorful.  Nice ambience- friendly staff and not too much of a wait to be seated- even when busy.  Our waiter Deivan was great!   Friendly and attentive and gave excellent recommendations. Will definitely be back!! Also tried the curbside ordering recently. Pretty good-  though portions seemed smaller than when ordering same dishes for dine in. Zachary was courteous and professional. Now if only Cheesecake Factory were a Bite Squad delivery option I'd be totally happy!
Nadine J.,"Honolulu, HI",135,153,828,4.0,10/5/2017,We arrived 15 minutes prior to opening and there was a long line. The doors opened but they were only seating about ten people at a time so we stood in the hot sun for about 25 minutes. Then we were seared. The waitress was nice and gave us recommendations. We had the cheese sticks which were different but tasted good. Then we shared a full order of the luau salad which tasted similar to a Chinese chicken salad with added avocado and it was yummy. We also shared a full order of the falafalle pasta with extra cream sauce and lots of parmesan cheese that was yummy as well. The only thing we ordered too much food. I took away one star for waiting in the hot sun. Other than that there was lots of free parking and the service and food was good. My tip is to go early and bring an umbrella.
Greg A.,"Aiea, HI",11,61,238,4.0,10/8/2017,"This was our first time here. We like to go to the one in Waikiki but that place is usually very busy. Since we had a feeling this one would be no different we planned on going between lunch & dinner. We got there around 3:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and was told there would be a 30 minute wait. You're given a pager to notify you when your table is ready. They have an outside waiting area with chairs to make your wait a little more comfortable. We decided to take a short stroll through the mall and was pleasantly surprised to get the page after only 15 minutes. The place is beautiful, spacious & modern looking. I like the way the inside seating is situated. There are a number of 2 people booths as well as larger tables to accommodate big groups. They have an open lanai area which provides even more seating and also features live music after 6pm on the weekend. If you've been to a Cheesecake Factory then the menu will be familiar to you but if you have never been to one the menu can be daunting! Lots and lots of choices. They even have a skinny menu featuring low calorie & healthy entrees. Our server Bryson was very friendly, knowledgeable & efficient. All & all we enjoyed our experience there and would definitely come back again! As we were leaving there was a crowd of people waiting for a table and we were told the wait was about 2 hours!"
Tumon B.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",0,7,,4.0,1/6/2018,"Went for an early dinner with off island family and we rated a 4 of 5 stars! Noticeable was two flies that kept flying around. The staff noted the doors were open and they go away towards evening time.  We ordered drinks twice because the first waiter didn't provide refreshments.  The bread was warm and we noticed that we had no utensils on the table. I had to get up and get a few butter knives for kids to eat warm bread with butter. We waited a couple minutes but no waiter around. Finally we ordered and everything else was ok.  I preferred the Waikiki location because they were very busy but very nice and attentive.  After l tipped at 15% we met waited staff on way out but no ""mahalo"" or thank you."
Jeff C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",392,12,24,5.0,10/28/2017,2nd time here. This time for Sat Brunch. Said wait would be 50min but only waited 30! So Service is much better and should sit in the booths seating for 6. So much room. Really comfy.
Shirl M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,15,10,5.0,10/12/2017,"Have been to CCF Kapolei twice now. On both occasions had minimal wait time which likely had to do with luck or times we went!  First time Friday night 5:30. Wait time was 1 hour (which I didn't feel was too bad) however, we were able to get high top table at bar within about 15 minutes (luck) Second time Wednesday afternoon 4:30, no wait - we were seated immediately. There was also live music playing from the outside area!  Service both times was great.  Food was the usual Cheesecake Factory food and was good, quick, hot!  All and all this location opening in Kapolei is the best thing for the westside! And to be honest I feel that the service was exceptional both times. From the hostesses to the servers to the busboys, they are polite and they are hustling!"
Jean D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,17,6,4.0,12/26/2017,"I feel like this place is a bad luck for me & my fiance. Visited here for the 2nd time on 12/26. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Strips for our appetizers, Bacon-Bacon Burger and Mushroom Burger Swiss.  The chicken was okay, my fiance liked his sandwich but I didn't really enjoy my sandwich. There cheese slice was pretty thick and it had no flavor.  When our sandwiches came, our appetizer also came. Our server (dude wearing all black) also told us that the fries would come out in 2 mins. We said we didn't mind waiting, and went ahead to eat our sandwiches. By the time we finished our sandwiches, fries never came.. We told our server, which she apologized and brought it out right away.. downside to it was the fries were stale and we couldn't enjoy it.  Would we come back here for the third time? Maybe not... Maybe only for the dessert we will come back for."
Martha H.,"Columbia, TN",10,3,4,5.0,11/19/2017,Excellent food! We ate outside with musicians playing guitars. It was all very relaxing and pleasant.
Dino R.,"Aiea, HI",121,4,7,2.0,9/22/2017,Let me start by saying we absolutely love cheesecake factory. We were so excited to come to the Kapolei location just minutes from our home.  We ordered food at about 7:15PM and were advised that we can pick up curbside in about an hour. We arrived at a very busy curbside pick up at around 8:30PM. We followed the directions of the sign and called to let them know we were there. There was no sign of any employees in the area at curbside.  After calling a second time and physically waving down the only employee we seen outside we were able to get some assistance. Two cars who came after us were helped before they came out with our receipt.   They had me check my order on the receipt which was not correct. They came back to advise me that they are making the corrected plate and it should be out in five minutes. This was at 9:10PM At 9:45 PM we decided to call and speak with a Manager after flagging down yet another employee to ask about the status of our meal.  At about 5 minutes to 10 PM we received our meal.  The only reason there is two stars in this review is because the food was really great. This location needs way more practice with customer service and their curbside pickup option.  I recommend leaving your pets at home and coming dressed to pick up your meal inside. I wish I did.
Ronson O.,"Volcano, HI",1,5,8,1.0,9/28/2017,"I took my wife and young son to eat here on Wednesday, September 27 2017 at about 745 pm. We were joined by our friend and her young son also. Naturally we ordered food for our kids first because they were starving. Their food came out fairly quickly. I would say within ten minutes. At that time the adult decided to order.  This is where it went bad. I ordered an appetizer to snack on and we ordered our entrees at the same time. Long story short, I ended up eating my appetizer for dinner, and my wife who is 7 months pregnant was forced to eat bread and butter with her friend.  The only reason why they are getting a star from me is because the waitress was very nice. The kids ate on time which was the important thing. But we waited for AN HOUR, and the only reason my wife didn't starve is because we had to say something about all the people around us coming and going with their stomachs filled and we were still sitting there.  You might say ""well you must have ordered something pretty hard to make"" or. ""They probably just ran out of an ingredient"". I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. My wife ordered a pasta with chicken. It's a mystery to me why I couldn't eat a nice meal with my family on my night off; Why I couldn't enjoy a new restaurant in our town.  Think twice about going there. Seriously. They obviously cannot handle the high output of food without sacrificing elsewhere."
Jamey S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,1,5.0,12/26/2017,It's usually always busy so be prepared to wait but it's so worth it! Our server was Kai he was very nice and gave excellent service. We had a wonderful experience for first timers. Great service and the food it sooo good too!
Debbie K.,"Kapolei, HI",143,50,82,5.0,10/16/2017,"So there has been so much anticipation for this place to open up at Ka Makana Alii, we couldn't wait to try it. We tried on a Saturday night and scratched that idea when we found out the wait was 2 1/2 hours. So we tried again this past Saturday night, and this time we only had to wait 15 min. but mind you we went there at 9 pm. We were seated right away, and greeted by our server within 5 minutes of being seated. The menu is extensive.......so much to choose from! We were brought some bread and butter while we waited to order. We decided on Pasta Carbonara, Chopped Salad and the Crispy Chicken Samosa appetizer. Everything we ordered was delicious and nice and hot! I was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendly, informative, knowledgeable, timely, especially since it's a new place and the place was super busy. We had no room for dessert so we will have to go again! Can't wait!"
Jasmine G.,"Kapolei, HI",12,6,8,5.0,10/12/2017,"Absolutely loved our first experience at Cheesecake Factory! We had dinner there for a special event last night and the entire evening we felt so taken care of. The entire staff went above and beyond to make accommodations for our large party and were incredibly efficient, patient, and understanding of all our needs.  The menu is a bit daunting, but thanks to our amazing servers, Kristyn and Levi, we got through it. Lol. They not only knew almost everything about the menu, they gave us great descriptions of their amazing selection and we ended up ordering all of their recommendations. We were not disappointed! Kristyn was so sweet and attentive all evening with such a pleasant personality and was even apologetic for an error in one of our orders and made up for it with a double portion of one of our side orders. Levi was so passionate about cheesecake he made us want to order every single one! Lol. They made us feel so welcome and definitely were a huge part of making our evening outstanding. Ask to be in their section if you can! Lol.  Because of the crowds, the wait for our food was a little long. However, the manager was kind enough to come out and apologize to us and keep us in the loop as to why we were waiting. Super classy move.  Overall, we love this new restaurant! The atmosphere is a little crowded and loud, but the interior is beautiful. We sat outside and the beautiful ambiance and live music made a perfect evening. The portions were generous and we left so full and happy. Their delicious menu is only topped by their first class customer service.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory! We'll definitely be back for more!"
Rose L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",22,49,28,5.0,9/21/2017,"We came to this location on the day after its grand opening and we absolutely loved it!  After arriving at about 1pm on a Wednesday, we were told that it would be a 20 minute wait - YAY!  We loved that TV screens above the cheesecake counter showed pictures of various menu items so we could ooh and ahh about what items we would be ordering later.  We ended up waiting less than 20 minutes before our table was ready and we were pleased to see that the 4 of us got a spacious corner booth. All of the staff we encountered were super friendly, smiley, and helpful... And our food was DELICIOUS! We ordered the Steak Diane, Chicken Piccatta, and the Chicken Bellagio.  My 6 year old chose the Fried Chicken Strips with French Fries.  Everything tasted soooo good!  We want to keep coming back so we can try the rest of the menu items (there are SO MANY choices!). We kept raving about our experience and look forward to our next visit :)"
Elsa L.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",40,15,8,4.0,12/2/2017,"Prepare for a long wait, especially on Fridays and weekends, as this location is as popular as the one in Waikiki. Party of 9 and the wait was 1hr 45mins. We ate here the first week of November and the food tastes the same as how it is in the mainland. We were seated outside and right next to entertainment (2 guys singing covers w/ guitars). Service was great as our server made sure to come by our table several times to check on our refills and anything else we needed. Clam chowder was too salty, but another member of my party liked it. As always, the cheesecakes do not disappoint!"
Jackie M.,"Kapolei, HI",2,25,18,5.0,12/21/2017,"I've been here 3 times since they've opened and I have zero complaints. Every time we've gone it was off peak times and were seated right away. The service is always awesome and the food never disappoints. We always get the Thai Lettuce wraps, calamari and Hibachi steak. If you're looking for pasta, the Spicy Chipotle pasta is delicious and is good enough for two people. If you're feeling Thai food, the coconut lime chicken was really good too. Avoid peak times or prepare to wait. Also I've notice if you call to see how long is the wait time, they always say about 1hr-2hr wait even if there's hardly a wait. I think it's their padding for time in case it gets busy. Twice I've called and they told me that and when we came we got seated right away. Just an fyi...Must go, you won't be disappointed"
Kamaka A.,"San Diego, CA",131,1,,5.0,12/24/2017,"Tonight we (8 of us) came to celebrate Christmas Eve and a birthday. Our waitress Alicia Keys was such a terrific server. She was beyond amazing. Such a great attitude and lovely personality. When we visit again, we will definitely request to have her again."
Kiri H.,"Nanakuli, HI",239,12,2,5.0,9/28/2017,"Our party of 7 and a baby waited closer to 3hrs. Totally expected for grand opening. Service was AMAZING!!!! Super attentive, all our orders were correct, drinks were always filled! And of course the food was great! From former experience of opening a new chain restaurant, I was super impressed with Cheesecake Factory last night I will definitely visit again!!!"
