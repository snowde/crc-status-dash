Jamie S.,"Kapolei, HI",119,84,35,3.0,9/20/2017,"Braved opening day, and they were fully staffed, so many hands on deck!  Our server was working hard, but did not appear to be very experienced, so what a way to get immersed in your new job.  The food was good, we didn't order anything fancy or that Cheesecake Factory does ""well"" for our main dishes so I would not feel justified to pick it apart, but it really wasn't delicious.   Our pumpkin cheesecake was still frozen throughout 75% of it when it came out, but it still tasted good, it was just cold or frozen in some parts.  Made for interesting texture.  The congregating areas for the staff are in the only pathway for patrons to come and go so walking by with a toddler on my hip was challenging space wise.   Also, the handicap sign, in the designated parking is backwards and that really peeves me."
Ella R.,"Honolulu, HI",203,11,76,5.0,10/22/2017,"Although we waited for almost two hours, it was worth the wait! We celebrated my son 17th birthday party at Cheesecake Factory and we loved the food, the drinks, Ambience of the decorations inside. But most of all, we had an awesome waiter who was so attentive to us. I would so come back again and would definitely refer my friends and family to enjoy the food and all."
Syn A.,"Pearl City, HI",64,121,258,3.0,10/10/2017,"There's still a fairly long wait to get seated (60 minutes at 5pm on Discover's Day). The service was decent with the biggest disappointment was waiting for our desserts. It took forever & when our waitress finally came by to find out why were still at the table when we'd already paid our tabs, she found out a cheesecake we ordered was sold out. So I'd advise that if you can wait to pay your check, do so until all your food gets served. I'm guessing this location will always be busy just like the Waikiki location, so come prepared to wait for a table. I also noticed that smaller groups of 2-4 people get seated quicker than a group of 6 or more. My sister enjoyed her Steak Diane/Chicken Madeira combo & my Chicken Costoletta was tasty. If we have the time to wait, check out CF."
Aloha C.,"Honolulu, HI",85,53,,5.0,9/27/2017,Shout out to Desiree D! Our awesome waitress!!! Loved her. Spot on and made our experience here wonderful!!!! Thank you Kapolei CCF!
Jaymie M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,2.0,11/12/2017,"This was the 2nd time our food did not come out correctly.  Although our waitress was very helpful and apologetic and provided great service.  When we didn't receive our meals correspondingly a (female manager) came out and gave a complimentary bowl of soup, which was fine.  When the steak meal wasnt cooked as requested, it was sent to be re made.   We waited a while before deciding to just cancel the order.  The waitress was very understanding of the situation so she mentioned that she would ask to comp the 1 meal and pack it to go.   However, when her (male manager) approached the table and was asking a series of question and I mentioned that the waitress suggested that the meal could be comped and packed to go....his response was ""Well she isn't authorized to make those decisions, that's why I am here""  I was offended by his attitude and choice of uncessary comments.  I felt as a manger he should never offend a patron especially with inconsiderate and unnecessary comments. As a former food service employee, I didn't let that effect the tip of the waitress, however I felt my family's experience was tainted due to the Male managers decision to handle the situation inconsiderately. It's one thing for the kitchen to be unable to handle the volume, but it's another to be treated negatively in addition by someone in a managerial position.   I hope for the sake of future patrons and the employees, reading this post has a positive effect on the future outcomes of this restaurant."
Ashley W.,"Kapolei, HI",3,124,146,2.0,9/25/2017,5 star cheesecake + over 2 hour wait = 2 stars! Had to wait about 20 mins. just to get some cheesecake. We opted to eat at CPK where we waited only about 20 mins. to be seated then went back over to get dessert to go. I really hope they figure out a way to deal with the crowd and lessen the wait but until then we'll stay away.
Jenny S.,"Honolulu, HI",67,25,65,5.0,10/24/2017,"We came here 2 times and I guess we got lucky both times to have amazing and quick service.  The first time was our first time since we had a $50 gift card.  We came on a Saturday at  430pm and was told the wait was about 45 mins for 2.  We were okay with it since we expected it that is why we came early and werent hungry yet.  After about 25 mins our pager went off and we got seated at a booth.  Service was quick and we got bread and our drinks.  I ordered just ice tea and the hubs had a good drink their JW lemonade which I swear is so addicting like crack lol.  He got a few of them during dinner.  It took us a moment to look at the menu since it was ridiculously huge. We ordered the appetizer of the truffle bacon grill cheese from the happy hour and it was pretty good.  The hubs ordered the fish tacos and subbed the sides with fries which the fries were so so so amazing another addicting thing.  I got the shrimp scampi it was good but not something i would order again since the shrimp was breaded and fried which i didnt care for much.  We were so full that we couldnt even get dessert but we did come back for dessert.   We came back again on a weekend day for dessert and it was busy but since the bar was open we sat there.  Again service was quick and food and drinks came out fast even tho the bartender was hella busy.  Hubs got the JW lemonade again and then he tried the flying gorrilla which is basically a spiked chocolate n banana milkshake which he said was amazing and after got the strawberry creamsicle which was a spiked strawberry milkshake.  He said they were all good. We ordered the Adams special cheesecake which has caramel, butterfinger and reeses pb cups inside the cheesecake and peanutbutter frosting on top with whip.  It was both our fave things combined into one and was amazing.  Again we ordered a side of fries since they were like crack and was surprise at how big the serving was.  Overall both experiences were great"
Camille K.,"Waipahu, HI",62,42,8,5.0,9/16/2017,"OH MY CHEESECAKE !! I had the pleasure and honor to attend the soft opening yesterday the 15th which happened to be a ""pre-bday"" celebration. Let me tell you of my wonderful experience  We were greeted at the entrance with the upmost professionalism. They explained the event as it was very clear they were here to serve us !!  Upon entering the very active restaurant we were received with warm welcomes and hellos. So cheerful yet working very hard!  We were seated in a nice location and the space between the tables was very roomy and comfortable. Nicole was our server with DYLAN diligently assuring our awesome experience !! The service was excellent - the choice of appetizers- entrees- and yess  the desserts were SUPERRR. I FELT so VIP. The portions were plentiful and no one left hungry. I can't tell you how perfect everything was. Tasty flavorful food and again so many workers so happy to see us. The environment was festive and clean along with the bathrooms being spacious and sanitary.  I was serenaded by the staff for my birthday  and my Birthday Cheesecake (bday celebration) was personalized with chocolate syrup writing around  my cake on the plate. How cool is that!!?! 5 stars  and thumbs up for this opening and  location. BYE WAIKIKI ... west side is where it's at. THX TO MY PEEPS THAT TOOK ME .  Cheesecake Factory you really rock and I'll be back #cheatdaywasworthit #cheesecakefactory  Appetizers : calamari  Entree : almond crusted salmon kale salad w shrimp  dessert : bday celebration and peanut butter cup"
Michael C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",51,52,70,5.0,9/15/2017,Went to the cheesecake factory today for lunch and had a great experience the servers were really nice they're all brand new and they're learning their job very well management was awfully friendly and they treated us awesome the food was delicious and the menu for lunch had a lot of variety on it I'll be back there again real soon
Leilani M.,"Waipahu, HI",237,22,41,5.0,10/14/2017,"So happy we have one on the west side! Had lunch with the girls.  We met at 12:30 and it was already poppin in there. We decided to eat at the bar and it turned out to be a great idea. Our bartender was the best! Ugh I should have asked her name. We didn't feel rushed to order, she was very attentive, and gave honest opinions about their food. We gabbed for about 2 hours before we decided we should leave.  She packed up our left overs and even offered to pack our drinks in to-go cups. She even asked if we wanted the bill split without a hint of remorse in her voice. I thoroughly enjoyed the food, ambience, and friendly service."
Rere G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,18,2,1.0,12/13/2017,"This place is absolutely disgusting! We were wondering why our food was so cold coming out.  ( we are not the complaining type so we just left it)  Now i see why we should've checked yelp. People please be aware of eating here. Out of our party of 7, 4 of us got food poisoning immediately hours after having dinner. Dont eat there! This happened on December 11, and i doubt there is any change. Save your stomachs and go somewhere that actually passed their food inspection with a green card. These people are probably using the same gloves or dont wash their hands but either way they're contaminating your food and dont give one crap about your wellbeing."
Sherry N.,"Waianae, HI",116,13,25,5.0,9/15/2017,"So onolicious! Love their chicken with avocado salad, Tuscan chicken with tomatoes and asparagus, and last but not least, their chocolate Nutella hazelnut crunch cheesecake. OMGoodness! Their dessert were totally mind blowing...  Awesome service from Mercedes, Donni, Terani, and Kelly! Love you guys!!"
Sha R.,"Aiea, HI",0,12,4,5.0,9/19/2017,"I usually don't go to a restaurant when they first open because of past experiences at other restaurants.  When a new restaurant that can only be found either in the mainland or in town, opens on the west side , we get pretty excited and we all want to try it at the same time. So that guarantees that the restaurant will be crazy busy and what usually happens is that restaurant can't handle the crowd, provides terrible service, and closes ""temporarily."" This was NOT the case today at Cheesecake Factory.  The grand opening was today and this was by far the best experience I've had at a new restaurant.  You can tell they have a solid system and they took the time to train the staff.  It also looks like they had seasoned Cheesecake Factory workers there too to assist.  The customer service, the food, the location, everything about it did not disappoint.   If you love avocado, the avocado rolls are a must!"
Rob V.,"Honolulu, HI",0,38,70,5.0,9/30/2017,"This place is awesome! My wife and I went out The Cheesecake Factory, her favorite place to eat.  Downside, Friday night wait time was between 65-80 minutes.  Luckily we live close by so had time to wait it out at home.  The front door greeters were very polite.  We waited for 80 minutes and finally a couple of seats opened up.  Downside, they put us right next to a band that was playing, soo close that I could reach out and touch the guitar being played.  Just a recommendation to not have a couples table soo close to the band.  Most couples would like to talk out on a date.  It's easy to reconfigure the layout cause the tables and chairs are mobile.  You should put a bigger party table closer to the band, but at least 5-7 feet away and not an arm length.   We had an amazing server who was very attentive (Sheralynn M.).  She observed from my body language that I was getting a little annoyed with the live band app close to my ears that she asked if we would like to move to a different location. We moved and ordered a couple of meals.  Our food didn't get to us until another 45 minutes.  Understandable since the place was packed.  I enjoyed dining here, but may think about doing so on a less busy day. The food was awesome!!!"
Kathryn L.,"Provo, UT",123,36,8,5.0,10/13/2017,"Very impressed with our experience here at the Cheesecake Factory! I'm a fan of CF in general, & this location totally lived up to my expectations! We did have to wait a while, about an hour, to be seated (although they originally told us 90 mins so we ended up waiting significantly less than predicted). But I'd read the reviews & I knew this was a new location so the wait was anticipated.  The most important thing, of course, was the food! Every dish received rave reviews. I had the Mac n cheese burger which was, frankly, incredible. The cheesecake was obviously wonderful.  Our service was also excellent! Our server was extremely attentive & didn't forget a single thing. I was very impressed!"
L O.,"Kapolei, HI",0,19,,3.0,9/22/2017,Pros and cons... Positives: Nice kids menu Reasonable wait time at 4pm on Friday Good decor and spacious Negatives: Took a long time to get drinks and food  Charged incorrectly  Took long time to get bill fixed Waited about 30 minutes for one slice of to go cheesecake after paying bill To go dessert slice very small :( Server seemed overwhelmed and lacked urgency but her assistant was super attentive  Managers should be walking around more  They are so packed that they probably won't be concerned with a few unhappy customers.
EatWithAri F.,"Ewa Beach, HI",104,6,8,5.0,11/5/2017,"Well done on the new location & only a minutes wait! Not as much local staff as I'd like to have seen but I understand they did JUST open, so I'm gonna believe that's a contributing circumstance. Service timing was on point, food was great, and I appreciate how the staff helped each other out with us! TIP: Chicken Piccata is always amazing if you are in the mood for lemon-buttery pasta indulgence. Stoked I don't have to travel into Waikiki for decadent cheesecake! I tried the not too sweet, not too spiced, & definitely delicious Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake this time! I't was exactly what I was craving! ~ @eatwithari"
Jeffrey B.,"Mililani, HI",26,73,25,5.0,9/15/2017,It was by invitation only.  My wife and I enjoyed a limited menu but was worth it.  I had the factory meatloaf and she had the turkey pot pie.  Both were very good.  They gave me so much that I had to take the rest home.  The best part was the Pecan and pumpkin pie.  Allowed only one slice and we shared.  But no problem.  Even better was that tonight's meal was FREE!  Grand Opening is on September 25th.  Call ahead
Tin T.,"Honolulu, HI",70,10,1,1.0,10/12/2017,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I got the shrimp scampi and it was super bland and the pasta was super dry. Waitress asked how it tasted and I told her it was super bland and she offered if I wanted something else. I decided to get the salmon. I waited at least 30 mins for the salmon. I got tired of waiting and asked for a manager. The manager didn't even come by. I was very disappointed of how long we had to wait. The person I asked to call for their manager tells me 10 mins later that he's coming. I told him nvm that's okay because I wasn't gonna wait anymore longer. I decided to take the salmon to go and finally got to take a bite of it and it was also bland and under cooked. Sorry,  but I am not eating here again."
Lynn F.,"Waimalu, HI",118,9,4,5.0,10/17/2017,I had the shrimp with angel hair pasta and my husband had the spaghetti with meatballs. Portion size was big and delicious!! Had to pack for home lunch so I could try their cheesecake !! We ordered white chocolate mac nut and chocolate hazelnut. Not disappointed!! Jeremy was our waiter and he was on point the whole time!! Thank you Jeremy!!
