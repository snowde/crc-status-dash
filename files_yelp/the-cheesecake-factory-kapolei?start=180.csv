Rhea M.,"Kapolei, HI",6,18,5,5.0,10/11/2017,"When I found out that there was going to be a Cheesecake Factory in the west side I was extremely excited!! No more driving to Waikiki!  I've heard stories from friends about the looooong wait times, but my sister and I have managed to miss the lunch/dinner rush by dining in before or right after the rush. So I'd probably recommend that if you're not up to wait a long time We have dined here a couple times already and we have had nothing but amazing service. Always greeted and the servers we've had (ugh, can't remember their names) but they all seem very professional and have awesome customer service  Will be back in the near future!!"
Rita L.,"Mililani, HI",257,547,29,4.0,9/28/2017,"I'm so glad Cheesecake factory is closer to my side of the island. Tip if you wanna go lunch, go early. They open at 1130 we stood in line at 1115 and got in. Service was fast but sometimes I felt like they hovered too much. Every 7 minutes someone came by to check on us and wanted to wrap our food when we weren't even done eating. Dinnertime is busy, if u have a party of 2, go to the bar area. I love eating Chicken Mediera, Pasta Di Vinci, Lettuce wraps, avocado rolls, and the tamale. I will be a frequent visitor,  I need to try more food off the menu."
Di C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",10,41,29,5.0,10/9/2017,"Ambience was awesome! Live band playing music did a great job! Food was tasty including desserts.  Waiter did a great job of providing service, information and suggestion on food. Very helpful and warmth. Even made conversation other than restaurant talk. We enjoyed our waiter!"
Tracey E.,"Waianae, HI",0,4,1,5.0,10/16/2017,"I came fully prepared for a 2 hour wait & for the order to be mixed up or delayed.  To my pleasant surprise our wait was about 10 minutes & the food was good & prompt. Our server, Austen definitely impacted our experience as he was very helpful & gave great recommendations. He was attentive & a complete joy to be around.  5 stars  for his exemplary service!"
Eiichi J.,"Kapolei, HI",231,11,15,5.0,11/27/2017,"Tried it for the first time since it opened in Kapolei and definitely will be back for more! The Hibachi Steak is ""broke da mouth"" good. Everyone on our table loved their entree. They're open late and that fits into my schedule well because of my late hours. 5 Stars!"
Jamie N.,"Waipahu, HI",163,17,61,4.0,10/7/2017,"SO HAPPY that I don't have to drive all the way to Waikiki to eat at The Cheesecake Factory anymore! Now they have this new location at Ka Makana with tons of free parking! So my friend and I decided to eat here for an early lunch on Thursday...hoping the wait time wouldn't be too long. We waited about 5 minutes or so before being seated which was awesome! However, we made the mistake of telling the hostess that we were ok with sitting outside (we didn't want to wait longer) because boy was it HOT!  When we were seated to our table, I had to dust off the booth seat because there was so many crumbs and some ants, yuck! I ordered the Mexican chicken lettuce wrap tacos ($8), which I enjoyed, and my friend and I shared the cookie dough cheesecake. You can never go wrong with any of their cheesecakes! Our waitress was friendly and came to check up on us a couple of times. I'll definitely be back but will probably ask to sit inside next time."
Carrie T.,"Pearl City, HI",38,3,,4.0,10/6/2017,"The food was great..if came out really fast, and when I say fast it came out shortly after receiving our appetizers. The only downfall about the whole experience is that it took about 30 minutes just to receive WATER!!! What the fck!?!?! I mean I was so desperate I was ready to go and drink from the sink in the bathroom. Our waiter was awesome even thou he seemed like he was all over the place, and the food was great.  Ready to pay our bill and guess what..now they come to refill our water..TWICE I might add.."
Hilda C.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,12,,5.0,10/14/2017,"Hubby and I went to CCF one afternoon before a med. appointment. We were in a line for a short period( 5min +-) we were greeted by a staff member who seated us outside. We ordered right away VEGAN food. They recommend veggi burger ( rice, black bean..etc)   An hour later no food. Really? At that point everyone around us had their meals. We were frustrated because 1. we were crunching for time and 2. We had waited so long. We expressed our disappointment in their service. The manager ""Slade "" if I remember correctly was very kind. He apologized for the long wait..... the burger was very delicious. The reasons for the five star review:       1. Clean relaxing environment        2. Great knowledgeable staff/ Slade       3. Bread addictive/ great food"
Lorlay B.,"Waipahu, HI",5,35,89,5.0,9/29/2017,I know this place is new and we all think long line but for some reason I didn't have to wait during lunch time (1215). I had to give 5 stars and service was awesome. Even the people who brought our food was nice. Talk story an all. Such good local service. They have a small plate menu...gotta try the cheese bread with bacon!  Sooooooo yummmm. The desserts are already a given. Good job with the new location!
Tom S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/5/2018,This place is so noisy our waiter couldn't hear our orders. Food was mediocre. Service was slow and unfriendly. Prices are high. I won't be going back.
Donna Lyn B.,"O‘ahu, HI",307,260,1433,5.0,9/20/2017,"My party of 6 decided to dine here on their grand opening day.  At 5-ish PM, there was obviously going to be a long wait when we saw lots of people waiting outside.  We waited patiently outside for 90 minutes as was told the projected wait time, then we waited anxiously for 30 more minutes before we finally got a table.  We got the same warm fresh baked bread.  The entrees came out pretty quickly, but our appetizers weren't brought until after that.  I always order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which was better than what I've had at the Waikiki location.  Then we ordered a round of cheesecakes.  The Celebration Cheesecake tastes way sweeter than the other cheesecakes I've had before.  The service there was great even when getting slammed on their grand opening.  Our server even handled our to-go orders pretty well.  We had three servers come by to bring food and refill drinks.  On the way out, I thought it was so nice for practically every employee like the hostesses and servers near the exit wave and say goodbye and to have a great evening on the way out.  It made me feel like they truly appreciated our patronage.  Super grateful that The Cheesecake Factory is now in Kapolei so we don't have to drive all the way out to Waikiki to their first location."
Richard L.,"Honolulu, HI",134,53,36,5.0,10/18/2017,I was pleasantly surprised with the customer service and the quality of the food which exceeded my expectation and I left satisfied.  I would definitely go back. Their service was way better than CPK Kapolei and so as the food.  No wonder why the wait time is a lil bit longer because it's always busy and I understand. It's worth the wait. Great job management and chefs!
Karen C.,"Aiea, HI",35,38,35,5.0,10/9/2017,This is another class act restaurant with great service & great food!! Never go wrong eating here anytime!! There was a long line snaking when the restaurant opened mid-day so the servers came outside to prop umbrellas up & serve water to everyone in the hot sun. Once inside the servers were very fast & attentive. The food is always delish so one can keep coming back over & over again to try new things. It's already my second time and I'll keep coming back.
Sarah P.,"Waipahu, HI",25,15,9,5.0,9/28/2017,"My family & I (party of 4), came here around 4pm on a Thursday and there was absolutely no wait - yay! The service provided by Deivan was amazing. He was friendly, attentive, enthusiastic, and accommodating. His suggestions were welcomed & it showed his familiarity with the menu (the extensive menu ever, lol!!). We were never in need of refills because he was always one step ahead of us! All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the food & service, & we will definitely be back again. I suggest coming at a ""down time."" Around 5pm, it does get super busy, so be prepared to wait! Thank you, Deivan & staff, for a great first experience at this new location! :)"
Punahele K.,"Waimanalo, HI",32,4,2,4.0,10/7/2017,"Headed over to CF for dinner on the weekend they opened.  Needless to say, the wait time was 3 hours but that was expected.  We were lucky enough to have my brother and his family (who live across the street) get a pager 2 hours before we trucked it over there from the windward side.   The hostess was very accommodating for our party of 10 and the waitress that waited on us was very helpful in choosing the best that CF had to offer.  The following week, we were in the neighborhood and headed to CF for cheesecake to take out.  The wait time to dine in was a 2 hour wait for lunch.  So it seemed the wait time is still long.  But there's so much stores to check out, that 2 hours seems like 30 minutes. Overall, great experience! We'd definitely would come back."
Kelsha H.,"Waipahu, HI",114,2,3,5.0,10/26/2017,Went around lunch time for a quick bite with a friend and it was perfect timing to come in. It wasn't busy as all. The food was amazing and our server was very helpful with my friend's questions about the menu. Highly recommend one of their specialty plates called the Chicken Bellagio.
Lindsey S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,22,4,4.0,10/5/2017,"We waited for about 40 minutes on Wednesday evening around 6:30. Got our ""buzzer"" and were able to walk around the mall with it to kill time. Our food was quick and delicious and our server Celeste was wonderful. We ordered the calamari, chicken bites, fish tacos and chicken parm pizza style. We were so full, we had to share a piece of vanilla bean cheesecake and almost couldn't finish it.  Overall we had a great experience, but wish they took call ahead seating and/or reservations. Didn't think it would be as full on a week night but when we left close to 8pm, the outside was packed with people still waiting. We will definitely be returning soon!"
Marj G.,"Honolulu, HI",44,10,7,5.0,10/4/2017,"So delicious, clean , and awesome service. Alyssa is really informative and gives great service. She knows the menu and the food. Wonderful experience . I came between lunch and dinner. Best time to avoid the crowds. I had the luau salad lunch special, raspberry lemonade... with bread! Perfect meal! Oh, I ordered cheesecake to go of course."
Wallyn C.,"Ala Moana, Honolulu, HI",269,62,34,5.0,10/25/2017,"A whole bunch of us went on Oct 11th for a surprise birthday party. Nice atmosphere and good menu choices.  However they ran out of a choice (steak in particular) and I asked for a substitute. At first the waitress said she couldn't substitute...I asked her to double check with the manager.  The manager came out and he was awesome.  He ""created"" a dish for me... ribeye steak with salmon. He was da bomb. Unfortunately he went back to San Diego.  Because of him I'm giving them 5 stars..otherwise they would've gotten 3 1/2 to 4 stars."
