Yummers P.,"Kapolei, HI",0,7,6,5.0,9/29/2017,Service is terrific and food is delicious!  We were lucky and only waited for about 15 minutes.  Will definitely be returning in the near future
Kryssy T.,"Waipahu, HI",0,14,3,5.0,9/28/2017,"I visited on September 28, 2017 right at opening. My party and I actually showed up an hour early (10:30a) to wait in line because we've been seeing reviews and heard from friends that a line forms pretty early. When we got there at 10:30a there was no one there so we just waited in line. By the time 11:00a rolled around the line was starting to wrap around the building. In any case, we were seated right away when they opened at 11:30a.  Our server, Kelly, was amazing! She was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager even came around to our table to check on us (she was going around to all the tables), which was nice. You can tell that this Cheesecake Factory location took the time to really train their staff. Everyone provided such great service which is rare considering they just opened last week. I usually like to wait a little before going to a new restaurant to let them work out their kinks (i.e. Poorly trained staff, food not being cooked right, etc), but this Cheesecake Factory location seems to have their stuff together from the get go.  For the food review, I ordered an avocado toast and Caesar salad. Let me just say, I highly recommend the avocado toast! It was soooo good (and slightly messy). The Caesar salad portion was HUGE! Had I known the portion size was so big I would've ordered something else. It still tasted good so that's all that matters. For dessert I had the celebration cheesecake which was like a funfetti cake with chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla mousse w/ cheesecake on top (soooo good!).  Overall I'll definitely be back at this location. I'm hoping the wait times die down a little to the point where I don't feel like I need to show up an hour before opening just to be one of the first ones seated lol."
Valerie L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,8,,2.0,12/30/2017,The food was alright but I can't believe the long wait. One of the worker's told me I should check in early like 4:30 so I wouldn't have to wait long well I checked in at 4:15pm for a party of 14 and we didn't get seated until 6:20pm then we had to wait another 45 minutes for our food. So we spent a total of 4 hours there mostly waiting. That's way to long especially if you have hungry kids. Not sure what the hype is about this place it's ok but not worth wasting 4 hours for. Most Restraunt's will get you in and out in as little as 1-2 hours the most.
Stacey O.,"Pearl City, HI",1,1,,5.0,11/30/2017,"Good food fast,quick and friendly service. Just what the West side needed! The Avocado Toast is great to share and I was pleasantly surprised by the many vegan and vegetarian options. Someone once told me a great sign of good service is that your cup should never be empty. Well the team at the Kapolei location sure lives up to that hallmark."
Claudia M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,9,,4.0,10/11/2017,"My sister-in-law and I went for brunch, which they serve one Saturdays and Sundays. It took us 3 hours to eat. Wait time for a table was 30-45 minutes. They're literally /always/ busy, so no matter what time of day, there is going to be a wait time. :-) The food took a little while to come out, but it's understandable because they're a new restaurant and there's bound to be kinks to work out.  There's a lot of options on the menu to choose from. I ordered some sort of pasta (this was a week ago, so I don't remember), the spinach and cheese dip with chips, and the stuffed mushrooms. The spinach dip wasn't that great, in my opinion. There wasn't a whole lot of cheese in it, so it mostly just tasted like spinach. I order spinach and artichoke dip literally everywhere, so it fell flat for me. However, the stuffed mushrooms were absolutely delicious! I'm in love with them, and will probably order 4 orders of them next time I go here. At the beginning of our meal, we told our waitress that we were going to order some eggs benedict for my brother. We reminded her mid-meal about it, and expected it to be out when we were finished. However, something went wrong (either their waffle maker broke, or they made the hollandaise sauce wrong and had to remake it. We were given two explanations haha), so we waited almost 40 minutes for it post-meal. What was nice though was that manangers were present on the floor to apologize for the wait times. He explained to us what happened, and even though it wasn't necessary, he took the eggs benedict off of our bill to compensate for the wait :-) I thought that was nice. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. I will probably come again when things die down a little more, especially for those stuffed mushrooms. *A*"
Patrick I.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,10,,3.0,12/7/2017,"The best thing about the Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake. The food overall is ok, priced a little to high for be just ok. But if you are looking for a late night desert grab a slice of Cheesecake, some champagne, and enjoy the night with that special someone."
Carrie M.,"Kapolei, HI",0,1,5,5.0,9/19/2017,So excited to have Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei.  I was very impressed with them on their grand opening day.  Food was delicious and plentiful (only 1 person finished all their food).  Service was great.  Now we are waiting for dessert while listening to live music.  We will definitely be back again.
Ana R.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",0,16,13,3.0,11/25/2017,"First time here and we sat at the kiddie side of the bar. The bartenders were amazing which is why the review is even half way decent. I asked for the four cheese pasta and my husband asked for the carbonara with chicken. My pasta was cold. The cheese was stuck to the plate. Like it had been melted and then left there to get cold. Couldn't finish more than half of it. My husbands was super hot, barely edible and the chicken breast ended up being three slices of chicken. Never again. Had it not been for the bartenders the review would have been the negative stars they deserved. What a disappointment ñ."
Marvin B.,"Kaneohe, HI",562,85,11,4.0,10/21/2017,"This is the third time I ate at the kapolei location. Every time was always a pleasant experience. The servers are friendly and better than I expected. The food was also amazing as well. I love the large portions for the dishes. You never go hungry at the Cheesecake Factory. So far I ordered the Cuban sandwich (loved it), the blue cheese burger (scrumptious) and numerous cheesecakes. All the cheesecakes are tasty. Just remember to make room for desert. Parking is plentiful. Just make sure you go early so you don't have to wait in the long line of people wanting a table."
Kaylin W.,"Kapolei, HI",0,6,2,5.0,10/2/2017,"My first experience here was good, it was pretty busy around lunch time but we got our food in a timely manner. On top of that the steak tacos is what I recommend!! So delicious. Just look at that"
Chantele C.,"Pearl City, HI",47,5,10,4.0,10/11/2017,"The first time we went. It was during the opening week. It was busy and we had to leave too. So we decided to get Cheesecake to go. We ordered 4 slices and ended up waiting 30minutes for our order. Besides the wait, the worker we nice and the cheesecakes we delicious. This past time, we went at 10pm on 10/5/17 Thursday. Tables were open so there was no wait time. We had a polite server and the food was delicious. We plan on going again tomorrow"
Aileen S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,12,9,5.0,9/15/2017,"Finally on the west side! This invitation only event is some sort of a dry run. The ""limited menu"" offered didn't feel limited at all. There were enough choices from the bar, appetizer, main course, and dessert menus. Portions were huge so we definitely had leftovers. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating (hosts, servers, and bussers.) We waited a little bit for our drinks but that didn't bother us at all since everything else was great. Highlights: crab & cheese dip appetizer, the Blue Hawaiian drink, and the classic cheesecake. Overall, a good start."
Jen C.,"Honolulu, HI",17,14,36,5.0,9/30/2017,"Our first time going to this location at kamakana alii, the atmosphere is the same as the one at Waikiki. We came there on a weekday during lunch and ofcourse we had to wait for about 30 mins but it was worth it. The receptionist girl was professional, greets everybody with a smile, she's very welcoming. Our server I think his name was dick?or rick?hmm he was okay. Food was da bomb. I tried the Thai lettuce wraps, even the lady that served it said it was her favorite, she was super nice. My husband ordered the chicken Madeira and the fried mac and cheese. And we always order their smoothies, the tropical one and the iced mango. For the cheesecake I had the salted caramel and hubby had the fresh strawberries. Overall it was A pleasant experience."
Jessica R.,"Tacoma, WA",0,9,12,4.0,10/24/2017,"Tonight was our First time at this cheesecake factory. We were told it would be about 15 mins for 2 but our pager started buzzing not even 1 min later. Followed to host back to our table but someone else had decided to switch tables so we were offered a different one but it was small and really close to another Party so we said we would wait a few mins for another booth to be cleaned. After about 5 mins or so we were led to the booth and given the extremely extensive menu... (largest menu of any ckf) looked over it a while while waiting for the waitress. We did wait longer than usual for the waitress to greet us, but its a very large resturant so i understood. I ordered the chicken pot pie and my husband ordered a salad... i cant remember the name but it came with 2 colored beats and he liked it. A different waiter brought out my husbands salad and informed us they were out of something for the chicken pot pie which was disappointing that they let us know after bringing my husbands meal.. but i ordered the shepherds pie instead. Our waitress,  Stephanie came to check on us and was upset that they waited so long to tell us about my meal so she got a manager who came over soon after and appologized, was very nice and got me a salad on the house while i waited. Come to find out the chef was able to make the chicken pot pie so they asked if i still wanted that and i did so they brought it out maybe 1 min later. Everyone was very nice and apologetic about the mishap so i wasnt too upset especially knowing the chef was able to figure it out after initially thinking they couldnt do it. The pot pie was so good when it came out too!  Also there was a leak coming from the roof since it had been raining all day, but we were informed about it before sitting down which was nice, and we didnt mind. Stuff happens!  We also ordered a dulce de leche cheesecake to go which was amazing!! Overall i was very pleased with the politeness of all of the staff and eagerness to fix our situations for us. Stephanie was a great waitress with a great attitude! We will definitely be coming back!"
Noelle S.,"Waialua, HI",19,3,,3.0,11/15/2017,"Ate dinner here tonight. Had reservations, but was not seated until 30-45 minutes later. We had a lot of pupus for a large family so I didn't have much appetite for my main entree. Ate a few bites and had the waitress pack it to go. Only when I got home did I realize my take home food was less than HALF of what I left on my plate. What did they do with the rest of my food? Next time, I'll bag my own food to take home."
Melissa P.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,6,,4.0,11/22/2017,"A little bit overpriced and the fries weren't as good as I remember them being in the past, but the food in general is usually very good. Cheesecake is divine! I had the key-lime and it was paradise in my mouth!"
Tati A.,"Pearl City, HI",58,16,7,4.0,11/8/2017,"I'm so glad they finally opened! My go to is always the Thai lettuce wraps, I love the light yet full of flavor dish. You are able to customize the wrap to your taste, adding more veggies or chicken. The only complaint with this location is the parking, it wouldn't be so bad if there was covering over the parking like the Waikiki location. I would recommend going either at 3pm-5pm or when they just open to avoid the crowd."
J O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,16,2.0,12/24/2017,"Not as good as the Waikiki location. I have been twice, and I can't quite pin it, but the flavors seem off, smaller portions. The wait staff are okay. The hostess for our last visit seemed rude and standoffish."
Eric M.,"Haleiwa, HI",56,12,3,1.0,12/1/2017,"Line was long and they were running a little behind.  Not a big deal.  Sat at table and after 10 mins got board.  Started looking at the silverware and started noticing food particles and the knives look as if they wipe them and put the back on the table.  No server yet so we decide to leave.  Probably just a fluke but when issue was brought up, no one seem to care."
Shyrus K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,5.0,12/7/2017,"Absolutely love the Hibachi Steak with bean sprouts and shiitake mushrooms, had them replace the fried asparagus with green beans! The service was amazing from when we walked in to when we left. Keep up the good work!"
