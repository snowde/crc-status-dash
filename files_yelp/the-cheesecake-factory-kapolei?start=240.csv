Chennelle D.,"Waipahu, HI",34,3,10,1.0,11/6/2017,"This was my first ever visit to a Cheesecake Factory ever. I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while but after hearing all the mixed feelings about prices and food I finally decided to take my family for a night out and eat there. We got to the restaurant to check in at about 6:30pm and my wait was about 1 hour and 10 minutes. I couldn't get a pager because their policy was if the wait was more than 1 hr then the customer would have to come back for a pager. Since my wait was so long I left to shop and came back 1 hour later to ask how much longer the wait was. The hostess gave us a pager and said the wait would be about 15-20 minutes more. So we sat and waited for about 30 more minutes and I went back to the hostess and asked how much longer then wait was because our pager didn't buzz. They immediately sat us in a booth shortly after that at about 8:30pm. While looking through our menu our server came to the table to greet us. I first ordered drinks and food for my kids and I got a Lava Flow to start while I looked through the menu. While my cousin and I continued to look through the menu we received really hard bread and a slab of butter. The bread was sooooooo dry, hard, and cold. I was stuck between ordering a Ribeye, a Shepherds Pie, and a Chicken Piccata. I decided to get a Chicken Piccata and I had to drain all the fat and oil from my plate first before eating! I took few bites and all I could taste was the lemon...I spoke with the waiter and showed him the plates of oil I drained from my plate. He said it was from all the combined ingredients in the dish. I asked to talk to a manager. The manager came to my table and squatted next to me and waited for me to say something first. Then instead of trying to offer me a better experience he asked my what I wanted to do! He also gave my bullshit ass excuses as to how dish is supposed to be a heavy lemon and butter sauce and it probably separated while on the way to my table because it was too hot in the dining area lol. My cousin and I were like what the hell was he talking about! Then he asked me if I wanted to plate my food. I was fed up at that point. I let my server know what he said and his response was ""He said that? Interesting..."" lol. At least he understood where I was coming from. My cousin and I ordered a cheesecake for my kids and we ordered some food to go. I got my to go food plates up but when I looked at it there was some beef under cooked and and the veggies were cut up in chunks . It just looked completely unappealing. Another waiter came to our table with food my cousin ordered to go but it wasn't packed to go lol. At that point our server was fed up. We could tell by the irritated look on his face while he walked past our table after seeing they didn't pack our order to go. I paid for all the food and still tipped my server about $30 because I get bad he had to listen to all my complaints. Bottom line I'm never going there again if that the type of food and customer I'm gonna get from a manager! I'd rather go to California Pizza kitchen next door! I ate my Shepherds Pie I ordered to go later that night and there was soooooooo much fat in the food which tell me the cooks didn't bother to drain the beef before combining it with all the other ingredients in the dish."

Kt D.,"Kapolei, HI",0,10,,3.0,12/26/2017,"Food is poorly prepared.  I came here once shortly after their grand opening and my favorite dish (Evelyn's pasta) was terrible. I ordered the pasta with no pine nuts. Sadly it was SO salty and the pasta- undercooked. Waited forever since they originally made it with nuts but corrected it before it got to my table, thankfully. Awful, I waited all that time for a below average dish. We couldn't wait to leave. Service was not great, but I expect that from a new crew.  Fast forward to today, we thought ok maybe they've gotten it together since first opening and our experience will be better. Ok, so this time we sat at the bar, and our bartender Sheri (I think that's her name) was lovely. She made our drinks properly and was very accommodating, as well as the gentleman behind the bar. So thumbs up to them. Food came out in a timely manner. Although, the man who came to drop off the food was very awkward, he needs more training.  My food was not good... I ordered the ""Cajun"" chicken little dish which is breaded chicken bites with corn succotash and mashed potatoes. Sheri, our bartender immediately recognized my plate was missing the sauces and called upon another employee to get me my sauces. Sheri clearly has experience in this industry, she's great. The sauces were not good though. Kinda bizarre tasting. Why is my Cajun chicken coming with a bbq and honey mustard sauce? And more importantly what is Cajun about the chicken? It didn't have any spices on the chicken or in the breading? The sauces weren't Cajun? I'm so confused. The plate was so sloppy. Huge portion of mashed potatoes and a flick of corn. It looked like someone ate half of my corn. It was so unpleasant.  This is so disappointing for a Cheesecake Factory. I expect way more and would like to see this location improve on the food. Hire more experienced employees in the kitchen. What is a restaurant with an experienced bartender but amateur cooks? I compared the taste and preparation of the food to Applebee's. And I despise Applebee's.  Dear Cheesecake Factory,  you're better than this. 2 stars for food. 4 stars for service. 3 stars overall."
Chantel C.,"Raleigh, NC",104,14,2,3.0,9/23/2017,"This is one of our favorite ""chain restaurants"".. However this location is just not meeting our expectations..  So we tried to go for dinner.. The front door was overly swarmed with people, you could barely get to the front to even put your name on the list. The wait times are unreal almost 2 hours for a table! And you don't take reservations -so disappointing. And then for bar section seating people act like vultures to jump into the chairs those poor people sitting there can't enjoy their meal when people are swarming around them. The hostess we spoke with told us ""60 minutes wait"" .. Well 60 minutes came and went.. We went back up there since many others after us started to get seated so we were just curious what the time for us to get seated was she told us another 60 - 90 minutes EXTRA. We said oh no.. And went elsewhere.  Fast forward came for lunch today .. Thinking maybe its a lunch time thing. We were told again 60 minute wait.. We said fine and watched for bar seating at the actual bar. Finally two seats opened we sit. The bar staff were really friendly. They were slammed but they tried to make the best of the wait times. We ordered food ..got the food it was good- however it did seem the kitchen was very backed up.  Overall it was a ""good"" expierence .. If we are here again it would be takeout.. Its just too much to deal with those long wait times. Hope it improves over time ."
Mark K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,3,,1.0,10/20/2017,"Great food...Poor Customer Service. After being seated, I told our server that we are celebrating my wife's birthday. She congratulated my wife, asked her name and it ended there. The 2 hours that we were there I must of heard half a dozen birthday songs from the staff but none for our table...Epic Fail! After we ate pupus and finished we were sitting around for 25-30 minutes before our dishes arrived. Manager came out to apologize...Epic Fail!! Then it took 15 minutes for the server to come back after requesting take out containers and the dessert menu...Epic Fail!!! Talking to one of the managers was like talking to a deer in headlights and after telling him so, I asked to speak to his supervisor. After speaking to the manager, she understood the poor customer service and apologized. I knew we should have gone to California Pizza Kitchen :("
Alicia B.,"Grand Junction, CO",201,2,1,3.0,9/23/2017,"So let me just start off by saying I know Cheesecake Factory just opened and you guys are crazy busy but the service tonight was terrible. Being a sever myself I have some patience when I see it is busy and what not but tonight I waited 45 minutes to get my alcoholic drinks, mind you we didn't even get water yet! We reminded our sever multiple times about the water at the least but it never came so we had to ask another sever in the next section for some waters which he got promptly.  Our sever recommended the Buffalo Blasts, it was alright kinda too oily for me. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo which was super delish!! Also the only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars. I ordered the Chicken Madeira. I ordered it because it was the most popular chicken dish but it wasn't all that great. The chicken was drenched in the sauce looking like a soup. Plus there was just way too much mushrooms I couldn't even see my chicken. I was so over everything I didn't want any dessert because I didn't wanna wait another 45 minutes for that too.  Overall I would go back again and pray we don't get the same sever.. She was super sweet but what happened tonight was unacceptable. Plus I want to try some else from their huge menu."
Christi L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,51,,4.0,11/15/2017,Really enjoyed eating here / was my grandson bday and they sang happy birthday to him and he had birthday cheesecake ! Awesome ! The servers really attentive / food was good .
Elizabeth S.,"Honolulu, HI",36,38,35,1.0,11/7/2017,"Service was extremely poor. They opened not too long ago but they need to get it together. We sat there for 30 minutes before anyone came to help. After someone came to help, we ordered our food and it got there at a good pace. No waitress ever came to check up on us while eating. We got done eating and had to hunt down another waitress for help. Couldn't order anything else because of bad service. There was random waitress just standing talking to people doing nothing. Had a horrible experience and won't be coming back until restaurant has been open for a while."
Mhel L.,"Wahiawā, HI",71,17,20,4.0,11/5/2017,Our first experience at Kapolei's Cheesecake Factory was a plus.  We did not wait long; 30 minutes max.  I suggest getting there early for parties  6 or more.  Our servers were friendly and we got our food in under 30 minutes despite the crowd during its peak dinner hour.  The outdoor seating was amazing with the band.  We will definitely return.
Li B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/27/2017,"My fiancé and I just had dinner here (Dec 27th around 4:30) and were disappointed with our first visit. It was 15 minutes for water and the server dropped our bread basket all on the table and didn't try to clean it so I did, which is fine since the place seemed kind of hectic at the time we went, so no big issue. But our server basically disappeared because two different servers came to bring us our food and didn't check in. Which our food didn't seem too appetizing since it looked like presentation wasn't a big deal. Our food looked tossed onto the plate like you'd receive at a cafeteria during school mixed with a ton of black pepper and it was extremely oily. Our server did a 'walk by check' twice, which I call when you walk quickly by and ask the question but not fully ask it and have us the customers not even say a word to you before you go on and disappear again. After a while we just stopped eating and she quickly took our plates to disappear again. We even got dessert after our entrees from a different server. The bill was something interesting as well. We gave her our gift card and cash to pay but she threw away the original copy in this process somehow and gave us a different copy of the receipt which had some scribbles on it. But we didn't receive our change! I mean I would think we would get change back but she quickly said ""here's your copy of the receipt. I threw away the original on accident so we had to reprint it. You guys have a good holiday"" and walked away quickly. My fiancé and I were kinda of confused since that happened fast. So we left pretty irritated that service could have been better and mainly how a server automatically thought to keep our change as tip. We didn't even know what our change was. Sad to say we won't be going to any Cheesecake Factories for a long while."
Sh E.,"Hanamaulu, HI",0,19,,2.0,11/23/2017,"Love The Cheesecake Factory in Waikīkī, but rarely go there because of the trek from Kapolei. Was so excited, then, when I found out that TCF was coming to our moku. Went the other night for a belated birthday celebration and it was, ok, at best.  Ordered the wings appetizer, chicken and biscuits, fettucine alfredo and shrimp, kids spaghetti, kids chocolate sundae, chicken costolleta, lemon-herb roasted chicken, and chocolate mousse cheesecake. We ate family style so I got to taste all the dishes. WINGS: okay, standard bar fare. CHICKEN and BISCUITS: chicken was bland, unseasoned, despite the 'gravy', which was also bland. Also, biscuits were pretty bad. Nothing like a buttermilk biscuit. I've had frozen biscuits from Walmart that taste better and have a better texture.  Carrots were overcooked. There were about 10 peas (I love peas, I counted them) in the dish. Mashed potatoes perfect as always. CHICKEN COSTOLLETA: okay, supposed to be sauteed to a 'crispy brown'. Was more like a kind-of crispy tan. Again, the sauce was minimal and bland. Mashed potatoes perfect as always. LEMON-HERB ROASTED CHICKEN: got this to save up for lunch the next day because the screen above the desserts flashed a pic of this and it looked super good. Again, the chicken was bland and accompanied by an anemic amount of carrots. Mashed potatoes perfect as always. FETTUCINE ALFREDO & SHRIMP: at $22.50, it was not noteworthy enough (or at all) to ever order again.  So very little pasta for the price.  Sauce was overpoweringly creamy-very one note of richness. KIDS SPAGHETTI: standard marinara spaghetti is one of those dishes that is hard to cook poorly. The noodles were cooked but dried, as if it was left under a heating lamp, perhaps.  My daughter ate just a few bites despite the fact that she usually eats oodles of noodles. KIDS HOT FUDGE SUNDAE: good hard ice-cream. A bit overpriced at $4.95 for a kids serving. CHOCOLATE MOUSE CC: perfect, per usual. SERVICE: Excellent! Excellent! From the hostess to waiter to busser to manager. Very attentive, pleasant, and professional. With tax and tip, the meal came out to $150.  We ended up taking more than half of it home because it just wasn't onolicious enough to eat it all up.  I can think of a bunch of other restaurants where I can walk away completely satisfied and feel that the $150 was worth it. The Cheesecake Factory at Kapolei, unfortunately for me, isn't one of those places. RE: the manager post below--I'm not Kevin."
Kelli H.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,4.0,12/23/2017,"I love cheesecake factory. Good food, good portion size just had to give 4 stars for the wait. I thought waikiki you had to wait long but kamakana alii might be longer."
Tom M.,"Kapolei, HI",1,30,10,5.0,10/29/2017,"Awesome dinner.  Great selection, and very generous portions.  Wait was just 20 minutes on Sunday evening.  Great service and food was delicious. Will be a regular for sure."
Liza C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,5,,5.0,11/29/2017,"Typical Cheesecake Factory, great food, long wait, the works. I want to specially mention the Manager of this location.  He came a few times apologizing for the wait and thanking for our patience.  For local people, Kapolei location is a relief because we don't have to go to tourists-packed Waikiki location."
Lance P.,"Kapolei, HI",753,5,,3.0,11/11/2017,They have some kinks to work out with service and the kitchen but what new restaurant doesn't. Desserts were amazing. Main dishes took an hour + but the General Manager saw we had been waiting on his floor rounds and took care of our bill. A good gesture and for that we'll return in a few weeks.
Stephanie C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",2,34,11,3.0,10/27/2017,"Went in on a Wednesday night around 6:30. Two people so we were sat fairly quick (20 minutes). Our server came to our table within 5-10 minutes to take our drink order and appetizer order. I ordered a hot chocolate because I was a bit cold.  My hot chocolate did not come out with my husband's tea so we asked about it and our server had said ""oh they didn't bring it out? Let me go check."" She brought it out. It was lukewarm but still good. Our appetizers came out pretty quickly but our main course took longer...way longer..an hour later, our server came out to say that they were waiting on my teriyaki chicken to get done. I didn't think it took that long for teriyaki chicken but ok.  After another 30 or so minutes our server came to check on us since we were still waiting for our main course to say, the kitchen said it is almost done. At that point we just asked if we could take it to go. Our server was friendly otherwise would have gotten less stars."
Dee D.,"Waipahu, HI",0,16,19,5.0,11/20/2017,"Never been to the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki because I heard of the long wait.  Figured I'd try the Kapolei location since it's close to my house.   I was impressed! It was busy for lunch but we got  seated in less than 10 mins!  We sat outside.  The interior decor was really nice, open and of course, they entice you with the cheesecakes right at the front.   I counted 34 different cheesecake options on the menu!  Menu had everything for every palate.  They even had a "" light"" menu! Loved that   Our server Mike was awesome, very attentive and always came to check up on us.  The manager JT also came over to let us know our food was  going to be ready soon.  Ordered my fave, the cucumber mojito - which was made exactly the way I like it .  For apps, we got the Spicy Chicken blast.  Sooo good!  Fried won ton filledI with spicy chicken bits served with spicy and blue cheese dipping sauces .   okay it was my cheat day.   I got the Grilled turkey burger and my son got the Spicy pasta and chicken.  No, we couldn't stop there! We got the strawberry cheesecake.  Nice and light.  I was in cheesecake heaven!  Loved this place.  Service  and food  was excellent!  Will definitely be back again!"
Nichele R.,"Honolulu, HI",16,33,30,5.0,9/29/2017,"The service here is so awesome! We came on a busy day as it was a few days after the grand opening. Waited to be seated in 40 mins like the hostess estimated, they give you a beeper, so you can walk around and shop while waiting for a table. Checked in, got seated, the server was so nice, and willing to push our baby stroller to the front near the rest of the strollers that other customers placed in. Her name was Jackie? Not too sure? Offered us complimentary bread and also for my son, with some banana on the side. How nice! He enjoyed it. Although we waited awhile, we didn't care due to the fact of us wanting to eat there for some time and we didn't want to up and leave especially knowing it's busy, so we understood, no biggie :) When we finally got our food, the presentation was impeccable! I loved everything. The birthday cake cheesecake was so good we had to order take out. It's a great portion too for its price! Will be back."
Lyn E.,"Waipahu, HI",0,5,5,5.0,10/30/2017,"Glad another location opened on island. Lots of parking and it's convenient having more options on the west side. We came here on a Saturday for a late lunch, a little after 2pm. There were about 5 parties ahead of us but for 2 people the wait was less than 10 min. The wait can be one hour plus, but you could always walk around the mall to kill time. CPK is just as busy too so you just have to be prepared to wait, especially during weekends and prime lunch/dinner time. Service was good, staff is always friendly. There's so much on the menu to try but my go to is Chicken Madeira and it never disappoints. We just missed brunch so definitely will have to go back and try it out."
Randall S.,"Kaneohe, HI",19,198,63,5.0,10/16/2017,"I never thought I'd see another Cheesecake Factory on this island but here it is.  My family and I love visiting The Cheesecake Factory but it does become a hassle to drive to Waikiki and find parking.  Well, never fear the new location in Ka Makana Ali'i helps to alleviate the parking problem.  The menu isn't as extensive as the Waikiki location but still has a number of great dishes to choose from.  They have a great selection of cheesecakes to order with your meal or to take out.  This location has tables outside and inside the restaurant with the same great service as Waikiki's.  The only disappointment is to expect a wait because they are as popular as their Waikiki location.  But you can't have everything. I've been told that Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights are their busiest times.  Weekdays and nights a little less so.  If you come when they first open, expect to have a line and they have live music!  So come on down and check them out!"
