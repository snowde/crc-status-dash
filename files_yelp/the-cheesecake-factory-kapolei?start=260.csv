Kapi R.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",1,9,3,5.0,11/7/2017,"My husband and I went here on a date and the food was delish!! The place was packed with a wait list, but we went to the open seating bar and ordered food there. We had a wonderful time, friendly staff and great food!! Will definitely eat here again!"
Brittanie A.,"Mililani, HI",37,4,1,4.0,10/23/2017,"Went to eat yesterday Sunday afternoon, of course it's busy. So I knew the wait was probably gonna be long. Went up to the hostess and put our names down around 12:15pm and was quoted about a 40 min wait. Come around 1:15pm I went back to the front and asked how long more since it's been an hour and she said another four tables of four were ahead of us. But then all of a sudden she said oh your pager is ringing. So we finally sit down.  To the person seating us down, to both of the servers that took care of us yesterday was amazing.  Refilling drinks, checking on how the food was, to refilling bread without even really asking. I was amazed, I forgot our two servers names (Tyson,Ryan) I believe.  Even the food runners were also very helpful and friendly. I think it's a good idea having two servers helping each other. Besides the wait, but it's expected since they just opened. Everything was amazing; food,and the customer service"
Stacy C.,"Kapolei, HI",73,3,,3.0,11/15/2017,"Comparing it to Waikiki location, lil more expensive, smaller servings for both our gumbo and chicken Madeira. About 40 percent less gumbo, 2 chicken filets instead of 3 at Waikiki. 30 min wait on Saturday night. Amazing property. Could the price and serving size be due to system wide change or just this location quirks.... Hmmm."
Norleen F.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",0,41,1,5.0,12/24/2017,Went to the Cheesecake Factory two nights ago . The wait was an hour for a party of 5. It took half of that time just to find a parking space . Fortunately we were there with someone familiar with their seating process . We were able to get a table near the bar when we walked in . The menu is extensive and takes time if you are a new comer to the establishment .  Our waiter was excellent . The food was very good and served quickly . We all took cheesecake home with us . It was a Friday night and the place was packed . It was noisy and a bit hard to hold a conversation but . I would recommend this restaurant.
Lynne M.,"Mililani, HI",74,8,2,2.0,11/5/2017,"Went on a Sunday a few weeks back. The line was literally out the door, down the side of the restaurant & at a standstill. Kapolei was scorching & so humid on this day & patrons were wondering why we were waiting so long to be seated. Took awhile for the servers to provide iced water to those of us stuck in line. Anyway, it took about 45mins to be seated. After seating again Water took forever to come : ( another 20mins passes & finally our servers says may I get you something to drink? At that time I opted to give her our entire order to ensure we wouldn't wait another hour. Uugghh still our food took 50mins to come out 30mins for the appetizer! At that point I asked for a 'to go' box. I was not about to spend an entire afternoon there. Horrible service!"
Emilee P.,"Kapolei, HI",17,26,20,4.0,9/19/2017,"Yes, we braved opening day. It was not as bad as I was expecting. They seemed to really have things working smoothly because they have so many trainers and more experienced staff on hand to oversee everything. We sat outside because we didn't want to wait an extra 45 min for an inside table. During the day it is HOT so we will definitely wait for an inside spot next time. My one issue was actually with one of the managers (maybe? a woman walking around not in uniform but overseeing things). I have been ordering the same dish from the Cheesecake Factory in different locations for at least 10 years- Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Being pregnant I was seriously craving this dish. What we got looked nothing like what I have always received in other locations. It was tomato based and not at all creamy. You can see the photos of the regular dish on the Waikiki page, and the menu even states ""Honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan CREAM Sauce"". So we asked this manager (because she was walking around our area) if something had changed with the dish or if we got the wrong one by mistake because it did not look or taste the same. She just laughed and said no, that is the same it's always been, and ""she would know"". We weren't happy with the dish and instead of wanting to fix the problem or offer something else she just dismissed us. I thought that was sort of rude. Besides that encounter, all the other staff were great. We got our cheesecakes to go because you get stuffed on the bread and appetizers alone. Overall, happy to have a location now on the Westside. If you don't want to brave a crowd just order takeout or go up to the cheesecake counter and get a slice to go."
Cynthia Q.,"Honolulu, HI",38,42,6,1.0,11/4/2017,Omg. Not ready to open on time on a Saturday???? Come early only to have to wait 30 min to get seated in a completely empty restaurant? The wait help wasn't even a bit apologetic about the inconvenience. Totally snooty as if we were lucky to even be in line.  Seriously? It's a franchise. Nothing special. First time is the last time unless they get their act together which with the choices nearby may be never. Went to Moena instead. Seated in 5 min. Totally friendly efficient staff. Way better menu choices. Giving them five stars! Wake up Cheesecake and smell the coffee. 1 star because there is no zero.
Joshua O.,"Denton, TX",49,6,,1.0,11/3/2017,"So we walked in, up to the hostess stand where we were looked at immediately and told "" it will be a minute"". Mind you it's 3pm on a weekday. They were not busy. So we seated ourselves in the bar where we waited for 25 minutes and no one ever approached us. So we left! Terrible !"
Dawn M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",92,27,7,3.0,11/3/2017,"I have been going to The Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki since it opened! It's one of my favorite places to eat! So when they were opening one in  Kapolei, I was super excited, since I live so close! I have been to the Kapolei one 3 times now and needless to say, I don't mind driving to Waikiki to get better service and better tasting food! Last night was probably the worse, the wait wasn't too bad 45 minutes, but when we got inside that wait took long. Drinks took long, our appetizer came a minute before our food came, well part of our food. I was done eating and so was my daughter before my sons food finally arrived! They did give him a free cheesecake and salad( although the salad was blah). So for that I give them three stars!  The food at this location is a hit and miss, this was my first time coming when it was more crowded, so maybe that's why the food didn't taste as good as it usually does. I recommend though if you love the Factory, go to the Waikiki one. Although the wait is long there, I have never been disappointed with the food or service"
Brent L.,"Honolulu, HI",148,2,,5.0,11/2/2017,Great experience our waitress Ms. Keys she likes to go as (the one that dances not sings) lol but she knew details about pretty much everything they have on there HUGE menu. Great tasting food and will be going back to her for my dining at Kapolei Cheesecake Factory.
Wallace K.,"Waipahu, HI",2,8,2,5.0,10/25/2017,Awesome meatloaf. So many good choices. There's even a menu for dieters. The celebration cheesecake was huge but so good. Service was excellent. Highly recommend this place.
Robert Z.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,46,21,4.0,10/21/2017,"We visited the Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei for the first time in Oahu. We have eaten at several in California, but this was our first in Oahu. My wife had the Chicken Piccata which she said was very good. I had a simple Factory  Cheeseburger cooked medium. When I cut my burger in half it started bleeding all over my plate, definitely rare. I sent it back. Tbe manager came over and told me my order would have to be cooked all over and would be delayed. My wife was done with her plate by the time my burger arrived. You would think the manager would comp my meal or offer a slice of cheesecake for the inconvenience.  Nope. Never saw her again. I understand the restaurant is fairly new, but our server would get lost at times when we requested extra salad dressing or bread. I also had to wait for my fries (along with another table) when my first burger arrived. Kudos to the bartender, my Long Island Ice Tea was good and their Mai Tai was even better."
Nicholas S.,"Waianae, HI",305,11,6,5.0,10/21/2017,"The quality, atmosphere and service expected from any Cheesecake Factory. Good stuff! And it's very nice to have one closer to the west side."
Dannielle W.,"Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI",0,16,,3.0,9/22/2017,"So I thought since this restaurant is far away from Waikiki which is a major touristy area that it wont be as busy and service would be better... boy was I wrong. I called in my order for curb side pick up and was on hold on the phone for 20 minutes... I hung up and called back, placed my order and when I arrived to pick up my order all of the order parking spots were taken and nobody was picking up the curbside pick up phone line... so after waiting while calling for 10 minutes I decided to go inside to pick up my order... I was in line for about 15 minutes... fortunately as soon as I got to the register my order was already there so I didn't have to wait longer.  The only great thing about this new location is free parking!! Other than that this place is just as hectic as the Waikiki spot. Alot of people was waiting outside to be seated im not sure how long the wait was but it seemed like it was awhile.  Although my to go curbside experience was horrible this location is way better than the one in Waikiki. No traffic other than in the parking lot which wasn't difficult at all."
Mitchell O.,"Waipahu, HI",31,15,11,5.0,10/9/2017,"This was a great food/ service experience tonight. The tamale corn cakes was unbelievable. The chicken/ shrimp gumbo was super tasty. The honey bourbon martini was awesome. Our server was very knowledgeable, honest, and hospitable. Kelli gave her honest thoughts on the food that we ordered and was spot on with everything! If the service and food quality remains the same as tonight, I will be coming back over and over again. Also due the fact that their menu is enormous!"
Donny F.,"Ewa Beach, HI",118,7,,1.0,11/5/2017,"First they said 2-1/2 hours. 2-1/2 hours later, they said 40mins. 40 mins after that, they said 30 more mins. I had a big party (25 people), but you should be able to estimate wait time better than that. Terrible"
Jerilynn M.,"Waialua, HI",24,6,,1.0,11/4/2017,"Food was horrible. We ordered the mushroom burger and the lunch pasta with sausage and let me tell you this, the patty had NO TASTE at all. It tasted like plastic! There were no condiments in there. Also, the lunch pasta, tasted like those cheap helpers pasta that you could buy at Walmart.  I think this place should just sell cheesecake desserts and not on trays."
Ms LaLa D.,"Honolulu, HI",0,74,116,5.0,10/7/2017,"First time here and I will definitely be back!! I met my girlfriends for lunch at 11:00 on a Tuesday. Although they didn't open until 11:30 thank goodness my friends were there early at 11:00 not knowing they open later. As I was walking towards the restaurant I notice a very long line along the sidewalk leading to the door. Thinking it was a contest or something free I asked one of the Staff on the outside lanai what the line was for? About 50-60 were in line to be seated. I knew Waikiki was know to be busy and could have a 30-60 minute wait at times but I never thought early on a weekday would the place have a line. But that just goes to tell you how popular and delicious the selections are. I've loved Cheesecake Factory ever since my first experienced while in Southern California over 20 years ago. Like I said luckily my girlfriends arrived early and had been one of the first to be seated after being in the front of that line. We had a window booth for 4. My girlfriends had already ordered the egg roll sampler with a variety of rolls and sauces. Our server Lori who was wonderful noticed I had joined them and came by to greet me and take my beverage order. The girls were drinking tropical tea and she suggested the same for me since I asked for iced tea. It was delicious and refreshing. After indulging in our appetizers and looking over all the yummy selections we were ready to order. My friends ordered the Marsala chicken, spicy cashew chicken and since we all wanted to share and try each other's lunches our server Lori suggested the Bistro Pasta which was amazing!! Thank you Lori! She reminded us to save room for the outstanding cheesecakes. After all we were at ""Cheesecake"" Factory, lol! Lori brought us smaller shareable plates and we all enjoyed trying each other's lunch selections. We decided we were content and asked for doggy bags, which I don't know why we call it that since most dogs don't get to eat the leftovers, right?! Lori our server graciously boxed all of our food and packed it individually for us to take with us. While resting our tummies and looking at all the different Cheesecakes they have to offer one of the Hostess Tihani was making her rounds picking up menus and checking on customers. We had the pleasure of getting to know a little bit more about the establishment and what they have to offer other than lunch time. Just like our server Lori, Tihani was very very pleasant. So we still needed to decide about dessert. Although we were content we didn't want to leave w/o trying at least one flavor of cheesecake. So we asked for suggestions. Lori recommended Dolce which we did ordered. Another server came by and mentioned that was one of his favorites. After tasting it we knew why it was suggested. It was delicious!! We sat and shared the piece and caught up with each others lives. We didn't feel rushed or pressed to order or leave. Once we were ready to settle our bill, we asked if we could pay individually. Lori was happy to separate our checks. We really appreciated it. Lori gave us a wonderful experience and Tihani was so nice to take the time in checking on us and explaining the restaurant details. I can't wait for the next time I have the opportunity to go again."
Joslyn S.,"Waiʻanae, HI",22,3,,2.0,10/22/2017,"Too busy..... to expect customer service, food on time, wrong food order, must have patience. The shrimp scampi. It was dry, had no sauce!!! The mushroom was not cook. Maybe go on a slow day. Too busy to give quality service and food. Seems like the restaurant is just to over whelmed. Might try the weekday. Giving them another chance."
V H.,"Waipahu, HI",2,4,3,4.0,10/22/2017,"My family and I wanted to try the new location for Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei.  We decided to go on a Saturday at 4pm. Wrong day, wrong time! We expected to wait 1-1 1/2 hrs, but It was the malls anniversary and the average wait time to be seated for 6 or more people was 3 hrs.  At the 3 hr mark, when we asked if we will be seated (we were 8), the hostess replied that it will be another hour.  After hearing this, I asked for a manager. ANNIE was quick, professional and happy to get us seated right away within 5 mins!   Our server, TARONA was the bomb!!!!  She first apologized for the long wait then took our order patiently and answered all of our 20 questions about the menu. She was quick to get our water and bread out while we waited again for our food. She was awesome in coming back and forth to check if we needed anything, how our food tasted and if we needed refills on our drinks. Although I will never wait for 3 hrs to eat again, Manager Annie and Tarona made our first experience at Kapolei Cheesecake Factory a good one!!!  5 Stars on both of your customer service!!!!"
