Bubba S.,"Honolulu, HI",1,99,82,5.0,10/14/2017,Hey now!!  We went during the first week of opening and man was they busy!  The food and service was great and the prices are reasonable. Keep in mind they have take out and curb side service as well. Down side is no reservation. A must check out!!
Jordan B.,"Honolulu, HI",139,40,22,1.0,9/30/2017,After waiting 50 minutes I got buzzed to be seated. Walked in and was told to wait on the side. Seven groups went in and when I ask why we haven't been seated yet walked in after me and were seated. I asked the girl at the front why were we still waiting while other groups after me was being seated? the girl tells me that they're buzzing me now. I told the girl that they already buzzed me and I gave it to her and her response was oh  Waited on the side again just to watch 5 more groups get seated. This place is obviously new cause they are not organized. I'll make the drive from kapolei to Waikiki till this place gets their act together.
Victoria H.,"Waipahu, HI",59,17,1,5.0,10/30/2017,Exactly what I expected 2 and a half hour wait....Meal was great food came in timely manner..great waiter. Knew the menu very well..great recommendations!!!
Kaylin Y.,"Kapolei, HI",0,18,,1.0,10/30/2017,"Service: Terrible. Of course they just opened and of course they're super busy, but come on. My drink order was wrong and by the time the server returned with my new one, we had finished our meals.  Food: I ordered a pasta dish that was swimming in orange grease.  Ambiance: Crowded and loud. Not romantic, not very fun, not relaxing.  Value: Tried it, hated it. Won't return."
Yvonne B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",9,3,,4.0,10/10/2017,"Couldn't wait till this place opened on the West side! Went for dinner after a month being opened, waited at 1hr. Half.. Not bad cause we had a party of 7..it was packed though! But waitress was nice, friendly ,local style and everything was great!  The service, food, deserts, pupus was Awesome!! Just a great friendly Atmosphere!"
Eilene E.,"Kapolei, HI",72,12,43,3.0,12/13/2017,"This is my first time here. This place has been open for a few months now and I would expect it to be more. Food is good along with portions. Although they should have worked out the kinks in service and getting food out in a timely matter. First off, when coming in I was greeted right away, then was given a wait time of 30 minutes (not a problem) it was then that my buzzer went off and when we got in we waited another 15 minutes inside to get seated. You would think when the buzzer goes off thy would be ready to seat you. Our waitress was able to get our order in no time that was great. Kids food came out first thank goodness! Then the sitting around for 40 minutes just for our meal, mind you no apps were ordered. Wish my experience was better my kids were restless waiting for us to receive our food and eat. Maybe I'll try this place out in another time, in maybe a year. Hopefully then it'll be better."
Jasmin E.,"Waipahu, HI",0,8,,4.0,10/27/2017,They offer a different menu for people on a diet unlike the one in Waikiki. I also love how it's only a ten minute drive from home with not so much traffic!
Ku'ulei R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",107,71,10,4.0,9/20/2017,"I usually wait a couple weeks before I go to a new restaurant just so that they can work out any kinks they might have.  But I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory on opening day at the Ka Makana Ali'i mall.  I am glad I came because the food was great and the service was awesome.  I've been to other restaurants on the west side of the island weeks after they opened and service still lacked and wait time for food was ridiculous.  Here at Cheesecake Factory they know what their doing.  The Staff was obviously well trained and knew what they were doing.  The kitchen staff was on it, our food came out at a reasonable time.  I am so glad I decided to check them out on opening day.  Definitely will be back later this week."
Adeline H.,"Snohomish, WA",0,5,,1.0,10/26/2017,"Was seated roughly 10 minutes before patron sitting next to us and was never greeted. Can't vouch for the food since we left after the customers next to us were greeted and then their drink orders taken a few minutes after seating- the waitress stared at us while she set their drink napkins down. I'd say this place maybe is only local friendly- no ""vacationers"". Stay away unless you want to get subpar service and strange looks from employees/management."
Nico D.,"Kapolei, HI",61,2,2,5.0,9/26/2017,Went on grand opening day and the customer service was on point. Food was on point and the Oreo cheesecake was bomb. Haha.
jean a.,"West Covina, CA",4,22,6,3.0,9/20/2017,"Party of  3 is about an hour. Not bad for first day.. but the food took longer than expected and it came out one at a time.. so we all waited till everyone got their food. And looked like the waiters have no idea how to find the table where to deliver the food, they all looked clueless.. need more time to be train since Cheesecake Factory told the public they hired best of the best people in the island.. (lol) the food as ok I ordered blue hawaii for my drink, there's actually an aftertaste of an old pineapple;( then my jambalaya pasta ok not the best though pasta was over cooked and there was too much bell peppers.. didn't try any desserts though coz I was disappointed w my food, I had like 3 bites that was it.. my advice if the wait time is about more than an hour don't waste your time.."
Willie-Ann P.,"Waiʻanae, HI",1,6,,3.0,10/24/2017,This has been my favorite place since I can remember. Kind of on the pricy side but SO WORTH IT! I really love their banana & celebration cheese cake. ONE THING they should work on tho is that they should accept reservations. The line can get extremely long & waiting in the hot sun is not the business.
Pauline K.,"Waipahu, HI",7,5,,5.0,10/1/2017,"First off, the wait was shorter than I expected..about 20 minutes. While we were waiting we checked out the menu. That helped as once we were seated we put in our order for food and drinks. We received some (yummy) bread and our drinks..before you know it my Skinnylicious Chicken Potpie arrived, that was scrumptious. Of course we couldn't leave without a Pecan and Pumpkin Cheesecake to go, ohh that was very Ono!!!"
Kathleen W.,"Simi Valley, CA",222,5,1,5.0,9/29/2017,We are normally hesitant when it comes to trying new chain restaurants on the island because we usually walk out disappointed. But this experience was amazing. We were seated within minutes. The staff was extremely attentive. The food was served piping hot and was delicious. We will definitely be coming back as regulars!
Devin M.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,1.0,10/21/2017,"This location doesn't do reservations which I think is very unprofessional, especially with a location that gets pretty busy. I've tried to set up a couple birthday dinners here, and with them not doing any reservations we've had to wait for over two hours every time."
Ryan D.,"Waipahu, HI",399,6,,5.0,10/10/2017,No long wait on a Monday night! Great service and great tasting food. Cheesecake is the best!
DeRae V.,"Pearl City, HI",224,5,1,4.0,10/10/2017,"Normally I wait a lot longer when a new restaurant opens. I was pleased to say it was worth going to. Of course it's always busy here, but my hubby and I went early around 5pm and waited about 10 - 15 mins for the first available. The server was kind and genuine. There were a few things like pre busing and dropping off the dessert menu prior to our meals being complete. But other than that the experience was spot on. The food was very delicious. We got the sweet corn tamales, which was sweet and amazingly proportional. The bacon truffle cheese sticks were so savory and flavorful. My hubby got the bacon bacon burger, which was messy goodness. I got the truffle honey chicken, it was crunchy and juicy. Dessert was a sinful savory Adams peanut butter cheesecake, with a Nutella topping and a Reese's filling. Literally to die for!!!"
Vee R.,"Aiea, HI",0,2,,5.0,10/9/2017,"This is the best service we've had, our waitress was Misha. Great food and great service...were definitely coming back to this location."
Donavan P.,"Kapolei, HI",139,3,,4.0,10/20/2017,"Fantastic restaurant to go to. Ate here a few times now and just have one complaint, employees need to relax! Not all but a few of them seem overwhelmed with how busy it gets and tend to mess up on things. Steak had no taste, rice was too mushy. A lot of the food is well made for the most part. I think think they just need to.........  ""not rush"" i would say"
Javorris S.,"Honolulu, HI",42,2,,1.0,10/8/2017,They purposely kept everyone outside waiting because the chef could not keep up with the orders. I arrived when they opened at 10 and didn't get seated until 1045. Food didn't make it to my table until almost 1200. They need to get it together.
