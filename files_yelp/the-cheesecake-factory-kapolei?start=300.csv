Vanessa S.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,28,138,3.0,9/25/2017,"Came with some friends.. spend an hour waiting for a table, another 50 min waiting for hour food, 30 minutes for cheesecake; total with eat time was 4 hours 12 minutes.  Food is was okay, portions are big but that's no different than other Cheesecake Factory.  Saw lots of workers standing around waiting for the kitchen to pump out food and running around in circles but I still had slow service, I don't get it how workers can run around in circles but our table still was neglected. Our waiter was nice and apologetic about the long food wait but didn't warn us about the wait for cheesecake; I had to ask him after walking to the cheesecake takeorder side and was told the wait was 20 - 30 minutes.  The Celebration Cheesecake was awesome and well worth the 30 minute.  Wait for workers to get their stuff together before visiting this place, if not be prepared for slow service and a long wait"
Sunny K.,"Kapolei, HI",3,5,,1.0,10/5/2017,"My students wanted to go here for a field trip, and they were super excited because we are just down the street.We were told by the GM that they were ""too new"" and ""too busy--maybe next year."" I guess the restaurant is too successful to care about the community. We just wanted to stay for an hour as a party of 18 late afternoon with advance reservations--next month. No, to students? Seriously...not aloha at all. I love the cheesecakes but will not go there anymore.  If you care about ohana, aloha and the community, please go to CPK across the street. The GM said, ""Sure, when? We would love to talk to your students especially if they are dining here."""
Bles D.,"Kapolei, HI",1,12,1,3.0,10/15/2017,"We didn't go here to dine in. Just for the cheesecake and even that was a long wait. The cashier said it would be a 4-5 min wait and to stay by the counter side. I ended up waiting 20 min for three cheesecakes. I don't think they should guesstimate a wait time that short or let the orders sit on the counter and continue to help other customers with their orders. I know they just opened but I feel like if there are people already waiting to order, they can wait and push out the take out orders sitting on the counter so that helps alleviate the people already waiting for their paid orders.  On the positive side, at least their employees were nice."
florence M.,"Waimalu, HI",1,20,12,5.0,10/1/2017,We arrived and was quoted a 2hour wait but waited an hour..Justin was our server and was great..made sure our drinks were full we had warm fresh bread and our food got to us in a timely manner..it was my bday and even though I told my husband I did not want for them to sing happy bday to me..Justin still brought me a little cup with a candle..it was such a nice gesture that I thought was really sweet. All in all great service and food..worth the wait..
Jay B.,"Waipahu, HI",6,1,,2.0,9/30/2017,"Food was good, service super slow. Wait was  long. Everyone in my party finished their food by the time my son got his food, so you know I wasn't to happy about that.  Trying to keep a hungry 5 year old under control was a pain in my neck. Complimentary Bread came about 5 mins into our meal.  Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."
James H.,"Kapolei, HI",0,3,,5.0,10/14/2017,"Great food. I got the tomato basil pasta which includes chicken, but it was a small portion of chicken."
Nani K.,"Waianae, HI",55,8,2,5.0,9/30/2017,"We (party of three) had dinner on 9/28/17. We arrived at 5:20pm.The host  got us seated on the lanai upon my request, 20 mins. later. It was very nice with ceiling fans and shade pulled down due to the sun. Our waitress, Jaylene, informed us of the specials and took our cocktails order, Margaritas for two. She returned with our drinks and we ordered 3 appetizers, spicy ahi tempura roll, fried calamari, and eggroll sampler. It was very delicious. We ordered our entrees, spaghetti w/meatballs, angel hair pasta w/shrimp, and Ono w/macadamia crust over ginger lime sauce.They were cooked perfectly and very tasty. We had to try the dessert, which was lemon raspberry cream cheesecake, white chocolate raspberry truffle, and Reese's P-Nut butter chocolate cake cheesecake. Jaylene gathered our leftovers and put it in a doggie bag. She was awesome in every aspect. Jaylene and the other wait helps really tend to our needs before being asked... so on brand!! We'll be back for sure!! Oh almost forgot, we also had live music. Friendly workers, perfect setting, and great ambiance."
Edith T.,"Kapolei, HI",0,49,,2.0,11/5/2017,"They screwed up take out on the club sandwich.  No dressing came with the salad and the toast was burnt on the bottom.  The sandwich was all fallen apart even with the use of tooth pics.  Perhaps they should cut in fours vice two halves.  While dining long waits and crowds...the quality of the food and service was not worth the hassles. Only in Hawaii would you see hours long lines to eat.  My advice, wait until the novelty wears off before going...they appear to becoming complacent with their success."
Rebecca G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",372,1,,1.0,12/12/2017,"It was my first time at Kapolei Cheesecake Factory location and it was honestly not the best customer service I've had. I first noticed how the utensils were on the bare table which i thought was VERY unsanitary. Then our waitress Stephen was taking our drinks/appetizers order and seemed a little bit in a rush. I couldn't even finish what I had to say and he was already gone. I also asked for straws and that took a good 5-10min due to him forgetting. Everyone's food came, I ordered the Hibachi Steak and it came out cold as of it was sitting for a very good while, I still ate it because I was very hungry especially because of how long we already had to wait. Then the nice lady who brought everyone else's pasta and steak said their plates were hot so once I touched my plate I thought the same but it wasn't actually hot at all?? LOL We then wanted a cheesecake to go but he then said that the bakery was backed up which made us wait longer and also confused because he told us that it was pre-made and if it was already pre-made wouldn't it have been a real quick? Wasn't really a good experience with me. Everyone seems to like the Waikiki one better so I think I'll try that one."
Michael C.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",260,6,7,5.0,10/12/2017,The wait is worth it. No longer have to drive to Waikiki location . Close to home. The waiters are very helpful. Of course the food is in big portion . Comfort food ! Must try
Tahiti R.,"Waialae - Kahala, Honolulu, HI",198,1,31,1.0,10/12/2017,Stood in line in the hot sun with about 75 other customers then moved us into the shade watching the employees eat. They did pass out water to keep us from having a heat stroke in their defense. Could the employees have tasted the food prior to opening hours or is this normal to have a tasting while lots of people are waiting?
Brandon S.,"Honolulu, HI",129,10,,1.0,10/12/2017,The worst dinner experience ever. Food had no taste. Then waited another half hour for another one to be made after the pasta had no taste. They know the fish doesn't have taste since they added tartar sauce with the fish. This place is only good in the the mainland I'm guessing. Manager also takes his time coming over. But never came. We just ended up leaving. Wasted 2 hours. Don't waste your time eating here. I will share this with people on Facebook to let them know don't eat there. Worst yet if the cooks and staff look younger than me it should have been a sign don't eat here
Tommy H.,"Waipahu, HI",163,5,,5.0,11/4/2017,"Kai is the best server I've ever gotten in my entire life. He took care of our table as if we were family and made sure our experience was 10/10. I've never had a server who I'd actually recommend to others until Kai came along. Whenever I come here, I'm going to ask for Kai, I suggest you do the same. This is the Kapolei location btw."
P C.,"Henderson, NV",0,26,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Went here at 7:30 pm and tried to sit at 2 open seats at the BAR. Some guy was holding 2 chairs at the BAR for others that had not arrived, which is against CHEESECAKE FACTORY guidelines.  BARTENDER SIDED WITH HIS FRIEND HOLDING 2 CHAIRS."
Garrett F.,"Kapolei, HI",101,1,,5.0,10/9/2017,"Aloha, I ate at Cheesecake Factory yesterday and Desiree was my server. She was awesome! She had menu knowledge whenever we asked for recommendations! Come see Desiree at the Cheesecake Factory KAPOLEI!"
Monica K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,8,12,4.0,10/4/2017,"Waited a little after the grand opening before checking them out. I've eaten at the Waikiki location ONCE because I'm not into waiting an hour or more for a table. This new location was pretty good. Got lucky with a table for two upon entering in the bar seating. Huge menu so allow yourself a good ten minutes to look it over. Service is relatively quick as they are well-staffed, always a plus. Started with a refreshing cucumber mojito and a strong blood orange margarita. We got the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken and Cajun Jambalaya pasta with shrimp and chicken for our entrees. I got a lot of juicy bite-sized pieces of chicken, but maybe only 3 small pieces of shrimp lol but it was still pretty tasty with a decent amount of spice. Alfredo was creamy but could've used more cheese in the sauce to give it more body. But like I said, still very tasty. Finished our dinner with a slice of the white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake. Overall it was a great dinner experience and we'll most likely eat here again... because there's more of the menu I need to explore lol"
Emily B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,2,,5.0,10/4/2017,"I had a great dinner with my family. The atmosphere is wonderful and the food came relatively quickly. The only downside was the wait for the table, they don't take reservations so it was almost an hour and half wait but I think it was worth it."
Kerri K.,"Waianae, HI",0,5,,5.0,10/4/2017,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory tonight, we were seated as soon as walking in the door. Our server Roger John was awesome, he was very friendly & attentive! 5 stars. The restaurant itself was very busy, but even with that being said our food still came out with-in a reasonable time. The food was awesome, the Chicken Madeira has always been one of my favorite dishes there. The only down side was that the kids food was the last to come out, and for a hungry child, that may be a problem. Overall, we left The Cheesecake Factory feeling happy full"
Tracie S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,4,,1.0,11/24/2017,"Came in for a quick lunch, it wasn't busy because it was 1130. Waited over 30 minutes for our food and when it came it was incredibly over salted to the point it burned our throats. Management apologized and took the food off the bill but we had to wait an additional 20 minutes for the check. No attempt was made to right this mistake other than taking the uneaten food off our bill. Highly disappointed with kitchen, waitstaff, and management. Will not be returning!!!"
Nicole W.,"Waipahu, HI",0,7,4,1.0,10/1/2017,Horrible customer service! Arrived at 12pm. Wasn't seated until 3:00.. Seated for about an hour before our order was taken. Waited another hour before some of the food arrived.. Two different waitresses came to our table with food that wasn't ordered. Finally everyone food had came and it was after 4:30 Food not only wasn't good but cold as well! The worst customer service!!!!! Thankfully one of the General  manager came out and accommodated us. We won't be eating here again!
