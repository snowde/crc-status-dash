Roxy G.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,1,1,5.0,10/10/2017,"I actually live in Orlando, FL, but I wanted to give this review because I experienced fantastic customer service from this restaurant. Here me out. My boyfriend and his family went to eat at Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei since it's new in town they were celebrating his birthday. I unfortunately live 4,000 miles away but I wanted to see if I could surprise him with a cheesecake paid by me with a note on the plate. After contacting them, Raina Jones, who works as a host, TOTALLY went above and BEYOND to make this surprise work!! She did all she could to deliver the message to the servers and made sure that cheesecake was sent to my boyfriend's table. Jaylyn Garces, the other host working that night, also helped with the process, so I applaud and thank these two for doing their job flawlessly. It's hard being a host so I'm extremely happy that they did what they could, despite the busy crowds, to make this surprise happen. If you decide to stop by CF in Kapolei and run into these ladies, tell them how great they are for me!! And managers, if you are reading this, give these ladies a raise!! Side note: I ordered the S'mores Cheesecake for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it! I think it's safe to say that you should try it too."
Taylor D.,"Waianae, HI",0,34,7,2.0,9/29/2017,"I've eaten here twice so far and honestly, the servers suck. Within the two hours BOTH times, we only got our waters filled twice. The wait between ordering and the food coming are bad. Expect to wait at least 40 minutes to an hour after ordering for your food. The bread to snack on came out cold and hard. Couldn't even melt the butter in it. My friend ordered a mushroom burger medium rare but it was too rare. As Gordon Ramsay would say ""I could still hear the cow mooing"". I ordered my burger medium rare and it came well done. Very dry. My friend that ordered chicken in a biscuit described it as looking like a TV dinner. The trial run may have been an ok experience but this second time was just awful."
Autumn M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",174,6,,5.0,9/26/2017,"Of course when it opens it's super busy, but the fact that not only one but two managers walks around & talks to tha guest I feel that's great service.  Our waiter of course was tha best! If you guys come & Deivan is working, ask for him! He has such a great warm personality & will be honest with what meals are Ono! Especially help you with your cravings  Tha Kalua pig nachos are tha best appetizer, it's worth tha $13! It's a HUUUUUUGE PLATE!!!  Tha steak was amazing as well, juicy & delicious  I would recommend & come back again!"
Kaycee B.,"Waianae, HI",0,5,98,4.0,9/25/2017,"Came here last night for my friends birthday dinner. Waitress was very attentive and gave us great recommendations on the food and cheesecakes. I loved how she repeated our order for assurance that she heard correctly (it was a little loud, very busy night). The food was amazing and I loved how all the workers help out instead of just one server. Dessert however they just ran out of the mango key lime cheesecake but that's okay because they have a wide selection of pastries! The dulce de Leche and the Coffee cheesecake were delicious! Me and my boyfriend enjoyed them very much. Will definitely be back again and can't wait to try new things!"
Francis E.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,10,,3.0,11/19/2017,We went this Sunday evening.  Wait was almost an hour.  Our waitress Sinoy was very nice.  However another waitress gave me the wrong steak order.  I didn't it was the wrong steak until I complained to Sinoy that my steak was dry and medium when I ordered medium rare New York steak.  When she returned the steak she found it was wrong order.  The steak I got was for the table next to us.  Sinoy finally brought me my correct order and it was correct and tasted good. Although I've had better steak at Cattle Company.  We also had the shrimp pasta which was a lot and got compliments.  The wait was long.  Our dinner time was not as long as our wait.
Ryan T.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,10,2,4.0,9/24/2017,"Don't even bother with the frickin wait. Just hit the next available bar seats or round top table seating and beat the line. We thought going in @ 3pm was a great strategy but 'hell no' were we wrong. It was bumpin mad, with no sign of letting down. Yet our service was good despite being very busy. My lady ordered the this 'Bang Bang Shrimp and Chicken' and it was to die for. Food came out at a decent time, but was worth the small wait because the taste was wonderful! Plates are little more on pricey side but still reasonable. We ordered a Dulce de Leche cheesecake, but it took them about 20 mins to let us know they didn't have the flavor . So we got Godiva instead. But they also came out with a Dulce de Leche, which they claimed was the very last one and because of all that, it was complimentary!!! Woohoo, can't be hangry bout that. Of course, the cakes were to die for. So overall, the experience was great even if the feelz was all about crowds and waiting. If you can wait, give it several weeks for the lines to taper off. Enjoy"
Denise S.,"Pearl City, HI",0,38,17,1.0,11/18/2017,Wanted to hold an outside Christmas party called to see if they could accommodate  was told they don't take reservations would have to have someone go down couple hours prior to see how long the wait time would be! Mind you this is a party of 20-25 people! Oh well looks like we just have to find some where else to go!
Rick H.,"Kapolei, HI",0,19,1,5.0,9/19/2017,"Opening day at the new Kapolei Cheesecake Factory was super impressive. Fully staffed, sparkling new, very beautiful. Exactly what you would expect from them- and they did not disappoint. The Thai Lettuce Wraps were awesome. Steak Diane was delicious. The Oreo cheesecake was fantastic! The service was great- even on day one. Well trained with plenty of supervision and trainers everywhere. As a Kapolei resident I'm very happy to have them in the neighborhood."
Tiffany A.,"Pearl City, HI",1,1,3,1.0,11/5/2017,"I been goin Cheescake factory in Waikiki had NO problems!..treated my other half to his FIRST time eating here(KAPOLEI) and by far the worst. we got seated, waited almost 10 min for a ""drink"" than waited about another 50 min for our food when we ordered everything one time! My pasta came cold. My bf his food was GREAT he said. he waited 10 min for a 3rd beer by then he said let's just go. I had my 3 year old with me saying mom I'm so hungry..i feel bad he had his 1st experience here and ruined his birthday celebration. they sang to everyone else but NOT TO MY BOYFRIEND..i had requested for a birthday surprise. I spoke to the manager he did not offer anything on how to make my experience better. He said his cooks prepared everything in a ""timely manner"" . I guess his look on ""timely manner"" is an hour and 10 min wait! and I have proof! and he still did nothing!"
Nackyana K.,"Mililani, HI",0,2,,5.0,11/5/2017,Finally opened a Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei! We were seated in less than 15 mins on what would typically be a busy Saturday Night (even though they told us the wait would have been about an hour) . After my husband was dissatisfied with the food the he order (due to his own fault) the kind waitress offered to get him something else right away. What really impressed me was when the managed came out and spoke To my husband personally to ask him why he was not satisfied (so that they can possibly improve I assume) & then offered a complementary salad while we waited for the other order to come out. I loved it !
Alyas A.,"Waipahu, HI",0,10,1,2.0,11/12/2017,Such a waste of time and money. I can go to Zippy's for a better food and less wait time. Nothing special.
Doug H.,"Kapolei, HI",0,9,8,1.0,11/4/2017,"Even at their best location the food, drinks, and service are nothing memorable...and this is definitely not their best location. Save your money and eat somewhere else, and if you must have the cheesecake, pick some up ""to go"" for dessert."
Madelyn T.,"Honolulu, HI",3,16,2,4.0,11/4/2017,"I don't really mind the food here only because most of the food on their menu are pretty good, but I think they could do some improvements on service. We waited for almost 2 hours, which I didn't mind since this is ONLY the second location on the island and no one really wants to drive to Waikiki and find parking. The food we ordered was perfect, the New York steak and Prime Rib my fiancé and I ordered was cooked exactly the way we wanted it to be and we didn't really wait too long for the food. I know they get busy on weekends, especially Friday nights but our server was just all over the place and took too long to close out our table. We waited for a good 30 minutes for water refills because every time we asked she or another server would say okay, but forget. I'll leave it at 4-stars since our food was really good.... minus the one star not because of the wait to get seated, but the wait just to leave."
Allington B.,"Kapolei, HI",0,5,,3.0,10/7/2017,"We were excited to check out the newest Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei at Kamakana Alii, so we made sure to leave early enough to beat foot traffic. We were greeted with a smile, and were told it would be a half hour wait. We got our buzzer and in around 20 minutes we were buzzed and immediately seated. Our waitress was nice and friendly and was very patient. Now comes the negatives. We were a party of four and our water and drinks alone took over 10 minutes to get to us, including bread. The appetizers we ordered were the avocado egg rolls and as always it was superb, but also 15-20 minutes to arrive. Within the time, getting another round of drinks was 15 minutes on its own. One whole hour after all this the food had finally arrived, and it was wrong and still had to wait for certain things to complete it. I understand this is a new establishment, with new staff and it must take awhile, but dang we easily could've and should've just went to the one in Waikiki. Can never go wrong"
Tammy H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,2.0,11/18/2017,"We ordered the Spagetti w/meatball which was way too salty, unable to eat.  Asked where our stuffed mushrooms we ordered were. The person went to check and was suppose to be back with parmesan cheese.  She never returned with the cheese. The manager show up and was apologetic that they ran out of the mushrooms.  No problem we understood that can happen, but at least take it off the bill!   Driving home we thought the bill was high.  Cheesecake Factory still charged us for the mushrooms!  Make sure you check your bill before you leave!"
Karly A.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,3.0,11/7/2017,"Me and my boyfriend went to this Cheesecake Factory and my first time there was very unsatisfactory. The quality of the food was poorly made. Me and my boyfriend got pasta dishes and both dishes were served cold. Even though the wait was short, the food was not up to standards. I would rather have a longer wait with good quality food then a shorter wait, with the food looked being rushed out of the kitchen. When we told the waitresses there, they didn't do much to compensate with us. Although they did bring out our dishes again, but by then we were already full from the precious dishes that we tried eating. The waitresses were very nice though but can always be improved! The only good part was the cheesecake honesty but that's not hard to mess up since you just put it on the plate and serve it. I think that this place definitely wasn't worth all the hype that people were giving credit for. Honestly, I will resort to going to the Waikiki location for better quality food as well as service. There is always room for improvement though being a new location I wouldn't rate this so harsh. Maybe they can work on everything a little better and it will definitely be worth the hype one day! :)"
Spearfactor S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",1,10,33,1.0,9/22/2017,"I get that this location has only been open officially for 5 days and yes there was like 80 people waiting 2hrs to be seated on a Thursday evening because the restaurant is packed, but your customers choose to call-in pickup order for the convenience of not having to wait.  Is there a way to give negative stars? So last night (Thursday) I'm at the Kai Makana Alii mall at 7pm for a meeting with friends.  I get a call from the wife at home asking if I can pickup cheesecake for dessert to bring home.  I expected a long wait for even a phone order so I wasn't surprised when I was told my order (3 slices of cheesecake) would take 20 minutes to be ready.  I give it 40 minutes cause they are busy and show up at the pickup counter.  How long can it take to pack up 3 slices of cheesecake right?  Not like they have to bake it from scratch, right?  The pickup counter is at the front of the restaurant behind the cheesecake display counter.  Orders are received in the back of restaurant and the order is supposed to be relayed to the front of the restaurant where they pack any cheesecakes in the order.  Behind the cheesecake counter are 10 busy workers (I counted them).  I wave one down to get her attention and tell her I am here to pickup my phone order.  She asks my name which I give her and 20 minutes later she goes through the stack of receipts in front of her.  About this time she  starts to get this ""somethings' wrong"" look on her face so she asks me my phone number and my order which she walkie-talkies to the back room where orders are taken.  She tells me to please hold on while they check in the back.  15 minutes later she gets a call from the back and they can't find my order.  By now I've been waiting 1hr 15 min (40 min waiting outside + 35 min inside) for 3 slices of cheesecake.  So I ask the worker who is helping me if she can just pack my order from the slices that are in the showcase in front of her, which she just laughs at my comment (WTH is that about?).  Apparently the cakes are ONLY for in-store customers and I ask if she can go get my 3 slices of cheesecake from the back.  Her reply was ""I cannot leave my post"", glad she is a good soldier and defending the cheesecake with her life but common.  15 min later she asks if I want to place my order again to which I ask how long will that take?  30 minutes was the reply.  So I've been waiting now 1.5hrs and you want me to wait another 30 minutes to get my order that should have been ready 1hr 40min ago?   I would have been willing to let this slide without a review if not for 2 things:  1) I was not once offered an apology, not by the worker or by the manager.  Instead I was asked to step aside and ignored as other customers who walked in the door off the street were helped to a cheesecake order.  I discovered this by asking one of the customers how long ago they called in their order to which the reply was we didn't call in.  They literally just walked up to the counter and was walking out the door with cheesecake without any wait whatsoever. 2) I asked if my order could just be pulled from the showcase but because I made it over the phone I am somehow prohibited from ordering from the front. So because I ordered over the phone I have to wait 2 hours for 3 slices of cheesecake but if I walked in and placed my order I wouldn't have to wait?  UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!  Your customer's time is just as valuable as your workers.  Yes, its a new restaurant in a part of the island that is not used to getting new restaurants so of course its gonna be busy and I get that.  I just pointed out a huge problem with your process.  You are WELCOME! I think I will just buy my cheesecake from Costco from now on.  Cheaper and no wait."
Hyacinth S.,"Orlando, FL",31,7,,1.0,11/15/2017,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Server was great. Food was subpar. Ordered key lime to go to take home. Only live 5-7 min away. Got home and it was like mush. Called the restaurant and asked for a manager. Got put on hold for 15 min. Hung up and called again. A lady answered the phone with an attitude and I asked if I could talk to a manager. Her response was ""for what?"". I got more upset when she asked me that question. Told her to complain about the key lime that I ordered to go. She placed me on hold and came back on and told me she was the manager. Told her if she's a manager then she should know better than to answer the phone with an attitude. I told her I didn't want to speak to her and asked for another manager. A guy named Al came on the phone introducing himself as a manager and told him that the other manager needs customer service re-retraining and also complained about the mushy key lime. First impression is important. This was our first time visiting this location and definitely will be the last!"
Hymie A.,"Mililani, HI",6,6,,1.0,11/15/2017,Ridiculously long wait. Went there three different times and same thing.
Raydeen B.,"Waipahu, HI",0,2,,4.0,11/13/2017,Aaron had such great customer service! Helped me waaaay more than my server! Wish he was my server instead. He's such a people person and his attitude was everything!!!
