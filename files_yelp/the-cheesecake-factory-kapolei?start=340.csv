Linda B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,1,,1.0,10/26/2017,"If I can rate this as a zero star, I would. , i haven't been seated yet but very disappointed on the hosts. We checked in at 4:00 party of 16 and were told a 2 hour wait. It is now 6:07 and they said it's another 1 hour wait. I sat outside since 4:00  , half our party was here since 4  and I saw about 15 people waiting before us. Come on Cheesecake Factory, I have a 90 year old mother with me and you're going to leave her out in the cold?  I've waited at Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki and never waited longer than the estimated time. And Waikiki has more patrons than here (Kapolei) on a weekday night.  We finally were seated around 7 but sadly too late because my sister and my 90 year old Mom  ended up going home. This was supposed to be a birthday celebration."
Brian D.,"Kapolei, HI",0,3,1,3.0,11/1/2017,"Exciting to have Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei. Brings a new dining experience to the city as well as new job opportunities. Had my first chance to eat there the other night after a long day of work and homework.  The ambiance was good, they had live music playing although the first thing you notice is that its loud. It over powered the dinner date conversation. Almost as if theres a concert in the resturant.  The service lacked a ""customer first"" experience for one reason only. I ordered a drink and asked that rum be replaced by vodka. I was told it was impossible to do because the bartenders cannot break thier recipes. I've been to countless Cheesecake Factory competitors and never been denied a similar request at any of them.Ever! The impression I got from that encounter was Cheesecake factory will dictate thier service to their customers and refuse flexibility at all costs. Also the impression I got was the bartenders are rookies, the drinks were pre made stored under the counter, poured over ice served with a garnish and I would be charged $$$.  Its a simple fix that involves a customer first mentality, flexibility and a knowledgeable bartender.  Other than that I like the progress from the new establishment."
Jay O.,"Tacoma, WA",0,27,10,1.0,10/23/2017,"I'll start by saying that I love The Cheesecake Factory. I frequent the one in Waikiki, which is busy, but they are organized so service is good. The Kapolei location is terrible when it comes to organization. I came here with my husband and toddler on October 22, 2017 and arrived at 4:52 pm. We requested indoor seating, which the hostess told us it would be a 55-70 minute wait. We went and walked around the mall until then. When we returned an hour later, we checked with the hostess to see how much longer our wait would be which she said the we would wait the full 70 minutes  unless we wanted whatever option available (indoor or outside). We said outside would be fine also. 70 minutes passes and still nothing. We ask what the hold up and we are only told that it's busy. At 6:30pm we are told there is 1 other party ahead of us and they were waiting for others to do finish their desserts. We were waiting by the hostess table and they sat 5 other parties and we were still waiting. To add insult the hostess suggested that we sit at one of the open high tables near the bar with our 2 year old. No a high chair wouldn't even reach the table, so why ask. After many complaints, we are finally seated at 7:02pm. My son is already tired from the wait and barely ate.  They bring us to the table which was not even cleared yet so we stood by waiting for the bus boy to clean it. He forgot to give us napkins. The server came by about 10 minutes later to start with our drinks. We placed our full order then and I asked for napkins. The server comes back with 2 napkins for our party of 3. Obviously my done doesn't count, because toddlers who orders spaghetti isn't messy. Our food comes out pretty fast and it was good (My 1 star). I had a lot left over so I asked for to go boxes. He brings out two small to go boxes. I ask for another one since my food obviously would fit in their cheesecake Togo box. The server comes back with another small Togo box and I ask if they had bigger ones. He said yes, but they were thinner, I asked for it anyway. My food fit perfectly in the big one but he wanted me to squeeze just my entree in 3 little ones.     The only staff that did their jobs correctly were the cooks, the rest needs work. The hostess shouldn't be there. She doesn't know what she's doing. I've never experienced a wait like that in Waikiki which is always crowded. The hostess obviously deleted or restarted our wait time and were were not compensated at all for her gross error. Not a good fit."
Derek P.,"Kapolei, HI",0,2,,2.0,11/9/2017,"Long waits. Food and service quality not worth it. If you must join the sheep and try it, I suggest ordering online and just picking it up."
Tyeisha B.,"Orlando, FL",51,11,4,1.0,9/29/2017,"I think the establishment has been open for a week now. Well we went to celebrate my mothers birthday today. The wait was over a hour for a party of 5. Which is understandable. THere is always a wait at Cheesecake Factory. We get there and had to wait another hour for our food. The kids food arrive 5 min before ours. Their food was great. Our food comes out last and it was terrible. The adult food was over cooked, dry, and mediocre. We expressed our dissatisfaction with the manager JT(or something similar). He took the food charge off. We also ordered Cheesecake to go. When I got home the wrong Cheesecake was in the bag. I called and had to make another trip there to get the correct one. I tipped the waitress out of the kindness of my heart but honestly I felt that the service was so poor no tip was needed. It was also my mothers birthday. No one sung happy birthday nor was it acknowledged. I am completely happy to wait for acceptable service. I'll skip this location and eat at Waikiki. At least the wait will be worth it. Please get it together! service and good food is needed. I wish I had a picture of the over cooked burnt meatloaf, dry Mac and cheese, and dry pasta. Unacceptable. Ruined birthday!"
Donna S.,"Kapolei, HI",18,72,123,5.0,10/10/2017,"Loved it! Worth the wait!! Staff is amazing, clean, service is 5 star, and food portions are enormous!!!! Thank you Cheesecake Factory for opening! We had the chicken Madeira, fettuccine, and smoke house burger! Everything was aaaaamaaaazing! Lemon drop drink was top notch!"
Cynthia C.,"Mililani, HI",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,We checked in at 5pm with a party of 9 and they are telling me I will have a 4 hour wait. Other people checking in with smaller groups are being told 30 minute wait time.  So how does 9 people get a 4 hour wait? I can't believe the poor management skill and experience to equally serve their customers.  I will never eat or recommend this restaurant.
Shayden M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,3,,4.0,10/20/2017,Good service overall but honestly what is in their fettuccine alfredo because it tastes like armpit gotta fix that.
Jasmine W.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,5,3.0,10/8/2017,"The wait was less than 30min to get seated which was awesome!  We got 2 appetizers, the Parmesan garlic cheese bread was delicious but the fried calamari was ok the meat on it was minimal I've had better calamari at other restaurants. I was really disappointed with how I could barely taste the calamari mostly the breading they used was on the plate. Waiting for our food was a long wait though which we didn't mind they were busy.  My other half got a shrimp pasta and he loved it and I got the steak Diane yummy although we were stuffed already from waiting so long and eating all of our appetizers and the bread they served lol we had to take it to go. I wanted to try the Godiva cheesecake but the wait for it was going to be 20min. I suggest putting it in during your meal order if you know what dessert you want. I waited till the end, and didn't want to wait anymore we were there for to long waiting on our dinner.  The reason why I gave it a 3 star was because of the spoon on our table, it was filthy. It wasn't hard to see at all it had black and green residue on it. Clearly it wasn't cleaned good at all, I had to check our forks to make sure those were clean. Sure I wasn't going to use the spoon but that was just disgusting, it happens I guess and they were super busy. Not sure what they use to wash their dishes and utensils but it should be checked before placing on their tables."
A L.,"Kapolei, HI",50,2,,1.0,9/29/2017,"While long wait it is understood.  The quality of the food and service was less than desirable.  We order 1 order of mac cheese balls and crab/spinach dip, after 10min of our appetizer order being placed, we have a gentleman come to our table to tell us they ran out of crab/spinach dip, we order another order of mac cheese balls.  Thinking we will get them together, no, our appeatizers were brought out apprx 20min apart each.  My husband orders the meatloaf.  Again 15-20 min later waitress comes back to tell us they ran out of meatloaf, he orders the cheese steak sandwich with a salad. 30 min later, dinner plates are brought out/served individually each apprx 15min apart and not together, with my 6yr old  getting his dinner at last! My husbands dinner was less than desirable served with fries vs salad, to which waitress takes fries back and another 10min later comes back with salad.  The bread on sandwich was as hard as a rock, barely could bite, he opted to just eat the meat!  We were a party of 5! after 2+ hrs of sitting there just waiting for our food (not counting the 70min wait, understood) we opted to just to go boxes and eat at home next day! We were there to celebrate a birthday, however not much of celebration after not being able to eat together as a party of 5! Also survey link on receipt does not work."
Likeke L.,"Waianae, HI",48,6,23,2.0,9/24/2017,"We absolutely love the CCF in town, but being on the west side, we hardly get a chance to eat there. We were ecstatic when we heard one was opening in kapolei. First time here tonight. Told the wait was going to 25 minutes, but we were seated in 5. We had high hopes. We got there after 10pm. We asked the server for water with lemon and some straws. She came back with water and bread, but no straws or lemons. We put our order in for both apps and entree and don't see her again for 30 minutes. Someone else brings our apps. By this time our water is all gone. Waitress comes back gives us more bread but doesn't fill up the water. Another waitress came by and gave us our entrées. Our regular waitress then shows up and asks us if we wanted Parmesan cheese on our pasta. She then left to get the cheese but didn't come back to fill up our water. We had to ask her for this. After we started dating I started noticing something strange about my dish. There were huge pieces of chard food in my dish...all I could taste was ashes. Spoke to the manager, he made them remake my dish and then he gave me a free slice of cheesecake. Asked the waitress for more water after we finished our dessert...she only filled up my husband's cup and left mine empty. We left close to 1am...almost 3 hours after we arrived, all because we had to wait for something that should've been given, (water) or at least done correctly the first time."
T L.,"Kapolei, HI",0,47,2,4.0,9/25/2017,"Ok, food great! Dessert! Great! Wait time, to be expected. If you come in with a party of more than 4 than expect to wait awhile. On Sunday 9.24.17 at 5pm, it was jammed pack. New hot spot of course everybody is going to be there. We were told a 4 hour wait for a party of 8. So I opted to split my party to 2 tables of 4. Didn't have to be together just get us in. I was told 75minutes. Well, it took 120 minutes. I checked every half hour to make sure we weren't skipped or forgotten. I didn't trip because I expected it to be crazy. We wait in Waikiki for 2 hours ez. So, we waited. We managed to get patio seating at 7pm and lucked out and got 2 tables side my side. Winning!!!! Yah, they need to work the kinks out  but overall.still a great meal and sit on the patio after 7. It's awesome! Kapolei nite life is beautiful. And not noisy like inside n crowded.  Cheesecake Factory still good food and service. Just make sure you keep checking the status of your seating. It's crazy busy but they really tried tonite to get us in. But worth the wait for a great meal and good service. Try the Chicken Bellagio. Awesome dish. A bit of everything on one plate. The banana cream pie cheese cake wasn't bad either. Kalua nachos a winner but tell them to make sure they put plenty of Kalua pork on there.  People not local made bad reviews they were discriminated against because they were overlooked when it came to seating. Well, with a new joint, new staff, and an influx of people. Bound to be mistakes made. But those who not from here want to play the race card. Let me say this, discrimination is everywhere. I'm Hawaiian. Born n raised here but travel ed half way around the world, lived in Japan, lived in Chicago for 10 years, Arizona for 4. I was a military wife for 8 years. A wife of a police officer for almost 20 years. Human error does exist. I've had it done to me while waiting at CPK in Kapolei. Told they called me. And they didn't. I was sitting right in front of the host. She either forgot or bypassed me. She was white and lied to my face with a surprised look on her face. Like she forgot. But I didn't play the race card cuz she forgot. I just thought what an airhead, young, n not focused. Then I kept it moving. People make mistakes n will lie to cover it up. It's not called discrimination it's called human nature. Lord knows, I've seen discrimination at its ugliest. Lucky to live Hawaii!"
Derek K.,"Kapolei, HI",0,10,,1.0,10/12/2017,Not worth the wait. The lines are horrible. The service is slow. Forced to stand in the sun. Go Waikiki
Andy N.,"Aiea, HI",0,11,3,4.0,10/11/2017,"Came here 10/7/17 with the Family around 530pm to try beat the dinner rush recommended by other yelpers. Quoted wait time was 50mins, which we didn't mind for a newly open spot. We walked around the corner to the arcade in J. Rockets for the kids to play while we wait. Before we could even purchase a game card our buzzer buzzed. 12 min wait time, no complaints. We sat on the right side. Seats and table were comfortably space and not to cramp.  Our server greeted us immediately and got our drink order promptly. My infant knock a fork on the floor and before we could ask for another one one of the staff members replace it. Good Team work. I order the Macaroni Burger Delicious. and Mrs order a salad, crab balls; made with real crab and we shared a Spinach Dip... Everthing was delicious. Now For why they got minus one star. the food took over 50 mins to arrive and they forgot my order of sweet potatoes fries I order with my burger. To mitigate server brought concern to manager and they didnt charge us for the fries and gave us a free cheesecake. Yay...if they can work on kitchen time and food running they have a 5 Star Spot."
Dee C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",47,3,1,1.0,10/9/2017,"So we decided to go eat lunch at Cheesecake Factory at Kapolei. We went around 230 hoping is not busy, still had to wait for 15 minutes. We got sat , greeted right away, put in our orders. Kids food took 20 min, apps about another 20 min also . Manager came asked if we ordered jambalaya after waiting for half an hour. Explained that our food given away to another table who cares we just want our food. So desert time, another 30 minutes wait. Server not that great didn't even drop any of our food and give him a descent amount of tip. I'm a good tipper I normally give 20% or more but not this time. All and all really bad experience never come back again."
Dymple 5.,"Honolulu, HI",0,15,,5.0,12/9/2017,"love, love this place! busy as hell and noisy!!! that's why we requested to be in the back way less noise and less people walking back and forth. we ate peaceful! appetizers, house bread, entree was excellent, staff awesomeness, management awesome,  bathroom awesome! great place."
Kuu H.,"Honolulu, HI",0,16,1,5.0,10/18/2017,"Customer service for curbside is A++, can't say enough how impressed I am from this first time experience with this location.  They were able to accomodate my requests as a pregnant woman with absurd cravings, and hubby's Hibachi steak was on point!  Great experience, will be back for more!"
Glenn R.,"Wahiawā, HI",0,7,4,5.0,9/23/2017,"Went to the cheesecake factory, party of 6 on opening day. Didn't have to wait. Experience was a 5-star. Same great taste as the town location. Usual fish tacos, pastas, and miso salmon. Nephew loved the lindas chocolate cake! And the Fried Korean style cauliflower is bomb!"
Sandra H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",26,26,,5.0,9/22/2017,"Great service! You can tell they really staffed for their grand opening. The food was good, menu is huge, there is something for everyone. I definitely will come back."
Tom I.,"Honolulu, HI",18,6,,5.0,9/21/2017,"Surprisingly good service for having just opened.  Reasonable prices, great menu. Staff was excellent.  So far, best full service restaurant at this mall. Would definitely return."
