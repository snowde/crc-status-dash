Maria G.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,4,,2.0,10/15/2017,"If you want to buy a whole cheese cake or half and half, call and order in advance! I went there to buy a cake for a birthday and was told that I would have to wait a couple of hours if I want to buy the half and half cake because it would have to be thawed. I then just decided to buy 12 slices of cheesecakes to make a one whole cake. Requested them to put it in one box to make it look like a whole cake but said they can't do that because it would take them 30mins to put the cakes in one box??! -_- wth? 30mins to put slices of cakes together? Really? Uhh!"
Theresa C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",36,16,28,4.0,10/1/2017,Would give it 5 but it was sort of dark inside needs a bit more lighting. But the food was 100% good bring a sweater if you get cold cuz it is COLD inside
Justin O.,"Kapolei, HI",2,6,,4.0,9/22/2017,"The gods answered my prayers when I said about a decade ago that we need a Cheesecake Factory on the westside! For a place that just opened up literally a couple days ago, this restaurant is probably the most smoothest running operation I've experienced during opening week. Probably because we figured out NOT to go during peak hours. Servers were very welcoming, attentive, and productive. Food came out really quick. Overall a great first experience at The Cheesecake Factory at Kapolei."
Julie A.,"Honolulu, HI",31,23,27,1.0,10/7/2017,"All I can say is that my visit at the new location sucked!!! The service was slow and the food wasn't the best. My family and I sat outside, literally took 15 mins to have water served to us. Food took about an hour to be served to us. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and gosh my bottom buns were soggy from the sauce and the burger itself didn't taste good. My boyfriend ordered chicken and biscuits. All he could say is the biscuits was the best part. Also, he supposed to have mashed potatoes but was told they ran out and it takes a while to make. But miraclaously half way through his meal, they brought out mashed  potatoes that we're undercooked. The manager spoke to us about all the mishaps, but I was already irritated and didn't want to waste my time talking about all the mistakes that happened throughout dinner. I just wanted to end my meal with cheesecake.  HOWEVER, our cheesecake took about 15 minutes to get to us, which totally killed my vibe and appetite. To end the dinner, I've waited 15 minutes to have the server give us the check for our bill. She apologized and said, ""sorry for all the mishaps"". Luckily, they took out the burger from the bill, but I felt I wasted money on food I didn't even get to enjoy. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, I know you just opened but here are some tips, work better on organizing a better system for sitting your customers, train your servers to be attentive, so they don't leave their customers wondering when their server is going to come back, and organized your food system to have it come out faster. Last but not least, why does it take so long to give out the cheesecake if it's already made????!"
Ikaika C.,"Waianae, HI",0,3,,5.0,9/30/2017,"It was definitely crowded, of course because it just opened up. Had to wait over an hour but it's all good because but my parents have hard timing walking so they just sat down outside and wait while me and my brother walked around the mall... When the vibrator, vibrated, we were seated and our server was Ashley... Ashley greeted us after we sat down which she is very welcoming and kind... We got our drinks little bit after five (5) minutes which I understand it's crowd (not complaining, lol) but overall I ordered a four cheese pasta... Also we ordered a few cheesecakes to take it home"
Ruya M.,"Honolulu, HI",24,13,,5.0,9/25/2017,"Excellent service & very good food! We went on Sunday around 3 pm and got seated within 20-30 minutes. I would definitely recommend this place, it's definitely worth the wait."
A K.,"Kapolei, HI",0,1,,1.0,9/24/2017,"This is one of our favorite restaurants and I was so happy to see it opening in Kapolei.  After 2 hrs 40 mins wait, we had to wait another hour before the food was served.  When our food arrived,  the pizza was burnt and potato soup tasted like dirt.  When we brought these to manager's attention, he laughed it off and said , "" I'm sure they washed the potatoes but we'll wash them better next time.""   Service was so-so.  No refills on beverages and water either.  Even though, Waikiki is out of our way,  we'll drive out there to eat...never in Kapolei again!"
May A.,"Kapolei, HI",0,5,,4.0,9/23/2017,"Rather than dining in on opening night we opted for take out. My husband ordered the carbonara, I ordered the Salmon Salad, and my son ordered the shrimp scampi. The salmon did not taste fresh, however the dressing tasted good. The carbonara tasted good but every carbonara we eat now we seem to compare to carbonara we've eaten in Italy, and there is just no comparison. My son enjoyed his shrimp scampi. Service was great, and we will definitely be eating there again once the opening rush has settled down."
Aliyah M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,2,,4.0,10/2/2017,"first time going to this location today and i have to say, i was pretty impressed. my mom and i went in the afternoon and only had to wait about 10 minutes (thank god it wasn't 2+ hours) the food came out delicious, refills were often, and our waitress was very kind. the only flaw was that the silverware was put directly on the table, it would be more sanitary on a napkin."
Tiana C.,"Pearl City, HI",0,5,,5.0,9/22/2017,"Opening day went great! They were very busy as expected but it only took 45 min for a table.  Our server, Harrison, was very attentive and catered to our needs. Although the wait for food was long, Harrison made sure to keep us up-to-date and often checked on the status of our food. The manager even came by to apologize for the long wait and offered any salad or soup while we wait. I would definitely come back and request Harrison."
Victoria A.,"Kapolei, HI",0,3,,2.0,9/22/2017,"We came to this location to celebrate a birthday. We checked in at 5pm. Got seated at 5:28pm, being seated wasn't the problem at all. The lady said 50 mins, but we got seated earlier inside. Ordering was the issue. We waited for our food for one hour, only  to have the manager say that they didn't start our food and that they were sorry. We understood that because it only been the first couple days since they opened. Plus the manager offer us free cheesecakes for our whole table. Food was great. The waiter soon took our food, bagged it up for dessert , because free cheesecakes. We then waited almost another hour for 4 cheesecakes. We only got 3 and brought out the forth one late. When they brought out the cheesecakes, the waitress said only two were free. Brought out another manager than the first one and soon fixed it. They corrected and gave us four cheesecakes for free for what happen.  The waitress soon came back with the bill, like we asked, she gave us someone else's bill. Second time, they charged us wrong. Third time was finally correct.  Only reason why I'm giving two stars is because my sister had a good time because it was her birthday. Second, the managers were very nice. Our waitress kinda sucked but being there for three hours wasn't worth it."
Rapunzel L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,8,,4.0,10/14/2017,"I am so excited that the cheesecake factory is finally in an accessible and convenient location with ample free parking and a spacious layout.  Finally got to eat here 3 days ago and the food did not disappoint! Yes, wait time for seating was about 45 min, but what do you expect for a brand new popular restaurant.  They also give you a buzzer which alerts you when your table is ready which has pretty far range, allowing you to browse the mall and even do a bit of shopping while you wait. From greeting, to seating, to service it was above and beyond on point.  I would give 5 stars, but I must admit that the food did take over an hour to come out, and we were missing fries.  We never asked or complained, but the server had the manager come over to apologize, and they really made up for it.  Btw, if you eat there and Don't try one of their many delightful flavor options of cheesecake you are crazy! To die for..."
Tania L.,"Kapolei, HI",34,35,,5.0,10/12/2017,"Just opening recently I was afraid to try to eat here because I have been to the one in town and the wait was super long!  Well I was pleasantly surprised that we arrived a little before 5 pm on a Wednesday and waited less than 30 minutes to be seated.  We did not mind sitting outside.  They had ceiling fans and it was starting to cool down anyway.  It was quieter outside too.  They had a 2 man band singing and they were great!  Very pleasant atmosphere.  Our server, who was great the entire time, came by and got our drink orders, and a few minutes later dropped them off and took our kids and appetizer order.  We got our complimentary bread and we ordered our main course.  Everything came in a timely manner and was still hot, but not too hot.  The menu had so many great options that I wanted to order everything!  I opted to get a cup of soup and the meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  The soup of the day was mushroom soup and it was fantastic!  The meatloaf and mashed potatoes were delicious!  Our appetizer, loaded tater tots, was just ok.  But they were nicely cooked with a golden crisp shell.  Now be warned that the portions are huge!  My cup of soup was a regular sized bowl, and the entree could feed two people (or three smaller people).  So because we had bread, I had soup, which I finished (again, it was delicious!), I asked for a to go box for 2/3 my meal, and asked for my dessert to go.  My husband liked the chicken parm sandwich with salad, and he took half the sandwich home too.  It is not cheap to dine here.  But the way I look at it, for 2 adults and 2 children, and considering we basically have lunch or dinner the next day (with my cheesecake I took home), it was not a bad price to pay for a wonderful dinner.  I want more of that soup!"
Tyra L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",0,9,,5.0,10/11/2017,"After the service we received from a very nice waitress, five stars for this place is HIGHLY EARNED! I really wish I got her name since she was such a sweet lady. We were seated In front the bakery so if you happen to be seated in that section and she's your waitress, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BY HER. There was four of us in our party and we came in around 9:15/9:30. I was shocked to hear the wait time was only 10 minutes since it is still which worked perfectly due to it being a school night. Got seated LESS THAN THAT WHICH WAS EVEN MORE PERFECT. THE INSIDE IS SPECTACULAR. A little too dark but overall structure was incredible! We ordered our food and it came out in maybe 20 mins which is quite a reasonable time but I'm not mad cause the food was AWESOME! After we ate our main dinner, of course we ordered cheesecake cause a visit to Cheesecake Factory ain't complete if you do not order cheesecake, me and my girl friend shared a chocolate hazelnut cheesecake AND IT WAS PHENOMENAL!! I really wish this could be our usual regular spot for night outings every week BUT YOU KNOW MONEY DOESNT GROW ON TREES!! But MAJOR PROPS TO OUR WAITRESS! Keep doing excellent work girl!!:)"
Ed M.,"Waianae, HI",73,4,,1.0,10/3/2017,"Waited 20 min to be seated on a Sunday late morning party of 3, after ordering our food, (Teri steak, Farmers omelet with ham instead of bacon, and 2 scramble eggs and toast for my 6 year old) we waited 1 hr. 45 min. before the first order cams,, my husband got his first (Teri steak) 1hr 10 min later, the farmers omelet came (30 min after the teri steak) and then the 2 eggs and toast came  (5 min after the omelet) when the omelet came it had bacon instead of ham so I had to send it back, I waited another 15 min or so before I got the omelet back this time with ham and NO cheese. I am furious now, the waitress wanted to take it back but I said no I refuse to wait any longer. All the toast that came with the meal was cold and dry with no butter on it. They said they do not butter the toast there. I asked for butter and when it came it was rock hard and un able to spread. The Kitchen cooks there SUCK. If you dont have a lifetime to wait do not go there. If you are hungry do not go there.The host/hostess there are not very friendly either, they did not welcome us, we had to ask if we needed to sign in and how long the wait was. Suck Suck Suck cheese."
