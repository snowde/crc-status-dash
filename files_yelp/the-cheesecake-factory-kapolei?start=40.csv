Brittney E.,"Kapolei, HI",197,62,165,5.0,9/30/2017,There's finally another Cheesecake Factory on the island where the west side folks don't have drive all the way to Waikiki! I'm so excited that this restaurant is at Ka Makana. I came here around 6pm on a Friday night. There was a line just to put my name down. The wait was around an hour. You're give a buzzer so you're able to walk around instead of just sitting and waiting outside the restaurant. The time went by really fast since I was looking/shopping for Christmas presents.  I liked sitting outside with the live music and the view of the sunset. The staff here is really nice and seem to be on top of things. Our waiter's name was Brandon I believe and he gave great recommendations for both our main course and dessert. I really enjoyed the salmon.  The only thing is that parking maybe hard to find now since the mall is starting to get more crowded now.  I can't wait to come back and try other cheesecakes :)
Laurie H.,"Honolulu, HI",103,44,9,4.0,12/4/2017,"We waited a couple months after they opened the new location, to give them time to ""settle in."" Meanwhile many of my friends had eaten there and liked it. Everyone said they waited no more than 1/2 hour even at peak times. We went at 7 PM on Sunday and had to wait a full hour to be seated. We had a friend visiting from the mainland and wandered around the mall for a while, so that was fine. Our buzzer never did go off, but the hostess came outside and called our name. When we were shown to a table at 8 PM there were a lot of empty tables inside and outside. Our waitress was professional,  friendly, and attentive. 3 out of 4 of us got our food within 30 minutes and everyone enjoyed their food: a chicken sandwich on white toast with (cold) fries; the ahi special (which my friend sad was one of the best things he's ever tasted; and chicken alfredo (stingy on the chicken but still good.) But my French Country Salad was very to slow to materialize. In fact the others were done eating when, at 9 PM, I was finally served a small, sad-looking, wilted salad. I hadn't eaten since morning so I was famished. The salad was gone within minutes and I am usually a slow eater. It tasted just okay. The manager did come to our table before I could utter a word of complaint, apologized for how long it took to get the salad, and said I wouldn't be charged for the salad. They obviously do care about their customers and try to make things right. I would definitely like to go back and give this place another try, but I won't bother with the French Country Salad again."
Tracy F.,"Kapolei, HI",432,15,35,4.0,12/6/2017,"Luis served us when we went last Saturday & he was awesome, very attentive & efficient.  I always get the jambalaya pasta when I go to this restaurant and it is delicious every time. We chose to wait a long time after it first opened to eat here because we were concerned about wait time.  We came for dinner on a Saturday evening last week and only waited 45 minutes. It was great!"
Michael R.,"Honolulu, HI",5,113,351,4.0,10/2/2017,"If patience is a virtue, I must be a saint.  No really.   So here is the situation.  We were a large party celebrating a birthday and decided to head to the Factory.  One it's brand new to this side of the island. Two they don't take reservations.  So one plus two equals a three hour wait. Yes, mathematicians three hour wait!!! I can not blame anyone for the amount of time we waited.  We were told it would be sometime by the staff. I just believed it would be sooner then later but sadly no.  The Waikiki location is bigger and we might have gotten seated earlier but the drive would be longer.   To their credit, they did apologize for the long wait and did bring our party some bread and water.  Some places where I had to wait for extremely long time gave hot appetizers but this was a nice gesture.  Forget the fact, that I went to Five Guys for a couple of larger fries for the group.  Anyway once inside it was crazy busy.  People were still eating late at 9pm on a Wednesday.  My 5yo didn't even want to eat. He just slept in the booth because it was past his bedtime.  And because it was such a larger group, two dishes were missing and made late. Actually one dish was made late. The other one had to be changed because they ran out if the main ingredient.  The food didn't come till about 940pm.   The food was good and the service was fantastic. From the hostess to the waiting staff.  The manger seems like there was two at the time explained and apologized and in my option did everything right.  I wish I could say I paid the bill (yea right) to see how they treated the late dishes and see about free cheesecake but the head of the table stayed behind to take care of the bill while we all left to get some sleep.  I had a heavy meal.  For those who wonder, I got the Bang Bang dish. It's chicken and shrimp in a curry sauce.  I loved this dish and not because of the chicken, shrimp, or curry.  But because of the name.  It sounds so cool when you say it like Mick Foley.  Of course, the server laughed and understood.   Parking is plentiful, nice seating areas, very clean restrooms. Staff super friendly even when close to closing time.  There kitchen is fully visible for anyone to see and the lighting was nice.   TIP: be prepared to wait. The pager they hand out works in the movie theater and almost the middle of the mall. I should have caught a movie.   Overall four stars.  If they gave out some calamari or chips and salsa before I went to Five Guys it would be different.  M"
Marcus B.,"Ewa Beach, HI",30,69,64,3.0,9/21/2017,"Fantastic product by this reputable brand in a prime location. I would recommend this place to all if you have an hour to wait! PROs: Excellent food selection, presentation, and very tasty. Even though this place was PACKED with at least a couple hundred customers during its opening month the large staff was busting there tail at all levels to serve each and every customer. Having enough well trained and courteous staff is an ongoing issue here on Oahu. Especially this far out from Waikiki Beach. The bar has lots of mixology specialties, a large wine selection, and a decent craft beer selection. The happy hour deals were good and during decent hours of 4-6pm. Some places that have happy hour from 2-5pm miss the point of happy hour for working people. The rest rooms were very clean. Parking can be challenging at peak times but that's to be expected at a mall in one of the most crowded parts of the island.  CONs: A knock that we had during our visit was that the margarita seemed very watered down or didn't come with the right proportion of Tequila. Maybe another knock is no WIFI. Biggest knock is food taking an hour to come out of the kitchen. I know this place is busy but WTF! An hour to wait for a table and another hour for the food is ridiculous. This wouldn't be if on the main land. Another place that operates in the 'Aloha' lifestyle."
Angel H.,"Honolulu, HI",971,834,7664,5.0,9/14/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory in Kapolei has the biggest menu out of all the Cheesecake Factory locations nationwide. They offer the regular menu as well as the Hawaiian menu. They also serve the small plates and skinny menu, which the Waikiki location does not offer. They will be having happy hour Mondays-Fridays from 4pm-6pm; discounted drinks and appetizers.  The ambiance and decor is similar to all the other locations. They have inside and outside dining. The bathrooms have modern faucets. I appreciate the warm water when I stick my hands under them. Since this location is at the Ka Makana Alii, they have tons of free parking. Our server recommended the cucumber lemonade. It sounded interesting enough, so I had to try it. It was pretty good, on the tart side and refreshing. For the appetizer we went with the sweet corn tamale cakes. It was delicious. It was crispy and moist, and I could taste the corn. I could have done without all the sauce that was put on it. I ordered my favorite, miso salmon with mashed potatoes. The fish was cooked perfectly and the miso sauce was wonderful. The hubby had the turkey burger and gave it two thumbs up. The turkey burger had mushrooms blended into the patty and topped with caramelized onions. For dessert, I ordered my new favorite cheesecake which is the celebration cheesecake. It has layers of regular cake alternated with cheesecake, topped with a cream cheese frosting.  I'm loving this location. Welcome to Kapolei, Cheesecake Factory! We needed a second location on this island."
Nicole Y.,"Mililani, HI",414,232,692,4.0,11/21/2017,"As a fan of the Olino theatres, I wanted to grab a bite at the Cheesecake Factory.  I have heard from my Yelp friends that have dined here that the wait can be very long.  I decided to take a chance and see if I would get lucky enough to get a table.  To my dismay, there was a large crowd outside the restaurant and even more people near the hostess stand.  Discouraged, I figured we should try and grab a seat at the bar or at the high tops near the bar.  The bar area was also full and there was only one seat left at the bar.  I quickly snagged the last seat at the bar, while my mister stood to wait for another seat to open up.  We decided to have drinks and wait for a high top table to open up.  As quickly as one opened, another patron swooped in to grab it.  We decided to remain at the bar and one of the waitresses was nice and offered to bring us another chair.  After we both were seated, we ordered our meals.  I must say that their menu has many options that made deciding what to eat very hard! Luckily our bartender had many great suggestions for us! We ordered and happily enjoyed: Crab and artichole dip Firecracker salmon rolls Carne asada steak medallions All of the dishes were great choices and plentiful for sharing! For being quite busy, I must say that I was impressed with the staff and great customer service! I will be heading here again but this time I will be sure to plan ahead and come early to grab a table !"
Marivic M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",325,130,252,5.0,9/27/2017,"Be ready to wait for some time being that this place is still brand new.  This place was super busy even on a Tuesday night but I just walked around the mall and held on to our buzzer.  I must say. The customer service is definitely top notch and they trained their new and existing workers perfectly! It almost felt like this place has been open for a while now and they take good care of their customers. Finally got our seat after almost a 2 hour wait.  Our waitress attended to us pretty quickly and took our drink order and brought us some yummy bread.  Finally placed our main order and took some time to get our food.  The only thing that I had a hard time getting use to is how dark it is in here... lol I felt like I needed to take my phone out and turn on the flashlight.   When our food came out, it was exactly what I expected... awesome!  Their menu is soo big I could eat here for a whole month and not be tired of it.  There were a couple of hiccups with our food, but overall the experience was good.  I'll be back when it kinda dies down a. It.  Welcome to the West side!"
Maria S.,"Waipahu, HI",43,42,72,4.0,10/6/2017,"I have to say for a popular franchise that just opened, the service and accommodations were excellent.  Tip: tables by the bar are first come first serve, at most you can sit 4. We were a party of 19 for Saturday lunch and because they didn't take reservations when I called, they advised me to come down hours before my anticipated time to talk to a manager to accommodate such a big party at a demanding time.  I went about 10:30 am to put in our names and they said we would probably be called in at 1:30 pm, everyone has to be present to be seated. We all came at 1:30 and it was still about another 25 min wait.  Once our host saw us it was so funny how intimidated he was. We could see his coworkers cheering him on saying ""you got this you got this."" Mind you we had 6 toddlers included in our party.  Our friend felt so bad that she helped him pass out our menus. Two servers helped us and were very attentive, got our drinks and food as timely as they can.  We tried the mushroom burger, da Vinci pasta, avocado spring rolls and mango shake.  Given the fact that they just opened and busy, they did take about 44 min to get to us but the quality and presentation was excellent. I loved that mango smoothie! Surprisingly we were soo full we didn't order desserts, but you can definitely order through their take our are if you don't want to dine in. Mushroom burger was delicious, the pasta was surprisingly sweet with a white wine sauce.  I was so impressed of the service I had to thank the manager for such excellent team work on their end."
Jenna S.,"Honolulu, HI",60,191,527,5.0,9/21/2017,"Decided to eat dinner here the day after their grand opening since we didn't want to drive to town. We got a buzzer at 7pm and were told an hour to hour half for a party of three. We got buzzed only after 40 minutes! We were seated outside, which turned out to be way better than inside, which was freezing!!!..and super loud. It was nice and cool outside. Although, I probably wouldn't sit out here during the day, it gets pretty hot out here. Our server was super friendly and on top of everything! We ordered two appetizers which came out pretty fast, and our food came out fast and fresh as well. Expect the same food as Waikiki location, the only difference is they have a much larger menu to choose from. Overall our experience was awesome and couldn't have been better. That's amazing considering they just opened."
Barry S.,"Aiea, HI",6,75,27,3.0,1/3/2018,"This is a new restaurant located at the Ka Makana Ali'i shopping center near the Ōlino Theatres. My wife and I had a Saturday lunch here, and being a busy post-Christmas weekend parking was a challenge. The grounds outside the entrance were well-kept and the staff at the front warmly invited us in. There was no wait for a table, and our server was very prompt in greeting us, telling us about the specials and getting our drink order. Menu prices were as I expected for a Cheesecake Factory AND being in Hawaii. Needless to say, it's not going to be a weekly stop. I ordered the lunch pizza and salad, which if I recall was about $14. I expected the lunch portion to be small, but my wife and I could have split it. The pizza was okay, but definitely not as good as California Pizza Kitchen. I would say it was more like a Digiorno pizza on a restaurant plate. We saved room for dessert and split a slice of cheesecake. It was excellent, but at $9 a slice it better well be. The service was superb, so for that I would give 5 stars alone. However, for the quality of food for the price paid I can only give 3 at best. There are better places to dine."
Paula K.,"Kapolei, HI",7,105,217,5.0,9/26/2017,Thank you CF for opening in my neighborhood! Finally a fabulous restaurant chain with GREAT desserts now with a convenient location with tons of free parking!  The restaurant has tons of outdoor dining and is beautifully decorated like their other locations. The wait is long and they hand you a piece of paper instead of buzzers (someone forgot to order?)so the hostess must be going crazy. Lines are long and expect to wait on a Monday night 2 hours! But like anything new in this time...that will change. Just visit on off hours and enjoy! Food is always fabulous.
Layla F.,"Pearl City, HI",431,103,222,4.0,12/5/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is really great! The location is convenient for people who live on the west side of O'ahu that need their Cheesecake Factory fix.  FOOD:  The food is great. As usual, the selection is extensive, so you will probably find something that tickles your fancy. I really enjoy their fried calamari and their shrimp and sausage pasta. I would also like to add that their appetizers are great and you can't quite go wrong with any of them. For dessert, the sundae is good. The chocolate sauce is delectable. However, I come here for the CHEESECAKE. Their keylime cheesecake is probably my favorite.  SERVICE:  The service is good. I've been here a few times now and each time, the servers have been friendly and attentive. I can't complain. They have made great recommendations, too, which has enhanced my experiences.  LOCATION:  As I mentioned earlier, this place is very easy to find. It is located in Ka Makana Ali'i, so parking is pretty easy to find, too!"
Kendra M.,"El Paso, TX",2,14,1,5.0,1/10/2018,Who doesn't love cheesecake!?! But this location was a great experience. I dined here after eloping and they made sure we felt the magic of being newlyweds. The food was also amazing!
Hayami M.,"Pearl City, HI",12,42,87,5.0,9/24/2017,"Spoiler alert:  there's already a line out the door at 10:30 a.m.  Truth be told, silly townies still return at 12:45!  And wait another 1 hour to get some lunch!  That's so unlike us, but WORTH IT! The crusted ahi and ono specials sounded dreamy!  We ended up ordering the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and the Thai Lettuce Wraps.  Healthy, healthy, but oh soooo tasty!  Portions were for big people, and leave no room for dessert!  Service great, place beautiful!"
Mikiala C.,"Ala Moana, Honolulu, HI",20,78,64,3.0,11/20/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes, not too much of a fan of their food. I gave them another shot at their Kapolei location and I must say my feelings for them are the same. Cool ambiance, great cheesecakes, food was ok, ""merp"" Service. Today I ordered the: ""Charbroiled Burger Covered with Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions, Melted Swiss, Fontina Cheese and Mayo"" And opted for sweet potato fries. I felt like the fries were a little cold and my burger was a little undercooked. Service was a little slow but I gave them the benefit of the doubt, still being in its first few months of opening. I didn't have room for dessert this time around. Next time I believe I'll just stick to ordering dessert to go."
Cristine R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",5,93,19,5.0,11/22/2017,"Waited about 15 minutes to be sat on a Wednesday night. Not too bad, and also got a booth. Score!! Usually get the chicken Madeira with extra sauce on the side. So good!! And before I forget to mention, their bread is the bomb! I was very please with the service that was provided from when we first sat down til we left. Also make room for desert because the cheesecakes are so good, so many to choose from. I usually get the banana cream cheesecake and red velvet cheesecake. Super yummy"
Maile C.,"Waipahu, HI",121,93,140,4.0,11/21/2017,"Wow on a Tuesday at 5pm they are not extremely busy, there was no wait! First time at the Kapolei location and a good first experience.  We ordered ahi tartar, Korean cauliflower, stuffed mushrooms, crab bites and avocado spring roles. Each dish was amazing. The tartar is quite small, 4 wonton like chips served with ahi over avocado and a soy ginger sauce, amazing taste. The Korean cauliflower had a hint of spice but not over powering and to our surprise the cauliflower is tempura style. Next was the avocado rolls, and what  a different appetizer this was. It tasted so fresh and light. Stuffed mushrooms and crab bites come with 6 pieces each and are so tasty.  Each of these dishes are off the small plate menu, but shared amongst 3 people it was just enough.  For dessert we had the strawberry short cake, the chocolate truffle tower, and the apple crisp. The strawberry short cake was a bit disappointing as the cake was more like a biscuit and a bit hard, the chocolate cake was nice when the strawberries and ice cream were taken from the strawberry short cake. The Apple crisp was a bit sweet, so we weren't able to finish to many bites. Nonetheless despite the strawberry disappointment everything was amazing and tasty."
Christopher S.,"Waipahu, HI",2,56,,4.0,11/21/2017,"We got lucky and tried 4:30 pm last Saturday -- walked right in and sat down on the veranda. The hostess said most of the people waiting outside were large parties. Anyways, I am usually not a fan of franchise restaurants, as the food is often uninspired and sub-par. Not so today. Everything was fab! Drinks were a Lemon Drop and a Strawberry martini -- both taste winners. Appetizers were the corn cakes. You MUST try these -- taste the same as our favorite street vendor lady in Cabo San Lucas makes! We also had the egg roll sampler which was okay, but I likely wouldn't order it again. Main dishes were the stuffed chicken tamales (yum!) and chicken and biscuits. Wife said the chicken and biscuits tasted good, but she had never before been served with the biscuits dry and laid on top... strange. One thing that stands out not in a good way is that it seems like more than half the menu is chicken items. Unsure why, but it does limit your choices if you've been craving something else, even with such a large menu. Finally, as we all know, the cheesecake desserts never disappoint. Today was no different. Good meal for a formula/franchise restaurant."
Sally R.,"Kailua-Kona, HI",117,17,,2.0,1/9/2018,My Chinese chicken salad was dry and had all iceberg lettuce.   They forgot almonds and mandarin oranges.   Worst meal I've ever had from The Cheesecake Factory.
