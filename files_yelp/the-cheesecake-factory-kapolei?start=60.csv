Lorie G.,"Kapolei, HI",78,34,37,5.0,11/21/2017,"One thing I love about the Cheesecake Factory is that they give you buzzers when you check in so that you don't have to wait around if you don't want to, and shop your hearts content around the mall until your buzzer signals.   I haven't had to wait too long for a table - at most, 30 minutes at this location and I've visited 3 times since it opened in September. The wait staff is very friendly, the food is tasty, and I love their skinny menu which all food items are under 590 calories. I decided to eat the turkey burger from the skinny menu and added avocado - it was juicy and I can't believe the calorie content was low! The waitress even brought us fresh bread that just came out of the oven and topped with butter - oooh child - it was carb heaven!  My third visit, we had a party of 6. We let the waitress know that we were going to the movies, so we needed our food out in a reasonable amount of time. Needless to say, we all got to fill our bellies filled and made it to our movie with time to spare. Guess you can say I'm a regular eating here 3 times already and am not stopping any time soon!"

Maelani E.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/20/2017,"Let me just start by saying how awesome the experience was. The thing I want to rave about the most is our servers KELLI & ALEXIS... They were awesome! I've eaten at a lot of fast pace restaurants and have had a lot of great servers, but I can honestly say that this duo topped them all. Not to mention, I was part of a 17 person party. Every single one of us felt as if we were catered to. All of our food came out around the same time within 10 minutes of ordering; now when does that ever happen with a 10+ party?... never. Splitting the check between a big party has always been a hassle and sometimes defers people to ask; but these two made it happen effortlessly!!  Now let's talk about the food, I ordered the Bistro Shrimp pasta and my boyfriend ordered the Steak Diane & Chicken Madeira. My pasta was perfect, it  wasn't too creamy but had just the right amount of sauce and was loaded with shrimp (which a lot of places are usually stingy with the shrimp.) My boyfriend is usually very picky when it comes to his steaks, but he loved it. Also, the Chicken Madeira wasn't dry and was filled with flavor! You know how a lot of chicken dishes are usually really dry and lack flavor? Well this one wasn't!!  I can't stress this enough, when you come here, try and get Kelli or Alexis to be your server, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. The food was great, but they were the icing on the cheesecake"
Erica M.,"Kapolei, HI",237,6,,4.0,1/6/2018,"For a new restaurant in this area they seemed to do a good job getting it up and running with decent service. I have only been once so far. But I love Cheesecake Factory restaurants, I always get the bang bang chicken and shrimp. Ive had it in Cali, Vegas, Nashville, and now here. Every location tasted just as good. Thats why I love Cheesecake Factory. The food is consistently good, and my favorite dish, is my favorite dish no matter where I am. I'm only giving 4 stars because I have not been there and sat at an actual table, and the service at the bar was a bit inattentive at first. It's a new restaurant, only can get better from here!"
Bryson H.,"Waipahu, HI",298,5,5,5.0,12/10/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory! Finally one on the westside saving the drive to Waikiki. Every time I dine at Cheesecake Factory, they always have exceptional staff.  I would like to give a huge shoutout to our waiter Quinlan aka Q. He gave excellent service with his upbeat energetic personality! He made our evening fantastic  and I hope he is recognized for his phenomenal hospitality and service! Cheesecake Factory Kapolei... Please recognize Quinlan! We will be back much more because of Q :) Awesome!"
Mika K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",78,28,65,3.0,1/7/2018,This is my second time at the Kapolei location.  My first time here was awesome.  This time round.... HORRIBLE!!  Our server seemed overwhelmed.  Drinks (not even water) didn't come out till about 15mins after we ordered it.
Miss L.,"Honolulu, HI",286,24,67,3.0,10/28/2017,"Beware -- Standard tipping procedures is to tip off of the subtotal. Their ""suggested"" tipping is calculated off of the total including tax. 22% of this tab would only be $14.39 not $15.07 We sat on the high tops at the bar area so we wouldn't have to wait to be seated. Drinks took about 20 min to come out. The food took way longer than normal and by then we weren't hungry.  The potatoes served with the breakfast menu items were so over cooked there weren't any potatoes left....it was basically empty burnt shells of what used to be potato cubes.  Waitress was really nice and got us extra bread while we were waiting for our food and apologized for the drinks taking so long.  I will go back, but will definitely adjust the amount I tip and not go off of their ""suggested"" tips."
Ao H.,"Waianae, HI",9,36,30,4.0,11/18/2017,"Parking, yes! Wait time: none Service, Kainoa, great! Food, good. Cheesecake: Aca-awesome!! A bit pricey for our table of 2 but not complaining about anything else."
Greg A.,"Honolulu, HI",408,131,806,5.0,10/20/2017,"When you come to a Cheesecake Factory, it is generally like a McDonald's. However, burgers here are much larger! I say that with high respects in the essence of the restaurant chain's consistency. Service here is on par with excellence. If food not good, they will return it and if certain cases, they will not charge you. I even see old faces since this place is near my home town. Service is very professional and many kinds of personalities. Within the past four times I have eaten here since they have opened, we have waited for almost two hours on weekend nights. However, it does depend on whether you want to dine in the air-conditioned side versus the lanai (outdoors) area.  On those week nights after 9pm, we were given a 45 minute wait and we actually got in before their 45-minute estimate! I also was very pleased with Sabrina, she is a sweet Southern woman here. If you have her, she would help you decide on what to order for the indecisive folks. The menu here is very extensive and offers a ""skinny-licious"" menu where you have smaller portions and healthy alternatives. The regular menu portions are very deluxe. I love their signature meat loaf. Roasted and made fresh, and it comes with their mashed potatoes but you can substitute for their house salad with their mango dressing. Sooo good! Oh and for those who want tex-mex, you must try their loaded chicken enchiladas. It has so much flavor and cheese loaded in the flour tortillas! Just make sure you ask for the sour cream on the side and not on top. The courtesy molasses and sour dough bread is also very yummy and refillable.  Mac and cheese bites are so bomb! If you come here for breakfast, their waffles are also a great way to start your weekend. Cheesecake here is hit or miss for me. I still think its more on the creamy side and not as rich. There is much sweet taste, which for sure fulfill sweet-tooths here. The pumpkin cheesecake with pecans was more pecan-dominant and was not a fan. However, the tuxedo cheesecake is very good for chocolate fans. Not to sweet, has that mix of milk and dark chocolate flavors. However, I feel that their single slices are huge. All of them are, except the splenda-sugared ones. They look of it plain with no whipped cream and nothing decorated in it. What helps you enjoy it is the graham cracker crust. Pretty much safe like for those who are diabetic.  Many people gripe about their wait for their food, and so if you do not care for everyone to get their food at the same time, just inform your server to send it out when it arrives. You can even consider having an entree to share as an app. Based on the four times I have dined in, we have waited for about 25 to 30 minutes. Never have I ever experienced more than an hour unless you have a huge party I presume. The party sizes I have come with were with 3 or 5 peeps, so the avg family can muster the wait.  Overall, great service, food, and quality all within a place that is great for families, dates, and catching up with friends. They also have a buzzer that will reach to the Kamakana Ali'i stage, movie theater, and H&M."
Jenny N.,"Honolulu, HI",8,66,124,5.0,11/3/2017,"Update 11/3/2017 Customer service was great, thank you for addressing the problem.  10/31/2017 840 pm This experience is based off of the first time dining here.  First off, we thought we would be able to put our names in and walk around, since there usually is a wait at the waikiki one. Went in, asked how long the wait for 2 is, hostess at the front said now! Cool! We get to go in without a wait!  Our hostess that led us to the table is a very professional and polite man, I think his name was Ty. He had glasses. He handed us menus in an elegant manner, and even bowed! And told us that our waitress Nicole will be with us shortly. Awesome service so far! Great job front desk! I wanted to see how fast we would get in and out of this place so I decided to put some fun in our dinner and set a timer.  We look around and the place isn't really that busy, our section isn't at least.  There was a table of six next to us, but already had appetizers.  The waitress Nicole was there but we didn't have any water on our table to start off. I was really really thirsty. I had just gotten off a really long day 12 hour shift back to back work. This table took a while to order. So in the mean time, it would have been nice if she had walked away to get drinks, give the big table some time to order, then come back. Anyway, she took their orders. Timer now says 26 minutes. There was a male waiter, he kind of saw me looking around, always caught a glimpse of weird eye contact and disappears. He came back with two waters for us and we weren't even his table! He managed to take the orders for his table and helped us out also.  Okay, so now Nicole comes back. Now at 40 minutes into our dinner, we just ordered the spinach and cheese dip to start then two pastas. 20 minutes later, 1 hour into the entire wait, were wondering where the appetizer is. At this point my boyfriend and I are starved. She comes back and tells us ""oops. My fault. I accidentally put your appetizer and your entrees in with the same order."" So basically what this means is our pastas and our appetizer will come out all at the same time. Wow! What's the point? Still, we were charged for the chips and cheese. She then offered to sponsor one cheesecake slice. Cool. That's nice of her.  Another 10 or so minutes, everything comes out onto our table. Two pastas, one big plate of cheese and chips brought out by a busser. Then, Nicole comes out a lot later, didn't check if all our food had come out yet. I didn't touch my pasta, because I usually like the fact that they come out with the parm cheese and grate it on top of the pasta for you. This time, we had to ASK if they could help us out with that. Wow... again, the place is DEAD in our section.  We eat our food, plenty of left overs, it is 1 hour and 20 minutes into the meal. She asks us if we can choose the cheese cake we wanted. I chose one.  My boyfriend chose one. And I had asked her to put them in to go boxes so we can munch a little then grab and go.  We wait a while I had to stand a little to look for her. Couldn't find her. So I walked up to the front desk, asked Ty, our original host, why we couldn't find Nicole, and why our order that we had put in a while ago wasn't coming to the table.  He apologized so quickly and replied promptly to my request regarding my questions so I went back to my table. Good job Ty!  Nicole runs up with the check in hand and a regular plate with a melted Adam's cheesecake in hand. Apologized and said, ""Oh my god, I am so sorry. I thought there was a runner. But the runner went home and I didn't know.""  Wait hold up. What? You had a runner that you didn't know that had to leave work? So, that's why maybe checking the table to see if they had gotten everything the way it should be planned...  On top of that, she only came by with one Cheesecake when we had ordered two. I asked her to put it in a to go container, like I originally ordered. And mentioned the Oreo cheesecake also.  I really wanted to give her a chance, but seeing the situation with the section she had; empty, the outside tables empty, and the entire back of the restaurant empty, and with plenty of waiters and waitresses waiting around... I would like to think she did not have a lot going on. But I'm just assuming.  Waikiki's restaurant is the busiest in the nation, or so I've heard. But the entire wait/check in/dine in/cash out process goes by so smoothly, that Waikiki's restaurant cuts today's time in HALF.  Total dine in time: almost two hours.  We ended up taking the two cheese cakes home, his of which is melted and mine.  Would I come back here to eat? Definitely not. Total wait time and dine in time at the Waikiki Cheesecake Factory equals LESS than what I've experienced at this place."
Leilani P.,"Honolulu, HI",180,79,64,4.0,11/1/2017,"Normally there's a crazy line here but today was our lucky day! We waited less than 20 minutes. They also had live music. As soon as we sat down and read the menu, we could not decide what to order! Sooooo many choices. I ordered the miso salmon sub rice for mash potatoes and it was delicious! I can't wait to come back and try everything else. Oh and the service is pretty good for a place that just opened not to long ago."
Mei-Lan C.,"Honolulu, HI",214,306,1504,4.0,10/16/2017,"came here for lunch today. first time here. ordered the : chicken piccata lunch 13.95 $ loco moco 14.95 $ the wait here is just as long as the waikiki locattion. both dishes that we ordered were delicious and our waiter was very friendly and attentive.  love their free table bread , which is always fresh and warm"
Vincent T.,"Waipahu, HI",135,169,616,2.0,10/18/2017,"If I'm being honest, a 3 hour wait or a party of 13 to be seated is absolutely ridiculous! ‍ once we were seated the waiters and waitresses were very kind. Although one of them dropped my wife's entree and they gave her a salad to tie her over. We were all done eating by the time her food arrived so she didn't enjoy it at all. I ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with pasta. I was disappointed with the portion and the scampi hardly had any taste of garlic. The white chocolate cheesecake with caramel was too sweet. Should've stuck with the traditional. Definitely not returning until the nostalgia dies down. Maybe they should concentrate on less menu items and focus more on quality. Definitely status-quo but friendly staff."
Shaela M.,"Kapolei, HI",3,56,49,5.0,11/8/2017,"They have a really big menu. From pasta to steak, to chicken & burgers/salads/soups/fish etc. although the wait my be long depending on time of arrival, it is definitely worth the wait. I ordered the pizza & salad combo. The food is very tasteful. The crust of the pizza had a softness yet slight crunch to it which I really enjoyed.  I also had a strawberry ice tea & not lemonade but it tasted like it was all lemonade & no ice tea with a little hit of strawberry. It could've used a little more strawberry. But Being that it was lemonade tasting, I drank it anyway. It tasted good but could use way more strawberry. Their Oreo cheesecake is bomb, especially with the big huge Oreo cookie with no white cream that is in the inside of a normal Oreo.  I highly recommend NOT PASSING UP on dessert. Their cheesecakes are bomb & so goooooooddddd. My coworkers all got different types of cheesecakes & they all enjoyed theirs.  I HIGHLY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE & I HIGHLY WOULD COME BACK, the only thing is that sometimes there could be a long wait, sometimes 1.5 hours is what I've heard. We didn't have to wait but then again we got there when they opened at 1130."
Angel D.,"Honolulu, HI",253,333,1370,2.0,12/12/2017,"First time coming here and I'm not that impressed lol. Not sure what the hype is all about.... anyways we came to cheesecake factory around 3PM, it wasn't really busy so we sat at the bar. Ordered two cucumber mojito & it was great. I love that they have a ""skinny"" menu which had food items that were a little lower on calories. We got the salmon rolls and they were tasty, but super skimpy. We mostly got the wrapper and barely any salmon. We ended our lunch with a round of shots. Finally we got the bill & it was $60 bucks lol. Blew my mind because the cocktails were $13 each, $13 for the skimpy salmon rolls and shots were skimpy too. $10 for Jameson? Yuckkkk. And to top it off, as we were leaving we found out happy hour is at 4PM.. very overpriced and definitely not worth the money. At least the decor inside is very nice lol probably won't be dining here, and if I do come back it's only for the cheesecake."
Danielle M.,"Waianae, HI",0,127,280,4.0,12/23/2017,"Came here for the 1st time for early dinner walked in at 3:30pm on a Saturday 2 days before Christmas no wait was seated right away for a party of 5, nice surprise. We usually go to Waikiki location so we were prepared to wait 2-3 hrs. The waiter was great took our order of drinks, appetizers, meals and desserts one time since a few people at our table wanted dessert 1st. Timing between appetizers and meals was perfect. My mom said her pork chops was a little on the dry side but other then that everyone enjoyed the meal. Seating inside, outside and at bar. Restrooms of course. Lots of parking being part of the mall but I personally thinking the parking is small for a mall this size. If you just want to order cheesecake they have a counter when you enter. I like the ambiance at this location better than Waikiki bcuz its not as dark and it feels more lively. When we were leaving there was alot of people waiting and I heard one person say they were waiting for a little over an hour. Definitely recommend going Non Peak hours."
Nanette S.,"Kapolei, HI",109,26,10,4.0,10/21/2017,"We waited a couple of weeks to let the buzz die out a bit. We went on a Tuesday night thinking it wouldn't be too crazy. There was a 20min wait for 4 adults and one high chair. They were super busy but the host did a really good job at moving people. Our server, Sabrina I think her name was, was super nice. Everything we ordered was delicious. Seriously, the luau salad is PERFECT. It's huge! My husband and I shared and it was more than enough.  Our table had the crab bites, grilled steak medallions, grilled salmon, luau salad, kids meal sliders, a Heineken, and a pineapple mojito all for under $100 - not including tip. Everything we ordered was delicious. Nothing went to waste. I had to take away one star just because everything took a little time, but that was expected for it being so busy. There was one mix up with the food and our server did forget to order the beer for us but nothing major at all. I'm super excited to come back and actually save room for Cheesecake."
Kelly C.,"O‘ahu, HI",10,1,,1.0,12/10/2017,"So after hearing how good this place is we decided to give it try. First- utensils placed on the bare table. How ridiculous and unsanitary, and a restaurant? Seriously, just how dirty are the towels that are used repeatedly to wipe dirty tables?  Second- my wife and I both ordered burgers, hers well, mine medium well. What we were served, hers medium to medium rare, mine medium, but neither close to done. We were starving so we just ate anyway and hoped for the best. The taste was ok, nothing great.  Third- an empty glass is a pet peeve of mine, a sure way to deduct from a tip and our server left us thirsty. Finally- to top it all off, when the server returned with the receipt to sign something was missing.......my debit card. She left my freaking bank card somewhere and hurried on. All of that and I still left a 15% tip because I'm a nice guy.  A nice guy that will not be back to their establishment."
Michelle R.,"Ewa Beach, HI",118,36,50,5.0,10/26/2017,"Last night we met some friends here and ended up being a party of 9. It was a Friday night so it was very busy and the average wait time was about 2 hours. Once we were seated our waiter ,Tasi was friendly, and answered all of our questions about the huge menu. He put in our drink orders right away and always filled our water. The lava flows were amazing. We ordered the nacho appetizers which was very tasty. We had ordered the Shepherds Pie, Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo, Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, and the Griiled Salmon. The portions were generous and all of our dishes were awesome. I had no room for dessert but opted to do a takeout on the cheesecake. Overall, the Shepherds Pie, Steak Diane and Gumbo were delish and a definite must! This being my second time here I must say that both times, once just the hubby and I for lunch and the next with a large group for dinner, the service was impeccable! I work in the service industry and know what it takes to give good service. Knowledge of product and attentive, friendly and efficient wait staff deserve the"
Michelle S.,"Waianae, HI",107,227,472,4.0,9/30/2017,I'm a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I'm so glad I have a location within 30 minutes! I've visited this location twice within a week.....the food is good! My personal opinion....better than the waikiki location. The employees are so nice and do try to make your visit a good one. I'd give this location five stars if the wait wasn't so long. But hey what should I expect when everything's so good! I hope this hype dies down and the wait becomes better because my first visit I waited 90 minutes! Once the wait is over your experience will sure be a good one
