Jennifer T.,"Kapolei, HI",43,79,148,3.0,12/5/2017,"I should probably deduct more stars for the bad service. They're lucky I love their cheesecakes.. So about that service. Keeping in mind I had just gotten off a 13hr shift and barely had a break for lunch. I joined my family that had gotten there ahead of me so when I got there I wouldn't have to wait. They had already ordered appetizers,  but waited for me to order the entrees. We put in our orders. One by one everyone else's food arrives. Except mine! The waitress checked on us when the food arrived. The next time she checked on us they were halfway done with their food and mine still hadn't arrived. So we inquire.. She goes to find out and comes back profusely apologizing that it wasn't made and asked if I still want it. No, I came here to starve and watch my family eat. Yes, I want it! She offered me a soup for my wait which I declined as my entree was gumbo. I don't want to fill on another soup. I want my gumbo! At this time we also told her we were there to celebrate our son's birthday. She said ""ok."" So the gumbo comes out after my kids have finished eating and moved onto dessert. My gumbo was really good. Flavorful with the right amount of spice. The calamari we had for appetizer got inhaled by my boys it was so good. The kid's grilled cheese is also quite good. Probably the best grilled cheese on a kids menu. The chinese chicken salad was  good. My oldest had some kind of burrito supreme. It was huge. He said he really liked it. My middle one had the shrimp with angel hair pasta, he didnt realize it would have so much fresh tomatoes in it so he didn't really care for it. He traded his father his chicken alfredo. The sauce for the alfredo was runny, but the flavor was good.  The cheesecakes we got were the strawberry and I took my vanilla bean cheesecake to go so my family didn't have to further wait for me. The cheesecake as always was on point. Airy and sooo yummy. It was the first time I had the vanilla bean, but I think I found another favorite. If you like vanilla ice cream, you will love the vanilla bean cheesecake.  Back to the service.. after failing to get me my food with everyone else's and completely forgetting we told her we were celebrating a birthday she brings us the check. There is no comp for anything for the inconvenience/sub par service. No comped dessert or singing for the birthday boy. I have to say I left quite annoyed. I only ate a few bites of my meal there bc my family was already done and waiting for me.  Will I come back? For cheesecake, most definitely. But as for dining in.. maybe take out."
Keo K.,"Honolulu, HI",62,151,398,5.0,9/28/2017,"FIRST TIME EVER AT CHEESECAKE FACTORY PARKING &a LOCATION: Cheesecake Factory Kapolei is in the Ka Makana Alii Mall in its own free standing building separate from the main mall but very close. They do have extensive parking for Cheesecake Factory that is lot style and is shared with all patrons of Ka Makana Alii. Stalls are fairly big not Costco size big, but bigger than most mall stalls which are super tiny. We lucked out and got a parking stall right near the outside dining. HOSTESS & GREETERS: When you enter their is an obvious sign in desk with two hostesses or greeters with genuine smiles who are informative and sincere. Despite the mayhem of a dinner rush with a huge crowd they seemed to handle it with so much ease as if there wasn't a gang of people and it being super busy they didn't make me feel rushed or stressed at all. A+ for that quality, because if I was in a busy environment I'd definitely loose my cool  We arrived 6:05pm on a Wednesday night so we fully expected to wait. She informed us for a party of 5 wait would be 75-90 minutes for inside dining and 60 minutes for outside. There wasn't much of a breeze outside so we opted for the inside. Right on the money with the wait was actually 77 minutes exactly because we were seated at 7:22pm. Yes I know who actually remembers stuff like that lol I'm meticulous like that. I didn't remember the initial hostess name who took my name and informed me of the wait time but she was brilliant young tan long hair skinny gorg! Tyra was the hostess who ushered us to our beautiful corner booth, she was awesome informative helpful and gave us amazing customer service because she removed the plates and utensils near our nosy toddler baby girl before we noticed! A+++ for her!!  WAITER STAFF: our waitress was sanoe b she was amazing and offered us outstanding customer service throughout our entire meal. They didn't make my original order correct but sanoe sincerely apologized and immediately got it fixed within 3 minutes! That's amazing team work and truly unheard of! Best customer service experience ever seriously! I take pictures of all my food and drinks so that's how I know all these time frames to the minute. We ordered our food at 740 got our drinks at 750 food at 810, so it literally took 10 minutes for our drinks and half hour for our food which is speedy for me being that there was 150+ people in attendance on a busy evening dinner rush. Their was another gentlemen tall slender white who was overseeing everything same uniform as the waiters, he was spectacular! He was overseeing every table making the napkins were under drinks, refills and tables were attended to. He's a great addition to an amazing staff because it's the little things that he noticed that will surely keep customers loyal and coming back constantly!!  FOOD & DRINKS: I had a rough week at work and don't typically drink but had to try the blue Hawaiian. It was the perfect amount of sweet and kick that I needed for my hump day, I will DEFINITELY order it again. I'm not a fan of coconut but I could barely taste it!! Yummmmers for sure. The bread that they bring out is awesome two options and the butter is delicious with a hint of sweetness to it. My husband ordered the Oreo milkshake and omg it was huuuuuuge and Oreo. I make him milkshakes at home and he's a fan of chocolate ice cream with Oreos inside so I know they use a LOT of Oreos because I use a full row from the bag and mines aren't half as oreo eeey as his milkshake. It's large and beautiful!! Tastes like they use the whole bag DELICIOUS! The ribeye steak was delicious so tender and tasty that my husband didn't even have a steak knife he only had a butter knife but honey that steak was so tender so yummy he could've just used his fork!!! My husband said, ""IM NOT A YELPER BUT I JUST MIGHT CREATE AN ACCOUNT TO RECOMMEND THE STEAK."" We are avid steak lovers (peep the meat badge) and I tried the steak and I too was moaning in my seat. I ordered the bacon burger which was very juicy moist delectable with all the bacon. Fries were sheer perfection crunchy soft and just the right amount of starch. We ordered some cheesecakes for my parents and they absolutely loved it.  I've tried cheesecakes before and it always tasted bland or not sweet enough but lawdddd this place makes me change my mind about cheesecakes forever!  We don't eat cheesecake, we NEVER order it at any restaurant but the service and the first time trying it tonite I'm now a full blown fan of cheesecake!! I'm telling everybody I know about the superior impeccable service I received tonite, and thank you staff of CF Kapolei that made it enjoyable thank you!!"
Laura H.,"Wahiawa, HI",110,109,331,4.0,10/2/2017,To say that the food is yummy here is an understatement!. As I got to finally have brunch for the first time in the new Cheesecake Factory on the island and my experience was decent.  Listen the waiting wasn't too long for just me and my husband. We sat outside as per request to sit anywhere  The waitress we had was very nice and helpful! Now we waited longer than expected for our food but thank god they had a great manager who let us know what was happening and both me and my husband got a free cheesecake for being patient ! The food was of course worth the wait ! My husband got Huevos Rancheros and I got the fried chicken and waffles with Benedict eggs.  I also got a drink called Lava Flow !  Must try if you like piña coladas!! Only difference I believe is the strawberries mixed in.  Both plates we loved ! My husbands take on the huevos rancheros even tho a different style it was great!  As for me loved my chicken and waffles !  Hopefully you guys have better luck on not waiting as long ! And I must say for being new definitely on top of their game !!
Ashley B.,"Waianae, HI",131,90,154,5.0,10/18/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is my go to for my birthday every year. I have been patiently waiting to visit this location!!! *They do not take reservations. We showed up early to reserve a large table and ended up waiting about 2 hours as everyone has to be present to be seated. Lucky for us, it was the exact time for happy hour(4-6pm)! I swear they keep adding more and more items to their menu. Not sure how they do it but everything I have tried is fantastic! Once we were all seated, we ended up outside which was great because there was also live music. Made our experience that much better. Service was great and we were definitely taken care of! I plan on coming back very soon for more. :)"
Emy R.,"Kapolei, HI",1127,91,1401,5.0,9/22/2017,"So my crazy dad wanted to check out The Cheesecake Factory on opening night. My mom is in Japan so guess who had to be his date? In fact my dad called me a week before they opened and told me I was going with him. I dragged my nephew with us, lol. When we got there, we were told the wait would be 75 - 90 mins. I thought for sure my dad would not want to wait that long but he did so we waited. 2 hours later we were seated. Dads ugh!!!!  The wait was so worth it. It was such a crazy busy night for them but the waitress and the waiter who took care of our table were so attentive and friendly. I have to give a shout out to the waiter who was from CF Boston. He was there to train the new staff. I regret not getting his name. He knew the menu inside and out. He gave us suggestions which were spot on. He regularly checked on us despite having a full restaurant. Loved him!  For appetizers we ordered the Buffalo Blast and Nachos. Omgee, the Buffalo Blast is super delish! It's like shredded boneless buffalo wings deep fried. Highly recommend this dish. The nachos were equally as good. Portions are huge by the way. For my main, I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. This was really good with a lemon sauce on it. The presentation looked like a spider, kinda creepy but it was delish. I was so full on appetizers that I had to take mine home. Portions for the main are big too. My nephew ordered the Bacon Bacon Burger and anything that has double bacon on it you know is going to be good. The burger was season perfectly and it was very good. If you're a burger lover, order this and you won't be disappointed. So my dad, is stubborn and impatient. He would never wait 2 hours to go to a restaurant. In fact he would probably have a tantrum if it was anywhere else. During our 2 hour wait, we were trying to talk him into going to CPK, promising him that we'll bring him to CF another time. He wasn't having it. So what does the man order after a 2 hour wait? PIZZA!! The irony wasn't lost on me or my nephew lol. He ordered the Everything Pizza and loved it.  For dessert I had the Reese's Cheesecake which tasted just like a Reese's Buttercup - I had asked the waiter to surprise me since I couldn't make a decision. After a few questions from him, he brought me this. Super yum. My dad ordered the Coffee Cheesecake and said it was really good. I didn't try his since I was too busy stuffing my face with mine.  I will definitely be back. Kudos to CF on their opening night for keeping the food and service to a high standard."
R K.,"Kapolei, HI",0,76,106,5.0,10/2/2017,"Came on Sunday.  There were people milling around waiting to open at 10 but silly no one wanted to start a line.  Had about 15 minutes until they opened.  We went right up front and stood behind an elderly couple... then everyone came and began to line up.  Got seated immediately.  Surprised of how well they handled large groups.  One set of 20 and another with 17 people.  That's some big groups. Service was great and so was the food. Wife had the low carb Cheesecake as her lunch, I split with my son the factory nachos, bacon bacon cheeseburger and Their lunch chicken Romano.  Definitely would get them again but their menu is so big it'll be awhile!  Quality of the food and service is outstanding.  Plan to return again during the holidays."
Kysia N.,"Kapolei, HI",16,5,,1.0,12/22/2017,"***  FOOD POISONING *** Normally, I love the cheese cake factory. Infact we had our wedding cake made here back then they did wedding cakes.  However, after having lunch there yesterday I came home with more than just to-go boxes. I spent the whole afternoon and night in the fetal position on the bathroom floor. NOT worth the risk."
Lisha Z.,"Kapolei, HI",36,8,15,4.0,12/18/2017,"Went there after work, no waiting outside! Tried the Chinese chicken salad and steak, portion as big as usual, kinda busy inside,"
Gabriel T.,"Aiea, HI",458,994,1262,5.0,9/26/2017,"One of my girlfriend's most favorite places to eat is finally in an area most convenient to us more local people on the West O'ahu side of the island, specifically in Kapolei at the new Ka Makana Ali'i shopping center.  Since I frequent Ka Makana Ali'i often, I have seen the Cheesecake Factory site being built upon ever since and they set it up pretty quickly.  In regards to location, you cannot really miss it really.  As soon as you enter the front entrance side of the mall, it is pretty much right there right across from the movies and California Pizza Kitchen.  Along with the new Cheesecake Factory restaurant, comes along a few more parking stalls surrounding the new restaurant.  It is safe to say that I think this restaurant in itself will probably make up for about 20 percent of the mall's drive I would say.   I came here on a Monday noon for lunch with Jollibae and there was a line full of people waiting to be seated.  It was about a half an hour wait which was not so bad compared to their famous hour to two hour waits.  The exterior and interior design of the restaurant is pretty much on point.  All the color themes and designs and everything is really nice.  They have a menu in front of the restaurant's entrance next to the doors if you want to quickly see a portion of their menu.  I am fascinated by their high ceilings.  Anyways, they have a bar near the entrance in which they have happy hour from Monday to Friday from 4pm-6pm.  Alongside with it, you get special rates on appetizers and pupus, all ranging from about 6-10 dollars.  They have an outside and of course inside area.  It's pretty cool how you get to see the kitchen area with their tall and wide window haha.   The staff were really courteous and nice.  We got seated in the inside and was served by our excellent waitress Cheyenne, she was really good and helped us out with questions and stuff.  Another waiter, Andrew, also commented our food selections and made recommendations of his own which was randomly surprisingly nice of him to do.  Anyways, for food, they give you free bread which is da bomb bread, especially the one with the darker bread with the oats.  I wonder where they get that bread.  We didn't get the appetizers but we did get the Chicken Marinara ($19.99) and I get the Skinnylicious chicken pasta ($14.95) from the Skinny low calorie menu (under 590 calories) which was really good.  The first few bites (which they will ask you) was very good and it just got better as we eat our food along the way.  Therefore, our food at the time was excellent.  It was pretty filling.  Cheyenne, checked on us many times with good service.  When it came down to dessert, I wanted to get a blueberry cheesecake (which is my favorite) but Cheyenne suggested the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which would be a possible alternative (since they do not have blueberry cheesecakes) and it was just lovely! So for you blueberry cheesecake lovers, get the raspberry one! You won't regret it! The cheesecakes range from 7 to 9 dollars depending on which flavors.  They have about 37 cheesecake flavors.  Overall, despite the wait, it totally makes up for it with excellent food and service at the new Cheesecake Factory.  We spent about an hour and a half at the restaurant so it made the wait seem like it was not so bad.  Looking forward to coming again more times!"
randy r.,"Waimalu, HI",480,11,5,2.0,12/5/2017,"Idk what the hype is...my omellete was swimming in cooking oil,poataoes overcooked and taste burnt,everyrhing is too greasy i hate it"
Frank I.,"Honolulu, HI",73,3,20,5.0,10/6/2017,"Finally, A Hawaii Cheesecake Factory with Free Parking!!! Last time I've dined at Cheesecake was years ago in Waikiki. Wanted to check this new location since it opened recently. As my first sentence mentions, the Kapolei location has ample parking since it's at the Ka Makana Ali'i Shopping Center (Kapolei Mall), which is one less thing to worry about, especially in Hawaii. I went during lunch time for an office function. Since this place has opened last month, there's still a line outside to get in (then again, every time I passed by the Waikiki location, there's a line so maybe that's a Cheesecake thing). They don't take reservations but they were able to accommodate our party of 19. Someone at the office went ahead & arrived at 11:30am to make sure they can accommodate us. I arrived at 12:00pm, we were seated at the outside lanai around 12:15pm when everyone in our party arrived. Wasn't able to dine inside, but the inside had that familiar Cheesecake tan/orange hue, complete with a full bar & a separate counter where you can order cheesecake which they are famously known for. Maybe next time I'll get to have that inside dining experience. Looking at the menu I noticed that they also have Hawaiian local entrees to cater to us locals, which I'm sure we appreciate. I included pictures of everyone else's dishes just to give you an idea of the variety of entrees you can choose from. It's been a while since I had a burger, so I ordered the Bacon-bacon cheeseburger. I was pleasantly surprised that it also came with 2-slices of pork belly on top of the generous amount of bacon. That pork belly elevated the flavor profile of the burger. In other words: it was really good! We had 2 waitresses & they did a fantastic job in attending to our needs, always refilling our drinks & checking on us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. & of course, a visit to the Cheesecake factory isn't complete without cheesecake. I ordered the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake to go. Overall, I had a great dining experience at this Cheesecake location. I highly recommend it, & I'm sure I'll be there again in the near future (to try out a new cheesecake flavor at least)."
Aimee H.,"Aiea, HI",500,277,3263,4.0,11/22/2017,"I came to this Kapolei location to meet a friend for lunch. We didn't have reservations and they were pretty full. We got there at 12:30 on a weekday and if we wanted a seat inside ,it would be a 15 minute wait. Luckily there were immediate seating available outside so we opted for outside seating! Our server sat us down and brought us some complimentary bread and butter. She took our drink orders and let us look over the menu. I had a pina colada ( sub vodka for rum, also known as a chichi), my friend had an ultimate margarita, and her mom had a tropical breeze!!! Every single one of these drinks were delicious!!! So delicious we had 2 each lol. As we looked over the menu, we decided on steak Dianne with shrimp scampi!! Yes, all three of us ordered the same dish!! I ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked perfect! Meat was tender and sauce was delicious! The shrimp scampi came with large shrimp ( looked like 16-20 size)!! They were bigger than I expected which was a pleasant surprise!!! I like be it when you bite into a piece of shrimp and you can actually taste the shrimp, not just the batter or a tease of shrimp!! The scampi sauce that came with this was a little different but I'm a good way! It was sooo good!!! It came with mashed potatoes which was delicious as well. Since this was my first time, not just at this location, but to any Cheesecake Factory, I must say.... I was very pleased!!! Parking- plentiful Food- delicious Drinks- delicious Service- great and I left full and very satisfied!!! What more could you ask for!!! I'm definitely coming back!!"
Christie S.,"Kapolei, HI",72,207,222,4.0,9/26/2017,"I loved The Cheesecake Factory in the mainland and frequented the Macy's Union Square restaurant in San Francisco and the Palo Alto one by Stanford University, so I was thrilled to see one open up at Ka Makana Ali'i!  Had the honor of being one of the lucky guests who got to attend the Pre-Grand Opening training with my friend who works at Au Lani.  The decor was reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Union Square San Francisco and Palo Alto near Stanford University campus.  There was a pre-fix menu for the Pre-Grand Openings so I ordered my favorites: -Avocado Rolls -Burger and fries  -Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake The Ka Makana Ali'i restaurant had the same menu as the ones in the mainland including my favorite Skinny / low fat menu, and the White Chocolate raspberry & macadamia nut cheesecakes.  There are also items on the menu exclusive to the Ka Makana Ali'i Cheesecake Factory menu that you can't find anywhere else.  Service was a bit splotchy and the waitress and waiter mixed up a few orders, but that's OK - it was still their pre-grand opening training and they were refining their restaurant flow. Because this is a brand new spot in West Oahu, expect long lines. Your best bet is to come before 6 pm.  It's a great place to bring your family, have a work lunch / dinner for West Oahu workers, or to hang out with friends. It's also a great place for pre/post movie date nights. Can't wait to make The Cheesecake Factory at Ka Makana Ali'i my regular dining spot when I am craving yummy cheesecake or their Skinny menu options."
Brad B.,"Wahiawa, HI",5,64,27,2.0,9/26/2017,"Went opening night for what we hoped would be a nice dinner out but knew that most likely it would be a dessert to go kind of visit. We arrive at roughly 4:30pm, stand in line to get on the list for 20 minutes only to discover the wait for 3 people is at 75 to 90 minutes. Decided to get desserts only and headed to that line. Wait another 20 minutes to place our order for 1 piece of cheesecake, 1 piece of chocolate tower cake, and 1 piece of fudge cake. The staff were clearly overwhelmed and honestly looked like they would prefer to have not worked that night. Not to mention there were a ton of them in the tiny dessert station area. After we ordered our dessert two of us decided to leave the area as it was getting more and more crowded while 1 stayed behind to get the food. As the two of us were leaving we heard an employee telling people the wait for dessert to go orders was at 20 minutes and growing.....would have been nice to know this before hand.  It is interesting that Cheesecake Factory dessert bar not only serves the to go orders but also the entire restaurant too......seems like a design flaw especially in high tourist location of Hawaii in which the restaurant has a wait time most of the time. We enjoyed our 5 Guys Burgers and Fries before heading home and waiting for our dinner to digest before digging into the dessert. Saw quite a few C.F. employees at 5 Guys too for a smoke break and quick bite to eat. I personally like Cheesecake Factory and approx 1 month ago waited 2 hours for a party of 10 to be seated for dinner. As frustrated as I was waiting the food definitely was worth the wait. Same in this case as frustrating as it was waiting in line to check in, then waiting in line to order dessert, then waiting to get the dessert all three items were on point and definitely worth it all."
Gabriel A.,"Waianae, HI",91,8,13,5.0,9/16/2017,"Was Honored and Blessed with being invited to the preview lunch before the grand opening on Tuesday.  Visit: Friday Sept.15,2017  Time: 11:30 Decor/Design: The architecture inside and outside is very unique for the West side of oahu. We got seated on a table inside by the windows facing the mountains. The seats that we were sitting in was comfortable and mind you six Polynesian were on this table and we felt comfortable. It had a really nice color and vibe In the restaurant. Bathrooms are really nice as well, and the music was just at the right volume. (By the way that playlist was awesome lol) Service: (It was getting busy when we got in) Our Hostest Tyra was really nice excited to see us. That made us feel very excited to be there (Your really need that kind of people up front being nice and excited about what they do.) When we got to our seats we were immediately greeted by our Waitress Jacqueline. She explained the menu and the drinks that they had. We ordered our drinks and 1 minute later she's back with the drinks. Our appetizer came our 5 minutes later and they were really attentive to when we finished it. Once they seen our plate was empty our entree's came right after. It got really busy in the dining room but Jacqueline always made sure that our drinks were full and we were okay.  Staff: Really young, Vibrant, and Excited!! They were all really good. Food: The appitizer was the Ahi Carpaccio and it was delicious. Think of a Flat Ahi poke with sauce and vegetables.  For my entree I had the Honey Truffle chicken with Mashed potatoes and asparagus which I highly recommend, The chicken was very moist and well season and the mashed potatoes were sweet and creamy. I also liked the pasta that my friend ordered, the sauce was just right for the pasta. The steak that my Other friend had was really good. Like melt in your mouth good.  For dessert we had three cheesecakes, the red velvet cheesecake, the celebration cheesecake, and the Smores cheesecake. All of them were good. But out of the three, the red velvet cheesecake was my favorite nice and creamy.  Overall: I loved my experience at the cheesecake factory. It was my first time ever going to one. And certainly will not be my last. Finally we are getting a good restaurant on our side of the island."
Joah Ana H.,"Ewa Beach, HI",61,57,136,4.0,10/10/2017,"who doesn't love cheesecake! we went here for the dessert, but was too full have to have..lol! but we've had the cheesecakes before and they are BOMB delicious! we went during the week day hoping it would be a little slower, we were wrong. they we already busy by 5:30pm! since it was just my husband and i, we only waited 20 minutes. we love the decor and ambience of this place. our waitress was great and friendly. would've given five stars, but she brought the wrong drink and we waited for a long time before we got water refills. i could've told her it was wrong, but it okay. drinks - pineapple mojito (asked for cucumber mojito) appetizer - avocado eggroll                       crab and artichoke dip with bread entree - bang bang chicken and shrimp                  ribeye steak everything was delicious!! my husband said this was the first time someone cooked his steak how he wanted and it was perfect!"
Rhenalyn V.,"Waipahu, HI",289,77,222,5.0,9/18/2017,"We were one of the many lucky guests to attend their soft-opening, thanks to my boyfriend's cousin who was one of the trainers for kitchen staff. Perfect because we were celebrating a birthday as well (yes, they sing happy birthday). This dinner was for training purposes & they did so well. We were so full by the end of the night & we even had a handful of bags filled with left overs. Our waitress (Vanessa) & her trainer (Joe) were very good to us. They explained everything to us in detail and provided us with great customer service.  We came as a big party so we were seated outside in the same section but with four separate tables. We were asked to treat it like we were four separate parties (for training). We were all given a different section of the menu to allow the cooks to ""familiarize themselves with the flow in the kitchen"" as we were told. The food came in very generous amounts, by the time we got to our entree's we were so full! We got pasta & a salad TO SHARE but we barely even got to touch it. The appetizer they suggested has to be my favorite dish of the night, buffalo blasts; never tried anything like it anywhere else! lol Now for the CHEESECAKE, because cheesecake factory duh. We had the chance to try about 5 different kinds because we passed it around amongst ourselves LOL. Soooo good. I liked the Celebration and Red Velvet the most.  All in all, we're excited for this location. Its a nice change from the super busy location in Waikiki."
Alyssa A.,"Mililani, HI",2,43,61,5.0,10/9/2017,"Usually when places are new it's not that great but, I had a really good experience at this new location. They open at 11:30 but people are waiting in line way before that. We got there 10 minutes before opening and the line was around the corner. Although the line was long the wait went by really fast. Our waitress was great....she kept refilling drinks and checking on our table. Although it was busy, we didn't wait long at all for our food to come and it all tasted delicious. I'll definitely be back here soon."
Katherine N.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",90,60,609,5.0,9/29/2017,"Decided to try the Cheesecake Factory because everything else was closed at 10pm. I WOULD go to the Cheesecake Factory for every meal if I could, but it's definitely on the pricier side. Nonetheless, I was super hungry and I caved in. RIP wallet. It's okay though, was worth it.  PARKING: This new location is located in the new mall at Kapolei, so there's a TON of free parking. Yup, definitely don't have to worry about parking here (as opposed to the Waikiki location lol). SERVICE: We came around 10pm so there was no wait! Got seated right away :) Service was awesome! Jacob (I think that was his name?) was our server and he was very friendly and attentive! Brought our drinks and food out at a reasonable time. Asked if we were doing okay and if we needed anything else. Didn't have to go looking for him at any point in time.  FOOD: For drinks, my bf ordered the Sam Adams and I got the Red Sangria. The Sangria was yummy!! However, they put way too much ice and too little sangria lol! For food, I got the shrimp scampi and steak combo with angel hair pasta. My bf got the fish tacos. As you would expect, food is to die for! Steak was cooked perfectly and had these mushrooms on top that I wanted more of. (Actually ordered more mushrooms as a side). The fish tacos was the best I ever had and I tried a lot of fish tacos from different restaurants. We were stuffed, but when you're at the Cheesecake Factory, you HAVE to order Cheesecake. Unfortunately, since it was the end of the night, they were out of a lot of cheesecakes :( We opted to get the cookie dough cheesecake. That was alright, kinda was looking forward to trying that new celebration cheesecake they had.  Overall, everything was awesome! Would definitely come back again for a special occasion (or if I wanna break my bank account again haha)."
Phoebe F.,"Waipahu, HI",63,82,309,5.0,10/6/2017,"Five stars because the food is awesome like always. So much to choose from between appetizers, pastas, specialties, burgers, and more. But of course the cheesecake is the best and the real reason we come here! We got the red velvet and specialty pumpkin cheesecake mmmmm so good! Rest experience because there was no wait when we went however I know many days there is a long line to take out cheesecake and to wait to be seated so we were lucky. They also don't rsvp so on a crowded day you'll spend a good 45+ min waiting for a table. All the food we got was delicious and our server was really friendly and attentive, we'll back on a slow night!"
