William G.,"PA, PA",317,42,65,5.0,12/22/2017,This place has never let me down! The portions are always great and the food is packed with flavor. My go-to dish is the bang-bang chicken and shrimp but this time I got the Thai chicken special and it did not dissapoint. :-) pretty much anything you get here is gonna live up to the hype.  On top of having an awesome dinner you can always top it off with one of the signature cheesecakes. No matter what you choose it will leave you wanting more.  Definitely come here and treat yo self to a meal. :-)
Andre B.,"Downingtown, PA",32,72,29,1.0,12/12/2017,"Had a bad visit to the Cheesecake Factory in KOP back in October.  In short, the service was horrendous and took forever (for myself and my son), and the meal came out cold.  This was the 3rd experience like that, so I took a review and provided that feedback.  About a week later I received an email from the manager asking about the experience, and offering a gift card to make up for it.  He said it would be coming via email 1 week later.  Fast forward a month after and I remembered that I never got anything.  I wrote back to Ryan and Scott the managers, and got no response at all.  I followed up a second time and again, nothing.   I live local and used to go a lot because the kids always enjoyed it, but the service is horrible all the way up to management.  Go give your business to a company that actually values its customers!"
Steven D.,"Alhambra, CA",44,4,2,2.0,12/6/2017,"Management: please tell the hostess with the tattoo behind her ear that she needs to treat all her guests equally regardless of race. You don't tell your guest ""You 2 follow me"". 12/5 around 7 pm.  Visiting King of Prussia for the first time. My fiancé and I go to Cheese Cake Factory in almost every city we visit. Reason being is 1- Hospitality and 2- We trust the food and know what we like on the menu. There were a few people in line ahead of us. I told my fiancé good start... the hostess seems nice.  She greeted the couple in front of us pleasantly with good evening and how are you. When it was our turn, her whole attitude changed and said with a condescending tone ""you 2 follow me"".  I was going to walk out but we got to our table and the waiter came with a big smile. The waiter was a really nice guy and turned the evening around for us. We tried some new dishes that he recommended and loved it. Despite all the waiters efforts and good food, we will always remember the hostess who was condescending and rude. She shouldn't have a job in the service industry!!! Management needs to put the right people in the hostess position!! I give this place 2 stars because hospitality is very important to us."
Brian P.,"Philadelphia, PA",30,124,328,2.0,10/28/2017,"The manager was great for seating 20 of us during the Saturday night rush. Our server was as good as he could have been given the circumstances of a packed restaurant. Friendly, prompt, and a great memory. I'll still never understand restaurants that don't take reservations. But that's not part of my review. Just a rant. The issue with this restaurant is the back of the house, not the front. The Beet and Goat Cheese salad was tasty. I liked it a lot. Thought the dressing a tad too sweet, however. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and subbed broccoli for the mash and asparagus. Let's start with the fact that I was deep inside the large booth. So I took the plate from the server so he didn't need to reach. The bottom of the plate was filthy (I don't want to think what was under my food). The food cold and tasteless. And the entrées for our two booths came out at completely separate times over 15 minutes. We had three tables and three checks, two different servers. I would have expected each individual table to be served at the same time. Not over 15 minutes start to finish. I get it. Large short order restaurant at a mall. Menu way too large for any potential efficiency. Get as many people in and out of the restaurant as quickly as possible to boost head count and revenue. Here's a thought... Serve 75% of the head count properly with a slimmer menu and great quality to protect your brand and increase your per capita. Or have the back of the house serve everyone that comes coldly with poor quality and boost your short term revenue killing your brand. I know what Cheesecake Factory chose. My first experience with Cheesecake Factory was over 20 years ago in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore and great experiences. Since they've opened a few in the Philly area, I was a promoter. My last few visits to King of Prussia and Willow Grove leave me avoiding altogether. The only reason I was here was because someone hosted a birthday dinner. I won't be back unless there's another occasion planned by someone else."
Richard A.,"Branford, CT",11,202,354,5.0,12/23/2017,"Fresh Vegetable Salad, Skinnylicious . It had asparagus, green beans,tomatoes, cucumbers, roasted beets, apple, edamame, radicchio, romaine and white cheddar, all chopped.  The difference between the regular and Skinnylicious is the dressing   I love this salad and the skinny dressing is good.  Plus I love the dark bread. This is a good healthy salad"
Hannah D.,"Philadelphia, PA",159,230,582,4.0,9/16/2017,"We came here on Fri for their happy hour and had a great time.  We sat in the bar area on high tops.  It's self seating and luckily at 6pm there was no wait.  The happy hour is 4-6pm Mon- Fridays. It's 5.99 per appetizers.  They are full size portions which makes it a good value.  My favorite is the chicken buffalo blasts, Tex mex egg rolls.  The curry cauliflower is also soo yummie.  Very interesting flavors and dipping sauce is two thumbs up.  The burger on happy hour is a double patty and cooked very nicely- juicy. The drinks are also discounted.  Mojito is my absolute favorite.  So light and fresh. The service is on point as usual.  Would definitely come back again."
Bill B.,"Broomall, PA",10,314,186,3.0,10/11/2017,I have never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory.  I will say that the cheesecake is excellent. As it should be from the name. The portions are nice and there are many flavors and varieties. A tad expensive but totally worth it.  The restaurant is usually pretty clean as well so that is a plus for places that are so crowded.  The wait is routinely 1 hour plus.  In my opinion not worth it.  The food is marginal at best. How can it be better when the menu is so huge. That usually means that nothing can be made From scratch.  I find the prices high and the food salty.
Kelly P.,"Birdsboro, PA",0,6,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Very disappointing meal after a wait of an hour- I want to start by saying how rude the manager was when being approached by us- he didn't introduce himself and basically gave no feedback or resolution to our problem (even when I said then we will not choose to dine here then) My fiancé was super polite and just spoke about how misleading the menu is -  We had a $70 check plus $25 at the bar when we waited -  we ordered the steak and shrimp scampi platter- for $22, the portion was extremely small and we were on the road all day.  (3 shrimp and 3 tiny pieces of steak- bite size) There are no descriptions of the meal on the menu- for that portion and price , we will be choosing another destination to eat and deserve what we pay for.  Very upset by tonight's choice in meal and our response from a manager that is supposed to put customers first and ensure the happiness of a customer-"
Caroline P.,"Philadelphia, PA",203,20,28,4.0,10/4/2017,"Had a great meal here tonight with my best friend. Our meal: Complimentary WARM bread: amazing, I love the dark brown bread which tastes like pumpernickel, it's served with a sweet butter. Arnold palmers: my go to drink which I order almost every time I'm out and let me tell you theirs is down to a science. The rim is lined with sugar and has the perfect consistency of half unsweetened tea and lemonade. Seriously my all time favorite. Passion fruit mojitos: order these. Served in a tall glass, on your first sip it really tastes like passion fruit nectar, rum, lime, and mint-- which is my kind of mojito. I loved the tall sprig of mint in it. Red sangria: this tasted like a true sangria. Nice red wine with hints of brandy. Apples and oranges which tasted like they had been soaking all day. Spinach and artichoke dip: served nice and warm and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. I just wish they served the dip with pita bread instead of chips  Roadside sliders- another all time favorite. I usually order these as a meal with a side of sweet potato fries but on this occasion, we ordered to split. The sliders taste like old school drive-in burgers [similar to Charlie's in Delco :) ]  4 mini burgers in total which are served with ketchup, diced onion, lettuce, and pickle. They are simply delicious and I suggest ordering them with cheese :) Bistro Shrimp Pasta- Delicious as well. Fried shrimp tossed with spaghetti and arugula in what tasted like a creamy garlic-pesto sauce. I only wished that the there was a bit more sauce to the pasta. We also ordered 3 cheesecakes: The original with 3 large glazed strawberries- a classic White chocolate raspberry- my ultimate favorite Toasted marshmallow s'mores: my friend ordered and it was to die for. All in all, a great meal. For what we paid, our waitress seemed a bit to eager for us to be done our meal and I wish it didn't take as long for our drinks and appetizers to be served, because shortly  after, our meals arrived. The drinks and meals are a bit pricey but the justification in my opinion is they are larger than most and I love taking home left overs :)"
Harry B.,"King of Prussia, PA",20,95,193,3.0,6/12/2017,This is an update. Still fun. Still packed  However  Finishes are getting old and worn. Tables are chipped and pealing. The marble is rough. The bathrooms (men's at least) smell like bus stops.  Walls in the dining area are filthy and need attention.  Overhaul time.
Emily C.,"Lansdale, PA",29,62,62,4.0,11/27/2017,"My partner and i ordered rasberry lemonade&coke, fried calamari as an appetizer, chicken parmesan pizza style and pork chop. Portion of the chicken parmesan pizza style was so huge. I couldn't finish. It was good, i wish i didnt order appetizer, then i prob could have eaten all of my entre. Service was nice as well"
Dhanashree B.,"Philadelphia, PA",29,71,42,3.0,9/28/2017,The most over crowded place. The plates are Uncleaned and has lot of stains on it. Secondly the place is so very busy that we don't get proper service. I would highly recommend this place for the person who loves desserts as they have exclusive variety of cakes  The food served is also delicious but the tables are placed so closer that we feel the people on table next to me are also sitting with me  Occasionally this place is good to visit.
Marianna C.,"Plymouth Meeting, PA",20,135,84,3.0,8/18/2017,"Okay. Overall I love their cheesecake and every once in a while I BEG my fiance' to come here basically because I want that brown wheat bread they give you and I want a piece of cheesecake.  So we went last weekend.  Luckily, being a party of 2 the wait on a Saturday night was only 30 minutes but be aware to potentially wait well over an hour for a table, especially if you're a bigger party. Usually, I don't have any complaints. The food is just average and I always order off the skinnylicious menu because seriously all of their food is WAY too many calories (good luck finding items on the normal menu under 1000 cals) and if you want cheesecake with that, it's just too much for me.   But this last time our waitress was terrible.  She didn't come to check on us at ALL and she got my order wrong.  I ordered the skinnylicious chicken tacos and I got some kind of fish tacos with rice and beans.  The problem is, after we got our food, we couldn't find her or anyone that wasn't running around for that matter, so I ended up just eating it because I was starving.  She also didn't give us any refills on our drinks which was annoying, especially because I literally got water so I don't think I was costing them much.  I hope they're more attentive next time!"
Janelle B.,"Glenside, PA",119,74,41,4.0,3/4/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is usually a no fail for me when I can't decide what I'm in the mood for. They have a huge menu with a wide variety of food, so you can always find something that fits your cravings.  This location in King of Prussia is conveniently attached to the mall, so it is easy to take a break from shopping and grab a bite to eat. Their lunch menu is served until 5:00pm which is nice because you can grab an early dinner and get the lunch specials, which are a lot cheaper than the dinner menu.  I came here with my sister on her last visit in the area. We had been shopping and decided to grab an early dinner at about 4:00pm. The restaurant was quiet at this time and we were seated right away. We both got the lunch salmon specials. She got the fresh grilled salmon and I got the herb crusted filet of salmon. They were both delicious and left us feeling stuffed, but of course not too stuffed to pass up a piece of cheesecake.  I've never had a bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory and commend them on their consistency from location to location."
Larry C.,"Valley Stream, NY",179,176,9,2.0,8/7/2017,"I feel that I'm being rather generous giving a 2-star rating since most of my dinner experience wasn't 100% awful. Just to quickly go through the good parts of my dinner here: the waiter was nice and checked on us frequently enough, the salmon salad was decent, and the hot spinach dip was exactly what you might expect of a spinach cheese dip.  All rather good things. The highlight however is how bad the Cajun Jambalaya pasta came out.  If you're unfamiliar with the dish, it is a linguine served with chicken and shrimp in cajun seasoning.  The chicken and shrimp were solid; no complaints at all.   Now now, I've had cajun seasoning on food before but under no circumstances have I ever had anything taste as salty as the pasta did.  Have you ever gargled salt water to help treat a sore throat? Now imagine pasta tasting even saltier than that salt water rinsing around your mouth.  I couldn't believe how that could even happen and I really couldn't convince myself not to waste the food.  I'm the type of person that will eat everything I order pretty much as long as it doesn't touch the floor.  This linguine was the first thing I've ever been incapable of stomaching beyond the first bite. Recommendation: Do not get the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta"
Warren C.,"Gardena, CA",458,1141,123,4.0,8/12/2017,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years, but not a whole lot as changed. Big oversized menu with big oversized portions served on big oversized plates. Food was decent here though. Iced tea (unsweetened) was better than expected. Service was friendly, but not all that fast."
Jeszel B.,"Springfield, PA",0,9,2,4.0,10/1/2017,"I've been here countless of times before. And each time i visit, it's always AMAZING. But let's just discuss why I only gave it 4stars. The spring roll that we had was aL LITTLE undercooked. Coming from an Asian family, I like my spring rolls fully cooked and crispy. The second reason was that when we received our order, the meals were warm/room temperature. I feel like they didn't put it under a food warmer while it was waiting to be picked up by a server. So that was basically it, plus, we went there on a Saturday night, so it was PACKED!! Expect to have a line waiting and be on the waiting list for at least 45 minutes. APPETIZERS:  -Cheese Burger spring rolls: i have never in my life thought about putting a cheeseburger mix/flavor in a spring roll before, and that was INCREDIBLY genius and so delicious -Buffalo Blast- a MUST have when you come to Cheesecake Factory. The flavor is just amazinnng, definitely not a fan of bleu cheese though, just absolutely not my kind of cheese.  Main Course: Boyfriend had the Louisiana chicken pasta, who said ""the chicken melts in my mouth"" and claimed that it was one of the best meals he ever had. I tried it myself and it was pretty awesome! The chicken was so crispy and definitely just melts in your mouth. It wasn't too thick or too thin either. The pasta itself was cooked wonderfully. The flavors exploded in your mouth! So many spices in this dish! I had the Chicken Bellagio, which was superb! I'm a pretty petite woman, so my food portion sizes are small. The meal was HUGE. Literally bigger than my torso. And it was the best pasta and chicken I've ever had. The chicken was amazing, it melted in my mouth also. Was kind of disappointed that the server didn't come back and offer to put cheese on our course, because from the last time we were there, they always came back to offer cheese. But anyways, pasta was perfectly cooked. Again, the food was warm-ish, closer to being room temperature, so that was a downside. The prosciutto was amazing, as always. Would definitely recommend this dish to anyone!"
Art V.,"South Bend, IN",0,3,,2.0,12/30/2017,"I am a returning customer to the Cheesecake Factory. I had a bad visit this time. I usually visit this restaurant with family, friends and/or business associates. So my average bill is no less than $100. On this visit I ordered Fettucini Alfredo which was tasteless. Also, I was never offered Parmesan cheese unless I asked for it. It's normal for bread and butter to start the service as you are seated but this never happened even after I asked for it and noticed the tables around me getting the bread basket with butter. My server kept telling me that he was waiting for it to get out of the oven. Furthermore, I ordered coffee which was served lukewarm and I never received a refill through the dessert. Believe me, I asked for one too. I am not sure what happened this time. I am very disappointed with my experience this time."
Jen H.,"Schwenksville, PA",6,153,359,1.0,1/16/2017,"Excellent service today as we arrive quite early, around 11:30 AM.  I've never had poor service. The entree I had was quite enjoyable, so what happened? Normally I always order the luscious stuffed chicken tortillas but today I went with the herb crusted salmon. It was perfectly cooked and seated in a well put together lemony butter sauce. This meal came with mashed potatoes and about some asparagus that was also cooked perfectly. I was disappointed in the size of the cheesecake. My piece was very narrow and small. There's nothing more upsetting than when restaurants start short portioning and raising prices. I ordered a piece of cheesecake to go. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for my daughter which was around 8$ and change. It was extremely small and broken in half though I handled it with utmost care. Very disappointed because this is a very expensive dessert. A lousy impression of the restaurant to take with me. I have always enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory and this experience puts a damper on me wanting to return. The food quality is there but I don't appreciate the short portioning of the cheesecake dessert, & the increasing prices. Short portioning & raising prices is a guarantee to lose my business."
Patrick C.,"Syracuse, NY",1,91,16,2.0,12/18/2017,If you take out make sure you get order right in the phone otherwise you get an attitude from the girl at the counter. Bad enough it took four times to correct her on the phone about the order and she still forgot one order. Then she charged the wrong amount and had to bring in the manager to fix it...without apologizing for her incompetence. Food was good otherwise (that's my 2 stars).
Julia M.,"Philadelphia, PA",352,86,41,5.0,10/19/2017,Always get the factory nachos. They are covered in cheesy goodness and would easily be enough for two people to share and then get dessert. I've also had their white bean soup in the past that I have enjoyed. It's on the lighter side but still has a nice flavor.
Diana H.,"Lansdale, PA",133,54,41,4.0,5/26/2017,"I was in here earlier this week with my 4 year old son for a late lunch/early dinner. The atmosphere is nice, as well as the presentation of food. The menu is extensive! I felt like I could've spent an hour reading it all haha I particularly liked that the kids menu had quite a few choices, including salmon and veggies. However, my son opted for pizza that day and devoured it! He was on a carb kick that day for sure because he also enjoyed the bread. He's usually quite the salmon connoisseur.  I had the snack plate of chicken taquitos, which were delicious, and a side Caesar salad that I enjoyed as well.  The reason I took a star off is because our server rarely came to the table. I wasn't offered a refill until I requested the check. After reading through the other reviews for this location that seems pretty common and is something management should consider addressing. We will return!"
Angela L.,"Merion Station, PA",273,66,236,5.0,6/18/2017,"Absolutely amazing food and service! Our server, Kortnie, was friendly, and so enthusiastic. She made the dining experience truly exceptional. The food was super enjoyable. I recommend the Vietnamese summer rolls, and Tuscan chicken dish! You won't regret coming to this specific Cheesecake Factory location"
Mayt G.,"Pottstown, PA",29,78,12,4.0,9/29/2017,"This location is always solid. Amazing food, huge portions, and of course delicious dessert. If you go, get either the gumbo OR the bang bang chicken and shrimp. They are two amazing dishes that are packed with flavor. The avocado rolls or the factory nachos are amazing for appetizers. Don't discount the avocado rolls. Try them! They have a crunch to them but are so soft and creamy inside. The dip is also fantastic. Now the cons: weekends can see waits of anywhere between 45minutes to over an hour at times. Call first!! Depending on where you sit, it can be very loud! Get a booth if possible. The tables feel like you are sitting on the next person's lap. Also, it is easier to hear your guests in a booth. The bar area? Forget it if you want to talk and hear someone. The lighting at night is abysmal. Bring a flashlight to see the menu and your food. Maybe it was the day we went but it was practically black inside. You should still try it at least once. Go hungry, eat up, and take a slice of cheesecake to go!!"
Kyrsten R H.,"Wildwood, NJ",0,8,1,1.0,12/29/2017,"I arrived put my name in for a party of 2. They told me the wait would be 40 minutes which was fine. They said they were out of pagers and would print out my receipt showing that my name was in. They told me to come back within 20 minutes for a pager to wait, which was fine. I walked back to the front gave my receipt, they told me they already paged me and skipped. I was upset but not distraught. What really ruined my night was being sat and having another server kick me out of my seat !!!!! She said, "" this isn't your seat, are you supposed to be here? I'm going to ask you to leave and have a good night!"" As if I didn't wait in line like everybody else. I was very offended and felt like I wasn't welcomed. I was embarrassed along with very upset as I was kicked out of my planned dinner. Everyone around our seat saw how offensive this action was. I went to the front and explained and they wanted to sit me next to the same people with the same server after we went through this embarrassment. I was very disappointed with the management and staff of King of Prussia's Cheesecake Factory and will not be returning, due to the fact no one resolved this issue and I ended up leaving very unhappy as hungry!"
Andrea A.,"Philadelphia, PA",420,129,242,4.0,11/20/2016,Packed on a Friday afternoon so we snagged a high top at the bar.  Clam chowder was surprisingly excellent. So many clams. The creamy broth isn't too thick so it's really a perfect soup that doesn't leave you hating yourself if you're going to try on clothes after.  The chicken buffalo blasts are addictive. The wonton tastes like crispy fried skin.  Avocado toast was a letdown. Unsalted and overly chunky avocado. Sad.  Key lime pie cheesecake is exactly what you think when you image the two dessert combined into one. I wish it had more graham cracker crust but overall tasty!
Sal I.,"Mont Clare, PA",54,153,24,4.0,8/29/2017,"Love this place! Always packed. Wait times are usually on the higher side. The food is incredible. Shawn was our server. He was great! Quick, Fast and friendly.  We come here pretty often. Always trying new cheesecakes. Only disappointing thing was, I got a cheesecake to go and it was the wrong one. Still tasted good, but I would have loved to had the one I ordered."
Heraldo L.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",8,28,3,4.0,10/18/2017,"Let me just say the server we had made the experience worth while. Always made us laugh, and offered us excellent advise on food choices. I would definitely come back to this location when I'm in the area.  Service 5/5 Food 4/5 Atmosphere 4/5"
Ashley S.,"Lancaster, PA",0,20,6,5.0,11/5/2017,Did a car side to go pick up order was correct and ready by the time I got there I was told 20 minutes arrived in 24
David H.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,8,,3.0,8/25/2017,"Kinda bummed about this experience. Service: the service was great, our server couldn't have been better. Unfortunately she doesn't have a kitchen to back her up. Food: my girlfriends pasta was great. But I ordered a burger and it came out not only EXTREMELY salty but way undercooked. They explained it was a new menu item but it was one of the worst burgers I have ever had ...I ate about two bites and realized that it was undercooked and couldn't eat anymore.  The cheesecake was awesome.  They did a good job at correcting the situation, seriously our server was AWESOME, she comped our desert, which was really nice.  My only qualm was that they didn't take the burger off the check... that would have been nice. I probably won't be back, as I can get better food elsewhere without the hassle."
Kate M.,"Wyncote, PA",69,9,5,2.0,8/24/2017,"I've been to this location twice on my lunch hour in the last month. The first time, I was with a group of 4 coworkers, the second time I was with one coworker. The good: Both times we were sat immediately The food was good  The server greeted us immediately The not so good: Both times, once the drinks delivered, and the food ordered, the server completely disappeared and was not seen for almost an hour. Today's lunch, my co worker and I both ordered salads. After 50 minutes of waiting, the server ran by and we stopped them and said ""excuse us, just checking to see if food coming anytime soon, our lunch hour is almost over"". The server said he'd go check and immediately came back with our salads. The impression was very clearly that they had been sitting back their and the server had just forgotton about us. I'm a fan of this restaurant change but unfortunately will be unable to return to this location. I get only an hour for lunch and when the food doesn't come for 55+ minutes, it's impossible to enjoy my dining experience"
Kevin M.,"Parkesburg, PA",7,34,2,4.0,11/12/2017,"Extremely crowded and busy place on Saturday night in November. But the staff did a great job of getting people sat. Overall we probably waited 45 minutes to get sat and we got there at 5:30. We originally planned to sit at the bar first anyway for a drink or two, so the wait was ok for us.  The only real annoying part of the night was the bar itself. There was a single mother with 4 kids sitting at the bar eating dinner. I actually looked into this, as I thought it was illegal for kids to sit at the bar. It's not illegal as long as they are with a adult, which they were so I really had nothing to bitch about as far as the company side of things. But just thought it was rude to the adults and the bartenders working that 4 of their 12 seats were being used up by non tipping customers.  lol I'm reaching here I'm sure but, otherwise the place gets 5. Food was awesome, waiter was great and we really enjoyed our trip to the KOP mall."
Matt S.,"Plymouth Meeting, PA",46,361,17,2.0,3/7/2017,"I can't recall how long this Cheesecake Factory has been at this location, but it's a testament to the food that the lines are still so long.  There is always a wait, but everyone is aware of that.  We usually can't eat an entire meal and enjoy dessert, so we come here quite often for just cheesecake to go.  Over the past few months, the line has been increasingly longer for the cheesecake, but it's always been worth it.   This past Saturday the line was extra long and wasn't really moving at all.  Someone told me that they moved six inches in fifteen minutes.  An argument broke out between an entitled woman and people in the line.  It was chaotic and slow.  We've easily eaten over fifty cheesecake slices from this place and 2017 hasn't been their best at service.  Hopefully they get it right soon.  Maybe it's just that it's cold outside and more people are there...  I've experienced plenty of long lines, but they usually move product.  Hopefully next time we go, it'll be faster...  It took us over a half hour to order and get our food.  Possibly closer to forty minutes."
Lauren M.,"Brookhaven, PA",19,127,176,5.0,7/13/2017,"We have been coming here for years and honestly, there's only been one time where we ordered guac and it was unpleasantly salty. Other than that, I've never had a bad meal! The portions are huge. The flavor is always on point. Everything is delicious, always! Don't even get me started on the Cheesecake!!!! Mmmmmm! We usually take it to go. Their green tea is very good! They have my favorite Riesling! Some recommendations: nachos, sweet corn tamale cakes, avocado eggrolls, Louisiana chicken pasta, skinnylicious chicken tacos, burrito, salmon. All delish!  The service is hit or miss. There is a range from excellent and attentive servers to awkward and just ok servers. This is going to happen anywhere. There is always a presence of management. Always.  The downside: It is always ridiculously crowded and they do not accept reservations which is annoying. We have waited up to 2.5 hours to dine here. We expect this on a Saturday so we go knowing it will be that long and we plan to walk around the mall. This is where my biggest frustration is. They used to have a system where they would text when your table was ready which was great because we could walk all the way to the opposite side of the mall and spend our time wisely... shopping! Working up an appetite! They went back to the nasty, germ infested buzzers that don't allow you to go past DSW. I don't appreciate being held captive or else risk losing my table. I also find it disrespectful that there is not adequate seating for a 2.5 hour wait so people are sitting and laying on the floor like dogs. So you have to wait in a confined area for 2+ hours but there's nowhere for that volume of people to wait. It makes no sense. For me, this system needs to be improved.  The one other con is they need to pump up the air, even in the winter. It gets SO crowded in there that when you walk in it is super hot and there's a cacophony of smells. It feels like I'm in a Petri dish. It makes me nauseous.  Overall, we love it here! I'm surprised their rating isn't higher."
Shantel B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,43,49,4.0,12/27/2017,"Went here to meet a friend for lunch and exchange gifts. We were greeted by a friendly staff member and seated right away upon entering the restaurant from the mall. After placing drink orders and looking over the menu, our waitress kindly answered a few of our questions and offered a few personal opinions upon request before we ordered. Now since my friend and I are lovers of food we ended up ordering a handful of appitizers to share so we would have the chance to try more of the items on the menu. The fried chicken sliders were amazing, especially with a side of their chipotle mayo...the egg roll sampler was good, definitely interesting flavor combos...the calamari was amazing...but the nachos were average, the chips tasted stale and came out soggy from the toppings. For entrees we ordered the Americana cheeseburger and the pasta carbonara which we again shared. The burger was very good, cooked a perfect medium as ordered, juicy and the special sauce was great...while the carbonara was good but the pasta ended up being slightly over cooked. All in all a great meal with really good service and the cheesecake we ordered to go was to die for as well!"
Elle P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,3,1.0,7/10/2017,"This is probably my least favorite restaurant in the KOP area. Don't get me wrong. I always like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt if a experience there has been poor. But this restaurant is pretty good with being consistent with poor service and mediocre food.  After my experience here, this will be my last. The server was never attentive. Amongst the many things I told my server, I asked for her to give me utensils so that I can actually eat my meal... which took 15 minutes for me to get her attention. It was a normal paced Sunday night so I was pretty irritated because I was just starving.  One thing that ticked me off - which contributes to the low rating was when my entree did come out - was when the food runner looked at my eyes and said that my steak was rare. I ordered it medium rare, but I specially asked my server to make sure it was on the rare side than medium well. When I finally got my utensils to eat, I cut into the steak to find that it was far from rare. Cooked all the way. It was pretty tough to cut into... I didn't even bother taking a bite. Not sure if it's my fault to order a steak at Cheesecake Factory... I didn't expect it to be like butcher and singers. All I wanted was attentive service and decent food."
Jennifer Z.,"Elizabethtown, PA",16,69,139,4.0,11/20/2016,"Ambiance was relaxing and clean. The waitress was nice but you could tell she was stressed and/or tired.  The appetizer tasted homemade, loaded tater tots which had bacon, cheese and red skin potatoes rolled in panko crumbs with two dips. I'm not sure I could share them next time- that's how yummy they were.   The menu was huge so it took a while to pick one item.  They could cut the menu in half because it was almost ridiculous. No wonder there's a line out the door. Everyone's taking so long reading the menu!!    I got the bowl soup, sandwich and a salad. The salad had nutritious greens in it. Of course, I got dessert!! Chocolate cake was to die for.  The ladies at my table agreed and had some too!  Overall, I would visit again. We need one in Hershey PA."
Ed G.,"Emmaus, PA",22,93,32,3.0,7/2/2017,"We have been coming here for years, and there is some good and some bad with regards to this particular establishment. First, let's talk about the good.  The food here is always good and very consistent.  There is a ton of options here, and if you can't find something on this menu, there is probably something seriously wrong with you.  Some of my personal favorites include the quesadilla, black pepper shrimp, factory meatloaf, and Louisiana chicken pasta.  The portions are huge, so expect to come home with leftovers.  I've never ordered anything that I really didn't like.  The cheesecake is fantastic, and there are about 30-40 different options.  My favorite is the Adams peanut butter. Now the bad.  This place is notorious for long waits.  Being in the King of Prussia mall which is always busy means always at least a 20-30 min wait and sometimes upwards of 2 1/2-3 hours during the holiday season.  My big problem is that you will be told the wait is 20-30 minutes and end up waiting 40-50 minutes for your table.  I've even had a half hour wait turn into an hour and a half on one occasion.  The service is also pretty slow as well.  They really need to get their act together with regards to these issues. So overall, good food, but lackluster service and be prepared to wait."
Bridget C.,"Mountain View, CA",11,42,9,1.0,10/5/2017,For the negative review I only got the somewhat ironic response shown on here.  They did not try to offer me a gift card or entice me to come back.
Nadine B.,"Bensalem, PA",101,248,140,4.0,5/20/2017,Who doesn't like cheesecake factory? This location was great. Stopped in during lunch and the place was just getting busy so we were seated right away. Service was quick and the good came out perfect. My coworker lost her phone and the staff was really nice in helping her find it!
