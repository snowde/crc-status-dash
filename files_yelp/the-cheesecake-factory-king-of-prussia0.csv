Jennifir A.,"Gap, PA",22,66,32,2.0,7/16/2012,"First off the cheesecake.... was delicious.... we tried the macadamia white chocolate cheesecake, raspberry white chocolate and the red velvet. Perfection.  The food.. well, just no. I got the salmon salad... horrible... i tried the piece of fish that was smothered with herbs.... a horrible sensation on your tongue. My husband tried a bite and both of us said our tongues felt like it was burning.. his meatloaf didn't seem like it was fully ground beef... like it had a lot of filler. He didn't eat it all... The mashed potatoes were awesome though. My mom had chicken and it tasted and felt like it was microwaved. So disappointing for the cost I sent my food back, and got a chicken ceasar salad which was good.. Overall the meal was so disappointing especially for the price you pay.  Only great thing besides the dessert was our waiter, Christopher, who was very professional, friendly, knowledgable, and charming."
Karima K.,"Temple, PA",16,39,,4.0,8/18/2015,I love all the selections of the cheese cakes. They have great food! Never had a bad experience that I can remember and let me tell u I don't forget the bad experience. Haha
Michael D.,"Ardmore, PA",30,15,15,4.0,1/8/2014,Love this place but can't give a solid 5 until they start putting that stick of sugar cane back in their Mojitos.. Never skip on the chicken lettuce wraps. My favorite entrees are Miso Salmon (Ask for extra miso sauce!) and the Kobe Beef Burger...  (I hate mushrooms but I LOVE them on this burger) I have a sweet palette so keep that in mind.
Robin P.,"Marysville, PA",37,78,17,4.0,3/4/2014,"Can not complain about this chain even though I am not a fan of cheesecake.  I love the decor of cheesecake factory restaurants.  Though crowded, the service has been good.  Enjoy coming here just for a quick ""snack"" and beverage when going to King of Prussia Mall shopping.  Check it out!"
Pranav S.,"San Jose, CA",138,16,3,1.0,5/28/2015,"Visited on 26th May. The taste was all ok. However, I had ordered Spicy Chicken with Cashew nuts (Mandarin Style) and am suffering from food poisoning. This is not accepted from such a reputed chain. My friend wanted me to sue.. but who has the time."
Mario A.,"Norristown, PA",0,15,,5.0,5/26/2015,"One of the best fine-dining restaurants in the area. The food is good and served well. The waiters and waitresses are nice, friendly, and professional. The only negative is that sometimes you'd have to wait a bit before finding a table. The place is not cheap, but prices are reasonable compared to other fine-dining restaurants. Their menu is comprehensive. It's very unlikely that you won't find few things that you like from the menu. Also, their dessert are as good as it can get. Though, their plates are big so eating dessert after finishing your meal might be a challenge. Enjoy!"
Tina B.,"Pottstown, PA",81,140,482,3.0,2/17/2014,"Love the food, but not taking reservation is not too pleasing. Waiting in the line for over 2 hours wasn't fun, they ran out of buzzer, and didn't even take your phone number to get a hold of you. They food was great, not very diet friendly if your looking to stick to your diet. It took a group of 4 and 1:30 for full service, from app to dessert, which is a long time. I understand being busy but with lot's of server, waitress, mangers and other staff.  The food was great but on the higher end of the price point. I got an original margarita which was not mixed correctly.  Cheesecake was to die for!!"
Katrina S.,"Blue Bell, PA",26,31,14,3.0,3/4/2014,"My go - to when I am in KOP and I do not want to spend a ton, and want healthy options.  I have been here countless times and everything the main thing that is consistent is the food. Service is typically good, a handful of times bad and a handful of times great. If it is a weekend night, be ready for a wait as they do not do reservations.  Food wise the kale salad sliced tuna salad are my favorite thing on the menu - plentiful and cheap. If i am going for a full meal, the pasta dishes are always very good.  My con to this place is that it is a chain and the service is not always great, the waiters are their to turn and burn and you get that vibe.  The cheesecake is always very good, obviously."
Nico L.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,227,1,4.0,9/23/2013,"I was here a few weeks ago with my girlfriend. Went here for lunch and had to wait the standard 30 minutes for a table due to the business's popularity. The treatment you get is variable. Sometimes you get someone waiting on you hand and foot, other times it's a madhouse.  I've never had the same server twice. The food here though, gives generous portions and is at least a half-step above the Chili's and TGIF's of the world (a full step on TGIF actually). The food, for its price, is easily 5-stars. The service can be downright mediocre, but sometimes it is exemplary.  One other negative is that the chicken that they serve with pasta, is with bone-in. When I order pasta, I'd rather have use my utensils only and not have to work my way around a bone. It's essentially the same thing as shrimp having their tails on. Of course, the cheesecake is the highlight of it all. Any meal without that is incomplete. Though normally I'm too stuffed to enjoy it there and just take it home"
Eli P.,"Narberth, PA",0,14,,5.0,6/7/2014,"I love The Cheesecake Factory! I will wait any amount of time! It is so worth it! The Pasta da Vinci is so good creamy, chicken with mushrooms, it will melt in your mouth! You can't go wrong with any of the Chocolate or Strawberry Cheesecakes. By the way, you can go shop while you wait! I came on a snowy night in February! My favorite restaurant in my favorite mall! P.S. The portions are huge!"
Katie P.,"Massapequa Park, NY",108,201,,5.0,1/14/2014,Cheesecake Factory is an awesome restaurant with a huge menu. If you're looking to eat healthy do not order off the regular menu. They are caloric nightmares and have tons of fat. Cheesecake is also very secretive about their stats and only ever have them up when laws forced them too.  Skinnylicious menu is where it's at but you still need to be carful there because they can be up to 600 calories.  I usually get the tuna carpaccio as my enter and enjoy it with a few prices of bread. It is large thin slice raw tuna with avocado and a delicious soy based sauce. Their pumpernickel bread is warm and amazing and a great accompaniment for a lunch under 400 calories.  Cheesecakes of course are amazing but only if you want to ingest 900 plus Val's
David T.,"Lancaster, PA",361,38,22,4.0,10/10/2010,"I really like coming here, but just for some choice dishes that I oft find myself craving. For a huge chain, the service is not bad, but at this location it's often a long wait for a table (and they don't take reservations). I definitely recommend coming for lunch - you can get a lot of the items at lunch portions and prices. Let's get on with the food - I love the bread. And I personally always ask for olive oil, balsamic and parm to dip it in. For appetizers, the buffalo blasts and fried zucchini are really good. Entree-wise, I ALWAYS order the spicy chicken chipotle pasta. I've asked for it extra spicy a couple times and they were pretty amenable to my requests. One time it was a little much, but hey, I asked for it. It was quite the epic battle.  I've tasted some other dishes with my friends - herb-crusted salmon was kind of...gross, their house salad with balsamic dressing is good. Clam chowder is just okay.  And while I'm not a dessert person, it IS Cheesecake Factory, so I do order from time to time. Both the strawberry and key lime cheesecakes are very good."
Chrystal C.,"East Brunswick, NJ",343,101,20,4.0,5/3/2013,"Your typical Cheesecake Factory, except this location makes my favorite Cheesecake Factory entree so much better AND larger than any other Cheesecake Factory I have been to: The Chicken Bellagio! Expect a wait, even at odd hours during the day (2-4 pm), especially on weekends. We waited forty minutes for a table at 3 pm. My parents are normally not impressed with chain restaurants/food, but they were with our meal here.  Fish and Chips were excellent. My dad's steak was not - we have had better (granted, it's not Ruth's Chris), and his was cooked too long (he wanted med rare and it came out med well) but they gladly took it back and cooked up another one more to his liking. My mom's turkey half-sandwich, salad, and soup lunch special was huge. Note: different soups on different days of the week but it's the same rotation. Service is pretty decent considering how busy they constantly are... and as always, their cheesecake slices are huge and delicious."
Meghan C.,"Sea Isle City, NJ",24,54,1,5.0,1/5/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I am always satisfied when I leave this place. The bread they give you is absolutely phenomenal. I especially love the four cheese pasta with chicken, the chipotle chicken pasta, the mozzarella sticks, and the vanilla bean cheesecake! I recommend this place to everyone!"
Amy G.,"Pottstown, PA",70,12,,4.0,2/6/2015,"Went here last night with my husband and nephew, it was a Thursday at 6 o'clock. We expected to have a long wait but were seated right away. Our waitress was a bit odd but we received our food and drinks very quickly. I ordered the chicken avacado club and sweet potato fries. Delish! My husband got an American cheeseburger, and my nephew got a chicken Marsala dish we were all extremely pleased and it was huge portions sizes. For desert I ordered the lemon raspberry cheesecake and my nephew the Adams cheesecake yummmmy! Very nice time out!!"
Anony-mom C.,"Newtown, PA",40,189,4,5.0,12/3/2014,"Delicious food! I love that they have gotten rid of the beepers and now text you when your table is ready. We had a great experience being able to browse the court portion of the mall while waiting, when in years past, we had to sit on the floor in front of the restaurant. Our nachos were amazing as were our entrees. We had a long piece of hair baked into one piece of the cheesecake, and kindly they just comped both slices instead of just the one. Great customer service. Love coming here."
Alison K.,"Market East, Philadelphia, PA",132,199,12,1.0,5/24/2014,"The cheesecake is literally the only good thing about this place. It's always incredibly crowded and loud, yet there is always a wait. My boyfriend claims no matter what he orders, he always feels sick after eating here--it might be their cooking oil. Last time we went I got a breakfast sandwich and they substituted a different kind of bread workout asking. It was ok, but I wish hey had acknowledged that it was different from the menu. As we sat down, the ""clean"" silverware on the table had bits of green food stuck in it--both sets. Our server was ok but MIA almost the entire time. Do yourself a favor and just get your cheesecake to take out; ignore the rest of it."
L2 A.,"Elizabethtown, PA",0,44,39,4.0,3/24/2015,"We love The Cheesecake Factory & always take advantage of the SLICE OF JOY offered around Christmas when you purchase gift cards & receive free cheesecake. One of the highlights to our King of Prussia visits three times a year is this restaurant. The entrees are very generous & we typically split our fav' the Spicy Cashew Chicken & each get a slice of our favorite cheesecake, Oreo Dream Extreme & the Red Velvet. We have always had good service at this location, but ALWAYS expect a wait - simply because they are packed! Definitely recommend!"
Michael B.,"Phoenixville, PA",5,4,,2.0,10/1/2012,"There's really nothing special about this restaurant. It's just a glorified Ruby Tuesdays with the ostentatious dial turned way up. The food is OK, but overpriced. They've also fallen into the trap of ""if we can't wow you with quality, let's just overwhelm you with quantity..."" My wife and I both felt awful after our meal (and no we didn't stuff ourselves or have dessert). I guess if you need 3000 calories to feed your growing obesity problem and you don't mind spending a lot more that other places you could get that many calories in one meal... go for it."
Stan B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,20,,2.0,2/13/2016,"After waiting an hour and a half we were taken and seated at a table that was dirty and with tableware that was not clean.  Upon making our waitress who introduced herself as Annmarie about the table and dinnerware she quickly apologized and got everything cleaned up and in order.  Annmarie tried her heart out and was teriffic I am sorry to say the food was not.  Cobb salad was moist with water, everything pizza was very greasy and burger was very over cooked.  Coffee was extremely bitter and Reese's peanut butter chocolate cheese cake simply lacked.  Not a great meal, but Annmarie's attitude, courtessness and personality shined."
