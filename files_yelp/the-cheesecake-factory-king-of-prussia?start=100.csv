Kyleigh C.,"Metairie, LA",264,3,,1.0,9/5/2016,"My friends and I were visiting the area and decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 9pm. We sat outside on Monday 9/5/16. When we were being seated we heard a girl (obviously working patio) says ""ugh great. I'm gonna kill myself"" making us feel as though she did not want us to sit out there. When she approached me and my other friend while the other two people with us were using the restroom, she slammed the bread basket down and said ""what can I get you to drink"". I responded and said ""I would like a diet"". She returned to get the drinks and while she was coming in the door as my friends were coming out she was mocking me saying ""I'll have a diet"" in a rude condescending tone to her accompanying server on the patio. Our servers name was Emily. However I do not know the name of the other server on the patio who, while our server was taking our order walked by and said, "" I hate me life"" and our server discretely responded ""same"". I did not witness this myself, one of the people I was with did. Me and my friends have NEVER been treated so terribly. We are all servers ourselves and know it can be frustrating at times but this was absurd. When we asked the hostess for a manager, no manager came. We believe the also rude hostess never said anything to the manager on duty. We feel extremely disrespected and will not be back. Food was okay, not bad but not great either. There were things missing from our order, chicken as a topping on a salad and no jalapeños on the nachos. Small things that usually we would pay no mind to but we believe was done intentionally. We felt rushed by not only our server but by the other server with the braids on the patio as well. If I had a dollar for every time the two servers on the patio had rolled their eyes or loudly stated walking past not only our table but others ""I am going to kill myself"" we wouldn't have had to pay for our $128.00 meal. We spent a lot of money and tipped 20% because that is in our nature. The server did not deserve it, but we will not stoop to the level of the employees you currently have working there.   If you would like to see what good service looks like, when you are serving 12 tables at once instead of 3, come visit the brickyard in Williamsport. We'll show you how it's done."
Yec H.,"Wayne, PA",3,90,119,2.0,9/28/2016,"Came here on a weeknight. Got seated right away for a party of seven. I ordered the chopped salad, the portion is big. My son got the Mac n cheese and the other one got chicken tenders. We were almost done and I looked over and he still got 3/4 bowl of his Mac n cheese left. He said, it doesn't taste good. I took a taste test and oh lord.... it was watery and tasteless. I called over our waiter and told him about the issue. He said, he can give us another one or take it off the bill. Seriously...I don't think my dog will even eat it. It was so gross. Please take it off the bill.... poor kids that ate this that day... they wouldn't know any difference. I just hope the chef will taste it before serving it."
Anna B.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,56,4,4.0,7/11/2017,love their cheesecakes... the menu is extensive and pretty ok...there is a heavy traffic during weekday lunch hours..
Christina Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",672,20,37,5.0,5/3/2016,Skinny menu is AMAZING.Service is AMAZING.Ambiance is AMAZING.Dessert is.....AMAZING.5 starts to this place.Never dissapoints .
Susan P.,"Orefield, PA",0,14,18,4.0,6/3/2017,"Had a late dinner after shopping at King of Prussia. Dinner was excellent! Unfortunately no room for dessert. Our server, Kayla was also very good! Would definitely recommend this restaurant."
Erica H.,"Marysville, PA",0,19,1,4.0,12/23/2016,"Went in for lunch and got seated very quickly. I ordered off of the lunch special menu and my friend off the dinner menu. Our waitress was fantastic, she never let out drinks go empty and was very attentive and friendly. The food came and our meals were huge portions. The only reason I'm giving this place place 4 stars is because the pasta I had seemed reheated because it was lukewarm as opposed to the rest of the dish which was fine."
Paula A.,"Whitehall, PA",2,25,8,4.0,8/1/2016,"My first experience at the Cheesecake Factory was good. I got pasta and it was great. Honestly I wasn't expecting it to be that good. I couldn't even get dessert because I was so full! I like how they give you bread in the beginning. Next time I go I definitely have to try their desserts! The server was okay, I felt as if she could have been nicer. We had to wait for over 30 mins to get a table which I heard is normal but I would never wait 2 hours to eat here (I've heard many people have). Overall my first time experience was good!"
Kaylee Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,58,99,3.0,4/26/2016,"3.75 Stars  The Cheesecake Factory is always busy and they do not take reservations.  It is located in the mall, so just grab a pager and then go shopping and you can return once the buzzer sounds.  The service is very quick for always being so packed.  They give you a free bread basket and butter.  The pumpernickel bread is very good and right out of the oven.  My favorite dishes are the Four Cheese Pasta, Bang Bang Chicken, Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo, and the bowtie pasta.  Almost all the pasta dishes are very good.  Be warned that the portions are huge and fit for family style dinner.  Sharing is caring. The cheesecakes are also very good.  My favorite is the strawberry cheesecake, which is just the original with strawberries on top.  It adds a good freshness to cut the heavy cheesecake and cream."
Sharee W.,"Glen Allen, VA",33,209,600,4.0,5/28/2015,"I can always count on a good meal from The Cheesecake Factory. We went between the lunch and dinner rush so we didn't have to wait. The service was friendly and fast. As usual, the portions were huge. I really like that they have a calorie conscious food and drink menu."
Jen S.,"Collegeville, PA",122,11,,4.0,2/27/2016,"Food is always great. Beat & Goat cheese salad, the farro salad and Greek salads are my favorite. The Sheppard's Pie is a must. The Turkey burger is incredibly flavorful. Nothing I don't recommend. They make a proper martini. Not too dirty, chilled just right. The SERVICE is always wonderful. Very attentive but not annoying. Friendly and know how to take care of their tables. After a 12 year restaurant tenure, I enjoy coming to CCF because they treat you as guest should be treated. They deserve a 30% tip!"
Shon G.,"Norristown, PA",0,24,2,3.0,11/19/2016,The only reason this location is getting 3 stars is because the portion sizes are decent and the fact that the Cheesecake is delicious. Service is rushed; which I understand it's a busy mall but seriously pump the brakes; I feel like I get my check before I get the appetizer. The food is also rushed and you can tell; I've been there at least 4 times and the only time the food tastes decent is after I've had a few drinks. Save yourself the drama and just purchase a slice of cheesecake to go and skip everything else.
Manoj B.,"Greenville, SC",290,171,222,4.0,1/9/2015,We came in here on a Saturday afternoon and as expected the wait time was quite a bit. That's ok considering the day and location. On getting the text we came in here and our waiter was really good. He not only helped us with the menu but gave his suggestions too. The portions can get a bit better but the food tasted great. The cheesecake options are good too.
Elaine M.,"Philadelphia, PA",11,348,90,1.0,10/23/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory, is the Cheesecake Factory.  If you are into massive portions from chain restaurants, and like to overdose on sodium and sugar to the point of not being able to taste the actual food that you are eating; you will find this place just as grande as every other Cheesecake Factory.  I really have nothing else to say, call me a food snob.  I was forced to eat here for a work function.  I shouldn't have checked-in, because now I feel the need to pay a review.  I hope to never return... to any Cheesecake Factory."
Danan R.,"New York, NY",813,1698,31,4.0,12/12/2015,"Very long wait and slow service BUT I do love the sweet wheat bread and the enormous platters of sweet potato fries.  it's amazing how the first bite of bread and butter is enough to make me forget my frustration with the wait.  The bang bang chicken with shrimp is a new hit with me, as is the chicken and biscuits.  I was able to substitute broccoli and spinach for the peas and carrots, which was a nice plus.  The bang bang dish is simmered in a creamy Thai curry sauce that is a nice fusion take for those who can't handle the authentic Thai spice.  Highly recommend the white rice over the brown as the brown can be al dente and dry.  Prices are very reasonable for the enormous portions.  One entree is almost enough for two!"
Asta L.,"Malvern, PA",15,11,1,3.0,10/27/2016,"Their food is good (for the most part), my salmon filet was burnt once, I didn't make a big deal out of it because I just like their food so much. Cheesecakes are pricey but very, very good! Service is lacking a little bit though, especially their hosting staff. It was a different hostess girl every time I went there and every single one of them looked very annoyed. It almost looked like they sometimes act like they don't see us unless we get really close to their counter and that's when they still don't say ""hello"" and take their time organizing their menus."
Brittany C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",40,27,1,3.0,4/25/2017,Ordered curbside pickup. My food took longer to prepare then stated on the call. My salad was decent.
Stefanie T.,"King of Prussia, PA",91,7,,4.0,10/22/2016,"Love this place! The staff is always friendly and personable, no matter how busy it is. The food is great and so are the drinks! I went with former student one afternoon and she used A LOT of butter on her bread. The waiter saw this and surprised her with a ""Butter Sundae!"" it was hysterical! I was so sweet especially considering how busy they were that day! I've never had a bad experience at this location! I gave it four stars because their coffee isn't good...at all haha but everything else is A+! My fave!"
Marc K.,"Blandon, PA",83,125,301,5.0,2/9/2016,"Go during off-hours to avoid long wait times.  My wife and I recently arrived at 4 pm on a Sunday and were seated immediately. I had the Korean BBQ Chicken Sandwich with fries.  I really enjoyed it -- the chicken is super tender and has a thin crispy coating, not overly breaded at all.  Fries are served in one of those heated metal cylinders which keeps them hot throughout your meal, it was a nice surprise. The fries came with two little cups, one filled with ketchup and the other with a spicy mayonnaise-based dipping sauce. My wife had a Cuban sandwich with a small side salad instead of the fries.  It was equally good & she only ate half the sandwich (we took the other half home in a doggy bag)."
Priscilla Q.,"Brentwood, CA",10,53,38,4.0,4/13/2015,"I think I've been to this restaurant about 10 times now and have never ordered the same thing twice. I've always enjoyed my meal! Never disappointed! Portions are great. Try their strawberry lemonade, it's awesome and you'll get free refills. Just wish this place wasn't as pricey. Service could be a little faster as well but overall, I love this place!  If you've never been here, must try's are:  - Cajun jambalaya  - spicy chipotle chicken pasta  - da Vinci pasta - fish tacos  But then again....everything everyone else orders at the table always looks great too..."
Sherrice B.,"Philadelphia, PA",38,136,255,4.0,2/5/2017,"Finally a free moment to have dinner with my love, arrived to the restaurant was a 55 minute wait. We decided to walk the mall in the meantime to kill the wait time. Came back and was seated abt 10 mins later an we ordered dinner. We were seated in the booth on the other side to where the waiter and waitresses get there items an so forth so most of the evening I heard draws slamming an a lot of banging on the other side of out table. Was kinda of annoying but we sat there. Our waiter was nice and friendly, we started out with two red sangrias an they were tasty! I ordered the chicken bellagio minus the prosciutto it was still good an I had a lot to bring home with me. Bae had the filet,mashed potatoes,asparagus which he enjoyed didn't leave a drop behind. He wanted ice cream but they were out of What he wanted. I did bring home a Oreo cheesecake which I'll be tasting tonight! This is just a suggestion but the restaurant is so dark I had to use my phone to read the menu. They should consider putting some lighting or candles on the tables so people can see ..just my opinion tho!"
