Elle F.,"Detroit, MI",76,104,112,3.0,8/16/2016,Nice. No different than any other CF. Staff was friendly. No happy hour at this location. :(
Debbie D.,"Glenolden, PA",0,8,,5.0,4/12/2017,My family and I ate at Cheesecake Factory again last night. Our server was Shane and he was excellent. We have been fortunate to have him as our server on previous visits and he is always courteous and provides great service. Our dinners were delicious as usual. Chicken Romano and pasta. One of the best dishes on the menu! We can't wait till we plan another shopping trip to the mall  so we can stop in again for dinner.
Samantha H.,"Havertown, PA",286,367,220,4.0,1/30/2015,"Went here with my boyfriend the other weekend for the first time in years, mainly because we got a gift card for Christmas. We didn't think we'd need a reservation since we ended up going pretty late(after 9, when the mall was closed), but we were wrong. We were seated in about a half hour. Cheesecake Factory's menu is overwhelmingly huge, so we decided to just get apps. We shared: Caesar Salad- great, with a big enough portion for two Pretzel Crusted Chicken- this was pretty bad, we didn't even finish it. Not what I was expecting at all Dynamite Shrimp- excellent, similar to Bonefish's bang bang shrimp The service was great despite being crowded. Our waitress was Sarah P. and she was super friendly and attentive. You can't come here without getting cheesecake, but we were pretty full so we got a slice of the oreo cheesecake to go. We shared it that night and it was absolutely heavenly. I forgot how great their cheesecake was.  As far as food goes, CF is above average for a chain, while still being priced pretty reasonable.  Edit to add: I have tried to come here numerous times since this review. But, there is always a ridiculously long wait that is not worth it. They need to start taking reservations."
Pup S.,"Perkasie, PA",0,8,2,4.0,1/13/2017,"the only reason this isnt a 5 star review is because of Miss Grace H.  crusty ray romano? fabulous.  mac n cheese burger? out of this world.  cesaer salad? best of all.  cake? big n strong.  cheesecake? painstakingly delicious.  a one ms. grace H? returned multiple attempts to compliment her singing fell flat with nothing but a bad tude and an ignorance of the iconic anthem, ""Childs Play."" in her defense, it was busy. but that doesnt mean your drake references should be mediocre or foggy. just disappointed, especially from a pop culture standpoint."
Andrew R.,"Manassas Park, VA",479,99,158,4.0,8/15/2015,"1 Star - Ambience, Restaurant Cleanliness and Interior Design 1 Star - Amazing Service 1 Star - Delicious Food 1 Star - Left Satisfied  People either love this place or hate it. It is a ""big-chain restaurant"" I get it... but it's also a BIG serving size of a good to delicious food in my opinion.  So I was here having dinner with a friend and I have to say first off, it looked like a HOT MESS. There was a bit of a line to the hostess and every person coming back from the front was reporting back to their families ""it's going to be a 50 minute wait.... ugh"", or some sort of noise of frustration.  It was 7:30pm on Thursday night and I was thinking, oh damn... if it takes almost an hour, I don't think it's worth that long of a wait? But also, I was friggin hungry. Yet, made it to the front fairly fast and for a PARTY of 2, we were instantly seated. Better for 2 than more. Perfect! Whew. The only gripe I had about the night was that I don't like the Party of 2 Tables basically lined up with only 1 small table's length of space between them. As we were seated I had a couple on both sides of our table and maaaaaaan can people be nosey. Listening in on conversations and just looking at us while we eat. I ordered the Classic Burger with amazing fries and the entire time, I felt like a lion demolishing amazing meats while hyenas just kept looking at me from the sides. I just kept looking back at them - for the eyes to turn away real quick as if they weren't creep'n... but besides the point. Food here, is known for its BIG PORTIONS. How do you even get Appetizers, Main Course and Dessert? I had my burger and fries and was done.  the highlight of the night was a young lady named ""Amy"" if I caught her name right. (It's quite noisy inside). Her service, was on point! She was there when my drinks needed to be refilled and wasn't hovering or interrupting conversations at all. Really appreciated her service that my friend and I split a good tip! Overall, will I go there again? Yes. Will i ask for outdoor seating where it's a little less crammed with people creep'n. Yes. But I enjoyed it."
Kerrie B.,"Lewisburg, PA",0,98,7,3.0,10/15/2016,Overall very tasty albeit filling and fattening food.  I really enjoy the chicken piccata although I know 2 Italian broads with a spatula who really make a killer piccata even better than this. No complaints about this facility although food is really meant to be shared I believe.
Zhenpeng H.,"York, PA",29,1,,1.0,2/11/2017,It took me nearly two and a half hours to wait and the food was just like a shit. The rice was raw and dry. Herbal crusted chicken was salty and dry.
Jessica R.,"Norristown, PA",1,12,1,5.0,3/25/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory in King of Prussia has great service, an amazng menu with very well prepared food, every time. The desserts are epic and scrumptious!! I always try to eat dessert first, because lifes short, so why not? Great, fast, friendly service with good recommendations when asked. The envirnment is clean, properly lit and decorated and enjoyable. I truely enjoy eating at this location when I'm around the mall or in the area."
Seymore B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,14,2,3.0,9/3/2016,"Seymore was in town and had some dinner at this establishment. Now Seymore loves his tuna and he had the ahi tuna special , the tuna was quite tasty however Seymore is no pussy cat and would have liked to have had more tuna on his plate, especially when Seymore is laying out $19 big ones for his main course. This dish mostly contains rice with very few vegetables, the sauce was well done with nice flavor but all in all the dish was disappointing to Seymore. Now you can not go to the Cheesecake Factory and not have cheesecake,  since Seymore was still hungry after his meal he had two pieces of cake, one was the vanilla bean and the other was strawberry, both pieces were delicious , all the folks in this house were more than friendly and nice. Seymore will give this place only 3 stars due to his disappointment with the main course now I will return soon when I'm back in town and give this establishment another try. Peace people."
Elizabeth D.,"Upper Darby, PA",0,68,14,3.0,1/7/2017,"Came here for dinner with my fiance tonight. Our waiter was very nice and friendly. We got the fried mac and cheese balls which was out of this world. My fiance got the spaghetti and meatballs which he said was good however my Alfredo pasta with chicken was very bland, there was no flavor to it at all. It was not worth the 20 dollars. If we decided to come back I might just stick with appetizers and their cheesecakes."
John H.,"Springfield, PA",0,16,,5.0,1/19/2017,Went on a Saturday and the wait for a table was 1 hour. Well worth the wait. Food was great and service was fantastic!!!  Had the bacon bacon cheeseburger and it was great!!! Have been there at least 7 times in the last two years and the service and food  have always been fantastic!!!!!
None B.,"London, United Kingdom",0,37,,4.0,8/24/2016,Truly excellent restaurant but MASSIVE queues day and night.
Marly M.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,24,1,4.0,1/8/2017,"I visited this location on Tuesday.  This was the worst experience I have ever had.  I took my handicapped mother there.  Was greeted by the hostess who told us it would be 40 minutes.  We waited over an hour for a table.  She seemed to be making up times because I was listening to her give out times to people.  The person behind me got '50 minutes', the next person '40'.  It went on and on.  They really should train a hostess on how to seat properly.  When we were finally seated we were helped by Shawn.  Here is where it went down hill more.  My mom ordered ice tea.  He never told her it was unsweetened.  So I asked her to bring her a glass of water instead since the ice tea, even with sugar in it, was not drinkable. Ten minutes later, he shows up with a glass of water!!! So then we order our food and I specifically ask to not have shrimp on it.  He said no problem and it will be $17.25.  Out comes the food.  Shawn ordered me the wrong meal.  Awesome!! So my mom starts eating.  After 15 minutes, no sign of our waiter of course, I see another waiter and ask for the manager.  My mom is done eating and I have no food yet.  No manager ever came to the table.  20 minutes later I got my food.  No manager.  I ate it.  Got the bill.  Was charged for shrimp!!! Was so pissed at the whole experience.  Just paid and left.  I live in Florida and I have never had this happen the many times I eaten in that restaurant there before.   I asked for a manager.  None ever came because I got the wrong food, my bill was wrong, we complained when we sat down, the waiter was never seen, the hostess was awful!!! I wrote this same review on Wednesday January 3, 2017 on the Cheesecake website and no one has contacted me.  Goes to show how much they care about customer service!!!  I just received a call from Chris from Customer Service. He was following up on the experience.  1/8/2017.  I appreciated the call.  Thank you."
George S.,"Malvern, PA",0,58,,3.0,1/8/2017,"Ordered the Buffalo bites, which was mostly bread crumbs and little chicken. They give you buffalo sauce on the side with blue cheese.  Just an average experience."
Mark P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,27,2,4.0,1/4/2017,"Capital Grille was closed for lunch on Sat. Dec 31st, New Year's Eve, so we checked the wait time at The Cheesecake Factory (which is usually a 45 min wait at 12:30 on a Saturday), and found it was only 20 minutes.  15 minutes later we were seated and had a great experience all around.  The food was perfect (I ordered steak), the service was 5 star quality-- far superior to Sullivan's (which is at least temporarily on my ""I hate them"" list).  As of 12/31/16 I have nothing but good things to say about The Cheesecake Factory at the KOP Mall; it is pricey but it was all around worth it!  Of course the company always makes the meal so it helped I was with 3 amazing friends!"
Krista S.,"Orwigsburg, PA",0,14,12,5.0,7/31/2016,This is our favorite place to eat.  A great selection for the whole family and guests.  It's always clean and we've always had great servers.
Leah Y.,"Philadelphia, PA",167,253,221,5.0,8/4/2014,"Always so good,  I always come for the same thing the bang bang shrimp with the side of succotash I'm always leaving with a doggie bag because you get soo much food loving it everytime"
Rutu P.,"Collegeville, PA",205,96,6,3.0,6/1/2015,Ok so overall I've had a pretty good experience here but the last time I went...not so great.  The food was eh. But the service was horrible! Like absolutely horrible. I had to ask for the check when I got my lunch because I wasn't sure when she would be coming back to check on us.
Tsun L.,"Los Angeles, CA",204,6,,3.0,6/12/2016,We are lovers of cheese cake factory. But this one is just crazily crowded with long lines of waiting on Fridays and Saturdays.
Bernie M.,"Exton, PA",141,15,2,3.0,10/3/2015,"Excellent value! One of my favorite restaurants considering price, variety and taste. May I recommend the mac and cheese and tex mex egg rolls? Fantastic! My fiancé and I will customarily order nothing but appetizers - this is where Cheesecake Factory shines. The only downside is the long wait. You can anticipate 30-60 minutes on average."
