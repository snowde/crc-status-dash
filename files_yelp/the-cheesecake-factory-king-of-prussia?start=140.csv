Lucas S.,"Grand Prairie, TX",1,1,1,1.0,10/24/2015,"The wait to the sits here is ridiculous. People sit on the ground to wait 2 hours to get sits. No worth it, not fun... Maybe they should change their waiting system to texting do people can go walk around and do other things while they wait and just get a text message when their sit is ready."
Kate F.,"Philadelphia, PA",132,91,97,4.0,7/30/2014,"For a chain, the Cheesecake Factory is pretty impressive. The menu has great variety, the food quality is consistent, and the cheesecake is nothing short of amazing. The menu has actually been recently updated with a section of healthy offerings that I am looking forward to trying. Some of my favorite meals include the avocado egg rolls, skinnylicious vegetable salad, and veggie burger, and the lemon meringue and hershey bar cheesecakes are unbelievable.  One negative is the inevitable wait that you will encounter upon asking for a table. This place is always packed. Also, the portion sizes of the meals are just a little too big for my liking. I can't even imagine how much food is wasted here."
Kristin G.,"Skippack, PA",373,24,13,4.0,8/30/2015,"Last time I made a review I complained about how my take out was always wrong. Well, they have improved! :) I like it here and I love all the options they have on the menu. Working in the mall my choices are limited so it's nice to be able to choose from so many options! The menu is just okay, but it's still good food! Everyone at the counter when I pick up my take out is always super nice too!"
Doris B.,"Reading, PA",9,22,,4.0,2/1/2016,"Chicken alfredo was delicious this time around and the cheese cakes here are presented beautifully too. I found it to be a bit on the expensive side, however the good thing is they do give you quite large portions of food and the food itself is VERY filling. We didn't wait long for our food once we ordered, but it took a long time for our bill to be brought out. Our waitress that evening was a super kind young woman. Props to her for doing a fantastic job on a crowded weekend!"
Rachel B.,"Toronto, Canada",0,89,53,4.0,8/7/2015,"Yummy cheesecake! I got the vanilla bean and it was creamy and smooth and just so good...and HUGE. Also very rich, so I couldn't finish the whole thing in one sitting. Good for leftovers though. Their banana cream cheesecake is also great."
Nathaniel D.,"Schwenksville, PA",1,68,,5.0,6/8/2016,"It's the Cheesecake Factory for crying out loud. The Cheesecake Factory is amazing. The menu is huge. Their cheesecakes are awesome. Their entree's are huge. I can never finish my meal. The staff is really friendly. The establishment is clean, which is a must. It's a little expensive, but so worth it."
Lindsay V.,"Philadelphia, PA",129,182,16,4.0,12/8/2013,"My friend and I have an annual tradition that consists of Christmas shopping at KOP and having lunch/dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, adult libation necessary (this time it was a Georgia Peach. Brainfreeze inducing goodness!). It's a pretty amazing tradition. Our plan of attack is to share small plates, get a light entree and, of course, end with a hunk o' burning cheesecake. On this particular trip, we shared stuffed mushrooms (cheesy and delicious), sweet corn tamale cakes (absolutely amazing. Get this.), and crab bites (crispy on the outside, but a little mushy on the inside. Still yummy.). For my entree, I got the pear and endive salad. It was really good, the dressing was deliciously tangy. The pears were cooked, though. I think it would have been better with crisp, fresh pears. For my dessert, I got the Kahlua cheesecake. IT. IS. TO. DIE. FOR. It has a brownie base and.. oh, man. It's so good. Actually, writing this made me remember that I had some left over. I left my computer to go to the refrigerator to steal a bite. Yep, that good. Our server was a really nice, sweet girl. It was crazy busy in there but she never left us waiting for anything. I'm not sure how she did it, but she was awesome!"
Cornelia B.,"Lansdowne, PA",54,38,194,5.0,4/15/2015,"Gumbo, wondrous & mouth watering dish!  Includes Chicken, Shrimp and Smoked Sausage. With diced peppers along with tomatoes! Excellent service and wonderful management"
Jarrett F.,"Ithaca, NY",95,90,92,3.0,2/6/2016,"Pretty typical for Cheesecake factory. Novel of a menu that's fairly overwhelming, very large portion sizes, always very busy, no reservations, service a little on the slower side, and typically sticky tables. Not a huge fan overall, but the food is pretty good, hence the 3 star rating."
Emily G.,"Macungie, PA",8,32,2,4.0,3/21/2015,"First and foremost they have great cheesecake! I always get the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and it's awesome!!  As for the food? It's hit or miss. Avocado Eggrolls are so good. I love those and wish I could replicate them to save me the hour long trip to here. I've also had the grilled Portabella on a bun which is also good. Last time I went I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Yuck!!! Barely any sauce, no richness just heat. Luckily I brought it home and made my own cream sauce to salvage the leftovers. We've also gotten burgers which are big and fat but rarely juicy.  My advice? Stick to the appetizers and cheesecake!"
Melanie D.,"Pittston, PA",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2016,Here is an update received a reply from customer relations Craig Gumm  that gift cards are only to be used in locations but Harry and David stores sell the cheesecakes but do not accept  Cheesecake factory gift cards.So basically I still have a useless card.
Daisy G.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,88,462,5.0,1/18/2015,"My sister and I went here for a birthday brunch. There was about 18 of us and I liked that we were not on top of each other at the table. I ordered a whiskey drink, I forget what it was called but it was really good. I also got the Monte Cristo which was delicious! That is probably my new favorite meal from there. My sister got the garlic pasta which she liked but there was nothing spectacular about it. We also tried the vegetable tempura and that was really good too. For desert we had Chris's famous cheesecake which I didn't like, and the 7 layer chocolate cake. It was huge! But it was really good! There is always a wait here so make sure to call ahead!"
C. K. B.,"Clifton Heights, PA",1,99,227,4.0,7/13/2014,"This place does it right.  They have good food & good service and the place is always packed for lunch and dinner.  The portions are large so know that before you order appetizers, entrees and dessert. You will need to take it home! There is also outdoor seating if you like to eat cafe style. I have had good experiences here so I would recommend it. Save room for dessert since they have so many options for cheesecakes, they run about $7 - $10 a slice. Plenty of options for everyone, I always see lots of salads coming out of the kitchen. Go hungry as you will get a lot of food."
Roni V.,"Cedarbrook, Philadelphia, PA",10,22,40,3.0,11/15/2014,"The wait be real long that sehyo give it three stars, however the food n service is five star!!!"
Tom G.,"Norristown, PA",0,6,3,4.0,8/4/2015,"This place is great. It's your standard casual dining food. They have a great menu selection and huge portion sizes. The cheesecake is where they really shine though and they are all fantastic.  The biggest downfall is the very long wait times. I rarely can actually get a seat during normal dining times. They do not have a call ahead or reservation system, so be prepared to wait (sometimes for hours)."
Nicole V.,"Charlotte, NC",240,103,233,2.0,12/20/2014,The services is always particular slow at this location. The last time I was there it took almost an hour to get salad and chicken lettuce wraps.  It doesn't help that this location is always jammed and screaming loud with people. It's almost impossible to order because of the volume. I appreciate there new text messaging reservation. This allows you to at least shop while you are waiting for your table.
Pietra H.,"Collegeville, PA",83,2,,2.0,7/30/2016,"love the cheesecake. however, i did not enjoy the wait. ""5 minutes"" turned into 25 minutes for to-go cheesecake????? what???? 25 minutes thats right i didnt stutter. that's outrageous. cheesecake? more like cheesefake"
Alyse G.,"Lansdale, PA",66,20,172,5.0,3/5/2016,Consistently great food and service. The Skinnylicious menu offers delicious options...try the lemon garlic shrimp pasta! The oreo cookie cheesecake is insane! Bring your appetite...the portions are BIG!
S S.,"Millville, DE",0,22,,1.0,10/13/2016,"I think the name Cheese Cake Factory says it all and they should stick to that. Recently went for lunch and the food, hamburger sliders and chicken pot pie were close to uneatable. Service was good and server was very attentive. My suggestion if you're visiting the CCF for anything other than chees cake do yourself a favor and head out the door.  They might as well park the Sysco truck right out front and serve the food from the back of the truck."
Caitlin M.,"Wayne, PA",94,212,252,4.0,2/9/2015,"I do love the Cheesecake Factory, mainly for their consistency in their meals, the variety and amount of food they offer, and of course the delicious cheesecake.  You can find either a menu item under $10, or find a more expensive item for $20-25 and both taste great.  Downside to the Cheesecake factory (at pretty much any location) is the wait times!  No reservations, but they clearly know they don't need them because people will wait 2 hours.  My last wait time was 1.5 hours, but we had a very large party and already agreed on eating there.  It can also get pretty loud there so not the place to be at for quiet romantic evening.  If you are lucky and there are only 2 of you the seats by the bar are first come, first serve.  Overall great food, great cheesecake, sucky wait!"
