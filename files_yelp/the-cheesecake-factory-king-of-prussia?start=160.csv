Latoya H.,"Elkins Park, PA",109,67,142,5.0,11/5/2015,I love this place. Never had a bad experience EVER! At one point in time I came here at least once a week. I work near by and today decided out of no where I wanted some Calamari and Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake. I called in to order takeout and it was a while before the phone was answered (after all it was lunch time) and I was greeted very nicely when the phone was answered. My order was placed quickly and efficiently. The calamari was ready as promised in 15-20 minutes and the lady at the take out counter was very pleasant. Kudos to KOP Cheesecake Factory for maintaining such great customer service throughout the years!
Ashley P.,"Bethlehem, PA",163,1,,2.0,10/6/2016,Food was great. Portions gilling and everything cooked very very well. Service on the other hand... our servers name was Emily. We sat down and it took her a few minutes to get there. No biggie. We ordered some drinks and she dropped them off. We were sitting by the server station and she was complaining to another coworker about she got double sat and wanted to go outside. She took our appatizer order and then our entree order. Again. Appatizer salad. Huge. Haha. Then our entrees came out about 5 minutes after. I orderes the chicken pot pie. I was given the sheppards pie. We looked around for our server for a decent bit of time and then found another server. A grntleman with glasses who was on break and he took care of everything for us. Super amazing guy. She eventually came in from outside with another server and then appoligized. And when my food came out. The other person i was eating with was finished and asked to see a dessert menu. She said shed be back. Never got the menu. Came back a few minutes later and asked if we were done. I asked to have mine wrapped. She asked if we wanted a dessert menu. We said no at that point. Didnt feel like waiting some more. So she left our check WITH THE TIP SECTION CIRCLED. and walked away. Came back with my wrapped food. Threw it down on the table and walked away. Then we left money and walked out. This was the worst service ive had in my entire life. Only getting 2 stars cause of the other server who actually helped us and cause it was good food.
Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708,3.0,11/27/2013,"This place has some of the most amazing dessert! However on this particular night, we just grabbed salad. Our waitress was very attentive, but when I asked for extra dressing, she gave me a disapproving look and even commented ""You know dressing comes on the salad right?"" Even the guy I was with was like ""Damn, she's judging you."" Service was pretty quick, but every time she came by, I felt like I got the look of disapproval. Not a deal breaker by any means, but last time I checked, we were out for dinner not a second opinion. The food is good, but I'd probably order take-out unless you want to be judged."
Amy A.,"Norristown, PA",206,280,306,4.0,2/28/2013,"I really have limited critiques of CF. I will preface with I was an employee back in 2004-2005. They make just about everything there in the kitchen, minus the desserts. The wait can be long if you go during peak times and i rarely order alcohol since I think it's overpriced.  But the menu is extensive. You could go there everyday for a year and not order the same thing twice. I love their salads. They are huge ( even the lunch portions). I always get the Santa Fe  salad. It was chicken, beans, corn, tomatoes, tort strips, cilantro, and mixed with cilantro lime dressing and drizzled with a peanut sauce. To.die.for. when I'm watching the calories I order from their skinnylicious menu. The beet and goat cheese salad is divine and I'll pair that with one of their skinny taco options.  I suggest if you want to go with a short wait, avoid weekends. Weekdays are good, right at 11, when they pen or after 2. For dinner go right at 5 before the crowd comes in."
Glen M.,"Berwyn, PA",52,148,10,2.0,9/7/2014,"The food is OK and fairly priced, with a large menu so it'd be hard not to find something you like.  Leave room for dessert.   However, it seems to be perpetually busy, with a long wait to get in and no reservations taken.  Definitely a turn-off. Bring ear plugs to make it quieter."
Jordy A.,"Allentown, PA",52,2,,1.0,2/25/2016,"Bad service, never came to ask for refills on drinks or bread, the bread was hard and old, All of our dishes were horrible, it's obvious management is not taken serious here , it's either that or Cheesecake Factory is changing its flavor for the worst"
Lauri A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,301,1,4.0,9/20/2016,"We were at the movies and decided to dine afterwards. This place is great as it's on the outskirts of the mall. A little loud, but tasty food with fast, friensly, and attentive service keeps us coming back."
Kat C.,"Goose Creek, SC",59,51,20,5.0,1/14/2016,"Like most Americans, I love Cheesecake Factory!  I always crave their Luau salad and even their lunch portion is huge.   Whenever I consider the cheesecake, I look up the nutrition and realize 3 days worth of saturated fat is never worth 1 slice of cheesecake. I don't live near one of these restaurants anymore and can't figure out why Charleston, SC doesnt have one yet!"
Meena G.,"King of Prussia, PA",3,3,,3.0,3/9/2016,Average food .. not much options for veggies. This place is too closed with lots of smell
Siv L.,"San Francisco, CA",189,819,44,4.0,4/4/2011,"Had to write a review of The Cheesecake Factory in KOP because I grew up with it. The service is usually good. The wait is usually long (as the number of nice restaurants in KOP are limited). The bread is always great -- especially the brown bread -- they need to start serving it with olive oil. By far, my favorite dish here is the avocado spring rolls. So yummy! I also love the strawberry shortcake with ice cream -- YUM! As far as the cheesecake goes, there are way too many options. I've only had the plain once and it was OK."
Sisi G.,"Miami, FL",319,6,,4.0,8/10/2016,"Such good appetizers. The waitress was very nice but a bit confused on how to open a wine bottle.. We also didn't have knives set up with the rest of the silverware on our table. Overall a good time though, definitely recommend going."
Minnie H.,"Athens, GA",0,89,4,4.0,7/8/2016,Great cheesecake! I'm not sure if I'll ever be bold enough to eat here since I've always heard that the ccf food is horrible and expensive. Stick to what you know. And I know they make great cheesecakes.
N T.,"New York, NY",1,74,9,4.0,12/6/2015,"Not as bad as the overall rating makes it out to be. 1. Wait time was 20-30 minutes. You get a buzzer and can walk around the mall to entertain yourself while you wait.  2. Casual atmosphere. Wish the lighting was a little brighter but can't complain much. 3. Friendly service 4. Overwhelming menu, but the food is good. The cheesecakes are delicious."
Greg L.,"Collegeville, PA",71,746,928,4.0,7/19/2013,"Yummy...I love The Cheesecake Factory. Their menu has a huge selection and I could easily eat here everyday, but sadly, I'd be as big as the restaurant in no time! Fortunately, they do now have their skinny menu and most of the time, I just order off of that menu. The meals are 590 or less calories and still very flavorful. Although portion sizes are smaller than off their normal menu, you likely won't walk out hungry. That's because the portion sizes off of their regular menu is ridiculous! I really like the various Mexican dishes that they have here and often go with the chicken enchiladas.  For starters, we really like the taquitos. We've had several of their cheesecakes but our favorites are the vanilla bean and the Snickers, although I'm looking forward to trying their new S'mores coming later this month!!  Service has always been good. Downside is that this place is always packed and they do not take reservations or do call ahead seating. We arrived most recently around 4:00pm on a Sat afternoon and the wait was 60 minutes. By the time we left at 8:30 or so, the line was out the door just to put your name in, and the wait was up to 75 minutes. I heard they have a nice brunch on Sundays....gonna have to give it a try one of these days!"
Erica D.,"Dalton, PA",9,138,861,2.0,5/28/2014,"Since they do not take reservations, we walked up to the desk and prepared for a excruciating wait for mediocre food. The woman at the desk said tables were available outdoors currently or it would be a forty-minute wait for indoor seating. Not a fan of car exhaust mingling with our cheesecake, we opted to wait.  After thirty minutes of watching mall weirdos, the pager buzzed. We handed over our pager, and then a small piece of paper was put in the holder ... which was apparently the next part of the waiting game. When our name was called, they announced the wrong party-size AND proudly announced the our OUTSIDE table was ready. I quietly corrected the server on the party size and location. Thus ensued a conversation between this woman and the one behind the desk ... WHO THEN TORE UP THE SLIP OF PAPER WITH OUR NAME AND GAVE US ANOTHER PAGER AND TOLD US TO WAIT AGAIN. Had it not been for one member of our party begging us to stay (because he didn't have the will to seek another place), I would have snapped that pager in half and shoved it in the cushions of the leather chairs over by Urban Outfitters (I rehearsed this in my mind many times).  When the pager went off the second time, we silently handed it back in (in one piece, against my better judgement). The little slip of paper was again put in the holder ... where we stood again (it's like something out of the absurdest film Brazil). A new server, came for our party AND ANNOUNCED THE WRONG SIZE AGAIN. I corrected him. We all sat down at a booth and the server THEN brought over ONE fewer menus ... saying he was confused. (Well, he was clearly not alone in this). BTW, there was never an apology for the major waste of time. NEVER. (I don't drive to KoP to wait FOREVER (TWICE!) for a table at a chain restaurant).  The food was okay (it always is) but the experience was so HORRENDOUS that we will not return here. EVER! Maggianos is located on the perimeter of the mall, and they take reservations (and you can also place that reservation on your iPhone!) Go there!"
Tom A.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,26,1,5.0,8/14/2015,"Vegetarians- if you're like me, be warned: the choices are overwhelming! It took me a while to choose between the many apps, entrees, and of course salads on offer.  The veggie burger seems to be house made. Not the most flavorful patty, but lots of fresh veg toppings on it and sauces on it make it flexible.  If you're not vegetarian, don't worry: plenty of chicken, beef, and fish for you.  I ate for lunch, and had my food within 5 minutes of sitting down and finished in 30. Fast, fresh, and good."
Alisa A.,"King of Prussia, PA",10,41,,3.0,8/13/2015,Its definitely a good place for lunch. I dont think its incredible because it seems like every time i go there the food is made differently. The menu is huge which is nice but also overwhelming. I go there for lunch during work or a drink but its not my top choice for a date night or when friends  are visiting me.
Andrew C.,"Southampton, PA",24,24,4,4.0,1/17/2015,"Always a good pick. Huge menu, really too big, but always something for any time of day and any person. The appts and cheese cake are always my two favs. I usually can even skip a main encores and just get them. My top picks for apps Cuban rolls Corn Cakes mac & cheese balls buffalo blast Cheesecake Red velvet Pumpkin Key Lime"
Dory S.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",28,52,8,5.0,12/13/2015,Excellent!  I had the garlic noodles with shrimp. It was very tasty. The amount of food was alot for the price and of course the cheese cake was out of this world. Can't wait to go back!
Emma D.,"Brookhaven, PA",4,38,1,2.0,7/28/2014,"1.5 out of 2 stars for Food 0 out of 1 star for Service .5 out of 1 star for Cleanliness 0 out of 1 star for Atmosphere We were immediately put off by the detached and bored attitude of our server. She would not look us in the eye and ran through her rehearsed spiel with no emotion at all. We ordered the Tex Mex Eggrolls for an app. They had good flavor, but no spiciness at all. Very greasy. For entrees we ordered the chile relleno burger and the smokehouse burger. Both were run of the mill, chain restaurant burgers. Again, no spiciness on the relleno burger. There is however, a reason this place is called the Cheesecake Factory. The pineapple upside down cheesecake was quite possibly the best dessert I have ever had! If I go back here it will be for dessert only. The restaurant as a whole is relatively clean but someone desperately needs to dust! Huge dining area with each section divided by highly polished wood that is covered in a layer of dust. Obviously neglected for a long period of time.  The atmosphere is very cafeteria like. Very loud! Close seating."
