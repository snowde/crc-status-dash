Nicki M.,"Tampa, FL",43,6,3,3.0,8/4/2015,Seated immediately. Typical Cheesecake Factory....nice wait staff. The chicken on my pasta was dry. Restaurant is noisy as usual. Getting cheesecake to go.
Mel R.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,9,1,2.0,4/13/2014,"Ever since I was a little kid cheesecake factory has been my go to place.  The experience I had last night basically changed that. Firstly, they seated us in a cramped corner near four other couples on both sides of us. It came to the point that everyone kept dropping their silverware because we were so close to each other. To add on top of that, the wait for the food was easily 45 minutes. None of this was a huge problem to me, until the food came out... I ordered their ""famous fish tacos"". They were COLD, TASTLESS, and not to mention there was NO FISH IN THE FISH TACOS.  Let's put it this way, never going back. Ever."
James G.,"Wayne, PA",0,6,,4.0,1/31/2015,"We love the cheese cake factory.  This location is always crowded so go early,  sign in,  then do some shopping at the mall.   They'll text you when your table is ready.  They have done great small plates that are worth sharing.  Try the fried avacodo, it is melt in your mouth delicious.  There are so many choices we usually don't have a problem keeping the children happy.   Of course you have to have the cheesecake for dessert.  That usually keeps the children happy and behaved during dinner.   The Germann chocolate is my favorite because it is full of good chocolate,  but I don't think you can go wrong with any of the cheesecakes."
Diana F.,"Philadelphia, PA",33,204,5,4.0,4/25/2014,"Came in on a Thursday night around 9pm and it wasn't too busy, thankfully, as I often see people waiting out front.  I've had cheesecakes before, but never have I had dinner her, so it was time to give it a try. My husband ordered the fish and chips, which came with coleslaw. He said he liked it, and I have to say, it did look good and not too greasy. I ordered the seared tuna tataki salad from the skinnylicious menu. Only 600 calories or so, if I have to believe the menu. It looked like a really small salad when it came out; however, it was more than enough. It comes with delicious slices of seared tuna, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and a soy sauce dressing.  Obviously, I ordered from the skinnylicious menu because I was saving up for dessert. ;-) I ordered the red velvet cake cheesecake and my husband a chocolate tower something something cheesecake. His was massive and had so many layers. It was very rich in chocolate for sure. Mine was delicious, although I would've preferred more red velvet cake.  I've had the apple caramel streusel before and I liked that one better, but hey, there are so many to try out, it's insane.  Heard good things about their brunch - will go sometime soon."
Shannon M.,"West Berlin, NJ",142,354,21,3.0,7/9/2014,"I have dined at various Cheesecake Factory locations over the years. The food is good, the portions are huge and the service is excellent. All of those details are consistent.  I wasn't particularly impressed this time around, though, because the chicken in my salad had miso sauce on it -- the same sauce on a salmon dish someone at my table ordered. Perhaps someone used the same knife to cut my chicken after they cut my friend's salmon? Gross."
Sarah A.,"New York, NY",164,331,211,4.0,12/6/2012,"My first time ever at a Cheesecake Factory last month. I know, I know, shut up. I've always heard such bad things about this place and I feel like every time I read another ""worst food in America"" article, a dish from this place is on the top of the list. So, honestly, I was expecting a kind of redneck joint with tons of greasy fried foods and nothing but unhealthy, gross options. But I was surprised to see that even though it's got a chain-like decor and ridiculously large menu, it wasn't half bad. They have great selections on their ""skinny"" menu. The chicken tacos were actually amazing -- the ingredients were super fresh and the flavor was just right. And I think for something like 500 calories and $10, you get three good-sized tacos and a big thing of rice. Definitely a good value and calorie count. (I've seen the 2,500+ calorie monstrosities they have in here, stay away!) The edamame was really good too. And what other reason to eat a healthy dinner but to save room for dessert? I mean, it IS the CHEESECAKE Factory, after all. Thank God my brother and his wife and I shared a piece -- they are huge! I think I seriously have dreams about the Godiva slice. Good lord. A woman's dream. Overall, a decent place to come if you're in the mall or close to it and you've got people with different tastes since the menu is so huge. But be prepared for a long wait. And be careful what you order!"
Lauren W.,"Bethlehem, PA",11,74,30,3.0,9/7/2014,"I've been to a couple cheesecake factories and I thought this one was okay. When I got there they said it was a twenty minute wait and it probably ended up being a little less. The table they sat us at was very close to the other tables. I could hear the other table's conversation the whole time. I got the tex-mex egg rolls and they were okay. I thought they were kind of flimsy and not very crunchy. My boyfriend got the orange chicken, which he really liked and the portion was huge. So all and all, not bad but nothing great."
Cara T.,"Glenside, PA",164,167,24,4.0,2/18/2014,Ok....I'm an addict....an addict!!!!!! The cheesecakes are amazing but so so bad for you. But so delicious!!!!! Most people know the deal with the Cheesecake Factory so there isn't much to Yelp about.  Here's the summary: 1. You do not go here without ordering dessert! (This is non-negotiable) 2. You will wait in line...a long time! 3. The menu will be a thick book with never-ending choices 4. The bread will be delicious. Do not fill up on bread. (See #1) 5. You will be indecisive about getting a fancy drink..but you will eventually break down and order that $10 daiquiri  6. You will not finish your main course (See #1) **** Bonus tip!!! Most people don't come for brunch....but they have a classy brunch. Try it sometime!
Hrudaya S.,"Toronto, Canada",70,147,41,4.0,4/22/2014,"I have been to this location twice, and both times it was good.  I love their avocado egg rolls, especially the sauce they come with.  They portion sizes are huge, even the lunch portions. I can barely ever eat half my break, usually I get it boxed for later.  Of course no visit to this place is complete without getting some cheesecake. Yes, they are delectable sugar highs, but worth it every single time. Like any other cheesecake factory location,I would recommend to make reservations. There is always a wait."
Leen W.,"Hershey, PA",6,27,14,1.0,4/13/2014,"This is a review for Cheesecake Factory located at King of Prussia Mall. Blunt, no flavor, below average food and waited for this for 45 minutes jus' to be seated. From reserving our name with the receptionist to the food being served we waited for a little over an hour an half.  We were 2 of us. I guess those that came in groups or families probably had a longer wait time.  I have been to Cheesecake Factorys in Delaware, Virginis Beach, Baltimore and Miami. The one at King of Prussia Mall is worst when it comes to food and service. Please if you can look for other options in the area after shopping do so."
Melissa V.,"Montgomery, PA",11,259,25,5.0,6/30/2015,"I don't write many reviews for chain restaurants but when I read all the rather negative reviews I have to say that I love this place!  I've been going to these restaurants for about 20 years now and recently started going repeatedly, at least a few times a month. True there are many choices in KOP but it's a standout.  The menu is robust with great variety. I love the skinny menu. Some of my favorite things are the summer shrimp rolls, yummy! And I also love the grilled artichoke. I think the service is always excellent especially at the bar (we love Cesar!) Keep doing what you're doing!"
John K.,"Philadelphia, PA",258,573,3523,5.0,8/26/2012,Sure ... it's a chain. Sure it can be considered 'family restaurant.'  Sure doesn't mean it skimps on quality .. and certainly not quantity!  The nostalgia this place brings is second to none (think college dinners funded by friends' parents).  In any case - you always start off with sourdough and honey wheat bread. Wish the butter was soft or at room temp - but they keep it chilled. The bread is usually warmed and fresh 'enough.' Doesn't stop me from usually getting a refill. But the refills do pose a problem ... there is never enough room for the rest of the food!  Start off with Avocado Eggrolls (yum - creamy avocado ... roasted peppers ... crunchy wanton wrapper). I've eaten 20 of these in one sitting when I once had Cheesecake Factory catering ... no joke. Or choose the crispy crab wantons - you just can't go wrong. From there - the problem is that everything for your mains is so good. And my own personal problem is that I can usually never deviate from: 1) Farfalle with Garlic Cream Sauce - Chicken - Pancetta - Peas - Mushrooms. Delicious - creamy - succulent.  2) Louisiana Chicken Pasta - spicy - creamy - chicken - all colors of bell peppers - fried chicken cutlets (4 for the dinner portion!) 3) Burger - they're all delicious!  4) Cheesecake - Red Velvet for the GF does wonders ... Tuxedo Mousse hits the spot for me!  Even I can't finish the food here. But the beautiful thing is - it's amazing heated up the next day!
Carrie P.,"Mullica Hill, NJ",74,149,164,4.0,6/29/2014,"I'm not huge on chain restaurants but this is always a go to.  One updated fact is they will text you when your table is ready so gone are the days you need to stay close with a pager. How refreshing !!  Just know when you come here it's always a wait ( we waited an hour).   Service was great. She was really sweet and attentive. Most of all our service was kind to our daughter.  All our food came out delicious and within a reasonable amount of time. We enjoyed buffalo blasts, chicken lettuce wraps, and tostado salad. My daughter had pasta and meat sauce. We took home a ton of food and Adams peanut butter cheesecake. Yum"
Jo L.,"Philadelphia, PA",20,278,1009,4.0,11/25/2012,"Came here Black Friday night and the wait was an hour and a half but it was worth it! Our waitress was very happy and friendly. She also had good memory! They give a basket of bread and butter in the beginning. We asked for more of the brown bread which was kind of a mistake cause we were pretty full by the time our food came out. We had the Chicken Samosas, Avocado Eggrolls and Stuffed Mushrooms for starters. They were all really yummy! I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms but the sauce it came with was really good. My friend also loves it. For the main course, we had: Famous Factory Meatloaf, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Over the Top Meatloaf sandwich, and some kind of fish and steak. I didn't try all of it but the pasta was SOOO GOOD! Kind of spicy. The meatloaf and the mash potatoes it came with was really good too. Next time I'm shopping at KOP I'd probably stop by. =)"
Dakota S.,"Greenbackville, VA",0,6,3,2.0,10/29/2015,"When we arrived, dirty silverware, then things took a turn for the worse when I found a hair in my chicken avocado club, which was missing avocado, to get avocado at Cheesecake Factory should be easy but not when your waitress is talking for ten minutes with the table across from you and then looks back at your disassembled sandwich and continues her chat across the way, so in short, OKAY food and TERRIBLE service."
Sarah S.,"Philadelphia, PA",16,339,4,5.0,5/17/2014,I'm never disappointed by this place.  The worst part is the wait but we got here on a wednesday at 6pm and got seated right away.  I got the Chicken and Avocado Club and Key Lime Cheesecake.  Both were really good.
Paige B.,"Philadelphia, PA",165,97,335,4.0,9/11/2013,"When I rave about TCF to friends, my enthusiasm is frequently met with a flat response: ""It's a /chain/."" Why is that so bad? My mission is to find great food anywhere. I have no shame in saying that the Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat. The menu is massive, the portions are titanic, and there is no shortage of guaranteed-to-be-excellent dessert choices. This is the best restaurant in the mall by far, and perhaps in King of Prussia. Buffalo Blasts (Chicken, Cheese and Our Spicy Buffalo Sauce all Stuffed in a Spiced Wrapper and Fried until Crisp. Served with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing) - 4.5 out of 5 Chicken Potstickers (Oriental Dumplings Pan-Fried in the Classic Tradition. Served with Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce) - 5 out of 5 Hibachi Steak (Certified Angus Hanger Steak with Shiitake Mushrooms, Onions, Bean Sprouts, Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Tempura Asparagus) - 5 out of 5 Thai Lettuce Wraps (Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew) - 4.5 out of 5 I love the playfulness of this dish. The flavors are all there. -0.5 for the flavorless noodles used as an accompaniment. Why not toss them in some sesame oil and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds? Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos (Butter Lettuce Leaves Filled with Grilled Chicken and Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Cucumber, Cilantro and Rice Noodles with Spicy Cashew Sauce) - A smaller, simpler version of the Thai Lettuce Wraps - 4 out of 5 SkinnyLicious Asian Chicken Salad (Grilled Chicken, Romaine, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Green Onions, Cilantro, Rice Noodles, Wontons, Almonds and Sesame Seeds Served with Sesame-Soy Dressing) - 4 out of 5 Kale Salad (Cranberries, Apples, Marcona Almonds and Green Beans. Tossed with Buttermilk-Black Pepper Dressing.) - 5 out of 5 Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake - 2.5 out of 5 Average. There is only a small amount of cream cheese flavor. The rest of the icing tastes like the generic plain white variety. (There are 10+ cheesecakes that are chocolate/chocolate cake-based; the reason why I ordered the Red Velvet is because it's the /one/ with cream cheese icing.) Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake - 5 out of 5 Amazing. There are so many different flavors  and textures at work: Oreo cookies baked into the creamy cheesecake add a nice textural contrast, pillowy fudge cake that tastes like the cocoa-y cookie, Oreo mousse, milk chocolate icing that teeters on too sweet, and garnished with the familiar crunch of freshly-crumbled Oreos. Dutch Caramel Apple Streusel Cheesecake - 4.5 out of 5 This cake is a cross between a luscious cheesecake and the best apple crumble ever, which is a winning combination in my book. Key Lime Cheesecake - 4.5 out of 5 This cake has a very pronounced tart flavor that cuts the richness of the cake. Every bite is increasingly addictive and leaves you wanting more. The sweetness enrobes the tip of your tongue and the creaminess captures all of your taste buds, leaving the faint taint of fresh lime and tartness to refresh your palate. The macaroon crust is a nice departure from the pedestrian graham cracker. Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake - 2 out of 5 I'd hoped that this would be my favorite cheesecake, but it was quite disappointing as it tasted too artificial. I would suggest adding some brûléed fresh pineapple, or some acidic component, to wake up the flavors."
Ravneet D.,"Downingtown, PA",0,33,5,4.0,6/8/2015,Great food okay service. Can't blame the waiter since it's so busy but overall good time
Keren R.,"Brooklyn, NY",133,77,32,4.0,4/27/2015,"We came in very late one night to enjoy a dinner. The server was very polite and friendly. She took our orders in a timely fashion and was able to assist us and have a small conversation. The food was wonderful and filling. Sadly even with our single small portions, we were full we couldn't enjoy a cheesecake of any kind. Why I selected 4 stars instead of 5 is because the floor was very slippery. I slipped and nothing was done about it since I didn't fall."
Karen M P.,"Chester, PA",5,1,13,3.0,6/6/2014,"I really love The Cheese Cake Factory, great service. This is the first time I wasn't happy with my meal. I ordered fish tacos and it wasn't good at all, VERY BLAND!"
