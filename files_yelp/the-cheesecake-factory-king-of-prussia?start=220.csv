Dan P.,"Philadelphia, PA",12,26,,4.0,11/30/2014,Always have an amazing time here. I haven't gotten a dish I didn't like. Cheesecake is always phenomenal. Not bad for prices either.
Jane S.,"Phoenixville, PA",3,60,14,4.0,8/16/2015,"I've been here a number of times, but was not looking forward to returning.  Had hoped they had started to take reservations, but no.  So the possibility of an hour wait on a Friday night was not what I wanted.  Surprisingly the wait was only 10 minutes.  I'm also not a fan of their menu which is mostly fried or heavy on sauces and cheese.  However they have some new lighter options.  I had the Salmon salad and the salmon was perfectly cooked and delicious.  The salad was large, heavy on the kale, lightly dressed and delicious as well.  My partner had the chicken and steak combo, which is why we were there.  It was also very good.  I don't know how they do it.  The restaurant is large and very busy, but the food has always been fresh and well prepared.  We passed on dessert, even though that case of beautiful cakes is hard to resist.  So entering with a bad attitude, I left happy.  BTW, they have passed on the large pagers and now text you when your table is ready."
Heather S.,"Norristown, PA",170,115,4,4.0,6/12/2013,"My friends and I frequent the Cheesecake Factory for both Sunday brunch and dinner.  We went again this past Sunday night, and I still have very little to complain about. There were three of us and we were able to get seated right away at 5 pm. I have to say this is rare as there is usually a wait, but I guess because it was nice outside, people were down the shore or grilling.  Of the 25 or so times I've been to Cheesecake, I only had one dish I really did not like (the breakfast burrito for brunch one morning). I usually order the same dish, Chicken Costoletta, and it is delicious every time. The portion size is always enough to have dinner the following night and the price is beyond reasonable for the amount of food you get. I tried the blue cheese and pear flat bread this past trip and while the flat bread could have had a little bit more topping on it, overall it was not bad for $4.95. The cheesecake is always huge and delicious. I normally don't get cheesecake but was in the mood for something sweet. My boyfriend and I shared the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake (to go), and it was divine. I only ate about 1/3 of it as it was more than enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I definitely recommend sharing the cheesecake with 1-2 people as it is way to much for 1 person to eat. I recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a quick sit-down meal without a lot of privacy. The restaurant is usually loud and crowded and the tables are on top of one another (unless you're lucky enough to get a booth). The outdoor area though is good to check out during the warmer months and not as crowded or loud."
Tatiana M.,"King of Prussia, PA",6,12,1,3.0,11/30/2014,Dessert was the only thing I liked I got vanilla bean cheesecake and red velvet. Food was ok I got a chicken dish. Not what I expected. But maybe I'll get pasta next time . Huge menu . Very long wait. Service was ok . I'll try again during lunch may be it won't be so busy.
Patti A.,"Pottstown, PA",1,6,,3.0,2/20/2015,"Went here with my husband, after work earlier this week and it was okay.  The place was crowded, the staff always appeared preoccupied with their tasks, and it was LOUD.  The floor is solid, the ceilings are high, and everything has a hard surface.  Sound just bounces around the room.  We were seated near a server station, so we were (un)luncky enough to hear the servers opinions of other diners, which was not always positive. We didn't have to wait too long, just 10 minutes, so that wasn't bad at all. Our server was pleasant. The menu is too large and included ads.  Really?? Couldn't we cut back on a few menu pages and skip the ads?  It shouldn't feel like I am reading a magazine - it is a menu!  And everything is in the menu - pages of drinks, pages of lunch items, pages of appetizers, etc.  It just goes on and on.   Drinks were good, service was timed nicely.  But the food - it was okay - but the portions are too large - waaaay too large!  My chicken Marsala was enough for three large meals.  And while it had mushrooms, it would be nice if it was served with a vegetable.  I received a platter of pasta, chicken, and mushrooms (and a stick of parsley that was all stem and one leaf).  Some steamed broccoli or green beans would have been nice visually as well as to balance out the meal.  Needless to say, we had leftovers to take home. We took home some cheesecake...do they really think that after eating such a huge portion of food that people will have room for dessert?? But the cheesecake was very nice.  The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake had too much whipped layer and not enough cheesecake, but still overall it was a nice chocolate dessert. I think that in the future, if I went again, I would get one entree, a side of veg. and some cheesecake (definitely) but I would order it to go.  That would still be a huge meal for two people but I could enjoy it in the quiet of my home.  Overall, the food was okay, not GREAT but not bad.   Everything seems fresh, and with such a huge menu, that in itself is amazing and must be possible due to the high volume of diners. The prices are high and appear to be somewhat a-la-cart.  If you want a salad or vegetable, you need to order it.   The atmosphere is casual but loud and crowded."
Jaime Lyn C.,"Kimberton, PA",94,45,,5.0,8/29/2013,"Everything here is phenomenal.  I have yet to order something here that I did not like. This is my #1 lunch choice for when I am near the KOP area.  I normally order the Cobb Salad (lunch portion) and I love it.  The sliders are amazing, and so are the fries.  Huge turkey club, awesome fried zucchini and fresh hummus. The mango iced tea and raspberry lemonade are always my drink choices.  Portions are HUGE and the bread that they serve pre-meal is delish. Of course every slice of cheesecake is heaven.  LOVE THIS PLACE."
Monica L.,"Orefield, PA",18,5,4,1.0,5/9/2014,Worst experience at this location! After waiting an hour to be seated we ordered immediately only to have to wait another hour for food. We asked for the burgers to be cooked well done but when they arrived they were medium not even close to well done. We had to find the waiter because he was no where to be found and informed him of the issue. He brought his manager over and all he could say was it takes time for a burger to be cooked and I don't know what more I can do for you. Poor customer service especially as a manager you should know better. I will never go back to this restaurant because of the bad experience I had here. I am being nice giving this place a star.
Diane M.,"Elkins Park, PA",0,2,,5.0,12/9/2015,"Wow! What great service and the food was Sooo good. My daughter an I stopped by for a light bight to eat after shopping in the mall. But, you no that there is no light bight really to be had because all the food is so over the top yummy. They need wheel barrels to move you out after eating. Wonderful food and awesome device."
Richard K.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,218,1125,3.0,8/4/2012,"It's been awhile since I visited the Cheesecake Factory, and now I remember why.  There's nothing particularly wrong with this restaurant chain.  It has a Disney-esque decor and ambiance, and it has a a good staff (Dijana, our server was enthusiastic to the point of being perky, efficient, and helpful: very professional) and good food, BUT, in the end, it feels more like an amp'd up version of Appleby's or TGIF. As I mentioned already, the food is good, but not great.  As Gordon Ramsay would likely point out, it has too many items on the menu, trying to provide something for everybody, so nothing I've eaten at this restaurant chain has been memorable in my mind.  Case in point:  I had Jambalaya with linguini this evening: an interesting twist, but the linguini came out too wet and mushy, having been drenched in the Jambalaya sauce too long.  It was good and acceptable, but not something I would have paid ~$17 in retrospect.  I asked for an extra dry Grey Goose martini with extra olives:  I only got three (not four or five as I would have received at other restaurants). And of course, the biggest problem for me: they don't take reservations.  Perhaps, they do this to purposefully create a crowd swarming inside and outside the restaurant, i.e., to create a buzz, to inflate the anticipation of the waiting clientale, but it does not work for me.  I hate having to wait among the throngs of people outside, and I hate the crowd of people milling around inside the restaurant. Why did I come here this evening?  My kids still enjoy it, and they certainly love the cheesecake.  Perhaps, it's the thing to do after spending the day at the mall;, e.g., it's more about the entertainment, rather than the culinary, experience.  As long as you recognize and understand what you're paying for, it's OK."
Susan P.,"Orefield, PA",0,12,2,4.0,1/8/2016,Very good food. We will go back. Would have given it 5 stars but service was very slow. Waited 40 minutes for dinner. We were compensated with free desserts though.
Jen W.,"Bethlehem, PA",20,153,40,5.0,7/10/2014,"I got a ""small"" salad and soup and it was the size of a newborn baby. I had the portabella mushroom - avocado - zucchini fries and they were SUPERB. Thai rolls were good. Everyone's portion was equal to the size of Olympus, which confirms why America is fat - in a good way (if there is a good way). Ordered an Original and a Key Lime cheesecake to go and it was delicious. I'd come again!"
Desmond B.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,1,,3.0,1/4/2014,"The finale of a day of shopping at the King of Prussia mall is not complete without the obligatory stop by the Cheesecake Factory. Essentially the very last store in the mall, the Cheesecake Factory provides a great embiance and environment for a family meal or date.  That is, if you can ensure waiting the customary 30 minutes to 2 hours to be seated. With the exception of opening hours, you can expect to wait in order to be seated. The layout of the restaurant gives the appearance that it is incredibly large, but this leads to the deception you may encounter during your visit.  The restaurant is deep in size, but incredibly narrow. This narrow design means you are forced to interact with the wait staff as they attempt to maneuver around you with other patrons' platters. Despite these handicaps, the service is expediant and the customer service is excellent. In my humble greedy opinion, the food is great and the pallette is large enough for everyone in your party.  So if you are ever in the area and have time to wait for a great meal, stop by the Cheesecake Factory in the king of Prussia mall!"
Rita C.,"Philadelphia, PA",120,309,11,3.0,2/21/2013,"Cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory - WIN Food at The Cheesecake Factory - FAIL I've been here a couple of times in my life, but usually it's so packed outside with people waiting for tables that I just stroll on by.  (Note - They don't take reservations at all!)   A couple of my girlfriends and I decided to meet up for dinner one night, so we ended up at The Cheesecake factory.  The bread they brought out was delicious and warm, so the meal was off to a good start.  The menu is really all over the place, so it takes a little bit to really pick out what you want.  I decided on the crusted chicken romano with pasta.  The pasta portion of the meal was quite large, but was a little dry - definitely could have used some more sauce.  The chicken was pounded flat, but had really good flavors.  All-in-all, it wasn't a bad meal, but I've definitely had better.  My friends got the salmon and four cheese pasta with chicken.  Didn't hear any complaints from them! Now on to the main event - dessert.  I went with the PB Cup Fudge Ripple and it was by far one of the most glorious things I've ever seen.  The slice of cheesecake was very generous and the flavor was amazing.   I'll definitely be back for some dessert in the future!"
Sunia T.,"Manhattan, NY",76,160,,2.0,5/5/2012,"I strongly dislike how this Cheesecake Factory is doing things because clearly something is wrong. They do not take reservations and people are constantly camped outside of it like teenage girls camping out to see their favorite boy band. It's just cheesecake factory, a 5 hour wait on a good day is just unacceptable. I think cheesecake factory is a great chain that never disappoints but this one is in dire need of allowing people to make reservations to fix the mess outside of it. People are literally sitting on the floor in a line outside and this particular one is located in one of the classiest and upscale malls in America. Simply ridiculous."
Fan L.,"Ottawa, Canada",6,28,179,4.0,8/19/2013,"The lady from next table suggested the Asian Lettuce Wrap Tacos were wonderful! The other dished were not bad also. And of cause ,the original cheesecake ,GREAT with no doubt !"
Scott B.,"Philadelphia, PA",86,74,27,5.0,9/9/2012,"Just like every other Cheesecake Factory I've been to.  Great service, never longer than a 45 minute wait.  It's attached to the mall so you can shop around while you wait.  Cheesecake is amazing.   However it take a while to get a piece to go if you don't get a seat because the ""cake people"" are busy working on orders from dine-in customers and often neglect walk-ups. I always ask the waiter/waitress to bring a piece to go so I can enjoy it later that night.  PORTION ARE VERY LARGE."
Nicholas U.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,12,,1.0,12/14/2015,"My least favorite restaurant of the many in the KOP area. Really don't understand why people wait so long for mediocre food. Yes, they have a lot of flavors of cheesecake - but certainly not the best I have ever tasted. I avoid the place at all costs."
Pat L.,"Bala Cynwyd, PA",0,30,,4.0,10/24/2014,"Whenever I am in King of Prussia, I ALWAYS have to stop at Cheesecake Factory! The Kobe burger is always spot-on, and my wife always has to have her Chinese Chicken Salad!! Service is always good when we dine in and the cheesecakes...enough said!!"
Christine L.,"Lansdale, PA",64,13,1,2.0,12/1/2014,"After waiting for 20 minutes, we took our seats and were greeted by our server. We told her nicely that we were there for coffee and dessert, and she pretty much rolled her eyes at us. Needless to say, we ordered our coffee and dessert and ate it quickly. Not sure if I'll be back."
Lan H.,"Ambler, PA",22,164,87,4.0,2/16/2013,"As many other Yelpers will tell you, the wait is worth it.  Oh, there were doubts.  There were many giver-uppers, and I don't blame them.  It's a Friday night, late dinner is inevitable, and you (and your company) are HUNGRY.  I pouted, moaned, groaned, and repeat.  But let me tell you, as long as you act smart and not try to go too far out of your comfort zone with your meal, then you will have a satisfying dining experience at The Cheesecake Factory.  For appetizers, we had Fried Mac and Cheese.  Oh yeah, it trumps a healthier Mac and Cheese dish because you're just having a morsel, it's not the main course.  Don't go too overboard even though they only give you four...the balls are HUGE... ...and that's what she said XD.   Anywho, had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  So NOT the most lavishing and complicated dish on the menu.  In fact, it's one of the least lavishing and complicated.  GOOD, because it was done very well for my palate, and I enjoyed every bite of it.  I remember the last time I was at the same Cheesecake Factory - I had a salad, and, let me tell you, I got LOST in the flavors.  I am one to always try and finish salads at a restaurants, because they get watery when you take the leftovers home.  It's by personal preference, but I did not prefer the huge portions. Enough of ranting about the past, this is the PRESENT, and the cheesecakes still looked too pretty to eat!  Four slices for a grand total of $30.06 plus tax.  Haha, enjoying the desserts right now...of course, not by myself, but, well, I need to have my share :P   Thank you for the memorable dining experience, Cheesecake Factory :-)"
