Francesca G.,"Exton, PA",0,20,,1.0,10/10/2015,"Ordered curbside pickup. They didn't have any turkey to offer due to something that came down from corporate. Nbd, I order an almond crusted salmon salad, my man gets a crispy chicken sandwich. We each order a slice of cheesecake. (Godiva/snickers). We ate around 8pm. At 3am I'm in the bathroom puking, my BF is in the other bathroom also not doing well. We've both been ill all day thanks to the mediocre dinner from this joint. Never again."
Charlie L.,"Seattle, WA",119,687,97,4.0,12/15/2010,"I had not been a fan of the cheesecake factory all my life, but it has grown on me over the years... i am not too sure I am that much of a fan of any of the entree dishes, but I can eat the appitizers all day long.  It's good, it's got lots of selections, and it's consistently above average. A great default selection."
Jessica B.,"Conshohocken, PA",4,22,,2.0,12/19/2013,"The cheesecake is great, obviously! My family, friends and I go there often because of their expansive menu which works for all types of pallets and individuals.  The entrees aren't anything special but we consistently come back for the deserts and appetizers."
Evan B.,"Edgewood, KY",5,82,56,5.0,9/25/2014,Had two meals here during my recent visit to KOP area.  Both meals were great and the service was spot on.  Huge menu with plenty to choose from.  This place does it right.
Mike A.,"Norristown, PA",1021,137,48,3.0,4/7/2014,This place has gone down hill.  The menu has always been too big.  The food there lately has only been okay.  They lost spice and flavor in many of their dishes. Not usually worth the wait.
Annette K.,"Slatington, PA",0,7,,3.0,11/8/2014,"The wait was long, about a hour, on a Saturday around 3:00 pm. We walked around the mall to keep ourselves busy, as we knew this would happen.  The service was good. She (unfortunately I forget her name) was prompt and helpful with questions about the menu. The menu/food: Well.. I got the crab cake bites and they were all dough (big disappointment). My boyfriend got the cheese garlic bread and definitely was not worth $9. He was not a fan, I didn't have an opinion either way. When he he told the waitress he wasn't fond of it and it wasn't what he thought it would be, our waitress did not offer him something else. That threw me off, as other places typically ask ""is there something else I can get you instead?"". I ordered a martini. A (unknown to me and shame on me for ever ordering it) twelve dollar martini. Holy shit.  So our food arrives. My pasta is undercooked and still starchy/paste-y and it was a good size portion. I also added shrimp for a six dollar up charge. His steak was ok. Nothing great. We order our cheesecake to go and had it the next day. That too, we were not impressed with. Over all, our expectations were high and we were pretty let down. The only reason I am giving it three stars is because of our waitress. To make it worse.. this was our anniversary dinner. We will not be returning."
Vette M.,"Willingboro, NJ",0,53,,3.0,8/14/2015,"Nice place to stop for a leisurely lunch because there's usually a bit of a wait. Most of the sandwiches, burgers, and salads are pretty good. The entrees are hit or miss for the most part. The staff are pretty friendly and efficient. The cheesecake is pretty good too. Always ask for a booth.  The noise level is pretty high and you'll thank me later when you can hear your dining companion."
Janet E.,"Chicago, IL",1121,2033,899,4.0,12/7/2009,"I love the Cheesecake factory, but their portions are way too huge for me.  I can only eat half of my dish and it feels like such a waste to throw the rest out.  I'd take the leftovers with me if I werent living in a hotel room the rest of the week.  Thats why I think its great they are offering small plates! I dont know if this is new or not, but I noticed it on the menu and decided to order from it. I ordered the crispy artichoke hearts and the asparagus salad.  The artichoke hearts came out fresh from the oven! Our waiter had to rework his towel so that he didnt burn himself or me when putting the plate down on the table.  The dipping sauce was creamy and delicious! The asparagus salad was very flavorful. It had chopped tomatoes, lemon juice, and fresh parmesan cheese. I was able to finish both small plates without leaving the restaurant feeling uncomfortably full. There was 5 of us and we didnt have to wait for a table. Awesome! Service was good too! Our waitress was always refilling our drinks and checked up on us frequently."
Haboo Z.,"Harrisburg, PA",0,107,16,3.0,6/9/2015,"Overall I like The Cheesecake Factory. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. On our most recent visit, my hubby ordered the mushroom swiss burger and he said it wasn't bad. I ordered the chicken and biscuit dinner because it sounded awesome in the menu description. The portion was substantial, however it was not as good as I expected it to be. The chicken was cooked well, and the gravy had a nice flavor. I was disappointed in the vegetable medley (carrots, peas, and mushrooms). It reminded me of something I could make at home from a can. Honestly, I think I could have done better. I was expecting fluffy, buttery, biscuits but they were hard as a rock and I had to bury them under my chicken so they would soften up. I would not order that dish again. After dinner, we shared a piece of the oreo cheesecake which was great. Next time, I am sticking to the obvious and going there for cheesecake only!"
Chris A.,"Havertown, PA",8,504,87,2.0,10/31/2012,"Food: 3 Decor: 2.5 Ambiance: 2 Service:2.5 Value: 2.5 I will never understand the suburban obsession with Cheesecake Factory. The cheesecakes are good, yes, but you don't have to wait in the mall outside the restaurant for an hour and a half to get them. The food otherwise is mediocre and expensive."
M S.,"Oakland, CA",0,2,4,1.0,7/5/2015,"This rating is primarily for the service since the food is pretty much consistently good at any of the Cheesecake Factory locations I've been in.  I went last Friday at 3pm.  My husband and I had the menus open at the lunch options page and proceeded to order Grilled Salmon and Pasta Carbonara.  Imagine my surprise when we got the check which was significantly more than expected.  The waiter didn't even bother to ask whether we wanted the lunch or dinner portions, but we assumed he put it as lunch since it was still early and our menus were open to that page.  I just felt cheated and felt like the waiter purposely put in the more expensive option in order to get a higher tip.  The Carbonara didn't even look like it was dinner portion."
Stephanie F.,"Luzerne County, PA",2,4,,4.0,6/29/2014,The food is always delicious and it also had outdoor seating which is a huge plus for the warmer months. What is great is that they are open late on the weekends until 12:30am. The only problem that we ran into late at night is that the staff want to go home and become antsy and it shows. We didn't get our complementary bread basket and we saw around 12:00 another couple getting seated and the waitress have the hostess a lot of attitude for it in front of other customers. We have never had a bad experience except for that night and that's why I give it 4 stars.
Jon G.,"Lemoyne, PA",11,37,11,2.0,4/1/2014,"For me this place has been very inconsistent. Sometimes it is decent, better at lunch, but other times it really misses. They don't seem able to cook a piece of fish  less than extra well done. I just finished a piece of salmon that left much to be desired. It was better for lunch last week but still over done. Perhaps the sandwiches and pastas are better."
Steve E.,"Reading, PA",0,9,,3.0,9/18/2013,"I know...I know, it's a Cheesecake Factory! The food was delicious as expected with any of these locations. If I were rating on the food alone, I would have given 4 stars...but I am not rating on just the food. I sat at the bar for dinner as I am traveling for work. There were two bartenders and both were very nice, but if the female bartender called me Hun one more time I might have lost it. I give her credit for being attentive, but she just laid it on too thick for my liking. I don't know too many people that like much of a fake attitude."
Maruko X.,"Los Angeles, CA",1151,1704,12610,4.0,9/29/2011,"I have been to this one several times, so far no disappointment yet. :P"
Ebbs S.,"Norristown, PA",0,4,,2.0,6/8/2015,"Poor customer service wait staff and hostesses. Food (salad) was yucky as usual.  I really only go for the cake but after being treated poorly, I decided to pass. Arrived at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon. They took my cell number and told me there was a 5-10 minute wait. 30 minutes later they text. I show up (walked from DSW) down the hall. They said I was late and on hold ( apparently you have only a few minutes to show up - it took me 5 mins and 3 seconds). They hostess snapped at me and the server was extremely rude. We stayed quiet because we didn't want spit in our food. Never Again!"
E Peter D.,"Bayside, NY",2,67,68,5.0,6/28/2012,I have to say I was surprised. Great burgers that were actually cooked to order and not overpriced.  Obviously the cheesecake is delicious. We had the Hershey cheesecake that had cake surrounding cheesecake and covered with syrup and chocolate chips.  How can you go wrong with that?
Roz H.,"San Jose, CA",245,154,8,5.0,8/3/2013,There was a wait as usual but it was worth it. We were seated outside on a gorgeous night. Food was good. Loved our waitress.
Kelly M.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,9,6,3.0,6/11/2012,"Cheesecake factory is a star above a chain; great menu and prices with huge (beyond huge) portions.  Their food presentation is great, then the taste is just mediocre. Nothing to wow about, but def good enough to go back. The chicken lettuce wraps were on average of most I've tasted. The burrito I got was the size and weight of my chihuahua..really it was, but it was bland and dry.  Their artichoke hearts are wonderful."
James S.,"Harleysville, PA",159,491,497,4.0,7/24/2011,"Some how I've never gotten to dine at a Cheesecake Factory until last week.  I was always under the impression that it was going to be really expensive but boy was wrong.  Everything here is surprisingly affordable.  Oh and by the way, the menu is huge, and when I say huge, I mean enormous. I'm pretty sure there were three pages of appetizers and about 5 pages of entrees.  Incredible.  It did take quite awhile to pick something to eat out of all the options.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta and my fiance ordered the Thai chicken pasta.  Both were pretty good, but what shocked me the most was the size of these plates.  I left with half my meal in a to go box.  Oh yea and the cheesecakes are amazing.  We also left with about half of desserts in a to go box as well.  So much food, not very expensive.  May get crowded, but a pretty good option if you're in KOP."
