Evelyn M.,"Harleysville, PA",0,1,,4.0,6/23/2014,"The chicken Caesar salad here is by far my favorite dish. It is a very large portion, and is incredibly satisfying. Even better than the food was the service. Our server, Denise, was incredibly helpful and a pleasure to talk with. I will certainly be returning - and requesting Denise as a server!"
Nick B.,"Fairfax, VA",103,260,16,4.0,8/9/2011,"Not a bad restaurant. Yes, it's a chain, but for the couple of times I've been here:  1. Food has always tasted very good and served at the appropriate temperature (which is important because you don't want soggy french fries!) 2. Service has been decent. 3. I haven't had to wait 2+ hours to be seated (when there's only 2 people, your chances of getting seated quickly are pretty good.) Sure, you're going to pay $40+ for a meal for two, including a single slice of cheesecake...but if you choose something like the Red Velvet Cheesecake, you won't be disappointed!"
Shawn R.,"Paoli, PA",60,93,,5.0,11/8/2011,"Expect a long wait but it is worth it once you sit down.  My favorite dish is the crusted chicken romano.  You will easily have leftovers and will be able to get a couple of meals out of it.  The drink selection has a lot of fun fruity vodka choices.  I love their lemonades as I have a strong sweet tooth.  Be warned, the lemonades are sweet. Of course, you can't leave this restaurant without checking out the cheesecakes.  Red velvet is too die for and you might as I have yet to check out how many calories are in it.  Despite the cheesecake choices, the restaurant offers up a fantastic chocolate cake."
Nick H.,"Arlington, VA",146,92,1,2.0,11/20/2011,"Unimaginative, bland, apathetic food. Portions are oversized. The menu is waayyyyy too long.  The one good thing is that the urinal geyser'd water everywhere when flushed, which provided far more amusement than the food."
Emily D.,"Upper Darby, PA",7,25,7,5.0,3/14/2014,"I have never once had a bad meal here. You better go starving because the portions are HUGE. Try to share food or you'll be taking home tons if leftovers .. I don't mind it because you're paying the price and you're getting what you pay for! The menu is also huge, there is something for everyone! If it's your first time here- it can get overwhelming. There is pretty much always a wait. I've waited anywhere from 10 minutes to two hours. They take no reservations. The service is so fast and professional. I adore this place! Always come for special occasions"
Kathy W.,"Malvern, PA",0,5,1,4.0,3/11/2014,I am surprised so many people were waiting for vacant seat. We bought a cake slice called 'Chris' something. It's chocolate flavor with walnut covered on side. The cheese cake tastes good but  too sweet for me. Next time I want to take something less sweet.
Alex V.,"Wayne, PA",109,353,54,2.0,1/7/2011,"My last review of this place was four stars, but I have to downgrade it after visiting it several times since my last review. The food quality and execution is down from a few years ago. My last trip was for lunch and it was a bad experience. I got the Renee's special, which is a soup, sandwich, and salad.  My soup was tasteless, except for the overabundance of salt. It reminded me of something I got from the can in the 80's. The chicken salad sandwich was covered in this greasy bread that had to have a 1/2 of stick of butter in it. Finally, the Caesar salad was way too cold, suggesting it was pre-made sitting in the fridge. To top it off, it was absolutely smothered in cheese. I think there was more cheese than lettuce. Absolutely gross.  You can do a lot worse than the Cheesecake Factory at the mall, but its not a place I will look forward to going to anymore."
Tina C.,"Reading, PA",193,161,7,4.0,4/11/2012,I really enjoy the Cheesecake Factory. People say its overrated and overpriced but I really disagree. I think the food is great and it is always a good time!  Servers are areally on top of their game too. Very helpful and very knowledgeable on the menu. They give you plenty of food so you will always have lunch the next day! Portions are great for what your paying. I love the turkey club sandwich and the dynamite (i think thats what its called?) shrimp! Very tasty! The vanilla bean cheesecake is to die for and so is the strawberry infused vodka martini.  Definitely try it out! Very good.   WARNINGl be prepared to wait at any time! this place is always croweded and there is always a wait! I think well worth the wait though! :-)
Tim M.,"Merced, CA",92,111,2,4.0,2/10/2011,"So this is a chain so I can't expect much, right?  Wrong.  First off, even my coke was amazing.  When I got a refill I got a NEW lemon wedge.  Most places don't do that.  I did not even ask. Samosa app was good, but I could not identify sauce.  Chicken carbonara was good, but chicken was dry.  Bacon awesome, and enough sauce to hide chicken deficiency. Waiter was very friendly and knew his stuff.  Could tell us page numbers of menu items.  I also liked the bathrooms.  Felt like I was in a suite in Vegas."
Megan S.,"Birdsboro, PA",0,31,,5.0,3/16/2015,I love this place! Not too expensive and it's nice. They have a good menu and lots of cheesecake. If you go on a weekend there is typically an hour+ wait to be seated
Stephanie H.,"Narberth, PA",18,33,,4.0,2/6/2014,"For a chain restaurant, it's a decent experience. Ton on menu choices which always begs the question how can you face do many variations and still be good? Overall it's good food. Portions are huge so be prepared to take home leftovers. Dessert is the best part. Service is hit or miss but typically ok. Lighter menu is a great addition. Good value."
Claire O.,"Philadelphia, PA",87,129,6,3.0,10/29/2010,"I come here way more often than is necessary, usually at the behest of an overgrown baby suffering from cravings. This location is huge but almost always packed, even during weekday lunch hours. It doesn't help that they don't take reservations, so you're probably going to end up waiting, especially if you come for dinner. One thing about the food is that the portions are enormous. Almost everyone here leaves with a takeout box (except for aforementioned giant baby because he eats everything). Try to come for lunch where the portions are smaller and prices cheaper if you're not a huge eater. I do like the miso salmon entree and tuna carpaccio appetizer. The herb-crusted salmon was not so good and aesthetically very unappealing (it looked like a turd, really). The house salad with balsamic vinaigrette is good, but I'm not sure how you can really go wrong with that. The cheesecakes are very good, though. I loooove the key lime. I'd recommend this place to big eaters who don't mind waiting or spending a bit. There's a lot to choose from which can be hard if you're indecisive. But expect everything to be satisfying, even if it's not mind-blowing."
Erik B.,"Philadelphia, PA",22,9,,3.0,10/10/2014,This is a review more for the sidewalk out front of the restaurant. I haven't actually been inside but I walk past every day. The other day I was walking past and just as I got forty feet from the restaurant I stepped in gum. This just makes my whole experience with this sidewalk even worse. Two months ago I tripped while looking on my phone and had to act like I was running until I was far enough from the restaurant that no one could see me stop. Then about a year ago (my first time walking on this sidewalk) I saw this really cute guy but I haven't seen him since so I think he picked a new sidewalk to walk on... I think this is just the last straw for this sidewalk. (I gave an extra star because there is a restaurant nearby).
Paul L.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,155,88,4.0,10/13/2010,"Ok. I might get discredited as a Yelper but truth be told, I'm a bit of a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, it's a chain store, but they are a chain store for a reason and judging by the crowd gathering here every weekend and the 45~60 minutes waiting time to get a table, a whole lot of people seem to agree with me. They have an impressive extensive menu with more than 200 items aiming to please as many specific tastes as possible. Ranges from salads, burger, sandwich, pizza and pasta, to your more exotic appetizers, seafood and more substantial steak and chops, but of course, you'd want to leave room for desserts.  My all-time favorite dish at the Cheesecake Factory has got to be their Thai Lettuce Wraps. In my rather short lifespan, I have yet to taste a better lettuce wrap. Grilled chicken with peanuts and rice vermicelli wrapped in lettuce with three different and delicious sauces to dip them in. Yum. The portion of the dish is also quite big and if you're ordering cheesecakes afterwards, you can share these wraps with a friend and get full from it.  My other favorite dishes include Pasta Da Vinci with mushrooms, chicken in a creamy Madeira sauce. their grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich and their Farmhouse Cheeseburger with grilled pork belly and a fried egg. As much as I respect their offering of other cakes and ice cream sundaes, this is the Cheesecake Factory. I think a lot of people who waits outside will agree with me that we are here for the cheesecakes. To state my favorite one here is a bit unfair since there is no wrong answers and we each like different things. But... the Banana Cream Cheesecake is king!  I tend to stay away from the overtly sweet cheesecakes and the banana cream is just perfect. Mild, creamy, enough banana flavoring to stand out and be harmonious with the cheese and crust. I really love it.  Even though Legal Seafood is a great addition to the mall, Cheesecake Factory is still a great restaurant choice in King of Prussia."
Terri H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",28,83,22,5.0,9/24/2011,"Not my first time by far, but we were at the mall and decided to have a dessert.  The wait was under 15 minutes, and service was adequate.  For the first time I had red velvet cheesecake. I am simply in LOVE.  Even with a caloric hit of 1250 calories per slice... Amazing."
Elena M.,"Abington, PA",37,237,45,4.0,10/25/2010,"This location is busy CONSTANTLY. Put your name in, expect a wait and go across the way to Urban Outfitters to browse through ironic shirts and funky books.  My friend S and I ordered waaaaaaaaaaay too much food but we love it here and lost our minds! We ordered nachos to start. A giant plate (which I swear was bigger then in previous visits) loaded with pico de gallo, guacamole with huge chunks of avocado and jalapeno slices. (It usually comes with sour cream too but we had them leave it off.) The cheese is melty and delicious and the chips crispy and salty. The perfect nachos. We ordered from their ""small plates"" menu for our meals. Our table was far too small for the number of dishes we got. Also keep in mind their small plates aren't as small as you think they are! I got crab and artichoke dip, crab balls and the endive salad. S got crab and artichoke dip (we could totally have split this), zucchini sticks and the arugala salad. We both finished the salads, got about half way through the dip and took the zucchini sticks and crab balls home! At least there will be yummy leftovers for T. :) I also took a slice of Adam's peanut butter ripple cheesecake to go. Can't leave without a piece of that! The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is the location. It's ALWAYS crowded and if you travel 10-15 minutes down the Turnpike you can go to the Willow Grove location with minimal fuss. Definitely looking forward to being near that location after the upcoming move!!"
Colin P.,"Scranton, PA",94,226,309,4.0,9/7/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I've eaten at four different locations and the service is always above average to excellent, the portions always enormous, the atmosphere always lively, and the wait time for a table always excessive. They really have the business down to a science. You should see how fast and efficient the table flipping process is... the seats are always warm. The menu is a mile long, which always means a lot of thinking and deciding and re-deciding for someone like myself; however, I've never felt rushed and any questions I've had have been answered fully on the spot by the knowledgeable waitstaff. I usually test servers to see if they're paying attention to me by asking for a water with lime, and TCF servers have always passed. I realize this is a subtle detail that isn't hard to execute, but you'd be amazed how many have failed. The sweet dark wheat/oat bread is delicious, and the avocado eggrolls are amazing. You must try them. Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp, one of their ""Thai"" dishes, is very tasty and the portion is large enough to constitute three medium size portions. In fact, most of the entrees are sized that way. The ""Vietnamese"" tacos were very tasty and presented very nicely - they came on a strange, delicious, semi-sweet, steamed folded ""bun"" which was unlike anything I have seen. ""Chicken Bellagio"" is a new-ish menu item, and it does not disappoint - if you like creamy + basil, get this dish. Their claim to fame is cheesecake, of course, and there are dozens of options in this area as well. You should deliberately stop eating other courses in order to indulge in something sweet. Red Velvet is a newer addition to the menu and I recommend it along with Fresh Banana and Carrot Cake Cheesecake, to name only a few. The non-cheesecake options are very good as well, so don't feel like you have to order cheesecake just because of where you are... the limoncello torte is excellent. Some people give TCF flak because of the average length of time it takes to get a table, claiming it's not worth waiting... this is not a valid basis to issue a one-star rating. It is basic economics - limited supply of seats (and this place is huge) and high demand from widely-set diners. They also locate themselves in more upscale destination-type malls and shopping districts that are always bustling with people. One thing I don't like is that the two-seat tables are usually situated in a strip of tables consisting of a very long bench on one side and armless chairs on the other. These tables are very close to each other and it is not easy to have a private conversation, even though the noise level is usually off the chart. Two people can order three appetizers and one slice of cheesecake and still have to roll themselves out the door, without having to spend an arm or leg (although you might still need to remove them in order to leave)."
Leila A.,"West Chester, PA",171,76,74,4.0,7/22/2013,New 'Skinnylicious' menu available - lots of choices under 500 calories. Always very crowded here - which I guess is a good thing.
Kristi M.,"San Antonio, TX",11,25,23,5.0,8/23/2014,"Party of 6 first time here. The wait was estimated at an hour and fifteen but was more like two hours. Once we got seated our waiter Shane showed up to take our drink orders. Friendly and prompt I have no complaints, he got drinks refilled and bread too despite how busy the place was. Our food took a little while but the portions were nice and all the food was cooked perfectly and were very well presented. I had the combo plate with chicken Madeira and steak Diane, which was very good. The steak and chicken were both moist and well flavored. My husband had the Louisiana chicken which was a large portion and he said was a very good dish, we also had two of the Mac and cheese burgers which were huge and got great reviews from others in our party, we got the four cheese pasta which was also very good and the fish tacos which I was told were pretty bland. I ordered a strawberry martini which I must say tasted like I was biting into a fresh strawberry!! Yum! Overall, the wait was long, but the food was amazing.. The decor very nice, though a little dark... We will be back!"
Pam S.,"Chesterbrook, PA",10,55,5,3.0,7/17/2013,Good food but as usual the extremely long wait and slow service will make it a long long time before I go to this place again. So frustrating :(
