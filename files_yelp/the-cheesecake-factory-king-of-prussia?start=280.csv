Cammy K.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,6,,5.0,2/8/2015,"I live about an hour away from Cheesecake Factory and the drive is always worth it. It's located in the King of Prussia mall, so of course it's going to be busy. I love how they text you when your table is ready. It gives you a chance to walk around the mall while waiting. Food is always perfect! I've become a fan of the (huge) factory burrito! Portion sizes are awesome. Our server, Brian, was so professional, quick, and kind. From now on I will request to sit in his section. The red velvet cheesecake is to die for!"
T M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",22,147,,1.0,8/7/2011,"When in Dallas I used to order the buffalo wings because of their peculiar flavor and aroma.  I had ordered another spaghetti type meal, but stopped venturing out when the spaghetti came back cold and molded onto the plate for the $25 I paid, disappointed.  So I finally came across another CCF here in PA and couldn't wait to try my wings again.   I was very disappointed when I got them.  They were cold, dry and flavorless.  I think I stopped after then 3rd piece and threw the rest of the meal out."
Phillip Y.,"Saint Paul, MN",257,1313,554,1.0,2/28/2011,"I had the fish taco and it was drowned in cheese, guacamole, etc.  I couldn't even see where my fish.  Finally, it was just a small piece for a heafty price.  The only highlight was the lettuce chicken wrap which was fun since you got to make it yourself.  Still, the bill shocked me in the end so bailed out on the cheesecake.  Don't get me wrong, they make the best cheesecake.   But, the price for their dishes are ridulous and huge.  Also, the waiting time for a seat can take anywhere from 1 hour to 3 hours which in my opinion is also ridiculous for the quality of food alone.  Just get the cheesecake to go and avoid the wait."
Dana B.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,10,,2.0,1/4/2015,"The food was great, it always is, and the service was friendly, but THE WAIT is always ridiculous!!  And for the second time in our last three visits, they, ahem, 'lost' our reservation, so instead of the promised ""1 hour or less"" wait, we were finally seated after 85 MINUTES!!!  And I'm pretty sure they bumped some other poor family after we complained about another lengthy mixup, but it's the hostess/concierge staff that makes going to The Cheesecake Factory such a bother, and the food really isn't so wonderful that we're willing to tolerated the poor service that often."
Becky L.,"Staten Island, NY",343,38,14,4.0,7/10/2013,"There was a huge waiting line and I was told we'd have to wait 50 minutes. So we took our beeper and walked around the mall. Only about 30 minutes had passed and my beeper rang! This is because we were willing to sit wherever seating was first available. Our table was outside but we did not mind because it was such a beautiful night.  The waiter was friendly and professional. She served us our drinks, gave us bread and took our order. The brown bread is delicious with butter. I even asked for seconds.    The portions were huge! I ordered the Thai lettuce wrap and buffalo wings for appetizer. For our entree, we ordered the crusted chicken romaine and cajun jambalaya pasta. It was so much food for 4 people. So we packed our leftovers to go.  I would definitely try it again and save room for dessert."
Anthony W.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,273,18,4.0,12/20/2010,"I've only been here once, but it was a stellar experience. I didn't like the wait, but I suppose it's the cost of doing business. I had meatloaf and mashed potatoes. They were fockin rockin! The meatloaf was surprisingly spicy. I really wanted something I had many years ago (in another state), but it was no longer on the menu... teriyaki steak with riceballs. I tried the fried macaroni balls too, but didn't care much for them. It's funny though that I made a joke with the waiter and he didn't get it so he went in the back to ask a co-worker what I meant and then he came back out and laughed at it. Now that's dedication. I'll be back someday. I might even try cheesecake... gasp."
Monica S.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",4221,1279,1348,3.0,2/19/2010,"Summer is here (not technically) and I'm really trying to watch my figure. Thanks to The Cheesecase Factory, there are meals like the Weight Management Asian Chicken Salad (which I ordered). Thanks to food that tastes like nothing, I was still hungry after the fact. Note to self and others, weight management is for suckers."
Andrew M.,"Kennett Square, PA",23,53,44,4.0,3/24/2013,Good food just huge portions
Chris S.,"King of Prussia, PA",100,37,,3.0,4/14/2013,"I like the food at cheesecake, but the ambience is really crazy. It is dark and loud, which is two opposites of what a person should expect. I gave it a star less because of it, but they have an extensive menu that everything I have had on it was good."
Michael K.,"West Chester, PA",8,412,134,4.0,8/27/2012,"Are you kidding me?  50 minute wait until getting seated?  Maybe I am impatient, but my daughter wanted to go here for dinner.  I would have given this place another star, but I hate having to wait so long to get seated.  They should also put additional seats in the mall area for all the waiting customers.  the avocado egg rolls are very good and the chicken madeira was spectacular.  Our waitress, Sarah P.,  did a great job explaning the menu, making dinner suggestions, and professionalism second to none."
Keo N.,"Lansdowne, PA",0,16,10,5.0,6/28/2013,Great Food! Good price just a little too busy during normal lunch and dinner hours. Best time to go is around 2-4PM (right before dinner) and after 8:30PM (after normal dinner time) not sure why its slow during these hours but from my experience these are the times with less time wait (20 min max)
J L.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,35,2,4.0,10/13/2012,"Tapas, tapas and more tapas. Just be warned that too many choices will lead to a pricey bill. The food is good as well as the cheesecake. It is a bit too far from my neighborhood, but when you come across one check it out."
C K.,"Hummelstown, PA",403,528,116,4.0,12/22/2012,Always good for a good meal. Their portion sizes are huge and can easily be split between two people so you can save a bit of room for dessert. Their Ghiradelli chocolate cheesecake and pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal) are my favorite.
Jess F.,"Phoenixville, PA",38,15,,4.0,9/30/2012,"I work at the mall right around the corner from the King of Prussia location so this is a favorite lunch and dinner spot for me. I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered. The small plates and snacks are a great value if you can't decide on  one thing. Also, the cheesecake is excellent. For health conscious people the new Skinnylicious menu has some great options all under 600 calories; my favorite being the pear and endive salad.  The only downside is the wait for a table but if you go for an early dinner you can easily avoid that. A word of advice, get the cheesecake to go from your waiter and avoid having to wait at the bakery for it."
Rick F.,"Blue Bell, PA",14,5,1,3.0,5/27/2013,"I think that it is hit and miss.  I have had good meals here, and bad meals.  The wait times are crazy though."
Colleen M.,"Philadelphia, PA",41,266,37,2.0,5/31/2010,"The cheesecake is good, but that's where it ends.  Honestly, you are much better off getting a slice of cheesecake to go.  I highly recommend the red velvet cake cheesecake. The menu at the Cheesecake Factory is extensive, however most of the food is pretty mediocre.  I somehow always leave this place with a stomach ache, no matter what I order.  I think it's because the food is on the greasy side.  The service is iffy.  There is always a wait for a table and the wait staff often seem to be waiting on too many tables at once.   Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of decent food choices at the King of Prussia Mall."
Amanda ..,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,,1.0,11/2/2014,"I've been to this cheesecake factory a couple times before and it was always fine. My family came from out of town to visit so I thought I'd take them there for dinner before their drive home. We got there at 4:30 and were told an hour and a half wait. Fine. An hour and forty five minutes later, still nothing. We talked to the hostess who told us there were still tables ahead of us and she had no idea how long the wait would be. Ummm what??? Isn't that your job? Close to an hour later (thats a two and a half hour wait) the manager got us a table but the whole thing was completely unprofessional. Don't tell me we'll be waiting 75-90 minutes when it's actually 2.5 hours. Then you can't even comp an app or two when you see how unhappy we are? I won't be back."
Jason M.,"West Chester, PA",12,39,41,4.0,2/1/2010,"I have tried a good amount of there menu and I've never been dissatisfied with anything I've ordered. I dunno how people can rate this place poorly based on the wait. I'm pretty sure that if the food wasn't good people wouldn't be waiting an hour or more to get a seat. No matter what location you go to your gonna have a wait especially in the KOP mall because of its popularity.  Personal favorites would be the Shepard's pie, chicken and biscuits, factory nachos with spicy chicken and the pork tenderloin! Desert favorites are the Original cheese cake with strawberry's and the Chocolate Truffle cake. Both are to die for. The Cheesecake Factory is good for any occasions especially after walking abound the KOP mall all day."
ben c.,"Newtown Square, PA",136,356,359,4.0,4/10/2012,"I have been here many times and love the food portions here!  My only problem coming here every time is deciding what to get.  They have so many selections from the menu it can be a bit overwhelming sometimes.  I came here with a friend and Rich was our waiter.  He was fantastic and was very professional.  He was very detailed even when pouring my drink and placing it back on the coaster and not on the table like most wait staff i've experienced.  He recommended buffalo blast as an appetizer which was delicious and a very popular item.  The shrimp taco from skinnylicious menu was also very yummy (my friend ordered this...FYI).  Regardless of what you order, there is a high chance that you won't be able to finish everything.  That's good cause don't.  Save room for the cheesecakes and desserts.  Again, the selections will make you wanting all of them.  Try to go with a few friends and share different cheesecakes so you can try more flavors!   If only the waiting time to get seated wasn't so long.  Go early, put your name down and shop some...it'll make the time go faster..."
Will D.,"King of Prussia, PA",7,266,45,3.0,10/22/2010,"The short story: Food: above average (4 to 4.5 stars) Service: above average, but not for this price point: (3 stars) Dining room: Nice, if you sit in the half of the restaurant along the exterior wall (facing the windows), but less nice if you sit in the interior dining room, in which the tables are packed way too close together. (2.5 to 3 stars) Note that this location is often quite crowded, with significant wait times for a table in the evening. Note also that there is ""outdoor"" seating, but it is on the sidewalk of a fairly busy parking lot."
