Mountain Chick T.,"Lackawaxen, PA",5,176,138,2.0,9/21/2012,"Waitress was excellent. Restaurant is very dark.  Nachos for the table were good, not great.  Chicken lettuce wrap tacos were pretty good.  Cheesecake is good, but dare I say not great!  Left at 9:30 p.m. and there was still a line of people waiting.  I don't get it."
sherri s.,"Newtown, PA",29,261,24,5.0,7/13/2012,"Pretty much the same in every city...delicious, great service, high energy, reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere, large portions and lots of choices.  I am really enjoying the choices on their new skinny menu.  Had the skinny Asian chicken salad which said less than 590 calories and if that is really, really true...it was delish and satisfying!  It was huge and filling too.  My hubby ordered the club sandwich and it was fresh, huge and also delish!  Really...what is not to love about the Cheesecake factory?  They have something for everyone & prices for every budget."
Ken K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",9,56,,2.0,12/15/2009,"This is not my normal review - typically, I only submit a review for places where ""sushi"" and/or ""sashimi"" is served. However, I visited here with friends and found ""Tuna Tartar"" and ""Seared Tuna loin salad"" on the menu...then, decided to try. Well, my tongue was just not ""easy"" for these types of menu. Tuna tartar was really below average - no flavor of tuna and very very small portion. The source over tuna/avocado was not giving out any taste at all...besides, grade of tuna was not good to begin with. Well, I give a credit to this place for putting this on the menu; but they should refine more for sure.  Then, seared tuna loin salad...again, quality of tuna was not so good either...portion was OK, I thought...source - a little questionable to other veggies. Spices on Tuna, at least, were agreeable taste.  Am I too picky?...hmmm, hard to tell!"
Jeremy T.,"Lancaster, PA",15,48,1,2.0,8/4/2010,"Let me start with: I love their Cheesecake.  But I didn't actually get to have any. On our recent trip to KOP, we planned to do Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  Since we'd been to Shady Maple the night before (AYCE heaven), we decided to go later in the day and avoid the crowds.  Yeah, that didn't matter.   We got there at 3:30 and were told (rather rudely) that it was going to be more than a 30 minute wait.  Not happening.  Bye."
Richard G.,"Wayne, PA",0,6,,1.0,1/29/2014,"Again tried to eat a later lunch at restaurant on 1/27/14. Still batting 0 for 2!  Sat in bar area, instead of dining room like last time, in the hopes of it being somewhat less noisy. Bar area table seating also plagued with flying bugs around our water glasses and food.  When I got up to speak with the manager, he acknowledged that they had an ""insect problem"" immediately.  Unbelievable!!!!  Last time we ate there, they also had a flying insect problem.  Have called the Montco Health Dept. with another complaint about sanitation at this restaurant and forced another inspection.  Wish this place would just close and not reopen until they can provide a clean and sanitary environment for guests.  Hate to think what the food is exposed to in the kitchen before we see it."
Gerard M.,"Philadelphia, PA",40,20,1,4.0,10/2/2012,Love the Cheesecake factory. Its the only thing that is semi appetizing in the King of Prussia Mall that can cater to all tastes. The wait is always standard and the crappy seating is always understood. I keep going back because I have never had a bad experience.
J G.,"Burnaby, Canada",1,38,3,2.0,11/30/2012,"Was here while traveling for business and after all the hype, I was pretty disappointed.   The lights were dim (nice) and the volume of the restaurant was overpowering.  I couldn't see myself enjoying a dinner in there at all, so I opted for takeout. The cheesecake was meh, the spin and artichoke dip was sub par but the potstickers were good.  The portions were GIGANTIC.  Wow. If you're looking for a lot of food and a long wait in line (35 mins for takeout? yeowza) then this might be your place. For me?  I won't be back."
Greg E.,"Fayetteville, GA",81,88,3,4.0,12/7/2011,"Pretty typical as far as Cheesecake Factories go which means vast menu, good food, and good atmosphere. This one was very crowded but they were still very busy. Of course, any place with Yuengling on tap is good. My food portion was waaaaay to big but that usually means leftovers. However, since I was traveling and wouldnt be taking leftovers, it was a bit of a waste. All in all, good place to eat."
Kevin D.,"Phoenixville, PA",25,81,30,5.0,7/26/2012,"5 Stars and well deserved. Not because of the service. Not because I sat there and ate a few times. Not even complained because yes, the wait time is insane. But their cakes are unreal and out of this world. Seriously, phenomenal. You just don't get that anywhere. Just get it to go!"
Leon B.,"Wayne, PA",28,54,2,4.0,5/6/2014,"Very good place to go for dinner, love their buffalo blasters. Always crowded, of course amazing cheesecake."
Mari H.,"New York, NY",102,235,229,1.0,5/4/2009,"For the overall Cheesecake Factory experience across the country I'd give it around 4 stars. But for this specific branch I think 2 stars is too much. Just for the most pathetic service and average food. It begins with trying to put your name in (don't even think about getting a table without a wait, it doesn't happen here). Not even putting your name in, but trying to find the hostess counter behind the mad chaos of customers crowding the waiting area. It's a complete circus. Two nights ago, we decided we didn't have the patience to wait for a table and got takeout instead. What a huge annoyance. Where do you place your order?! Welcome to the Cheesecake Factory detour, 'Go that way', 'No, behind that plant', 'See that man there? Place your order with him'. It's more frustrating than trying to call up your credit card and having to speak your options to an automated service. The seventh level of hell. For my first experience with take-out from this branch, I have to say it was total crap. I got Renee's Special - half a sandwich (chicken or turkey), salad and soup for $10, and has been solid every time I've ordered it while dining in. Not only did they give me turkey when I asked for chicken, but the sandwich was disgusting. I wanted to throw it against the wall. The sandwiches I've had before looked nothing like this. I think they took some leftover bread from someone's bread basket, threw in turkey cold cuts, added a tomato, and called it a sandwich. No dressing, no mayo, no nothing. Please, I could have made this myself and it would've tasted better! And no bread with the meal. Isn't bread complimentary with take-out? All the other branches I've gotten take-out from provide bread without hesitation.  There are tons of people waiting outside, sitting on the floor. I don't blame the people, I blame Cheesecake Facotry. Either you need to provide more seating for people waiting, or speed up your painful service. The food at this branch isn't that good either. Very inconsistent, versus the one in my hometown back in Cali where you can order something again and again and it'll always taste great. I want to go in there and shake the manager. The one redeeming factor is the cheesecake."
Maddie S.,"Malvern, PA",226,7,4,3.0,7/23/2014,"If it wasn't for their bangin fried mac and cheese and cheesecake, I would rate this a 1-star restaurant, strictly because the staff are complete assholes. I went on my birthday and the power had been shut off due to a storm, so I kindly asked if it was expected to come back on, but was cut off mid-sentence by a rude hostess who very rudely said ""we're done"" and waved her hands in front of me in a ""finished"" movement. Maybe she was frustrated that they were shutting down early?"
Rissa H.,"Norristown, PA",107,80,21,3.0,3/20/2014,"I was recently here with my mother on a weekday.... I chose a weekday because this place gets crazy insane on the weekends and it was my first time going so I wanted to be able to enjoy the experience and not feel rushed. Let me just start by saying, I waitressed for over 2 years. The waitress we had was nice but did some things that bothered me a lot! While taking our orders she was leaning on the table, (assuming she was tired from her shift) but it's completely inappropriate to be hanging over the table in front of your guests. The food came out very fast and was actually very good, pricy but delicious so I have no complaints In that area. However when the waitress brought our food out, her hands were disgustingly dirty from some sort of food in the kitchen. The only reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 is because our waitress was unsanitary and was not professional. In a place where two people go out for lunch and pay around $80 for a meal. Professionalism and basic waitressing etiquette among staff should not be an issue..."
Thomas I.,"Henderson, NV",46,205,6,4.0,6/27/2012,People love to give chain restaurants bad reviews just because its not cool local and hippy. I like to judge based on if it taste good when it touches my toungue. Got a burger here and a cheesecake and everything just tasted delicious. Service was stellar 2. What I got to say for cheesecake factory is let the haters hate
Domenic F.,"King of Prussia, PA",134,399,12,5.0,5/26/2009,"I have been here MANY times over the years and am quite surprised that this place is receiving negative reviews.   Every time i go here there is a MASSIVE line of people waiting to eat here, so if its that crowded how can it be bad?   Again with that being said I love it here.   Every single meal I've ever eaten here, has been great.   Every single appetizer and dessert I've eaten here has been way above average and the prices are right on.   I think this place is an excellent place for a variety of things in life.   This could serve dating couples, this could serve the group of guys going out one night it could also serve the ladies going out for martini night but this place is downright good.   Take a moment and look at all the reviews many people are pissed because of the wait time, and the mediocre service.   This site is all about FOOD and this place has awesome stuff."
Lindsay S.,"West Chester, PA",1,5,,5.0,6/18/2014,"Best food, drinks, and cheesecake!  I go for brunch or happy hour about 1x/month and my table is always happy with their order.  Service is always friendly as well, and they offer great suggestions from the menu.  I don't believe they take reservations, so get there when they open (11am brunch) or try and snag a spot by the bar."
Helen W.,"Jersey City, NJ",46,277,2,3.0,2/24/2012,They were really nice. We asked for MSG channel and the waiter went to ask his boss.  They tried to be accommodating even though they didn't have the channel.  Service was good but the food is just usual like the other cheesecake factories.
Dave L.,"Austin, TX",3263,2340,17973,3.0,4/10/2007,"Tasty food, nice variety of dishes on the menu, and HUGE portions - service is hit-or-miss at this Cheesecake Factory location but has been getting better (Anne Marie was the most recent server who helped me out). Great desserts, cheesecake is definitely their hallmark. Recommended for any get together. One negative is that they don't take reservations (in fact, no Cheesecake Factory does that I'm aware of) and that their prices aren't the most wallet-friendly. I've had many dishes here, including the: - Tex Mex rolls - they're huge for an appetizer, needed to share that - macaroni balls - not a bad app, just balls of macaroni and cheese deep-fried... if that's your bag, go for it - Firecracker Salmon Rolls ($9) - spiced fresh salmon rolled in spinach and fried in a crisp wrapper. Served with a sweet hot (haha riiiiight!) chili sauce - Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - had this in Baltimore and loved it, but then again here. Wasn't as good as I remembered - Sheila's New Orleans Pasta - not bad - cajun jambalaya - good, surprisingly tangy, would get it again - Thai chicken pasta - never mix ""Thai"" and ""pasta"" in the name of a dish - not really good - crispy spicy beef ($15) - crispy fried slices of steak sauteed with green beans, shiitake mushrooms, onions, carrots and sesame seeds in a sweet-spicy sauce with white rice - not spicy, VERY sweet, with crispy (who would have thunk it) pieces of meat I've had a few desserts here but I only remember their carrot cake cheesecake because it's my favorite there - delicious! Definitely come here for their cheesecake. Their food you can live without."
GoBlue G.,"Wilmington, DE",7,118,223,3.0,3/8/2012,"Sunday brunch is the only time we've been, never have to wait for a table at 10:45. Food has always been delivered hot and flavorful. Service can be laid back at times, I hate the standard "" how are you guys, can I start you off with some drinks"". Last time I checked my wife and mother aren't  guys!!! Picky I guess. Menu will satisfy anyone, I am a fan of the egg white omelette and the tamale cakes. Cheese cake not bad either. Coffee is very good. Hostess very pleasant. Hate the faded white work uniforms, oxyclean =ever heard of it ... Use it. We'll be back of course!"
Jessica M.,"Malvern, PA",0,6,,5.0,11/20/2013,"The cheesecake factory has been and will always be the best restaurant in town! It's waits are very long, but it is definitely worth it! Also, the service is always amazing! When every I have guests from out of town, I always take them here and they always insist on returning! I have never had a bad experience!"
