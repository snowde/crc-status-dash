Anthony D.,"Lansdale, PA",1,44,,5.0,6/16/2013,"OH MY GOD!!! I love this place. The bread comes out fresh and warm. The Thai Lettuce Wraps are a great way to start. Messy, but delicious. My favorite meal is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It is one of their most popular dishes and with good reason. Dive in! My wife loves the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic. As for dessert, there are only a few options...... NOT! There are around 38 different types of cheesecake and I love them all. That doesn't even count all the other desserts. My favorite is the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake. It is banana cream cheesecake topped with Bavarian cream and fresh sliced bananas. It is pure heaven on a plate. I have never had a bad meal there and I have eaten there numerous times. The wait can be long at peak times (45 -90 minutes), but that is because they are so good! Go at an off time and you will get right in. Enjoy!"
Samantha M.,"Pennington, NJ",5,312,10,3.0,1/1/2012,"First of all this place should be  a destination for cheesecake - as the name says, not really the food.  The food portions are huge (as are the cheesecake slices) and arent that amaing.  although they do have a new ""skinny"" menu, which seems OK.  Last timeI got an omelet, that was in my opinion over priced, and I could have made a better one.  The coffee was surprisingly good though.  the service was good overall too.  it's a really big place and we were told we would have a 30 min wait at lunch around 1215ish, and it ended up being only about 10-15, which was really nice, they do not take reservatoins.  But really, the cheesecakes are out of this world! so many to choose from it's crazy. I have never had a bad one."
J H.,"Borough of Princeton, NJ",0,97,,4.0,7/3/2012,"After a ridiculously overpriced group lunch at nearby joes crab shack, I bounced right back with lunch today at cheesecake factory. Less per person that the other place but infinitely better meal. Excellent service. Our waitress responded well to the fact that we were in a hurry. But did not scold me when I spilled my water all over the floor. Mushroom soup, tacos, turkey burger, pasta with chicken, and of ample amounts of really good bread for our table.   Portions plenty large enough even ordering from amongst the smaller sizes of the skinnylicious menu. Cheesecake Factory is a great concept that is still not past it's prime."
Danii S.,"Norristown, PA",0,23,,4.0,3/29/2014,"Don't get the pretzel crusted chicken, it's horrible. The mini corn dogs are good."
Chris V.,"Limerick, PA",108,137,35,3.0,11/20/2008,"You know. I just don't get it. I mean really, I just don't get it. This is a chain restaurant and people will wait HOURS....yes HOURS to get a table there. What is wrong with these people? Here's a little tip, the food really isn't THAT good. It's not terrible and I can't say that I've had a bad meal there, but it's just not worth the enormous wait that people endure for it. I would suggest that you go either early in the afternoon (2-5pm) if you absolutely have to go. Otherwise you're just setting yourself up for a disappointment.  I will say however, that I love the cheesecake. Is it the best I've ever had? Nah, can't say that it is. However, they have such a great variety that almost anyone who isn't lactose intolerant can find something they'll love. My personal favs are the Snickers bar and the vanilla bean varieties. I'll call ahead, pick it up, and take it back to work so I can be in cheesecake heaven while my co-workers look at me with puppy dog eyes because I have a treat and they don't.  All in all, not a great place but not a bad place. I would not recommend going there anytime soon since with the upcoming holiday season it's gonna be crazy over there for the next month."
Sidney B.,"King of Prussia, PA",42,43,1,3.0,8/30/2008,"The good - The menu has about a brazillian different options, so you'll be able to find SOMETHING you like I am sure.  The portion sizes are HUGE, which may not be a good thing, but you get your money's worth at least.  They have a dessert called ""Goblet of Strawberries"" that comes with homemade whipped cream that is perfect if you aren't in a cheesecake mood (or just don't like it).  The wait staff is very friendly, and never forgets about you like some restaurants in the area. The bad - The food just isn't that good.  It's not bad by any means, but not top notch either.  Considering the prices are higher than most restaurants in the area, I expect better. The ugly - I've had to wait 2+ hours on multiple occasions to get in here.  Believe me, it wasn't my choice.  The worst part for me is, about half the time I go there, they sit us at tables that have long benches on one side, and chairs on the other.  I've had dinner with people I don't know inches away from me many times, and it's just uncomfortable.  I feel like I have to whisper to remain private, and not bother the other diners around me. In conclusion, if you really want to try the Cheesecake Factory, go during lunch when it's not crowded, ask for a booth, and don't get too optimistic about the food quality and you won't be disappointed."
Brasewel N.,"Nottingham, MD",5,23,,3.0,12/29/2011,Went to try out their hyped Kobe beef burger and was sorely disappointed. I asked for medium rare and was given a well done burger that was dry. Definitely the last time I'm visiting this chain.
Andrea T.,"Philadelphia, PA",281,573,63,3.0,3/18/2009,"The food is pretty standard from state to state.  However, what sets KOP apart is the crappy service. I work out this way and every now and again I eat here out of sheer convenience. I always forget about the brew pub.  They find the most miserable people and decide to give them jobs."
Jen R.,"Philadelphia, PA",82,235,4,3.0,11/14/2008,"The food here isn't the best. People go for the cheesecakes so make sure to leave room in your belly (you'll be able to take enough home for lunch and dinner the next day). There are many variety of meals and cheesecakes to choose from. The menu is quite a couple of pages long which makes it difficult to choose what you want but there has to be something in there that you like even if you don't eat cheesecake. This place is pretty pricey. I think too pricey. They don't take reservations either so it is always packed. I managed to get in on a weekday at about 9 p.m with no wait at all. Another time I waited almost an hour for a group of 5 or so around 6:00. I guess I was lucky, I hear the wait is normally about 2 hours. I have never even bothered to try getting in during the weekend. I hear it gets pretty packed for lunch too."
Bruce S.,"Bally, PA",62,129,23,2.0,6/23/2009,"Yea.. see I never got this place.  I like cheesecake as much as the next foodie but it's dessert for goodness sake... and really, it's not any better than anywhere else.  It's cheesecake!  Have you ever had really BAD cheesecake??  Yea, me neither!  They DO have a good selection of varieties of cheesecake, though. The ONLY reason I go here anymore is when I'm with someone in KoP who hasn't been there before and they wet themselves with excitement because they HAVE to go to the Cheesecake Factory... so we go. The wait is absolutely ridiculous... it's like going to the Hard Rock Cafe... except.. it's not the Hard Rock Cafe except regarding price... You stand at the center ""island"" and wait for someone to dane to allow you to put your name on the list and give you a buzzer thingie -- that can take 15 minutes.  Once you do get in the service is average at best, slow is more common.   The big problem I have with the place is the food is simply not very good.  I would rather go to Applebees.  The food at my local diner (Pied Piper -- see my review) is head and shoulders better and they have cheesecake, too.  And, the price of the food is outrageous.  Not like ""Wow, I didn't realize the pasta was $15"" expensive, more like ""Dear Lord who ordered the lobster?  Oh, wait.  No one, we all got burgers."" I've read other CF reviews and perhaps the chain itself is good, but this restaurant is NOT.  If you are in KoP and you want to go to the Cheesecake Factory, I'd like to recommend you go to Morton's then head over for a slice of cheesecake afterward.  You'll probably spend less and have a way-better experience."
Terrence J.,"Willow Grove, PA",9,89,8,2.0,12/2/2012,"I ate there a few mins ago the food was good but the service was disgusting slow our server she had only 4 tables but slow as hell just to refill our water and I had to ask twice for parmesan on my dish beware of waitress chrissy another thing manager tall white man look 50 ish didn't care and say he heard complaints about her this happen at 6pm,"
Thayvie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,25,,4.0,5/31/2008,"Good Food Prepared In Their Own Way, Long Waits, Still Worth It, and Service Gets 5 *. NOTE: Cheesecake Factory does serve a lots of different cheesecakes, but it also have meals services. I didn't know that at first. I really thought it was a Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory has many different varieties of food. Different types of food. From Italian, Asian, Spanish, a few others. However, it doesn't quite taste like ... cultural food. The meals there are not bad at all, no, they just have their own way of cooking it. A bit of a Cheesecake Factory signature. Its very good in its own way. Still very filling and tasty. If you are a person who loves to eat and try different things, I would recommend getting the appetize sampler to share with a friend. There are Vietnamese Spring rolls, avocado rolls, calamari, etc. iThere is a lot of food within the sampler, and you might want to watch how much your eating at first because you might not be able to get your salad to dinner. (Due to be too full.) There are many different salads there, and most of the ones I have tried, are all great! Pasta and fish there are also great there as well.  There are way too many desserts, from at least 25 different types of cheesecakes to strawberries and whip cream. Its a great place to bring a big and small groups of people. The wait is definitely long, but no disappoint. The servers are really nice and friendly as well, and are able to help you through whatever assistance needed."
Jay L.,"Allentown, PA",0,44,,4.0,10/7/2013,"went here for my first time right after bahama breeze restaurant for my birthday because me and my friends wanted dessert here on Sept 25th i tried the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake , they brought it out with a candle and sung happy birthday to me, that was very nice, i usually dance to the restaurant's customized happy birthday songs but they sung the traditional song and you cant really dance to that lol my cheesecake was good not great but my friends shared a Chocolate Chip Cookie - Dough Cheesecake i think and they loved it it's a little dark in the restaurant but has a relaxing environment havent tried the actual food so cant judge it on that part but for the dessert that i had, it was okay i guess, just don't know if i would want to pay almost $10 for a slice of cheesecake"
Brian E.,"Avon, CT",186,323,729,4.0,8/8/2008,"What is there to say about the Cheesecake Factory that hasn't already been said. You know, the stuff like,""The wait is about an hour and a half,""or, ""The wait is about two hours."" You get the point, if you are willing to wait, you will be delivered good food and fairly good service at this king of prussia location. The plus factor about waiting at this location is the added bonus of having an Urban Outfitters right next door where you can shop until you are buzzed. And don't listen to them when they tell you that little device won't work outside the restaurant, they are BS. Feel free to go in Urban Outfitters, or feel free to take a rest on the leather massage chairs just around the bend in front of Mortons."
Statia M.,"Royersford, PA",22,89,2,2.0,8/18/2008,"Every single Cheesecake factory I've ever been to has had waits so damn long that you had to camp out the night before.  Like you're lining up for tickets to your favorite rock concert.  The food is average at best.   The cheesecake isn't to die for.  Hell, I make a much better cheesecake than they do.   The upside is that you can probably live on one of their portions for a week if you take it home.  The downside is that you'd probably die of a heart attack.  I'd make another recommendation, but there's really not much around the mall except for chain food."
Nicholas F.,"Norwich, CT",29,2,,4.0,12/23/2009,"The Caramel Chicken was one of the specials today.  It was delicious, perfect over white rice which balanced out the sweetness of the caramel sauce. My wife had the barbecue ranch chicken salad which she was not impressed with especially after having a bite of my meal"
Carl C.,"Philadelphia, PA",18,69,,4.0,5/18/2010,"I am not a chain restaraunt fan and could never see myself going to the Mall for dinner on Saturday night but...... if I am at the Mall and it is midday this place sure as hell beats the food court.  Also that little buzzer they give you around dinner time and tell you it will be 3 hours...This place isnt worth that wait. Great lunch spot though and good spot if you have kids.  It is not fine dining by any means but the menu is large, the portions are big, the service is always decent and they have a bar off to the side in case you want to catch a buzz on lazy Tuesday afternoon with the day off....today And the cheesecake is always a hit.  I personally get it go....something about eating a bacon cheese burger for lunch  w/ fries and a bloody mary and then peanut butter cheesecake at 1pm feels wrong...almost like I should just wear tapered sweat pants w/ a wife beater and  give up."
Robyn H.,"Philadelphia, PA",449,463,54,5.0,11/4/2010,BANG-BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP!!!!! Just one more thing to love at this place!!  YUM!!!!  (Just left here!!) lol
Annie L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,4,,4.0,7/19/2011,"This resturant is the only reason I go to the Court side of the KOP mall. The food there is pretty good, the food is a bit greasy for my taste. I ordered a burger and the fried mac and cheese here, both were pretty good. Everytime I go and have a meal I always too full to eat the cheesecake. But, at the cheesecake factory you just have to, even if its just for one bite. The servers there are pretty nice to you, but sometimes you get left at your table for a bit, they hardly check on you; which maybe a good and a bad thing. But overall the food there is good and the people are nice, that is why its always so packed. I would recommend people to come out and try it."
Heather G.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,48,2,5.0,2/25/2013,"This place, I don't even know where to start. The best food I've had in a very very long time. The wait sucked seeing as most of the stores closed by the time we put in for a table but every second I waited was a second earned because there is nothing bad about this restaurant. First of all, the menu is wild. I literally had no idea where to begin and even though that made me a little nervous, I couldn't help but to want to order eveythinggggggggg. My boyfriend ordered the chicken buffalo blasters and I got a crab appetizer, don't really remember the name but they were both delicious. Then the real fun came, my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese burger and I got the chicken alfredo. Both were so amazing and the portions were gigantic! My boyfriend who is definitely a solid finisher of every meal couldn't even attempt the second half of his burger and my pasta looked like I didn't even put a dent in it. We actually had to order our cheesecake to go because there was no possible way of putting one more piece of food in my mouth. For how crowded it was we definitely had amazing service and our waiter was such a nice guy. All around I would have no second thoughts about going back, it was delicious."
