Katie F.,"Philadelphia, PA",31,17,,5.0,3/26/2012,"I have never ever ever ever had a bad meal here EVER. This is easily my favorite restaurant, partially because Im such a huge cheesecake fan. But it's not just the cheesecakes that are fabulous- it's EVERYTHING. They have such a wide range of entrees- Asian cuisine, Burgers, Italian, Mexican, you name it. Its all fabulous. Even the Tropical Tea is to die for. I can't think of anything negative about any of my experiences here, besides maybe the wait for a table. It's annoying that they don't take reservations. But my solution to that issue is to just come at the off hours. You'll be busy shopping at the mall anyway, so come at your leisure. Like or between lunch and dinner (3 or 4:00). Just forget Friday/Saturday nights unless you're doing takeout or are willing to wait around 1.5 hours. Also, the meals are very high in caloric content so be prepared to workout for a couple days afterwards if you want your pants to fit haha. But to me, thats just a sign of amazing food- 5 STARS!!"
Timothy F.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,18,,5.0,9/10/2011,"Great food and good service.  You usually have to wait, but if you get there at 11:15am and beat the crowd, it's not bad.  The portions are huge, definitely don't go here before you head to Weight Watchers to weigh in for the week. If you leave room after the huge portions, the cheesecake is to die for!"
Lauren H.,"Houston, TX",43,128,,3.0,4/28/2007,"The KOP Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations. Inconvenient, yes, because the food is average, but, let's be honest -- you're here for the cheesecake. You almost forget the two-hour wait once you dig into the vanilla bean cheesecake - almost.  Urban Outfitters is right across the way, so my friends and I usually amuse ourselves with the irreverent humor books while we wait."
TL M.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,3,5.0,7/23/2012,"Restaurant was very elegant. Food was delicious and delivered to my table in record time. My primary comment is pertaining to the excellent service by my server. This was my first time dining at The Cheesecake Factory so I did have some questions. My server, Ellen, was so kind and knowledgeable about every dish to which I enquired. She was so attentive and delivered every comment with a smile that made me feel like the most important customer she had all night. She recommend dessert and helped me decide which one I would like best. Her service was so refreshing and rare. Since I travel a lot, I have great experience with dining out. Ellen must truly be an asset to the Cheesecake Factory organization. The only way she could have made my experience better would be if she had sat down and had dinner with me. (Dining alone really gets old.) I shared my compliments with Ellen and with her manager before leaving the restaurant. Should I have the opportunity to be close, I am certain to return and I must ask to be placed in Ellen's section."
Alexander W.,"Allentown, PA",0,6,,5.0,5/6/2011,This place is a nice calm place to have sunday brunch or after some good ol' shopping. It's located in just another corner of the mall but the inside decor is decently elegant. It is a little more expensive than average but the portions are huge! More for family dining than taking the girlfriend though.
Connor K.,"West Chester, PA",0,21,,5.0,7/1/2013,A nice place to go. The food is great and they have a lot of choices. The only problem is that the wait is so long!
alex h.,"Lancaster, PA",0,3,,5.0,4/17/2013,"Our service was great and our food was DELICIOUS. My cousin and I ate there for lunch and we each got a burger and shared a piece of cheesecake, our bill was only $33. Love it here!"
Dick S.,"Malvern, PA",0,40,2,5.0,12/28/2012,"We ate on a Friday evening and there was an hour waiting time projected.  We sat at the bar, however and avoided waiting.  Our bartender, Cesaer, was very attentive and made us great martini's.  I had NE clam chowder and Shepherds pie.  Really good.  My wife had a huge Cobb salad which was fresh and crisp.  All in all, it was a great meal.  Ceasar was a super bartender and host which made the dining experience all that much better."
Nicci G.,"Phoenixville, PA",0,53,,5.0,6/2/2011,I LOVE the Cheesecake factory. Yes its a chain restaurant but the cheesecake at this place is amazing. You have to get to this place early because by 5:00 there is an hour or longer wait which i find ridiculous! The food is okay but not worth the price.
Tracee S.,"Coatesville, PA",15,9,,4.0,5/4/2009,"THIS REVIEW IS OF THE LEMON RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE, NOT MY OVERALL EXPERIENCE AT THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY (that would probably not get a 4). So, I went to The Cheesecake Factory this weekend. It's not really one of my favorite restaurants food-wise, but I've always liked their cheesecake. Which, I would hope so with a name like The Cheesecake Factory. Anyway, I usually get the OREO Cheesecake because I love cookies-n-cream ice cream, and this tastes just like it to me. But, I'm counting calories now so I went down the list and choose the cheesecake that had the least amount of calories (excluding the low-carb options, because it's sweetened with Splenda and I don't like artificial sweeteners). I ended up going with the Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake. It was 734 calories of cheesecake awesomeness. I only intended to eat half of it (counting calories, remember?), but I ate the whole thing. The best part was the bottom layer of raspberry vanilla cake (yummy). But once you taste the lemon cheesecake, it gets even better. Needless to say, it is now my new favorite. Sorry OREO's :( Disclaimer: Due to my healthy eating habits, I do not know if the cheesecake was actually as good as stated, or if it's just been so long since I've eaten cheesecake that it just tasted that much better. Guess you'll just have to try it for yourself."
Mo C.,"Denver, CO",528,804,72,5.0,6/23/2009,It's the cheesecake factory. The food is always great. One fantastic discovery I made here was the Low Carb Cheesecake!!! It's got a walnut crust and only 9 carbs. Fantastic!
Isabel L.,"Lititz, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/16/2012,No place for a large group restaurant does not take reservations.  Showed up on a Monday night at 5:30 to request a table for 12 at 6:30 ( the place was almost empty ) management would not accommodate waited for an hour after being told wait was 1 hour and half then told may not have a table for another 45 minutes we left and had dinner and drinks elsewhere at another restaurant that did not take reservations guess they did not want to serve 12 people
Brian M.,"Devon, PA",69,406,63,2.0,2/19/2010,"Oy?! Food is ok, but nothing remarkable. The lines are insane. The hostesses, well perhaps its the lines or its the cause of the lines; three 20-somethings handing out pagers with little finesse. The restaurant is dark and loud, the bar is about as relaxing as a mosh pit, and the floor throughout is slick with the grease of many, many chain restaurant meals."
Kay G.,"Media, PA",0,14,,3.0,5/12/2010,"Went to KOP on a rainy Tuesday evening, and at 6:15 had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 3.  The restaurant is quite noisy, so if you can get a booth, it's worth waiting for.  Cold air turned on periodically,making it chilly for all of us. Our waitress was pleasant, but not terribly engaging.  She spoke the specials very fast  and immediately turned away, so that we practically had to grab her arm and pull her back for her to repeat them.  Took several minutes for our drinks to be delivered, and then she disappeared for another 10 minutes when we wanted to order. Food was excellent - chicken marsalla, grilled salmon, chopped salad were our 3 entrees - all delivered very quickly after ordering.  The waitress only peeked her head into our book one other time, so we had to ask another server for more butter and glasses of wine. All in all, we felt that we were not attended to well at all.  No banter, and no assistance with menu choices (of which there are hundreds!)"
Gary J.,"Morrisville, PA",0,16,,1.0,7/28/2012,"We ate at the Cheesecake factory once and only once.  Heard about it and thought we had to try it.  Food was ok, service was ok but my pet peeve is sitting at a table and being able to reach over and pick off my neighbors plate.  The seating was cramped.  My first thought was they just wanted to get as many people in as possible and the heck with comfort."
Beth M.,"King of Prussia, PA",1,18,,2.0,2/5/2014,"The food is alright for a big chain but the portions are gargantuan. One time I ordered a black bean burrito there that lasted me for an entire day. I ate it for a late breakfast, I ate leftovers for a later lunch, I had more for dinner, then I are some more for a snack that night. It was literally the only thing I ate all day long, and I still wound up throwing some of it away that night. And I can eat!! Everything is huge there. The furniture, the silverware, the plants, the plates, the drinks, even the bathrooms. I can practically rest my chin on the table when I'm in a booth. It's like you're Alice in Wonderland. It's disconcerting, like the place is trying to make you feel tiny so you think you can eat more. If they halved the size of everything on the menu and scaled down everything else as well, it'd be a much more enjoyable experience. When I go there, I honestly feel like I'm being tricked."
Michael R.,"Pottstown, PA",10,146,10,3.0,12/9/2008,"OK food and decent desserts, but all in all just average and not worth the hype or waiting in (or on) line in to obtain the cookie cutter cuisine."
Tiffany L.,"Phoenixville, PA",8,16,5,4.0,9/15/2009,"Love the food great variety and tons of menu choices, my favorite is Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp.  The portion sizes are huge a good value for the price the only real downside is the long wait.  No matter what time of day for a party of 2 expect to wait at least 30 minutes. Other than the wait I love eating here."
K M.,"Stroudsburg, PA",0,31,,4.0,9/2/2010,"Each time we visit, there is at least a 45 min-1 hour wait regardless of the day of the week. Personally, I don't really mind because the staff is so friendly when you get there. The food is great, a tad bit expensive. The downside is that on the busy nights, some of the tables are so close together that you are sitting next to strangers which makes it hard to have personal conversation."
Mary M.,"Chesterbrook, PA",0,20,,2.0,3/15/2012,"Met a friend here for lunch about a month ago....maybe it was our early arrival, but we were seated right away.   With so many empty tables, we were disappointed with the table we were given...so close to the servers' station.  Anyway, the menu here is extensive and the portions huge.  Fortunately, our server made sure we saw the ""skinny"" menu (calories under a certain number).  We ordered from there...my friend getting a salad with chicken and I had the burger with side salad.  It was delicious and satisfying without breaking the calorie bank.  The atmosphere is a bit chaotic, which keeps me from frequenting this restaurant, but I will go back at some point for another savory low-calorie burger."
