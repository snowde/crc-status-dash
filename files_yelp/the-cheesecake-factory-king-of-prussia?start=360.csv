Matt M.,"Conshohocken, PA",1,5,,4.0,2/9/2010,"Sometimes, your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness. For the Cheesecake Factory, its goodness is its downfall. The throngs of people loitering outside the doors, tightly gripping their restaurant-beepers waiting for it to begin flashing, are on to something: the Cheesecake Factory is hella good. The menu is like a book, with a ""chapter"" basically devoted to every genre of food you could imagine. And, despite the immensity of their offerings, everything I have ever tasted has been really good. (I cannot imagine what it must be like behind the scenes in that kitchen-- every chef must have to take a combination of Adderall and Prozac before going into work.) The portions of everything are huge here, so if I order an appetizer (try the deep fried macaroni & cheese balls!), I usually can't finish my entree (and trust me, this is an unusual occurrence because I can EAT.) which means that by the time dessert rolls around-- me and my party are usually too full to even think about eating a 5 pound delicious piece of cheesecake. But, since the cheesecake offerings here are too good to pass up, we just order a slice to go, and a couple of hours later (or maybe for breakfast the next day) we have a decadent treat all ready to go.  The food here is very good, the service is good, and their cheesecake selection is ridiculous. As long as you don't mind a two hour wait for dinner, THIS is the place to go at the King of Prussia mall."
David F.,"Phoenixville, PA",105,149,51,2.0,3/13/2008,"I don't get people.  The Cheesecake Factory is OK at its best.  Lets get something straight:  when you wait in long lines for food, well, remember all of the places you waited in line for food.  They were probably cafeteria's so I don't think this is much different.  Not that restaurants this large can't make good meals but ANY time your serving this many people at once your food quality will suffer.  I am not willing to pay this much money and time for average meals.  Please remember the best food comes from regional favorites eateries and small, well owned restaurants most of which will carry all kinds of testimonials from food experts and critics.  You will not ever see the CCF on this list.  So I say average (or less) for this eatery."
Jane V.,"Norristown, PA",107,172,77,3.0,5/5/2008,"I'm actually a huge fan of their fish dishes (mahi-mahi, tuna, salmon, etc.) .  And their avocado rolls are pretty darn good too.  Everything else is average.  I WOULD give them a better rating but NO THANK YOU to the 2 hour wait period on the weekends, and what the heck is with the no reservations policy?  I tried to go there last night with a group of 10.  Shouldn't they at least consider reservations for a large party?  Ridiculous.  Unless I get seated right away, I don't think it's worth the wait.  Plenty of other half-decent restaurants in the KoP area."
Lily N.,"Conshohocken, PA",0,7,,4.0,10/18/2008,"Everything I have ever ordered here was delicious.  Honestly, this is the place where go to when our plans fall through...  Usual favorites are the tamale corn cakes, avocado egg rolls and the pull pork sandwich.  They have a decent amount of vegetarian options and delicious desserts although we are usually stuffed by the end of dinner..."
Hannah M.,"Frederick, MD",0,65,,5.0,3/22/2011,1-1/2 hour wait for a table and it was so worth it!  We were visiting King of Prussia and went to the Cheesecake Factory Saturday night.  We thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Our server was Shawn who is unfortunately moving to New York. We feel very fortunate to have been there on his last weekend. He knew the entire menu and was very helpful as well as entertaining.  The food was great. A wonderful experience to top off our visit.
Shawn M.,"Detroit, MI",130,261,44,4.0,9/7/2008,"Great food and Dessert!!! As always you can never go wrong with this place. My partner and I had the Tex-Mex egg rolls for an appetizer and then I had the chicken costoletta for the main entree. The food was great as always. We both shared a piece of the Dolce de Leche cheesecake. What can I say, I think it was a taste of heaven."
Kelly S.,"FL, FL",74,303,114,4.0,8/30/2007,"I went here with my friend once.  I haven't been back b/c KOP is an hour from my house, but I did enjoy the Cheesecake Factory.  We had to wait for a table, but it wasn't that long, considering it was dinnertime on a Saturday night.  I'd estimate we only waited about 20 minutes, which we killed by checking out the Urban Outfitters next door.  The food was good, especially the avacado eggrolls.  But, I'll be honest, I didn't really care what I had for a meal because I was saving room for cheesecake anyway.  And the cheesecake did not disappoint.  First, they had so many varieties that I had a hard time choosing just one.  After an agonizing decision, I decided to have one variety for dessert (I forget what it was, but it had peanut butter and chocolate in it) and to take one home (cherries on top of regular cheesecake).  The cake was delicious - light, airy, and it melted in my mouth.  Yum.  Cheesecake perfection."
Remmie F.,"Villanova, PA",2,11,,2.0,4/17/2008,"Overall, an average dining experience with an above average wait.  Friends and I went on a saturday night not too long ago, because we heard it was decent.  I had the peanut butter pasta. The service was slow, I'm assuming because of the heavy load of business, but we eventually got our meal which was fine taste wise but the chicken in my pasta was a little on the rubbery side.   We split an oreo cheesecake dessert which was also about average.  I would give this place 3 stars if the line wasn't so long.  I don't understand how so many good restaurants are struggling when this middling enterprise seems to be thriving."
Allison E.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,92,,4.0,6/9/2011,"After dining at three other Cheesecake Factory locations, I have found this one to be my favorite.  Why?  Consistency.  This chain at King of Prussia has that down.  Their food here is always good here, portions enormous and waitstaff is great.  I'd be caution the time of day, however.  Fridays and Saturdays are the busiest so call ahead!"
Ben H.,"Dallas, TX",0,15,,1.0,10/1/2009,"I love this place as a chain in general, just not this location. Here's why: Every time I go to a Cheesecake Factory, whether it's in TX, PA, NJ, or elsewhere, I always order the same thing. Since they don't have a beef burrito on the menu, I ask them to make me a steak and put that in the burrito instead of the chicken, which I don't care for. Since the steak is the more expensive of the two, they always just charge me for the price of the steak meal and everybody is happy. Well, on my last trip to the King of Prussia location, which consequently will be my last trip ever to the King of Prussia location, the waiter informed me that they would have to charge me full price for both meals - the burrito and the steak - even though I was only substituting the steak for the chicken and keeping all else the same. I asked to speak to the manager, who came out. I explained to her that this is what I always do every time I eat at a Cheesecake Factory and have even done so at that location on more than 1 occasion. She insisted that I pay full price for both items - around $50 - just to get the steak burrito. I told her that was ridiculous and that she was about to lose a customer forever. She shrugged her shoulders as if she didn't care so I put a 5 on the table for the sodas and we went to Maggiano's. If ever a manager needed fired, it's the blond woman at the King of Prussia Cheesecake Factory. Her attitude better suits an inner city Philadelphia McDonald's or something.  I truly hope she has the opportunity to explore that career path some day."
shilpa p.,"New York, NY",37,187,,4.0,7/21/2006,"great selection of food and great cheesecake.  they have this drink called the bikini martini which i've never had but it's the name of my alter ego so i dig it.  i recommend the brownie sundae cheesecake because let's face it, brownies are the best.  as far as food, you can't go wrong with the jambalaya or the herb crusted salmon.  the one thing i can't stand about this place is there is always a wait and it usually averages around two hours."
