Kenny B.,"Lancaster, PA",74,36,,3.0,5/24/2017,"The only reason that they are getting three stars is because I just ate, and I'm not hangry anymore. The restaurant itself is nice, the food is good, however, our waiter pissed me off. I needed a drink refill, but it was coming to the end of our meal...not ONCE did he offer me a refill (and I hadn't had any refills). He came back past the table five, FIVE times...end rant. I will come back again, despite this incident. The food is yummy."
Jacqueline H.,"Schwenksville, PA",6,92,190,5.0,4/5/2017,"My coworker and I came here for dinner after work. We had two different servers during the evening due to the change in shifts. Both waiters were friendly and prompt. I had a passion fruit margarita and my companion ordered two pineapple mojitos - both were good. For entrees, we had the herb crusted filet of salmon (which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus) and the Cubano sandwich (which came with a side, my companion ordered a salad). The food came out at a good pace and the portions were generous. The food was yummy! Lucky me, my dining companion was here on a business trip and he let me take home part of his sandwich, and I'm looking forward to eating it later. We could not end our visit without ordering their famous cheesecake. We ordered the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake and the lemon meringue cheesecake. It was creamy, rich, and delicious. We purposely only ate half of our cheesecakes so we could enjoy them again later. I'm looking forward to my next visit!"
Bhumi M.,"Clifton Heights, PA",17,10,15,3.0,4/24/2017,I have been to this place more than 6 times..initially I loved the food but in last two visits my experience was not so good...this time I ordered factory nachos because I just loved it when I ordered in my prior visits..but this time the dish was just warm and also it tasted different...I don't know the reason it may be Sunday rush..but overall I just love California guacamole salad of cheesecake factory and also complimentary breads..just try to avoid weekend rush if you really care about food quality..
Mo B.,"Calgary, Canada",4,9,44,2.0,8/31/2017,"Not the best experience. We went here for a friend's birthday and they ruined the vibe completely. First of all, I called in advance to see if I could order her the celebration cheesecake in advance and put a candle one it, no one answered the phone and when they eventually did they hung up. First red flag! Now let's get to the experience of the restaurant itself. When we got there we put our name in and waited to be seated, after a while we start wondering if anyone was going to seat us because there were many empty seats yet we were still waiting out front for a long time. We finally got seated and we're greeted by the waitress( sorry I can't remember her name) we ordered drinks and they took forever with the drinks, it was only a milkshake and a mixed drink, nothing fancy. Second red flag. Then I order a kids meal for my baby girl, the only meal that was order since us adults only wanted drinks & dessert. The kids meal also took a while and when they finally brought it out the entire plate was HOT. Now this wouldn't normally be a big issue but (A) it was a plate for a baby to eat off of & (B) the temp of the plate tells me the food was ready long before it was brought out. Third red flag. The last straw was after we ordered our desserts they come back about 5-10 minute later to tell us that the celebration cake(the whole reason we went there) was too frozen to serve & that we would have to take it home. Ummm... WHAT?! This completely ruined my friend's birthday experience.  The only good thing I have to say about the experience was that the portion of the kids meal was sizable & the smores cheesecake was delicious, hence the two stars. With the bad service we most definitely won't be going back. We can get cheesecake elsewhere."
Abhilasha D.,"Malvern, PA",56,83,65,5.0,9/30/2017,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory? lol..I love this place! It can get crowded many times, but I feel the food is worth the wait!"
Christine J.,"Sparta Township, NJ",73,116,5,1.0,3/4/2017,"Worst experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory 1. The wait - over two hours to get seated. Which was more than what we were told  2. When we finally get to the table and order drinks. One glass cake with shards of glass all over it which then got all over the table. Two people at the table cut themselves on the glass. Hopefully the person that had the glass didn't accidentally drink any glass.  3. Another waiter accidentally dropped a gravy boat that hit my sister  4. After all this shit, they didn't offer us free dessert or anything. Any other restaurant would have done something. But nope not here. Just trying to get as many people into the restaurant as possible so they can make money. They clearly don't care about cleaning the glasses/tables and making sure their customers don't I don't know EAT GLASS! HORRIBLE!!!!!!"
Naomi S.,"Jenkintown, PA",74,17,43,3.0,3/15/2017,Great food! I had the chicken parm pizza style and it was good! Service was questionable.  It was my two children and I and she was pretty scarce at our table while frequenting others much more often and with more enthusiasm. Otherwise they had a good experience.
Amy L.,"Exton, PA",4,89,780,2.0,9/17/2017,"I have been to KOP location like quarterly for many years but this time, I think the quality of food went down so much. Let's start by ,1st, in the past, they provide single-serve butter from organic valley or Kerrygold but today, they serve a slice of butter on a small dish that I feel like eating in a diner.  Then, the portion of food starts to reduce and how could I tell? The pasta/noodles of Chicken Bellagio is cut into half to make it look huge but ,in the past, it was long pasta/noodles. For a high-end restaurant (or maybe I am wrong Cheesecake Factory is not a fine restaurant), they don't break pasta.  Finally, they are famous for their Cheesecake and usually it can be shared by four people but I feel like the cake which I ordered today is from skinny menu. how about service? as bad as food so I am so disappointed by their changes and maybe the corporation make bad decisions to do all mentioned change."
Jey K.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,6,,4.0,11/29/2017,"Used to be good. It has become costly when compared to Carrabba's for the same fare. Also, their wait time for a table nowadays is killing."
Veronica S.,"Lititz, PA",1,23,4,5.0,4/15/2017,"Was surprised there was only a small wait. Wish it was nicer outside to sit on the patio.  I had the Cauliflower ""steak"" on top of spinach with corn onion tomato mixed couscous. For dessert had the Resees peanut butter cup cheesecake Absolutely delicious meal all around. Waitress Donna was very attentive and funny. I'll definitely be returning. Great atmosphere, food and friendly staff."
Lauren L.,"Dillsburg, PA",20,92,253,5.0,1/6/2017,"Excellent service and tasty food! Our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly, and both my mom and I enjoyed our white chicken chili and cheesecake. The portions were very generous!"
Brian C.,"Exton, PA",0,1,,1.0,11/10/2017,"If there is zero star system I would not give this place a one star.  Party of nine reservation was made and was given a table that fits only 5 people. The manager is full of excuses and extremely rude, borderline racist, showing no willingness to remediate the situation.   We will never go to this place again."
Jessie H.,"Manhattan, NY",276,928,650,4.0,12/23/2015,Initially I was going to give this place a 3 based on my previous experiences - HOWEVER I came here for the first time in a year or so and they really improved!! Service is super attentive and food comes out pretty fast! We got the summer rolls to share- it's a different take if you were expecting Viet summer rolls.  Lots of noodles inside-I thought it still tasted pretty good- comes with two sauces.  I got the lunch portion for the chicken carbonara. I usually get the same dish no matter which cheesecake factory location I'm at it. It is pretty consistent and this was no different. Overall I had a very pleasant experience coming here for lunch!! Would recommend coming here- I believe the dinner portions are a lot bigger- be warned.
Lyndsey D.,"Media, PA",0,6,9,4.0,8/1/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory on a weekday afternoon for lunch. My party of two was seated almost immediately.  The tables were a little crammed together and the restaurant a little noisy so I would recommend requesting a booth.  I ordered the four cheese pasta with shredded parmesan on too and it was delicious and HUGE, I could only eat half. Would highly recommend this dish. For dessert I got the S'mores cheesecake to go, which was amazing as well and a sizable piece. However, cheesecake is a little pricey, around $8.  Overall experience; a really yummy restaurant that will leave customers satisfied but I would suggests going in unusual hours to avoid crowds."
Lizelle A.,"Blairsville, PA",191,386,1661,4.0,11/8/2015,You have to expect busyness and a little mayhem here. My sister and I hadn't been back in a while and forgot how huge the portions are. Well her Alfredo pasta was quite large for lunch. But I could've eaten 3 or 4 servings of the firecracker salmon rolls. Those are bangolicious.  All the food came quickly.  I like how they have the lighter menu so I had the mini crab cakes which are the perfect lunch size portion. My nephew didn't finish his food but most kids don't and the fruit cup was big enough to feed a small family. The only part that bugged me was at the end when the waitress had to get me change and after waiting 20 mins I still had to give her a dollar to make it even out. Oh well. This is a nice restaurant to catch up with your peeps.
Amy F.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,4,,1.0,11/12/2017,"I have been to three different Cheesecake Factory restaurant and this is the second one that is super super dirty!!!!!  Me and my husband decided to go and get Cheesecake and avocado egg rolls (which are my favorite). I ordered coffee while we waited for our food. I got the coffee, put creamer in it to my shock the cup had dried stuck on lettuce disgusting!!!! I then said to the waitress this is disgusting I don't want the coffee. Her reaction was not apologetic at all, she's like oh ok. Like this is normal!!! Needless to say I will not be going back. It's a shame I do like their food but now wonder if the plate is clean. The last time I was there the bathroom was also disgusting paper everywhere and tampon laying on the floor. Yuck"
Michael S.,"Conshohocken, PA",1,29,45,3.0,1/1/2017,"Always enjoy a trip to the Cheese Cake Factory! We had mojitos, the egg roll sampler, bistro shrimp pasta, factory gran burrito, and the lemon meringue cheesecake with some Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheese cake. Never disappointed!!"
Carolyn B.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,14,,2.0,11/4/2017,At 2:00 on a weekday you would think you could get a clean table and good service--not at this restaurant.  We were seated at a dirty table and when we asked for someone to clean it things went down hill.  The dirty bread plate sat on our table the entire meal without being replaced.  The server was just plain rude.  The food was good but I'm not sure we will go back.
Laura M.,"Annapolis, MD",30,155,409,5.0,5/31/2016,"It seems like a lot of people dislike this place, but I always enjoy it! Whenever I come to the Cheesecake Factory, I always leave satisfied. The food is consistent and always tasty. They have a large menu with a vast variety - there is definitely something for everyone! The service has always been great and timely. There are no reservations, which can mean a long wait time since it is in the always crowded King of Prussia mall. Going at ""slower/off peak"" times certainly helps with the wait time. The outside tables are also a great option when the weather is nice. We have sat in the bar area when there was a long wait and experienced the same great service and skipped the wait.  I have been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner many times. The lettuce wraps and southern egg rolls are my favorite appetizers. I also enjoy the beet salad and Greek salad as small plates. My favorite entrees are the orange chicken or the spicy cashew chicken. The portions are huge, which is a plus! They also have the orange chicken as a lunch special. My go-to cheesecake is the original with strawberry!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for consistently great food  and service. I'll be back again soon."
Bobby M.,"West Chester, PA",246,76,41,5.0,5/26/2016,"This is my favorite spot for solid food. Brunch is amazing with their eggs Benedict and chicken and waffles. I hate to say this, but the brunch is better than Sabrina's in Philadelphia. People always downplay how good the food here is which baffles me because I haven't had one bad meal here yet"
