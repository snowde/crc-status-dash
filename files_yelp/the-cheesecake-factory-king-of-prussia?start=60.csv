Courtney C.,"Warrington, PA",39,219,287,2.0,7/3/2017,"I went to this Cheesecake Factory because I thought it would be a nice change of pace from the Willow Grove location I normally go to. And boy ... was I wrong. It started with the staff who immediately was not friendly. I know they were busy, I understand that but simple niceties would have been appreciated. Then the experience went down hill from there. My friend and I both ordered and my friend was delivered the wrong dish. Okay the waiter comped it but he made it seem as if it was my friend's fault when really the waiter just misheard him apparently. I am sure there are plenty of people who do order something and when they get it say it's not what they ordered (shame on these people) but the waiter clearly misheard him and so when my friend asked what it was, he told him what it was and said that is what he ordered. It was a battle about taking it back, my friend hates wasting and was going to eat it anyway but the waiter offered to swap it (+1) but his tone just seemed very peeved. ""I can swap it but we cook it fresh so it's gonna take awhile"". Okay ... Then my food that I ordered was super liquid-y. I had a dish with a cream sauce and instead of cream it was soup. The sauce didn't even stick to my pasta. It just tastes watery and bland. We had to ask for more bread and drinks , normally we get asked if we want more. And then to top it all off the place, as another yelper had mentioned. It needed a face lift. I realized once my plate was clear that below it was a giant crater from which the entire top surface of the table was removed (the faux marble effect ) to reveal its undersurface - rough and raw. We skipped out on Cheesecake after everything that has gone wrong thus far. And then we left to use the bathroom and there were not even enough bathrooms I waited and waited and had to leave. With a restaurant that huge why do you only have 3 bathrooms? I know that is not the restaurants fault, but it was just another sour note on my first and only poor Cheesecake Factory experience - and I have had a drink spilled on me. Needless to say, I won't be going back!"
Noel B.,"Royersford, PA",39,27,3,5.0,6/4/2017,Food is good and service is usually pretty good. Be prepared for long wait times on Friday & Saturday
John Z.,"New York, NY",8,34,,2.0,11/3/2016,"Came for dinner with a couple of friends. The hostess was not too friendly that night.  I ordered a salad, they sure give you large portions here, but the quality was subpar. Now I am not comparing this to other restaurants, but compared to other Cheesecake Factory, the quality was inconsistent. For a restaurant that prides itself on consistency, this was a let down."
Sari S.,"Duluth, GA",177,258,2354,4.0,4/16/2016,"Visited: 02/22/2016 We visited while in KOP to grab a quick lunch. Coming from GA, we all know this is a chain that is pretty much everywhere I look now :D When we visited it wasn't during the busy lunch rush hour so we were served in a timely manner. Everything was great as usual :) I admit I'm a fan because it's a go to spot when you're in certain locations or you know exactly what you want from this place. In all my years of experience with The Cheesecake Factory, I've only had terrible service once. Trust me, it was handled, though not as well as it should have from the manager, but handled. Overall, it's my go to so I'd consider myself a fan."
Ricky B.,"Hattiesburg, MS",43,53,42,4.0,4/9/2017,"Stopped in here to fuel a day of retail therapy. Being 12:30 on a Sunday, there was a 20 minute wait for a table for 4, but the time quickly went by as we all stared at the variety of cheesecakes offered, of which there are plenty! After we were seated and ordered, the food took a good while to arrive, but the restaurant was visibly packed, so the wait was understandable. I had the Thai lettuce wraps, which never fail to disappoint, and more importantly, leave room for a piece of cheesecake. I had the hazelnut crunch cheesecake which is quickly becoming my favorite; who wouldn't want a cheesecake topped with Nutella!?"
Josh R.,"Greenfield Township, PA",0,11,,3.0,7/18/2017,"The food was excellent. I had the cuban sandwich and it was good. The margarita was also good. I wish i could tell about the fries, but our server, Kimberly, forgot them. Kimberly completely forgot our fries and didnt bring them until we were done. I dont think Kimberly tried her best. Also it was so dark i couldnt see the menu or my sandwich and bit my finger. It would be a nice 4 stars, but Kimberly + my sore thumb = 3"
Ted H.,"Bechtelsville, PA",0,2,,1.0,7/23/2017,Third time here and definitely last...service was horrible...over an hour till we had our entrees...server brought us the wrong appetizer and the replacement wasn't brought till we got our meals....and then he charged us for both appetizers....brought us our check without even asking if we wanted dessert... and then we ordered cheesecake to go which took another 25 minutes...never going back...plus the food was okay nothing special
Tam H.,"Centreville, MD",33,3,1,2.0,7/23/2017,"For as big as the mall is, I thought this location would have decent service. Our appetizer was flavorful & decent, which is why I give this place an extra star. We waited 20 mins for a server to take our order for drinks. I ordered the shrimp tacos that had zero flavor. Even the side of broccoli had zero flavor, even after adding copious amounts of salt & pepper. My husband's spicy chicken chipotle pasta was bone dry, it didn't have enough sauce. Last, our server never came back to refill any of our drinks."
A M.,"Southampton, PA",0,48,,2.0,3/11/2017,I have never seen a Cheesecake Factory with as a ridiculous wait time as this location. An hour and a half to be seated??? And then the line just to order Cheesecake is insane. How come I haven't had this issue at other locations such as Princeton and Cherry Hill?? The food is not that good to wait even 30- 45 min.  I refuse to go to this location and caution against others to attend this location as well.. unless you have 4 days to wait for a table. Go around the corner to California Pizza Kitchen (that's what we ended up doing)- great food and friendly service and a reasonable wait time.
Marc S.,"Royersford, PA",0,101,9,3.0,7/30/2017,Not the greatest food you'll ever have but you won't go hungry!  Large menu to choose from with calorie counts beside each dish making you second guess each choice for fear of needing either a cardiologist or bariatric surgery!  Seriously with each dish being over 1300 calories it takes the joys out of eating out.   Cap your meal with a piece of their signature cheese cake and you have had a week's worth of calories at one meal!
Paige G.,"Elverson, PA",89,108,127,4.0,9/13/2015,"I have been here many times and it's always a good choice. I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this is nice every once in a while. The menu has something for everyone and is very extensive but expensive. Also it's very dark in the restaurant and the wait can be incredibly long.  However, the portion sizes are ridiculous and I usually split a meal when I go. One thing I don't like is that you leave the restaurant feeling like you ate way too much. The cheesecake is pretty expensive but is delicious. I love all the options, my two favorites are the Hershey chocolate bar and the s'mores. I usually order Evelyn's favorite pasta and it's nice and light and delicious with fresh veggies and pine nuts in an olive oil sauce.  Favorites in our family include the Thai lettuce wraps, the factory burrito and the avocado turkey sandwich. They give you bread while you are waiting for your food which is pretty delicious. Just save room for all the food to come."
Nick L.,"Reading, PA",161,2,5,5.0,10/16/2016,There is something to be said about a restaurant that has 250 + items on the menu and a completely from scratch kitchen. This company knows what there doing. I've  Been going here often for years now. People are waiting 2 hours to eat on a Saturday night for a reason!
Elena F.,"Wayne, PA",27,6,3,2.0,3/13/2017,"Unbelievably slow and poor service. We were seated immediately but it took at least 10 minutes for our waiter to show up for drink orders. 15 minutes later drinks showed up. Then, when dinner came, I ordered a glass of wine... that never came. Of course it was on the bill. We asked for dessert menus to order to go and it took him 15 minutes to come back. At least the food was good..."
Brie C.,"Schnecksville, PA",0,5,4,4.0,6/30/2017,"My teenagers love it here. However, the last few times we've been here the service seems very rushed. On our visit 6/24/17 we were not even given app plates for our appetizers and bread. I'm still giving it four stars because the food is dependable, the mixed drinks are good, and the cheesecake is delicious. Attention to detail and cleanliness could be improved."
Erin T.,"Norfolk, VA",0,13,17,5.0,5/24/2017,Cheesecake Factory has always been great place to eat but it's an extra special treat to have the waiter be so nice and attentive.
Eric K.,"Chicago, IL",244,80,,2.0,9/7/2016,"We stopped in for Dessert about a half hour before closing time on Monday night and were seated outside.  My friends ordered strawberries and pumpkin cheesecake. I first tried to order a brownie sundae but your brownies were frozen so I ordered a rocky road sundae. My sundae came and after eating the whip cream I realized it was just a chocolate sundae. Our waiter never came back to ask how things were until we were done eating. I let him know it had no nuts or marshmallow in it. He said ""Oh I didn't come back because I was eating"" and ""it's the end of the night so they probably weren't paying attention"" No apology - nothing free - no care in the world. I certainly felt like we were an inconvenience instead of a customer. Never again.  Is Grande Luxe better?"
Kat R.,"Kew Gardens, Queens, NY",68,249,188,3.0,6/11/2015,"Ehhh same as any other Cheesecake factory. The food was good, came out hot and tasted fine. Service here wasn't that great. Server wasn't very attentive & the hostess was a bit abrupt. We went for lunch for my daughter's graduation. I had pasta jambalaya. It was very spicy. My daughter had pasta carbonara. & my sis had some chicken & pasta dish. We also had the loaded tator tots for an appetizer. Those things are really good!"
Bon Appe'tit M.,"Ambler, PA",13,63,305,5.0,7/23/2016,Everything was really good! No waiting when we get there last night. People are friendly. Yes! Definitely coming back for more!!!
Alex K.,"Highland, CA",0,4,3,2.0,6/23/2017,"This place must have an exceptionally large air conditioning bill, i cant say I have ever ate in a place so cold. My family walked in and sat down and the first thing we notice is that the silverware is dirty with bits of food still on it, not appetizing. They get us new silverware, and our waitress was really nice about the situation and apologetic. As for the food, it kills you to look at the menu and see that the lowest calorie dish is a salad at over 1,000 calories. I chose the bacon burger and it was 1700 calories. That leaves me with 300 calories to use in my daily standard calorie intake. The prices were a bit high but the food was alright. A solid two star."
Nat M.,"Philadelphia, PA",27,255,577,4.0,5/26/2015,"Always have a great meal at Cheescake Factory. I've gone there and made a meal from the appetizers alone! Some of my favorites are the avocado rolls and Thai rolls. Our server was friendly and informative. Love that they now have a calorie conscious menu! The flatbreads from this menu are yummy. There are limited low calorie drinks and I tried their mojo to, which was ok. Love the cheesecake!! For Center city dwellers - a Cheesecake Factory was opened at 1430 Walnut St!!"
