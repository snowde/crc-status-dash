L F.,"Wayne, PA",0,19,,2.0,9/22/2017,"We did not have the best experience for dinner.  Service was lacking.  Our server was pretty much nowhere to be found.  I had to flag someone down just to get a simple refill for an iced tea and some ketchup (for my cold fries).  We were looking forward to ordering some cheesecake for dessert but skipped it due to the crappy service.  Highly doubt we will be going back again. I'm sure I will get the same blanket response from the ""business manager"" that the rest of reviews received."
Chase S.,"Philadelphia, PA",45,45,2,3.0,6/3/2017,"The best part of this meal was that they have this ""skinnylicious"" menu, so I could get something without a ton of butter, cream, sauce, fried stuff, etc. And keep track of my calories and have a pretty good idea where they were coming from. I had the salmon with grilled veggies (several hundred fewer calories on the skinny menu than the ""same"" thing on the regular menu which tells you a lot about how they prepare their food... probably a lot of butter!). I don't remember what my partner had for dinner because for dessert he got some insane cheesecake that had reese's cups and butterfinger and was sensational.  Things to know: there were only two of us at maybe 6pm and we had to wait 45 mins. By the time we were being seated, the wait was over an hour. It was totally packed. The girls in charge of taking the buzzer, printing out your little ticket, then looking at each ticket to seat each party, kept accidentally putting away tickets for parties they hadn't seated, which meant things got very backed up.  Given how busy it was, our service once we were seated was very good. Also if you're given a buzzer, make sure yours lights up with a red number at the tip, because mine didn't and when I came back to the hostess to ask about it she said the battery had died. My wait could have been waaay longer!"
Jason G.,"Braintree, MA",2,9,,4.0,3/4/2017,The King of Prussia location is one of the best restaurants in the national chain. Good service and good food no matter the time you get there.
Roberto S.,"Glenolden, PA",0,3,3,3.0,4/23/2016,"It was Okay .  I had the CHARGRILLED COULOTTE STEAK (medium well) which came with mashed potatoes and green peas. The steak was salty and dry, the mashed potatoes and peas were very oily as well as salty. However, it was only $20 so I didn't mind that much. Overall it was fair, the waiters are slow and the food takes forever to come out, so plan on that before going . Also go between 4-5 and you won't have to wait in line at all !"
Dave S.,"Bloomsburg, PA",2,4,,1.0,6/4/2016,"We came here to celebrate my sister's graduation from medical school and I had my worst experience at a restaurant to date.  First, they messed up my wife's order. When she brought it to our waiter's, Shawn's, attention, he initially argued with her about what she ordered. Nevertheless, he took the dish back. In the meantime, my dad found a wad of garbage (two pieces of crumpled paper; looked like the paper between cheese slices) in his salad. At this point, having had some time to fume about the waiter's reaction and now finding garbage in our food, we demanded a manager. The manager came by and... eh. He almost seemed frustrated/confrontational. It was awkward. Regardless, he didn't do much to save the experience. It was at about this time that we had to remind them they never brought out my daughter's fries. All 7 of us were disgusted by the whole experience and those of us that got our food, prematurely stopped eating and just boxed our food. Everyone wanted to leave asap. They took three meals off the bill, but there was no saving things at this point. Ending on a positive - bartender made a mean Moscow Mule. Kudos bartender."
Clare C.,"Morton, PA",39,16,,5.0,10/15/2016,"Was in for lunch today with my family. We were very happy with our food. I'm posting this review because I wanted to acknowledge how much we liked our server, Leigh.  She had a really friendly, upbeat personality. It was my grandmother's first time at the Cheesecake Factory, and Leigh was SO sweet to her. When my grandmother said that in 94 years she had never tried cheesecake before, Leigh replied ""94? You don't look a day over 21!"" and my grandmother was absolutely tickled by that.  Also, my parents accidentally left their credit card in the billfold and Leigh chased us out into the mall to give it back to them.  We all really appreciated the exceptional service. We will definitely be asking for Leigh when we come back :)"
Lauren P.,"Philadelphia, PA",48,3,,1.0,8/23/2017,"I visited the cheesecake factory King of Prussia Location at 7:00pm on Tuesday, August 22, 2017. Following Patio seating, our server, Gregory, promptly greeted us, took our drink order, and returned shortly thereafter for our meal order. The meal order was taken no later than 7:15/7:20pm.  I ordered the skinnylicious Chicken Salad Sandwich and my husband the Cashew Chicken. We did not receive our dinner until 8:10pm. This was a 50 minute wait for a sandwich and a chicken/rice dish! Before I even had the opportunity to mention the long wait to our server, he took the liberty of apologizing for the delay and twice checked with the kitchen on our meals. We watched two other tables that sat after us receive their food before us (one was a party of five).  Gregory, our server, said he would speak to management to see if we could be compensated for our trouble and came back with the offer of free cheesecake, which was very kind; however, I don't like cheesecake. I would have rather seen one of our four $10 glasses of wine comped. My husband and I each had two glasses of wine before our food even arrived. I located a manager at the check in desk following the dinner to share our experience. I explained I had worked in the food service industry and understand delays, but that our food took almost an hour to arrive. His response was ""Almost an hour. I didn't realize the kitchen was that behind"". After that, he simply said he was sorry - there was no further conversation and he did not seem to be overly concerned. I didn't say it out loud, but thought to myself that as a manager, he should realize how far behind the kitchen is. When i walked in his was at the reception desk and when i walked out he was at the reception desk. Maybe he should move beyond the desk? Also, if our server informed him of our wait, he also should have stopped by our table. Having worked in the food service industry, I understand the etiquette when there is an issue.  I regret to say that I did not ask for his name, but he was an older tall slim gentleman with white hair. We are customers that often frequent the KOP Cheesecake Factory and never leave with a bill under $70 or $80 dollars. I want to ensure you understand that we were not looking for a free meal. I was disappointed with the management of the situation; I expected more. With all of the new restaurants in the KOP area, I can tell you that we will not be back.  PS: Greg was a WONDERFUL server. Hold onto him! He is a good one."
Blake S.,"Manteo, NC",23,84,,5.0,1/7/2017,"This place never disappoints. Great food, good service, huge menu, and of course awesome cheescake. Always look forward to going out to the Cheesecake Factory."
Brittany S.,"Wyomissing, PA",214,13,3,5.0,12/26/2016,"Had a wonderful experience tonight at the KOP Cheesecake Factory. The service was slow, BUT the food was amazing. I had a frozen strawberry daiquiri that tasted like fresh strawberries. We had the buffalo blasts for an appetizer, and for dinner my boyfriend had the chicken tacos and I had the garlic noodles with grilled chicken. Our meals were cooked perfectly and were full of flavor. We will definitely be back!"
Bob M.,"Central San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,80,23,5.0,3/19/2017,"Of all the cheesecake factory branches, the King if Prussia mall branch has been constantly serving good dishes with good service. With others, it's been hit or miss. Crossing fingers. Kudos to management for doing a fine job of hiring and training a winning team."
Sylwia P.,"Merion Station, PA",0,16,2,1.0,8/2/2017,"So incredibly upset with the service I received this evening. I took my cousin from out of town to eat at this location since we had a less than pleasant experience in Philly last time. The only reason I keep coming back is the food. For starters our waiter didn't greet us for a while and when he did he only asked for drinks, I had to stop him from leaving so we could order apps. He drops our drinks then runs off. He comes back takes our order, and then the waiting starts. We never received bread, the table next to us got it.  We figured our apps wouldn't take longer than 15 minutes since we ordered them early... wrong. It took 29 minutes. How do I know you may ask? I was sending a text as the waiter approached to take our entree order and once I realized the apps were taking forever I just checked the time stamp 8:38. Our apps arrive at 9:07. Yes I'm timing at this point because I'm getting angry. We dig in but not once did our waiter check on us not like he had the chance to because 6 minutes after our apps hit the table so did our entree. We're half way through apps and we start our dinner. We didn't get to finish either because we were too full, everything was so horribly spaced out. As we finish with our dirty plates stacked in front of us we realize not once did our waiter check to see if the food was okay how we were doing if we needed refills NOTHING. I was at a loss for words at the end of dinner. I have worked as a server for 8 years while being a student and I would be appalled at myself if I ever served someone so horribly. Clearly this guy was not meant to be a server. I let the manager know and his excuse was no not him, he's better than that. Something tells me he's not. I get people have bad days but when you see people next to you being taken care of well by the same person it makes you question. I won't be returning to this location, I would rather travel to jersey."
Yichi C.,"Bellevue, WA",44,2,,2.0,2/19/2017,"I had the worst experience in Cheesecake factory last week. The food was okay but the service was bad!! The waitress was unprofessional, never filled our water or ask if we need anything else. After we finished our appetizer, we waited for 35 mins to get our entrees (If we dont ask, I dont know how long it will take). During the 35 mins, she didnt even stop by. I was very disappointed of the service."
Alan O.,"Midwest City, OK",5,79,121,4.0,1/1/2016,"You can't go wrong w/TCF. Our server/waitress, Marlene was on point and very attentive to our needs. She was the best that we've had, out of the TCF restaurants that we've been to in Maryland and California. I just there was one closer to Carlisle , PA. We'll be back!"
Dee C.,"River Vale, NJ",295,864,354,3.0,6/22/2015,"I had never been to one until this night.   Was a bit disappointed in the menu - until they brought out the skinny menu. Regular menu is sort of like a higher class Cracker Barrel.  It's good but not good for you.  I can see why people like this place. Skinny menu provided me with a salad around 500 calories.  Was good but not great. My gf had a ""slice"" of cheesecake and it was a bit over the top."
Chip S.,"Phoenixville, PA",1,6,,5.0,5/1/2016,My wife and I go to the Cheesecake Factory at least once a month and sit at the bar to eat and drink. They have the best bartenders and especially Caesar!   We went for my birthday a few weeks ago and Caesar did not disappoint. At the end of the meal I had ordered the big chocolate cake to take home. Little did I know that they had put the cake on a plate with a candle and Happy Birthday writing. Also a few of the staff sang Happy Birthday to me!  Just a nice touch to a great evening at the Cheesecake Factory. If you have to wait it is always worth it!
Julio C.,"Juniata, Philadelphia, PA",106,73,130,4.0,5/11/2017,always have a good time there the chicken and shrimp gumbo over white rice is my favorite dish
Kayleigh P.,"Malvern, PA",41,126,224,5.0,6/17/2016,"Good service and good food tonight. No complaints at all. Love, love, love the fried mac-n- cheese balls!!!"
Michael P.,"King of Prussia, PA",300,104,3834,3.0,3/6/2016,"Fine. Loud. Hit or miss food.  My friend and I arrived at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Normally I don't come to Cheesecake Factory because of their insane waits. In fact, even though I could see it out my bedroom window for 10 years, I had only been to this location once. While we had a backup restaurant if the wait was terrible, we were told 10 minutes and actually seated in 5 minutes. We got a small table near the back. And when I say small table, I mean small table.  It barely fit our drinks and appetizer. We  struggled throughout the meal not to knock things off of it. Unfortunately, it was virtually on top of the table next to ours as well. At least it enabled us to become friendly with the foursome to our side. We waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to finally come over. Once he did, we requested water, which we had not yet received. My friend ordered a half bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne, because she was in a bad mood and decided to splurge, even though the half bottle cost more than a full bottle at a store. The waiter then told us that they don't have half bottles, but my friend pointed it out on the menu. Despite their very poor beer list, they did have Stone IPA in bottles.  So I ordered one of those. The waiter returned about five minutes later with the half bottle of champagne and a bucket to keep it chilled as well as my beer.   My friend and I decided to split an order of nachos for an appetizer, and I ordered a hamburger medium rare you know why she ordered a chicken dish for our entrees. I have to admit the nachos were surprisingly good. They seemed very fresh with lots of cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. I ended up eating more of them that I had expected. However, they were the best part of the meal. Unfortunately, our entrees were not nearly as good as the nachos. My burger, which again, I had ordered medium rare, was well done. It was dry and relatively tasteless. It was also not brought with the condiments I had requested on the side. It also came with a very small side of fries. I was just not in the mood to send it back and wait for another one though. My friend's chicken, which I did not taste since I don't eat chicken, was cold and tasteless. She said it was cooked, but cold. At least I could order another Stone IPA and she could enjoy her champagne.    For dessert, we split the ""ADAM'S PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE CHEESECAKE (Creamy Cheesecake Swirled with Caramel, Peanut Butter, Butterfingers® and Reese's® Peanut Butter Cups.)"" It was good, but not great. It kind of tasted like it had come out of a box.   Overall the service was pretty good. After the initial delayed water and misunderstanding about the champagne, our server was attentive except for the condiments, and it is not his fault that the entrees were not good. The restaurant itself was quite loud, measuring 93 decibels.  I won't say that I will never come back, but with so many good options in the area I'm unlikely to be back anytime soon. The very poorly executed entrées and the pathetic beer list really kind of ruined it for me."
John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,896,34,2.0,3/22/2016,"As expected, solidly mediocre cuisine served in huge portions. Finished with the a Key Lime cheesecake - tasty."
Ali S.,"Alexandria, VA",4,2,,1.0,7/20/2017,"Terrible customer service. Just awful. We had a takeout order and they forgot an item. When I called to see about coming back to get the item, I had to speak to two different people, both of whom were extremely rude. Then, when I drove 20 minutes back to the restaurant to get it and arrived at curbside takeout, I called in to the restaurant to tell them I was there and had to talk to another very rude person. They kept me waiting another ten minutes and when they finally brought the item to my car, the woman who brought it acted like I was a complete annoyance to her. It was unbelievable! Absolute incompetence and rudeness from start to finish. There are plenty of other restaurants that don't treat their customers like trash. I suggest you spend your money at one of those."
