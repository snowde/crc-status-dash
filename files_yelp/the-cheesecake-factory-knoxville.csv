Marqueta L.,"Ooltewah, TN",5,13,,4.0,11/26/2017,Dropped in for a late lunch on Black Friday. Our party did not have to wait very long to be seated which was a surprise on such a busy shopping day. The service was great and the food was awesome as always! We tried a couple of slices of cheesecake and they were amazing as expected. Great place for a great meal! Never disappoints!
Canny F.,"Knoxville, TN",590,1444,5771,2.0,3/10/2017,"I had a feeling I wouldn't like it.  Huge menu. They basically make every cuisine. I'm generally not a fan of restaurants that can make everything because that means they don't make it great. Let's say you have a specific problem, do you want to be seen by a specialist or a general practitioner? Yes, the general practitioner can help you but their skills are limited since they need to know everything in general instead of in detail. If you are going to spend money and consume calories, don't waste a meal - go get the real deal.  My study buddy was craving cheesecake one night while studying and arrived 30 minutes before closing. She ordered 2 types of cheesecakes so I was able to try the nutella cheesecake. I also had the strawberry cheesecake from my neighbor. From both experiences, consumed on different days, I felt like I was eating mouse. What's the deal with the texture? If you are a fan of less dense cheesecakes, I recommend coming here. They have an extensive list of cheesecake flavors. Not sure why you would come here for anything else besides cheesecakes but that's just me being judgy."
Bernard M.,"Knoxville, TN",2,27,,3.0,12/11/2017,"Ordered lunch special of French onion soup, Caesar salad, and 1/2 chicken salad sammich. The soup was pedestrian, prepared with not much TLC. Salad was fine, but underdressed. SAMMICH WAS, high, FUNNY. I'd say maybe a QUARTER CUP of salad was placed on bread. Check out the pic. Cheesecake was good, of course."
Kayla E.,"Bristol, TN",130,6,4,5.0,10/19/2017,I LOVE The Cheesecake Factory! Every time my husband and I are in Knoxville this is where we eat! The customer service is always on point! The food is always hot and fresh and tastes wonderful!
Kelsey S.,"Knoxville, TN",21,86,117,5.0,9/2/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places in terms of dessert (obviously, who doesn't love some good cheesecake).  I tend to get a bit overwhelmed by their massive menu, but I stepped outside of my normal orange chicken comfort zone and got the bang bang chicken and shrimp on the last visit.   I love Indian, Thai, Japanese, Chinese foods and this was like the perfect blend of some Thai and Indian flavors.  There were nice curry flavors, a slight kick of chile, and a sweet bite from coconut.  The chicken was incredibly juicy and had soaked up all the flavor of the sauce.  The shrimp was the same and mixing it all with the huge pile of white rice was the perfect bite.  For dessert, we tried the new cheesecake flavor they've added to the menu.  I'm Nutella's biggest fan, so when I see they've got a chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake, topped with Nutella, there's no way I'm turning it down.  The ""crust"" is a blondie (stop right there and wipe the drool before I continue) and it has a hazelnut crunch layer on top of it before starting the swirled chocolate hazelnut cheesecake that makes the whole thing worth it.  Add the drizzle of Nutella on top and get a dollop of whipped cream in each bite, and you're on cloud nine of cheesecake heaven.  We had good service to boot, which makes this visit an easy 5 stars."
Laura H.,"Austin, TX",96,101,157,3.0,3/11/2017,I was not impressed with our waitress. She barely came around. We got an appetizer of chips & spinach artichoke dip. Weird to get sour cream & pico with it. Chips were extremely salty. Meal came out good. My fav dish chicken Madeira ... we got cheesecake to go and def received big slices. Normally the carrot cake cheesecake has super small pieces not this time.
JC B.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,,2.0,11/3/2017,I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory and I'll I've heard was good things about it. I was sadly let down with the service and quality of food. I had somewhere to be after when I ate and I asked for a club sandwich. It took the waitress about 30 minutes to tell me that they did not have turkey for the sandwich and I had to pick something else. I then got a blt and the bread on it about sliced my mouth open it was so dry and hard (and I know it isn't supposed to be soft). The only positive note I have is that some of the other people I was with seemed to have some pretty good food.
Cliff K.,"Knoxville, TN",39,88,68,4.0,6/9/2017,Much better this go around. The place was not crowded at 8:00 PM. Only a 5 minute wait on a Friday night! We ordered the egg roll sampler appetizer and the tamale cakes. They were really good. That was definitely enough for two. Ordered the peanut butter cheesecake to go.
Mimi J.,"Foley, AL",0,6,,2.0,10/21/2017,"Really disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory.  Certainly is not indicative of most Cheesecake Factory's. There were 4 of us and our meal was not good nor was it hot, to say the least! The portion of white chicken chili -no sides- for $14.50, was a joke! Huge bowl with, perhaps, a cup of chili in it. Will not return."
Michael C.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,1,1.0,10/14/2017,"Cheesecake Factory- I am normally thrilled with the food and the service. I took my son there earlier this week. His dish was cold and his rice was crunchy. Maybe I expected too much. They replaced his meal but still charged full price for his meal. I expected them to comp his meal. (The first meal was comped but the second meal was charged in full.) I filled out the survey and got a call from their management. I was told they followed their policy. At a nice restaurant you pay for service and good food. This time it did not happen. I at least expected some discount or something. It will be a WHILE before they get more of my money. If you have money to spend and don't mind cold food that you wait for, go for this location. If not, pick somewhere else."
Jeff L.,"Knoxville, TN",113,9,1,2.0,9/11/2017,Very disappointing experience. This place is pricey and our food was below average to say the least. The waitress recommended loaded tater tot's and they tasted like crap.  Then we got fish tacos with black beans and rice.  The rice and beans were undercooked and cold. The tacos were decent. But for $15 he would definitely expect more. We did have a cheeseburger connoisseur with us and she was disappointed as well. We did complain about the cold rice and beans in the waitress was nice and gave us a free piece of cheese cake which definitely save the day. Very surprised there was a 15 minute wait to get in there. I know the cheesecake is good but seriously!??!?
Sabri T.,"La Follette, TN",0,9,13,2.0,1/16/2017,This is my second time here .. it was ok.. I had the meatloaf with mash potatoes. It was so so.. I also had  cold fried macaroni and cheese..
Robin B.,"Vonore, TN",1,15,,2.0,5/28/2016,"Glad I received a gift card so I could try this place because I'll never go back on my dime.  I can't complain about the wait because we went at 5:30 and only had to wait 10 min.  Hostess could have been friendlier.  The atmosphere is loud and crowded.  Tables so close together,  the waiter for my neighboring table had his ass in  my face three times.  Our waiter had a fake rehearsed manner about him. I'm sure due to his training.  I'd rather see his real personality. Utensils were laying directly on the table,  not a napkin so that grossed me out.  The prices are OUTRAGEOUS but what makes it worse is the food is mediocre. I'm willing to pay if the food is good.  My company ordered the beer battered French fries.  They looked nothing like the picture.  More like nuggets.  When you bit into them it was mushy like mashed potatoes and they were bland.  All you can taste is the grease.  I ordered a simple BBQ bacon cheeseburger for just under $14. Ridiculous! The flavor was good but it was small and the regular fries they offer are meh. I followed the advice of someone else who reviewed this place and asked how much a mojito would be because they do not list any drink prices.  The waiter said around $10.00. I about fell out of my seat.  My birthday was the day before so I went ahead and ordered one. Yes the glass was tall and flavor was good,  I drank it fast.  I had no buzz whatsoever so there must have been close to no alcohol in it.  It turned out to be $11.25! My company ordered the Tuscan chicken for $17.00 and it looked really pretty but had  no flavor except olive oil.  He had to put salt &  pepper on it.  He loved the tomatoes and artichoke that came with it though.   I'm glad I don't have a sweet tooth because I wasn't about to pay $8.00 for a piece of cheesecake.  If you come here,  keep in mind,  you are paying for the name,  not quality food. The best hamburger and fries can be found at Hot Rods in Maryville."
Aiden C.,"Knoxville, TN",0,11,12,5.0,2/4/2017,"Sunday evening, my taste buds where craving for sandwiches so I went to the Cheesecake Factory to taste the club with a side of fries and when they served the dish I chow do on that entree and boy was it good!!!"
April R.,"Maryville, TN",94,75,64,5.0,7/23/2016,"Is there anything bad to say about the Cheesecake Factory, (other than it takes about 25 minutes top wade through the menu and there is always a wait)? I love this place. It doesn't matter if it's an over priced chain to me. The Chicken Madeira is my very favorite thing and worth the price. It's a huge dish with two big chicken breasts laid upon mashed potatoes and asparagus. It's covered in a madeira sauce that you will want to lick off your plate. It's so big that you could split it...but you won't want to.  I've ordered other dishes and always go back to the madeira. I've also had the salmon, the orange chicken, the spaghetti...the list goes on and on and I've loved everything.  My husband and I are currently working our way through the cheesecake options. We've split about 10 pieces and loved each one."
Christina R.,"Moorpark, CA",162,12,,2.0,5/21/2017,"I came here with my family for lunch and waited an hour to be seated which we were fine with given it was a Sunday afternoon. When we were seated, our server was very sweet and kindly took our order. However, when we got our food my entire family got their food before I did and I had to wait an extra 15 min until I got my SALAD. One of the servers that assisted ours in delivering our food was extremely rude and gave my mom a dirty look when she asked if she could get some red pepper. I told our server about the rude girl and she said ""I know who you're talking about"" ....if you don't like working around people you shouldn't be serving them. The food was sub par, nothing special. I have been to better cheesecake factory's. It's safe to say I and my entire family will not be coming back to this location."
Rachelle S.,"Knoxville, TN",61,137,27,5.0,8/4/2015,Came here for lunch the other day. Every single food item was cooked perfectly! I tried the mushroom/avocado fries and they were really good.  One important thing to note is the fact that a nice young couple sat next to me. They were hearing impaired. I was curious how the restaurant would handle this. I was amazed when two waiters came over and spoke ASL fluently. How wonderful!
Cameron E.,"Knoxville, TN",18,37,118,4.0,12/8/2016,"I went to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time. We got served some white and whole wheat bread and butter. I got just water to drink. I had a Cuban sandwich, with fries. The decor of the restaurant reminds me up a nice upscale, but still casual restaurant. The menu, which has something for everyone, at a whopping 250 items! Wow! The price was on the higher side, but you get huge portions of food, even for Lunch! Our sever was quick and attentive in refilling our drinks!"
Anthony P.,"Knoxville, TN",1,32,3,5.0,12/3/2016,"Me and my wife went for our anniversary and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere is great but the serving staff could be better. The bartender knows what he's doing, the drink that my wife had was very good. We were seated very fast even though it was busy. We will be back again."
Juliet J.,"Morris, IL",3,5,,4.0,5/25/2017,Great food. Fresh and tasty. Service was good. Very consistent with what we have experienced with other CCF
Robert B.,"Knoxville, TN",35,79,3,2.0,1/19/2016,"Positives:  Beautiful interior, just beautiful.  It doesn't look like a factory at all!  Huge menu, something for everyone.  Cheesecake is wonderful.  Large portions. Negatives:  Way overpriced.  My wife and I got a gift card for Christmas.  Went for lunch.  Had 2 appetizers, split a fish and chips meal, split a cheesecake and had no drinks.  Over $50.00 with the tip.  What?  $50.00 for lunch after splitting a meal and dessert?  Really?  We tried to go for dinner a couple of times and the wait was ridiculous.  I don't understand the draw unless people are going in and having a slice of cheesecake only.  We finally decided to go when the place opened to avoid the crowds.  Food is good but not awesome.  Our waitress seemed a bit bothered by our requests.  She was quite busy.  She seemed a little miffed because my wife didn't like the tasteless weak iced tea and changed to coke. I would only return if Penny were my waitress."
Huri B.,"Kingsport, TN",4,6,9,5.0,3/6/2016,"I have been here several times! Getting better everyday and food is always great which Cheesecake Factory you go! Always crowded, we sat at the bar, they were so polite! Food was perfect as always!!"
Elizabeth N.,"Knoxville, TN",45,9,8,5.0,6/4/2017,"My husband and I went to celebrate our 15th anniversary. We have always enjoyed the food and last night was no exception. We had Buffalo Blasts to start and the serving was so large it could honestly be a meal in itself. I celebrated with a couple of Factory Peach Bellinis which is almost like having dessert and dinner at the same time. It's a delightful summery cocktail . My husband chose the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. I had a taste and it was delicious; not too spicy or too sweet. I had Pasta Napoletana. This dish is extraordinary with chunks of Italian sausage, slices of pepperoni, meatball, and lots of veggies. The pasta is a Parmesan cream pasta and the flavor is unique. The combination of tastes is like a party of deliciousness. For dessert he chose the strawberry cheesecake while I decided to try the Coffee and Cream Chocolate Supreme Cheesecake. If you miss the Kailua Cheesecake you will love this. It's almost like tiramisu and Cheesecake with chocolate cake on the bottom. Our server, Lexi, was attentive but not overbearing. She told us about all the new menu items. I highly recommend the Morrell location. Great food, great food, a great experience."
JD J.,"Kingston, TN",2,1,,1.0,1/22/2017,"Gave me a trash lemon, sat 5 people at a 4 person booth in high traffic, withheld pertinent cheesecake information just to make a sale, slow, terrible service and undercooked food. Never coming back.   I bought a $60 cheesecake for my mom's birthday dinner,  then after I paid for it they told me it was in a ""deep chill,"" and wouldn't be ready to eat for 2 hours. After waiting 45 minutes they sat my group of 5 people at a 4 person booth with an extra chair in the middle of a high traffic intersection when there were smaller parties at larger tables. Service was extremely slow and my food was undercooked.    This was almost within the margin of error for a busy restaurant, but what the waiter did next was entirely unacceptable. I asked for a sweet tea with lemon to go. I did nothing to the guy, but I'm sure he could tell I wasn't pleased with the over all service. I assume he thought I wouldn't notice because it had a lid, but the lemon he gave me was not fresh. I took off the lid to squeeze the lemon, and it had already been squeezed. I took a sip and there wasn't even a hint of lemon in my drink. It was an old used up lemon! Must have been pulled from someone else's old drink or out of the trash.   The manager didn't offer to comp the meal, or give future compensation, but it wouldn't matter because I won't be going back there, and I recommend everyone else to avoid this place as well."
Candice P.,"Knoxville, TN",0,9,,2.0,8/2/2017,"We arrived with a large party on a Sunday evening, late in the evening granted but the restaurant was still quite busy and it was 1/2 price cheesecake day.  We waited outside until our table was ready and as we were escorted to our table a waiter quite loudly stated, ""Oh you have to be kidding me.""  Yes, it was 9:45pm, yes, there were 12 of us, and yes it was well within your hours.   I did spin around when I heard him, an older gentleman with glasses, to let him know that I had heard his snarky greeting.  We were extremely thankful he was not our server and that said our waiter was super and the cheesecake top notch.  Unfortunately, when the staff clearly is not interested in treating customers properly, we will choose to take our business elsewhere in the future."
Melissa B.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,2,1.0,2/26/2017,"We had a gift card for Cheesecake Factory so we gave it a try. The place was SO crowded and loud on a Sunday at 4pm, that we got our order for take out. Our meals left much to be desired. Too greasy, heavy and flavorless. Prices are too high and portion sizes are too big. No one needs that much food for one meal. The nachos were cold. Before today, I have never paid $77.00 for a meal for 4 people ( with no drinks at all, no extras, no substitutions or desserts).  Well, we will save some $ in the future since we won't be back."
Steven D.,"Long Beach, CA",19,73,220,5.0,10/5/2015,"I have been going to Cheesecake Factories for a long time and the location in Knoxville has become my favorite go-to.  You can never go wrong with this chain since the food and portions are pretty large. Also, the cheesecakes are delicious, always."
Brandy A.,"Dandridge, TN",34,2,2,2.0,4/12/2016,"I was invited to The Cheesecake Factory by some friends who were in town. We were surprised to find that they don't take reservations. The wait was around an hour. The menu is far too large, and the prices are steep. The food is decent, but not up to the level of the pricing. The portions are large, though. We had the Thai lettuce wraps for the appetizer, and they were pretty good. I had the steak Diane, and found the steak to be average. The mashed potatoes were good. I tried the peanut butter cup cheesecake, and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Both were excellent, but the white chocolate raspberry was my favorite. I would not eat here again, but may stop for takeout cheesecake occasionally."
Jones B.,"Athens, TN",640,238,415,3.0,3/5/2014,"The food is great but sadly the service was terrible even though it wasn't over crowded. The waiter never brought me my drink and when I finally asked him about it he said he would bring it back but never did.  Finally close to 20 minutes later he brought the drink and on his own accord said he was sorry and was going to send a manager over. The manager never came over.  Good food, great atmosphere, bad service....but for that cheesecake I'll be going back."
Thao T.,"Knoxville, TN",147,57,159,4.0,4/22/2015,"Huge menu and portions. Even the lunch portions of the salads are massive. The Santa Fe salad is my favorite! I get it with no cheese and if I know I'm not going to finish it, I get tortilla strips on the side so they don't get soggy. The factory nachos with chicken appetizer is massive and really good too. Of course, the cheesecakes are amazing. Pretty expensive overall though. And the seating arrangement is horrible if you're a party of 2. They really squeeze you in there and it's mildly awkward, but the high tops and patio are great. I've been to this location a handful of times and every visit was pleasant."
Mike B.,"Knox, TN",2,19,22,1.0,1/1/2015,By far the worst dining room in Knoxville with cattle like two tops where you are sitting right next to another party. Our waitress even took our orders at the same time like we were together. Also expect lots of staring and creepy behavior with the huge mirrors that line the table wall for the 2-tops. No kidding a woman waved and smiled in the mirror while I was eating. The food is decent but upset my stomach and my girlfriends as well. The food is way overpriced for the qualify and atmosphere.  The cheesecake is amazing and should be for 7-8 dollars a slice. Can't imaging this place staying in business long term.
Kelly M.,"Knoxville, TN",1,4,,2.0,1/4/2016,"Take away another star for the disappointment factor. If you are spending over $80 for 2 people (and you will) you'd expect at least a 4 star experience, but it's just disappointing.  The service is only adequate. Our server was nice, but she didn't seem to be as well trained on first class service as I'd hoped. She didn't ask about appetizers, she didn't ask if I wanted another cocktail, she seemed in a rush and she almost didn't take my dessert order. Also the service was slower than I would expect. Again, at most restaurants that wouldn't be an issue, but for the money you'll pay, it's not what you'd expect. The atmosphere wasn't very welcoming. All of the staff appeared defeated & joyless, managers, servers and hosts included. The water glasses are made of plastic and it's impossible to sit at the tables we were at without sharing your conversation with the parties on either side of you. The menu is massive and every other page is a full-page ad (I've never seen this before) and they were out of most of the cheescakes we wanted to try. The food was the biggest disappointment. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the money. The portions are very large, but what's the point if it takes like it came out of a freezer bag? We had the Bang-bang shrimp and the Jambalaya pasta, and both tasted pre-prepared.  Having been in the service industry and having worked in restaurants before, I can attribute the failings of this place to 1 thing. Poor management. A restaurant (or any business) is only as good as the people running it. Train your staff well, enforce standards and focus on the customer experience. Unfortunately, and this is all too common, this will probably won't happen, as people are still standing in line to get in. Oh well. I won't wait in line there again."
David S.,"Knoxville, TN",0,11,15,3.0,10/3/2016,Im not much of a chain person but the food and service are always good if you dont have a two hour wait but those two hours can easily be spent looking over the 500 item menu. Priced a little high for the quality of the food.  Best damn calamari ever and served with a duet of sauces (marinara of course and a zesty remoulade).  Love me some of that Pumpkin Cheesecake.  No military discount sad to say.
J L.,"Clarksville, TN",0,36,29,1.0,2/11/2017,"Hostess said 20 minute wait, asked about 30 mins later how much longer, she replied four ahead of us, waited 40 mins more and watched 7 people go in front of us. We finally got called but they sit 2 people in between other parties at the long table. I'm really uncomfortable being that close to others and I wasn't able to hear my daughter speak and if she did then the ones next to us were awkwardly listening so I asked if we could get one of the booths, they said yes and we will be placed at the bottom of the list and need to wait again and the wait was over an hour. I said huh? No thank you."
Ernie And Dora H.,"Kannapolis, NC",14,167,596,4.0,3/16/2015,"Recently, my family visited the Cheesecake Factory in Knoxville, TN, on a Saturday night, but decided not to wait two hours. This weekend, we stopped in again, earlier this time. The 2-hour wait ended up only being one hour. Although jammed, service was attentive, yet we had plenty of time to savor our meal. The Fried Calamari appetizer was crispy and chewy, just the way we like it. Perfectly spiced, and paired well with the garlic dip. Since we planned to order cheesecake, we shared the Four Cheese Pasta: penne pasta, mozzarella, ricotta, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses, marinara sauce and fresh basil, and opted for the fried chicken add-on. The four cheeses blended well together, but the highlight was the chicken, tender and moist, thin strips with just the right amount of breading. The ample serving size was plenty for sharing. I chose Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake and Dora ordered Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake. This is a cheesecake factory, so you know the cheesecake was great. Dora here. Great? Oh my stars! Rich and decadent, melt-in-my-mouth heaven!  I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5.  ~Ernie Hiers, Food blogger at Fiction Faith & Foodies"
Jared M.,"Knoxville, TN",172,108,2066,1.0,7/27/2013,"3 hour wait. Don't do it unless you like to stand around outside in the parking lot. Rude hostess, rude waiter, rude manager. Will not come again. Ever. As we came back in after 2 hours of waiting to ask for an update I was actually laughed at. I mean I chuckled with her too, especially after being told that 2 hours and 45 minutes was a fairly reasonable wait. I then burst into laughter after that was followed by ""sir there is a delay because people are ordering cheesecake and sitting around"".  Is that not what people should do at The Cheesecake Factory? I went with a group of 8, and the only thing that was complemented was the dessert. Just order the dessert through their take-out or walk-in service and skip a wonderful experience that I wish I had never endured."
Jeffery M.,"Knoxville, TN",2,10,,2.0,9/7/2015,"The food was good but overpriced, and I can't begin to overstate how overpriced the drinks are. Do not make the mistake of ordering a mixed drink without asking the price of everything very carefully. Nine dollar (small) margaritas seem pretty ridonculous to me. Smooth move not listing your drink prices, guys. You got another sucker who was distracted by conversation and the overwhelming menu. Also, nice job upcharging me 4 bucks for a salad you implied came with the meal.  The menu has way too many options. I would guess there are more than 100 options when it comes to food. No kidding. People don't want to deliberate that much about food. Having just one third of those options would still be a huge selection.  It was my first time eating there, but I won't go back, since I got slightly above-average lunch and drinks, for the price of a fairly high-end dinner. I'm baffled that there are so many 5 star reviews of this restaurant. Prime example of an overrated chain. There are reviews that fit my experience but then there are many endlessly praising and if price is mentioned it's in the context of ""totally worth it for the experience"". No, no it is not."
Ian G.,"Knoxville, TN",7,138,1,2.0,9/13/2015,"The food at the cheesecake factory used to be better but it's still good. Decent portions, big prices. The table we got was terrible. If you're looking for a little privacy be careful alot of tables offer none. I ordered some fish tacos with black beans and rice. It was ok, lacked fish, tiny amount of guacamole and the black beans were definitely canned and the rice overcooked dry and tasteless. Food also took a very long time to be served.  The wait was too long to be sitting in our neighbors laps and not feeling comfortable talking. My wife had a salmon salad (small portion of salmon) with all those green healthy things like kale. She seemed not very pleased with her food sand complained about the small portion of salmon more than once.  I think the best thing was the bread basket and piece of cheesecake we took to go, just couldn't sit in the public school cafeteria atmosphere any longer to eat our desert. BTW the piece of chocolate, chocolate chip coconut cheesecake (like a German chocolate cake cheese cake) was very good. I've been eating at the cheesecake factory once or twice a year for many years in different cities..... all I can say is the quality, quantity, freshness and flavors of the food have dramatically declined... but the prices continue to rise too much if you ask me....pretty restaurant that still gets a big crowd although I would expect that to change if the food doesn't improve to something close to what it used to be"
Jennie B.,"Knoxville, TN",165,227,331,2.0,6/24/2015,"Such a disappointment! My how the Cheesecake Factory has changed (and not for the better) over the years. 1. Walked in and wanted to sit out on the patio. Greeted by the hostess who told us they just shut the patio down because there is a storm coming.  This is East TN where weather men are wrong 99% of the time.  We asked again if we could sit outside. She approved it with her manager and we were the only table outside.  It was a very warm, but totally overcast day, so not too hot for outside. I cannot believe no one else was out there, but hey, it was our own private (huge) patio! 2. Waitress Danielle was very nice. Diligent. Attentive.  She did everything she could to make us happy.  3. We ordered 2 drinks- blueberry mojito (excellent) and a Bombay Sapphire on the rocks with blue cheese stuffed olives and olive juice on the side (so I could make my own dirty martini--most people make it too dirty and I hate sending things back if I can avoid it). 4. The first 'martini' came out and tasted like a jalapeno flavored vodka or liquor that was completely unlike any gin I'd ever had. My boyfriend tasted it and confirmed---it was NOT gin after all.  We aren't connoisseurs, but we know when gin is good, or bad, or non existent.  We sent it back. 5. The 2nd 'martini' arrived and tasted exactly the same.  Slightly frustrated at this point but still willing to give it a shot, we asked for Tanqueray.  I figured the Sapphire had either 1. Been contaminated or 2. Gone bad. We asked our server to taste the drink, she couldn't. We asked her to please have the manager taste it. 6. A few mins later the manager arrives with our new (and improved!) Tanqueray martini. We asked him if he tasted the other and he said 'Yes. It tasted fine. Just like gin.'  Now this is where I get REALLY frustrated.  The manager of this place tasted our drink and said it tasted like gin.  So either he 1. Had NO idea what he was talking about or 2. Has NO taste buds!  THAT WAS NOT GIN. I REPEAT. THAT WAS NOT GIN.  7. We chatted with the manager for a minute or two about what could have possibly happened.  The top to the other liquor could have been accidentally swapped and hence taken on the flavor of jalapeno (tequila he said).  OK whatever. Our new martini was just fine and delicious. 8. We ordered the spicy Jamaican jerk chicken with rice, beans and plantains.  We really ordered this because the plantains sounded great and we were in the mood for them!  The dish arrived without plantains. No acknowledgment on behalf of the Cheesecake Factory, so upon Danielle asking what else we need, I immediately mentioned--'We just need the plantains.' She turns around and looks at the food runner who says-'Oh, we're out of them.' WTF!!!!!! Now we are angry.  That's the reason I ordered the dish!  Of course there's nothing they or we can do but order a vegetable to sub, so we reluctantly accepted asparagus.   9. In all fairness--so you don't think I'm just trying to bash this place--the dish was delicious.  The sauce had just the right amount of spice.  The chicken was moist and tender.  They did a really good job with this, lack of plantains aside. 10. We ordered cheesecake to go.  Got home and went to take a couple bites and the slice was warm.  Like, melted almost. The cheesecake and cream cheese topping was falling over, like a sad little leaning tower of Pisa.  We had to stick it into the freezer for 45 mins to harden it in order to enjoy it. OK I remember the Cheesecake Factory growing up and this is not the same place.  Something has happened, or NOT happened.  But we won't be returning in the near future unless we hear that a miracle has taken place. BTW- it never rained. In fact the sky cleared and was almost blue by the time we finished dinner!"
Lekia R.,"Greer, SC",13,20,59,5.0,12/28/2015,I love cheesecake so in my mind they can't go wrong. I ordered the banana cream cheesecake.  It was very good and rich in taste. I will definitely go back so that I can try the other flavors of cheesecake. We only went for dessert. The wait staff was good.
