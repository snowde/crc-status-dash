Bill R.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,9,2,5.0,8/13/2016,"So good. Service was excellent. Had chicken nachos for app, very good. We ordered shepherds pie, chicken enchiladas, and fish/chips. Every order was perfect and delicious. I will definitely return. Menu is awesome and our selections were varied but awesome. Had strawberry cheesecake and strawberry shortcake for dessert. Both were delicious. Order portions were huge. Can't say enough good things."
Andre' M.,"Johns Creek, GA",69,395,97,2.0,7/12/2014,I'm not sure what is so great about this place.  The food was just ok to my wife and I and it was way overpriced. Maybe it's the large menu. That is kind of nice.
Frieda P.,"Knoxville, TN",78,4,,2.0,5/16/2016,Really bad service for such an expensive place. Seating is horrible. Food is not worth the cost.
Josh P.,"Kingsport, TN",0,18,21,5.0,5/25/2014,The Cheesecake Factory was absolutely amazing!  I visited on a Sunday around 2:30 P.M. after the church crowed cleared out and immediately got a seat! It is very surprising because usually the wait seems to be very long anyways!  I have to say that the staff was very accommodating and the food was great! Little pricey to get the whole experience but was worth every penny! Will be going back soon!
Chad B.,"Knoxville, TN",34,4,1,1.0,6/15/2016,Food was good as always. Restaurant full but no wait. Would not seat us outside said 1.5 hour wait. You guys are doing a great job. Set us beside the window. At least we could see all the empty tables outside.
R T.,"Knoxville, TN",50,82,256,3.0,9/3/2015,"We had Chicken Marsala (ok, but a bit bland) & Chicken Salad sandwich with a small green salad. Food was average, not bad , but nothing to brag about. The cheesecake with strawberries & whipped cream was disappointing. For $7.95 a slice I would have hoped for real whipped cream, not huge swirling mountains of Cool Whip. I've had much better cheesecake. Our bill was over $50, way too much for average food at best. Too bad the food isn't up to par with the decor of the restaurant. It's very pretty inside, reminds me of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.  A note about seating: there are TINY 2-top tables virtually on top of each other. Make sure to request a booth unless you want every word of your conversation broadcast to people sitting on either side."
Ashley F.,"Knoxville, TN",12,25,4,5.0,3/14/2016,"I ate at The Cheesecake Factory for the first time recently. I love the ambiance of the restaurant, and the table seating was comfortable. Our waiter was very attentive and promptly refilled our drinks. The menu was huge with something for everyone. The pricing was a bit high, but the portion size is enormous and leftovers are plentiful to take home. The children's menu is great and offers good food like salmon and grilled chicken. The cheesecake was great and one size is large enough to share!"
Susan T.,"Knoxville, TN",3,24,,4.0,12/21/2014,"The food is pretty well done here, and they certainly do have a large menu. I like the fact that they offer a pretty wide variety of lower-calorie items, although I wonder how accurate the calorie count really is in these ""Skinnilicious"" offerings. The non-low-cal entrees are large and, I'm sure, absolutely loaded with extra butter...because they're very good. Cheesecake varieties for dessert are almost too thick; I can't imagine ever eating a piece totally by myself after a dinner here.  If you're planning on having a cocktail or a glass of wine with your dinner, bring some extra cash because they're amazingly expensive. $8.50 for a glass of house wine? Come on.... Service is very friendly, not overly so, but professional. Good place to take your folks or family for dinner. Good food, not terribly inspired, but consistent and tasty."
Harold B.,"Glen Burnie, MD",0,141,15,4.0,9/23/2016,"I have had lunch here few times. It is your typical Cheesecake Factory, large menu and large portions. Like their SkinnyLicious  menu, especially the salads. Food and service have been ok. I don't know if they have recently went up on the prices but they seem higher than I remember from other locations."
Cammie B.,"Knoxville, TN",0,8,,3.0,12/9/2015,"First visit to this chain. We had a nice time. I ate 2 of the small lower calorie plates and they were pretty good-pot stickers and lettuce wrap tacos Asian style. Both dishes I had were wonderful! The other members of our group got a BLT, Cajun pasta, and Deviance pasta, all said their dishes were average and bland. The server was nice and attentive. Dessert consisted of Kahlua and  turtle cheesecake both awesome!"
Rachel R.,"Knoxville, TN",63,16,30,4.0,3/12/2016,Great food but a bit overpriced. Just go there for the cheesecake which is so rich and AMAZING!
Dylan C.,"Charleston, SC",4,13,,5.0,3/17/2016,"This is a great place to eat! I have been several times, and it's awesome! Menu is very large with great cheesecake selection. Food is always delicious. 100% recommend coming here!"
Gordon C.,"Morristown, TN",0,3,,1.0,7/3/2016,Absolutely terrible. Bad food and bad service. Very disappointed with both at this location. Host was rude and very un-accommodating. Waiter was only seen one time during the meal.
Vanessa W.,"Knoxville, TN",3,16,3,4.0,8/23/2014,"This was my first time eating at TCF. It was really good. Not great, but good. The service made up for the overpriced ""what I consider to be ordinary"" fare. Our waitress was great, as well as patient, and that IS rare. I was taken as a treat so I can't complain, but had I paid this review might have been modified slightly. Ultimately, I recommend eating here at least once , and try the Chicken Madeira. I also recommend not going during peak hours. Arriving at 5 for dinner is ideal if you want a table in a timely manner."
Adam C.,"Madisonville, TN",39,13,4,4.0,2/20/2016,I got the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it did not disappoint.. It was delicious and a ton of food! The only problem I had was the wait. Overall a great restaurant!
Edith R.,"Knoxville, TN",17,3,1,1.0,2/7/2014,"They gave me raw chicken, TWICE. When I reported it the first time, I was made to feel like I was the person in the wrong. I was given a gift card that I later embarrassingly found out had a zero balance. The second time was also very unpleasant, the manager on duty was less than apologetic. I know his company has a strong positive culture, I'm sorry the Knoxville location doesn't follow suit. I hope no one else has this same experience."
AMouthofthe S.,"Knoxville, TN",0,9,2,2.0,12/9/2015,"I do not relish giving a bad review. Usually C.F. is great but visited last Sunday evening. I was told they take reservations during the week not the weekend (which is when people want a reservation). We waited a long time for a table, then waited a long time for a server to show up. The worst part was the loud, ear-piercing music. When our waiter finally came, we had to repeat our order several times before he could even hear us. We asked if they could turn the music down, but they didn't. Screaming over the music made table conversation not worth the trouble. I've always heard that people who worked in a ""factory"" suffered hearing loss - now I understand why!"
Joe P.,"Bellingham, WA",4,67,2,2.0,2/14/2015,"Not good for a meal...perhaps ok for dessert and coffee but I'll never do dinner there again. I ordered a simple Margrettia Pizza and it lacked enough sauce, tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese. Mine arrived cold with a burnt crust and looking like it had been prepared hours before. I've honestly had better frozen pizza. I brought it up to the manager and he did remove the cost of the pizza from our bill. The place was packed so our waiter was tried...he made a point to tell us so...so our service was not to good either. I couldn't get out of the place quick enough!"
Jennifer T.,"Irvine, CA",30,286,2,5.0,3/13/2014,"I love Cheesecake Factory!! Regular menu, great ambience.  Service is always standard. I ate tons of cheesecakes during this visit!! Hahaha...."
Jane K.,"Fort Worth, TX",18,36,7,4.0,10/26/2013,"Great service and good food.  We had the Thai lettuce wraps. They were very tasty and pretty. Also, I tried the tiramisu cheesecake. It was pretty good. My husband adored his banana pudding cheesecake.  As for my Ultimate Margarita, I have to say it was almost perfect."
