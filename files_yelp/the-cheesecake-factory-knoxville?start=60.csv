Chelsea G.,"Powell, TN",0,23,7,5.0,1/12/2015,"Sooooo delicious! Large portions - I usually get 2 more meals out of the leftovers! The whole grain bread is to die for! And, of course, the cheesecake is unbelievable!"
Marisa M.,"Knoxville, TN",15,139,133,4.0,9/10/2013,"Tonight was a good night! 45 minute wait meant we could do a little shopping first.  Then we went back and we were next to be seated (we missed when they called our name). Server was friendly and efficient. Our food arrived faster than thought it would.  We had the fish tacos, thai lettuce wraps, and the kids macaroni. Everything was delicious.  No complaints this time around. We had plenty of leftovers to bring home. Would have been a reasonably priced meal had we not gotten two pieces of cheesecake to go!"
Jessica C.,"Knoxville, TN",6,13,2,2.0,8/2/2014,"This place does not take reservations, and they always have a wait, and when you are on a lunch break or on a time schedule of any kind it is not feasible to sit and wait forever and ever for a table. So I guess this restaurant doesn't want my business. Too bad, they actually have good service and decent food once you actually get to sit down. I work nearby and would come by for lunch often if I could call first to make sure I won't spend most of my break waiting in line. Oh well, I'll just take my money elsewhere since they don't want it. :)"
MIke A.,"Lakewood, CA",4,17,,1.0,2/20/2016,Never again. Seems the restaurant decor is priority over service and food quality. The wait to get lettuce wraps is crazy. Zero grade
Brandon H.,"Marion, VA",20,5,16,4.0,1/17/2014,Busy Friday night (as usual) wait time was 90 mins. At 8pm. Not a lot of standing room inside too cold outside. Food was as expected. Waitress could have been less talkative. Checking in on us every two minutes was a little much! But we had a good time with friends.
Chip B.,"Moore, SC",19,2,,2.0,1/9/2015,Plan to get here an hour before you're ready to eat.  Getting a table in less than 30 min is impossible.
Nikki K.,"Knoxville, TN",0,9,7,2.0,9/19/2015,"This was my second time eating here, both times I've eaten here I can't help but notice the expansive menu. When I say they have a little bit of everything, I mean EVERYTHING. I chose the chicken and shrimp jumbalaya. There was plenty of chicken and shrimp and there was a perfect amount of spice. For dessert, I chose the strawberry cheesecake. I thought it was a bit underwhelming. The cheesecake tasted like any decent cheesecake and I was expecting fresh strawberries but that wasn't the case. So lets talk about price...was the food good? Yes. Was my pasta worth the almost $18? No. Was my cheesecake worth nearly $8 a slice? No. It's worth going once but I won't be running back anytime soon. I just feel like I can get a similar dish for a portion of the price elsewhere. Also, both times I've been here we have been seated less than 24 inches from the people next to us. You literally couldn't fit two rulers between my partners butt and the patron next to her. It's very awkward and uncomfortable. Just for that reason alone I had to knock it down a star."
Chuck C.,"Knoxville, TN",11,364,,5.0,12/23/2014,"I thought it was good.  Huge portions and a tad high until you see how much food.  I can usually get two meals on them.  The cheesecake is delicious.  The only problem I have is the wait.  But I guess that means it is good.  I like better calling it in and picking it up to avoid that.  I have discovered the huge and delicious salads.  I keep trying them all.  Very, very good!"
Anne M.,"Afton, TN",0,4,,3.0,7/9/2015,"There was no wait when I got there. I made the staff aware of an allergy and they were quite accommodating, but it took a long time for a server to take our drink order and then to come back with drinks and to take the food order. The food took forever to get to the table. I ordered a steak cooked medium, then was first given a well done steak. I sent it back and they prepared a new one, which was medium well bordering well. The manager offered to have another made, but I ate the second because I didn't feel like waiting another half hour for another new steak. The manager offered me a complimentary piece of cheesecake, but my allergy prevented that. I was offered another dessert I could have at no charge for the wait, and improperly cooked second steak. The staff was good, otherwise I would have left 1 star."
Channa P.,"Knoxville, TN",325,474,166,3.0,1/28/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is an interesting place. The wait is usually 2 hours long, the menu is literally a book of food, the portion sizes are insanely large, and the cheesecake seems to take a backsit to everything else. I tend to eat at the bar for brunch to avoid the wait, and I am a huge fan of the monte cristo sandwich. It's the right balance of sweet and savory. Most of the food is good, but not great, and I definitely think this is place is more about experience. If you are looking to go to a nice, initimate dinner with a few friends, avoid this place. If you're looking for a fun time in a busy place with TONS of options this is the right choice. Just be prepared to wait and always be willing to sit at the bar. It has literally saved an hour of my time."
Maureen W.,"Loudon, TN",0,3,,3.0,10/9/2014,"Shrimp platter was disappointing.  All breading a sliver of shrimp, no salt on fries, no dressing at all on coleslaw but the tartar sauce was outstanding!  Shepherd's pie was outstanding! As was the pumpkin cheesecake and the Godiva cheesecake!"
Casey H.,"Knoxville, TN",0,4,,1.0,7/14/2013,"Sitting here waiting on hour 3 of a 2.5 hour estimated wait.  I would never have come here of my own volition, but my wife has a work party here.  It is obvious their turnover rate and thus management is to blame.  I just watched a 4 top go unbussed for 8 mins... I can only imagine What other time wasting inefficency is going on behind the scenes.  The organizer of this event tried to do reservations and the manager rudely told her they dont take reserves and that everyone asks that.  Pretty obviously they should take reservations, at least for the near future. 3:05 after our first unlucky person put in our name- the hostess blames the party sitting at our table for the overdue wait.  They evidently are just sitting around enjoying themselves.  I relay this to our party along with a Blues Brothers joke about offering to buy these people's children to get them moving ( ).  The joke falls flat as no one gets the reference.  Boy I love mixed company. 3:10 The loungers leave.  The table is immediately bussed as compared to the earlier tables but.... 3:18- Though the table is bussed and set, we are still waiting to be seated.  This place has a half dozen hostesses on staff for whatever reason, and 4 computers where they are plugging in parties to tables first through their computer program and color coding available tables.  This takes quite some time and manpower evidently as it takes 11 minutes from our table being ready to seat us.  Two couples in our party have left. 3:21 We are finally seated.  The manager spontaneously brings out a pair of appetizers for us on the house due to our wait. 3:29 Our waitress finally shows up to get our drink orders.  Yes, 8 minutes after seating.  The lady beside me orders a beer. 3:36 Our waitress brings our drinks, no beer for my lady friend beside me.  Waitress states they are waiting to change the keg.  We finally order. 3:45 Still no beer, changing the keg. 3:48 Manager comes and states they have no more Blue Moon, he will take care of whatever else she wants. 3:54 Our food arrives and lady beside me gets her second choice on the beer front. 4:15 We are done eating.  Ask for check. 4:35 A scant 20 minutes later we get our check.  The holdup is blamed on the bakery because some other people in the work party ordered cheesecake and she thought it would be best to wait to divide checks after they got their cheesecake orders in since we have divided checks. Now I went into this place knowing there would be a wait as it is a new restaurant.  However a near 5 hour turnaround time on getting fed pretty much takes up your entire Sunday afternoon.  Pretty much uncalled for.  We had to pay a babysitter to go to this event, and ended up paying her for overtime on this one.  A comped appetizer or two does not make up for the fact that this is entirely a fubar  operation.  We were there at brunch time and left at dinner time.  Holy lord!  The kitchen seemed to be running relatively smoothly but everything else was just a clusterF of inefficiency.  If it hadnt taken so long to get our check I would have had the 18% gratuity removed in favor of 10%.  Just a poor experience all around. And yes I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory before in other cities.  I took into account a long wait but they sure did exceed my expectations on that one!"
Christine S.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",82,37,16,5.0,4/1/2014,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory!  They have an amazing selection of healthy, low calorie, options."
Joanne L.,"Knoxville, TN",1,13,,2.0,10/30/2013,"Way overpriced. They give you plenty of food but the quality is only so-so. At our table we had fish tacos, fried catfish, and salmon. The fish tacos were just mediocre, the fried catfish was not very good, but the salmon was excellent."
Nicole T.,"Knoxville, TN",3,19,9,3.0,1/9/2014,Ordered a steak and cheese sandwich and it came out very dry. Asked if they could add more cheese and they poured a cheese on it that would remind you of Alfredo sauce. Not a great first impression for this new location. Nashville and Atlanta have always exceeded my expectations.
Zabuku K.,"Knoxville, TN",0,21,,3.0,10/9/2014,"some of the best cheesecake i ever had. I'm a big fan of cheesecake, it is my favorite desert and i would pick it over any deserts. Cheesecake factory should only make cheesecake. The food is okay its not the greatest but the prices are over the top. its like a 2.5 star meal for the price of a 4 star meal. the place looks great, one of the nicest chain restaurant i been to. Even the cheesecake are a little pricey, around $8 for a slice of cheesecake. i do recommending trying the cheesecake (red velvet) you are never had a cheesecake there and really enjoy eating cheesecake. If you do want to eat something there i recommend either the kobe burger( with the sauce on the side) or their pizza but i wouldn't choice to eat their."
Alan S.,"Knoxville, TN",0,62,,3.0,2/14/2014,"Good food.Good service.Design of waiting area awful! Waiting line with little to no room to sit.Mob mentality around hostess area .Getting out after our meal was a challenge, the waiting to be seated crowd was blocking the exit.  Prices are high compared to other Knoxville equivalents."
Joi D.,"Knoxville, TN",0,30,3,4.0,6/29/2013,I love this place and am happy to see one in Knoxville finally.  The buzz for this place will not die down though which will cause for long wait times to be seated.  I ordered 2 meals to go one opening day.  Was pleasantly surprised at the wait for my order to be 30min on such a busy day.  Curbside to go is definitely the way to go if you want dinner during peak times here.  You can also pick up inside.  The are proud of their food (pricey).  Since the portion sizes are quite large I won't order two meals again for my daughter and I.  One definitely is enough and then that allows for the budget to include more cheesecake!  It would have been nice if they had chosen another location besides at the mall.  A standalone restaurant I think would have allowed for easier access and more seating to accommodate their popularity.
