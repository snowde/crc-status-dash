Justin S.,"Lake Ronkonkoma, NY",72,47,41,4.0,9/29/2017,"I've been to this Cheesecake Factory location a number of times over the years and have always been satisfied.  Our waitress Kelly was great - friendly, attentive, and welcoming.  This is a great place to dine. Decor is astounding and everything is very clean.  I ordered the vegan Cobb Salad. The salad was a very large portion for only 12 bucks but it tasted decent. I suppose my expectations were a little higher.  Overall a very nice experience and I will definitely return."
Daniel T.,"Lake Grove, NY",4,22,20,1.0,1/7/2018,"Very unhappy with the service we received at brunch this morning, Sunday January 7th. We arrived at 10:20am and the place empty.  We were a party of ten and it was for my daughter's sweet sixteen brunch.  It took 20 minutes for us to be seated when the place was empty.  Then we ordered the food and it was over an hour before the food arrived.  Then the food order was wrong for one of the 2 kids' meals and instead of leaving the one the was correct.  (The server brought both back to the kitchen - which didn't make sense to us).  Then when they brought the kids' meals, one was correct and one was an adult meal instead.  The waiter didn't apologize for it and the kids were waiting longer than the adults for their meal.  Then when the bill came they proceeded to charge the adult meal when it wasn't even the one we ordered.  The sides of fruit were missing from the meal and when we asked the waiter, he didn't even know the menu fully well and didn't know the fruit was supposed to come with it.  This waiter was clearly not trained or brand new.  He also didn't bring sugar for the coffee when we requested it.  Had to request it twice before it arrived so our coffee was already cold.  Also my son ordered the chicken and waffles which arrived cold one hour later of waiting for it.  My wife's waffles which was supposed come with chantilly cream didn't come on the plate so I had to ask for it.  The waters we requested also didn't come, we had to ask for it twice.  My oldest daughter asked for a refill of her tea and the waiter refilled it with coffee.  I can forgive one or two mistakes but this was ridiculously too many mistakes and errors both in service and kitchen.    Went there to enjoy a good meal with family and highly disappointed with the long wait and bad service when the place was empty since we arrived early for brunch.  Unfortunately, I will not be back.  I wanted you to know what a horrible experience we've had.  We've lived in Lake Grove, NY for 19 years and we typically go to Cheesecake at least twice a year but I will now go elsewhere.  Wanted you to know this because it is unacceptable if you are going out to eat especially for a special occasion and the service is bad.  I believe you need to train your waiters better and notice the time frame it takes for the food to arrive.  No one even came, not even the manager to apologize for the delay of the food; no one checked up on how we were doing or if we needed anything else.  This is unacceptable service!!!! We spent $170 but that will be the last time.   One more thing, my wife needed to use the bathroom which was disgusting.  Toilets weren't flushed and there was tissue all over the seat and floor in two of the four stalls - you need to have people check the bathroom now and then.  I waited until I got home to use the bathroom.  Sorry cheesecake but I expected much better.  Management needs to know. It appears that the Cheesecake standards have taken a nose dive.  I used to be excited to go to Cheesecake.  Now I avoid it.  Service is slow,  bathroom is disgusting and management is not making the rounds to ensure customers are happy."
Ashleigh P.,"Coram, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/20/2017,"Horrible service, bad food, confusing decor. I went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner with my girlfriend because we received a gift card as an early Christmas present. From the outside of the building the place looks huge and could easily be two stories. However when you go inside you notice that there is only one floor with obscenely high ceilings. They could probably have used a second floor because the tables are so close together that it is even difficult for a child to get in between them.  The decor is so odd you can't tell what kind of experience you're going to get. Am I in an Egyptian tomb, looking at painted ceilings at the Sistine Chapel, or have I gone to Mordor to dine with the Eye of Sauron that is staring at me as I eat? The lights are so dim, I assume so you can't see the tacky wicker chairs and fake marble tables.  Once we sat down the waitress came right over to greet us and take our drink order. Our drinks came out at record speed which was great but that's as far as the greatness went. It is important to note that at the start of our Cheesecake Factory experience the table next to us, four people, had just started enjoying their appetizer. After getting our drinks we did not see our waitress for at least 20 minutes. When she finally came back over we put in our appetizer order and our dinner order because we were not sure when we would see her again.  Our appetizer, loaded baked potato tots, came out within a reasonable amount of time, about 15 minutes after we ordered, but this was the last time we saw our waitress for the night. The loaded baked potato tots were delicious. By this time we were there for so long that the table next to us had already ordered their dessert.  Our entree didn't come out for another 45 minutes and the table of four was long gone. I ordered the steak Diane, medium well, and shrimp scampi combo and my girlfriend ordered the fillet mignon, medium. The steak Diane was delicious and I would have it again. On the other hand, the shrimp scampi was the worst I had ever had. The fillet mignon was rare and burned on the outside. Most of the fillet was fatty and inedible. Both dishes came with mashed potatoes that were so dry and pasty that you could use it as cement. Our waitress never came over to see how our meals were and we had to go up to the bar to ask for steak sauce. Once we were 3/4ths of the way finished with our meals a different waitress came over to ask if we needed anything.  After we were done with our meals we were going to do a little shopping in the mall. We did not get very far before we were both running out of the mall because we both had to use the bathroom. This horrible meal had us both holding our tummies and having cold sweats hoping that we would make it home in time. Thankfully we did."
Elle F.,"New York, NY",133,87,34,2.0,10/29/2017,"Not sure what happened here; either the management has changed or maybe the corporation standards for the restaurants have changed.  Regardless, this specific Cheesecake Factory has declined sharply over the last year. The menu and food used to be rich and plentiful, and coming here was a real treat for that reason alone. The menu options and portions have decreased by a quite noticeable measure. The menu has condensed over the years, but cutting corners on the portion sizes and ingredients seems to be more recently within the last year.  For example, my husband was a huge fan of the overflowing appetizer plate of Buffalo Blasts that he'd get almost weekly.  They once had very hearty, crispy breading, with a very chicken-finger-like consistency.  Though they were fried, they weren't greasy or soggy.  They have since drastically cut the portion size and changed the recipe to this very thin coating of breading that just feels like you're eating a grease-bomb.  They're actually repulsive now.  In fact, we even googled the before and after changes of this particular menu item.  Needless to say we're not the only ones who have noticed this, as we found multiple pictures and complaints. The entrees, salads and salad protein options are about half the size that they used to be, without ANY exaggeration.  More importantly, the service has taken a huge turn for the worse.  Everyone is always friendly but the attentiveness, presenting a correct order, and timeliness is actually painful. Even the wait for our first order of drinks is completely outrageous. I could almost sympathize if all the above said experiences were over the busy weekends with mall-shoppers flooding the restaurant, but my husband and I only come here during the week. Unfortunately, the days of the Cheesecake Factory being a real treat and exciting place to come for celebratory events, has come to an end; it's just another chain restaurant now.  Go spend your money at a smaller restaurant where your business and patronage is truly appreciated."
Renee J T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",212,674,2615,1.0,10/11/2017,Lake grove cheesecake how could you let me down like this?  Al wanted to come for dinner I owed her She picked Cheesecake Factory I mean seriously there is a choice of everything from nachos to burgers to salads to dinner entrees like chicken and bisquits so first we wait I understand your crowded  finally we are brought to a table its on of these tables in a long line of table one side other is a bench the other chairs so there is only 1 chair  Um we are 4 people  standing there..very awkward I spot two open booths I ask can we sit there NO says the waitress they are already promised  what cheesecake just let us sit instead of making us stand there so awkward finally they bring over a chair our bread basket thanks. 1 piece for 4 people  super slow service waitress did not understand I did not want the vinaigrette dressing but the blue cheese no asking if food was ok when it finally showed and of course the flavor of cheesecake I asked for they were out of  too crowded too noisy they don't really care about you heard servers mumbling something not friendly not worth coming back
Heidi L.,"Nesconset, NY",0,2,,2.0,1/2/2018,Heads up- Lake Grove is not up to Cheesecake standards. It was New Years Eve and extremely busy. Our waitress did the best she could considering they were out of our favorites- calamari app and tuna entree. 3 tiny pieces of goat cheese in the salad made it mostly lettuce. After sitting on ripped seats and freezing in a 50° ladies room our trip was certainly not worth the price tag. Our cheesecake slices to go were awesome so maybe we will just pick up dessert next time.
Amy M.,"Patchogue, NY",331,163,919,4.0,4/28/2017,"I don't know why I don't feel happier about our experience at The Cheesecake Factory because really, we had a good dinner. Other than the hostess that didn't seem all that interested in helping people, and a 10 minute wait that was unnecessary (with so many empty tables)... everything else was great. Our server was excellent. Attentive and friendly, though quick about things (no lingering to chat, no real small talk). He was all about business and that's just fine. We're trying to watch what we eat so we ordered off the ""skinnylicious"" menu. We started with Chicken Pot Stickers and they were really yummy. They had a nice Asian or Thia type flavor that I'm not usually a fan of but I liked it. My husband thought it was excellent. Next, I got the turkey and avocado sandwich. It was terrific. The salad it came with was delicious (I asked for blue cheese dressing instead of the vinegarette it came with). The sandwich itself had great flavor and all in all was the perfect amount. My husband got the garlic and lemon shrimp. He loved it. It came with angel hair pasta and asparagus and the whole thing was in a light creamy sauce. He ate every single bite. Because we didn't have alcohol and decided to have dessert at home, the whole dinner was only $50 so even the price was right. Honestly, every time we go we never have a bad meal. To the contrary, they offer a great selection of food, the restaurant is huge, and the prices are what you expect. I really can't complain about anything. But for me, it's just never my first choice. Today it worked because we had to go to the Apple Store (in the same Mall) for a computer repair right at dinner-time. I think it's the ambiance I don't like. Some of the tables just feel like you're part of an assembly line. It's crowded. Shared bench-on-one-side style tables aren't my favorite. It's too close quarters with people you don't know. It's noisy.  Honestly though, sometimes it's just a matter of personal taste. Me and The Cheesecake Factory, maybe we just don't clique... because otherwise, like I said, it's a fine place to have a meal."
Richard S.,"Smithtown, NY",51,40,65,4.0,12/7/2017,Food is always consistently goodHere have no complaints waitstaff is fairly decent the drinks are always good that's the one plus of the cheesecake factory the corn tamale appetizer is one of my favorite
Dorothy M.,"Port Jefferson Station, NY",69,72,54,4.0,12/27/2017,Great place for Lunch or dinner. We all shared and still had a lot of food . I highly recommend the Steak Diane . We had a good experience. Service is a bit slow & you never know how long you'll have to wait for a table.
Renee B.,"Central Islip, NY",174,314,3207,5.0,10/18/2017,"Here's the Scoop: We've come here before but I wasn't a Yelper but now that I am let's get started. Overall appearance is gorgeous! The Egyptian decor and lighting  is so beautiful and calming. As we approached groups of people waiting patiently throughout the lobby and in front of the restaurant didn't deter us. Our 40 minute wait went quickly. The booths are large and comfortable. Many seating options. The menu has something for every taste bud. The wait staff was very attentive, friendly and helpful with making dinner choices. The hot baskets of bread filled with pumpernickel and Italian was warm and the fresh butter complements it so well. Our food came hot with generous portions. The manager Rich came to check on us to make sure we were ok and to apologize for the delay in our order. We ordered dessert, the pumpkin pecan pie cheesecake, Mmmmmmmm out of this  world!!!! Too bad it's seasonal. Our dinner experience was lovely. The service, food, ambiance and company, perfect recipe for a fabulous evening. Check them out but beware weekends are crowded!"
Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",833,809,4136,4.0,12/30/2016,"We rolled up to TCF on a late night after taking a drive to Smith Haven to pick up bikes my husband had purchased for himself and my son. We were starved and a long way from home so we decided to eat here because we knew that everything near us would be closed by the time we got back.  Upon entering, the hostesses were very welcoming and accommodating. They sat us right away and our server was really nice. She came to the table quickly and she regularly checked in on us despite the restaurant being quite packed. I was not feeling to hot and to be quite honest, these types of restaurants scare me because of the calories the food has.  I ordered a skinny drink which tasted horrible so hubby finished it for me. I ordered some Crab Bites which were OK, not great but OK. I also had the Ahi Tartare which was also OK. Hubby had a burger that he liked and it was a great little stop. Not a long wait time, a pleasant server and a decent meal. We paid and headed home, about a 90 minute drive back."
Daniel C.,"Saint James, NY",83,107,531,1.0,7/25/2017,"Probably one of the worst Cheese Cake Factory I ever been too. If you are looking for a quick bite or a nice little date night this place is not the place to come. We came to this location on a Monday night expecting it not to be busy or have a long wait. The hostess who was very nice told us the wait would be about 10 to 15 mins not a problem, We were seated roughly about that time. From the moment we sat down we knew the service was going to be horrible. We came to this cheese cake factory on multiple occasions and had some horrible service only at night and by the bar area for some reason. The couple next to us was annoyed because the waitress was no where to be found and they had a hard time getting there bill and getting the bill paid. Also there was this woman next to us with her daughter and the mom was coughing her lungs out, she wasn't even covering her mouth!!!!! Gross, but any who we decided to stick it out because we waited a few to be seated.  Finally our waitress got to us and we had ample time to look over the menu. She took our drink order and we rushed to tell her our order because we knew she wasn't going to be back for a while.  We ordered the fried cheese and the shrimp tempura to start. The apps took about 15 to 20 minutes to arrive we still wasn't annoyed yet. The fried cheese was delicious but the shrimp tempura was oily and tasted old because they used old oil according to my wife.  For our entree I ordered the bacon bacon burger and my wife ordered the chicken club sandwich. The entree probably came out about another 15 mins after we were done with our appetizer. Annoyed but not overly annoyed yet. Here's where the down fall comes I'm done with my drink and was hoping for a refill because the waitress drops off our entree but she doesn't notice our drinks were low not a problem. But then she disappears again and I can see her chatting with her co-workers behind me . We had to flag her down and ask her for a refill. Now on to the food my bacon cheese burger wasn't good it felt like the bacon and the burger was sitting on the burner and the grease made everything soggy because it was probably sitting so long. My wife chicken club the first part was good the other half was soggy to the point you couldn't eat it. My wife water was low and the waitress comes by fills up the table next to us and doesn't even look our way. By then we were exhausted because we thought dinner would be about 45 minutes to an hour not a hour and half meal. The waitress disappears again my wife gets up and goes searching for her and when she finally finds her she tells her we want the bill and my wife complained to her saying she didn't even come by to refill the water. She comes by with the check and disappears again!!! Comes back 5 minutes later, we finally could check out. My wife complains to the manager and all he does is offer a slice of cheese cake for the road!!!! Which we declined.  Won't be coming back to this establishment again!!! They need to hire more staff workers. It wasn't even a busy night and that's how the service was!!!"
Dana M.,"West Islip, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/10/2017,"Aweful experience. The hostess was clueless and all the staff walk around just looking at dirty tables and walk away while people are waiting to be seated. After 10 minutes of staring at the dirty booth we wanted to sit at we asked the hostess why no one was cleaning it (we went for brunch when it was very slow). Her response was ""I don't know the bus boy might be on break- he should be back soon"". What about all the staff that is just standing around!!!! We spoke to the manager, he didn't care one bit. Our server was so slow and unhelpful. Food was good. Unfortunately the service was terrible."
Alison C.,"Smithtown, NY",87,11,10,1.0,9/30/2017,When we finally got seated we had to wait for a chair. We finally sat down and when we asked for bread they gave us enough for 1 piece each and there was 4 of us. The table next to us had 2 people and had 3 loaves of bread for themselves! We asked for more bread 2 separate times and only got a refill once. They did refill our drinks regularly. We waited for what seemed like forever for our dinner. I had the Skinnylicious chicken pot pie which was delicious. Our Pear and blue cheese flatbread was good. My friends had Buffalo chicken strips that didn't agree with them. My friend had a salad that was good. My other friend ordered a well done burger that was still pink inside by the time we got it. The chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake was good. I have never experienced anything like this ever at this location.
Michael E.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",283,251,492,4.0,10/29/2016,"Friday date night at this Cheesecake Factory. So this is a chain restaurant which means decor is similar, menu the same, and seating policy the same. To be honest I'm not a fan of most chain restaurants but tonight this is what my wife wanted and, well you know ""Happy Wife Happy Life. So we arrive at around 6:30. Now this restaurant is in a shopping mall so the first issue is parking. After a few minutes of cruising around for a spot a get a pretty good one and we're off to dinner.  5-10 minute wait is not too bad and about right when we are called. Small issue, we're seated next to the wait station and after a request to move we are denied so let's just eat. We start with an app of Vietnamese Spring Rolls, which says ""enough to share"". Very true. In fact one or two more spring rolls on the plate would have been enough for the dinner. Move on... I order the Jamaican Jerk Chicken & Shrimp. Came with brown rice and beans. Not bad at all. My wife had Steak Diane & Shrimp. Also good. Then something odd happened. A waiter shows up and tells us he's our real waiter because the waitress who handled most of our meal was just filling in for him. I'm not complaining about the new waiter but just seemed a little odd to get a new waiter in the middle of our meal. Overall it was not a bad experience so we will be back. Maybe next time we can get a better table and the same waiter for the entire meal.  Lastly, prices are pretty reasonable and the quantity is pretty good too."
Sophie C.,"West Sayville, NY",0,1,,2.0,12/26/2017,"The food is very good. I have had a horrible experience though one time. We ordered some food to go after our meal. We ordered Chicken Fingers. They took 45 minutes to prepare, but they only gave us 3 pieces of chicken, and they were very small. The manager then came over and said, ""That is a serving, sorry if you don't like it."" Our waiter was extremely nice to us, apologizing and everything. I did not enjoy my experience at The Cheesecake Factory."
Michelle G.,"Stony Brook, NY",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2018,"We have been to Cheesecake Factory many times, and so far it has been a pleasant experience. However, the last time we visited, we had bad experience. The waitress was great, but manager was unprofessional. We complained because it has been more than 45 minutes from the time of order and our food was not served, waitress apologized many times. We asked for cancelation. Manager came out, not only he did not apologize, he was like giving us the ""nay"" and cold attitude to have our order canceled. We will still go back, but we hope something could be improved with the management."
Ruby D.,"Brooklyn, NY",223,31,272,3.0,9/1/2017,"We had a group of a 6 and the wait was 45 minutes, and maybe another half hour until our food came. We were given bread with butter a few minutes after being seated. I ordered their Crispy Pineapple Chicken and Shrimp ($13.50), which tasted like a standard Chinese dish. I also got their White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake ($7.95), which tasted great for the first few bites - then became a little too sweet and overwhelming. Lastly, the lighting is really dim in certain parts of the dining area for dinner and it was hard to see the menu as well as some of our food."
kallie s.,"Patchogue, NY",592,43,33,3.0,7/27/2017,It is what it is the food is OK but it's like any other chain restaurant. The cheesecake is good though. Menu is giant and the place tends to get  super crowded and the service definitely lacks due to that factor. I hate sitting in a restaurant with an empty glass while I'm eating. The ambience is very nice and the bar is well stocked. It's better to go in there for a game or lunch... I just feel like this place doesn't pack the punch it should when it comes to dinner.
Edward T.,"Holbrook, NY",0,5,,5.0,7/11/2017,***Updated**** Heard from not only the post below but the general manager on the phone the employee is no longer employed. Like I said always loved Cheesecake Factory and that has not changed!!! My family loves this location. Unfortunately with their employee Anthony Trezza publicly calling for the assassination of police officers on Facebook I don't feel comfortable eating in their restaurant anymore.
David K.,"Hauppauge, NY",6,12,,2.0,12/16/2017,"Yet another bad chain restaurant with very bad food and service.If you want to wait twenty minutes before a waiter takes your order than  45 more minutes for your food to arrive , have your waiter never visit your table ,have bread bowl never arrive, have the wrong food arrive , have half the items luke warm or cold than this place is for you. NOT a good dining experience from this poorly run chain restaurant."
Orla M.,"Long Island, NY",539,256,2791,4.0,6/19/2016,"Located outside of Smith Haven mall, it's just like all the other chain Cheesecake Factory locations. The food is consistent and good. If watching your calorie count, the skinnylicious menu surely will work out for you. Just because it has significantly less calories doesn't mean it won't be tasty. I've tried a good amount of items off their skinnylicious menu and have been satisfied with each one. If you're not concerned about calories go ahead and check out their heart attack regular menu. Here's some of things I've tried on my visit to this location: Stuffed Mushrooms 450 cal $6.95 Fontina and Parmesan cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce  Spicy Cashew Chicken 2200 cal $16.95 A very spicy mandarin-style dish with green onions and roasted cashews. Served over rice. Skinnylicious Chicken Salad Sandwich 540 cal $10.95 Housemade with Roasted Almonds, lettuce, tomato and Mayonnaise on a toasted bun. Served with a green salad. Everything was yummy; their Stuffed Mushrooms were delicious and had just the right serving size for two as an appetizer; definitely a repeat order item in my book. I was very surprised how good their Skinnylicious Chicken Salad was it had just enough of all their ingredients combined for just enough taste. The Spicy Cashew Chicken was a large portion (of course it was, this is Cheesecake Factory after all); it was mildly spicy but not too much so. More sweet than spicy, good flavor for the all white meat chicken, but I would have preferred more cashews. Also, no vegetables if you're used to this dish from a traditional Chinese takeout place.   Thumbs up for the staff & customer service as well. We were seated promptly on a busy Sunday afternoon. Drink & appetizer orders were taken quickly, and our entrees arrived at just the right time."
Misia P.,"Sag Harbor, NY",0,7,,1.0,1/2/2018,"I have been to this location number of time, but this time was the worst experience far. Service was slow and didn't pay attention that we were out of drinks or that I never got that promised steak knife. But the reason I'm writing this is the food. I have never had problem with everyone fish I got, except this time. For a starter we ordered tuna tartar which tasted fishy( huge red flag) if you don't have fresh tuna then don't serve it. Second app was grilled cheese with truffle oil and bacon ( truffle nowhere to be found, it didn't smell of taste like one). For the main course my boyfriend had chicken Madeira and that was good , I had hibachi steak . Asked for medium, unfortunately my steak arrived rare, not even medium rare, but rare. It says in menu that it comes with wasabi mashed potatoes which I was exited to try, unfortunately those were just regular potatoes, no wasabi whatsoever. Such a disappointing experience!"
Ginette P.,"New York, NY",412,791,4718,3.0,11/7/2016,"Ideally I try to stay away from places like this because it seems that no matter what time u stop by there is just about always a long wait time my most recent visit was again proof of this.  We stopped by this past weekend wait time was 45 minutes to an hour we decide to wait since we initially had a large group but ended up changing it to 2 didn't help with our wait time.  After getting a table we started with some drinks Both had the Blue Moon 22 oz, perfect it was nice & cold beer was good.  They Start u with some nice warm bread, always good alone or with some butter.  Appetizers we tried the Chicken Samosas good nice taste great cilantro dipping sauce.  Main dishes I went with the Chicken Bellagio nice chicken breast over basil pasta in a cream sauce topped with prosciutto & arugula good pasta, very light cream sauce good piece of chicken nice combo this dish.  My friend had the Mac & cheese burger it's a burger topped with their Mac & cheese balls yum very good had it with a side salad good as well.  This place gets very crowded specially around dinner time & wait times are always long this is something I don't believe will change because of its location it's helpful that the restaurant is very big & has plenty of seating.  Service was good our waitress was very nice, prices are moderate depending on what you get, decent meal overall."
Kaitlin S.,"New York, NY",3,35,21,4.0,7/16/2017,"As far as Cheesecake Factories in NY go, this one is the best one I've been to. Every time I've eaten here, for dine in or take out, the food is delicious and the service is good. Love the bread so much and I love the fried avocado appetizer. They also make a really good Tennessee honey lemonade/iced tea cocktail. And of course all the desserts are amazing! I love the blackout cake."
Drew B.,"Hauppauge, NY",3,8,,3.0,10/27/2017,Great food every time I go here. Tons of things to pick from with their huge menu. Great burgers and of course cheesecake. Only reason I gave it a 3 star is because I think one of the waiters stole my debit card information and used it which I was not too happy about. Dont use your debit card here
Gary U.,"Yaphank, NY",4,16,18,5.0,6/15/2017,Great food great selection. Love the Shepherds Pie!! Try the parm herb crusted chicken dish...
Julia D.,"Azle, TX",126,102,497,1.0,5/9/2017,"Wanted a quick lunch, not too heavy but tasty. Even though the restaurant was empty at 1:10, they seated me in a row of little tables next to other people.  I browsed the menu and was shocked to read that all the ""Healthy"" options have 1200 or more calories. A veggie burger for 1200 calories!  Ridiculous. I ordered the antioxidant salad for ""only"" 850 calories. It arrived, mostly greens, old yellowed broccoli, very, very few almonds. I ate some of it, left and lot and vowed to avoid Cheesecake Factory in the future."
Sara K.,"Florida, NY",140,6,,4.0,10/8/2017,"I would like to start off by saying that the food is amazing...just amazing. I'm not giving the full 5 stars because the past 2 times that I have been to the location, the service has not been up to par. I have had to wait for my meal for over an hour, making it not even worth it to stay. Even though the manager did apologize, I had an empty glass that wasn't refilled the whole time I was sitting there."
Marisa D.,"Long Island, NY",165,278,662,3.0,8/1/2016,Wait... What?! I've never reviewed Cheesecake Factory... something's wrong here or maybe I'm just lax because well... see below. Cheesecake Factory is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants even though... again see below. Cheesecake Factory I love you and I hate you. All in the same breath. I love to love you and love to hate you. Ever since you put the damn calories on the menu I feel like I should just not eat for days after eating at the Cheesecake. Maybe even months?! There are certain things I love to eat at Cheesecake and there are now certain things I probably will never eat again thanks to the damn calorie listing. My poor Chicken Madeira... oh how I miss you but you are oh so bad for me. For whatever reason this is one of my go to places with my best gal pal when we're looking to have a quick & simple bite/cheat meal. Stuffed mushrooms for the win!!! Of course there's something for EVERYONE on their massive menu. I mean EVERYONE! Whatever you crave you'll find it on their menu. Will I be back..... yes. Will I whine more about their calorie listing....... yes. That's the only reason why it's a 3. Because of those damn calories! Geeeeez!!!
Jason C.,"Long Beach, NY",788,263,2523,5.0,1/16/2016,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory ?! Seems like everybody does because this place is always crowded!! On a good note- They seem to seat everyone pretty expeditiously & quickly. When waiting for a table you can either take a glance at the cheesecake display & gawk at the countless cheesecake options they offer or stroll to the far for that ""cold one"". The decor is on the funky side giving off a cool vibe.  The few times I've been here the service seems great! Attentive, efficient & always willing to get you what you need/asked for... The food. Always comes out delicious.  The menu is tremendous w/tons of options of appetizers & entrees.  Too me it's a little too big , too much to choose from but there is something for everyone! The portions are on the bigger side so either save room for dessert or make the cheesecake to-go!!"

Lisa C.,"New York, NY",192,232,84,2.0,8/1/2016,"This was positively the worst Cheesecake factory experience I've ever had. I went this past weekend and I already expected crowds b/c it was National Cheesecake Day and slices of cheesecake were half off. The estimate we got was about a 30 min wait but it ended up being way over an hour. STRIKE ONE. Even after our buzzer was vibrating, we still had to wait another 15 minutes before actually being seated.  We had a lot of time to look over the menu while we were waiting so we were ready to order immediately. Most of us ordered burgers and fries for a quick meal. The food took almost 30 min to be served. STRIKE TWO. The cherry on top of this whole experience was that none of our burgers had fries. The waitress was apologetic and said they were momentarily out. How are you out of french fries???? STRIKE THREE.  We voiced our disappointments to the waitress who was very understanding and by all means was not responsible for all the strikes of the evening. She spoke to the manager and 25% was taken off our bill which was a fair gesture. Overall, do not come here if you're in the area. You'll lose your appetite by the time you get your food."
Rach C.,"Medford, NY",0,1,1,1.0,7/11/2017,Was a regular customer until one of your employees started posting anti-law enforcement rhetoric on public social media.  Good ol Anthony Trezza made it well known that he wants to kill police officers.  You're employees are disgusting.
Kendra H.,"Bellport, NY",101,219,499,3.0,7/9/2016,"Haven't been here in years but tried this place after a few years. Good food and beautiful decor! The decor blew me away, such a lovely spot for a date or a family event. I had the garlic noodles with shrimp. Expected much bigger shrimp with the meal though. The pasta was good, not amazing but good. We so tried their cheesecake also and it was yummy."
Ann P.,"Manorville, NY",10,5,32,5.0,8/27/2017,Service and food was great! They did have great cheesecake chocolate Godiva! We had a fun night to celebrate anniversary!
Peter M.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",0,6,,5.0,9/5/2017,"Great food, great staff I was very pleased with my experience there. The food was fresh and super delicious, the server was super friendly and super quick service I will be returning for sure"
Phil S.,"Ridge, NY",0,46,73,4.0,4/24/2017,Recently I took my family here for lunch and it was our first time here. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and was very lively for a Sunday afternoon. There was about a fifteen minute wait time until we were seated. We started with some apps which were delicious. I ordered a giant burger which was so good and everyone else had chicken salads which they all enjoyed and were huge. Each of us had a different type of cheesecake for dessert and no one left disappointed. They have dozens of different kinds of cheesecake available so there is something for every taste. Service was good and we have no complaints. Will be back.
Kim C.,"Kings Park, NY",49,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Started out great. Sebastian was great..then shift change or break over...or some other ridiculous thing that seems to happen every time we go. Our food took forever. We were there about 2.5 hours! A burger and lettuce wraps! 2.5 hours! Food was cold, plates scalding from sitting under heart lamp. Dressings hot and crusted over. Wrong dessert brought. Manager took care of our dessert. Didn't really seem surprised of our complaint. Hate fake apologies. I have given this restaurant way too many chances...never coming back."
