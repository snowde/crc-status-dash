Kristen W.,"Smithtown, NY",29,7,1,5.0,2/18/2014,"The s'mores cheesecake was to DIE for! Fire roasted marshmellows...YUM! Also, the service at the bar was excellent. For dinner, I had the BBQ chicken salad which was excellent!! It was huge....I had plenty for lunch the next day! :)"
LongIslandgirl N.,"Stony Brook, NY",0,28,,4.0,12/6/2011,"I am originally from Boston area, when living up there I used to go to the cheesecake factory next to Burlington Mall (the mall they film Mall cop).  I've never had any problem w/ restaurant food chain until I moved to Long island.  My husband told me the food chain on long island is NOT the same as the ones in Massachusetts area...And I agreed w/him, I secretly tried a few chain chain and was VERY grossed out...red lobster, friendlys, ruby Tuesday, TGIF etc. When they put up the Cheesecake Factory..I was VERY excited...The menu has EVERYTHING..great for luncheon.  My favorite of ALL TIME IS THE PUMpernickle bread. I LOVE their small plates menu an choices...LOVE IT.   Can't go wrong with this place...oh yeah..1 thing...it's LOUD!"
Alex F.,"Coram, NY",8,17,8,2.0,12/17/2014,"My fiancé took me for the first time for our anniversary a few days ago. Immediately upon entering I noticed that the restaurant kinda reminded me of Bravo so I was excited that they would have amazing food. Not the case. No where near the case. As soon as the waiter found out I am gluten free he told me everything they have gf tastes like cardboard. I wanted to go home and not waste the money but we stayed. I ordered a gluten free cheeseburger and fries. I asked for medium well. I got medium rare. The manager came out and apologized so that was nice. They re cooked it and the waiter was right. The bun was awful. I've been gf for a year and a half for medical reasons, and I know the gf products well. This was clearly a cheap brand and that makes all the difference. The fries had a funny taste lin the background but I ate them anyway due to the fact I couldn't eat my burger. The reason I'm giving two stars is because of the manager and the guys working behind the cheesecake stand. They were so sweet in checking the ingredients to make sure I could have a piece of the gf cheesecake. And it was actually really good :)"
Jennifer M.,"Lake Grove, NY",21,92,26,4.0,7/21/2013,"ALways busy, so try to come by during ""off"" hours. Love the cocktails and the corn fritters. Outdoor seating facing the new section of the mall."
André C.,"Brooklyn, NY",234,21,17,4.0,7/16/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is the Ritz-Carlton of franchise restaurants! The menu is the size of the Bible and the food is the size of Manhattan. It is the ultimate attempt in legitimizing ""American"" Cuisine (whatever that means). Compared to the CF in Westbury and Huntington this one is far smaller and it appears to be less known since the wait wasn't very long. The wait staff is eager and --as is typical at CF--very attractive.  I had the usual Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combination. I have had this dish many MANY times in other CFs because it's my favorite. This location, however, didn't prepare it the way I'm accustomed to tasting it. The steak diane did not have the worcestershire sauce that accompanies it and the Chicken Madeira appeared ... well... to be a normal portion. The food was exactly as promised in the other CFs but not this one. My date had a Chipotle Chicken Pasta which was perfect. It was the right blend of spice and cream and after we let the volcanic temperature cool we tasted a yummy wannabe-Mexican dish.  The appetizer was a typical quesadilla. It was stuffed with really good chicken and a healthy serving of guac, sour cream and pico-de-gallo. The cheesecake was the expected enormity of calorie goodness that CF is known and loved for. I got the Red Velvet Cheesecake and it was bar-none the BEST cheesecake I've ever had. Moist, thick, creamy and sweet, it made the experience religious. My date had the Godiva cheesecake. Grant it, I like Chocolate, but you need to be a serious cocoa lover to eat this thing. It's an overpowering dose of chocolate both unsweetened and semi-sweetened. The lack of cheese in the cheesecake did not escape me, it tasted more like a chocolate pie and since this is as American as it gets... I guess we can call it whatever we want.   If it were the CF in Westbury it would have been an easy 5 stars but since I didn't try the drinks, survey the bar or really order enough variety I must don upon it a 4 star rating."
Breigh B.,"Ridge, NY",9,4,,3.0,3/2/2015,"I had my first experience at this chain in this location, and I have mixed feelings about the restaurant. The atmosphere is lovely and warm, but a lot of the tables are uncomfortably close to other guests; I almost felt uncomfortable talking to my best friend, whom I dined with, at times. Our appetizer was delicious, we had some of their hot wings. I was disappointed with the entree though. I ordered one of their signature burgers and I did not enjoy it. There was nothing special about it, almost as if I had ordered a burger from a fast food chain restaurant. The cheesecake, of course, was by far the most excellent part of my experience. We ordered a slice of white chocolate and macademia nut cheesecake and it was heavenly. Our service was good, no complaints about that. I just wish that the actual meal was better matched to the price than it was. The cheesecake was worth every penny, but for the quality of my entree, I would have liked to have paid half as much for it."
Rachel C.,"Chevy Chase, MD",24,108,12,4.0,1/15/2011,"A pretty good place to eat while at the mall. Since it's a chain, the food is what you'd expect from a chain. Nothing remarkable, but this particular chain is tasty nonetheless. I really like the fried mac & cheese, which sounds absolutely disgusting but is actually really good, and you can't go wrong with the cheesecake (that was my therapy after getting rejected from my first-choice college last spring, and it worked, so... yeah). The service is hit or miss. I've had stellar servers and horrid ones, but not much in between. The atmosphere is good, despite the fact that it's a chain, the way it's decorated makes me feel like I'm not in a run-of-the-mill chain restaurant."
Trish O.,"Melville, NY",2,12,,4.0,10/11/2013,"Ron the manager is awesome!!! Couldn't be bothered with girl in front taking table bookings - had a frown and was not friendly but waiters were great and Ron made it a worthwhile experience. Ron, you rock!!"
Brian M.,"Miller Place, NY",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2013,"To go service was complete disaster. Only one person bringing out orders one at a time..take money get change bring back change... Doesn't bring my food on the way back. Said order would be ready in 20 mins it was 40. Called to say that I was there...10 rings before someone answered said be right out.10 mins later called again...be right out and they bring out a cars food who got there 10 mins after me. No apologies, complete joke never again. Just awful, now going to reheat Luke warm food that was sitting there because iof am inept server!!!"
Doug W.,"New York, NY",128,44,60,5.0,9/30/2011,"Here's a chain restaurant that does it right! In all of my visits to this location (and others), I've always enjoyed gargantuan portions of good food, attentive service (with perhaps a few exceptions), and the attractive ambiance. If you've been to one before, I need not tell you that the menu is huge and the prices are fair, especially considering the oversized portions. I love their portobello mushroom sandwich and their luau salad! Speaking of which, their salads, like everything else, are larger than life, so come hungry or order with the intention of splitting your dishes with company. For salad lovers like me, ask for the dressing on the side so that your leftovers don't wilt in the fridge! This is not a five-star restaurant when compared with high-end, one of a kind gems, but for a chain, this is as good as it gets."
Celeste Z.,"Middle Island, NY",2,1,,4.0,10/16/2013,Amazing food and ambience! Music was great too which was surprising to be honest cause you really don't get that too much restaurant's now a days. Food was amazing I recommend the chicken teriyaki with extra sauce on the side. Sooooo good. My friend had the steak with fries and said it too was delicious. My only prob was we where given the wrong cheesecake which we discovered after we left because we go it to go. And I wish out waitress was a little more attentive but these things are fairly minor issues. I'm planning to go back again soon.
Kathy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,26,8,4.0,1/18/2011,"I love the variety that they have on their menu, with Asian, american, Mexican, Italian, and anything else that I've missed. Asides from the mouth watering variety of cheesecake that we have to look forward to for dessert, I must say my family and I have enjoyed the great selection of appetizers and entrées, and I, personally, a giant mouth watering burrito and a great lemonade. =]"
Alicia N.,"Manhattan, NY",6,28,,4.0,4/22/2011,"Just went here for a big dinner party.  The menu is very eclectic...definitely something for everyone.   I had the chicken carbonara dish which was very good...little daunting to have the calorie count next to the entree though.   My beverage of choice for the evening was a long island ice tea...after effects were nice very relaxed :)  They have a selections of beers (bottles or tap), a mixed drink menu too that almost all looked appealing! What most people come for of course is...the cheesecake.  if there's a topping you'd like to have on or in your cheesecake they pretty much have invented a pie with it.  I'm a fan of the oreo cheesecake, the peanut butter ones, red velevet cheesecake was real good too.  There's so many I could list that I've sampled over the years and felt were soo good!   You can also buy whole cheesecakes for that special occasion (which are always a hit). Check 'em out if your in the area...or pick up a slice to take home."
Kristel K.,"Sound Beach, NY",18,12,,4.0,5/23/2011,"I'll preface this review by saying Cheesecake Factory really isn't anything special -- it's basically a more upscale version of Applebees or any other American eatery in a similar vein. However, with a menu that's over 20 pages long and with options ranging from Mexican to Italian to Asian and your standard choices (burgers, club sandwiches, chicken, etc.), you really can't go wrong. It's so eclectic, and you can even opt for breakfast--which is served all day long--if you're feeling something different.  My dining experiences over the years have been varied. The first time I ever went to CF, my friends and I literally spent 3 hours just for a simple lunch and cheesecake. Took nearly a half hour just to get seated, then another half hour for the waiter to get our drinks once we did get a table. And it was lunch time during mid-week so the crowds weren't awful. And another time my friend and I were seated at the long rows of tables where everyone is crunched together (so basically you're knee-to-knee with a complete stranger). But it was super packed that night so it's understandable. But I have had some wonderful experiences too. I find it's best to go with a group of friends you want to catch up with (especially if you're seated at that half-circle shaped table with the lit-up wall behind you...so intimate and cool! Oh! And the little tables outside with the heated lamps are always very nice when you wanna eat outside!) because the wait won't seem so bad once everyone starts chatting. The bread basket they serve before your meal is to die for! (I prefer the pumpernickel over the white). Appetizer and meal wise...hits and misses. The ceasar salad, while good, had a little too much garlic, and an unmistakable anchovie flavor to the dressing that made it slightly sickening. My breath was so rank afterwards! The buffalo chicken sandwich is yummy, but then again I am a big fan of anything smothered in hot sauce, lol.  Yeah, but let's face it: we're all there for the cheesecake. And this is where CF excels and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. The choices are all so delicious that you want to try a different one each time, and more often than not you aren't disappointed. The Banana Cream Cheesecake is a personal favorite (light, creamy and just enough banana), but I also love the White Chocolate Raspberry, Tiramisu, and Key Lime. Portion sizes are usually very generous (although I've noticed they tend to skimp when you're taking out) and worth the hefty $8 price tag.  Overall..come for the cheesecake, although the place will do for a night out with some friends. Nothing spectacular as far as dinner goes, but the cheesecake is memorable and leaves you coming back for more. :)"
Brett B.,"Ridge, NY",9,75,11,3.0,7/30/2012,I hate to say I love this place...it is good and would eat here more often. I can only imagine all the calories...and that is without the cheesecake. I would come more often if not for that...and I think they use way too much salt on just about everything.
Walter S.,"Westbury, NY",0,20,,5.0,9/2/2013,This place is where you need to go if you are really hungry. There are hundreds of tables and they are always full. Tells you something. The chicken Romano is superb as is the pots ticker appetizer. My wife loves the sushi and it is always prepared to her liking. The service is great and fast. Highly reccomended. They always refill your soda and do not charge for refills. This has always been a pet peeve of mine in most other restaurants. Try sitting outside near the courtyard and people watch as you are waiting for your food. If you sit inside bring a sweatshirt. Artic blasts are plentiful.
Sunny D.,"Washington, DC",61,204,,4.0,3/22/2010,"3.5 stars but i'm being generous b/c of the dessert.  (and believe it or not, the dessert wasn't even cheesecake.) i got my CF cherry popped here.  the  BF @ the time was a huge fan of the cheesecake factory and i'd never heard of it.  i think he almost considered dropping me when i asked him why this place he kept raving about was so great.  (i didn't dare tell him that, as far as desserts go, i don't even like cheesecake!)  we were living in connecticut and this was before they had one in hartford, so we trekked all the way to freaking long island  for the CS experience.   i have to say...it looked awfully grand to be attached to a shopping mall.  once inside CF, the crowd was overwhelming and even the soft colors, comfy oversized seating and dim lighting couldn't counter the noise level.  ugh.  we were added to the miles-long waitlist and i was then grateful this place was attached to a mall so we could window shop our wait out.  once we finally, finally were seated, our server came quickly and was very friendly.  the drinks (martinis) and appetizers (bruschetta and chicken potstickers) were tasty and also came quickly.  i was very pleased to be able to get chicken potstickers b/c i love them and they are hard to find a lot of places, and i don't eat pork, which potstickers are traditionally made with.  CS got points for that. the menu is huge - really, it's a small book - so it took us (well, me) a while longer to select entrees.  i remember our server being patient and giving a few good suggestions.   i wound up going with something safe - chicken - and the BF got something big and beefy with potatoes, that he loved.  my meal was fine.  huge portions and ok taste.  it had lots of flavor, but IDK, i think it was just too much.  not too salty, but...too rich?  hard to explain.  i think they maybe use a lot of butter or something in cooking.   BUT - and this is a big but b/c this is what earned them the 4th star in this review - dessert was a very delicious and very REAL STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE!!!!  (my most favorite sweet/dessert  .)  i'm not talking glazed, old, sticky-sweet syrupy strawberries - NO. the REAL things.  big slices of juicy, sweet, deep red and FRESH strawberries.  and real, TRADITIONAL biscuit-like cake, not that yellow spongey imitation crap.  add to that a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream and a generous dollop of whipped cream and i was in strawberry shortcake HEAVEN.  mmmmmMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!! :-)  the BF had some chocolately variety of cheescake and got 2 other slices of different varieties to take home.  i really didn't care b/c i was too busy licking my strawberry shortcake plate clean.   i wasn't willing to make the trek back to LI to go to CF again, but i've been to several other locations since and while it's still a 3-star, chain, almost always mall-attached experience, the service is good and the strawberry shortcakes will keep me a fan.  mmmmm...strawberries."
Kasey L.,"Long Beach, NY",0,22,1,3.0,7/24/2014,"Service is totally hit or miss.  The bad: I've had the worst service of my life there. Our waiter took our order and then vanished. I ordered some kind of chicken tacos, my friend ordered a taco salad, and our other two friends ordered pasta. Our glasses were empty pretty fast and all of the bus people passing by didn't offer to fill them. Someone came and dropped off the pasta (still no water in our glasses) and we waited for the rest of our food... Maybe 20 mins later our waiter came by to ask if they wanted the pasta wrapped up. We told him we hadn't even gotten our food yet and he simply said ""sh**!"" And walked away. He came back with our food which had clearly been sitting in the window for the last 20 mins. My tacos were so soggy that they fell apart when I touched them. Still empty glasses btw. The waiter didn't ask how things were or even come back at all. I ended up calling te manager over and my food and dessert ended up being free. I'm a waitress myself and i can't imagine providing such awful service without at least apologizing. Had he profusely apologized it would all have been chalked up to a mistake, but his nasty attitude ruined it. The good: food is consistently good, service is normally good (my experience was unusual) and obviously the cheesecake is good.  There's usually a wait to be seated but that's not an issue."
Aman V.,"Copiague, NY",33,11,1,4.0,4/29/2012,"Ok we all know that Cheesecake Factory is a big Corp restaurant so you don't expect that extra small business friendliness and all, but to your surprise at this location you will.  The manager, Ben, is the reason!  He made this dinner for my family and I an extra special one !  He came out asked how we enjoyed our food and even went as far and to go to the kitchen and explain everything to the chefs as we are all vegetarian and like our food flavorful and good tasting not just veggies thrown in a dish as some of the other big restaurants, cough PF Changs cough... Everything was perfect and I would def go back as this is some of the best service I have gotten in a big restaurant like this one!!!"
Lucia F.,"Shirley, NY",38,250,70,4.0,2/7/2010,"Good food, steep prices on some things, but not too horrible. You have to pay in order for them to upkeep the beautiful restaurant.  The menu is 20 pages long! It's like looking at a magazine. The waitstaff is courteous."
