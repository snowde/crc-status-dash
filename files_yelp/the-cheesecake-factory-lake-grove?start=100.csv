Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",599,2177,3635,3.0,4/13/2014,"Here's a cool trick to this place, at Christmas time if you spend $100 they'll give you a $20 gift card. It's so nice to give a gift card to clients and staff and to get a little kick back makes me say: God Bless us everyone. The part that throws me off is, I don't come here to eat Cheesecake?! Its soooo fattening and I can taste the sugar overload in each bite. Pass I do enjoy having a meal after shopping at the mall and using my $20 gift cards for lunch. I always order a Seared Tuna Tatki Salad. (What's Tataki) Fresh Ahi Lightly Seared Rare with Avocado, Wasabi Pesto, Tomato and Mixed Greens. Tossed with Shallot Vinaigrette. All for under $20 bucks.  Its pretty inside, large and in charge. These places always remind me of Orlando Florida. You can go anywhere in the USA and get the same food.  If you like these places, give it an extra star. See you next January CCF!"
B R.,"Miller Place, NY",0,35,,2.0,3/30/2016,Went for birthday dinner. Two orders wrong out of 6. Server was SO rude. Service was more drawn out than usual. Don't waste your time.
JT M.,"Patchogue, NY",46,28,16,4.0,12/25/2015,"The interior of the restaurant is beautiful.  My wife and I went in to have lunch.  We both ordered sandwiches even though the menu has about 500 owns on it.  I had a turkey burger and salad.  The sandwich was OK, nothing special.  We had a piece of Velvet cheese cake for dessert, which we split.  Our waiter split the piece in half for us to share.  It was all that it was cracked up to be.  I wasn't a big fan of the entry but a great place for cheesecake!"
Justin E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",39,46,,1.0,1/20/2016,"Keep in mind this is a chain restaurant so I never plan to go here but wind up here out of a lack of options.  Most of the time I find the Factory to be a big MEH but this location really is below the Factory standards.   I was here about six weeks ago and I ordered a seltzer water and I had several refills of it.  I asked if there was a charge for it and I was told ""who charges for carbonated water?"".  Well, this past visit I also ordered seltzer water and was charged $3 - WTF.  So I asked our server and was told the charging of soda water is at the discretion of the server- oh really? Ok, no problem, I'll just deduct it from your tip. The service at this location is HORRENDOUS. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were seated right away before the big lines that this place is notorious for.  Our server was not engaging and sighed when my daughter took a few seconds making up her mind.  We had to ask this bloke for water at least three times and finally had to grab a waitress who wasn't even ours to get us water.  He missed out on a third round of drinks because he just disappeared. It took us about 2 1/2 hours for a meal that should've taken 1 1/2 max. Normally when I eat there I order the Chicken Piccata and I switch between the lunch/dinner portion since they serve huge portions;  however, last Saturday 1/23/16, I decided to get the dinner portion and was served the lunch portion.  My server told me it was the dinner size but I've had this plate several times in the past so it just put me in a bad mood.   This visit left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm making it a point to never eat at the Factory again."
Chad K.,"Potomac Falls, VA",133,218,267,1.0,2/28/2016,"My partner and I travel quite a bit and he Cheesecake Factory is where we go if we don't feel like being adventurous in a new area. It's comfortable, always the same standard (or so we thought), and you know what to expect. Boy were we wrong, this has to be the worst Cheesecake Factory in the country. We tried it twice and both times our orders came late (on top of being incorrect), the service took forever, the second time the bread they give you came halfway through our entrees, and the cleanliness of the restaurant never seemed to be up to the Cheesecake Factory standards. We even sat down to utensils with dried food on them at the table. Overall I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory anywhere else but certainly not this location."
Anthony L.,"Nesconset, NY",13,54,7,5.0,7/26/2015,"Love this place. It's my family's ""go to ""restaurant. Especially when we don't know what we want because they have EVERYTHING and everything is good. Wish it was a tiny bit cheaper, but portions are good, service is good, drinks are good and of course the cheesecake is awesome. Lis free warm bread"
Monica C.,"Woodstock, NY",0,10,,2.0,12/16/2016,"The place is very pretty, the food is OK, but our party was really rushed through our meal. It was not cool.  We weren't half way through our salads when the entrees arrived, and my salad was taken away without even asking me.  Later, while we were having dessert and coffee, the bill was put on the table.   I get nicer service at the diner, and they have better coffee, too!  The Cheesecake Factory's coffee was undrinkable.  Ugh."
De'Andre F.,"Calverton, NY",86,1,,1.0,5/10/2015,I can not rate any stars... Horrible experience all around hostess told me 30 minutes and still had to wait 45 minutes and our table wasn't ready when they told us. Also waited 45 minutes for our food. The server brought my mom who ordered they're factory burrito came out placed it on the corner table near me which was sitting on the outside said the plate was hot I tried grab her napkin and she took it walked off even after she said plate was hot. Also after that my daughter ordered mac and cheese which can out super hot took 20 minutes too cool off while everyone was eating we had to give her our food so she could eat because her and her mother burnt they're mouths testing it. Shrimp Scampi was not to our liking I thought it would come with noodles. Overall horrible experience  would not go back to this location. Couldn't even order cheescake because we were so dissatisfied.
Phil M.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",41,150,79,2.0,3/26/2015,Ive had some very average service at best here so I basically stopped coming because of it.  Even the takeout counter the people seem to have a chip on their shoulder.  WHen the nearby Friendlys restaurant has better service you gotta wonder who hires these people who probably make good money based on it's not cheap. Im always amazed at bad help and wish I could fire them all. I also noticed or is it my imagination the cheesecake slices are smaller yet the prices remain high.  At an average on 8 bucks a slice I feel im getting ripped off since they dont taste so great anymore.  What happened?
Cindy CiCi L.,"Garden Grove, CA",300,243,1719,5.0,5/5/2012,"One of my favorite restaurants...Cheesecake Factory can never disappointment me ever! Everything from the salads, appetizers, steak, pasta and DESSERTS is all so very delicious.  My favorite dish of all times is the Pasta Di Vinci with Extra MUSHROOMS!  It also comes with chicken.  Their homemade ranch is also great.  I swear a lot of people rave so much about their ranch, but it's true...it is that good.  For salads, I would usually get thousand island, but at this restaurant, I would get the ranch instead.  What SJ and I had for his birthday Lunch: Appetizers: 1) Chicken Samosa 2) Chicken Pot Stickers (the sauce is very sweet) 3) Vietnamese Taco (not sure why they called this Vietnamese Taco because it should really be called pork bun. If you want to know what we call Vietnamese Tacos ask me and I would gladly show you a picture of it) Main Dish: (we couldn't finish it so we took this to go) 1) Chicken/shrimp jambalaya over rice (extra spicy) 2) Pasta Di Vinci Dessert: (had to make room for their delicious desserts) Red Velvet Cheesecake NOTE: During dinner time, they can get very busy.  1-2 hours wait even.  So expect the wait...I warned you so don't get all made when you're waiting. If you don't like the wait than go during off peak hours."
Ann C.,"Rosedale, NY",0,6,,5.0,11/8/2016,"I dined at this location recently, there was little to no wait to be seated. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered Long Island iced tea, it had the right amount of alcohol content. The appetizers were great crab artichoke dip and pot stickers I give everything five stars!"
Michael S.,"New York, NY",4,10,,5.0,6/2/2016,"It's Cheesecake Factory... it's SO good :) The desserts are amazing. It can get busy at times and you'll have to wait around 10-15 minutes sometimes to get a table, but it's worth it :)"
Jay B.,"Smithtown, NY",0,9,,3.0,5/18/2016,"The food is definitely a reason to come here, the staff seems to be slipping with their service.  Last night, my wife and I took my sister in law there and we were all talking about the behavior of the staff.  They seemed disinterested and not focused. To be fair, there was a young lady that temporarily handled our table (server on break??) and she was pleasant and attentive. Hope my recent experiences were a blip and that they will return to a high level of customer care."
Garry S.,"East Quogue, NY",1,212,,3.0,4/19/2016,I try to go after 1ish and before 4pm so I can get the lunch specials and avoid the lunchtime crowd. Service is usually good and attentive.  If you're into salads they are dinner size entrees and very reasonable during til time that the lunch menu is over.
Brianna E.,"Centereach, NY",150,27,2,5.0,1/8/2016,"I always enjoy here when I do go and have no problems with the food, I think it is super good and it was my boyfriends first time here and he's now a fan also. We got the smokehouse bbq burger with sweet potato fries and the 4 cheese pasta and everything was good, but we never received the sweet potato fries but we chose not to say anything because we understand what it is like to busy but I realized our waitress Bianca B. , who was so friendly and attentive kept on looking over like she was waiting for the fries to be brought out and when she realized it has been 5 minutes or so she got her manager Ben who came over to our table and was very apologetic and said being busy is no excuse for you not to get part of your dinner, even though we said it was fine he still said ""order dessert on us"" which we thought was so nice and we were happy because we already planned on getting the Godiva Brownie which is so delicious!  Oh and side note: cannot leave out how delicious or appetizer was.. Fried Mac and Cheese!! You have to get them when you go there, SO GOOD. Bianca and Ben were so great and are one of the reasons my boyfriend and I will always choose to go back to the Cheesecake Factory."
Darrin T.,"Nesconset, NY",0,14,,3.0,11/1/2016,"I love Cheesecake. Who doesn't? I feel that is the best thing this chain has to offer. Very limited menu selection. Food is just OK. Wait times approach the ridiculous mark especially if it's a weekend or forget a holiday.  It's all about the Cheesecake. I say skip the lines, eat dinner elsewhere and pick up some Cheesecake to go."
Beth P.,"Venice, FL",0,6,,5.0,8/8/2015,Amazing!!!! Thank you Tony and staff for being so accommodating and wonderful! You made our night last night. Thank you again!!
Elle P.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",18,23,80,3.0,12/8/2013,"My family has been coming here for many years and overall this place isn't too bad but it gets very, very loud which is a huge problem for us, especially me and the past few times we've went the food comes out cold and/or soggy.  Additionally, They don't have many vegan dishes and for such a huge and popular restaurant this is a big surprise and disappointment.  That being said, if we ever have a problem the manager is quick to come over, apologize and work things out. BUT, we shouldn't have any problem in the first place so Cheesecake Factory really needs to get with it!"
Dann S.,"New York, NY",0,75,,1.0,10/31/2015,"Went here for Sunday lunch.  I checked in with the hostess and told her I was going to the bathroom to wash my hands.  When I was done , she gave my table to someone else Eventually , I was seated. The waiter was overwhelmed and rude to other tables. Two table on either side of me walked out.  The only time the waiter was not rude was when the bill came and a customer service survey was attached."
Anthony A.,"Lake Ronkonkoma, NY",5,4,4,2.0,6/8/2014,"I have only been to a Cheesecake Factory twice.  Once in California several years ago and most recently the location at Smith Haven.  To sum it up, the experience wasn't anything to write home about. First, the food: Eh.  I'm not one to send food back at a restaurant, because I know how it is to work in one...not easy.  Let me start off with the drinks.  The bar looked interesting and the menu had a variety of drinks.  We didn't order any alcohol though.  The appetizers didn't seem too appetizing so we went ahead and ordered our entrée.  We chose the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic.  It was way too salty.  In fact, that's all it tasted like, salt.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, the chicken was actually pretty good.  For desert, we selected the original Cheesecake - shocker.  It was quite delectable.   Second, the atmosphere: Crowded.  I felt like I was sitting in a cafeteria.  Because of the high ceilings, sound echoes loudly.  Also, the seating is very awkward.  The tables are maybe two feet (if that) apart.  I felt like I was sitting with the party next to us.   Third, the service: exceptional.  Although the food wasn't the greatest, our server was very nice and attentive.   Would we come back?  Probably not."
