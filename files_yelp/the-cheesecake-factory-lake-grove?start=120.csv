Doug G.,"Kings Park, NY",124,250,14,4.0,12/11/2014,"It's not my norm to rate major chains except in cases of abberations; either good or bad. This rating is for the positive, because I have visited many Cheesecake Factories but only frequent one. My wife and I are creatures of habit and order the same two things for each visit, and we have done this at other area francises with sad results elsewhere. The portion sizes and quality of food at this particular area happen to be above and beyond their sister locations, so this deserves merit. Major drawbacks to this location are it's immense popularity. Do not go on a weekend evening unless you like waiting for things. I also have a generic bone to pick with the francise as a whole in their drink prices. They charge Manhattan prices for mediocre alcohol, which is why I stick with an unsweeetened iced tea and get it refilled like 4 times. That makes you pee a lot but since the bathrooms are nice, it's no big deal."
Pierrette A.,"Ridge, NY",11,9,4,1.0,8/30/2016,"Before I begin this review, I have to preface that my family absolutely loves The Cheesecake Factory. With that said, our last 3 experiences have been extremely disappointing. We have all but given up on the ""to go"" because the last two times we waited nearly 2 hours for food that we were told would be ready in 20 minutes. The first time it happened, the poor runner delivering the food was the only one out there and it was her first day. She was so sweet, we let it slide...but the next time was absolutely ridiculous 2 hrs?!?! Anyway, so last night, we were at the mall and decided to give them a try. It was a Monday night, so we didn't think it would be overly crazy. We walked in and were told that it was a 1/2 wait...no problem..then two minutes later they said they had a table ready for us, but they had to clean it off. They then came to us and said they had a table available outside. Since we were all in shorts we said we would take the table outside...it took us the 1/2 to finally be seated. As soon as we walk to our table, the couple behind us were making a fuss saying that something was unacceptable and that they wanted a manager..they eventually walked out...the manager came out 10 minutes later. Of course the table we were seated at had the bill from the previous patrons. We were seated almost 1/2 hour before anyone came over to introduce themselves or take our order..and that bill was finally removed. The server that finally came over asked us if anyone had come to us we said ""no, nothing""..but we watched as 2 tables that were seated after us, had drinks, bread and appetizers and we had nothing. We got there at 7:42 and our food didn't start to come out until 9:15. Mind you, each of our plates came out one at a time waiting at least 5-7 minutes between each delivery. Meanwhile another table behind us was complaining to the manager. This was by far my families worst ever dining experience. It doesn't matter how good the food was, the experience left a lot to be desired. I would not recommend going to this particular a Cheesecake Factory location until they get their act together. Very Disappointing  don't waste your time!"
George H.,"New York, NY",50,28,63,5.0,3/25/2015,"For a company like this, it's a favorite of mine personally dut to the fact that their menu is impressive and the quality of the food is amazing.  Whether you have the dynamite shrimp,  fried zucchini,  buffalo blasts, avocado egg rolls, miso salmon, crusted chicken romano,  steak diane, chicken di panna, or a cobb salad.. you can expect the same quality and taste consistently.  Great business model for success."
Saumia M.,"Holbrook, NY",0,6,1,1.0,6/25/2016,What an awful experience. I can't say much about the food unfortunately because I never got there. We came on a busy Saturday so we understood the longer wait for a big party. We were told 45 minutes-1 hour. We waited patiently for one and a half hours for a 10 person party. We occasionally asked the front staff updates to which they would increase the amount of time we had to wait.  So we finally got called and we're put in the corner at a round table with 2 seats missing because they took them to fit 5 people into the booths around us. The waitress seating us didn't even realize. Meanwhile they were clearing a table for 10 and we passed it. So we asked the waitress if she was sure this was our table which she was sure of even though 2 seats were missing. My brother went to speak to the manger because we waited another 10 minutes to find 2 chairs and he was no where to be found. He didn't want to deal with conflict. We left without eating and I can't say enough how unorganized and uncaring the staff is at this location. When we went to speak to the manger he  was no where to be found because he didn't want to deal with it. Don't worry cheesecake because we told 2 large groups on our way out our ordeal and they left too. I will never go to this place again because you clearly cannot accommodate large groups. Take it off the website.
James B.,"Long Island, NY",7,90,,5.0,2/17/2015,"Gotta say, for a chain restaurant, this place takes the ""cake"".  Ordered the Hibachi Steak ""hanger steak"", which came with wasabi mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus.  This was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I asked for the steak to be cooked Medium-Well, and it was cooked perfectly.  Wow.  Not to mention, this pre-sliced steak tasted amazing.  The mashed potatoes and tempura asparagus were excellent as well.  Nothing bad to say about this dish for a mere $20, which was well worth the price.  Wife's dish ""chicken and shrimp gumbo"" was also excellent, and she had to bring the rest home.  We ordered a chocolate mousse cheesecake to split that was also excellent.   Service was great, atmosphere (Tuesday night) was very nice and relaxing, and the place was clean. Overall, I'd recommend this Lake Grove location, as it's really top-notch and a good value.   Thumbs All The Way Up, Up, Up!!!!"
Jay A.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",0,3,,3.0,9/5/2016,We went on Labor Day for dinner at CCF. We are told it will be 20-25 minute wait which was no surprise but we get seated I about 10 minutes. They bring us to our table and it's missing a chair. Seriously how do you seat people without making sure there are enough chairs at the table? Then it took almost 15 minutes for anyone to come for even a drink or the actual food order. Food was good as always But they switched waitresses on us in the middle and didn't say anything to us about the change.
Rich J.,"Glen Burnie, MD",1,54,,5.0,12/12/2014,"OMG Listen, I LOVE this place in a way I have never loved a human. I once chipped my tooth (at my house), got it bonded at the dentist and went here IMMEDIATELY. It broke off again, I got it bonded again and went back to this restaurant right away. If you love Italian food, you will love this place. If you want to try a variety of Italian foods, this is the place to go.  Positives  lots of choices, quality ingredients, food tastes great, AMAZING CHEESECAKE and MUD PIE.  Portions - I can eat far more food than you imagine, like I have never been full. My aunt made a rule that we will eat the dessert first here because otherwise we wouldn't be able to finish our food.  Negatives   Very crowded, long waits at times, pricy  What you should get  - Chicken fettuccine with sun dried tomatoes dinner portion - - Factory mud pie dessert, this is literally one of the best things I have ever eaten. If the waiter were to throw this on the floor in anger, I would have no problem eating it directly off the floor.  The oreo cheesecake and butterfinger cheesecake are also great choices.. but I'm telling you the mud pie is easily the best thing you can find here. When you eat this, remember to send me a thank you for changing your life."
Symone F.,"Long Island, NY",14,127,523,3.0,1/18/2015,"When you are in the mood for something better than a diner but you don't feel like fine dining--this is the place to go. There is so much variety in every category. In a large group you don't have to worry.. Everyone can find something to eat. Moreover, the calories are listed to assist those people who are watching what they eat."
Douglas H.,"Lake Grove, NY",19,1,,2.0,11/11/2015,we just celebrated my Brother in laws birthday  at the Lake Grove location it was the worst service I've experienced in a long time. We let the manager know and he didn't even have the decency to come over to our table. I would write a list on what was wrong but it would take to long this is the first time in my life writing  a review. Doug Hurst
Elizabeth L.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",15,40,26,2.0,10/29/2016,"So let me start off with, I love cheesecake factory, probably come here every year for my birthday because they have the pumpkin cheesecake in October. I love the food (steak Diane, chicken and biscuits) and their cheesecake. I've usually had good waitresses and waiters except this time 10/29/16, my waitress (Ana) was very distracted while taking our order was looking over the booth and just didn't seem to care to look at us. Then she pretty much never came back to attend us or bring over food while she attended her other tables. Our new waitress Sarah, thankfully didn't let my pre birthday get ruined as she was friendly and provided good service. I don't know what Ana's problem was, racist? Bad day? Or just a ""bad shift""  but you can't take it out on someone who will be giving you a tip at the end of the night. Will I continue the tradition to come back here for my birthday and random date nights, who knows but I will definitely ask for another waitress. There are many people out there, please find people who respect your company and provide great customer service."
Chris P.,"Central Islip, NY",15,79,91,3.0,1/18/2015,Food = 3 out of 5 (5 usually reserved for top restaurants) Service = 1 out of 5 star.  Cleanness = 2 out of 5 star Selection = 5 out of 5 For a chain I always find the food cooked well and with taste at the cheese cake factories. But it is still a chain and you can always tell much of the food doest have the love a chef at top restaurant puts into it.  I don't expect this nor do I rate in this respect. We selected the restaurant due to my friends gluten allergy.  Menus has some good choices that cater to this.  I tried the skinny me it choices.  Flat bread were great.  The turkey burger.  Well it was skinny by making it the size of a slider.  My fiancé tried the vegi burger. This was was a good choice.  Taste good and low calorie.  Services was horrible.  They were supper busy but still not a reason for neglected service. Overall selection is great. Cheese cakes are very good and skinny menu gives the dieting people good taste to look forward to.  Place is extremely filthy but again the place is constantly full as the wait on a sat night is about 1.5 hours.   Final summary: good average food well prepared by this location and friendly staff.  But don't expect great service and unforgettable food.  Service is hurt by qty of guest by food quality stays linear.   If you have a complex pallet you will be ok here.
Michele L.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",120,119,164,3.0,6/24/2015,"Ok a lot of people are always all excited over the cheesecake factory like Its super special and I see a well decorated chain restaurant with great decor. I mean what am I going to say...It IS a chain restaurant. I do have one HUGE problem with this location (the only one I have ever been too) ... The moment you walk in the door your phone reception basically ceases altogether. It is the deadest zone ever. Only inside. I stepped out to check in. I do not like to go here for this reason. I am sorry but I do not care what anybody thinks, I need to be reachable no matter what for my own reasons. I was told by a waitress once that they have it this way on purpose to get people to focus on the dining so they don't delay themselves for long periods, tying up seats that are needed. For this, they lose 2 stars. F U cheesecake factory, If that is true. I am an adult and if you purposely scramble my signal your bugging out. If you want us out fast, hire better/ faster servers. this is the tech age we can walk and tech at the same time... I will say that the food is yummy in its mediocrity nevertheless. I have a small obsession with the brown bread with the little oats on top they plop in front of you. I in fact have an obsession with their herb crusted salmon its so damned good. Incidentally it is also the only place I will eat salmon. I don't like salmon normally. I accidentally tried my husbands once and I am stuck on it. Three stars for me is a love hate relationship. If they fix that reception I will fix mine. Until then, hordes of cakes don't make up for making us disconnect from the world we have created via smartphone- sorry."
Mary G.,"Windermere, FL",223,30,11,4.0,11/9/2014,"You can always rely on Cheescake Factory. No matter which one, the food is pretty consistently made. I'd like to see some new items though.  The bathrooms are pretty clean."
Lisa P.,"Mastic, NY",0,43,180,1.0,7/16/2016,Never order eggplant. The way this restaurant makes is awful. The restaurant is gorgeous and very upscale. Value for money is low. The waiter was professional appearance was excellent but service was extremely long.
Hugo R.,"Corona, NY",43,42,135,2.0,11/16/2013,I like cheese factories  Cheese cake are good Service ok  Food I was expecting something good but the food wasn't too good I only like the tamale
Brianna V.,"Patchogue, NY",189,13,5,3.0,4/25/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is definitely one of my favorite restaurants! You can never go wrong with any of the menu choices. Weekends are very busy and there's usually a wait but what do you expect for a superb restaurant. Sometimes the staff is slow which drops them down one star. The environment is very relaxing and has a elegant look but the lights are dimmed to low so at night it's hard to see the menu. Also they have long booths wheres you're practically touching the stranger next to you. Starting off with an appetizer, my top two are the Factory Nachos and the Fried Mac and Cheese Balls.  The Factory Nachos come with melted cheese, pico, guac, and sour cream (you could also get meat). Now for the entrees. My top two would be the Chicken Madeira and the Orange chicken. A little pricey but for the portions and taste it's well worth it! Don't skip desert! You cannot go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting the cheesecake. SO many different choices. I love the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough or the Oreo Cake. Highly recommended."
Anthony C.,"Lake Grove, NY",0,3,,3.0,4/26/2016,Prices are fair. Very clean. Front desk girls should probably be trained better and have better customer service skills. Other than that food is good and fast service for the most part
Ali T.,"Stuart, FL",92,320,707,5.0,10/3/2012,"SkinnyLicious menu, tasty, flavorful menu items... With so many reviews, it's always a challenge to offer a different perspective. We usually stop here for lunch after shopping at the Smith Haven Mall. We had to wait about five minutes while they cleaned off a booth table, but there were other tables available. The place is nicely decorated, similar to all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  The first impression for me is that the menu has posted calories. Yikees!! My usual dishes were way over 1,000 calories. It's no wonder that eating out often makes it difficult to keep your weight under control. The good news is that they have a SkinnyLicious menu.  The items on the SkinnyLicious menu were creative and interesting. We ordered a Flatbread with roasted pear, blue cheese, pecans, arugula, and caramelized onions. Outrageous! The Beets with Goat Cheese, apples, arugula and pecans in a vinaigrette dressing: Delicious! Both items had so much flavor and were reasonable in size and calories.  I had the Tuscan Chicken with grilled chicken, tomatoes, artichokes, capers, basil and a balsamic vinaigrette. It was served over broccoli-rabe and farro. An outstanding dish and the chopped tomatoes seemed to be garden quality. My husband had a sandwich, the BLT, with smoked bacon, tomato, lettuce and mayo on toasted brioche bread with a side green salad. It also was a delicious meal. We had leftovers, and did not order cheesecake. We really were full and did not need dessert. We finished the meal for dinner at home, so calories-wise, it was well within normal eating guidelines. Since everything was so flavorful, we were happy with our choices. This was not diet food, just lower calorie-wise and healthier with extra veggies and salads.  I would recommend the SkinnyLicious menu!"
Steve D.,"Massapequa, NY",344,52,13,5.0,3/30/2015,"Fantastic ! Coffee had a nice strong taste, the cheesecake phenomenal and the service OUTSTANDING ! My waitress Faye was helpful, attentive, smart, bubbly and talkative. She was cute as well. I'll be back for sure."
Valerie S.,"Medford, NY",0,8,,5.0,1/26/2016,"Love the enormous amount of menu options here. Even when I'm trying to on the healthy side, I always have a lot to choose from here. The servers are excellent for the most part and, if you time it right, there is often no wait. My only suggestion would be that they turn up the lights - it's far too dark much of the time if you eat in the evening."
