Bryan F.,"Huntington Station, NY",33,29,86,5.0,8/13/2012,"My wife is a huge fan of Cheesecake Factory, and it is one of my favorites as well. This particular location opened while we were living elsewhere and it has become one of our usual haunts. Part of the appeal for us is that it is part of the Smith Haven Mall complex, so we can stop by before or after shopping and it becomes part of a longer day. Before I started to seriously watch my diet, I would order the Spicy Cashew Chicken over brown rice, which is fantastic. Once I started to be more careful with what I ate, I was pleased that Cheesecake Factory has a very large SkinnyLicious menu which makes it possible to have a full and satisfying meal without destroying your diet. I had a Greek Salad and the Soft Tacos last time I was there (both from the SkinnyLicious menu) and the whole meal was under 900 calories. The downside of this location is that it is very, very popular and when it gets busy, it gets very, very busy and there can be a long wait to get in. But, there is a bar and outdoors seating for while you wait."
Emma C.,"Centereach, NY",33,4,,1.0,3/10/2016,"This review is only pertaining to the awful customer service at this location, not specific to the food at all. The reason I can't review the food, is because we were never actually seated to eat. We arrived at the restaurant, were told there was a 30 minute wait. This was fine, we had two small kids with us, but no biggie we would stick it out. An hour later, we asked the lady at the desk what the status was since we had waited TWICE the allotted amount of time and were getting increasingly frustrated. The lady shrugged us off and told us she had no idea. Five minutes later, we saw the man we originally booked the table with, so we inquired, he said ten more minutes. Ten minutes passed, he saw us getting antsy so he approached us and said five more minutes. Five minutes passed, and nothing. We ended up leaving the restaurant, hungry and annoyed. This wasted over an hour of all our time, and with two young children, you can understand the frustration. This facility needs to work on their customer service, and their knowledge of when they are able to seat someone. I understand being a few minutes off, but this was absolutely ridiculous, with an onslaught of broken promises. None of us will be returning."
Ellyn K.,"Medford, NY",0,17,,3.0,1/16/2016,"Pretty average as far as Cheesecake Factories go. Food is OK, I like the Louisiana chicken pasta. I've had the sandwiches, they weren't anything special. I personally love the cheesecake varieties, but for the price I'd expect a little more all around."
Adam K.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",12,10,,2.0,7/19/2015,"If you're yelping Cheesecake Factory chances are you aren't aware that it's just another Applebee's/Fridays clone with a more mature atmosphere. The food is always lacking, but the one exception is the Kobe burger. I don't know how you can make a bad tuna tar tar, salad, etc and yet make a phenomenal burger. Odd. Decent waitstaff, always a wait, it's basically just good for convenience when you don't want food court and don't know how good Bobby's Blue is right next door."
Scott T.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,2.0,1/3/2016,Stuff came out cold. Kobe Burger was not Kobe beef. Cold fries. Tomato still had the stem on it.  Food subpar. Sat down and wait staff completly overwhelmed.  I think menu is to big.  The decor and atmosphere is awesome and is a very nice set up
A. O.,"New York, NY",167,76,106,2.0,8/29/2015,"I've come here multiple times and leave disappointed. The service has always been slow and the food is just okay, but definitely not worth the price."
Jill F.,"Manorville, NY",189,232,165,5.0,4/3/2014,"How have I not yelped this place before?!! Haha. I love this place... DECOR: Very nice decor inside, huge high ceilings and a very detailed/artistic style of decor inside. The only thing that bugs me is the lighting is too dim (in my opinion at least). FOOD: What's important to know about this place is that it is a chain restaurant, yes, BUT it is a huge step up from your typical Applebees or TGIF. 1. the portions are much bigger, and 2, the food is much better quality. I have a friend that works here as one of the cooks, and I always ask him what stuff is frozen, what is freshly made. At Applebees, almost everything they serve you is frozen and reheated. Surprisingly, at Cheesecake fact, the ONLY thing frozen (according to my cook friend) is their cheesecake! All the other food on the menu is freshly made. You can tell, too. Because items like their orange chicken, mashed potatoes, mozzarella sticks, chicken marsala, burgers, etc are to die for. I highly recommend the orange chicken entree though (but ask for mashed potatoes instead of rice). SERVICE: Not bad service here, usually pretty friendly waiters. If you're coming here on a weekend night, prepare for a wait. Usually not bad, maybe 40 minutes-ish. But almost always a wait if its a fri-sun evening. They have a pretty large bar though that you can wait at and if a spot open up for you to sit, you can just sit and eat your dinner there. Did that once, cut the wait time from 40 minutes to 5 haha."
Chris B.,"Holtsville, NY",148,104,86,4.0,4/10/2015,"The food here is very good and the desserts are to die for. The place is very opulent and fancy but I will only dine here if I am not the one making the decision as to where to dine. The prices are a little on the pricey side all things considered. The menu is huge...you could eat here everyday for months and not even make a dent in the menu. My last visit I really enjoyed my meal but as I said earlier this place is not my first choice due to the fact that it is expensive for a family of 5, but worth it for a special occasion."
Amy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",471,356,301,5.0,1/17/2010,"*HUGE slices of cheesecake! *the Red Velvet and Oreo's cheesecakes are my favs. *strawberry cheesecake was good, but not my #1 pick. *topped with lots of whipped cream."
Kim R.,"Manorville, NY",0,30,2,1.0,3/23/2015,This place is a joke !!! Yea the cheesecake is yummy ! But wen did the pieces get so small they could fill a cavity in your tooth !! And the price outrageous 9 dollars for a piece the size of a cookie! And the counter people nasty and rude! Not worth the ride for my birthday
Jane M.,"Brooklyn, NY",124,214,315,5.0,5/10/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is literally one of my favorite restaurants. It is really unfortunate that you can only find Cheesecake Factory in the suburbs like Stony Brook. However, I just really love their food. Their pastas are so good like every single kind. Their burgers are good. Their salads are good. Like seriously, everything is good here. If there's one thing I don't like about Cheesecake Factory is actually their cheesecakes but hey, that's because I don't like anything super sweet or super heavy."
Frankie B.,"Hartland, VT",3,11,,4.0,9/27/2015,Place is awesome. Went three times now and they never disappoint. I got the steak Diane with the chicken Madeira last time out. Was super good. Tons of flavor on both. The chicken was surprisingly good and the steak was cooked to perfection. The cheesecake is always good but don't be shy about going there for a full meal. Worth it!!!
Miss Y.,"East Islip, NY",15,86,15,4.0,4/11/2014,"OK so good before bad, I love the food, I have had a large amount of things but my favorites are the chicken costaletta, (but make sure you ask for extra sauce because it soakes into the chicken) and the buffalo blasts.  Honestly, I usually want to go there for the food, not the desert but that's just me.  I would probably go to sit at the bar and have a drink and some small plates, the menu is just so big it is impossible to try everything.   The staff is super friendly and attentive, and last but not least -- the cheesecake is great - vanilla bean, kahluah, red velvet -- delicious -- and I don't like sweets.  They have other desert options if cheesecake isn't your thing as well.  The caramel macchiato is delicious.   The portions are huge, which is great if you want to eat the meal twice, but it also makes the dishes expensive so I can't go very often.  The atmosphere is nice but the mixed themes are very confusing, I can't really tell what they are going for inside, a lot of cultural mixes and the top of the booths lights look like I'm staring into the eye of Mordor (for you LOTR fans).  The only thing I can't stand is sitting so close to the couple next to you that you might as well be sitting at the same table after waiting a half hour to be seated, which is why 4 stars."
Charlotte Y.,"Centereach, NY",0,3,,2.0,9/29/2014,Terrible food OMG  yeah the servings were huge but it ruins it when it's a huge plate of shit   I can't say I'll never come back again because the cheesecake is too good but I will most likely never sit down and eat here  The wait time really wasn't that big of a deal because it's right in the mall so we put our name in the shopped around a little bit until the buzzer went off  The waiter was pretty nice she was a young girl but for some reason me and my brother both had a bug in our waters and that was completely disgusting.  The cheesecake tho that's some good stuff lol sucks it's so many calories!!
Tiffany C.,"Adelaide, Australia",40,68,114,5.0,9/24/2013,"Being an  Australian tourist, my first thought when seeing this restaurant was ""Oh hey big Bang Theory!"" This is one of the better places to eat whilst in Long Island. I was surprised at the customer service. We didn't book ahead and yet we were seated in around 5 minutes in a nice booth. Reading the reviews I expected the service to be poor/Mediocre at best. Our server was polite and attentive, unfortunately I can't remember his name.  I Ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and the lemon sauce was some of the best I have ever had, it wasn't too tangy or overpowering. The crispy chicken was lightly crumbed, and not overbearing. It was a tad odd having potato skins in the mash potato but they were cooked in a way where it blended well with the entirety of the dish. It didn't make the mash lumpy either. My only complaint: the Asparagus was like rubber, over cooked. So I didn't touch it. I let the waiter know my thoughts both good and bad about the meal and he was understanding and communicative. Their cocktails, whilst a bit pricey were mixed strong, and are good. One more complaint; I didn't have a waiter named Penny!"
Phil H.,"New York, NY",5000,3189,11365,4.0,5/19/2011,"Monster amounts of eclectic comfort style foods and  terrific waistline expanding cheesecakes. Normally I get one of the food coma inducing meals here, but when I dropped in last weekend while killing some time at the mall I decided to try and eat light.  I was visiting family last weekend and abandoned them for a few hours in the afternoon to decompress. You all know how it goes when you are trapped and need to escape. Wandered in and saw a long line of people waiting for tables, yet the bar area had a good amount of seating open. Found a nice seat at the bar and had the ball game on overhead - perfect. Grabbed a nice cold iced tea and looked through the encyclopedia of a menu. They serve breakfast all afternoon and decided to go with the Energy Breakfast -  scrambled egg whites served with grilled chicken breast, tomato, mushrooms on a bed of spinach. Also came with thick whole wheat bread. It is nice to have a healthier option now on their menu in case you don't want one of the regular heavy meals.    Of course, I destroyed the healthiness of it all by ordering two slices of cheesecake! White chocolate raspberry truffle and wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. Both are just plate licking delicious. Yes, I know I have a problem. I need help."
Tom H.,"Riverhead, NY",32,15,,2.0,12/31/2014,"service was good our waiter was very kind. But our food was cold, the chicken was uncooked and the cheese was hard. With out me even saying a word the waiter refunded our money it was much appreicated. The waiter staff really saved the night. Other then that they have great cheese cake."
Jennifer R.,"Rocky Point, NY",58,38,6,5.0,3/29/2015,Food was great but the staff blew me away. Amazing service and fantastic atmosphere. The desserts are worth every penny! We will definitely come back here!
Camesha R.,"Selden, NY",574,173,567,4.0,9/25/2013,Love this place. The food is always good. The Georgia Peach is SLAMMIN! And lets not mention the cheesecake....Yummmm. The staff is always friendly & fun. Will definitely come back soon!
Danika C.,"New York, NY",323,173,21,4.0,9/26/2013,"I came here for lunch a few weeks ago during the weekday and was blown away by the shear amount of selection. Prices were decent and portions were huge. I got a pizza lunch special where my side salad was bigger than my torso. The pizza was flavorful but a bit too soggy in the middle and had questionable crust. I did not finish it- too big, way too big! SO and I also opted for apps or small plates as they call it (b/c we're fatties like that). There was a zucchini/avocado/mushroom fries plate that we loved (loved!) and spicy shrimp in chipotle sauce (also good). Can't remember which pasta SO ordered but it was big as well. As we always come here and leave too full for dessert, we decided to force one down. After pouring over their extensive menu, we opted for the carrot cake/cheesecake (learn from our mistake- don't do this!). It basically reminded me a drunken baking session and had the 2 lumped together haphazardly instead of being the delicious description we read.  Cheesecake Factory I can't believe your cheesecake led me astray but I still love you! Probably one of the more expensive lunches (~$70) we've had in a while, but we overall full and happy."
