Rob R.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",0,2,1,1.0,6/28/2015,Just went here for a graduation dinner.  I ordered a burger and when it came I noticed a layer of what looked like plastic stuck to the meat.  I showed the waitress and she confirmed that the layer was in fact the packing that goes between the hamburger patties. They did offer to make me another meal but to me the damage was done.  Imagine if I never inspected the burger and just ate it??? Can you spell TOXIC!!
Audrey K.,"New York, NY",286,376,559,4.0,6/3/2011,"I am a fan of any/ever Cheesecake chain restaurant, but this one was particularly nice in that it was quiet... and the outdoor area was huge! The portion are, as usual, gigantuous and the flavors are clean and fresh.  I normally steer clear of the pastas and heavier entrees, and stick to my usual fish tacos, thai lettuce wraps and shrimp and bacon club sandwiches - amazing! The cheese cakes are also delicious, and impossible to finish. One of my go-to chain spots! You won't be disappointed."
Dorothy S.,"Holbrook, NY",33,1,,5.0,6/13/2015,"Our server Adrian at Smith Haven Cheesecake Factory was amazing. He was Super sweet and super personable. He gave us recommendations that were spot on.  The wait on Saturday night was 10min, the food was delicious and the service was off the hook! The atmosphere outside was perfect just like the weather. Highly recommended, if you go.. Request Adrian!! ...and the recess peanut butter cheesecake.  Thanks Adrian =)"
Cathy D.,"Killington, VT",0,13,8,4.0,3/22/2015,This place in Phenomenal but the service is a hit and miss. It's all who ya get as a server that determines your over all experience for the night!!!
David L.,"Westbury, NY",1,21,34,3.0,2/1/2014,"We had a party of four on a Friday night. It was a 30 minute wait. The buzzer went off after only 20 minutes but we still had to be seated. It took another 15 minute. Don't really know why. Our waitress was nice but she may have been a little too busy. The food was really good and the price is right. We tried the banana cream cheesecake, it was ok. Overall it was a nice meal."
Barbara K.,"Delray Beach, FL",0,5,,4.0,9/11/2016,"Until yesterday I hadn't eaten in a Cheesecake. Factory in many years. It's not that I didn't like it, but rather that they always gave you ginormous portions and the food was very fattening (especially if you ate a slice of their delicious cheesecake for dessert!). So I was very pleasantly surprised to discover yesterday that they now offer a ""skinny-licious"" menu of small plates and lower calorie options. I chose the tuna carpaccio small plate and it was delicious and only 240 calories.  They even had no-sugar-added cheesecake with strawberries & whipped cream which was about half the calories of their regular cheesecakes and I treated myself to a slice of that  too.  This was a terrific and very filling lunch and I will definitely eat there again when I visit the Smithhaven Mall, and other locations!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the service wasn't  great. My waiter disappeared for long periods of time and I had to send a busboy to search for him and send him to me!"
James D.,"Nesconset, NY",11,50,118,4.0,8/25/2011,"Here is the skinny When you have a group that has no idea where to go, this is a fine choice for 2 reasons. - Menu has approx 5000 choices -Drinks are pricy but always great Dishes that shouldn't even been good here are, its impressive. Why is the special always pecan crusted catfish????"
Victoria J.,"Saint James, NY",24,66,12,5.0,12/27/2014,"Best salads I have ever had were all at this Cheesecake Factory. The service and waiting time for a table can be a bit annoying, but it is definitely worth it! I love going here after a bit of shopping at the mall."
Kristen C.,"Town of Smithtown, Long Island, NY",18,2,4,3.0,1/10/2014,"I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory in the Smithhaven Mall for several years now. I always enjoy my time at the Cheesecake Factory, however, it is not the best restaurant.  The food is good but not gourmet. I feel as though most of their food is too rich- for instance, all of their burgers are very heavy. I will say, however, that the menu is big enough to please most people's taste buds. There are a few dishes that I do find quite delicious. The Chicken Bellagio, the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta, and the Four Cheese Pasta. I would recommend any of these dishes because they aren't too rich, but they are full of flavor.  The cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory is very good as well; there are so many different types to get. My favorites are the Raspberry White Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake and the Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake- both are on the lighter side after having a big dinner. One thing I do not care for is the seating arrangements. I feel as though many of the tables are WAY too close to each other and this does not offer privacy, considering you can hear everything your new neighbors say. The Cheesecake Factory is always very crowded so I understand the need for a large quantity of tables, however, I feel that the space could be used more effectively than it is."
Lara P.,"Smithtown, NY",7,14,,3.0,2/27/2015,It was ok.   Service was very slow. My husband's steak was undercooked.   It shouldn't take ten minutes to get my toddler strawberries.  Skinnylicios menu items were good.
Kenneth M.,"Lake Grove, NY",0,19,3,4.0,2/26/2015,Very large menu. A wide variety of food presentations. Pleasant friendly staff. Warm environment. Early bird! Consistent as per the chain. Large parking lot near the Smithaven Mall. Food consistently good. Desserts are limited to wide variety of cheesecakes. All good if you like cheesecake!
Thomas F.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",205,96,12,4.0,6/17/2013,"Probably the best place to eat out for dinner for a Stony Brook University student.   It has a great variety of dishes and the are well made. The customer service is awesome. It really feels like they care about the customer experience and will do anything to right a wrong. These cheesecake is a must have but I always end up too full to fit anymore after I'm done with the entree, that's how big the portions are.    Tip:  try the avacado egg rolls, it may sound strange but trust me it is delicious."
Kathryn W.,"Long Island, NY",382,251,89,5.0,11/28/2012,"I have been here a number of times, and can truly say that I have never been disappointed with anything on their menu. The service is always fast and friendly, and I love being seated in the big booths. There are always a ridiculous amount of mouthwatering items to choose from on the menu (my absolute favorite is the fried macaroni and cheese; it's the best I've had anywhere!), and let's not forget all the delicious varieties of cheesecake they offer! I will always be a big fan of the CCF."
Camille C.,"Central Islip, NY",0,10,,1.0,1/4/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided to have lunch here yesterday. Our waitress was so abrupt, got my order wrong and never refilled our water glasses. Water is all we drank. My boyfriend got very sick after eating his salmon, brocolli and mashed potatoes.  I ordered a turkey burger with nothing but cheese but when she brought it there were onions on top. Blech! So they had to make it over. This is my third time coming to this restaurant and the food wasn't good.  No more!"
Sherry N.,"Plainview, NY",0,2,,3.0,2/14/2015,"The food is great and I also love the environment. But... the service and cleanliness? Not so much. I went there to eat dinner and they kept me waiting for nearly an hour. And the glass was pretty dirty :(  I know they're busy and all that, but I wish they could do a little bit better?"
Haiyin T.,"New York, NY",71,32,5,4.0,3/18/2013,"I always go here for the happy hour because the appetizers are only 5 bucks!!! Everytime i go with my friends i order like a whole table of appetizers. The fried calamari is aaaaaamzing. I would also recommend the crabmeat dumplings.  To top the appetizers off, I end with a cheesecake.... my favorite was the oreo one cause i love everything chocolate! But i always regret going to cheesecake factory because a piece of cheesecake is like....1000 calories. Highly recommend to anyone who love sweets. But if you are trying to watch your calories... STAY AWAY!"
Ankur P.,"Boston, MA",3,122,,2.0,6/2/2015,if your eating here you should already know you had absolutely no taste.  i was forced to eat here.  its the kinda place you would eat if you think disneyworld is the best vacation spot in the world.  if you are considering eating here please take stock of your life and decide if you can make changes for the better
Rohit M.,"San Jose, CA",54,148,20,3.0,5/16/2013,Regular cheescake factory. Very nice chain that you can go to when you have no where else to go or you are bored of every other place. Definitely a decent option once in a while.
Chuck G.,"Sound Beach, NY",182,182,18,4.0,8/3/2014,"I was skeptical about this place.  I had preconceived notions about how good a ""chain"" restaurant could possibly be.  The worst part of my experience, which I almost let ruin it, was the incredible wait time.  There's approximately 6 seats in the waiting area for about 100 hungry, irritable, impatient diners.  Anyone who would bring a small child to this place during prime dinner hours is a glutton for punishment and is asking for a night wrought with disappointment, displaced anger and infinite frustration. I was overwhelmed by the menu.  I like food.  I like inventive food that is brimming with creativity and I like comfort food that is familiar and standard fare.  If you are like me, looking at this menu is like a full page calculus problem.  You don't know where to begin and feel defeated before you even start to really explore your options.  I picked Chicken and Dumplings.  It was better than I would have imagined.  Apparently the Cheesecake Factory goes to great lengths to insure the food they serve is made with fresh ingredients and is prepared to order.  No shortcuts taken.  The waitress reported that the prep-kitchen is incredible and that almost ""nothing"" is pre-prepared.  The bread is heavenly and the cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory is worth an extra few miles on the treadmill the next day.  I will visit again when I can figure out a time and day when the wait-time is less than an hour."
JiaJia T.,"Hauppauge, NY",401,376,526,4.0,8/12/2010,"I almost don't want to admit how much I like this restaurant since it's a chain, for crying out loud!  There's something comforting coming here and then walking off the calories around the mall.  The avocado rolls, crab cakes, pastas, and miso salmon are all very good.  This restaurant is definitely a step up from the other chains."
