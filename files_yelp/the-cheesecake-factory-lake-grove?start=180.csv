Caitlin W.,"Portland, OR",91,274,1377,2.0,8/17/2012,I have been to many cheesecake factories in my days and they are all pretty much consistent food wise.  I wouldn't normally write a review here but I was disturbed by my experience here last night.  Came in an hour before closing they had plenty of tables open. Sat down and ordered a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. The server said they would be out shortly. By shortly he meant 15 minutes later. The hot chocolate was cold and had a horrible flavor. It tasted like watered down ovaltine but I didn't bother asking for a new one because waiting other 15 minutes for a new one didn't seem worth it. My mother said her cappuccino wasn't very good either. We both left our drinks more than half full that at the end of the night our server asked if we wanted to go cups. (No we didn't) Normally when you sit down at the Cheesecake Factory you are given a basket of bread with butter. We never were so about twenty minutes later we just asked for some. We waited over 50 minutes for our food in an almost empty restaurant.  By the time we got our food we didn't even want to eat anymore so we took a couple of bites and got the rest wrapped up.  The server was friendly but he was very slow.  The couple next to us ordered cheesecake and coffee to come out together. They got their coffee right away but then waited 20 minutes for their cheesecake. I am not sure what the problem was at this restaurant but they need to get their act together.  When we got up to leave we were the last ones there. I will not be back.
A H.,"Wilmington, DE",1,38,17,1.0,8/15/2015,"On hold for so long that I was able to drive in and place an order, and they still had not picked up. Now it has been 40 mins of waiting on a takeout order of 2 dinner entrees. The place is empty and I'm still waiting, doesn't make sense, will not ever be back if I am in a hurry."
James O.,"Forest Hills, NY",200,101,1,4.0,12/1/2012,"Pros: The Skinnylicious menu is quite nice, which is on top of an already ridiculously large menu. I always wonder how their kitchen keeps up with such a large menu. Great service. In fact I have been to Cheesecake Factories in about 5 different states, this is by far the best service. Food is well done and the service is actually pretty quick and attentive. The wait can be long, but I think it is consistently faster than what they quote you in the beginning. Cons: Why is the floor so slippery? Also I understand the need to have quick turnarounds in the dining room, but they need to take more care in wiping the tables, floors and seats. I don't want to sit down on peanut crumbs Overall: Cheesecake Factory is my one of my favorites of all these chain middle/upper restaurants (Seasons 52 is the other one), for good reasons. You can't go wrong here."
Brad M.,"Oyster Bay, NY",7,34,15,4.0,6/3/2014,"Good food and service.  Best of chain restaurants in area.  Pretzel crusted chicken fingers were yummy.  Skip the avocado, mushroom and zucchini fries.  Chicken costellato is freshly made chicken cutlets pounded thin with a taso (creamy lemon) sauce and very good.  It gets crowded but consistently gives a good experience."
Mary L.,"Olean, NY",0,8,,1.0,4/27/2015,"I was appalled today. Arrived at 11:30 a.m. when they say they will open and waited outside 10 min. for her to unlock the doors. I am handicapped,the bathroom is at the far end of the restaurant and the hostess still sat me at the immediate left in the front of the restaurant. My friend was to meet me at 12:00 so since I had time before the restaurant filled up, I proceeded to the bathroom. There is only one handicap stall,of course,the hostess had to use that one ,so I had to wait quite a while for her to finish. It is very dark in that area and did not see that she had left the seat wet......yes!!!!!WET!!!!!!. the height of consideration......It had been quite a while since i had been there and ,needless to say, I shall not return. It is so sad that some able-bodied people have no consideration for the handicapped."
John R.,"Nesconset, NY",159,8,3,1.0,8/23/2015,"I absolutely love Cheesecake Factory and have frequented other locations many times. This particular location has been the sour apple in my cheesecake factory experience. The quality of food is okay compared to the tasty dishes I've tried in the past. For example, the chicken madeira in the westbury location was not as salty as this location. Also, the service here was terrible. I had called 1-2 days in advance for a pickup catering order for a family get together which consisted of several dishes. I told them the time I would pick it up and thought it would be a breeze to pick up like at the Westbury location. The day came to pick up my order and when I asked to pick it up they had FORGOTTEN TO MAKE THE ORDER! They played it off as if it was not done yet, but the fact that I had to wait 1.5 hrs for them to cook it up is evidence to the contrary. This is unacceptable service for a restaurant! I spoke to the manager and got a measly 2 cheesecake pieces for my grief, but I ended up being an hour late to the party and my mom, dad, and sister were really hungry by the time I got there. This would have never happened at any other location. If I want to get a Cheesecake Factory fix I'll just travel to Westbury, which is unfortunate because this location is 5 minutes from my home."
A B.,"Medford, NY",0,27,,1.0,9/15/2015,this place is just a name. many people i know have gotten sick after eating there. wine is over priced for tiny glass of cheap wine.dont buy cheese cake to take home as you may be shocked after seeing tiny slice for over $8.save you money this place is a joke
Duke F.,"Queens, NY",187,232,220,4.0,11/13/2011,I enjoy a nice cheesecake; Cheesecake factory in Lake grove is a nice place to go to enjoy a nice meal and cheesecake. Place is always busy on weekends. It's hard to find a table there. I usually ordered the shrimp/ black beans/rice caribbean style with some mango toppings. dish is fricking delicious.. Passion fruit mojito double  at the bar is unique. I usually get it from havana central  but this place is not too bad for a mojito.
Lee S.,"Patchogue, NY",1,33,,3.0,6/26/2014,"Had lunch here today after wanting to for years. Actually wanted to go to the nearby Good Steer Rest in Lake Grove, but that did not open till noon so my friend and I came here. First the bad.....we entered the restaurant rpomptly at the opening time of 11:30 and was left standing as the manager finished up a pre opening staff meeting. Rah rah...go get em! Got a nice personable young man as waiter and we proceeded to look at the very expansive menu. (After replacing our rolled up napkin which for some strange reason was wet!??) I settled on the Chili Relenos Burger which was delicious as was the cup of sweet potato fries ( the best I've had so far ) Good cup of coffee and although the prices are a little high, I eat out infrequently, so don't mind paying if its good.  Note to senior management: Your 10 or 15 page menu is nice, but why do I have to look at ads on  my menu?? I mean....WTF? I know you're getting paid for it and all but it just seemed to be out of place. Especially the big ad showing a beautiful young woman in skimpy underwear selling something. No one loves sexy women more than me and I hope I don't sound like a prude, but it just seemed out of place on a menu. IMHO!! Would definitely go back although I would not want to be there in a busy time with a crowd."
V N.,"Great Neck, NY",3,56,49,2.0,4/6/2014,"Positives:  Located in a mall with lots of parking and mear good shopping The restaurant has a nice interior with high vaulted ceilings and decorated with warm colors.  Our server was attentive and helpful. The menu is as usual, extensive and impressive. Negatives: Even at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon there was 25 minute wait. The first time we tried here, the wait was just too long and we went to California pizza kitchen next door. When we actually sat down for a meal, the food took too long to arrive. The Mac and cheese for the kids came out in a soup bowl.... Really? The plate was too hot for the kids to touch. It was obviously sitting under heat lamps while the rest of our meal was being prepared; there was a dehydrated crust of cheese beneath which soupy runny Mac and cheese began to curdle from being over cooked but too runny at the same time. The tuna tartare I ordered had little tuna, and too much avocado. There was little spice other than what tasted like the same sweet ponzu sauce used for the fried dumplings.  5 dumplings were sprawled out on a very large plate and were soaking in scallion flavored ponzu sauce; this made the dumplings fall apart easily. The warm asparagus small plate had an over cooked egg on top with too much sun dried tomato, flabby asparagus, and over toasted pine nuts. The fried shrimp basket was just OK. The mojito was too sweet, and the coke was under carbonated. I have ordered the same exact dishes at the Cheesecake Factory in Westbury and had expected so much more. While the menu was identical, the food was not as well prepared."
Peter A.,"Medford, NY",0,37,,4.0,6/6/2014,"Always dependable. All of the great food choices make it difficult to actually choose an entree! Nice decor, super competent staff. Only complaint is the seating arrangements. Unless im with a large group, im seated at tables with just enough room to get to the seat. Feels like im dining with the people at the very next table. Aside from that, its great!"
Susan Y.,"Medford, NY",77,202,2,2.0,4/14/2012,"I completely disagree with the folks saying that the food is good.  I have yet to find something on this menu that I like ( and I am NOT a picky eater).  The only reason I go here is because my daughter loves this place(she likes the pasta).  I have tried everything from the meatloaf to the salsibury steak and I hated it.  The only good food in this place is the cheesecake.  Also, the horrendous wait is not only stressful but certainly not worth it. I would prefer a dinner at friendlys."
Steven E.,"New York, NY",93,36,82,5.0,4/6/2014,"Decided to take a buddy here for his birthday.  He and I really have enjoyed their steak diane every time we go.  Make sure you try the AHI CARPACCIO for a quick started that is delicious.  Also, I would definitely say the lemon merengue cheesecake is worth it!"
Wilson C.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",107,30,8,4.0,2/14/2014,This place is pretty good. Very crowded on the weekends and Friday though. Come early to get guaranteed seatings!
Jenny T.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,60,11,1.0,1/29/2014,"Their service is disgusting. The waitress who served us had a terrible attitude. The wait is very long, even for lunch. I have been to other Cheesecake Factories and never had such a bad experience with them. The only reason for a star at all is  because the cakes are good."
Heather L.,"Suffolk County, NY",0,69,46,4.0,1/28/2014,"Oh dear sweet Cheesecake Factory, you are one of my favorite chains. I love that no matter what I am in the mood for this place has it. I usually have my signature favorite when I go to a restaurant but here I have several. Some things you must try are the avocado eggrolls because they are to die for. I could eat that whole appetizer myself and then just lay down in the sun and take a nap while I digest. The only thing that makes me feel fatter and more satisfied than them are the fried mac and cheese balls. They're like alfredo-y, cheesy, velvety goodness with something between a bolognese and vodka sauce. They sit in the sauce on the plate and I wonder how I can eat all 4 before anyone else at the table realizes. The fried zucchini is amazing as well as the dipping sauce which is like a ranch. They are always cooked to perfection. My husband's personal favorite are the crab cakes, not the crab bites (we've never had those). I like that the wait staff always make sure to clarify if we're ordering the cakes or bites. As far as the dinners I usually stick to chicken something and it's always really good and the chicken is always juicy and not overcooked. Their alcoholic drinks are a little hit or miss depending on the bartender. I have gone there and gotten drinks that are much too strong as well as drinks that are so weak I want to know if they had alcohol in them. I know everyone comes here for the cheesecake itself, and boy do they have a very large variety of decisions but I am not a huge fan of cheesecake.  I would also like to mention that the portions are huge. It's not a cheap chain to eat at, with drinks and apps it usually runs us around $100 with the tip but you get another meal or two out of your entree.  We have also gotten take out where we did curbside to go which has been nice. Sometimes I just have a craving and don't feel like eating out. My favorite has to be going in the summer when it's nice out and not too hot and getting seated outside.  The indoor seating is hit or miss. If it's busy and it's just two of you you're most likely getting stuck at a table where you're an elbow away from another couple. I hate sitting where the bench is continuous and the tables are a foot apart and then there is a chair on the other side. I would much rather wait an extra 20 minutes for the privacy of a booth. Although when you have a bigger party to accommodate this seating arrangement works well so I see why they don't do away with it."
Sasha P.,"Jamaica, NY",230,153,97,5.0,11/6/2011,"Oh god where have u been all my life!! I love this place as if i gave birth to it (kinda extreme i know). But the whole atmosphere & decor is amazing and very romantic, & oohh yea the food is the bomb! Try the pumpkin cheesecake..yummm"
Jonathan W.,"New York, NY",13,61,13,1.0,1/26/2013,"Let me start off this review by saying I usually love the cheesecake factory. But this location really rubbed me the wrong way, and I will never return.  Arrived around 6pm and it was packed. Me and the two other friends I was with waited around 30 minutes to be seated, which I had no problem with.  We were seated if you can call it that, more like being herded to a table. I felt like I was sitting on top of the table on both sides of me.  It look around 10 minutes for the waiter to come to our table and ask us what we wanted to drink. Figuring that this was gonna be a long night we ordered our drinks and food right off the bat.  Drinks actually arrived fairly quickly, waited around 25 minutes for food. Correction my friends food arrived at that time, mine did not. Once the waiter dropped off their food, he was no where to be found. We called a waitress from another table and asked if she could find our waiter for us. After 30 minutes or so, our waiter showed up, apologized said the place is very busy (as we could see) and he was helping other tables. I proceeded to tell him that my food never came, and I would still like it  (I was Hungry). Sooo he said he would go check on it, he came back to the table 20 minutes with no food, but asked us if we wanted any dessert or the check. At this time we asked to speak to the manager. Manager came over we explained the situation to him. He offered to get me the sandwich I ordered and a cheesecake of my choice at no cost. At this point I did not feel like waiting for the food, but agreed to the cheesecake (to go) since all they have to do is cut it and put it in a container/bag. Boy was I wrong, the cheesecake took another 20 minutes to arrive at the table, and would you guess, it was brought on a plate. We paid the bill, I got up took my plate over to the cheesecake counter and asked for a container myself, took about one minute.  I will never return to this location."
Lisa L.,"Queens, NY",3,128,5,4.0,11/15/2011,"I knew there was a reason why the wait would be so long and why it's a factory for cheesecake... It's the birthplace of all cheesecake! The wait isn't that long, but it's suggested you don't get there too late around dinnertime. You'll be fighting everyone else for a seat. Decor is composed of different art pieces clashed together in the restaurant. The place is very dim, so watch your step! Service is very slow because there is so many people during dinner. Eat slowly! What you need to know about The Cheesecake Factor is that their meals are loaded with calories. ...But who cares? The portions are enormous. I highly suggest splitting an entree with someone, because you will not be able to finish one whole thing on your own. My boyfriend and I ordered the Crab Cake Bites for an appetizer. They looked so cute and perfectly round- and tasted perfect! Not too fishy, and had a very soft texture. Our entree was a combination platter of: Diane Steak & Maderein (sp?) Chicken, served with this very delicious sauce and mashed potatoes. It was great. I'm glad I split the entree, because the portions were enough for an individual. And of course, you come to The Cheesecake Factory for a slice of their famous cheesecakes. I saw the White Chocolate Macadamian Nut Caramel Cheesecake on their list, and my eyes instantly lit up. And of course, so good... All in all, loved it. But the service took way too long for me to get even my appetizer! So if you are patient and willing to wait for The Cheesecake Factory's goodness- then definitely do so."
Marlo B.,"New York, NY",176,28,2,4.0,6/9/2011,"I really do like it here... I'm on a little bit of a budget these days, but when a girlfriend and myself couldn't decide where to eat, I'd rather spend my money on a place that I know I'm going to get great service and food.  When I go out to eat I don't want to waste time with my friend on looking for a waiter or complaining.  This never happens here.   As much as I like the ""hole in the wall"" restaurant.  There is something to say about these corporate chains.  They have policies and procedure to follow, which is why they are successful."
