Tim V.,"Omaha, NE",10,40,1,4.0,7/13/2012,"I'm fully aware of the CF's secret of making everything taste great by pumping it full of fat, but I love it anyways. I'm a sucker for so much of their menu, and their curbside to go pickup is great for when you're feeling both lazy and anti-social. It's also the best chain-dining within about 10 miles. I'm a fan."
Rollo T.,"Holtsville, NY",11,108,78,4.0,6/9/2012,Good typically consistent food. Love the bloody Mary. Most visits to the mall usually include a lunch or dinner here.
Brian M.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",0,14,,2.0,3/5/2014,OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!! menus too big food is suspect and wait staff is shotty at best. last time i went i barely made it home. my girlfriend likes it a lot but her taste buds are clearly whacked.
Joe M.,"Martinsville, NJ",0,40,,3.0,11/14/2010,"We had a party of 10 for dinner last night. This restaurant is very popular and that translates to very, very crowded. Apparently the recession hasn't hurt this establishment! Service: our waitress was pleasant, efficient and thorough. Drinks were refilled without asking and she always had a smile on her face. Appetizers were delivered promptly and the main course followed in a proper interval. In spite of the crowd, we never felt rushed. Ambience: noisy, chaotic, and active. But, if you come to a CF expecting anything else, shame on you. The chaos is the vibe. This is not a quiet romantic dinner spot! Food: solid if unspectacular. The pizzeta appetizer was actually very tasty. Not fancy but good. The main courses were universally good. The exception was my chicken Caesar which was way, way overdressed (almost to the point of being inedible). As I said, no complaints from anyone else and the large portions were reflected in the number of take home packages! The desserts were, as usual very tasty. Summary: a nice night out. Not terribly expensive. Good food and a loud, lively atmosphere."
Jay M.,"New York, NY",34,192,99,3.0,3/4/2012,"Good food, huge selection to choose from.  Always an hour or more wait on Friday and Saturday nights.  Average Prices.  Very loud.  Almost everything on the menu has 1300 calories or much more.  Good desserts but a bit pricey and holy calories!"
Lynn S.,"Smithtown, NY",140,35,204,4.0,1/23/2010,What can I say?  Their Crusted Chicken Romano is YUH-UH-MMMMMMY! Enough for 2 people too! Lots of food choices. Good drinks...try the Asian Pear Martini - I got drunk just smelling it!!! Now on to bigger and better things... CHEESECAKE I am a fan of the Godiva brand. Friends say the classic strawberry and Dulce de Leche is scrum-deli-o-cious but I am a cult follower.:P
Patty M.,"Henderson, NV",159,52,7,2.0,8/2/2013,"WIth a lack of decent places to eat at near the mall (if you want something other than burgers and pizza) we decided on the Cheesecake factory I agree with Rohit M.  who said you go when you have no where else or are bored with every other place.  I would have given it three or four stars but had to deduct for poor service, long wait for food and excuses from management.  We were seated in a nice, roomy booth in front. The waitress came right over to take drink orders, but she seemed overworked and not at all friendly. When we asked her about different dishes, her replies were very curt, like yep, dunno etc. After placing our food order we waited 40 minutes before we saw our food. A different server came over about about 30 minutes and explained that the wood would be out shortly. after 35 minutes I asked to see a manager it took a few minutes for him to come, but in the meantime, our food finally arrived. Two of us ordered the fried shrimp, one got soft chicken tacos off the skinnylicious menu and one ordered chicken parm sandwich. The shrimp platter had plenty of large, golden brown shrimp, a nice dish of coleslaw and fries. It came with both tartar and cocktail sauce. I was happy with the shrimp but the fries were cold. Hubby said the tacos were good and son liked his sandwich. My big issue was how the manager handled the situation. He cheerfully explained that so many people ordered the shrimp that they had to bread more and that took 30 minutes. BUT he said at least our shrimp was nice and fresh! Since I'm a stickler for customer service, I would have preferred 1. to be told that it would be 40 minutes for shrimp and offered something else if we didn't want to wait 2. being offered an appetizer while we waited or 3. after waiting that long, we should have been at least offered a complimentary slice of cheesecake. I scratch my head at the lack of training managers get these days. His excuses just made the situation worse.  Believe it or not, we didn't order dessert because we were pretty exasperated with the whole experience by the end of the meal. I've never gotten great service at this location, so we will usually only go as a last resort. My thought is the Cheesecake factory doesn't NEED our business because people will go there anyway, so why bother with customer service? TIP: Don't go when you're starving and be prepared to wait for a table and for the food."
Kurt P.,"Islip, NY",19,63,45,3.0,12/30/2011,"Food was ok, nachos didn't excite me. Glad they finally put a kid menu together.  Would love some more waiting benches. How about new cell paging system so I can shop n c ome back. Great service today. Cook times long."
Augie P.,"Northport, NY",42,133,1,4.0,11/29/2011,Come early or late if you don't wanna wait. This joint gets very crowded with long waits (1 hour at times) but totally worth it. Food and service is excellent and very consistent. The menu is absolutely huge with everything you could possibly want on it. I personally like to come here and order a bunch of small plates and apps and split them with everyone. This way  get to try a bunch of different foods. Try it and you won't be disappointed.
Vanessa J.,"Commack, NY",0,9,,5.0,3/23/2014,"Went there tonight for dinner. Excellent food, delicious cheesecake...need I say more!"
George C.,"New York, NY",0,7763,14308,4.0,12/28/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places where mediocre food is saved and magnified by good company. I come here with insistent, stubborn dates and large groups of friends...ONLY. I find the CF surprisingly endearing, and I'm enamored with it perhaps because experiences here are always celebrations, splurges, or dates not of the first, awkward variety. Long waits, sprawling decor, fickle lighting schedules, and oft-torrential service characterize this joint on most days/nights. The space out back is newly improved, and to-go cheesecake always tempts me when I'm at Dick's. On my most recent experience (there are too many to count), our table was saturated when we sat down, which wasn't a great start, but we moved on...Until, of course, we received a single bread basket for 5 people and no offer to bring more. Whatever. It's the CF. So the tamale cakes were good and the Jamaican black pepper shrimp was better than I expected, but I need to check their site for calorie counts and nutrition info. The same can certainly be said even for the Lemon raspberry cheesecake, which was relatively light in the grand scheme of their cheesecake offerings, and pretty flavorful. The check was pushed on us (read: me, amidst a table of females) before dessert, yikes. ...And we talked about some old times  And we drank ourselves some beers  Still crazy afler all these years..."
Sal G.,"Farmingville, NY",2,8,,1.0,1/16/2012,My wife and I were seated right away and did not wait as other reviews claim. But that was about the only thing that was good about the experience. Nachos were so..so..broccoli cheddar soup was Luke warm at best....my entrée shrimp pasta was from what I could tell was microwaved after it was prepared for some reason...there is no way it could be so incredibly hot like the way it was served without a microwave..I was not impressed ...the cheesecake was good though if I ever return it will be for dessert only....
ELIZABETH D.,"Saint James, NY",6,11,,5.0,9/17/2011,"The Cheesecake factory is one of my favor places. The drinks are awesome. If you can, try the pink lemonade. It comes in a sugar rimmed glass. I also suggest the pasta with meat sauce. It's better than most Italian places. The only con is that there is usually a long wait."
Craig K.,"Lake Grove, NY",134,86,163,4.0,8/20/2008,"I like this place.  It's got great food and of course great (and many different) cheesecakes.   I got some chicken dish with sun dried tomatoes the last time I was there, and I loved it.  I ate until I was almost sick;  I couldn't stop.  So I obviously couldn't have any cheesecake, that would have been bad probably.  A shame since the name has ""cheesecake"" in it and I didn't have any. This place is big and gets crowded.  I'm not sure about the mysterious properties that Robert L. referred to, but he has a keener sense of smell than I do, so might be right on target.  I give this joint 4 stars."
C M.,"New York, NY",267,454,791,4.0,5/24/2010,"As if the Vanilla Bean Milk Shake at Bobby's Burger Palace wasn't enough...  A slice of Strawberry Cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory would surly put it over-the-top! A dialogue with Rachel after walking out of Bobby's Burger Palace: Rachel:  I'm so full! Chun:  We can walk it off in the mall.  Want some water? Rachel:  I'm said I'm full!  Why would you give me water? Chun:  Just a courtesy... Rachel:  You know what's a courtesy?  Making this stomachache go away! *Note:  This is the part where I think to myself that Rachel was the one who suggested we go to Bobby's Burger Palace for lunch.  As is the boyfriend, I shall accept blame! 2 minutes of walking through the Parking Lot later... Rachel:  Is that? Chun:  Yes it is! Rachel:  Cheesecake Factory! Chun:  Strawberry Cheesecake? Rachel:  I'm not full anymore! We got a slice of Strawberry Cheesecake to go and ate it in the nice 75 degree outdoors...  As with almost every Cheesecake Factory, the flavors are resiliently similar & profoundly appreciated! Strawberry Cheesecake: At first reception, the excessive portion size of the Cheesecake spoke wonders to the receiving eye.  Patrons will notice that the 10 oz. to 12 oz. serving size of the Cheesecake will force any patron to seek a take out box.  Luckily, the excessive offerings produced a welcoming satiety to those seeking gluttonous punishment.  During visual inspection, the Cheesecake was observed to have the proper white color that's accompanied by an elegant soft texture.  The graham cracker crust, acting as the base of the foundation, contained a semi-firm texture.  Finally, the Fresh Strawberries and syrup produced an excellent color contrast to the application.  At first bite, patrons will find that the primary taste observed is from the light, velvety, and fluffy cheesecake.  During consumption, the creamy texture of the application engulfs the palate by releasing the notable cream cheese flavors.  Further tasting will reveal notes of vanilla, brown sugar, and butter, which enhance the creaminess of the cheese by providing a subtle sweetness.  All ingredients used in the creation of the cheesecake work harmoniously to create both an abundance of flavors while keeping the subtle soft texture of the cake.  To aid in the textural contrast, the semi-crunchy graham cracker crust provided the scrumptious surface and cinnamon flavors to further enhance the cheesecake.  Although the Strawberries provided the round about freshness and earthiness to the application, it acted secondary to the palate consuming flavors of the cheesecake. Perhaps perfection is observed through The Cheesecake Factory's rendition of Cheesecake.  By creating an edible that embodies the palate clasping flavors of the ingredients used while keeping the integrity and structure of the creaminess of the cheese, the application stands above the rest in both the complexity and tasting of this application.  Few remarkable words can be noted regarding the superb execution of the cheesecake, but the ones rendered should be emphasized for its extraordinary flavors and execution. Dessert was done and overstuffed is an understatement.  Luckily, food coma didn't kick in until after returning from the drive home..."
Michael P.,"Port Jefferson, NY",64,333,25,2.0,2/9/2009,"A restaurant that claims over 20 ""specialties"" and has over 100 menu items cannot possibly do it consistently and well, and this is true.  I really like their chipolte chicken pasta, and when it is on, it is very good, but when it is bad it is really bad.  It should have a creamy spicy sauce, but often times it comes out all oily and not even creamy and spicy.  Drinks are a rip off, but if you get a mixed drink they certainly make it very strong.  The portions are monsterous and it is a joke when they ask you if you want desert.   The prices are rather high, but not terrible as it is somewhat decent food.   I really dislike their ads in the menus like they do not make enough money.  Place is very clean, but the floor is slippery near the kitchen since people are constantly walking out with greasy, fat laden food all the time.  Also waiting for an hour or whatever ridiculous time they give you is nuts and simply not worth it.  I just go to john harvards and get seated immediately.  I do not mind going here with no wait, but I certainly do not think it is any particular prize, just average."
Fernando J.,"East Hampton, NY",18,19,1,5.0,6/5/2011,"Love it, great atmosphere delicious food and desserts! Conveniently located too."
Green I.,"Long Island, NY",0,94,16,1.0,4/24/2011,"Never again! The Easter from hell, burned steak (horrible), greasy fries, no atmosphere, long waits for seating and service.  Even the cheesecake was a let-down.  Sorry CF lovers, but they've lost me for good, I won't be back.  For first-timers, the menu is pretty bad, weird selections and pairings, and over-priced!"
ELITIA L.,"New York, NY",86,482,927,3.0,2/15/2008,"Three stars.  The decor is classy but ugly, the food is average, and the 22oz Yuenglings cost $6.50.  Good for a quick stop, but nothing to rave about.  There is some kind of additive in the food i can't place: If you get something to go, you can smell it in your car or fridge the next day. . . and it all smells the same; be it pastas, sandwiches, burgers, etc. . . . they claim its not MSG, as it isn't directly added, but they do use Asian ingredients with mysterious properties and origins.  Oddly powerful and full of flavor."
Stephanie F.,"Baltimore, MD",0,14,,4.0,8/22/2013,"Good food, good sized servings, excellent cheesecake.  I never mind the wait.. I know it'll be worth it!"
