George S.,"Smithtown, NY",0,11,,4.0,7/5/2010,Great assortment - something for everyone - service has always been good too.  We're huge fans of the Strawberry Lemonade with the sugar-rimmed glass & the Banana Cheesecake!
V K.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,5,,4.0,9/19/2013,Awesome place with good variety of food and wonderful service. We definitely recommend this place to everyone. We especially liked the speciality pizza and the soufflé.
GG D.,"Lake Grove, NY",1,8,1,4.0,4/5/2011,"Had a problem with this place in the beginning. Recently went back and really liked it. Great selection. Crab cake burger awesome, and i love white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Win in my book for any occasion."
Kimmy B.,"Bayside, NY",3,88,4,4.0,12/18/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a good ""go to"" place.  I have to say, the food always tastes really yummy.  Here are my only cons (that still won't stop me from coming back because they are always very accommodating).  Sometimes they give you bread that is hard as a rock and sometimes the meals come out super cold.  Needless to say, tell them the problem and not only do they fix it, but invite you back for next time.  Really good service."
Diana H.,"Lebanon, NH",168,355,13,4.0,10/1/2009,You know I am usually not a fan of chain restaurants but the cheesecake factory is one of the exceptions.  They know what they're doing.  When I am in the mood for an extravagant salad or a burger I know that the cheesecake factory will never let me down.  Their Tons of fun burger (a big mac gourmet style) is amazing but only if you are very hungry!
Gennadiy R.,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",217,51,5,4.0,5/8/2010,"Fast service, great food, and amazing dessert. This place is one of the reasons why I'm on a diet now. My favorite cheesecake is the lemon raspberry."
Diana F.,"Little Neck, NY",37,188,17,2.0,9/28/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory seems like a more upscale TGIF (and by upscale, I just mean a more extended menu)+Junior's Cheesecake. One star off for having to wait an hour and fifteen minutes for a table for five. Nearly everyone waiting with us and some more got seated before us. Another star off for the rude girl at the front talking shit about me to another person. Our waitress was nice. The menu was far too distracting (and what's up with the advertisements?) to the point where I didn't even know what to order. After debating for what seemed like two years, I ordered the pan-seared salmon and the sauce was a bit too buttery for my liking - another star off. Got a tiramisu and key lime cheesecake to go and the key lime was a little too tangy but it was still good."
e g.,"Centereach, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/15/2012,"Went to the Cheesecake factory this past Saturday night. Arrived at 7:45pm. We told the greeter we needed a table for 9 people. She said no problem, they had a table available right away(first time that ever happened) There were six of us there, three more were looking for a parking space.We were told we couldn't be seated until everyone was present. A few minutes later the rest of our party arrived. We were told there would be a table within 10 minutes because the people had paid their bill and they were just waiting for them to leave. 45 minutes passed, these people were still at that table. My husband spoke to the manager (a Woman)and he was told there was nothing that she could do we would have to wait. After waiting a total of one hour I spoke to this ""manager"" I asked her if she could tell them she needed the table. I was told No she couldn't do that to them. I was no one special. I then replied that we shouldn't have told the greeter that we were waiting for three people . I was told that i we had done that they would have told us to get up because it' s againest their policy to seat people unless they are all their. She was very rude . Anyhow by the time we did get seated(An hour and a half later), we were all so tired we ate the appertizers and had our meals wrapped and went home.  We do like the food but to be treated as we were I know I won't go back there. There are too many really good resaturants where they think I am an important special customer . a we all deserve to feel..."
Terry S.,"Stony Brook, NY",0,7,,5.0,3/8/2012,"I have eaten here consistenty for a few years now. It is almost always amazing. I had one bad experience because of a new cook, but overall it continues to impress me and be one of the best chain restaurants around. My recommendations are the Crispy Chicken Costelleta and Chicken Madiera. You can't go wrong with either. The spinach dip is good, though a little pricy. The red velvet cheese cake is by far the best, in my opinion, and also the most caloric. Definitely a dessert for 2."
jim r.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,73,5,3.0,1/3/2009,This is a safe pick.  This place works if you need a burger fix. The  portions are huge and I can't imagine who those people are who actually have room for the cheese cake.  The menu is extensive and competes with any east coast diner. If you have have a large finicky group  or just cant' decide there is sure to be something on this menu.  The place is  sparkling clean and the service cheerily mid-America like [it's all about great training].   I just can't bring myself to give them more than a three star even though I am sure to go back.
Lee H.,"Holbrook, NY",3,20,3,5.0,11/6/2009,The Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chains that hasn't gone downhill lately. The food is still great and the service is good.  The portions are still big. The wait on the weekends can be a little long but it's worth it.  Lee
Lisa Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,46,6,4.0,1/11/2009,"This was my first time trying Cheesecake Factory with a group of friends for a birthday party.  I didn't really like how we waited for atleast 1-2 hours for 10 people + seats.  But i personally did not have to wait since i was late.  Overall, everything was good.  The dinner itself is pretty filling already.  If you are to get a dessert, you should share.  For for the price wise, it really depends on what you order.  15-30$ per plate.  Desserts are 7-20$.  But if you do not finish these things,  you can always get a to go and bring it home for a min-night snack.  And it'll be just as good when you microwave it!"
Jannat B.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",1,73,,4.0,11/12/2009,"i don't know if the management changed, but service has improved considerably!  thank god!"
Andy N.,"Brooklyn, NY",110,30,,5.0,1/5/2012,such a good spot..servings are gigantic at the price and the food is pretty good the wait is horrendous but worth it. tex mex eggrolls are amazing and the buffalo wings are so good. chipotle chicken pasta is my personal favorite. the regular drinks are big and refills on soda's.
Renee K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,72,,5.0,11/10/2007,"wow I love this place, their salads are amazing, they are so good. Their bread is fantastic, warm and yummy oOo it was so good it was sooo embarassing but I had to ask an waitress to bring me some more. Atmosphere is great for family gatherings, night out with friends, or romantic but casual dinner with your boy/girlfriend. Prices are very cheap, considering its food quality, service and atmosphere.It's truly a bargain. Of course, their cheesecakes are a killer. Waitors waitresses are very friendly and nice. Try chicken burger, it was the best chicken burger I ever had. it was so juicy and tender my mouth is watering now...."
