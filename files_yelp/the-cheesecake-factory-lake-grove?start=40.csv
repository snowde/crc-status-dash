Kevin H.,"Smithtown, NY",0,1,,2.0,11/11/2017,Food took forever and the waiter was treating us like children. Sorry to say I was not happy
Amanda H.,"Coram, NY",92,3,,5.0,8/26/2017,Love this place!!! Everything I've ever tried I love. Service was great as well. Just went there for dinner tonight and got the habachi steak... would definitely recommend!! Will be going back again soon.
Murali V.,"Ann Arbor, MI",77,282,623,5.0,12/4/2016,"I think Cheesecake Factory is a great place to have a local, casual date-night. My girlfriend and I have visited a few times, and have never been disappointed. The interior is clean, warmly lit, and has a mixture of private booths and paired tables. Additionally, the outdoor seating is ample and comfortable. The service is always well-dressed and professional, and strikes a healthy medium between neglect and overbearing. The food portions aren't traditional family-style, but tend to be a little larger than you'd expect. I've ordered different dishes from the pasta menu, and haven't had any negative experiences. There are also many vegetarian options, which is helpful with group-planning. Of course, the hallmark cheesecake is delightful, albeit dense. If you're going to order dessert for two (and I highly recommend you do), try splitting a slice of classic cheesecake. All in all, I'm a big fan!"
Cliff M.,"Selden, NY",1,13,3,3.0,8/18/2017,"Would have given 4 or 5 stars for the food, but have to take off for the wait to get the food. Entirely too long for drop in lunch. 1.5 hours to order and eat a hamburger. Definitely not a place to go if you are just looking for a quick lunch. Food was very good. But won't come again for lunch unless I have time to kill."
Steven B.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",0,26,1,2.0,8/16/2017,Just another corporate restaurant. Typical food and pretty expensive. But overall not bad.
Ann M.,"Commack, NY",14,24,4,5.0,2/4/2017,"I've been coming to Cheesecake for years and always have the Chicken Madeira. It is always made to perfection each time. We had the artichoke crab dip and it was delicious!!  The only issue tonight was the food coming out a little slow. Being a server I know it is not her fault. Our server was Shannon S.  She was a great server, very attentive, very professional and made sure everything was good.  She was great with delicious suggestions. I look forward to my next visit!"
Christina A.,"Commack, NY",216,32,45,4.0,12/16/2016,"This is a great Cheesecake Factory location! My mom and I went for happy hour and our waitress (Christy?) was very friendly and helpful. For appetizers, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms and crab bites - both were delicious! For dinner, we both ordered the lemon garlic shrimp. It was on the Skinnylicious menu, so the portion was on the smaller side, but it was very good! The shrimp (there were 4) were big and the sauce was tasty."
Carolann B.,"Patchogue, NY",39,15,,2.0,4/5/2017,"Food was good, service sucked. probably won't be back sadly since I do enjoy the cheesecake! but my waitress was just horrible. we waited 30 minutes for her to come take our order, then she went missing for 20 minutes after she handed us the check. We asked the hostess if we can have someone help us find our waitress and her response is ""sorry I'm leaving soon."" ridiculous. not only was the waitress horrible, but the hostess was too!"
Alberto C.,"Lake Ronkonkoma, NY",0,2,,2.0,7/30/2017,"Since the Management changed the food takes for ever, even when the restaurant is not busy. Having second thoughts about returning. It's a shame."
Nicole C.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",2,13,1,1.0,6/3/2017,Shame on the management. I was put on hold two separate times 16 minutes each to receive an answer that they refuse to accomodate my family who just lost our grandmother. Horrible costumer service. Shame on cheese cake factory
Marie L.,"New York, NY",343,256,1268,3.0,2/14/2016,"Visited on 2/14/16. It was very busy at 3:45ish. Our party of four waited for a booth for about 40 minutes. Our server (forgot her name) was very friendly, was on top of giving is constant refills, always came to check on us, and offered advice on menu items.  Portabella, avocado and zucchini sticks (appetizer): these were delish but you can't really go wrong with fried sticks of goodness. I like the two dipping sauces as well. I'd order this app again.  Thai lettuce cups: LOVE this! Chicken, lettuce, three sauces, pickled cucumbers, cilantro, carrots, sprouts, noodles. You build your own with the items provided. This appetizer is big enough for a lunch. It's flavorful and plentiful. I order this often.  Orange chicken with brown rice: Ehh, wouldn't order again. The chicken was overcooked, dried out, the sauce either evaporated or was very minimal to begin with bc it was non existent. I liked the snow peas and that's about it. I really should have sent this dish back. Thumbs down.  Children's menu: Corn dogs with a side of fruit salad. My 4 year old niece enjoyed this dish. The corn dogs (3) were big, nicely breaded, crispy but also a bit soft. They looked good! Fruit salad was chopped up, perfect for a little mouth! Farfalle pasta: Bow tie pasta with chicken, roasted tomatoes and garlic, peas, pancetta in a roasted garlic Parmesan sauce. Decent dish but maybe a bit too garlic flavored. Lots of sauce, and it's a large portion.  Bistro Shrimp pasta: creamy, lemony, lightly garlic sauce with shrimp, arugula and mushrooms. We liked this pasta more than the Farfalle.  Key lime cheesecake: if you like key lime pie you'll enjoy this cheesecake. Delicious!  Children's menu dessert: choice of strawberries and cream, vanilla or chocolate ice cream."
Nina C.,"Central Islip, NY",143,379,773,3.0,2/13/2016,"The food is great, as always.  But look at my picture.  So DISGUSTING.  This is what was on our silverware."
Sarita P.,"Long Island, NY",49,117,83,3.0,8/28/2016,"I typically love coming here, the food is great and the atmosphere is too. Unfortunately the temperature at this restaurant is always freezing! Came here last night and the AC was blasting so hard I had to use the dinner napkin as a shawl. I'd review my food but I was unable to concentrate on anything but possibly catching a cold. This location deserves at least 4 stars but I have to knock 1 off for the ridiculous temperature in this establishment, somebody needs to adjust the thermometer asap."
Peter M.,"Queens, NY",62,13,,5.0,6/17/2017,Went here with my mother for dinner. Waitresses were very courteous and polite. Food was good but on the pricer side as you would expect. Overall positive experience but the wait staff could've given us more attention
Zain S.,"Mastic, NY",2,29,5,5.0,6/6/2017,"Love love love The Cheesecake Factory! Even though I eat there once a blue moon, I usually get there Factory burrito. Let me tell you, if you're a big eater like I am, you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. And oh how can I forget about the Buffalo Blasts.. omg those are delicious, little crispy chicken tenders drenched in Buffalo sauce. This place is amazing and I love the complimentary bread they serve."
Chris M.,"Smithtown, NY",1,4,,2.0,9/10/2017,"The first time I came here about a year ago I really enjoyed it. Every time since then hasn't been great. I've been about 10 times since then and this past time will be my last. Every time I go my order is incorrect when they bring it to me. This is the same for others who I go with. They don't listen to things you want to change on the item you are ordering, such as no cheese or no pickles. I don't know if it's the wait staff or the kitchen, but they haven't been getting it right. I just assume when I go that they are going to get it wrong and I'll have to send it back. The food also just hasn't been that great tasting (over seasoned or missing parts of meal that are in description in menu). I'd probably give the food 3 stars, but the fact they mess up the orders makes me have to give them 2."
Jaclyn G.,"Nesconset, NY",0,7,22,2.0,9/17/2017,Got an ok cookie cake from here . Wasn't that great it was pb chip didn't really taste like pb and the bite me one is m&m which was a bit better then the pb one but for 12$ it's just ok
Sameer A.,"Nesconset, NY",9,1,,1.0,5/9/2017,"Wasn't greeted 10 minutes after sitting down. Went to the manager, complained and asked to be seated at a different location. After sitting down, wasn't greeted after 5 minutes. Terrible service."
Mary Ellen J.,"Moriches, NY",0,14,1,5.0,3/22/2017,Wednesday.  Mushroom soup. To die for!  I have never had a bad meal here!  Can hardly wait to go back!
Lauren D.,"Glassboro, NJ",9,5,,2.0,8/21/2017,"This I the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. It is so dark, you can't see the menu, food, or each other we used our phones to look at our food. Our appetizer was calamari which was cooked great except the breeding. It was so salty, you could only have one or two without taking a gulp of your drink.  My mom's food was suppose to have cheese and it was so melted it was translucent. The overall experience here was so disappointing. It was our last family meal until thanksgiving since my sister just moved into Stonybrook University and we live in Ocean City NJ...4 hours away. We chose cheesecake for its food choices and family atmosphere and it was overall disappointing. Never going to this one ever again."
