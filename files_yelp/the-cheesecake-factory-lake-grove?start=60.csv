Elsa B.,"Centereach, NY",2,6,,1.0,8/31/2017,"If you enjoy eating cardboard and paying high prices go to the cheesecake factory. Food is very overpriced, quality is ok, service is terrible."
Margaret B.,"Selden, NY",12,2,,1.0,10/8/2016,Had a drink at the bar and was seated within 20 minutes   The rest of the night was horrible.  The worst service I have ever received in a restaurat   Will never eat there again
Carl M.,"Bellport, NY",95,31,49,2.0,7/11/2016,"This was my first time eating at this restaurant. The decor was very nice and clean. I ordered chicken marsala but I found the noodles to be undercooked. Our waiter was average, in my opinion he could have checked on us a bit more. I also had the cheesecakr which was well presented but just average in my book. Overall, decent meal but I wouldnt recommend it to many people."
Todd U.,"Selden, NY",155,160,73,4.0,9/23/2015,"Brendan was our sever tonight and he recommended a mix dish to me.  Not only was it good, his service was beyond measure!  The food could have sucked and I would return just because of his service!  Thank you Brendan for such a great dinner and service!!!"
Lynette C.,"Port Jefferson, NY",8,66,3,3.0,7/24/2016,This place gets VERY busy since it's located right at the mall. Choose your times wisely. Otherwise it's very loud and you're cramped in like sardines. Food was good. Cheesecakes are always amazingly delicious.
Harry G.,"Holtsville, NY",362,61,24,4.0,12/20/2016,We stop here whenever we're at the mall shopping. They have a good skinny licous menu that is good when watching your calorie in take. Reasonable prices good service and decent food. Gets it a 4 star review.
Joseph S.,"Mount Sinai, NY",1,32,1,2.0,4/16/2016,"I've eaten here before, food is standard fare for Cheesecake Factory. Came in after shopping for a drink and to hopefully catch some of a local sports game. If you ever have the same idea, don't waste your time. The bartender was clueless. ""We don't have remotes, do you know what channel?"" I told her the station, but I don't have DirectTV so I don't know the actual channel number. ""Well, I need the actual channel number,"" followed by a dirty look. At this point, I get up to leave and she she says ""We're definitely not a sports bar so I don't know why you came here.""  Really? Didn't bother responding, just shook my head and left. Might come back and grab some cheesecake to go, but that's it. I'm done here."
Sara C.,"Denver, CO",195,37,23,3.0,3/7/2017,"Gone three times recently. Lovely looking place but realized how dirty once I was sat. First time I went, hostess was rude and someone came around and literally THREW silverware onto our table. It was very bizarre. Food was good. Second time the waiter charged me $10 more than the bill and thought I wouldn't notice. The receipt said $10 less than my bank notification did. I had to ask him to fix it. Food was good. Third time I went I got food to go, paid for a sandwich and side-only got a sandwich. Not really fair. I've gotten the turkey club each time and it's been great each time. Family and friends enjoy their ceaser salad. Service is lacking."
Erik D.,"Medford, NY",229,131,20,4.0,10/29/2015,"I had taken my friend out to dinner for her birthday here just last night. We both had a wonderful time. She ordered some Blood Orange Martini that honestly did taste really good, garnished with a little sliver of orange peel. I went with a Stella 16oz. They do offer ""tall"" glasses that are the 22oz I believe he said. Our waiter was hysterical. Very friendly! Actually spoke to us like he knew us forever which I found very comical. We were ordering food, and we both were indecisive on two dishes. He kindly explained them both and then gave us his opinion.  I ordered the CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA it's Shrimp and Chicken Sautéed with Onions, Tomato and Peppers in a Very Spicy Cajun Sauce. All on Top of Fresh Linguini. Apparently it's available over Rice as well. However it's like Regular & Spinach linguini, TRUST ME it was delicious. (Of course I took the tomatoes out haha... Typical me). After the entree I ordered the banana cream cheesecake. I honestly usually go for the Reece's peanut butter cup one, but I figured for the sake of you Yelpers, I'd pull an audible and try something different. Needless to say. It was still just as sinful as most of the other cheesecakes they have there! I also was able to taste the Dulce De Leche cheesecake as well. Also very well crafted. One thing that always throws me off, I guess because I never asked... But why does the decor remind me so much of Aladdin? Like. It's tastefully done don't get me wrong, but what's the story about it? All in all, very pleased with this establishment. It's always a pleasure visiting Agrabah! I highly suggest visiting this Cheesecake Factory."
Eva B.,"Selden, NY",108,88,88,4.0,3/31/2016,"Before you start reading this review as a super positive post, there are a few things you need to know first before just looking at four stars. The Cheesecake Factory in my mind used to mean high end, fancy, top of the line cuisine.  Ok that might have been my 13 year old mind, now, not so much.  But it still gives off the feel of that decorative, nice place to eat.  The menu has options for everyone and the food is always great, it's almost always really hard to choose what to get.  Ok, it's The Cheesecake Factory and everyone knows what it's like unless you live under a rock. This last visit in particular, it was a Wednesday night just before 7 PM.  We get seated within 5 minutes, we just sat and sat and sat for almost 20 minutes.  No one acknowledged us, no one said ""be right with you.""  It was not busy.  There were three waitresses in the area and not one could say, ""has anyone helped you yet?""  So my boyfriend (he NEVER asks to talk to the manager because he doesn't like confrontation) started to cross his arms and sit there with a look on his face.  You know he meant business... [ha ha]  I am someone that really believes that if you are going to work in a job where you have to have a fake smile on your face, you better show those pearly whites and give at least decent service.  I have worked in service jobs and I know it can be frustrating but if that's not something you're about, get a new job where you stare at a wall.  We decided to get up and leave, we told the hosts that they can reset the table because we would not be dining here.  It's like we were suddenly not invisible anymore. The hosts grabbed the manager right away (his name is Gary to be exact) and insisted that we got something out of this because of how unacceptable this is.  He said we would be taken care of and all that manager talk to get your business. We still sat there for another 5ish minutes and the guy cleaning off the tables was more concerned with our happiness than any of the waitresses.  He took our drink order and brought it over to us before our waitress (her name is Unique) even came over. If I were Unique, I would do everything I can to make sure the customers who were just about to leave, have a good experience.  She didn't seem friendly, didn't seem to care that we were getting even more pissed off by her not caring...  We got our food.  He got salmon with broccoli and I got the basil, tomato and mozzarella flatbread.  It was pretty good.  I'm glad the food wasn't rushed and thrown on a plate. At the end of our dinner, Gary [the manager] came over and surprised us.  He said he was taking care of the bill because that should never happen.  We thought we would get the appetizer or something but Gary really went out of his way to turn our night around.  Managers like Gary are hard to come by, he was really awesome."
Michael M.,"Coram, NY",19,14,,5.0,2/15/2017,Way better than Friday's or any other fast food restaurant like that ..its in a league of its own the menu is huge something for everyone we always leave full .. the prices are great and the service is fast i am definitely a frequent flyer here
George W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,29,,1.0,1/2/2017,"Really disappointed. We had to wait 40 minutes at 4pm and then were treated to an unpleasant experience: Our waiter James was very inattentive, not friendly and slow. When he got the order for a side wrong he didn't apologize but said he would correct it in 30 seconds - which took 15 minutes with us reminding him. Of course it was cold by then. We also had to ask other waiters for water refills and steak knives.  The food sadly was also only mediocre with some of the steak medallions being chewy and the asparagus hard and woody.  We won't come back."
Nicole J.,"New York, NY",44,25,,5.0,1/14/2017,"For the most part this review is about take out. During flu season I typically try to steer clear of public restaurants. Doesn't stop me from ordering takeout. This is the 2nd time I have ordered and I have to say that with some changes I had to make to my entrees they got it 100% right. It is rare, but Sooooooo appreciated.  The food was fresh. Very good as usual and I would definitely recommend them for take out as well as dining in. I had the eggplant parm and subbed out regular angel for the pesto pasta that was on the menu. It was delicious. The other item was a chicken dish with lemon couscous, I believe...and I was told it was delicious. Great job cheesecake factory...I'll be back!!!"
Jift M.,"Cortland, NY",0,13,1,1.0,4/4/2017,"I can't believe how rude this woman was behind the cake counter. This was my first time there and my cake was boxed and tucked behind a sign, after waiting a couple minutes I asked the blonde girl who showed up behind the counter , she is not the one who took my order, if it was mine and she said ""well did you order a tower?"" I said I don't know, because as I said this was my first time and I didn't know the  vernacular of Cheesecake Factory, in my head I ordered a slice of chocolate cake. Then she says ""Well this isn't yours then is it?"" I was kind of taken aback by her attitude which she then informed myself and the two people that were with me that she ""doesn't have an attitude, I don't even work up here, I don't know what's going on, I'm too high to do this right now!"" I just wanted a slice of cake for my birthday and it was an inconvience to this cun t of a staff member. This was THE WORST customer service experience I've ever seen in my life and I work in a restaurant, granted it's way more upscale than cheese cake factory. This happened on April 2nd 2017 at approximately 2:30 pm, so if you need to look at the schedule and figure out who was working the cake counter so you can promptly fire this person, I can't believe she said she was high on drugs! What was happening here?! I ate my cake outside and couldn't  find a garbage can, so I went inside and threw it in on the counter, hope she could figure out how to use a receptacle and throw it away."
Amanda P.,"Holbrook, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/13/2017,"One of the worst experiences I have ever had going out to  lunch. Went out with my husband and from the start my server took over 5 minutes to greet us, and our drinks took another 7. We had asked for waters which our server forgot, to say which she never refilled. I could see our server talking to other staff members as my husband and I waited over 45 minutes for our entrees and with no drinks. This girl was terrible, i mean TERRIBLE.  When food did come out ( not at the same time) it was wrong but at this time we ate because we were starving. Our server never apologized, Jessica M was our server & we will never go back again !! It takes 1 second to pass by and acknowledge   your tables, instead of talking to fellow servers and never apologizing.  Horrible!"
George I.,"New York, NY",8,2,,5.0,11/2/2016,"I rarely add reviews but this place deserves a review! Excellent service, steak diane was extremely perfect and desserts are their specialty!"
Cheryl K.,"Parkland, FL",328,447,513,2.0,11/1/2014,"Um, Cheesecake factory, you're going downhill. At least here in this busy Long Island mall. As always, the food is pretty tasty and consistent, albeit giant portions and calories at 1500 minimum for a dinner (yes, in NY the law is to put the calories on the menu - that really brings me down). I don't know many people who could eat the entire dinner portion they serve EVER so perhaps you should make them half the size, half the calories? (I know then you'd have to lower your prices). OK enough of my preaching. Back to the food - I had bang bang chicken and shrimp - it was really good - not too spicy - had a peanut butter/thai type of curry thing going on. My husband had a mini plate - the sliders. They were average. My friend had a burrito that was the size of my forearm - of course he only ate about half. He said it was good. I've had other dishes during other visits to CF in different cities - my favorite is probably the Vietmanese Spring Summer Rolls - they're not fried, served chilled filled with chilled shrimp and noodles, bean sprouts and green herbs (my guess is basil and cilantro) and they come with a creamy peanut dipping sauce. I've also had their salads - all great. Soups are overly salty.  The real treat here is of course, their cheesecake, which is always amazingly good and is served with fresh whipped cream. Hubby and I got a slice to go and shared it at home later. (again, calories on the menu killed my dessert dreams). The service at this location is HORRENDOUS. We arrived on a Friday at about 5:45 so were seated right away before the big lines that this place is notorious for. And if they turned their tables efficiently, my guess is, those lines would move much quicker. We had to ask our server for water at least 3 times and finally had to grab a waitress who wasn't even ours to get us water. He missed out on a third round of drinks because he just disappeared. It took us about 2 1/2 hours for a meal that should've taken 1 1/2 max really.  I probably wont come back to this location - lots of other options in the area."
Spyros K.,"Coram, NY",3,16,,2.0,6/1/2016,"Arrived about 2:00 on Monday and there was about 20 people waiting.  I was a little shocked to see people waiting at 2:00 o'clock when I looked over to the dining room and saw an entire section of about 20 tables empty.  I couldn't believe they had people waiting instead of seating people at those tables.  I thought maybe they were reserved for a large group?  Nope, there were people being seated their when we were leaving.   I guess having people wait is good for business???  We'll since I Hate having my time wasted, I will not be returning.  Good luck with your arrogance, there's a laundry list of closed businesses who faith you'll soon share."
Rory G.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",36,61,73,3.0,11/23/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is a pretty sweet joint! While I don't think I have ever been here without having to wait for a seat, the food is still really good! I love how the menu has a great variety; from meats, to salads, seafood, Mexican, etc! Personally, my favorite appetizer to order are the buffalo wings. They are pretty spicy but also crunchy, which is rare yet tasty in wings! The mini corn dogs aren't bad either. As for my main meal, I often order chicken sliders or a big bowl of mac and cheese. I would recommend the chicken sliders over the mac and cheese, because sometimes, it just doesn't have enough cheese! My favorite part is the dessert; I always get the Oreo milkshake. It is very unhealthy, yet so good! My one negative here has to be the service. Last night, I waited until I was almost done eating my appetizer before I was given utensils and a napkin. Also, the food came out rather slowly. Still, this was an overall positive experience, but it depends on what you order and how fast the service it!"
Alex P.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,4,35,5.0,9/6/2016,Service has always been great in my experiences here.  Great place to meet with friends for decent food and drinks.  They have a very extensive menu and of course you need to try the cheesecake when your here.
