Denise G.,"Providence, RI",16,76,52,3.0,11/1/2015,"I am not a chair food fan, but a Cheesecake Factory opened by my father's home and he was dying to try it... so I played the obliging daughter. To be honest, the first thing I wanted to do when we walked in the door, was to run back outside!  There was a frenetic, chaotic vibe that would make the most zen individual want to take an anti-anxiety pill.  The ""front desk""/ hostess station was a mess.  First off it was so loud that no one could hear each other. Secondly, It appeared to be run by 15 yo's who have never been taught anything about customer services.  They were frazzled, not helpful at all, and added to the overall chaos.  And unfortunately, we had to wait in this level of hell for almost 30 min. Front area: 1 star. However, once we actually got a seat, we had a pretty good experience.  Have to give CF kudos for having a significant amount of really good ""lite"" entrees... smaller portions of yummy stuff, and healthy alternatives.  Our waitress was lovely and helpful; and the food was pretty good.  Their drinks were interesting but a bit light on the booze. (Which I really needed at that point in the evening!) The dining experience overall was probably a 4 star.  However the initial ""factory"" greeting we got left such a bad taste, I had to drop the review a star."
Master Of Videos 3.,"Mastic, NY",13,26,13,5.0,8/10/2016,Good food great service and delishous deserts if they only had more food items and the employees wouldnt be on the phones where everyone can see them on the phone
Annette V.,"Staten Island, NY",0,31,,4.0,9/27/2016,We've been here several times and both the food and service have been good.  The ambiance is nice and comfortable.  It's a nice place for people of all ages.
Michelle L.,"Lake Grove, NY",2,14,,4.0,11/11/2015,"Just went last night for dinner with my fiancé. We started the meal off with some cocktails. I got the classic margarita and he got a bourbon and honey. You can't go wrong with a good margarita on the rocks with salt. He thought the thyme sprig in the bourbon drink was a bit overpowering, but still very tasty. We split the crispy crab bites as an appetizer off of the skinnylicious menu. They were so good!! Bite size crab cakes that were crispy on the outside and lusciously creamy on the inside. Wish we each got our own order because after 10 seconds, they were gone! For dinner, I got the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread off of the skinnylicious menu. Great mix of sweet pear, peppery arugula, and crunchy pecans. He got the chicken bellagio and enjoyed that very much. The fresh arugula was what made the dish for him. I thought it was a bit too heavy, but still tasty. Too full for dessert, but the Godiva chocolate cheesecake is always amazing. 4.5 stars for the Cheesecake Factory!"
Rohan B.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",7,105,131,4.0,3/18/2016,"Been going here for a few years, the food is good, but the prices are a little high. The servers can be rood, and the service used to be very sliw, but they have made it very fast."
Wizzy L.,"St. James, NY",17,10,4,4.0,9/13/2016,"Good food!! Good service... but their namesake, Cheesecake, does not live up to the name. Also, with all the empty tables they  myself & my handicapped father as far away from the door as they can."
Aaswad S.,"Paradise Valley, AZ",438,43,5,4.0,1/22/2016,Who doesn't like cheesecake? And if not here where else? Awesome cheesecakes! Have been having loads of cheesecakes from here. But I don't like the food as much here tho! Chicken Samosa is pretty good here!
Mike G.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",59,59,5,4.0,7/29/2016,Always busy so we sat outside for speed. The service outside suffers.  But again the food was excellent. We had a variety of dishes and each one was just right. My Cobb salad was just right with no hint of bag salad taste. Will go back again. We like!!
Andrew C.,"St. James, NY",3,14,8,1.0,7/28/2017,"Came here with my parents and brother for my sister's birthday on July 28 at about 3. The restaurant was virtually empty. We were seated promptly, and our orders were taken quickly, but things greatly deteriorated from there: all of our entrees were fine, but the service ruined them. Our waitress brought three of the meals and said she would be right back with the other two (a burger and a chicken sandwich with fries, nothing complex), but ten minutes later, we were still waiting. The sandwiches did come after about 15 minutes, but without the fries! Now, everyone was antsy, and we just could not enjoy our meals. After five more minutes--20 minutes since the first three meals were brought out!--the fries still hadn't come, and we asked for a manager; the waitress gave us a dirty look when we made this request. The manager took the two delayed meals off the bill, but this does not make up for the poor service. Bad service always negates good food, and, unfortunately, such was the case today."
Ken N.,"Smithtown, NY",0,6,,5.0,3/1/2017,"So YUMMY!!! Yes, it'll be a long wait on a friday or saturday night but what do you expect? It's good food! Obviously the cheesecakes here are amazing. My favorite is the red velvet but don't overlook the vanilla bean which is, of course, often overlooked."
Alexa C.,"Holtsville, NY",0,5,,3.0,2/28/2017,Hate to be that person but was just so annoyed by the end of my dinner. The food was good but Our server was so unpleasant. I think her name was Joanne. She just wasn't a genuine person. My friend didn't like his meal and they were out of a cheesecake my boyfriend wanted and she was like yeah sorry. Both me and my friend are a server/manager at restaurants so we know what it's like to be that annoying guest. (Which we were avoiding) just goes to show how much service makes or breaks an experience.
Karen D.,"Middle Island, NY",0,25,20,5.0,2/29/2016,"This is by far one of my favorite dinner spots to go to. The variety of foods to select from are a bit overwhelming but so incredible. You can have anything from sandwiches to salads to pizzas to apps to a skinny delicious (lower calorie items) choice of food.  The cheesecake is unbelievable here, putting all calorie count to the side, it is by far the best cheesecake in the world. The service staff are friendly and on top of everything. I've never had a bad experience here. Highly recommend this for special occasions and for casual date nights.  The wait time can be a bit long depending on when you go and they usually don't take reservations. Overall very happy"
Francisco C.,"Morris Heights, Bronx, NY",39,28,35,1.0,6/21/2016,Worst service ever! Waitress was the worst ever didn't seem to pay any attention to us that's why I didn't leave a tip
Frankie N.,"Massapequa, NY",118,11,1,4.0,9/7/2016,"Well, let just say cheese cake is my favorite dessert and I am not a dessert person. Family dinner was very enjoyable and the service was great. Had to get a few thing before my flight so it being next to the mall was amazing!"
Andrea C.,"Huntington Station, NY",72,45,82,3.0,6/27/2014,"Date of visit: 06/15/2014 Not new to Cheesecake factory I know their portions are huge. I also know their menu is massive. It's been a while since I've been here so their new SkinnyLicious menu was a pleasant surprise.  We stuck with the SkinnyLicious menu and ordered the Arugula salad,  Santorini Farro Salad, and Roasted Pear & Blue Cheese Flatbread. A Pineapple mojito which was not SkinnyLicious. Although they do offer some cocktails prepared Skinny-Style. Food and service was good. I also ordered a Godiva® Chocolate Cheesecake to go from the To Go area. Boy was I shocked at the amount of calories in 1 slice. Good thing I'm not big on desserts and this wasn't for me. I was also a little surprised at the $9/slice price."
Gary L.,"Woodside, NY",1077,1124,4992,3.0,9/3/2012,"I made a trip out to Stony Brook on Friday and some friends decided to treat me for dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. I've been to this one before and from what I saw, business has dropped dramatically on a Friday. I remembered waiting over 30 minutes for a table and holding on to their pagers. Today, there's no need for pagers or reservations. Cheesecake factory was half empty. Food - I ordered a Cajun Burger with fries. It had some peppers and sausages. The burger itself was pretty juicy but overall, nothing spectacular. The meal was over thousand calories so I decided not to order an appetizer since they already serve free bread w/butter. My friends ordered some pasta, it was very heavy, greasy, and well over a thousand calories too. Drinks - I wanted to order a beer but the waitress informed me about the price so I said fuggedaboutit. My friend had a strawberry daiquiri which was alright. She complained that there was too much alcohol but I disagreed. She has a really low tolerance. The daiquiri was well made and the strawberry flavor was fine.  Service - Friendly and quick. Verdict - To avoid high calorie dishes, you can try their skinnylicious menu. There is no more wait time. A slice of any of flavor cheesecake is over 500 calories. Burger prices are fair, everything else on the menu is a rip off. I gave it 3 stars because of it's cleanliness and customer service. The burger could be better and the pastas are just too heavy and greasy. Alcoholic beverages are too expensive. It can easily make a 50 dollar check turn into a 80-100 dollar check. If I was still a student in Stony Brook University, I would take my money elsewhere."
Jung L.,"New York, NY",3,30,,1.0,8/11/2016,I would give ZERO STAR if I could !!! The hostess was nasty !!! They need to hire someone with a personality and someone who LIKES to work with the public !!!  The server was super friendly at least.
Sean H.,"Stony Brook, NY",70,17,,3.0,12/26/2016,"open late, has a wide variety of foods ranging from salads, burgers, and pastas. haven't tried the entire gambit, but the ambiance is great. it's one of the better restaurant chains around."
Nancy S.,"Smithtown, NY",99,30,,4.0,6/22/2017,"We have eaten at the Lake Grove location many times since it opened and it is very consistent in good food quality.  Our last visit we had a superstar waiter, which is not always the case.  not saying the servers are bad, they just can be a bit rushed and almost disinterested in connecting with their tipping customers.  I've also had waiters who were slow and forgetful....even when it wasn't so busy.  I have walked up to the podium with only a couple of people waiting and been totally ignored by the hostess right in front of me while they talked among themselves, not even a smile and I often feel like a 10 minute wait is not necessary because there are open tables in what is obviously an open section.   Now, the FOOD?  Yummy!  I am not a very adventurous eater, but can always find something that suits my bland palate and makes me very happy.  Many years ago, they turned me on to cheesecake, I hate them for this, and now, I am 100 pounds heavier and addicted.  They have such wonderful flavors!!  Decadent.  So, I am not always impressed with the service, but the food is worth putting up with that imperfection."
Leslie L.,"Saint James, NY",0,6,,1.0,12/19/2016,Burgers were great but table and silverware was very dirty.  Used  dirty ketchup cup was served with the burger.  So surprised....i
