Helen H.,"Corona, CA",136,8,20,4.0,12/27/2017,Superb food  Their cheese always taste amazing  And cheesecake never let me down One less star for the service is soooo slow!!
Priscilla Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",105,494,1708,3.0,12/30/2017,"it was an extremely long wit for a seat here at lunch (it always is) but their food is large portioned, decently priced and classic american fare. My friends LOVE their pasta and were happy with their creamy choices while my chicken tacos were good, but not amazing. The avocado was brown and the shells broke with the amount of salsa they put at the BOTTOM of the tacos... Service was also extremely slow and we were hardly attended to but the tiramisu cheesecake is probably my new favourite! Not too heavy, plenty of cake and coffee flavour too!"
Komatsu O.,"Las Vegas, NV",143,52,66,5.0,12/26/2017,Always a 5 star experience no matter which one we go to. On a Friday night before Christmas it was a bit busy and we did have to wait over an hour which is longer then usual.  The server was very friendly and helpful for our large party.  The menu is huge but everything I order I end up loving.  THe fish and chips were so crispy and juicy! Th fish tacos had so much flavor. I try a new cheesecake every time and this time it was the Hershey Chocolate one. Wow! A mouthful of chocolate in all its forms and cheesecake! I was in heaven!
Amy E.,"Las Vegas, NV",43,134,87,1.0,11/14/2017,"We came here for lunch and sat at a table in the bar area. Our server came over and took our drink orders rather promptly.  The menu is huge, so it took us a few minutes. And it doesn't have photos anymore so I was looking on my phone to get a better idea of what I was going to eat. I ordered a lunch portion of the chicken, mango and avocado salad without wonton and skinny pomegranate dressing on the side. JD ordered the sandwich, soup and salad lunch combo. My salad arrived and looked so sad. The chicken beast it's self was flat. It wasn't plump and juicy. It looked like it had been sitting in a freezer with a 100 lb weight on it. See photos. There was hardly any avocado- maybe 1/4 of one. No almonds to be found. The fruit was definitely not fresh. I was able to squish it so easily with a fork. It had been sitting in a can. You can always tell the difference between fresh, frozen and canned fruit. Nice try with trying to pull a fast one though. When we told our server what was wrong, she made me feel that this was somehow my fault- as did the manager. I'm sorry I didn't want crispy wontons on my salad and that I subbed dressings. It felt like that was what started this whole issue.  They comped the salad, we canceled the cheesecake slice we were going to share at the end of our meal because giving them more money after the way we were treated simply wasn't an option.  It's unfortunate that this is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in about 6 years and that it went so poorly. Definitely reminds me why I generally stray away from chains like this. Maybe the one at Caesars is still better...."
Lia A.,"Las Vegas, NV",591,170,271,5.0,12/25/2017,"Love this restaurant! Think of a restaurant that has a little bit of everything to please every member of your party, and ending the night with a delicious slice of cheesecake. They also have amazing free bread they give out as well. This location is located in the north outlet mall. If you can find where the street ""symphony"" is at the mall, that is where the restaurant is located. Parking garage is located right across the street and parking is FREE! Woohoo. Great place for a date night or any kind of meal. They have a huge menu offering a lot of different stuff, and a huge cheesecake menu!"
Anny D.,"Claremont, CA",13,105,21,4.0,12/29/2017,"One thing to rely on when visiting chains, food tastes the same. Always get my usual and a nice cheesecake to finish. What makes this one any different? Customer service! He was very patient with my kiddos. Even after a spill, he was still all smiles and very attentive to our requests. Menu choices: chicken madeira, crusted chicken Romano, pasta carbonara, pumpkin swirl cheesecake. All great!!"
Hunida N.,"Las Vegas, NV",145,57,250,2.0,8/11/2017,"Ok, mostly I'm upset because maybe I'm dumb but I thought that ""Shrimp Scampi"" meant noodles, shrimp, and cream sauce. But I ordered a Factory Combo for $22.95 which I thought was a great deal for the Herb Crusted Salmon, Mashed Potatoes, and a Shrimp Scampi... the kind with the noodles. This should have been called ""Breaded Shrimp and Cream Sauce.""  Anyways the mashed potatoes were good but I wanted gravy. The Herb Crusted Salmon was alright. I didn't really like the crust, a bit too bitter for my taste. The breaded shrimp was good and the cream sauce was fine. I really hated the sauce that came underneath my salmon and asparagus, I'm so very glad that they put the asparagus between my salmon and the sauce so that it wasn't already touching and I was able to save it. I love asparagus and mine were ruined. :( My boyfriend ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger, it was fine. He asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was quite well done.  We ordered Chicken Samosas for our appetizer and I thought the cilantro dipping sauce was quite wonderful. I thought the samosas were pretty good. The star of the show was...  The complimentary wheat bread!! Omg. It was soooo amazing. It was so warm, nice and toasty... it melted in my mouth, no butter neeeded. It was sweet and just so so amazing. I ate one whole piece and half of the second piece. I wanted to eat it all but of course I had to share, lol and I didn't want to ruin my appetite! Of cooourse we had to order a cheesecake since we were at The CHEESECAKE Factory! There were so many to choose from I wanted to try em all but we both only had enough room in our bellies to only share one!  After a long time of trying to decide we chose the Turtle Pecan Cheesecake, it had a yummy brownie crust but not enough pecans. We took off the big chocolate mousse thing, it was better without it. We needed to check out Cheesecake Factory since everyone loves this place but we just weren't really big fans! The food was just mediocre at best and the service was slooooow."
Ciara R.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,101,137,4.0,8/31/2017,The food is good as usual.  Service was great.  The only thing I noticed is that the portion of my chicken medeira was small haha That Georgia peach drink was amazing though!
Soleil K.,"Olympia Fields, IL",110,209,705,3.0,8/5/2017,Came here July 30 for the half price per slice NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY. Waited a long time to be seated. They told us 10-15 mins. Ended up being like 45 mins. Had to ask if our name was being called next only to find out they skipped over our name. The manager made us the next call after that was acknowledged.  We were seated. Our waitor was extremely busy. He was nice but not much customer service. We ordered tex mex egg rolls for appetizers. Pasta for entrees. And cheesecake for dessert.  Unfortunately both our pasta dishes were at maximum luke warm. The best part of the dinner was the appetizer and dessert.
Caitlin W.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,1,,2.0,1/9/2018,"One of my favorite places, but last night I was very disappointed. Our server didn't greet herself so I don't even know her name, but we had found hair in our food so of course we asked for our server and she simply said ""Oh I'm sorry"" did not get the manager or anything to fix the problem. I'm usually very easy going but seriously the customer service was TERRIBLE last night especially for how nice the restaurant is supposed to be for the price. Definitely won't be returning."
Corrina R.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,180,768,1.0,7/23/2017,"This is an ultimate failure for a cheesecake factory.  When we arrive we didn't have to wait long, so that was pleasant.  Once they called my name to seat us knowing full well we have a small child and need a menu for him they didn't bring one.  They station us in a back area from the main dinning area. I didn't care so much about that, we did have to walk outside to go back inside to be seated.   Once we are seated and given our menus I realize we didn't get a kids menu and I asked for one.  The hostess never brought us one so we ended up having to ask the waitress what was available for children. This was after we had already sat at the table 15 minutes before we were even greeted by our waitress; who was overwhelmed.    We figure out what my son wants, we order drinks and food. We are asked if we want bread and we say yes. Then our waitress was off, we order water, sprite and a mojito.  We get our water and sprite about five minutes later and about fifteen minutes after that they bring my food and my husbands. I set timer and they bring my sons plate out, over five minutes later.   When I was done with my meal they finally bring my mojito (mind you, after I ordered it I said I'd walk back over and get it because it is pretty far from our seating area). They never did bring us bread and we never did see out waitress again because someone else brought our meals and drinks.  After we were done eating it took another fifteen minutes to get our check.  This was the most awful experience ever.  Poor time management and multitasking.  I think the manager needs some updated training.  He/she is way over their heads.   Our food wasn't bad."
Nancy B.,"Las Vegas, NV",66,7,,5.0,1/6/2018,Could not believe how good my meal was - and reasonably priced.  Carly was a great waitress.  She was personable and had great information about the massive menu. I had lime-coconut chicken that was amazingly good. The banana cream cheesecake is worth saving room for!
Christy S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,54,158,3.0,10/26/2017,"I like going here for lunch. They offer many varieties and have a lot of selections for lunch specials. As big as their menu is, all the dishes I've ordered here end up tasting good. I almost always have enough leftover for dinner too. For the price and the portion you get, it's a good value. Service is decent. They can be a bit slow when they're super busy and being in the outlet, they're usually busy. However, I've never had major problems with the service. If you don't want to wait to be seated, you can seat yourself in the bar area as those seatings are on a first come first serve basis. Love their wheat bread and they will gladly give you extra if you ask. My favorite dish here is their miso salmon. They also offer great happy hour. Definitely worth checking out when you're in the area!"
Chris D.,"Bakersfield, CA",166,244,342,5.0,9/12/2017,Never had a problem with cheesecake factory they all been consistent in the same let me tell you they have many different styles of cheesecake and always are very good my favorite dish on the menu is a salmon moist sweet and flaky if you're ever around a cheesecake factory stop by and get yourself a bite to eat if you're not hungry just grab a cheesecake
Tiffany L.,"Las Vegas, NV",173,220,320,4.0,8/11/2017,"It was so nice to be able to sit down and enjoy a meal in between outlet shopping. I believe the prices are the same here and the portions are large as usual. They also have many lunch specials available here but they definitely aren't cheap. We got the lunch size bistro shrimp pasta and the Asian lettuce tacos, which were both delicious. They also have a skinny menu with lower calorie dishes available. Most of their cheesecakes are amazing and large enough to share, just depends what flavor you're in the mood for. Service was a bit slow since we went during lunch time, so I wouldn't recommend coming if you were in a rush."
May F.,"Antioch, CA",4,26,74,4.0,12/5/2017,"Second time I tried The Cheesecake Factory and this particular location wasn't that bad. I thought it would be busy since it was at an Outlet. We waited for about 5mins before we were seated. The server was very nice and attentive, place was clean and the food was delicious."
DeShawn A.,"Las Vegas, NV",232,202,209,1.0,2/20/2017,"I will NEVER go to this location as long as it's in existence!!! My sister and I frequent this location a lot! At least once or twice a month and have never had an issue until tonight!!!!  My sister arrived earlier than me and decided to to score a booth in the bar area where the hostess came and shooed her out of the booth. The hostess then proceeds to advise her that she was only allowed to sit at the bar in order to participate in happy hour even though none of the booths were occupied. I was very confused because we have sat in booths in the bar area several time and never encountered an issue.  Finally I arrive and wanted to speak to a manager because it didn't seem right and inconsistent. Well here comes Sam....whom was extremely rude to us. He wasn't interested in anything we had to say and accused us of complaining. I told him we weren't complaining and was just curious of the inconsistency and I really didn't want to sit at the bar in order to be able to order off of the happy hour menu. He then tells us to go to another restaurant like Brio so my sister then tells him ""it feels as if you don't want us here, like you're trying to get to get rid of us!"" He continued to be rid so ultimately we left and found our new favorite spot Wolf Gang Puck in Summerlin.  I called to corporate office the next day and spoke with a gentleman who took down my concern and contact information and I waited a month and still no response. I ended up calling corporate again where they issued me $20 eGift card which I ended up using at the San Francisco CCF. I will not be going back to the CCF. I don't like how they handle customers or their concerns."
Kevin L.,"Las Vegas, NV",290,220,1040,2.0,7/31/2017,"Here's a simple transaction gone stupidly wrong. A man walks into a Cheesecake Factory 30-minutes to close. The place is less than half full, so it's not busy by any measure. All this man wants is to order two slices and to go home. He stands in front of the display case, as one does, waiting to ask a question and to then place an order.  And he keeps standing there.  There's one busy bee who's pulling all the weight filling orders as the dupes roll in. She's far too preoccupied, that is clear. Then there's the other, standing at the register, pretending to be busy. She looks at me on occasion, we make eye contact, and it's clear, I need help, and she's not busy, nor is she coming over. Maybe it's not her job? Maybe she's been scolded for leaving her register? I don't know. It's not my job to know. I wait a few more minutes watching the hustle. One manager comes in and gives the busy bee an understanding kiss on the head. Odd. Neither here nor there, though. I eventually walk over to the one whose feet are stuck at the register. She asks if I need anything. Incredulous, I say yes, and a question, but is there a reason you didn't come over when you saw me standing there forever?  ""I was busy."" No. No you weren't. And your muscles could have transported you over three feet to meet a customer. Anyway, I place my order, and there's not an ounce of hospitality in her voice or actions. No civility. Cold dismissiveness. I thank her for taking my money, but she continues to stand there. My cheesecake? No. She eyeballs the guy standing beside me, then back at me. Am I supposed to interpret this eyeballing? She then snarks at me to move, that, ""I need to take his order.""   ""THAT's interesting,"" I say. She has to take *his* before completing mine, after I've been standing there for ten minutes already. And how does that rule work if the line is more than two customers deep?  Have I wronged this woman somehow, in a past life perhaps? Just unreal. It's like she was stickin' it to me. For what? For being a customer?  While waiting for the next guy to place an infinitely long order before receiving mine, I see another manager come by. I tell HIM what just happened. He apologizes, which is nice, and he collects my cheesecake and hands it to me. Apologizes again. All that's well and good...but what are you going to do about that staffer (Sharonte, the receipt claims)? Let her look at me smugly as I leave, which she did, and let bygones be bygones?  Bad service is bad service, happens from time to time. But this felt weirdly personal, and as if no one cared whatsoever. Looking at other negative reviews, there's an obvious pattern here, as well as the textbook response from Management. Maybe try fixing your service issues instead of endlessly apologizing for them?  This Cheesecake is less than a mile from my house, but there's no way I'll ever return, not with that welcoming and sendoff as if I'd been punished for some unknown transgression.  Cheesecake splurge mood: spoiled. Rotten."
Douglas N.,"North Las Vegas, NV",294,11,82,5.0,10/29/2017,Promise to my son when he got straight A's. We went to Cheesecake Factory. The foods were so amazing! My son loved well done steak and he gave it for 5 stars. We also tried with different foods as they referred us. Their foods were good. Good customer service! I had a good diner with my family. I would come back!
Jeff Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",245,679,2417,4.0,3/13/2017,"I had a gift card as well as coupon for a free slice of Cheesecake as Christmas gifts, so decided to finally use them. The restaurant was fairly busy even in the middle of the afternoon, but I was seated immediately (easy when you are a party of one). The interior was semi-upscale and clean, like most Cheesecake Factory locations. I originally was greeted by a female waitress who said she would be right with me, but then I ended up being waited on by a young male waiter instead. He was very friendly, but it was clear that he was very new and probably in training. For some reason, he removed my set of utensils and napkins, so I had to ask for a new knife to spread butter when my bread basket came. The bread was fairly tasty: warm and two varieties. I ended up ordering the eggroll sampler as well as the avocado toast. Both dishes were good, though the avocado spread on the toast was a bit tart. I was actually pretty stuffed after finishing both dishes, so had to take my strawberry cheesecake slice to-go to eat later. My water was inconsistently refilled, and it took A LONG time for my check to come, and even longer for the bill to come back after I gave my credit card and gift card/coupon.  Though the service during this meal was a bit below average, the food was still decent and I would consider this a solid Cheescake Factory."
Israel S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,54,46,5.0,11/13/2017,"UPDATE: Last time we came here we didn't have the best experience. But we came back to this Cheesecake Factory to give it another try. We received the best service hands down from Robbie, The guy with the  man bun, blue glasses and big ol beard. At first he came by our table handed us some waters and bread and walked away and didn't say anything. We were like oh no, here we go again. Then he came back and offered to get us some drinks and such. Honestly, he's not your typical server, but it's what made us like him so much. He's not super bubbly and chatty and fake like half of the servers you get. He seems very genuine and thats what made us like him so much. Definitely will be back.  Robbie is awesome!!!  *** This was literally my first bad experience at the Cheesecake Factory EVER! Normally me and my fiancé come and have a great experience, great food, and overall great service. This time we didn't get to experience any of that.  This was our first time at this particular location. But since we come here so often, we already know what we want to eat. And this time we were on a slight time crunch, wanted to be in and out in an hour. We got sat on the patio, on a Wednesday afternoon. It was a pretty slow section. There were only 3 or 4 tables. So when the server first greeted us, we immediately ordered our food when we ordered our drinks. That was at 2:30, so 15 minutes goes by and our server accidentally takes a fall and hurts herself, breaking glasses and such. She went to the back to get iced up I believe. With all the servers they had all day, you'd think they'd get someone to cover her section. But all we really got was a walk by from a manager asking if we were ok. 35 minutes goes by. And we still don't have our food. Our waitress was back out on the floor.  At that point I just wanted to walk out, but we did order drinks and still had to pay for them. And my fiancé was starving, so we asked to get our food Togo. 45 minutes later, we get our food Togo. I asked to get our delicious strawberry lemonade Togo, and they gave us a tiny kids cup filled with ice to go with our meal. As we walked out, I told the manager that stopped by our table earlier that our service was terrible, and all he had to say was that he was unaware of it. We understand our server did get hurt but that doesn't make up for the terrible service. Especially since there's 20+ servers working on the floor at the time. We don't eat at Cheesecake to eat takeout, we choose to eat at Cheesecake for the experience, and this Cheesecake Factory restaurant completely failed us."
Christine F.,"Las Vegas, NV",1036,127,596,3.0,12/8/2017,"Don't get me wrong... who doesn't love The Cheesecake Factory? This review is specifically aimed for this location.  This was my first time to this property. I came tonight for a birthday party. Now I understand large groups can be challenging but with that being said there were still some awkward moments. I arrived and when I asked for my party the girl at the front just gave me half ass directions. She told me to go through the double doors. The only double doors I saw looked like an exit outside so I just kind of roamed around aimlessly until I was able to stop and ask another employee where to go. So those double doors that led out were correct. So they have doors that go outside first and then there is another set of doors leading to a separate room. But come on.... I know I couldn't have been the first person to be confused by the layout. It wouldn't have killed her to give a little more detail. Our server was nice and personable. I ordered the Louisiana pasta. Tasty but not really memorable. The lady next to me ordered the salmon which she said was fantastic. Two people on opposite ends of the table ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta and they both said the shrimp was WAY over cooked, rubbery and a lot of shell. See no one really checked on how the meal was until we were all almost done. Since it was a birthday my friend was trying to be discreet and let the server know about the dissatisfaction with the shrimp on two dishes. His response was that she should have let him no sooner. And yes... she should have. But no one came by to check. So was she supposed to interrupt dinner to find someone. Again, it was a birthday party and she didn't want to make a scene. Then the check came without offering anyone dessert. Yes.... dessert came for the birthday girl. So that should have been a great time to ask anyone if they would like to finish it off with something sweet. When my check was handed to me I asked for a piece to go and was told I would have to have two separate checks. Ok fine. I guess it's somehow my fault I wasn't offered dessert before the check. 2 bills then. Whatever. Just bring me my cheesecake please...."
Daphne L.,"San Diego, CA",1382,1153,1103,3.0,8/9/2017,"This is nestled in the outlet mall. The menu is pretty standard and the service was actually not up-to-par with some of my other Cheesecake Factory visits in Southern California. Their ""patio"" is actually an indoor patio area- which I think is smart. Parking is whatever the outlet mall has to offer (which may get busy on some days). This place was a-ok."
Loreal G.,"Las Vegas, NV",335,159,323,4.0,8/7/2017,"The hostess was polite and sat us in the amount of time she allotted for our wait. The service was attentive, not personal, but we received our food as ordered and in a reasonable time. The portions of food were good except for my order of the seared ahi. For $20 I got a bunch of rice that was closer to hard than soft and four slivers of tuna that belonged on an appetizer platter or with a salad. I was highly disappointed in my meal, still hungry and everyone else's leftovers. My sister and son shared fettuccine alfredo with shrimp that was yummy and my cousin ordered a chicken tender dish that was probably the whole damn chicken. I was the only one that got the short end of the stick but everything else was good."
Viri L.,"Las Vegas, NV",678,184,386,5.0,12/1/2016,"First time coming to this specific location, and I love that is down the street from my house. We went to celebrate my mothers birthday, tried to call ahead to make reservations but they do not take any. Thankfully it was not busy and our party of 9 got seated right away. Our server was great, but I honestly cannot remember his name :( He was asian, wore glasses and I think his name could have been Han or something like that.  Food was good, everyone order something different.  I had their combination plate with my favorite thing ever, herb crusted salmon. Came with a creamy lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes. For the second thing I got their steak diane. I forgot how it tasted and I was craving mushrooms so decided to get it. Let's just say that I did not enjoy it, as I thought I would.  We had some buffalo chicken strips that were really good.  And my boyfriend had their jambalaya with shrimp, sausage and not sure what else but it was tasty. Packed with a lot of flavor. Only downfall was that they had ran out of white rice, so they gave him brown rice.  For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake....eh I do not like red velvet so I am not even going to review this dessert. All I can say is, it was a huge slice.  As we were finishing dinner, they brought out a little ice cream sundae for my mom, as they sang Happy Birthday. Over all everyone had a great experience."
S P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",36,26,9,1.0,12/23/2017,We ordered carside to go. My husband and I both ordered the cheese steak. Both breads were burned and very hard like they were stale. The steak was very chewy. Stay away in regards to the food. Def not worth the money.
Sivilay T.,"Orinda, CA",67,735,1929,4.0,5/17/2017,"Review #099 - 2017 My friend and I were walking around the outlet and got hungry in the middle of our shopping trip so we decided to head over to the Cheesecake Factory for a quick lunch.  We showed up around 1:30 PM for lunch and were seated within 5 minutes.   I felt really terrible because we were walking for quite a while before my friend told me that she was starving.  I'm such a bad friend! Our waitress came to greet us and brought us some iced water.  We ordered an appetizer and one item each and decided to share everything. I wanted to try the truffle-bacon grilled cheese sticks as our appetizer, and I am so glad that it turned out to be really good or else I would've been really disappointed since my friend told me to choose. She ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta and asked if she could have a side of salad, but I told her that I was going to order the factory chopped salad and she could just share some of mine.  Good thing we decided to share everything because their portions are no joke.  We enjoyed everything we ordered. Service was pleasant and our food arrived in a timely manner.  Our only complaint was that the air conditioner was probably set to 40 degrees or something since it was 90+ degrees out and the temperature difference was so drastic that it made it hard to enjoy the environment."
Ann T.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,24,96,4.0,8/25/2017,"Great food, Great people! My pasta carbonara was just a lil but oily, but the mushrooms were so tasty! Steak was ewwwwk! The bread was freshly made. The wait for the food is not too bad, just expect it since the location is at the outlet so it's busy. Overall the experience was good!"
Alona L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,14,,3.0,12/13/2017,Went here for my bday last night with some family and friends . Our waitress Candice was pretty nice so i didn't take things out on here but It was very inconvenient and annoying to be constantly told that they were out of what we ordered . We were there much longer than we wanted to be cause we waiting forever for our food to get to us . I was so disappointed. At one point i didn't even want to wait for my food . I just wanted to leave .
Amy T.,"Las Vegas, NV",771,248,2135,5.0,3/7/2017,"If you're not counting calories and you're hungry, swing on by to The Cheesecake Factory. Super cute and spacious restaurant located in the Premium Outlet Mall. The restaurant is very comfortable and is the perfect spot to catch up with your friends, stop by when you get hungry from all the shopping, or when you are craving a piece of cheesecake. They serve anything from fish and seafood, to salads, to sandwiches, to pastas! I always order the Louisiana Chicken Pasta when I'm here and I've been doing that for the past several years. You can't go wrong. They also have a skinny menu if you're trying to be healthy. Cheesecakes here are also a must. Save your tummy for a slice or take one home with you!"
Clairin D.,"Las Vegas, NV",205,194,807,4.0,7/25/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory offered an inviting lunch venue today.  A full sun, morning in July with a temperature of 108°F already, can leave a shopping clan of adults and children weary, parched and irritable.  Upon our entry, the service was cheerful, immediate, and helpful. Our table service from James was hospitable and accurate. The Kids' Menu was varied. The proportions were generous. My son opted for grilled salmon, sauteed carrots and French Fries. My daughter's plate had crispy, moist chicken tenders fresh fruit and also French Fries. The chicken was surprisingly lightly battered rather than a dense mass. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for a family friendly day in Las Vegas. A 5 star day for me is a menu with lots of organic options."
Glenn N.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,22,11,5.0,12/6/2017,The cheese cake factory on 505 S grand central parkway in Las vegas nevada is an excellent place to eat at the staff take excellent care of their customers 100 per cent and the food is very good too/ Bodacious
Myra M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,,2.0,11/26/2017,"Black Friday. The check in host was fabulous while as expected the lunch time wait and crowd on Black Friday was Crazy however she did a great job. The fresh guacamole was NOT so fresh, it was brown. The pot stickers seemed a little burnt and not in consistent with the one at Summerlin's Cheesecake Factory.  Our waiter was sweating you could see it on his forehead. He seemed overwhelmed which made us not want to ask for anything however we did ask for more bread which he forgot about and we never rec'd. We were overcharged on our bill for wine.  Last year we came at the same time Black Friday and the food, service whole experience was perfect! Don't know what happened this year."
John J.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,5.0,12/29/2017,"Even though the service was below par and the wait was long for the food, the scrumptious food and amazing presentation at a good value more than make up for it."
Jacqueline S.,"Clayton, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/22/2017,"I was shocked to see this particular store was so very  different than all the other Cheesecake Factory's I've  eaten in. The service was poor, the table was a mess, the silverware was haphazardly placed. The table was actually dirty and when I brought it  to the attention of staff, she scooped it off with her hands,  we were speechless.  The flavor of the food has diminished over the years, or is it this location? I'll try The Cheesecake Factory  ONCE more....another location!"
Julia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,50,7,3.0,11/3/2017,"Service was great, waitress was nice and friendly. But it was a first time when I get disappointed with food in Cheesecake. It was very oily and salty. Mushrooms wasn't cooked enough. Avocado rolls was ok but still had too much oil."
Rody Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",466,6,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Took 25 minutes to get simple appetizers ( 2 house salads, and mac and cheese) Waitress super rude and had no knowledge of menu.  Food comes out 3 minutes after the appetizers were finally brought and tasted as if they had been under the warming light for 20 minutes . Never coming here again."
Tiffany C.,"Bakersfield, CA",109,1,,1.0,7/23/2017,"We came here to celebrate my nieces birthday huge mistake! We arrived at 845 and we're seated pretty quickly for a party of 10, it wasn't that busy. That's where the best part ends. It took about 15 min for the waiter Nate to get to our table to even ask for our drink order. Another 10 min pass before our order is taken and 10 min later he returns to inform one of our guests they are out of fried zucchini.... ok no problem. Now 30 min pass and waiter informs a guest that they are out of steak... WTH.. At this point we are getting pretty hungry and you know they bring all food out together sooo further delay. An hour has passed and I get up go to the front and ask for a manager. Manager Rob appears and I explain we have been waiting an hour and the 30 min delay in finding out they were out of steak. He tells me that the order hadn't been back there long as if I were lying, I was literally pissed! He proceeded to say he would look into it.  I see him in the kitchen area talking to his staff and after another 15min some of the food starts appearing. Crazy part mine appeared last.  Some birthday celebration I lost my appetite.      Needless to say I will never return. Maybe smaller parties have better luck but this service was horrible."
Chy R.,"Madison, WI",954,474,1486,3.0,5/2/2016,"Located in the North Premium Outlet mall, having been given a gift card, we decided to stop here after shopping and wanting a drink. We didn't order food and sat at the bar. But then again, once you've eaten at one Cheesecake Factory, you've eaten at them all.  The lovely bartender took and made our drink orders straight away. We ordered a passion fruit mojito and a Long Island Ice Tea. Total with tip came to be about $25. The mojito was deliciously served in a tall Pilsner glass. The fresh mint leaves was a refreshing treat. The LIIT was also good, with a heavy pour, but then again it's a LIIT."
Paul C.,"Honolulu, HI",103,187,762,4.0,11/13/2016,"This location is located where my wife and I were outlet shopping.  Very convenient, spacious, and well decorated.  They have an extensive menu and the service is great.  We shared a bbq chicken salad and a combo entrée with chicken and beef.  We were so stuffed that we couldn't order any cheesecake.  We did however, look at cheesecake showcase to dream about it.  Next time, as from previous experiences, this is what they are known for."
