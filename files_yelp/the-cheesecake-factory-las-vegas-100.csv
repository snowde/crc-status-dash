Sabrina F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,23,4,1.0,10/1/2015,"Horrible service and poor management. I had to ask for silverware a plate and given menu and had to seat myself while everyone else around me was getting seated... The server never once asked if I needs refill or if everything was ok. She took my order and that was the entire time I saw her. NEVER COME TO THIS CRAPPY DIRTY LOCATION!!!! I spoke to the manager Danny, and he's a fantastic example of Poor management."
Michelle M.,"Gresham, OR",0,7,1,2.0,10/2/2016,We we're seated very fast and we're brought our appetizers pretty quick. About 10 minutes after ordering all of our food a gentleman came up to us and informed us that there was no more prime rib. Our waitress Bree soon followed after. She was unaware that there was no more prime rib. The gentleman proceeded asked my husband what other selection he would like. He hovered over him until he made a decision. At no point did the gentleman or our waitress apologize for the inconvenience. Our food was brought out at different times. Upon receiving the order that my husband chose it was quite Untasty and  had no flavor. Our waitress didn't bother to ask us how we liked their food nor did her or management do anything about the inconvenience. Although my food was brought to me hot and tastes well the lack of customer service and poor communication between the kitchen staff and waitstaff has caused this negative review. We will not be attending this location anymore because of it.
Tinie P.,"Kansas City, MO",0,8,,1.0,10/25/2015,"Decent food horrible service. We ate in the bar area. Staff was everywhere but not attentive we had to ask for water, straw, saucer, silverware, salt/pepper..... The table was not set and staff didn't address it at all. Observed several other customers in the same situation. NOT typical style/service that I expect from the Cheesecake Factory especially with a $60 bill."
Robert S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,5.0,12/15/2015,"We've had dinner at this location twice and had a great meal and service on both occasions.  I had the Steak Diane and my date had the chicken...both dishes were delicious!  The server was attentive and kept up with our beverages.  While it is moderately priced it was well worth it.  Finally, hardly any wait at all - we were seated within five minutes on both occasions.  I would recommend the Cheesecake Factory and this particular location to family and friends."
Jeff G.,"Chicago, IL",9,11,2,3.0,8/23/2015,"Perhaps I've just had a bad experience ordering a salad and a glass of iced tea.  Not a tall order.  I ordered, got my tea and bread, ran to the restroom, came back to the bus boy perusing my outlet mall shopping bag, after clearing my table.  He (max) realizes his mistake and gets a different waiter to correct things.  This I can deal with.  I get my salad... Then eventually some silverware... And a tea... And then some bread... And then my salad is missing the pecans and is drizzled with 2 unfortunate bites of goat cheese.  I politely ask for the salad to be tossed with some pecans.  But alas it returns with just a few pecans (wouldn't you think to toss in like a solid partial handful or something) and still no goat cheese.  Did the chef just look at it when it returned and say -- ""that looks like shit.. Let's serve it again like that.""  The waitress and manager were the saving grace of this whole operation (and the reason for 3 stars).  They were extremely polite and empathetic, but I will not be coming back to this location just out of the shear complacence in the food preparation.  I hate being that guy, but when your order doesn't get fixed after you send it back, something must be said.   Sincerely, Unsatisfied customer: Jeff"
Michelle B.,"Long Beach, CA",4,25,25,5.0,7/27/2015,This is considered the North Las Vegas location. Best service from Gary P. We went to this location instead of on the Strip to avoid the wait times. Our party of 7 was seated immediately on a Thursday night without any wait. Its located on the north end of a new Outlet mall off Bonneville. There is a parking structure right across from the restaurant. Our server Gary P. was the best! He assisted everyone (including the kids) with a friendly and easygoing manner to order exactly what they wanted. I ordered Evelyn's Favorite Pasta (veg) with chicken even though that wasn't an option on the menu. Gary came over many times to make sure our drinks were filled and brought us extra bread. Everything was cooked perfectly and the wait time for the food was not long. I also ordered the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake to go and everyone enjoyed a bite at the hotel. Best service I've ever had at any Cheesecake factory! Will definitely go again when next in Vegas.
Rosette H.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,15,6,4.0,9/2/2015,"I'm normally not a fan of The Cheesecake Factory, but I have to say, they must have stepped it up since I've been there last. I'd never been to this one, but it is closer to home, so decided to take the family here for dinner.  Parking wasn't too bad. We parked in the Parking Garage B right off Bonneville. Took us maybe 5-8 minutes to find parking and we walked across the street from the parking garage to the restaurant. The restaurant has valet too so if you prefer not to deal with the parking, I highly advise. The front entrance to the restaurant is off of the street side across from the garage. You can also enter from another door that is deeper inside the mall, but then you have to walk through the dining room to get to the hostess area at the front.  For appetizers, the family and I ordered the Fried Mac and Cheese balls (delicious) and an assortment of varied spring rolls which were also very good.    I ordered Evelyn's Famous Pasta. As to be expected, the portion size was huge! Everything in the dish tasted fresh and not overly cooked. The broccoli had a bit of crispness left to it and the mushrooms weren't soggy! It was very good.  Hubby had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta and even he said he was surprised how great it was!  The wait time wasn't too bad for our food. Noise level is normally pretty high overall and that is to be expected too. The dinner here was a pleasant surprise overall. I hope it continues to be so!"
Josie C.,"Cerritos, CA",6,26,11,1.0,6/7/2015,"From the moment we walked in was terrible.  From getting seated to our food.  All messed up, literally.  What's so hard to get simple things right! Yes, when I say everything, I mean everything.  Appetizers, main entre to our check.  Cannot think of a nice thing to say about this location.  If you want to walk out with a sour mouth of a bad experience this is your spot."
Romina C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,4,1.0,5/20/2015,Poor Customer Service. Waiters are rude and told me not to bring my baby's stroller inside and they let us sit outside just because we have a baby. Then I saw that other parents have their strollers with them. So I also did the same because I dont see anything wrong taking the stroller with me. We like the Rampart branch better. The waiter is just not friendly and they serve us cold bread. It was our first time in that location and it was really a bad experience.
Jesus G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,5,5.0,11/15/2015,"One word: consistency! Food has same flavors as every restaurant of the chain, Lakayla our waitress is very attentive and when we needed something else and she wasn't available the rest of the crew ""jumped"" to cover our needs. I love their team work spirit! Thanks for always giving us great experiences!"
Tiffany S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,1,,1.0,10/26/2015,"Awful service, awful drinks and the whole place seemed to be a mess. Love Cheesecake Factory, this location just sucks unfortunately."
Jasmine T.,"Henderson, NV",165,44,9,2.0,5/22/2015,"Staff is plentiful however service was extremely slow. It took over 30 minutes for our order to be taken, another 30 to get our appetizers. Our waters were empty for some time. The food was great and was just as it was expected, which is always good. It just seems that there should be more attention to tables when there were a minimum of 45 employees present."
Mary S.,"Page, AZ",0,20,5,2.0,7/9/2015,Food was decent. Bathroom was gross. Service was okay. Spent way too much money for what it was worth.
Blair W.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",0,31,11,5.0,6/11/2015,"Great food, servers were very nice and attentive. Excellent bar menu with professional bartenders, overall it was a fantastic experience and we will definitely be back. Love that they don't offer in Wi-Fi for customers so people can enjoy more family time"
Nat R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,6/3/2016,"They got the orders from 50% of our group wrong including mine. Then got the factory nachos. The chips were burn, the cheese was barely drizzled on it, about 5 pieces of jalapeño. Was not worth $5 and nowhere near the $12 they charged. Horrid compared to what you get out at other locations like Boca. Total ripoff."
Prince D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,9,5.0,9/7/2015,"The Chicken Parm Sandwich, is amazing.  Always fresh and hot.  Its a simple sandwich in general.  This place has nailed it.  As far as I'm concerned.  I've visited different locations with this order.  Not sure if it's because they are dairly new, at the time of this post?  However, it was spot on!  Was so full, didnt even order dessert....."
Sarah J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,19,1.0,6/13/2015,"Second time going here and second time getting horrible service. Ive done order to pick up and they always don't understand that I'm outside and transfer at least twice. The whole procees took 15 mins today and i only ordered 1 slice of cheesecake, just disappointing, so close to work but Im not going again and spending so much time just to pick up."
Juan G.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,10,1,1.0,6/18/2015,"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible, went there in June 8th. Got seated right away... My girlfriend then right away went to the restroom, came back, then I went to the restroom... And we waited, and waited. Mind you no one had acknowledged that we were there. Bussers, waiters, would walk by, and nope not even a ""Hi, have you been helped, yet?"" Nothing. So after maybe 20 minutes of waiting we finally grab a waiter walking by and ask to speak to a manager there. Again, another 10 minutes. When she did show up, I was suprised. Very unproffesional. Very, very unprofessional. Like she didnt care. So it turns out the reason we were just there, sitting was because the ""section"" was closed... Horrible experience. Dont go there. The waiters dont care. The manager didnt care. Dont go there."
Phillip B.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,27,6,1.0,1/1/2016,Just picked up a couple slices of cheesecake to go...asked if there was military discount...there isn't...but the guy behind me orders his slices (and he wreaks of marijuana) he gets a discount for working at the outlets..I kinda see something wrong with that...oh well..I can't wait to move to Germany
Roger R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,2.0,3/1/2016,"Waited for our food for about a good 30 minutes, not to mention the bread they gave us was hard and crunchy. Fresh bread ? I think not. It's ridiculous the wait time when it wasn't busy and they sat us down pretty quick. Other than that the food was pretty good. Would I go to Cheesecake Factory again? Of course I would. Would I come back to this one in the outlet mall? No way in hell"
