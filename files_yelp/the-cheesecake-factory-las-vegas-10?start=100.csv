Laura ..,"North Las Vegas, NV",5,34,16,5.0,2/28/2017,"Oh my, I was so hungry. Being Celiac it's common place to watch other people eat while they try to explain how barbecue sauce is gluten-free. I remembered CCF has a GF option. Brandon S was amazingly patient. What a doll! The first thing I ordered wasn't available so the kitchen whipped me up this masterpiece. The corn cakes with grilled chicken on top. This was the best ever. The flavors of savory, sweet with the corn kernel crunch. Made my toes curl! Deliciousness. Thank you staff, chef and management."
Connie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",81,79,88,3.0,1/17/2017,"Got to visit the store at the Premium Outlets North location for our Christmas lunch. It was very nice, but definitely a bit overpriced. I was glad I wasn't paying! I got the bacon, bacon cheeseburger, which was pretty good. I also got a side salad, which was ok. I'll probably only go back for dessert."
Natasha R.,"North Las Vegas, NV",55,42,43,5.0,3/12/2017,Went to have lunch with my family to celebrate my son's 5th birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make my son feel special. He left with a smile on his face and a new stuffed animal the server game him. The food is always great and their customer service was top notch.
Emily L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,6,,2.0,3/9/2017,"The strawberry cheesecake tasted like someone decided to freeze old strawberries and then put them on top of a cheesecake slice that had been sitting in a cooler for a week. The avocado toast was toasted so much, not even the world's sharpest knife could penetrate it. The coca-cola tasted how it should though and although the service was slow, the people were nice."
Donna B.,"Springfield, MO",0,53,27,4.0,1/23/2017,This Cheesecake Factory was good as always. Seated right away. Food did not take very long and waitress was pleasant and efficient. Had our favorite stuffed chicken tortillas. It is connected to an outlet mall. There is a parking garage located conveniently by the restaurant; however the garage showed 154 open parking spaces and there was hardly none.
Miss B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,1.0,4/24/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory! I hate to do this....in the bar area, waitresses were absolutely the WORST I'VE EVER HAD! This is my first bad review. Asked for no onions..... onions on EVERYTHING. We sat for 25 mins before we got asked if we had a server to take our drink orders.....The water glasses had lipstick on all the rims, and I'm pretty sure there were Sea Monkeys in the water we were served. My drink had to be reordered 3 times..... and it was 2 shots of silver tequila on ice.....takes a genius. I could go on....I'm annoyed by having to relive it.... Cheesecake Factory HR....take note: Stop hiring people that haven't fully developed the ability to walk upright.  You're welcome."
Eric S.,"Mililani, HI",5,72,5,3.0,1/4/2017,"I had lunch here last week and they are gangbusters busy.  However, the service felt seamless and our server was very nice.  I ordered the Louisiana pasta lunch special and it was okay...in comparison to other options there was only a small portion of chicken. I was a little taken back since typically Cheesecake provides large portions."
Arylen J.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,47,11,5.0,2/16/2017,"Cheesecake factory.. at the Premium Vegas outlets........ WOW long walk to get to it but worth it. It was our first time amd 2 of us had the small burger and salad. We both agreeded the burger was TOPS! The salad lacked color, just a big bowl of green. Our other party had a philly sandwich. STEAK KNIVES NEEDED.  The bread  was hard to cut. Over all it was FANTASTIC! Going back for dinner one day!"
E S.,"Pomona, CA",2,46,15,5.0,8/28/2016,Awesome experience Shawn was our main waiter and he was great. Great service by the whole staff. Shawn went xtra mile
Moshe A.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,20,21,5.0,10/6/2016,I had lunch today and the food was great we did order salmon appetizers and lunch I will repeat ....
Mike B.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,57,47,4.0,3/31/2017,"My date and I had dinner before going to the Frankie Moreno concert at Cabaret Jazz at The Smith Center. The food was delicious. I had wonderful salmon, spinach and rice. She had a fancy salad. Both of us enjoyed our meal. The service and decor were excellent."
Sarah K.,"Los Angeles, CA",304,49,16,1.0,4/30/2016,Super slow service. Requested a change in our seating and server never flagged down the hostess for us until we did ourselves. No drink refills either. I don't think the waiter was trained enough to take care of the entire patio section by himself.  Food was mediocre as well. Jambalaya was extremely dry and the salad was dumped in dressing. I've definitely had better at other Cheesecake locations. I was swamped after hours of walking and shopping but then this experience just made it worse...
Margret C.,"Las Vegas, NV",208,1402,738,5.0,8/10/2015,"I was so excited about the expansion of the Premium Outlets/North, and was even more so, when I heard that this major restaurant was joining the newest shopping wing. Good timing, too. We had a couple gift cards to use.  So, we came here on saturday for lunch, way before the crowd; since we got a tip from one of the ladies here to get in here before 12:15 pm as we were checking out the menu posted outside.  We had the complimentary bread basket  with butter (french baguette slices and pumpernickel slices) and our little man had one too, which also included sliced bananas. I had a bunch of questions about the menu, since it'd been a while. I opted for the lunch size asian salad, while hubby had his favorite item, the cuban sandwich, and our little man had the mini corndogs and fries. It was delicious. I couldn't finish my salad, which was pretty big, even for the lunch size, but I'm glad I asked about the size of the salad. We also got dessert, once I mentioned the crazy one, hubby wanted that one. It was really good, too. I just was stuffed. (We had leftovers.) We still had a balance on one of the gift cards. They are treated as credit cards, so you still have to sign them.  The service was excellent- our server was pretty attentive (drink refills, and checking on us from time to time). And the other servers were nice and smiling, as they passed us, too. It's refreshing to see people in customer service who want to be there, who enjoy their jobs.    Inside, the decor (barqoue/neo-classical- elegant), was very in line with their other restaurants (been to Forum/Summerlin/Green Valley). We had to switch seats (booth & tables seating is available) as the TV had hubby's game that he was DVR'ing. Our stoller was stored with the rest, elsewhere. The lady gave us a claim ticket.  Bathrooms were near the entrance. There were mens, womens, and a family one. I went into the womens and there were two stalls, one was handicapped. I went into the smaller one so I don't know if there was a baby changing station in the handicapped stall.  The food court at this Premium Outlets is really lacking (Ok, who am I kidding, it sucks!), so this restaurant is going to be very busy and popular (the huge menu and the huge selection of cheesecake flavors). Hubby mentioned that this could be one of our special occasion restaurants. Our first date was at the one at Forum Shops (back in 2004). So, yes, we will be back. It's a yummy place."
Joanna Marie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,62,378,4.0,9/10/2015,"Knowing Cheesecake Factory, I personally try to steer away because of their food. Don't get me wrong. Their foods are mostly good but they also pack a punch in calories. So I was surprised when along with their regular menu, we were given a ""Skinnylicous"" one. It was so exciting! They listed all their food options and most of them are below 600 calories! Score! We ordered appetizers and I settled with the Skinnylicious burger. It was surprisingly good! You would think that something like that would be more than 600 calories at least. I am really glad that they have this option available. I might consider dining here again if I'm in the area and not be scared that I have no other options but unhealthy ones."
Lisa B.,"Henderson, NV",57,8,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Very disappointed in this location service and manager. Called prior to event and was told we don't take reservations. Opted to have the party there anyway due to convenient location. Bought two rounds of drinks at the bar and gave $5 tips both times. On the third trip to the bar, the bartender said don't come up to the bar again get a server to bring you drinks. What? This is Las Vegas and a bar. People walk up to the bar at every other place I've been all the time. Also, seating was available but we had to wait. Spoke to the manager and he was rude and didn't care. There were 25 people having food and drinks. You'd think they would be happy for the business. I will say most servers were nice, food was good, and we made the most of the seating issue and the bad attitude of that bartender and rude manager. But my future group events we will go elsewhere."
Sam G.,"El Cajon, CA",4,33,5,2.0,4/30/2016,Disappointing customer care. Server was rude and careless. Asked for more bread and never got it. Water and soft drinks were never topped  I give them 0% on customer care  Not a real cheese cake factory restaurant
P C.,"New York, NY",0,30,,2.0,7/26/2017,"Had lunch here today. I ordered from the Skinny menu and my dining companion ordered from the regular menu. The food was below mediocre. Each of us had pasta and the pasta was cold and stuck together. I had shrimp (five of them) with my pasta and it tasted as though it may have been cooked yesterday. The server was okay, but he delivered our entrees at different times. Perhaps my pasta wasn't cold and sticky enough yet. Forty dollars for no-so-good two entrees and one drink is also a bit pricey, but I guess the marketing must be paid for as it seems they aren't spending good money on food product. Too pricey for less than mediocre and truth be told, if the bill were only twenty dollars, it would still not be worth the quality of food delivered to us - at separate time!"
N L.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,106,411,3.0,7/23/2016,"I ordered the same lunch special; except this time instead of corn, I opted for the green beans.  They had the snap I prefer for my vegetables to have; but, they were salty and oily."
Nick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,173,1149,4.0,7/9/2016,"The food was ok but the service was good.. We ordered three appetizers.  Avocado roll, tex-mex roll and quesadilla.  The tex-mex rolls seemed a bit over cooked and burnt. The. Waiter was attentive and helpful. His name was James.  At the last minute I couldn't resist a slice of Oreo cheesecake.  That was good."
AandD R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,1,5.0,1/16/2017,Came here on MLK day. Food was good and quick. Kudos to our server Pedro for the friendly service.
