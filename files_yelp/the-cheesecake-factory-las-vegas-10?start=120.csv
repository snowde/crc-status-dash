Victoria E.,"Salt Lake City, UT",51,30,107,5.0,7/18/2015,Woohoo gluten free people. Cheesecake Factory loves us!! There are so many many chooses for you here. So please don't get scared and walk away... Look at the options.  Got one down the street so i know I can make a to go order and come and pick something good to enjoy at my house.1/2 of my pasta was cooked the other half was under cooked.  Shrimp tasted not cooked all the way. And I have always been a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. But idk I am just saying. How do you have a huge Resturant and you only have two small tiny stalls in the bathrooms.  Really???? I think bathrooms need to be upgraded.  Our waitress was helpful when I went to tell her about my meal so she told the manager and he is suppose to come over and talk to me about. The manager was awesome and comped my meal. Wanted to give me another one. But I am full and am not wanting to eat anything else for the rest of the day.

He was an awesome bartender and made us a delicious Ultimate Margarita & offered us complimentary bread and butter. We went shopping, then came back for more! It was a great addition to our day."
Jared N.,"Henderson, NV",268,546,370,4.0,9/20/2016,"Some of my office mates and I came to Cheesecake Factory last week for one of their birthdays.  I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before so I looked at the online menu before we even left.  I wanted to have at least some kind of idea going in.  It did not take me long to choose the Renee Special lunch with a Ceasar Salad, chicken almond salad sandwich and the soup of the day, cream of mushroom.  I was very happy with all of it.  From quality to quantity, it was all enjoyable.  The salad, while a good Ceasar, was nothing special.  Just a salad done right.  The soup was crazy good.  I love mushrooms and mushroom soup. This was an interesting varient that was a littl less creamy than I am used to but loaded with mushrooms, carrots and some other bits of deliciousness.  The sandwich was abotu as good as the soup.  Even though it was chicken salad.  This wasn't the soggy mash of chicken salad your mama used to send you to school with. This was solid chunks of chicken with a bit of mayo and almonds.  It was very good and I would gladly order it again.  My one regret is not ordering a piece of cheesecake.  I love cheesecake and I was at the Cheesecake Factory.  How could I be so careless as to not order cheesecake?  I just have to shrug that off right now and go back again later.  I'll get my cheescake.  Beileve me I will."
Ryo Hanalei Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",401,179,1405,5.0,8/13/2015,"I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory, the food is delicious and the service is always good.   From entering in the restaurant and being greeted, you will feel like you're welcomed properly. The decor is inviting and the staff seems like they're enjoying what they do. Our party 5 were seated and not too long our drinks were ordered.  Not much of a wait as we sat, chatted, and perused the menu, did our drinks arrive. Appetizers were ordered and it was time for a clink of our raised glasses & cheers! From the delivery of our appetizers and ordering entrees, everything was timely and it was easy for our group to enjoy our time there. We ate so much that we were sorry we didn't have time for dessert!  Maybe next time! Thanks you Cheesecake Cake Factory for an awesome lunch! :)"
Kim M.,"Fort Wayne, IN",9,163,230,4.0,5/8/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a favorite of my sons. The appetizers are nicely portioned. My most recent visit I opted for the chicken enchilada nachos. They nachos were crisp and warm, topped with a generous mound of cheese and chicken and drizzled nicely with semi spicy enchilada sauce. They'retopped with pico, sour cream, and guacamole. We also choose the Parmesan Garlic Cheese bread. The bread was served warm with lots of gooey cheese in the middle on the side was a small bowl of garlic oil dipping sauce.  For our entrees we choose grilled Salmon and Spicy Louisiana chicken pasta. The salmon was grilled to a flaky perfection. It was served with mash and fresh veggies.  The pasta was almost al dente, which is not to me liking, but it was spiced and sauced just the way I prefer.  We couldn't leave without a slice of its namesake. We ordered the Oreo cheesecake. It was enough to share with a party of 3 and light, creamy, with the the right amount of cookie flavor."
Carol C.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/18/2017,"Great experience here!   Ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a gluten free bun due to an allergy.  Alejandro, our waiter was very knowledgeable, thorough and double checked everything with the manager-Robb.  They both spoke to the chef and line to make sure of no cross contamination. Ended our meal with the Godiva double chocolate cheesecake for dessert.  Alejandro and Robb, thanks for making our eating experience a one in a lifetime!  Will definitely return!"
Asia A.,"Henderson, NV",8,17,13,4.0,6/14/2015,"I love the cheesecakes, I think I've probably tried each flavor given I work at the outlets! I only get take out but everything I've gotten has been pretty good.  Although the service seems a bit inexperienced and lost at times they definitely are pretty nice, so I can deal with it.  Overall good food and exceptional service every time I've been!"
Michael W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,5.0,6/16/2017,"I gave 5 stars for service. The food was great had sweet potatoe fries. There was a delay in getting food at same time in our party. The mgr came out explained small delay, offered us appetizers, cheesecake. Things happen. They gave excellent customer service."
Ender A.,"Las Vegas, NV",594,11,,2.0,4/17/2016,The kitchen was backed up....not a big deal except we couldn't get bread or drinks and when we did get drinks and bread we couldn't get refills on either. Our server passed by us several times.....the steak (for the first time ever) was overcooked. In 10+ years of ordering rib eyes at Cheesecake Factory. Then when our food was packaged we didn't get sauces. Simply not the level of excellence we are used to.  Really disappointed.
Kevin L.,"Somerville, MA",0,29,8,1.0,9/23/2016,"Waiting 10mins for water, 10mins for drink order, 10 mins for bread and main dish order, and 18 mins waiting for getting check after meal. Plz, hire more waiters or waitresses and training them professionally."
Regina B.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,81,220,1.0,2/12/2016,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVJCE had to wait 15 for my water and lemonade.  My DTE. burger was med well she asked for well done.  We just had cheesecake on green valley yesterday and our server was great he got  30% tip well worth it didn't have to ask for a refill lime tonight and while my daughter was drinking the leomade he waits to take the same glass says its protocol.... What the I don't belie it...WOW never coming to this location at the North Outlets again!!!
Michelle C.,"Santee, CA",3,18,8,1.0,2/19/2016,"::Service was terrible right from the beginning.  We waited over 15 mins to sit down (mind you, it was NOT BUSY), then waited for water && bread for another 15 mins.  I actually had to tell not one, but two managers the wait time on water. Food took way too long to come Out and 2 other tables that came in after us was served their food first. My husband was a.manager for a few years at the San Diego. CAli Cheesecake Factory && he even said that tops should take no more than 2 mins to get drinks n bread out.  Also, nothing was compensated at the end of the night. I Don't ever expect anything for free, but normally managers would do that for customers who  Are unhappy with service or at least cover dessert.   The whole experience was terrible from the sit down to paying the bill.  Wait, wait, wait forever for anything!:: DON'T MESS WITH A 32 WEEK PREGNANT LADY && HER FOOD.  Okay, my rant is done.  Would still eat at Cheesecake because of the food, BUT NEVER AGAIN at this one at Caesars Palace .. The forum ..**Thumbs down!** in Rick James Voice!"
Sasa W.,"Calgary, Canada",22,34,598,4.0,2/19/2016,"Cheesecake Factory - My love restaurant in US!  They are always busy and long line up.  Reasons pricing and full menu.  Die for their cheesecake.  Our server is good, and very attentive.  Ordered CRISPY CRAB WONTONS, and they are soooooo tasty and crispy.  Also try their Factory Burger, with Sweet Potato fries.  A little disappointed as the charbroiled beef patty is a bit dry and they don`t come with any sauce inside the burger.  Love their BAJA CHICKEN TACOS, Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with Spicy Chicken, Cheese, Tomato, Avocado, Onion, Chipotle and Cilantro."
Ces H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,9,4.0,11/14/2016,Great food!!!! I had the salmon miso and it was so good. Awesome service given by Erin.  Not sure if I spelled her name correctly. The table lighting can be brighter so it's easier to review the long menu selection. Lots of food to chose from.  If it's your first time you should research what they have. Banana cream cheesecake is superb.
Sunny T.,"Glendale, CA",17,14,72,4.0,4/12/2016,"Great place to have lunch or dinner, while you shopping. This is now become our routine to stop before leaving outlet"
Evelyn L.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,6,15,4.0,2/5/2016,"Great food, awesome service from Brenda!! Dessert , atmosphere little busy but is ok, line at the door to be seat it is ok!! We have a good lunch!!"
Jun R.,"Valencia, CA",110,160,493,4.0,5/31/2015,"New Cheesecake Factory at the Premium outlet in LV. The staff were all very nice and friendly. We came here Sunday branch and ordered a monte cristo and burlee French toast with a side of bacon. The food took awhile to prepare but the staff made it more enduring to wait. We got a refill of the wheat bread and butter.  For those of you who have been to the premium oUtlet in LV, Cheesecake Factory is a nice addition and hangout place while waiting for diehard shoppers."
Asja W.,"Las Vegas, NV",50,6,1,1.0,7/23/2017,"It was surprisingly not good. Upon arrival, I went to take my daughter to the restroom, but there was only one stall available for use. The other two toilets were clogged. Ok. No big deal I guess. Get to our table the serour drink the menus are dirty; full of butter and food debris. But our server Brea is friendly and we're both restaurant managers, but we just got off so we're not doing that right now if you know what I mean. So, we order our drinks and the kids items as they are 1 and 3; its always easier to get them going. If you're a parent you understand. Once they eat, there's a small window where they are content to allow you to eat for a few minutes in peace. Well their food came out; they ate. Some time passed; they were getting antsy. Just as my husband and I are finally about to verbalize to each other the amount of time that we had waited, a man dressed in all black approached the table to regretfully inform us that they were out out an entree we'd ordered. We ordered something else. Remember that window I mentioned before? It came. And it went a long time ago. But we waited another 15 minutes. Here's where Brea fails. She sneaks up to the table and grabs our glasses and refills them ninja fast without making eye contact giving us a chance to ask about our order nor does she bother to communicate; something, anything. Op but here comes our food so forget it who cares. Oh wait, what? Taquitos and what? Oh, no wrong table. Sorry, that's not us but hey now let me just go ahead and speak to your manager. So, another 5 minutes goes by and now we just want any employee to come by so we can get the check for our drinks and kids meals. But not one employee passed by or even looked at our table until of course here comes our food and low and behold, guess what? ""Just kidding, I guess we had the chicken teriyaki afterall. So I just brought it all but I wont charge you for it."" So we waited for 55 minutes. The manager visited finally. He apologized, and didn't charge us for the items that they were out of,  but not out of, that we had to wait 55 minutes for. Yay us! We would have much rathered paid full price and not have waited. And then we look like asshole parents who let our kids do whatever they want; completely disrupting other guests. We had everything boxed up, paid the bill, and left.. communication is everything. Instead they tried to ignore it and they train-wrecked. We are super easy going; especially being in the business. This experience came down to training and communication or the lack thereof. Anyways we will return, just not this particular location."
Jaime B.,"Las Vegas, NV",109,101,402,4.0,2/5/2016,"Nice meal , service could be better, but they were very short in staff, no busser around, cant get same more bread, food come out fast!! We have to wait 15 min for a table, but is ok."
Dell C.,"Keene, CA",1,138,1,1.0,1/15/2016,"It took them forever to get our orders Although they are not busy. We waited atleast 20 minutes for Our drinks.  We ordered calamari and it was very salty, we only ate few bites.  The food we ordered with sauce are good.  It took us almost 2 hrs of stay there because the service was sooooo slow Our server is nice but have unpleasant odor. We wont come back"
