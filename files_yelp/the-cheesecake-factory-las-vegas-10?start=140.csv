Jennifer A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,26,9,5.0,4/17/2016,"Seated quickly. Everything was beautiful, had a nice quiet booth in the back. Our waiter ""KEN"" was funny, helpful & kind, hope to have him as our waiter from now on. The appetizers were amazing, we had calamari & fried zucchini. Our meals were herb salmon, swordfish, chicken & biscuit, pepperoni kids pizza, all very delicious. We saved room for dessert for my birthday where we had the Oreo & 30th anniversary cheesecake HEAVENLY! Our waiter KEN and about a half dozen or more waiters/waitresses joined in on singing me happy birthday & lighting a candle they had put in my slice. Nothing but great memories, thank you everyone at this location you're amazing !"
Laura A.,"Las Vegas, NV",85,8,3,1.0,4/10/2017,"The service and food was fine while we were eating there but our Togo meal was a hot mess to say the least. We ordered a dish with mushroom and asked for no mushrooms. After waiting about 10min for it to come out after we were done eating. We checked the order and it had mushrooms in it, the server said he did not hear no mushrooms, OK it happens so he had it remade which took about 15 more min. Really so it finally comes out. Did i mention that i have a 2 year old and an eight month old so patients are running thin, finally get home and my mom opens her dinner and what do you know MUSHROOMS. We called and spoke to a manager and they said sorry we will take it off your bill. Really just take that off my bill. We can have it remade for you if you would like but you will need to come and get it. But when you come please ask for Rob. Now I drove back and ask for Rob he had no idea what I was talking about with the order. AWESOME!! Retell the whole story and he is like sorry would you like a slice of cake!! Are you kidding me. I check it and finally it is right no mushrooms but interesting the sauce is a totally different color then the one we received, now I wonder Humm did they just try and pick out the mushrooms and not remake it. I'm a chef you can't fool me!! For real please and after all the bs it was not even good there was hardly any sauce on it and the pasta was so dry."
Zane I.,"Northwest, Las Vegas, NV",64,64,22,3.0,1/15/2016,"I can't be too unfair here, so I will leave at 3 stars and try again another time.  Servers were cut due to slow time (a week before xmas) around 9PM that night. Basically the service was super slow (reallllllly slow) and the food all tasted pretty bland. I had chicken parm, friend had jambalaya and also no Bueno.  Potstickers were yuck too. I don't know what was going on, maybe it was me, maybe it was them.  Regardless, I'm going to go back and give it another shot soon!"
Syrieta C.,"Henderson, NV",36,4,9,5.0,7/30/2015,Last night me and several of my coworkers went to Cheesecake Factory I have never tried it before The menu is 300 items long you have so many choices I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich with sweet potato fries and the chicken Parmesan was on a baguette which was awesome . I also received great service from our server the whole restaurant was packed but we still got fresh food and great service The portions are great for the price if you never tried cheesecake factory I highly recommend you do
Angela N.,"Las Vegas, NV",201,15,2,1.0,10/3/2015,"If I could rate this location with no stars, I totally would.. A million times.  Cheesecake Factory is one of those restaurants I get excited to go to. So, finding out that they had opened a Cheesecake Factory near my job had me hyped up. This location is by far has the worst service I have ever gotten in my life!! I usually just order pick up now a days since the servers abandon you and give you very poor service. Even the food sometimes makes me sick. I'm sorry, but I'm am very unsatisfied with this location."
Lisa P.,"San Diego, CA",14,199,1081,4.0,2/17/2016,"Food was good, we had the Thai lettuce wraps omg they are so awesome! These are my new favorite thing. We also had a double double cheeseburger and quesadilla with chicken and the Cajun pasta. All dishes were really good, however I will return for those Thai wraps so good. I would give the Thai wraps alone 5 stars. Our server was pretty good and she has a great personality which is rare these days. We will return. The only two things that were bad was the restroom was broken so the line for women's room was long. Plus the seating area in front not of the kitchen is weird since you can see the staff eating right there."
Eva J.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",51,4,,1.0,6/3/2016,"The service today was horrible. I called 20 mins before arriving to order a whole cheesecake for my family. Being told it would be ready when I arrived, I expected to walk in and out. I payed immediately after arriving and was told it would be ready in just a few minutes. Then over 30 mins later while my 4 year old, 3 month old twins, and husband waited in the car  I finally got the cheesecake I ordered. What made it worse was seeing the person that was ""supposed"" to be preparing it walk around and talk to people. Next time I'll find another place to order from...."
Jimmie W.,"Las Vegas, NV",138,23,138,4.0,1/4/2016,"the Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite places to eat, and now there is a closer location to the house. The service has always been good, food portions are good. a must place to eat. Did i Mention the Strawberry Lemonade.. it so soso sweet and good."
Faisal H.,"Fremont, CA",6,63,4,4.0,11/10/2015,I had lunch special shepherds pie and mocha latte Shepherds pie was outstanding Mocha latte was good Service was prompt and courteous Worth a second visit
Brian R.,"Oakland, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/8/2016,Want to simply give 6 stars to the bartender who recently moved to the west coast from Miami...  customer service for me and my lady. Showed love to Oakland and even said he would adopt our Raiders if they moved there! Keep up the great work my brother
Cindy W.,"Las Vegas, NV",317,111,191,1.0,7/25/2015,"As much as i would like to give my server a higher rating for having an awesome personality, i cant. Due to the fact that she messed up my order and the wait time was to long that my hunger went away (what a waste of money)   I ordered a kids Mac and Cheese,Deluxe Cheeseburger Sliders with bacon,and fried mac and cheese balls.  1/2 My order came  - my burgers had no cheese and bacon, the wait time was 15mins,and the waitress said sorry we couldn't figure how to add it into the system with out charging it (but i was charged anyways)  and my sons mac and cheese had no flavor, and i had to add salt.   And my fried Mac and cheese balls never came out, i had to finally ask the waitress  and she didnt even write it down.  I was pissed! So the wait time for that was another 15 mins.   My meal was ruined and when your dining with Toddlers, time is of the essence!  But what pissed me off is nothing was comp for my messed up order and the wait time.  This will be my last time dining at cheesecake factory."
Nadia H.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,39,,2.0,6/11/2015,"I have to agree with everyone else who has had issues with this particular Cheesecake Factory. I'm a huge fan of the chain and was excited when a location opened close to my work downtown. At this point, though, I can say my co-workers and I will probably never return to this one again. We were a party of 8 and arrived early, so we beat the entire lunch crowd in terms of getting seated and getting our orders in. When we ordered, I asked the waitress for bread and butter. 10 minutes later, we were all sitting around, still waiting for our bread and butter. 45 minutes after we had ordered, our food was still nowhere to be seen. When the food did begin to come out, it came in waves. Eventually, all but one of us had gotten our food. This was bizzarre because three people at the table had ordered salmon. Two got their salmon, the third was left waiting. It was a solid 7 minutes that we all sat around staring at our food as it grew cold while we waited for the final person to get her meal so we could all start eating.  The manager did come and appologize for this, and gave her a comped dessert, so that was nice. Another person's salmon ended up being completely burned on the bottom, so that had to go back and the manager her a comped dessert as well.  We were there for a celebreation, so when it came time to order dessert, several of us ordered cheesecake. I ordered a slice of the Banana Creme Cheesecake. They brought our cheesecakes, and I took one bite of mine and it was FROZEN. At that point, I was so over it I didn't even want to mention it to the waitress, but the rest of my party was fed up and told her as soon as she came over again. She made a face and informed us that the Cheesecakes are all freshly made. I poked the cheesecake with my fork to demonstrate and it made the classic ""crunch"" sound of a frozen cake, so she took away my cheesecake and was gone for another 10 minutes (this was the trend of the whole meal). When she returned, she asked if I'd like to have strawberry cheesecake instead. I said no thank you, can I please just have another slice of the banana creme? She then informed me that the banana creme was all frozen. So I ended up with no cheesecake. And all would have been well if that had been the end of it. I'd have left sad and disappointed, but not angry. No, the anger came when I got the bill and saw that my frozen, inedible, cheesecake that I had been forced to cancel was charged on the bill, and then marked as a ""comp."" Being forced to take back food because it is frozen is not a ""comp, "" that is bad customer service. It is insulting to your customers when you mark food as a ""comp"" when in fact they received nothing. I had one bite of frozen cake and was forced to send it back. You have not done me any favors by not charging me for that cake. That cake should never have been given to me in the first place.  Overall, the main dishes we did receive were the usual yummy quality of Cheesecake Factory. But getting our bread took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our desserts took forever, and getting our bill took forever. There is a serious managment issue going on with this location that needs to be fixed ASAP."
John D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,8/23/2016,"Adrian the bartender, probably one of the best I've seen.  Being a bartender myself. Great food and beer. Definitely be back!!"
Marcos F.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,10,17,3.0,3/14/2016,This was the least favorite of all the Cheesecake Factory's that I have eaten the service was okay the food was not as tasty for some reason as it is by the one by Summerlin. I had a margarita margarita drink that was not that strong at all. maybe I'm being a little too hard but I don't know it just didn't taste like the Cheesecake Factory that I'm used to. I did like the outside seating that was kind of cool.
Amber H.,"Las Vegas, NV",75,36,51,5.0,11/23/2015,I met a friend for a casual dinner on a Saturday night before going to a symphony at The Smiths Center. We sat at the and the bartender quickly gathered our order for some cocktails. The Tropical Martini tastes like you should be on a cruise ship.  The martini glass has a sugar rim and the fruit taste is very refreshing. We shared the Caesar salad and the firecracker salmon. The firecracker salmon is in a crisp wrapper that is very light and the salmon is soft and cooked well.  The Caesar salad is always good at Cheesecake Factory. Perfect blend of Parmesan and dressing. The bartender was attentive and checked on us appropriately.
Elisa V.,"Las Vegas, NV",105,9,5,5.0,2/15/2017,"I went for my second time last night with my hubby & the waiter, named Matthew, was amazing! He was so funny & everything we ordered got there quick. He was great at helping my indecisive husband make up his mind & our drinks seemed to never end (meaning he always refilled it at the right time) hahaha, definitely going back & hoping he's with us again! Matthew has an amazing attitude!"
Misty M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",241,81,67,5.0,5/18/2015,"Cheesecake Factory at the outlets downtown! What's not to like? I'll list what there IS to like first. 1) Giant covered patio with fans so you enjoy the outdoor feel, but are insulated from outlet traffic and direct sunlight. 2) Very willing and able to split checks. I went with 7 friends and our waiter offered to split the check for us; we didn't even have to ask. 3) Someone constantly checking on you. If my water glass hit 75% full, it was promptly filled back up. We were also asked at least twice if our food was all cooked to our liking. 4) Those bread baskets. If you haven't been to Cheesecake Factory and are opposed to chain restaurants, at least go enjoy a complimentary bread basket and a latte.  5) The food is delicious and amazing and they hit every price range. You can spend $50 on yourself for dinner, or $10 and still leave satisfied and happy.  6) Contrary to what most people would think, this is a great restaurant to go to if you're gluten-free or gluten intolerant. They mark menu items with a GF option so you can have a ton of items modified to be gluten-free (pasta, flat breads, sandwiches, salads, etc.). The only negative I can think of is the fact that this restaurant is crowded. I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate occasion. The customer to server ratio has got to be 5:1. I've never seen so many servers in one place. It's good because you get a ton of attention, but can be annoying when you're trying to walk to your table and walk to the bathroom and have to wait for a lot of people to pass."
Howie X.,"North Las Vegas, NV",8,35,32,4.0,5/21/2016,"Food was good , the kaluha chocolate cheesecake is recommended to try . The service could have improved a little by keeping eyes on our wine glasses .  Overall was a good experience at this location ."
Amanda D.,"Santa Monica, CA",88,71,68,2.0,5/29/2015,"This whole experience was a struggle. When the hostess was walking us to our table I overheard a waitress look at our party of 11 and say ""oh great"". Very warm welcoming... Being the chatty gal that I am, our server informed me that it had only been open for a week so I decided to give them a hall pass. We had 2 servers for a party of 11... is that really necessary?  Getting our drinks took forever, getting our food took forever, getting our separate checks took an eternity. What was supposed to be a quick work lunch break turned into a 2 hour meal. 3 of us ordered the same appetizer, mine came out first, then 10 mines later the second one came out with a noticeable smaller portion. I immediately notified I server (My side of the table had the competent server) and he directed the manager to come see us. The manager said he would give us another order gratis. When all the entrees came out, the 3rd appetizer came out. By the end they tried charging us for 4 appetizers. It was really just one thing after the other. And I get it, it was their first week open but it seemed like their staff had no industry experience. By the time we were heading out it was packed. I know this place is destined to do well because the Premium Outlets lack decent dining. Hopefully the staff gets better."
Mike E.,"Buckeye, AZ",23,74,15,3.0,8/2/2016,The food was excellent but that is about it it was 40 min to get in we waited 30 min to get are order taken only one refill never came back after are meal never asked us for cheesecake then had to gun down someone to bring us the check.  Where us the manager as we did not see one walking around or asking how was everything.  Just very poor customer service
