He's super friendly and very attentive!"
Angie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,1,1.0,10/24/2016,Worst experience ever!!! Don't get me wrong I love Cheesecake Factory but the customer service in this place was the worst. I went in with 8 of my closest friends because it was my birthday dinner on a Saturday night of course I was expecting it to be busy since that's how it usually is on Saturday nights in any restaurant. We went in and ordered a table for 8 took about 20-25 minutes. We sat down ordered what we wanted with drinks . Took them 25 minutes to bring out the drinks. They had already brought out the bread. Didn't even offer water while we were waiting. I had ordered extra sauce with my pasta. So they brought the pasta but no sauce. They came by once to say it's coming out but it took them 30-45 mins to bring it out by that time I was done with my dry pasta. No longer needed it. The worst part is that my friends had ordered a tirumasu cake as a surprised and the manager came up and told the whole table we are just waiting on the dessert... Really!!!!!! Just ruin the surprise. Very unsatisfied with the service here!!! Never returning I rather go to Summerline or Henderson Cheesecake Factory!!!
Halston G.,"Las Vegas, NV",59,57,9,2.0,7/10/2015,"This review is based on take out: When you call in to place a take our order, they don't give you the proper/correct time for your order to be ready. I placed a take out order three times since this location opened and all three times I had to wait. On one occasion I swore they placed the order as I got there like they forgot to put it in as I watched her pushed her buttons on her screen as she reread my order to confirm.  She then proceeded to give me my lemonade I ordered while I waited another 30 minutes (total of 1 hour wait since I ordered) for my food to arrive. I'm sure a lot of mall employees that orders food from here are on a timed lunch so it is very imperative they get their shit together."
Justin R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,12/28/2016,"Date: December 28, 2016 Time : Around 7:00-8:30 PM Company: 4 adults, 1 child I was excited to eat at Cheesecake Factory since most of my relatives were raving about the food quality and taste these guys offer. The waiting line was long since it's in an outlet mall so I already saw that coming. The receptionist informed me it would take around 40 minutes to get a table and we agreed.  We sat by the long bench BESIDE the recepionists desk because we didn't want to miss our names. 30 something minutes passed and I asked for an update. They said we were to be called next, just waiting for the table to be emptied, so okay. So far so good. A few minutes after, they called in a party of 5, then a party of 3, and then another party of 6. I was confused because they said we were next. Approached the employee who was informing guests that there were available bar stools for anyone who wants them. Rudely answered and argued with my brother. He was in my brother's face already, so I talked to the receptionists behind the desk. I was so shocked when they said they called us TEN TIMES ALREADY, the other said FOUR TIMES. WOW, talk about inconsistency. Again, we were seated BESIDE THE RECEPTIONISTS DESK. No way we couldn't hear them IF EVER THEY CALLED US. Asked for a manager, but he was impolite and inattentive. Tried explaining our situation and get an apology from him but what he did was straight on unprofessional. He shoved the paper with my name on it to let me know that we were getting a table now. The worst manager ever, or so I thought.... After seating at our table, another manager approached us, hoping for a better response, we tried explaining what happened, never listened, kept cutting our sentences and even had the nerve to tell us not to argue with him. We were explaining, not arguing. Even told us he'd talk to the crew right away, followed him with my eyes, he didn't even say a word to them. So arrogant and ill-mannered. Walked away without even apologizing.  They should thank the waitress they assigned to us. Made our experience a little tolerable.  SO I WANNA SAY THANK YOU, CHEESECAKE FACTORY FOR MAKING MY FIRST DINING EXPERIENCE THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Would have given no stars if it was possible."
Quentina P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",143,23,28,1.0,10/15/2016,"This was a terrible experience! I placed my first to go order from this location and was placed on hold to wait for the bakery for 3 minutes. When the bakery answers, there was no greeting just a very stern voice stating ""what can I help you with?"" I asked for mozzarella sticks, MY MISTAKE. She says ""we don't serve mozzarella sticks"". I advised her that I saw them on the menu and she then says ""we have fried cheese"". I said ok I'll take those. She said is that all? And I felt rushed by her tone,  I placed two entrées in a hurry. She asked again is that all. I said yes, do I need to pay she said no. As I started to ask for my total she ended the call in my face! So I called back to speak with the manager. I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and someone else answers the phone and asked me what she could assist me with. I asked if she was the manager, I was shocked when she replied ""is that what you're holding for?"" I said yes and she placed me back on hold a couple of minutes. Andrew, the manager answered, and I explained to him why I was upset, he also seemed to be in a rush to get me off the phone so he just gave me my total and said ""anything else I can assist you with?"" Wow.. I was in shock! What started with being a simple complaint about one person, ended with me being disappointed with four people at this location that did not handle me professionally. This tells me that it was not a problem with the girl in the bakery taking my order, it's the entire culture, that's the problem. She treated me as if my service wasn't important because with a staff like that clearly she hasn't been trained to do so. I am disgusted with this location and have absolutely no intentions of ever returning. People should feel valued when they spend money with any company considering how hard we work to make a living these days. And especially with how many other wonderful places there are here in Vegas that we can choose to dine at."
Danielle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,7,,4.0,5/28/2016,"Had dinner here the other night and everthing was amazing. Our server Christopher was outstanding, so helpful and friendly. My dish came out warm and I mentioned it to the server and he offered to have it heated for me, but it was fine I didnt want them to go through the trouble since it still tasted delicious.  The manager heard about my food being warm and came over to apologize and took the dish off our check. That was very kind of him, since I really didnt mind that much. I would definitely come back to this location again."
Brandi G.,"Las Vegas, NV",434,70,644,5.0,5/16/2015,So I got lucky enough to check it out pre opening! I'm watching the staff get trained and work at a team! Amazing training and teamwork here! Once this opens its gonna rock! I've always been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory! So far the little nibbles that I got to taste are awesome! I'll be lucky enough to come back next weekend and try out their soft opening and test out the full skills of the staff!! Looking forward to May 14th for this place to open! Good luck! Be prepared for my second review with the soft opening!!
Mandy C.,"Las Vegas, NV",190,25,26,1.0,6/3/2015,"Our server was terrible. Couldn't get the order right and even when he though he had it right, he brought a burger instead of the salmon... They never refilled our drinks, and in general took an extraordinarily long time. It took us an hour and we are fast eaters. Good is very inconsistent. This is our third time here ordering the same dishes and they taste different each time... Worst cheescake factory I've ever been to"
Andre S.,"Fontana, CA",0,26,41,4.0,6/8/2016,Food took a while to come out but altogether everything was good. Atmosphere is nice and they play good music. Server was pleasant.
Patrick A.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,132,95,5.0,6/24/2015,Can't go wrong with this place. It's located right next to the new entrance. Food and service always on point!
Mandy M.,"Henderson, NV",0,4,,1.0,9/21/2016,If it were possible to give zero stars this Cheesecake Factory would get zero. I work in this mall and order to go all the time the people that work in this bakery and take your Togo orders are extremely rude. Myself and all the people I work with won't be ordering from here again!
Hannah S.,"Manhattan, NY",9,8,11,5.0,1/13/2016,"Delicious! The menu is pretty overwhelming with so many choices so I wonder how good all their food actually tastes. Aside from that our food we had was incredibly delicious! I ordered the Almond Crusted Salmon Salad with Kale and other ingredients. Huge portions and very tasty. My partner ordered Parmesan Cheese Chicken which was also very yummy. We then grabbed a slice of Key Lime Cheesecake takeaway and oh my that was the perfect balance of zesty, sweet goodness!"
Carlos A.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,21,32,4.0,5/18/2015,"I was fortunate enough to go to their mock service and enjoy a meal with a guest. The food was delicious. I had the steak medallions and also the BBQ chicken salad. The medallions where booked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned perfectly, the salad was huge and more than enough for two. Since it was a practice run our server was immensely nervous. We waited a while, but thankfully I had time to spare. The food did take a little while to get to us , but that can be expected in a practice service. All in all our server was attentive and pleasant. For a hundred dollar tab on them all I can say is thank you Cheesecake  Factory!"
Scott S.,"Las Vegas, NV",104,8,,5.0,5/12/2016,I always love coming here to eat but when you get a server like Adrian Vera your experience is truly enhanced. This man is the definition of gentleman and made my family's Mother's Day better than I could imagine. Ask for him and I'm certain you will not be disappointed.
Rollie M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2016,"Where do I begin?! My wife and I ordered 2 cheesecakes to go. The employee takes my order and prints out the receipt. My wife changes her mind on one of the slices and we politely ask if we can change it before she even sliced a cheesecake. Already the employees bad attitude began. She gave a rude look like she didn't want to do it but did anyway. I bit my tongue and shrugged it off and said thank you when we got our 2 slices for take out. We walk around the outlet mall and notice one of the slices was a lot bigger than the other.  I had always thought cheesecake slices were huge and equal portions, I guess not. My wife and I were contemplating on exchanging it for equal slices since they were the same price at $7.95. We arrive back at the cheesecake factory with only 5 to 10 minutes passing by since us leaving. I did not wan't to deal with the rude employee so I approached a manager and he had asked if everything was fine. I explained I wanted to exchange the slice for a bigger portion since they were the same price. Get our moneys worth you know... Sam the manager said once a slice leaves the place they can't exchange it but he could give a discount at 25% if we would like to purchase a bigger piece. I agreed and had already pulled my debit card and he noticed my military ID thanking me for my service. I said thank you also. At the sometime the disgruntle employee is nodding her head in disgust as if we were trying to get a free slice. I couldn't hold my tongue anymore and said this is what I had to deal with earlier. Pointed to her and told him she is rude. He said don't worry I will take care of you and you can pick a slice and we will cover it. Let me explain I did not want anything free but I called my wife over and she picked out an oreo cheesecake slice. The employee had to cut the free slice for us but was still shaking her head. This made me more furious and I started to raise my voice. During all this commotion the employee was still nodding her head the whole time I was talking to Sam. There was at least 4 separate instances she did it. Sam said he would take care of her later. He also explained he would take care of us the next time we came in. He asked if we were locals. I said yes I have been stationed at Nellis, AFB more than 11 years. I still left pissed off. I don't care about the free slice. I would have paid for better customer service. This is ridiculous for an employee to act how she did even with the manager present."
Karlein N.,"North Las Vegas, NV",254,5,4,5.0,5/23/2015,Welcome to The North Outlets! Love this place like any other of their locations. Amazing restaurant and kitchen management tonight that did everything and more to help with our experience. Thank you for accommodating my family when our food wasn't up to par. Lovely servers! Shoutout to John and Lucas from Boca!
Tia Y.,"Cerritos, CA",0,4,2,4.0,5/24/2015,"Although our sever did inform us that this was one of the newer locations, I believe that the host stand could use a little work on customer service. My family and I were not asked and didn't feel as though we had an option on whether or not we wanted to sit on the patio, but we tried to make it work. We ended up asking for a different table on the patio and I completely understand having to deal with picky guests as I too work in the restaurant business, but if we had been offered the patio from the beginning we would have politely declined. Our server Skyler was AWESOME though. He had all the answers to the questions we had about the menu. He never looked bored or like he wanted us to hurry up. He was very attentive and we never had to ask for refills. In the end, I would say we were very well taken care of by Skyler."
Daniel G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,5.0,12/1/2016,"Love this place, live down the road and ordered a pickup today of the Luau Salad, had a little mishap mid meal once I got home. Called to explain the situation to one of the managers, Rob answered and took care of it with the utmost of professionalism and courtesy. Definitely a return customer."
Marisah B.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,4,2,5.0,10/17/2015,"Ebony's service was absolutely outstanding! She was so attentive, and in tune with all of our needs by just a quick glance. It wasn't all that busy (we were eating around noon on a Saturday morning), but she definitely started our day off the right way. Thanks so much!"
Christina T.,"Huntsville, AL",17,205,314,4.0,3/14/2016,"Met some friends here for dessert and they opted for dinner. My husband and I got our dessert within 5 minutes of ordering. Our friends waited 15 minutes or so for food but had bread to munch on. We had 2 servers while there, as the one initially serving us got off and switched shifts with our next server. Both were good. Our glasses stayed full of water and we were even offered more bread while we waited. Our desserts were good - it is Cheesecake Factory after all!"
