Teresa H.,"Jean, NV",0,6,,1.0,5/9/2017,"This location was an absolutely NO NO - a total disappointment.  The worst and most rude service I ever had at Cheesecake Factory.  I went with my mother and my daughter there for dinner.  I ordered my meal and coffee.  I asked for cream when my coffee arrived, and kept asking many times for it. At least 20 minutes later, still no cream.  My coffee was cold.  I checked with my server again.  He told me ""Just wait"".  The tables around us came after us were all served.  I was still waiting for my cream.  I then told my server to bring me a fresh cup of hot coffee when he brought the cream.  Another 10 minutes later, my cream was finally delivered without the hot coffee.  I asked him ""Where was my fresh coffee?"" He answered ""We had to brew it"".  I asked ""How long?"".  He ignored me by pretending not hearing.  Rather than wasting my time, I paid and left.  I am a big fan of Cheesecake Factory, I live in Summerlin and always frequent that location.  When I shop at the Forum Shop, I go to that Cheesecake Factory, but never will I visit this location again."
George L.,"Pomona, CA",2,5,6,4.0,3/14/2016,We always shop at this outlet but this is our first time we ate at this location. Our waitress Valentina provided excellent customer service. We have been many Cheesecake Factory and this is the best service.
Paul B.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,201,11,3.0,2/29/2016,"I ordered a chocolate truffle cake along with the chicken piccata with angel hair pasta. Companion companion bacon date wrapped pizza and tater tots. Tots where deep fried mashed potatoes, not the shredded or I just found tater tots did not like them as much. Companion like the richness of the bacon dates and cheese pizza, and we both enjoyed the chocolate truffle cake. Pros : a huge menu with many many items. Cons: no military fire police discount. Another con is the huge menu with many many items. It took more than several minutes to even there are down to two choices."
Nikki W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3,99,35,5.0,2/15/2016,Came here for lunch today and sat at the bar. The bartender gave excellent service. I'm a huge fan of peach vodka and unfortunately they don't carry peach Ciroc so he made me a Georgia peach drink with grey goose! It was AMAZING!! I got the lettuce wrap tacos Asian style. So delicious. I would deff recommend this place for a quick lunch. Sit at the bar you'll get great service.
Alicia P.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,14,19,5.0,7/19/2015,Good selection. Family friendly. You can valet or park on the north lot of the outlets level 2 otherwise you're in for a walk in this maze of stores. Kids menu had lots to choose from.
Heather S.,"Las Vegas, NV",32,37,19,4.0,2/24/2016,"You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. Only bad thing is how it was designed. They have multiple rooms unlike the other Cheesecake Factory locations this one is smaller. Food is always the same and consistent. Avocado egg rolls, bam bam chicken and chicken Madeira you won't go wrong."
Pam H.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",46,17,6,5.0,9/20/2015,Jessica with the glasses was amazing. Being swamped with tables and still made us feel like a priority. Amazing service and very pleased.
Gina V.,"Henderson, NV",2,28,2,1.0,6/9/2016,"Found a hair on the side of plate and just took it off thinking it was my own but then in the middle of my entree while cutting up a piece of shrimp another hair emerged and it was buried within the sauce of my dish. It was taken by a server, never heard an apology or if they were going to make another dish. As well as I didn't even get to explain what happened. Long after the rest of my party ate, a manager (I assume since she wasn't in a uniform) brought out my food and placed it on the table as quickly as she could and left without saying anything. Six out of the seven people at our table needed refills and didn't receive it until we flagged down our server. Then at the end of the meal, the bill came out where they ""comped"" the first ruined entree with a hair in it and charged me for the one they made after. I'm not one to try to get a free meal but with poor service there was no reason to even charge me for something that had a hair in it, no attempt at finding out what happened, I didn't even asked for it to be made again, and no apology. We asked for a manager since nothing was being addressed at all and they just comped it without even coming to the table and again no one apologized."
Monica U.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,78,79,5.0,7/30/2015,"We love The Cheesecake Factory it never disappoints.  Everything they have is amazing.  Today in honor of national cheesecake day we decided to dine here for date night.  I had the pear and endive salad from their low calorie menu. It is not on the regular menu,  I allowed for a side of balsamic dressing as the low cal version is tasty but needed a tad more.  I'm not a drown your salad type of salad eater but adding a spoonful more didn't hurt anything, the salad was fantastic.  My hubby had the Imperial chicken dinner with white rice and fried shrimp.  The chicken was delictible it melted in my mouth.  Because we were going to get cheesecake we didn't order or normal appetizer which is the avocado egg rolls.  If you ever want something off the chart order some of these and you will be happy you did.  The new location was convenient to shopping and parking.  The soda  machine was out so we ordered water with lemon it was very good not that normal yuck restaurant water..  We got the cheesecakes to go and we are super stuffed.  Oh yeah please request James as your waiter, he was amazing and we were so impressed with his service and suggestions.  He made our meal even more enjoyable we will be back."
ron c.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,53,41,4.0,8/7/2016,"An interesting experience.  Our party of 12 decided to have brunch here since it was our mothers choice for her birthday.  We checked in and waited a few minutes to have our table ready.  Kelsey a female server greeted us with water and mentioned she was assisting Mike the server who is taking care of our party.  Mike greeted us a few minutes after bread was served to take drink and appetizer orders.  We also got the kids food started while the adults needed a few more minutes to look over the menu.  Drinks were delivered promptly and appetizers were great but we're missing one child's meal (sliders).  There were no check back on appetizers so I mentioned the missing kids meal to MOD Dawn to cancel the order.  Our server took the adults food orders and staging was preset.  During food delivery there were a 2 ribeye steak entrees  overcooked as it was ordered medium rare and arrived as medium well.  MIKE took steaks away and fired new steaks.  Nick the other MOD came over and communicated the situation.  The new rib eyes were also delivered by nick and ensured to our liking.   Kelsey and Mike were doing great table touches, refills, and pre bussing our table.  We ordered a dessert for mom and the crew came to sing to her. Kelsey assisted to close out our check.  Dawn did a final check back on our party and gave me a business card.  I thank the staff for doing a great job on taking care of our party.   Will see you soon"
Holly F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,27,,4.0,9/15/2016,"Had a great lunch today, fried calamari, a burger & Chinese chicken salad.  Hubs and I took home cheesecake, of course.  Peter, our server was so nice, very efficient and put up with a lot of grief from some German tourists next to us.  It's a busy place but the food is concistantly good.  Note to self: always valet park, the parking garage is packed!"
Kaveida A.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,35,22,4.0,2/18/2016,"I've visited this location several times during lunch hour between 1pm - 2pm.  Service has always been fast and courteous.  Always get the Cobb salad, super delicious.  Portion sizes are large here."
Juliana Y.,"Pasadena, CA",379,419,1839,3.0,7/15/2015,service was good.. we were seated right away.. our server was nice.. it's been a while since ive been to a chain restaurant and ive got to say.. i do not miss it.. the food is just so bland.. we ordered the ahi cappacio which was good but a little too much mayo for me.. the fish tacos had no taste.. and the thai lettuce wrap was just ok.. we ended up packing most of the stuff to go..since i felt bad if we were just to leave it.. our plan was to look for a homeless guy =(    the bread and butter was amazing though.. =)
Karina M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,9,12,3.0,7/25/2015,"A little busy but at the end of the day, they have pretty good service. The have is a free cheesecake because of wait time. There lunch specials are delicious and the ceasar salad is amazing."
D. B.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,79,123,1.0,2/12/2016,"Horrible service tonight , we just ate at there Henderson location next to our house last night. Excellent service. But this location at the north outlets sucks"
Yukie Y.,"University, Las Vegas, NV",110,9,10,1.0,4/12/2016,"Food is good as always, service is awful! Just awful. We were sitting outside, our server intentionally ignored us EVERY time we call him. Didn't catch his name, never once came back ask how our meal was. Not sure if he did this because we are Asian or they just hire people with low service standard now. Will not return to this location ever in my life!!!:("
Kelly C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,2,2.0,10/5/2015,"They need to improve their service. It took 20 mins to cook 2 dishes even the restaurant was only60%full. My husband found a piece of paper in his food, the manager offer to bring him a new dish but it took another 15 mins to get it. Server forgot everything, we have to repeat twice to get what we want from them. I always going back to cheesecake factory BUT not for this branch."
Amy T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",10,17,29,5.0,10/18/2015,I miss dining at Cheesecake Factory! Now that they opened nearby where I live I can go dining more often. Very good food at Cheesecake Factory and the service was great!
Rich K.,"San Mateo, CA",31,69,9,5.0,10/2/2015,Never would I have ever thought I would give the cheesecake factory 5 stars. I had an incredible experience here the other night when we were in a time crunch for a show. Dawn Barrett met us at the door and could tell we were in a rush. She expedited food and drinks. Miso Salmon was incredible! Everything came out hot and quick. She was friendly and went way above and beyond for us. She needs to be praised by leadership. She turned us into loyal customers. Thank you Dawn.
