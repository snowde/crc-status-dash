Rachelle M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,3,1.0,7/27/2016,"So this will be the second time I've had an issue with bugs at this Cheesecake Factory location. The one star was only for the food b/c I really enjoy most Cheesecake Factory locations and I can't post without at least one star..The additional "" inside"" seating area that has large opening around the front of the restaurant seems to be suffering from this problem the most. Small insects in the salt shakers with flies tasting your food. As for tonight when I clearly stated I didn't want to sit in that area I was directed to the outside/Inside area again.. I was told I would be put at the end of the seating list and would have a long wait if I refused the table, even with my complaint of my last visit the young hostess continued to seat us in the area stating it wasn't outdoors. To sum it all up I ended up being seated directly against the opening to  the outside with bugs crawling on the back seat cushions and spiders on the sides while my food was being served..! Needless to say I don't think I'll be back to this location anytime soon."
Brad C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,18,4,1.0,5/31/2016,"Food is fine and tastes the same as all other Cheesecake Factory's.  That is not the issue.  The issue I have is the way this location was designed.  The front door is near valet to the mall where only 100 cars can park. The other 10,000 parking spaces are located elsewhere and lead directly into the mall.  But the back door to the Cheesecake factory is closer to the actual mall and much more convenient for people to enter and leave the restaurant.  Half the seating in this location is located in the row going from the check-in to the back door.  And this is the only seating where they allow children.  So as your eating you literally have 100's of people walking back and forth past your table to enter and leave the restaurant.  No one uses the front door since it leads out to the street and the mall is the other direction.  Now add a stroller with a sleeping baby in it.  We usually ask for a table away from others so our child is not a distraction.  We know what it was like before we had a child.  But this place was packed and we had to take the only available table which was a booth.  So we placed the stroller plush against the front of the booth since our child was asleep.  But now with 100s of people coming in and out the back door we closed traffic to one way since the stroller was there.  Now the manager noticed the interruption of bodies moving because of the stroller and was about to ask us to move it down the hall when he realized our son was asleep in it.  So I asked him to make the back door an exit only like most businesses.  And he tried explaining it is a fire hazard which is not true.  it is only a fire hazard if it is locked and you can not get out.  So this meal was certainly not relaxing and not enjoyable.  Trying to make sure people do not run into the stroller and eat at the same time is not fun.  They are more worried about losing customers because they cant actually find the front door to this location than making the people their comfortable.  And if they had told us from the get go their was no place to sit with a stroller we would have gone somewhere else. Lola's is across the street and has the best cajun food around."
Lizzie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,5,,4.0,8/15/2016,"Decided to finally try this place. For 3 adults and 3 kids the price wasnt that bad. It looked well-kept. We got 2 Bacon- Bacon cheeseburgers which were big with some fries, the teriyaki chicken, a cheese pizza for one of the kids, grilled cheese sticks for another and mini corndogs for the last one. They were all good. The teriyaki chicken was a bit dry and needed a little bit more favor added to it, the pineapple that came with the chicken was super sour so wasnt touched after I tried it, the mini corndog meal for the kids were just three little things on a stick with a tiny bowl of fruit and that was gone in no time and the kid was still hungry. (News flash some kids eat more then others.. the kids menu goes from I wanna say 4 to 10 years old.. but that is too little for a 9 year old.. come on). The service could have been a little better we were sitting there a good 20 minutes before we could even get dessert. The kids hot fudge sundae was just two tiny ( barely there )scoops of icecream with a little bit of chocolate chips, and fudge on it and cost $3.50 ( again some kids can eat more). But besides all that. It was a very interesting place and we will be back soon."
Rob P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,24,,2.0,8/12/2016,Took my family to Cheesecake Factory last night. The food was ok ... not great but not bad. I ordered their $12 hamburger with sweet potato fries. When it was delivered the waiter told me that I had ordered a salad. Our family just laughed cause they heard me order the fries. No big deal. I told him that I would need some ketchup to put on my hamburger and at least 15 minutes passed until he came back with the ketchup and at which time he said... I'll get those sweet potato fries ordered for you. I told him to forget it as it was too late. We were already done eating and were ready to leave. I asked him for a to go container for my daughter's barely uneaten entree and again 10 minutes later I had to ask a busboy to bring one over. Our water glasses were never refilled and were totally empty after 5 minutes after we sat down.  He's lucky I left him a 10% tip (I normally tip 20 - 25%). Won't be going back to this location...
Jada C.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,7,2,2.0,1/4/2016,Overall the waiter was great until the food came. My kale salad was salty. We sat next to the kitchen and the salad was sitting for some time. By the time the dishes came the buffalo blast were over fried as if the grease was old.  So the server took it back. Within 2 minutes they brought out the same blast that I just sent back. When they finally brought the blast out they looked the same.  If anyone has ever had an order of buffalo blast they are very light with a hint of chicken and a blast sauce inside.  So of course I didn't want them 20 minutes later.  The bun on the bacon burger was hard as if it was stale. The bacon burger had 2 strips of regular bacon and literally 2 small squares of applewood bacon ;(. When the waiter brought out the check he took off the order for the blast but added an order of buffalo wings that no one ordered.  The only thing that was worth the trip was the bread and butter. Of course the check was adjusted but we were really disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory.   Thank goodness for Winchells being open 24 hours. The wings are amazing
Arlette S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,33,,5.0,11/11/2015,My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for the Sema show and Thursday night we were hungry so we stop by the cheese cake factory we had this waiter his name is Vaughn and oh WoW Wow Wow Wow I was impressed by his service and his mannerisms all I can say that Vaughn can work anywhere .... We have been to so many restaurants and no one has ever giving us the service Vaughn  did his great and I hope the best for him. Now days is hard to find people the give u good customer service because I know from experience working with the public can be challenging at time but Vaughn was amazing wow 2 thumbs up for this guy !!!!
Karen S.,"Grantville, San Diego, CA",14,3,,4.0,10/22/2015,"Food was delicious, great service as always but very loud music that makes it hard to have a conversation. Waitress politely informed me that they could not turn it down."
Spring E.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,1,5.0,11/24/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is fairly new, and the food is just as great as the one in Henderson.  The service was equally great, with friendly staff and servers checking to make sure our needs were met.  We will be having our office Christmas party at this location in a few weeks...can't wait!!"
David M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,13,3,5.0,8/24/2015,"Came in to Vegas for business. Andrew was such a great waiter. He made sure I was taken care of, very genuine guy. Food came out fairly quick and was great! I will definitely be coming back here since I come out to Vegas once a month. Chopped salad, no corn sub blue cheese for goat cheese, and sweet potatoe fries! Do it!"
Nerina O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,2.0,8/21/2015,This is our first time coming to this location..had the worse experience ever.  To start with they ran out of avocado roll..then they came back and told us they ran out of wings...really being a huge franchise you run out of the main appetizer...will not be coming back to this location
Rob T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,1.0,11/13/2015,"Not your grandma's Cheesecake Factory we all got to know and love.  Those good old days are long gone, my friends.  You're better off turning around, heading back to the Food Court and buying yourself a Subway sandwich."
B R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,5/9/2016,"Been waiting to take the fiancee and son out for Mother's Day all week. This was our worst experience with any restaurant yet. Peter, our server, was awesome. The rest of our experience was a nightmare. Waited 30 minutes to be seated then over an hour for our food, which was cold and stale. Served my son hard, stale, and cold french fries. His chicken sliders were lukewarm and stale also. Our entrees came out 15 minutes after his and everything on our plates was lukewarm. We waited over an hour. Then the mgr comes over, introduces himself and states that he could have our food reheated. WTF? I don't want lukewarm stale food to be reheated. We just wanted fresh hot food. At this point we decided to leave. After ruining my fiancee's Mother's Day, they douche bag mgr still charged us for our drinks and appetizer. We will never revisit this location ever again and possibly never another cheesecake factory ever. Mother's Day only comes around once a year and ours was ruined by inconsiderate and unempathetic management. The one star is for Peter the server because he rocked."
Maria U.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,17,2,5.0,6/6/2015,"Love this Cheesecake Factory !!!! The food was fresh, and the service is great. The waiter Jared was very friendly, attentive, and prompt with orders. Will be back soon!"
CreatIng S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,12,2.0,12/5/2015,There hasn't been a CF restaurant that I've met that I didn't like until this one. I'm a lover of this restaurant chain. Love the steak Diane. I've gone there three times not wanting to not like them. Located in the Outlet Mall near downtown Las Vegas the newest CF in Las Vegas. Everything I tried this last time was too little or too much. The beet and goat cheese salad. Beets were over cooked and smushy. I've never had smushy beets. They were also too salty. Too few pieces of pecans and goat cheese. The dressing had too much vinegar and too little oil. I ordered the steak medallion instead of the steak Diane off the skinnylicious menu. The serving was too small and again too too much salt. I was done after two bites. I tried my daughters buffalo chicken appetizer. Again too salty. She had a side of the buffalo sauce. Guess what too salty. My strawberry lemonade that I always get several refills was too sweet. I don't know what's going on with this location but I am not in too much a rush to go back. I hope they get it together because I love the chain and it is usually a good choice when I travel.
David G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,6/21/2015,"First time going,  after hearing a new location opened up, and having heard such great things about them in general ,me and my family (6 of us) decided we would finally see for ourselves. Well from the moment we sat down to the moment we left (almost running out the door) we had the most disappointing experience. John M. was our server and came to take our drink order first,  everyone else ordered soft drinks and i ordered a apple cider,  5 minutes later drinks arrived except mine, was told it was coming next,  10 more mins passed was asked if anyone had brought my cider yet and was again told ""right away"" another 5 mins passed before i received my drink only to receive a glass half the size as everyone else's and with no ice at all, (room temperature apple juice). Finally we all put in our orders, 3 of us ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with a mix of chicken and shrimp , after waiting 45 mins we were served. The pasta was already starting to harden, the chicken had no flavor, the shrimp was chewy and the Alfredo sauce was watery, as if the pasta was not strained all the way. At the end 5 of us were very disappointed with our meal and our server noticing our not too pleased faces decided to ask the manager if he could comp 2 desserts. Dessert was the only thumbs up we gave for the night, but even dessert couldn't stop us from wanting to run out of there! I agreed with my sister when she said ""never again!"""
Christina W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,11/19/2015,"Yesterday was my 25th birthday and the day before was my 3 year wedding anniversary so my husband and I decided to celebrate at my new favorite place, the cheesecake factory. And being Vegas locals why not go to the new one so that we can shop at the outlets right after. Lets start off by saying I'm 9 months pregnant so waiting for food for too long is not my best friend. We came in and it took a second to be greeted by the host because she found whatever she was doing to be more important. After she was done she did greet us and we waited to be seated. Our host came and showed us to our seat and said our waiter would be with us shortly. So to kill time we started talking until we noticed it had been 5 min already and no one has acknowledged us yet , but we saw plenty servers walking by. My patience started wearing thin as an additional 10 minz had went by and weren't offered so much as a hello, a drink, NOTHING. so I finally asked a girl if I can speak with the manager and instead of going to get he or she, she replied ""oh I'm your server give me a minute they seated three of y'all at once"". First that's very unprofessional, second don't think that because we're both African american that I'll just be ok with that and let you talk to me the way you feel comfortable, and third if you were so busy its not that hard to COMMUNICATE that with your guests. So of course I took my business elsewhere so thanks a lot for wasting my time that I can never get back and ruining my birthday and I will be sure to yelp you folks as well. Very poor customer service"
