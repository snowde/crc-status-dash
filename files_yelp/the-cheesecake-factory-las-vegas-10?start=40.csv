Sabrina N.,"Long Beach, CA",91,17,2,1.0,10/18/2017,"So very Disappointed! My boyfriend and I came in after a walk from Fremont to have a beer and cool down before shopping, after I was done I paid for my two beers with an American Express gift card (The bartender told me when she gave me the receipt to sign that there was $52.87 left on it) we left went shopping and then headed back to our hotel once there I realize I left my gift card behind at the restaurant (While shopping my boyfriend paid for everything) i called the restaurant immediately and the bartender told me that I took my gift card with me I wrapped it in my receipt and walked away. the reason I'm very disappointed because I don't have a habit of bringing my restaurant receipts with me so I know for sure I didn't do that I clearly remember leaving it in the cup it's very sad to have things stolen  from you."
Kara L.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,16,,2.0,6/10/2017,"Generally when you go to chain restaurants, you expect the same delivery in taste and experience on the whole. Unfortunately this location did not. My boyfriend and I went after a lovely show at the Smith Center and it let out about 10pm. We wanted to go eat somewhere nice and conveniently close. As we love our Cheesecake Factory at Green Valley Ranch, we decided to try this location based on our great experiences with the other locations. Great factor was that it was open till 12am but downside is that even though there were not so many people on a Friday night, the service was very slow. We usually get our favorites, Avocado Spring Rolls, Bistro Shrimp Pasta and Rib Eye Steak.  The Spring rolls were delicious as is the sauce which is easily devoured! But the Bistro Shrimp pasta was really spicy! Now this is supposed to be a general garlic and wine sauce with no spicyiness at all. It had way too much red chili peppers! My mouth was on fire!  The steak was burned but my boyfriend ate it anyways since he was hungry. When the server asked about the meals I let him know of the issues but all we got was a 'Sorry' (It wasn't his fault for the food though) and only 5% off the bill. If you want the traditional Cheesecake Factory yumminess, don't go to this location as it lacks the quality and taste."
Kimberly M.,"Anaheim, CA",3,25,18,2.0,10/8/2017,I love cheesesteak factory food.  My shrimp scampi was so good!  However the parking for this location is insane!  I ordered curbside to go.  It's not really curbside to go because you have to go in.  Then the parking area is teeny tiny.  Unless you have a compact car don't even try it.  The three parking spots only fit two small vehicles so I could not park.  The whole circle was full of valet cars waiting to be parked.  The valet full sign was blocking the entrance.  I even tried to park in the parking garAge next to the Cheesecake Factory and it was completely full.  I called the Cheesecake Factory and they said they would have valet keep my vehicle on the curb.  But seriously it stressed me out.  I will never go to this location again.
Victor A.,"Las Vegas, NV",127,216,141,4.0,10/3/2017,"We went down to Cheesecake Factory ahead of a busy day of shopping and a show at the Smith Center. I usually don't like Cheesecake Factory because they tend to take a bit longer to serve you, but this time it was super speedy. We ordered some lunch specials and a Shepherd's Pie. The Pie was really good, although it was a bit fancier than some of the Pies I've ordered at other places before. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal. The food was good, the service was good, the speed and price were right -- really, nothing to complain about. The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars is that I was not wowed by anything, but I do appreciate that everything was solidly good."
Maya R.,"Las Vegas, NV",49,5,2,2.0,8/7/2017,"Came in around 9:50 pm and it was a short wait to get seated thankfully. We ordered our food quickly but the food didn't come out for 20 minutes. We finished our bread and asked for more while waiting but the bread never came until we already had our food and had to ask a busser boy because our waitress was too busy or something.  I ordered the Baja Chicken Tacos. worst decision ever! The tortillas were very doughey and the rice had barely any taste. So i traded my brother for his Fettucine Alfredo because he didn't like it and you can never going wrong with that right? Wrong! The chicken had zero seasoning along with the pasta in general. Everyone at my table had something wrong with their food, from hard spinach to doughey pizza.  At the time we got our food it was too late to even ask for them to remake it since they close at 11 pm! Plus we were starving.  The only thing that convinced me to give CCF 2 stars is how friendly the hostess was!"

Jay W.,"Vancouver, WA",24,640,605,3.0,10/28/2016,"Cheesecake Factory seemed to be the perfect place to meet others for lunch.  It's located in the North Vegas Outlet Mall,  We were early so ordered the quesadilla as an appetizer.  That should have been our lunch.  The appetizer shared by two was delicious and there was a lot of it.  We had expected the hot jalapeno peppers to be on the side but they weren't.  We had to dig them out.  The lunch caesar's salad was delicious but also huge. The air conditioner kept it very cold .. probably perfect for workers but not for guests.   Server was okay, not great.  We had to remind her about items a couple times."
MagGic C.,Hong Kong,24,6,7,5.0,7/28/2017,Excellent service and food here. Enjoy the food very much. We got a surprise offer for a free slice of cheesecake on next purchase.
M E.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,3,1.0,12/13/2017,"Charmaine was our server! Awful experience!!!! First she never went to our table to greet us, then when I finally went to the hostess she told the server that we had been there for over 20 min, then she came with an attitude to get our drinks and walk away without even ask if we were ready to order, when she came we told her that we were ready for some appetizer and she said well I'm not ready yet! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?! With our food I ordered a burger with a salad instead and the salad never made it to the table, with our dessert we want it the chocolate cake with a chocolate milk shake split for 2, that never happened! In the end really disappointed and upset! Never again I'm going there."
Rachael D.,"Spanish Fork, UT",52,36,28,5.0,3/15/2017,"One of my favorite places to eat -- love the avocado egg rolls! Hubby enjoys the Cajun seafood jambalaya. And the cheesecake, oh, the cheesecake! YUM! I love the mango key lime!   At first I was disappointed in our waitress - we thought she had forgotten about us when she went to refill my Sprite, but she was changing the syrup so it wasn't straight soda water and the syrup spilled all over her - poor thing! She couldn't apologize enough for the accident, very sweet."
Latrice S.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,60,,4.0,9/22/2016,"The service quality has definitely been stepped up here. The servers are nice and very friendly. Cheesecake Factory is pretty standard so the food is always consistent.  I have rarely had to wait for a table here, and this location is fairly busy. So a great spot to come for a quick bite. I always request to be seated in Kelly's area, she's really great and is very attentive.  Come for the yums!"
Echo B.,"Las Vegas, NV",141,121,341,3.0,2/8/2017,"Food was great, as usual. Service at this one, could be better. I believe they only take reservations for large parties during slow times (during the week). I called ahead and made reservations for my birthday last week since I had all my family coming to celebrate. They said they had me marked down. I got there and they told me there were no reservations under my name for that night. The lady at the front tried to give me a hard time. Luckily it was on a Wednesday night, so it didn't take them too long to get some tables together for us. Our waitress was friendly and nice. Wish she would've came and checked on us more tho. Overall, wasn't the best service for a Cheesecake Factory as I've been to all of them around town."
Isabel C.,"Sonoma, CA",302,109,675,4.0,12/20/2015,"Whoever thought of putting a sit down restaurant in a shopping outlet is a genius! Sometimes we just need a break from all the fast food even when we're on the go (but don't get me wrong I love me some Panda Express still).  This location is just like every other ones I've been to, which isn't a bad thing! It wouldn't be Cheesecake Factory if it wasn't big in size, portion, and in choices. Even the lunch portion size fills you right up! The taste is always on point and consistent so you never have to worry.  Their service is always great! From the moment we walked in, we were constantly handled with so much care. The only thing is that our food took 20 minutes to come out. But our server Jessica made sure to check up on us and apologized for the wait! If you're going to be shopping off the calories, doesn't that mean this place is worth the visit?"
Melissa S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",13,14,24,1.0,1/25/2017,I love I mean love their cheesecake! Craig's carrot cheesecake is definitely my favorite but the time before last I went and got the Craig's carrot cake cheesecake and it was 90 percent carrot cake so this time I just wanted the cheesecake... I ordered the original cheesecake and from the get go the employees acted like I was bothering them.... Not a good welcome! Anyway I take the original cheesecake home and try to eat it.... Super mushy and the top was half cream cheese.... Now I could have gotten a firmer better tasting cheesecake from Jack in the box or Carl's jr.... I was highly disappointed with this trip to the cheesecake factory! I will give them another try but it will be a while when I spend almost $8 for a slice and I'm unbappy
Cecilia C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",1,16,69,4.0,6/3/2017,"This is the first time we didn't have to wait for a table at Cheesecake Factory. We were shopping at the outlets during Memorial Day Weekend, and wanted to grab dinner at the outlets before returning to The Strip. The service was fast and the food was decent. Will definitely return if we are shopping at the outlets."
Gene X.,"San Francisco, CA",524,1125,735,5.0,9/22/2016,"So we hit up Cheesecake Factory since we were in town for the Olympia, and my friend Branka had competed for the first time in the most prestigious bodybuilding event in the world and was starving for cheesecake.  Branka and I got four cheesecakes in total: Chocolate Tuxedo Cream, Ultimate Red Velvet, Original and a Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake.  I had the Kahlua one and it was so rich I couldn't finish it! Our waiter was fantastic too - Shawn R and was pleasant, on top of things and really friendly.  Definitely was a good way to cap an intense weekend!"
Kaylo-Green J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,1,5.0,9/20/2017,"Went in just for a quick appetizer and juat spend quality time with my mother and grandma, Which we ended up having the best server by the name of Tosha , shes very professional and hospitable. She catered to our every need and was also easily approachable ! If you visit this location please ask for her :D"
Marianne T.,"Las Vegas, NV",128,7,7,1.0,4/3/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, and was craving for some pasta. So, I ordered their Louisiana Chicken Pasta in hopes that it will satisfy my cravings. I ordered the food to go, and half way through eating it, I found a hair on my food. Mind you, I am a female with long brown hair, and this strand that I found was a short, thick, black hair. Definitely not mine! It made me gag, and I was sooo disappointed. I'm not one to write a bad review on Yelp, but I was just really disappointed this happened."
Rainier F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",114,57,72,4.0,7/5/2016,"tldr We go to this location often and it's always pretty busy but the staff is very attentive and consistent with following up. Got: -orange chicken: I usually can't finish this entire dish because of how big the serving is! Come with a small medley of carrots and string beans with a strong zesty orange flavor throughout. Protip: don't go so hard on the bread basket, the entree portions are very generous and filling."
Demetria B.,"Las Vegas, NV",233,96,104,4.0,8/1/2016,"I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan since '98, it is a serious addiction.  I used to catch the #11 bus downtown transfer get on the trolley from EAST San Diego to Fashion Valley Mall that's how serious it WAS and IS!  B So on to the review: I really like this new location at the premium outlets, $6 for valet parking (so worth it).  Just like other CF locations there was a wait to be seated in the restaurant area BUT the bar area is open availability.   The lunchtime options is more than enough food for a lunch portion.  I ordered SHEILA'S GRILLED CHICKEN & AVOCADO salad.  This lunch portion can be split in two, salad is tossed with a citrus honey vinaigrette.  Piled high are mixed greens, grilled chicken, cashews, shredded carrots, red onion, crunchy tortilla strips, cilantro and of course AVOCADO!  No need to search for the chicken, every stab of the fork you come up with piece of chicken.  Remember, this is ONLY the lunch portion, the dinner size might feed an entire table of 4, ijs.  The salad was DRESSED not soggy, still had crisp to the lettuce and crunch to the cashews. for dessert: SALTED CARAMEL CHEESECAKE Um, yea...I kind of was disappointed with this selection, for me personally the graham cracker crust was too thick, the base was basic, what made it salted caramel was that a layer of caramel sits atop of the cheesecake.  Yea, that's all I have to say about that Of course the cheesecake does not effect the star rating, I will just try a different cheesecake, they have over 20 different flavors.  But this is just my opinion , go try it out you might go giddy over the salted caramel cheesecake."
