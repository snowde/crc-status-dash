Trina M.,"Fresno, TX",102,380,58,2.0,7/8/2016,"M'kay, so, like - I'm probably one of only five other people on the PLANET who'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Why?  Dunno - just haven't, sue me.  Well, this location is in the Vegas Premium outlet center and after losing my mind in Michael Kors and other stores, it was time to eat and get out before I had to get a 2nd mortgage on my house to support my shopping habit.   Anyhoo - the atmosphere is nice, decor is great - the low marks I give this are for the 1) service and 2) regular food.  I have been to the sister spot, Grand Lux and GL seems to be better to me.  As far as service, our waiter was SLOW and had attitude.  It took forever to just get water, he forgot to bring bread to our table and when I told him one of the things I wanted was for to-go he got snippy with a 'you should have said that first' - UM, excuse me?  Anyway, the salad I ordered to eat there was over chopped - that may be weird to say but I like to see whole leaves in my salad - this one was over chopped like shredded lettuce in the store.  But it tasted good.  My friend ordered these buffalo chicken tenders that for some reason had the buffalo sauce on the inside - nah - I gotta skip that in the future, that's just not right to do to chicken.  BUT - the Turkey burger is BAE!!!  That tasty somenother gave me LIFE!!!!!  The caramelized onions on it are the thing dreams and rainbows are made of...... mind you I ate this later on in the day in my hotel room after several rounds of drinks but trust me, my taste buds know good burgers even if they are reheated.  There is location near my house and I intend on stopping in to grab some cheesecake (the one thing I did NOT do on this visit) - so we'll see if I feel better about them then.  Otherwise, pass for me, I'll Grand Lux it out."
Christine S.,"Las Vegas, NV",256,204,843,3.0,2/27/2016,"I thought it was pretty neat that there's a Cheesecake Factory at the North Premium Outlets. After a long day of shopping, a good meal is always a great idea. I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad & it was good. The serving was huge & it was tasty. My party of 17 was seated in the extended seating section. The area is more private, less busy, not as noisy, more windows, & the lighting was brighter. It was great to be seated there, but we were also forgotten by our server. After ordering our meals, she didn't come back to check up on us & we had to call another server to get her attention a couple times (or even requested for items from a different server since that seemed quicker).  Despite this, the food was good, their free bread is delicious, & the ambiance was like all the other Cheesecake Factory chain."
Shawna P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",24,6,,1.0,9/10/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever visited. Bathrooms were filthy. I asked one of the hostesses to please send someone to clean them and she said they were just cleaned!  Although the waiters were friendly, He never did get my drink order correct. I finally just drank what he brought me. Food service was slow. Except for the waiter, the rest of the staff I encountered was rude."
G.A V.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,1,3.0,9/7/2017,"Food is outstanding, menu very diverse, didnt like being taken to back seating area where it appeared they sit all families with children, our server left me a little more to desire by valentina, ordered coke, she gave me diet coke, she said sorry, ordered white rice and was given brown rice, we ate it only for reason because she took ten minutes to check our table once it was served..again she apologized, when she finally checked pur table we advised her of the error and she actually went back to check her written ticket to verify we were telling the truth,  it would have been the perfect visit if she was able to handle the 4 tables she was sat. Not sure yet if i will return, again food is amazing!!"
Turina W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,1/30/2017,"Called in my order for curbside to go. I was told the order would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. I arrived 15 minutes later and parked in the appropriate place. I called several times to let them know that I had arrived. 45 minutes later I went in to get my order. So much for curbside service. The managers excuse was simply, "" lack of communication from the front desk"". And he also stated that this location don't get much business from curbside.  Unhappy customer."
Corabelle G.,"Las Vegas, NV",1125,467,832,3.0,10/24/2015,"I haven't ate at a cheesecake in a very long time.  It was a little confusing because the entrance that's located in the shopping area of the outlets mall is at the back of the restaurant so you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess stand. Honestly I never liked that because its weird. Anyways, just an opinion..so as we got to the hostess only for us to tell us its going to be 15-20 min. Odd to us because since we walked through the restaurant we saw it was completely empty so 15-20 min? Ok... We were sat after about 10 min and we were greeted by one server who said she would give us a few minutes after taking out drink order.  A couple minutes later another server comes up and greets us and asks if we would like some bread, we say sure. The first server comes back with our drinks and starts to take our order. The second server comes back with our bread, sees the server taking our order, says to her she can do it and then......they proceed to argue about who's table it is. Uhhhh??? So needless to say that was interesting.  So moving on we place our oder, get our food and the food was pretty good. I had the ahi tuna salad which was extremely tasty and very fresh. We also ordered a burger which was huge! The food saved this experience for us."
Tamara W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,4,4.0,11/3/2017,"When the Cheesecake Factory opened at the Premium Outlet mall downtown, I was super excited because it is close to both my job and my home.  My boyfriend and I have been  there for the grand opening, and we have been there many times since mostly for the convenience.   EVERY time we've been there it has been a disappointment!  The food was low quality and I especially remember how disgusting the restrooms were!  We were convinced it was a CF in name only, the employees didn't care  and the owners were not going to make ANY effort to provide the great food and customer service of others because it's in a 'tourist spot.' Tonight we were pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the Tuscany chicken, it was hot and flavorful.  My boyfriend's chicken Madero was just how he ordered and he ate all of it.  When I went to the restroom, there was someone cleaning it and filling the TP!  Our server had a large party in our section due to a bday, but she handled it like a pro and was super attentive.  FINALLY, we feel it's the REAL CF and will come back! The only complaint I have is we ordered a piece of the 6 layer chocolate cake to go, it was cut sloppily and not very big, other than that was good."
John O.,"Las Vegas, NV",278,335,613,4.0,11/25/2015,"This was the first time I have ever visited a Cheesecake Factory, and they set the bar for me and my future visits.  The Cheesecake Factory has a large selection of items on the menu, as well as a large selection of cheesecakes to choose from for dessert. Anything that you may feel to be in the mood for, they will have it from pastas, to burgers, to steaks. My personal favorite is the Hibachi Steak and I have many favorites for cheesecake, especially the Oreo cheesecake. You honestly can't go wrong eating at the Cheesecake Factory, and this location in the Premium Outlets North is generally pretty dead at night, especially after the mall closes, so it's the perfect place to eat at with a big group, or your date."
Marc M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,7,11,1.0,4/9/2017,"Outlet Mall. I have Celiac Disease and I ordered Gluten Free Four Cheese w/Chicken Pasta. It tasted great until I finished half of my meal.  See photos.  I specifically told the waiter I had Celiac Disease,  he indicated that he understood. My wife ordered spaghetti,  I would say the same strainer for her spaghetti was used for gluten free noodles.  Behind the scene, cross contamination inevitable.   The manager was apologetic and though I didn't pay monetarily for my meal,  I'll pay physically."
Erica D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,18,4,1.0,6/25/2017,Another wilted salad... Cobb salad with barley any avocado or bacon... and for this price it should be organic... but no! Oh and thanks for the mall employee discount (that doesn't exist)!
Renee Khazandra P.,"Sacramento, CA",6,1,,1.0,12/28/2016,"This might be the branch that has the RUDEST employees! So we just wanted to have a happy family dinner and when we entered there was a waiting list, so we checked in and the front desk said we have to wait for 40 minutes and we said ""Ok, thank you."" Then we sat down on a couch that is near to the front desk so we can hear them if they call us.            A while later, we asked how many more minutes do we have to wait and this guy told us that we're gonna be called next because we were in front of the line. A few minutes, we still weren't called. So we told another guy that 40 minutes passed already and we haven't been called, so he checked in the computer he said that we've been called 10 times! We were like ""We didn't get called at all!"" We were so near to the front desk and we know we didn't get called.       So we went to the manager and he got us a table and he said that it was no big deal. But it was a big deal, they were lying and unfair because we were a party of 5 and they called parties of 6 ,7, 4. They said that we weren't called just yet because our party was more than a party of 4! They were being unfair and dishonest. I hope my experience help you when you come to this branch."
Woody S.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,40,,3.0,1/18/2017,"Must-do update... After speaking with a representative of the Cheesecake Factory corporate office, I opted to give another location a shot. Checking out the franchise on Rampart in Summerlin, I was pleasantly surprised. We took my lovely mother in law, who is as notoriously hard to please as my beautiful wife and a really good time was had by all. Impeccable service and the entrees arrived as expected and quite good. Trust me when I say that the flavor profile the manager was going for at the Outlet Shops location was NOT what was served in Summerlin. Night and day, really.  I'm not saying to patronize one location over any other and I'm not saying I'll be rushing back to another Cheesecake Factory, but I'm glad corporate talked me into a return visit because if all I knew was the sloppy service and the slop on the plate at the Outlet Shops I'd do whatever I could to steer y'all clear.  That run on sentence notwithstanding, second chances can be a good thing."
Afsy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,26,37,1.0,10/20/2017,If I could give this cheesecake 0 stars I would. Our server seemed to have an attitude. We ordered a pasta with easy sauce but it was FULL of sauce. When we told the server she didn't seem to care nor did the manager. The least they could have done was say I'm so sorry the kitchen made a mistake. The manager didn't seem to care that I was disappointed in the service of his employees. We also got hot tea and the water was Pretty much cold. I won't be going back to this location and it makes me not want to go back to the other locations as well.
Cassandra B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",661,481,1336,3.0,7/30/2015,"I've never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory because I feel like their food is mediocre and overpriced. That being said, this newly opened restaurant at the Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is a welcome addition. Dining options at the outlets have always been severely limited and kind of atrocious. It's nice to have a sit-down option instead of eating at the food court.  PRO TIP: Make sure to enter through the front entrance near the street, otherwise you'll walk in on the side like we did and be confused as to where the hostess stand is located.  COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Served with softened butter that spread easily on the bread. Love when that happens. 4/5 FRIED ZUCCHINI ($4.95): Served with a side of ranch. Came with maybe 8 pieces of zucchini. Delicious. 4/5 LOUISIANA CHICKEN PASTA ($16.95): Our waiter said this dish was very popular. My husband and I split this dish and ordered the chicken on the side. More than enough food for two people! I don't understand how they serve this huge bowl of pasta to one individual. Unfortunately, the dish wasn't as spicy as I would have liked and could have used a bigger helping of veggies. 2/5  SERVICE: Waiter was great. He was super cool about accommodating a picky vegetarian eater (me). Hostess was super friendly and we were sat at a booth on a Monday night with no wait time. 4/5   VIBE: Modern cafe with a tan and brown color palette. Very family friendly. 3/5  GOOD TO KNOW: If you fill out the feedback survey on your receipt, you get a $10 e-gift card good on your next visit. :) Worth a Return Visit? Subtotal was about $27 for one entree and one small appetizer. Prices add up quickly here. We ate here because we were starving and didn't have a lot of dining options available to us. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, only as a last resort kind of thing. YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #227"
Nelson Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",2738,1403,29290,4.0,7/8/2015,"We've been to this CF twice already,  both times for Sunday Brunch. If you read the rest of the reviews here, lots of people have issues regarding service. I get that this is a new location and it takes time to work out the kinks, but people just gotta take a chill pill!!! Our first visit, we split the Chicken Chilaquiles and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, both were excellent,and the food came out in a timely matter. Our server couldn't answer a few questions about a few of the menu items we had, but no big deal..everything else was good. This recent visit over EDC weekend, once again, we went for the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and this time we ordered the Chorizo Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs. We noticed however that our waitress seemed preoccupied and didn't seem happy. We had a few questions about things and  got short answers. We knew something was up. Now at this point, people  would dock a star or two regarding service,  but upon returning, Wifey asked politely ""Having a rough day?"" Our waitress stepped back with a big sigh and apologized explaining the start of her day with a huge  power outage, EDC traffic, getting the kids ready, and getting ready for work all at the same time, so finding this out, we kinda sympathized with her and assured her that the worst part of her day was over, and whaddayouknow? Her demeanor did a 180...some people just need some positive reinforcement ya know?  Drinks were refilled, checked up on us periodically, and even the manager came by and was apologetic when she saw our food hadn't arrived yet!? We didn't feel  like it was a long wait, probably because I was engaged in conversation with my hot date across me...; ) When our food did arrive, the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were bomb as always, and The Chorizo Chicken Hash was perfection. From the perfectly oozing poached egg (lots of places have a hard time doing this) to the extra crispy hash I requested, no complaints here! Call me loco, but I prefer the  Cheesecake Factory over some of the other breakfast /brunch spots in town! ALOHA!!! Shaka Meter: \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"
Esme M.,"Las Vegas, NV",78,20,38,4.0,7/22/2017,"Came in around 7:30 on a Saturday thankfully it wasn't a long wait time, they greeted us our server Laurie was great, she didn't hover us which was nice because I wasn't in the mood to talk. I had the Chicken Madeira which is their most popular plate, ummm I wasn't a fan of it however my girlfriend had the Herb Parmesan chicken and it was sooooo good! Definitely recommend it! Lastly we had the Banana Cheesecake and that was even better, for us next time we order we might order ours with whip cream on the side, we thought it was a bit too much. At the end of the night we ended up crossing the street and realized we forgot our keys my girlfriend KINDLY asked the guy cleaning the table ""Sorry to bother you but have you seen some car keys?"" The waiter cleaning the table SIGHED and said NO I'm cleaning this table. Dude wtf! We realize this is not a fun job for you to have but it's your job to suck it up! No one decided this shitty job but yourself so don't be mad at the paying customer. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for having a lost and found policy well under control."
Jann V.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,12,1,1.0,5/13/2017,"Had a horrible service from this location. I work within the mall so Cheesecake is the only real food place to get food. We have their menu in our store and we order all the time. I called 30 mins before my lunch to make sure my order was good to go as always, I placed an order of Fried Calamari, good to go. I went over there on my lunch to pick it up and there was nothing. No sign of my order being there. I couldn't have called the wrong location because it's the only phone number we have of them and we call it all the time. The staff and managers seem to be clueless and not even the slightest apologetic of my inconvenience. So I still paid and tried to wait for my food but still took almost 20 minutes where the at the time did not seem to be busy at all. They said that it was coming right up and I waited it was almost time for me to clock back in when I got my food to go and it looked really half assed. The amount of food I got was about half of what I would usually get and they had a soggy piece of napkin underneath the food. It was not fresh, it was not even remotely warm. I was not happy with the experience and staff did not try to do much to help out the situation."
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,4.0,10/10/2016,"I think I found my new favorite happy hour spot! Wow! So let me start by saying that I honestly wasn't a huge Cheesecake Factory ""goer"" if you will but after today that may change and I wll tell you why! I was invited by an old co-worker to come out for some drinks and some snacks! My first thought was Cheesecake Factory? For Happy Hour? Huh!? Yes! No doubt I pulled up the menu online and say a few things that I'd be interested in. Now like any other happy hour menu the options to choose from are minimal however they do offer some great ones! I have to highlight that not only do they offer Long Island Ice Tea's but in TALL glasses! For only $5 I believe! What a steal! I was determined to try every drink but they would've had to wheel my out of there! I was able to also try the margarita and although it wasn't as strong as the Long Island it was still acceptable! Crab Spinach dip is a MUST! Even though the happy hour is only from 4-6PM I would still encourage everybody to check it out! This was my first time to this location and I was impressed! Not just by the food, but the customer service was excellent as well! I wish I could remember the waitress's name, she was a doll! I'll be back for SURE!"
Christian H.,"Hallands län, Sweden",0,2,,5.0,8/18/2017,"Best food in Las Vegas... booth food and desserts are awsome!!   we were a patry of seven and they served everyone at the same time, bellagio didn't...."
Melissa C.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",244,581,1664,3.0,7/29/2015,"This is about the closest restaurant to my workplace yet I was worried it would be too hectic for me to enjoy it!  I had to go for Half Price Cheesecake days, and I arrived shortly after opening. To my surprise, there was no one sitting at the bar. I had the new salted caramel cheesecake which is quite delightful! It has a blonde brownie bottom and I love cheesecake that is a combo even more!  They really should do the half price deal more often than once a year!  This place is sparkly new & clean and I hope to return to check out the happy hour!"
