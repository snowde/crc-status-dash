A M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,1,3.0,10/26/2017,The wait wasn't long to be seated. The wait to order and the wait for the food to be served was long. There was a fly on the table that took forever to leave. So while waiting for the food to arrive we try to get rid of the fly. The food was delicious. The cheesecake was good too.
Marie T.,"Las Vegas, NV",322,503,1944,4.0,7/28/2015,"I can't allow myself to give a billion dollar franchise a 5 star rating, so they'll get a 4 from me. It's not like they'll lose stocks or customers over it. Anyway, when this location opened up in the North Premium Outlets, I thought, ""this is going to be dangerous."" I literally work about 300 ft. away, so I knew that I was going to have to practice self-control. I've placed my lunch order for pick-up here a few times now and it's been nothing but awesome. Every time I call, the ladies on the other line are friendly. At the pick-up counter with all the chaos of other orders, the cashiers are fast and friendly. I haven't had any of my orders screwed up, so kudos to them, especially with my lunch being timed. As for the food, everyone knows their menu is vast. If you're eating healthy or don't give a crap about heart disease, they have something for everyone. They can even alter some items to be gluten free. Portions are huge, so you can always split your meal into 2 servings. And of course, who can forget their infamous delicious cheesecakes? Oreo, lemon merengue, vanilla bean, plain, etc. The list goes on for about a page and a half on the menu. Hence, where the self-control comes into play.   I'm a fan and I'll definitely be back when I ""forget"" to pack my lunch:)"
Leslie C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",12,33,12,5.0,7/2/2017,Theyre usually busy but really try to get everyone taken care of in a timely fashion. ordering over the phone can be a bit of a pain if theyre busy but its understandable. food is great i love the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer and a huge fan of their red velvet cheesecake
Hunter O.,"Las Vegas, NV",36,15,7,5.0,1/17/2017,"I ordered again same meal and it was done to perfection. I think its great that they acknowledged the mistake and fixed for the issue I wrote about, I was not and still am not after anything free, but was surprised they did not offer to correct the meal,  Oh well, i had a good meal tonight. Back on top guys!"
June S.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,5,,1.0,10/22/2017,Worst experience ever at your Las Vegas premium outlet location. They said they were all out of cheesecake after we sat there for over an hour eating our dinner and we had ordered our cheesecake at the beginning of our meal. The waitress kept coming back and saying they were out of all of the flavors we wanted and that was 5 different flavors that we attempted to order. No apologies and then the manager basically said oh well we don't have any thing for you. Very unhappy
Scott W.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,17,1,4.0,2/9/2017,"Cheesecake factory.. at the Premium Vegas outlets...mmmm..mmmm Cheese cake... Foods ok, but cheese cake yeah..."
Michael L.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,15,19,5.0,6/11/2017,"Great place for happy hour. The food is outstanding and the drinks are perfect every time. I was surprised with this place especially in a outdoor mall, but I am glad I went."
EMov I.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,8,1,1.0,4/12/2017,"Never ever go near this restaurant, rude service, rude waitress and food cold , with idiots for employees"
Kili O.,"Henderson, NV",0,1,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Overpriced crap.  Nothing comes with sides of any kind.  $40 bucks for 4 lousy sliders and some overdone shrimp, oh and 1 piece of cheesecake which was $10.  SMH Never again."
Jackie U.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,9,1,1.0,11/14/2017,"We had gone in to get their tiramisu CAKE. They don't sell a whole cake only by tray and it's too much for only two people so we went in and asked for two slices at the front bakery and a soda. Well we live in California and we were on our way home when we realized that they had given us cheesecake not cake. I called and asked for a manager and Andrew is a ""manager"" and told me he couldn't do anything about it because it had been over an hour? Uhm HELLO!!!! It's VEGAS! Whether I lived in California or not what does the time matter?! You're telling a customer they can't go back and return something they didn't ask for?! At least exchange it. The employees really do need to pay attention to what customers are asking for. This is a tourist city and your restaurant is in a tourist area!!!!!! Pay attention for what people ask for! Not everyone has the chance to eat here all the time or to be wasting money on something they don't want just because you can't pay attention and your lousy manager can't fix your mistakes! Will never come back here again. I have family in Vegas so I'm always coming down here and they said they've always had a problem with this specific facility whether it's service or food not being prepared right or cold. It's something wrong. Even though this is the closest one to their home they'd rather drive farther just to avoid this place."
Hayley W.,"Henderson, NV",1,10,3,3.0,5/31/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory everywhere so the issue wasn't with the food. Service was cool! Of course when the tip was received, the service got OFF THE CHARTS AMAZING while we were leaving. I usually go to the Summerlin location, but after a day at the outlet with friends,and not knowing there was a cheesecake there, we tried it out. I PERSONALLY won't be going back for the simple fact that there were flies above our table. When we expressed it to our server, he ""justified"" the flies as being ""bar flies""... Can you say, still grossed the f**% out?  Didn't offer to move us or anything.(there were 6 of us) I understand the fruits and sugars and such attract buggies  but I work in the industry as well and we do not have that issue...( btw there were no flies or gnats by the bar) Just saying."
Carl M.,"Henderson, NV",1,41,,4.0,5/31/2017,"I've always had a good experience at Cheesecake Factory. The service has been always on point. The food is always good and tasty, just a little pricey. I don't really understand all the bad reviews. This place is always busy and you definitely have to wait on the weekend. Don't believe all the other reviews."
Kk K.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",0,10,3,1.0,7/23/2017,Been to the Cheesecake Factory on the strip and on Rampart and the food was amazing and service was excellent. Paid $8 to valet just to eat at the Cheesecake Factory at the outlet mall sat at the bar top. I have been gone for a week traveling for work so it was the first time my husband and I got to sat down and catch up with each other and we decided to go here for lunch. Bartender was not friendly seemed to be inconvenienced that we sat down at the bar to eat. The lady who brought our bread was nice but the bread was burned. My husband enjoyed his turkey burger but my shrimp pasta was not good at all the shrimp was very rubbery and overcooked and the asparagus was not very good and limp. Bartender never came back to ask how our food was or I would have politely told him that I did not like my entree which he should have known as I did not finish it. He must have been in a rush to get us out of the bar as he already presented us our bill before we even got our entree in a glass cup in front of us!!! At the end of the meal my water glass was empty and did not even ask to refill it therefore we just paid the check and left. It is very unfortunate for the money I spent on our lunch to not only be satisfied with the food but also the service. Lastly we sat at the end of the bar by the well or the servers pick up the drinks and unfortunately it was surrounded by fruit flies as I kept swatting them away from our area of the bar. Wish I could have gotten our $40 back for this meal.
Madeleine R.,"Oslo, Norway",22,8,3,5.0,7/12/2016,"My friend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her belated birthday. I asked our server nicely if he could put a candle on her cake, and he did not only put a candle on her cake, but they also turned her plate into a birthday plate, and had 5 servers sing Happy Birthday to her, which was super sweet.  We had the salty caramel cheesecake and chocolate mousse cheesecake. They were delicious! (The only bad thing about them is that it's just too much cake, cause let's face it - nobody needs 900 calories worth of cheesecake.) ;) We ate about half of it, and our server put the rest in boxes for us so we could bring it home.  All in all we had a really good birthday celebration, and looooved those cheesecakes!"
Ron P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",17,81,16,5.0,4/27/2017,"Had a great time with family. There was no waiting, no cold food . We enjoyed the meal and Tameka took good care of us. We will be back."
Jennifer S.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,34,162,1.0,7/30/2016,"Probably should not have come on National Cheesecake Day. It was a zoo, and disorganized. Was escorted to a table that already had people at it, after we had waited for over 45 minutes after we were told 30 min wait. Husband ordered the jambalaya and it was dry, asked for more sauce. Ordered Swiss mushroom burger medium and it was not. Already had waited for my food didn't wait for them to redo it, and there is always the fear someone will do something to your food. Second bad experience at this location. Save your time and go to Caesars location for better service."
Christina F.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,7,,1.0,8/12/2016,"Terrible terrible service!  We were seated in the additional seating area which was almost empty and 3 other tables that arrived after us received drinks and bread before we did! We asked twice and they told us that everyone was waiting for bread to which I pointed out that 3 other tables right next to us , that arrived after us, had already gotten drinks and bread!  Our food arrived an hour later along with the first round of bread... Terrible service!!!!"
Marcia G.,"Las Vegas, NV",99,348,396,3.0,2/28/2016,"Friday night 9pm, just got in from Cali, the Bacon Bacon Burger is amazing! I had 2 slice of joy coupons and there was some flack from that, but there was no problem getting our free cheesecake. They ran out of Thousand Island dressing... I got the very last of it, just a smidgen. Service could have been better. When we asked to split the bill, it threw our server off. Ultimately everything worked in our favor. Beautiful decor. Bathroom is peraonal sized....only one stall, in which in a big restaurant like this, it should have a business sized bathroom."
Leo S.,"Henderson, NV",47,1,,1.0,7/17/2017,"I already warned by my coworker about the bad service of this location but I said to myself everybody deserve a second chance. Yesterday 07/16/17 I ordered factory burrito grande over the phone at 12:13pm and I was told that it would be 15 to 20mins so I went there 5mins early and payed for my order. For a sunday the place not crowded yet because theres no waiting time to be seated for a dining customer. 25mins had passed still my order not ready yet. So I asked the cashier politely ""can i follow up my order its been 25mins now?"". She said "" I will ask the other cashier what's the status""? and never return back to me . Now its more than 30 of waiting, I approached a manager whats going on? He said let me follow up with that , as I looked at him walking towards the kitchen a fellow employee talk to him and forgot bout my order. This location is very disorganize and lack of sense of urgency regarding customer waiting for a long time. i always order food from the ceasars palace brance but their service are always good!!!"
Lawren K.,"Honolulu, HI",25,20,1,2.0,1/29/2017,"Went here for my wife's birthday and our anniversary. Waiter wasn't friendly or very inviting. It felt as if we were bothersome for him. Walked past staff and said ""hi"" it's like they're not used to it. I come from Hawaii the staff there super awesome. I work in the service industry, guest needs to be treated with respect. We just ordered the drinks kept filled but being personable wasn't. Very disappointed I don't think I'd go back there again"
