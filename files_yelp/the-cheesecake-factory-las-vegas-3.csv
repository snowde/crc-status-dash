Julianne T.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",31,40,93,4.0,1/6/2018,My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 7pm and the wait was only 10 minutes for two. AVOCADO EGG-ROLLS are a must have! Our waitress was very nice and the service was fast. I believe her name was Heidi. My only complaint is that we were sitting right next to the hostess podium and when people came in to get their name on the list they would hover right above us.  Food was served correctly and hot. I love Cheesecake Factory!
Sushane P.,"Honolulu, HI",116,75,403,4.0,1/4/2018,"I am a huge Cheesecake Factory lover, I really wanted to eat here before we left Vegas. My husband and I along with our friends went for dinner.  It's super busy, so the wait was about an hour or more. But they have cool attractions and stores close by. The fish tanks out front is very appealing. My daughter enjoyed walking around looking at the fishes.Cheesecake Factory's location within Caesars Palace is a prime locations because there is just so much to see. Caesars Palace had a greek god show (not sure if they have it all the time) but the show was cool. We got to watch it as we ate.   The service wasn't that great because they were super busy. The food took awhile to come out. When it did come out, some of it was cold. I guess they wanted to wait for everything to be ready before they brought it out. But it was just too busy for us to ask them to heat up our food, considering we waited an hour to order and about 40 mins for our food to come out. Needless to say we still enjoyed our food. We are big Cheesecake Factory lovers. And the greek gods show definitely helped to keep us entertained.  I would recommend Cheesecake Factory. Just remember if you choose to eat here, be prepared to wait."
Sarah Princess E.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,3,7,5.0,1/2/2018,"Cheesecake Factory truly is one of my favourite restaurants -- Service is always tops and the portions are HUGE!  Dined in on the 21st of December for my baby sisters birthday outing and this location had the perfect vibe, music and staff. Our server Jeff was a delight so definitely ask for him when you're there! Their Avocado Egg Rolls served with a Tamarind-Cashew dipping sauce is to die for! If you haven't had it yet and want a savoury appetiser, it's the best choice. My Egg Rolls were fresh, crunchy and the sauce is delicious; If they bottled it and sell it, I'd definitely buy.  For my entrée, I had the yummy Evelyn's Favourite Pasta; rigatoni tossed with so many veggies and topped with a pesto.  I also got the Vegan Cobb Salad, which by the way is HUGE, so I definitely recommend sharing it!  Last but not least, my favourite part... the Cheesecake. You can't go to Cheesecake Factory and not get Cheesecake, that's just wrong. So I had a slice of the Celebration Cheesecake and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake to go."
Alan B.,"La Jolla Shores, San Diego, CA",259,813,3193,4.0,12/26/2017,I have been a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory since day one. This was my first visiting this location of The Cheesecake Factory.  I got lucky enough to get a table as The Cheesecake Factory does get busy real fast.  As I already knew what I wanted to order. For the appetizer I had the Chicken Quesadilla that was excellent. For the main dish I had the BBQ Chicken Salad that was also excellent.  What I like about The Cheesecake Factory over the larger restaurant chains the food is always solid. The food portions are always large to share with others. Leave room for desserts. As the cheesecakes are a must. No matter what you are craving when it comes to cheesecakes you will not go wrong. I recommend the mango or raspberry cheesecake.  The customer service was excellent from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. This Cheesecake Factory location in the back of the forum shops. You have private lot parking and valet.
Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",376,724,4176,4.0,11/24/2017,"SWEET! With all the calories that could be potentially consumed at any TCF location, dining at TCF is a bonafide treat (for me, personally).  My mom and I both love cheesecake, and therefore we couldn't pass up the chance of dining at this location. LOCATION / SETTING: The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace near the aquarium.  Restaurant is 2 floors, with some seating on the first floor having views of the aquarium and Atlantis Show.   side NOTE:   We actually visited this location twice during our vacation last month.  The first time for take out cheesecake from their counter, and the 2nd for lunch on our last day. FOOD: The menu is enormous!  So much choices/selections....and that's just the dessert section.  The menu has appetizers, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pastas, etc.  Even for the most finicky of eaters, I'm sure there must be something on this menu that is appealing. After some time, we decided on the egg roll sampler, while my mom chose the Shepard's Pie, my brother selected the super oxidant salad, and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad (lunch portion).  For drinks, my mom and I ordered coffee, and my brother was all smiles when the server confirmed they could make him a Bloody Mary. The egg rolls were ok.  They were a bit more oily than I expected, but I shouldn't have been surprised since we ordered fried food for an appetizer.  Not sure if I would order this again.  Thereafter, our entrees were delivered to the table, and I am so happy there were lunch sizes available because my salad seemed (to me) as if it were a FULL SIZE order.  It was massive!  It was just enough for myself, but unfortunately I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  If I were to order this again on a future visit, I would probably ask for no fried onions/onion rings (it just seemed a bit excessive to me).  My brother enjoyed his salad and finished the entire serving.  My mom, on the other hand, found her choice to just be mediocre.  In hindsight, she admitted she should have chosen something else such as a salad or sandwich.   Lastly, the cheesecake (like always) was very satisfying.  We ordered (at the take out counter) one slice each of the key lime and pumpkin seasonal cheesecake.  I felt we needed to order the pumpkin since its a seasonal flavor, and we both concurred that both slices weren't overly sweet. SERVICE: Very exceptional.  The hostess was friendly and seated us immediately (we arrived at around 1045 am on a Saturday; the restaurant opened at 10am that day).  Our server was a friendly and knowledgeable woman, who answered all our menu questions, and periodically checked on us throughout our meal.   One last thing to mention:  the staff at the take out counter were polite and very efficient.   BOTTOM LINE: Convenient (take a break while shopping!) and spacious location.  Great service.  Delicious desserts!  Yay Cheesecake!"
Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1000,3186,5.0,7/2/2017,"Hubby and I were enjoying a date night without the kiddo after a long crazy week and decided we needed to eat at the one and only chain restaurant we absolutely adore - The Cheesecake Factory. It was a Tuesday night around 9:30p and there was a 40 minute wait. Between exploring nearby shops and good conversation the time passed quickly. We were sat at a table near the back on the first floor and our waiter was with us right away. He took awesome care of us all evening - some of the best service I've had at a Cheesecake Factory.  We recently learned how much we love their loaded Nachos. So we ordered them with the ""spicy"" chicken to share. For dessert, we tried to new chocolate coffee cheesecake and also the Godiva brownie sundae (one of our go-tos). The new Cheesecake had great flavor, but not quite the same texture as other cheesecakes.....it felt like it stuck to my mouth in different way. Overall it was good, but next time I think we'll go back to one of our favorites (Oreo or Reese's).   There's so much good food here! I know the menu can be over-whelming. I'm not much for their pizzas and I feel their burgers are just fine. I usually prefer a crazy Appetizer (any of the awesome egg rolls or fried Mac & cheese balls) or a salad if I want something light (Cobb or Greek)."
Brandon O.,"Las Vegas, NV",349,73,102,4.0,8/8/2017,"I'm a fan! The lighting was a bit to dark for me, although the food was amazing and that's why we're all here now isn't it! The wait wasn't too long. Seating was intimate and I appreciate y server placing me at a table for two and not a table for four with two empty seats. That's a plus! Appetizers, entree, and desserts all came out with time to enjoy each course. The price isn't as expensive as my friends have been saying. It's decent and the refills keep coming for drinks. My server was really nice and speedy! I love the atmosphere in this restaurant!! Relaxing! Pros: Decent price, food chain, delicious food, great service, intimate setting, appealing decor Cons: A little crowded, dark lighting, no music, no wifi, no apple pay that I could see Overall: I'll be back very soon! Keep up the great work guys! I'm satisfied and happy!"
Chris C.,"Milford, OH",3,398,35,4.0,10/26/2017,"Next to free Atlantis show in Caesars Palace - we were told that we could see the show from our table ""outside"" the main Cheesecake factory, BUT it did NOT show on the video monitors as we were told - it was on the other side of the Atlantis ""aquarium"" so we could only hear the noise and see some flames coming out of the display - this would have been disappointing for children but it was no big deal to us 3 adult women. The food was delicious as usual for a Cheesecake factory.  Our server seemed to be having a bad day and she was tired, but I guess she did her best."
Allison R.,"San Francisco, CA",10,57,8,2.0,1/4/2018,"Had a horrible experience here. Told it would be a 30 min wait for a table, 50 min later checked in and still waited 10 more minutes to sit down. Waitstaff was good with checking in, but our meal took 1.5 hours to get a salad and a steak. It wasn't the steak that was the hold up.. but the salad. Specifically the onions on the salad. I never received the onions after I asked for them to bring it out without them. My poor fiancés steak was lightly warm from being under the heat lamps waiting on my onions. In the past I have LOVED The Cheesecake Factory but I won't be dining with them. From now on it's Cheesecake to go-if at all."
Sandy N.,"Las Vegas, NV",163,77,203,5.0,9/30/2017,This location is always great and has excellent customer service. One of my favorite restaurants because they have such a huge menu selection and yummy cheesecake!
Judy C.,"Honolulu, HI",497,481,7822,5.0,4/5/2017,"Happy 400th Review and I am dedicating #400 to The Cheesecake Factory.  Why The Cheesecake Factory?  The Reason: This Cheesecake Factory location holds special memories I will never ever forget, I celebrated most of my anniversaries here at this Cheesecake Factory location, the very first celebration was our 7th, which I remember like it was yesterday. We have been back every year,since our 7th. That's many anniversaries here!!  This recent anniversary was our 21st Anniversary and I wanted to keep the tradition going.  Although we do have a Cheesecake factory in Hawaii, which I need the energy, to get to Waikiki and with the very long wait, I don't really visit this location back home often.  This is why, I really look forward to February, our Anniversary.  I Really do enjoy all my visits to this Cheesecake Factory location, located in the Forum Shops at Caesars adjacent to Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip far north side of the mall. This Cheesecake Factory is HUGE with 2 levels. During my recent visit, we got our table right away after checking in with the hostess, we went after the dinner rush, which was close to 8 pm.  We always end up ordering our usual, but I still like to glance thru the famous 10 page storybook menu with 200 menu items. I like to see what new items are available. The loaded baked potato tots sounded tempting so I also got that along with our usual.  Here is what we always order, our anniversary tradition.  Fried Calamari, came with garlic dip and cocktail sauce, They make the best fried calamari, cooked just right, light and crisp.  Did you know that Cheesecake Factory has Miso Salmon?  Our entrée are the Miso Salmon X 2, fresh salmon marinated in miso, served with snow peas and white rice. I always request well done on my salmon. The miso sauce, rice, & snow peas just went so great together. We enjoyed this entrée.  Loaded baked potato tots, Crispy potato tots filled with cheese, bacon, & green onion, served with sour cream. I didn't care for this tots, I was expecting tots with the stuff separate, like nachos style. It was too rich, we didn't finish this tots.  We always get our alcoholic beverage and we need to make room for cheesecake. Never leave Cheesecake Factory with out eating a cheesecake, that's too crazy! The grand finale : cheesecake, deciding on what cheesecake to get is the hard part, with tons of flavors to choose from, My wonderful hubby always lets me choose, we are too stuffed to have our own cheesecake.  For our anniversary cake, I went with the salted caramel, enjoying every delicious bite.  Note: for any celebration, Cheesecake factory will decorate your cheesecake, free of charge. About Cheesecake Factory:  *Established in 1978 by Evelyn and Oscar Overton *The first Cheesecake Factory was founded in 1978, in Beverly Hills, California, by David Overton *There are over 150 Cheesecake Factory locations *The success of The Cheesecake Factory is a great American success story Overall, we always enjoy our visits here at this Cheesecake location and looking forward to many more! Thank you Cheesecake factory for a memorable celebration.  Happy 400th & Happy 21st!! #41/100 for 2017"
Dionne H.,"Chicago, IL",3,12,20,3.0,8/27/2017,"I spent Memorial weekend in Las Vegas. I had a great time people watching and outlet mall shopping. One evening before I noticed it was quite late and I needed to eat. I chose Cheesecake Factory because the food was familiar and reasonably priced. The service staff was friendly and attentive despite the late hour.  The most interesting part of the evening were the people around me like the loud, obnoxious men who kept shouting ""It's Trump's America"" or the girl who literally took a nap in the bread basket. Love Las Vegas!"
Darryl G.,"Henderson, NV",0,9,,5.0,1/5/2018,Never can go wrong with cheesecake factory. The service is always outstanding and the meals are always so big you can take half home and be full. Mac and cheese balls are a favorite along with the chicken Madera
Angelo R.,"Miami, FL",795,474,4003,4.0,3/29/2017,"I know this is chain restaurant and have eaten at Coral Gables & Aventura locations several times but this Cheesecake is located inside the Cesar's Forum shops where diners can watch the Fall of Atlantis show for free. We sat on the terrace and it was great for people watching. Ordered the Smoke House BBQ burger (Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, Onion Strings, Ranch BBQ). This burger was pretty enormous and mighty tasty. Bacon & onion rings were crispy. The patty was juicy medium. It came with fries so this was definitely a filling lunch for $12. My friend got the Factory Burger and said that it was also good. Service was swift and polite. Got seated in 5 minutes and food came in a timely manner. We were there on a Monday so weekends are probably a lot busier from reading other reviews."
Shirley S.,"San Diego, CA",57,27,21,3.0,1/3/2018,Normally the service is at least four stars but being the afternoon of New Years Eve maybe they were short of cooks. Our order was taken quickly. She asked if we wanted bread and we said no. She came back with bread and said they only had wheat. Good thing because it was almost an hour later before we got our food. I ordered a small Caesar salad with no croutons...but it came with croutons. She offered to take it back but I didn't want to wait any longer. Quicker to just pick them out. We ordered lettuce chicken tacos and edamame. We were wondering why these items took so long to be served. We ended up asking for our cheesecakes to go to save time. Nothing wrong with our food but was kind of full because of munching on bread while waiting a long time. Carrot and low carb Cheesecake were delicious as expected.
Helen A.,"Huntington Park, CA",2,52,34,5.0,11/17/2017,"THANK YOU SO MUCH ALICIA  First time at this Cheesecake Factory, amazing customer service. Food was hot when we got it. Kept us with  our cup full of water, she would come and check up on us often.  We are going home with our celebration cheese cake, thanks Alicia for the recommendation.  Will be coming back soon!"
Trick W.,"Bell, CA",10,60,37,5.0,1/1/2018,Had a great evening while shopping in the forum shops. Great service and like always great food.
Ben H.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,3,5.0,10/16/2017,"It took a long time to get seated, party of eitght. But once we were, Victoria really took care of us. Lots of questions, some not so reasonable, that she handled like a pro.  Dinner was excellent and staged perfectly (drinks, apps, main). And then we asked for... bacon cheesecake!  Not on menu.  Victoria made it for us and it was beautiful!  Straight cheesecake with bacon sprinkled over the top and whipped cream with bacon stuck in it!"
Gina U.,"Henderson, NV",45,5,3,5.0,11/4/2017,Today is my Birthday and I came with my boyfriend and my son. I just wanted to say how wonderful our waitress Julia was! She went above and beyond to make our experience great! Thank you!
James E.,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",0,39,42,5.0,12/10/2017,The name says it all! Cheesecake everywhere! The sizes of these portions are massive! Certainly a two sitting or two person take down! There's a lot of variations to choose from. Great location and great atmosphere all round. Takeaway service available too f you want to divulge elsewhere!
Javier M.,"La Joya, TX",0,33,12,4.0,12/8/2017,Excellent ambiance  Employees friendly Food is good Cheesecakes are wonderful  I would definitely come back here Hamburger was good The salad had too much vinegar  Another hamburger was good Sweet potato fries according to my mother in law were great I had the clam chowder and it was excellent  The artichoke dip was okay It had a little too many onions
Charlie B.,"El Paso, TX",17,77,156,1.0,7/19/2017,"We went last Friday the 14th of July,  another Cheesecake Factory,  another bad experience.  To start off with the Hostess was rude, and instead of waiting an hour,  we waited 1 hour 45 minutes to be seated. So we get upstairs, we have to wait another 5 min to be seated. We sit down and it takes the unhappy, uncaring, feminine waiter, about 10 minutes to acknowledge us, and another 10 minutes to bring our drinks, no alcohol, just water and soda. I was looking at the other waiter and he was fast with his customers.  We order our food... 45 minutes later they bring everyone their food,  15 minutes later they bring my chicken wings and cold fries.  During the long wait,  I filled up on delicious bread, that was the only good thing.   My aunt and uncle had cold, hard, white rice with their meal. The manager said he would give us all free cheesecake for our bad experience, wrong! Only 2 of us got it,  and my cheesecake tasted dry, and the whip cream on top was hard!  Never again, Austin and Las Vegas Cheesecake Factory just isn't good!"
Daniel P.,"Secaucus, NJ",58,71,129,4.0,2/2/2017,"First time ever dining at a Cheese Cake Factory! It's funny because there are two close to my residence but I go to Las Vegas to try it. It's in the the Cesar Forum shops right next to the Zeus Atlantis show. It's not a bad location and the surrounding is nice to look at! Okay the food...wow. Their huge menu was off putting but the food I ordered silenced my apprehension.  I ordered the portabella, avocado and zucchini appetizer. I never eat fried food but I'm happy I ordered it. Enjoy the finer, fattening things in life sometimes.  My main dish was the fish tacos! Hell yes! I loved it! Fish was cooked perfectly and it came with black beans and rice. I was full by the end of the meal. Please try this place out and enjoy your time in a great city."
Charlotte C.,"Burbank, CA",2,5,,1.0,11/4/2017,"My friends and I are locals and we came to celebrate a birthday, it was 10 of us and they told us that the wait will be for 30-45 minutes, we ended up waiting 1 hour and a half. Once we got seated we waited another hour to get the food. We weren't happy and called the manager and the manager clearly didn't give a s**t, didn't want to make a small gesture, or not even an apology! We all are very disappointed and on top of that he pretty much said that we were liars and that we only waited 5 minutes. Who waits 5 minutes at a restaurant on the strip? Haha.  We won't be coming back, neither should you!"
Vegas D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,5.0,11/4/2017,"First, the Service. Party of 11: Four adults and the rest under 21: Occasion:  B-day party. The wait time was to be an hour.  It was more like 35 minutes.  Polite front desk and friendly. Seating was prompt and without hassle.  Our server - Sheena.  The epitome of exceptional customer service.  Sheena is the kind of employee that employers try to keep guarded from other employers trying to poach such employees. The kind of employee every business owner desires.  An employee that instills such a great experience on patrons/customers - that it keeps them coming back.  Sheena greeted our party with professionalism, courtesy, all smiles, articulate, and just the right amount of chatter.  She came across as a seasoned server that knew the exact amount of exchange and pleasantries necessary to make everyone feel welcomed.  From taking our orders for drinks and appetizers on to the main entree and desert.  Our drinks were always topped off and our table cleared of used glasses, plates and empty bread baskets only to be replenished without delay. Not a single person had to request service.  Sheena was always one step ahead.  Thinking of pepper?  Too late, Sheena is already asking.  Shredded cheese?  Too late - Sheena is already behind you with cheese shredder just waiting for your affirmation.  Question about the food?  Yup, Sheena is there with an articulate explanation of options/make-up of the entree.  I remember trying to think of any additional request - but Sheena was there - one step ahead.  We were so lucky to have been served by this great person.  Such a delight to have as our server.   She worked our table like a ballerina - with the most exquisite detail to service. From the youngest patron, a 7 year old to my mother - everyone spoke highly of Sheena's performance.  The food, our drinks, deserts, everything was better due to Sheena's service.  The Food - Most started off with sot-drinks, while I enjoyed a Moscow Mule.  No copper mug but the Mule had a kick to it and not watered down.  For appetizers, we indulged in stuffed mushrooms, fried zucchini, calamari and artichoke?  The stuffed mushrooms were perfect and the fried zucchini was perfectly presented.  Just the right amount of crisp.  The Entrees included Chicken Madeira, Four Cheese Pasta (a favorite at the table), Steak Diane Scampi Combo, Fettucini Alfredo, Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips, Chicken Littles, and an assortment of other salads.  The Chicken Littles was quite the opposite of little.  My poor niece, who probably weighs less than 60lbs got full by just looking at the mountain of food on her plate.  It was an inordinate amount - much more than the typical Cheesecake Factory portion.  The food was very good.  Of course, we enjoyed our meal more due to the great service provided by Sheena.  For appetizers the selection was diverse - Snickers Cheesecake, Oreo Dream Cheesecake, 30th Anniversary Cheesecake (this is the one item I had second thoughts on - I should have ordered the Oreo Dream Cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary didn't have the sugar kick that accompanied the Oreo Cheesecake), Salted Caramel - probably one of the best choices for deserts, and the Birthday Sunday for the Birthday girl.  Served with black coffee to conclude this exceptional experience.  Thank you Cheesecake Factory and above it all - Sheena - just wow!  Thank you so much!  Entire family appreciate and thank you for the exceptional service.  Truly a unique experience.  That 30% tip should have been at least 50%.  Well deserved. Thank you again.  The Arroyo family."
Grace L.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,58,160,4.0,1/4/2017,"Being a chain restaurant I would say this place is definitely consistent with other locations I've been to.  Large menu with tons of variety you are sure to find something that will suit your fancy. Some would say a bit overpriced, but portions are sized to match in my opinion.  My family loves the ""brown bread"" and we have found that the servers will gladly bring you a basket with just the bread of your liking. What I liked about this location was the waiting process. When you approach the host stand if there is going to be a wait they hand you a card and tell you to come back after X minutes from the time written on the card (which is the time you first check in). This gives you time to wander and shop.  In my experience, upon your return they are able to seat you pretty much immediately. If a table comes up before the noted wait time then they will call out your name, but if you happen to not hear or you are in another shop no worry."
Doron M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,30,4.0,10/25/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory. Sure, the quality is not exactly sophisticated, each entree' is worth a daily calorie intake, and the drinks are way too sugary, but boy they taste so good. The place is famous for its never ending menu, and enormous portions. It's all true, choosing an entree is hard, but you can't really go wrong here. I got the Louisiana Pasta, and it was so good. I couldn't finish my plate and since then all I can think of going back to TCF to get it again."
Nick M.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",346,768,166,4.0,4/3/2017,"Located in the Caesar Forum, you have to walk through the whole thing to find this place -- tucked in on the side, and packed with people. The menu is HUGE. I had never been before at any other location, and i was mesmerized by the size of the menu and how many calories each dish contained. Eff it, I was on vacation. The lady and I started with toasted avocado bread, which is what it sounds like: toasted bread topped with avocada. It was actually pretty good, and is a good hangover cure if you're not feeling too hot. For our lunches we each ordered salads. It was called the chicken avocada salad or something similar, and it was a LARGE salad. One of the biggest i have eaten in my life, actually. It was covered in guac, chicken, black beans, tortilla strips, corn... just a lot of stuff packed in, and I could barely even finish it. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita. Recommended. Service was good, Our waiter enjoyed talking to us about where we were from and what we had planned while in Vegas. If you're in the area or walking around Caesar's and want some grub or booze, this is a solid option."
LaWanda H.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,33,332,4.0,9/4/2017,"My hubby, daughter and I came here for lunch August 16, 2017. We were at Queens Center Mall doing a little shopping and decided to stop at this newly opened location for lunch. Well I must say this place is very good. We enjoyed everything we ordered. We had the loaded bake potato tots which was sooo yummy and cheesy. We also ordered the chicken pot sticker dumplings. My goodness so delicious . For our entree's my hubby had the chicken Parmesan pizza style which he loved, loved, loved. My daughter had the 4 cheese pasta with chicken. She loved it! I had my Shrimp scampi over linguini which was so amazing. Our server was very professional and attentive to our needs. We will definitely return to this location."
Kathryn Y.,"San Bruno, CA",19,228,1179,4.0,9/10/2017,"Like Cheesecake Factory's we have here in CA, delicious! Oddly, we didn't have to wait to get seated (3 of us), we were prepared since it's in a mall and it was during the HOT summer we were here. Service was OK, food was good though and came out super quick."
Jojo C.,"Irvine, CA",100,26,10,1.0,9/3/2017,"This location in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace needs to get their act together. If you tell a party of 7 that it will take 1.5-1.75 hours you need to make sure to seat them at that time especially when you have sr. citizens in the party who need to eat.  It is understandable during a long holiday weekend that it will be long lines anywhere, but it shouldn't require manager intervention to make sure we get seated after waiting for 2 hours. I've been to Cheesecake Factory all over California as well as Summerlin ... I expected more from this location. Terribly disappointed."
Douglas S.,"Toronto, Canada",50,133,40,3.0,2/25/2017,"Ridiculously long wait for service when the restaurant was otherwise slow, and the food was barely passable. Our waitress appeared disheveled, and she certainly wasn't very efficient. We waited more than one hour for our food, and the food is quite simple. The restaurant was also not very busy. We had a burrito, a salad, lettuce wrap tacos, and a cheese only omelette. Normally this would be served up in 25 to 35 minutes. When the food get arrived, we pointed out to the waitress that one of the classes was horribly dirty, with a big brown ring around the inside of it. She wished it away, and laughed about it. Later, she returned again laughing, and said, don't worry about it, it was only a bad stain and not scum on the inside of the glass. Overall, a great disappointment and we will definitely not be returning to this particular location. It was not at all up to the standards of what I have come to expect from the Cheesecake Factory, which isn't all that exciting anyway."
Anthony H.,"Boca Raton, FL",107,5,4,5.0,9/23/2017,Very Good service and food !! The food was cooked to perfection! I felt good being here! Great ambiance!
Ken K.,"Mississauga, Canada",0,6,1,4.0,11/16/2017,"Always a good time here. Amazing cheesecake (salted caramel), prompt service and no complaints! The grilled steak medallions on the skinnylicious menu was a small serving but tasty. The cheesecake was so rich we split one slice 3 ways. Nice to be next to the Atlantis show outside."
Bianca M.,"Las Vegas, NV",341,130,82,5.0,12/3/2016,We had 35 guest it was for a friends birthday and they did their best to sit everyone next to each other and we were served in a timely manner and even with that many people the food came out fast and it was delicious.  I had their chicken Alfredo and it was very yummy the chicken was tender and the pasta was cooked perfectly not over cooked not under cooked but just perfect. We were too full to have dessert but their red velvet cheesecake is pretty awesome we took come to go and had it later :)
Gina C.,"Stockton, CA",2,4,2,1.0,11/13/2017,Terrible service. Asked for bread that was never brought until the food despite reminders. Dinner orders were incorrect for 3 orders. Food was cold and by the time it was brought others in the party were done. No apologies nor explanations. I'm usually pretty flexible but this was unacceptable.
Mayumi H.,"Salinas, CA",0,68,161,5.0,8/16/2017,"Las Vegas cheesecake factory was great! They sat us quickly, under ten mins.  It was the first time I tried the mushroom burger, I usually order the Cajun pasta and let me tell you I was not disappointed it was so good and full of flavor. To drink I had the pineapple Moscow mule and oh my goodness I loved it! Definite five stars."

Mary M.,"La Habra, CA",31,187,118,4.0,6/28/2017,"I suggest you request a table during the Greek god/fire show (whatever it is) they have right across from the restaurant. We put our name down towards the end of the show and as soon as the show ended the entire crowd headed to the Cheesecake Factory and the wait was over an hour. We waited 15 minutes. Also, request to sit inside and away from the show, the 2nd time around it started while we were dining and it was extremely loud and annoying! The food and service here was great. Had the salmon with lemon sauce, asparagus and mashed potatoes, so delicious and very filling. Didn't have room for cheesecake :("
Maja A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,11/4/2017,"Don't eat at this location!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What happend to us tonight was ridiculous! We were waiting one hour and half to be seated and after that we were one hour waiting to get a food. In the end we called manager to talk with him and it turns out that he told us we were waiting only 5 mins.So we  told him that we are unsatisfied and to help us at least with free drink on the house but he couldn't because in his system we were waiting only ""5 mins"", so basiclly he called us liars. Customer service poor. He didn't even say sorry for your waiting or anything.  Wooow unacceptable!!!"
