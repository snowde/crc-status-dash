Yvette C.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,13,4,4.0,4/27/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is located in the Forum Shops of Ceasar's palace, way in the back behind the Zeus moving statues (keep this in mind when sitting outside, the show is every hour on the hour and gets loud!). We went to the Cheesecake Factory, having never been to one before. As it was in Caesars Palace, I was expecting inflated prices, however I was pleasantly surprised with the menu pricing. The spinach, artichoke and cheese dip was great and the pizza and jerk chicken for main were both fresh and tasty. We took a slice of cheesecake to go (too full to eat after the starter and main) and it was lovely. The price level was decent, especially considering the quality of food you get. A good experience! Our waiter was fast and friendly and offered advice on the huge menu (I mean it when I say there is something for everyone!!).  My husband had the Meatballs, my sister had a pizza and I had a steak. All the meals were well prepared and very well presented. My steak was cooked as I like it, medium rare. Following the meal we chose deserts and again they were really nice, and surprising value. The low light was the Fettucine Alfredo. Very little sauce, very little flavour. Very disappointing. Both the meal and desert portions were large, perhaps a little too large for me and I have a great apatite. The portion and value are great here and the food is very decent, though not so much on the healthy side (they do have a 'skinny menu' meant for those who are calorie conscious). The service was excellent and our server was very conscientious, always making sure we had rinks topped up etc. All in all, the title says it all. 'Good Food, Good Value - Great Evening' We will definitely return to here."
Lim K.,"San Diego, CA",0,374,177,5.0,11/6/2015,"We have brunch at Cheesecake Factory every Sunday after Church unless we are out of town.   So while staying at Caesars Palace for a few days we tried not to eat at Cheesecake Factory but ended up going there twice.   Unlike Starbucks their menu prices were the same as home and the food was great, especially after  spending lots of money elsewhere and you were not too satisfied. We love their warm wheat bread.  Service is always great.   Some of our favorite food here are Asian lettuce taco, fish and chips, grilled steak medallions, lemon ricotta pancakes, and fried zucchini sticks."
Asif H.,"Calgary, Canada",111,114,1275,5.0,8/29/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is a mandatory stop when in the USA, every place I travel and they have a CF I am there, the menu is huge, consistent, and satisfying. A Family pleaser! I always try new things but some favs include Steak Diane, Tuna Tartare, Chicken Madeira,.I try to save room for desert but never works, I have to get a slice of cheesecake to go,.cheesecake factory always hits the right spot, the portions are big, the prices are great, a must if you haven't tried before."
Erik D.,"Knoxville, TN",13,23,13,5.0,8/4/2016,Love this place Julian F was an amazing server!  Had a hiccup with the food but she busted balls and made it a great experience.  Thanks Jullian F.!
Melissa W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,57,20,1.0,8/3/2015,"We went to the new Cheesecake Factory across from the world Market Center. We sat in the bar so we could get in and out fast. We were there over 2 hours... We saw everyone around us being served and finish and we were not served.  When we asked the manager... Why it was taking so long, she said she would check!  She came back without our food. She said the time is only 30 min. Old. This was NOT cool.  We will never go back!!! If you want good service Do Not Go Here! The food was cold and not what we have received at The Cheesecake Factory in California!"
Dennis G.,"Kyle, TX",101,64,69,5.0,7/25/2015,"Excellent service, even for it being at the Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress was very attentive, personable and knowledgable about their menu.  This location is clean, very nice lighting that sets the mood for all types of dining occasions.  The menu is stellar as always with generous portions(even on the lunch menu). They are always adequately staffed and the wait times, even in the peak of summer was less than 20 minutes.  Wonderful representation of the Cheesecake Factory name."
Todd A.,"San Diego, CA",163,75,159,5.0,5/27/2016,Cheesecake factory always comes to the rescue. The Las Vegas location held to a higher standard when it comes to service and beautiful scenery.  The food is always Louis is in a wide variety of items to choose from. I had  the dynamite shrimp and tater tot's. Yummy. Wifey had the clam chowder and salmon salad with shrimp. Apparently this is the best salad she has ever had. Great customer service and never let down.
Jay M.,"Washington, DC",118,120,18,4.0,5/31/2015,Great service as usual. TCF is one of the only restaurant chains that has good service no matter the location. They make dining options easy for me when I'm somewhere unfamiliar.  Caribbean Cooler 10.95 Strawberry Lemonade 4.95 Tomato Basil Pasta 14.50 Fish Tacos 13.95 Caramel Macadamia cheesecake 7.50 51.85 pls tax
Randy S.,"Bakersfield, CA",9,118,17,5.0,3/9/2016,"Although not my first pick, my wife loves it. Food is always good....just not my fancy.  Service always spot on!! Extremely weird but for whatever reason, I've only had cheesecake here a couple times. It's good for sure...but I wouldn't come here just for it. A good value and definitely a recommendation!!"
Josh S.,"Las Vegas, NV",276,172,155,4.0,8/11/2016,"This was the first time at the cheesecake factory. The food was really good they give you bread to start. Portions were pretty big as well my wife and I shared the macaroni and cheese bites which were amazing, we shared the shepherds pie as well plenty of food for us both. Of course we has a piece of cheesecake we had the tieramesu it was fantastic... the restaurant was clean and staff was great. Definitely check it out prices were not bad at all either!!"
Valeria E.,"Ithaca, NY",13,30,57,4.0,7/7/2016,"Like every other Cheesecake Factory they were organized and friendly. What I liked the most about the place was I that it had a lot of natural light, large windows and tall ceilings. It was a perfect place for a weekend breakfast. They strawberry milkshake is the best!"
Nuttawan W.,"Petaluma, CA",59,3,61,1.0,10/24/2015,Today is my mom's birthday so I bought the cake 59 dollar. They said cake ll b ready in 5 mins after that I don't know what's going on I have to wait forever they said they don't have a box for cake. I can't imagine what I got from them...I called manager and he treat me really bad. Cuz I look like kid...but doesn't matter ok!!!! I don't need free stuff just learn how to treat nice to customer!!!!
Emily M.,"Las Vegas, NV",87,3,,5.0,7/19/2016,The service was fast. Wonderful servers were constantly making sure we had enough to drink and that our dining experience at par.  I would highly suggest the key lime mango cheesecake.
Joey M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,4,20,3.0,12/7/2015,"Ok now they start me with bread, which the crust was very hard to the bite on the other hand I ordered the chicken gumbo, which is my personal favorite and it was always to my liking."
Christy W.,"Las Vegas, NV",161,162,320,4.0,1/24/2016,"I dine here periodically after shopping at Caesars. Checked in with the receptionist, waited about 5 minutes before she took us back to a booth. The bred was freshly baked, straight out of the oven.. Still warm. The atmosphere is dimly lit and welcoming. The server was friendly and quick to fill up water. Our order came or fast and tasted fresh. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad and it was soooo good!"
Huiling Z.,"Toronto, Canada",0,6,2,4.0,5/26/2016,"Best cheesecake I ever had! The waiter is very kind and we took his recommendation of banana cream cheesecake.  Also really like the pre-dinner bread. It's black bread coated with oat and honey, warm, and served with butter. Sooooo good! Shrimp pasta is good. But not as impressive as the above two. Otherwise I would give five stars. Shrimps are big and fresh, properly cooked, but besides shrimp, there's only tomato and red pepper in the pasta. It'll taste better if more veggies like onion, broccoli, mushroom etc could be added."
Brennen L.,"Anchorage, AK",9,38,7,4.0,3/19/2015,"I had very high expectations. People are always bragging online about how they ate at the Cheesecake Factory and they take pictures of their food with Instagram filters. I thought it'd be overrated and regular but I actually enjoyed myself. There isn't a Cheesecake Factory here in AK so I had to give it a try while I was in Vegas. Ordered their Ribeye Steak medium rare with Mac & cheese and Mash potatoes. I judge a lot of restaurants based off of their ability to cook steak correctly. I'm no snob or highly experienced chef but cooking steak isn't exactly easy so if a restaurant can cook a steak properly, it gets major kudos from me. They not only cooked my steak perfectly but even the cut itself was of high quality. Maybe I'm exaggerating but it tasted and looked perfect. The mac & cheese was gooey goodness and the potatoes was good also. I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake to go which was fancy smancy yumminess but I expected that considering the name of the place. I wish we had one up here and I can't wait for my next visit."
Michealangelo T.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",3,32,22,1.0,8/3/2015,"Cheese cake factory...The food portion here in Vegas is great. Hostess, waiter and waitress are friendly. I over heard my waitress... We have bigger portion for the tourist. Good job. :(  my little brother took care of the bill ahead of time...  This is a Chinese thing... We pay ahead of our relatives or leave our card with our host to avoid the battle who will pay the bill. We spent $125 and little did we know that during the course of the dinner we were served a dish with curly hair... CURLY ones... As soon as we saw the curly hair, we brought it to our host... The manager came and to make it right he gave us a free slice of cake.  This is VEGAS!"
Kimberly H.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,55,152,5.0,6/8/2014,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants for many reasons but I'll give an exception this time. For an appetizer I ordered the Portabella Mushroom Avocado and Zucchini Fries oh sooo good! Seriously you have to try it! For my main course meal I choose Evelyn's favorite pasta! Now I can say why it was her favorite! It's now mines too! Lol pasta was more of a vegan dish since it had  Penne Tossed with Broccoli, Oven-Dried Tomato, Roasted Eggplant, Peppers, Artichoke, Kalamata Olives, Garlic and Pine Nuts. Ahh sooo good! And lastly for dessert my server suggested to try out their tiramisu cake, I enjoyed it it was full of flavor very moist and could definitely taste the coffee the only bad thing I'd say was the waiting time it took about 50 mins to be seated we were given a receipt with a check back in time. We however used that time to walk and browse around the forum shops :)"
Rebecca B.,"Las Vegas, NV",34,15,2,4.0,8/24/2015,"Great as always. I'm forever recommending their Ceasar Salad, fried mac and cheese balls, and Red Velvet Cheesecake. The only flaw is their seating. If you're upstairs near the railing, be careful. There's nothing covering the fence part, so if you drop a knife (as I did) you /will/ hit someone. Luckily, it landed between her back and the booth but still. They need to fix that. After the incident, the manager just told me to keep my silverware away from that side to avoid another mishap.  That mishap would never happen again if they fixed that, but still. Always A+ food no matter the location. The staff is super friendly. :)"
