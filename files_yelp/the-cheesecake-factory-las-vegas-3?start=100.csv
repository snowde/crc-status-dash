Naz E.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,37,72,4.0,2/13/2017,"Stopped by for lunch here after an afternoon of shopping around the Forum Shops. Though it was a Sunday afternoon they weren't ridiculously packed. We were seated quickly and were greeted by a very friendly wait staff. Our waitress was super nice and attentive. She was quick to bring by anything we asked for and was very helpful with helping us decide what we wanted to order. I wish they had a restroom on the first floor, but unfortunately you have to take the elevator all the way up to the second floor if you happen to be seated on the first and need to go. Other than that, the food and service is fantastic!"
Jocelyn A.,"Chula Vista, CA",19,85,10,4.0,3/23/2017,"Expected long lines but we were surprisingly seated within 15 minutes.  Instead of pagers, they just tell you to wait near the bakery behind the hostess.  Our server was attentive and the food was great.  I love Cheesecake Factory but I typically never go to this location because there are so many other places to try out in Vegas.  Since I had 2 picky teens with me, I figured we could please all palates here and have something to do afterwards in the Forum Shoppes."
Rita G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,4.0,11/15/2016,"Amazing food, always busy which might be a downfall because it translates to long waiting sometimes. Yet I will always keep going there."
Ry T.,"San Francisco, CA",582,1509,1898,2.0,11/2/2015,"Hubby had a gift card for this place, so we came back here to eat during our visit to Vegas. Our server, David F was very nice. I've seen him before from our visits to this restaurant and he told us he's worked there about 12 yrs.   We had: 1. fried calamari, $11.95. Not as good as I remembered. Wouldn't order again 2. Orange chicken, $16.95. Didn't taste that good. Hubby ordered it and said the orange chicken was better at Panda Express. 3. Skinny Caesar Salad, $9.95. I seemed to remember it was better before. No anchovies. 4. Coffee $3 5. Fresh Strawberry cheesecake, $7.95.  It was Ok.  I hope we don't get anymore gift cards for this place. I think the food has gone downhill."
Rl R.,"Lakewood, CA",1,30,2,4.0,4/22/2017,"Although the wait was pretty long, (hour and a half for 6) my family enjoys dining here whenever we're in Vegas. Food seems to taste better here than the one in California. Service was good and my medallions were a perfect medium rare :)"
Edna G.,"East Bay, CA",574,749,8705,3.0,12/9/2014,"Only came here for appetizer for snacking but it became a full late lunch! Ah I was full. The service is great and not really busy here during the time we came. We ordered: 1) Calamari was well deep fried and cooked but no real flavor by itself or with sauce. 2) Ahi tartare was very small and only for one person. Had a lot of avocado, more then ahi tuna and the sauce was just right with the wonton chips. 3) Buffalo wings were good and well deep fried with ranch. 4) Fried Zucchini was good and well cooked. Love their ranch as it seemed homemade. 5) Loaded potato tots were good and filled with bacon,cheese,potatoes,etc but you can only have so much. I could not eat too much of this as it almost made me sick. 6) Plain cheese cake with warm chocolate sauce is always my fave! My rating is more a 3.5 stars but had to round up. I would come back but we need to watch what we order! ;-)"
Triston D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,48,9,5.0,3/29/2017,"I love this restaurant! First it's mostly only a 5 minute wait because the restaurant is huge Second service is great. Also, the restraint is clean and the food is great. Plus if you get a view outside you'll get a view of the show or the huge aquarium."
Glenda T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,1,5.0,7/22/2016,I like the restaurant and service at the Boca Park in Summerlin. Servers are professional and friendly. Food is excellent and you get top notch service.
Paul M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,,4.0,4/6/2017,"Who does not like this place? Cheese Cake Factory is always the place to go for good food. I love this location, the only complaint I have is the noise from the shops can be loud, but it is still a wonderful experience."
Jeff H.,"Las Vegas, NV",94,11,11,4.0,1/12/2016,"Being located inside the Caesar palace expect to have a wait when you come to this location. Today around lunch time though we got seated quickly. The food here is okay. They have a large selection of food, too much to choose from. Having so many options can get dangerous haha. I ordered the miso salmon from the lunch menu. It was a good portion, just enough to get me full and leave room for dessert. Just like the food menu there is a large selection of cheesecake and other desserts here. Today we ordered the strawberry shortcake and the new salted caramel cheesecake. Strawberry shortcake was really good but the cheesecake was a little too sweet for my tasting. I would come back here."
Nadav B.,"Chamblee, GA",0,4,2,1.0,7/2/2016,If I could give 0 stars I would have give it .  Disgusting food disgusting service . Don't go in to this place .
Yousef Y.,"Elizabeth, NJ",13,17,2,5.0,9/1/2016,Gotta say the food and service were excellent here. While yes this is a chain restaurant I do believe Cheesecake Factory in Las Vegas is one of the best places you can get a bite. My server Katherine was very friendly and attentive.  Trust me if you walk in from the strip entrance you will take a nice walk through the Palace Shops and earn that bite to eat for sure.
Janae B.,"Long Beach, CA",2,4,,1.0,8/13/2017,"I've gone to Cheesecake Factory plenty of times in the past, but I've never experienced what I experienced yesterday. After being in the nearby Apple Store for about 3 hours, my friend and I decided to grab dinner at Cheesecake Factory. We were seated fairly quickly, which was great, but our seat was in a super small corner and very close to the the table next to us, so we opted to sit at the bar. This is where the trouble came in.  The bartender first poured us water and took our drink order. When he placed the water down, he slammed the cups in front of us. We thought very little of it initially. Next, he delivered the drinks and walked away without saying anything about food, which we had previously told him we would be ordering. We called him back to order. My friend ordered a pasta dish and asked for extra sauce to be poured in. He replied, ""No."" We were confused and actually thought he was joking, but he said ""no you can not"" again. She asked why and he explained that many people ask for it and it comes out too soupy and he ""wasn't about to send any food back because it was too soupy."" Then he called out to someone else (another employee) and walked away. He poured a glass of red wine for another customer then He came back and pointed to me and asked what I wanted to eat, but he hadn't resolved the soupy pasta issue with my friend. We had decided that we didn't like his attitude or the way he yelled out to someone and walked away in the middle of taking our order so we decided that we would enjoy the meal at a different Cheesecake Factory. I told him that we wouldn't be eating here and that we were leaving. He took the receipt for the drinks slid it in front of us and said ""don't forget to pay for these."" We hadn't had one sip of our drinks. We asked to speak to the manager because we didn't want to walk out and have it look like we skipped out on a bill. The manager was understanding, but not apologetic, and told us that we wouldn't have pay for the drinks that we never touched.  We left, went to the Cheesecake Factory in the district at Green Valley, had a fantastic meal and even greater service."
Candy I.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,2,4.0,4/18/2017,Had lunch and had the philly cheese steak. The menu is huge and you will have plenty of good food to choose from.
Taheera C.,"San Diego, CA",10,108,19,3.0,1/29/2017,Went on a late datenight and waitress gave me ore attitude than a hungry 5 year old. I understand that she might have had a long day but honey you are in customer service if you are not up for it take time off not give attitude to people who pay for your paycheck. Food was amazing as always
Benjamin K.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,2,,1.0,5/12/2016,"Absolutely the worst service we have ever had. We always used to look forward to going here while in Vegas but will never go again.  When we went we were seated straight away even though the entire top section of the restaurant was closed which was unusual for this location.  After asking for the enchiladas with ""no sliced up peppers or onions on top but sauces would be totally fine"" we received a plate with plain white rice, 3 flour tortillas and some plain unseasoned chicken breast. No tomatillo sauce or salsa at all. When we sent it back the restaurant manager came back 20 min later, mumbled something under his breath and slammed down the same meal, cold with some tomatillo sauce thrown on top.  Probably the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Disgraceful."
Stephanie L.,"Henderson, NV",219,85,165,5.0,8/9/2015,"I have been to this location a number of times, and have left satisfied every time. They have two floors and a seating area out in the front to enjoy the hourly show and huge fish tank (and people watching... who am I kidding). All of my waiters & waitresses have done a great job and making sure my needs were met :) The ambiance is like every other Cheesecake Factory; dim and romantic. My most recent time here I ordered the Renee Special. It is half of a sandwich, a bowl of soup, and a small side salad. All of it was great! The only thing is the salad was a little bland and only had leaves and balsamic vinaigrette. The soup was incredible! Cream of chicken with bacon bits on top. The half of sandwich was really good as well. I would recommend Cheesecake Factory for anyone, the menu is extensive enough to meet anyone's craving needs!"
Daniel M.,"Las Vegas, NV",60,58,22,5.0,3/15/2017,"There's a Cheesecake factory closer to me, but I like the one on the Strip. It's more fun, more easy-going. Absolutely perfect for a get-together with a few friends. The menu is a phone book. I like that. This is one of the few restaurants that I've tried different things. Also terrific for the kids. They are in heaven when we go. Good family restaurant. Window shop at the forum and then eat at the Cheesecake Factory."
Haleigh M.,"Las Vegas, NV",73,31,46,5.0,10/11/2016,"We live here in Vegas and there's a Cheesecake Factory maybe 10 mins away from my house but we drive all the way to the strip to come to this location! And especially for our waitress, Daisy. I always ask for her, she's amazing! Very nice staff! I've only had one so-so experience there after being there a lot! Food is always fresh and tastes good! Pretty good on refilling the drinks quickly! Love this location keep up the good work!"
Diana J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,2.0,6/19/2017,Food not as good after the recession. Baja tacos are much smaller. Just not the same. It seemed like the food tasted way better before. Recession is way over. Charging more for less!
