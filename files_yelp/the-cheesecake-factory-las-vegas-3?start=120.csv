Duchesz L.,"Las Vegas, NV",34,23,10,5.0,11/13/2016,"My husband &&I eat here at least 3 times a month. Often catch Floyd Mayweather &&his ""money team"". The service is exceptional. One night I guess a server dropped my husbands filet mignon &&the manager came to apologize comped his plate &&offered us a free slice of cheesecake. We're not dessert eaters so we took the comp gladly. If you go later in the night, like two hours before closing, there's usually no wait."
Madyson C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,8,3.0,3/18/2017,We came to the restaurant around 7 and were given a 40 minutes wait time. We came back and were given more time to wait. We got our table and the food was average. Beware of the crowds.
Pamela D.,"Northeast, Denver, CO",0,13,5,4.0,8/22/2016,"Food and service very good! I ordered breakfast and don't care for strawberries. Well, they only have strawberry jelly for my toast that I won't enjoy now. They don't ever have any other flavors of jelly."
Wendy M.,"Anaheim, CA",1,19,11,3.0,2/18/2017,"The 3 different appetizers we got were VERY good. Tater Tots Fried Mac & Cheese Avocado Egg-rolls, the sauce for the egg rolls was  delicious. Of course the bread  was good, my favorite was the honey wheat. The hostess were very nice and friendly. Our waiter was ok. However both dinner plates we got were  Eggplant Parmigiana with Pesto pasta & the Shrimp /Sausage rigatoni pasta. We didn't have any dessert. If I would have liked either one of our dinner plates I'd give it better star rating. Oh we sat outside and enjoyed the view of the large fish tank. Best seat in the house"
Ajay C.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,54,65,5.0,8/12/2015,"I went here last week for dinner. There were a lot of people ahead of us but we were seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant is very clean and spacious. It has 2 dining floors and an outside portion where you can watch the animatronix  show,  the show is very loud so if you prefer quietness, stay inside. It also g wet s very dark outside, as they turn off the lights for the show. The decor of the place is very classy. High ceilings with hanging fixtures. The place is very dim inside so it does have a classy - romantic feel to it.  The menu features a full course dining option from appetizers  to desserts.  They serve a complimentary french and honey oat bread with butter. It's very delicious and filling so thread carefully! I got the avocado chicken club and it was delicious. It was served with fries that was also good as well. The club could use less tomatoes but that's juston preference! I will definitely come back here again!"
Beom Joon K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,1,1.0,11/29/2016,The food tastes so bad and hygiene was so bad either there is no next time. The server was not too bad
Hani G.,"Bakersfield, CA",3,122,8,3.0,10/31/2015,"We went there on our last day in Vegas, it is located inside Cesar palace, we sat outside, the atmosphere was loud but it was ok, I ordered the chicken Madeira, it was ok nothing special, my wife ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp, the rice was so sticky, we didn't like it. Overall, I would go again but I might sit inside this time, it is kind of romantic atmosphere not like outside."
Raychel V.,"Las Vegas, NV",110,8,,1.0,11/28/2016,"So disappointed! As regular customers to this location, we spent Thanksgiving there.. food was great but our server was horrible. Said strange things. Talked us out of certain food and then when I wanted to order 3 kids meals so I could share 2 with my 1 year old and my 8 year old would have his own he looked at me and said NO! I said I can't?? And said NO!  With that he said he would come back! So rude. I work in customer service myself and I can't imagine treating a customer like that. I order the same thing every time and never have a problem. My 1 year old doesn't eat much so really it's not like I'm being cheap. I just hate to waste food. No other server ever gives me a hard time. He could have said I'm sorry I'll have to ask a manager or something a little nicer but he treated me like a criminal. It's really not that big of a deal. He needs to find a different line of work!"
Theodore S.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,58,69,5.0,9/3/2016,Food was amazing other than the customer service not being so good @ first......... The cheese cake is 8.95 per slice I think that's kind of high. But it is what it is
Kelly K.,"Layton, UT",57,3,,5.0,3/2/2017,"I had the Renee's special and the chicken salad was absolutely amazing. Our waitress was on the ball, she kept our beverages full and made sure everything was good. Great French onion soup and the price was very reasonable. Left there with a full stomach!"
Jeremy Y.,"San Leandro, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/13/2017,"This is by far one of the worst cheesecake experiences I've ever had. We went out to celebrate an early Mother's Day dinner and ended up being a total waste of time. Horrible customer service for one! The host was rude and had this angry look on her face, expressing how much she hates the world and the people in front of her. We were seated quickly. Guess that was the highlight of the night. The server comes up and greeted us, ask if we would like some starters or a beverage. Took the order and came back 15 mins later, placed 2 of the 4 drinks on the table. Never gave us any straws... another strike in the books... came back 5 minutes after that to give us the other two drinks. We ordered food, ended up waiting 45+ mins for a fettuccine alfredo, 4 cheese pasta, a chicken quesadilla and a cheese burger. Keeping in mind that the restaurant wasn't even really that busy.. (Lame...) my mother in law then noticed a piece of stretch wrap melted in her pasta!!!!! The chicken in the pasta had no seasoning on it at all. My 4 cheese pasta looked as if it was sitting on the hot table baking for hours. We then called our server and brought it to her attention. She said sorry and sent the manager to our table. The manager apologized and said sorry, we wrap our chicken in plastic when breading the chicken to freeze it and that sometimes this issue happens. (Who says that?!!!) what kind of manager would explain to you that it just happens and sorry. He then asked if we wanna try anything else on the menu. We said no thank you and may we have the check please?. The server came back and said, I have something that will make you guys happy again!!! She then said I have dessert menus!!!! We said no thank you check please. She came back and said my manager took that one plate off your bill. The bill should have been discounted in total!!! None of us even finished our food after mom found that plastic!!! This location is really slackin.. I'm still replaying what the manager said to us in my head. (Yeah, sometimes it happens.) I work in the food industry and tonight was unacceptable!!!!! The GM needs to step it up. I used to LOVE Cheesecake Factory!! Now I feel that this night ruined it for me. The other location at the outlet mall was a bust as well. I will not be returning, nor will I be recommending anyone to go here!!!"
Princess M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,26,41,5.0,5/16/2016,I came here with my family!!! Met the waitress she is the best !!!! It's busy but she did a very good service !!! Thank you so much Brianna the name of waitress she is the best lol thank you so much
Azusa S.,"Oxnard, CA",2336,472,3987,3.0,7/11/2015,This Cheesecake Factory is always crazy busy and the noise level is over the top. I had the salmon which was excellent and my girlfriend had the chicken taco wraps which she loved and her hubby had the pulled pork sandwich which he said was good but my poor hubby had the macaroni and cheese hamburger which was not very good. The burger was so dry and the macaroni was not even edible! So disappointed!! We shared two pieces of cheesecake to go and the tab was like $100. Yikes!! Not worth it for not edible hamburger.
Mko D.,"Crandon, WI",2,4,1,5.0,8/4/2016,"Second time eating here, figured I'd give it two tries before I wrote a review. I have heard about the restaurant very in depth through a class I am taking at UNLV and had to experience it first hand. For starters the atmosphere of this restaurant is very appealing! A nice calm lighting with a warm and welcoming feeling. If this is your first time, I recommend ordering an appetizer right away as it will take a good minute to look through the menu. This place has everything you can imagine and it all tastes amazing!  The food is mouth watering to say the least. The chefs in the back truly know what they are doing and really put their love and passion for cooking into the food. The waiters are also very pleasant and helpful. The prices for this location are very reasonable, especially considering its location along with the quality of the food.  If you haven't tried this restaurant and are considering it, do it! You will not regret that decision and everyone in your group will find something they like with the endless options in the menu."
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,4.0,9/29/2016,"Thinking about coming to Cheesecake Factory? Well it better be your cheat day because when I tell you that the level of calories in almost everything on the menu is threw the roof! I like this place because it reminds me a tad bit of the Grand Lux café. I am a cheesecake lover so the variety of cheesecakes that they have to offer are superb! The customer service here is always great from the many times I have visited. This location being inside of Caesars Palace so of course you know they have to step it up! For the food my friends and I ordered the Hot Spinach and Cheese dip along with the Fried Mac'n cheese bites for the appetizers. If you are into burgers at all look under the ""Glamburgers"" on the menu and try out the Macaroni and Cheese Burger! Sounds weird but trust me it has to be the best burger on the menu! Thai Chicken Pasta followed by the Miso Salmon were the remainder of dishes we ordered! Nobody had any complaints! I guess you can say it was a successful dinner, but wait.. that's not it! You can't come to The Cheesecake Factory and not get some cheesecake for desert! My favorite is the Red Velvet and Tiramisu! As I mentioned earlier there are plenty of options to choose from so do your taste buds a favor and indulge in one of them!"
Nina n.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,71,437,4.0,10/24/2015,"Luv this restaurant!! They give free bread basket(wheat and sour dough) the wheat is the best.. I tend to eat too much of it by the time my meal comes I'm stuff. They have the best calamari appetizer compare to all the ones I've tried.. It comes with their garlic aioli(always ask for extra cuz it's really GOOD) My fav. Dishes are the Pasta Da Vinci, orange chicken, jambalaya and Thai Lettuce wrap( get the one on the skinny menu) cuz it comes with 3 wrap prepare for you.. If sharing w/ someone than order the regular menu cuz it's a huge portion which I could never finish.. Luv Luv their cheesecake..hehe.. Well the name say it all rt?? Pricey but good.. I usually get the fresh strawberry, banana, tiramisu cheesecake.. They have so many different flavor it's unbelievable.. For some reason I always order the same one..guess I'm loyal..LOL"
Martin M.,"Hialeah, FL",0,240,260,5.0,12/20/2016,"Great experience at this restaurant. The server was very nice and personable. We had to been been shrimp, calamari, and bite-size crabcakes.  There is a really nice aquarium right outside of the restaurant. So, while you wait you can look at the live fish."
JX L.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",59,34,66,1.0,5/27/2015,"Zero star. Terrible service!    I left my bag there after I finish my meal, when I back home I realize my bag is in the restaurant, and I go back immediately, but the waiter tell me there was nothing on my table.   I go home again and still can not find my bag and I decide to call them back, but the lady who pick up the phone let me waiting on phone for 1 hour and then hang up my phone call.    I call them back again, they said they have my bag, and I drive all the way back again.   When the second time I go back, I ask for their manager, and I tell him I need to drive one hour to come here each time, and I spend two hours on driving and waiting on phone for one hour just for take my bag back.  And then the manager said: you house is far away from here is not our fault, and you wait on phone for one hour is system's fault, not us. And he keep saying we are big company, we not going to steal your bag. But all I want is a apologize ok? They treat me so mean, and I have the picture for that one hour phone call."
Jenna T.,"Conroe, TX",0,1,,2.0,7/28/2017,"Very unorganized, chaotic, and very rude hostesses. One of the male hostess was talking smack to the other hostesses about my mother in front of us. The wait service and food was fine, however our time was ruined by the horrible hostess staff."
Hannah C.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",90,63,94,3.0,7/30/2015,"Ate here my first two days of vacation and on my first day the server tried to rip me off on my bill. When I told her she shorted me on my change she gave me a ride look and didn't apologize. My bill was $69.45 and when I went up to her she claimed that the bill was $70. I told her you cannot round my bill up and short me money. She finally gave me back my change difference after a good five minutes. Poor customer service.  My second day the server I had brought us our waters with no straws and when we asked him for straws he put his finger tips all over the mouth pieces and then placed them in our drinks. I then told him we wanted sealed straws and he went and came back. During these three times he was at our table, not once did he ask us if we were ready to order he would look at our table and go to his other tables and help them. Very rude. I had to tell him we were ready to order and after a couple of times of me telling him we were ready he finally began to change his tune. I've never seen such poor service like this at the Cheesecake Factory. It's a great place to eat with a delicious menu, but the servers at this location are bad."
