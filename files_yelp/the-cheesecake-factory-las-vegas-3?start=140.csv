Pam L.,"New Castle, CO",17,8,,2.0,7/14/2017,Took forever to get our food. My huevos ranchero tasted like it had been sitting under the lamp for quite a while. Stiff and not very tasty. Our server did apologize and credited our bill for my food. (I only ate a few bites.) Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory!
Talibah T.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,14,3,1.0,12/22/2016,"This is my fourth time dinning at this location. Cheesecake Factory is obviously known for cheesecake, but also a variety of food and great service. I may be bias because I'm a local to Summerlin Las Vegas, but this location lacks ""great service"" the food is sub par, and food wait times are extremely long . Like I said I live in Summerlin and the Boca Park location has exceptional service, the food quality is much higher and the time it takes to receive your food is shorter. Each time dinning here it's been an extremely long time before our food came. If you're a local definitely avoid this location at all cost, I suppose it's convenient for tourist."
Samuel B.,"Irvine, CA",14,35,162,5.0,7/24/2015,"Oh man, their menu is a visual maze but the food is definitely fantastic. I think this is at least my 30th time at cheese cake factory, it just always ends up being the go to place for food for the people in my life.  I ordered the 4 cheese pasta and man was it gear. Very cheesy and very rich in flavor. I believe it was topped with ricotta and mixing that in with everything made the texture especially delicious.  Also had the margarita pizza. The thing about that pizza is it's not too heavy or greasy. The sauce is where it's at and its not a splatter of tomato sauce. It's smooth and hits the spot. Definitely a step up from cheese pizza, there isn't much of a difference anyway so I would say to just go for the margarita.  I ate an ahi appetizer, forgot what it's called but it was delicious... Except it was a tad bit expensive for the amount I got. I was expecting bigger chunks of ahi but I understand that ahi is an expensive fish. I have yet to really understand the world of expensive food but I am getting there.  Also the bread. Gotta love a place the gives out free bread.  Overall, great place. They have tons of options, so it can get overwhelming, but that's why I recommend trying new things! Just go for it!"
ed R.,"Culver City, CA",0,22,,4.0,7/20/2017,"Our family of three visited on a Monday evening around 6:30 and had about a 40 minute wait outside in the mall, then another 5 minute wait inside once called, but after we were seated all went well.  Very nice booth, great food and drink, generous portions, reasonable prices.  Service was pretty good overall considering the crowded conditions.  We were pleased with our dining choice, no disappointments.  Recommended."
Paul G.,"Camarillo, CA",79,19,2,5.0,7/7/2016,"Right from the start the service and attentiveness was great. We have two young children, one with diabetes, and the hostess and wait staff was very helpful with the timing and questions on the menu. Very cool being right next to the aquarium and Forum show. Styx was our server, and she was AMAZING."
anonymous m.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,24,5,2.0,12/28/2016,"Worse Cheesecake Factory I ever been to. Visited on 12/26/2016.  1) food was dry, bland and too salty.  2) ran out of Coke and without asking, the server brought me a Coke Zero, which I don't like  3) requested more wheat bread and came back 30 minutes later telling me there's no more wheat bread.  4) fryer out of service and no fried food.  5) no substitution on kids meal Apple juice with orange juice.  I am a regular to Cheesecake Factory in CA locations and this location is just one of the worse I ever been to."
Maribel B.,"Bolingbrook, IL",48,20,124,5.0,6/12/2016,We had lunch twice during my vacation in Vegas and both experiences were excellent! The staff was very friendly and attentive.  We were a group of 9 and we were still taken care of almost immediately. This location is inside the Venetian Hotel feeling like you are in Italy! We were also lucky enough to enjoy a show right before sitting down for lunch! If you are in the area I recommend for you to stop by and enjoy lunch or dinner!
Stuart K.,"Chino, CA",101,320,,4.0,11/23/2016,The Cuban sandwich was truly a treat. I don't know how they did it but a a masterpiece
Robert D.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,121,8,4.0,1/11/2017,"Great food, cheesecake, and great cocktails. A little pricy, but otherwise had a great experience with my fiance. The aquarium right outside the restaurant was fun too!"
Chris C.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",152,123,85,4.0,4/18/2015,"I can order anything on their menu at any location and can expect to always have awesome meal with great service and this location is certainly no exception.   Service was spot on, location was awesome next to all the great stores at Forum shops, and the food was excellent.  My favorite item has to be their chicken nachos...gotta try these! Main entree was the ribeye, seriously...for not being a steakhouse; their steak was cooked perfectly and had perfect flavor overall a perfect steak. I think they can give Flemmings and Ruth's Chris a run for their money as their steak is about $20 less and includes a side.  Once again...a Cheesecake Factory has provided an excellent experience and a desire to come back soon."
Griselle R.,"Placentia, CA",68,25,12,1.0,2/15/2017,If I can rate this a no star I would!!!! Worse customer service ever ..first we were waiting for ever for them to take our order . As we ordered our food I ordered Parmesan herb chicken and it comes with mashed potatoes and green beans I asked for corn succotash instead. We waited about 30 + for our food. Finally food came out my side of corn wasn't ready and server said just a few more minutes ... 10 minutes passed maybe even more nd nothing... finally the manager comes out and says they are all out of the corn succotash and what did I want instead .  At this time I was upset and told him to bring out fries. I didn't even eat the fries I was so upset that a busy resturant runs out of their own food. I waited about 10-15 min for our server to come out and to say they were all out. Then Our server never came back to check on us if we needed refills on our drinks . We finally got our check and I asked the server if I had to pay for the full plate since I didn't get a full plate bcz they were missing the corn and I never touched the fries. He said he would go talk to the manager about that . He offered me a free desert bcz he took for ever in helping us and he didn't check on us. He left and came back left the bill and took off really fast as we checked the bill we noticed that they charged me for the desert and then took it off. I waited for like 5 min and called him over as he was trying to avoid us. I told him to get his manager. He came out and I asked him if he was going to do something about my plate not being complete and his response was oh I already did ure taking the desert and I told him I didn't want the desert . And that the server said. He was giving us the desert bcz he didn't take care of us. And he said okay I didn't charge the corn and I told him he did bcz the plate was 17.50 and that's what I was getting charged. Then he said the corn was extra charge and I said I've never been charged extra for the corn and he said I can get the servers in trouble bcz they not charging right and I told him Ive always ordered this and have never been charged and he said o well ure lucky I dnt charge u. I told him I dnt want the cake the only reason I got it it's because the server said that was free bcz of his timing issue. He finally said he would take 5 buck off the bill. This manager was so not professional fighting w me instead of making a customer happy . I will never visit this place again. This managers name was Liam I think.
Kathleen T.,"Corona, CA",6,27,1,1.0,3/21/2017,"I'm giving this place a star because we were just a party of 2 who wanted & tried moving to a booth for two when a waitress came up to us & said  to sit where they assigned us & we couldn't sit at the unoccupied booth without permission. I was like okay I was about to ask the host. The host said it was fine & guess who was our waitress for the booth? The same rude waitress who told us we couldn't sit there meaning that it was most likely a part of her section. In my experience as a waitress, if my guests wanted to move to another table in my section they would be more then welcome to & not scolded. The worst part of our experience was we ordered our food and didn't get it until about an hour later. After the wait, you would think the food would be prepared well but both of our pasta dishes were dry. We had our waitress bring it back & the manager Aaron brought it to us & apologized. This occurred after the screw up which took up to an hour plus of our time. After arriving at 10pm & not getting our food till 11:10pm we were tired & just wanted to leave because we literally were one of the last tables before close. Our food was packed with no silverware as well. It's sad because it was our first night in town & we were hoping to be about but this cancelled our plans. Because of this experience, we won't be back at this location."
Andrew K.,"Sacramento, CA",23,11,5,5.0,9/18/2016,"I just finished dining there, and due to the long wait chose to sit at the bar. I just wanted to tell all that I thought the bartender was fantastic, I was there just to zone out, and not be bothered, and he did both. Very friendly, engaging with all the customers, but left me and kept making sure that my drinks were filled until I was ready to leave. Then once I was ready, checked me out got me on my way. Even took enough time to notice my name when I paid (with my credit card), and thanked me for coming in my name. Of course I didn't have catch his but great bartender!"
Elisa E.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,3.0,3/22/2017,Long story short there was 11 of us today and it took an hour after we were done eating to get our checks right and they still were not correct by the 4th time. We waited very patiently but still no manager came by to greet us or help with the situation. After going to several Cheesecake Factory's I would say there food is good but service could be better
Jessie S.,"Moab, UT",0,7,1,4.0,12/22/2016,"Make sure when you put your name down you literally stand by the hostess stand. If you stand by the fish tank they will skip over you. We were told it was a 15 min wait, we waited 30 mins and then we're told they already called us. After waiting about 45 mins, we finally were seated. The reason they are getting 4 stars is because our waitress Tina was incredible! She was so personable and after a horrible experience with the hostess stand, she really was able to turn our moods around. If we come back we will definitely be requesting her."
Katherine A.,"Las Vegas, NV",333,149,1660,4.0,1/12/2015,"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 10/100*** I've always been a fan of this place for those occasional calorie indulgence. We had family stay at Caesar's so we decided to dine in house. With reservations made ahead of time, everything was smooth sailing. I like that this location is quite large and that there are 2 floors of seating, although it can get pretty packed on the weekends and around dinner time. The menu is extensive so ordering is a task in itself lol. Somehow though, I always revert to my favorite Miso salmon, brown rice in lieu of white. Hubby got the Mac and Cheese burger which was cooked perfectly, rich and flavorsome. The madre got the Louisiana Chicken pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also had a taste of the fish tacos which were surprisingly good, the cilantro rice is one of the best I've tried. On the kids menu: chicken tenders and fries, well it's chicken tenders and fries, nothing much to elaborate. The mac and cheese that my son ordered was unsavory to put it mildly. It was dry and bland with no flavor profile at all. Our server must've noticed my sons dislike as he took one bite and ceased eating altogether hahaha so he offered to get him something else, my son wasn't feeling very well so he opted for the bread basket instead. Our server informed us he would have the mac and cheese taken out of the bill, we told him it wasn't necessary but he insisted. A red velvet cheesecake was shared amongst us as we were too stuffed to order more. Service was cordial and timely despite the dinner rush. When the bill came and noticed the mac and cheese was not taken out, he gladly rectified the situation which in turn we added to his tip as we appreciated the effort and kind gesture."
abeer s.,"Arlington, VA",5,22,3,5.0,10/21/2016,The wait was less then 10 minutes even though it was dinner time and the crowd was wrapped around the waiting area!! Service was impeccable and the food was amazing. Sure thing if you want to enjoy your experience!!!
Angela H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",225,29,29,5.0,4/22/2016,"I was craving cheesecake and well a trip to the strip happened!  We got there around nine  pm on a Thursday's night not too busy, and there was no wait time. However in case you come in a busy day there is always the aquarium and the show that happened to be conveniently located by the front of the restaurant to keep you entertain.  My boyfriend order a Long Island ice tea and I got a mojito. The mojito a was delicious ! We got the macaroni and cheese appetizer and since we were there for dessert the tiramisu cheese was our goal. The service was amazing and the atmosphere was relax since it was almost closing time."
Lior M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,7,,1.0,7/3/2016,"THE worst manger I have ever dealt with EVER. I had a party of 8, 2 were in the bathroom and they refused to seat us until 90% of our party was here. They finally seat us after 15 minutes (as we are still waiting for the 2 in our party). They give us 2 booths back to back. We wanted a table together. We saw 2 tables so we asked our waitress if we could connect the tables and sit together so she went to go ask. In the meantime we start setting up the tables. The manager (Amid which refused to give us his full name) walks up to all EIGHT of us (this is the first time I've seen this man) with an attitude and starts saying very rudely get up, no this is not what we agreed on either move tables or don't dine with us and get out. My sister calmly says we did not agree on anything and I have never seen you before. I dealt with the hostess. He says no no no and does not let my sister finish her statement as were walking away my brother asks what is your name I'm leaving a review he says Amid we then ask what is your last name he then proceeded to say I will not tell you we go back and forth for five minutes then says get out or I'll call security. Now to me this is no way to manage a restaurant I felt disrespected.  I would definitely not recommend this location!"
F C.,"Kahului, HI",0,23,,4.0,10/17/2016,"After a long walking around.  Since we had a late breakfast, my daughter and I got a bit hungry while waiting for the rest of our family who went gambling at the casino.  After, looking around to get a bite, we decided to try this restaurant.  Since it's 3 pm...we decided to get a light lunch and try their so called cheesecake.   The kale salad was great and the crab cakes wasn't that bad...the cheesecake was so good. So overall, service was ok, food is good and cheesecake is definitely a thumbs up!"
