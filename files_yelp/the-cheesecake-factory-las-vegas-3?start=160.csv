Christine S.,"San Diego, CA",98,6,2,5.0,6/22/2016,"I eat often at cheesecake in LA. I'm alway happy but for some reason the same food at this location (Las Vegas Form) is 100% better! Every dish I had had so much flavor, cooked right, simply succulent! I had the Chicken Piccata and that was simply the best I've ever had in my life. No kidding. In my next trip to Vegas, I'm definitely coming back here."
Ornella D.,"Los Angeles, CA",386,4,1,1.0,7/3/2016,"The manager came to us and asked us to move and we had asked why... he was aggressive cold and one worded. We had waited 35 minutes to be seated, I would think we can get an explanation. We are confused and he refused to share his full name , why we need to move and if somehow we could meet in the middle. He was more aggressive than anyone should treat anybody even outside of a restaurant. I am a regular and this was disappointing. His name is Amid! Now....I understand that people can be overwhelmed but no other cheesecakes who handles the same amount of stress would treat us the way he did. I'm am shocked. I literally don't want to support cheesecake if this is what they allow to handle the customers and certain circumstances. I would think a manager is hired to handle special situations accordingly. Not rudely and aggressive or cold. I'm shocked that cheesecake can allow this."
Cyn L.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",9,63,,5.0,12/27/2015,"You know what you're going to get at a Cheesecake Factory - large portions and tasty food - and you know what you're going to get on the Strip - sorted like cattle, overcharged, and rushed. At this location, we got all of the first and none of the second. They handle the crowds rather brilliantly - they take your name and tell you what time to come back, and when you return, you're swept directly to a table. It lessens the cattle-chute feeling when you get to just step up, step away, then return to be seated. We had a brilliant, wonderful waiter who nonetheless neglected to warn us we'd ordered too much food, but laughed along with us when we were defeated by the portion size. He was delightful and friendly, like everyone else we spoke to there, despite the weirdness of individuals in crowds (if you have 17 adults and five children, you need to ask for a table for 22, not a table for 17 ya weirdo). Prices were higher than a non-strip Cheesecake Factory, but not offensively so."
Tiffany W.,"San Francisco, CA",10,63,127,3.0,3/16/2016,"We ordered a pasta to go for my niece. It was seriously so delicious. We got the tomato basil pasta. We got to watch the statue show while waiting for our order, so that was fun. (: They were also kind enough to give us some extra utensils and another take out container so we could share.  It came with bread and butter, but the bread was hardened, so not enjoyable."
Michael W.,"Melbourne, Australia",28,185,137,4.0,1/3/2015,"As a tourist to a foreign land, one quite often uses Hollywood as a platform for whether it be tourist attractions, product endorsements and/or lifestyle changes. When it comes to eating, everyone from outside the United States would love to get served by Penny from the Big Bang Theory, which bought me to this little establishment about 4 years ago & keep returning annually when I revisit the States.  Situated in the Caesars Palace forum mall, the Cheesecake Factory is located right at the end of the mall, right next to the huge fish tank. I somehow always end up with seating outside looking at the fish tank, which is fine by me as it is an alright view.  The service can be a little slow at times, but generally is pretty good. The quality of the food is great, and overwhelmingly large, however you come to expect that here. Just make sure that you leave a little room for dessert.  PS. The chicken Bellagio is probably better here than anywhere else in the country - as freaky as that sounds, it is true..."
Michele C.,"Monroe, WI",16,8,6,4.0,5/13/2016,Ate here for a late lunch.  Waited about 10 mins for a table.  Service was a little slow to start but our server quickly picked up the pace.  Fried mac-n-cheese balls were amazing as was the Parmesan cheese bread.  We also had a slice of cherry cheesecake and a slice of banana cream cheesecake.  Both were delicious.
Sylvia S.,"Brea, CA",2,23,1,1.0,7/20/2016,"I went on a Tuesday Night and all I can say is that this place is poorly managed. I will never attempt this place on a weekend, because the turn around time is slow. Starts off with the front desk which has a poor system of seating people. The hostess are not friendly at all. Our server was overwhelmed to say the least. There are so many restaurants in Vegas, not worth your time waiting for this place.  As a side note: what restaurant runs out of Salmon on a Tuesday Night?"
Carmen T.,"Coquitlam, Canada",207,180,232,2.0,1/13/2017,"Unfortunately our visit here was far from superior. We were seated ( 3 of us) at a table and were not acknowledged by our server , no water or bread.  We were glancing at our menus and other tables were then seated and approached by our server.   We did not recieve any service until 15/20 mins.   We had ordered our food and waited another 30 mins and proceeded to speak with a manager. The manager then switched our server to prevent any more mis communication.  Our food came and one of our dishes did not arrive (5-10mins later).  The dressing for one of our salads also did not arrive.  We were then presented with our new server whom took care of us. The manager did not seem very sympathic to us as she was just doing what she thought was good and did not go above and beyond.   Unfortunately our experience was not the greatest although the other times we have gone we have had amazing experiences."
Shannon D.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,19,,2.0,7/24/2016,Went here last night with a few friends around midnight (so they weren't busy at all) I was disappointed with the food first I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp the shrimp was WAY too over fried that I had to peel off the fried part and just eat the shrimp also the sauce that came with made me & my husbands stomach hurt. We also ordered the Louisiana Pasta which we had to send back to the kitchen because there was almost no sauce on the pasta. Salads were good but I asked for the smallest caesar &  she ended up bringing & charging me for the bigger one. We had to ask for lemons for our water 4 times before finally getting them. I do love Cheesecake Factory but last night I wasn't happy with my experience.
Jorge Luis S.,"Tappan, NY",15,24,201,5.0,3/7/2016,This is a great restaurant inside the Cesar's palace mall..good service but the only thing I don't like is that you have to put away your own left overs. Beside that is a great place with good food.
Jami K.,"Coos Bay, OR",2,14,2,5.0,6/29/2015,"Amazing! Having never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, I was very impressed. Prompt service, even with a long line. Got the luau salad for lunch, it was quite different but very tasty. I expected the prices to be crazy, but they were very affordable.  We were so impressed, we came back for dinner. The pasta was so good, Even though I was stuffed, the meal was so good that I couldn't stop eating. My husbands ""medium"" steak came out super rare, but he ate it anyway and said it was good. He didn't get any veggies with his steak, just a bowl of mashed potatoes, with a few onion rings plopped on top. Besides the weird steak dinner, the food was still excellent, as well as the service. Next time we are in Vegas, we will stop here again for sure."
Pat T.,"Henderson, NV",0,1,,2.0,8/31/2017,"I ordered takeout to bring back to my room at Caesars.  Chicken and biscuits, steak Diane and mac and cheese.  The cashier said 20 minutes, and I came back at 15 minutes and saw a bag near the register.  After waiting 5 minutes for the people ordering cheesecake to get their orders, I got her attention and asked if it was mine.  She said yes but she was waiting on the mac and cheese.  After another ten minutes she said it shouldn't be much longer, and finally went back to check and came out with it.  I said my dinners had to be ice cold by now and she very rudely said it's fine and handed me the bag.  When I opened the dinners a few minutes later (it only took three minutes to get back to Caesars) the food was ice cold and garbage.  It was almost a half hour from when the dinners came out until the dried up mac and cheese was added.  Totally unacceptable that a takeout order leaves the kitchen before everything is ready.  We threw most of it out because it was inedible."
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,2.0,4/12/2013,"So I thought this would be a perfect place to grab lunch and OMG wish we would have just grabbed some Pupusas... what a disappointment! Our waiter was like a walking zombie-idiot with no service skills whatsover.  He never even introduced himself-I thought he was the busboy and they were shortstaffed.  Just worthless!  Our table was a booth and they stuck a chair at the end of it and it was located next to the silverwear, so every waiter/busboy who came by every 15 seconds to rattle silverwear...ugh...noisy and bothersome!  We should have left. I ordered a boring plain chopped salad that was tasteless.  Kids had grilled cheese and pasta, so thank goodness I was able to take bites out of their decent food.  Sisters got..I don't even remember because I couldn't wait to get out of there and we even skipped dessert because the waiter was so useless! It will be a while before I go back!"
Nicole T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,4.0,3/26/2017,"Food was good, atmosphere is a lil chaotic with tbe crowd outsude aquarium and statue show but Dave was a great waiter."
Anne P.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,18,4,1.0,7/7/2016,"Best to eat here if you don't mind waiting 1:30 for your meal (when you put the entire order in when you sat down) and you want to be called a liar by Joe the manager who says the meal was ""coursed out"". Because we ordered drinks and an appetizer.   Like someone tell Joe he doesn't work at Spago and this shit ain't coursed out. And don't question how long we've waited when we have proof we sat down at 8:30pm and still had no food at 10pm. Screw you, Joe the Manager. I'll give you a ""course""....in customer service."
Rafael B.,"Curitiba, Brazil",0,54,,3.0,10/14/2016,Excelent service. Meat loaf was okay. Cheesecakes were great. Fine Arnold Palmer.It was a goofs spot to rest and get a bite after a long walk
Felicia L.,"Long Beach, CA",600,1593,658,4.0,11/30/2014,"My girlfriends and I found ourselves drunk and starving at the Forum Shops one Saturday afternoon. Too tired to find a cheap place to eat (which was hard in the Forum Shops) but not wanting to spend a crazy amount of money for lunch, we found the Cheesecake Factory! I know... we can find this restaurant back at home... but we were really hungry and the Factory never really had failed us in the past. We were seated right away, and we sobered up quickly with their complimentary bread, lol. We decided to eat light (as we planned to eat greasy pizza later that night) so we ordered calamari and the luau salad, which were both very good and served in big portions. We ended the lunch with a macadamia nut cheesecake, in celebration for my late birthday with my girlfriends! Overall, it was a good experience with good food and good friends. We're glad to have found this restaurant while super drunk. Thanks!"
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2912,14296,5.0,8/1/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory has 3 entries on Yelp.  It was Happy National Cheesecake Day on July 30 & July 31st, 2014 so I went over to a Cheesecake Factory (not this branch) to have a slice of cheesecake at 1/2 price!! Anyways the following is my review for this location written back in February 2014: I must confess that I am a diehard Cheesecake Factory fan!  Unless the service is very bad, I will not give them less than 4 stars.  This specific location inside Caesars Palace holds a special place in my heart, but I will not go into specifics.  Suffice it to say that I love this place! Normally, I get here before it gets too crowded.  Sometimes I will have to wait, but it is worth the wait.  Will just wait and people watch or browse around some of the Forum shops til it is our turn. The menu reads like a small book.  It can get confusing at times cause everything sounds so good.  Every appetizer and entree that I have had has not disappointed.  All are above average, and the portions are huge so come hungry.   Of course, a meal here is not complete without dessert.  I will always save room for a slice of cheesecake.  If it means that I cannot finish my entree, then I will just take home the leftovers and enjoy it the next day.  I have tried over a dozen of their cheesecake flavors.  My current favorites are Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut cheesecake, and White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. I only have one complaint.  Stop discontinuing my favotite sandwiches.  They used to make a three cheese Grilled Cheese sandwich which was awesome.  They also used to make a Monterey Cheeseburger which was the bomb.  I truly miss those two items.   With that being said, every time we return to Caesars Palace, going to this Cheesecake Factory is a must.  Many good memories here."
Lynn G.,"Las Vegas, NV",393,408,772,5.0,11/8/2015,"What can I say about Cheesecake Factory... We have been to this location a few times over the years. Sometimes they are very busy and there is a wait.  I enjoy sitting out front and just watching the fish in the HUGE aquarium it is amazing and fun to pass the time while you wait. We have never had a bad experience, the food is always very good, Portions are good. This is one of those places if your in Caesars Palace you just want to eat at because you know the food is good. I hate trying new places and getting ripped off! Here you never feel like your ripped off. You may go home with some of your food if you aren't real hungry. Over all we Highly recommend this place, you can not go wrong eating here!!"
Diana C.,"Long Beach, CA",1,22,,1.0,12/23/2016,"The other night my family and I went to this location to have dinner and it was the worst experience. First, there was a wait, which was fine because the place was busy. Second we got seated in a section where there was food on the floor and the server Shawn took over 20 minutes to even walk over and get our drink order. We were very upset by then because our two little girls were hungry and ready to eat. Then, once he came over he took our order for drinks and food at once, the good thing in our appetizer came out very quick which was a lifesaver. However, our food is a different story, it took SO long for it to get to us and when it did, my husband's rice was so hard and he sent it back to be replaced. After waiting for Shawn to get back to us to let him know about it he rice. The plate was brought back to much later with the same orange chicken which was cold by then with the rice replaced. As we were having our meal, finally, our drinks were not refilled and we had spent so much time there that the option of getting dessert was not even something we wanted to wait for so we got it at the cashier on our way out. Not from Shawn, he is not a very good server at all and we were extremely disappointing by our decision to dine at this location."
