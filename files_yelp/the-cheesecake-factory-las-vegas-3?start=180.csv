Eleanor S.,"Singapore, Singapore",1,2,7,5.0,3/22/2016,"First timers in USA. Had this twice at the Vegas north premium outlet branch. I think they just opened this new branch as part of their new expansion. We were pleasantly surprised that the Coke were refillable, the portion here were ALL SO HUMONGOUS, we had a hard time finishing our food. We particularly liked the nachos--they were crisp enough, well salted, and huge in size! Prices are reasonable too. We loved the attentive service also. Well recommended for a hearty meal, I think most people will have smth inside the menu to satisfy their craving."
Erin S.,"Perth, Australia",56,89,334,5.0,10/28/2014,Literally just walked out of the Cheesecake Factory at Caesars Palace & it was yum!   They stayed open a little later than normal just because of the amount of people still eating. We had the onions rings & crab wontons. Also the skinnylicious chicken tacos & salmon & skampi combo. The Chris cheesecake was delicious but very sickly sweet. 2 of use couldn't finish it.  Great meals & great friendly service. Ps: No wonder Sheldon eats here ! :)
Lee D.,"Chinatown, Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,5.0,2/8/2017,Great as we last remembered. Try the guacamole as it can be added to any other dish you order. Had the leftovers on the Cubano sandwich. Michael was our server and he represents the level of service and quality of food that Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux offers. Always a must visit to both places when in Vegas.
Becky H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",12,28,,5.0,8/27/2016,Sheena was our server today and was really sweet!  She made our experience here such a wonderful one.  We will surely come back to this Cheesecake Factory when we are in town.  The chocolate turtle cheesecake was the bomb!!!
Jessy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,131,304,4.0,12/18/2015,"Was here last night for my friend's birthday dinner and had a blast. Despite the host attempting to seat us at an awkward corner, the experience was great once we got seated in a private booth. The food was amazing  (parmigian grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables) as well as the sherly temple I had as a beverage. Second time coming to this establishment  (first time in Virginia Beach) and will definitely come back again....mainly for the cheesecake!"
Mark O P.,"Las Vegas, NV",74,152,412,4.0,6/23/2015,The Old Fashioned Hamburger was nice and juicy. The Original Cheesecake was delicious as always. Service was fast and attentive. Will come back again if in need of a cheesecake fix.
Ben K.,"Ventura, CA",24,45,42,4.0,12/25/2016,"Believe it or not, this was my first time eating a meal at The Cheesecake Factory. I've picked up a few slices of cheesecake at the Thousand Oaks location, but hadn't sat down to eat until now. I was a little hesitant to visit a chain restaurant during our Vegas trip, but after looking at the menus of other nearby establishments, TCF seemed like the best option. And speaking of options, there is something for everyone here. The menu is like a novel. I can see this being a great place for large families, because one person may want Mexican another pasta, etc. The service here was very good. They came to refill water often. I had a roasted chicken dish with potatoes and carrots. I was pleasantly surprised, being that it is a chain restaurant. The portions were plenty and there was no room for yummy cheesecake. And everything was reasonably priced. If you're going to choose a chain restaurant, this is one of the better ones."
James F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,1,1.0,9/18/2015,I am giving ZERO stars (but it forces me to give 1) because I ordered a chicken caesar salad and it was almost $18.00 and had a shit-ton of lettuce but barely any chicken.  This was a to go item so clearly why don't you mess with the girl that won't open it up until she get back to work.  Thanks for the 6 pieces of croutons that you dumped in there and the crusty old bread that you gave me with it....totally worth the $18.00.  I'm glad you put so much friggin lettuce in there.  This salad should cost a MAX of $8!!  Get that straight!i
Jen N.,"La Puente, CA",294,73,1023,5.0,7/31/2015,"Wait wasn't long at all! Service was amazing and so was the food. Plus, there is a shopping center for you to browse while you wait. Definitely recommend!"
Jayson C.,"Las Vegas, NV",95,36,10,2.0,6/21/2016,Watch out locals they always treat the locals poorly here which is too bad because it's a great close place to take visiting family and friends....we just waited 25min. for a 5 top and sat on the first floor with 22 open tables ready and set at 5:30pm?!  Every time I come to this location it's always something I think they are just used to tourists not complaining or having any feedback because they have no choice.
Annie H.,"Las Vegas, NV",391,90,445,5.0,5/27/2015,"Cheesecake Factory has got to be one of my favorite restaurants! I loved it when I lived in Washington and I still love it when I tried it in Vegas. I am a big fan of there happy hour menu and drinks, very delicious. However if I have to choose my favorite by far... Has got to be the Luau Salad! So delicious!!! Nutty, sesame goodness with a thick layer of crispy wonton sheet and chicken breast. They have it in there lunch special menu as well :)"
Ella R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,21,2,3.0,4/30/2016,The place is okay. If they get too busy then don't expect them to go back and fourth all around you. The food is good though.
Zhaoxin F.,"Chicago, IL",2,6,7,5.0,12/31/2016,they have the best cheesecake countrywide. We were able to get one to celebrate a friends birthday.
M M.,"Howell, MI",1,40,68,4.0,2/21/2016,"Went here with my parents after a long morning walk. Service was great, food was great. Dad and I had the crispy chicken sandwich with chipotle, he had fries and I had onion rings. Mom had special.... small sandwich with salad and potato soup. The fries and chicken sandwiches were excellent! The potato soup was the best mom had had at a restaurant. The salad was good as was her sandwich (turkey, I believe). The onion rings were ok but had a lot of batter and not a lot of onion. I would get the fries next time. If you're able to stay for the ""moving statue"" show, totally worth it. Loud but really good atmosphere and plenty of people watching."
Rox R.,"Las Vegas, NV",179,72,290,3.0,6/19/2015,"We went here because we had family in town & they were staying at Caesars Palace & wanted to eat here. It's nice & big but because it's on the strip in the forum shops, the wait to get seated is kind of long. They have to call us on our cellphone to let us know when seating is available. When you get inside, it feels kind of cramped. It took a longer time then normal to get our orders taken. The have a big menu. So much to choose from. They even have a menu for people watching their calories.   For refreshments, I had the strawberry lemonade. It was super tangy. Very strong flavor. I'm not sure if it's just me because I'm pregnant & my taste buds are more sensitive or it really is just super sour. It took a long time to get our food & honestly it wasn't very satisfying. Our appetizers were ok. I had the eggplant Parmesan & it was bland but the linguini noodles was super salty. I couldn't finish my meal. The only thing I like about Cheesecake Factory is their cheesecakes."
AD K.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,66,29,5.0,1/13/2016,"Came by for dinner on a Monday night. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Our server, I forget his name, was awesome. It was too loud in the area to be able to hear him unless he leans over and speaks up.. Perhaps it's just me and my hearing? *shrug* I didn't have a big appetite that night. Just ordered something off their ""skinny menu"" ones with smaller portions and ""lower"" calories. Had the Ahi Tartare and the chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. Both was enjoyable and was filling, for me.  All in all, very affordable, great for a date or with a large party. You have the option to sit inside or ""outside"".  The restroom is upstairs on the second floor. Kind of a little journey just to wash your hands!"
Correen B.,"Garden Grove, CA",388,533,303,3.0,4/30/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory is like all of the others. Consistent.  That is actually what made McDonalds famous- consistency.  It's very crowded, quite loud, and if you are lucky enough to get a patio seat you will be treated to the Poseidon show complete with smoke, water and flames.  My husband went with a chicken pasta dish, and I opted for the chicken tostada salad.  Both were good as usual.  The service was excellent, as it should be in a big hospitality based town.    Is it flash, fancy or different-no, but if you are looking for a quick meal without breaking the bank, then here's your place."
Robyn R.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,108,2,2.0,6/21/2016,"Nothing spectacular. This is your run of the mill Cheesecake Factory, but the service is subpar compared to other Cheesecake factories."
Shakira D.,"Bellingham, WA",7,20,1,5.0,6/10/2016,This was great it's inside the Cesar's palace shopping area and is usually packed but they are very organized and were able accommodate gluten free requests!
Tom S.,"Abbeville, MS",3,190,136,4.0,7/4/2016,Can't miss with the chix salad sandwich. Splitted it with the chopped salad. Yum o.  Jennifer was a great server. Thanks.  Surprised to see how quiet it was. Thank god because we were hungry.   Finished with the new salted Carmel cheesecake. Very good.
