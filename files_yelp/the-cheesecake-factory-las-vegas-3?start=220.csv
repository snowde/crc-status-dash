Terri D.,"North Branford, CT",4598,409,1301,4.0,1/12/2015,"Came for dinner on 12/27/14.  Called from Planet Hollywood prior to ask how long the wait for 2 people would be, we were told currently it was an hour with no reservations available to make or give a name.  We made the trip over there, speak to the host and ask to put our name down for 2 people.  He gives us a look and a groan, so my response was ""what, the wait is now up to 2 hours?""  His reply was ""Actually it's odd, I can seat you immediately right now.""  WHAT!  Score!  We were seated in literally 4 minutes.  This must have been a rare case, because we ended up being seated still in close proximity to the host platform and all the rest of parties of 2 coming in after us were all being told an hour wait and to take their name down.  I guess we were just lucky. All of the food was amazing, we had burgers and mac and cheese balls.  So good.  We ended up taking a few slices of cheesecake to go because he had a fridge in our hotel room.  The lemon meringue one was awesome! We had a great experience!"
Kaylyn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,205,10,3.0,4/10/2016,"The best part of our visit was that the server was pretty attentive.  The worst part is that we had to send one of the meals back.  The cheese sauce on the mac-burger tasted bad.  This is something that the person who ordered it has apparently had many times at other CF's, and he said that the sauce on this wrong tasted bad, as in spoiled.  The server was nice and took it off our check."
Amy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,59,12,4.0,7/6/2015,"Waiting time was 3 hours but, then again it  was the 4th of July Angel hair pasta was very salty, notified our waitress she just apologized, my son had the chicken piccata and was so salty as well Tell your waitress to make sure pasta is not salty Utensils were all dirty including my plate Overall food and portion is always great here"
Gracie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",401,2,,5.0,5/1/2016,"I literally just created a Yelp account to share my thoughts about this restaurant and our waitress Julia. She was SUCH a sweetheart! We were able to sit outside in the ""patio"" part and the wait wasn't even long considering it is in the forum shops, and it was a busy Sunday afternoon. The service was great, Julia went above and beyond to make sure my friend and I had everything we needed. It's not often that you find servers who genuinely care about their customers so this really meant a lot to me and made my Vegas experience that much better. I will definitely return to this Cheesecake Factory during my next visit (Hopefully my new friend Julia will be here again)!"
Kaja H.,"Oslo, Norway",9,60,176,4.0,6/18/2014,"This restaurant really lives up to previous reviews. The restaurant is huge, and there are a ton of staff. The menu is a bit too big, but everyone will find something they like. I had the chicken bellagio, and it was delicious. My husband had the chicken madeira, and he loved it too. The portions were gigantic though, and it feels like such a waste. I only managed to eat about half. We shared the chocolate mousse cheesecake and the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake, and both were amazing. I'm always impressed when such a big and busy (and afforable) restaurant can produce food this good.  Be warned the location can be a bit noisy, and I definetly recommend being seated inside. It's a busy place as well, but we only had to wait 15 minutes to be seated when we came on a Monday night."
Matt B.,"London, United Kingdom",137,511,5,4.0,1/3/2014,"We stumbled across the Cheesecake Factory amongst the general madness of the Caesar Forum shops and were very quickly seated as the rest of the line were larger groups than our two. The server was really friendly helpful and gave good tips on what to see and do in Las Vegas. I'm impressed that there were so many choices on the menu, it must be a logistical nightmare to maintain. I ordered pasta and meat sauce which was huge but as I was starving the whole lot was polished off quickly. Sadly this left no room for dessert."
Vanessa N.,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",9,24,27,5.0,9/11/2015,"Love this place. Ate here twice in a 12 day vacation in Vegas. Have previously eaten multiple times at the one in Orlando and they're both of same great standard. Food is reasonably priced, delicious and generous sized portions. In previous orders I've had the mushroom burger, Kobe burger, bbq chicken pizza and some sort of pasta and each dish was delicious. I've never had a bad meal here.  The service was fantastic too! I've tried the vanilla bean cheesecake twice, the carrot cake (not cheesecake) twice and the red velvet cheesecake once. The red velvet was the least favourite of mine but the carrot cake is probably THE best carrot cake I've ever tried anywhere and the vanilla bean cheesecake flavours are to die for, delicious!  The location in Vegas has two floors so plenty of space to get seated even if it is busy.  Wether in Vegas or Orlando the Cheesecake Factory is my go to restaurant when I have a sweet craving!"
Jamey C.,"Newtown, PA",34,44,36,5.0,7/25/2015,"My husband & I couldn't believe how well we ate for the price we paid. The service was very good, the atmosphere was not loud despite being located inside the Forum Shops & our food was wonderful!"
Lee B.,"Seattle, WA",0,70,2,5.0,5/2/2016,"We ate here while visiting Las Vegas. It was amazing. I had the chicken enchiladas, came with rice and beans, much much better than most Mexican restaurants! My husband had the salmon dinner, came with mashed potatoes and broccoli, he said he felt it was the same as fine dining salmon! Excellent!"
Karl L.,"Singapore, Singapore",39,15,39,4.0,9/25/2015,Great lunch. The dishes was much over my expectations. I had the Bellagio chicken pasta which tasted great and my wife had the anti-oxidant salad which was not too bad. Cheesecakes here are all well made and we chose the original one which tasted slightly too cheesy to my taste.
April L.,"Las Vegas, NV",145,53,111,4.0,6/13/2015,Our server was very patient with us considering that we were part of a big group but separate table.
Tara G.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",70,166,15,4.0,1/5/2015,"There isn't a Cheesecake Factory in my city, so I don't mind one bit visiting this one when I'm out in Vegas. Though it's location at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's is a bit inconvenient, the longest I've had to wait for a seat was 40 minutes even during busier seasons (once for a party of 11 and once for a party of 4). Both times I've eaten here, the service was impeccable, and of course the portions are huge, the food tasty, and all well worth the price. My friend swears by the Chicken Madeira, though I never order it because I don't eat mushrooms. The mac-and-cheese burger is delicious, as is the chicken burrito (though I would have preferred it to have shredded chicken rather than cubed). I also really enjoy the Flying Gorilla alcoholic milkshake. I don't eat here EVERY time I go to Vegas, but it's definitely a good option, and probably one of the better ones in regards to price - especially in the Forum Shops. Again, I can't stress enough that both times I ate here the service was great (in a town where I usually find the service to be average at best)."
Scott M.,"Springfield, MO",2,55,41,5.0,7/29/2015,"Love this place. Great food and great service. Highly recommend this place. Been there twice over two year's  and both times were great. Wait was reasonable to get a table both times. Got desert because it looked so good, had to take it to go, I was too full."
Anne F.,"Fairfax, VA",90,55,63,3.0,1/5/2016,Met friends for Happy Hour.  It's cold outside and there's not enough seating in the bar area and no place to hang your coats.  Prices were high.  I think I'll suggest Brio for HH next time.
Lia B.,"Philadelphia, PA",183,296,29,5.0,12/7/2014,"I absolutely never in a million years thought that I would give a Cheesecake Factory 5 stars.  I was in Vegas for the marathon and my friends and I needed to find a place to eat the morning of our race.  I didn't want to do a buffet and I also wanted something very plain and simple due to the fact that 4 hours later I'd be running 26 miles.   We stumbled up Cheesecake Factory and I honestly had low expectations, but I was extremely wrong! Times have changed and while the pasts is not vegan and like pretty much no entree is veganizable - I had a great meal! our server was amazing - she pretty much just created a vegan feast (plain and simple though) out of sides, appetizers and salad.  I had a great meal and a great experience - but um hello potion sizes there are huge!"
Jolie D.,"Saint Louis, MO",277,405,108,4.0,10/18/2014,"So, the final verdict is out. 312 menu items, not including beverage offerings. Holy crap. If you can't find something you like at Cheesecake Factory, you are just a grumpy Gus.  I had the taco salad-type dish. It was ok - sooo much lettuce - but my friend had the Santa Fe sandwich, which he said was tasty. Wine was good and didn't break the bank.  This location is apparently the busiest in the world. I wouldn't doubt it... It's always packed."
Autumn C.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,5,2,2.0,7/5/2015,"The food is great as always but the manager was rude and not understanding. They said its a half hour wait to eat on the patio and hour wait to eat inside, we waited the hour to eat inside and they placed us at a table in the doorway-half of us sitting inside and half outside. Very awkward seating and the manager told us we either take this table or leave. We had waited so long we stayed to eat but it was awkward the entire time, being bumped by waiters coming in and out"
Derek L.,"Aurora, Canada",45,383,103,4.0,2/12/2014,"Just plain good.  I stopped in at Ceasars Palace location in the Forum for a quick lunch.  I am addicted to the Iced Mint Green Tea, and usually start with the Tuna Tartare.  For a non-sushi restaurant, it is not surprising to get a bad order of tuna that has been sitting around just a bit too long, but Cheesecake Factory has never let me down. Today I deviated from my usual Garlic Shrimp Pasta, and tried the Enchiladas.  3 nicely done tortillas filled with chicken, and smothered in melted cheese, with a side of beans and cilantro rice.  Great fuel for the long walking distances in Vegas!"
Tori K.,"Eugene, OR",38,143,54,5.0,2/10/2015,I have been wanting to try a Cheesecake Factory for quite some time... I was excited to get the chance to on my latest trip to Las Vegas and I was not disappointed!  We went for lunch on a Tuesday and did not have a wait to get seated (yay!).  The prices of items on the menu were surprisingly very reasonable.  The restaurant was very clean and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  My husband had a buffalo burger and fries.  He said it tasted great and was very filling.  I had the herb crusted filet of salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  I was very pleased with it; tasted fresh and delicious.  For desert we shared the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake.  Holy. Cow. It was so good.  You must eat desert when you go there... it is named after cheesecake after all!  Worried about not having room for it? Eat it first!
Shinichiro W.,"Las Vegas, NV",189,167,153,4.0,1/7/2015,Great food. Great people. Open late. And they have happy hours and deals on certain things. Foods of all kind. And they change the menu a lot. So you can always find something new to try. Definetly a place for dinner parties and families. They also have a show right in front for the tourists since we r in Las Vegas Baby!!!!
