Kevin P.,"Las Vegas, NV",303,447,1213,4.0,6/24/2011,"Wait time is long, everything else is fab.   I came here with a friend and we met up with a party of 11.  As a large party and almost guaranteed a phat tip we were still treated pretty well.  I got the tuna and my friend got the miso salmon.  For some reason my tuna was cooked so you could see gray/white throughout, the last two times I had it where my tuna was red/rose.  I don't know what the norm is but they made it the way I wanted.   You have to limit yourself to the food because the best part is the dessert!  It's not called Cheesecake Factory because of the pasta or meat or fish.  There are no items on the menu with name's like Cheesecake ahi tuna or Cajun Cheesecake Jumbalaya but White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle or Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake!  Mmmm!! So my fav: Miso Salmon!!  Wasabi Encrusted Ahi Tuna!!!!  Steak Diane!  Cajun Jambalaya Pasta!  And the above Cheesecakes!"

Alex F.,"Temecula, CA",0,22,,5.0,9/30/2016,"Best Restaurant in all of the Forum Shops!!!  Reasonable prices for food, especially Vegas Food. (YIKES)   But great food and great service!!!!"
Aaron J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,4.0,11/1/2016,I love this place !! Great service and outstanding food. I would like to eat here again and again... Lol
Julie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1073,280,2724,4.0,4/9/2013,"I have been coming to this Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember haha It's huge with a ""patio"" area and 2 floors~ Inside is very beautiful too I hate how the restrooms are located upstairs though.. The wait can be long at times so we only come at odd times now.. I know people tend to hate on chain restaurants but I think CF is one of the better ones.. Their portions are huge and the food is tasty.  Must Haves: -Chicken Madeira: Everyone's favorite. Its just 2 chicken breasts with madeira sauce, cheese, mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.. If I'm trying to watch what I eat I substitute the mashed potatoes for broccoli..  -Cajun Jambalaya Pasta: It is not too overly spicy and has just the right amount of kick. -Chicken Lettuce Wraps: If I want something healthy-ish that's not a salad I get this dish.. It's huge so it will fill you up.. They even have noodles as one of the toppings. -Carlton Salad: It's tasty and fresh but the dressing has a very strong sesame oil taste so you may want to ask for the dressing on the side or another dressing. -Bread: Love their bread.. Especially the sweet brown one mmmmm haha -Strawberry lemonade: Sugar rimmed glass.. perfect for a hot Vegas day  Service is always friendly and it's a fun place to people watch after or before you shop at Forums~  HOT TIP: If you decide to get a salad you can swap out lettuce for mixed field greens free of charge.. yummmm ;]]]"
Larissalyn M.,"Kaneohe, HI",165,11,5,4.0,8/28/2016,"Can't ever really go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. The portions are huge, food is pretty good, decent price for a restaurant, and the cheesecakes are amazing. Went here for a date night with my boyfriend one night. I never realized how huge this Cheesecake Factory is! Didn't expect it to be as big as it was. It's a little too dimly lit, in my opinion. We were seated near the kitchen area and given free bread. It was extremely cold in here...I wish I had brought a jacket. We knew the portions here are huge, so decided to share an appetizer of crispy crab wontons and one entree of the alfredo fettuccine with mushrooms and chicken. The crab wontons came out quickly. They were extremely hot and we burned our tongues on them. ): They tasted great though! The pasta came out soon after. The pasta was heavy and filled us up quickly. Even though we were sharing all of this, we almost didn't order dessert. ALMOST. How can you go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake?! We ended up ordering a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. It was delicious. Lots of gooey cookie dough pieces in the middle. We were only able to finish half of it because we were so full. The total was about $50, which isn't too bad for how full we were. This is probably one of the cheapest restaurants to eat at on the Strip."
Kevin S.,"Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",168,360,532,5.0,7/24/2013,"When I stumbled into The Cheesecake Factory while checking out the shops inside The Forum Shops at Caesars, all I could think about was Penny and the guys from The Big Bang Theory. I abso-freakin-lutely love this show so you can imagine how stoked I was to find this place.  Nothing else mattered at that moment... I had to try it! I went there twice and loved it both times. The First time was for dinner (and dessert as well merci beaucoup!) - I had their kobe burger w/ fries and it was pretty good. For dessert, I had their original cheesecake w/ Graham Cracker Crust and Sour Cream topping.... So good! The second I went was in sometime in the morning and all I wanted was another cheesecake so I sat down and said to the waiter: ""Cheesecake please.."" He recommended the Vanilla Bean cheesecake so I went with that and it was amazing! I wish we had one in Melbourne.. I really like it - the staff are very nice, I like the setup (nothing too formal nor too casual). It's a great place to chill and the price is quite reasonable too... I highly recommend it."
Kim W.,"Quebec City, Canada",14,118,67,4.0,1/21/2014,"The food and service is always great when we come here.  We got the garlic cheese bread as an appetizer: excellent! I got the mushroom burger, which was delicious since I'm a big mushroom lover.  For dessert, I got the red velvet cheesecake... Amazing!!  We will be back!"
Melissa C.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,22,8,4.0,4/9/2016,Really enjoyed lunch at this location. The food was quick and service professional. Fried Mac N Cheese was delicious.  Cole slaw and fish and chips not bad either.  Wish I had room for desert. Still left with left overs. Portion sizes too big. I like to sample a bit of everything.
Joanna T.,"Wauwatosa, WI",416,2212,1021,3.0,4/9/2013,"I'm generally indifferent to the Cheesecake Factory - to me it's basically two star food from a pointlessly long menu, served in ginormous portions in a painfully loud space. This CF was better than average with really, really good service. We ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps and Summer Rolls and both were fresh and pretty darn tasty. Cheesecake Factory still isn't my favorite, but this location is much better than most others."
Tanya C.,"Atlanta, GA",47,24,35,5.0,3/15/2015,This is a cheap spot we visit all the time when in Las Vegas...we usually visit Las Vegas for spring break since my son was 9years old....but now that he is in college he do different things for spring break.  The food is fool proof...I order 1 of 2 items the Louisiana chicken pasta or the Jerk shrimp...both are really good in my opinion...our last visit we had the most amazing waiter and the best margarita!
Gillian W.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",2,4,,1.0,6/27/2016,"Disappointing. I work in the forum shops so I have ate at this location for the past two years. I ordered a to go order, skinny steak medallions.... Come with potatoes, asparagus and cherry tomatoes. I've ordered this exact many times. So today when I picked up my food and got back to my store I opened and was disappointed in the portion, knowing it is off the ""skinnilicous"" menu so it is supposed to be smaller portion but this was beyond small.... 4 tiny pieces of steak and a scoop of mashed and maybe 3 small pieces of asparagus. I was bummed but what ever I didn't have time to get anything else, I was about to start eating when I noticed a piece of plastic in it, looked like a piece of tape, but at least a inch long   I called and asked to speak to a manager, she said to bring it back so they can see it and they'll start a new one right away and throw in a piece of cheesecake.  I get there the to go lady was nice, she says they are making a new one now.... I wait prob 10 mins get back to my store and open it. No tape but seriously gave me the same container of food back. So cool I got back a tiny portion of the food that had a piece of tape in it that someone stuck there fingers in to take out. Not cool."
Willio J.,"Arlington, VA",23,33,,1.0,8/4/2016,"As loyal customer, I have always seek out Cheesecake Factory as I travel. This evening I ordered Jamaican black Pepper Chicken and Shrimp. It took an hour for food to come and when it came the chicken was burn badly. The manager, David, barely apologized and told me if ""I want anything to eat for dinner let him know"". It is 5:30 pm this is my dinner . I guess that was a nice way for him to say tough love but I will do anything for you."
Crystal D.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,5,5,5.0,3/27/2015,One of my favorite places to dine in！White chocolate raspberry truffle is the best ever!
Megan S.,"Chicago, IL",38,278,47,3.0,10/27/2013,I tend to stay away from chain restaurants but after calling other booked restaurants and not wanting a full meal we decided on CCF.  We had a salad and cake at the bar.  Our server/bartender was great...and cute.   I would go back for lunch but I learned my lesson about making reservations early.
Judy R.,"Kansas City, MO",8,159,763,5.0,12/20/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory, located in the Caesar Shops was a wonderful place for lunch .  We had a Factory Nacho Plate and a Fig and Bleu Cheese Flatbread which were both eye-catching and delicious! We were also served a basket of warm, tasty bread with fresh butter. As a bonus we were able to dine outside which allowed us to enjoy the large aquarium and the Roman God animated display which is a well-known part of Caesar's Palace."
Keith S.,"Valencia, CA",2,11,6,3.0,8/2/2016,"It started out really bad.  After checking in with the hostess, we're told about 10 mins wait and was asked to wait behind the counter.  Twenty-five minutes had passed and as we look around everyone that was waiting before us, including those that came after us, were seated except our party. It was then I've decided to come up to the counter where the manager Ahmad where standing and waited patiently for my turn to speak to him (he was talking to the hostess). He never even bothered to ask if I needed anything... he knew I was there and yet he continued to ignore me while he acknowledged this woman who just walked up to him. So, I finally asked  how much longer do we need to wait before we get seated.  Much to our surprise, they couldn't find our ticket.  My wife and I were furious at that point.  Glad we had Alicia as our server.  She asked how our day was and we told her what just happened.  Apparently, she told another manager,Greg, what happened. Greg approached us immediately, he listened and was very apologetic, and offered us an appetizer.  We politely declined but expressed that we were grateful he came and spoke with us.  Overall, what started as a bad experience turned to a very positive one..... Kudos to Alicia who was very attentive and gave us 5 star service."
Dottie M.,"Victorville, CA",60,29,272,4.0,1/31/2015,Great place to rest your feet from shopping and awesome food. Classic burger hit the spot.
Janna L.,"Bakersfield, CA",285,1276,928,4.0,4/18/2013,"Consistently good food and we were not waiting around forever to obtain a table between the lunch and dinner crowd. Still busy mind you! We chose the interior dining area this time and immersed ourselves in the lunch selections. MAN, this place has it all. HUGE menu. How do they do it all so well? For $11.50 I chose a pasta special - spicy chipotle chicken. It was really good although the chicken was quite dry. I wish they would carry a lunch special with shrimp in it! The sauce was just enough and although it claims to be spicy, it is not so to people like me! Our waiter was professional, pleasant and down-to-earth.  Very casual dining here. My biggest complaint was the music playing. Awful, back to the era of Huckleberry Finn."
