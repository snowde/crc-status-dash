Geoff S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",21,96,10,4.0,1/5/2015,"I'm not big on going to chain restaurants when in Vegas when there are so many great restaurants there. However it was getting late and I needed to get dinner at a place where I knew exactly what to what to order. Service was fast, but not too fast. I asked for only the whole wheat bread and they accommodated me. The only downside to the place was that I got no signal at all on my phone. I wasn't the only one with that problem. That's not The Cheesecake Factory's fault, but it would be nice if they installed WiFi in the restaurant."
Lucy M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,10,,5.0,3/16/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory! When we went there last week, we all ordered burgers, which were absolutely delicious. Mine ended up being too big to finish, so Cheesecake Factory is good for those with big appetites. I enjoyed my cheeseburger and left the restaurant stuffed. The French fries were amazing also!!! The wait for the food was longer than I would have liked, but definitely worth the wait. The waiter was also very friendly and sociable."
Luca M.,"Milan, Italy",7,126,,5.0,3/23/2015,"We basically went to the Cheesecake Factory because we are addicted to two things: cheesecake and Big Bang Theory. What a surprise! Not only you get an amazing choice of cheesecakes (and cakes in general) which are just delicious... but also the food is great! I've tried the Smokehouse BBQ Burger twice and I have to admit it was one of the best I've ever had and better than the one I had at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR the day before. Definitely recommended (it's also non-expensive), but remember to show up early (or late) for dinner as the place is always packed!"
Kenneth N.,"Richmond, Canada",2246,6663,9576,4.0,7/17/2014,"Probably the best value resto @ Caesar's lol without breaking an arm and a leg.  Sure it's not dirt cheap, nor should it be for such a higher-end casual chain, but at least you're not paying $50 per entree @ Gordon Ramsay, but I digress. The usual pricing and big portions. Located at the way back from the Forum Shops, and liked what they did with their patio; it's massive enough to soak in all the eye candy that Vegas has to offer at this time of year.  Don't know possibly how one review said it's quiet in here."
Jane K.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,168,202,2.0,5/29/2015,"The food is mediocre. 10 years ago, this place used to be good, but now it's like an Applebee's with higher prices. The reason for even 2 stars is because of the service and the cheesecakes are great! I would only come here to eat a cheesecake. Other than that, the food is 1 star.  Here is my 2 cents. They have like 20 pages of food and it's like reading a damn book, trying to get through the whole menu and trying to figure out what you want. That's like a 10 min ordeal just going through all those pages and by that time, you really worked up an appetite. With such a huge selection, how does the company expect to make good food and perfect a dish? They can't with 100 dishes they have to cook and remember. Id just shoot myself if I was the chef and had to memorize that menu and try to cook it. Condense the menu and make at least one thing right and delicious.  The pasta I got was bland and said light marinara. It was drenched in Mariana and it was suppose to have a lemon and garlic taste. Didn't taste anything but bland tomato sauce. My bf got chicken and biscuits. The chicken was a joke. It looked like thin floppy slices that you get from a container to.make sandwiches. Im not even sure if it was chicken. McDonald's sells better and bigger chicken breasts. Seriously, the chicken looked so flat, it looked like a flat pancake. Very unappealing and unnatural. It's a shame that this place went downhill."
Louise O.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",3,3,,1.0,8/29/2015,Very slow service. Waited on my potatoes and was told they were unavailable after everyone else got their food. I had to wait on my food while my group ate. My replacement mash had a large chicken bone in it and I am vegetarian. It was pretty disgusting. We had to wait 30 mins for our food. The service was slow and very disappointing.
Skillz M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",390,34,243,5.0,9/5/2014,"Went last second on a busy Saturday night , party of 8 and bday for the 15yr old favorite spot . Last second we didn't know what to expect . We were told 2hr wait at 7pm arrival. So we gave name and walked the shops .. 20 min later we get phone call table ready in 5 min .. Wow great job. We immediately head back.. Waiter was great and attentive to all details of are party and age group ordering . Was a great night . Food was on point , appetizers properly timed and drinks were always full. Even had cheesecake to go! Nuts and creme offered . They nailed it in every way. So glad we left name and number and took the chance of them calling early. Great job ! We will be back. Waiter even hooked me up with a nice glass of cold milk!!"
Sophia H.,"San Francisco, CA",640,457,195,4.0,1/14/2013,"Although my boyfriend and I eat at Cheesecake factory often, eating at this location was definitely an out of ordinary experience.Things that went wrong with our meal: first the bread was cold, then one of the dishes went cold while waiting for the other dish to be ready, and finally, I bit into half a toothpick that was accidentally left inside my chicken breast.  Yet despite the many mishaps that happened during our meal, our waiter and the manager provided the best service possible and were very apologetic. They redid both our dishes wonderfully and served as a new basket of bread. We even ended up getting the entire meal for free since the manager felt so bad for all the things that went wrong. 4 stars for the second batch of food and service! We will definitely be coming back during our next trip. :)"
Susanne B.,"Mount Vernon, WA",7,15,1,3.0,7/22/2016,Have been to this Cheesecake factory several times and the food is always AMAZING. Usually it's a quick wait but this last time was very long despite the 30 minute predicted wait. They could really benefit from some sort of paging system. It would be nice to be able to look at shops and while you are waiting for the unpredictable time. Once we got in it took a bit to get waited on but they were clearly understaffed. Still would recommend as their food is so consistently good with generous portions great for sharing.
Crystal Y.,"El Cajon, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/26/2016,"I spend a lot of time in AZ,  Vegas,  & SD. Starting to write my reviews.  This place was by far the best in service.   Food great but for the calories it better be. Well worth it. Our server Tanya was awesome."
Arezo A.,"Simi Valley, CA",51,57,51,1.0,11/22/2015,"Waited 30 minutes for drinks. Food came out cold. The server was not having a good day.....plastic in my sons pasta! Couldn't get an extra chair because of a ""fire hazard"" ok then let your guest stay standing!!!!!!!! I'm not leaving here happy...."
Monica M.,"Santa Paula, CA",65,5,,5.0,8/21/2016,"Always find the food at Cheesecake Factory so yummy! This time I ordered the herb crusted salmon...comes with a nice serving of salmon, asparagus, and mashed potatoes! It was delish! I gotta give props to our waitress Jessica...she totally rocked with her quick service!"
yalda a.,"Dublin, CA",0,23,7,5.0,1/29/2016,"Normally when I go to cheesecake the service is slow, there's a long wait to get seated and the food is okay. Nothing that amazes me. I asked how long it would be to seat 4 people and they seated us right away. Our waitress Joey was attentive and didn't mess up our order which is something I have a problem with when it comes to other cheesecake locations. The food was better than other times. I really enjoyed it."
Tekehia S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",11,12,15,5.0,8/1/2014,"We were originally told there would be a 2 hour wait for our party of 8, however it only took 35 minutes. Nice! Service was good, food tastes great. Cocktail yummy!"
Kent T.,"Palm Springs, CA",335,419,202,3.0,10/1/2014,"When with family, shopping in Caesar's Forum this is the perfect choice! The service excellent! As always in a Cheesecake Factory. Anyone can find something they like on this giant menu! The food rock solid, not amazing, never terrible, but consistently good!"

Laura S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,4.0,1/20/2015,"My friend and I decided to check this branch of the chain out right before I left for the military. There was a slight wait but they got us a table almost immediately which was great!  Our waiter was really sweet and took care of us, definitely a plus in my book. Rude waiters are no fun.  The food was good and came out in relatively good time. Our waiter set us up with some drinks and he checked in with us regularly.  Next time I'm back home I'll definitely be stopping by!"
Tim W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2562,525,595,5.0,8/12/2010,"I have been to this location everytime I'm in Vegas. Always great food and service. The lines can be crazy on the weekends though! One of the cheapest places to eat Vegas IMHO. The portions are so big you can share. If you sit on the patio you'll have a front row seat to the show above the aquarium.  Some of my favorite appetizers are the Roadside Sliders, Southern Fried Chicken Sliders and the Firecracker Salmon.  My favorite specialties are the Ranch House Burger, Steak Diane and the Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club.  My favorite cheesecake is the Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake. It is absolutely amazing!   My favorite drinks are the Tropical Smoothie and the Frozen Iced Mango. They didn't offer a kid's menu in the past but now do. It's for kids 10 and under and includes a drink (choice of a soft drink, milk, apple juice or lemonade)  This is what is offered: Roadside Sliders  Fried Chicken Sliders  Mini Corn Dogs  Pasta with butter & Parmesan cheese  with Marinara sauce  with meat sauce  with Alfredo sauce   Kids Quesadilla  with chicken   Mac & Cheese  Chicken Strips w/ fries  Cheese or Pepperoni Pizza   Grilled Cheese with fries  Grilled Chicken Breast with potatoes and a vegetable   Desserts are:  Ice Cream   Mini Hot Fudge Sundae   Kid's Strawberries Insider Tip: They also offer a complementary baby plate that consists of bananas, oranges and bread."
Yeon Jung K.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,31,5.0,1/19/2014,"Food was delicious, service great, consistent just like All the other cheesecake factory. Sweet brown bread was so good, pasta perfect!  Love their blueberry & white chocolate cheesecake!"
Michelle G.,"Las Vegas, NV",597,116,139,5.0,6/23/2015,I LOVE this location! The service is amazing and everyone is really friendly and helpful. I highly recommend trying the passion martini or Cosmo because both are delicious. The menu is HUGE. This is the type of place where there is something for everyone. Call ahead to get wait times. You can always shop in the forum while waiting.
