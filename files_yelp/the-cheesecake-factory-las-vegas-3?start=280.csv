Jenny D.,"Las Vegas, NV",881,393,2599,4.0,3/30/2013,"Hunnie Bunnie seems to be OBSESSED with the Bow tie pasta in marinara sauce here!! It's date night and she chose Cheesecake Factory. AGAIN. SHOCKER!! I decided to try the one in the Forum Shops since it is a little closer than going to Boca Park.  We actually got seated pretty quickly here. Usually we wait a good thirty minutes at the Boca Park spot. We got a table for two outside of the restaurant so there was some really good people watching.  This is RIGHT outside of the Caesar's show thing they do so it did get a little darker and noisier when the show was happening but it doesn't last TOO long.  Camille had her usual, Bow tie pasta in marina and loved it.  And I ordered my usual: Chicken Chipotle Pasta. I felt like it wasn't as spicy as when I usually get it and it was definitely saucier, watery if you will. It was still delish but I've had it on better days.  I also ordered a Red Sangria and it was delish!  We will definitely be back to this location though!"
Gene K.,"New York, NY",80,167,3,3.0,7/21/2015,"Usually not a fan of franchise food, but I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad with the dressing on the side and it rocked.   The salad must've weighed like 2-3 pounds.  I know defeats the purpose of ordering a salad, but you know what...F U.  I was hungry...haha.  Plus our waitress was super cool as she was originally from Chicago and NYC, and shared city stories,. ..not too crowded and decent prices."
Chad Y.,"Honolulu, HI",1056,1234,446,3.0,7/9/2012,"Why go to the Cheesecake Factory? I mean does it really have something that special on its menu that is worth the trek or the wait for a table? No, it doesn't have the charm and the allure but it does offer a wide ranging menu that is sure to please, decent service, and most off all: consistency.  The menu is overwhelmingly large. Whether you want appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pastas, entrees, or more they will have it. Tacos? Shepherd's Pie? Chicken Milenese? Yes, they have it available on their menu. While it won't be the greatest you ever had, it certainly won't be disappointing and offers decent flavors.  Service was good and like other locations, its saving grace. We were the last party to be seated and they didn't hesitate to be of service nor did they try to rush us. They were attentive and water glasses never went empty. The food arrived in a well timed orchestration and was where the restaurant clearly shined. All in all it was consistent. It stayed true to the Cheesecake Factory experience and didn't disappoint, yet at the same time didn't wow either."
Jemma A.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",0,55,,4.0,5/2/2014,"Top to bottom- very, very good! Food, service and value. Inside the Forum Shops make it doubly as fun! Don't miss it. Although the day I was there the womens bathroom was flooded and I got some gross stuff on my feet...yuck!"
Kaylee Y.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,8,,5.0,5/15/2014,"This is a must see if you're a Canadian. Every time we're in the States, we make it our mission to find a Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is huge and everything I've ever tried is delicious. The portions are also huge and the price is extremely reasonable. Make sure to take a doggy bag because you MUST save room for dessert! Their cheesecake is heavenly! We had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and I've never tasted something so delicious in my life.  The service is also always great here as well and they give you bread before your meal.  What more could you want in a restaurant. My only criticism is that they don't have any locations in Canada. I beg you Cheesecake Factory, please come to Canada!"
Brynda D.,"Yorba Linda, CA",4,14,,3.0,7/8/2015,Very disappointed. In all fairness they were busy. I ordered eggs & bacon with tomatoes. My daughter got ice cream. They brought the ice cream after they served us our meals. I got potatoes and the wrong bread. It took her 15 minutes to get me the tomatoes I ordered. I never got the bread. She even packed extra of the wrong type of bread like I should be grateful. So for 12$ I got 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon. That left me annoyed.
Mickael P.,"Henderson, NV",70,12,3,5.0,11/11/2015,"Been coming here for 2 years, as it is the unofficial hangout for afterwork grubbing. I usually sit and eat at the bar, since tables are a long wait. This location has an amazingly friendly team, so I see why it's crowded a lot. My bartenders Jeremy & Chris are THE BEST. Funny and attentive, did I mention funny. These 2 seem to work well together and seem to enjoy their job. My order has NEVER been wrong. Which seems impossible but they are just that good. Also, your greeter (he wears bowties) is a sweetheart, he remembers me every time. Great Job hiring Great People. Thank You, I am a loyal fan!! #CheesecakeFactory"
Toby C.,"Henderson, NV",82,11,,1.0,1/29/2016,"After being told the wait was on 10 minutes just 15 minutes had passed so I walked up to the hostess counter and was placed into another area.I suppose the wait was ten minutes to be placed into this area rather than to be seated, after waiting an additional 20 minutes we were seated near the kitchen area with a large column aside our 2 person table.When we asked to be seated we were told it wasn't possible,we ended up walking out because it was so loud where we sat due to the kitchen being so close.On our way out we saw 3 other two person seating areas and our waitress.This happen about a month ago but it sucked so bad I wanted to make sure to post about it, so yea if you don't have time to burn and you enjoy being able to hear who you are dining with while you enjoy your meal, this may not be the place for you."
Elane F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",7,114,71,4.0,8/15/2015,"I really think the cheesecake factory here at the Cesear palace location is much better than the one in Boca Park, Summerlin.  The food is seasoned better and the portion seems bigger too. Will be coming here from now on, even if it is a longer wait."
Hugo L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",802,32,9,4.0,4/8/2015,"This location offers a great atmosphere to dine in. Their food selection is great and the ingredients are always fresh. The staff is very friendly and you can tell they are under great management, as the operation runs very smoothly."
Jenn T.,"Redlands, CA",899,939,162,3.0,3/8/2014,Came here for a quick bite to eat before a show.  We got seated fairly quickly as there wasnt much of a wait.  The menu has changed a lot since I've last eaten at this chain.  I went for a chicken dish which was breaded chicken with pasta topped with tomato sauce.  It was pretty tasty but as usual the portion was huge!  The fettuccine alfredo was also pretty good as well.  The service here was good and polite!
Karina R.,"Bellflower, CA",1,17,,5.0,11/27/2015,Had to tip my chef Mr. Robles for cooking my delicious meal because without the cooks this restaurant would not survive. Most definitely a great place to have dinner and enjoy the nice atmosphere. Spent about $86.00 on a meal for two with dessert and boy was the pumpkin pecan cheesecake also yummy.
Kat in the House s.,"Durham, NC",0,135,3,4.0,8/30/2014,"And who doesn't need a trip through the Shoppes at the Forum and an excuse to perhaps catch the statue show? While I don't get the allure of eating a meal at this chain, I will wait in line for a slice of cheesecake.  I hadn't visited one in a long time so this may be old news but there seemed some new additions to the menu of slice choices. I chose Craig's Crazy Carrot cake... The clerk threw in two forks- as if I was going to share- not this gal. Fantastic!"
Leteecia H.,"Tempe, AZ",73,17,71,1.0,1/29/2014,"So tonight was CONFUSING. I walked in, gave my name, waited by the bakery. My name was called. I was told to walk upstairs. I waited AGAIN upstairs. And then asked to sit in an overcrowded, stuffy, overflow room.  And get this, the table was a small 2 top right outside of the kitchen. Literally, 3 steps out of the kitchen. Lord forbid a waiter trip or a cup of coffee slip off of a tray, scolded wouldn't even be the word. Myself and my guest I was with, just left.   As we walked down the grand staircase, we walked past a manager that didn't even take the time to say goodbye or ask about the meal. The gentleman that directed us upstairs didn't even take the time to ask why we were leaving so soon, but instead ""I hope you enjoyed your meal!"" Bro, we weren't even here for more than 10 minutes. Ultimately, I get that this location in Vegas is busy, but why is that? Cheesecake factory is a staple in every major city, patrons will eat there no matter what city they are traveling to.  But what i don't get is how the customer service can waiver between the different locations.  Just because the Vegas location stays packed from open to close, shouldn't mean that the hostess cannot take an extra moment while asking a name, ""just to let you know, we are seating in the upstairs overflow room, is that okay? Or would you prefer to wait for a table on the first floor?""  This one question would have given me a 5 star experience because I would have elected to walk up approximately 42 stairs and sit in a separated environment."
J H.,"Burnaby, Canada",1,51,45,4.0,11/12/2015,"My husband and I had a late dinner. We ordered the Chicken Bellagio and Chopped salad. The Chicken Bellagio was delicious! The chicken was tender and crispy at the same time and the pesto pasta was perfect! The bread arrived warm and soft with a crispy crust. The service was great and our drinks were topped without any prompting. The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the chopped salad was a tad over dressed. Also, we've been to the Cheesecake factory several times and it's not consistently 5 stars."
Péter K.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,5,2,2.0,10/6/2015,"After a 50 mins wait time we got a ridiculously small table for our group of five. The Lady who escorted us to the table was straight-forwardly arrogant forcing us to make a choice either to take the table or wait for more (ironic smile)... Amanda, our server saved the whole impression, she did great, but I'll never return here nor recommend anyone to come. This is truly a Factory - and guests are treated like products..."
Kim M.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,4,,5.0,12/16/2015,The farfelle chicken with roasted garlic was so good. I want to go back already! Cheesecake factory's food and service is so much better than the grand luxe cafe!
Lawrence C.,"Las Vegas, NV",178,263,12,3.0,1/26/2014,"Standard CCF operation with super over whelming menu.  I get a huge headache after looking at everything.  Do i want one of their 20 salads, 20 burgers, 20 sandwiches, 50 apps?  You get the point.  There are hundreds of items on the menu. I guess it's a ""safe"" option to take someone b/c you can find something for everyone.  The service was pretty slow on a Thurs late night.  Overall this location is what you would expect from Cheesecake.  The desserts are obv awesome and I like the firecracker salmon app."
Philip J.,"Eastside, Las Vegas, NV",6,12,,2.0,8/31/2014,"I got the Asian style lettuce wrap, and I felt it was well prepared. When I didn't like was the lack of customer service. The fact that I had to wave down a bus person twice just to get his attention. Then it seemed to take him another long period of time just to bring the glass of water I asked for him to refill. This was after spending my whole meal without water because it was not refilled.... I only complain about this because I worked as a bus person and I base my standards on the service I would provide. Overall rating would be: food - satisfactory customer service - unsatisfactory."
Mona S.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,5,4.0,9/8/2015,"Very good service here. Our server was Matthew and he was very attentive. He even swapped out my margarita for the lemon drop martini at no charge when I told him I thought the margarita had a funny aftertaste. The hubs and I were celebrating my birthday and the staff all sang ""Happy Birthday"" and made me feel special. We both enjoyed our lunch very much. Try the 'Evelyn's Favorite' pasta - it's vegetarian and extremely tasty."
