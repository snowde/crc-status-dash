Jeff L.,"San Diego, CA",158,219,69,3.0,7/5/2012,"I mean, what can you say about The Cheesecake Factory?  The best part about going into a Cheesecake is that you know what you're going to get.  Everything's the same - the decor, the menu, etc.  Fortunately, there are so many things on the menu you would have to go there 50 times before you tried everything.   This one is inside the Mall at Caesar's.  Great location.  Friendly staff.  I got the BBQ burger.  It was really good.   Weirdest point of the evening though - I'm trying to remember if all the Cheesecakes are this way, but whatever I can't.  The floor was covered in grease.  Seriously - I was sliding around the joint.  I'm like - what is this Ice Capades?  Cheesecake Factory is the only place in Vegas where you can pirouette while deep throating a burger.  Nothing like a little entertainment with your meal, right?   My advice is for the ladies to hold off on the heels while dining here, otherwise it's a solid meal."
Christina S.,"Las Vegas, NV",270,100,138,3.0,12/14/2013,"I'll start with the customer service, unfortunately this is what makes it 3 stars.  We had a big group of around 15 people, and yes, they do not take reservations but we did call to let them know about when a 15 people group would be there. Long story short, there was no table for us when we got there, which is fine, but the hostess was so rude and said it will be an hour and forty five min., she said there was only one table that would fit that many people, we asked if they could push a few tables outside together and she said no. My coworker got a little upset and asked to talk o the manager, come to find out the wait was not going to be even close to that long and they would push two tables together for us.  So the 1 and 45 min wait time suddenly was only 15 min!!! Our waitress was great, very sweet and nice.  We came here as a part of our company Christmas party and we work in a restaurant so we sometimes can be hard to make happy, especially our servers lol but she did great and there were no complaints!!! Food. was. soooooooo. good !!!!!!!!!!!!! omg!!! everyone ate everything off their plates!!!  Fast hot fresh food, great portion sizes and fair prices!!! I will def go back!!!"
Chris R.,"Bellingham, WA",0,57,18,4.0,3/27/2014,"Busy location but the surroundings are interesting enough to keep you busy while you wait for a table. Aquarium in the Caesar's Forum shopping centre is a good place to sit. The wait for lunch was only 10 minutes and the service was friendly and quite helpful, with advice offered on customizing our orders - the advice turned out to be well worth it.  Our meals were served in a timely manner and they were delicious.  A very good Cheesecake Factory location that is worth visiting just for the surroundings. The standard Cheesecake Factory decor really blends well with the Roman setting of Caesar's Palace. I know its a chain, but it is a good one with a great variety of tasty meals that allows you to satisfy everyone in your party with individual choices."
Bruno D.,"Kortrijk, Belgium",0,24,,5.0,11/9/2014,"I've visited a few Cheesecake Factory's in USA, and I've never been disappointed.  They have the largest menu I've ever seen, and all dishes have good quality.  And I love their original Cheesecake!!!"
Cathia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,220,20,4.0,5/3/2014,"I've always been hoping to come here but the nearest Cheesecake Factory is pretty far from me, so you can image my delight that I found one while on vacation in Las Vegas. I glad to say I was not disappointed. The drinks are delicious and the dessert was perfect and what can I say about the meal itself,,, it was just what I was hoping for and more. I look forward to being able to visit again."
Yaniv Z.,"Concord, CA",0,26,,1.0,7/1/2015,I'm always buy at least once a week from Cheesecake Factory and David the manger at this location was very rude almost look like he have a problem with Foreigners was disrespectful and very condescending didn't even try to help after they did a mistake with my order if that the service Cheesecake Factory the starting to bring I can see them losing a lot of customers and a lot of complaints to the BBB it look like this guy is trying to get this place to get a bad name!!!!!!!
Mailnet R.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",0,48,27,4.0,10/27/2014,Food Great! Location nice but hard to get to... Parking - far away... No reservation possible - Very unfortunate !!!! Atmosphere 8/10 Service 8/10 All and All - recommended !
Trojan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,153,6,4.0,1/3/2014,"I think this location is one of their finest!  My wife and I went to dinner in the Christmas eve when we were in Vegas. The service was truly great. The atmosphere was fabulous.  I liked their interior design ... It looked little bit different from many Cheesecake Factory's locations. We ordered:  Caesar Salad: Good ... I have to say not like the ones in LA, but was good really.  Fried Shrimp platter: Mediocre in my opinion. I was expecting something much better than what it came that night to me!  Chicken Cajun: Much better than the Shrimp's, but also less than the expectations.  In all with the service and the design, it deserve 4 stars without hesitation."
Jessica J.,"Centennial, CO",227,1110,857,3.0,3/7/2010,"While wandering the Forum Shops my hubby and I worked up an appetite and wanted something easy and quick, but also want to sit down and park ourselves for a bit.  We saw Cheesecake Factory and that seemed to fit the bill! The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain and so  you probably either love it or hate it.  In my opinion, the cheesecake is top notch!  Their cheesecakes are rich and served in huge slices that will satisfy any sweet tooth.  However, since I was jonesing for a Fro Ho at Serendipity later, I skipped it this trip.  As for the food, well, it is what it is.  The menu is HUGE (if you haven't been there it is a spiral bound book!).  That is great for variety, but other than the cheesecake they haven't perfected anything.   This time out I had the Brioche Breakfast Sandwich with Hashbrowns.  It was good, not great.  They put tomatoes on the sandwich before they heat it so they get mushy.  Bleck!  The bread is good and the flavors work.   We had good service and they sat us on the second floor which was nice since it cut down on the noise.   Good lunch, nice easy stop in the Forum Shops."
Kimmy N.,"Saint Louis, MO",55,386,1522,4.0,4/15/2015,"i love that this location has 'outside' seating...as in outside of the mall (not outdoors). so you're able to see the atlantis show that is being put on. the downfall is that it can be super crowded and very loud. food was just as good as if i was at my regular cheesecake factory. this location seemed a little small, but if could of just been me since we were siting on the 'outside'."
Yosi Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,23,2,4.0,7/15/2014,"The food was great, the service was excellent, the place was clean, and i really enjoyed the fresh ambiance. The only problem was they didn't  pre bus my table."
Jah Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,9,28,4.0,7/12/2014,"Favorite restaurant in Vegas! Food was amazing!!! Loved their angel hair pesto like pasta with chicken. So good! Loved their bread basket esp the rye, really fresh! Just disappointed to one of our visits as our waitress never served them. Their shrimp and fries, chicken strips with corn on the side were good! Portion sizes were huge!  Can't beat their desserts! Red velvet and carrot cheesecake were fantastic! Really recommend these 2 flavors."
Adrian S.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,11,,4.0,9/22/2015,"This place is fantastic and has a relaxed and casual atmosphere. Everything on the menu tastes great and they even have a healthy menu although overall this place isn't the healthiest if you're watching your calories. Mostly comfort food but it's delicious. I want to add that the service here is awesome! I went here 4 or 5 times now and every time the service has been phenomenal. The staff is super friendly and genuine. They are also very receptive and come around very quickly to make sure you are taken care of. The only reason I'm taking off a star is because the cutlery was always just placed on the bare table which isn't the most sanitary thing. I would have preferred rolled up cutlery or at least placed on top of a napkin. Aside from that it's a great place to eat while staying in Vegas. Oh, one last thing. If you sit on the entrance side be prepared to listen to the zeus monologue or whatever it is in the mall area lol. It gets loud and you can actually feel the heat coming from the flames that accompany this presentation."
Kathleen T.,"Fullerton, CA",342,363,115,5.0,8/16/2013,"Never did I actually think going to The Cheesecake Factory would be one of my highlights of my Vegas trip recently for a convention. Not only did we have one of our better nights here, but we actually spent about 4 hours sitting at the bar. No lie. That was our second night in a row there.  Our first night, we came for dinner and didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a table. We quickly snagged a corner seat at the bar and were helped by Jeremy (The guy that looks like ""the guy from Jarhead"" aka Jake Gyllenhaal). We both ordered the fish tacos, but Jeremy suggested the plate was big and we could probably split it, which we ended up doing and didn't regret it because it was a LOT. The only gripe I would have is that the rice was strange. I have no idea what was in it, but it was strange. He was quick and attentive-- perfect dinner service!  The next night, we opted going straight to the bar again, and were helped by Jose & William. William, hands down, knows which dishes are worth getting and will steer you away from something you may regret ordering later. HANDS DOWN this guy's got the menu memorized. I even was able to test his knowledge about what was in certain dishes, and he was able to answer without hesitation; and if anyone's ever been in the Cheesecake Factory, you know their menus are 80-page books. He was able to suggest the Miso Salmon & the Veggie Salad, both of which we ordered and were NOT disappointed (seriously, order these items). He can also make a mean ""Jolly Rancher"" shot! Jose was one of my favorite bartenders... basically ever. This guy's been bartending for 8 years, and you can really tell. He has an awesome attitude, a great smile, and is efficient as heck (he also bartends events, so if you're ever looking to find someone to do your event, he's your man!) He can make great conversation, tell some insane stories, but will still finish the hundreds of drink orders that are coming in. I feel like after the 4 hours we spent sitting at the bar, we made some great Cheesecake Factory friends. I wish this particular CF were local, but alas, anything in Vegas stays in Vegas, and I guess that goes for the bartenders/service we've had here.  Until we decide to have many more glasses of wine at the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops; cheers!"
Kelly C.,"San Diego, CA",347,299,712,5.0,8/10/2013,"Great experience here tonight! Located in Forum Shops in Caesars Palace, this place seemed a bit quiet compared to the CF at home in San Diego.  We ordered all appetizers: Avocado Eggs Rolls (my favorite--always amazing), Tex-Mex Egg Rolls, roasted artichoke, fried chicken sliders and a  combo of fried avocado, zucchini & portobello mushrooms. Great service from Scott. Food was awesome & we had great cocktails too."
Myirie M.,"Houston, TX",0,10,14,5.0,10/3/2015,Wonderful and large plates means a take out bag every time. Lots of variety to please. Cheesecakes that go on for days! Always satisfied with this chain.
Catherine H.,"Ogden, UT",0,57,3,4.0,7/24/2015,"Our waiter was great. The food was mostly good, the turkey in my sandwich was extremely dry, but the salad and our avocado rolls were wonderful."
Amy K.,"Las Vegas, NV",163,12,4,5.0,9/27/2015,The food and atmosphere is the best. Of course the cheesecake is the best and the nachos are delicious.
Dani M.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",6,16,11,4.0,10/7/2013,"Love the place!! This exactly whats needed after a long day exploring the strip & shopping.  Staff are super friendly & overall the place is aesthetically pleasing. Usually pretty busy so you may end up waiting a while but the foods worth it.  Got some buffalo chicken strips & guh... Big portions, yet so damned tasty ... & I still don't like celery regardless of what its dipped in.  Refreshing smoothies to boot with care taken in regards to allergies.  Tried the vanilla bean cheesecake, it was lovely & light. I'm gutted we didn't get to try all of the cakes the bakery looked amazing!!!!!  Reasonably priced as well & overall pleasant experience, so I have no complaints asides from potentially long waits."
Danielle S.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",103,21,13,5.0,6/10/2015,"You can never go wrong with this chain!  I have never had a bad meal.  I love the chicken and biscuits,  as well as a grilled chicken dish with asparagus and mushrooms.  The red velvet cheesecake is my all time favorite.  Be prepared to wait, even with a reservation."
