Mike M.,"Belmont, CA",111,451,909,5.0,11/18/2011,"All I can say is these guys make the BEST low carb cheesecake ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I visited the Cheesecake Factory (for desserts only) on my trip to Vegas during Halloween and my girlfriend told me they had a sugar free cheesecake, which peeked my interest.  So, I ended up buying two and was hooked.  I've had several others, but none compare to the Cheesecake Factory.  This stuff is to die for, lol...  I've already been back several times in my own home town.  I'm sure the regular cheesecake is just as good if not better, but for anyone on a low carb diet or diabetic, their cheesecake is out of this world!!!!"
Kimberly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,15,11,4.0,1/15/2014,I came here with a friend and decided to sit at the booth. Jeremy served us from the bar & made the experience. My friend and I both ordered the grilled fish tacos. The server suggested we share the plate considering there were 4 large tacos. The suggestion was spot on! The tacos were delicious and the perfect portion size.  A glass of chianti and the fish tacos from this place won't disappoint!
Addy R.,"Park City, UT",1,36,23,5.0,8/9/2015,The food is excellent. The taste is wonderful.  We love the chicken crusted Romano with Caesar salad. And dessert lemon cheesecake.. Good customer's service.
Bethy H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,33,2,4.0,5/24/2015,"Always really busy so we waited about 15 minutes. Food was good, service was good, pineapple Mojito was really good. The only drawback is the noise level. It's SO LOUD. You can't even have a conversation without raising your voice."
Kevin H.,"Long Beach, CA",76,260,193,5.0,4/25/2015,Cool place to eat! Usually when i'm at caesars palace i always stop by here for dinner with friends! Prices are reasonable which i like and bartenders are friendly. Sometimes there is a LONG wait so get there early on a friday or saturday night
Owen P.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,23,9,5.0,5/17/2015,"Love this place. Every time I'm in a town that has one I've got to go. Cause the service and the food are always awesome. Even though located in the Forum Shops in Ceasars Palace, my wife and I were able to get a table without waiting at 6pm."
Erica D.,"Oceanside, CA",0,29,6,5.0,3/11/2016,"A friend and I decided to have dinner here for our last night in Vegas and thank God we did because it was excellent from start to finish! We waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated, now there was only two of us but still it was nice not having to wait that long. Once we got our seats our waiter  came over and right away suggested some drinks since we were looking at the adult beverages (of course, hello we're in Vegas!) he told us the new blood orange margarita was great so we both went with that. SO good!!! I wish I would've gotten my waiters name because he was awesome! I ordered the combo of the steak Diana with salmon and it was delicious. The salmon didn't have the least bit of that fishy taste that most salmon has, the steak was perfect and the mashed potatoes were great too! Of course we got cheesecake as well, I got the s'mores and my friend got red velvet. One great thing after another with this place! I will say that when you're going to a Cheesecake Factory make sure you at least have an idea of what you'd like to eat because they have a huge selection on their menu so I don't think you wanna take the time and read each item with description on there."
Nicolette H.,"Las Vegas, NV",356,184,46,4.0,4/20/2013,"Any place that has ""cheesecake"" in it's name is a gold sticker in my book. But really, this place is awesome. Of all the multiple times I've been here, there have only been a few times where the wait is kinda long, and it will be for you too, especially if you're there during the early evenings or/and the weekends. Me and my friends typically make our way to this place around 9 or so, about an hour before it closes and the place is usually not that crowded, or winding down. We seem to typically get our food faster this way. But screw the food, we all know I come here for the cheesecake. I've had the red velvet, the chocolate godiva, the tiramisu, and jacked some banana creme from my friends plate. No not in one sitting you asshole, over multiple visits! I've never had any complaints. It's so delicious that even if I'm too full after a meal, I'll still take cheesecake to go. Chocolate Godiva cheesecake is the cheesecake of gods and it descended from the heavens into this restaurant and if you don't eat it, you're wrong. Forshame! The food can be hit or miss. Typically their Asian cuisine is pretty spot on. It may not be authentic, but it sure is tasty. I think the only bad thing I've ever really had here is the chicken and biscuits. It's like, swimming in gravy, and I hate soup. Their veggie burger is kinda sad too, just fell apart in my hands. Steak is definitely the way to go. The alcoholic drinks are good game too. While a bit pricey, I can slurp down 4 of those orangy-fruity things before the meal gets there."
Michael P.,"Rogers, AR",11,4,1,1.0,7/14/2015,Stopped here while at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  The service is very slow at this location and burger was delivered undercooked after giving specific instructions to my server for well done preparation. I hope more staff will be hired and trained to become better communicators so future patrons will not have a poor experience.
Sheena R.,"Riverton, UT",3,13,3,5.0,7/11/2014,This place is by far my favorite !!!! I ordered the fried Mac n cheese and onion rings !! I was so full I didn't have room for cheese cake :( the staff was fast and friendly and the place was very clean and inviting!
Meagan R.,"Durand, MI",0,28,,3.0,7/5/2015,"Surprisingly there was no wait and we got sat right away. The service was a little slow but it was also really busy. Our bread came out right before we got our food. I always get chicken farfalle because it's my favorite. Maybe it was because it was really busy but the sauce was super runny to the point it was almost soup. The noodles seemed a little hard as if they weren't cooked long enough. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best experience I've had at Cheesecake Factory"
Denise V.,"Las Vegas, NV",125,104,20,4.0,3/8/2015,They don't take reservations per James but he said for a party of two it would not be more than a 10 min wait. Ok we will see. Great service and great food
Melena R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,5.0,3/18/2016,The chicken samosas were bomb. The bread is dangerous because it's so good. Great place for drinks and hanging out with friends.
Skj T.,"El Segundo, CA",22,517,32,5.0,3/4/2015,Service is amazing here! It's actually bigger than it looks from the outside which is nice because we didn't have a wait time to be seated . Love the dishes here. Fresh and top quality .
Katherine M.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,233,532,3.0,4/28/2013,"I usually try to avoid going to the Strip as much as I can when visiting, because I hated being around the strip when I lived there, and I sure do not love it even now. However, my friends insisted on going to the Cheesecake Factory for brunch, and I haven't actually eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before (except that one time I tried their cheesecakes, which were pretty good), so sure, why not. Located inside the Forum Shops at the Caesars Palace, this is definitely a touristy place. It's huge with lots of seating and it's located right in front of that aquarium thing with the show every hour or so. Actually, we chose to seat outside, and one of those shows started playing, which could be a bit annoying since they dim all the lights and it's really loud.  Anyway, back to the food. I got the French toast. Overall, it wasn't bad. It was cooked well and the inside was nice and custardy. It wasn't too sweet either, which I really don't like on my French toasts, so that was a good thing! It was ok, didn't blow me away, but wasn't disappointing either. The service was great. Our server was patient with us and regularly refilled our drinks. He even informed me that my food was going to take a while to be served, since the first batch got burnt. I definitely appreciated him letting me know that.  Overall, food was decent and priced not outrageously. Service was nice! It's definitely one of those touristy places though. So if you're visiting, this would be a great place to dine. However, if you don't like touristy places, or just don't like being at the Strip, then you might want to consider someplace else."
Rich T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,1,2.0,6/25/2015,"Cheese cake factory is way over rated the spinach appetizer was very bland wasn't even salted, $8.50 for a little glass of wine also had the factory burger which was nothing but ground beef and sautéed onions on a Italian club roll that tasted like old bread that was warmed up in a microwave by the time I get down to my last couple of bites I could barely bite into the bread it was so hard The french fries were not fresh either they dried up real quick, my sisters chicken club sandwich was just okay. So appetizer one factory burger/ fries one chicken club sandwich/fries one glass of wine two glasses of iced tea and one slice of  Lemon meringue pie which I might add was very very good $72 with tip included overrated and expensive. To be fair this review does not pertain to the cheesecake factory location on Las Vegas Blvd., South, I was reviewing the cheesecake factory in Green Valley In Henderson I just could not find it in the database"
Garth R.,"Irvine, CA",16,111,61,4.0,1/18/2015,"Never been b4 but I'm going back for sure.  Great prices even in Lost Wages, I mean Las Vegas.  4 ate dinner with desert and one cocktail and it was 80 bucks and change.  The menu selection is outta control.  Too much to choose from IMO.  Service was very good and the cob I had was one of the better I've experienced. The fresh lemonade was excellent with a sugar rim and the lemon drop good sized and very tasty too."
Tina W.,"Flushing, NY",621,155,411,1.0,2/2/2013,"**Warning** Do not order the cooked food here except for burgers and pizzas. It is not edible!! I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, a shrimp scampi and their potato soup. Words cannot describe how awful they all were.... I sent back both of these entrees in exchange for a turkey sandwich  for lunch. I gave them two chances but I had to send back my food twice. The Cheesecake factory in Riverside, NJ is waaaaaay better!"
Ivan D.,"Groton, MA",7,28,4,4.0,3/28/2016,"If you have been to one of their franchises you know what to expect. The service was good, the salads big and tasty, dessert was very nice."
Kim W.,"Biloxi, MS",24,119,153,3.0,1/5/2014,Service here isn't bad. The food is pretty decent. We decided done here bcz we couldn't make up or minds. This is what we finally agreed on. It's late. We're all hungry. The food here is generally consistent. We dine here bcz it's a familiar restaurant chain.  Don't ask me for a particular dish. I always order different.
