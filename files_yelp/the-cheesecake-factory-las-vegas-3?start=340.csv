Shelley S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,10,9,1.0,8/21/2015,"This restaurant ruined my daughters reception dinner! We called ahead and were assured by management they would accommodate the party of 20 on Friday August 7th. Knowing this is a busy place during this time we wanted to be sure there wouldn't be a two hour wait. We get there and of course it was OVER 2 hours late and to make matters THE WORST they wouldn't seat us all together. We had to split the party in 3 different areas. I wasn't able to sit and enjoy dinner with my daughter on one of the biggest days of my life. The icing on the cake? There were 2 empty tables in her section that were never used. When my daughter inquiried to mgt he said the party for those tables never showed. REALLY?! Management ended up comping her ticket,  however I was made to pay for the overpriced food at my table with 5 of her guests, where I sat and cried and couldn't even eat. My heart is still broken that I will never recapture that special time with my only child. I hope corporate notices this review so others in our situation aren't promised something they can't fulfill."
Rachel S.,"Las Vegas, NV",346,954,2418,3.0,6/16/2011,"The $12 ahi carpaccio is delicious. No for real, order two plates. It's that good. That said, this place is so ridiculously packed all the time. Huge waits just to get a table - you're better off going off of the Strip, plus you won't have to pay for the entertainment tax on your bill.  The place is NOISY (as are all Cheesecake Factories) so sit up top if you can. The service is decent, but that's to be expected."
Wallace C.,"Las Vegas, NV",128,88,5,5.0,9/13/2014,"Five stars for this place, weighs more than my other five-star reviews. It's inside a specific casino that I avoid like the plague, so for me to eat there, means that it's a nice place. The menu is like a phone book, like all Cheesecake Factories, but that never intimidates me. The atmosphere is very nice and laid back, which is refreshing. The place is actually located at the very end of the Forum Shops, so it's the furthest distance from the casino floor, which is good all around. The service is great. I've never gone there with a party of less than 8 people, and my water glass has never been empty for more than a couple of minutes. The food is very good, and its presentation is terrific. But, the real surprise is the price. Very reasonable for any Strip restaurant, let alone one that's inside a big name casino.  I only wish that they had a back door so that I wouldn't have to walk through the casino."
Andrea P.,"San Diego, CA",49,13,2,5.0,3/2/2015,"John was amazing. New menu items were on point. Hands down one of the best guest experiences I've ever had. Give john allison a raise. We felt like family. Thx John, hope to see you soon."
Winnie S.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",15,50,80,5.0,12/29/2014,My go to dish would be the shrimp scampi with angel hair. You can never go wrong with that dish. My date went with the combination of the salmon dish with steak perfect for if you can't decide and want both. Proportion at and it comes with mashed potatoes. It stayed busy from when we walked in and even became busier when we were leaving.
Frances A.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,113,2,2.0,1/13/2013,"Considering earlier positive experiences, I was gravely disappointed.  First off, you claim you have a full bar, yet you couldn't make a blood and sand. Then when I asked the waitress for a sazarac, she replied that she had no idea what that was before even consulting with the bar. When she did talk to them, they had o idea what it was either. Come onnnnn, thats America's first cocktail. Standard drink. I'm female and fresh out if college, and even I know what it is. A good bartender would've looked it up on their phone or have had a cocktail book stored at their register. After the huge ordeal, I succumbed to the firefly martini... It had tequila so I was good... For the time being... My mom had specifically ordered a medium burger. Not only was her burger late coming to the table, it was also a brick. When we told the waitress, she looked so annoyed with us, grabbed the burger plus my mom's fries, without asking. The very insincere manager came over to tell us he took it off the bill, and offered to grab us something else. Anywhere else would've comped the burger and whatever else we ordered for her wait. My fish and chips were decent...  Not mind blowing.  Extreme oreo cheesecake was far too sweet. Considering all the mishaps and the fact it was my mom's birthday, we would've appreciated a comp'ed cheesecake... But I guess the big bad corporate cheesecake factor is far too big for some good old fashioned service... Or at the very least, a happy birthday."
Banu S.,"San Diego, CA",563,455,870,4.0,4/23/2011,"I always have a good time here. Our service was amazing, she accomodated our requests for something gluten free, and went out of her way to talk to the chef. The food is delish, the portions too big (don't eat all of it, you'll fatten up). Great location at the Forum Shops. I know in Vegas, I should have done a fancier foodie place, but needed food fast."
Michelle M.,"Irvine, CA",1220,350,2397,3.0,1/3/2011,"Ahhhh...YES! A restaurant inside a casino that is actually open PAST 11 pm!!   Our group got seriously sidetracked after some gambling and realized that our afternoon of gambling turned into an EVENING of gambling.  We found our way to Caesar's Palace and we were so surprised that almost all the restaurants were closed!! Thank goodness we found Cheesecake Factory at the very end of the forum shops.  We were seated immediately!  That was good news for my tired feet. I ordered the bacon, cheese, mushroom and spinach omelet.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best that I've had either. Service was good all the way up until the end.  We sort of lost our waiter when it came time to pay.  Where did he go?  So we just ended up having to pay cash. If you don't want to go off the strip to search for a late night dinner spot and you are not craving fast food, Cheesecake Factory inside Caesar's Palace is your best bet!"
Ron A.,"Whittier, CA",105,711,214,3.0,8/13/2013,"Very nice location. Two-floors. Came here with a very large group of about 30 people without prior notice. The waiters split us into three smaller groups which we did not mind. Two groups were next to each other. The other group was across a walkway. We were fortunate to get the waiter who was probably new. He seemed to be a little panicked while the other waiter looked like he knew what he was doing. As for the group I was in, we had to wait a long time between ordering our drinks then ordering our food. This cause us to be the last finishing our food while the other group was ready to head out the door. Other than the service, the food was as expected...Good! I give the food four out of five stars. Service was a two out of five."
Lindsay B.,"Elgin, IL",86,508,23,3.0,8/1/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory location was very busy with a long wait- though our table was ready when they said it would be. The dulce de leche Cheesecake was 5 stars for sure- everything else from service to food was good, not great. We definitely had enough leftovers for another full meal, which made the price right."
Viet-Anh H.,"London, United Kingdom",11,192,86,5.0,12/2/2011,"Ordered take-out; A portion of nachos, the seared tuna sashimi salad, and a slice of lemon and raspberry cheescake (after much deliberation). Too many nachos for two people to get through, but the seared sashimi salad got eaten with ease. The cheesecake as expected was divine. Completely refreshed the palate."
Ninja h.,"New York, NY",0,228,250,2.0,12/1/2015,"The hostess was so delightful. She limped over to show me my table. Apparently she hit the gym too hard but managed to laugh about it. I was seated and handed a book of a menu. They have an menu with around 200 choices.  This is good and bad. This could have been the reason for the confusion with my order. I ordered Parmesan herb crusted chicken but received a different dish. I ended up with a Parisian chicken with spaghetti.  I even told my waiter I thought my order was wrong since I was expecting different sides but he said it was correct that it was came with pasta. I started to eat my entree but asked for a menu. I looked up my entree and I was correct.  Even though I pointed it out to him pointed, he did nothing about it but said sorry for the confusion.  I wasn't in the mood for spaghetti or waiting for another entree to be prepared.  I felt this place was like a fancy dinner that offers too many choices at inflated diner prices. It specializes in cheese cakes but I figured if I ordered one I would end up with pudding. Haha. It's not a bad place to eat but you can find better along the strip."
Jessica R.,"Beaumont, CA",1097,45,114,5.0,11/25/2013,Never disappointed here... We had the avocado egg rolls and a cheese pizza... The cheese pizza was okay but the egg rolls were magnificent!
Chad G.,"Toronto, Canada",1,16,,1.0,4/13/2015,"Sad to write this.  Was there last week and sat at the bar.  The service was excellent the bartender was on it! Even though they were super busy she was awesome.  My problem was with the aftermath.  I had the jambalaya which I always have.  We look for cheesecake factories so I can eat it. While eating the chicken and shrimp both tasted a little bit ""off"" I thought maybe it was the cajun seasoning (this one was more seasoned than the usual ones) well it wasn't I was up all night puking not the best way to spend our last night in Vegas."
Edward T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,5.0,3/30/2015,"My favorite since forever. Has never disappointed. Portions feed an army. Sit outside and view all the tourists of Las Vegas that venture into the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace.  People watching Locale. Of course, save room for dessert."
Sandy Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,21,3,5.0,3/30/2015,"There was line, but it moved fast!!  The the server was very attentive and the good and drinks were quick and delicious!!  We went on a Friday night and in Vegas normally takes forever at almost any restaurant, but not here!! Great service totally!!"
rose r.,"Fremont, CA",6,53,4,5.0,1/29/2016,Went in for a late night snack w/ the sisters.  We were seated right away.  Our server was very nice and helpful.  One thing I really appreciated was our glasses were filled the entire time we were there.  Highly recommended and will be back whenever I'm around
Cameron S.,"Las Vegas, NV",118,244,5,5.0,4/16/2013,"Before coming to Cheesecake Factory, I HATED cheesecake, but so many of their options (I think there is about 50 of them) are so knock-out good that it doesn't feel like you're eating a typical cheesecake. One of the biggest pluses about this place is the selection, they have so much on their menu across all types of cuisine that it's literally in a spiral bound notebook.  I kept getting a four cheese pasta until I asked the waiter for other suggestions and since then, I have still never been disappointed with the food. I don't come here as often as I like since the locations are far away and the wait is normally long, but it is well worth all of that for the food!"
Matan P.,"West Hollywood, CA",76,8,1,3.0,3/4/2013,"went here two days in a row with my friends while spending the weekend in Vegas, sort of got dragged along the 2nd time.  Honestly, their food is decent, but too plain in my opinion, I wasn't wowed by anything.   The first time I had the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, which was tasty, but again, nothing crazy.  Second time I had pasta with meat sauce, maybe my fault fault for not ordering something more exotic, but again nothing I couldn'tve made at home.  The meals are at least affordable.  And while their HUUUGE portions could be a plus for some people, I really think they should scale them down a bit.  Seriously, we were a party of 9, and I think the food we didn't finish could've fed a company of soldiers for a day.  And we ordered one entree each with two or three appetizers to share.   One last thing that made me give them 3 stars was that a buddy of mine ordered Eggs Benedict, and the thing came drenched in Hollandaise sauce.  Literally, you couldn't see what was underneath.   Anyways, just like the rating says, A-OK, but I wouldn't go there again with everything else that Vegas has to offer."
Roxanne C.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",82,15,3,5.0,12/16/2014,Try the Sunday brunch chilaquiles with carnitas they were amazing! my parents both had the breakfast combos and I tried one of their pancakes which in my opinion were perfection. 5 stars to the pancakes!  my parents were both very impressed.
