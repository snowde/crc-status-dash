Crystal W.,"Calgary, Canada",95,592,56,3.0,4/7/2013,"I would give this Cheescake Factory location a better review if they had handled our large group a little better.  They don't take reservations and we had a party of 13.  They gave us the runaround for at least 1.5hrs regarding when we'd be seated.  We tried to kill time in the mall but it truly was a painful wait.  It was moderately frustrating to watch people show up, eat a meal and leave. Aside from this, everything else was great.  The Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad is massive and I had second meal with my leftovers.  The Mango Key Lime Cheesecake is tart and delicious.  I wasn't expecting the crust to include coconut.  I do think they add waaaay too much whipped cream to the plate.  Most people who had desert hardly touched it and it seems like a huge waste.      Our server was friendly and swift.  I don't know if this is normal because they may have been kissing our butt due to the seating issue.  Either way, the experience once we sat down was lovely and I'd definitely return, with a much smaller group this time.  I wouldn't go back with a party larger than 4 or 6."
Michelle F.,"Chicago, IL",51,220,29,4.0,10/22/2012,"I know, I know. If you're on vacation, you should try to eat at non-chain restaurants that are unique to the area and not available elsewhere. But I just couldn't resist eating at The Cheesecake Factory!  We were looking for a place to eat breakfast/lunch on a Saturday morning, and so many of the restaurants were packed and had 45-minute waits. So we walked around the Forum Shops, and there was The Cheesecake Factory, a beacon amid a sea of overpriced stores! We had to go in. And get this: No wait for a table! We sat upstairs on the second floor. This place is huge, by the way. Plenty of seating.  Their menu is also huge, so bring your reading glasses. For an appetizer, we ordered the Made-to-Order Guacamole, which was very good and came with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream - all of the necessary condiments to go along with chips! For an entree, I got the Southwest Chicken Sandwich, which had grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro and chipotle mayo on Toasted French bread. It's also served with jalapenos, but I asked that they don't put them on there, and I'm glad I did because this sandwich definitely had a kick to it. It was really good, though, and I used some of the leftover guacamole from our appetizer on my sandwich, which made it extra good.  Then, of course, we had to get cheesecake. I got the Carmel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. Amazing! The perfect ending to a great meal."
Iliya Y.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",12,38,1,1.0,7/29/2014,Terrible service at check in. We were told to wait 45mins and as of writing of this review it is 70 minutes and we just got seated.
Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,465,44,1.0,12/7/2014,"We usually eat here at least once while in town. This time, I really wish we had not. Sunday morning, 11 am and not too busy.  10 minute wait. Get seated by hostess and 5 mins later our waitress comes for our drink order and says she will bring bread.  5 mins later our drinks come  Not bad. 15 mins later, no waitress, no water, no iced tea, no bread.  I am looking around like... hello? Another 5 mins and nothing happens.  I get up and have to flag down some other server for my iced tea and ask for our bread.  ""I'll check"" he says. A few mins later HE brings the bread, not our waitress.   Then she comes by ""oh sorry, they were baking it"" - BS., I could see other tables being brought bread all the time. 5 more mins go by and she then comes back for our order.  2 entrees and a salad. My salad comes a few mins later with the tiniest portion of dressing on the side.  I finish the dressing with 1/2 the salad to go.... huh?  I start looking around for 'someone' to ask for more dressing.  Literally nobody there even looking around to help me.  Then our server brings the food... ""here is your order, are you done with your salad?"".  Uh, no I needed more dressing but I could flag nobody down to bring me any more.  ""Do you want me to get you more dressing now?"". I tell her no, I don't have that long to wait. Bottom line, the food was great.  The service SUCKED.  Worst ever at a Cheesecake Factory.  And they were not busy!  There was no excuse for it.  Our server had an attitude and just did not care about her customers at all. I left in a really pissed off mood."
Amy T.,"Round Rock, TX",259,747,539,3.0,11/23/2010,"I came here a few wks ago on a Saturday afternoon for dinner with some out-of-state guests. I had been saving The cheesecake factory for a special occasion b/c I dont routinely order dessert.  ENTREE: I ordered the cobb salad which I would never ever order again. Ive had better cobb salads @ Big Dogs! This salad was 95%lettuce with anything else as an afterthought. I coudl count the # of blue cheese crumbles and pieces of what appeard to be walmart deli sliced turkey on my salad. I was not happy..what a waste of $13.00 I'd rather have had wendy's cobb and that isnt very good either.  my bf ordered the chicken Bellagio. OMG 2000 calories but it tasted divine. Basil infused pasta with some sort of lemon ckin on top. Good but Too caloric.  DESSERT: Yum. OMG.. as my Julio (my love) would say, ""this had wedding cake written all over it!!"" we ordered the Red-Velvet Cheesecake. there. are. no. words. I cannot begin to tell you how utterly delicious and marvelous this dessert was. So decadent and sinful yet not too sweet and not so crazy. LOVED IT. We'd come back just for dessert in the future and since his bday is coming up we just might do that.  SERVICE: eh.. it was ok. What I never understood is why when you have a table of at least 6 people, odds are it maybe 3 couples especially if you see there are 3 females and 3 males. maybe. so why on earth would you assume in your infinite wisdom and experience servicing the restaurant industry that one person is going to pay the entire tab? We are going to split this up b/c thats what coupes do. and instead of making this awkward for everyone involved. please ask us if we would like to split this up one 1 ticket or 2 or 3? and make this easier for everyone. at the beginning of the meal. this has annoyed me for years with large restaurants such as this.  end thought: order dessert. go light on food .. split a pizza and go for the dessert!"
Hayley M.,"Portland, OR",79,61,68,4.0,10/5/2014,"Sit down and bring your reading glasses!  This menu was endless! Lots of global options and various dish sizes. I opted for the Chicken Bellagio which exceeded my expectations.  The checkerboard was nicely breaded and moist, the pesto noodles were not too oily, and the arugula salad added a nice crunch. I was only able to eat half at the restaurant,  but my left overs held up well. The cheesecake was delicious of course, no surprise there!"
Alicia C.,"Albuquerque, NM",6,50,7,5.0,6/13/2013,"Lunched here on June 4, 2013 Fried Mac & Cheese is TO DIE FOR.  I can have that and their complimentary bread and call it lunch. Mmmmm!!!  Didn't get any cheesecake this time... :( Son had the calamari and loved it. Came with some fried mini octopus but he didn't eat those. LOL"
Shanna H.,"Lake Isabella, CA",21,13,11,4.0,12/10/2013,"This restaurant is so good! I love the Teriyaki Chicken and rice dinner. The only reason I give this restaurant four stars is because it is always so busy. They don't offer call ahead seating and don't do reservations, so the wait can be long. It's definitely a good place to eat though! Sit out front so you can see the statue show and aquarium!"
Jennifer R.,"Anaheim, CA",81,18,1,4.0,5/19/2014,"The food was great, and you can hear the show happening over the aquarium near by. The waiter seemed to have quite a few tables, but still did a good job of checking on our table of 7. Everyone was happy with their food, and unhappy with their desserts. Too sweet overall. Oh well.  My only problem was that they overcharged my card, though I'm hoping it's fixed soon. Overall I recommend this location.  The shepherds pie and crab cake bites were tasty."
Jia I.,"Toronto, Canada",74,239,1,5.0,9/11/2012,"oh-my-gawd, you have to come and try this! i said i've never been to cheesecake factory, so hubby puts this on our to-do list while we're in vegas. the food - amazing! we had a massive salad thing with purple cabbage, jambalaya noodles, red velvet cheesecake, and our own lemonade and tequila LOL. so surprised they let us drink our own cocktail in the restaurant. but omg the food quality was amazing and totally delicious. since my 2011 vegas trip i've subscribed to the cheesecake factory fanpage on facebook and they don't even have any locations in canada!  our server, i forget his name, he was like the MOST awesome server. like he's funny, honest, and really helped us out. this is the only time we tipped 30% and were happy about it.  okay i only have one bone to pick with this store: bring it to canada!"
Paola C.,"Miami, FL",176,66,13,5.0,7/18/2013,"Pretty much every dish I have ordered from their very big menu has been good.  They have variety for everybody, good prices, good service, good drinks and good cheesecakes!  What is not to like? About this specific location, it is very busy with long wait times.  I honestly prefer going to the off the strip locations.  My favorites are the crab wontons, the avocado rolls, chicken taquitos, the lousiana chicken pasta, herb crusted salmon, jamaican shrimp, shrimp scampi, and stuffed chicken tortillas!....The brown bread served is really good as well as their soups.  Every time I have visitors and I have taken them there, they have absolutely loved it!"
jonathan h.,"San Francisco, CA",50,241,574,4.0,6/7/2013,This review is for the oreo cookie milkshake and key lime cheesecake very good....Nom Nom Nom
Tracy B.,"Port Orchard, WA",2,47,,5.0,11/4/2013,"We were given a gift card for the Cheesecake Factory as a wedding gift & figured, well hell, let's use it for a meal while we are in Vegas on our honeymoon. Las Vegas is an expensive city so I won't say no to a little bit of help to buy some food! First of all, let me start out by telling you about our waitress. Her name is Alicia & let me just say that this girl really knows her stuff. She knows the menu well & is very informative. She went above & beyond in her customer service. Her amazing job is enough to make me consider going back the next time I am in town & for me to give their location a 5 star Yelp rating. Their portion sizes are incredible. I ordered the fish taco's, which easily could have fed two people. My husband & I both left with to-go boxes. The food was delicious & the drinks were great.  I was a little angry with myself because I ate too much of my dinner & could not order cheesecake! I should have taken some to go. The presentations of the desserts are lovely!"
Chris R.,"Las Vegas, NV",277,248,664,4.0,5/1/2013,"I have been visiting this Cheesecake Factory long before I moved to Las Vegas. The multiple levels is a architectural design element not seen in other restaurants, but is necessary because they get so much traffic. It is located at the very end of The Forum Shops commected to Caesars Palace. Having to wait to get in and the long journey it takes to get to this location from the casino, are the only two drawbacks. Everything else, including the staff and food have always been good. It is near a large aquarium and an animatronic show with fire and water, so those help to pass the time. If you are walking around Las Vegas and want to enjoy a nice dinner from a restaurant you know, try this one out."
Jesse H.,"Burnaby, Canada",4,3,3,5.0,1/1/2015,Great location.  We came after finding out that we cound't get a seat at the buffet due to long line.  The staffs were super helpful with getting us a table line up.  There is a huge aquarium right outside of the restaurant to keep the kids entertained.  Our waitress was kind and patient.  Food never disappoint.  Overall a very happy dining experience.
Princess T.,"Las Vegas, NV",63,15,5,3.0,12/30/2014,"Went to this location last night for my father's birthday and we had to wait two long hours to be seated (there were 12 of us - 6 of which were kids). Food was awesome (and came quickly) and our server, Dave (I think), was great. One star for our server, the other for the food, and the third for the yummy cheesecake. Minus two stars for the horrible and unfriendly hostesses and long wait."
Ray C.,"Kapolei, HI",1,11,,5.0,10/10/2013,"We met a few friends in Vegas, and thought it would be nice to go to the Cheesecake Factory.  We hoped that it would be consistent with the quality we have come to enjoy like the one in Waikiki on Oahu. We were not disappointed.  We started with a few appetizers, the crab artichoke dip is the best!  My wife had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (with a Thai Curry flair) and I had the Chicken and Sausage Gumbo.  Both were outstanding, and highly recommended! The hostess was very courteous, and our waitress was extremely attentive.  The only disappointment was not having time to stay for dessert!  We had to leave en route to a 7 p.m. show of the Jersey Boys playing at the Paris Hotel!  That was also a 5 star experience!"
Margret C.,"Las Vegas, NV",208,1402,738,4.0,7/2/2010,"My husband  and I came here on our first date, some years ago, but we went to the Summerlin location where there was an hour long wait, and ended up here. I got a salad and he got the thai noodle dish. We decided to go here again for date night during the week (now that he works days we can do things during the week, which is nice). We were able to get a table upstairs right away. Weekends are crazy busy-waits can be less painful by gazing at the very impressive aquarium featuring many different kinds of fish and some rays. This is a popular place among tourists so be prepared to wait.  The service is very good (refilled drinks). We were presented with a bread basket (sourdough & honey oat) within minutes of being seated. Our drinks came right away. I ordered the chicken and shrimp gumbo (came with chunks of sausage and a large scoop of rice in the middle) while my husband ordered the shepherd's pie. The menu is about 19 pages long including 34 varieties of cheesecake! It was almost hard to choose something since there are so many choices. Most of the dishes are served on huge white plates (more like platters). It didn't seem too long for our dinners to arrive. The presentation was nice- parsley generously sprinkled around the entire perimeter of my plate. My husband thought that my dinner was small, but I only ate half of it, and took the rest home (as did he). The gumbo was good, but not traditional, in that the broth was clear, and secondly, there were big chunks of tomatoes. I thought that this is worth mentioning since I am a big fan of the traditional style gumbo with the roux (oyster bar at stations). The dish My husband's dinner was good and large (compared to mine), but I am not really a fan of this dish.  For both our dinners, one drink, one water, it was about $35 plus tip. The ambiance (there is patio seating available), the service, the food, the wide variety of menu items, including cheesecake, the complimentary bread basket, and the location make this chain restaurant very attractive. (As busy as this one is, the one in Oahu seems to be the busiest CF location ever. This is the original location in Las Vegas; two others in Summerlin and Green Valley.) Also worth mentioning, the free show,  and the shopping is great- from the Gap, Bath & Body Works, the always-packed Apple store, and Victoria's Secret in the original part of the Forum Shops. Newly expanded stores include: Swatch, Tommy Bahama, Harry Winston, and Anthropologie. It might be confusing to some people how the different levels are, but just ask someone to point you in the right direction."
Nicole B.,"Portland, OR",10,34,6,5.0,7/10/2012,"I was in Vegas with my mom and sister for a girls weekend.  This was our last dinner in town.  I had never been to a CF in my life.  It was a Saturday night and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our table. Once seated, they presented us with menus that could feed an army one at a time.  I believe it was quoted to me at 30+ pages! Our server, Steven B. made the experience phenomenal.  He's adorable, very humorous and ON IT!  By on it I mean he anticipated our every whim all the while still finding time to give other tables around good service.  He kept coming by on his way from another table to crack a joke or two. I have never felt so welcomed at a large restaurant before.  The personalized service would have prompted me to review this place even if the food was mediocre.  Except the food wasn't mediocre.  I ordered a taco salad from the Skinnylicious menu and was shocked at the enormous size AND it was delicious.  I also sampled the Ahi appetizer which was delectable.  My mom ordered a to die for pear martini. Thank you CF for making things such a great experience and a special thanks to Steven B. for being the ULTIMATE in service staff.  You are my hero!"
Denise B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,4.0,7/12/2012,"Eat here for lunch often - always get treated well by the staff - seated quickly, they are very organized when it comes to seating.  Today, I had the Margarita Pizza, it was very good and very reasonably priced.  They servers always watch our time to make sure we get back to work within our lunch hour."
