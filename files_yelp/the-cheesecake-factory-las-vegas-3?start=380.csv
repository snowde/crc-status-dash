Shauncy J.,"Hayward, CA",600,164,545,5.0,5/5/2014,This place was really nice! The drinks were really strong and the food was delicious. The waitress was sweet and she was really attentive. She made sure our drinks said full amd we never had to ask for much. I will come here every time I'm in Las Vegas. I was seated within 15 minutes and I was delighted.
Michael V.,"Ashburn, VA",44,71,3,1.0,10/4/2015,"Absolutely horrible service. Six of us came here today (as in I'm writing this from the table) and it took nearly an hour to get our meals. When our meals came out, one of the heuvos rancheros was really undercooked. We sent the meal back and it took another 20 minutes to get it back. Although the manager came over, he didn't apologize or anything. He just said, it will be out in two minutes...and it took another 8-10. In addition to this debacle, drinks took forever to come out and they forgot to give us basic condiments like syrup for our french toast. This was a really horrible experience. I think the manager and our waitress (Patricia A.) should be fired for incompetence and poor customer service."
Sarah T.,"Huntington, WV",29,165,83,4.0,2/25/2011,"I had the Ahi Salad and it was Delicious. Big fan! I also had the strawberry shortcake and it was also amazing.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and they had a little ""outdoor'' patio area to eat on. Of course, since it was inside with the forum shops in Caesar's Palace, it was still inside. Good food!"
Kelsey G.,"Goleta, CA",0,36,4,1.0,10/27/2015,The lettuce for my burger was brown and had a slimey consistencey. The water cups had food in them upon arrival. This was by far the most disappointing meal I have ever had. $15 for a hamburger should get you quality food. Save your money and go elsewhere.
David S.,"Las Vegas, NV",570,1050,274,3.0,5/7/2012,"Instead of fighting the crowd out after a show at the Colosseum, it is better to just get dinner and wait it out. I do not have fond memories of this location. I had a birthday here when I was a teenager, 7 out of 25 of us got food poisoning, and never looked back until now. Almost a decade has passed and a part of me cringed when my friend suggested going here. I wanted to go to the other place known for their desserts in the Forums, but she is allergic to chocolate.  Between three of us, we split the Buffalo Chicken Blasts, Skinnylicious Spicy Chicken Salad, and the Everything Pizza with kalamata olives and jalapenos. Overall, the food was decent. It is nothing spectacular. In fact, the only thing that is impressive about it is the sheer amount they give you. We could have probably stuck with two items and splitting between three."
David M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,121,201,5.0,10/20/2014,"Great food, friendly staff, and great service. Great place to get together with friends and family. They also have the best cheesecake in town !! There might be a bit of a wait, as it is a favorite place to go to eat, when shopping in the Caesar's Forum."
Alan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",506,1367,207,3.0,12/18/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a safe chain restaurant to go to for affordable yet ample portioned meals. We came here on a Thursday night. Our server Loni was excellent. She was quite attentive to us. However, the bread she initially brought us was burned and really hard. Then, more bread came but it was cold. The better Cheesecake Factory restaurants normally toast the bread on the spot so that when the customer eats it, it is warm and soft, not cold and burned. I ordered from the special menu (the separate insert) where they have the chef's specialty items for that particular restaurant. I ordered the salmon with spinach and angel hair pasta. The salmon was excellent. However, their sauce was extremely creamy and oily. It was very overwhelming. If the sauce was replaced with let's say marinara sauce, it would have been perfect. So, I ended up eating all the spinach and salmon only and left the sauce and angel hair pasta alone."
Sarah M.,"Manteca, CA",218,263,420,3.0,3/1/2014,I ordinarily don't go to Vegas to eat at restaurants that I can eat at home but my first day in Vegas and I was just looking for some quick reasonably priced lunch before I went shopping so I settled for here. I came right as it opened and there was already a line forming to get inside. The seated everyone pretty quick though and had more than enough staff to accommodate everyone. I ordered the calamari and it was good. Ive had it before so I knew what to expect. My server was excellent. She was attentive the whole time and I always had what I needed. I was looking forward to enjoying their s'mores galore cheesecake but was very disappointed that they ran out. I wold think that at the beginning of the day they would have all flavors available so that was annoying. I opted for the white chocolate raspberry and I was not impressed. I expected to be better than it was so that was a bust. I did not spend a lot of time there. I just kind of got in and got out kind of thing so there is nothing else to really review. It was a pretty basic visit. Honestly I highly doubt that I would go back because there are better places to eat in Vegas that I don't have access to at home.
Garrick M.,"Tomah, WI",0,15,6,1.0,12/26/2015,Went here with three family members while on vacation. We shared two nachos orders and now we all have food poisoning. Not how I imagined spending my time in Vegas! Needless to say I don't recommend eating at this location.
Jessica A.,"El Paso, TX",3,18,13,5.0,10/5/2014,mmm yummy cheesecake and yummy food. friendly staff and great options for food. beautiful restaurant as well.
Jen N.,"San Jose, CA",350,93,12,4.0,7/18/2014,"Love this place! Came here last year and this year as well when I visited Vegas. I love the pasta here. The cheesecakes are great too, but it is super sweet. If you come at the right timing, they have a show in the evening on top of the fish tank. It was pretty cool. Service here was great, but we had a server coming up to us asking if an order was ours (not very professional...)."
Jenna R.,"Beaverton, OR",105,32,4,5.0,8/18/2014,Our wait time was only about 20 min for the place being completely packed. Our server was super helpful and our food came incredibly fast! It was super delicious and reasonable priced.
Kristine W.,"Seattle, WA",133,659,153,4.0,4/22/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory!  I've been to a few in So.Cal, but we decided to visit this one before we head back to L.A. I love their pastas [pasta davinci, spicy chicken chipotle pasta], but this visit I decided to try a breakfast dish.  I had Joe's Special [check out the pic] which was an egg scramble with mushrooms, onions, chicken sausage, and spinach with potatoes and toast.  It was very tasty. YUM.  I also had the drink- typhoon punch  to go with it and it was very good. Haha a cocktail with breakfast! YUM! I also love their cheesecake [you would hope so with the restaurant named Cheesecake Factory] - I've had a few, the Godiva Cheesecake, Fresh Strawberry, Tiramisu and others which I can't remember. But they are all tasty!"
Jacquelyn D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",1,27,,4.0,9/23/2015,"Great food as usual!  Staff was fantastic and our server was amazing!  Only issue was the seating process.  they took our name, had us come back after 15 minutes, and then made us all stand there for another 15 minutes (there were about 20 other groups waiting too).  it would be much better to either have a buzzer option or maybe a text option.  I've been to the Cheesecake factory all over the country - seating hasn't been an issue before so maybe this is new."
Philip T.,"Las Vegas, NV",4993,810,1540,4.0,11/3/2007,If you can't find anything you like in what appears to be the largest menu in the world....something is wrong with you. I haven't made it to dessert in the last 5 times I have been here.  I usually get an appetizer and the cajun jambalaya pasta.  There have been a couple of times where I was lead astray and ordered something else but I just ended up regretting it going back to the pasta dish.   Some of my coworkers eat here everyday.
Amanda L.,"Twinsburg, OH",17,34,12,3.0,9/16/2015,"I work in the forum shops, and my coworkers and I always go here to eat on our lunches. Usually the associates at the cash register are very friendly and accommodating, but Tiffany s was far from it. I asked for a side of marinara for my bread, and was charged 3.95 for a half cup of marinara. I have never been charged before for this. I called two hours ahead of time to have it ready at 10pm for my lunch. I got there at 9:59 and then waited 6 minutes for my food. Once I walked back to my store, it was cold! I asked her why I was being charged 4.00 for a small side of marinara and she asked if I wanted to speak with a manager but since I had already waited 6 minutes for my food, I didn't have time. This establishment lacks consistency. She was rude and inconsiderate and I think I may just start packing lunches instead of taking business to Cheesecake Factory. I don't like being ripped off!"
Harriet W.,"San Francisco, CA",626,381,484,2.0,1/9/2012,"Actually, this was my first time at a Cheesecake Factory, and surprisingly, I wasn't that impressed with the food.  Maybe I didn't order the right dish.  I ordered a fettuccine alfredo and it was just overall nothing special. I tried to eat as much as I could because it was the last meal before heading to the airport to go back home, and I'd get hungry if I didn't eat.  But anyway, I felt like I could've probably whipped up a better fettuccine alreado at home if I tried. On the other hand, I did like my boyfriend's pasta dish a lot more.  We didn't get a cheesecake, since we were already full. (Well, I forced myself to eat as much as I could. haha) Hopefully, I'll be more impressed with another dish or just different location of the Cheesecake Factory."
Cherry C.,"Brooklyn, NY",81,45,43,5.0,12/26/2012,The waiters are really busy... Pasta Da Vinci was veeery tasty And the cheesecake... yummy!
Andrew M.,"San Francisco, CA",12,156,,3.0,2/13/2012,"Oh it felt so good to sit down. My girlfriend and I had marched up and down the strip, through the hotels, casinos, and shops enjoying all the sights that could be had. But then our legs started to push back against us. We were wondering around the Forum when we realized a break was need. So we stopped in Cheesecake and got ourselves some much needed water and nachos (food in general was need so we went with nachos). The plate was huge and delicious but they may have just been because of my state of mind. Any way this is a pretty normal cheesecake. It looks pretty nice but in reality they are all about the same. I regretted that I was so hungry that I did not try to find a place to eat that does not already exist at home."
Pamela Y.,"Canyonville, OR",7,112,65,3.0,8/22/2014,"Good food and the cheesecake is why you come here.  A little noisy but doable.  Service is good and wines are good as well.  Nice specialty drinks as, alcohol and non-alcohol.  Fun Atmosphere as you are in the forum shops. Had the flatbread and grandson had chicken strips.  Large menu selection."
