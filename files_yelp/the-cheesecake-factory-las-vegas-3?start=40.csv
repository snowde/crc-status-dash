Big S.,"Concord, CA",173,33,94,5.0,9/22/2017,This was a fantastic experience. I have never been to any Cheesecake Factory that was crowded and got seated in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the chicken and biscuit dinner with a honey bourbon  and it was fantastic. My Bay ordered an omelet and it came out hot.  The food was great and service was outstanding.
Soo C.,"Las Vegas, NV",128,170,109,3.0,11/11/2016,"I was here last night to have a dinner with my friends as they were craving pasta. We were quoted a 15 minute wait, which was pretty accurate. After a short wait, we were taken to a nice booth seat, and our server came right away. We ordered some cocktails and th buffalo chicken as appetizers. Their cocktails are pretty big for their price and they tasted very good- we ordered blood orange margarita, blood orange mojito and pina colada. With our cocktails, the server brought us some warm breads with butter, which were good as well.  The buffalo chicken was a deep fried dish of buffalo marinaded chicken chunks. However, there wasn't enough cheese or chicken inside the fried skin, so we had to end up just digging for the chicken to not get full from the fried part. As soon as we were done with our appetizers, our pastas were served. The portions were enourmous, like how cheesecake serves all their foods.  Along with two bowtie pastas that my friends ordered which seemed fine, my shrimp scampi failed. The angel hair was dry when serves, there was no sauce, and it seemed like it was waiting for the kitchen line for awhile to be served. The shrimp was not sauteed as mentioned on their description but it was deep fried-and remember their appetizer was heavily fried as well. There was just not enough sauce for the whole dish to feel moist. The shrimps were so heavy that it did not go well with the angel hair. Also, their garlics were not sliced at all; but served in chunks.  Their service was good, but if I were to go back again, I would stay with the skinny side of their menu, since they do not deep fry every ingredient."
Sara J.,"Redmond, OR",3,33,76,5.0,8/3/2017,Waitress was awesome. I ordered the cheese pasta with chicken and the carrot cheese cake. It was so yummy. I would definitely come again to try any of the other pastas.
Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",988,1138,6855,4.0,3/27/2016,"When in Rome do as the Roman's do. A popular thing to do in this Roman themed mall is to visit the Cheesecake Factory. At the Forum Shops, all roads lead to the Cheesecake Factory located where the main corridor concludes at the Journey to Atlantis Show.     It seems that the time I initially started visiting this Cheesecake Factory is older than the statues and columns that border this Roman themed mall. In a sense this is partially true considering that my visits go back long ago prior to the Forum Shops expansion when Virgin Records was the cool place to visit during the George W. Bush administration. Today, at the end of the Obama administration, the food and dining experience here is just as good as when George W. Bush was in office.     This Cheesecake Factory is usually busy. There is quite a difference waiting here than an uninteresting  place such as the DMV. Here, patrons wait in an area with the sounds and sights of Rome. Where else can you wait for dinner while watching statues above a 50,000 gallon aquarium come to life to battle it out in the ""Fall of Atlantis""? Waiting gets even better with the signature cheesecake displays at the other side of the hostess. Waiting would be even better if there was no waiting. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to offer the texting or beeper system.     The Cheesecake Factory is a spacious and attractive restaurant that includes tables overlooking the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show. The tables deep inside the restaurant are envoloped in an elegant interior. On the majority of my visits including the latest, we sat deep in the restaurant.     The Cheesecake menu is to restaurants what the nearby 50,000 gallon aquarium is to aquariums: Giantic! As soon as I saw eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta, on this visit I instantaneously bypassed around 250 other choices. Eggplant parmesan is one of my favorite dishes. I was so :-) to see it on the menu. With that said, in the past I have enjoyed commendable sandwiches including the eggplant parmesan sandwich, burgers, and a BLT. The eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta is reasonably priced at $14.95. Unlike some restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip, this is not a tourist trap. With the entree, I ordered bottomless Coke. Ahead of the dinner, the attentive waiter served us bread with butter.   The eggplant parmesan was delicious with a capital D. The Cheesecake Factory style of serving eggplant parmesan is separate round pieces bordering pesto pasta. Every bite of the eggplant parmesan covered with mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, and marina cheese made me feel like a Roman emperor. Likewise I relished the taste of the pesto pasta. This is the first time that a restaurant served eggplant parmesan with pesto pasta. Cheesecake Factory had broke the tradition of serving eggplant parmesan with pasta under marinara sauce. Regardless, I truly enjoyed it. The dinner was so enjoyable that time went fast, and before you knew it we were leaving Rome for the Las Vegas Strip. It's just a shame that I never leave enough room for the cheesecake.    I have been a fan of this Cheesecake Factory going back years prior to holding a smartphone when Virgin Records was the attraction. This dining environment inside a faux Ancient Rome overlooking a 50,000 gallon aquarium where statues come to life to battle it out in the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show is exclusive. The generous menu offers several choices from the cheeseburger to eggplant parmesan. The prices are reasonable. And the service has always been solid. In conclusion, Julius Caesar would be proud of the Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory."
Mark S.,"Henderson, NV",1,3,1,1.0,8/12/2017,"Really bad pizza,super slow serving cramberry is fake coke was not as normal 1 apple juice is 3/4water and  costs much the pizza was burned room tempeture is like it was inbtge freezer to them I dont recommend  in,n out is way better!"
Paul C.,"Washington, DC",10,56,24,4.0,4/19/2017,I have been to many Cheesecake Factories all over the country and this particular location seems to always hit the mark in the food department. I usually order either steak with mash potatoes or a pasta and they always come out good! The only two things that I have a gripe about are the wait times and that annoying creepy dragon that comes out of the aquarium every 20 min and shoots out flames. They really need to remove that because it's ear piercingly loud and gets annoying after the first time you hear it.
Amna F.,"Mississauga, Canada",76,159,592,4.0,4/29/2016,"*3.5/5* This is located at the end of Caesar's Forum Shops, right next to Nike/behind the fountain with the light show. I came as part of a group of 5 on a Sunday afternoon, wait time for a table was only about 10 minutes. They seemed to be understaffed as wait times once seated were long, and a couple errors were made (olives forgotten on pizza, request for no whip cream forgotten, etc).  I ate the avocado egg rolls app - these are made fresh at the restaurant. The egg rolls were crispy on the outside and the tamarind sauce paired well with it - tasty mix of sweet/tangy.  For dessert, I had the Cookie Dough cheesecake - super dense and delicious.   A couple friends shared Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake which was tasty but a bit too much going on for me (brownie, cake, coconut, chocolate chips, cheesecake)."
Amanda B.,"Petersburg, VA",128,288,84,5.0,6/1/2017,"This place was busy for lunch but we were both hungry and neither of us knew what we wanted, so we came here.  As always, the menu is huge.  Service was fantastic and quick.  It wasn't very loud, and you can't hear anything from the Fall of Atlantis show that's just outside.  Both of our food dishes were very yummy and my Mai Tai was made superbly.  I would very much return, this is one of the best Cheesecake Factories I've been to."
Bonnie A.,"Edmonton, Canada",160,444,841,3.0,11/24/2016,"With so many high end restaurants in Vegas, it's nice to have the option of a restaurant with good food for less than $20 a person (without cheesecake, of course). My SO loves the herb roasted chicken ($18.50). It's very flavorful.  I generally like the goat cheese pear flatbread but last time I had it a this location is was lacking flavour, so this time I opted for the skinny-licious turkey sandwich. I believe the menu said it was oven roast turkey breast, so I expected hot but it was just cold turkey meat. The bun was delicious. FYI - my SO is looking over my shoulder and does not agree with my 3 star rating. He says his chicken is 4 stars. He can write his own review"
K H.,"San Leandro, CA",0,82,39,3.0,4/11/2017,I have been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for years.  And Las Vegas was having really bad weather that day.  There were extenuating circumstances.
Sarah B.,"San Diego, CA",2,48,81,5.0,7/9/2017,"Yum! Never been to a Cheesecake Factory and didn't like it. We had the kale quinoa salad super bomb, chicken carbonara amazing and the fish and chips. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasty."
Derek R.,"Ajax, Canada",0,21,43,4.0,7/16/2017,The one main reason I love Cheesecake Factory and the USA. PORTIONS!!! The food and service here were great!!! Price was reasonable. Did not disappoint on the dessert. Can't wait til Cheesecake Factory opens here in The 6 at Yorkdale
Laura S.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/11/2017,"Despite reading some of the negative reviews we decided to give the Cheesecake Factory a try and we weren't disappointed.  We were seated immediately and drinks were served promptly. Our food was served hot and the best part was our waitress Karen was so attentive. She even brought complimentary soup since they ran out of turkey for my turkey burger. I didn't mind since they have so many wonderful choices. Yes, I will definitely return next time we visit Las Vegas."
Caroline S.,"Fort Collins, CO",60,53,19,4.0,6/20/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located inside Caesars Palace and is absolutely beautiful! Eat outside if you can. We had no wait and our waitress was very accommodating. I ordered the Mexican Tortilla salad- delicious and fresh. As an appetizer we had the basil, mozzarella, tomato flatbread- also good but small. My boyfriend ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken- very tasty! Lunch portions are great. Of course we ended with Cheesecake and requested the key lime- tasted fresh and sweet and perfectly tart. Try the tropical iced tea too."
Nikki B.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",70,41,128,4.0,4/30/2017,"Large menu, many choices never go wrong!! Short wait and good service and very generic menu good all over the country :)"
J Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,18,13,4.0,9/25/2017,"I love this place. Their cheesecakes always hit the spot. It's hard for me to pick a favorite, but I really like the raspberry lemon, s'mores, and pumpkin cheesecake! The veggie burger is really good thanks to the grilled onions in the patty, but as soon as you take a bite it starts breaking apart. We went on my birthday and they sang Happy birthday & brought a complimentary sundae. I guess they don't do the free cheesecake anymore? The service was ok."
Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1089,1716,2662,4.0,1/4/2016,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. It's a chain. It's over-priced. But it sure is tasty. And there are so many food, drink, and dessert options. I can dine forever on just appetizers here. This particular location is nestled in the Caesar's Forum Shops. It's rarely too crazy busy where there's a wait. I prefer dining on the faux ""patio"" so I can people watch the mall. And you can sorta see, albeit mostly hear, the free show thingy that happens at the fountain / fish tank out front of this location. Service was decent. A bit scattered. But attentive and friendly enough. On my visit here, they were out of buffalo blasts. Which was incredibly sad as those are the absolute most greatest thing ever at Cheesecake Factory. In fact, they are the best take on buffalo wings my taste buds have had the pleasure of enjoying. But it wasn't a total dismal thing as there was a new (at least to me) menu item - buffalo chicken meatballs. They were just like the buffalo blasts, but in meatball form. Extremely tasty. The mac 'n' cheese bites were also a hit. The Cheesecake Factory really does do this trendy appetizer better than most. All the other appetizers we sampled were tasty too, but less memorable and crave-worthy. All in all, there are far better, more unique, Vegas-specific places to throw down your money for good eats. But when you need to please a crowd, have a specific craving, everywhere else is full, and/or you just need to get off your feet and eat right now and you're right by here... It's better than most other chains and it's got decent people watching."
Darren J.,"Calgary, Canada",15,208,1547,5.0,1/26/2016,"Always enjoy Cheesecake Factory.  This location is tucked in a corner of Caesars palace forum of shops.  Great extensive menu, portions, lively ambience and great pricing. Love lunch menu portions which are still too large but great value.  Service always top notch and friendly. Desserts are what makes this place too. Any cheesecake is delicious.  Definitely worth the stop."
N B.,"Auburn, WA",10,28,8,1.0,7/16/2017,"Ordered two iced teas, took over 15 min and just decided to leave because apparently they are hard to make. Sad service for being inside caesars palace. Waiter didn't know the prices of drinks either. Tried to say mojitos were 15 bucks each but he ""wasn't sure"". Whatever, won't come back."
Anna D.,"Pleasanton, CA",5,9,7,2.0,9/13/2017,"Pretty horrible service tonight, came out for my birthday dinner. We had to wait 45 mins to be seated which is understandable. But had to wait 15 to get water and bread and over an hour for our food. It took the waitress over 20 minutes just to bring us our card at the end. Really awful and kind of ruined my day. :("
