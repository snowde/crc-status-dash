Janise S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,2,5.0,11/1/2015,"Love The Cheesecake factory! Their Steak Diane melts in your mouth, good quality and excellent mashed taters! The setting is romantic and elegant. Very nice atmosphere and you get superior service! This location at Ceasars is fun and relaxing, better than the other two locations!"
Brian A.,"Lecompte, LA",29,29,5,5.0,7/21/2014,Came in for a quick snack and drinks. Sat at the bar.  Bartender was extremely friendly and helpful. The food is always excellent. And the portions are huge.  We always split an appettizer and an entree between the two of us. And we still have leftovers for lunch the next day. Always. Must hit stop on any trip.
Dylan L.,"Denver, CO",134,450,39,4.0,3/22/2012,"This place can be an absolute nightmare to get to as it's at the very, very, very back of the forum shops, but it's worth it. The food is normal Cheesecake Factory fare-the menu is huge. I went for the California Cheesesteak and enjoyed it. No cheesecake this time around, but looking around and seeing folks eating it, it looked delicious. Our server was awesome. Despite juggling a lot of tables during a busy lunch hour, he was on top of his game and got everything right. He really impressed. This is a good choice for lunch or dinner, especially if you're staying in Caesar's."
Jason J.,"Centennial, CO",109,968,38,3.0,3/7/2010,"The wife and I were wandering around looking for a decent place to eat lunch and finally settled on the Cheesecake Factory. It was honestly the first place we saw in the forum shops which didn't make either one of us go ""meh"".  I didn't feel like a burger so settled on a spicy crispy chicken sandwich. It really didn't have a spice to it but it didn't taste too bad. The service was excellent, however. I go thru a ton of pop refills, especially when I'm out walking and wandering, and the server was on it.  There wasn't a wait to get seated, but they made us go upstairs - wait, there's a 2nd floor to a restaurant on the forums, it must have an awesome view! - nah, don't get too excited. It's a small, enclosed space with the only view being that of the other tables. The middle is cut out so you can look down on the bar, but that's about it."
Laura D.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,7,,4.0,10/27/2011,"I went on a Wednesday night thinking it would be fairly slow but I was wrong! My guest and I got there and were immediately seated which was great. I ordered a steak, not sure which one but it was delicious. It also comes with your choice of french fries, onion rings, mashed potatoes, or a baked potato. I chose the french fries. The service was awesome. Very friendly staff. This was about my 4th visit and I will definitely keep coming back and I will also recommend it!"
Shokouh H.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",151,327,98,4.0,1/11/2012,"Hubby and I got a CF gift card for Christmas and made a date night out of it. This is, I believe, one of the two cf in Las Vegas. This one was located inside of the Forum Shops at Caesers. Outside of the restaurant was very crowded due to customers going in and out and the little fire show that goes on right outside of the restaurant. I'm glad we asked for seats deeper inside because we ended up getting a 2 person booth which was way more quite and had more of a private feel to it.  The service we received here was excellent. Everything we asked for got there in no time by one of the waiters even if we had asked another one of them. We were impressed. The food was good too. I have some chicken pesto pasta dish and my husband got the fish tacos. We both liked our food and the Adios Long Island drinks were strong and awesome.  We really had a good time at this place but were just too full by the end to try any of their cheesecake desserts - which means we will have to go back for another visit."
Megan S.,"Vancouver, Canada",16,11,,4.0,12/22/2011,"I've certainly eaten at other Cheesecake Factories around the U.S., so I had an idea what to expect. The Las Vegas location was a pleasant surprise. My boyfriend (vegan) and I (vegetarian) were armed in the knowledge that, with the insanely large menu the Factory boasts, there will surely be something for us here. We shared the lettuce wrap appetizer, and I had the margareta flatbread, then a grown-up milkshake for dessert. Because we ordered the lettuce wrap sans-poultry, the server brought us avocado to sub. This was the most surprising part of the meal: the lettuce wrap consisted of ultra fresh, crisp vegetables and delicious sauces. I would absolutely order this again, though I'm not much for salady wrap things. My flatbread was crisp and warm (it's hard to mess up a margareta pizza, and the Cheesecake Factory provided the standard delicious flavour I'm expecting.) The milkshake included caramel, pretzels, booze, ice cream, whipped cream. An insane indulgence but truly flavourful, and I highly recommend this if (like me) you love the sweet and salty combination. The FORVM Atlantis fountain show in the background can get irritating if you're not seated within the restaurant. (FFS, pick an heir to the kingdom already, aargh.) For a large-scale, affordable (for Vegas) chain-restaurant, Cheesecake Factory offered us surprisingly fresh food and efficient service."
Ruben H.,"Chino Valley, AZ",16,27,13,3.0,6/7/2014,For a cheesecake factory restaurant I was very in displeased. The waiter didn't bring out the bread basket until we asked for it and my Cuban sandwich had roast fat instead of roast beef. This was the most discouraging meal I've had from the cheesecake factory and is not typical of their food quality or service.
Marisa M.,"Knoxville, TN",15,139,133,5.0,6/15/2012,"Great choices, reasonably priced for the Strip. Food came out fast despite the packed house. We had a great waiter too!   I wanted to order ""the Leonard"" but it wasn't a menu option."
Jennilee B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",217,18,5,5.0,2/8/2012,"Absolutely love this restaurant! The menu is overwhelming but I love the variety.  My favorite drink is the Georgia peach! Although i didn't taste much alcohol in it but it's delicious! I use to only order the Navajo sandwich which has chicken, avocado, tomato, onions, lettuce in a fry bread. But then I started ordering the MISO SALMON. & Oh my goodness!!! My new favorite dish. Salmon was cooked to perfection, very moist, and was on top of a bead of rice. Surrounding the rice was some kind of creamy white sauce which was amazing and compliments the dish very well, along with chikapeas. I asked the server what sauce it was and she said its some kind of lemon sauce which didn't taste like it at all. Seemed like it has some mayo in it mixed with something else. My mom said it tasted like it had some coconut cream in it. I'll have to ask the server again. I highly recommend the miso salmon!! & of course the love the bread and butter :)"
Ron H.,"San Clemente, CA",51,46,86,2.0,5/2/2012,"It was our first night staying at Caesars and I was a bit worn out from the drive, so I didn't feel like going too far for dinner. At about 8:30 we went into the Forum Shops area and found a number of places that looked good. One of the last we ran across was the Cheesecake Factory. We didn't want anything that fancy and had dined at different Cheesecake Factory restaurants many times so we decided that this would be fine. We ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a Pizza. While we were waiting, all of a sudden, loud throbbing music filled the indoor courtyard. We asked the server what was going on and were told that the Nike store next door was having a promotion or kick-off of some sort. The music was a non-stop throbbing `new-age' sound which was NOT pleasant. The Pizza was eventually served, but w/out the Chicken Caesar salad. While sharing the pizza, the music suddenly stopped. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! Within just minutes there was an explosion and flames coming from the top of the aquarium in the center of the indoor courtyard. Then large animated figurines rose from amidst the flames and went into a `skit' for the people on the other side of the aquarium. It, too, was almost deafening w/ continued explosions and background sounds. As it was directed away from us we could not make out the dialog, just the explosions and screaming. Well, we're on our second piece of pizza and the manager comes to the table stating that the Chicken Caesar salad would be a bit longer. I told him to forget it. He asked if I was sure and I replied, 'yes'. So, as we're starting our 3rd (and last) slice of pizza... out comes the Chicken Caesar salad. Plop... not a word... and the server (not our waiter) walks away. I nibbled at it, but wasn't that hungry and left most in the bowl. Just as we are about to ask for the check the `skit' ends. Yea! A bit of peace and quiet... NOT! The Nike noise returns... along with the check which includes the Chicken Caesar. I run down the server and recant my conversation w/ the manager. He says he'll look into it and after about 5 minutes returns with the check w/o the Chicken Caesar. At this point all we wanted to do was leave, so we didn't wait for change, leaving a 25%+ tip for service worth about 10% and an experience worth avoiding."
David T.,"Lake Worth, FL",131,619,114,4.0,4/19/2014,We came here for a late dinner. The reason this is not a 5 start review is because the food is not fantastic.  We had Jeremy and Jose as our waiters at the bar. They were awesome guys. We spoke about Hawaii worth Jose. The stuffed mushrooms have breadcrumbs in it is we had to return that. I hate wasting food. We also just shared the luau salad.  It was decent. But the service made up for the food. Thanks guys.
Angela W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,49,,5.0,6/6/2015,This restaurant was the savior during our trip to Vegas. The food is outstanding (lots of it) and reasonably priced as are the drinks. There's something for everyone - all the other restaurants in and around the Strip are designed to rip you off and they serve mediocre food but not the Cheesecake Factory. Well done and thank you!
Jenny L.,"Placentia, CA",350,226,226,3.0,7/8/2010,"Key lime cheesecake: I guess the tartness of the key lime just doesn't complement the flavors of the original cheesecake mix well, but the crust alone was amazing. Brownie sundae: Don't come to THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY for a brownie sundae. The brownie was kind of hard and not very chewy and didn't have a very nice smooth chocolate flavor. Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake: I couldn't taste the cookie dough at all, it was just like eating the original cheesecake that accidentally had bland cookie dough thrown in and the oreo crust was too bitter for my liking."
Carly L.,"Eastvale, CA",11,51,,3.0,1/15/2012,"As expected, cheese cake factory doesn't really differ much to location. I came here with my friends for lunch since we were in vegas for the weekend. The wait was only 15-20 minutes and since we were there for lunch we weren't sure how the portions were. We only had dinner at cheesecake and never lunch. So we asked about the lunch portions and still it was huge. My friend and I ended up sharing the BBQ chicken cobb salad which I absolutely love and my other friend got their fish and chips. Service was fine. They were quick to get things to your table and our server was super nice. The food was the same as the one near brea mall, but it seemed the one here in vegas paid more attention to it because our salad wasn't drenched in the dressing. It seemed to be perfected dressed and you can taste the different tastes rather than everything having one flavor. That was probably the distinction between the two places which was nice for a change."
Aimee K.,"San Francisco, CA",2,15,,5.0,6/20/2015,Spent 5 days in Vegas and went there for 3 dinners. Large portion sizes and at a great value. Food never disappoints and you know what you are getting. Staff were very attentive and wait was not long at all.. they seem to know how to run the place very efficiently. Well done - can't wait to go back next time in Vegas.
H. B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,21,,5.0,5/28/2015,"I never ever eat at Cheesecake Factory at home because there is always an obscene line, but I was able to grab a table here.  I had completely forgotten how good this place is. The variety, quality and taste of the food is fantastic and the service was great too. I understand why people do actually stand in a long line to eat here."
Julia D.,"London, United Kingdom",247,588,234,4.0,2/23/2014,No different than any other Cheesecake factory. I love the Cheesecake Factory. It's an American staple and I adore it. This one was interesting because it had that absolutely bizarre fountain outside it and there was no wait. INCREDIBLE!
Matthew K.,"Fremont, CA",0,17,4,3.0,8/1/2015,Cheesecake and comfort food.  Service is a bit slow especially upstairs so avoid if possible.  Server was never around to ask for refills or other items needed.  Tip reflected the service.
Fastway T.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,12,8,5.0,6/21/2015,The food here was amazing like always and the executive chef Andres even came out to our table to say hi !!
