Margarita L.,"San Leandro, CA",11,111,,4.0,7/28/2012,"I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory before, but I am in Vegas with my kids and I wanted a child friendly place to eat.  This was a pretty good choice.  We went there at 8 PM on a Friday night, and there was an anticipated 35 minute wait - but they gave us a piece of paper and told us to come back in half an hour.  That gave us time to check out the nearby stores and watch the ""Fall of Atlantis"" show right outside.  Unfortunately, it took an extra ten minutes before the anticipated time before we got seated and the kids were quite tired by then. The prices were pretty reasonable. My Monterey burger came with cheese, onions, arugula and avocado an was $12, plus an extra one to substitute the fries with sweet potato fries.  The burger was good, though not as juicy as I'd like it (I ordered it medium rare), but the fries were phenomenal.   My oldest had the pasta alfredo ($7), but she was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  Unfortunately our waiter was too busy so we seldom saw him and we couldn't ask him for Parmessan cheese before she was finished.  My youngest had the kids cheese pizza ($6), which was the size of a regular dinner plate - basically, adult size.  The pizza tasted like an Italian pizza margherita rather than your typical American cheese pizza, so she didn't like it.  I, however, did.  All the portions were large enough that we all took leftovers to our hotel (which fortunately has a kitchenette). Of course, the only reason why the kids were willing to go to the Cheesecake Factory was the name, so we went on to have cheesecake.  The HUGE slices were $7 each, very reasonable IMHO, but I come from a city where food is grossly overpriced.  I had the Adam's Peanut Butter fudge cheesecake, and I would not recommend it.  It was way too sweet to allow for any cheesecake flavor to filter through.  My oldest had the Dulce de Leche cheesecake, which she enjoyed.  I liked it more than mine because it was less sweet, but next time I'll go for the plain cheesecake.  My youngest had the kids hot fudge sundae ($2!).  It was a large enough portion that she couldn't finish it. In all, if you can deal with the wait and share dishes (or take the leftovers home for later), this seems like a good and reasonably priced place to dine in Vegas - no wonder there was such a huge wait!"
Stephanie F.,"Pottsville, PA",15,56,25,4.0,10/11/2011,"Yummy, huge portions, and fantastic service. It's a little pricey, but not too bad. The waitress brought us a special slice of wedding cheesecake adorned with candles. Very sweet."
Maggie L.,"Richmond, Canada",4,40,1,4.0,10/5/2011,"Dining in any restaurants in Ceasar are criminally over-priced just like anywhere else in vegas but not necessary good quality, unless you live on food court food.   However, the Cheese Cake factory in the Forum shop is actually a gem on the strip, providing if you are not looking for a fine dining experience. Price overall was very reasonable for a sitdown restaurant in Vegas.  Speed was efficient.  Service was considerably good.  Friendly & helpful staff.   Of the 7 days stay at Caesar for a conference, we had tried their paste, salmon special, some burger and fries, fish and chips, flat-bread  appetizer & pot sticker.   Ax the board, their food quality were consistent and were above and beyond other restaurants of the same franchise.  In fact, we liked their salmon lunch special (miso, simply grilled) so much that we went there almost every day we stayed there.  I am giving a 4 star for their location, and for $ value with respect to their overall food quality and services.  Would recommend for families and individuals on budget / biz trip."
Courtney J.,"Walnut, CA",7,301,693,1.0,8/28/2011,"The worse Cheesecake factory among the rest. This Las Vegas branch at the Forum is rock bottom lousy. It seem the management and kitchen team failed to know how to run business when it got busy!! Foods came in badly done!!  The team and management were incompetent to run a busy business during busy lunch hour!! I saw many guests were complaining about their order because the servers were removing their foods and bringing a new orders. The unfriendly manager was fed up that he had to visit all these ""complain tables"""
Nico S.,"Northridge, CA",0,5,1,2.0,7/16/2015,I'm usually used to having good service and eating good food the cheesecake factory. But this was a whole other experience. We walked up to the front desk and no one greeted us for five minutes when they were standing right there. There were five people standing there and they were just talking the among themselves. After we got greeted they said it be a 15 minute wait so we waited 15 minutes and we sat down. We ordered avocado portobello and zucchini sticks they were so salty it wasn't even funny. So then our food came and my son had ordered a cheeseburger medium that was raw. My wife had ordered potstickers that were also very salty. We even got a cheese pizza that was salty. But my sons chicken nuggets were bland. Unless you're craving salty foods don't come here.
Austin Z.,"Creve Coeur, MO",4,20,2,5.0,7/14/2014,"Amazing food, amazing restaurant, amazing service! Just outside of the restaurant there is a show that happens every hour or so which you can view from your seat. All in all  one of the better cheesecake factories."
Cherie C.,"Las Vegas, NV",68,165,8,4.0,3/14/2012,A fan of cheesecake and have never been here several times and have never been disappointed. Red Velvet is oh so yummy.  Food portions are Huge!  Menu is HUGE and could be very overwhelming to some which is why I stick to just the cheesecake
Karyle S.,"Flagstaff, AZ",2,26,6,4.0,6/23/2013,Food is really good but also really heavy. There is no way you can look good in a tube dress after eating here. The portions are always generous (even on the kids menu) so come hungry. Everything is yummy! Pastas can't be beat
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",119,374,19,5.0,9/7/2013,the food is consistent just like all the other Cheesecake Factory.  We had a late start so we had brunch.  I ordered the Mini Egg Breakfast $9 and fresh Orange Juice.  The food was good and the orange juice was full of pulp I had 2 glasses.
Bee N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,6,2,5.0,7/5/2014,OMG!!! This place is delicious!!!! My fave the California Cheese Steak with fries! Portions are super large...good luck having room for their awesome desserts!
Nathan G.,"Sneads Ferry, NC",1,9,,4.0,11/18/2013,"Well it is the same as everyother cheesecake factory in existence. Food was good, staff was friendly, and prices are reasonable. Only complaint is that the menu is almost as long as a bible."
Jeremy H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,4.0,12/12/2012,"I hesitate to give any place 5 stars, so I just went with 4 for now.  But that could change if things improve from last time I went.  I had gone twice previously and hadn't been overly impressed.  It seemed a little overpriced and the food just seemed to be slightly above average.  But we went this past weekend with some family and it was AMAZING.  I tried something that I normally would never get, which was the Cajun Jumbalaya Pasta, and it was incredible.  For an appetizer my wife and I shared the Avocado Egg Rolls, and they too were very good.  To drink I had a Typhoon Punch, which was really tasty.  My wife got the 4 cheese pasta, and she loved it. My only regret was I didn't save room for dessert.  Next time I will! Overall I'm not sure it's entirely worth what we paid (final total came out to $65, which was for 2 pasta orders, 1 appetizer, and my alcoholic drink), but I think we paid a little bit more than most Cheesecake Factory locations due to its location inside Caesar's Palace.  BUT, we will definitely be going again in the future."
Ana R.,"Downey, CA",212,40,71,5.0,8/9/2011,"Very nice service, beautiful atmosphere, and great food.  - Orange Chicken (lunch portion) - Chicken Madeira - Cuban Sandwhich"
Amy R.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,12,,5.0,3/30/2014,"Great place to eat, we had a party of 7, and had a 40 minute wait for a table. It was worth it, a bit on the noisy end but the food was excellent and so was the service!"
Shan R.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,49,81,4.0,2/10/2011,"After a meeting a coworker and I decided to stop here for lunch. The great thing is you can order from their small plates menu and share different foods. We had fried zucchini , blue cheese / pear flat bread, and then chicken wraps with a spicy sauce. This is a great way to nibble without going overboard. We were sat right away and had a great server. I was very happy with our service , our server had a sense of humor and was very outgoing ! We were tempted to have cheesecake , how can you come here and not do it ? So our server was kind enough to split one Strawberry cheesecake in half to serve to us. This was a great experience with great food , hands down."
PJ P.,"Vancouver, Canada",12,30,7,4.0,8/3/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory! It was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory and I was SO looking forward to having a heavenly slice of cheesecake.  Of course I was there for lunch so I had to order and actual meal before getting to dessert. The portions they give you here are MASSIVE!  Food quality was great, it was yummy and price point was good too. We had a hard time figuring out what we wanted as the menu features so many different options.  I ordered a slice of cheesecake to go and ate it in my hotel room. nomnomnom."
Corey H.,"San Diego, CA",396,489,101,4.0,3/7/2011,"In Vegas I kinda hoped it'd be all surreal and down the rabbit hole ish like the Chicago spot. But even though it's not, it's still sooooo good! Sarah and I split the Miso Salmon and had to punch ourselves in the face it was so good!"
Ralph T.,"Stateline, NV",14,438,28,3.0,10/9/2011,"Table wait sign up strange.  Give you a time to come back, for us 10 minutes and then we will seat you.  Came back got past the reception area but then waited another 10 minutes. Why not just have us come back in 20 minutes-oh well I guess it works for them. We had the small salad-not small at all. Good flavor on the dressing. White bean hummus.  Very large size for the price.  Served with Pita bread.  Good flavor and texture Four Seasons Pizza.  Good size for the price.  Served with four different sections-Mushroom, prosciutto, basil and artichoke.  Looked like they used slices of fresh mozzarella cheese too.   Excellent flavors mingled together.  I liked the thin crust.  Slightly chewy and cooked just right. Service was attentive."
Stephen F.,"Berea, KY",1,136,5,4.0,10/14/2013,"The food is solid 5 stars, the service however is 3 at the most. Therefore, we'll split the difference and give this location 4 stars. The place is huge, two stories in fact, so it could easily accommodate a crowd. Food was great with huge portions, but like I said earlier the service was slow and the waiter was not attentive at all."
Cloak D.,"Hanford, CA",0,45,5,5.0,4/17/2011,"Pros: AMAZING FOOD. Great view. Beautiful location. It's HUGE! Great waiters, the drinks tasted spectacular...want me to continue? Cons: People at the front desk were kinda rude. Maybe that's cause they were busy. Cloak Anecdote: People looked at me funny when I whipped out my giant DSLR+flash in the middle of the restaurant and started taking pictures of my food. Hey, I'm a photographer. Deal with it. I fell in love the moment I saw this Cheesecake Factory. It was huge, and glowing with purple...it was majestic.  We had to wait 15 minutes, but that was okay, cause I just went into Express while I waited and then I looked at the fishies swimming around. I went inside and was greeted by this host who was full of life and really brightened my day as he led me to my table (I was having a bad day up until that point).  The waiter was even better. He was super nice and accomodating. He refilled my drinks before I even realized my drink was gone.  He boxed up our food and everything-something not all CF waiters offer to do. And is it just me, or does the Coca-cola taste AMAZING?!?!  The food-oh my Caesar (bad pun). I ordered the garlic noodles and they were flour-y bundles of goodness soaked in garlic butter and garnished with large, luscious shrimp. If it wasn't for the fact that I stress-ate myself to oblivion in the previous hour I would've eaten it all and gained 2340398034975304 pounds(and that is not a hyperbole). My sister ordered the salad and loved it. It was seriously the BIGGEST salad I'd ever seen.Two huge mounds of salad adorned with ranch. Impressive. Would I go here again? The question is, WHEN will I go here again?"
