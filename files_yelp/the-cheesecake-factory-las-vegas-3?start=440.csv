R N.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,58,10,4.0,11/21/2013,"Always good avacado eggrolls, ice tea, and chicken teryaki. A good choice everytime. This location is busy but you can walk around after a meal.which is a plus."
Greg H.,"Aurora, CO",72,334,81,4.0,10/25/2010,"If you've ever been to a Cheesecake Factory, you know what to expect. If you don't, then this is for you. You can generally expect to have a good wait time to get into a seat because the food is awesome. Do not mistake this wait time for poor service because it's generally anything besides lacking.  At this one in particular, you can be seated on one of three floors or even out in the forum shops where you can watch the fish tanks and the robotic Atlantis show. It's in the middle of all the forum shop stores at a dead end, so you really have to want to get there to find it. It's worth every second. I stayed in Vegas for a week for a convention, ate here 5 times then, and still didn't have the same thing. They'll start by bringing you a little bread, and all of it is worth trying out and making sure that they've got more coming for you. The drinks that they'll offer are pretty varied, from general bar items to very specialty drinks, but sometimes the beer selection is lacking oddly enough. Appetizers are delicious and as you can expect to find throughout the entire menu, it's all over the place. You can get a dozen kinds of pizza or chicken or a delicious pasta for that matter.  The main event though is of course.....the cheesecakes. I try to order a different one each time that I've gone in, but I've been to different locations dozens of times, and I haven't eaten the same one twice yet.  Enjoy!"
Kevin P.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",566,864,156,4.0,3/28/2009,"Reminds me of home *sigh* they should use the slogan from Olive garden here because when I'm hear I feel like family. . .  It's like the family that when you see it you're really happy to see them, especially when they're less than $50 ;)  So if you're a homebody like me and can't afford to live the Vegas lifestyle of seafood and overpriced steak then head to where the home is, Cheesecake Factory. Enjoy."
Jennifer F.,"Los Angeles, CA",437,246,279,3.0,12/30/2010,"The restaurant appeared to be extremely crowded from the outside, but we were seated immediately. The restaurant turned out to be quite spacious inside! Service was decent and friendly. The dimmed lighting and private booths created a nice, cozy atmosphere which made our experience highly enjoyable.  We were presented with toasty garlic bread which we all loved. I tried quite a few entrees. I thought the pasta da vinci, garlic noodles, and chopped salsbury steak were all unimpressive, but the fettuccine Alfredo and Kobe beef burger were both very delicious! The fettuccine's creamy Parmesan sauce was very good, and the burger was a great value at just $12.99. Yum! For dessert we shared the Godiva chocolate brownie sundae and the glazed strawberry cheesecake. Creamy and dreamy, both were very good! This restaurant offers quality food and lovely ambiance at a very affordable price. Quite an ideal venue for a romantic date or special dinner with family or friends!  My only gripe was that the silverware was extremely dirty! I could literally wipe white film from my spoon and pick cookie crumbs from my fork... However, our server was nice enough to bring us new utensils AND wipe them down at our table for us, ha."
Maria T.,"Orange County, CA",56,269,130,3.0,2/10/2015,"This place was crowded, so we just got a drink to-go. Service was fine and prices were consistent with other Cheesecake Factories."
Doug H.,"Sandy, UT",30,42,10,5.0,2/29/2012,"Best place to eat on the strip.  Great ambiance with the Atlantis show in the middle of the forum shops.  Great service, Great portions! I will be stopping here each year when we visit Vegas."
Donald K.,"San Francisco, CA",20,12,18,4.0,10/2/2012,"Great food. The lunch portions are huge. If you want dessert, you may need to share an entree."
Shayda G.,"Las Vegas, NV",242,225,52,4.0,11/16/2012,"Walking through Cesars Palace we stumbled up Cheesecake Factory.  Was disappointed at first when we were seated upstairs in a small table right next to the kitchen doors where there was foot traffic galore.  We spotted an open booth and they happily moved us.  Thank gosh because it was probably the most awkward place to sit especially on a first date!  Whatever you are looking for, Cheesecake Factory has it.  I become impressed with menus that have options for a lower calorie meal, although 600 calories doesnt seem that low to me!  I ordered the healthy delight salmon with veggies.  I could have finished the entire thing but didn't want to look like a piglet! It was pretty great!  I was very pleased when in the mixed veggies a little bit of squash and eggplant was mixed in, it wasn't your basic green beans and carrots.  Although, there was green beans and carrots!  But it was all so good!  Service was very kind, prompt, although I had to ask 3 times for a straw and still never received one!   The wait on a Friday night wasn't long, I think we got there at a good time because it was packed!"
Michelle F.,"Schaumburg, IL",174,722,1961,5.0,5/23/2011,"I have nothing bad to say about this Cheesecake Factory!!  We came here because we were meeting friends from Germany, and they don't have any Cheesecake Factories there (sucks to be them!!!) so they wanted to meet up at one here.  Fine by me!! We met friends here for dinner at 8 on a Sunday night.  There was about a 10 minute wait, if that.  They seated us even though all of our party wasn't there--two of them were on European time.  It gave us plenty of time to enjoy our first round of drinks and to peruse the 87 page menu (only a slight exaggeration). Our waitress was extremely patient and accomodating considering we were there for over 2 hours.  She was extremely attentive and kept asking us if we needed refills on anything and was great with the suggestions when we were debating about what to get. My husband got some sort of amazing breakfast burrito that was twice the size of his head.  And he ate every bite of it, too (minus what I stole!)  My friend and I split the tuna carpaccio and the bang bang shrimp.  I also ordered a delicious side salad when their house dressing.  AMAZING. Overall, it was a great experience, and I would definitely go again!"
Laura B.,"Enfield, CT",0,2,,2.0,3/6/2015,"The cheesecake factory has always been my favorite restaurant. I have been to them pretty much everywhere around the states. Well, the one here in Vegas at Caesar's Palace wasn't the best experience. Fist off the hostess had an attitude. Second, the waiter seemed to be annoyed that we arrived at 10:30pm when they don't close until 11:30pm. I guess he wanted to get out early?? He didn't bring bread, our food came and we had to ask for bread. He didn't bring water, so we had to ask for water. Never came to check on us except to see if we needed to go boxes. Just a bad experience."
Billy W.,"Ayden, NC",22,108,37,5.0,4/20/2011,"Awesome service, food and prices! That's all you need."
Nancy O.,"Scottsdale, AZ",25,30,6,5.0,11/22/2013,We didn't have to wait long even on a busy Friday. The food was good and the service was great!
Zak M.,"Corona, CA",3,171,16,3.0,6/14/2015,"location i guess a positive point.Rest all are fine, nothing special."
Shanette T.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,20,2,5.0,1/19/2015,"I live in Las Vegas, and being at The forum shops is last on my list, but since my daughter works in one of the fashion outlets, I pick and drop her off quite often, one day I decide to hit up The Cheesecake Factory, with it's long list of customers waiting to dine, if you don't mind eating at the bar, then there is absolutely no waiting! And the service was fast and the bartender was very pleasant and attentive. I work in a fine dinning restaurant with great food, but this one appetizer dish I tried along with the lunch portion Chinese Chicken salad was to die for! The Avocado egg rolls were delicious!!!!!! They have sun dried tomato and plenty avocado in them, and to go along with it, is the sweet cilantro dipping sauce. So far I've gone there 3 times in the last month in a half. This is a must try, if you don't eat meat and love avocados. Of course they have a long list of different cheesecakes, I always stick to strawberry cheesecake. Yum!"
Katherine S.,"Las Vegas, NV",36,76,7,3.0,7/10/2011,"We were lucky to have a 10-min wait time, there's  so many people it can be intimidating... Four Cheese Pasta is so delicious, I've never drooled over such a simple dish. Our waitress was nice and we didn't get mad about waiting to be served since she was trying her best to navigate to other tables. I have no complaints, everything was great. The only downside I can mention is the wait time and occupancy number. It's -very- crowded."
Kari D.,"Camp Verde, AZ",49,92,,3.0,10/21/2010,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory.  We shared the sliders, and guacamole. Sliders were good. The guac. was very bland, and had little more than moshed avocados.  We shared a piece of cheesecake, the oreo. That was the best part of the meal.  The menu is overwhelming IMO. Way to many choices."
Mary C.,"Salem, OR",4,2,,4.0,1/5/2014,"Excellent food and service! My only objection was that we were a party of 2 and a party of 2 that came in after us was seated before we were. But, the wait time for a table was 5 to 10 minutes. I was in Las Vegas for 8 days and I have to say that was the quickest we got into any restaurant on the strip. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure our drinks were kept full. The atmosphere is beautiful but it is rather loud. We happen to get there when the Atlantis show was going on which made it even louder. The food was excellent. It was hot, great tasting and plenty of it. I left full and with a doggy bag. I spent close to the same amount I spent at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill that I only got three tiny sliders and ail at. Here I had appetizers, main course and desert. I would highly recommend here and would dine here again."
Severiana S.,"Lakewood, CA",116,34,5,4.0,6/19/2010,"OMG! So I have to say that one of my biggest weaknesses is cheesecake!!!! So of course I had to eat at the factory!  I went to this place a lot when I was smaller, but I wasn't judging the food at that age.  My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary while in Vegas. It was kind of a weird situation. We waiting a long time for a table since this place doesn't take reservations (bummer!) Then we sat next these 2 women who were arguing with each other at the table! I am not sure of they were friends or mother and daughter???  We ordered the Factory chopped salad that is tossed with a balsamic dressing. The salad has apples, bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, and a bunch of other yummy veggies that tie in with the dressing beautifully! As we were enjoying the salad, the two woman finished their argument and began a conversation with us! They started to recommend dishes that they like there and then were talking smack on other dishes, including the salad that we loved at this point! Anyways, they recommended the Chicken Piccatta and it was a hit with us! But watch out for the portion size! We were able to split the dish and still had a little left over. The chicken is cooked with a white sauce and capers...but we requested that the capers be left out ( I am not a fan). It comes with a size of pasta that compliments the chicken well.  And for dessert, of course cheesecake! They have so many to choose from!!!! how can one make that decision??!! A few of my favs from there: The chocolate mousse cheesecake, the carrot cake cheesecake, the original flavor, and the tuxedo. You can also get the original flavor and there is a variety of fruit toppings that you can have added if you choose.  All in all, this place rocks! They have a huge menu of entree items and the same size menu for the cheesecake! The service is really good but it is a very noisy restaurant, so if you are a looking for a quiet environment, this is not the place. The entrees are decently priced for the amount of food that you get. The cheesecake can be a little pricey ($6.95 a slice for most), but its soooooo worth it!  If I could change one thing, I would have them start taking reservations!  I will be back for many years to come! Enjoy all!"
Paul M.,"St John's, Canada",38,28,8,3.0,10/16/2012,"Been to many Cheesecake Factories before but not as impressed with this one. More than likely due to the poor seats we had.(avoid the tables next to the entrance. People who have been sweating in the Las Vegas heat all day line up and sit on the rail next to your face while you eat....). Food was as expected...too much but good. It was very hot and humid outside of the restaurant, next time I will ask to be seated inside. Our waiter very good and friendly. Really liked the Avocado Spring Rolls."
Ameerah A.,"San Francisco, CA",235,142,44,4.0,8/6/2008,"Went here on National Cheesecake day and had a good meal. My calamari wasn't chewy, it was perfect! But it did come with some strange dipping sauces...The green tea I had was awesome, and my dining partner for the evening enjoyed their meal as well. The cheesecake was a little too sweet for my taste, but it was only 1.50, so I had no right to even complain.  I then came back to this same restaurant on Friday and only had a Mojito and a little bit of salad and some of the jambalaya pasta dish. All where extremely yummy, and the wait staff wasted no time clearing off our table after we got up. I lost my Fat Tuesday cup here [sheds a tear]. But hey, at least they're keen and quick on the cleaning. I can't remember the courtesy of the wait staff but I'm sure they were nice, otherwise I would have noticed it. Oh! And the restrooms were upstairs, I wasn't much of a fan of that, stairs and being tipsy don't mix, take the elevator!"
