Jasmine T.,"Burnaby, Canada",66,366,95,3.0,3/23/2011,"We wanted to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday while in Vegas. Hmm, where will they sing to her? So even though I stuffed myself to the gills at the Village Buffet, we decided to surprise my friend for her birthday because that's how you show people you love them. We came at an off time, so there wasn't a wait. We sat upstairs (there is an elevator beside the staircase) at a round table in the corner. Hmm, what to eat when you don't want to eat? My friends ordered a bunch of appies, but I wanted to eat some veggies... lunch special sized Cobb Salad it is. When they dropped off the bread, everyone pounced. Ahh, I love the soft, warm bread with butter... I didn't really need to eat anymore. The cobb salad is all mixed up instead of being a composed salad. It was very well mixed with an appropriate amount of dressing... not too little, not too much... just right. I love bacon... I love bacon with blue cheese... I love bacon with blue cheese and lettuce... this salad was huge, so I only finished like half. I would have taken it back to the hotel, but in a city of excess, I figured I would just find food someplace else... and I'm glad I did because I think our fridge was broken. The slice of red velvet cheesecake we took back did not fare so well... and melted. I almost cried. Our server was so nice and even though she disappeared for a while, she remembered to bring a candle and brought some other to sing to my friend. We always have a nice time at all the Cheesecake Factory restaurants... always so consistent."
Allie L.,"Columbus, OH",186,194,19,5.0,3/23/2011,"I wish I could give this Cheesecake Factory 10 stars.  Here's why: my sister can't have gluten or black pepper. Yep, I know. That sucks. BUT, this Cheesecake Factory made that issue 100x easier. Their management came by our table and showed my sister exactly what she could eat and what they could substitute/take out. If they didn't know, they would contact the chef.  THAT. IS. AWESOME.  And they didn't ever make my sister feel bad or show any signs of irritation when she had questions.  Also, everyone at our table loved what they ordered. BRAVO."
greg l.,"San Francisco, CA",10,1,,1.0,1/8/2013,Food was OK nothing special. The service was awful.  Host told us it was a 20 minute   wait.  We're still waiting to get a table an hour latter.
Francine G.,"Las Vegas, NV",180,204,666,3.0,10/12/2010,"Love the cheesecakes but not so much the food. Since I can't eat a whole lot of sweets I mainly order the Thai Lettuce Wraps, it's probably the best thing on the menu besides the dessert.  You would think Thai Lettuce Wraps is hard to mess up on, but sadly they burnt my chicken. It was a total disappointment for me! As for the pastas they are A-O-K; the Cajun jambalaya is probably the best one. Made to perfection! Most of the other pastas seem to be dry (lack of sauce).  Best part of all DESSERT! I love the red velvet cheesecake, so if you haven't tried it yet I would definitely try it.  As for service, not the best, the server forgot a lot of things and would disappear out of no where when I needed him. Not only did he forget to get my drink but he messed up on other peoples order."
Julie N.,"North Platte, NE",11,100,80,2.0,5/17/2013,I have been to many cheesecake factories but this one was very disappointing. The way the hostess keeps track of customers and the random order of being seated was rude. The only thing I liked was their new skinnylicious menu and our waiter. Recommend skipping this location.
Kim T.,"Orange County, CA",1156,1046,2847,3.0,7/14/2010,"Same menu, service, etc. as any other Cheesecake Factory throughout the nation.  The only difference is that it's right next to that show that goes on in the Forum Shops with the fire and mechanically animated statues.  It was loud, hot, and annoying.  It freaked me out and we couldn't carry on a conversation for the 15 minutes that it was on.  My suggestion, if you eat here, is to sit inside to avoid the distraction of this show near the restaurant."
Kristen R.,"Kingwood, TX",96,32,,5.0,10/27/2012,I am a Cheesecake Factory fan so this is easy for me.  This one is in the back of the mall (Forum shops) at Cesar's Palace.  I just discovered the buffalo blasts (appetizer) ... You MUST try these!!!  YUMMY!  Solid service and a very consistent menu. Thanks CF!
Andrew V.,"San Francisco, CA",84,268,259,4.0,6/10/2013,Delicious mall food in a great location!! Always a good choice
Roma M.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",241,439,157,4.0,8/15/2010,"This is one of the more reliable restaurants to visit when in LV. Sure, it's kind of tired, seeing as there is one in almost every state, but that's what makes it a must visit since the majority of restaurants on the strip are either a vat of food-poisoning or very overpriced.  In terms of service this place is almost always busy, so you might not get the service you'd like, and it's also not the best CF I've been to, but it's on my top ten list for LV."
M. D.,"Essexville, MI",0,6,,5.0,1/17/2015,"Have never had a bad meal at any Cheesecake Factory and this one was no different. We were there on November 28 for a late lunch. We had no wait time. We received excellent service and the portions were large. Their bread basket is a great start. We shared their Asian or Oriental Chicken Salad, the Artichoke Appetizer and each got a piece of huge cheesecake (of course!) The food was delicious and the Cheesecake was sinfully rich. Loved every minute of it!  I would recommend them and  go again."
Julia P.,"Florence, KY",64,37,13,5.0,6/30/2013,Pleasantly surprised.  We expected it to take two hours & we were out the door in an hour.They keep things moving.  Order an appetizer and save room for dessert.  The cheesecake slices are big enough to share. Food is always up to pâté of what we expect.
Kisente F.,"Philadelphia, PA",47,111,61,4.0,4/16/2013,"This is my first Cheesecake Factory. There's a show that involves moving sculptures right outside that runs at an increment amount of time. Anyways, I just found out this restaurant serves more than just cheesecakes. But, it didn't matter because I just come here to try out their amazing different types of chessecakes."
Crystal H.,"Milpitas, CA",109,838,1224,4.0,8/6/2008,"my bf and i were seated right away when we came here around 6pm. I had the Evelyn's pasta, which wasn't very good. It was on the light side, so I didn't enjoy it. My bf got some pasta with bacon, peas, and a creamy sauce, which was very good. We had two alcoholic ice cream drinks called caramel twister and kahlua kisser were both strong. I liked the sticky caramel though. The drinks were are about $8.50. Our bill was $40+. I really liked the strawberry creamsicle alcohol drink back at the one in san jose, CA. It has no alcoholic taste, but i guess its vegas, so they hook it up."
Caroline J.,"Henderson, NV",182,119,42,4.0,3/19/2012,"In general, I try to avoid chain restaurants because if it is a chain I can eat their food all throughout the country. Also, I have seen Cheesecake Factory's gluten free menu and it contained close to nothing for me to eat without morphing the dish into something remarkably healthy (no sauce, dressing, fries, etc). Now, there are times that I want to be healthy, but that's why I cook at home, not when I go to a restaurant called CHEESECAKE Factory. Therefore, my fiance have avoided this restaurant in Caesar's until St. Patrick's Day when friends wanted something familiar to eat. First, the hostess desk was on top of their game. I got a piece of paper with my approximate waiting time and the time I checked into the desk. They took my phone number to call me when my table was ready which is GENIUS in Vegas. We stayed within the casino, so when they called we came running and the table was ready. Service? It was actually pretty good. I didn't walk away wow-ed by the service, but it was good. Our waters were almost always full, my friends got refills on the bread, butter and alcoholic drinks relatively fast and all went okay. The server split our bills with the greatest of ease since we told him at the beginning of the meal we'd prefer split bills. CF gets the extra 1 star for the host desk organization and service alone. Yes, this menu is impressive. Salads, pizzas, Chinese, Italian and of course, massive amounts of cheesecake. I looked through the menu and saw the plethora of carb-tastic happiness. I saw a stack of onion straws go by me and I remembered my days of gluten-ingesting intestinal pain. However, I think that stack of onion straws, the flatbread and the pasta could absolutely be worth it. The menu for you gluten-lovers is great. Somewhat predictable, but great.  My friends eating gluten all loved their food! My fiance got a basic burger, another got the Steak Diane, one got the Kobe burger with American cheese (wrong cheese, but moving forward) and the last guy got the Mac and Cheese burger. I ordered the safest item on the menu for someone that is gluten free which is the lemon and herb chicken with mashed potatoes. It seemed safe at the time, and even though I wasn't starving, I didn't want to be ill for the rest of the night.  Nobody complained about their food. Everyone said it was great and that they were completely satisfied with their meals. The fries looked pretty standard. I expected a little more pizazz with their fries since everything else was so extravagant, but they were simple. The burgers did not look appealing to me, and I love beef, but then again, everyone except my fiance ordered their cow medium and that hurts my heart. My chicken? Hands down some of the best chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. The best thing? There were bones in the chicken, but the large ones were removed and the chicken came right off the bone. Don't even get me started on the magic wonder of the lemon butter sauce. I could have clogged my arteries with more of that sauce any day. I didn't get sick from the restaurant, and that chicken may pull me back one of these days. Please feel free to take away the red mashed potatoes which were okay, but nothing exciting and almost didn't deserve to be on the plate with that butter and chicken. Replace the potatoes with more chicken and we're good. I know this one was long, but I like to approach a meal from all different angles. I wanted to give this restaurant 3 stars because for me, the GF options were severely lacking for a major chain restaurant, but what I did eat was great and the restaurant organization was on-point. If you want something that's not specifically Vegas but reliable and perfect for picky eaters, come to Cheesecake Factory and you'll be happy with your choice."
Mike C.,"Long Beach, CA",743,435,731,4.0,9/26/2010,This place gets 4 stars in my book.  Ive been meaning to review this place and now two years later I have finally gotten around to it.  The place was definitely busy as described in most reviews.  The server was quite friendly and checked back frequently to top up our drinks.  You would think that is standard but you would be surprised the lack of service you get going to some places.  The food was on point and consistent with the quality of Cheesecake Factory food.  Definitely enjoyed the experience dining here. Id come back.
Elysia E.,"Las Vegas, NV",84,32,18,4.0,3/31/2010,"This is a great location. Everytime I have been here either it be for dinner take out or just drinks the food and the staff have never let me down.  They are always super busy but you usually don't wait long to get in. The staff makes sure your taken care of, the only time I've had to really wait was when paying the bill. They could use more registers but that's such a small thing.  Next time you go get the fried chicken sliders. Especially if your not that hungry because we all know how big those Cheesecake Factory portions are. You get 4 and they are SOOOO good. The bartenders here are super friendly and make great recommendations. I wish  I could remember that one guys name because he is the best!"
Chase A.,"Provo, UT",1,99,14,4.0,7/28/2010,"I hate CF because my wife (and most women) hype it. Drives me nuts. The reality is, most things vie had there are very good.  While on our anniversary trip we ate there twice in one day - not by choice.  The appetizer with the corn cakes - very good! We also had some salmon wraps on a bed of cabbage. It was very good! The next meal (same day) I ordered the spicy chicken stuffed tortillas - or something like that. It was very good also. My wife got salads both times and loved each of them."
Jacob M.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,225,22,4.0,9/13/2010,"Like other reviewers, I am not necessarily a fan of the chain restaurant. Particularly in Las Vegas when there are so many other great choices of places to eat. That being said, I had my 3rd ever experience at any Cheesecake Factory recently as I was joining some of my wife's colleagues for a pre-show dinner before we were to go see Cher. The place was hopping, but looked very large. My first impression of this location was great! The staff were very friendly, and despite not having a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend, our party of 8 was able to be seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Our waiter was excellent. Most of us were either CCF newbies or seldom diners and we were all full of questions about drinks or menu items. Our waiter was very patient, helpful and humorous. I had quite a few questions about the veggie friendly items, and he was very good at answering my questions. As far as the food and drink. I was happy to find a couple microbrews on the menu, and I opted for the Hefe. The rest of our party enjoyed one of the many cocktails that the CCF offers. All of our drinks came out at the same time, and only after about 5 minutes after we ordered. I ordered the nachos minus the meat and edamame, and most of the table also ordered apps. The portion sizes on these apps was massive, and we probably could have only ordered 4 for the entire table. I was able to conquer about 1/2 the nachos and had significant help with the edamame. Our service was quick, which we needed since we had a show at 7:30pm. Our check came fast (but not too fast) and was worked out very quickly.  Overall, it was a great experience. Our bill was actually very reasonable especially noting how much food we got. The service was great and the location perfect for what we needed. I probably won't be a CCF regular, but I will definitely be open to dining there again. My only concern was that gratuity was not added to our bill (even though we had 8 people) which was different than I am used to seeing. That could be a problem for people who don't look too closely at their bill."
Tiffany T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,5.0,8/11/2013,Long wait but was worth it. Had fetticini Alfredo and strawberry smoothie. It was all good. Worth the time and cash.
david h.,"Longview, TX",2,387,,4.0,10/28/2010,"Believe it or not, this was my first time to go to a Cheesecake Factory. Don't know what I was waiting on. If all of them are as good as the one in Caesars Palace, then I've got a standby in every Metropolitan city in the country. This place is good. The menu is gigantic, bordering on overwhelming. Most of the food was outstanding. My Salsbury steak was deluged with sage (not my favorite spice). That was about my only knock on the food. If only I had oredred one of the other 1400 items on the menu. The service was nice and attentive. They gave me extra stuffed mushrooms because my first order, they said, had 5 instead of the prescribed 6. Nice touch! I would have never known what the correct number of mushrooms were.  The setting was cavernous but it worked. Smiley face and half a star."
