Elmer J.,"Little Rock, AR",46,44,267,4.0,8/17/2010,"This is my favorite place to eat at. Every time we go on a vacation we always look for this place. The atmosphere is very nice and service is okay depending on location. This  is located at the end of Forum Shops at  Caesar Palace (where the animatronic show  begins every hour).  They have at least 18 pages (including a whole page of cheesecakes to choose from) on the menu with a variety of items to choose from. The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful in choosing the item she recommend. My mom and I both ordered Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane ($19.95 each)  and ordered caesar salad ($3 each). Our waiter brings our salad and  bread to our table. While I enjoyed the bread (especially the wheat bread) I didn't enjoy the caesar salad. The lettuce had bitter taste to it and the salad did not come with anything ( ex: cheese, onions, tomato,etc) that should be on it. I will say the ranch was delicious. About 30 mins later our waiter brought our entrees to our table.  The steak I had was tender and delicious and  the chicken Madeira  with cheese was average. My mom thought her food was good also.  For dessert, I ordered the original cheesecake which was yummy! This place get pretty pricey ($60 was the check for  two of us) but was worth every penny. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas or when I'm  nearby one and would recommend those who haven't dine here to check this place out. It's something for everyone!!"
Ricky M.,"San Francisco, CA",10,116,,4.0,12/23/2010,"I been to a few different Cheesecake Factory and this ranks probably at the top.  Not only did they seat up near the fish tank (trust me...this helps when you have two kids), they cut the bread and banana in small pieces for my kids while we waited for the entrees.  I had the chicken piccata which was awesome...highly recommended. We even got to watch the Caesars statue show while dining."
KD S.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,174,32,4.0,11/15/2011,good food came here while waiting for something at the apple store one of my monthly  favorite places to come to fan of everything-drinks on point
Ali C.,"Phoenix, AZ",115,64,3,4.0,7/22/2010,"We ended up here twice in our Vegas stay. They are open to mixing up the menu a bit (adding, subtracting things) The servers kept our drinks up. The food came out hot. Our dinner was fantastic.  On our lunch there, our server was somewhat non-existent,  and our food was eh. My alfredo came out rather watery, and broccoli undercooked, but it was okay.  Which is why this review got 4 stars instead of 5."
Lin L.,"Fort Worth, TX",266,137,71,4.0,5/9/2010,"buffet its too heavy for me sometimes in Vegas, so I come to this cheesecake factory almost every time I'm in Vegas. I love how you're sitting outside but its actually not outside. the food is amazing & service is great. I'm always willing to try new things, & the server always gives me great recommendations. Red velvet cheesecake for desert is a must for me.. the best part, I can walk around the forum shops in ceasar palace, that helps me to digest LOL .."
Danielle O.,"Henderson, NV",5,94,16,3.0,6/25/2014,"my husband is a picky eater and he loved his meal, chicken and biscuits or something like that... although the server did not allow him to get a beer becaus he didn't have i.d. although he is clearly over 30, and the restaurant was pretty noisy based on the servers/bussers clanging dishes/silverware very loud while cleaning tables, but the food was pretty good and the service was prompt."
Joe O.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",132,80,149,3.0,6/11/2012,"I like the Cheesecake Factory and am impressed that this one does not have the exorbitant prices that I expected for a hotel restaurant in Caesar's.  The food, service, ambiance and prices were all A-OK.  Thus - 3 stars.."
Kristen B.,"Washington, DC",319,594,386,3.0,4/26/2010,"I ate here with a group of 6 while visiting Las Vegas. We had a late lunch so it wasn't very crowded. Our server was great -- very attentive and prompt. My boyfriend and I shared the chipotle chicken pasta and it was definitely big enough for two. Our friends all ordered cheesecake that looked amazing. Try to get a seat inside to cut down on some of the noise from ""The Fall of Atlantis"" fountain show that happens every so often outside in the Forum Shops."
Brad A.,"Seattle, WA",35,238,,2.0,9/16/2010,"DID YOU KNOW ALL THE CHEESECAKE FACTORIES ARE THE SAME?   I have been to a few of them, and this one was like the others.  If you like one where ever you are, then you'll like this one.   SERVICE:   The wait is long if you go around dinner time.  We waited, gambled, and drank to get a buzz and went later than 9:00 p.m.   So, we got seated fairly quickly.  The service...nothing special...it's what you'd expect at any Cheesecake Factory restaurant.   FOOD QUALITY:   The food was okay.  It was, as I said earlier, like any other Cheesecake Factory on the planet.   WOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?:  Probably not."
Julie H.,"West Covina, CA",73,80,53,5.0,5/20/2012,"Fantastic food!! From the Skinny Menu I tried the margarita on the rocks which was terrific & the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, which I loved. It was very flavorful and delicious. I have never been disappointed at Cheesecake Factory, you can not go wrong with anything you choose!"
Mark C.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,67,13,5.0,6/21/2012,"My first time eating at ""the cheesecake factory"", at our surprise we where greeted professionally by the host. Server quickly made sure our wait time didn't surpass 5 mins. We asked for recommendations on a three course meal.. Tex Mex Egg rolls.. Miso salmon.. Hibachi steak.. White chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheese cake.. Quality, Presentation and Tasteful made the best of it.. We also had a little mix with rice preference but the server quickly made a correction.. That's what you call quality service.."
Shanda J.,"Marysville, WA",4,45,13,5.0,5/30/2012,"Amazing food, amazing service, and the Lemonicello cake is probably the best thing I've ever eaten.  And trust me, I've eaten A LOT."
Julie P.,"Lowell, MA",5,92,38,5.0,7/16/2012,First time ever at a Cheesecake Factory. We loved it. The menu is intimidating due to sheer volume of choices but we ordered three different dishes and all were very good. Will go back to Cheesecake Factory. P.S. We even had leftovers.
Jay J.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,60,,5.0,4/18/2012,Probably my best dining experience in my young life.  I got the cajun pasta and it was sooooooooo amazing.  The service was awesome and the decor made me feel like I was living the life.  No better way to eat after a Day party in the burning hot sun.  The one downfall is how far of a walk it was but I got over that quickly once I tasted my food.  The cheesecake with macadamia I ordered was nothing less than delicious!
S C.,"Modesto, CA",9,94,29,4.0,2/27/2012,"Had the combo pizza, it was super yummy and cooked just right! Save room for cheesecake. Hubby and I shared the Snickers cheesecake and it was fluffy and not TOO sweet."
Marc W.,"St Albans, United Kingdom",8,22,9,4.0,5/1/2010,"Located deep inside the Forum shopping Arcade in Caesars Palace this place is always a more casual dining treat for us that never disappoints; If only becau of the amusement at the size of the portions!  The menu is immense, the service efficient and the atmosphere lively.  The dishes are too numerous and eclectic to recumbent anything specific, but I would recommend you don't have both an app and main course (I promise you, it will be far too much food!), choose one or the other and save yourself for a cheesecake.  Don't expect haute cuisine, just generously portioned indulgence!"
Freddie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,1,4.0,7/24/2012,"Awesome prices for awesome portions!!! The menu is huge! I've been eating here for years and never experienced bad service or bad food! The Bistro Rock Shrimp pasta is very tasty, Fish Tacos are filling, Jambalaya Pasta is one of the best, Tex Mex rolls are delicious!!!! The whole menu which is like a bible is wonderfully appetizing!!!! Lines are long get there early for dinner!!!"
Erika W.,"Arlington, VA",55,83,12,3.0,4/23/2012,"I've been to many a Cheesecake Factory, and this one was no different... And that's a good thing! We went here for lunch, while walking the strip.  The food and service are on par, and you can't beat sitting on the ""Patio"" and watching the fish and tourists walk by.  You even get some romantic mood lighting and action brought to you in part by the ""Neptune, King of the Ocean"" Show playing sporadically throughout  your meal.  We got a kick out of this.  I always love the Santa Fe avocado rolls and the Chinese Chicken salad... Sometimes it's good just to go for something you like, and save the ""adventurous eating"" for dinner that night."
Veronica V.,"Palmdale, CA",0,11,5,5.0,8/27/2011,"Excellent service, excellent food and the cheesecake is to die for!!! Try the meatloaf."
