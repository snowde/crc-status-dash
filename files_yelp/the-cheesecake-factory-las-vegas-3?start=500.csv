V E.,"Santa Fe, NM",0,40,6,5.0,5/9/2014,"I recently made my visit to Las Vegas, Nevada. In the past I have always made my visits to the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered their ""chicken picata entree"" which was awesome, it consisted of lemon flavored chicken (mixed/ cooked with other high quality ingredients) and angel hair pasta. The majority of their menu is outstanding to choose from however it matters most of what you are in the mood for or ask the server to give you the best ideal selections. The customer service is stellar as well as the prices (not too steep). For the service and the food quality this place usually tops/ does better than the other 5 star rating restaurants within the Vegas strip and you wont over spend your money. The location is inside the Caesar's palace mall (forum shops) nearby the aquarium. Again they usually do a great job getting you situated upon arrival however I usually visit them during the middle of the week."
Joe B.,"Oakland, CA",410,729,54,3.0,2/14/2009,"Jack of all trades, master of none.  I have to commend The Cheesecake Factory for offering up meals that will appeal to anyone, but aren't really outstanding.  I had a vegetarian pasta that, while very tasty, made me feel like it expanded to about twice its' normal size in my belly about a half hour later.  Not a good feeling . . . The avocado egg rolls were very welcome to two Californians on vacation but needing their avocado fix, but they were a little salty. So, if you're in a diverse group that's hard to please, it might be worth the stop, or if you want a meal with a cheesecake dessert, then obviously this is a great choice, but for true culinary satisfaction, keep on' truckin . . ."
Eve J.,"Torrance, CA",3,46,,5.0,6/18/2012,I love the Cheesecake Factory. Went here for my birthday weekend in Vegas. While we waited for a table there was a Bath & Body that had great deals. I was able to pick up some Christmas gifts and Birthday gifts. I had the bbq chicken salad which was great. We didnt have room for desert.
Heather C.,"North Pole, AK",0,3,,5.0,10/27/2010,Excellent service. Fantastic food. My husband and I ended up eating here twice due to how good everything was and for a reasonable price. I highly recommended it! Try the made to order guacamole. Yum!!!  On a side note do NOT go to the Planet Hollywood restaurant in the same mall. It's aweful!!!
Chris O.,"Portland, OR",590,1676,261,4.0,11/19/2009,"I was getting really tired of the overpriced ho hum food in vegas, everything tries to be fancy and special but I knew that I could come home to the SF bay area and pay half as much for something better. But the Cheesecake factory was a very good deal for Vegas food. It's just as good as the others I have been to and the prices are very fair, especially for lunch. If it was closer to where we were staying at I would have ate there everyday."
David H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,29,6,4.0,4/20/2014,Amazing hospitality from the entire staff. From the hosts to the bussers everyone made our experience wonderful. Even the manager stopped by to check on us. Can't say enough nice things about this place. Save room for cheesecake!
Jesse K.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,143,5,4.0,7/4/2011,Standard cheesecake factory restaurant with typically extra long wait because of the location and the prices tend to be a little higher then usual also due to the fact that it is located I. The heart of Caesars Palace.
Saquoia L.,"Las Vegas, NV",66,17,,4.0,3/17/2011,"I only been to the Cheescake Factory once. It's definitely somewhere I would go again. Normally I steer clear of expensive restaurants, especially the one's near the strip. I don't care whose paying, im just not into spending $45 on a plate of food. I dont' care how nice or sexy the waiter is. I went here with a friend on Thanksgiving because neither one of us can cook lol. I didn't order anything but a cheescake. From what I can tell the food isn't all that bad, it's also not toooo pricey like I expected it to be. I would definetly want someone to take me here on a date. :)"
Alvaro G.,"Buckeye, AZ",1,22,,4.0,6/21/2011,"When in Vegas, I absolutely have to come here!  My experience here has always been enjoyable. Cheesescake Factory has an all time favorite dish of mine... The Bang Bang-Chicken and Shrimp(AyMayZinG!!) The combination of Coconut Curry with Chicken and Shrimp over a bed of rice... delicious! I have had my share of curry dishes, but none beat this one(pretty much the only reason I come here). Oh..and the Thai Wraps get a well deserved Thumbs Up!"
Feifei X.,"Palo Alto, CA",206,26,20,4.0,11/26/2009,"Ups and Downs! Our party of six was seated in less than 10 minutes.  WIN! We weren't assigned a waiter and had menus but no beverages for 20 minutes.  FAIL! We were really happy off of mai tais and margaritas they let us bring into the restaurant.  WIN! We tagged 2 waiters and the second one brushed us off with, ""Oh, they'll be with you soon.""  FAIL! The manager found us and genuinely and thoroughly apologized, and offered to comp our desserts.  MEGAWIN! We were assigned the second waiter that gave us the bullshit answer.  PWNAGE! Ordered buffalo wings which were a perfect match of spicy and sour, and spinach+artichoke dip that came with chips instead of bread as usual.  WIN! The 5 desserts we tried: - Peanut Butter Cheesecake: Very very heavy.  Tastes like sugared up peanut butter and not for the weak of heart. - Carrot Cake: Very classic, hard to go wrong but not spectacular.  Desserts are obviously overpriced at TCF but they don't skimp you.  Calorie for calorie you get what you pay for and the cakes are all a couple inches taller than the cheesecakes. - Oreo Cheesecake: Not bad, hard to go wrong. - Red Velvet Cheesecake: OMG sooooo good.  This was an unexpected combination for me.  The only thing I can think of is that the amount of cream cheese frosting can be overwhelming but other than that it's a really yummy dessert. - Bowl of Fresh Strawberries: For $6.50 you get 10-15 strawberries.  Scam!  But for free it was a good combo with each of the cheesecakes.  If you have money to blow I would highly recommend getting this with any cheesecake order."
Martin G.,"South San Francisco, CA",307,198,17,3.0,6/3/2010,"Located inside the Forum shopping Arcade in Caesars Palace this place is always a more casual dining treat. Everytime we have gone to Vegas the wait is usally about 20 minutes but with the fish tank outsaide and the laser light show it helps kill time!!!  The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory. The staff makes sure your taken care of, the only time you will  really wait is when paying the bill. But I think they do that on purpose the more you wait the more time you have time for your food to digest then you get hungry and get a slice of Cheesecake!! haha"
Sandy N.,"Sacramento, CA",266,876,2178,3.0,1/26/2009,Very nice place especially at Caesar's Palace. This was my first time trying dining at a Cheesecake Factory. The menu selection was huge.
Tamara T.,"Santa Ana, CA",413,910,2114,3.0,7/20/2009,"I'm a Cheesecake Factory fanatic and this one was a slight disappointment. The hostess at the front was busy talking to someone else, the hostess that sat us down was blah and didn't say you're welcome after we said thank you. She might as well have been working at Denny's. Our waitress didn't greet us and looked annoyed and we later found out she was and it was with the bus boy. Towards the end it got better but for the most part a little ghetto as far as attitude. Food is always good, but I'd rather go to the Grand Lux at the Venetian."
Vince B.,"Orem, UT",24,17,2,4.0,3/25/2010,"Wife and I ate here on our way out of Vegas (always have to hit The Forum Shops before we leave).  Although it's not as good as its sister company, Grand Lux, it was still good.   I got the Kobe Burger, which makes that 3 times now total.  Such a great burger and it was cooked perfectly.  Our waitress (forget her name) was very upbeat (almost too much) and did an ok job at refilling our drinks and returning to our table in a timely manner."
Racquel E.,"Mountain House, CA",57,449,346,4.0,8/8/2011,"We were in the Caesars Forum Shops, and decided to have lunch at The Cheesecake Factory since we were near by. We eat at the Cheesecake Factory in our area, and I usually have the thai lettuce wraps or a fish entree. This time I decided to try something different, so I had the Luau salad. It's grilled chicken breast with mixed greens, cucumbers, red and yellow peppers, green beans, carrots, mango and topped with crisp wontons, macadamia nuts, sesame seeds and vinaigrette. I ordered the half portion, and the salad was huge. It was a very sweet and refreshing summer salad.  We sat in the patio area, and had a nice view of Caesars' gigantic tropical fish tank and people watched in the forum shops.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive."
Janelle P.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,92,25,1.0,5/30/2009,"I took my friend who was visiting from out of town here for a nice restaurant experience.  Boy did we get an experience... My boyrfriend and I decided to share the factory combo of herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi.  The salmon  was horribly undercooked in the middle!  I told the waiter and he tried to tell me that it wasn't and that if I wanted I could get another cooked piece.  At this point I was disgusted and wanted to order something else on the menu.  The waiter then came back and jokingly said okay you only have to pay half price for the combo since we only got half a meal :/ He then said he convinced the managers to comp. the meal.  I got my second plate of food which was also not very good.  Disgusted and disappointed I decided that we were just going to order our desert and get the check.  The combo had been comped as promise and we paid our bill.  Whatever change was left, we gave to the waiter.  As we were gathering our things he had the audacity to complain to us about his tip and said that he got us a free meal and spouted off some more bs as he walked away.  Never in my life have I had this happen to me.  We tipped the appropriate percent and he felt it wasn't enough and came to us, the patrons, and complained about something he should be grateful to receive.  This was TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  I then told the managers and they were outraged.  They told me that it was the waiters idea to only deduct half for the combo plate and theirs to comp the whole thing.  Not only was this waiter, named REX (?), rude and out of line, he was a LIAR.  The manager there was very apologetic and proceeded to the bakery to give me my choice of deserts.  This however, does not change the fact that we had a horrible, bland, undercooked meal and were treated like scum by their greedy rude waiter.  My friend from out of town never wants to eat at a Cheesecake Factory when she comes to Las Vegas ever again. I should note that the lunch specials are pretty good when I go here to eat during work.  Tonight was the worst and is going to turn me away."
K R.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,9,3,5.0,5/27/2012,"Good food, friendly servers, nicely priced, awesome cheesecake, and if you get to sit outside you get a nice view of the hotel's aquarium. You definitely should stop by. :)"
Cameron R.,"Champaign, IL",4,34,5,2.0,10/1/2009,"Went to the cheesecake factory at the forum shops with my girlfriend for dinner and was not impressed at all.  I had the fettuccine Alfredo. I'm not picky about my food but it had ZERO flavor. Some of the noodles were stuck together and hard from getting cooked on the bottom of the pot. The chicken breast on the noodles had zero seasoning. The service was very poor, the waiter didn't ask how our food was, and didn't come around much at all. I had to ask for a refill on my drink when ordering dessert.  The noise is also very loud, I wouldn't recommend coming here for a romantic dinner that's for sure. We sat near the kitchen and it was REALLY loud. They don't have doors that seperate it from the dining area.  The margaritta was 12.00 for a regular size. It was good though.  I'd only go here  again for cheesecake to go."
Blake T.,"Lehi, UT",122,46,4,5.0,1/28/2011,"This Cheesecake Factory provided some of the best service I've ever gotten at any restaurant. True to any CF, there's a huge menu and even bigger portions. The server was extremely helpful and very nice. Everything was served quickly and loved the atmosphere. Would highly recommend going there again!"
Thai N.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/11/2013,"Dined here during my last 3 Vegas trips. Food and service have  been excellent. Ribeye and prime sirloin steaks were both excellent. The garlic herb butter on top of the steak was da bomb! Just exploded with flavor with each bites. The garlic mashed potato is loaded with calories but Who's counting.  Best CF location in my opinion. Manager, waiters/waitresses/hostesses are courteous and acommodating. While waiting for a table, The huge aquarium infront is definitely icing on the cake, no pun intended"
