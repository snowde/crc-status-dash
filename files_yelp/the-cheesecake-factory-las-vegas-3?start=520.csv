Diane S.,"Houston, TX",306,948,153,4.0,5/20/2011,"amazing place to eat! So good, portions are huge. While in vegas I got a bellagio chicken because it made me think of the belliagio hotel. So good! I also like their pastas, pasta da venchi and evelyns. My dad loves their meat loaf. Everything is really good and portions are so generous! Moderately priced. Located in cesars palace. Annoyed that the water is served in a plastic cup, get some glass ones! Free bread, the brown one is amazing!"
J C.,"Oshkosh, WI",0,15,,4.0,4/16/2012,"The perfect place to stop for a snack and a drink while shopping.  We always splitt some appetizers. The staff is friendly.  No complaints, for a chain restaurant.  It's a nice change from the super-inflated prices on the strip. The mushroom flatbread is my new favorite."
alfred i.,"North York, Canada",75,44,2,4.0,8/4/2011,"They let us dine with our own premade 50/50 lemon aid + Tequila; only in Vegas! If you sit near the mall, the never ending mechanical play can get annoying."
Zoom Z.,"Mountain View, CA",2,180,4,4.0,6/25/2008,"I was eating solo this night and was starving when I was perusing the Caesars mall. I decided to go for a known quantity since I have known CF for years. I ate at the bar and had my usual soda and small chopped salad and bread. It came out to $15 bucks with tip. That's CHEAP by Vegas standards. The small salads are a good deal b/c CF gives you a huge amount of food in the main entrees and so these are just the right generous portion and most hotel rooms have no place to refrigerate or heat up your doggy bag anyways. Bar staff was great. I think it was Tim that helped me. Always made sure to keep my glass filled. Kudos to him and he's cute to boot. Verdict: Okay so CF is a chain that is everywhere nowadays, but it's nice to find someplace that is a known quantity, fed me in less than an hour, and isn't charging 50% more than their normal outlets and has a nice bar staff."
Dara I.,"Plainview, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/26/2014,Do NOT eat here if you are gluten free.  I ordered a burger from the gluten free menu and they served it on a wheat bun.
Stephanie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,127,,5.0,9/30/2008,"All hail the Cheesecake Factory at Caesar's!  We were having a bad day, stopped here for lunch, and it was like the sky opened and sunlight began to stream on our faces.  The air was sweeter, the weather nicer, all of humanity was in love with us.  Okay, it wasn't that extreme, but Cheesecake Factory really knows how to make you feel at home.   Our server, Gabby, was so great.  The strawberry lemonade is like a drug, that's how delicious it is.  Fresh-made guacomole and warm chips!  Super lunch specials.  I wish I was there now.  And do I even need to mention the cheesecake?  They have a new 30th Anniversary cake -- chocolate fudge cake and the original cheesecake together.  So good."
Po L.,"San Francisco, CA",144,627,1,4.0,8/27/2009,Had the Cheese Cake to go. They were friendly and courteous. The Cheese Cake was consistent. The whip cream was fresh. Everyone liked it but it would appear our French friends didn't like the peanut butter cheese cake.  I guess it's too rich for them.
Tamara Y.,"Portland, OR",87,148,1,2.0,3/5/2011,"Beet salad=small, bread=free, pastas=too oily, philly cheese steak sandwich=awesome (jeffs meal) and YEA here is why such a poor review. $8 a beer. really why?"
Freddy T.,"Lakeside, CA",62,10,,4.0,8/5/2013,this place has great food and amazing customer service. a customer was lashing out at a waitress just a couple feet away from my table. and after the incident the manager Rob walked over to us and apologized for what we had to see. It was very kind of him to do that.
Don V.,"Holiday, FL",2,14,8,4.0,7/23/2013,"Everything was excellent. Started with the Buffalo Blast appetizer! Amazing! The pizza and soup,were both good and of course the cheesecake was outstanding. The service was excellent and we waited less than 5 minutes to get in. The only problem I had with it (as seems to be the case with many restaurants in Vegas) is actually finding it."
Tom M.,"Henderson, NV",0,3,,5.0,11/29/2013,"My wife and I had lunch the other day at Cheesecake factory and let me tell you, the food and service was absolutely amazing. My wife had the Four Cheese Pasta, which was delicious. I know this, because it looked so good I had to try some. I had the Pasta Da Vinci which also was very tasty. Are waitress Melissa was very helpful with the menu. She also recommended that we try there fabulous cheesecake, which we did. We had the Pina Colada Cheesecake, yummy. We will definitely come back. And we will ask for Melissa again. Thanks Cheesecake Factory for a amazing dinner and a great experience."
Bianca D.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,12,4,4.0,7/26/2012,My family visited ceasars palace and ate here. Our waiting time was only ten minutes despite all the people. Our server was the best. He recommended several great dishes. The food was higher than our expections....
Jeremy W.,"Madison, WI",13,15,1,4.0,5/28/2011,"The Ahi Carpaccio was amazing, and the food was better than good. We had a very late dinner even for Vegas standards so it seemed like we were imposing."
Le Roi L.,"Vancouver, Canada",28,167,91,4.0,4/19/2010,"Located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet for a good meal at a good price! I like to sit in the patio section that extends out into The Forum Shops. It's great for people watching and has a view of a big, beautiful aquarium with lots of exotic fish swimming around. You also get to see(mostly hear) ""The Fall of Atlantis"" fountain show on the hour, every hour from the patio. This location gets very busy, so give your name to the hostess and be prepared for a wait!"
J. D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,48,3,3.0,3/29/2011,"We had great service, and the food was good.  Much better than the one in San Francisco.  The food arived very quickly, the only bad thing was the noise level from some of the other patrons was loud."
Allison L.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,174,1,4.0,11/7/2006,"Like I have said before, this is a chain restaurant, the menu is the same anywhere you go, the food tastes the same, the decor is the same, the dinning experience, is not always the same. While on our vacation, our group of friends had come up with a scavenger hunt of sorts where we were supposed to do certain dares. One of these dares was to eat food off of the plate of someone you did not know. Enter: the Cheesecake Factory. One of my friends decided to take this dare on and noticed a family getting up from their meal (children included). They had left some plates of half-eaten cheesecake on their table and she saw this as her opportunity. Before the family had even left, she walked up, picked up a fork and took a big bite of their cheesecake, smiled and walked back to our table. The looks on their faces were victory enough. I'm pretty sure the rest of our meal involved specialty drinks from their bar so I can't accurately comment on the food, or really anything else that happened. ;)"
Newman J.,"Lancaster, CA",2,153,62,2.0,1/17/2011,Service was not good.  Food was OK.  Won't be going there again. Had to wait 20 min to get in.  Waiter was no where to be found.  We decided on not leaving a tip.
Crysta K.,"Las Vegas, NV",301,126,,4.0,9/5/2008,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. So of course, when I got homesick this was a great place to go! It was a busy Saturday night at Caesar's but we were able to be seated within 15min! Very impressed :) Service was great...unfortunately, I decided to try something different than my usual Chinese chicken salad & fried macaroni and cheese balls. Slightly disappointed. I definitely don't recommend their cream of chicken soup. Just a lil too watery and too many tomatoes floating around for my liking.  BUT, the vanilla bean cheesecake was ah-mazing. Their slices are gigantic so we had it split and the waitress was even nice enough to bring it on two separate plates (*kudos* to good service*).  So I think I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a million times (ok maybe not but...) and I've [so far] concluded the following: Yay: Chinese Chicken Salad, Fried Macaroni Balls, Meat Loaf, Pot Stickers, Club Sandwich, Terriyaki Steak, Pomegranate Margarita, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. Nay: Cream of Chicken Soup."
Lilia K.,"Montebello, CA",0,12,,4.0,8/4/2013,always good!!! portions are huge. my friend order a cobb salad and it was enormous. i had a delicious turkey sandwich... it is definitely a spot to go when you get sick of the buffets.
Ed L.,"San Francisco, CA",3,207,408,4.0,9/14/2008,"Day 3... Since we couldn't find Stage Deli at the Forum Shops we ended up here at the Cheesecake Factory at the Forum Shops. Maybe we needed a break from those expensive restaurants. Didn't record our exact dishes but it was good and we had an attentive server. Big, big servings! Come really hungry!"
