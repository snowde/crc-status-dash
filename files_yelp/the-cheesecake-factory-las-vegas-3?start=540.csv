Cintya P.,"La Quinta, CA",190,441,517,3.0,11/1/2010,"This was my second time coming to The Cheesecake Factory. It was a really nice Cheesecake Factory since it was inside The Forum Shops at the Caesar's Palace. This one had an outside patio for dining with a view of the pretty fish tank! Nice! For this time around, I had ordered The Incredible Grilled Eggplant Sandwich with grilled Japanese eggplant, roasted bell peppers, red onions, melted mozzarella and garlic aioli on a toasted bun with a side of sweet potato fries. I asked the waitress if she would order my sandwich with the aioli on the side. When my dish arrive, I noticed that they did not place the aioli on the side (I am thinking that the waitress forgot to note it down), that  the eggplant was cut in quarters instead of being sliced thinly. What's the big deal, right? Well my Yelpers, trying to eat a chunk of an oily grilled eggplant inside a toasted bun smeared with garlic aioli and melted cheese and slippery grilled peppers makes it difficult to handle and eat. The eggplant kept slipping off my sandwich every time I took a bite. Hence, I decided to just take it off my sandwich and have a roasted pepper and cheese sandwich and eat the eggplant on the side. If they would change the cut of the eggplant, then the sandwich would definitely no be as messy to eat and enjoy, especially if you are paying like $15! I tried the Chicken Madeira from a friend's plate. The chicken was very tender and juicy and the sauce was not too salty or bland, perfect! I also tried her mashed potatoes and loved that you can taste real potatoes! Definitely not potatoes out of the box and then scooped onto your plate haha. Great portion for two meals! Now that's a bargain. My friend, however, ordered the plate with no asparagus and it came with it anyhow. Thus, the waitress forgot to note it down as well.  Overall, great dining experience! Service was okay since the waitress kept forgetting minor details and tried to get us to keep buying dessert even after we were obviously full and in a bit of a rush. She did bring us ton of bread to eat though. I"
Darren S.,"Cedar Park, TX",9,237,,4.0,12/31/2010,Had the typical great Cheesecake Factory meal here.  One of the few chain restaurants that the meal is always consistently good.
Andrea L.,"Orange County, CA",463,353,106,2.0,9/27/2010,"Only good thing about my experience at this cheesecake factory is the stuffed mushrooms. Other than that I didnt like the waitress because she was a complete (b$%Ch). She received like 50 cents for tip. YES, even thats pushing it because I dont feel like she deserves a dime. Anyways, the corn fritters werent good and neither was the mojito that I ordered. You would think if you pay so much for a drink it would be good, but it tastes just like concentrated lemonade with a hint of alcohol. *GROSS. the end"
Crystal C.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,337,151,4.0,3/23/2007,"The food here is a solid three stars.  Nothing horrible about it, nothing great.  It's a standard menu with standard food that's a little overpriced for what you get. But who really goes to a place called The Cheesecake Factory for their entrees?  They really do know how to make a good cheesecake, although you'll probably only need about half a slice.  Their filling is thick while still remaining creamy and full of flavor and the selection is astounding (the tiramisu cheesecake is my personal favorite).  I'm a huge cheesecake fan and I can dig theirs.  I still think my homemade ones are better, but you can't win them all.   You can't beat this location though.  Sitting on the balcony and looking at the aquarium at the Forum Shops?  That pretty much wins."
Victor H.,"Alhambra, CA",62,118,47,3.0,4/16/2008,"These folks are starting to look as if they are worn out!  One too many smiles, one too many frowns, one too many birthday guests....One too many!   That was my initial impression on  Tuesday evening at this location.  The hostess was kind but wasn't overly anxious to seat us.  No eagerness to see how our day had been going or how they may accommodate us past how many in our party...(felt like we were caught up in some mechanism we couldn't break out of once the service started up!)   First the water attendant to ask if we cared for water....Then the waiter to hit us up for our booze fix question, then the bread person (alternate bus-boy), to bring us our serving of yeasty fix-ins....Followed by the timed ""Do you know what you may want for dinner?...Might I start you off with an appetizer?""  from our waiter again....It all felt so routine an impersonal.  No eye contact, no ""how is your day going?"", No smile!  We did get---""Shall I give you a few more minutes?"" and without us answering, our waiter was able to read our minds and turned and walked away to another table because we had wavered a slight bit in our timing to respond!-----SO IMPERSONAL!  So Ho-Humm!  If I had stabbed myself with a fork, they probably would have asked if I would like another fork? How's about we talk about the food!  Good for I had the Hungarian Goulash, and my friend had the CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA.  Both were done right and served in a timely fashion.  And my friend's Birthday!?---Not even a mention of a birthday cupcake or anything (Quite disappointing that they offered nothing when most other places offer at least a scoop of ice creme!)...they didn't even offer though I had told them. My over-all assessment here is ---- they need to get a clue that being at the Caesars Palace Colonnade Mall, The Cheesecake Factory is like an ambassador to the world, and they came close to getting a failing grade here tonight!"
Lisa W.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,154,6,3.0,7/23/2008,My friends and I normally hit this restaurant whenever we go out. Sometimes you do have to wait awhile to get a table.  The food is decent. The decor is nice.The staff is friendly. Honestly I would rather buy a cheesecake then eat the appetizers/entree's. Go for the gold...skip the food go for the dessert!
tony h.,"Rowland Heights, CA",10,12,,5.0,1/5/2009,"I hate spend more than $15 for pasta for 26 years.... I always think it is not worth it!! Are you kidding me Pasta costs me more than $15  Hell No!!!!  Cheescake Factory is a chain restaurant, the menu is the same anywhere you go, the food tastes the same.  But I was wrong........This one I am telling you!! Because of this cheesecake factory ONLY at Caesar's made me change my mind... they make me started to love pasta!!  Oh~ my Freaking God!!!!  They have The Best and The Best, Best ,  Best x1,000,000 * Seafood Pasta with Red Sauce *  Ever,  Super, So damn GOOOOOOOD!! I would fly all the way from L.A to Vegas only for this pasta!! And you tell me how good it is?? Get Real~!!"""
Fred J.,"New York, NY",32,198,89,4.0,6/17/2010,"Yeah this place is good. I came here once after PURE. It was good because when you're witha  crowd of people who usually have some type of after-club attitude, its a good place for them to get whatever they want."
Heather P.,"Dover, OH",326,31,1,5.0,9/28/2010,"This place rocked. They had everything imaginable on the menu, cool atmosphere and more of the more affordable nice places out in Vegas. Really good service too and very clean."
Linda C.,"Buena Park, CA",64,124,61,5.0,9/23/2011,"you cant go wrong with the factory.  i was a bit skeptical about this particualr one, especially sucha large hi traffic location we were seated right away on a fridayafternoon, i had athe shrimp blt and green iced tea, service was great and attentive , i guess they need to get customer out with a quickness..somewhat pricey , but almost evrything on their menu you cant go wrong,"
Jenn N.,"Brentwood, CA",722,778,894,5.0,7/16/2007,"Great place!  Put your name in and browse the shops.  Just make sure to check back because they told us 45 minutes and our table was ready in 20.  The waiter was very nice, warned me against a drink he said, and I quote, "" a waste of $8"" LOL  The food was awesome.  Order the Rasberry Lemon cheesecake...everyone in our party is STILL talking about it a month later."
Christopher A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/31/2008,"This was definitely a ""Meh. I've had batter"" My girlfriend and I love cheesecake factory and have been to many different locations.  While at the one in SF we had the best dinner. I ate the spicy crispy beef, which by the way i highly highly recommend.  I intended on enjoying a similar experience here, however left dissatisfied.  We were sat right next to the entrance to the kitchen, which usually doesn't bother us, but just added to the roughness of the experience. The server was rude, prompt, and showed more of a desire to go home, than to do her job.  Long story short. it was a sub par cheesecake experience."
Linsey F.,"Sacramento, CA",75,317,5,4.0,7/11/2007,Looking for a dinner under $20 a person in Vegas? Try the Cheesecake Factory. If you can manage to make a decision from their huge menu (way too many options for me). I was very happy with my garlic noodles- and was really happy to save some cash on dinner after loosing some money on the tables.  I left stuffed and happy with dinner and drinks- and our bill under $75!
Jaime P.,"Danville, CA",222,820,6,3.0,10/10/2007,"I don't know why it is, that regardless of where I'm traveling, we end up hitting up The Cheesecake Factory.  At the time I had just arrived in and my friends and I were starving, so this seemed to be the only available spot that we could all agree on in Caesars's Palace. Service was ok, we got seated right away, but we seemed to have a somewhat tough time tracking down our server at times.  Pretty standard fare as far as Cheesecake Factories go."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,4.0,6/26/2007,Love this location because: 1.  you are footsteps away from some great shopping 2.  you can stare at the aquarium while you eat al fresca (but really not outside) 3.  they used to have the Gods show but I don't know if it's their anymore 4.  YOU ARE IN VEGAS!
Christina M.,"Venice, CA",2,9,,5.0,8/31/2010,"Everytime i'm in Vegas I make a stop at the cheesecake factory in Caesars Palace. The selection is great, never dissapointed, never too long of a wait, and the staff is exceptional. Our last visit over the weekend we had the pleasure of being served by Gabriel. He was so delightful, fun, witty and charming. His service went above and beyond. Love this place:)"
Cara J.,"San Jose, CA",79,211,10,4.0,3/25/2009,"The four stars is because the waiter was AMAZING! My back was in a LOT of pain and not only did he bring a bag of ice, he even recommended the best alcoholic drinks to get rid of it.  Multiple times he came by our table while we were talking about mildly inappropriate things and he was funny and adorable.  The food is still just Cheesecake Factory, but the Georgia Peach drink was delicious."
Debbie M.,"Tracy, CA",26,450,39,4.0,4/26/2011,"Located in the Forum Shops area of Ceasers- it was a great place for lunch after a day of walking.  The outside dining is in the mall area.  The decor seemed like a ""mall version"" of this eatery...seemed a bit cramped.  They do have seating on the 2nd floor so it is larger than it seems.  The food is consistatly good, the service at this Cheesecake Factory was exceptionlal.  Prices seem better than other places on the strip- if you are hungry & want food you can count on at a fair price this is a good choice.  The Lousiana Shrimp I ordered was good but needed more zip in my opinion...but I like spice.  The Vietnamese Tacos were a tasty little start to out meal. The Sheila's chicken Salad was very yummy too!   We skipped the cheesecake....after all this eatery is now located all over the place.  I do love their cheesecake- but one cannot have dessert at every meal & stay in shape."
Eduardo H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,12,17,5.0,9/17/2010,"Great food,  Atmosphere very quiet , even though located in the Forum Shops. Service was great! Had very cool server named Tracey"
