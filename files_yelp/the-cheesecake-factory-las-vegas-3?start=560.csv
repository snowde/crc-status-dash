Megan M.,"Seattle, WA",39,244,,4.0,5/4/2009,I'd recommend breakfast at CF.  I've had the french toast twice now and it is delicious!  The portion is huge and it could easily be shared.  One of my other dining companions had the monte cristo sandwich which was also fabulous!  Reasonably priced and good service.
drea m.,"Seattle, WA",38,49,,4.0,11/21/2009,"Cheesecake is always a good standby.  huge selection, good food and cocktails - everyone can find something here.  i love the thai lettuce wraps - app is big enough for a meal!"
Misi P.,"Chicago, IL",80,461,4,3.0,4/11/2009,"I have a Cheesecake Factory at home and I'm not all that crazy about it, but it's a sight to be seen for visitors.  The one great thing about CF is that it's consistent wherever you go.  I had the fish tacos which were just a bit too much food for me and I didn't know that they came slathered in some sort of sour cream or sauce which made them a bit less enjoyable.  Overall it was fine and definitely a good place to take picky eaters if that's what you're dealing with."
Monica K.,"North York, Canada",15,93,78,4.0,2/11/2011,"I would personally stay away from any of their pasta dishes but their gumbo is really delicious. This also happens to be my favorite Cheesecake Factory location to date, but it is also the busiest location I`ve been to. Thankfully the giant fish tank located right in front of the restaurant is a great source of distraction, especially if you have kids.  Quick and friendly service, great family environment."
vi a.,"Vancouver, WA",2,107,,1.0,11/27/2009,"I wish I knew about this website a few months ago.  My family and I had great experience at other cheesecake factory. This location was a total upset. We made reservation ahead of time for twelve people and the staff rest assured that they can accomodate that much. Our reservation was supposed to be at 6:00 pm, but we weren't seated until 7:00 p.m. At this point, the men in the family were all upset, but still had to go in, for the sake of the ladies. So we followed the staff to an area, but only to find out that they didn't have our table ready. We were told that we will be scattered or to be sitted in different tables...even though we had a party of twelve. By this time, I was really angry. I wasn't able to hold myself in, I freaked out. They were supposed to find a way to meet our needs. Like they say, customers are always right. But the unorganized staff didn't deliver at all. Everyone in my family were upset because of what was going on and we were suppose to have a great time since it was my daughter's birthday. Anyway, as mentioned the staff were just horrible. We didn't get our drinks in a five minute time frame, but instead longer. It took us even longer to order and to get our food. The most irritating part, they messed up on some of the orders and didn't even apologize. Since I am very carefree, I asked one of the staff for the manager. I told the manager that we weren't happy and that, he had the worst staff any person can imagine.Out of all the cheesecake factory (at the ceasar's forum) staff, the manager, I believe was, the only one who was decent to actually care about his job and the reputation of the restaurant.  Skip this place when you are in Las Vegas. The worst restaurant ever. I would rate this place half a star."
Mel C.,"San Diego, CA",136,622,,3.0,2/23/2009,"3 stars for the cheesecake! minus one star for the crowded tables and the flavorless jambalaya. We came here after walking all over the strip because I had a giftcard and the food was just ok. The only thing I recommend getting here is the cheesecake- I can't remember what it was called, but it had reeses crumbled on top with caramel swirls and cheesecake on a butterfinger crust with more caramel. I'm drooling just writing about it...."
Jessica M.,"Oceanside, CA",6,58,,4.0,4/17/2008,"We went here for a birthday dinner and it was pretty good. The food was good ( I had a Navajo sandwich which was on indian fry bread...yum!) but the kicker was our waitress. She was awesome. She was so nice and made sure we had everything we needed but wasn't obnoxious and coming to our table every 5 seconds. She was the perfect waitress. And, because we told her late that it was my brother's birthday, he got a free piece of cheesecake instead of the usual sundae. Yea Heidi!"
San D.,"San Francisco, CA",28,257,12,3.0,2/17/2009,"This location is pretty much the same as all other Cheesecake Factory locations, except that you have to walk past a bunch of glitz, high-end stores.  Hard not to stop and shop on the way to the restaurant!  It's also right in front of a Caesar Palace amenity - an aquarium and a talking statue show.  Great way to occupy your time while you wait for your table, without spending any more money."
Kari S.,"San Diego, CA",78,385,43,3.0,12/9/2008,"We ate here on a Friday night and the wait wasn't bad when we got there, but when we left the lines were really long. This is the typical Cheesecake Factory...the food was just okay, but the cheesecake was yummy!! I had the grilled cheese sandwich and my DH had the bacon cheeseburger, both of which weren't anything special. For an appetizer we had the chicken taquitos which were kind of icky - really slimy inside. We had the lemon raspberry cheesecake which was really good! So it was all really just okay...nothing special and kind of pricey!"
Glen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,,4.0,8/18/2008,"I've only eaten here at the bar counter while I was shopping and somebody said ""feed me.""  Okay, that was my tummy and he didn't whisper either.   The service was very friendly and quick and the food was very good and as usual I had to get a doggie bag.   I can't really comment on the atmosphere inside since I was sitting at the bar."
Ashley H.,"Orlando, FL",228,378,23,4.0,7/13/2008,"Definitely the shortest wait for a Cheesecake Factory I've ever had! We waited about 15+ minutes on a Friday night, which I consider to be great. In addition, I especially appreciated it because it was CHEAP by Vegas standards. Plus, their chicken pot stickers are to die for. I was drinking sauce with a spoon, embarrassingly enough. I had the chicken piccata, which wasn't the best I ever had but it was fairly good. They gave me an absolute ton of food, which I could not finish. My boyfriend had the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce, which he enjoyed. For the two of us (2 entrees, 1 cocktail, 1 soda, 1 appetizer), it came to $47 with tax, I believe. Not half bad. The service was really good, and the place was absolutely packed. Great experience!"
Andrew W.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,561,8,5.0,1/10/2006,"This is the busiest Cheesecake Factory in their corporation and thats because its in such a great place: its right in the middle of the Caesar's Forum Shops. It also happens to be next to a Nike Town and a Virgin Megastore. Not to mention, a really huge and cool aquarium. I like coming here after a long day of wasting money at Caesar's. Also, I think the Cajun Rib-eye is the best kept secret in the business. Why? Its better than an outback porterhouse, by far, its not too expensive, and it has a huge serving size. They marinate these behemoths for at least 24hrs and in the end you wind up with a huge, juicy, tender steak broiled not too badly. YUMM."
Haley B.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,3/30/2013,"If I could give this business a zero star rating I definitely would. I got food poisoning from this restaurant when on my lunch break (I work in the forum shops). I ordered salmon and hadn't eaten anything else all day and felt violently sick immediately after. I wrote to the corporate offices online simply to notify them of the incident so that it didn't happen to someone else, I wasn't looking for something free since I don't plan on eating here again.. And they replied with a few questions about how I paid, what I ordered and the date and time which I gladly answered. About a week later I got a letter from them saying that their temperature and refrigeration was up to par and that they won't reimburse me for my meal. Great customer service Cheesecake Factory. Pretty much telling me.. ""Nope you didn't get sick from our food. Have a nice day."" It's not even about the food, now it's just horrible customer service."
Sarah M.,"Oceanside, CA",22,203,276,5.0,3/14/2006,Delicious!  Try the chicken Madeira with onion rings and a salad with their awesome blue cheese dressing.
Fur B.,"San Diego, CA",6,104,,3.0,7/6/2009,"I should preface this my saying I am not a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory - I usually find the food unimpressive and pretty bland... and the wait for a table is just insane.  We were here on a Saturday at lunchtime and did not have to wait for a table - yay!  However, beware of the ""outdoor"" seating, which is a patio within the mall.  There is a show right there every hour that is incredibly loud and if you sit out there, you will not be able to carry on a conversation.  Sitting inside the restaurant is far better.  The waitress was very good and attentive and I actually really liked the appetizer (cheddar cheese dip with tortilla chips) but I was very very hungry.  However, the main dish was not so good.  I got the portobello mushroom sandwich with fries.  The fries were actually really good but the mushroom was so greasy that I could not eat it.  Maybe next time I will just stick with the appetizers."
Michelle Y.,"London, United Kingdom",15,42,,4.0,11/9/2007,"Food is great, but this place is reallyyyy popular, so you'll probably be waiting a bit to be seated. If you can, get a table in the courtyard so you can watch the show."
Shawn S.,Germany,107,46,1,1.0,10/7/2010,"cheesecake factory sucks.  first off, get with the program, i'm a forum employee and you guys don't offer mall discounts.  2nd, why my to go order for SOUP took 39 minutes to get to me from the time i called is beyond my explanation, i know you guys didn't make this fresh i know it was sitting in a big vat with maybe just the garnishing put on right before it went out so why the delay?  3rd, why the fuck did my soup come in a coffee cup?  how in the fuck am i supposed to eat this without it getting everywhere?  and not even an apology from the incompetent to go clerk....like it's not abnormal for soup to take 39 minutes to get to a customer.  you guys are lucky i work in the same place and know how much it sucks to get aimlessly bitched at, so i wasn't gonna do that, but you guys suck.  fail in every aspect possible.  never again.  never.  only max brenner and fat tuesday's from now on.  rest assured, my whole staff feels the same way.  only reason we deal with you still is because your soup is only 5 bucks even with your non existent mall employee discount, but unfortunately now it takes 39 minutes to make it on our hour lunches.  never again..."
Jennifer W.,"Daly City, CA",55,237,1,2.0,3/24/2009,"The two stars are for our server only. He was incredible and really went out of his way to help make sure the dining experience was not a total loss.  However, the food was just plain dissapointing.  My mom ordered a pear and walnut salad with bleu cheese.  It came out with some cheese that did not taste like bleu, about 5 walnuts, and no pears.  So when we asked the waiter for some pears, he apologized and went to get a manager.  About 10 minutes later another waiter plopped down a small dish of cut pairs on it and left without another word.  The pears were dry, all 3 of them.  The rest of us all had hamburgers, and while the meat and toppings were good, the buns were soggy.  I know I shouldn't expect much from here for the food, I mean we all come here really for the cheesecake, but if a restaurant is going to have such an extensive menu, the food should at least be palatable and decent."
Javier L.,"San Jose, CA",5,80,,5.0,9/23/2009,"How can you go wrong with cheesecake factory?? Seriously I have yet to ever try something bad at this place, so reliable for a large portion of some great food and this one in Caesars is no different.  Went here after a long night in Vegas, we all woke up around 2pm and walked (or stumbled) over to cheesecake factory and began chowing down on the bread.  Once we got the bread in us we immediately order bloody mary's to get us back on track for the vegas life.  Our food came and I always stick with the Crispy Chicken Costeletta, try it, it is absolutely amazing.  All in all this meal brought us somewhat back to reality and our waitress was awesome, she would come over and joke around with us as we began ordering more drinks and getting our smiles painted back on.  For a great meal at a great price go to this place and you will not be let down...."
