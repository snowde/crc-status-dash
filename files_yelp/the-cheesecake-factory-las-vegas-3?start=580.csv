Adam M.,"Chicago, IL",19,211,1,3.0,2/28/2008,i was there for my friends dinner the day before the wedding.  i did not know before that you could have dinner there i thought it  was just cheesecakes :-)  i cant tell you the price because my friends mom payed . i would not have gone on my own because i was trying to do stuff unique to Vegas .  but the food here was really good and you get allot of it
