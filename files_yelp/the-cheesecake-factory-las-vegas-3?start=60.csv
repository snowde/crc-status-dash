Gabriel P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,5.0,4/24/2017,"I've been to many different locations but this one is by far my favorite. One of the ladies, Melissa, who often answers the phone and gives me my to-go orders is always friendly and helpful!  I wish they'd offer an employee discount so I could justify ordering every day but the service and food is so good that I still order regularly regardless!"
Justin O.,"Columbia, MD",142,19,1,5.0,1/16/2017,"The best experience I have ever had at Cheesecake Factory. After Carmines down the hall completely dropped the ball and lost 5 regulars, Cheesecake Factory completely saved our night out. The food was better than it normally is. It's always delicious but tonight our normal favorite dishes were absolutely flawless. The staff was top notch too! Especially the manager on duty who fixed a minor table issue, and our waitress who felt like a friend hosting a party. Unfortunately I did not get their names. This location has always been a consistently good option, but after tonight, it's become one of our top dining choices on the strip."
Wing M.,"CA, CA",1,57,48,2.0,11/11/2017,The wait was too long when it was not even busy. Finally got to sit down but had to wait for 15 minutes before a server even acknowledged our table. When the food came out they claimed the plate was hot but my food was only lukewarm. Today's visit was so not worth it.
Ruben G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,62,206,5.0,7/26/2016,"Came here for dinner 7-24-16 started around 4 pm. They were very busy, wait time was short like 5 minutes. Even though they were very busy the restaurant was very clean, nice clean floors. We were seated downstairs, started off with piña coladas, I got the everything pizza and my husband got chicken with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The drinks were delicious and the food was fresh, hot and delicious. Our server was Phillip E. He was very nice, always had our drinks full, just made our experience very enjoyable. We were so pleased we just had to let the manager know what a great experience we had. Next trip to Las Vegas we will definitely come back."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,5.0,6/21/2016,"I have to start by saying that they have the best peach Bellini EVER!! A small group of us came here and ordered the following... Peach Bellini Roasted beets with goat cheese salad Kale and Quinoa salad Crispy crab bites Ahi tartare Basil tomato flatbread Everything was delicious!  The service was great.  Our server, David F. was super nice and welcoming. I love this location."
Amelia N.,"Hayward, CA",0,6,,5.0,9/9/2017,"Went on a Friday night around 6pm. Food was great. I had the bam bam chicken and shrimp. It's was amazing I would definitely recommend it if you like the Thai  coconut curry. Our waitress Jasmine was very good, we asked a lot of questions and asked for some recommendations and she did not let us. She kept coming back to check on us and kept our drinks filled. She her self gets a 5 star from  me. I brought back some cheese cake to out room. After the long walk back the cheese cake was just what I needed. Thank you jasmine and the Cheesecake Factory staff for make our experience enjoyable"
Aluxa C.,"Henderson, NV",69,48,41,2.0,12/28/2016,Not the best service that I've had a a cheesecake factory. We sat at the bar and no bread or food for 30 minutes. I still waiting for good service
Mon S.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,28,8,1.0,12/6/2016,"Wow. I was so excited to visit the Cheesecake Factory in Vegas but never again. I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory so many times in California because it is one of my favorite restaurants for the quality and taste of food, consistency, and service.  I always order a BBQ chicken salad every time I visit the Cheesecake Factory. The one I had in Vegas ruined this dish for me.  The salad was not fresh. The cucumbers were all soggy. Not only that, I found 4-5 lettuce head ends in my salad?! I've never experienced this, EVER!!!! Upon calling my server and showing him this, asking him if this is normal he stated "" a few can get in there but not this many"" he just asked if I was done with my salad, cleared the napkin I had with the lettuce heads and proceeded to bring my check. Exceptional service... buddy. Oh and thanks not checking up on us once during our entire dinner.....So disappointed!!!!"
Vanessa M.,"Inglewood, CA",139,44,13,5.0,8/3/2017,"5 stars for the excellent service. Had an issue with my food and Ryan, the manager, came out right away to rectify the situation without me even having to ask to speak to a manager. I truly appreciated."
Avigael B.,"Las Vegas, NV",59,1,,1.0,8/16/2017,"Worth service ever, we wait 45 minutes for appetizers and over an hour for the food. I told the waiter I have milk allergy and he served my chicken with cheese, my sisters order steak and didn't get steak knives. Waiters brought the check with out pen. Manager was rude and smell like ashtray, I guess he was mad we bothered him during his smoke break."
Karen W.,"Oakville, Canada",0,35,17,5.0,3/15/2017,"There are plenty of amazing restaurants in Vegas but we always end up coming here and sometimes more than once. The service and food is always consistent and always great no matter which place it is. There's an aquarium right in front of it so it's not boring while you wait and sometimes there are divers in there which is pretty cool.  We had the pasta with meat sauce, steaks and a mushroom pasta which were all amazing. I would come back again and again!"
Ruth V.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,25,9,4.0,7/10/2016,"Whenever in Vegas , I always have to visit the Cheesecake Factory .  Although I am not usually a fan of chain restaurants especially when on vacation , I find The Cheesecake Factory to always satisfy my hunger.  The restaurant is way at the end of the Forum Shops in Caesars Palace right behind the Atlantis show which if seated on ""the patio"" gives you a great sight of the people shopping .  Food is very good. Prices are decent. Service is good .  I ordered :  The fried calamari (12.95)  Spaghetti w/ meatballs (15.95) Steak w/ mashed potatoes & vegetables (19.95)  Soft Drink  Total : $59.00  Tip : $6.00 ( although the service was friendly I'm not a generous tipper)  I will continue to visit this and other locations ."
Emma M.,"Spokane, WA",1,34,,2.0,11/13/2017,Chocolate cake was cold and hard.  Was it old? No herb tea. Water never refilled.  I was very let down.  Waiter polite but not attentive enough.
David P.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",118,2,,1.0,11/4/2017,Waited 1.5 hours when was told $20. Food also took way longer than expected. When brought to manager's attention they said we only waited 5 minutes and wouldn't believe us.
Joe V.,"Monahans, TX",66,6,,5.0,8/28/2017,Had the half turkey sandwich lunch special with french onion soup and a caesar salad. Everything was wonderful from the food to the customer service
Hope S.,"Perris, CA",0,9,1,1.0,8/27/2017,"Enjoyed our meal but very poor service. Was seated with Lara J. After she took our order she disappeared never came to check on us, waiting for her to refill our beverages for a long while. The whole time watching the other waitresses tend to their tables. When she finally came back it wasn't until we were already almost done with our meals. It just seemed like she didn't want to tend to us at all."
Sariah R.,"Las Vegas, NV",158,6,,1.0,10/28/2017,"This was the worst customer service that I have experienced. Every waiter was rude to us and gave us attitude. They made it very obvious to make us feel like we didn't have money. Just to add this in our first server had told us he was going home for the night so he was being relieved by our second server but he continued to serve the table right next to us throughout our entire time spent there. Now to our second server who would come and bring us our food and or drink; she would slide/slam the plate or glass right onto the table without warning and would walk away without saying a thing. She did not ask us any follow up questions. She gave us attitude throughout the whole dinner up until it was dessert time which is around the time the check comes so that was when she decided she would be ""nice."" Just to top it off she packed my food and then dropped some of my food on the ground and of course did not apologize. Honestly after all that I still tipped which I regret because she didn't deserve it and I wish I spent my money elsewhere. Not everyone has a million dollars but every customer is a customer and should be treated equally with respect it's a shame the servers here know nothing about that."
Michelle D.,"Windsor, Canada",3,10,6,4.0,6/13/2017,"Inexpensive for Vegas.   The food was decent, waitress friendly but a bit slow.   Not sure if it was anyone's fault as it was really busy.  Large menu, will have something to please everyone in your party.   Portions are large so I didn't get any cheesecake but the all looked amazing."
Antonio C.,"San Diego, CA",84,32,19,4.0,1/28/2017,This location is very convenient because it's inside the forum shops at Caesars Palace and behind the aquarium is the show depicting the Roman gods statutes.  The food was good and the service great.
Desi Food L.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,23,,4.0,8/9/2017,"Food and service was excellent. The only conplaint is long wait time. Even on tuesday night there was a big rush..they dont reservations, its walk in"
