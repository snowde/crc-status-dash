Eric S.,"Columbus, GA",6,119,147,4.0,5/22/2017,"The crispy crab bites on the lite appetizers menu are pretty awesome. You only get about 5 or 6, but they are super tasty and will not fill you up for your huge entree. I also ordered the Cuban sandwich. It's not your typical Cuban that's on a slim, pressed bun, but it's a huge sandwich that's you'd get at a typical sub sandwich place. I was kind of disappointed by that since Cuban sandwiches should be made a certain way. It tastes good though!"
Maeve M.,"Belfast, United Kingdom",31,101,189,5.0,7/18/2016,The cheesecake factory was delicious. I expected it to be really expensive but it was one of the least expensive meals we had in Vegas. The only downfall for me was that you couldn't reserve a table and had to queue and stand around waiting for one. I had the bacon bacon cheeseburger followed by a raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake. I could barely move after. The food was amazing. Don't make plans that you have to rush off to after! You'll be way too full up lol. Very tasty food here. You have to visit!
Yuliya S.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,1,5.0,8/12/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is always good for me ! One of my favorite places. Good food, good service."
Anusha B.,"San Francisco, CA",35,141,19,5.0,7/5/2017,Tiramisu Cheesecake. Yummy. Even tastier when you have in an amazing locale as the Caesars palace.
Rowena M.,"Las Vegas, NV",220,12,14,1.0,3/28/2017,Maybe you should fucking update this and let us know how long you're fucking closed for because no one fucking answers and the hotel operator doesn't fucking know and I waste my fucking time driving here after work and walking there to find out it's closed
Rikke H.,"København, Denmark",72,46,149,5.0,3/21/2016,"Gotta make this one in english  Last year I went to Vegas with some friends and i really needed to try their cheesecake at The cheesecake factory. I've heard good things and i'm a sucker for cakes so I really needed this.  We went in and started with some lunch -and wauv..... got the best bacon & scrambled eggs and really big and delicious fat pancakes -yummi :) Couldn't eat the whole thing because I also wanted the cake. I got one with mango on the top and my friend for one with lemon -they were both really delicious :) The service was on top. Actually the service in the U.S is just better and sweeter than in DK.  The waitress was there smiling all the time, came to ask if we needed anything, if the food was ok, just chatting and wanted to hear a bit about our vacation and DK.  I am really going back -both to Vegas and the cheesecake factory - I've never gotten such great cakes and there was a lot to choose from -gotta try then all :)"
Billy L.,"Romeo, MI",20,215,526,5.0,5/21/2016,I absolutely love this restaurant and try to eat there every time I am in Las Vegas. They have a menu full of variety and options and very unique combinations of food. My server was excellent and the food was delicious I have no complaints
Richard C.,"Houston, TX",48,111,20,5.0,10/21/2016,"DEFINITELY ASK for Crystal. Superb service and recommendations. Just ask what her favorites Are and you will be in Heaven!!! I'm now an Addict...Thanks to her :) She was quick, responsive and funny too.  Vegas best hidden treasure!!"
D T.,"Lake Charles, LA",67,320,656,5.0,6/18/2016,We all had huge burgers ! I had the mushroom Swiss burger with grilled bun! Perfectly cooked medium well!  I ordered salad with balsamic vinaigrette instead of fries. Salad was very good & large portion. 2 kinds of bread with butter served before meal. Wheat is soft & warm & is the best. Great service & meal on a Saturday with no wait for a table! Everyone loved their meal!
Marie A.,"San Jose, CA",26,18,18,3.0,5/9/2017,"Although the wait was a little long  the skinnylicious shrimp pasta was perfect and portioned appropriately.  Drinks were replenished consistently throughout the meal. In addition , the others in my party ordered the enchiladas.. which were authentic to the taste  and the pot pie was amazing. Despite the wait..it's a great place to eat!!!"
Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",581,846,10004,4.0,4/1/2015,"I recently tackled an ambitious multi-course dinner here, which was both stomach filling and palate pleasing.   For starters, I began with Crispy Fried Cheese, which was composed of a nice mix of both Mozzarella and Fontina Cheeses.  Following close behind were pan-fried Chicken Pot Stickers, which were satisfying doused in a Ginger & Soy Dipping Sauce, and SkinnyLicious Shrimp Summer Rolls that were wrapped in Rice Paper along with asparagus and Shitake Mushrooms.  The cold, fairly wide (not particularly skinny) rolls were lip-smacking good dipped in  either a provided Chili Dip or Peanut Dip.  Next a large cup of spicy Tortilla Soup that would be labeled a ""bowl"" most everywhere else contained a pleasant but unusual concoction of rice- and corn-filled enchilada-flavored liquid.  Complimentary Brown Bread was excellent. Although by this time more food was hardly necessary, a packed California Cheesesteak that was filled with thinly sliced grilled steak, onions, peppers, and melted cheese, and covered with sauteed mushrooms inside a toasted Ciabatta Roll, was nicely done.  Accompanying French Fries were good, and the Cole Slaw that went with Diane's Fried Shrimp Platter was cool and creamy.  Obviously there was no further room for dessert, so it was forsworn.         Delivery was late on Diane's ordered Root Beer.  Otherwise service was very attentive.  A California casual atmosphere well suited my choice of sandwich.   XXXX-1/2 Overall!"
Baby J.,"Santa Ynez, CA",1,82,2,3.0,4/11/2017,"I went here because I was craving drinks and appetizers and the cheesecake factory is always freshly made and doesn't suck. I was let down, the bread at this location was dry and tasted like it had been sitting out which is very unlike the locations in California I am used to. the rest of the food was alright, bit I feel like we either got an off night or this location is not quite up to par."
Michelle R.,"Anaheim, CA",0,37,,5.0,7/22/2017,"I walked in with my daughter and this waiter Chris made sure that I will get the right order the way I want it. He carefully asked for my preference and made awsome effort to achieve what Ive wanted. Very attentive and pleasing service. Unfortunately, we had to change server because of the sitting issue, then Phil was the one that replaced Chris and he provided me the same excellent customer service. I was very happy as Iam not a local I like to have pleasant moment during my vacation and one of them is dining with great experience at restaurants that I like.  I give 5 star to these men who provided excellent customer service to their customers and willing to make efforts all the time!!!"
Kim A.,"Blairstown, NJ",0,30,45,4.0,7/8/2017,"We went here while shopping in the mall. No wait for lunch. Food came out quickly. The prices are relatively close to our local CCF.  I would say about $2-$3 more each item. But love CCF , they never let us down."
Sarah S.,"Clonsilla, Dublin, Republic of Ireland",63,344,1978,4.0,4/18/2015,Sangria and Red velvet cheesecake! As I mentioned in another post I love this chain and wish they'd come to Ireland. After dinner at Grimaldi's in the Venetian we came here for dessert. Queued for about 40 minutes and got three seats at the bar. I chose red velvet cheesecake and sangria. Red velvet has got to be my favourite. Enjoy the pics ;)
Peter S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",30,353,275,4.0,3/20/2016,Arguably the best breakfast option on property. Had a minor issue at the start that was quickly resolved by Tiffany the manager on duty and our server Jessica Cherry who was brilliant and highly alert.  She provided us with great service and is a model of how an awesome server does their job. Ask for her and you can count on a great experience... And leave a big tip!!
Brent L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,15,4,5.0,7/17/2017,First time eating at Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the bacon bacon cheeseburger and it was so good it rivaled a Gordon Ramsay burger and I love Gordon Ramsay burger. Service was good and restaurant was clean.
Misty K.,"Henderson, NV",0,16,5,5.0,7/12/2017,"Michael is serving us right now (10 pm 7/12/17) and he is so professional and charismatic! My family and I are locals and this is one of our favorite cheesecake places because of the great service employees provide! My mom forgot her reading glasses and he was so kind to offer his so she can read the menu. Haha thank you, Michael!!!"
Trasie J.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,13,2,5.0,1/24/2017,"Im here Johnathan M... a wonderful server... look yall, i came in here with major dizziness ... blood sugar was super low.. he gave me a basket of fries right away.  He suggested dishes that were amazing ans checked on my very often.. im not one to ever order desserts.. but i had to show my appreciation for this place. Johnathan is very informative and amazing!! What a lovely experiemce.. living here in vegas... im so running back to the strip for lunch often.. cheese cake... yall did good, Johnathan is wonderful"
Emily R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1770,1649,10800,3.0,11/27/2014,"On a recent staycation to Caesars Palace, we had every intention on trying a nice restaurant, but we were feeling lazy and just wanted something easy and quick to eat.  They were packed for a Sunday, but we were seated quickly. My chicken and avocado club was standard, not a huge fan of the fries, but they were decent. My fella got the catfish, which seemed like an odd choice and he didn't care for it and ended up eating half of my sandwich instead. We also took a pineapple upside down cheesecake, which was really good and had lots of nice big chunks of pineapple in it. The food was standard and service was as well. Good spot to go when you're inside the Forum Shoppes that won't break the bank."
