Ray M.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,19,33,4.0,1/9/2018,"""Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake? You know I love to go there Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney"" - Drake My roomie likes two things: Drake and Cheesecake Factory. And she had gotten a particular Drake song in her head and asked if I could take her to Cheesecake Factort. It was her birthday after all.  This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Boca Park shopping center in Summerlin. Not hard to find as it is probably one of their anchor stores for that shopping center. Maybe it's the location [you are in Summerlin afterall] but this location seems more elegant and dressed up than your average Cheesecake Factory. Parking can be a hassle but there are valets outside. Anyways, on to why this is a 4 star rating. My girlfriend and I took my roommate to dinner for her birthday yesterday. As soon as we entered the girlie and I took a seat while my roomie gave the group's name to the hostess. We had sat down and were called almost immediately! Talk about service.  Our server was a very nice woman named Cathy B. who was very attentive. I'm HUGE on customer service and recognize it whenever I see stellar service. She was a sweet, kept our drinks filled, took our plates away as soon as we were done eating and we were even able to get her and the rests of the servers to come over and sing 'happy birthday' to the B-day girl.  The total experience was excellent and left an impression on me. And that's a big plus because I'm generally not a fan of chain restaurants like C.F. or Olive Garden. Now on to the food. For an appetizer I had an order of buffalo chicken wings. They were yummy and had the right amount of zing to them. The best thing I had that night! For dinner I ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It was cooked to order and even had pork belly in it. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Pretty average. And the only reason I can't give my visit a perfect rating.  I did have a bite of the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was good. I don't have much in terms of a sweet tooth so I can't say that the cheesecake wow'ed me but it did was plated very beautifully. Nice job on the presentation."
Tiffany Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",1358,228,1847,4.0,1/3/2018,Cheesecake Factory located on Rampart in Las Vegas NV has definitely improved their game. Finally!!

EXCELLENT! :) Looks like Cheesecake Factory is definitely back to a restaurant worth recommending! Enjoy! :)
Melissa S.,"Las Vegas, NV",250,10,4,2.0,12/27/2017,"Our family loves The Cheesecake Factory. However, this particular location taints their brand. I have come here so many times for family events and despite our hopes the service will get better it never seems to. The knowlege of our server was unacceptable. Showed up at 4:15pm on a Wednesday. We were seated within 5 minutes for a party of 6. I went to the Restroom upon arrival and it was a mess. Also there was only 1 stall with toilet paper. Drink orders came along and I asked oir server Tara G what they had for tequila. I was told Patron. I asked if there were other silver options and was told no, just Patron. I passed and went to the bar to order instead. Come to find out there was 4 options of silver tequila. Don Julio & Patron being the most expensive naturally.  We wanted to order appetizer, but after recieving our drinks our waiter took too long to return to our table. We ended up just ordering our entrees. I asked if my dish the Diane and Salmon came with asparagas and was told no, so i ordered some on the side. The dish comes out and there is asparagus with it, and a side of asparagas as well [which of course I had to pay extra for].  My sister ordered the chinese chicken salad. The salad came dry with no oranges.  I noticed the food runner come out and have a conversation with out waiter where they looked at the food delivered to our table. It seemed as if they realized the wrong salad was delivered, but upon us questioning it we were told no thats what you ordered. At this point we just asked for a side of dressing and oranges. For the price and location I honestly would expect better management and training of staff."
Christy K.,"Las Vegas, NV",37,86,161,5.0,12/17/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant! I love their flavors and portion sizes (especially portion sizes for their salads). Their cheesecakes are to die for, but the calorie count is beyond belief and just might kill you (as is the case for most items on their menu). I love the brown bread they bring to the table when you arrive and their passion fruit iced tea is the bomb! Of course, the avocado eggrolls are exquisite, but I seldom order them. Instead, I found a recipe that tastes exactly the same so make it at home. Making the recipe, though, shows why their food is so good--they use unique and quality ingredients and their dressings and sauces include many, many ingredients (many of which are hard to find). I usually order a dinner salad, eat half of it, and take the rest home (asking for a little extra dressing in my take-home bag). With the remainder, I can make two more meals simply by adding extra lettuce.  The Cheesecake Factory is not cheap so is truly a special treat. They offer take-out so are a great option when traveling and don't feel like going out to eat or ordering room service."
Anum W.,"University, Las Vegas, NV",187,69,226,5.0,10/23/2017,"CHEESECAKE. Cheeeeeeesecake. Who doesn't like cheesecake?! & when you add a restaurant where the servers applaud you for eating dessert before dinner, why would you NOT go?  It wasn't my first time at this location, but it seemed like a LARGER location than the others around town. The wait was approximately 20 minutes, so my friends & I bought and ate a mango lime cheesecake first. It was tart, the ingredients perfectly blended, perfect for my sweeeet tooth.  For dinner, we skipped the appetizers and went straight to the entres. I could use a lot of words to describe each dish, but pictures are worth more.  Great service! Amazing food! Tons of options!"
Susy K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",39,47,106,5.0,10/5/2017,"About 2 weeks ago 8 of us came here at 11am for brunch. Usually at other restaurants will charge you the gratuity automaticly for party of 6 or more but this cheesecake factory didn't charge. Great service & good food. Everybody were really nice there, the host (RYAN & VADA), our server ( I forgot his name roberto or ricardo) They have a lot of food selections & specialty under 500 calories also a lot of cheesecake to choose from  Their lunch special from 11am-5pm. Each of us order different food. Maybe you think a little bit pricey but you get a lot of food. We were not even eat half of our food, too much food so We all have left over to take it with us . We all love with our ordered We had a strawberry cheesecake (their original cheesecake top with a big piece of strawberry & a little bit strawberry sauce) & fries to share. Their fries is what  fries should be, I wish other places that sell fries do what like this place do. It is hard to explain but We love it I ordered chicken bellagio $16.59 - 2 pcs crispy coated chicken breast over basil pasta & parmesan cream sauce top with prosciutto & urugula salad. REALLY REALLY GOOD I also ordered a slice of chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake to go but I prefer their original. We will definitely come back"
Jamie P.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,430,758,3.0,9/7/2017,"My family and I came here for my birthday dinner at 5pm on Saturday 9/2/17. It was busy inside but we only had to wait about ten minutes to be seated. Our server brought waters and bread right away and everything was off to a good start. The menu here is massive and I never know what to order. They have over 200 items, how can you decide?!? I finally chose the bacon-bacon cheeseburger with fries, mainly because I am obsessed with the ranch here and wanted to dip something in it. Yeah, I am a ranch freak. Side note, you can buy the ranch and all of their dressings to-go.  So we all order and then wait for our food. I expected there to be a long wait but it was pretty quick. Everyone gets their food but my grandma. Also, I realized I got the wrong burger. When our server comes back, he apologizes and says he will get those out right away. 20 minutes later, me and grandma still have no food. Everyone else is pretty much done eating at this point. Finally our food shows up, and by this time my appetite is gone so I take everything to go. We also ordered cheesecake, because duh. I ordered the pumpkin, (seasonal) and since it was my birthday, they brought it out singing. I love being embarrassed on my birthday, said no one ever. Our server was able to get the manager to comp some of our meal, which was much appreciated. We probably won't be eating here again anytime soon, but I will be back to get some cheesecake."
Richard L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",9,1,1,1.0,1/4/2018,"To start off the macaroni balls were scrumptious! It all went down hill when I chose the chicken & biscuits, what in the world was I thinking. When the food arrived the smell already threw me off, then I poked at the biscuits and they were harder. They felt like they were made days ago. I continued to poke around and really enjoyed the mashed potatoes but the chicken. Let me tell you. It felt like it had been microwaved and had a really rubber texture to it. No word on when I will be back but definitely not going to recommend this entree."
Leah M.,"Las Vegas, NV",276,47,20,4.0,11/16/2017,"Cheesecake factory is great for their extensive menu and delicious cheesecakes. I rated a 4 star because it's difficult for me to ever give a chain restaurant a 5 star strictly because I like authenticity. On the expensive side, the food and cocktails are delicious.  I do really appreciate that they do NOT use Styrofoam for their to-go boxes."
Dana G.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,46,4,5.0,11/6/2017,"Normally I don't review chain eateries but I'm feeling inspired after tonight's takeaway dinner. It's all too easy for National chains to slip into mediocrity (my fave eatery phrase). Many start with ideals of quality, sourcing, and customer care, and get shoddy over the years. Not so for the Cheesecake Factory. Year after year, ingredient quality, service and food prep stay at a superb level. Tonight: Sheila's chicken and avocado salad. The greens were super-fresh and included chicory, arugula, and baby spinach. Crispy won-tons (I removed mine), cashews, moist breast slices, perfectly ripe avo's, and a few other items rounded things off. As a carb-conscious diner with a healthy appetite, this dish was most satisfying. In the past, I've also enjoyed the Asian chicken salad, grilled salmon with mashed (ok, it was a carb-splurge day ;) and 3-4 other dishes I can't recall. Their managers are even gracious if there's ever an issue. My ""only"" humorous-complaint is their menu listing several pages of ""specialties"". If everything is ""special"", then nothing is. But this is a trivial thing. Their food rocks!"
Randle F.,"Moorpark, CA",12,17,17,4.0,1/6/2018,I wanted to take a second to say thank you to the manager working right now. I come here relatively often and even though I didn't have a great experience this time I would still come back. I order the herb lemon chicken and when it arrived the potatoes were cold and the sauce was very clearly not right. I've had this before and it's usually so good. This time it was very sour and weird. The manager not only took off the item from our bill but gave us a gift card to come back next time as an apology. That is so amazing and he knows how to take care of customers. Mistakes always happen at restaurants but it's how you treat your customers that make the experience. Thank you!! Not necessary but very much appreciated.
Gracy A.,"North Las Vegas, NV",34,31,47,4.0,9/28/2017,"My favorite go to restaurant when my husband and I were just dating. Ambience is okay, staff and service were not a problem during our visits. Their menu is tremendous, 100+ items  to choose from. From salads to burgers, pastas, and more. There is something for everyone vegan or not! I have probably tried almost every cheesecake on their menu except the key lime, not a fan! Carrot cake is perfect, not too sweet and just enough flavor and ingredients. The white chocolate rasberry cheesecake is our fave. Oreo like crust and curled white chocolate pieces on the sides with a hint of swirled in rasberry puree. Fried calamari is an appetizer to order. Lightly battered, perfectly seasoned and crisp! It's served with a garlic aioli like sauce and cocktail sauce.  List of our favorites... Chicken Bellagio- crispy coated chicken breasts over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce topped with arugula and prosciutto.  Steak diane and Shrimp scampi- We enjoy our steak medium well. Very amazing flavor of marinated steak and shrimp. Mash potatoes were creamy and perfectly paired with grilled asparagus. Perfect all the time, won't disappoint! Avocado egg rolls appetizer- The dipping sauce for this egg roll is what makes this soo tasty. It has a taste of honey, soy sauce and ginger."
Joseph O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,5,5.0,1/7/2018,This is second time to this cheesecake location and the family and I love it!!!  Appetizers were fantastic. Bacon grilled cheese so yum!!! Wife got the pineapple chicken shrimp and wouldn't stop gloating how good it is! Nephew ate all his pancake. I had the bacon bacon burger and barely could eat cheesecake!
M P.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,51,43,5.0,9/15/2017,"Came for dinner around 6pm in a Friday. We expected to wait, but was seated pretty quickly! Service Our server was wonderful. He came to greet us, dropped menus, and got our drink orders. When we were ready to order, he was quick and repeated the order perfectly. I really liked that he came around frequently to refill drinks and clear empty plates. Food We ordered Calamari, Crispy Crab Cakes, Zucchini Fries as appetizers. All 3 tastes wonderful. The breading was light and crispy. Entrée was Rib Eye Steak for me. Moderate and it was served perfectly! My husband got the Steak Diane/Medera Chicken, his was very tasty as well. Overall our experience was wonderful. Will definitely come back!"
Jerome H.,"Las Vegas, NV",152,55,138,1.0,1/3/2018,It's been a few weeks since I brought he kids to our go to place Cheescake factory and I was deeply disappointed with the service that we received. I had asked for bread numerous times and 15 mins later there is no bread. Our appetizers came and ordered a second batch of appetizers and yet still no bread. I know that it's busy but at least have someone come to our table and explain why there is no bread coming. We'll see how this will end tonight.
Mike A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,33,7,5.0,12/24/2017,"5 star service tonight! Thank you Isaiah! What a crazy Christmas Eve night. Tired from shopping, wrapping (thinking about all the wrapping to go), and hangry. After waiting for 30 min on this crazy busy night at CF, Isaiah was there to impress. Table touched endlessly. Drinks always full. Bread and butter never without. Kids needs of napkins and extras met. Thank you kind sir, especially on Christmas Eve when you could be home serving your family, your serving hours like Momma would. Thank you, thank you. Made a new fan for life. Food was fresh, all that. But great service makes all food taste better. Cheers!"
Peaches D.,"Las Vegas, NV",298,147,353,4.0,5/26/2017,"This has been me and my best friends spot to go every year for our Christmas exchange. During holidays and dinner you can almost guarantee you'll be waiting for a little bit.  The service is okay. Sometimes it's great and other times your server is no where to be found ,but with the high amount of traffic and the numerous times I've been back it's safe to say it's good enough service to keep people coming back.  I usually get the chicken crusted Romano, but have tried numerous things on their menu from the miso salmon to their many cheesecakes. The portions are pretty big because every time I dine here I always have to ask for a to go box."
Corrina R.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,180,768,2.0,3/19/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory; although expensive the atmosphere is cheerful.   The service is always awesome when we go to any of these establishments.   Today we met some friends for lunch. When we arrived and walked in I let them know we had a party of six and I asked the girl If there was a wait and she said ""no there isn't a wait"" I said great. She takes my name and says it will be about five minutes. I was like what, you just said there wasn't a wait?????? I wasn't upset that there was gonna be a wait but for the fact she said there wasn't going to be one was kind of annoying.  I thought okay maybe they have to get a table to fit us. That wasn't the issue because after waiting about ten minutes they walked us over to a booth which was sitting next to a handful of other empty booths.  Again I wasn't mad about waiting but just annoying that she lied, bizarre right?? Anyway, the host gives us our menus and about five minutes goes by before our super,  sweet and nice waitress arrives to get our drink orders. She goes to retrieve our drinks, drops them off and I realize we don't have straws for our drinks; only a straw for my sons (which they put in). I actually prefer to do this ourselves. Again just annoying.  We wait for about five minutes before anyone walks by before we scored straws.   Next, we finally get our food orders in and our meals finally arrived about 25 minutes; after giving our orders.   The food was good and I do like that they have added the calories of their meals to menus,  as well as new items.  When it was time to pay getting our bill took forever; once she dropped the bills off it took another ten minutes before she came back to retrieve them. It was annoying again.   My last complaint was that the booth was filthy. There was dust on one of the napkins, corn dog sticks between the wall and seat as well as on the on the floor. There were crumbs all over the seats and the floors were dirty. The place really needs a deep clean. If the dining area is filthy that makes me assume that the kitchen must be pretty dirty.  I can promise you this; I'm finding a different Cheesecake Factory to eat at and never visit this establishment again"
Kierin D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",3,14,1,2.0,12/8/2017,"Several weeks ago, our family had dinner at The Cheesecake Factory on Rampart. It is a familiar place that we can go because of the variety of foods. No one in the family can go wrong with the amount of choices they offer, and of course, there is cheesecake for dessert!  Our waiter took an extraordinarily long time to take our drink order & to bring bread & butter. After we gave him the drink order, we still waited an extraordinarily long time just to get drinks, and still had to remind him of a beer that we ordered. When salad came, there was a toothpick in my son's salad. Had the toothpick got into his mouth, he could have choked, cut his mouth, or any number of things. One of the side dishes we ordered didn't come with our order & arrived much later. Overall, it was one of the worst experiences I have had at The Cheesecake Factory. Be forewarned about this location. Very disappointing!"
Lisa P.,"San Jose, CA",91,56,925,4.0,11/3/2017,"Pecan pumpkin cheesecake is good but I prefer the regular pumpkin cheesecake! The chicken Bellagio is amazing but big enough for 3-4 meals. Seriously my new fav! We ordered the sangria and the cucumber mojito, the bartender was off his game tonight. Our drinks were so sloppy and soaked on the bottom of the glass."
Caitlin B.,"Las Vegas, NV",201,142,135,4.0,8/24/2017,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time at this location. We came on a Saturday night and it was packed. We ended up sitting in the bar area to avoid waiting for a table. Although you typically don't get the best service at the bar tables that was not the case here! Bread was brought out and our orders were taken within minutes of sitting. We ended up ordering 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees & cheesecake and the total was around 80? which was expected. We specifically came to order the birthday cake cheesecake and were NOT disappointed!! :)"
Cortney A.,"North Las Vegas, NV",55,155,540,4.0,3/4/2017,"[Cheesecake Coma] Who doesn't love an exaggerated size slice of cheesecake? My girls and I stopped by last night around 10ish. It's was pretty empty. The service was delayed the entire visit. We had to continuously ask to order beverages dessert food and the bill. I get it it's late but they're open until midnight and guest should expect the same level of service until the restaurant closes.  The food and desert quality did not disappoint. Each dish ordered was exceptional and served promptly!  A few of the many items ordered were Tuna Tartare (so good omg), dynamite shrimp and various desserts!  $100 later we are satisfied until next time!"
Echo B.,"Las Vegas, NV",141,121,341,4.0,8/1/2017,"I came here 2 days in a row for national cheesecake day and half price cheesecake. I was going to write my review Sunday, but I'm glad I waited because my Sunday experience was HORRIBLE, like 2 star bad, but my Monday experience was great, 5 star great. I averaged them out to give this review.  Sunday: We came in for cheesecake, but since we had to dine in, we git some breakfast that I didn't know they served on Sundays. The service we got the whole time was absolutely horrible. There weren't many people there when we got there so we didn't wait long to be seated. She brought us water and that was about it. The rest of the time we had to keep flagging her down to get anything from her. It took 15 minutes to get our coffee and actually order our food. Then she never came back. It took 30 minutes before we could flag her down to actually get us some bread that we had to actually ask for when everybody else was just given their bread. She was definitely not off to a good start. She kept going back and forth to the table next to us, giving them stuff and checking on them, but never came to us, unless we actually flagged her down and yelled for her. To me, that's not acceptable customer service. It almost made us not ever want to come back here. Only reason we came back, was to get more half price cheesecake the next day. We made sure we weren't going to get her the next day again, by sitting at the bar on Monday. Monday: We strictly went to the bar in hopes we'd get better service. We certainly did. We initially came for happy hour drinks and cheesecake, but ended up ordering some appetizers for dinner since the happy hour menu is pretty cheap. Thank god we had good service at the bar or we probably never would've went back. Our bartender was always checking on us to see if we needed anything, constantly refilling our drinks, conversating with us, after everybody was taken care of. We even got our bread this time right away and didn't even have to ask for it. And to top it off, we got great service during happy hour when the whole place was packed and every seat was taken.  Now, onto the actual food.  For breakfast, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles Benedict and the chilaquiles carnitas. I really enjoyed the Benedict. It definitely had a unique sweet flavor that I wasn't expecting, but it was delicious. The carnitas was a bed of tortilla chips with a green chilli pork mix over them. I wasn't a fan of them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them. We also ordered their new cheesecakes: the celebration cheesecake and the coffee and cream cheesecake. The celebration one wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It was SUPER sweet. My complaint is that there was very little cheesecake in it. It was almost all cake and a cream mousse stuff. I was hoping it was going to be majority cheesecake, but it wasn't. I can't say that is order it again. The coffee and cream one, was very chocolatey with coffee. If you like those two flavors, you'll like that cheesecake.  For happy hour, I started off with the JW pink lemonade that was pretty good. We ordered 3 appetizers to share: Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, factory nachos and the buffalo blasts. They were all great. You won't be disappointed with any of them. They are pretty big servings so be careful how much you order. We couldn't even finish the nachos. Then we ordered cheesecake to go because there was no way we had room to eat there. We got the chocolate hazelnut crunch, Chris' outrageous, mango key lime and Reeses peanut butter. I didn't like Chris' because I don't like coconut or walnuts, but if you like them and almond joy, you'll love that one. My boyfriend loved it so much, he ate the whole thing in one sitting. I really enjoyed the other three tho. The hazelnut crunch is really good. The Reeses is really rich, but great if you like chocolate and peanut butter. The mango cheesecake us really tart, but great if you like those flavors."
Keilyn C.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,91,170,4.0,8/8/2017,I came here to try the celebration cheesecake! I've had my eye on it for a while and it exceeded my expectations and beyond! The cheesecake tasted like ice cream that never melted. I hope this cheesecake stays on the menu and will be back for more.
Sheila G.,"Las Vegas, NV",489,690,1218,3.0,1/10/2017,"Arrghhh, I hit a key accidentally and my almost-complete review disappeared!  To re-create: It was senile dementia that brought us to the Cheesecake Factory.  Let me explain: Friends were visiting from CA, and after we sat around drinking wine and munching on cheese and crackers, we turned to the serious problem of where to go for dinner.  The couple has been to Vegas often, but mostly in the SW valley, where their son lives.  Herb came up with the brilliant suggestion to go to Mixx, and I readily agreed, thinking it would be something different for them. We were presented with menus and water, and as I was explaining the bowl concept to them, I suddenly had a Duh! moment, and realized that the very next night we were going to meet a group of neighbors for Happy Hour in this very restaurant.  We had already decided that at HH we'd order two Fresh Market big bowls instead of the HH apps, so that we could take home leftovers, my favorite meal.  But we didn't remember any of that when we set out for Mixx.  We certainly weren't going to do that two nights in a row.  So, completely chagrined, we told the waitress we'd see her tomorrow night.  Cheesecake Factory, being right next door, was the obvious substitute, since we didn't want to start thinking all over again. All four of us ordered from the Skinnylicious menu, probably in atonement for the excesses of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.  Our friend had the Flatbread with Pear and Blue Cheese, and loved it.  His wife had the Lettuce Wraps, picking the Asian ""tacos.""  The dish looked beautiful, and she enjoyed it. My husband ordered a Turkey and Avocado sandwich, which came on a bun with a bowl of salad, and he liked his, too. And then there was me, deciding on the skinny version of the Turkey Burger. Wanting a change from buns, I chose the wheat baguette. And ranch on the side for my salad.  As soon as my fork touched the burger, it fell apart, but it tasted okay.  But that wheat baguette was no wheat baguette.  It was more like pumpernickel, and it was SWEET!  So were the caramelized onions - adding sugar is a sloppy shortcut for the slow cooking that renders them naturally sweet.  My salad didn't come with the ranch dressing I asked for.  Instead, it had the house dressing already on it.  Lots of it.  When the waiter brought a new salad and the ranch, that dressing turned out to be strangely sweet, too.  Sweet ranch??? Yuk, and yuk also for the salad, which was a sizable portion, but completely different from the one my husband got.  Not my kind of mix. Service was impersonally okay, but just average.  Three of us four liked what we ordered.  I'm the outlier, but I'm the one writing the review, so I get to give it three stars.  And I'm being generous."
Angelo C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,1,5.0,12/29/2017,"A few weeks ago, I came here for the first time and thought it was amazing. Most places give you a tiny personal pizza and you end up still hungry. Because of this, I ordered a personal pizza and chicken tenders. I was wrong and a big, still warm pizza came with large chicken tenders and fries. I ended up having to take most of it home. The wait for our food was a bit long but we had delicious bread at our table along with butter. 10/10 would go there again."
Mel B.,"Las Vegas, NV",155,115,282,4.0,11/22/2016,Not my first time at this location: service is always very knowledgeable (their menu is a novel)  The server was very busy when we got there so he created us and said he would be right back. Got our drinks and then let us decide.  We ordered the artichoke crab dip (came out hot) but it wAs a tad too fishy.  I definitely think the wine prices are WAY too high for the name brand they are selling. We spent $50 in drinks and only had two a piece. We both ordered the ribeye and was cooked perfect!! I always get their grilled asparagus (fantastic) instead of green beans.  UP charge btw The bread basket they give u is also fresh and warm.  So full at the end I had to take cake home. We will be back but not soon. Just so pricey for two.
Jenna T.,"Las Vegas, NV",167,74,120,5.0,4/24/2017,"We like to come to Cheese Cake Factory on our cheat days. Nothing better than enjoying a large portion entree and a sweet cheesecake for dinner.   Today we came in and were served by Isaiah. What an amazing server! He was very energetic and paid attention to small details that separate good servers from superior servers. The service staff here at the Boca Park location is 90% great but today was extraordinary. Even after our server got sat another table after us and a party of 10 at the same time, our experience was never sacrificed. Our drinks were never empty, our order came out prompt and we were never in need of anything.  Tonight we ordered iced green tea with mint, the chicken marsala and chipotle chicken pasta but we substituted the pasta for mashed potatoes. And for dessert we shared a lemon, strawberry cheesecake.  Chicken marsala is 2 thin pieces of chicken in a homemade marsala sauce with a generous portion of mushrooms. This is served on a bed of bow tie pasta. The chipotle chicken pasta is a flavorful dish with asparagus, peas and chicken in a warm chipotle sauce. It's not spicy and does not lack in flavor. The portion of chicken is on the lighter side though. All entrees are served with both sourdough and wheat bread with butter at the beginning of your meal too. There are so many desserts to choose from but tonight we went with one on the fruity side. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. I was actually surprised how balanced the flavors were."
John Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",59,45,43,1.0,6/18/2017,"So I assumed since I had a such a bad experience about one month ago I wrote a review. However, i must not of.  Let's start with my little brother's girlfriends graduation dinner from UNLV. A party of 8, service was good, the server was attentive and had everything going for her when it came to her tables.  The food, well, how can you mess up a burger medium? It can be done, and I was done this night.  As they were swamped, I knew better than to ask for a remake, it would have taken them one hour for a burger.  No worries the dessert made up for the crappy food.  Now today, 6/18, as it was not my choice to go, I went back because my brother's girlfriend loves it there. Issac was our server, really good server, but the length of time to get two basic meals was not good. I did not order as I got there late, and my brother was waiting 1 hour for tacos and some other quick making food.  The patrons to the side of us, who came in after him and right before I,  received their food beforehand. As both my brother and I come from a hospitality owned establishment, this is not what we excepted.  This is not the normal Cheesecake Factory expectations, at least from the east coast. I know I will not be returning to this one ever again. Furthermore, I will make sure no one visits this one when they come to visit."

John M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,103,1.0,10/1/2017,"It's hard to believe that a company as large & well known as Cheesecake Factory would allow their restaurants to be Deceitful, Dishonest and Cheat their loyal customers!  See my posted photo of receipt from my last visit to Cheesecake Factory, Boca Park location. Though it's only a suggested gratuity, they Deceitfully suggest you tip on the taxed amount. Almost every other restaurants I visit only suggest tip on actual food & beverages as it's supposed to be. I usually tip 22 - 25% of amount & sometimes glance at these numbers to help determine my tipping amount. I noticed this before but now have to speak out because of continued use of this misleading practice. If this happens to you Yelpers at other Cheesecake locations, please post a review to warn others of the Dishonest Billing practice being used by Cheesecake Factory! 5 Stars for Food 4.5 Stars for Service ""0"" Stars for Billing Practice"
Christine P.,"Las Vegas, NV",186,95,640,2.0,3/16/2017,"We went by last night to give this location another try and it was not a good experience, in fact it was worse. I handed our waiter, David N., the letter which still had the gift card attached to it (you guys sent us a $45 gift card to give you another try). In the letter it states that the manager would like to know we are there and they could make sure our experience was a better one and would like to meet us. This did not happen, the waiter stood there and read the letter so I don't know if it was waiter who did not inform management or they just didn't want to come out, but we were never approached by any manager.   We ordered the eggroll sampler and it was just put in front of us with no explanation of the sauces (never have we ordered any of the eggrolls). We had to go back through the menu to read the individual eggroll descriptions to try and figure this out the sauces but I still don't think we got it right. Now, of course this isn't the biggest deal so we just let it go.  My friend ordered the grilled fish tacos with no marinated onions and instead cooked onions with no chipotle sauce (she's very sensitive to heat) and to have that replaced with your creama (from the ""slim"" menu). She received her dinner and there was no creama, just chipIotle sauce, a very minimal amount of grilled onions (a taco had ONE small strip) ZERO avocado (as it states on the menu its served with it)  and somehow there was a pickled cabbage?? (it's not stated thats on the tacos on the menu) We asked the server if they could remake it and at this point we are getting very frustrated with the service and food. I had to ask for my coke and her water to be refilled MANY times despite the waiter always walking around. I was genuinely flabbergasted I had to ask for refills with how much he was walking by.  So, by now, after already a long wait to receive our food to begin with (the restaurant was not busy by any means from what we could tell) we had to wait another 15 minutes for her food to be remade, so my boyfriend and I stopped eating out of courtesy.  45 mins after we ordered our food, we FINALLY got to eat together and of course my boyfriends and I's dinner was cold. My friend STILL then had a problem with her order (the tortillas were not cooked) but by then we were so hungry we didnt say anything.  Now, here comes the time to pay. After the waiter took the $45 gift card off the total, the remaining balance of the bill was $42 and change. I only had twenties and my friend had her debit card. So, we told the waiter for $20.00 on the card and I put down two twenty dollar bills. David, our waiter, brought back the receipts with no change! Never EVER had I had a waiter just assume the remaining change was theirs and pocket my cash. He never asked if we needed change to verify it was his, he just took it! I asked for it back and he mumbled an apology about be busy or whatnot (which none of us believed, he was making excuses all night and the place WASN'T busy).  For this trying to be a make-up from last time for the burnt food and bad food, you guys SERIOUSLY missed again. I don't know if it's this location or whatever but we are very unsatisfied with the service and food and that the manager wasn't around to make sure our dining experience was better than the last. I really enjoyed you guys, but at this rate my friend says she NEVER wants to come back and I don't blame her!!!"
Kristin B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,21,1,5.0,12/4/2017,I came here with my friends and it didn't take long to get seated. I love their extensive menu. I ordered a flatbread off the Skinnylicious menu and it was delicious! Dessert was great as well. Our server was fantastic. Great service and great food - I highly recommend this location.
Danette W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",108,181,301,4.0,4/14/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has an awesome happy hour. The menu is limited which is usually the case for happy hour but the choices are really good. Oh and the drinks....Really good. There were three of us so we decided we'd order three appetizers between us. We got cheeseburger sliders, nachos, and Vietnamese shrimp spring rolls. Everything was delicious and our waitress also brought us out the signature bread and butter. So good. For drinks we had mojitos and Long Island ice teas. Both delicious. Atmosphere is great. I love your happy hour Cheesecake Factory. Thanks for a great experience."
Michelle T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",5,52,34,4.0,4/10/2017,What a wonderful dining experience  here and our server was great. Unfortunately my meal was just subpar. I had ordered fish & chips and the fish was soggy wish they were crunchier... my birthday cheesecake was AWESOME!!
Dante F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",233,48,,5.0,8/16/2017,"I use to work at Boca Park and never ate here, but recently I decided to give it a try... several times.  The bacon truffle cheese sticks are in my order every single time. I've tried a couple of different burgers. All were seasoned very well and cooked perfectly. Their cheesecake is great, but the best option is the Oreo cheesecake.  I ordered delivery so I'm not sure what it's like inside of the restaurant, but I'm sure the food is probably even better without the long ride for delivery."
Chris I.,"Hot Springs National Park, AR",16,86,430,3.0,1/26/2017,"Food here is always delicious. I got two different types of cakes and the red velvet cheesecake. It was delicious. However, servers behind the counter ignored me while they were gossiping on the other side of the counter. I almost left had it not been for my parents. It was very rude that they kept me waiting while there were three servers on the other side just talking their heads off. With this hopefully they would be more attentive to customers!"
Claude R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,100,17,1.0,7/30/2017,We went for lunch yesterday and it was truly a disappointing experience.  I had a lunch portion of one of the pastas. There was three small pieces of chicken over powered by the mushrooms which tasted a little burnt.  The lunch portion appears to be around half the size for almost the full price. The portion size wasn't an issue since the food was not palatable. It wasn't a good value at all.  My wife got a salad off the new light menu and it was basically just lots of lettuce.  Service was slow. We had to ask for refills many times and were never offered a refill unless we asked.
Heavenor H.,"Henderson, NV",4,4,2,5.0,11/7/2017,Happy hour here is hands down the best Happy Hour during the week!!! My top three appetizers are the Buffalo Blasts which is a best kept secret at this restaurant! Avocado egg rolls are great to share but I've been known to keep these all to myself and last but not least the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes!
Jerry Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,2,1,2.0,8/28/2017,Ordered a well done classic burger  made it clear when I ordered I wanted it well done. I said actually very well done. Server said no problem.  Not even close to well done. Told her about. No refund no offer to redo it. Very poor experience will not return
