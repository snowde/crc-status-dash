Semi F.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,45,24,5.0,8/19/2015,I was here only for dessert but i'm really upset to miss dinner. Everything was amazing but i wanted to try their main courses because they looked amazing. Our server Daniel is the one of the best (no doubt!) he took care of my table perfectly. Thanks for everything...
Scott E.,"Bayport, NY",122,239,120,2.0,8/15/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been a staple in my wife and I's dining out habits. However, the last time we went to dinner we had a really disappointing experience. We brought her family that were in town from Germany so that they could finally experience this Cheesecake Factory place we tell them about somewhat frequently. To start, our waiter was the definition of a tool. I hate to be mean, but his name might as well have been Tony tough nuts. He tried to be nice, but the vibe from him just was not good. What's worse is he forgot drinks for 15 minutes at a time, and would remember when I asked about them. He took FOREVER to take our initial order, despite me asking and him walking past quite a few times. Just in general, bad vibe. Then comes the food. Service is forgivable when the food is amazing. This time, it was not. We decided to get the Guacamole since we recently had some at El Dorado and we were craving some again. They brought it to the table, and we quickly realized that it was HUGE chunks of Avocado, and not ripe avocado at that. It was hard and stringy. So I asked the waiter to send it back since, ya know, we couldn't even dip chips in it because it was like half an avocado at a time. He brings it back, and says...yeah just so you know that's how we do the guacamole now, so if you want it more mashed up you have to specify. REALLY?! It's a DIP, not pieces of apple you're eating. The thing is, with this guy, he could have been making it up since he was that type of person. he also tried to blame the bar on the drinks, then clearly went and put it in the computer since he forgot (we could see the bar and the computer right next to us). Anyway, my four cheese pasta came out luke warm and cold on the outsides, but by this point I said screw it, I ate some of it and too the rest home to heat up the next day.  Overall it was a bad experience, and I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. Gordon Biersch is always consistent for us, as is Brio, so we'll probably just go there."
Alicia R.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",5,1,,1.0,8/16/2016,Literally took like 30 min to bring my drinks and took like another 30 to get out food order and the whole time I had to call the server over to get me a refill. The food was good but the service was ridiculous.
Suzy Q.,"San Martin, CA",8,309,18,4.0,1/28/2016,Chicken Madeira & Steak Diane combo Yummy. Subbed the mash potatoes for asparagus. A minor faux pas- The beef medallions weren't cooked evenly: 2 pieces were medium rare and one medium.  3.5 stars Lemon raspberry cheesecake my fave. It has lady fingers at the bottom. 4 stars The service was good and then went into the toilet when the server got another table of diners. 3 stars
Alyssa L.,"Woodbridge, VA",48,107,23,3.0,10/20/2015,"The food and service was great as usual. The wait wasn't long at all. It was a nice night we chose to sit outside on the patio since it doesn't happen much. My big issue is they have a smoking bench right outside the patio (which was less than 10 ft from my table), so while trying to enjoy my dinner I had cigarette smoke blowing right in mine and my toddlers face. It totally ruined my dinner and I left feeling like I needed a breathing treatment."
Michael N.,"North Las Vegas, NV",99,125,436,4.0,12/21/2015,"I always liked Cheese Cake Factory, but never loved it.  The food is good and reasonably priced, and service usually very good.  But for some reason I don't comprehend why it's always busy... esp on a Sunday night like last night with over 20 people waiting while all the tables were still full as we left.  I had the BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato fries.  There was a bit too much sauce, but the cole slaw helped tame the OD of sassy richness.  Overall, I give my meal last night ""thumbs up"".  Any cheesecake for dessert is a must with a multitude of selections to choose from.  Peace!"
Lulu E.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,68,29,2.0,6/2/2016,"Whatever you do, just go to a different CCF location. Don't get the server Victoria P. My order was messed up; food quality was awful. Although my friend enjoyed her food. I won't be back. HOWEVER, the manager Sean was very kind, that is why I gave it 2 stars. If it weren't for him, it's give ZERO stars. THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED AT MCDONALDS!!"
Nichole C.,"Turlock, CA",17,23,10,3.0,1/10/2016,Wowwww I've been to cheesecake since I was 18 in la.  We go to Boca bout 1x a month.  Place to-Go's OFTEN  THEY MUST HAVE A NEW PERSON ON PHONES.!!! Asked questions she didn't know answers to.  I was stuck.  I just settled for regular order. Chick couldn't explain items or food!!! Really bad phone service. I called  Sunday January 10 @2:10pm
Chuck H.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,55,54,4.0,11/5/2014,Always great food and good service Waiters are all very well trained and food is always up to top standards so you know what to expect Prices are reasonable and that damn cheesecake at the end is fantastic
Violet W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,2,4.0,5/9/2015,"It was prom night and bridal party night so fairly busy, yet our server was ver accommodating, seating us (just me & my husband on a quiet night out) in a fairly secluded booth for privacy.  The bread was mostly great.  The pumpernickel was absolutely delicious but the sourdough (was that what it was) was too hard and dry to bite into. No points lost there however, as some people enjoy crusty bread like that. His kobe burger was cooked perfectly (he asked for rare) and my luau salad was consistently delicious, as it is whenever I get it. Always plenty to take home. We ordered banana cream cheesecake and chocolate tuxedo cheesecake to go so I won't know how they are until later. All in all a good experience. Friendly, accommodating staff (they happily brought us more bread when asked) and a comfortable environment. The music was a touch loud but I guess that's how most restsurants have it these days. It privides a bit of an auditory veil between us & other diners."
Ashley W.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,40,18,4.0,8/14/2016,"This location is always busy and you can get easily overlooked if you aren't efficient when asking for the next thing you need when your server comes- for example when they take your drink order and come back with drinks you should be ready to order, when they check on how the food is you should ask for box/order cheesecake.  When they bring boxes or cheesecake ask for the check. The food is great here, very consistent. Love the Oreo dream cheesecake, fried macaroni and cheese, chicken piccata, banana cheesecake etc."
Steven P.,"Las Vegas, NV",84,34,4,3.0,7/14/2015,"The Avocado Appetizer if phenomenal! The reason for the 3 star review is due to the wait time when we came in with the family at 7PM. We were told it was 20mim wait, however after the 40min wait we decided to go up to the hostess and were seated upon complaining. Upon going to our table, we saw so many tables that were empty and ready to serve hungry customers. The food was great, however like most places the pasta dishes are served with about 2lbs of pasta and 5 pieces of chicken. The best part of the meal were the appetizers, the dessert, and the service."
Carmen S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,31,,2.0,8/14/2017,We were given a gift card. We first went on Sunday afternoon. I was a madhouse w/ a 45 min wait. We went to Hoosong's instead (which was great). We went back to the CF this afternoon & it was not very busy at all with whole sections unused but we still had to wait 10 min for a table. We told the waiter that we would need time to look over the menu. He brought water but no bread. We ordered but didn't get the bread until just minutes before our entrees arrived. My beer was forgotten about & after a reminder it arrive when I was half finished. My wife's plate was taken to be wrapped & forgotten about but was bought out after another reminder. We split a pice of cheesecake but couldn't finish it because it was sooooo overly sweet. Other than that the food was about average for a Marie Callender's but twice the price. Overall bad experience for which I was glad not to have to pay (but it was a pretty bad gift).

Debby W.,"Las Vegas, NV",3433,324,388,5.0,6/7/2015,"Wow... My best experiences ever at a Cheesecake Factory...  It was a wonderful night & a great experience, thanks to our server... I have to call the restaurant & get her name as that is something I many times fall short about... Names:(  So I called her ""Blue Eyes"" during our dinner experience as she is a brown haired girl with brilliant blue eyes. She was very good natured... She smiled and laughed when I called her that and seemed to be ok with my nickname.  ""Blue Eyes"" arrived at our table immediately after we were seated & she took our beverage order... She was very welcoming & understanding as we explained that we were waiting for one more person who was joining us for dinner. So many times, servers can be put off by this... ""Blue Eyes"" was not having any issue with us having a late addition to our table.   After we enjoyed our first adult beverage, which was delivered to us exactly as ordered... I decided that for my next beverage, I would prefer mine without ice.  ""Blue Eyes"" was so pleasant and non-resistant.  She brought my drink out exactly as I had requested it. She was helpful & conversational, while respecting our privacy.  She made great suggestions and was so encouraging about several fished which we asked about.   The kale salad was scrumptious!!! We also ordered the Thai lettuce chicken platter. It is a Taste Blast and we actually ordered a second portion.  Bang Bang Shrimp/Chicken is always sensational here, but we were stuffed and did not have any room for more food!  An ahi tuna carpaccio was another delightful, tasty treat.  Whatever sauce they used was lavished on top with some beautiful slices of avocado & cucumber thinly sliced on the side.  Desert was of course cheesecake... I know the many flavors of cheesecake are supposed to delight me... This was chocolate & not my taste, although everyone else loved it.  Me... I Love their plain New York type cheesecake with some cherries or strawberries on top.  Yum classically delicious.  We had a Lovely time and I will post this as soon as I find out the name of our server who we will ask for when we return to this great local restaurant.  Ahhhhhh.... Her name is a Mystery... I called there & the hostess who answered the phone was zero help.  My bad for not getting her name:("
Princess T.,"Las Vegas, NV",63,15,5,1.0,7/30/2016,"It's National Cheesecake Day today so, of course, we weren't going to pass up the half-off cheesecakes at The Cheesecake Factory! My family and I were in the area so we decided to get our cheesecake fix at this location. I asked my husband to go in with our son to purchase our cheesecakes while our daughter and I stay in the car. When he came back he told me that the cashier ""Diana"" had charged him the third slice at regular price because there was only two of them in the restaurant, but she didn't tell him ahead of time that there was a limit of one per customer. Last year I was able to purchase three cheesecakes by myself at another location. Anyway, it would've been fine if he could only purchase the two at half-off, but this cashier should've informed him if they had a limit so he didn't have to go through the trouble of returning it. Such poor customer service. And he even left tip in her empty tip jar! But just now after reading the others reviews from the past month, I guess I shouldn't be surprised of this location's very poor customer service. Needless to say, we won't be going back to this location."
Bret H.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,9,1,2.0,7/30/2016,I could probably give 3 stars but I'm just not pleased with the experience we just had. Usually it is good but not today. Apparently they only have 4 high chairs in the whole restaurant at this location. If you don't have any toddlers with you you will probably have a good experience. We tried to speak with the manager but he was too busy to come talk to us. We tried to make a booster seat work but it was our granddaughters first time in one so she was having a hard time trying it out. Then they started seating more customers right next to us so instead of disrupting the people around us we decided to leave. We stopped by the hostess stand to try to talk to the manager one more time but he was still too busy to talk to us. We walked down the way to Kona Grill and are having a pleasant experience with a high chair.
Chris K.,"Las Vegas, NV",57,31,,5.0,7/27/2016,I know it's been a long time but this is the first time I have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory This place had a very nice ambiance and had a steady flow Had the steak tacos was very enjoyable And the portion my bigger then I expected The service was good and very attentive My only complaint about this place is the menu is pretty overwhelming and extensive But I will definitely be returning
Sarah H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,2,2.0,7/24/2016,"Normally the Cheesecake Factory doesn't disappoint, however, this evening the service was abysmal and the food was mediocre at best.  Firstly my boyfriend and I were clearly ahead of two other groups of two who were seated before us. We had a show to attend after and budgeted two hours for dinner so we asked for first available seating knowing it would be on the patio. The table we were seated at was filthy and there were leaves in my table setting. The server was manic and obviously under trained and over worked. Long story short drinks (not from the bar) took 15 minutes to get to our table, we had to ask for a sugar caddy 4 times, and we didn't see our entrees until 50 minutes later. The manager was condescending when he brought our food because of the obvious disaster. He stated that he thought we had only been waiting 24 minutes! Basically calling my boyfriend a liar. We do know exactly how long it took because we went through two Pokemon Go incense packs and a lure waiting for our meal. The only good part of this dining experience was having the time to sit and talk uninterrupted because our server didn't seem to be bothered to check up on us."
E O.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,2.0,2/12/2017,"The food is good here but never try and call in a to-go order, you're just wasting your time on the phone. Tried to call ahead and was on hold for 17 minutes. Soon as I walked in the door the girl casually picks up the phone. I understand things can get busy but to be on hold almost 20 minutes and not have my order taken is unacceptable. This was on 2/12/17 around 2:30 pm."
