Kekoa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,28,92,5.0,11/16/2016,Excellent service! The selection is overwhelming and I couldn't decide which cheesecake I wanted. I ended up ordering 2 slices for me and 2 slices for my husband. We had our dog out in the car and I asked the folks at the counter if they had anything dog friendly and they put whipped cream in a plastic cup for him! (Our order was to go.) Shoutout to Jelani B. (Jay) and Luz H. For your pawsome service!
Tony R.,"Henderson, NV",2,1,,1.0,6/28/2017,I love cheesecake factory YIELD do not go to this location. I stressed I am vegetarian and ordered my create my own pasta with veggies. When my dish came they had put chicken in it which would have made me so sick I would have thrown up all night I'm allergic told them I'm vegan and they put chicken it still do NOT trust this location. Trust me you won't get what you order never had this bad of an experience RUUUN!!
Heidi N.,"San Diego, CA",1,22,4,4.0,6/26/2017,"Great location, beautiful atmosphere and wonderful service. The parking was congested at 5:00, but there is free valet. The only complaint is that the food wasn't quite as good as the location I usually frequent, but to be fair, I was only here once."
Darrian G.,"Henderson, NV",708,45,17,4.0,11/10/2016,"My partner and I eat here at least 2-3 times a month and absolutely love it every time. We typically start with the crispy crab wontons. They are amazing, filled with crab, green onions and of course, cream cheese. Although they are deep fried, the sweet chili sauce on the side makes them irresistible. Bread service is always great. We usually only ask for the wheat bread with butter, but we were introduced to the white bread with olive oil. AMAZING. The fiancé had a flat bread with dollops of ricotta, and I had a Caesar salad with my favorite carbonara pasta! Desert was missed because we were so stuffed but our waiter Sean was absolutely amazing. Our drinks were never refilled but his personality was excellent. He remembered everything we told him without having to write it all down in a book like most people do. That was pretty impressive because we are pretty picky."
Jenni L.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,10,4,2.0,9/19/2017,"Let me start off by saying i am pregnant & can eat very limited things. My pregnancy by far has been hard due to the fact that my baby does not like much food. So when i have to order from different restaurants every day due to an actual craving, i expect to get what i pay for & ordered. I ordered a cuban sandwich specifically bc there are pickles in it. I go pick up my order, drive all the way back home bc i am not down the street, to find not only did they put no pickles but also didn't put mustard. This doesn't taste like a cuban sandwich at all now, it tastes like a panini from panera bread, plain."
Gloria M.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,10,4,5.0,5/27/2017,"I received a Cheesecake Factory gift card from work and I'm so glad we decided to use it tonight! We were served by Dan and he was so friendly and accommodating. Our drinks never ran empty and our food came out fresh and at the perfect time. I was very impressed by how Dan handled our experience even when he had a large group there for Prom. He asked all the right questions and even made sure to bring out share plates and utensils. We had a bowl of the loaded baked potato soup which was delicious and served hot without that film on top you may see. For our entree we shared the Louisiana Chicken Pasta which was so tasty! Those two items combined with the hot fresh bread filled us up. Next time, we will follow Dan's suggestion and start with dessert!"
Lena H.,"Redding, CA",0,45,4,4.0,6/9/2017,"This location is great.  They are always clean and friendly.  They also have valet on weekends, starting on Friday nights which is helpful because this is a busy location with other shops that make parking busy.  The food is always awesome here.  Have had many items, like the avocado egg rolls, they come out hot and yummy.  The salads are always fresh here.  The filet was cooked perfectly as requested and the sides were great too.  Even though this place is busy and a bit noisy because of the crowd, the outside seating is quieter.  Our party also had the Chicken Mediera; it was very good as well.  Our party had multiple cheesecakes to share and they were ALL yummy! Service is always good here."
Traci W.,"The Lakes, Las Vegas, NV",62,2,,1.0,2/26/2017,"HORRIBLE!  The service is horrible, the food is mediocre and now three of us have food poisoning!!  Do NOT eat here!  We ordered curbside, waited an hour for our food.  I paid with ""cake pay"". The server argued with me stating I hadn't paid, had to wait another 15 minutes for her to figure it out.  Now my 7 year old and 13 year old have vomited multiple times all over their beds, carpet and respective bathrooms and I have had diarrhea for an hour!  Either the incompetent staff intentionally did something to make us sick (because I complained about the excessive wait) or it's a terrible coincidence because we all ordered different items.  We are big fans of the Cheesecake Factory but this particular location has failed multiple times with us, this final time being the worst and the last!"
Michele C.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,30,,5.0,11/10/2016,Very nice staff and my guest loved her Parmesan Pasta. I had a yummy crisp green salad with delicious blue cheese dressing. A basket of different styles of bread was included. For a chain property I think they did a great job !!! Cheesecakes looked amazing but we passed on this visit. Just might go back and enjoy a slice.
Jennifer R.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,33,63,5.0,3/23/2017,"Service is awesome. Food is splendid, much better quality than the other cheesecake factory I've been in. Love it!"
Jamie A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,1,4.0,4/19/2017,"A bit pricey, but the food was great and the portions were really big! The bacon burger was juicy and very flavorful.  I will have it again."
Diana D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,21,,4.0,8/1/2016,"I like their food,but they always forget condiments when it comes to pick up..always forget to put in the bag the butter, ketchup, ranch or other condiments I ask for"
Kent T.,"Palm Springs, CA",335,419,202,4.0,1/5/2016,"Here is my guilty confession, I like Cheesecake Factory! There I said it!  I have enjoyed my experiences at everyone that I have gone to. Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and now the one at Boca Park! Went in for dinner and was seated right away.  After combing through the GIGANTIC menu. and it is! So many tempting options! I decided to go lighter, to save room for the ....you guessed it CHEESECAKE!! Hell YA! Sorry, but here the entree is just an appetizer for desert.  Ordered the herb crusted salmon, served with fresh mashed potatoes and a few tasteful displayed spears of asparagus. It was really great! Cooked perfectly, light tender and moist. My friend ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (OK, not so light for him, but he loved it!) Then we split a Red Velvet cheesecake. OMG...We were in cheesy, frosted, sugary heaven!! SO GOOD! And splitting this giant piece was absolutely the right call!"
Lucille G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,42,5,1.0,5/24/2017,"First, we arrived at the restaurant and had to wait because the whole middle section of the restaurant wasn't ""open"".  We were on our lunch hour so ended up sitting in the bar.  Tons of empty tables, just not ""open"" during lunch rush?  Didn't make sense to me. Second, I ordered the Thai chicken tacos (letttuce wrapped) and bit into something that I thought was a bone.  I spit it out and it was a piece of wood.  The manager said ""Oh, that's the skewer that we use to hold the chicken together while it's cooking"".  Nothing else, no apology, nothing.   Then, when my friend paid - the waitress rounded off the bill and brought the change back but it was rounded off in the server's favor, not the customer's.  Love this restaurant.  Have been there tons and tons through the years, but I think service is going downhill."
Bryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",78,357,149,4.0,1/9/2016,They reached out to us and made it right. That counts for a lot in my book. We revisited them again and the service wasn't as hectic and disorganized as before. We were promptly seated and the food was good as usual. I only wish they wouldn't arrange their tables so closely together. People are thrusting butts and crotches in faces everywhere trying to squeeze in. Awkward.
Celine E.,"Las Vegas, NV",379,14,3,5.0,9/18/2016,My family and I go to Cheesecake factory often and we always go to this location. I am very surprised this location only has a 3 and a half stars. I just finished brunch with my family. We had Matt as our server and he was fantastic! He was prompt with our requests and he had a positive attitude. Thank you!
Michelle A.,"Las Vegas, NV",467,116,722,3.0,1/4/2017,The ahi salad was the best I ever had. Sadly my husband's Cobb salad looked like they scraped other people's leftovers in the to go box. We did not dine in. If I realized what a mess that salad was before I got home I would not have took it. This was my husband's first time eating Cheesecake Factory food. I won't be able to get him to go back.
Larry K.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,11,3,1.0,1/31/2017,"Waited over an hour for a table while people were being seated that came in after us. I saw two other party's leave because they had to wait. The hostess was bitchy, never once smiled nor did she have any type of customer service skills. Be on the lookout for Alexis the rude hostess. The manager; Caesar, had no idea how to handle customer service either. When he told us the hostess made a mistake he never apologized and just simply said you will have to wait. WOW. We have been going to this restaurant for many years. People don't return because of the poor service and treatment and you can count us out. We won't be back."
Uncle F.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,101,4,3.0,3/20/2017,This place drops in my book each time we go there. 90% of the time the floors are so slippery to walk on. 9 out of 10 times my pasta is always dry from sitting before they serve.   Service is off big time
Carol K.,"Las Vegas, NV",242,855,3812,5.0,12/28/2014,"This place amazes me, they are usually so busy, timing is very important, you come at just the right time and they get you in and taken care of!  Usually we can wait less than 10-15 minutes for a table, by the time we leave it's a mad house. Waiting times up to 45 minutes. We learned to come just before the rush or come late, after the crowds, either way, service is still good! We never feel rushed, our service is always great and the food is consistent. Love the +30 cheesecakes to choose from. Be it a holiday, weekend, or weekday, they really make you feel satisfied. My favorite new dish this time was the soy glazed edamame! It's spicy, it's slighty sweet, it's warm and very good!"
