John H.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,28,11,4.0,5/24/2016,"Went for lunch today and Jessica took care of us in a most pleasant and friendly manner.  I had the calamari (shocker) so good, Ultimate Margarita always amazing.  Lunch size pizza and salad which was good, the pizza crust could have been a little more crisp.  The hot fudge sundae is sure to please, smiles from ear to ear.  I believe they even sell the hot fudge at the bakery counter. My only concern was for some reason we had a swarm of flies around our table in the section we were sitting (indoors.)  We wanted to dine outdoors but they said it was too windy.   Still left satisfied and content.  Thanks Jessica :)"
Sasha A.,"Las Vegas, NV",193,150,782,4.0,2/14/2016,"Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite places to dine at. They always meet these expectations; High quality, good tasting food, excellent beverages, very good service, and a classy ambiance. You normally have to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. There's a very good reason why people wait that long to be seated.  Based on my experience from yesterday, I had to give them four, instead of five stars. We were told there was a 40 minute wait, which seemed to be pretty accurate. I noticed that they wasted a lot of time, and energy on trying to find 4 or 5 parties who had obviously left. On several occasions they walked through the bar, waiting area, and exterior of the restaurant calling these people's names. A more efficient way of handling it would be to activate the buzzer, walk through once or twice calling their names, then move on. I felt our server wasn't very friendly, and a bit slow. The food was very good. I would highly recommend the crab bites, and the Steak Diane With Salmon Combination. The fried zucchini was okay... They were good, just not excellent. I was impressed at how clean the bathroom was, based on how busy they were.  I would definitely return to this Cheesecake Factory again. I would also recommend people eat there as well."
Jose H.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,2,9,2.0,3/15/2017,"Place is good, love the atmosphere  great location .sad the service is bad our waitress was hard to be found  food quality  poor I have the chicken Marcella my son hade Louisiana chicken  pasta was hard to chew no flavor sorry to say it I'm a food lover and I love to cook but the only good thing is the desserts  good I give you that"
Cindy L.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,16,,1.0,9/3/2017,"I have been to this location about 6 times. WELL, after my most recent 2 visits, I will NOT go back to this one. I got sick from the shepherds pie but decided to give it another try & after 2 bites, it was SO greasy, I sent it back. I then ordered just zucchini sticks & they looked like something they picked up from the floor. service was mediocre at best. so between bad service & bad food why would I want to go back."
Jessica W.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,10,3,3.0,6/28/2016,"I love this place but today was really off we sat at the bar for a late lunch and it felt as if we were a burden to the bartender. Order a couple burgers and  appetizers that took more than 40 minutes to  make it to our table. I'm really hoping this is just an off day for this venue being there is such close competition in the area tacos, sushi, pizza, the list goes on forever.   FYI the sushi place on the opposite end of the shopping center has never let us down maybe thinking twice about coming back here."
Jade S.,"Las Vegas, NV",184,3,2,5.0,6/24/2016,"""Tall Shawn"" is the man! I work in restaurants & he's one of the best servers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Very kind, attentive, & full of good energy. :) I will definitely be back"
Jamie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,100,96,5.0,6/18/2016,"Excellent service from Matthew J. wait, ask for him he's excellent! We had the carbonara, penne shrimp and sausage, lunch portions were huge and delicious. Be sure and order the spring loaded Caesar salad, hee hee it jumps out  of the bowl it's so full. Having strawberry shortcake for desert. Isagenix cleanse here we come. Lol"
Coral S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,1,1.0,3/21/2017,"It was my first and my last time at cheesecake factory. The food wasn't great. All of our orders were wrong. I got a mushroom burger and the buns were hard as rocks and didn't come with any cheese like it said,  just lots of mayo, which ended up making my stomach upset. I sent it back once and it came back with better buns but still loads of mayo and no cheese. Haven't tried the cheesecake yet, but my boyfriend said it was good. The only good thing about this place was their sweet potato fries and brown bread. And that wasn't all that great."
AllYson S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,178,19,5.0,8/21/2016,"We had a really nice, quiet dinner after a night out with friends. It was around 1130/12. Our server was Jessica, super sweet.  When leaving we were really thrown off at the new lounge next door, ""the mixx"".  It was super loud, tons of people outside yelling and singing. Not a good look for boca park."
Teresa M.,"Honolulu, HI",11,42,1,2.0,6/20/2016,"Went here for lunch, waiter was was nice, food was okay until my husband took a bite of mushroom and found cardboard. How the heck did cardboard get into his food? The manager apologized, offered a new plate, and took off the charge for the cheesecakes."
Brittany S.,"Las Vegas, NV",72,12,7,5.0,8/11/2016,"I've been meaning to try this place for years and when National Cheesecake Day with half priced cheesecake came up, that was as good a time as any!  I went on a Friday afternoon and the the dining area had a lot of people, almost packed.  I wasn't too fond of the way seating is done here (as I felt I was in the couple's food next table over), the waitress was really attentive and friendly.  I ordered the Chicken Bellagio and it is delicious!  It's well seasoned, creamy and the meat is tender, not chewy.  For dessert I had the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake, which is served with a generous side of whipped topping and chocolate chips.  I can't wait to come back again for another meal!"
Mindy M.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,120,19,5.0,1/16/2017,"We had a fantastic experience.  My Mom had the Herb Crusted Salmon a day loved it. I had the Skinnylicious Mexican Tortilla Salad.  This thing is wonderful I can't believe it's actually healthy!   The tortilla the beans and chicken rest upon are a nice surprise in the center.  They make the best Arnold Palmer soft drinks (half lemonade and iced tea).  Love it!  Our server was awesome as usual, and love the brown bread they serve.  I wish you could purchase it as well to go!"
Jennifer W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,32,3,3.0,3/6/2017,I ordered the veggie burger but wanted it on sourdough. They told me it was going to be served as a baguette which was fine by me. But I told them I didn't want mayo or cheese on it. When my food came there was literally NOTHING on my burger??? I mean yeah there was no cheese or mayo but no other toppings that came with it? The waiter wasn't to blame obviously. But I was with a big group of friends and it was late so I didn't want to make a big fuss to get a new burger. Waste of $14.00
Stacy P.,"North Las Vegas, NV",27,10,5,1.0,5/17/2017,"Wow, went there the day before mother's day, we had a party of 13 for the patio so I thought I would go ahead of everyone to get table locked in... I got there at 230... Our party was all there at 250 and they still didn't seat us till 340!!!! It was horrible.. no one should wait that long for a table ..Our waiter was great thank god, but my daughter ordered the chicken parmesan, pizza style and it was horrible...It was like cardboard with speghett on top...Pretty big disapointment"
Jason A.,"Dallas, TX",17,13,,5.0,8/20/2017,Never been in this location but ordered to-go.  It was so nice to get home with everything we ordered with plastic ware. All warm food was warm and the cheesecake was cold.  Much appreciated for $90 in to-go food.  Love their lettuce wraps.
Pim M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,12,28,4.0,2/10/2016,Chris outrageous cheesecake was so good!! Other than that i thought it was alright.  p.s. service could have been better.
Tiffanie E.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,121,70,2.0,5/29/2016,"Good service. Tyler was good. 1 water refill, but other than that we were taken care of. Food is subpar. No bread basket at all, but I guess that's ok. We brought the kids for the first time & they loved the cheesecake, but their meals were just ""alright"". Honey had the soup, sandwich & salad. Sandwich was piled high, but lacked flavor. Salad was standard Caesar. The soup was good, but we didn't find any of the artichoke that was supposedly in there. Cobb salad had way too much egg & not enough lettuce. I hate that they let people dining in park in the spaces designated for take out...that's a pet peeve of mine. Overall for the price it wasn't great."
Pedro A.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,7,2,3.0,3/18/2017,Place is nice but too busy. I don't think everyone will have a slow experience but be ready for slow service just in case. Specially if you order something that's more than just a salad. Took 50min to get my food. Not the best first experience at this one. Maybe next time.
David B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,1,1,1.0,5/6/2016,The food here is good however EVERY single time I order take out they butcher the order.  Just got home with a chicken salad that has no chicken in it.  I guess it's my fault for not checking the order but we did curbside and it was dark out and it hard to open everything in the car.  We also tipped $8.  It's so aggravating.
Nicole T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,5.0,8/2/2017,Shawn is the best waiter you should definitely request him he made the experience even better
