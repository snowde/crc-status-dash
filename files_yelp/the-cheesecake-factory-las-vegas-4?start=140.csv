Laron S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,35,59,5.0,9/11/2016,"I thought id try something different from my favorite spot so went for the ""thai salmon ""was super good well seasoned an worth every penny"
Reid F.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,21,20,4.0,5/28/2016,"My wife and I love the cheesecake factory. Whenever we want to treat ourselves, we go here. Now there has been an on going problem that we face every time we come here. When it is just the wife and I, they will ALWAYS sit us at the two person, tiny a$$ table. In between two other people.  We make it a point to come when it's slow so we can get better seating. Normally we don't say anything and just sit down, but today we just got tired of it.  We finally asked for a booth, and of course they had open booths to sit us in.  Besides the seating issues we have every time we go to a cheesecake factory, we love the food and will not stop coming for the food. Unless, the seating issue gets so bad."
Mary K.,"Longmont, CO",0,8,2,3.0,3/6/2017,"Just has a hamburger and it was terrible. No flavor at all. I didn't even finish half of it as it was so bad. I'm sure the other food is good, but DON'T get a hamburger. Way over priced! I did let the waitress know about the hamburger, but she didn't offer to make it right. I even wrote it on the receipt."
TheLasVegasGentleman ..,"Las Vegas, NV",18,117,210,5.0,7/15/2016,Sorry for picking a chain restaurant as my favorite...but the sheer selection and consistency at every location is what keeps me coming back.  The food is good large and priced right.  The cocktails are a tad expensive but good!
Bill R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,3.0,3/5/2017,"Ordered Bang Bang Shrimp dish for lunch.  For $20 I expected more.  5 Shrimp, and 4 chunks of chicken over pasta.  It lacked the bang bang flavor.  Still good, but expected more for the price."
Joe A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,4,2.0,3/4/2017,"Service and location is nice.  The 2 stars is because i ordered a simple dish with plain pasta with chicken and light tomato sauce.  What I got was just that, but, WITH spices in it that started burning the inside of my mouth....  It was impossible to enjoy the meal.  I kept drinking my lemonade hoping the hot spice taste would go away.  It only just got worse.  I sent back the dish and skipped the meal.  Ugh."
Elaine C.,"Henderson, NV",476,41,26,5.0,5/17/2016,"Love Cheesecake Factory! Aside from the food the cheesecake is perfection! I got OREO, which was to die for! I usually go to the one in Henderson but we went to this location after my cousins graduation with my family & our server Katrina C. Or Katarina (sorry! If I spelled it wrong) was ON POINT TO THE TEE, with checking on us & refills on drinks without even us asking! That definitely made it a better experience thank you! Anyways all of our food was great I got the four cheese pasta with chicken which was so good, my sisters boyfriend got the chicken bellagio, my sister got the miso salmon & my cousin got the chicken marsala. All great dishes & a wonderful night!"
Sheena M.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,10,1,5.0,3/16/2017,Most of their food are great! from appetizers to dessert. Definitely my go to place if I am not sure what I want to eat because they have a very diverse menu!
Swetal P.,"Las Vegas, NV",121,1,,3.0,2/26/2017,"Terrible service, Tina V approached us with a terrible attitude, messed up our orders and gave the nonvirgin bloody Mary to my pregnant wife and then refused to remove it from the check afterwards, however the manager was exceptional very nice Cesar was great in getting everything fixed"
Monica L.,"Rancho Oakey, Las Vegas, NV",0,3,2,5.0,2/22/2017,We like coming to this restaurant because it has great food and great service. We like the calamari. We also liked their cheesecake.
Alexandra L.,"Las Vegas, NV",38,25,152,5.0,8/1/2016,"We absolutely love this place! We usually stop by for Happy hour because we like to sit at the bar. Service, food and ambience is 5 stars"
Renee P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,2.0,11/12/2016,Ordered takeout(at 430)and the girl at the dessert counter was extremely rude. Acted like everything was a bother to her. Had to re-ask for items we asked to be ordered the first time. Food was great but customer service was terrible.
Zach L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,1,1.0,5/25/2017,"I've had good meals here before, but today was not one of those days.  We ordered over $100 of food to go and the food was terrible.  The California cheesesteak was terrible!  The meat was disgusting, tough and just plain terrible.  The chicken enchiladas were horribly bland and the rice literally tasted like cardboard.  I've never been this disappointed in this location."
Portia R.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,10,,5.0,2/11/2017,"Ive never had a bad experience here. The staff is great.  They are always friendly and no matter how busy they are, they make sure to check on you frequently."
Shahira H.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,76,271,2.0,2/26/2016,"Cheesecake has always been a safe choice for my household. We all have a favorite dish here or some kind of comfort food. I use to go to the Green Valley location and we never had less than average service. However this location really needs to step it up. Reading through reviews and based on my past couple visits it's safe to say they always fall short in the service department. I mean the annoyance of the Cheesecake Factory at the forum shop is practically worth it compared to here.  Last night we order a couple appetizers and entrees and everything was ""half assd"". I checked into Yelp when we were seated and I had to refer back to my check in to notice it took over 15 minutes for someone to greet us. That was after I asked the busboy to get our server that was cleaning the table next to us. Then when the server came he asked us if we were ready to order our drinks as we stated yes he said h would be right back with our bread? Of the 2 appetizers we ordered we only had one brought to the table. Btw, don't ever order the Chicken Potstickers from here. They were too salty and nearly burnt. Stick to their firecracker salmon or avocado egg rolls. Someone at the table order the Steak Diane and Shrimp  Scampi (medium) and he was served well done. It was just careless acts after careless acts. Our drinks needed a refill we had to call on the busboy again. He took our drinks and brought them back without the straw. If we wanted Applebee's service and quality we would've went there.  We're definitely going to take our money elsewhere until they can do better!"
Andrew A.,"Las Vegas, NV",136,167,256,4.0,3/19/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is usually a dependable place to eat. I figured I'd try them again after the fiasco at the Green Valley one, where I felt bias from our server, which was evident from the poor service and lack of water refills and bread, compared to the tables surrounding us. A bit of a slap on the face to see them patronizing the ladies sitting next to you with the attentive service. Kind of overt if you ask me. Normally my dad tips really well too but he had it with this kind of service. I tip 15-20% but he tips 30-40%, sometimes 100%. So back to this location. I ordered spaghetti. Sorry, nothing exciting here. Just had a craving for plain old spaghetti and giant meatballs. Which is what I got, fat meatballs and spaghetti that was cooked right. The sauce is salty enough and you get a heaping plate of noodles that can feed two. And the server treated us like everyone else, as in didn't tell us that they didn't have any rolls and then bring it out to the next table 3 minutes later, or the table across from them a few minutes later. Yeah, we got the point. You won't catch me going to Green Valley Cheesecake Factory again. Generally, I always liked CF, from Caesars to Boca Park to GV, to every other one I tried in LA and Seattle. But certain experiences ruin a place for you. CF is good, but in this town, there's a ton of places you can go to get pretty much the same thing."
Ashley M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,27,8,1.0,7/12/2016,"My sister and I took her boyfriend for his birthday dinner, the appetizer quesadilla were amazing. I ordered the Sheila salad I believe it's called, it said chicken, avocado, tortilla chips and peanuts. Yum. When I got it, no avocado or tortilla chips. I picked through, looked, told my server, she then looked puzzled and came back with tiny bowls of avocado and chips. I tried to make it work, maybe took two bites, told her I wasn't happy with it, still on the bill and still paid the $15. Birthday time. I had told a manager about the birthday, server handed him the menu, he selected which slice, the sang happy birthday, then charged for the cake. I'm a server, it's hard to even write a bad review for me, but that service was just not how guest should be treated. I shouldn't have had to remake my salad when there was an error. And I've never been to a place where they charge for birthday desserts."
Chris Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,53,12,1.0,6/11/2016,"The negative reviews here are pretty accurate. I'm glad my gf was open to eating somewhere else and just coming here for dessert.  As many have stated, slow service. What frustrated me and really killed the moment for us both was that we ordered some nice coffees to go along with our cheesecake, and they were served in regular pint cups.  Wtf is that about? I've never felt so snobby in my life, but you will see, every where you go you will get coffee in a mug, and now I know from this experience that the cup makes such a difference.  You either burned your mouth drinking from the straw, or drink only foam drinking from the cup. A pint glass JUST DOESN'T WORK."
Avon C.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,18,11,5.0,12/24/2015,"GREAT TIMES! Kids were able to talk & make noise aa kids do. The atmosphere was very relaxing. Tge waitress, actually sat with my 3 yr old daughter to get her to eat. It was awesome.  The food was great. I ordered the catfish & planned on taking a picture but .... That did not happen. Sorry...I ate it all.  Sidenote: my 3yr old only wanted meatballs...not spagetti and meat balls. This was not on menu, but the waitress made it happen! Great times!"
Bethany F.,"Roanoke, VA",36,6,,5.0,6/4/2016,"Excellent!  The menu is extensive, we had a hard time deciding what we wanted because so much of it looked delicious.  The kids pizza is huge! We got one kids pizza and our three kids split it with some left over.  Service was average.  And, of course, the cheesecake was amazing, we had the Hershey cheesecake."
