D B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,3,2.0,4/16/2017,Service was sub standard to say the least. The waitress had an attitude from the beginning as well as my friends omelette was cold from the kitchen. I asked for a cup of chili which she said I could do then brought me soup of the day and got more attitude when I questioned that. Even walked off from our table mumbling under her breath. Once food came she never came back to see if we needed anything or to see if we wanted another beverage. Then we sat and waited and waited for her to come by and give us our check and go boxes. Additionally instead of picking up my glass by the base to move it out of the way she grabbed it by the top with her hand over the top. Very unsanitary. Very disappointed in Cheesecake Factory today.
Maggie M.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,5.0,12/30/2016,"Had dinner there last night Adam was our server , He was so amazing and the best service we've ever gotten there . We had a party of six and he was Johnny on the spot ! We love the food and the service is always great but last night it was exceptional !"
Casey B.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",34,37,15,5.0,11/23/2016,"Had a late lunch or early dinner and Isaiah was our server, he just started his shift and he was absolutely amazing!!!! He never ever skipped a beat! I've worked in F and B and he is the guy that i would want training me or my staff.  Thank you Isaiah you are pure perfection.  Food was good too. Food is always good as is the cheesecake."
Michael H.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,3,,5.0,6/24/2017,"Started by walking out of trying to get seated at Kona Grill. Host staff was rude at Kona Grill. Walked out and went to Cheese Cake Factory met by friendly host staff, seated immediately, had great service by Nathan our waiter. Food was hot and fresh. My son didn't like his spaghetti and Meatball but he is 12 and sent it back Nathan was more than accommodating to make my son happy. KONA GRILL Thank for not having space to seat us."
Amal F.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,14,,3.0,6/17/2016,"I am a regular customer there,and I always get the same thing.which is the luau chicken salad.I realized that they had added pineapple to it,and it didn't have a flavor to it.plus I use to love the dressing ,but i realize that the dressing was too vinegry....and I realized that they put the complimentary bread in the microwave........ I honestly didn't want to make a scene,but I realize that ,something changed in that place,even though the food came out very quick,but I just felt ,who ever made that salad,did a sloppy   the way,it have been more then a week since i ate there.I honestly love the cheese cake factory,I will always come back,cause,they have stuff on their menu,that you can't find any where,but i just wish,the luau salad, didn't have the pineapple.plus it wasn't too appetiting."
Tony M.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,72,31,4.0,5/9/2016,"Always a great dinning experience, but I don't frequent as much since they discontinued the CHICKEN THAI PASTA! Food was good, especially the new Cheesecake, Salted Caramel, great call Jessica N.! YOU were awesome!"
Michelle O.,"Las Vegas, NV",103,156,289,3.0,3/15/2015,"One of the reasons why I love eating at Cheesecake Factory is because the menu has such a wide variety to choose from. It's perfect for when your with a group of people who all want different types of food or if you just don't know what you're hungry for. Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious.  This particular location is interesting because it's in Boca Park where a lot of the Summerlin snobs hang out.  Today was a beautiful sunny day so we opted to sit in the patio. Being that there was only 2 of us, and they weren't busy, we were seated right away. However I could tell, almost immediately, that this visit was going to be not a good as previous experiences. Our server, Shawn M, came over to us right away and said ""is everything okay over here?"" This was a very odd way to greet a couple who had literally just been seated. We replied yes. He asked if we were ready to order. We'd been there less than 5 min so we said no. We placed our drink orders and asked for a few more min to review the menu. This was a mistake! Almost 15 min went by before our waiter came back to take our order. We had even closed our menus hoping he'd see we were ready to order. He was attending to other tables right near us. He finally took our order. Another several min went by before someone brought bread to our table. As we ate the yummy bread and waited for our food, we caught wind of an unsatisfied couple right next to us. They seemed to be making quite a fit about some cucumbers and arugula being left off. The manager was at their table trying to smooth it over. Perhaps this is why the waiter in my area seemed off... Our food arrived finally. I ordered the mushroom burger with a salad. My bf ordered the chicken avocado club. Our food was very good. I got a side of ranch to dip my burger in and it was tasty. As we ate, the snobby couple next to us continued to be a pain. The manager ended up re-making their food to-go for them to make up for the mistake. The couple continued to sit at their table even after checking out. Awkward!! I was about half way through my food when they finally got up to leave. As they left I hear the girl say ""this is hysterical that they re-made our food!"" The Summerlin snobs left and mood quickly went from tense to peaceful.  In conclusion, my experience today was just alright. My server was inattentive and overall a bit off. The Summerlin snobs complaining only made it worse. I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory before and have had great service. This time not so much. If you choose to eat at this location, just beware of the Summerlin snobs. I warned you. If you have an issue with your order, please tell the waiter/waitress quietly otherwise it is unnecessarily disruptive to those around you. Don't be a Summerlin snob!"
B H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,17,,5.0,12/4/2016,"Amazing! The speed of service, service, food quality and food temperature were all fantastic. Somewhat pricey but completely worth it."
Zach S.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",60,22,71,5.0,2/13/2016,Enjoyed the happy hour items artichoke and potstickers both had great flavor and sauces nice fun atmosphere
Marco G.,"Las Vegas, NV",83,77,64,5.0,3/22/2016,Love coming here for dinner. When we first walked in the wait was 15 minutes. Went to the bar and had a drink while we waited. Had a margarita which was good. For dinner we ordered the chicken enchiladas which you can never go wrong with... And my fiancé had a vegan salad. Food came out with no delay and the server was very attentive. If you can't decide what to eat for lunch or dinner this is the place to go with plenty of variety of foods and drinks to choose from!
Cazrine M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,2,3.0,11/28/2016,"In response to the individual that responded to my comment. If you didn't notice, the picture I posted along with my comment was that of a drink napkin that had been given to us that was, in fact used prior to our receiving it. Specifically, the napkin had notes of some s1ort written on it. We expect that the cheesecake factory uses a laundering service for their napkins because they are quality linen. Thanks for the response though!"
Ashlyn K.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,1.0,6/18/2017,This Cheesecake Factory needs to work on their Curbside To Go! EVERY time I order pick up they MESS UP! EVERY TIME! I don't recommend it. Yummy food but bad service!
Daniel S.,"Henderson, NV",988,1138,6855,4.0,12/15/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is much more than cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza.    Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner. We decided on The Cheesecake Factory. The menu offers a diverse selection of food at competitive prices inside an upscale dining room. We couldn't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory.    Although I have only been to this location once before way back in February of 2005 when I picked up my new Saturn Ion (sure was a long time ago), and celebrated with a delicious pasta dinner, I am no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Caesar's Palace location quite a few times.    When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes.    Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars.    The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don't know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included.  Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina's attitude.    Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar's Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding. I could see another well spent $20 at Cheesecake Factory in the future. Or $30 if I am hungry and want to reward myself with their signature cheesecake and coffee."
A P.,"Henderson, NV",92,41,321,4.0,2/21/2016,I am giving this review a 4 star based on over all experience. We showed up around 8 and didn't get a seat for at least 35 min after they told us 20. That's fine because the place was packed and there was hardly any room to stand. When I got to my booth it looked nice at a glance but then I found left over lettuce and crumbs on my table not a big deal either except my clean silverware was left for me on this table uncovered. Anyways I've been here before so it's not a big deal to me anyways. Our server was this character named Sean. And he was extremely entertaining and did his job well. We were rly here for dessert so what we did was ordered 3 appetizers and then two wonderful cheesecakes. Yum love both of them. Anyways I'll be back hopefully when it's not too busy
Emily R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1770,1649,10800,3.0,11/30/2013,"We had a gift card to use, so we arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday for dinner and they were packed! I was so surprised, but we waited patiently for our table and it wasn't too bad of a wait, about 10 minutes.  We were seated and service was friendly and attentive considering how busy the restaurant was. Refills were plentiful and food was ok. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and although I was a little disappointed with my food choice, everyone else seemed to enjoy their food and portions were more than sufficient. There was so much food, we had plenty of leftovers to take home with us.  I always remember the limoncello cake from previous visits, so we ordered that to share as well. Not as great as I remembered, but still solid and everyone was happy with the meal. Great service and pretty ok food for a chain restaurant. I'd definitely come back with a gift card or for happy hour in the future."
Michelle S.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,320,1111,4.0,1/5/2015,Their Godiva Chocolate cheesecake is to die for. Get it. You won't regret it if you're a dark chocolate fan. $8 a slice. Cheaper to buy the whole cake but I wasn't about to eat an entire cake.
Gerry W.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,289,228,4.0,2/2/2015,"The Cheesecake factory has two extensive menu's. The regular and the skinny which has smaller portions and lower calories. We were seated after only a few minute wait which was great for a Friday night without reservations. I suggest a booth over a table which provides a buffer for the surrounding noise. The large room can be conversation challenging when filled with diners. Our server was friendly and attentive.  The food ordering and preparation were timely. The Crispy Chicken Costoletta consists of 3 breaded breasts sauteed and served with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. The 3 large breasts were tender and juicy with a crispy panko style breading. This was 1 meal for 2 people or 2 meals. The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was sauteed with a spicy pepper sauce.  The entree is served with a choice of white or brown rice, along with black beans, plantains, and a cool mango sauce. The plantains were crispy outside and soft on the inside. The generous portion of shrimps were moderately spicy but not overwhelming. The cool mango was a nice contrast to the spicy shrimp. The restaurant has a Happy Hour but be advised it is only in the bar area which at our arrival was at full capacity. The bar area is wide open and will be on the loud side."
Martha C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,61,3,5.0,11/14/2016,Love so much of their food here it's honestly too much to type all my favs. Never had a bad experience here the service is great. Love all their food and desert items. Also good choices of alcohol. So yummy.
Esteelo B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,,2.0,10/14/2016,"Worst ""take-out"" service EVER!  Hold times on weekends (especially Fridays) are over 10 minutes!  As I write this, I've officially been on hold for 19 minutes and 10 seconds. I wrote this review because this is the 3rd time it has happened. Regretfully there isn't another Cheesecake Factory in the area, that's why we have to go to this location. Should just drive to the Strip! It'll be quicker than dealing with this horrendous service. Could we go somewhere else for dinner? Yes, but that's not the point of this review and I'm craving Portobello Fries... Sure, we're calling during the ""peak"" hours, but isn't that all restaurants on weekends? No other restaurant in Summerlin has this problem in our experience. Since this is happening EVERY weekend, isn't that an indicator that perhaps they need more staffing? Every time I call, they always say: ""Let me get the manager to help take orders.""  Duh! Shouldn't they already be involved?  Finally got Cesar on the phone (total of 21 minutes and some wait). The 2nd star was for his great attitude and exemplary service (thanks Cesar).  Extremely apologetic although not his fault.  He's the only reason I proceeded with the order and was comped a cheesecake. If they keep it up, there's only so much cheesecake to give away before they run out with their subpar service.  I'll be forwarding this to corporate."
Catherine C.,"Anaheim, CA",6,5,,1.0,7/22/2016,"I normally would go to the Cheesecake Factory in green valley, where I've never had an issue, but since I was in the area with friends we came to this location.  I really was blown away by the level of horrible service we received, I barely even know where to start. First it took probably 20-30 minutes for our drinks to come (iced tea!). Even longer for the bread. When ordering, my mother was making sure her meal came with chicken and the waiter, in a disrespectful and condescending tone said, ""of course it comes with chicken, it's in the name."" When my mother pointed out it does not say chicken in the name he continued to argue with her. I can't even tell you how long it took for our actual meals to come out and when they did my friends order was wrong and mine, being the last one out, finally came when everyone in my party was done eating!! Before my sandwich finally came one of the managers came to sort of apologize and quickly left our table before we could even express our unhappiness. The final straw was when our waiter was clearly trying to be rid of us, moving too quickly to hand us boxes and our boxed up cheesecake, he knocked over my half drunk (overly expensive) drink all over my phone and all down the front of me. He barely apologized for this and rushed off.  I really never complain let alone post anything like this but the service we received today was totally unacceptable and I will not be returning to this location. If I could I would have given this location zero stars."
