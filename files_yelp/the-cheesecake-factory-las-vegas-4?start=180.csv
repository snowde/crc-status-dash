Andre C.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,4,,2.0,11/29/2016,The Food was excellent but BUT after it was delivered I felt like we were forgotten about our server Dina didn't check to see how we were doing not once. Customer service not good im a server myself and I know at least you should check on your tables at least twice.
Tracy S.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,47,87,5.0,3/22/2016,We enjoy coming to Cheesecake Factory for there menu. There's something for everyone! Big wide variety of food. Food came out at a timely matter. Our server was friendly. We sat in the bar and ordered drinks while we waited for our table. We will be back!
Kobi G.,"Las Vegas, NV",140,95,123,2.0,1/1/2015,New year eve me and my wife went to eat something and enjoy the early night. The hamburger was a well-done but burn and didn't taste so good and through them about 45 minutes to serve us the food. Maybe because it was a New Year's Eve but still took them so long and the food didn't text so good this time.
Allan E.,"Winslow, AZ",2,20,98,4.0,2/24/2015,"The family went to this restaurant on Monday, February 23rd. If I was just rating this restaurant on food, I would give them a 5 star, but upon sitting down I noticed that my spoon had dried food on it and the divider between the seat cushions had a load of food debris. That said, I want to say it didn't have an impact on the food or the service.  Antonio was our server and he was excellent.  We started out with an appetizer of lettuce wraps, these with chicken and quite tasty.  The main course followed soon, my wife ordered a Mushroom Burger, mmmm delicious.  My daughter ordered the 4 Cheese Pasta and she loved it.  And finally I ordered a Macaroni and Cheese Burger, enticed by the idea of macaroni and cheese on a hamburger.  The macaroni was a ball, breaded and deep fried on top of the hamburger which was charbroiled and served with all the extras including fries.  What a surprise, this was a very good combination, especially if you like macaroni and cheese anyway. The restaurant was very busy but that didn't affect service.  Antonio took great care of us and our drinks never got empty.  The downside here is that they do not have Raspberry Iced Tea, my favorite, but only had regular and a couple of bottled teas.  I settled for regular tea but didn't enjoy it or finish it. And what would  a trip to the Cheesecake Factory be without some cheesecake?  While mom and I were stuffed from the burgers, our daughter had no trouble ordering a piece of Hershey Bar Cheesecake to go. Overall, this was a very pleasant lunch and we will be sure to return."
Nevin E.,"Los Angeles, CA",365,8,1,5.0,10/7/2016,This place is always awesome and the service from Chelsea was exceptional. We ordered a Thai lettuce wrap and a lemon chicken couscous which were both excellent. Cheesecake Factory has always been a go to for our family and will continue to be!
Joe I.,"Salinas, CA",0,24,23,1.0,11/25/2015,"We were staying in Las Vegas strip but went out to Red Rock Canyon for the day and used YELP to find this location away from the busy strip before heading back to our hotel.  We were at this restaurant on 11-23-2015 at about 5:30pm.  We had decent service with one issue that was poorly addressed by our server. My little one ordered grilled chicken from the kids menu . It came with grilled chicken mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  I reached over to try one of his carrots and it tasted funny to me. I thought it was my imagination but I noticed he left them all on his plate at the end of our meal. He said they  were not good.  I reached over and tasted one again and indeed they were rancid. I smelled the pile on his plate and yes they were rancid indeed.  I am not one to complain about things and my main concern was that the restaurant would serve them to other patrons. My wife let the waitress know in a non defensive manner about the carrots and she rudely  offered to replace them with another vegetable but we were not asking for carrot replacement, we were all done with our meals.  She was very nonchalant about issue and mumbled she would take them to the chef????? Then came back and dropped off our bill and never apologized or let her superiors know or chef or whoever she reports to. Never said a word and that was it. Picked up credit card and dropped it off hastily after she charged it.  We noticed they outline tip suggestion, our bill was 92 dollars and suggested tip was 16 dollars. My wife and I decided to leave without tipping. We have never in 15 years being married not left a tip. I worked for auto customer service for a long time and I appreciate tips and good service.  The decent thing to do would be to apologize and say that she has let the chef or her manager know and kindly apologized and removed charge.  The non tipping was far more than 6.50, kids meal price, the restaurant would have been out of.  Poor customer service."
Rachel F.,"Tampa, FL",91,593,1935,5.0,12/16/2014,"Went on sunday 12/14/14 at 11am. We had our hearts set on the elvis waffle but it was no longer on the menu. They made it for us anyway! That was nice of them. The elvis waffle is a crispy belgian waffle with banana slices, peanut butter, bacon, and warm syrup. It's amazeballs. BRING BACK THE ELVIS WAFFLE, Y'ALL!"
Jessica M.,"Henderson, NV",20,35,11,4.0,3/16/2016,"Yummy food and rich cheesecake :) I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory numerous times over the years.  I wanted to take a moment to yelp the help. In this case, I am giving a shot out to Even. We were sitting on the patio and he had a pretty decent table load, yet he was attentive and prompt."
Ania K.,"Las Vegas, NV",2515,430,5997,4.0,10/12/2014,"This seems to be the go to place when I can't make up my mind. I always attempt to convince myself that I'm going to order something different but I can't seem to get away from the Chinese chicken salad & chicken Madeira.  They have a huge menu with a wide variety of choices & I love the tropical ice tea. I also need to mention the mood lighting in this place, love that touch :) We can never seem to make it to dessert but the times we've had it it's always fresh & delicious. If you can't decide on which type of cheesecake to order you can't go wrong with the original slice with strawberries :) The warm bread is also a nice touch to start getting full before your food arrives."
Debbie D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,20,3.0,4/7/2017,"Having a very hard time with this. Here goes....please don't misunderstand the food here is amazing. Stopped by today for a drink or two and placed a togo order. I ordered a salad, full size. It was lunchtime. I  wanted to save half to take to work tomorrow. Normally I  can't finish a lunch portion but it's never enough for another meal. Well when I got home and saw my salad,  it was barely a lunch portion. I had the bbq ranch chicken salad. This is my favorite dish, so I know this salad well. I always get an extra dressing because the salad is so big there is never enough. Well the salad was so small I had an extra dressing  left. Used it on my bread. Oh did I say bread, yeah well I  ate the bread which I don't normally eat bread, that's how small the salad was. Quite disappointed. And I have nothing to bring to work tomorrow.  When I say small there were only 2 yes I  said 2 slices of avocado and the very bare minimum of chicken.  The reason I'm writing this review is because I just remembered while there, there was a lady at the bar complaining about her chicken portion was smaller than normal and the bartender took it back. Not sure if there is someone new in the kitchen and if there is,  they need more training.  I won't discredit for  service or quality of food but this order fell short for cheesecake factory standards."
Gregory R.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,34,13,5.0,11/13/2016,Had lunch yesterday. Lao salad and chicken burrito. Fantastic. What is amazing that no Mather what Cheesecake Factory I am in the dressing taste the same. What is their recipe? I wish I knew.
Hadley H.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,12,,2.0,6/12/2016,"The service was slow, the food was cold and not prepared as we requested.  Seriously just a lousy experience overall."
Amanda M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,36,1,5.0,4/4/2017,"I just discovered The Cheesecake Factory this year. If it weren't so expensive, I would go way more often!  I love it. This was our first time at this location, and it was great. We went around 6:30 on Saturday night and were seated in around 10 minutes. It was very busy, but our waiter was attentive and friendly. I could give 5 stars for the drink called the Georgia peach alone. It tastes like a drink from Carnival cruise ships called kiss on the lips. I have spent like 10 years trying to replicate it and can't. Now, I have somewhere to get it. It is $11 which is steep for a frozen drink, but oh my wow!!  The bread they serve is amazing. The sourdough is perfect. My husband had steak, I had the crusted chicken Romano, and my son had a quesadilla. Everything was great!  Now for the cheesecake....holy mother of choices. How do you decide on just one?!  My son (who is 6) always has Linda's fudge cake. It takes him 3 days to eat it because the slice is about as big as him. My hubby got the red velvet and that will be my choice next time because it was soooo good. I had the white chocolate macadamia nut and it wasn't bad. It's the only complaint if you can even call it that, but my piece of cheesecake was really small. The slices are always huge and mine was half the normal size. Maybe it was the last slice or whatever. Regardless, wonderful experience. Great food. Left stuffed. Go there."
Relus B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,9/2/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite spots to eat and order to go from. This particular time I was very upset. We ordered from door dash which i had no complaints about. The issue was our order, the restaurant gave us a call saying they were out of Nashville nuggets which was a big upset. Secondly, I told the lady on the phone I wanted everything extra spicy she said that she could make it ""a little"" more spicy which that was something I didn't want to hear after I said I wanted it EXTRA SPICY and told her twice over the phone to ensure it was understood that I wasn't it extra spicy! They couldn't make the buffalo blast more spicy, which was understandable. As for the Cajun jambalaya pasta which was suppose to be somewhat spicy to start hence the name ""Cajun"" jambalaya pasta wasn't spicy at all. My girlfriend ended up eating the shrimp and chicken out and giving the pasta to the kids since it wasn't one spec of spice in sight.  As for the buffalo blast, everything fell apart and it was hardly any blue cheese. I'm very disappointed and extremely upset with one of my favorite restaurants. Our expectations were definitely not met for our early dinner tonight!"
Dan R.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,5,3,2.0,1/21/2016,"We snuck out for some apps and, of course, to share a slice of cheesecake. I tried the new Cuban Roll app and it was amazing.  The service (Issac F) was just plain BAD. Waited forever for our food and then, the flatbread was cold, as was the chicken in our lettuce wrap.  After we ate, we stared at our dirty dishes for another 15 or 20 minutes. I was so pissed, I left without getting my cheesecake.  I'm in a bad mood now. The front of the house definitely dropped the ball."
Jessica C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",129,13,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Terrible service. Terrible. My friend who's birthday it was arrived @ 7pm knowing that there are no reservations accepted, we weren't seated until 8:50. No one came and updated us about the wait or anything we just sat there and say there while other guest who arrived after us were seated . When we were finally seated the waitress (Katrina) promptly brought drinks and took our order. The food came about 30 minutes later and there was a mistake on every order . EVERY ORDER. We didn't complain because we'd already waited so long and were starving . So now it's time to pay.............. Katrina gives me my check and I place my card with the receipt and put it in her hand . She returns with everyone's card and MY CARD WAS MISSING. I bring it to her attention and she says she's going to retrace her steps and see if she can find it . She returns not even a full 2 minutes later saying she lost it . LOST MY CARD ! she then says ""I'll pay for your food girl, I got you"" What about my missing card ?! wth are you going to do about that?! Needless to say , nothing was resolved and I now have to wait 5-7 business days for a new one and I have no time to go to the bank because I work 8 am - 9pm .  Unbelievable."
Shamika S.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,10,3,3.0,8/23/2016,"Excellent Steak Diane, great flavors. The dulce de leche cheesecake was also great...Seating areas and chairs are a little tight..."
Vanessa V.,"Las Vegas, NV",415,419,848,3.0,8/21/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has something for almost everyone, which I suppose is its appeal. It's like a ""fancy"" Applebee's or Chili's, except it doesn't have junk cluttering the walls and the menu options sound appetizing.  I dined here on a Thursday evening around dinner time. Unsurprisingly, there were plenty of people ahead of us waiting to be seated, because Cheesecake Factory is just too cool to take reservations -- first come, first serve, peasants.  Once seated, we ordered the avocado egg rolls as a starter. Always a solid appetizer; though the sweet tamarind sauce might be an acquired taste for some. For my entree I ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad. When it arrived, I noticed it was missing the side of vinaigrette dressing, as well as the avocado cream and sour cream. It was unfortunate that our waitress had to make two visits to retrieve the missing items. The salad was quite huge and could easily be shared between two people. Can't say this was one of the best salads that I've ordered from here. To top off dinner, I got the kahlua cocoa chocolate cheesecake, which hit the spot and made up for the salad mishap.  Off-peak hours are always the best time to visit, if you don't mind waiting. And if you do mind, fortunately there many quality restaurants in the area that you could go to instead."
Lainie W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,2,1.0,1/12/2016,"Pathetic ""specialty"" Fish & Chips to go order on 1/12/17! $18 WASTED! Not even a busy night or weekend. I'll cook next time or go to BJ's!"
Roberta S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,98,4,4.0,8/29/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is always a good place to go to when you want a variety of foods.  There menu is so big sometimes it is overwhelming but everyone can always find something they want.  The service is always good and our waiter, Michael was great.  We are from NY and so was he so we had a great time.  My husband ordered the herb crusted salmon and he said he was cooked perfectly.  I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich which was great but I was disappointed because on the menu it offered two variations but Michael said they were discontinuing the Korean style so I could not get the spicy cole slaw I wanted.  Our friends had the Cuban sandwich and they loved it.  Of course the portions are so big we were too full to have any cheesecake."
