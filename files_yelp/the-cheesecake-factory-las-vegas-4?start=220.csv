Lauralee E.,"Logan, UT",0,37,6,1.0,5/8/2015,"If I could give zero stars it would be fine with me.  I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before so my son took me while I am visiting in Las Vegas.  What a HUGE disappointment overall.  Why do people rave about this place?   Here are some examples:  Our table was 14"" away from the next person and the waitress had to crane her arm to serve each table stuffing her elbow in my son's face more than once.  Next I ordered the Fish N' Chips, on the recommendation of the waitress, only to be served breaded cardboard over soggy chips.  I was hard pressed to find the dry fish anywhere on that plate.  The coleslaw was a jumble of minced vegetables with some kind of light dressing which did not resemble anything I've ever known called coleslaw.  My son ordered a hamburger and out came this smallish, overcooked (even though he asked for mid-rare) dry burger, again with soggy fries. I could go on about the line-up of people waiting for a table while the staff were all talking and giggling and paying no attention to the patrons. Etc. The whole experience was terrible and nothing like we expected.  We paid the bill and left, never to return to this or any location.  However, when I talked to my other son and told him of our ordeal he was shocked and said that it must be the location because he has had delicious food in the Denver location.  Just our luck!"
Noelle K.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,14,,3.0,7/15/2016,"Update 7/25/16....I am pleased that the manager, James, has taken responsibility for what happened. I will go back and give them another chance. As I said, the food was delicious and I love their cheesecake.  He admitted that there was a failure on many levels and is taking steps to address them all. Taking responsibility and taking action is all I can ask. Raising to 3 stars for all the reasons I listed. UPDATE: 7/18/16..I MISSED A CALL FROM THE MANAGER, JAMES, AND WHEN I CALLED BACK AT 5:59 PM I WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE 3RD PERSON TO HANDLE MY CALL TOLD ME HE LEFT 15 MIN AGO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? HOW DID THE 1ST PERSON PUT ME ON HOLD FOR 6 MINUTES IF HE WAS ALREADY GONE? I CAN'T EVEN STAND BY 2 STARS. THEY GET 1 STAR FOR THE FOOD BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT IS HORRIBLE! I ordered a to-go order on the phone and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I got there about 17 minutes after my call. I stood for a good 5-10 minutes just waiting for help. When someone finally appeared she pulled up my order and gave me the total and then got told by someone else behind the counter that the person standing next to me was waiting first. That person was standing there when I got there and was only waiting on a cheesecake to go. Not a complicated order (didn't require the kitchen) and she had to have been waiting at least 15-20 minutes.  My order took about 30 minutes. I ordered a burrito with extra sour cream and guacamole so when they showed me a container with visible sour cream I figured that was the extra. When I got home, however, it turns out the there was NO sour cream or guacamole on or around the burrito. The ""extra"" I ordered was less than what would have come with the burrito let alone constitute anything near the ""extra"" I paid for. There was no guacamole at all with or for the burrito. The food is good (why I gave 2 stars) but the service was absolutely horrible!"
Tony H.,"Las Vegas, NV",41,257,38,4.0,4/4/2016,"Not that I come here very often, but when I do, it's usually pretty good. The menu has changed, although still a bit overwhelming with choice, they have made some strides away from the huge plate, huge calorie (and huge belly) meals to a little more resonable choices. Of course, that 'responsible eating' can go straight out the window with a few bites of one of their delectable cheesecake selections! We had good service and a pleasant waitress, left with a slice of cheesecake and we're happy."
Paula Matea V.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,2,1.0,8/19/2015,It seems like every time I go to Cheesecake Factory my fork and knife in the roll up is caked with old food.... Seriously are you guys doing roll ups in the dark or do you just not care that when I unroll my utensils that I see other peoples left over food all over my fork and knife and you think it's ok to give that to me? I wonder how clean everything else is if repeatedly this issue happens and no one cares to resolve it. Disappointing and disgusting.
Bunny G.,"The Woodlands, TX",840,1160,3986,4.0,7/20/2012,"It was our last goodbye dinner with our wonderful friends who are leaving to San Diego.  It was crazy since we had all the kids with us but since the restaurant is so noisy no one seemed to mind.   I have a few items that are my go-to favorites and tonight I had the crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus-ohhh delicioso. Pumpkin cheesecake when in season is my favorite!  Cant wait for fall! The red sangria is a must here too, they add fresh strawberries. We shared a mango and key lime slice of cheesecake and since I just like classic cheesecake, this wasn't a favorite. Kids shared a pepperoni pizza portions are huge! Service was friendly and prompt.  Free valet which I recommend since the parking lot gets busy and nice convenient Summerlin Location in Boca Park next to Kona Grill. Check it out there's something on the menu for everyone!"
Teresa V.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,7,9,4.0,12/30/2015,Service was really good.  Food was a little bland to my taste but every one else in my party enjoyed their own orders.  Seated quickly and was pleased with the cleanliness.
Kalecia W.,"Las Vegas, NV",119,1,5,4.0,11/21/2015,"I had an amazing time here. Yes it was short and simple but everything I expected!  When my friend and I came it was only a 15 min wait. When we sat down our server Nate, didn't rush to take our order. No, he didn't suggest anything but I knew that he just started his shift. I had a Carmel Royale macchiato which was on point! The calamari,  was crispy, little to salty but very good with the garlic sauce. And ofcoarse what we originally came for was the cheesecake! My friend,  order the pecan turtle cheesecake breath taking! And I order the warm apple crisp, delightful!  Everything came on a timely manner! I enjoyed eating here! Thank you Nate!"
Jenn M.,"Bakersfield, CA",64,130,52,5.0,7/27/2015,"We had a gift card from Christmas that we finally used. The service at this location is the best of any Cheesecake Factory I have ever been into. It was so great that we raved about our server to the General Manager, Lin.  I had the usual-- cajun jambalaya pasta. It's amazing every time, and my go to when I order from Cheesecake. We ordered a bottle of wine, had a fantastic time, and will be back as soon as we can for the service alone."
Carolyn H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,26,66,3.0,12/15/2015,"Boca park store was good a little disappointing as we ordered spinach dip and the salsa that came with it was frozen!! As our entree was served there was a hair on the inside of the sandwich!  Remember the lighting in there in dim! It was replaced with another dish but took longer than expected .  Pet peeve is having dirty dishes sit on the end of the table and no one picks them up, which happened a few times!!  For the money that was spent this was disappointing.  On a up note the food was very good."
Lilly M.,"Austin, TX",1,11,11,5.0,12/1/2015,"I went for happy hour with a friend and we ordered two appetizers: the Parmesan garlic bread and the fried macaroni and cheese, and one entree of Chicken di Panna. The bread was really delicious and we enjoyed the fresh garlic and olive oil. The marinara(?) sauce was very out of the jar tasting. The fried mac and cheese breading was heavier than we remembered. Of course by the time the entree arrived, which we were splitting, we were pretty full! But we were sat almost immediately, our server was very attentive with wine knowledge, and our glasses were never empty."
Wej W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,39,14,4.0,6/23/2015,"I am giving it high reviews because I love going there.... I love the small plates and the big plates too.... Few suggestions.... Make a cheesecake sampler dessert plate (for those that are arguing what to get)..... Make a vegan cheesecake... Make one with ricotta cheese, call it a cannoli cheesecake.... (I want royalties for that one!!!) Make cheesecake mini bites (for someone who just want a bite!!!).....  I ordered an Asian steak dish forget what it was called and it was amazing!!!"
Michelle H.,"Las Vegas, NV",170,7,1,3.0,11/23/2015,"My husband loved his meal, Garlic Noodles with Chicken. I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and thought it was just okay. Not enough dressing at all. My only other complaint is the ambiance. It was like eating in a cafeteria. The crowd was loud and the music playing was so soft that I could barely hear it."
Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",167,32,1,5.0,6/15/2016,Swung in late prior to them closing and sat at the bar. The bar tender made sure we enjoyed our late night sweet tooth craving dessert. We'll be back!
Ryan K.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,24,,4.0,11/13/2015,Love the steak of Diane. Plenty of dishes to like and choose from. Most of the items are delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the cheesecakes but the prices for a single cheesecake is ridiculous.  The menu has so many options that it makes it hard to choose. I also hate all the ads in the menu!! Isn't this place big enough not to have ads. There always seems to be a wait even though there are plenty of open tables. Guess they just want us to think they are super busy.  Definitely will come back for the cheesecake. Pumpkin is my families favorite.
Eric M.,"Kaneohe, HI",59,872,245,3.0,3/31/2015,"2 star dinner with 5 star service with 2 star facilities.  Philly cheese steak sandwich was quite average.  Too much bell pepper and steak a little too thick to be great.  The steak was seasoned well, as were the sweet potato fries.  Breakfast is served all day.  The omelet was huge (easily enough for 2 hungry people) but nothing special.  Needed a little salt.  It was served with potatoes fried with onions.  Didn't look all that appetizing because the onions were in a big clump instead of being more evenly dispersed.  The restaurant floor was not wet but slippery.  It felt to me like someone spilled something oily and it got tracked around.  The men's restroom was very disappointing.  Had a long puddle of water under the sinks.  Granted, it was after 9:00 with a 10:00 closing time but I still expect better from a sit-down restaurant."
Brandy V.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,25,284,3.0,5/6/2014,"I ordered the Bristo shrimp pasta tonight and a fresh lemonade. The pasta and the sauce was on-point, but I was disappointed to find most of my shrimp was burnt black. The waiter was kind enough, when he noticed me picking out the shrimp to get me new shrimp... However at this point I was already done eating and boxing up my left-overs. The fresh lemonade was very sweet-- fair warning if you are hoping for tart lemonade.  Overall, the service was great and the atmosphere is always nice; it just depends what you decide to order from the extensive menu if you will really enjoy the while experience.  BUT- I am disowning The Cheesecake Factory yet... I have had some really great meals with them. ( Like the beet & goat cheese salad and their non-alcoholic piña colada) B"
sara a.,"Lahaina, HI",72,4,1,1.0,9/28/2016,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory... I grew up eating at the Brentwood location at least once a week & sometimes Marina Del Rey for a party etc. I now live away from Cheesecake territory so I get so excited for Pumpkin Cheesecake every year and am so excited when I can actually partake.... tonight we went to the Las Vegas Boca Park location for my dad's birthday (I swear the pumpkin cheesecake had absolutely nothing to do with choosing where to eat) and it was the WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Dirty silverware, our server didn't even know we were her table so we just sat there until we said something then we were pretty much invisible the rest of the time. Then topping off the experience we were told to pick a dessert to be brought to the table to sing 'happy birthday' but when the check came we were charged for it.  Our server was a very sweet person,  but regardless, whatever the reasons, we all left saying that we felt ripped off - the food was mediocre the service was shitty then that ... and it wasn't inexpensive. I don't think any of us are returning anytime soon and if I do it definitely will only be in L.A."
Kirk V.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,36,2,1.0,2/19/2016,We went on a Friday night and it was not too busy. Everyone ordered a fountain drink but mine was a lemonade and for some reason it took an extra 15 minutes to get when the food came it was lukewarm. Spoke to the manager and she happily took the food back to warm it up but when we got the bill she never took any money off nor did she come over when the food was brought to make sure  it was hot. The food was just OK not what we're used to at the Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately they had a bad night.
Stephanie C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,5.0,5/30/2016,"Best Ahi Tartare I've ever had, and I'm not a fan of raw fish! Service is always a little above average, not too much and usually not too little. Tiramisu Cheesecake is my favorite!"
Annemarie K.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",136,378,511,2.0,2/8/2015,"I'd have to say I was quite pleased with this place until my last experience. I went with a friend for lunch and we ordered two small plates. We waited 45 minutes for food, asked three times what was going on and was told that the food was coming. I finally asked for a manager, and he said he would check what was going on. Then finally our waiter came by and told us the order was never put in. They should've told us before we had to ask three times! So even after that happened, they did not take any money off of the bill. We should've at least gotten a discount or one meal free after they made us wait that long for a salad and a sandwich."
