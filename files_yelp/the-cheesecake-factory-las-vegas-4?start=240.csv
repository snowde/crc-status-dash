Ken S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",33,18,,5.0,6/30/2016,Some of the best clam chowder I've ever had anywhere in the world and some of the best shrimp meals in fact just about everything we have there is wonderful
Dinah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,141,416,5.0,6/26/2015,"Service here is always good from the hostess to the waiter, not to mention the large selection of food. I have yet to try everything because of their expanding menu. So far all items I tried is delicious.  Being on vacation, we splurged a little on the entrees, good thing they have lunch portions. Of course we have to have dessert here, so ate only 1/2 the entrees to be able to share their scrumptious Godiva chocolate brownie sundae. Hmmm...food coma. Definitely one of favorite places to do, consistent in all locations I have visited."
Eugene A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,5/1/2016,"Service was horrible!! Stay clear from Melissa K- if you're young and not white!! She didn't bother clearing our bread/appetizer plates or anything for that matter!! We had to request for our drink refills (which she couldn't remember what drinks they were). We were done with our meal and HAD to ask for dessert menus. She also forgot to place our appetizer order. She did cater to all the other tables around us tho- filling their drinks and offering them dessert menus while they were still eating.  She was also having conversations with the surrounding tables. Definite slap to our face.. Note to server: DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER, YOU WORK IN LAS VEGAS- YOU'RE TIP REFLECTS YOUR SERVICE!!! WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS LESS THAN SUBPAR!! Shrimp scampi pasta was very bland."
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,4.0,11/3/2013,"Located in Boca Park, we had a late dinner here on a Friday night.  Main reason for us coming here...I was hungry and wanted something that I was low on calories, higher on protein, and close to where we were currently at.  Plus, the food at Cheesecake Factory is as consistent as it gets. Yes, I said lower on calories and The Cheesecake Factory has a special menu for this.  Drumroll...their SkinnyLicious menu. In the last 4 months, I've been to a Cheesecake Factory about 5 times.  Every single time, my meal of choice comes from their healthier options.  This menu has a range from chicken breast, steak, tacos, some fish, and turkey.  Of course, there's a bunch of salad options, but I don't do salads. I tried their White Chicken Chili with Brown Rice.  I was surprised that my meal was less than 500 calories.  It was damn good.  It's basically a lighter chili sauce, some brown rice mixed in, and a whole lot of chicken breast pieces.  Loved it! As for the service, it didn't start off too well.  It was a Friday night and we got seated right away.  But it took forever for our server to come and take our order. I had to give the eye to one of the employees walking by just to get service.  Within 5 minutes, service is what we got.  By the way, service was great from then on.  Overall, I'm still giving Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because of their SkinnyLicious Menu and familiar dishes.  PS:  Hard to say no to the bread basket.  Their brown bread is phenomenal.

Marc S.,"Las Vegas, NV",199,292,4088,4.0,11/6/2013,"The menu here is like a JC Penney catalog. It has so many options on it that I always have a hard time deciding what to order. Even though this place is big and offers plenty of seating inside and outdoors, it is always packed. Parking can be a pain but I have never had to wait that long for a table. Our server (name escapes me sorry dude) was always checking on us and friendly.  Started out with Stuffed Mushrooms. I have had these with clam or sausage before...but these had a blend of cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We got 6 with the order and they did not last long. I used some of the bread that was brought to the table to soak up the last bit of the wine sauce.  For dinner I had a Macaroni & Cheese Burger. This was a risky choice...I knew I would either love it or hate it. The burger had fried macaroni balls and cheese sauce on it. I asked them to leave the veggies off my burger this time because I did not know if fried mac & cheese and tomatoes, onion or lettuce go good together or not. The burger was very cheesy and I enjoyed it. The fries it came with were hot and good. The side of ranch I requested was nasty though. It does not even taste like ranch but something bitter and gross and the color was more clear than white. My wife had half of a chicken salad sandwich and cup of tortilla soup. She enjoyed her sandwich and loved the soup but didn't like her salad due to the same nasty ranch being on it. I had half of her soup and liked it as well. We both left fulfilled and happy and had no room for cheesecake."
Nelson Q.,"Las Vegas, NV",2738,1403,29290,5.0,11/17/2011,"Came back for dinner because we're big fans of the small plate menu, which allows us to try lots of different things. On this visit, we grubbed on our usual Vietnamese Tacos(AKA Bao), Samosas, Beet Salad, Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread, and tried a new item, Roasted Shishito Peppers, which was a VERY generous serving. How generous? 45 peppers! (Ichiza gives you even less per order) As always, everything was great and very filling.  Stop in and try their small plates, you don't know what you're missing out on!....ALOHA!!!! YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(82/365) ""Tapas at the Factory"""
Chey M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,5,,5.0,5/8/2016,I pretty much die every time I come here. I've never had a bad meal. Even when they're swamped with people the service is still pretty good.
Michael F.,"North Las Vegas, NV",16,88,101,4.0,12/16/2013,Cheesecake!!!!! But they are not just doing desserts. They have a full menu. First time I ate here was couple weeks ago since my boss(thanks boss) gave me a gift card. I have had their cheesecake from friends who picked up dessert for birthdays and such. It's perfect for families and for those date nights. It can be noisy but when me and my girlfriend arrived the waitress sat us in the corner and we felt all alone.  My girlfriend went with some basic chicken fingers but I did the Shepard's pie and boy was it sooo good. It was full of flavor and perfect for a cold day. The serving was soooo big which is not a bad thing. I ate all of it and when it came to dessert time the slice of cheesecake was huge!! I got the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake and it was a perfect for a sweet tooth! My girlfriend couldn't finish hers but I ate all of mine ha ha. Edit: I can't believe I forgot that we started with mini crab cakes. They were good and this is from someone who doesn't eat much crab except for sushi. The food and service was good. The prices were not bad for the amount of food you get. Definitely returning!
Stephanie M.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",28,44,57,2.0,11/30/2014,"This Cheesecake Factory is absolutely terrible. Not just once or twice have we had a problem. Every time we come to this location the staff is disrespectful and inconsiderate.  I am giving them two stars just for the taste of the food. The other three stars are being subtracted for the service this location gives. Today's experience consisted of me walking in to order one slice of cake to go. It was the truffle cake. Usually the thing is pretty big. But not today, it was half the size it usually is. When I asked the worker her response was I was wrong that it's smaller than usual. She told me I Must of got the last slice the other 25 times I've bought the same cake.  She had terrible customer service. I waited for a few minutes then asked for a manager. When I told the manager it was smaller she said it did look smaller and she would get another slice. She came back and told me they measured it and it was the right size but they would give me a different slice. They came back with it and it was bigger than the first one but the same as the others I've gotten over the years.  It may sound so petty to complain about a slice of cake being half the size of what they usually serve but when I get told I am wrong about what I have received before, it rubs me the wrong way."
Andrew A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,3/19/2015,"Wasn't very busy when we went in,  still took them 15mins after we where seated to take our order and that was only because we said we wanted to order when we could get hold of them. Ordered 2basic meals (pasta and burger)  waited more than 30mins and even then order was brought out incomplete.  Food was bad, pasta was mainly sauce with a few pieces of pasta swimming around, burger was subpar and well below most places even with the higher price.  Went in with getting cheesecake in mind and left without getting since everything we asked for took so long to appear.  Will not be going back here"
Lani L.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,45,21,4.0,3/12/2016,I'm not into cheesecake but the main entrée was delicious. I love the atmosphere and the service.
Stephanie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,88,14,1.0,10/22/2016,$8 for a small sliver of cheesecake and the chocolate cake part of the 30th anniversary cheesecake was basically frozen. How unfortunate.
Heather S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1024,231,3781,3.0,8/12/2013,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 31/100 Yes, in a city full of amazing bars, local eats, and world famous restaurants--- I chose the Cheesecake Factory as our spot to enjoy a Saturday night dinner.  Why??? Well, I know exactly what to expect when I come here.  And that's EXACTLY why the Cheesecake Factory hit the spot. This restaurant was very similar to every other Cheesecake Factory I've visited in the past. It was tastefully decorated, extremely busy, and very noisy.  Our server was on top of her game and was extremely attentive and friendly. The food was tasty and the portions were HUGE! We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go, which was fantastic. As chain restaurants go, I think Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. As long as I still eat cheesecake, I will be returning (especially for their Pineapple Upside-Down Cheesecake)."
Alex R.,"Las Vegas, NV",64,12,,5.0,1/13/2016,"Tonight We had the pleasure of receiving the most excellent service from Micheal. A most memorable experience I enjoyed with my love. Food was delicious,full of flavor. Those mushrooms though ;).(order the mushrooms).., upon leaving very satisfied we were quite surprised at how many people wished us a good even.Thanks guys!!"
Ann P.,"Canyon Country, CA",107,11,,4.0,3/11/2015,"Went to The Cheesecake Factory for lunch yesterday, with my Mommy in law. Oh my goodness!!! We ordered an appetizer called Dynamite Shrimp it was sooooo good the sauce it came with was half part of the yummy factor! On to the bread they serve while you order, it was really good. For my actual lunch I ordered the Parmesan Chicken.. very tasty. I looked at the other items and found why order and burger and fries when I can get a dinner for three $$ more and take it home for lunch the next day! My Mommy in law got a noodle dish and she said it was delicious. We both had left over food to take home. So yes I'll be going there again..even just for that Dynamite Shrimp! I'm craving it now lol. Mmmm Server was Mike, he was very good and checked on us plus bagged our food to go. Very nice gentleman he was!"
Catherine D.,"Las Vegas, NV",122,64,150,5.0,4/29/2015,"Had a family style lunch to celebrate a birthday on a busy Saturday.  They were very accommodating for a large party of 8.  We waited 15 minutes for a table.  Our waiter was very nice and attended to all our needs.  We enjoyed all the food and the cheesecake is always amazing!  I ordered the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp with brown rice.  Portion was delicious, but  super huge could only finish half.  At end of meal, a kalua cocoa coffee cheesecake was served for birthday celebrant.  That cheesecake was awesome, it was gone before a photo could be taken!"
Olivia A.,"Las Vegas, NV",147,82,192,5.0,4/8/2015,"Home away from home! Cheesecake factory of Las Vegas vs Cheesecake Factory of San Francisco! All I can say is, you can't go wrong w/Cheesecake Factory ppl! If I had a tail, it would have been wagging! LOL Ok although the room temp was on the chilly side, MAYBE that's why the bread was on the hard side. But I MUST say yuuumy on all that was ordered today! Along w/the sweet, warm & very professional service from our server ( & I HUMBLY appologize on somewhat forgetting his name, probably due to the fact of the well made 3 Flying Gorilla's & 1 Pineapple Mojito we ordered for starters) Marvin/Marty/Mark/Mario? Bravo! Because of your welcoming service, well worth of a return visit!!"
Richard M.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,36,25,4.0,12/16/2014,Always a crowd pleaser..... Who does not like cheesecake???  Big menu has plenty of choices for everyone.... Service is consistently very good too!  It's a big hit for the very young and seniors because of the various portion sizes and styles of food....
Marie P.,"Fort Worth, TX",77,14,,4.0,1/3/2015,"I always love this place no matter what city I am in. I frequent Vegas as my in laws live there and having two kids under 3, it is difficult to dine out with them sometimes. I loved the speed in which our server, James, got our food out to us. He also understood to get our kids meals out faster so that a mutiny didn't erupt. Our meals came out hot and delicious and fast! My only slight and very minor complaint was the kids meals came out PIPING HOT. I understand they were busy but it did mean we had food the kids couldnt eat for a minute or two but they were looking at it and couldnt understand why they couldnt eat it. Yes we know to blow on the food to help out but still the cheese sauce for the Mac n Cheese was lava hot.  STILL will be going back!"
Jerry S.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",21,222,331,3.0,12/22/2014,Place is ok. It's to be expected. I never did like this place since I was living in NY.  Food is ok deserts suck and so does the service. Don't think I will be returning.
