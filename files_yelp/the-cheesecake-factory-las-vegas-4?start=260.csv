Elie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",838,127,74,5.0,1/25/2015,My son gave us a gift certificate and we could not have been more pleased. We've been to other Cheesecake Factories but not this location. FABULOUS! Service was good but the Kale & Quinoa salad was off the charts. We also had the Portofino Pizza which could be as good a pie I've had in a long time.
Rachel B.,"Austin, TX",611,473,960,4.0,6/7/2013,"Cheesecake is in the name, so you know it will be good! This is a great restaurant chain.  This location is huge with seating both inside and out.  They have the usual 30 page menu, so you will definitely find at least 1 thing, if not 10 that you want to try for lunch/dinner.   The food tastes great as well.  My favorites are all appetizers.  I usually get 2 apps and enjoy a small feast.  My absolute favorites are the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, and the Buffalo Wontons.   All are winners and I recommend these to everyone who loves yumminess on a plate. If you are in need of more food than some appetizers, you are in luck! They have everything from tasty pizzas, yummy sandwiches, and delicious entrees that could feed a small village.  If you can name it, Cheesecake Factory probably has it on their menu. The desserts are fantastic here too!  I mean cheesecake is in the name of the place, so you know the cheesecake will be great!  The also have other desserts like cake and pie, but I have never tried them because I always go for cheesecake! DUH!  My favorite choices are the Chocolate Tuxedo, Dulce de Leche, and Key Lime cheesecake.  The Pumpkin cheesecake is fabulous, but you can only get that one in the fall. The service is usually great and you can usually be sat pretty quickly, due to the massive amount of tables available.  It is a very consistent restaurant.  It seems no matter when you go, the food will always be the same.  They run this place like a well oiled machine and it is a great place to eat."
Lucy G.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,29,8,5.0,12/28/2015,"Iv been here more times then I can count but never left a review. Food wise everything  is most of the time good , service sometimes better then others. This review is for Tyler at the bakery. I order curbside to go and he is just so accommodating and nice. It was pleasant to see him in a good mood which puts a customer in a good mood. He offered me something to drink as I waited for my food. Food was well prepared and everything in my to go order was placed correctly."
Vera S.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,24,,2.0,12/28/2014,"We decided to come to this location instead of the one in Henderson since it was closer and we thought we would have a nice experience.  Little did I know that we would have a really bad table.   We had about 1 1/2 feet or room from the table to the left and when the gentleman on that table decided to step away for a moment his rear end ended up on my boyfriends food plate.  I had to move quickly to avoid the waiter hitting my face with his elbow when he brought the food to the other table and to make things worst as I used my spoon to try the salsa for my tacos there was a dried up piece of food on it, didn't see it since its a bit dark inside.  We had to laugh since the food was great  But had to yell at each other since the table to my left was so loud and to make things even more interesting, the gentleman on the left started to pick his nose.  What a great way to have a date night."
Zena P.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,13,14,3.0,10/10/2015,"For the first time I get disappointed at the cheese cake factory, we had one of the worst server ever. We had to wait forever to get our order in!!! And longer time to get our SALAD it's not like it has to be cooked. I know if I go back to the same location I'll make sure I don't get the same server horrible."
V W.,"Las Vegas, NV",572,602,197,3.0,11/12/2014,"I've been to this cheesecake factory like a dozen times and it use to be great back in the day, but my recent visit was kinda blah. I came with a friend last week to chat over dinner and we must have waited about a good solid 10 minutes before our waiter came to take our order. Our waiter was friendly, but seemed to have way too many tables to tend to making hard on him to please everyone he was serving. The poor guy was stretched thin and it was a bit hard trying to find him so we could get condiments to our table that he or his food runner had forgot to get. My friend ordered the beef medallion with mash potatoes, which she liked very much. I ordered the lean burger with side salad and it didn't turn out the way I requested. I wanted my burger well done and it was not and unfortunately my salad was not very fresh, but I ate my food anyway, because I was like starving already. Overall I didn't really enjoy my food, but I'm more than willing to give this place another try and taste something else on the menu next time I eat here."
C C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,2.0,4/11/2016,It's amazing when you have one weird experience and then it happens again at the same location. Took my husband for his birthday and as usual had a nice table and a very friendly waiter at least in the beginning. Didn't have the bread we wanted and said it was cooking. Took order then i announced I would like a cake for his bday. He said no prob. Then we never saw him again. Another waiter brought the meals and another waiter never introduced herself. This happened 2x! He could of said I will be leaving now and ... Will take over. Never got the bread that was baking. Then the other waiter said to go that she will give us the white bread and full roll. Wrapped in foil the bread was dark. Omg then she overcharged for desert etc etc..... I love the factory but something doesn't seem right.
Golenaz M.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,21,47,5.0,9/28/2014,My favorite appetizers are Avocado Eggrolls and Stuffed Mushrooms.  My favorite dishes are Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo and Chicken Bellagio.
Linda V.,"Las Vegas, NV",60,18,17,4.0,2/7/2015,"Very busy for early Saturday evening, 6pm. However, we were told 30 minutes & were called in +/- 15minutes! Friendly, approachable, informative hostesses, wait staff & other staff. Huge menu of many various foods. I had the herb-crusted salmon which was prepared perfectly & my taste buds danced for joy! My hubby had a salad with the same type of salmon atop it, & was equally delighted!  The Chocolate Tuxedo Cheesecake sent me heaven-bound! If you've never been here, DO NOT miss this food destination! Yummmmmmmmm.........."
Kelly G.,"Aurora, CO",119,389,7889,4.0,8/1/2013,"We went twice in 2 days for half off cheesecake for National Cheesecake Day.  They were located on Rampart Blvd in the Boca Park shopping center in Las Vegas. The first day was with a Facebook email.  The second day was with no coupon.  We tried the Dulce de Leche, White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut, Key Lime, and Kahlua® Cocoa Coffee Cheesecakes.  We took an Original cheesecake and a Red Velvet cake home.  i liked those two the best and would order them again."
Paul H.,"Las Vegas, NV",329,548,656,2.0,8/1/2014,"This location is nice, but our service today was mediocre at best. They seem to be too busy to care to provide quality. I had the chicken salad sandwich which was more mayonnaise, than anything else. They even put heavy mayo on the bread when the chicken salad was already oozing with mayo. The salad was poor quality, and the server was not knowledgeable of the menu. There was four of us, so overall the food was delivered properly. The server did not offer to correct the matter, but asked if I wanted to talk to a manager. She should ave just taken the food and had it served properly."
Kathi T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",33,22,7,3.0,12/2/2014,"Omg meatloaf and mash potatoes.  They weren't hot, sent back, and the returned plate the plate was hotter than the food.  Truly disappointed."
Gabrielle B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,1,1.0,9/4/2016,We have been coming here for years and years. But the last 3-4 times it takes FOREVER to just get drinks and takes even longer to get our food ! All we order is a chicken breast with steamed veggies ! Shouldn't take 45mins to a hour to get that food. Won't be coming back for a while until they change there kitchen staff. Takes way to long and the restaurant isn't even busy.
Jenny D.,"Las Vegas, NV",881,393,2599,4.0,3/8/2013,Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta FTW!  It's mother/daughter date night and Hunnie Bunnie has picked this place again after having the Bow Tie Pasta in Marinara sauce last time. They should really take reservations because this place ALWAYS has a wait AND the waiting area gets CROWDED.  The wait is 25-30 minutes. 28 minutes later our pager goes off - It's go time!  Tonight Im starting with a glass of Prosecco. It's not as sweet as I would like so totally not ordering THIS again... I told our server I didn't like it and she was just kind of like Ooohkay...  We start with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and their complimentary table bread served with little pats of cold butter. It would be better if the butter was actually spreadable but whatevez. The soup is in an ENORMOUS bowl and pretty tasty. We ate about half and had the rest packed up. Chicken Chipotle Pasta for me it is! SO delish!! Perfect amount of spiciness that doesnt take away from the flavor of the dish - I love all the veggies mixed in with the pasta too along with the tortilla strips. I could probably just drink the sauce and be totally satisfied. Twice in the past I have tried a different pasta only to be disappointed so I'm just gonna stick with this WINNER!  Hunnie Bunnie is getting her Bow Tie Pasta in Marina Sauce (meatless) and she obviously loves it - she says it is her FAVORITE! So about mid-meal a very nice manager comes over and asks me about the Prosecco. I just told him it wasnt sweet enough to my liking and he took it away and OFF my bill :) The Cheesecake is DELICIOUS of course as well! Rich and creamy and NOMTASTIC! Ask for no whip cream if you're not into it.
David V.,"Las Vegas, NV",1435,399,1182,3.0,2/12/2013,"I come here twice a year...mother's day and mom's birthday...I feel like there's a pattern here. With one of the largest menu's around you'd think you could please everyone?...well maybe if everything they made was great....instead I am let-down more than I am delighted.  Most of their items aren't bad, but seldom does anything stand out to me.  I pity the servers here, and the corporate demands they seem to have to deal with...if it is obvious to the customer then it isn't working. My go-to classic is the Chicken Madeira.  It is one of the better chicken dishes from a chain-restaurant.  I'm not really into desserts, but I can share the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake any time I'm here! Needless to say I love my mom, and am more excited to see her than I am to come to The Cheesecake Factory...and being that we have a large family, The Cheesecake Factory isn't really all that bad of a choice...we cold do a lot worse!"
Vamp C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",64,62,71,3.0,5/6/2013,The food was great but the service was really slow.... and it was not busy. lots a waitors walking around. horseplaying.  only saw our waitress twice.  one to take our order and the other to take our money. lol ordered the lunch special: pizza and salad both big portions. could not finish both really good.
Britney L.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,33,19,5.0,2/3/2015,"Me and my boyfriend went for lunch and brought our 1 year old daughter.  The waitress broughy her bananas which she LOVES and bread thank you for going above and beyond.  My boyfriend first time he got the cajun pasta myself i ordered the jambalaya both good will be back don't order the pineapple jalapeño margarita unless you throughly enjoy jalapeños . Very attentive staff, great food, atmosphere and kid friendly."
John R.,"LITTLEFIELD, AZ",6,7,92,5.0,3/10/2013,"This was my first experience at this location. I have been to the other locations in Vegas and I wanted to try this one in Summerlin.     We arrived and were promptly seated after  a few minutes.  We were there during a shift change and had two servers. Both were attentive, friendly, and professional. They made our visit enjoyable. The food was awesome! After I decided what to order. The menu selection is huge. My wife had the chicken taquitos, which were very authentic and dang good! I had the Steak Diane and herb crusted Salmon combo. The Steak with the sauce and mushrooms was very flavorful. But the star of the meal for me was the Salmon. I normally don't order Salmon at restaurants but the description sounded good and our server indicated that it was wild caught, which was the selling point for me. I'm just going to say that it's the best Salmon I've ever had at a restaurant!  Nough said! Overall this is the best experience I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. I highly recommend a visit to this location."
Rich B.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,2,,1.0,6/23/2014,"Sadly, The Cheesecake Factory on the westside in Las Vegas has never truly measured up to the brand. You're always better off visiting The Strip. There are too many eateries in the area to take any chances at this location. The Cheesecake Factory on the westside has a reputation for a 50-50 split between enjoying the meal or feeling sick. During our last visit, sick meant food poisoning. After eating the lightest meal at this location -- fish and chips -- the next week resulted in one of the worst bouts of food poisoning ever. I should have known. The fish tasted frozen and as if it had been left under the heat lamp too long. It should have went back, but after a long road trip, no on had the energy to wait around.  Afterward, the incident was reported. The company claimed to do an investigation, said they could find no evidence that could trace the sickness back to the restaurant, and promptly sent the absolute last thing anyone in my family wanted to see -- a gift certificate to go back. No thank you, ever. There is nothing wrong with The Cheesecake Factory, but there is with this one. Avoid."
Timothy J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,25,21,1.0,9/15/2014,"Went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time in a long time. Boy was it mediocre! My wife and I walked in at about 3:30PM and it was almost entirely empty. My wife is currently walking with a cane as she is recovering from knee replacement surgery. The hostess greeted us and promptly told us it would be about a five minute wait - please have a seat. WHAT??? five minute wait in an empty restaurant??? Did she see the cane? Does she know that 95% of the tables are wide open? I am not exaggerating, it was 95% EMPTY!!!!  OK, let it go... she was stupid. We were seated in about three minutes - just long enough for my wife to uncomfortably sit down and stand back up again.  Food took a LONG time to come out - especially considering how busy the kitchen was (sarcasm). I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad from their new ""skinnylicious"" menu. My wife had the Steak Diane/Chicken Madiera combo. Hers was what you'd expect - typical Cheesecake Factory OK meal. Mine on the other hand was UNDERWHELMING. Our server informed me that the salmon on this salad usually comes cold, unless I would like it heated. I opted for warmed. Big mistake. Their idea of warmed seemed to be microwaved to the point of shriveled and hard around the edges. Also their idea of salad seemed to be dump some greens out of a bag o' salad and dress it up with a couple of sticks of asparagus. Come on guys... make me a fresh piece of fish and use some higher quality greens. Like I said, UNDERWHELMING! I really expect that in a restaurant, they should be able to prepare/cook a piece of fish better than I can at home. I also expect freshly cooked, not what had to be cooked yesterday (or last week) before it went bad and then refrigerated to hold it for leftovers for the salad.  Lots of staff standing around with a dirty floor. No one seemed to care. My guess is POOR MANAGEMENT and POOR TRAINING. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, but you have slipped about three notches and I won't be returning."
