Todd J.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,9,,3.0,11/3/2015,"I don't dislike Cheesecake Factory...but when I ate there this time, it finally occurred to me that Cheesecake Factory is just a really big Applebee's."
Kevin Richard G.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,4,2,4.0,2/12/2015,We ate here last night for my wife's birthday and the food was delicious. The whole first time experience would've been perfect if not for our very rude server David
Regina A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,,5.0,9/6/2016,Always yummy!  I love the big menu because there is so much to choose from.  It is close to work and home so I love the carside to go.  I do wish they had more spots because they always seem filled up.
Tirza G.,"Las Vegas, NV",198,7,,4.0,3/2/2016,"I could eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner - 24/7 365 days a year. The menu is so diverse and theres always something for everyone. Staff is also always friendly!"
Jackie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,4.0,9/12/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of the most consistently good eateries in Summerlin.  There is never a wait, the help is super accommodating, and the food is just delicious.  The water is served with lemon and the two breads (wheat and sour dough) are perfect to get your empty stomach under control before the entrees arrive.  The outdoor tables are nice but I like to be seated in the rotunda."
Kevin C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,1.0,8/28/2016,"What a absolute disaster !   Worst service I think I have ever had since being here in Las Vegas.  Server was terrible, half of our party didnt even get their meals before we left.  Manager gave a few of us a free desert... Big frickin deal.   Will not return."
Thomas S.,"Las Vegas, NV",290,70,1125,3.0,6/29/2014,"TLDR: expansive menu + kids', long waits, standard service, inside/outside seating This California-based company prides itself on continuing Oscar's and Evelyn's dream of providing excellent cheesecakes and desserts in a bakery setting. I'm not so sure that this is reflected in today's restaurants, started by their son, David.  My family decided that we would venture into the not-so-upscale Fashion Village at Boca Park. Because Cheesecake Factory boasts an expansive menu, even for the kiddos, I guess I wouldn't mind holding our spot in line for our large party. A promised 45-minute wait, although expected at peak dining hours on a Saturday night, was cut down to about 25 minutes: an unexpected, but welcome, plus! The host stand seemed filled with unnerving hostesses as well as the hustle and bustle of seating all the walk-up guests. They probably needed a break and a reminder that every new customer deserves a positive experience.  Upon seating, I was immediately greeted my by waitress. Her smile appeared genuine and her customer service rhetoric was unwavering excellent. I was impressed. A secondary server/busser provided bread and waters for all the guests without question. It was fantastic. Our waitress was very accommodating, making suggestions, attentively listening to our requests/restrictions, and tending to the needs of the young children at the table. Upon everyone's food delivery, a manager approached my table to discuss the reason as to why my salmon salad wasn't delivered yet. He stated a vague, yet wordsmithed response in which he basically stalled for an additional 7 minutes. The ""fish just wasn't right"" probably meant that it wasn't cooked yet, it fell on the floor, they forgot, or any combination of two. A specific, yet honest answer would have been more appreciated. Isn't honesty the best policy? Although the selected dishes varied, I will comment on what I tasted during my experience. My salmon salad for $17.95 was delicious. An herb-crusted salmon topped field greens, cut tomatoes, endive, and asparagus paired nicely with my glass of iced green tea (suggest simple syrup from the bar to accompany the drink). The salmon looked at least 8oz and did not overpower the dish. I recommend the ranch in lieu of the vinaigrette. The children's pepperoni pizza can be a little spicy for children, so be wary of your picky eaters. The tostada salad is a mouth-watering heaping mound of greens atop chicken and a tostada. The lettuce wasn't dried/spun prior to plating and, therefore, left an unnecessary pool of water on the plate and tostada (which transformed into a soft taco shell). The meatloaf is average: nothing special and nothing exciting. Save yourself and select an alternative dish. For dessert, the limoncello cream torte was to die for. Layers of vanilla cake christened with lemon marscopone allows for a sweet dish worthy in lieu of any dessert wine.  As we received the check, our desserts were double charged, a strike two for our experience. With the tardiness in food delivery, accuracy of order, and initial experience, I rate it 3/3.5 stars."
Lucero Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,61,,3.0,7/27/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my all time favorites.  If I see a CCF at a city I am visiting, I go there.  I had lunch with a friend.  We arrived at 1:56 pm.  We were told that it woudl take 15 minutes - even though half of the restaurant was empty.  It was 2:25 pm and we were still waiting to be seated.  My friend brought this event to the Manager.  He looked at us and said nothing!!  We waited for the waiter longer than usual.  We placed our order.  The salad was supposed to have the dressing on the side.  We waited 20 minutes for the dressing to be brought to our table.  The table was not cleaned before they brought the desert!  I have to say that, in general, CCF service was below standards.  Hope that this is not the new normal for CCF!"
Heather A.,"Henderson, NV",113,338,335,3.0,3/9/2013,"My experience on Wednesday makes me unable to say more than 3 stars and the drop of stars is exclusively about the questionable service. I am on a diet and I was excited to discover the SkinnyLicious Menu.  The lettuce mexican chicken tacos are only 250 calories.  How often do you find such good diet options at a restaurant?   My friend was already seated when I arrived.  It took between 5 and 8 minutes for the waitress to show up and ask me for my drink order.  Since I had been sitting there for so long, we were both ready to order when she arrived. Then came the wait for the food.  Again, I had the lettuce tacos and she had a chicken sandwich with fries.  We sat there for 20 minutes waiting for our food.   We enjoyed the food, but again came the wait for the waitress to return so we could ask for the check.  Then the wait for her to come back and pick the check.  At this point, I had to bail and go back to work.  I gave my friend cash.  I also advised her to just pay and go to the front to get her piece of cheesecake she wanted to take home.  (She told the waitress at the time of ordering that she wanted to take a piece of cheesecake home.  Apparently, the waitress didn't want the tip on the cheesecake.) Food 5, service 2-3"
Alexis G.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,49,7,5.0,2/16/2016,Thank you Thank you Thank Francis for keeping the doors open for me to get that piece of cheesecake to go that I could not live without!!
Victoria K.,"Las Vegas, NV",73,83,226,5.0,10/19/2014,"No complaints here.  My family usually come here if we can't decide what new place to go or if we just want to stay close to home.  The warm wheat bread they serve with butter is delicious,  try not to eat too much before your entree! I enjoy pretty much every dish here from the pasta dishes, burgers, sandwiches, desserts and so on.  This place is a must.  One thing i am bummed about, they took their ahi tempura rolls off the appetizer menu.  I was told they change their menu every 6 months.  :("
Christina S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,73,,3.0,12/29/2015,"We have been to this location multiple times. We often have problems with the food: either it comes out cold, or modifications are incorrect. Servers are are friendly and always get a cheesecake to go."
Judy N.,"Antioch, CA",41,229,88,4.0,6/16/2014,"It's been close to 15 years since I last ate at a Cheesecake Factory, and that was in SF.  I was visiting my sister in Vegas, and apparently they order takeout from here often.  So that's what we did. I was trying to be ""healthy"" so ordered the Santa Fe Salad.  What was I thinking?  McDonald's makes a really good Santa Fe salad with breaded chicken (probably totally not healthy).  I actually kinda love it, though I don't go to McDs often. I was hoping TCF, with their reputation, would have a version just as good. But no, it was just what I imagine a ""healthy"" salad being.  Lackluster in flavor with not much to recommend it other than the fact that it was relatively healthy. My sis had the apple pork chops.  She really liked it, though I personally am not a fan of sweet savory.  The mashed potatoes were excellent, which I remember from my visit 15 years ago. My brother-in-law had the Davinci pasta dish, which is one of the 2 dishes they said they almost always order (the other being the shrimp scampi).  I only had a taste but my god, that was good!  It really didn't look like much because the sauce seemed fairly light, but the flavor was amazing.  Cheesecake tiramisu. Drool.  I like cheesecake and I like tiramisu but I don't generally love either.  I LOVED the cheesecake tiramisu.  Fluffy and light, all 3 of us agreed this was utterly delicious. Portions were huge for all the entrees and well worth the price.  If I ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory, I need to remember:  Davinci & cheesecake tiramisu."
J G.,"Los Angeles, CA",876,27,4,1.0,8/6/2015,"Terrible service. 10:15p.m. on a slow Thursday night: 10 minutes to wait for a table, 12 minutes to wait to even get acknowledged by a server...and that's only because I had to flag her down to get attention. Pathetic!"
Trev W.,"Carlsbad, CA",528,213,576,3.0,4/24/2014,"The Factory of Cheesecake Always a good call if your unsure of what your looking for. Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that has one of those huge menus where if you can't find something to eat, clearly your not hungry or having some of interstellar hunger breakdown. Having been to cheesecake in a few locations around the states this Factory has all the bells and whistles you come to expect from any other franchise. Ordering the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the Chopped salad for our main we dived straight into the massive portion of food. Make sure to always come hungry. They have a small kids menu as well as high chairs for the kiddos!!  Since the Mains are pretty big my suggestion is try to order the small dishes if your looking for the amazing cheesecake! My favorite cheese cake is the Carrot Cheese cake. Some of the chocolate cheesecake can be pretty amazing as well. Also if your not a Heavy cream person let them know as they like to stack a massive cream side to your cake.  As for service, expect a line if your coming at peak times, usually 7 days of the week this Cheesecake Factory is busy so don't be surprised when you might have to wait a while. Overall a great place and can be recommended for almost any occasion"
Steve G.,"North Las Vegas, NV",14,26,27,4.0,10/22/2014,Always enjoyable here plus Mojito's. Gonna be fish and chips tonight and thai lettuce wraps it is.
Shannon P.,"Las Vegas, NV",246,73,268,5.0,8/22/2014,"This location rocks! There was no line,  we simply walked right in and were seated right away. Our waitress was personable, attentive & funny.  Food came out shortly after we ordered.  Restaurant was clean. Staff was friendly. A great dining experience overall."
Jazzy J.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,12,1,5.0,11/9/2014,Oooh this place always has my taste buds going!! I recommend there weekly soups and amazing salads (: and of course there cheesecake and Ice teas. You should never leave dissatisfied here
John V.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,108,98,3.0,9/12/2015,"What can you say about Cheesecake Factory that most don't already know.  Went with a group of 10 and the wait on a Friday was approx. 45 minutes. Once seated and drinks orders were taken I was quickly informed that the only beer I wanted on Tap was not working, go figure, so I didn't order any other type simply because I wanted that particular beer.  Cheesecake Factory always seems to be overwhelming to me in the menu and there is so many options and looking at the menu I soon realize I have not idea what I want. Since I have been to this restaurant before Yelping, I have tried a few items but overall never been extremely satisfied with the quality of the meals.  With that being said, this day I easily ordered The Club Sandwich, in hopes that it would be better than just standard for a sandwich, but again, its just a sandwich.  The Service was somewhat slow but nothing out the ordinary since it was Friday night and we were a big group, however, the Manager did stop by the table and apologized for the extended wait on the appetizers and said she would take care of the cost on those since they were not out after 30 minutes, Thanks Manager.  Right after apps came out the main entries showed up and while I wasn't overly excited about my Club I was impressed with the appearance of the plate.  Of course Club sandwiches are stacked so unhinging my jaw to take a bit is always fun and this Club certainly proved to be about standard in taste and appearance. I was finally happy with something I had ordered although I only ate half the Club (gotta save room for Desert)  Desert was Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and certainly without a doubt worth every penny!  Hats of to the waitress for giving me updates on the beer tap, however, they never got it working so went beerless but I do appreciate the attempt.  Overall, this experience was good and my food was improved from the other times (pre-yelping) but I did only order a Club Sandwich.  I would return with others but certainly not on my top priority of restaurants to eat at, even with the award winning cheesecakes."
Zohar L.,"CHESTNUT HILL, MA",36,22,29,4.0,1/30/2016,"Fun restaurant.  Has the most elaborate menu I have ever encountered!   Food is fun, love the grilled artichoke.  I recommend"
