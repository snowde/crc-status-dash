Nicole H.,"Las Vegas, NV",274,84,289,3.0,11/2/2014,"The staff is great! Just had the Chargrilled Coulette Steak and it was phenomenal! It comes with French fries and onion rings but I skipped on the onion rings per gluten free. But seriously, the steak cooked medium is better than most steaks I've had at $$$$ steakhouses on the strip (and we've been to almost all of them). So that tells you to try it!"
Christie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",1069,859,6625,5.0,6/22/2012,"Love love love this place! I never have a bad meal and the service is excellent. This location is located in the Boca Park shopping center. For customers they offer free valet parking. If you don't feel like valet, they have a private lot for parking or there is a parking garage. I love to start with the ""Avocado Eggrolls"" and if you have never tried them you must! They were priced at $10.50 and can easily be shared.  My favorite thing to order for my meal is the ""Carlton Salad"". It is huge but I manage to polish off every last bite because the awesome flavor keeps my fork going back for more. The salad was priced at $13.95 which is fair for the size and amount of fresh fruits & veggies in it. The only problem is I never have room for one of their many choices of fabulous cheesecake for dessert so I pick one to-go. This last visit it was a hard choice but they are all so good I new I couldn't go wrong with the ""Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake"".  If you don't feel like eating inside or outside on the patio, you can phone in your order for pick up. They say to wait in your car and they will bring out your order but if I phone in a order I usually just go inside and pick it up because they are always so doggone busy.  I noticed on the menu they offer catering."
Erica F.,"Henderson, NV",10,4,4,2.0,8/11/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is definitely on my list of favorites....Ive never been to this location before and I was in the area so I decided to give it a try. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive, and the food was pretty good although my shrimp was a bit over cooked (I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo)...one thing that really bothered me was how filthy their silverware was (there was pieces of leftover food on my spoon and butter knife). I asked my waiter for an extra set of silverware and cup of hot water to soak them in...problem solved...I don't live in this area so I'm sure I won't be returning to this location"
Cailin B.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,6,,1.0,4/13/2015,"Let me just start off by saying it takes a lot for me to right a bad review.  My first bad experience happened back in December of 2014. I love cheesecake's salmon and I ordered it this time like I do every other time. It tasted awesome, but I regretted it later on that night. I was sick and throwing up from it from about 9pm until 1 or 2am (and I was getting on a flight to Mexico at 6!) luckily it wasn't full on food poisoning or I would've missed my trip!  My second bad experience happened last night. We placed a to go order for two southwest chicken sandwiches and a slice of cheesecake. When we arrived to pick up our order there were 3 other people standing around looking pissed and waiting for their orders. We waited about 15 minutes before one of the employees came over to us and told us that they could not find our order in their system. We then waited another 15 minutes for them to find the order (the order taker put it under Taylor even though I spelled my name out to her over the phone, she obviously wasn't listening). Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received the food. If you are counting that's 45 minutes waiting for a pick up order.  We got home and ate the food.... The fries were soggy, the sandwiches were luke warm, and the marshmallow on top of our lemon cheesecake was melted and unrecognizable (but still tasty). Fast forward 2 hours and we were both sick. I took pepto and thankfully was fine but my boyfriend was not so lucky. He has full on food poisoning!!!!  We will NEVER eat at Cheesecake Factory EVER again."
Nic O.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",5,40,3,5.0,11/13/2014,"I have been to this location several times and every time is better than the last.  The food is fresh and is very consistent. It is good food, nothing exceptionally gourmet but not bad either.  The service is what sets this place apart from the rest. The waiter we had was friendly and personable. He gave great recommendations and explained all the dishes in great detail. The food came out quickly and he was very attentive to the needs of the table.  I would return again if nothing else for the great service and of course the cheesecake."
Alexy R.,"Las Vegas, NV",357,143,113,5.0,7/24/2015,"If my husband gets on my bad side, he knows to bring me here to turn things around - one of my favorite restaurants in town. We always have a great experience here whether it's carry out or dine in. I wish I had the server's name who helped us yesterday, she was awesome. We decided to come in with our 5 month old and she was very helpful when it came to the pace, bringing out the check and boxes early just in case, very patient all around. After all, no one wants to be stuck in the middle of a nice restaurant with a screaming baby. So glad we have a restaurant like this close to home!"
Corinna M.,"Las Vegas, NV",196,161,195,4.0,7/19/2014,Huge menu selection to satisfy anyone. This location always packed at prime hours. Servers are okay. Sometimes a little inattentive on checking on you. Food is yummy like all the places in the chain. Portions are big so eat half and save room for dessert. The cheesecake is super rich so eat half and save for a late night snack.
Danyell K.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,3,4.0,1/16/2016,Well being its so much to choose from I believe it's over rated and pricey for the amount of food they give you also the rice was hard the steak was cook great the service is Great made sure to accommodate for the rice thank you
Candace C.,"Las Vegas, NV",303,381,1595,3.0,6/28/2010,"The Skinny: solid food with varying consistency (3) the level of service is all over the place (3) value: okay - not that great, not that bad either. I normally don't review a place that is a franchise. However, because my hubby and I frequent this one quite often, I felt like I had enough writing about this particular restaurant. We've generally had pretty good consistency with regards to food here - barring one incident where we had raw corn fritters - twice. Service can be great depending on your server. Overall, not a bad place for a quick bite to eat but not my favourite either."
Marsha B.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,54,90,4.0,6/9/2014,"This is one of our regular places. Portions are huge and the dishes are seasoned with a ton of garlic (makes your meal really flavorful but having so much garlic does have its draw backs :-). All that said, the food is super good and decadent. You can't order a bad meal. I especially like the clam chowder (served Fridays), Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, and the Chinese chicken salad."
Chewy M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,52,,3.0,3/8/2015,"Three stars because our waiter was friendly and made an effort. The food however was not that good. Calamari was subpar and my fish and chips were pretty gross. Seriously it's a fried protein on top of a fried starch, it's kind of a no brainer but this  was just so bland and mushy. Also it came out lukewarm and got cold while I waited the ten minutes for the rest of my party to get served their food. My nephews all got burgers that were over cooked. Overall this was not a good restaurant experience."
Shelli C.,"Henderson, NV",25,72,6,3.0,4/25/2015,"Dirty glasses, dirty tea cup, bottom of dinner plate grimy...slow service.  Good ok but not as good as Henderson location.  Don't think I will come here again.  Definitely not up to par.  And the server ""joked"" that we were troublemakers because we expressed concern about dirty tableware.  Like we're supposed to drink from dirty glasses?  The tea cup was filthy inside and out!"
Jillian C.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,7,3,5.0,11/19/2015,"I usually have pretty good service every time I dine at this particular location, however, last night (November 18, 2015) the service my guy and I had was PHENOMENAL! Kathleen(Kat) is probably one of the absolute best servers I've ever had. I go out and eat a lot, as does my man, and together we made it a point to tell the manager how fantastic we thought she was. She's a genuinely happy and helpful person. So sweet and totally perfect for the hospitality industry. I can't say enough how happy I was with our service. Kat you're amazing! Thank you sooo much for such a nice dining experience! (:"
Jose G.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,3,,4.0,12/27/2014,"A great dinning experience as usual. We ordered the Chinese chicken salad, fresh crisp and not overdressed. Shrimp scampi without the arugula, recommended by the server, delicious. A couple of cold Stella Artois, refreshing! And topped it  Off with a creamy NY style cheesecake... A must visit restaurant at Boca Park."
Cherie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,25,1,2.0,11/8/2015,"This was our third visit here.. More than likely our last. Our friend ordered the So. Fried catfish and it had a very strong oder of ammonia and she said it tasted even worse. My husband ordered the chicken burrito grande, and it was mostly made up of rice and cilantro. Very few pieces of chicken. He and our friend sent the entrée back. We asked for a manager and this lady basically wanted nothing to do with owning any mistakes. She did not apologize for the mistakes, she only made excuses. Our server, however, was extremely apologetic and nice. I believe her name is Skylar H, which is the name on the receipt. So kudos to her! She was a fantastic server! Unfortunately, we won't come back due to the lack of ownership in management. Our entire experience was ruined it seemed from the moment we walked in."
Monet B.,"Las Vegas, NV",150,14,9,5.0,8/16/2015,"Love the ambiance, the food is delicious, the staff is wonderful, a but slow of service due to it being busy, but totally worth the wait. The cheesecake is out of this world! Today I ordered the chicken littles... Yumm!"
Gary S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,1.0,12/20/2014,"NO PEPPERMINT BARK CHEESECAKE!!! Signs on the sidewalk, the doors, and the inside, along with promos on TV, but that highly anticipated seasonal special wasn't there! So much for the drive out just to enjoy that!  Call first if that's what you want!"
Ami M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,8,6,2.0,4/6/2015,I do not like how they do not have a whole cheesecake ready for us to order. I don't think it should be necessary to order in advance just so they can defrost the cheesecake. You should be ashamed of yourself to be called The Cheesecake Factory.
J K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,53,46,3.0,5/16/2015,"The service was great, the food was just ok. The appetizer came out pretty quick, but the main dishes took a while. The quality of the food was just ok. I had the jambalaya which besides being a little spicy there was really not much flavor. I should have gone with my usual bang bang chicken and shrimp. The crab and artichoke dip was tasty though. Probably won't be going back anytime soon. Grimaldis is just a few doors down."
Pamela C.,"Honolulu, HI",14,13,,3.0,12/9/2015,Pasta was salty. Desert was still frozen. Charged us for extra whip cream.  Poor service and unfriendly staff.  Must have new management that isn't ready to manage.
