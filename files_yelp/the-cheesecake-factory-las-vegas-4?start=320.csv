Calvin G.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,6,1,1.0,6/7/2015,The food is always good here. But the one thing that killed it was the waiter he had a horrible attitude with all my friends and I he mocked one of my friend and when we told him that we were not ready to order he did not come back for another 30 min we were just sitting there like idiots so I decided I was not going to tip this guy so y scratched out the tip line and only payed the total. He had the odyssey to walk behind me and said to rewrite the tip and the total. We will go out or way and just go to The new one that just oped up in the north premium outlets.
Gina C.,"Las Vegas, NV",300,18,1,3.0,8/16/2015,"I absolutely love the food here! There's never a disappointment there! The service on the other hand, could use a little work! Very slow. The last time I came in was only for a slice of cheesecake and I was waiting for over 20 minutes! I don't think it takes that long to slice a piece of cheesecake now does it? I asked for a manager just to inform him of the situation and he was very apologetic and made sure I got a cheesecake (comped) to-go. That was nice considering I had waiting so long for it! For today's visit, a friend and I were waiting nearly 10-12 minutes just for the server to come and take our drink order! It's a little ridiculous but the food is so good I can't stop coming back! :)"
Courtney C.,"Las Vegas, NV",726,497,1157,4.0,10/28/2012,"Love this location! Great service, lots of room in the happy hour area and consistency. The host stand is in a little awkward of a spot but everything else makes up for it.  PS. It's in the same complex as a Panera, Target, and Total Wines. Could it get any better??!"
Kristina O.,"Cypress, CA",98,349,45,5.0,4/20/2012,"Not only is this my favorite chain restaurant, it's also my favorite restaurant. The variety is so immense. You could have your pick from so many different cuisines from American, to Italian, to Chinese, and so on. There is always something for everyone, and they have insanely huge portions. This makes it so you always have some left over for later that day and the next day.  It's always important to save room for the cheesecake though. My personal favorite is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. It doesn't get much more satisfying than that. I know this is a really short review, but the food is excellent, the service is top notch, and the ambiance is fantastic. The only thing that would negatively affect my review is the wait to get a table. If you come on a weekend night, expect to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to half an hour to be seated."
Kim L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,1.0,3/9/2016,Took my son and daughter to dinner for my son birthday we been coming here for 3 years for his birthday.

Gambit H.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,63,124,4.0,5/10/2014,"Went there on a Saturday around 4pm. They were fairly quick on having us seated. The waiters were attentive, kind, and patient. The menu has something for everyone. The cheesecakes are a nice treat. I personally love the banana cheesecake and the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake. The only con I have is they only offer reservations ""sometimes"". It depends on the day and time."
Spencer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",814,25,94,3.0,12/20/2013,"Cheesecake factory, one of my favorite spots and very popular among my friends.  This time around was last thursday 12/12/13 and our server was Shawn M. dinner time we had a good size group about 12 people total. They sat us with 8 because the rest of our group would take some time. Starting with the food. I am an impulse kind of guy, i like to try new things but don't like deciding. This time i actually saw a picture of the dish i got on a screen above the bakery counter. I got the steak Diane. med rare super tender and flavorfull. with potatoes. I also tried some of the caesar salad. Both amazing and up to par for cheesecake factory. We got sat and we were starving. our waiter came over explained the specials as they usually do. We were very thirsty and asked for water. He claimed he was not taking drinks right now he will just explain the specials and come back in a few minutes. Something im not really used to hearing as we all just wanted water. I am myself a server so i tried to be understanding. When he did come back a few minutes later. we gave our drink orders mostly water. My girl said we ready to order too when you are. He explained ""ok well im just gonna take the drinks now until the rest of your group gets here give me a minute"". The tone was very unfriendly to me and my entire group. It was obvious he knew we were a gratuity table and since we were young did not care to go above and beyond to get the little extra that cheesecake servers usually give. At this point i started to pay attention to him. Noticing which tables he was responsible for, how many were seated etc etc. this just justified the fact that yes we were a gratuity table of kids to him and so he did not care as much as he did his other tables. When he came back i decided to speak up as the rest of my group were kinda annoyed. I explained clear we are ready to order when you are, the rest of our group will not be here for awhile. This is after about 15 minutes of us being seated already. an estimate of about 35 minutes until we finally started receiving our food. Not ideal but nothing we could do at this point. My water specifically was refilled only twice, i drink a lot of water, and less than half way through my meal i was done. and didn't get a refill until i was done with my meal. Then once more AFTER i received my split check at which point i no longer needed a refill. Order taken food arriving and the rest of our group showed up.  this part annoyed me the most, he explained to our friends that just arrived ""yeah they didn't wait for you guys so let me know when your ready to order"". Little does this server know we explained that to them already and they are the ones who told us to order because they would not be there for awhile. This is something i am not used to at cheesecake factory. This particular server definitely did not start us off right. i am sure that the rest of my group might not understand why. But as a management myself i know when a server notices a young gratuity table and does not care to meet minimum standards of service. We were his only large table and from what i could see he was not so overwhelmed that he could not care to give us the service he was giving others. Where as his smaller tables got lots of time and attention. Night ended and he put us all on one check. Someone asked to have it split and he did so. Thing was he knew pretty much exactly what everyone had. The time it took for him to bring us the split checks, and cash us out was definitely inattentive. We were actually trying to meet our next destination at a certain time but ended up not going because we were waiting for him to cash out our checks. We got the first check at 22:13 and my check personally was not checked out till about 22:33 per my receipts.  with this series of bad events and lack of care for a young gratuity table. that is why 3 stars. My only advice is if you have a large group try your best not to have this server.  automatic gratuity is necessary but should never be an excuse for poor service at a restaurant known for service."
Megan K.,"Las Vegas, NV",573,328,86,4.0,12/4/2013,"I would like to start this review by stating I am more of a Grand Lux Cafe kinda gal. I personally don't LOVE the Cheesecake factory, although they must have caught me on a good day because I loved this particular meal! The menu is huge. I am watching my figure, so I stuck to the Skinny menu. I ordered the Pear Pizza and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely go back just for this.  I also had a few mojitos, they were all very tasty.  Last but certainly not least, a S'mores cheesecake. AMAZING!!!!! It was everything I loved about camping without all the inconvenient stuff (like living outside). I cant wait to try this again!!  The service is always decent at this location. I do have one bone to pick though, WHY do I always seem to get stuck in the super skinny booth??? I felt like I could eat off my booth neighbors plates. I hate that! Next time I am eating at the bar."
Leah L.,"Las Vegas, NV",85,8,8,3.0,11/4/2015,I went for lunch the other day with 2 friends. I ordered the not creamy lemon chicken thing. We also ordered 3 appetizers and 1 other entre. We were there for over 1.5 hours as our food took 40 minutes to see.  It was a monday afternoon. They sat a lady next to the 3 of us 15 minutes after we ordered and she received her food before we did. Terrible. When I finally got my entre it looked good... The mashed potatoes were great. A bit dry after a minute but at first delicious. The chicken although tasted like they had taken an entire lemon and just squirted it on top. Eek. My eyes were twitching.  So I asked the server to please exchange it for the creamy fried herb  lemon chicken my friend had. It's an 18$ dish. It doesnt seem too expensive at first. But when you receive it the chicken is pounded very thin. The outside is not crunchy like you would hope for from breaded chicken. It's nothing more than a large chicken nugget. Tuna appetizer was very small and not the best. The potstickers were just ok. In my opinion it was mediocre. And not worth $120.
Jessica P.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",219,149,794,3.0,9/19/2012,"Okay so I actually had difficulty giving a star rating here! The food is awesome I've been to CCF numerous times and rarely find myself complaining about the food. My goto favorites are as follows: Appetizers: I order the Thai Lettuce Wraps for lunch it comes out beautiful on a huge plate!  I can literally drink the tamarind cashew sauce! Salad: I LOVE the chopped salad. Their balsamic vinegarette is yummy.  Pasta: I have two favorites here, the Bistro Shrimp and the Louisiana chicken. Specialty: the Bang Bang chicken and shrimp omg orange saucy goodness!!!  Fish: You CAN NOT go wrong with the Miso salmon oooommmmmgggg Dessert: brownie sundae cheesecake mmmm I've ordered all of those items a few times! There are tons of options and they seem to do them all well! Now back to my star prob. The service is more often lackluster then great. I might expect awesome service buuuut when you come to my table and say ""what would you like to drink"" it's just rude..... How about ""Hi! I'm so and so""??? The food is awesome, the service blah. So I rate CCF a 3.5"
Rebekah J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,4/18/2014,We went here on st. Patricks day and it was terrible. We were told the wait was 30 minutes but waited over an hour. While we were waiting I noticed a roach on the floor.  The waiter took ten minutes before ordering our drinks once we were seated. My sandwich was burnt. My boyfriend got his food and they told us the fries were being cooked so he had to wait longer for the fries. The second waiter we got was much  better. Had it notbeen for his kindness and staying on top of things I would have left. Service was terrible and the food was gross. We only went because we had a gift card. Not gonna go back that's for sure.
Julia L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,12,5.0,10/27/2015,Great options on the menu! Everything is super tasty and fresh! My kids love the kids menu!
Lily D.,"Las Vegas, NV",158,47,49,4.0,1/6/2014,"Totally love the service, food and of course the desert. I've been lucky enough not wait long for my table like others but the young small, petite, women hostess was not very friendly/professional but the waiters are great.  Recommend: Chicken Madera w/Stake platter. Chicken pot stickers. Calamari a must. Red velvet for desert. Sheerly temple...easy on the ice but other wise delicious!  Note: kids pizza very delicious but too big for 1 child could be shared w/ 2nd child.    Overall Food is always Perfect/ delicious and fresh."
Jade W.,"Las Vegas, NV",677,1185,1232,3.0,2/16/2014,"So this place really isn't the spot that is first on the list to eat for Yeep snobbery, but whether you like their food or reputation it's always a place you know what you're getting and is consistent.  The menu is large and some of that isn't great, but a few things I do like. This visit the BF and I shared the chicken and biscuit. The menu is huge and this was more than enough of a hearty dish to share. We each had a heap of mash potato, a filet of chicken, roasted carrots and a biscuit each. It was actually pretty good....think of a chicken pot pie, deconstructed with biscuits.  Really, I just wanted some cheesecake. I don't like any of the rich flavored ones they do as they are way too sweet and dense. I like the mango key lime which the tartness is nice with the creaminess and we also got a raspberry one which was decent, but the mango key lime was still better.  The service was friendly and pretty decent with refills. She brought us some warm bread and also had the kitchen split our meal into 2 plates.   I rarely go, because why when we have so many options here, but sometimes you just need to Cheesecake."
Evelyn S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",2,11,1,1.0,12/19/2014,"I work for a very large corporate company and can't stress enough on how important it is to give clients a great customer experience.  It is employees like the ones that work for this location, that can make people think twice before coming back.  Our server was very incompetent.  He was by far the worst server i have ever had.  The server neglected to service our table.  He completely forgot about us. We had to ask the manager for our tab and get desert from the ""to go"" register.  The manager was less than concerned.  All she said was a very insincere SORRY. I will make sure to let everyone i know that this location needs help on the service side. As for the chefs, the food is always great."
Sean C.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,5/8/2016,"I was eating here 3 to 4 times a month for years because almost everything on the menu is delicious.  However over the past 6 months or so the service has become horrible.  Firstly, make sure to look at your silverware before using it because on multiple occasions there was large chucks of food on them.  I recently called in a to go order and waited on hold for over 20 minutes just to place the order.  I usually call my orders in before leaving the house so by the time I arrive it will be ready.  By the time was able to place the order I was already in the parking lot.  Waited 40 mintues in the parking lot just to come in and find a line at the register where I waited another 30 minutes because they lost the order of the people in front of me and instead of having a manager deal with it while helping the other 10+ people in line they just made everyone wait.  When it was finally my turn I notice the order they originally brought out for the lady in front of me that had been sitting on the counter for 30+ minutes was mine.  My food was ice cold when I got home and when I called to complain the manager told me I could drive back and they would have another order ready in 30 minutes. After spending a hour and half previously trying to pick up food, the last thing I wanted to do spend another 40 minutes of my life dealing with their incompetence.  The managers careless attitude and simple reply that they were busy will be the reason I will never be going back."
Maga L.,"Las Vegas, NV",107,17,11,4.0,11/4/2016,"we like to go for the large portions (we like next day leftovers), ambiance, and of course cheesecake. service is usually good. staff is friendly."
Gilda K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/28/2015,"My friend and I walked in at around 8:30pm for dinner. We told the hostess that we wanted to sit at a table near the bar and she nodded and said ""okay."" Nobody brought us menu's and we sat there for a good 10 minutes without anyone coming up to us. There were servers coming and going around us. The bartender even took a few glances at us and he didn't even come by. We were very disappointed to not get any service at all! Now I know why there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. I spoke to the hostess and let her know and she mentioned some servers were going home but she will find one for us. Ummmm...okay?! We just left after I saw her talking to a second server that ""might"" want to help us. Will not be going there again!"
Kathi R.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,,4.0,7/22/2015,"Went to celebrate my nieces's 17th birthday and received special treatment all around. I think it was the regular special treatment that all guests receive when they dine here, however, it made it special for her. Clarissa, our server went out of her way to ensure that our party of 10 was well taken care of, offered outstanding suggestions for appetizers, drinks and entrees, as for me this was my first time dining at The Cheesecake Factory - however will not be my last. The staff in all positions were professional, helpful and helped make this day really special. I do recommend reservations for more than 4 people to cut wait time, but they were seating customers quickly."
J J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,23,3,2.0,12/25/2013,"Cheese cake = delicious Other food = bleh The Kobe Burger was burnt even though I asked for medium rare. It tasted like cardboard that's been dried in dead leaves. The cheese cake however was delicious, had a Red Velvet but by the time I ate dessert I was already too full from the unsatisfactory burger and fries."
