Kübra Nur A.,"Istanbul, Turkey",36,4,,5.0,8/19/2015,I've never been here before... It was my first time and everything was delicious. I ate white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and my friend ate hot sundae fudge. I think it was the best... I'll come here again because I wanna eat dinner here. Our waiter is Daniel. He was the perfect
Bugra K.,"West New York, NJ",5,5,15,5.0,8/19/2015,"We stopped by for few desserts, took chocolate fudge, lemon merangue cheesecake and white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, all of them was amazing! Beyond description, plus service was professional and our waiter Daniel was a hilarious man. You know what, we're coming back tomorrow for dinner."
Luigi V.,"Las Vegas, NV",38,14,18,4.0,5/24/2015,"Great food great drinks but food took a little longer than normal, but we got a free cheesecake Manager very nice, came to our table and offer a free desert...."
Jewelyn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1753,849,3199,4.0,11/3/2011,Hey LV Yelpers! I came here the other day for lunch with my bf. It was my second visit here and his first visit to this location. They open at 11am. I love that CF has such a large menu selection and I noticed that they expanded their menu too! So there's something for everyone. Since my few last visits at CF here and in LA... I've been a fan of their miso salmon! If you like fish you have to try it! Great customer service and I love that they have outdoor seating. I'm a fan.
Mike B.,"Las Vegas, NV",172,190,111,4.0,12/29/2013,"I found the breakfast very good,huge serving,as usual and the service was tight. Im trying to find a go to place for breakfast and so far this place is it. Hard to find your favorites when you hit a new city...but I like the fact that I didn't have to wait and there were no screaming babies or obnoxious customers. Overall very pleasant and satisfying."
MJ H.,"Henderson, NV",0,23,2,4.0,9/16/2015,"We love the factory. And thought we would try this new one. ( been here twice now) The menu and restaurant is always nice.  The service was ok. The server did come over to be a bit grumpy, and slow sometimes. but may have been a bad day for him.  the food is always nice, and the atmosphere is always good.  My only comment is that it can be dark at some tables, so can be difficult to read the menu. Other than that. A great place and we will be back."
Mrs. Rip E.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,173,27,5.0,1/1/2015,Love Cheesecake Factory and not for the cheesecake. Great bar. Good drinks with good pours!  Large portions of food. I love their loaded potato soup. Tried their warm crab dip with bread and it was delish!  Grilled chicken Caesar salad is fresh and huge. Service is great. Friendly. We go early so no wait. Can get packed as well as parking lot but it's in a great location so I can see why it would be busy.
Zaria M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,40,2,5.0,7/29/2015,I love cheesecake factory . I love there raspberry lemonade and my family loves the jambalaya. The fettuccine Alfredo is really good. The cake is amazing. The Charlies outrageous cheesecake is so good. My family love the cheesecake.
Carl D.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,27,,4.0,2/9/2014,"Last night we did the Curb-side To Go ordering and were very happy with the result! The food was ready a couple of minutes after we arrived (we got there earlier than expected) and the portion sizes are huge! The food tasted great, I'm sure we'll do this again."
Belinda F.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,30,,1.0,3/16/2016,"Normally  a nice sunny day in Vegas means having lunch on the patio, today it meant a rude waiter and attitude. Edgar, you're a terrible waiter. Being a waitress on the strip for six years and with the company for 10 I know what guest service is... You, are terrible. First off, coming to the table and not making eye contact with the people you are speaking to is not ok. Second your stance is confrontational, almost like you were looking to brawl. It's aggressive and not very welcoming. I would like to say you were at some point just overwhelmed with your tables but as I continued to watch you, I realized, no you're just a terrible waiter. You didn't care to engage you didn't care to answer questions and you didn't even bring me out spoons for my cheese cake. Seriously, who brings dessert and no spoons? I would like to point out that I wanted another orange juice and my boyfriend another glass of wine but you wouldn't know because you never asked. It's ok Also, I get there are busboys but if they aren't around it means you clear my table, you're not above clearing a table. For the record I cleared most of my dishes onto the dirty table next to me since my table wasn't cleaned once during our meal. I did have to ask twice for the check the second time you pretended like I never asked a first time. You're also human and not above being able to say I forgot let me go get it. But passing blame is easier. What a stressful lunch. Honestly, my cheese cake didn't even taste good after all this. My experience out weighed the potential to have a good lunch. It will be a while if I ever come back to eat here I would be too afraid to have your section. Not to mention kona grill is remodeled and looking way more appealing than a waiter who seems to want to fight me and ignore me."
David B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,1,4.0,7/16/2014,"Well, my family and I decided on the Cheesecake Factory for an early dinner. When we arrived, the hostess cheerfully greeted us and swiftly seated us. My two grandchildren ordered sliders and French fries with ketchup on the side. My wife ordered lettuce wraps. Now I need to tell you how picky and particular she is with this dish. After the first bite, her comment was ""this is the best lettuce wraps I've ever had."" My daughter ordered a grilled vegetable salad which was excellent. Last but not least, I ordered Boulliabaise, over a large bed and portion of spegattini rested fresh muscles, clams, shrimp and white fish. Another excellent dish and choice experience a fine meal. We will make the Cheesecake Factory a special place for us to dine. Thank you so much!"
Kimberli I.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,1,1.0,8/26/2015,"I usually love the Cheesecake Factory but, his last time they sat us by the server area. We could hear everything they were complaining about. The servers were running back and forth like crazy and it was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think. I had the chicken lettuce wraps and my husband had the Shepard's pie. Although,The food was very appetizing. Late that night I woke up with food poisoning. I hadn't had anything else earlier that day to eat so, I came to the conclusion that maybe the chicken was bad. Down and out for 3 days. No fun! Was very displease with this last experience here. It's going to take me a while before I tempt to eat here again."
Chris M.,"June Lake, CA",0,119,11,4.0,4/3/2015,"Went here this past weekend and gorged on their most popular chicken dish, I think it was the Chicken Costoletta.  We had appetizers, the warm asparagus salad and cheesecake, of course.  They were super busy, but even through their business, Alex was an amazing server.  He was cheerful and thoughtful.....he made us laugh.  :) It was an addition that made our night better.  Food was great, dessert was insanely great and service was phenomenal.  It just gets so busy and the setting is pretty loud so we don't come here often."
Val A.,"Las Vegas, NV",70,16,3,5.0,3/30/2014,Love love love cheesecake factory! Spicy chicken chipotle pasta is my all time favorite! Pair it up with the Red velvet cheesecake &its a wrap! Always very fast&friendly service. Well earned 5stars
Lorenza E.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,5,,5.0,5/5/2015,It's my favorite restaurant no matter where I'm at! Today I tried the Godiva cheesecake and OMG! It was as amazing as it sounds!
Al B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,8/18/2015,"Going twice a week to same location but this time is gonna be the last time. Horrible service, the gentleman who served us didn't want to come and ask if we need anything. Took at least 10 to 15 min to make a order after I asked about a meal he said I have to be at the different table and I'll be back. He was gone for 10 min again. I asked for brown bred he brought a white one and just dropped at the table and was gone. We had to ask a lady to get it but she just told him that. Now he brought only 1 peace and we where 3 person at the table and it was dry and cold. We had to ask if he could refill our water never happen, he never come just walked by. We asked for straws as well never received any. This service change our mind to come there again. I better drive to different locations but not there."
Katherine G.,"Las Vegas, NV",216,39,193,3.0,1/10/2014,"One of my favorite dish is the Chicken Madiera. It has melted cheese and mushroom on top of chicken filet and mashed potatoes that was good with the Madiera sauce. Their portion can feed 2 people so my husband and I shared it.  I wasn't a fan of the service though. I knew they were busy, but that's normal for Cheesecake Factory. Our server asked us if we wanted a fruit plate for my toddler and we said yes, but they never brought it to us.  All of our dishes came out, except my toddlers meal came last. Which you would think would come with the rest or be the first one out. Especially, it being just noodles and Alfredo sauce. Time for dessert and our server was nowhere to be found. When I finally found him, I just skipped the dessert and asked for the check."
Jasmine R.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",5,17,4,2.0,1/8/2015,"Well, for starters: we were told we would be seated in 15-20 minutes. 25 minutes later we confront the hostess who goes ""Well, we said 15-20 minutes, and it's only been 25."" Um, ok. Anyways, another 15 minutes after that (40 minutes in total) we get seated.  The waitress was nice and processed our orders quickly and efficiently. HOWEVER! The food was meh, to say the least. The bread was good as usual, but everything else was bland. I got the Renee's Special, which is a soup/sandwich/salad combo. I try to eat relatively healthy (lots of protein, no additives) so restaurant food is usually a flavor overload. Nope! The tortilla soup tasted like lukewarm salty water. My sandwich was OK tasting but the bread was so hard I had to break away the top layer to even bite through it! For 11 bucks I can get a better combo at Subway. I'm disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory!"
Edward D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,4,5.0,9/2/2014,"Second time we had Cynthia as our server, she's very cheerful and knowledgeable about the menu. Which is useful as their menu is rather large. The Restaurant was clean and really makes you forgot your in Las Vegas. I also remembered on previous visits the granite floor tiles were super greases to the point I thought I was going slip. This time however it was not the case. It would be nice for ya some plain ice tea, instead of that flower tasting kind."
Charissa H.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,1.0,8/4/2015,"Called and ordered for takeout. I was told our food would be ready in 30 minutes. Well, we ended up waiting over an hour. I get that it was busy but if they would have given me a more accurate wait time we would have gone and got food somewhere else. Our entrees were ready, we were mostly sitting around waiting for cheesecake. So our nice hot dinner was sitting there getting cold while we were waiting for a good 30 minutes for a chilled dessert. Makes sense, right? And to top it all off, we get home only to realize our side orders were missing. We will not be eating here again."
