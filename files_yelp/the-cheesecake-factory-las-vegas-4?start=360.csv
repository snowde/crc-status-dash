Lynn S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,29,,4.0,7/29/2015,Pretty good food for an affordable price and large portions. I love to come for lunch. There is a good selection to choose from and even healthier options. Also if u want to cheat a little there's always delicious cheesecakes to choose from. Solo many of them!
Jaymee L.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,77,9,5.0,10/8/2013,Another all-time fave restaurant in Vegas ~  The food selection is tremendous and I end up ordering the same thing almost every time I dine here ~ Pasta Carbonara with chicken or shrimp ^_^ and of course I order a different cheesecake each time because they are all delicious.  Their happy hour is a definite reason to come back ~ half off appetizers and drinks.
Nicolette H.,"Las Vegas, NV",356,184,46,4.0,6/10/2013,"Love the food here, love the cheesecake. If I could live here and eat cheesecake all my life, I would. Don't judge. I've been here multiple times and have tried quite a few things on their extensive menu, and I don't have any complaints. I usually pick the same cheesecake when I come here but I've had the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake, the Red Velvet, and the Caramel one. All are awesome. I know this place gets busy but sometimes the service is lacking. The other day I went with my friend here for lunch and there were two empty, dirty tables next to us that took over a half an hour to get bussed, Ew. Come on guys, it wasn't even busy during that time."
Colleen T.,"Las Vegas, NV",206,199,5,3.0,6/7/2013,"Aright, so I came here and tried the Veggie burger since my friend told me it was pretty good, and surprise! It was.  It is an actual hand made Veggie burger full of veggie and rice and what not, though it does have a purple tint to it because of the beets, I think, it tastes just fine. It comes with fries YESSSAA which are pretty darn good and on a nice bun. It is a little soft, so some people might have it fall apart on them, but I didn't so that was good. It really tells you something when the Cheesecake Factory can make their own Veggie burger and other places, who claim to be all down with Vegetarians, cannot."
L E.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,30,,5.0,8/7/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is my go to restaurant. I've never had a bad meal.  The Rampart location in Las Vegas is much better then the District location. Its cleaner, faster and has a better view. Oddly enough I'm not a fan of their cheesecake but I am a huge fan of their chicken dishes.  Their burgers are also great.  I've never been unhappy with a meal from the Cheesecake factory.  I would advise getting their before 6 pm as it gets very busy with long wait times after 6 pm."
Jared J.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,5,,4.0,9/15/2014,"Huge fan of this place.. I visited yesterday on a busy Sunday.. and even though we were a huge party  and it was slammed, they got us in quickly and in a friendly way.. The servers where awesome.. They took interest in our party.. The food was excellent and spot on.. I cannot say enough good things about this place.. Love it."
Danny G.,"Caldwell, ID",12,14,22,2.0,7/5/2013,Amazing Mac and Cheese Burger. Dreadful Pizza. ..There were ants on the table.
Taeler H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,56,4,4.0,5/14/2015,Great food here. We had steak and cheesecake. Sat in the bar to avoid long wait time. Good experience.
Paul M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,8,,5.0,6/15/2015,I love the Factory Burger here. It's a little different with the brioche bun but still retains its classic American burger taste.  The location is great so  I never have to leave my Summerlin bubble.  I usually just eat at the bar where I get fantastic service every time.
Christina A.,"Ventura, CA",403,405,152,4.0,10/19/2011,"I really like the curry dish here. I think it is called Shrimp Chicken Bang Bang. Although iti s $18 it is a very large portion. The shrimp and chicken are seasoned before cooking. Plus, there is toasted coconut all over it. Very good. My fiance got the chinese bun tacos. He said they were excellent.  I also love the eggplant sandwich with snow peas and carrots for the side.  I try to go here on an ""off-time"" because it can get very very busy."
Brendan N.,"Port Moody, Canada",5,88,36,4.0,11/7/2014,This is our go to restaurant when we travel as it has proven to be very consistent. Tonight we had the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken and chicken piccata with mashed potatoes. Service is quick and food comes rather quickly. The portions are generous as well.
John H.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,80,7,2.0,7/18/2014,The cheesecake factory use to be the place to go... not anymore the food portions have been reduced in size dramatically as well as the size of the cheesecakes. The quality is nothing what it once was. Yet the prices have only gone up.   Cheesecake factory is now nothing more than a chain restaurant and it shows.  It's now nothing more than a fancy Marie Callender's.. no thanks for me anymore.
David C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,2.0,10/12/2015,"We have been here a number of times and enjoyed it. .  the bill was $46 for 2 cheeseburgers and 1 slice of cheesecake and 1 diet coke.  $13.50 for a cheeseburger? $8.00 for a slice of cheesecake that is nearly all whipped cream?They raised their prices and are now at a ridiculous level. You can go to a gourmet Burger bar on the strip and get a burger for nearly the same price. The server tried to charge us for a red velvet cheesecake that we did not order. Did not tell us their was an additional price for a side Caesar salad with the burger a $1.50 charge for a slice of cheese. Food is always good, but their prices are getting stupid. I can sit down and heve a beautiful dinner at one of the better Italian restaurants off strip for what I paid for that meal! ."
Aaron R.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",84,119,197,3.0,6/18/2013,Sweet corn tamale cakes were delish! Vietnamese tacos sucked! Service was below average.  5 stars for the tamale cakes minus 1 star for the sucky service and minus 1 star for the sucky Vietnamese tacos=3 stars
ron c.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,53,41,3.0,3/8/2015,The server was busy.  But justin who ran our food was more helpful then the server.  Food is always on point quality but could use sense of urgency on service
Michelle S.,"Hayward, CA",16,68,107,4.0,1/18/2015,"Really clean , really busy we waited about 20minutes to be seated which is pretty good for a Sunday night.  We didn't wait long to meet our waiter who was friendly,funny  and checked up on us frequently. The bread was hot, fresh and delicious. They gave us a good amount of time to place our order and our food came quick. The appetizer we ordered was spinach artichoke dish which was delicious and plenty. We were pretty much stuffed from the dip plate and the bread. My son had the kids mac n cheese and says the cheesiness was just right, he liked that it was not yellow. He also like that he got several refills on his sprite and if this review was up to just him he would give it a 5 star rating.  My daughter had the kids spaghetti and one meatball. She claims the meatball crust was too hard and the noodles were too thick but the sauce was good and the meatball was flavorful. She also would rather have another meatball and less noodles. Daddy had the steak Dianne. He ordered it medium well but it came out medium rare but was ok with it because of the quality if the steak. The mashed potatoes was plentiful and really yummy. Some of the mushrooms were burnt but it did not mess up the taste. This dish had less sauce this time than it usually does but all the flavors were still there.  I had the chicken picatta. The noodles were aldente. The dish was very flavorful but very light on the stomach as well. We were anxious to get to dessert and share a raspberry type cheesecake but our stomachs got full too quick. Our waiter was quick to come back with the check and To go boxes. The bathrooms were clean and well supplied. This restaurant is on our list for our special occasion spots."
Jessica A.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,55,54,5.0,12/28/2014,"I'm a little confused why the reviews aren't higher. In my humble opinion, you can't really order anything wrong from this menu. My food is always fresh and hot and the service is great. I had one issue with the curbside service but it was handled promptly. This my sound pretty basic, but the Cheesecake Factory is one of my favs!"
Desiree M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,23,45,5.0,1/31/2015,I love eating here. Huge menu selection and healthy choices if you want. I really like the barbeque chicken salad. Large enough to bring half home as leftovers!
Lauren T.,"Las Vegas, NV",242,415,57,3.0,6/15/2013,"It's a franchise chain so I don't know why I wrote this. The Yelp Gods summoned me to do so. The food is okay since they serve it over a hundred times a day, especially with sauces and dressings that are too salty but the bread is always good. But I did have to ask for water twice. The server was polite.  It is what it is at this particular Cheesecake Factory."
Liz A.,"Las Vegas, NV",39,42,,2.0,9/11/2016,we had the worse experience there the waitress was the worse she was a very heavy woman young and she made it seem if i wanted something it was a annoyance for her--i ordered a pasta dish with shrimp and the shrimp was good but the plain pasta was so dry and i wanted some sauce on it and she never came back to ask me if everything was ok--it was my birthday lunch with my husband and it was a big dissapointment---
