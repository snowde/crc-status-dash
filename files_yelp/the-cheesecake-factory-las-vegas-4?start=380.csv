LA S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,2.0,3/6/2016,Disappointed.   The bread they brought out was hard and burnt.   Ordered nachos with spicy chicken -  the chips were burnt  and chicken was tasteless.   Also ordered the meatballs with cheese bread and ricotta - it was just ok.   The cheesecake was the only good thing.   Service was good.
Alfonso D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,36,12,3.0,3/8/2015,"The service is great very friendly staff, the fried shrimp really good, ribeye also and the filet mignon awesome but the fish tacos bad Baka fresh or rubios have better tacos by far, no flavor, no salsa, the tortillas broke, deserts good"
Ashley S.,"Brooklyn, NY",373,160,184,1.0,12/21/2012,"The only reason I'd come back here, is for the cheesecake, TO GO! The other night a couple friends and I were craving dessert and cocktails so we sat down and ordered some cheesecake. My boyfriend had the vietnamese tacos which were supposed to be more like the ""bao sandwiches"" with the soft bao bread.  --Well, it should have been soft bao bread but it was burnt and hard!! They served it to us like they didn't care to serve burnt bread.  SO DISAPPOINTING!  I ordered the Kahlua cheesecake and a friend ordered the tiramisu. It wasn't that good, compared to other ones I've had (red velvet, Godiva, and strawberry)  The service was OK. We had asked for some of that whole wheat ""chocolate bread"" and our server had told us that she would bring it out when it was done-- BUT she never did. I swear our server kept returning to our table, never mentioning the bread because I felt like she was trying to make us forget that we had asked for it.  It frustrated me so I reminded her that we asked for it and she brought us two loaves.  Another friend got a vanilla milkshake and it wasn't that great."
Lisa G.,"Benicia, CA",136,188,624,5.0,4/23/2013,"We went for dessert late at night .  You have to try the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake.  A Cheesecake Factory Original - Layers of Moist Chocolate Cake, Chewy Brownie, Toasted Coconut-Pecan Frosting and Creamy Chocolate Chip Coconut Cheesecake.  I am not much of a desert eater, but this one knocks it out of the park for me!  So good!  Chocolate cake, brownie, toasted coconut and chocolate chips with whipped cream?  Oh man this doesn't miss a thing!"
Deirdra S.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,87,70,4.0,9/28/2013,"Update! Love the Fire Roasted Artichokes, Ahí Tartare, Mediterránean Taco Wraps - sooo Yummo! (They removed the Mediterranean Tacos I loved sooo much :-/  Why do restaurants do that? My other fav: White Chicken Chili w Brown Rice!!! Yes, please =) Anyways, still a fav... I will continue to visit... your constant companion, ~deirdra"
Carl B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",254,233,56,4.0,10/23/2014,I only give it 4 stars because I ordered a catering for 12 people and it was 20 minutes late. Food is typical Cheesecake Factory - very good just beware if you cater to order with plenty of time to spare.
Zhanna R.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,20,15,4.0,9/29/2014,"One of my favorite places to have dessert, cheese cake, of course, also great cappuccino :-)"
Steve T.,"Las Vegas, NV",122,17,,5.0,10/3/2014,Had a very good dinner tamale corn cakes and Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta which was great.
Mary P.,"Las Vegas, NV",311,73,227,5.0,10/10/2012,"Who doesn't like Cheesecake Factory?!! This place is all things to all people but they are far different than these other establishments that try to please everyone. The other places lack in quality because they are trying too hard to offer too many mediocre dishes. This place has both quantity of menu items to choose from and they are prepared with quality as well. Although your Vietnamese spring rolls or your sweet corm tamales aren't the most authentic you've ever had, they are pretty darn tasty. And I don't know about y'all but I'll take tasty over authenticity anytime. That's why I'm the only Asian you'll see at PF Chang's. Haha. Today I was there for my friends bday. I just started eating clean--so to speak, so I ordered the most compliant item I could find and that was the Kobe burger. It had three ingredients. Very basic and consisting of: tomato, mushrooms, and grilled onion. I got it protein style of course. I normally would never, ever order a burger without cheese but I had to this time. For how plain it was I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It was Sofa King good! So flavorful with juices dripping out from the wrapper. I was not embarrassed to be heard slurping that stuff up. Not gonna waste any of that tasty burger grease. But please people, don't order a Kobe burger if it's gonna be hotter than med-rare. That's just a waste of good meat. If you're scared of a little pink in the middle, stick to your fast food burger joints.  And of course...who doesn't order a cheesecake when they're at CCF? Me. Whomp, whomp. I had to stick with the bowl of strawberries. But for those that are not on a primal aka caveman aka paleo diet, they have just about any type of decadent combinations a (non-pregnant) person could think of. I will have to treat myself to one of these some other time in the distant future."
Camille G.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,55,3,4.0,7/21/2013,"I don't have much to offer that hasn't already been said - long wait, super busy, packed to the rafters chain restaurant.  I became very cozy with my neighbors children on our most recent visit. I did however have my best meal ever at TCF, Hibachi Steak. Totally random item I have never seen anyone mention,  but it was amazing. Our waitress warned me it was ""spicy"", which it wasn't,  it could have used more spice in my opinion.  But she said that abput our appetizer and warned me my lemon raspberry cheesecake was very tart.  We clearly have different taste buds. I just wish it wasn't so over priced, so over seated and so loud."
May S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,1,1.0,1/23/2016,Just walked into the lobby for dinner and the lobby is packed.  I Walked around the restaurant and counted 15+ open tables.  When I asked the manager he said it was because of a shift change.    I've been in many Cheese Cake Restaurants and never seen one this mis-managed.
Christina T.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,41,1,3.0,6/22/2014,"The food was excellent, that is not the reason for 3 stars. I am a bit of a service snob after working in the service industry for 10 years. With that said, we waited entirely too long in between courses with items getting left behind. I ordered a soup for dinner and mine was last to come out after people got steak. Then we had one person order dessert, when the dessert came rhe waiter came back and asked if we wanted anymore dessert. We said no again and waited another 10 minutes for him to bring the check. This is not only horrible for a guest whose dinner normally would take no longer than an hour but for the business as their turn over time is much higher allowing less opportunity for guests to come in. Longer wait times both at the table and in line equals less return customers. Overall the food was great and the Georgia peach beverage was refreshing."
Douglas W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,9/22/2015,"No reservations after 5pm, what kind of joint are you running, I'm already not a fan of your corporate set up or your food and now I can't make a reservation for a birthday party, ridiculous, I know where I don't want to go for my birthday. I'm taking a group of 15 people to a place I don't want to go to and I get to pay and I can't even get a table set up, Wow that's awesome"
Tara B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,3/12/2015,We are sitting at this restaurant serves salty pasta and now have waited 30 more minutes and the food is not out.  Will not be back here for my bday. After an hour we get word something is wrong with the pasta. Needless to say we have left and we wont be back after others had complained before us. They should have figured out what was going on earlier.  You guys need a better management staff that listens to the customers.
Silvia N.,"Las Vegas, NV",50,21,44,5.0,6/24/2014,I usually order take out from here when we are not in the mood to cook dinner. The service is always great in person when picking up and also over the phone when we place our order. Food is always packed neatly and stays fresh in the Togo containers. We always get chicken samosas as an appetizer every time we order. Great place for families.
Brenda L.,"Las Vegas, NV",327,436,1240,3.0,7/17/2010,"5 stars for their White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake! 3 stars for the service and 3 stars for the food on a Friday lunch with no lunch rush. The service seemed to die down once we ordered our food and we had to wait a good 15 minutes after we finished eating to find the server to get us a box. (Maybe there was a lunch rush and I was not aware of it.) For an appetizer we ordered the Crispy Cheese Sticks. It was crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. This is definitely worth trying and getting for next time. I generally like the Cheesecake Factory and since I'm boring and set in my ways, I normally order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta or the Miso Salmon. I decided on the Miso Salmon, because they did not offer a lunch portion of the Bistro Shrimp. The salmon looked a lil overcooked with its blackened edges and as I took a bite, it was a lil dry. The flavor was not what I remembered, but maybe it's because I normally get it with the mashed potatoes instead of the white rice. Anyhow, I was disappointed with my lunch. My sister ordered the kids cheese pizza. It was probably about a 10incher and very cheesy. She said it was good, but had a funny taste. I think overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the entrees but maybe they just had an off day. I will definitely be returning for some yummy cheesecake though!"
michael i.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,9,,1.0,7/20/2015,"The sugar caddy at our table was empty the waiter was nowhere to be found, so I saw a manager (tall guy black hair and black glasses) talking to a waitress at a side station.  I got up to ask him for some more sugar and they completely  ignored me and went about their conversation.  so I asked a busboy waking by. This manager had the audacity to come to my table to ask was everything ok after he finished his conversation and I revived my sugar. when I asked him why he would ignore a customer asking for something and continued his conversation with his waitress he had the nerve to say that customers don't usually walk up to side stations. If there was sugar on the table and a waiter that could be found I wouldn't have to get up in the first place. This is not The way you treat paying customers.  Needless to say this manager who has zero idea how to handle customers ruined one of my favorite spots."
Alexa R.,"Las Vegas, NV",455,156,35,2.0,4/22/2015,"Came here with a friend last night started off with a super nice waitress that took our order fast then after a 10 or so minute wait some other waitress comes by and says she's ours that ""they had things to figure out"". The food wasn't terrible but could have been better. We decide to order dessert and mine had a hair inside!! It literally flossed my teeth as I was pulling it out of my mouth! I was so disgusted my friend explained to our new waitress that it was gross I didn't want mine and she'll take a new one as she was scared that hers might have hair in it too since it was the same flavor. She brought me a new one when I said I didn't want another one...I was pretty grossed out a brand new slice is not what I asked for. Then the bill came and my cheesecake was still on there! $8 for a slice of cheesecake with hair in it? No thank you. So I ask for a manager and after waiting 10 minutes he finally comes by and is upset with me!! Wow, what amazing customer service that was. We tipped her $5 but I feel like there is no point in tipping someone who can't do their job. I can still feel that hair in my mouth today...I doubt I'll be returning to this location at least."
Nicole L.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,131,33,4.0,6/12/2013,"I have been here a number of times over the years. I have come for lunch, dinner, and dessert. I have also bought desserts at the counter for holidays. Never have done the take-out. The staff is always good and I have never had a ""bad"" experience. You just have to know going in that it will be busy, there will be a wait, and you will most likely not get a booth but those horrible small tables that are shoved next to each other and then you are eating with strangers. I hate that. Tiramisu cheesecake is my favorite."
Cynthia C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,27,8,1.0,1/11/2016,"I took my brother, his girlfriend, and our mother out to lunch this weekend. I was seriously so excited because I had been on a Cheesecake Factory kick the last 2 months and was happy my family was coming. It was a Sunday and it really wasn't that busy around 3:00. The server we had took 20 minutes to even come to the table after we were seated. Then only offered water and bread and walked away before I could even get the other drink orders in, and seemed irritated after we had asked for more than water. Both bathrooms were absolutely disgusting, there was vomit all over both, and it had clearly been there for a little while. My mother ordered the fish tacos, and apparently was the only one who made a safe choice. The 3 of us however, all ordered a meal with chicken and all 3 of us got food poisoning. I don't know what happened on Sunday, but I am seriously so disappointed in that entire meal. Normally this place is 5 stars, but this is absolutely unacceptable."
