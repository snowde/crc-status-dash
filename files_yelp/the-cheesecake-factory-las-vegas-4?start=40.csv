Cheryl C.,"Linden Hills, Minneapolis, MN",0,5,3,1.0,4/26/2017,Do not waste your time on curbside to go unless you have an hour to spare. It is difficult to order as it appears only one person in the restaurant can take curbside delivery orders.  Then all food is not ready at appointed time and another 20 minutes later the wrong beverage is delivered and in 2 small containers as out of regular sized containers.  By now the food is cold.   A manager is suppose to come over and yet no one is here.  What has happened to Cheesecake Factory?  It use to be top notch.
April N.,"Henderson, NV",0,18,45,4.0,10/19/2017,"Went here with my bf after the Halloweentown pumpkin patch since it was within walking distance. I really loved the ambience of this place, exterior and interior. We came on a Monday night and were seated right away although there were larger parties ahead of us. I got the spicy cashew chicken and my bf got the carne asada steak medallions. Both were very good, especially the first bite of my spicy cashew chicken. It had strong flavorings but wasn't as spicy as the name. My server knew so he brought out chili peppers for me, which kinda helped! It was good but got kind of salty after a while so I decided to take it home for lunch the next day. We also wanted dessert and since the place is called Cheesecake Factory we opted for a slice of regular cheesecake. It was pretty sweet but eating it with the whipped cream given definitely complemented the taste! Overall, I would come back and maybe try the other dishes!"
Barbara O.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,48,16,5.0,10/11/2017,"They are so consistent at all of thief places. Even the one in Waikiki is great, although the wait can be very long at that one."
Aline P.,"Campinas, Brazil",22,4,,5.0,9/20/2017,"This is probably my favorite place. Always busy in lunch time on weekends, but I never wait more than 15 minutes. The service is excellent and always fast even in busy days. Don't forget to try chicken bellagio, it's the best."
Butterfly L.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,23,3,2.0,9/17/2017,"My husband and I drove over 30 minutes to eat at this restaurant. We were seated fairly quickly. The Potstickers we good. My husband entree, Steak Diane was delicious. However, my Chicken Marsala was so dry...very dry! I couldn't taste the Marsala at all. It seemed to not have any seasoning whatsoever. The butterfly noodles used for this entree was a horrible choice. As it dried all of the seasoning. Just gross! Will never order that entree again!!!"
Steve L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,88,8,1.0,6/24/2017,"So my wife and I went to the Cheesecake factory in Summerlin again to give this place another try. Last time i got hit on the head by people in the walkway. This time the server was having a bad night and FAILED to check the orders.  Nancy's plate had no sauce and nor did the salid but the crime was in the Woman's restroom,  just take a look at this mess my wife found? Im starting to look elsewhere to go for cheesecake."
Chad R.,"Brentwood, CA",29,52,211,1.0,9/12/2017,"I went on September 12, 2017 @ 7:00. After using the free valet service I walked into the restaurant and asked about sitting outside for 1. The lady up front said it would be a 10 minute wait. I said ok I'll wait. Once I was called and seated outside. The waitress kept walking by 15 times with only 2 other parties outside at the time. At this point I was getting pissed. But I continued to wait till a lady finally Came (can't remember her name) and took my food & drink order. Once my food came out she never came by to check on me and by this time there was only 1 other party seated outside. I kept waving her down but she never stopped to see what I needed. After a haft hour I finally was able to get her and asked about getting a Togo box and the dessert menu. 20 minutes went by no Togo box or dessert menu. Another 20 minutes went by finally she brings me the menu and Togo box. Then another 20 minutes she finally came back and took my dessert order for Togo. She immediately brought me my bill and told me the order for the cheesecake is in it will be about 5 minutes. Well 5 minutes turned into a 50 minute dessert for Togo. Finally left the restaurant at 9:30.  I did come into contact with a manger (heavy guy) that could care less. He pretty much said here's the corporate number have a great day.  Come on 2 hours of just sitting and receiving bad service? NEVER AGAIN. CORPORATE WILL BE CONTRACTED."
Vilma D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",140,73,100,4.0,6/17/2017,"Great place to have dinner with family or friends.  Staff were friendly.  Food was delish. They come in big portions and the ambience was great.  The only thing I don't like about the place is the lighting.  It's too dim and a bit loud.  Pam, our waitress, was very friendly and checked on us frequently.  Will definitely dine here again."
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,4.0,3/10/2017,"Ahh Lets See.. The Cheesecake Factory Summerlin which is located in Boca Park was pretty decent! I usually have crazy dining experiences with this place however I started to learn what exactly to come for. If you are a Cheesecake Factory fan you know that the menu is insanely overwhelming so it really takes patience to figure out what you want. I was introduced to there short window happy hour (4pm-6pm) a few months ago and fell in love! The prices are so doable and you really can get a bang for your buck when it comes to both the food and the drinks! I went in to this location hoping it would be just as good as the other one that's in the Premium Outlets! It was! Not only is this one closer to home, but it's more fancy and the service was great! Our server was very friendly and attentive! She was even able to get me to try some new appetizers that I've never tried before which was the nachos! That's always a good way to win me over as a customer when you can have great conversation, make suggestions and extremely attentive! Can you say Great Tip '-) For these nachos to be just an appetizer you can easily share with another person. If you're like me and want to take advantage of the entire happy hour menu grab some friends and order everything on the menu. Ball out! My suggestion would be to go not right at 4PM which is the start of happy hour because finding a table top or even a table in the bar area is competitive. You literally have people preying on these tables waiting for people to get up so they can swoop on in like a hawk haha. I arrived around 5:15 PM which is when the first greedy crowd is about ready to wrap it on up!. After about 3 long island ice tea's in and pigging out on the spinach dip, crab dip, wontons, sliders, and nachos it was my time to GO! Thanks to the Summerlin team I now can add another happy hour spot to my list! Their runner up (Kona Grill) is walking distance and has a fantastic happy hour as well!"
Gabriella L.,"La Palma, CA",16,7,6,1.0,10/3/2017,"The worst Cheesecake Factory location I have ever been to. Food was distasteful. Staff was rude, also, when I first walked inside, it wasn't very busy, however it took about 5 mins for someone to come to the hostess booth to seat us. Bathrooms were filthy. There was poo and period stains on the toilet, a dirty diaper on the floor, no toilet seat covers, no toilet paper, and the pad/tampon trash was full, you can see the bloody applicators. Granted customers left the restroom dirty, but it didn't seem as if they were checking up on the restrooms at all. I was literally trying not to throw up my food while I was in the restroom as I was already gagging in disgust. I didn't even use the restroom. We went here for my friends birthday and I felt as if they thought we were lying about it being his birthday."
Sasha K.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,8,4,3.0,2/15/2017,"Cheesecakes are amazing, the best, and the food is really good when you want to fill out your stomach.  To go, it's a dream. When you have dinner, the location is very noisy, the wait is really long and i never understood how it is possible to wait so long when tables are available. Yesterday, for Valentines, I came up with my lady and they asked us to wait 10 mn when 3 tables of 2 people were available right away...  Also, some staff members are super cool, some others are not and bring your cheesecake but not the forks, or the drinks you ordered because they are too busy.  So to recap : food 5 stars, service 2 stars..."
Aaron Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",9,32,10,5.0,6/18/2017,Great dinner. Portion was so big I'm struggling with dessert but there could be worse things in my life:-)
Lu C.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,28,75,4.0,7/19/2017,Good restaurant ! Clean and employees very professional. Just I would taste the whipped cream with my dessert but I think she has forgotten lol
Savannah J.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,14,34,3.0,6/24/2017,"6/22. We came here at 4pm, seemed to be the very end of lunch but before they got busy for dinner. We were able to be seated right away, and our waiter was very nice throughout our meal. My problem mainly lies with the kitchen. They brought us our bread, which definitely was hard and stale, as if it had just been sitting for awhile. For an appetizer we ordered the chicken dumplings, which were okay but we're definitely quite dry on the inside. For our entrees, I ordered the chicken Marsala(like I always do) and my husband got a bacon burger. His burger was just fine, but my Marsala was swimming in oil, and my chicken was covered in pepper. It was just a very underwhelming experience, to say the least!"
Tasha J.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,6,10,5.0,1/12/2017,"What a wonderful experience! Clean, warm, energetic atmosphere with a feel of privacy. Not overcrowded at all. The hospitality is warm, inviting and pleasant.  I ordered the Vietnamese summer rolls as an appetizer and garlic noodles for an entree closing it out with chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. The bread alone was great, but every morsel my fork touched was like an upgrade from the last bite!! Extremely well seasoned with perfect temperature to dive right in! Worth every penny then some"
Poco P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1616,372,2558,3.0,8/7/2016,"You can't really mess up wine & bartenders friendly, but we kept getting a whiff of a dirty sink smell that made our visit shorter.  Love the location."
Christine C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,7,,2.0,9/16/2017,"I've been enjoying the Cheesecake Factory with my family for many years, mostly in California. We tried this one today since we now live in Summerlin Las Vegas and were quite disappointed. Service was very slow. Waitress was very unpleasant, snappy, and unfriendly .  Is it so difficult to smile?  At the end she just threw the bill on the table and then grabbed my credit card out of my hand instead of using the small black folder that every other waitress was using, then came back with that black folder in one hand- empty!- and my credit card in her other hand...it was weird"
Angela Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,4,1,5.0,6/29/2017,"We had a family lunch on Thursday and it has been a pleasant experience. We were three of us, and asked to be seated on a booth. They promptly escorted us to a booth of six, without knowing that we intended spending a lot of money there. We ordered avocado egg rolls, two Tuscan Asparagus chicken from skinny DELICIOUS menu, Americana Cheeseburger, strawberry smoothie, Mojito Pineapple, and ultimately the Tiramisu Cake! I don't know which meal was better than the other! Definitely, the Tuscan chicken was succulent and tasty, my mojito was amazing, strawberry smoothie very well done, and tiramisu like I was in Italy. Definitely we will come back next week! Thanks for your service and strongly recommended!"
Robert C.,"Las Vegas, NV",59,13,5,1.0,6/3/2017,Food was pretty good but wait time was longer than normal. We felt rushed through like cattle. Waiter was very dry and asked us if we needed a box about 12 min into meal.    I said yes. When the wife said no he just swooped up her plate and walked off half way through her meal!   The people that were seated after us were served first. I rarely give a negative review but this deserved it! Won't be back.
Jennifer Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",576,332,323,2.0,1/7/2017,"This location sucks. Made reservations the day before and was seated 15 mins after the reservation time. Our server sucked completely. He was given way too many tables and barely checked on us.  The food was okay, the pasta was still hard and forgot a few of our items and still charged us. The Jamaican shrimp were awesome, avocado toast was perfect, shrimp sausage pasta was horrible, alfredo was bad, kids meal was fine (I had to take a bite of my brothers food) After 20 minutes, the manager came by and took it off.  Definitely going to the other locations cause their food is bombbbbb."
