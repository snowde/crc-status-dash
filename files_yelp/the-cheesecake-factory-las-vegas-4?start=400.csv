Randoll C.,"Los Angeles, CA",582,1424,6023,4.0,4/13/2011,"Brought a friend to Las Vegas this weekend for her birthday and to see my dad.  It's her birthday so I let her pick where she wants to go all weekend, including dinner on Saturday. She picks Cheesecake Factory. Short wait as we opted to sit outside under the heat lamps. We're one of three parties who braved the chilly night but it wasn't too cold that we were miserable.  The service was awesome. I don't remember his name but it's guys like our server that make dining experiences memorable.  My friend had a Kobe burger that was cooked just as she ordered it. The cooks even cut it in half for her as per her request.  I opted for the Salisbury Steak which was so good that my friend had a few bites. The mashed potatoes complimented the entree and both meals came out piping hot.  Parking seems like it can be trying but we lucked out right away."
Jon H.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,10,,4.0,2/3/2015,"Based on the ratio of positive and negative reviews I guess we got lucky. Immediate seating for my family of four at 6:20pm on a Tuesday. The hostess was pleasant upon our arrival, and she wished us a good evening as we left. Our waiter, Sean, was courteous and attentive. My Cobb salad was tasty and large. My wife enjoyed her Asian chicken salad & her tiny $10 margarita, and the children seemed to enjoy the pulled pork sandwich with fries and the kids menu chicken strips with fresh fruit. My water glass never went empty which is a major factor for me. Haven't tried the take home cheese cake yet, but in the past it has always been yummy. We had a huge booth away from the bar and TV which was nice because I found myself enjoying my family instead of the basketball game on TV. We'll be back."
Eric R.,"Las Vegas, NV",219,49,71,4.0,8/16/2013,"This is one of our fav spots!  So much goodness on the menu, our mouth orgazms come from: brown wheat bread, tex mex rolls, and chargrilled coulotte steak.  Perfect size to split between 2 peeps!  Ambiance is always nice and elegant, and service is consistent.  I would offer 2 improvements: 1) don't like my silverware set on the table. 2) ability to make reservation."
Melanie D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,1.0,12/1/2015,Horrible experience for the second time...guess I've learned my lesson....our food was ice cold and when we asked our server to warm it up she combined the food (from a split dish) onto the same damn plate!! After bites were taken! Good thing it was only my mom and her bite showed me which piece of chicken was hers...the food came back and the sides were still ice cold! Never had a drink refill...never saw a manager...server stood around and chatted it up with the busboys....we will not be returning...it's a shame too..it used to be a really nice place to go.
AJ G.,"Las Vegas, NV",944,68,34,5.0,5/4/2014,"Ive probably been here more than 30 times. Been coming here probably for 8 years. Best cheesecake factory in Las Vegas. I never have an issue with customer service, the waiters or the management here. food portions are HUGEEEE. It's definitely filling. Must try the cheesecakes. My favorite dish from cheesecake factory is ""Louisiana chicken pasta"" very authentic taste.  I love the Godiva chocolate cheesecake from here. Great place great atmosphere great customer service great food. Overall awesome."
Rose T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,1.0,1/14/2015,"I don't know why we keep returning, and why the place is always packed. I will say that my fish and chips were horrible. The fries tasted just like the ones at station casinos, over processed and nasty. The fish had no flavor as did the tartar sauce. The lettuce wraps were good, and we ordered a piece of original cheesecake to take home.  The worst part about cheesecake factory at Summerlin, is that the service is very hit or miss. These servers know that the they will always be busy, so they really don't try  hard to provide good service. I'm not asking for much. It took 15 minutes to get our bread basket and butter, but they didn't remember to give us silverware. A few minutes later, the waiter brings out silverware, after I already took it from an empty adjoining table. The waiter had the nerve to give me a long, dirty stare. You just don't do that as a server, you apologize, and move on. You never stare at your customer when they are hungry and have waited so long for bread, butter, and utensils. If we ever go back, it is just to order a piece of cheesecake from the to-go bakery."
Chris W.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,7,1,1.0,10/24/2015,"Having moved to the area, i was excited to go to cheesecake factory. This is my third attempt to eat at their Summerlin location, as the other two attempts have not gone well. There is no service standard what so ever. So last Saturday on October 17th, around 10:30 pm, my girlfriend and i went in. There was nothing going on; as Boca Park dies around 9:30pm all week. We sat in the bar, and were greeted by our server. My gf orders a coffee, i get an iced tea, iced tea came out fine coffee was ice cold. we let the server know. and a new pot was brewed 10 minutes later my girlfriend gets her coffee. While waiting we were ofered bread, complimentary bread is nice, no knives to cut the bread or spread butter though. Well we finally ordered now we have been here for close to 30 minutes, my i get a quesadilla, she gets an omelet. On the first attempt its the wrong order. now the manager comes by, he wants to make sure we have a good experience then you Frankie our experience blew. So now he goes to the kitchen tells us he will make sure everything comes out perfect. The next omelet comes out and is completely raw, with a long black hair through it  So now we have been here for 45 minutes, the ambiance is terrible, the service is terrible the food quality is terrible and now lets hit management. So Frankie comes up to us and deeply apologizes and tells none of his cooks have long black hair, that's all well and good but my girlfrined is blonde. So he then tells us that our bill would be comped and offered us cmplimentary cheese cake. we respectfully declined as we just wanted to leave. I put $15.00 on the table for the server to call it what it is. We walked out and the manager came running out frantically screaming at us as if we skipped out on the bill. NO, FRANKIE, YOU SAID THE BILL WAS COMPED! So we come back into see what this clown was going to charge us with, we then are given a bill from a server who was not even ours telling us this is our bill..   Like i said I have tried this place 3x since I have moved to Vegas and they are horribly ran. Their don't give a shit attitude its Summerlin is horrendous. Frankie has zero customer service! Insteqad of retaining customers, you lost one. Cold Coffee. No knives. Wrong Order. Chased in to the Parking lot but hey we were offered free cheesecake ..lol"
Alisha R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,47,3,3.0,6/18/2014,"Of course this place is known for the delicious cheesecake but tonight's service left something to be desired. We waited 10min to even be greeted by a server. Another 5 to get waters. Our server  just didn't seem to attentive. Not very personable. Our food was ok at best. I only go here for the cheesecake and I think from now in, I'll stick to just that."
David M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,121,201,5.0,10/20/2014,"Great food, friendly staff, and great service. Great place to get together with friends and family. They also have the best cheesecake in town !!"
Chris L.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,19,11,3.0,1/6/2016,"Asked for refills on my hot chocolate but I was not informed that I would be charged for again, no refills on the hot chocolate, didn't see it until my bill came. Old fashion burger was good but the fries seem to have been sitting out for a while."
Kyle R.,"Salem, OR",33,1020,240,5.0,8/12/2014,"5 stars for a national chain?  sure, why not.  our experience was awesome.  arrived at 1130am on a Saturday.  drinks brought immediately.  food arrived fast and hot and delicious!  our server (Mikayla D) was AMAZING.  attentive and friendly.  we ordered two apps, chicken quesadilla and avocado/mushroom/zucchini fried sticks.  the quesadilla was way overpriced at 12 bucks, not good bang for your buck.  but the other app was huge and way worth the $6.  main course, i got a ""skinny"" vegetable salad (yum) and hubby got the shepherd's pie.(huge and he said yum).  located just across street from Suncoast.  first time here, and have stayed at Suncoast 50 times in last 10 years.  we will be back!  we were just sad we were too full for dessert!"
Aimee P.,"Portland, OR",120,292,33,4.0,11/13/2012,I always get the miso salmon. Its truely heavenly. The chicken madeira is great too.  And you can't go wrong with dessert.
Amber T.,"Tampa, FL",3,4,,2.0,6/29/2015,"The food was good, however the service was not. We waited 15 minutes before our waitress even took our order, and it went downhill from there. After my mom received her lunch and had time to ask for dressing TWICE, the waitress realized that I had not received mine yet. She came back and admitted that she had ""totally spaced"" putting my order in and it would be right out. So then the manager visited our table and gave us the obligatory ""sorry"" but didn't offer any adjustments to our bill...not even a free dessert or drink. After finishing my lunch, I asked for a couple boxes so I could take the leftovers home and was shocked at what happened next. Our waitress actually walked up with 2 boxes, handed me one and said ""oh gosh, I was supposed to bring you 2...but this one is for someone else so I will be right back."" Needless to say, I was utterly shocked. We left full of good food but the bad taste in both of our mouths is impossible to overlook. Sorry Cheesecake Factory...We won't be coming back to this location again."
Lori W.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,27,,4.0,8/26/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory has a very large menu and the food is always very good. The serving portions are generous. The servers are friendly and pleasant. We frequent this location often and it's always busy. We like eating here but.................. The cons:1)  On my last visit over the weekend, it was the first time I used the restroom. If I had to rate the restroom facility using 'stars', it would get a 2. I was dumbfounded. For the size of  the restaurant, the restroom was small. Very dark, very dirty and wet (floors and counter). There were two other patrons in there and we all commented on how bad it was. Everyone was really surprised about it. 2) Parking isn't great either."
Cat W.,"Las Vegas, NV",32,41,25,5.0,3/29/2014,"Great staff. Consistent Cheesecake Factory food. It's our ""go to"" spot when we are unsure what to eat. Something for everybody!"
Bob M.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,40,13,4.0,4/14/2014,Always good food.  Great food wish we made it to this part of town more.  Have had problems with service in the past but they seem to be much better.  Will be back for more....cheesecake.
M-Jeanne De M.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,136,145,1.0,12/30/2013,"WARNING: CHEESECAKE FACTORY DOES NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS, SO PREPARE TO WAIT AT THEIR MERCY. On a late December 2013 night at Boca Park Cheesecake Factory, we were welcomed by shrieking toddlers (the kind of piercing, high-decibel sound that raises blood-pressure among the most minimally sentient humans) and boys big enough to know better who were treating the waiting area like a playground and endangering anyone who enters the place. There ought to have been some professional supervision to protect the other customers from those rowdy rascals. Our dinner companions chose to wait the forty minutes for a table--but outside, so that we could avoid the wanton pandemonium inside the restaurant. We had one good experience at this location a few months ago, thus figured that it was worth the wait. IT WAS NOT. Our waiter was pleasant enough, but we had to constantly ask him for water-refills and he did not offer freshly-ground pepper to me for the infinitesimally small sirloin steak ""culotte"", though he did so for my sister's Caesar salad. Spotty at best was the waiter's service, and after we finished our entrees, the fellow waited a full hour before presenting us with the dessert menu. The bread basket held something white, and I inquired whether or not it was sourdough, with which I have been familiar  all my life. The waiter said ""yes"". Upon tasting it, one could not detect a single sour note, and this eatery-chain is based in California, where sourdough bread is ubiquitous! I was disgusted by the formerly frozen, inadequately cooked ""French fries"" that came with my pee-wee steak, and its two substandard onion rings. There was a paper cup on the plate that contained ketchup, of all things. Had the waiter returned, I would have asked for a suitable condiment (give the dish a French name, and you had better include Dijon mustard, not the risible, flavor-masking ketchup). The fries were ""immangeable"", to use a derogatory French word that means ""inedible"". And at around twenty-five bucks, a microscopic, pathetically thin steak is an insult to anyone with a sense of proportion. There was one high note on the table: an appetizer called Buffalo Blasters. Without them, I may have gone hungry--oh, the irony in a place with one of the longest menus in creation. My husband had the usually fail-safe dish, fettuccine Alfredo. He perceived that the noodles were old or reheated. I noticed that the ""sauce"" was too thin to adhere to the pasta, and that the dish had been inappropriately infused with raw garlic, a vile act which constitutes sabotage. We detest the stinking tuber, and would never order such a thing knowingly.  It's a crime to call a dish ""Fettuccine Alfredo"", which NEVER had garlic in it, and turn the unsuspecting customer into this week's Garlic Clown, who has people running helter-skelter from his reeking person. An honest name for the concoction would be, ""Noodles in Raw Garlic Soup with a Hint of Cheese"". You cannot bastardize a recipe this way! Poor Chef Alfredo of Rome--his recipe has become a clown show in a bowl. A slice of chocolate mousse layer-cake was dry, heavy and seemed days-old. My cappuccino was lukewarm upon arrival. The only positive thing about the evening at Cheesecake Factory of Boca Park was the company at our table. I submit mostly five-star reviews here at Yelp; because I don't like to shoot at ambulances, I refrain from offering negative reports. However, when a huge chain restaurant serves factory-food at boutique prices, I am duty-bound to say so. And when one looks longingly at a Jack in the Box sign on the drive home after dinner, something is very wrong."
Riley J.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,93,17,3.0,12/5/2012,"Usually I'm a fan.  BUT... I was there over the weekend and everything was kind of wrong for me: the salad I ordered was bitter, I asked for extra beets and they gave me none, and my friend's salad was really just OK too. I've visited The Cheesecake Factory dozens of times before, but this specific experience was just really just not that great."
Lori B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,9,,4.0,5/9/2012,"My daughter, son-in-law and I met a family member here today that we had not seen in over 30 years.  So obviously we were doing a lot of talking.  The waiter was very patience with us.  Took us forever to order because we were so excited by the reunion.  He did not let us feel like we were being a pain in the ass (which I am sure we were.)   The Vietnamese spring rolls were very good.  The sauces it came with were awesome.  Our party had flatbread which was great.  Our relative had ahi tar tare which was fresh and flavorful.  The waiter was very tolerant of the fact that we sat and talked long after our meal was over.  Granted we came in at 1 P.M. and they weren't that busy but if I was a waiter I would have been thinking ""jeez people, are you moving in?""  I thought we would never get the bill and then discovered my son-in-law had paid during his trip to the rest room.  He's a good boy!"
Jaime B.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,11,,1.0,11/20/2015,"I have never experienced the terrible, disgusting service I got from this location.  I ordered the thai lettuce wraps to go, and when I got home, found a bug squished between the lettuce.  When I called to complain and ask for a refund, I was told they had to stay in business, so they wouldn't be offering a refund, and that the manager didn't understand why I was upset, because I didn't actually eat the fly.  I would stay far far away from the Cheesecake Factory in Summerlin, especially if you care about having clean food to eat."
