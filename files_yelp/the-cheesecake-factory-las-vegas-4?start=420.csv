Kaleb S.,"Sunrise Manor, NV",172,59,8,5.0,6/27/2014,"I went to a lunch here with my sister and her family. It was pretty busy, but luckily they got there first to wait for the table. The waitress was super nice. I ordered some sort of pesto pasta that had chicken and prosciutto in it. Everything was delicious. I would've normally given this place 4 stars because I have to be really impressed to get a 5, but when that cheesecake hit my tongue that bumped it up the extra star. Glad that they live up to the hype of their cheesecake."
Kelly G.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,9,,3.0,9/26/2015,"We usually love the Cheesecake Factory, but lately not so much. We order two Cobb salads to go with ranch dressing on the side.  There must be a shortage on blue cheese because neither salad had any.  Blue cheese is the main thing I love about the salad and thought we had found the perfect place when the Cobb salad craving hits, like I said not so much. Next time tell me that you ran out of the ingredient so that I can change my order. If you had told me I wouldn't be so disappointed in you Cheesecake Factory."
Yaniv S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,5.0,11/6/2014,"This particular Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants in town!  My family and I have been dining here since 2005! We've celebrated birthdays and anniversaries and it's always at the top of our list whenever we plan on celebrating a special occasion. The service is always phenomenal. The wonderful, helpful and friendly staff are genuine and are always there to greet you and make sure your experience is memorable. It's a fact that The Cheesecake Factory invests an average of $3,000 per employee on training - and it most definitely shows!  In addition, the food is always fresh and fast and the hearty-sized portions will leave you satisfied with some leftovers to take to work the following day! Over time we've  tried dozens of the items on their menu and we've never been disappointed. We look forward to the warm bread and butter that they serve you as soon as you're seated (TIP: Ask for a side of shredded Parmesan cheese with the bread and dip the buttered slices into the cheese! WOW!). It is very uncommon, but there were instances where mistakes in the order did occur, such as forgetting to remove the chicken when asked, or having a dish served cold. But when brought to their attention, they will always be extra sincere and apologetic and will always reimburse you to your satisfaction, so I won't take points off for that! When all is said and done, I have yet to find a restaurant with the quality of food and service that this particular Cheesecake Factory has to offer!"
Iliana P.,"Las Vegas, NV",45,15,15,4.0,3/9/2014,"Love the carrot cake cheesecake and white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, they're phenomenal! I also love where this place is located.., i almost gave it five stars but every time is go, the service is a little slow and the waiters are respectful but not exactly ""friendly"" (hope that made sense) .. Other than that, I always get exactly what I order and the food is great!"
Virginia C.,"Northwest, Las Vegas, NV",29,11,6,1.0,1/1/2014,Horrible service. Waiting for over an hour for our food. We asked for the manager and never came to our table. Never will I eat here again. Food is good but having to wait for an hour with a hungry child is ridiculous. This was supposed to be a celebration for my sons 20th Birthday.
Daniel P.,"Las Vegas, NV",149,174,224,4.0,11/16/2012,"Always good service and tasty food. We enjoyed only desert on our last visit and the cheesecakes were to die for. Always prepared fresh and with new flavors to try, this restaurant never ceases to impress me at every visit."
Maria R.,"Las Vegas, NV",224,24,11,4.0,12/5/2013,We were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday. The appetizers are big enough to be a meal. Lighting is low so make sure you have a flash light app. Service was good and te server made her cheescake look fabulous and festive.
Monica D.,"Las Vegas, NV",607,440,67,3.0,8/14/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is a solid choice, and you pretty much know what you're getting when you go.  Mom and I visited on a Monday evening- no wait, seated right away.  Service wasn't particularly friendly, and I did have a wait for a refill, but it was adequate.  As always, there is a huge menu with lots of choices and large portions.  My meal (Bistro Shrimp Pasta) was a bit underseasoned, almost bland, but did the trick.  As always, the cheesecakes are the stars, and the Red Velvet Cheesecake was delicious."
Sergey S.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,4,1,5.0,10/15/2014,"Very nice place, great foot. The waiters are cheerful and knowledgeable about the menu. Awesome service"
Joe N.,"Henderson, NV",25,40,,4.0,12/5/2013,"Tonight I took my girlfriend out to dinner to the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park. We arrived early and there was no wait. We were quickly seated in a dim lit booth. After searching over the 16 page menu we finally ordered edamame and calamari for appetizers to pick at before our entree arrived. They came out fairly quickly and were great. I ordered the orange chicken and was quite satisfied. My girlfriend ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Both of the meals were largely portioned.  We were too stuffed to order dessert. But I have had their pumpkin pecan cheesecake and it's delicious. Overall, I would return there again and recommend it to anyone seeking a good meal."
Arnold S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,49,,2.0,7/24/2015,"I visited this Cheesecake Factory on vacation from L.A., and was looking forward to it as I always do.  Unfortunately the service was not good at all this time around.  Our waitress most of the time was nowhere to be found and had a non caring attitude.  And without being long winded...she wasn't the only one there.  I really lime the location and hope that the next time I'm there on vacation that the service will be much better."
Tannaz M.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",0,3,,1.0,8/25/2015,"I would like to start off by saying that I have paid multiple visits to cheesecake factory before. The food is diverse and made right most of the time but my visit tonight will be my last. Being a server myself, I understand that it can be complicated in the kitchen but a bad attitude from a server (whose name I don't know since she never bothered to introduce herself), is not acceptable. We started off with the portabella mushroom avocado and zucchini fries which is a staple for us and it was served different than other times but we've become accustomed to getting this dish looking different each time. We also ordered the tostada salad to share. Three iced tea refills later (one of which was the wrong kind of tea), and I had to ask the waitress where our salad was and she informed us that they burnt the tostada and were making a new one. Fifteen minutes later we get the salad which looked more like a bowl of lettuce with nothing else mixed in it. It was clearly missing some of the ingredients. The manager came around and offered to replace the salad with a new one made correctly. After three tries, we were served a simple salad that should've been on the table an hour before. I did my best to be understanding towards the server until she dropped the check off with three salads on there and she had only taken off one of them from the total. Basically they expected me to pay for THEIR mistake. At that point, I had given up on the server and once again asked to see a manager and all he did was take one more salad off and have me pay for the bill as if it was served right at a reasonable time. He never bothered to apologize or try and make up for the inconvenience. Over all it was not a good experience. People do not come to a restaurant to wait around and be treated this way. Restaurants are equally valued for their customer service as they are for their food in my eyes and cheesecake factory failed at both this time. Considering the way management acts around here, I do not think there will be a change made in this restaurant's ways. I won't be back."
Joni W.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,130,119,3.0,10/25/2013,"Am a devoted fan of the miso salmon--the buttery miso sauce and the salmon grilled to perfection pleases me every time I order it.  My sister had the herb encrusted salmon with the rosemary potatoes, which she really enjoyed (although I wasn't excited about the flavor or presentation).  My bro-in-law had the house salad and the wasabi seared ahi.  He's from Hawaii, too, and enjoyed the fresh ahi after scraping off the wasabi-flavored crust.  I tried it and found it very much lacking in seasoning, it was way too thick of a dry crust, and there was no sauce so we had to doctor it up with some soy sauce.  Service is very attentive, as usual, and we had a great table with a nice view--thank goodness, or I might have lowered the amount of stars.  Kind of disappointing visit this time around and I wanted so badly to have my family rave over this place.  The mango key lime cheesecake we ordered was supposed to be the redeeming dish, but it was way too sweet and the coconut added to the impacted hard crust didn't help, and it seemed like all the flavors didn't combine well enough to make this worthwhile ordering.  I guess it's all about ordering the right, signature dishes, which we failed to do in 3 out of the 4  tries we had."
Domenic M.,"Las Vegas, NV",86,50,6,2.0,6/19/2014,"First, I'll start by saying that I love Cheesecake Factory and come here regularly and will continue to do so, however this rating is based off my experience tonight. The waiter spoke to us three times throughout the night. Once to get drinks, next to take our order 20 minutes later, and once to tell us how she was shocked at how fast we ate our food and that we ""broke records"" which was mostly insulting.Then the manager came to bring our food and she, surprisingly had absolutely no customer service skills whatsoever. The only person doing an exceptional job tonight were the chefs and considering the restaurant was completely dead all night, I don't see any reason for that."
P F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,46,,3.0,11/24/2012,"This is the typical 3 stars - The basic. OK service, OK food, OK dessert,,,,, Everything is OK. Nothing special but nothing bad.  If I rate this place 4 or 5, then there are tons of places deserve 5,,, even 6 and 7stars. So, 3 is what they should be rated. I have been here a lot of times - when I am really hungry but can't decide what I wanna eat..."
Tesh R.,"Ontario, CA",80,133,75,1.0,2/13/2015,"As always, the food is great. However, the service is deteriorating. For the Boca Park location, it's not a good look and definitely not expected. The rude bartender (a somewhat aged blonde female who wears her hair pulled back in a ponytail) was absolutely a HORRIBLE reflection of this particular location. She never ONCE asked us if everything was okay, if our food was how we ordered, if we needed anything, etc. she served the people around us, avoiding us. I had to slam the plastic ketchup container on the counter to get her attention. She stood in front of us numerous times making drinks and never once said i word. Seriously, if you don't like the job, find another one! She was the same exact way the previous time we went there and unfortunately had her. There were two guys at the end of the bar who were loudly complaining about something as well. I voiced my complaint to the manager, but somehow I wasn't convinced this issue will be addressed. A lot of these servers have the mentality of who they ""think"" will and will not tip. Well I have news for the ones who think that way: YOU'RE the one messing up YOUR money, not the client. I definitely laugh at the ones who THINK they deserve a tip no matter how they performed. Well I definitely have a tip for them: don't walk in dark alleyways at night.  If you can, steer clear of this particular bartender. She's not a professional at all and if these are the type of people that CCF will employ, you're better off eating at Red Robin."
C M.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",5,15,,1.0,9/21/2015,"Tried to have lunch on 9/20/2015. Promptly greeted and seated. Server was quick and courteous BUT SLOW. I ordered a Turkey burger and WAITED and WAITED and WAITED. Finally 25 minutes later someone from the kitchen comes to my table to say they were out of skinny buns for my burger and would it be ok to substitute wheat bread. Okay, just bring my food. WAITED and WAITED. Finally a manager (claiming to be very proactive) comes to the table to say they were extremely sorry for the delay but my food would be out soon. The kitchen gave my order to someone else. When the food finally arrived it was a cold piece of BEEF, not turkey as ordered served on a burned piece of wheat toast with grilled onions at the bottom. I ordered a Turkey Burger with avocado, NOT WHAT I GOT!!! Side salad was DRY DRY DRY. The manager apologized and comped my meal but the indigestion I am suffering with is ""PRICELESS"""
Anik G.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,30,123,2.0,6/6/2014,Stop by to this place last night around 9:15 pm to grab a couple slicies of pie from the bakery and was cashed out by Korena that took awhile to notice that i was there to order a pie. All the employee are very distracted and talking among them w/o looking around to see if there is customers out there waiting to order. Korena wasn't a pleasant person just kind smart ass girl. I ordered Linda's fudge cake which i love but very disappointed with the size of the cake this time. Vey tasty but too small. I thought all the cakes were cut up before placed in the display! I guess not cuz this lady cut iup n boxed it up for me. I love cheese cake factory n the food but the bakery area needs to work on better their customer service. I usually go to Green Valley location which has great people working for the bakery that make u feel very welcome n feeling like coming back often.
James S.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,253,3,4.0,4/28/2014,"Excellent desserts, gr8 food and not bad service.  Love the chicken Romano, jambalaya, lettuce raps, stuffed mushrooms and menu variety.  Red velvet and strawberry cheesecakes are the bomb.  Service left a little to be desired as seating was cramped and waiter showed irritation w/requests.  Good Sunday brunch and nice bar menu."
Krystle T.,"Mangilao, Guam",84,49,24,1.0,3/20/2012,"The food was pretty good... for a chain.  It was exactly what we expect from the Cheesecake Factory.... consistent with all the other Cheesecake Factories I had been to. Don't get me wrong... my family and I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It's a guilty pleasure....  The things that irked me about this particular location: 1.  Parking: what a pain! luckily they had valet (which we used...awesome!) however we had a large party and one family had a baby and i KNOW they parked uber far and had to carry the infant seat and everything.... 2.  Service: what a nightmare.  I don't even know our server's name.  All I remember is she was blond, and short (not in stature, but attitude-wise).  Granted we had a large party (13 people) ... uh oh... here's where i go off on a rant. So we had a large party.  It was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday. We had 3 children with us 10 adults... we all arrived within 10 minutes.  We had asked the server to wait until we were all here to start taking orders.... but she didn't feel that was a good idea.  I personally felt that we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and she felt she did not have to give us good service because she was already getting auto-gratted.  Boo on her.  Tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab that night) to automatically tip AT LEAST 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?) anywho, drinks came out staggered. menus came out staggered.  food came out staggered.... all because the server did not want to wait the few minutes for all of us to be seated and get situated.  rawr. and on top of that, some rude lady in a near by booth kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way. lucky for her my parents taught me to respect my ugly... i mean elders. That all being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)... bottom line:  food was consistent with every other cheesecake factory out there (yay for avocado eggrolls and THE BEST fried mac and cheese in the world) but the service was shoddy (really though, WHY would you bring out dessert for everyone else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls wait 10 more minutes for theirs? who does that?!?)  I'll stick to the location in Henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the Cheesecake Factory in Caesar's."
