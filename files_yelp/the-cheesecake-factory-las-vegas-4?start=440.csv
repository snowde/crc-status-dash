Katie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,63,20,1.0,6/2/2015,"This place is HORRIBLE on every level. My husband and I got takeout from this specific location one time. I had stuffed mushrooms with a turkey burger, and he had some sort of salad with a turkey burger. As he was eating his salad, he noticed a bug on the lettuce he almost put in his mind. Mind you the lettuce was halfway in his mouth, luckily the bug fell off before he consumed the whole thing. He literally spit his food out, and I did the same. He took all our food back - and the manager tells my husband ""well there was a bug in your food because it's humid outside"". For crying out loud there is NO excuse for live bugs to be in anyone's food!!!  He offered a cheesecake which of course my husbanded declined. Several years later we tried takeout again from this location. Don't ask why, because honestly I have no idea why. We should've learned our lesson the first time right?  Well my poor husband again had another horrible situation. As he bit into his turkey burger it was completely raw!!!!!  That was the last time we've ever been to Cheesecake Factory. And mind you the kids pasta was awful. Felt like they took the noodles out of the box and threw some butter on top and didn't bother cooking the noodles. Do yourself a favor and just eat at home, or at least stay away from this Cheesecake Factory."
Leigh B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,13,8,4.0,12/7/2012,"Love this place!  Portions are a little much, so me and my husband both tried items and drinks off the SkinnyLicious menu. Enchiladas were awesome! perfect portion size! Cobb salad was good, nothing extraordinary. Skinny Long Islands were very tasty! Service was really nice, she walked us through the menu and warned us that the portion sizes were smaller."
Marcia C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Ordered 3 chinese chicken salads to eat in and one to go. Simple right...not for them!!! All came without wontons, one had NO chicken, salads mainly lettuce. They forgot to bring the dressing. Had to keep asking for the dressing, the chicken, bread...We asked one person and another would bring the item. Five different people came to our table, none knowing what the other one had been told by us. Very frustrating. The mandarin oranges were well hidden since there were only two in a salad. The to go salad had no wontons, no rice noodles, and only one small dressing when I asked for two. There was no bread- had to ask twice for it. It seems that a restaurant that has been around for some time should know about customer service and how to make one of their most popular salads. No manager ever came to apologize in spite of my telling one of the five people who came to our table during their game of ""telephone"" that they need to stop sending different people who don't know what we told the previous one. Have had similar experiences with to go orders- never seem to get it right and don't seem to care. Very disappointed."
Jayson C.,"Las Vegas, NV",95,36,10,5.0,4/20/2014,Other than the fact they don't take reservations the good is always amazing!  Cheese cake is really the only reason anyone comes here anyways right;)
Ollan A.,"Las Vegas, NV",275,63,252,3.0,7/30/2013,"+ 1/2 star for the good service. Not quite 4 stars. Food quality seems to be consistent no matter which Cheesecake Factory I go to. I've been to this particular location about 3 times already. I tend to always order the same things - Seared Tuna Tataki Salad, Mojito, and Low Carb Cheesecake. It's just right and I don't feel like crap afterwards. This time around, I order the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. It was ok, but I wish there was more shrimp and chicken - it seemed to be dominated by the tomatoes and pasta. The wife had her usual - the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Dessert was a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Veruka said she was going to share it with me, however, she is one of the few women in the world that doesn't like chocolate. She had one bite and quit. I ended up eating the whole thing myself. Well, It looks like I'm gonna have to do a juice fast this week - this meal will put at least 5 pounds on me! Service this time around was good - the server was attentive and brought us everything in a timely manner. 3 times a year at the Cheesecake Factory is more than enough for me."
M D.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,164,560,5.0,4/22/2014,Huge menu with lots of options.  Chinese chicken salad is very big but it's phenomenal.  The patio makes for great outdoor dining.  Consistent food and always great service here.
Janel S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",370,309,435,5.0,2/9/2014,You just can never go wrong with their chicken picatta and their red velvet cheesecake. It's all I go there for. Their lunch selection is also a good selection as well.
Angie M.,"Farmers Branch, TX",550,210,350,5.0,8/27/2013,I love love love the vanilla bean cheesecake !! I usually but the small 7 inch I believe for $28 and enjoy it with my friends and family !!
Aidan O.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",219,15,5,3.0,1/23/2015,"I love Cheesecake factory but the service here left a bad taste in my mouth. My dad gave me Cheesecake factory gift cards so I went with my mom and my two brothers for dinner. I walked to reserve a table because the parking can get a bit crazy around dinner time.I walked to the Hostess and told her that I would like to reserve a table for four, She then had asked me my name and she must have had a hard time hearing me because after I said it she said ""What was your name?!"" Spot on shitty attitude for a hostess. I then asked her if she could check how much money was on the cards my dad gave me for Christmas and she said ""well I can't check that over here but if you wanna go over there they can check for you"" with an even shittier attitude. I then went over to the counter where they could check the credit of my gift cards and the man who checked them was cool unlike his boogie ass co worker of a host. I didn't have to wait that long to be seated which was nice. Our waiter on the other hand was acting like there was a bomb tied to her waist that would explode if she didn't do her job. I could tell in her voice that she didn't wanna be there which made it awkward for me and my family. On the other hand the food was really good. I'm gonna come back again just with high hopes I don't come across that same waitress or that hostess, except for that other guy he was cool as fuck."
Dale P.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",97,36,46,4.0,3/2/2014,"I really love this place, I have always enjoyed coming here with friends. There's always great food and the customer service isn't bad. The drinks are pretty good as well.   Isn't loud, so nice to have conversations and catch up. The service is average, after all it's not some fancy shmancy restaurant but the food and drinks are yummy so it always makes me come back, and we can't forget about the cheesecake!!"
Steve W.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",443,250,13,2.0,9/22/2011,"I'd rather go to an actual Cheesecake Factory, and I don't even like Cheesecake. Cheesecake factory is like getting the same gift for your birthday every year, and you didn't want it the first time around.  You know what to expect, it won't make you happy, yet here you are again. While always living up to my below average expectations, this place has one thing going for it, the decor.  It looks bright and nice and welcoming.  The food is average at best, and way overpriced for what it is.  Chilis or Fridays can match anything this place has, and at a few bucks cheaper.   Come because you're hungry, leave your leftovers....."
Jonathan S.,"Sharon, MA",164,381,,4.0,10/17/2011,"Ah, the Cheesecake Factory. Every time I come here I stick to a rotation of dishes including the jambalaya, the buffalo blasts, and occasionally the salmon and I'm never disappointed. Throw in their delectable selection of cheesecakes and I'm always in heaven. Not to mention the gigantic portions. Recently CF has added a ""small bites"" menu which is the perfect size if you want to sample a bunch of random tasty treats. I don't think I'd ever purposely come here if given the choice but once in a while it truly hits the spot! Did I mention the cheesecake? Good, can't forget it."
Scott H.,"Apex, NC",0,33,6,1.0,11/17/2014,"Just left this location and I feel the need to Yelp it right away. We were a party of 4, sat right away at 5:15pm and ordered at 5:20pm. So far so good, right? My food comes out (burger undercooked with onions on it and I said NO onions). I flag down the server, she takes it away. 15 min later, still no burger so I ask where is my food? Server tells me the kitchen ran out of burger patties and they are making more. Huh? Ok, whatever. 25 min goes by and I ask for a manager. Still no food. Manager (Robert) strolls over and says I will take burger iff the bill. And asks if there is anything else he can do? I said, well, I have been here for almost 1 hour and havent eaten anything. He offers me a piece of cheesecake and says ""I will go get it right away"". 10 min later, no manager, no cheesecake. We get up to leave, and the server asks if we got the cake? I said NO and the manager must have forgot. She turns and literally runs to the takeout area and gets my cake and comes back and 60 seconds. I ask for the GM of this location and she says the GM will be there on Wed. So, on Wed I will call this GM (Amy) and tell her to read this Yelp review. Its unfortunate that restaurants like Cheesecake Factory allow this to happen. I have always held them to a higher standard, but looks like they have some work to do. The manager, Robert was so nonchalant and obviously didnt care much about ""being right back"" with my cheesecake. Unteal. My grade: F"
Kaori T.,"Burbank, CA",1494,793,1274,4.0,1/23/2012,"I hate to admit it, but you really can't go wrong with Cheesecake factory. They have such an extensive menu, there is always something for you. Probably one of the most reliable chains out there. No matter what city you're in, you can always count on Cheesecake factory to negotiate with you."
Sophia E.,"Henderson, NV",11,6,2,5.0,5/14/2014,A big fan of the cheescake factory. Love that this particular location wasn't crowded and there was no wait. I ordered the cobb salad which was unlike the typical cobb salad. It was big enough to feed about 4 people! Also ordered the slice of red velvet cheese cake which was excellent and was sized perfect for 2 people to share. Will definitely be coming back to this location!
Carissa P.,"Lebanon, NH",0,3,,5.0,5/2/2014,"Delicious food, menu is a touch overwhelming but our server was incredibly patient with us. Services was impeccable! Thanks Deena!"
Cris H.,"Henderson, NV",7,26,,3.0,7/30/2011,"I really wish I could have rated this place higher. If I was rating just the food, I would have given it 4 stars.  But, that's not how it works! I went with my friend after our horrible experience at Aquae Sulis spa.  We  both had mint green teas and the lunch-sized cobb salad. The mint tea was fantastic.  The salads were huge for a lunch size, and the ingredients were fresh and cold. I like that there was no fat at all on the chicken.  The dressing could have used a bit more flavor. To finish, friend had the carrot cake cheesecake, I had the red velvet cheesecake (which I love!!).  We both left very happy with our desserts!! Unfortunately, the service was pretty lackluster.  It took forever for her to stop by the table to take orders, refill drinks, pick up plates, bring the check, return the check, etc. Maybe she was just having an off day, but like I said, if it hadn't been for the slow service I would have rated 4 stars!"
Rhonda W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",87,207,22,4.0,8/19/2011,"Cheesecake Factory has one of the best happy hours ever..  You still get to experience their food, which is tasty.. and most of their appetizers and some drinks are about $5 each, which is a great price for me!"
Allison P.,"Las Vegas, NV",113,312,85,3.0,5/6/2013,"It's not that the food is bad (it's good) but it's overpriced. If I weren't worried at all about money I'd come here, though, because the atmosphere is fun and friendly, and it's great for two people or a group.  Obviously the cheesecakes are delish, as are their other desserts.  The menu is HUGE with a large variety to choose from."
Megan S.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,17,4,4.0,10/29/2011,"Cheesecake is in the name of the restaurant . You know this place is going to be good. Although I try and stray away from chain restaurants this once you truly can't miss. They literally have everything on their menu. This can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many amazing options it can be hard To decide. What I can tell you is this. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is amaze. It's Parmesan crusted chicken served over pasta with a spicy New Orleans sauce. The portion in my opinion Is pretty large. So you could share.  My absolute favorite however is The stuffed mushrooms. Mmmm. Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce. Some times when I eat It I want to tell the waiter I love him just for bringing me the stuffed mushrooms that I ordered...but at that point in our relationship we've only Known eachother for about 20 min so maybe thats to soon to take That step.  They also have amazing soups. I seriously doubt you can go wrong with one. Now for all of you calorie counters. There's is a menu to make You feel a little Less guilty. It is called the ""Skinnylicious"" Menu. It's basically menu full of food saying "" eat me I have not Cream or butter.""  Cheesecake has something for everybody. It's an excellent Place for a group. It is Pricier but manageable. My Tip: GET THE CHEESECAKE. It's called the Cheesecake Factory for crying out Loud. It is simply not  to say no to a slice. I suggest the red velvet if you really feel in the mood To have a relationship with a cake. It's literally to die for. Not an Exaggeration ."
