Frideric P.,"Las Vegas, NV",252,43,2,4.0,2/10/2014,Service and food was good. I really enjoyed the burrito and strawberry cheesecake. Highly recommend it!
Tracy M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,78,51,5.0,2/8/2014,Staffs are always pleasant. Food is good as usual. I would prefer this location than the one at Caesar's Palace.
Carisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",81,10,,3.0,3/6/2012,"I took my friend for a birthday lunch and it was all okay. I had a glass of wine and he had ""the Ritz"" martini which was actually quite delicious. Appetizers were okay but when it came to my Pear and Endive salad, I have to say it was less than mediocre. I maybe ate 1/3 of it because that's all the endive/fresh greens that were in it. The rest was iceberg and I don't find that appetizing. Especially when I expect endive in a pear and endive salad.  However, the white chocolate truffle cheesecake slice was fantastic."
Cher H.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,38,,4.0,12/23/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is yummy. They have the most amazing veggie burger that is actually handmade, and I love their french fries. Plus, of course, the cheesecake is fantastic. Try the cookie dough cheesecake! Oh, and the asian salad is enormous. fyi."
Jamie R.,"Sparks, NV",21,75,136,1.0,10/22/2013,"The hostess lost our seating ticket. Then sat us at a dirty table. Took 20 minutes to be greeted or get drinks. My husband found a bone in his chicken dish. When I asked for a manager she said, ""I wish you would have told me sooner that you had a bad experience."" FYI management, do not ever put any blame whatsoever on the guests."
Alma C.,"Las Vegas, NV",193,128,71,3.0,12/23/2010,"I've never had not so great food here. But, the food isn't the most amazing food I've ever had either. But, it's a great fall back place to go to when I don't know where else I want to eat. Or, it's a great place to meet friends. Prices are pretty decent, and service has always been good to me.  I'd have to say, that the calamari is by far my favorite thing o order. I just love the white sauce that comes with it. The breading on the calamari is always so nice and light, and always crispy.  Secondly, I would highly suggest the Chicken Madeira. Plus, it's such a huge portion, theres usually some left overs !!"
Meghan S.,"Santa Barbara, CA",40,67,,4.0,11/15/2011,"I am a fan of the Cheesecake Factory  and we don't have one where I live so it's always a treat to go to one when you are on vacation.  The menu is huge, the portions are big and the food is amazing.   It was my first visit to this location in Vegas and it was a great experience.  It's seemed less busy than the others in town and the staff was just pleasant and wonderful. I definitely recommend!  ...and try to save room for Cheesecake!  YUM!"
Chrissy P.,"Kintnersville, PA",31,60,,4.0,8/20/2011,"I went here the first night I moved to Las Vegas. It's located next to the Boca Park shopping center, which has a plethora of nice shops there. Our food was out extremely quickly. The quality is pretty on par with the rest of this franchise's restaurants- fast, chain food, a menu too large for any one item to be really excellent, but good enough. they have a large outdoor seating area complete with over the head mist so that you can stay cool during this warm winter months. overall, my experience was good. I do love eating here because it's a great place for the entire family, and the food is descent."
Wig H.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,96,72,4.0,1/10/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is not normally on the top of my list when choosing a place to dine in Vegas. I find the menu to be slightly overpriced, way too extensive, and have never had ""amazing"" service there. But, the family insisted on it for lunch today, and I'm glad they did. I had the Luau Salad, and the waiter recommended I get the full size, as opposed to the lunch size, if I was hungry. I did, and it was a nice size salad with mango, wontons, carrots, some other stuff & DELICIOUS chicken. Marty was a great server as well."
Jesse J.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,14,4,3.0,10/11/2013,You have to try the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It's unbelievable! The service is ok. The food is hit or miss.  Really only go back repeatedly for he cheesecake!
Aaron R.,"Orlando, FL",35,9,3,2.0,5/1/2011,"The food was pretty good but the service was horrible. Call it what you will, but everything went wrong, in terms of service.  First, we asked for a table inside for just the two of us. The lady said ok and the wait would be about 5-7 minutes. Well, a whole bunch of people came in after us and they all got seated before us. After a while, I went up and asked if we were still on the list. The lady said, ""Oh, yea....here's your table."" No apology or anything. We sat down and my girlfriend was a little mad.  The server seemed nice, but after receiving our food....someone messed that up too. She ordered white rice with the gumbo but got the regular brown rice. My girlfriend accepted the food anyway, but again....she was not happy.  Overall, it was a bad experience. We still like the Cheesecake Factory, but I would probably recommend another one in town. This one isn't up to par."
Sandie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,2,,5.0,3/29/2015,I love the Cheesecake Factory.  It had great food and attentive servers.
Cousin Al A.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,21,,5.0,1/30/2013,"My wife and I continually come here for any occasion.  Whether brunch, dinner, or just dessert, the Summerlin (Rampart) location always provides good service and food.  Keep in mind, we have visited their restaurants in Boston, MA, Waikiki, HI, and Santa Monica, CA and their customer service is excellent."
Stephanie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",112,12,13,1.0,12/28/2010,"I'm not sure if the entire staff at this location hates the company but they don't seem to be giving Cheesecake Factory a good name.  I've been to all 3 Las Vegas locations on more than one occasion but this experience has to be the worst by far.  I'm not one to complain but this was too many mistakes to go unnoticed.  The evening started seemingly ok.  The hostess took our name, said the wait would be 20 minutes and then handed us a beeper.  When 30 minutes past I went back up to ask where we were in the line.  She stated that she called us, which was impossible since we were sitting on the bench next to her stand.  Also, the beeper never went off so that onto itself was a lie.  Why give one to us a beeper if you aren't going to use it?   We sat down and our waitress seemed very nice (probably the only employee I didn't mind).  My boyfriend and I ordered our food but for some reason the food runner only brought out his food.  I sat and waited for a bit but then our waitress looked at my empty place setting and stormed off.  She came out immediately after with my food.  At the end of the meal, we ordered a slice of cheesecake to have at the restaurant but the food runner gave us our cheesecake in a ""to go"" box.  Our waitress again looked angry.   Lastly, today I opened my box of leftover pasta to find that my boyfriend's jalapeno peppers were mixed in with it.  He finished his meal and there wasn't anything left on his plate except the peppers. I found them everywhere in my food, they just weren't placed on top or on the side.  I decided not to eat it since someone messed with it enough to mix ingredients in.  Gross."
Diem L.,"Oakland, CA",144,159,28,3.0,7/4/2013,Was just reminded of a date that I went with CT here...Food is always decent & service is cool- I thought of this spot because it was a very nice date with great conversation & great company...Always a good time out with CT...Would definitely venture again...Good times...
Ed J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,10,,4.0,1/11/2012,"We have been here about 8 times. It is a really big restaurant so it is unlikely that you will have a quiet and intimate meal. However, the food is always better than average and it is a great place to bring groups of 4 or more people. Also, the variety is unsurpassed unless you venture to a casino restaurant.  We will continue to come here and it is definitely unique in the west to northwest part of town."
Ninja h.,"New York, NY",0,228,250,4.0,6/27/2013,"I had my birthday dinner here. It was my first time. I was not disappointed. I had the filet it was so good.  I could cut the steak with a butter knife. For desert, I had the ultimate cheese cake.  It was massive and delicious."
Christina W.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,1,5.0,10/30/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a fantastic restaurant. This eatery has everything that you could want. With their large menu and wide verity of items, it is sure to please all at the table. The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, steaks, breakfast items, fish and seafood, deserts and over 40 cheesecake options. They also have a menu for people who are watching their calorie intake or have gluten allergies. During the weekends they offer a Sunday Brunch option, a tradition in many families. Every online posted experience, the food always met or exceeded their expectations. The food is always hot and fresh with great flavors. Here is a quote from   about the Cheesecake factory: ""You want selection? There are two pages of just appetizers. TWO pages! Just check out all the mouthwatering selections online if you have a moment. I haven't even tried a tenth of their menu, and yet it remains one of my favorite places to eat. Go for the cheesecake, stay for the food, never a disappointment!"" This fabulous restaurant has incredible customer service. The staff will greet you right away. They will cater to your special occasions. As an example if you have a birthday or anniversary, they will surprise you with a free desert at the end of the meal. They will even gather the staff and sing happy birthday energetically to the birthday person. If it is an anniversary they will personalize the desert by writing happy anniversary. They will make alterations to the menu items to meet your needs and do it with a smile. Their great attitudes have made many post reviews online with many reputable sites. Some of them include   and Yelp. There are incredible reviews written on Yelp for all over the US, proving the consistency of great service. Depending on the mood you are in they have a dine-in and a take-out option. For the take-out option, they also provide curbside pickup. One of the Yelp the reviews said ""Our waiter and he was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best waiters I have ever had before. Not only was he very good at what he does (taking orders, getting drinks, making sure that everyone is taken care of at the table) he was also very personable. We talked to him a little bit in his down time, and he made us laugh a few times. Everyone at my table loved him, and said the same thing... that he is on of the best waiters we have ever had"" at a restaurant."" The atmosphere is a great combination of everything that a person could want. As mentioned earlier there is a dine-in and a take-out option but they also have many other options. Sitting out on the patio to enjoy the weather or stay inside the dining room to avoid the weather. Join the bar for a more social environment. The best time for the bar is during happy hour for that social mood. You could also, snug yourself away in booth for a more intimate setting. The vibe of the restaurant is very upbeat, friendly, fun, personable and beautiful. The walls have beautiful large European murals and pillars. The space is open but a cozy feel as well. It is a place where to dress up or dress down. Guests can bring kids or eat alone. No matter what mood, no matter who the guest is, Cheesecake Factory is a place that all will enjoy. On   there are some great articles for Cheesecake factory. One of the quotes said ""I was just blown away by the architecture. The outrageous curves of the art nouveau architecture really sets the mood"""
Osvaldo G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,22,,4.0,11/19/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory may be my favorite restaurant chain.  I've been to different locations here and in L.A., but I'm a regular at this location now.    The menu is very diverse, and regardless of location, the meals are always well-prepared.  I've tried many of their dishes, and have never been disappointed in one.  I like to go to The Cheesecake Factory when I want to celebrate, so I usually get a bottle of wine or Champagne or just a couple of martinis.  I try to find a reason to celebrate something at least once a month.   After dinner and drinks, I like to cap the celebration with coffee and -- of course -- cheesecake."
Lausanne O.,"Las Vegas, NV",16,17,4,4.0,9/2/2013,We usually get seated right away or within 15 minutes. The service is usually very good and we do have our favorite dishes to order: sunday brunch French toast Napolean and the sunrise fiesta burrito.
