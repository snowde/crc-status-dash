Valonne G.,"Midtown, Detroit, MI",0,13,2,4.0,1/2/2016,"Started off rough. The host stand didn't really know what it was doing (I think it was turnover which might've been why), so we waited a long time to be seated and they didn't seat anyone who came in for about 15 minutes. Normally, I wouldn't mind but my grandma has a hard time standing for a long time and since no one was being seated, none of the seats in the waiting area opened up. Regardless, our waitress Sandy really turned it around. It was my little sister's birthday, Sandy made it a point to remember our names, sing to my little sister with a dessert specifically for her (wrote her name on it), took amazing care of us even with our difficult orders and questions about the menu (my father is vegan), and never complained even though we were a very needy table. She truly wanted to serve us and it's extremely refreshing. I worked as a waitress/bartender for six years and I can honestly say Sandy is the best waitress I've ever had. If you go to this Cheesecake Factory, ask to sit in Sandy's section! Oh and the avocado rolls were DELICIOUS!!!"
James R.,"Inglewood, CA",258,16,383,4.0,7/22/2014,"The timing and the location was perfect.  My wife and I celebrated our 17th anniversary and wanted late dinner.  This location was close to our hotel.  The service was great as we were immediately seated on the patio (we arrived at 10PM on a Sunday evening...closing time was 11PM).  Our server, Jessica was took our drink order shortly after we sat down.  I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp and Chicken combo.  I wanted to try something new and I thought it was a great choice.  I loved the appearance of the plate and the food was outstanding.  I didn't like the mango salsa though.  My wife loves this dish and raves about the salsa.  For me, I the salsa didn't work but everything else did.  The bean and rice were good especially when I mixed it with the chicken and shrimp.  Overall, I give this place four stars...the staff were friendly and checked with us several times during our visit.  If I visit this area in Las Vegas again, I would consider visiting this establishment again.  Oh and the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake is to die for.  What a way to end an evening."
Douglas H.,"Hagerstown, MD",30,80,62,3.0,5/27/2013,"This was a typical visit to a big chain restaurant.  Food was good as usual.  We did have a trainee as our server and he was very nervous.  We had some fun with him and made him loosen up a little.  I'm sure he passed his test, but you need to keep it light.  This place was slamming busy on a Wednesday night with a short wait during the dinner rush hour.  We'll go back again when we're in town."
Oana S.,"Las Vegas, NV",209,81,10,4.0,2/2/2014,The chocolate mouse cheesecake is wonderful.  The red Sangria is amazing.  The food in general is good.  The inside atmosphere is kind of loud.  The patio seating is very nice.  Great neighborhood place.
P B.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,14,1,3.0,12/27/2012,Long wait time. Food just ok. Customer service is lacking. Cheesecake is delicious   Its worth the trip to the forum shops @ Caesar's where you get in & out in less time including travel time. IMO.
Maura O.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,30,4,4.0,6/18/2012,"Even though it's a chain, this was the first restaurant (not this one in particular) that my husband and I went to together, so I guess we have a sentimental attachment to it.  I love the luau salad, my husband always gets the bang bang chicken and shrimp.  I always get the strawberry shortcake at the end, it's a huge biscuit filled to the brim with fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and topped with whipped cream.  Even if you normally order cheesecake, try this dessert one day, it's so good!!"
Michael J.,"Lakeside, CA",30,195,2,4.0,8/23/2013,Our server Edgar was funny and great. New app Parmesan Garlic cheese bread was awesome.
Melissa D.,"San Jose, CA",24,69,130,4.0,4/3/2011,"Everytime I have come here, I have never had a problem.  I have only sat in the bar area because service is quick and I have never had to wait for a seat. So, can't really tell you much about the dining room seating other then there are always people waiting. Cheesecake Factory has almost anything you could be craving from seafood to steak to great pasta and it's usually ALL good. And, as always their cheesecake is always fresh and tasty.  For Boca Park it can get busy, but as mentioned, if you don't mind the bar, hit it up for quicker seating and service."
Dina K.,"Las Vegas, NV",30,8,5,3.0,10/12/2013,"Foods great here as usual, but .....tonight's empty and we been sitting for 15 WITHOUT ANY SERVICE...WTH service has become shitty....this has been happening here a lot lately"
Mark M.,"South Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",0,19,6,5.0,7/24/2013,"I'm a regular here but today I had the saltiest chicken Madeira.  Headache started to heat up.  Luckily their manager came and apologized.  Overall Great staff, great management.  I can forgive them for one mistake.  But usually the food  tastes great."
Bethany L.,"Las Vegas, NV",152,67,6,3.0,2/3/2011,"Alright, so I ever so slightly want to amend the rating that I had previously given..........now 3 stars.  I dined there last night and topped my meal off with the Reese's Peanut Butter Cheesecake, and WTF!!! (sigh) That was AMAZING and I thought that I hated cheesecake?!?!??!?! Apparently as long as that flavor exists, I'll be a fan!  ;)"
Patricia M.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,8,5,3.0,6/16/2013,"The food was pretty good. If this review was based only on food it would have received a higher rating, but it's not. The waitress took a long time to get to us. I understand it was a busy day for them, so we gave her extra time, but it took her way too long to get our drinks. I had to ask for my water 3 times before I got it. At the end of the night she charged us an 18% gratuity that was supposed to be discretionary. She didn't even ask us! She just charged me! The manager we spoke to was extremely nice and helpful. He said that she wasn't supposed to do that, and took the gratuity off of our check. If I go next time I hope our service during our dinner will be better."
Lindsey B.,"Las Vegas, NV",102,248,17,4.0,12/28/2010,"This is a review for the cheesecake only... It was my mom's birthday yesterday, so after leaving the strip, we decided that she needed some sort of ""cake"" on her birthday!  It was 10:30pm (they close at 11pm) and I pulled into Cheesecake Factory.  We were sat at a nice table and they gave us a full menu and offered to bring out bread.  We told them we were only having dessert. (but nice to know that they continue serving the full menu until close!) My mom picked the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake and I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake. I found the waiter and let him know that it was my mom's birthday.  They came out with ""Happy Birthday Lisa"" written on the plate in chocolate, a candle and sang ""Happy Birthday To You"".  It was very nicely done! The cheesecake was delicious (took some home for later!).  The service was great- he refilled our water and decaf coffee very promptly. I will definitely go here again just for dessert!"
J W.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,58,1,3.0,10/27/2014,"Food was ok, if you like oily chicken dishes. The seafood dish was good, the service was good too. The desserts were out of this world!!"
Lisa H.,"Vancouver, WA",45,114,12,3.0,12/26/2012,"I never been to the Cheesecake Factory so we decided go here. We had a fairly large group which included four kids all under the age of 5. The service was really nice and attentive. The overall atmosphere here is very loud which probably makes it good for large groups/noisy families. If you want more of an intimate atmosphere for maybe a ""date night"" then this is not for you. Food was tasty. Portion size very large even for lunch portions. Would come here again."
Bryan D.,"Las Vegas, NV",157,236,58,5.0,6/4/2010,"On special occasions, I like to treat my better half to the Cheesecake Factory! Our absolute favorite dish is the ""bang bang chicken and shrimp."" It consists of a mound of rice, surrounded by mild curry with chicken and shrimp sieging  the mound.  You could easily order one serving and share between the two of you, but it is so good that we order one each!  It makes for a good leftover lunch the next day. The service is absolutely amazing.  The last time we went, had a waiter named Marty and he took care of us and went out of his way to make sure that we were had a great time. I recommend getting the strawberry lemonade.  A bottomless glass of bursting flavor is what you will get.  Highly addictive and now that I am writing this review, I long for another. You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without taking advantage of its namesake!  Our choices for desert are: - The Banana Cream Cheesecake - White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake I highly recommend this place!"
Tiffany P.,"Las Vegas, NV",18,12,1,4.0,3/20/2013,"As always, I have never been disappointed at The Cheesecake Factory. I will go there every chance I get and even living in Las Vegas has not dampened my liking for that extensive menu. We only had appetizers and split an entree, and yet it was still a great experience as we sat on the terrace and enjoyed the beautiful weather."
Kenny S.,"North Las Vegas, NV",8,54,11,5.0,5/8/2013,Great food and great service.   The nutty chocolate marshmallow shake is to die for.
Randall P.,"Van Buren, AR",11,3,1,5.0,5/27/2014,"I am mad at myself for never eating here before. My first thought is that the food is a little pricy, but once my wife and I got our meals we both agree that it is actually cheap for the amount and quality that is served. I would definitely recommend the hibachi steak with a Guinness."
