Brittney S.,"Las Vegas, NV",29,31,1,4.0,4/18/2013,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years but a co-worker suggested it for lunch yesterday and I was glad he did. The parking situation here is terrible but once inside we slid up to the bar area and enjoyed a great lunch. The service was prompt and friendly even during their busy lunch rush and my water glass never ran empty; which is a big deal to me. We split the chopped salad from the ""skinny"" menu as well as a sausage flat bread and both were delicious. The chopped salad is huge and was more than enough for both of us and the sausage on the flat bread had great flavor. I will certainly be keeping this place in mind for further meals."
Amy C.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,20,,4.0,6/4/2012,"The food here is just okay, I never actually like sitting down and actually eating the meal, because they are really just okay.  BUT! The cheesecakes here are soooo good. I usually just come here for cheesecakes when I'm craving for it. Love the tiramisu cheesecake! I tried some of the other ones, the apple one good, but too sweet. The original cheesecake tasted pretty good too. I don't remember much of the other ones, but I know for sure that the tiramisu cheesecake is very good!"
Traci H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,115,2,3.0,2/11/2013,Pretty average food. I've had dinner here about 10 times and never had anything really great. Good dessert.
Bobby H.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,78,3,4.0,12/26/2012,Great service.  Good food. Monster portions and a menu that goes on forever. Just your typical Cheesecake Factory.
Diane S.,"Port Orchard, WA",101,94,403,2.0,2/5/2012,"Visit was on 1/11/12- I expect more from the Cheesecake Factory, especially for the price.  This use to be one of my fave places to eat but no more.  It was 10 minutes before we got water, another 10 before our order for apps was taken.  We ordered the crispy taquitos to start with.  Tasty but the guacamole was so skimpy-not enough for 2 people to have a decent dab.  The hubby ordered the Ribbed Eye (at CF? Really???). It was overcooked but service was so spotty that night that we were afraid to send it back.  it came with fries...The fries are different and not for the better.  I ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla.  It was still as good as I remembered.  CF still has the best Ranch dressing.  We ordered cheesecake to go.  My husband got the Coconut cream which he said was ""fine"".  I tried the Pineapple upside down cake.  It was just okay but that isn't a quality issue-just a matter of taste. Like most of the chains restaurants, it is easy to see that they have skimped here & there to make their profit.  I would rather they be honest-either keep the quality with smaller proportions or charge more.   Can't give them an A-ok because for the price it was a huge disappointment and it seems the last few times we have gone, our experience gets just a little bit worse..."
Tina W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",33,53,10,2.0,8/24/2013,"So I went last night with my hubby to the cheesecake factory and I was highly disappointed. I give only 2 stars and that's for the cheesecake, it was the only good thing.  To start with our server, Shannon D, I think she doesn't like her job. A server myself, we got not enough attention from her and she didn't stop by to ask how aour food was tasting. Cause I sure had a problem with our calamari that were not so good. I have no idea what the kitchen did, that half of them were sticking together in a big clump and they seamed not cleaned the right way, too. Our server was more concerned how much tips she made from the big party that was right across from us, then taking a little more care on the other guest. My dink was empty for a while and it was sure not that busy, cause the big party already left. By the way, if you iron your shirt and pants, you might look a little more professional, then looking crumbled up from head to toe. It's not really nice to look at, remember your in a service job! Right as we got the check, is when she asked how our food was, hello, that was a little to late. So we're not going to go back to this location. I would understand if this place was packed, but it was pretty empty."
Eran L.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,9,8,3.0,6/3/2012,1-5.    (1= very   bad 5= very good) Food: 2 Atmosphere: 3.5 Price: 3 Service: 4 In general I don't love this kind of restaurants I feels to me like a food factory with no attention on ech individual dish. I have to admit that the Avocado egg rolls are the best here (ruined my diet)
Faith F.,"San Diego, CA",27,121,73,5.0,10/20/2012,This review is for the pinacolada cheesecake only. I died and went to heaven. OMG.
Dawn C.,"Las Vegas, NV",65,331,6,5.0,8/4/2010,Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat out at..this is the 1st time I ate at this location. Came here the other night with some friends and we had the yummy tropical iced tea. Shared some avocado rolls.  I had shrimp angel hair pasta..it was perfect with fresh tomatoes and cheese on it. Yummy! Friends ate some kind of peanut thai noodles..that tasted alot like peanut butter rather than peanuts. Jessie B had this amazing salad.  Salads here are HUGE! The service was ok..he could have been better. But its my fav place so I give him a pass.
Nicole F.,"Las Vegas, NV",370,81,58,3.0,7/29/2010,"5 stars for their Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake! 3 stars for the Service from last visit. I only find myself coming here to the cheesecake factory for mainly three things cheesecake, the Thai Lettuce Wraps on the appetizers menu and the Miso Glazed Salmon dish. Every time I come here, I try a dish that I haven't had here before and always leave disappointed.  When you order the lettuce wraps, on the plate comes ice burg lettuce cups, three different sauces, chicken, and veggies and you build your own wrap. Its good and enjoyable to make yourself. Plus not everyone likes the same sauces and whatnot so they have the choice of what they want.  The Miso Glazed Salmon is served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of cooked asparagus. The perfect combination if you ask me, and if you are there at lunch time you have the option of ordering the 1/2 order since the dinner size is really big. But my recent order was the taco salad. it wasn't anything special but shredded lettuce, strips of seasoned tortilla chips tomatoes and avocado tossed in a mayo chipotle dressing and served as three heaping HILLS on your plate. Really? I paid $13 for this dish, something i could've made at home...was disappointed to say the least. I have tried a variety of their cheesecakes and the newest to my top list is the Pineapple upside down cake. The pineapple and crust is at the bottom and the cream cheese itself has a pineapple's flavor to it. Not so sweet, but just a perfect blend so you can enjoy it rather than having to take a sip of water between every bite.  The service from a recent visit i have gone was lacking. We were there in a group of four at most, yet have been seated after bigger groups whom arrived AFTER us has been seated. When i questioned the hostess  about it, she simply stated its easier to group the couples and bigger groups first when the room becomes available what are we??? Aside from that, it almost seemed as if the other waiters are more useful and punctual than our own waiter. we had to flag down a waiter from another table because the person waiting us can't be found. This was the first time that I have experienced such bad service. BUT, the service is usually really good and waiters are on their game. Overall, the atmosphere is nice and busy, friendly and you can enjoy your meal either outside or inside-they give you the option. The price is nothing to complain about since the servings are big enough, and the food isn't lacking in flavor. But sometimes, you wonder what is so special about that pasta dish that they can charge $15 for...."
Reid W.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,73,1,4.0,7/28/2012,"You can never really go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. Always good food. It can get a bit loud and crowded, but I'm willing to put up with that for and hour for a great meal."
Jordan A.,"McHenry, IL",0,10,,5.0,8/4/2014,Service wonderful. Food wonderful. Outdoor seating is so enjoyable. Our waitress was attentive to us throughout our meal even with her busy dining area. Felt like eating the same meals today - that's how great it was. We will look forward to our return!!
Kathy A.,"North Las Vegas, NV",5,20,2,3.0,6/12/2012,"Went here for a girls night out. The food was good but, not anything special. The portions are great which makes it worth the price.The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere.The place was clean the waiters were really friendly and attentive to our needs even though they were extremely busy."
leon g.,"North Hollywood, CA",2,95,,5.0,7/18/2010,Food is excellent. There is something everyone can find on the menu. The Cheesecake was amazing. I had an apple Cheesecake and it was so good. The portions are so big that you always have food to take home and eat for the next day. We were seated quickly and got our meal quickly.  There was a little something wrong with my mahi mahi dinner and the manager immediately took it off the bill. BTW. I ended up exchanging and eating the fish and chips and they were great.
E. J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,4.0,7/29/2014,"This is probably my favorite restaurant here in Las Vegas. I eat here at least once or twice a week. I also order take-outs fairly often. The food is always delicious. The menu has a ton of variety, so I never run out of options. The waiters are usually always polite and talkative. Of course, there are a few bad apples here and there but overall, the waiters I've met are great. This location is only 5 mins from my house, so very convenient. Love this restaurant!! Highly recommend!!"
Secret Shopper S.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,214,1,2.0,5/24/2012,"This rating is NOT based on the food. The food is good. The staff is exceedingly rude and snotty. I have eaten here a few times and the waiters, servers and hostesses have real attitude problems. They take their time and often throw the menus and the bill on the table. Plain nasty. No thanks. The parking is a nightmare. The rudest server was the petite blonde. Never again! When I go to Cheesecake Factory I prefer the one in Caesar's Palace (even though the dining area is very loud)"
Lisa H.,"Las Vegas, NV",213,199,78,3.0,8/5/2009,"I had the white pizza, hubby had chicken fingers and 2-YES 2 crab puff appetizers! Very good. My only regret was that Pumpkin cheesecake is not in season so I had the Tiramisu, yum.  Nice decor and atmosphere. Service was marginal. I had to ask for a tea refill after I was done with meal and dessert and waiter didn't have any other tables to look after. Tip reflected his neglectfulness.  We shall return."
Sarah N.,"Chicago, IL",343,348,315,3.0,10/11/2007,"I celebrated my 29th birthday here with my cousins.  I love them with all my heart.  I don't think I could be who I am today if I didn't have my cousins to grow up with.  For my 29th, they took me to Cheesecake Factory at Boca Park.  Also, I was here to celebrate my 30th birthday with my parents, and I hung out with one of my friend's here.  No, I'm not a Cheesecake Factory Lover, for some reason I would end up here from time to time. You don't need a reservation, however at times you'll find your self waiting if you don't have a reservation.  Most of the time it's on a Friday and Saturday that's it's busy.  But what restaurant isn't busy on those two days?  What I like about this spot is the fact it's a huge facility.  When I entered through the huge double doors that seem to reach the ceiling, I found how clean it was.  There was not a trash on site.  The restaurant was super clean and well kept.  I was very impressed by that. Upon seating, I notice that servers aren't really great.  They always seem to be in a hurry and don't take the time.  I always felt like I was being hurried.  If I took my time, they take forever to get back to me before I can order.  This always happened here. Let's start with appetizers.  I liked their Fire Roasted Artichokes.  I thought that was a good choice.  It took a long time to get through it but you don't feel so full after eating it.  Their Fried Calamari was just mediocre.  It had too much flour on it and it wasn't as plumpy or juicy as Philippino's make it.  My dad makes them better.  Another you can't go wrong with is the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  It's a good starter and isn't too salty.  As for the negatives, don't order their Lettuce Wraps.  It's just not good enough, even to compare to P.F. Chang's.    The only entree I can remember that I liked was the Meat Loaf.  It tasted very good and was very filling.  The serving portions are so great that you can even take it home with you and eat the rest for lunch the next day.  I only go here if I don't feel like thinking about what to eat and where to go.  Maybe that's why I always end up here."
Anthony M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,2,,1.0,11/15/2013,"Upon entering the restaurant I patiently waited behind another customer who was greeted and taken to be seated. I stood in front of the hostess station for roughly 5 minutes without being acknowledged by the hostess, although there were numerous times where eye contact was made, there was no attempt to greet, acknowledge etc... At the point were she began to have a casual conversation with another hostess, I asked if she intended on seating my wife and I. She stated in a very short manner ""well I thought you might have been with another party that had already checked in"". A simple greeting and may I help you could have cleared any uncertainty.. My wife and I were then seated immediately by another hostess who apologized. I asked to speak with a manager and someone who appeared to be a waiter approached the table and stated that he was the manager and would address the poor customer service my wife and I experienced on what was our wedding anniversary lunch. He didn't seem to take my complaint very seriously and to top it off, once we received our food, it was extremely salty. I didn't feel another complaint would go anywhere so I kindly paid by bill, tipped the waitress Alisha and left.. I will never return."
Tim M.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,39,,1.0,7/1/2012,Could not believe how far downhill The Cheesecake Factory has gone downhill!  Four of us went and our meals were terrible!  Clearly not as I remembered from other The Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Would I go back? NOT!
