S. P.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,2.0,3/16/2012,"A couple years ago, this place was good. I always loved coming here for the ambiance, and the food was always pretty awesome. Within the past year, though, I've had complaints, but still gave them chances to redeem themselves. But now, I don't think I'll be back for a while.  During one visit, we had a group of six people. I don't know what was going on with our waiter, but he came to check on us maybe once after we got our food, and none of our drinks were ever filled. When it came time to drop off the bill, we were informed that gratuity was already added to the bill. In my experience, places only do this if your party is eight or larger. The only reason this pissed us off was because it then clicked in our heads, ""Oh, so that's why he didn't give a fuck about serving us. He's getting a fat tip anyway."" And it's not like he was nowhere to be found. We saw him several times, checking on people around us, but could never get his attention. I only wish I could remember his name. But what iced the cake was our last visit. My boyfriend ordered a burger, medium rare. When it came out, it looked good until he took a bite of it. The entire inside was raw. It was so disgusting, I couldn't even believe it. Our waitress seemed to agree, and she took it back for them to make a new one. Then a manager came and sort of apologized, asked if we wanted anything else. We're all modest and junk so we said, ""No, we're fine,"" but of course we were expecting they at least wouldn't charge us for the burger or, ya know, give us a coupon or something. Nothing. Guess they don't seem to care if the customer gets food poisoning because of their careless chefs. Not trying to sound like a freeloader, I just think it was a horrible business call. Anyways, it was enough for me to want to stay away for a while."
Denise B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,20,,3.0,8/24/2012,"Service was a little slow.  Went for dessert last night.  Had the Choc Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake.  We were served the cake right away, but sat there waiting and waiting for a check.  The cheesecake was fabulous."
Sam T.,"Las Vegas, NV",139,185,15,5.0,8/27/2011,"We went to this Cheesecake Factory restaurant tonight and had a really good time. Our waiter was pretty attentive to us and always was checking on us. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. Let me just say this thing was amazing. The flavors were outstanding. I then had the Spicy Chipolte chicken pasta. Cannot believe how great that was. I have been several times before and I always have the same dish. With the great food, and the good service I can only say I wish I was going back tomorrow. By far and away my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."
KD S.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,174,32,3.0,1/28/2012,"I was a regular fan, but somehow the food is starting to go down hill.  However the cheese is the bomb."
Ryan D.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,86,6,2.0,2/15/2012,"I usually enjoy business lunch meetings at the Cheescake Factory but yesterday had a lousy experience.   The location in Summerlin is typically very busy but they usually still manage to have good service.   Yesterday was an exception, and hopefully just a glitch.  After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our server to finally come tank drink orders.    She was obviously distracted and we realized later than Sen. John Ensign was sitting in the booth behind us and that was flustering her for some reason.   The food was ok - about what I typically expect from CF but nothing outstanding."
Jukers M.,"Las Vegas, NV",32,48,1,3.0,2/11/2012,"Came to the Cheesecake Factory for a late company Christmas party back in January and it was an okay experience. I usually go to the one in GV and compared to this one, GV has way better service. We constantly had empty drinks and even though we asked for the wheat bread, the waitress kept trying to shove the sourdough down our throats. The only reason I gave this location 3 stars was because of the food, too bad the food couldn't save them to 5 stars."
Rick M.,"Las Vegas, NV",63,3,3,4.0,7/15/2010,"They have a broad menu, if you can't find what you like maybe you should not have come.  Prices are subject to tastes; the better the taste, the bigger the price but worth it!"
Paolo D.,"Las Vegas, NV",811,977,80,4.0,4/27/2009,"There is nothing special about this particular Cheesecake Factory, other than I was just there last night.  The food is good as expected.  Their Mojitos are also very good.  I tried all four - regular, pomegranate, passionfruit, and pineapple - and have to say the pomegranate is my favorite."
Keli C.,"Las Vegas, NV",51,55,44,4.0,2/5/2014,always love the cheesecake factory!!! just never have room for dessert unless you do a doggy bag and eat the dessert half way thru.
Debbie C.,"Clarks Summit, PA",31,242,,2.0,12/21/2010,"I went here last week with my son for lunch. My suggestion no less. I just remember that years ago it was very good. Not so much this time.  We were seated in the bar area which was fine it is just that the table was very small. Barely held the drinks and the plates. We had two of the small appetizers, the corn fritters and the fried artichoke hearts. They were both very good. This is why I have to at least apply the second star. Now I can only speak for my lunch but it was inedible. I ordered the lunch Chicken Picatta. I knew as soon as it was set in front of me something was not right. The chicken was a shade of white like I have never seen before. I took a bite anyway, It was retched, I spit it right out. I thought maybe it was me, tried a second bite. Again same terrible spoiled taste. The only person I saw who worked there was the bus boy, I told him the chicken was bad. He promptly took my plate. He came back after a few minutes to tell me the manager would be over and they were cooking another one for me. I told him no thanks, just the thought of chicken was making me sick. The manager came over to ask me what was wrong. I explained, she was behaving as though she did not believe me. Starts telling me that they get fresh food every other day. I am not saying they don't, but the damn chicken was bad. She states maybe it is the capers, NO i have had capers a million times, I did not even put a caper in my mouth. I told her that I was being very discreet regarding this and did not cause a scene. She asked if I would prefer something else, I ordered a plain burger. When the burger arrived it was fine.  What bothers me the most is that they were acting like I was making this up. Second my son and I ate in shifts. I do not see my son enough to want to have our lunch together ruined and eaten in shifts.  When I got the check, my son asked if they removed the chicken charge, they did, he asked if they charged for the burger, they did. He was pretty pissed about this stating i should not have been charged for the burger.  At this point I was over the Cheesecake Factory, and will never be heading back."
Regeana M.,"Las Vegas, NV",61,13,2,4.0,9/18/2011,Great happy hour and an expansive menue. The menue is more like a book to read. They treat you really nice on your birthday which is why I have gone there the past two birthdays. The portions are large but they do offer lunch sizes. There is almost always a long wait but it has a great bar to while away the time. Oh and the cheesecake is to die for....save room or make room!
Terri K.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,94,2,3.0,1/13/2011,"I don't even know how many times I've been to the Cheesecake Factory, albeit at different locations; this was my first time at this particular Cheesecake Factory, but because Cheesecake Factory is a chain, I didn't expect anything out of Cheesecake Factory ordinary (except I was surprised at how empty this particular location was). The atmosphere and layout are similar to other Cheesecake Factories, and of course, the menu is the same. Let me pause for a moment and talk about the menu- it's big, with what seems like an endless array of menu items spanning across the globe in terms of cuisines. What's nice about the extensive menu is you can try something new every time you visit (that is, if you don't go everyday), but what's not so nice about the menu is the time it takes to make a decision about what to eat.  Anyways, after being seated, complimentary bread was brought to our table. We had two choices of bread- a soft brown bread with oats on top (Could it be Pumpernickel or Honey Oat?) and a sourdough baguette.  After perusing the menu, I decided to order the Soup of the Day, which was a Lentil Soup with an infusion of bacon essence. Even though there were hardly any customers, it took a long time before our food came out, leaving me no choice but to eat a lot of the bread. By the time my soup came out, I was already full, but I managed to finish most of the soup. The soup itself was very hearty and chunky with lots of lentils, reminiscent of porridge. The flavors were good, but the bacon flavor that the server emphasized was not vey noticeable. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. Portions are large, prices are reasonable, the cheesecakes are good, and there's something for everybody, which I think are the main reasons for why Cheesecake Factory is so popular."
EJay D.,"Las Vegas, NV",76,366,13,5.0,5/3/2009,"One of my all-time favorite places to eat. Big portions and the food is delicious. So much to choose from. Try the shrimp scampi, chicken madeira (ask for pasta instead of mashed potatoes),chicken picatte, shrimp po boy, thai lettuce wraps, cashew chicken, miso salmon, Cajun rib eye steak and calamari. The hits just keep on coming! These are just a few of the dishes that I have experienced. The service has always been consistently good. Do not forget the cheesecake and other sinful desserts. Deelish! If you have never eaten here before. Trust me, you will be a fan."
Stephanie S.,"Seattle, WA",344,221,27,3.0,2/11/2009,"I give you three stars Cheesecake Factory, for being what Family Guy calls, the practice girl.  You're always around when I need a pick up, you're not too fussy, and at the end of the night if I don't want to call you the next day, I don't have to and you don't mind. Food is priced pretty average, no meal should cost you more than 20 bucks if you don't get the cheesecake, but by all means, get the cheesecake, it's why you came after all. In fact, a friend and I only go here for cheesecake, our once every six month hang out to dish over life at our respective colleges and stuff our faces with white chocolate raspberry truffle and godiva chocolate cheesecake respectively.  They also give decent breads and are in a nice plaza with other similiarly wish-I-was-in-LA-Summerlin-boutiques and a new Gordon Biersch next door when you want to start slamming them down and accepting your life as the Real Housewives of Las Vegas. Cheers to you soccer mom, Cheesecake Factory is your Ketchup with class."
Jess P.,"Las Vegas, NV",53,273,59,3.0,10/8/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is pretty run of the mill. From the overwhelming selection of food on the menu (seriously, pick a damn food theme!) to all the crazy ads in the menu, it always takes me years to get through the menu. And even though I've been to Cheesecake Factory 324890789459843 times, I never eat the cheesecake there. Well, I can't say never; I did ONCE, got massively sick and haven't touched any cheesecake since. You must be wondering why I still go back to Cheesecake Factory? You know what, I wonder why I go back too."
Kim B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,30,,1.0,4/23/2014,"You would think I would have learned my lesson after getting very sick eating their spaghetti carbonara two years ago--- and I have a cast iron stomach. But no. This past Sunday my family stopped here for dinner our way back from a long road trip--- we had not eaten since breakfast. Our server was friendly and courteous and yes, they do have a huge menu. We each ordered different things. My husband ordered the fish and chips. About 8 hours later in the middle of the night (and not having eaten anything else), he was extremely and violently sick. Sick for 2 and a half days, in fact. There is no way I will ever go near the place again. This time I've learned my lesson."
Steve B.,"Las Vegas, NV",42,15,,4.0,4/11/2012,Good food with great service.  Plates are large and the offers way too many choices but once we waded through it were very pleased.
Miriam R.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,47,,5.0,11/26/2011,I ordered the Cajan style ribeye which is marinated for 36 hour and it was delicious. Good customer service and clean.
Joyce O.,"Las Vegas, NV",140,222,39,2.0,6/15/2011,"this was my first experience at the Cheesecake Factory in all it's existence.  my cousin had her 15th birthday dinner here and my first impression... BUSY! [Which didn't shock me.. because every time I come across a Cheesecake Factory, it always seems to be busy!] anyway, it's a nice looking place in a nice area with plenty of parking and seats to sit down outside because it's always obviously busy.    we were seated within the 20 minute time frame that they gave us.. which was understandable because we were a big party.  it is a shopping mall so there's a little bit of window shops to look at while you wait.   we were finally seated and it seemed well kept... and for how busy it seemed it's a pretty good job they do of keeping this place up.   It's a large restaurant with lots of seating and lots of patrons.  Idk, I'm not big on the large crowds and large places so I guess that's why this review pretty much sucks. anyway, the menu is LARGE.  I use the word overwhelming a lot, but this menu is truly overwhelming.  there's like.. 2,000 things on this menu.  luckily everything had a description. so I had the Factory Burrito Grande.  nothing special about it... typical.  only it was huge.... like the size of a baby huge.  the cheesecake I have to admit was really good.  they were huge pieces and the waiter let us know that so we didn't go all out and order 1 slice per person.   the slice was seriously good enough for 4 people.  they were huge... but very good.  eh... it's not a first choice for me.  i like small dives and secrets.  i don't know.. it was just alright. sorry.  again, this review sucks and i don't care cause i don't think i'll ever take a drive to this place ever again anyway.  so thanks for the baby burrito."
Clint B.,"Las Vegas, NV",762,1113,4735,2.0,7/2/2010,"I can't believe when  I was younger I actually thought the Cheesecake Factory was considered fine-dining. Thankfully my tastes have evolved over the years. They still have decent dishes, as far as national chain restaurants go. But, quality is something I don't associate with this place anymore. Since when is tuna gray? That was the case with the tuna tartare that arrived at my table. It was mainly a stack of avocado with a few chunks of gray tuna on top. Other dishes that I've had recently have been ok -- the  avocado eggrolls were perfectly crispy and not too oily and the chicken samosas were decent. Then, of course there's the cheesecake. It's the main reason why I liked this place growing up. On our last visit we tried the tiramisu cheesecake and the chocolate mouse cheesecake. Neither had the rich, creamy, indulgent taste that I remember. Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory just doesn't live up to the expectations I once built up. Although I'm not totally ruling out a return visit when my cheesecake craving returns."
