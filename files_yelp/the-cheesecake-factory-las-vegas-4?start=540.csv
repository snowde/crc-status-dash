Robert S.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,146,,4.0,2/17/2014,"For a large chain restaurant, this place is worth visiting.  Their menu is ginormous, so variety is not an issue.  The Buffalo Blasts were very tasty, as was the Ahi Carpaccio.  I would skip the crunchy crab balls, they had very little flavor.  My wife enjoyed chicken nachos, while my son and I had Steak Diane and Scampi.  The sauce on the Diane is very good, but the scampi is a bit too sweet.  Overall, good experience."
Paul M.,"Las Vegas, NV",160,156,7,5.0,1/9/2011,Yep I'm a regular here!  Yesterday had lunch with 4 other friends.  This time I enjoyed a simple two egg brakfast for lunch.  Wow somebody actaully knows how to make egss over medium correctly!  Add to that nice hash browns and a freshly baked english muffin and for $6.95?  Try to top THAT IHOP!
Kara E.,"Carlsbad, CA",24,54,2,2.0,3/8/2011,They have ridiculously high prices for Mediocre food and mediocre service.  Save ur money and eat somewhere else!
Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",851,405,1336,4.0,6/26/2008,"The first time I went here was when I was a freshman back at UNLV in '96.  I went to the one in Caesar's Palace.  Wow, was I amazed, probably because coming from Maui we didn't have too many places like this.  It was busy, bustling with lots of people, and lots of good food and drink.  It was one of the better dining experiences I remember. This review comes from the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park.  I took my gf's daughter there for her 6th birthday (a very important time for a little one).  It was just her and me.  This was her first time here (that she can remember) and she was just as awestruck as I was when I first saw the place.  The decor can be considered a mix of new and old, big, tall front doors, the ambience with lots of mood lighting and tall ceilings.  It almost seems like you're stepping into a 5 star restaurant.  That is until, you see dad in his khaki shorts and mom with her summer sandals.  Which is nice, because it makes the place seem less pompous and more friendly. I really like the food here.  I love the big portions and the mix of American, Italian, and Asian food they serve.  After seating us, we received our complimentary bread basket which I usually look forward to.  They give the usual 2 types of bread, a crusty french bread, and a wonderful wheat pumpernickel type bread.  It's really good but only when it's hot and fresh, so make sure if your server gives you a cold basket you request a new fresh one. I don't usually have any appetizers here because I like to save room for the large entree (which I never finish) and possibly some cheesecake (well...duh, it's Cheesecake Factory), but I have heard folks say that their Thai Lettuce Wraps are definitely worth trying.  Their Factory Nachos with chicken is a pretty big platter as well and is great for sharing. I for some reason always order the same thing when I go to a place I like.  This time was no different.  I got my fav, the DOUBLE B.B.Q. BACON CHEESEBURGER.  I LOVE this thing.  It's a double-decker Angus burger with a BBQ-ranch sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, crispy fried onions, lettuce and tomato.  You also get a side on fries.  This bad boy well over a  pound once you put it together.  I can never get the thing in my mouth so I gotta eat it in layers.  I always end up eating only half, and take the other half home for a nice midnight snack.  This burger is SOOOO good, you gotta try it. The little one got FETTUCINI WITH CHICKEN AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES.  Smart kid, this dish cost me around $16  (almost TWICE the price of my burger)...and here I thought she wanted to order off the kids menu.  Quick note **this place has NO kids menu** so if you bring them in they order off the big people menu too.  I thought she wanted chicken fingers...she was like, ""No, I want white sauce"".  Lucky birthday girl...white sauce it is!  The fettuccini comes in a nice size bowl, and was flavored excellently.  It has this garlic cream-parmesan sauce that was very creamy and rich and complimented the grilled chicken well.  It also has sun-dried tomatoes on it, which I like, but the little one thought they were gross so I had to put them on the side.  For a kid that weighs only 45 pounds, she nearly killed that pasta.  She ate a good 3/4 of it by herself.  You can tell she liked it because she had a ring of white cream sauce around her lips.  So funny! You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and NOT try their cheesecake!  That's like going to gym and not working out (although I may have done that once..or twice).  They have like over 50 cheesecakes you can choose from, and they range from about $6 -$8 a slice.  A bit pricey, but worth it for some stellar cheesecake.  You're not supposed to have more than one slice at a time anyway.  We didn't get any cheesecake this trip (the little one said 'Eww' to cheesecake and settled on her complimentary birthday sundae), which makes my first sentence in this paragraph a little contradictory.  Oh well.  But I can tell you my favorites are Tres Leches cheesecake (so dreamy), and the Oreo cheesecake (full of Oreo chunks).  Great for an end to your dining.  You can also request to take a slice of cheesecake to go and your server will pack it up for you in a nice little cheesecake container to take with you.   All in all it was a nice time.  The little one enjoyed her pasta, her pint-sized birthday sundae, and the Happy Birthday singing from some of the servers.  I always enjoy going here, great food and great service. SO GO.  HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT, GET SOME WINE, AND END WITH SOME CHEESECAKE.  ENJOY!"
Fuhq B.,"Biloxi, MS",1,33,1,5.0,11/14/2010,"I get the same thing every time I go. Chicken Madeira. I've tried a few other things, and they've all been great. But the above mentioned dish is my absolute favorite.  The beauty about the Cheesecake Factory is that at every single location I've been to across the country, the quality of the food is equally terrific and I've never tasted any variations. I would also like to recommend the pumpkin cheesecake when it's in season. DELICIOUS."
Curtis K.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,169,56,4.0,3/28/2011,"It's been awhile since I ate at the cheescake factory maybe to long.      We had the grilled artichoke this was very good , had a nice grilled flavor to it , unlike some places that say they grill ,but you cant' tell. We also had the stuffed mushrooms from the tapas menu. It was stuffed with fontina cheese and garlic, topped with parm cheese in a wine sauce.                  For my main course I had the cobb salad it comes w/ a balsamic dressing but i chose to have it with ranch. This was the dinner portion it was huge. It was full of bacon , boiled eggs , chicken  ,blue cheese and topped with  a half an avocado. This was more like a chopped salad which  I prefer.. Everything was chopped into small pieces except  the chix which was sliced, and it was full of chix. I joked to my wife that they put a whole chix in the salad , she had the same thing and hers was full of chix too.              We also had the low carb cheesecake with a walnut crust , yummy.   Service was a little slow but i don't blame the server she ran her butt off , it seemed they were under staffed. It was very busy."
Holla F.,"Oakland, CA",45,366,1170,2.0,4/3/2011,"Lunch special for $12. I got the chicken fettuni w/sun dried tomatoes. Not really worth it although you can make two meals out of it. Eh, I can make better pasta myself."
Jesse K.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,143,5,3.0,7/1/2011,"Extremely large menu makes it hard to decide.  The service staff is never very helpful as they are always busy and usually unfamiliar with the menu.  Very pricy but the portions of most dishes are very large.  The desserts are fantastic, but take it out and eat it at home."
Erik S.,"Las Vegas, NV",43,90,44,4.0,6/23/2008,"I think this place is a great choice for food for a couple of reasons: price, location, food and outdoor seating.  Located in Boca Park near Suncoast and Badlands Golf Course, it is part of shopping complex that has many draws besides the restaurant. The average price for this excellent quality of food is around $10-$15 dollars for an entree.  The desserts (the Cheesecakes, of course) are anywhere from $6 to $8.  I ordered Chicken Madiera with Steak Diane (a combo plate) that cost $19.99.  They bring out a couple different types of bread before your meal that will hold you over for the 30-45 minute wait for food (this place is usually always busy). The food itself, I believe, is excellent.  it may not be at every location but with a Gordon Biersch next door, they have to step up the quality.  The steak I had was complimented nicely with mashed potatoes that weren't simply mashed potatoes; the meat was covered in a tasty mushroom wine sauce while the chicken was topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese (also with a mushroom sauce). The desserts are excellent as well...they should be considering the name of the restaurant.  We had the Vanilla Bean (my son will only eat Vanilla) and Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecakes; both were rich and tasty and something we would order again. The service here is as to be expected for such a busy restaurant.  We sat outside where there are fans and mist machines to keep you cool.  It was much quieter and less cramped; you also have a nice view of either the condo's next to Suncoast or the valley below. The menu is expansive, I only covered what I ate, but I would try many other dishes here (I have in the past, all have been excellent).  The restaurant looks a lot fancier and expensive than it really is.  There isn't a kids menu so plan to order a full meal for them or just share like I did...there is plenty to go around!"
Lulu R.,"San Jose, CA",1,21,,3.0,8/16/2011,"I usually like to go to Cheesecake Factory with a big group because there is something for everyone.  We were seating immediately on Thursday night, which was unusual for me as we normally have to wait for most CFs.  The service was good.  My biggest issue was that the food came out at all different temperatures (my pasta looked like it had been sitting a while).  I have eaten at the CF in Caesars and found the food better but the wait much longer... Trade-offs..."
Annie G.,"Spanaway, WA",265,96,283,5.0,6/20/2010,"So I went to this Cheesecake Factory last night not knowing what to expect except for cheesecakes... I had a good time sitting around with some of the folks from work have a couple of glasses of wine, a shot of something (forgot the name), a sprite, appetizers, and of course the cheesecake. My friend ordered the tuxedo cheesecake and we shared.. It was good. For the appetizers, we ate nachos and chips (platter size) and other stuff. One of the girls ordered personal pansize pizzas for her grandbabies. We were thinking that they were maybe four pieces like Pizza Hut...Boy were we wrong. It was more like ten pieces. One of the kids had pepperoni and the other had a cheese pizza. Thanks, ladies."
Paul H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,8,,4.0,8/27/2011,"Very nice atmosphere and extensive menu. I partcularly like our booth as it felt private. Excellent, non-pushy comfortable service. The choices in cheescake is unbelievable  !! Like 7 bucks but plenty to share with your date :)"
Heather P.,"Reno, NV",6,60,,2.0,1/19/2013,"This is the second time in a row that I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory, and the service sucked again!  The server did not check on our table of six even once.  We went for lunch on a weekday, and the entire meal took an hour and a half (some of us work and and some point need to go back!)  There were other tables that arrived and ordered after us, but ate and left before us, even though we had the same server.   Two of us in the group ordered a lunch salad and sandwich combo, but  substituted for an upgraded salad.  While the server said there ""might be a small up-charge"" for the difference, she ending up charging us an additional entree charge ($11) because she said that the difference for the two salads equals one entree so it was just easier for her to put in on the check that way.  WTF?  I've never heard of anything like that, and charging half the cost of an additional entree for a salad up-charge is ridiculous.  The customer service at this CF is non-existent.  I'm  giving two stars because the food is good, even though the employees are sub-par."
Will F.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,10,,5.0,9/30/2007,"How can you go wrong with Cheesecake. My favorite dish is the Chicken Picatta with a extra side of the sauce with a ice cold cup of their passion ice tea. Man it just makes my mouth water thinking about it.  I'm so stuff after eating, I barely have no room for dessert but that never stops me from ordering a piece to take home for a late night snack."
Karen V.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,5.0,6/28/2013,"First I want to say that I have got to The Cheesecake Factory in many cities across the U.S. and have always experienced the same high quality food, service, and restaurant decor.  It has always been a very pleasant experience.  Since living in LV I have frequented the one on Rampart and love the food.  The variety of menu items should satisfy anyone's desires.  My favorite lately is meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  The potatoes are real and soooo yummy!  And I love the tropical ice tea.  I have also tried he oriental chicken.  It is enough for 2 and spiced just right.  Let's not even discuss all the cheesecakes!  They are to die for !  Hope this convinces you to give it a try."
Eduardo P.,"Las Vegas, NV",186,76,18,4.0,7/8/2010,"Everytime I come here the food is good. I know they have cheesecake factories everywhere, but im a big fan of cheesecake, I like the variety they have, and it always tastes great.  I came here a couple months ago for lunch, and had the lousiana chicken pasta. It came out great. Although, the slice of cheesecake I had, seemed smaller, then what they served at the one at Caesars Palace. Then again, its been about a year since I ate at that one, so things might have changed, and they are cutting down the portions."
carl t.,"Enid, OK",99,19,4,1.0,9/20/2009,"Lemme just start off by saying that I've given this place 5 (yes five) seperate chances..  busy hours will give you poor service and poor quality food because the kitchen is just pushing orders out.  The menu is too large and it's obvious they do not ""specialize"" in a certain type of food besides cheesecake.  Wine selection is awesome.  The portions are ""American-ized"", I wish for quality not quantity, we are becoming too obese because of places like this...  Every one that I've visited has been very nicely decorated with great ambience if you just want desert and some wine I'd say stop by.. Let me just say so people dont hate on me, I tried all the dishes that were supposed to be ""the best"", this place blows donkey balls"
Chance A.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,6,,5.0,3/20/2011,"Miss Nicoly Poly Oly is my fave server. Too many options, the menu is like an encyclopedia, and is never disappointiong. I cannot fathom how they can keep all their menu knowledge together, but it never fails to impress. Granted the wait time is always a bit tedious, but it's well worth it when you order the right thing. And if you don't, the operative word=CHEESECAKE!"
Melanie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,31,2,2.0,7/31/2010,"The service was friendly but highly inadequate. The food was delivered incorrectly and slowly. Once delivered not overwhelmingly wonderful, but not horrible either...although I did have about three soggy shrimp in the mix. Not sure how you make soggy shrimp but they managed to do it!"
Anthony R.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,12,1,5.0,7/29/2012,"Always love this Cheesecake Factory - The food is absolutely amazing, the cheesecake is epic and the service is phenomenal. I've been here several times since moving to Las Vegas and intend to continue regularly as my girlfriend enjoys it as much as I do. Just overall a great experience for couples, friends, and family alike!"
