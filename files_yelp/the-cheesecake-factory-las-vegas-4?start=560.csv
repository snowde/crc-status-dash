Derek W.,"Las Vegas, NV",190,85,,5.0,2/14/2013,"we went for my sisters birthday, they hooked us up with a large enough table to seat the family, even with last minute reservations.  food was good, service was good.  had a great time."
Erin L.,"Plano, TX",284,83,19,3.0,1/23/2010,Food is always consistant and I usually have a great service from the actually server however noticed the manager screaming at an employee in front of everyone and then  the manager chose to stand and do nothing and I so wanted to say something to the manager for being a jerk.  Otherwise my cheesecake was fabulous as normal :)
Jimmy H.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,16,,5.0,5/17/2010,had the new Thai Noodle Salad today at lunch time. Best $10 salad I've had. Lots of flavor & very good portion. My soda was free for some reason. I sat at the bar.
Brian I.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,12,,1.0,8/4/2012,"Went with my mother for a nice meal.  Unfortunately although the food appeared good from afar, the meal I ordered with chicken and shrimp had extremely raw shrimp.  I was barely cooked and was still gray without a hint of orange indicating it was cooked.  Basically it was barely heated.  I brought it to the attention of the server who told the manager.  The manager came over and apologized and did not charge for my entree.  However, the serving of seafood in this manner was incredibly unsafe and it really was inexcusable to be plated and served."
Linda N.,"San Francisco, CA",124,506,,4.0,11/14/2010,"love love love cheesecake factory! came in on a sunday at peak dinner hour. we were able to get seats right away in the bar area. i like that this place has a little bit of everything. a little asian, a little mexican, etc. the menu is huge which makes it hard to choose something to eat sometimes. i had the garlic noodles with chicken which was very tasty. my friends ordered the chicken enchiladas and the combo of steak diane and salmon. all of it very good. didn't order any cheesecake this time which is a first! service was great. can't wait to come back!"
B S.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,34,,5.0,9/6/2009,no wait....most of the time. My fav's:   thai chicken wrap. kids love this...lots of selection and fresh food. Lots to share.
Sheryl R.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,39,,5.0,4/26/2011,"I have taken advantage of the 4-6 PM Happy Hour food and drink 4x in April 2011 and never felt disappointed. Southwest eggrolls, Chicken Coquettes w/fontina cheese, Avacado Eggrolls, Stuffed Mushrooms in marsala wine sauce. Over 30 items under $6 for HH. That's impressive! Everything was well cooked and delicious. Large, well made drink specials like Long Island Iced Tea $5, pizza for the kids and desserts to make you smile or moan.  A special small plate menu in addition to the HH menu. Many, many choices on the regular menu around $13 which is a bargain in LV.  I met several people who eat there 2-3x a week. This chain is a winner and tops any other I have ever been to. Going to miss it since there is none within 3 hrs of me.  The Rampart location does get crowded but there is plenty of parking although. you may have to walk a block across the parking lot if it is dinner hour. Have not tried the strip location inside Caesars Forum Shopping complex."
Martin T.,"Las Vegas, NV",161,138,3,3.0,3/27/2009,"Typical American Fare, good food great atmosphere food is more of generic not really known for Signature Dishes."

Munair D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,4,,2.0,1/21/2011,"I am not really one who goes to the ""cheesecake factory"" for dinner or dining period, but after some Boca park shopping my friend and I got hungry and wanted to give it a shot. We got there and it was pretty busy but was sat within 4 minutes. Where we got sat was unfortunately cramped with other restaurant patrons seated so close to us we almost thought they were eating with us. It took approximately 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us who let us know that he isn't really our server but will get us some water while we wait. The Menu That takes you about 25 minutes to read cause it's more like a novel than an menu had bought our ""real server"" time I guess to realize she's our waitress. We only got 1 order of bread I guess our first and last cause my friend mentioned to our ""not our waiter"" and our ""real waiter"" for more bread while we wait for our meal that was already taking a while of which was ignored. The experience was not a good one, They would of gotten 1 star but I gave 2 cause honestly we felt sorry for our waitress cause she appeared overwhelmed. I think Cheesecake Factory needs to re train their staff."
Darla B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,11,,2.0,8/25/2012,"disappointed with the service. i went to this location just for dessert, and was there for 45 minutes. we were sat immediately and order within the first 5 minutes. my  cheesecake was wonderful as always but the server was inattentive to us, which I'm assuming was because we had made it known we were there for dessert only. we should have been in and out in 20 minutes, instead i sat there for 20 minutes waiting for the check. the waiter was nowhere to be seen, so i couldn't even stop him to ask for it. would i have received the same service if i had ordered a meal?? i think i will continue to make the trip to Caesars palace to enjoy the cheesecake factory in the future."
David K.,"Las Vegas, NV",58,190,89,2.0,8/6/2010,"You want the best cheesecake in town? Go to Rocco's on Buffalo, next go to the Bagel Cafe.  Don't get cheesecake at the factory.  Then if you get to the food at cheesecake factory, it has gone downhill over the years."
Lila J.,"San Jose, CA",69,180,,5.0,9/30/2007,"I had to write a review about this place because I just read Will F.'s review.  My fave dish is the Chicken Picatta, too... yum!!!!!  My second favorite would have to be the Cajun Chicken Littles... and that is a very, very close second!  I love all the dipping sauces-- especially their ranch!  You have to ask for it because it doesn't come with the dish.  This location is always super busy...but probably not as busy as the Caesar's one. My favorite cheesecakes are, in no special order: original, white chocolate raspberry, banana cream, and cookie dough.  My favorite non-cheesecake dessert there is definitely Linda's Chocolate Cake.  It is super moist and chocolatey!!  Also love their strawberry lemonade!!"
