Maria M.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,33,129,2.0,9/3/2017,"We came here for dinner tonight with family there were eight of us and on a Sunday night I knew there'd be a little wait, they were busy so the hostess gave us a pager and told us they'd have a table in 20 minutes. We waited, 20 minutes came and gone then it was 30 and 40 by this time my kids 7,6, and 16 months were growing tired, hangry and bored. It was a full hour of waiting and asking twice about our table. We were seeing people who walked in when we did and even after leaving having finished their dinner Very Disappointing! We get to our table and sit the silverware felt grainy almost dirty they took a while to take our order and even let ne'er to get it a whole hour to be exact. By this time the restaurant wasn't busy at all so no excuses. All the food came out except my sons pizza which we had to ask for after it seemed like she was busy attending another table. Food was okay except my meatloaf had aluminum foil still on it!! I told the server she takes it to her boss then she offers me another their meal which is nice but I'm not about to sit there another hour to get it. My daughters pasta was tasteless. I don't get it we go through the one at Caesars palace all the time and Never Ever had a problem there. I'm sorry to say I won't be back to this location. This wasn't the first complaint from here which made it easier for me not to come back."
Melissa H.,"San Jose, CA",9,51,16,2.0,11/11/2017,"The food is always good here, and I knew coming on a Saturday night would require a wait. We got seated in about 15 minutes, then had to wait another 10 for our waiter to check on us for our order. We had to wait about 30ish minutes for food, when our waiter came to tell us they dropped our food on the floor (try explaining that to a hangry 6 year old) and they would be remaking it asap. Anyways, the manager comes over about 5 minutes later and apologizes for the inconvenience and offers to refill our drinks for us. So another 45 minutes pass, we get our food and the bill, and I was just a little disappointed to see them charge us for the ""birthday cheesecake"" we received, and all the refills of the drinks the manager offered us. I get that I could have clarified, but from a huge chain I would have at least hoped when the manager came by to offer us refills since we were so ""inconvenienced"", that they would have been comped, or at least the damn ""birthday"" cheesecake after making us wait another 30 minutes for our food. Just a note - this review isn't about the money, it's just a shame to see that a huge chain like this wasn't more willing to appreciate their customers, they were only concerned with the turnover. Probably won't be back here, although the staff doesn't care anyways"
Michelle M.,"Phoenix, AZ",1387,232,4130,3.0,12/11/2015,"Came to this location around 6 pm on a Wednesday night. Not sure if it was the time of day that I went, but the place was totally crowded and there were people standing from the check-in spot all the way out the front door. I wasn't going to stay, but the lady at check-in told me for a party of two, it would be about 10 minutes.  After standing and waiting for 25 minutes, we were finally seated. The table that we were seated at, wasn't completely cleaned yet. Please don't seat me if the table isn't ready! Once seated, our waitress took our drink order, which we only asked for ice water. That took 10 minutes to get to us. After about another 10 minutes she took our food order. Normally at Cheesecake Factory, they bring you bread and butter right away, she didn't bring ours until our food was almost brought out. I would've understood if she was actually busy, but we saw her just standing around multiple times. Our food came out after about 25 minutes, which was delicious as always. It was nice a warm and tasted fresh. Our waitress didn't come around again until we asked for a to-go box and our check. Not sure if she had a long day or was just having a bad one, but she wasn't friendly at all.  Pros: 1. Nicely located in a shopping area. 2. Food was delicious! Cons: 1. Unfriendly staff  2. Crowded 3. Ladies bathroom was dirty and there was paper towels scattered all over the floor. Food we ordered: 1.My friend ordered the  Mac N Cheese Burger with a Caesar salad. Loved the salad. Dressing was amazing. I don't know what was different about it, but it was the best I've tasted. Burger was also delicious. Meat Charbroiled and topped with our creamy fried Macaroni and Cheese Balls and Cheddar Cheese Sauce. 2. I ordered the Garlic Noodles that had oven roasted tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms, fresh asparagus and Parmesan in a garlic sauce. Was soo good!! 3. Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. I'm a big fan of mango, so I had to order this. It was more then too sweet for me. I was only able to have about 3 bites. Still was good."
Andrea E.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,25,10,2.0,1/20/2017,"Once my favorite local restaurant, this location now specializes in disappointment.  My last three to go orders have been wrong, lost, very late, and often a combination of all three.   Managers refuse to credit your card - even for food you don't get - which has caused me to contest charges with my AMEX company.  Instead they offer issue you a credit for the wronged item and ship it to your house.  Sometimes it comes....Most times, it does not.   Is the food good?  Sure....if you can get it. Overall there are too many other options in Summerlin...We don't need to be subjected to poor service and execution."
Jin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",279,1042,1684,4.0,12/9/2015,"Some people might scoff at me for liking Cheesecake factory. Whatever floats your boat. There's only two items on the menu that keeps me coming back here. BUFFALO BLAAAAAAASTS. What is that? What was in there? Buffalo marinated chicken with cheese inside of fried wonton wrappers. Do not underestimate these fried wonton wrappers...sounds strange, but you won't even know that they're wonton wrappers while you're eating them. The blue cheese sauce and buffalo sauce on the side is AWESOOOOOOOOOME.  My other fave item is their Godiva brownie sundae. This will be sure to hit the spot if you're craving major sweets.  Let's not forget the complimentary brown and sourdough bread. ME LOOOOOVES!!!  Service was on point. Location is nice, but interior is much smaller than other Cheesecakes I've gone to.  I""ll be back to stuff my face with some more buffalo blasts...after I manage to get a workout aka walk 1 mile."
Empire M.,"Las Vegas, NV",10,10,2,5.0,5/29/2017,Love love love this place... Mike Lopez is the best waiter. We come at least once a day
Marie B.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",24,60,90,4.0,3/5/2017,I would give 5 stars if you didn't have to wait so long to get a waiter or to even order more things. Other than that I can't complain this location has a beautiful outdoor patio view and of course amazing food.
Carolyn M.,"Las Vegas, NV",46,33,25,4.0,4/27/2017,"The food was delicious. I loved the atmosphere, but what I loved most was our server! She was so sweet and courteous. Made sure we had everything we needed and checked on us regularly, not overbearing."
D T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,37,,2.0,11/14/2017,"The hostesses asked if my date and I were okay with a 2 top table. What they failed to mention is that the particular table is so small it can't fit two plates and two menus and we were also next to a 10 person party of screaming women. One lady was scream talking so loud that I was getting a headache. Lara was nice enough to move us to another spot and tried her best, but I could still hear the woman as well as the echos from around the whole restaurant. Ruined my date night. Food was okay, service was okay, but I was not impressed overall. Not really a place for a romantic dinner for two. I don't think I'll be back."
Krista S.,"Las Vegas, NV",214,143,314,3.0,2/18/2017,"I'm not sure how to review this place.  The service my friend and I got was excellent.  The appetizer we had (I can't remember what it was called - veggies breaded with various dipping sauces) was delicious, but they didn't have any eggplant parmesan left (that was the dish I really wanted).  So, I ordered a garlicky pasta dish.  It was tasty, but unfortunately I felt sick all night.  I know it wasn't the appetizer because the friend I dined with had no problems whatsoever.  Perhaps if I'd gotten the meal I wanted, I wouldn't have been sleepless until 5:30 am because I felt like I was going to throw up.  I've never had a bad experience at TCF before, so I'm going to view this as a fluke happenstance.  All the same, I don't intend to dine at this particular locale again."
Triston D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,48,9,5.0,3/31/2017,"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great food, really clean, and really awesome. You may have to wait but it's worth it. And I'm only talking about the food! Now let me talk about the cheesecake. ITS THE BEST. I recommend the Oreo cheesecake and all the other cheesecakes. Also there's a location on the strip if your staying there!"
John V.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",28,32,39,1.0,7/31/2017,Long wait for mediocre food and subpar service a huge menu and when the waitress takes your order they are out of what you want! I will never return to many choices in vegas
Conrad G.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,47,22,4.0,4/4/2017,"Food is good. Waiting service is grand. Did the egg roll sampler today along with the tuna tar tar nice taste small portion. Also had the lettuce wraps which have some proper chicken.  Now the harsh reality about this particular cheesecake compared to outlets or forum, it's too dam busy I mean WTH. The hostess staff is the wildest group of ppl I would definitely manage peoples expectations better if I were in their shoes. If your going to eat here your only options are half an hour before they close or at 2 or 3 pm at any other time of day it's a mess people all over the place just pandamonium"
Marianne J.,"Las Vegas, NV",55,11,,3.0,4/22/2017,"My husband and I love to stop here and get the cheesecake for a special treat. Today, as usual, we stopped, chose our favorites, paid, then headed home to enjoy our special treats. Today something was noticeably different. It seems Cheesecake Factory has caved to cheapness and convenience and switched to compressed air whipped cream. After all, isn't the real, heavy, whipped cream all part of the decadence of purchasing a $7.95 piece of cheesecake?! I am giving the cheesecake dessert and restaurant three stars because I want you to know the importance of REAL WHIPPED CREAM! After all, isn't the dessert the main reason people come here? This is the Rampart location in Summerlin, Las Vegas, Nevada.  My husband and I are so disappointed, that, unless, this ""mistake"" is corrected we will no longer frequent Cheesecake Factory."
Nichole Y.,"Oakland, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Called when they opened requesting reservation for 6...informed that they do not make reservations after 5. Which is fine. Except after 45 mins of waiting we saw a group who came after us be seated with the same amount of people as us. Numerical error I'm sure, but considering it was a birthday celebration they made it less than pleasant. We even asked if they could allow us to sit on the patio, that was a no. Eventually we realized that our business was not appreciated or wanted. Thanks for the waste of time."
Minh N.,"Las Vegas, NV",13,46,16,4.0,7/10/2016,"Who isn't a fan of their cheesecake here ??? Always trying to venture out and trying other flavors but nothing beats the Oreo one at all! Never disappoints!  I live close by this location and always dine at this location more than any other one. Usually is always steady service, they are usually attentive and get what needs to be done. Only problem is that their staff doesn't seem too friendly. Although they do get the job done it would be nice to have a few smiles on deck here! Great food! Great atmosphere and great menu variety! At times I get lost in such a big menu but than again it's nice to come in not knowing what you feel like what you want for dinner or lunch and have the big options they do. Come enjoy the cheesecake it never fails!"
Sheila D.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,72,70,5.0,6/30/2016,"Honestly, their dining foods are so-so.  But all of their cheesecakes are fantastic!  My favorite flavor is fresh strawberry cheesecake!  It is good to having some date with fiance,family dinner,or brunch with my girlfriends"
Maria P.,"Las Vegas, NV",44,10,14,4.0,2/18/2017,"Went there for a slice of cheesecake with my daughter. The place was packed on an early Sunday afternoon. Had to wait for around 20 min to be seated. Our server was Tiffany and she was very attentive and helpful. I had cappuccino and that was excellent. My actual Tiramisu Cake was really good and big enough to share. My daughter Oreo milkshake was good but oh, sooo sweet, she couldn't finish it. She had Dulce De Leche Cheesecake, and that for us tasted ok, but not really impressive. A little overpriced."
AJ S.,"Rockville, MD",2152,194,1075,4.0,8/1/2015,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in like three years, so my roommate and I decided to break the three-year-long hiatus and try it out for dinner once again. We were seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night and having no call-ahead for a table. They had a fancy interior, the dining room was dimly lit (just like all Cheesecake Factories), and the noise level was a little louder than average (it can get quite noisy).  As for the food, we started off with the avocado egg rolls. It may sound weird, but they're actually SO GOOD. Who would've ever thought that this unique twist on egg rolls could be so delicious? It's fried in an egg roll wrap stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  A must-try for avocado aficionados (or for those who are tired of the standard guacamole)! The sauce it came with was sweet; it was the perfect pairing with the egg rolls. Let this appetizer satisfy your tastebuds with its Avocado-ey goodness! My main entree was the Louisiana chicken pasta. It had Parmesan crusted chicken (the breading was crunchy and the chicken was juicy!) over farfalle pasta with a sauce that has a bit of a spicy kick to it. This is seriously some good pasta. If you want something that's super filling, I'd go the pasta route. Presentation of the food could've been a little bit better, but the food was great nonetheless.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was from what I remember. The Cheesecake Factory is probably the best option if you don't want to go anywhere super fancy for dinner."
Laurel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",106,96,299,5.0,11/22/2016,"Second time returning to the infamous cheese cake factory. This location is pretty settle, atmosphere and ambience 10/10. Stopped by for the cheesecakes today. Got three huge slices of cake. There are way to many to choose from. Ordered 3 slices for $26. Well worth the price. Dug right into the cakes, super sweet= HAPPINESS. Always a pleasure !!"
