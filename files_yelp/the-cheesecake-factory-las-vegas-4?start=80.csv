Zohar D.,"Las Vegas, NV",110,17,1,1.0,12/4/2016,The Srvice so poor!!! So sad place like cheese cake factory didn't know what's Costmer service it's mean?!?! Our server Tyler need more training . Me and my family very disappointed.
F C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,55,,5.0,8/9/2017,Despite being extremely packed we were sat down in a clean and ready booth. The food came out surprisingly fast. Way to have a solid team on point! Food was delicious and service was solid.
Tim M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,27,8,1.0,5/8/2016,Just plain bs that this is the quality piece of cake you get for 8.00. The size is inconsistent it's absolutely crazy to me.  I understand it can be busy at times however I'd rather wait a few more minutes to get a better cut piece. When the employee was asked why it was so small she said that's just how it is and shrugged her shoulders. Will not be back. Not to mention the piece was half frozen. If I wanted something frozen I would have gone to the grocery store. Unacceptable.
Jessica B.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,74,29,5.0,11/13/2016,"Why does this place have mediocre ratings?  I love cheesecake. It is one of my favorite restaurants. I will say service is hit or miss, especially depending on how busy it is. BUT majority of the time my food comes in time, my drink doesn't run too low, and my check is closed without too much waiting. Food is consistent. I love their chicken Caesar,  has a nice kick. Their kobe beef burger is so good. 4 cheese or Louisiana pasta. Chicken Madeira, or bang bang chicken is always good. Avocado egg rolls are a good app. And the cheesecake .... love the red velvet, Tiramisu and Chris outrageous. Get the godiva sundae. My husband and I come here once a week. Michael is by far the best server my hubby and I have had!"
Heidi P.,"McMinnville, OR",161,99,149,4.0,4/18/2016,"I love this restaurant...yet another great meal and excellent service...I did take off a star for the price as I do feel as though they are a little to pricey for what they offer...if was $108 for two people for a small steak and steamed vegetables and desert... Also, they were not packed, no waiting and they crammed us in a small two person table right next to another table full of people. I feel like they could have spread us out a bit... But overall very pleased and will definitely return next time I am in town."
Colby L.,"Washington, UT",0,13,7,4.0,3/13/2017,"The food was good. Service a a little slow. Mashed potatoes were cold when they came out. The cheesecake were good as always. Salted Carmel, lemon raspberry, white chocolate raspberry."
Summer B.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,54,64,5.0,3/11/2017,"Normal rush hour you'd think you are going to wait. .Got seated very quickly. The server was very attentive to drink refills, questions, and suggestions. Was very impressed with the food. The lunch prices reasonable. Made for a great day."
Robert M.,"Las Vegas, NV",110,55,7,4.0,8/12/2017,Alfredo fettuccine plus a cheesecake? Is that even legal? Haha well I had both! Always a great time there fast and friendly and the food is always great.  Just thinking about it makes me hungry! Customer service is top notch. And the place a warm and inviting setting. I'll be there back. Thank you!
Edgar V.,"Hesperia, CA",56,26,1,5.0,7/20/2017,"One of the best locations thus far in this part of town ! Came into lunch with my boyfriend , had Kimberly serve us and she was amazing ! The mac and cheese burger is a must try :)."
Erin R.,"Centennial, Las Vegas, NV",51,13,8,5.0,7/29/2017,"I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years (25+) and it never disappoints.  Ever.  I have found my favorites and typically stick to those: Cajun Chicken Littles, Herb Crusted Salmon, Chicken Costoletta, Avocado Eggrolls. The menu is massive and has just about everything.  I also want to mention the sauces and sides are amazing.   The corn succotash, creamy lemon sauce and that Tamarind cashew dipping sauce for the eggrolls are perfection.  The redskin mashed potatoes are so delicious as well.  I want to try everything on the menu but always seem to stick to what I crave.  And let's not forget their cheesecake.  The best.  One of my favorite restaurants for sure!"
Kevin P.,"Las Vegas, NV",303,447,1213,3.0,4/19/2015,"Last visit here I had the Flying Gorilla at the bar while waiting for a table, Flying Gorilla is a chocolate banana liquor shake.  This drink could be too rich for most people but I like it.  At the bar, I ordered the wasabi ahi.  And I'm so glad it was raw red in the center, the last tuna I had was cooked all the way. Other than that, the cheesecakes are stillll good.  I fancy all their cheesecakes and I seriously do not know how you can choose a favorite but if I had to, I'd go with the peanut butter cup fudge cheesecake.  I don't care about breaking out and getting pimples from eating it but come'onnnn, cheesecake with reeses pb cup and butterfingers!"
Ally N.,"Las Vegas, NV",67,202,184,3.0,9/5/2016,"I never thought there would be a day I would be writing a 3 star review on one of my favorite restaurants of all time. We came during the day at around 2:30 to 3 on a Monday. I was surprised that there was a wait time of about 15 minutes. We were seated with our party of 3 at that time.  The bread was delicious and the waitress seemed nice. I got what I always got the chicken fettuccine Alfredo , my 5 year old got the corn dogs and my cousin has ordered the Philly cheesesteak. Everything was going good until waiting for the food. It was literally a good 36 minute wait time for the food and we didn't see the waitress at all during this time. The waiter at the table next to us told his frustrated customers that the kitchen was backed up.  We eventually got our food. It was delicious but I never got my Parmesan cheese. This is one of my favorite parts, it had crossed my mind the maybe they did not do this anymore but the person at the table next to us had been asked and received some. We didn't see our waitress again for a very long time. It was very frustrating because of the time it had taken to receive our food my 5 year old was already restless and I was already ready to order dessert and get the check but took forever for her to arrive.  We had even asked eachother if it would even be worth it to order enough thing because of how much time it was taking for the simple things like asking for a refill or anything it was another 15 minutes  The cheesecake I always receive... The original was drenched with sour cream topping ... It was gross. Normally they have just enough to taste with the whip cream but this thing was covered in it. We took a few bites and left it .  I'm so disappointed because as I did this is my favorite place. One of the best things being the service and food and both things were a disappointment this time ."
Tania S.,"Albuquerque, NM",218,624,1495,4.0,4/21/2015,"Strictly talking food, this Cheesecake Factory gets four stars. On the weekend, parking is hard to find, but it's a pretty awesome location with other new shops and family activities. The experience though, knocked it a star, otherwise it would have been one of my favorite restaurants we checked out this weekend. I ordered a Flying Gorilla beverage to start and it was pretty much my favorite part of a very, very late lunch. Still, we all were able to order from the lunch menu. I had the Avocado Rolls to start, followed by the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everything tasted great, though I'm not a huge fan of the thin, white crispy noodles. I should have asked for them to go easy on that, because there was literally a mountain of it (hence no photo).  Appetizers came out fast, but everything else was weird, honestly. My sister ordered a Piña Colada to start and then a Pepperoni Pizza. I don't think she was a huge fan of the drink, but she said the pizza was pretty much what she hoped for. Even at lunch, the portion was rather large. Leftovers, yo! Only problem is she got her food way before our friend and I. She was almost done by the time I got our food. Our friend ordered Calamari to start, which I would recommend to everyone, because their Calamari is always so good! Lightly fried, crispy bits of octopus makes for a great appetizer and big enough to share! She ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy that as well. So what happened to our bread? You know that thing they usually bring out at the very beginning at every Cheesecake Factory? Apparently they were running behind on a lot of our order, which was surprising for a weekend. Tina our server was as helpful as she could be, despite not being able to get everything out at the same time. The bread didn't even come out until we were ready for the check, so that was kind of annoying.  I would only recommend they staff the kitchen properly on a Saturday, no exceptions. Other than that, I genuinely had a nice time at Cheesecake Factory and am curious to explore more of Summerlin in the future."
Ari S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,14,5,5.0,1/27/2017,"This place is so yummy to not give it a good rating. Well not only that, but Cheesecake Factory's menu is just perfect. Literally has so many variety of items. Want a burger? They got it. Chinese? Got that too. Pasta? You bet so. Not only that, but they have AVOCADO ROLLS. One of the only places I know that has this. Just the best. Then to top it off, you get cheesecake for dessert! Just to finish some of the best dinner options ever, you get TWO pages of types of cheesecakes. LIKE,... WHAT? I think yes!"
SD G.,"San Diego, CA",27,267,1046,4.0,8/14/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory!!  The atmosphere , The ambiance, the food. The dessert , the service etc. I always order  The mojitio  or the Asian pear martini to start off then get the Asian salad or the pepperoni pizza and for dessert the nice and warm apple cobbler. I like Cheesecake Factory off of rampart/ Boca Park and sit outside at night to feel the breeze and watch the traffics go by."
Jeffrey F.,"Las Vegas, NV",56,21,1,5.0,9/9/2016,"Have been here plenty of times but that was before smart phones and Yelp. I've always enjoyed the food and especially the desserts.  This time around i""m with my wife and 4 year old son. After we ordered our drinks we received our complimentary bread. Our server brought out my son his own small bread plate with sliced bananas. Thought that was excellent, never seen that before! We both had separate chicken dishes. They wete ordered and in no time, on a Friday night they were at our table. I'd say they were faster than Jimmy John's. We split with our son and he gobbled it all up. She had the chicken picata an I had the chicken marsala. Both were fantastic.  Now time for dessert. Cheesecake Factory is famous for what? Their Cheesecake!!! Oh my, decision, decision, decision! There is just so much how can 1 person plus a 4 yeat old decide? Seems I'm sharing with my son so he'll decide.  So it's decided, the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. The cake was enormous so we split it amongst us. The only thing i didn't really care for was the whipped cream. It had a blan taste but overall it was fantastic.  Our server was great. He was busy however he went above my expectations. Food was great and served quickly. Our drinks were refreshed even when we didn't ask.  I think 1 thing they could improve on is the lighting. We sat in a part of the restaurant that the overhead lights were high in the ceiling which made it hard to read the menu.  Overall we're beyond satisfied. Especially when we were visited by a cricket"
Amber T.,"Garden Grove, CA",15,11,2,2.0,9/14/2016,"Called for an order for pick up. Ordered buffalo wings no blue cheese with extra ranch, luau salad DRY with extra dressing/sauces on the side (because I know they put additional sauces on the wontons) extra wontons, and Thai lettuce wraps no bean sprouts with extra cucumber. Buffalo wings are super well done/borderline burnt and dry, extra ranch means two small half empty containers of ranch, my luau salad came with sauces on the wonton unlike being dry like I ordered so of course they were soggy by the time we got home, the Thai wraps had 3 shredded/broken lettuce cups which were also drenched in water in the container they were in so they were super wilted... all this for an incredible $50! Money far from being well spent. Super disappointed and I don't know what's happened to cheesecake Factory standards buy they need to get it together."
Brenda T.,"Las Vegas, NV",111,6,,5.0,5/16/2017,"I've been to this location several times and I've always received excellent service but the last time I was here I was seriously impressed! Let me start by saying my lovely husband thought it would be a good idea to take the whole family out for lunch on sunday, mother's day, noon time .... let's just say my expectations for an amazing experience were not very high.  I was definitely proven wrong on my trip here! The waiting area was obviously ridiculously packed so I expected the wait to be nothing less then an hour. Thirty minutes later we were sat and promptly offered bread and had our drink order taken . Our food arrived within 15/20 min after we ordered and let me say it was delicious! Our server Dan was was super great. He checked on us several times , refilled our drinks and asked how our food was . I joked with my husband that this was the day all the cheesecake factory employees had been training for because it doesn't get crazier than mother's day and they nailed it! Thanks again for a great experience!"
Sarah S.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",88,15,3,5.0,5/25/2017,"Great service, fun atmosphere, and such an expansive menu you will easily find something for everyone no matter what you are craving! And somehow they are able to nail every dish, I haven't been disappointed."
Abigail C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",39,13,77,4.0,4/21/2017,"You can never go wrong with whatever you order at any Cheesecake Factory across the country.   The food is always consistently delicious and it's a great place to bring a group of people who may be in the mood for vastly different dishes.  My personal favorites are the mint green tea with simple syrup on the side, the Asian chicken lettuce wraps from the Light Menu, and the Ghirardelli chocolate brownie sundae!"
