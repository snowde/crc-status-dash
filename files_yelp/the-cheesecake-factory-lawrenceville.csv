Steven S.,"East Windsor, NJ",88,102,5,3.0,12/23/2017,"Why (3) stars?  It is The Cheesecake Factory!  Atmosphere + menu + service is what you'd expect at any of there locations. Does this one do anything (compared to their other locations) that stands out?  No! Is there anything ""above and beyond"" their other locations, which would earn it 4 or 5 stars?  No! What they do well is a huge menu, served in a timely manner."
Qwerty U.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,28,42,5.0,10/21/2017,i was a guest to new jersey for a haunted scary farm thing which was a time. unfortunately the lady T the counter of this haunt farm overcharged by $30. we are looking into the redemabds. but now i should be talking about the main attracted of this review.  in the terms of a whites -- GOOD GRavy GOOD MEET GOOD GOD LETS EAT we were very please lot food very taste extremely pleasNt. one of the greatest servers i've ever had ever she was so good and good at upselling ! we spent way more than we intended hahahhahahahahahahhahaahahahahahahhahhaahhahHhahah­ahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahah­ahahahahahahahhahahaha ( i've been trying to start a comedy night and i think i'm going to use this joke for one of my jokes that i will do for my comedy night that will be started momentarily ) i used to feel bad for people who live in new jersey but now there is hope...
Jessica M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",182,127,15,1.0,9/24/2017,"whatever the wait time they tell you, add an extra half hour to an hour. don't come on sunday nights; too busy.  manager is not manager material. after they tried to squish our party of 5 into a 4-person booth and we asked to be switched, the manager had to come help. he did not help. we could have easily gotten angry, but all I said was, ""fine, we'll take the table today, but you guys need to fix something in the way you prioritize seating from now on."" and he snapped, ""yeah, i don't see what we have to fix."" let me retail-splain this to you then sir: 4 person parties fit in a 4 person table. 5 person parties fit in a 6 person table. if 5 people get there before a 6 person party the 5 person party SITS FIRST.  ... and get a better 'tude dude. they ran out of wheat bread. they ran out of white rice. the hostesses rolled their eyes at us. 4 meals arrived 10 mins before the 5th so 4 of us had to wait in awkward silence for the 5th.  you wanted to know what you needed to fix, mr. manager. get moving."
Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1492,416,2186,4.0,6/10/2017,"So I'm between a 3-4 stars. Just because it's a chain restaurant ... I think I gave it 4 stars cause the outside patio is cuter than other places I've been to.  And we had a good waiter/service  Tried a different cocktail. The passion fruit margarita ( I know it came in a martini glass lol) but it was ok/good and it made me tipsy! Perfect for after a work related class lol. A nap was easy later lol.  I also tried something new for a meal this time. I usually like the bang bang chicken and shrimp, or miso salmon or tuna takaki salad but there was a special I tried called Thai- coconut lime chicken which was really good! My friend had the Baja Tacos which she says is her usual fave.  Maybe it was because we didn't have breakfast or lunch until this meal but we almost finished our plates. I know . Downed like 1000 calories . Maybe it was the combo off  the good food, the tequila, feeling ravenous.  I would come back again ... if I want Cheesecake Factory and in the area."
Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",841,237,1388,3.0,9/22/2017,"This is a solid 3 stars.  It's a chain restaurant, so I think the quality of the food is slightly superior than it would be if it were independently run/operated.  However, this definitely is only doing well because of it's name/location - I probably would not choose to come back to this location.   Let's start with reservations.  I had called around 11am when they opened that day, and made a reservation for lunch.  We were going in a big group (7 of us) and it was a Professional Development Day for most school districts in the area, so we knew it was going to be packed and wanted to plan ahead.  We showed up, and the staff had no idea about our reservation, they seemed completely overwhelmed and unprepared to handle what appeared to be a fairly typical (albeit, on a Thursday) lunch rush.  After about 20 minutes, no clear direction about waiting or a time element, we were seated outside at our table.   The server forgot multiple things we asked for at the beginning of the meal (straws, lemons) but they were brought out before the actual meal, so not a big deal.   I had ordered a salad, and the ranch dressing was delivered to the table with the iced teas/coffee.  Our food didn't arrive for about another 10 minutes (conservative estimate) and I was pretty unhappy that the Ranch dressing had been sitting outside for so long - but I ate it without complaints.  The salad itself is standard and yummy (and too big, for the official record) so no complaints there.  However, our waiter never returned to check to see if everything was okay (it wasn't), or if we needed something else (we did).  My friend ordered a Chop salad, or so she thought.  Only after stalking the menu extensively, I figured out they gave her an appetizer salad rather than the Skinnylicious Chop salad she was ordering.  She asked the waiter at one point ""is this the right size"" to which a prompt ""yes it is"" before walking away. It was pretty difficult to get a hold of our waiter for things like more water (never delivered), straws, or the check (eventually).  I think as a business, better training could be implemented to equip the staff to handle lunch-hour better.   Everyone seemed pretty pleased with their food, aside the tiny chop salad, that is."
D M.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",14,13,30,4.0,8/24/2017,Last time I was at CF to get cheesecake I was waiting in line.  The cheesecake slices were sitting on the counter for the waiters.  About 5-6 waiters were reaching over the food and some were touching the slices with their sleeves!!! It looked horrible   Also the workers cutting the slices were yapping and spit was coming out of their mouths!!!  I haven't been back there since!!! Maybe they should cover the cheesecake slices when they are sitting on the 'table' waiting for the wait staff to p/u??!!!
Leah B.,"San Francisco, CA",21,23,,5.0,12/31/2017,This place is great. Perfect place to decompress after shopping at the Quakerbridge Mall. Their steak medallions with mushrooms is amazing and of course you can't go wrong with their cheesecakes. Servers tend to be very friendly to boot!
Megan O.,"Highland Park, NJ",0,2,1,4.0,1/5/2018,"Delicious food. I love this restaurant. Free hot bread, fish tacos were great. Oreo's shake and cheesecake are my favorites, they just can't go wrong. Looking forward to coming back again!"
Amina R.,"Trenton, NJ",2,13,3,3.0,1/4/2018,"Food is great, service could be better. I somehow manage to end up with the same server each time and he either forgets our orders, mixes them up, and then takes forever to correct them. The manager had to intervene last time and help out bc it took us 40 mins to get our check."
Armiyela T.,"South Plainfield, NJ",1,31,115,4.0,11/1/2017,"My experience in this particular restaurant was amazing! Our waitress Emily was very attentive to our needs. Our party consisted of 3 kids and 8 adults. All the food we ordered were good and perfectly cooked. I ordered the shrimp scampi and the steak diane and it was so yummy! Steak was perfectly cooked (medium well) and shrimp was tasty.  I have been to another cheesecake factory and their steak was really not cooked to my liking and was a little hard and the server were not so attentive to our needs. I took off a star because our food took a little too long to come out but I am willing to come back to this location if I'm in the area.  Ohhh and of course, you can't go wrong on the cheesecakes! I had the coffee and cream chocolate supreme, was absolutely delicious! Too bad i forgot to take a pic of my food! I was so hungry lol"
Dan M.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",66,317,549,4.0,5/10/2017,"I can only comment on the lemon meringue cheesecake slice I had the pleasure to try.  I was afraid it could possibly be too sweet, but that was not the case at all.  The meringue was tasty and had plenty of lemon flavoring incorporated.  There was a nice balance of the cheesecake portion and the lemon meringue part.   It was very heavy as well.   Will I go back?  I did not attend, but I would go for some additional cheesecake."
Danielle J.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",0,9,,2.0,11/8/2017,"I used to love this Cheesecake Factory location- but no more. The past 3 times I have been, have been horrible. The amount of time we have sat at the table waiting for our food was insane. Today, my brother and I sat down for happy hour at 4 and ordered pretty much right away. We did not receive our food until around 4:40, and two tables around us who were seated after us got their food before we did. We only ordered 4 appetizers and only 2 came out and then the other 2 after that. I have no clue what their issue is, but I always am sitting and waiting for what feels like eternity waiting for my food. What took about an hour in total should have taken 35-40 minutes. Even when the food came out, it was not even as hot as it should be, more like lukewarm. I have given this location too many chances and for sure will not be returning to this location anytime soon."
MochiTruffle P.,"New York, NY",0,17,14,4.0,8/12/2017,Friendly customer service and good food (most of the times). I've been dining at this location often for the last 8 years and I always feel welcome. I'm only giving four stars because they have recently changed veggie burger recipe and I do not like it at all. They should change its name to rice patty burger instead.
Steve R.,"Woodmont Triangle, Bethesda, MD",9,60,95,3.0,10/1/2017,"Came by for Sunday dinner.  Sat outside on the patio, which had a nice vibe.  The patio heaters were on and music was played in the background.  We ordered the fried cajun catfish, chicken nachos and chicken salad sandwich.  Topped it off w/ tropical ice tea.  The food was ok, but was a wee bit underwhelming.  The staff was courteous and professional."
CJ L.,"Burlington, NJ",24,115,94,5.0,9/26/2016,"Went here today with my wife for happy hour. Had not been to cheesecake in several years and I never realized they had a happy hour until I searched on my phone randomly. Went here for the 4-6 happy hour in the bar area where seating is plentiful. Went straight to the bar and was greeted by the bartender Tyler would was ever so friendly and kind. To get straight to the point, he was attentive throughout without any issues. I ordered the southern friend chicken sliders (delicious), the sweet corn tamale cakes (were okay) and the crab dip (delicious). The best thing about the happy hour were the drinks. I ordered two long islands while there and I must say they were some of the best tasting long islands I have ever had. This is coming from someone who ONLY drinks LITs when going out so I've had my fair share. They were not only tasty and had the approx. amount of ingredients, but they were great to drink. I would definitely recommend anyone to come here for a drink and a bite to eat. Everything on the happy hour menu is $5.95 so you can't lose."
Leena S.,"Princeton, NJ",168,363,1238,3.0,7/28/2016,"A friend and I met up at the air conditioned mall today to catch up and and just get out of this heat.  Our options at the mall for lunch were either Brio Tuscan Grill or Cheesecake Factory.  I wasn't much in the mood for Italian, so Cheesecake factory was the winner. The food was just average, as expected, from a chain restaurant. I ordered the spicy chicken tacos which were on the skinnylicious menu. In my opinion, the tacos were not spicy at all. But, my barometer for spiciness is higher than most.  The tacos were served along with a escabeche salad.  I didn't know what that was when I ordered it; I should have asked.  As it turned out, it was a pickled salad. However the only thing pickled about the salad was the heavy amount of pickled cucumbers; they were basically pickles for all intentional purposes. I didn't really understand the combination of this pickled salad along with my soft tacos. It was not a good pairing of food.  I should have substituted a small side salad, had I known what escabeche meant. For my $14 bucks, I would have been much happier with tacos from Chipotle at half the price.  PROS: extensive menu, all kinds of food options, dessert lovers heaven with the abundant amount of cheesecake choices. (Although I did not try the cheesecake.  But, one would expect, it's gotta be good with a name like the Cheesecake Factory.) CONS: average food that is over priced"
Pat B.,"Morristown, NJ",86,63,18,4.0,11/6/2016,"Came here with 12 people, the service couldn't have been better. The caliber of the wait staff and the attention our table received was a topic of conversation, if that's not a testament enough. First time having a burger here, Americana with Cheese, and it was delicious. Made just as I ordered it. The cheesecake was also delicious, but that's an obvious review. Only complaint, this place didn't take reservations so we waited an hour before being sat. Which should be expected considering we have 12 people on a Friday night."
Jessica O.,"Morristown, NJ",96,207,32,4.0,11/11/2016,"We came here with a large group on a Saturday night. Unfortunately this place does not accept reservations even with a party of 12. Despite the hour wait we were able to enjoy a nice meal and top of the line service. When our waiter was not around the staff was more than willing to help out by filling our drinks and being of service. Five stars for the service! As with all cheesecake factories the menu is endless from the classic Mac and Cheese burger, to shrimp pasta to Teriyaki Salmon you can get whatever your stomach desires. As a result of the endless options the food is ok and I'd give it 3 stars. Save room for the cheesecake as its out of this world!!!"
Brittany M.,"Kendall Park, NJ",2,12,38,3.0,10/28/2016,"Update: We decided to give to go a try again after awhile hoping they fixed the errors but our order was incorrect again. Just putting a little more pride in how you treat the customers would be good.  While as a whole I enjoy Cheesecake Factory, for the second time curbside ordering to go has gone wrong for us.  My Miso Salmon was burnt and the portion not the same as when I eat in. The same went for our Meatloaf order too. Also, our order of fudge cake ended up being carrot cake for some reason.  Although they were disappointing for the second time in the to go department I will say that when I called back to let them know they did reimburse us for the parts of the order that was messed up. I'm hoping that they will do better for their to go customers and not take advantage of their trust because not everyone checks their order (like my husband) before leaving. Once would be one thing but for a second time I think they need to make some improvements."
Ambrose L.,"Trenton, NJ",104,14,7,3.0,5/15/2017,It's pretty good food here. Service is okay. About what you should expect from a big chain like this.  The Nashville chicken nuggets were tasty. I also got the Pasta Napoletano. Wifey got the tuna and said she really liked it.  The passion fruit mojito was yummy but very overpriced.
Kolee C.,"Alpharetta, GA",32,82,140,5.0,5/5/2016,"I am a fan of brunch, dinner, and snack time.   Bruch with the girls has become a regular event.  Bloody Mary and brunch is a great way to wind down the weekend!  The service is always great, the waiters very attentive and the bartender chatty but not intrusive. The menu is quite overwhelming, but good conversation topic!  The lunch menu is great, you can reasonably sized portion of pizza and salad or even turkey sandwich.  Both of which are yummy!  Snacks like flatbread and zucchini sticks are delish!  The rancho huevos are so good and surprisingly light!  That's just a few of the things on the menu I tried, but I'm sure the waiter/waitress can help find what you want :)"
Janet S.,"Trenton, NJ",0,12,2,1.0,3/19/2017,We arrived on the Tuesday evening after New Years. The restaurant was empty. My husband used the men's room . He came back & said the restroom was disgustingly dirty. Manure & urine overflowing in the urinals. He went to the front desk & told them . I wanted to leave . He insisted that we stay. The service was excellent but my shrimp was overdone . Before we left my husband & I visited the restrooms. The ladies room did not have any toilet paper & my husband said no one cleaned the mess in the men's room . Sad end to our evening out . Having second thoughts on visiting this restaurant again.  Update ! We were contacted by the restaurant's manager . I do not think we shall see conditions in the restrooms like this again .  Update 3/19/17 We visited this restaurant today. We had the best lunch . Our waiter Christopher was very friendly & efficient . Our food was delicious . The restaurant was very busy but everyone seemed organized. Lastly the restrooms were clean . Glad to see this !
Ross B.,"Newtown, PA",87,70,6,1.0,1/19/2017,"The food was average. But the wait staff was terrible. My mom ordered a salad. It took five requests for dressing. When I sent my teenaged son to ask for the manager he was told to go sit back down.  For the first time ever, I considered leaving to tip.  It was that bad."
Sudarshan S.,"Washington, DC",0,8,,3.0,8/16/2017,"Great ambience.  Food is good, can't say out of the world but the ambience and service makes it memorable.  Yeah, it is pricey. Can't go wrong with their cakes."
Elizabeth G.,"Hartford, CT",69,3,,2.0,8/19/2017,"From the moment we arrived, I should of known it was going to be bad. We walked in and there was no one waiting to be seated. The hostess is looking at us but not acknowledging us for a good 5 minutes. Then we get taken to our table and NO LIE- 15 minutes pass before someone even comes over. My husband had to ask for someone. The waitress finally comes over and says she wasn't aware of that she was taken care of our table. The food was good and the waitress was quick once we actually was given one."
Devangi S.,"Northeast Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA",0,9,34,4.0,11/24/2017,Easy and quick location to go to after picking up guest from the trenton airport. Delicious food. Service was fine but for a table of 8 the server should automatically know how much bread and butter to get. We had to ask her to get more . We wanted to change our small plates after appetizer as they had got messy she returned back only with 4 plates for a table of 8. So I mean it got a bit irritating but the food was good so we were fine
Tye W.,"Hilliard, OH",4,21,19,4.0,4/26/2017,"The restaurant is decent but not the best franchise location. The service can be slow but still very nice. The slices of cheesecake seem smaller than other locations. The food was excellent, so that somewhat made up for the longer wait times."
Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1009,2186,6388,4.0,5/29/2016,"Think of The Cheesecake Factory empire as high end diners, with broad menu options and signature desserts, and you will be prepared for their reality.   The physical plant is always palatial, with high ceilings, chandelier lighting, and marble floors.  There is always a wait for seating, which reflects both their popularity and a marketing strategy to have everyone stand in front of the refrigeration display of cheesecakes sufficient to make you swoon from sweet caloric excess anticipation.  Visiting with friends from Asia, it was one of their first impressions of America.  So much food.  So little time. We were seated toward the rear of the house after a 20 minute wait.  Our servers were friendly, knowledgeable, and seemed to genuinely enjoy our interaction.  We ordered a few drinks, which while expensive, were pretty good.  My friends went with the Spicy Crispy Chicken, and Beef Dip Sandwiches, and after inquiring about the meatloaf, I was convinced to try it.   The platters arrived within 20 minutes on this Friday eve, and were visually beautiful.  Both sandys had a metal cuff load of fries on the side, and small cups of sauce for application to whatever suited the fancy.  My overload one pound of well tuned Meatloaf was the star of the show, however.  The sides of Mashed with a small pond of gravy in its midst, and Sweet Corn Succotash, bracketed the meat with its own blanket of brown sauce and sautéed Onions.  I happily handed off a slice of the main attraction to each of my companions, and still had more than I could handle.  I scooped the lightly cooked veggies on top of the taters and mixed them together (an old scouting trick).  The sandwiches were enjoyed, but I watched as eyes widened in surprise as the meatloaf and mash mix were sampled for the first time.  It was a wordless exclamation, that was followed by repeated uninvited spooning into my potato stash, and excited acceptance of more meatloaf sharing.  As one companion gushed, ""Now I know what American food is! I love it."" Ironically, the cheesecake (Lemon Raspberry), while good, was not the ""take away"" from this night.  In truth, Juniors is far superior.  No. this night belonged to the oft overlooked orphan, meatloaf.   Yah never know when great memories will be made."
A M.,"Ship Bottom, NJ",40,131,1,3.0,8/10/2017,"Today we went to Cheesecake Factory for lunch. Food is pretty good and service fairly consistent but here is my issue: it is so crowded and servers are so overwhelmed that there are runners to deliver food. Today our food was delivered to the wrong table. The people at the other table didn't say anything so we wound up having to wait at least 15 minutes for them to remake our food. Our server apologized but had he delivered our food in the first place it would not have been an issue. We go there quite a bit. But there are too many other places in the area to waste my time here. Don't overwhelm your servers, put sweetener on the table so I don't have to ask for it. And don't push cheesecake on me when I'm done."
Angela P.,"Atlanta, GA",203,7,2,2.0,8/17/2017,"The food was so heavy and I felt terrible, but it's the cheesecake factory so I expected this. The cheesecake was the best part of the meal (fresh strawberry) but even then my soul felt empty. The service was okay. My group didn't get a single water refill during the entire meal, and my father didn't get the coffee he ordered. The waiter was very very nice tho."
Mario C.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",5,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,"So disappointed in that place, worst experience I've had in a long time, no service, the food sucked and no management whatsoever, last time I ever step a foot in this branch."
Zulq M.,"Morrisville, PA",0,9,2,1.0,9/29/2017,"We went for my sister's birthday dinner. There was 6 of us. We do not eat meat and stressed that to the waiter yet after a 30-40 minute wait, there was chicken in our meals. Also, we had to remind the staff for a cake so we could cut it for her birthday. Even after all that, the manager did not even bother to apologize, or come speak with us to find out what happened. We were barely given any service the whole time, and then at the end we were not given our card back after we paid around $200! I am not too picky, but expect normal service from any restaurant and was very disappointed with cheesecake factory and will not be back. I see why this place is not as busy anymore as it use to be."
Anne W.,"Little Egg Harbor Township, NJ",23,33,,2.0,4/7/2017,"I was not impressed at all! Their food was only so so and very expensive for what you get! We were also disappointed in the cheesecake, we had heard good things about it, but again, high in price and nothing special!"
Pete W.,"Titusville, NJ",95,41,81,1.0,4/23/2017,"I and two friends went to dinner on 4/23/17. We were seated quickly even though the restaurant was rather busy, although I've seen it busier. We were greeted quickly by our waitress who took our drink order, then we took our time looking over the menu.  We decided on 3 entrees, a chicken dinner, steak Diane, and tuna. 30 minutes later (a bit long for Cheesecake Factory) a gentleman approached our table. He never introduced himself, but he began to apologize over and over for the wait, then informed us that the tuna could not be served. As he was telling us this, our other 2 entrees arrived at the table. The gentleman offered to bring our third party a cessar salad while she decided on another entree. By the time the salad arrived she ordered a chicken dinner.  Tick tock, tick tock... another 30 minutes passed and I flag down our waitress, she apologized again and said it would be 2 more minutes. By this time my guest decided she no longer wanted the entree and asked the waitress to cancel the order. A few minutes later a runner brought the chicken to our table, which we sent back.  Finally, the waitress brings the chicken back wrapped to go. She explained that we would not be charged for that meal and that we could take it with us. She then brings a check for the other two meals!  I never saw any manager again. I asked our waitress to explain to the manager that our experience was so bad that the entire check should be comped and she agreed, but never made any effort to get that done. I was so disappointed with my experience  tonight that I will NOT return to Cheesecake Factory."
Don W.,"Trenton, NJ",42,7,,5.0,7/19/2017,"I've been meaning to review this restaurant since the day I went there.  This is a wonderful place.  I started with the TexMex egg rolls and they were excellent.  The Cuban sandwich was off the scale good.  It was huge to start with, served hot to perfection.  I went there alone, which can be a recipe for trouble if you're a blind customer which I am.  I was delighted to find they had a Braille menu.  When I ordered the appetizer I asked the server to give me some time to enjoy it, and not to bring the sandwich while I was eating the appetizer.  This was one server who listened well.  I got a nice amount of time to enjoy my egg rolls before the sandwich came.  In future I mean to forego the appetizer so I can have the sandwich and leave room for the cheesecake."
Janice L.,"Roselle Park, NJ",607,884,123,3.0,2/17/2016,"The food definitely was good, as expected from Cheesecake Factory.  Service was a little meh as the waiter we had was relatively new. Therefore, it took a while to get food, then to get our check etc. I ended up just getting my cheesecake at the counter to go. Also, the bathroom stalls had a few broken locks. Should really fix that eek!"
David R.,"Ocean Gate, NJ",0,5,,1.0,4/20/2017,"I love Cheesecake factory but after a horrible experience at this one i will not be returning to this location. Waiter has an attitude, and also did not have professional waiter manors. Manager did not fulfill duties to solve an issue, no apology was given for the MULTIPLE mistakes made that night."
Adele P.,"Hopewell Township, NJ",3,2,,2.0,12/5/2017,"my husband and i love cheesecake factory, but we went monday for lunch and it was not good. met a developer friend of ours from philly, i figure it would be ok. it was horrible. i ordered herbed salmon with your lemon sauce, mashed potatoes,asparagus .  the salmon was burned not moist like i remembered. lunch portions are tiny, not medium for our guest it looked like a shrimp and pasta dish for a small child. wait staff was trying so hard to please us but you tell the kitchen was not cooperating. what the hell is going on over there. the one in bridgewater is good and all the ones in florida are excellent.  wake up and get a good team in place."
Marlyn V.,"Morrisville, PA",935,680,873,4.0,1/21/2015,"This is a review for the Happy Hour. I really would love to understand the hype behind the cheesecake factory and the need for a 2 hour wait for dinner, I for one HATE waiting, so instead I come here for happy hour. The happy hour is one of the best in the area with great prices on a selection of appetizers at $5 on average and 4 signature drinks at the same price including skinnylicious ones for those of us trying to get the most out of our tequila.  What to order: What I most enjoy on their menu (aka most bang for your buck) is the Southern Chicken Sliders - they are really delicious and served with some great side sauces.  And my all time cheesecake factory favorite are the avocado egg rolls. Yes they are super greasey, yes you can only have them once a year, but omg.....when you take that first crispy bite of butter avocado and tangy sauce....triple bypass surgery heaven. As for drinks the pink lemonade is a good choice for those who also like drinks like mai tides or cosmos...super sweet. I prefer the mojito, that's lighter. Sadly all of the savory wonderfulness can only be enjoyed from the absurdly early happy hour time of 4-6 pm. Therefore, I rarely get to come unless I have a day off, but maybe you are a loaded stay at home mom with a nanny who just hit another jackpot by learning about this happy hour.    Oh and by all means...ALWAYS....get a slice of cheesecake to go."
Victoria B.,"Mountainside, NJ",760,95,415,5.0,1/9/2016,"Went for lunch after long shopping day. Got a glass of Pinot Grigio and guacamole appetizer. Guacamole is fresh and made to order, large portion and great for sharing. My favorite is the blue cheese olive dirty martini ... But it was a little early so I stuck to wine this time! Great service and fun atmosphere. I prefer sitting at the high top tables by the bar."
