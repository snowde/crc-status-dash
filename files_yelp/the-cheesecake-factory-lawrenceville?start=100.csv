Holly S.,"Lawrence, NJ",0,11,,5.0,6/29/2016,Been to Cheesecake Factory three times and each time was wonderful. Their food/drinks are always great and so is the desserts.Our waiters/waitresses are always very polite and professional. Cant wait to go back.
C. H.,"Telford, PA",0,18,50,2.0,6/24/2014,We ordered our food and ew there was a hair in my husbands salad! Gross it made us loose our appetite.  When we were leaving I almost slipped on the floor it was so slippery I don't know if something was spilled and not cleaned up properly or too much product on the floor.
Tray S.,"Las Vegas, NV",222,5,2,1.0,9/20/2014,"A pasta dish sent me in an ambulance to the hospital after I asked the waiter if the dish had nuts and he told me it did not. The recipe may not have, but my dish did and I know that they were busy but that does not excuse mishandling of food and cross contamination.  I waited for that table for 2 hours when they gave us an estimate of 1. And after the episode of me rushing away in an ambulance, my friends were still charged for their dinners, full price, and MY DRINK. Really?? So greedy.  I'm never going back. I'm astounded at the negligence of your employees from the moment I walked in the door. At least the managers were nice to me after they found out they had to call 911."
Ivan M.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,12,,3.0,9/10/2015,"Their food is awesome. The service is usually good.  But I have to remove 2 stars right off the top because this place doesn't take reservations.  I'm sorry, maybe it's going overboard that I won't eat at establishments that do this, but I find it extremely pretentious that some restaurant owners/corporations feel like they command enough interest that they don't need your business in advance.  Well I say good luck to you then Cheesecake Factory. Every time a friend suggests we go here I exhaust all other options first.  Do I enjoy eating here? Usually.  However, I'd much rather go visit my boys over at KC Prime on quaker bridge road.  They respect a customer who is loyal to them, and quite frankly they're better."
Shirley Y.,"Hayward, CA",80,138,62,1.0,7/25/2015,"Went for lunch late Sunday with my family and  I ordered pasta. It was busy so the service was slow, food didn't come together and I got mines late. When it finally came, my pasta was undercook. It took forever to flag someone and by the time my waiter came, my family was done with the food. They asked if I wanted a new pasta and I declined because we were in a rush and it took forever to get any service, let alone another entree. The server stared at me confused took the pasta and walked off. Did not apologized or offer to take my pasta off the bill. Left the restaurant hungry. Worst Cheesecake Factory I ever been to. Never going again."
Kari A.,"Princeton, NJ",602,7,1,1.0,11/23/2013,Not impressed AT ALL.  Been to many Cheesecake Factory's all over the U.S. and this was by far my worst experience.  So much so I am leaving this review when I never do these things.  Wait was at least 25 minutes MORE than they said it would be and service and food were terrible.  They were out of basic Buffalo Wings which upset my son who was so looking forward to them.  Table wasn't ready once we were actually called and we literally had to wait an additional 10 more minutes to sit down.  I live close but will never venture here again. This place proved that expansion of a good chain is never worth it.  Yuck.
Kimberly L.,"Trenton, NJ",0,15,,2.0,5/8/2015,The service was horrible. The wait wasn't too bad and the food was only okay. Sure the atmosphere is nice but everything wasn't great. I had to ask for a steak knife. And the server first gave me a empty bottle of steak sauce. The next one was watered down. And the prices are way too pricy. Don't go it isn't worth it.
Aleks K.,"Charlotte, NC",134,518,1047,5.0,4/23/2014,"What are all these bad reviews about?? I have been here twice in the last week and I had two great experiences. First time I sat in the bar area and my waitress, Lori, was so nice we spoke to management to let them know. The second time I sat at a table and had no issues whatsoever. Both times food came out at reasonable times, bread was given, places were set neatly. This restaurant is on par with several other CF I've been to. I had the Asian lettuce tacos and the BBQ chicken salad, both exactly like I'm used to. The cocktails are expensive at around $11 a piece but strong and tasty. Both the pineapple mimosa and maitai were dressed with beautiful garnishes. The carrot cake cheesecake was sweet and good to split but I would skip the macadamia one because it was too sweet and sticky. Even that was my fault, I should know that caramelized nuts plus white chocolate plus cheesecake is going to be too sweet. Give this place a break!"
Lana L.,"Hightstown, NJ",147,230,422,4.0,1/2/2014,"If you're on a diet, I'd say avoid this place. The food is for the most part, pretty good, but I think it's cuz their not so secret ingredient is butter. Came here at about 9pm on New Year's Eve and was surprised and relieved there was no wait time. Wait times often range from an hour to 90 minutes. Our waiter was friendly and made sure our glassses were filled. Here are some of the dishes I've had: Chicken Bellagio- nicely breaded chicken placed on top of garlic noodles with pesto. Very good. Bistro Shrimp Pasta- creamy noodles with arugula, mushroom, basil and shrimp, tasty. Pasta Da Vince- TOO SWEET... not a fan. Gumbo- has a nice kick to it, served with rice.  Buffalo Chicken Blasts- crispy cruchy buffalo flavored breaded chicken, good but a little oily. Served with hot sauce and blue cheese."
Jess J.,"Hightstown, NJ",7,16,1,4.0,7/25/2015,"Went around dinner time on a Tuesday, and it was decently busy so we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before being seated. I would say that it was a fair waiting time. The waiter, whose name I believe was Jim was very pleasant and attentive. The food and drinks all arrived at a timely matter. The menu includes a good variety in food and in prices. Overall I have absolutely no complaints about my first experience at The Cheesecake Factory, and I would definitely recommend this place."
Jonathon A.,"Queens, NY",55,118,263,1.0,4/28/2015,I assume you take pride in hiring inefficient staff or those who just don't care to take into count details?!? Worst experience... Left my office for my hr. Lunch drove 15mins to this place for lunch drove back to work to eat my lunch to find my take out had no utensils!!!! Are you kidding me! Totally pissed off!! It's one thing if your food was free but when people pay good money for for food services you need to deliver 101% I ended up wasting my lunch to have to head out to the supermarket to get spoon and fork because there was none at my office. Perhaps retrain KEVIN on how to do his job the right way and ensure everything is in the bag
Dipti D.,"Flemington, NJ",0,5,,2.0,9/30/2014,Great food but the initial interaction with the hostess KILLS the mood to eat.  She needs to learn to smile and to greet and teat customers.
Helen C.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,6,1,2.0,10/5/2014,"I usually love to go to the cheesecake factory but the restaurant at this location is not worth it. The portions are small.  I ordered Pasta Da Vinci and only had 3 pieces of chicken, a couple pieces of mushroom, and tons of pasta.  I also ordered Shrimp Scampi to go and the portion was so small, I complained that this should be an appetizer! To make matters worse, they drenched the shrimp in the sauce so of course I would have soggy shrimp. I was very disappointed with the quality of food at this location. The ambience at the patio is perfect for a summer/fall night as they have fire radiators."
Dee H.,"Monmouth Junction, NJ",0,5,,3.0,7/11/2015,The hostess was not very friendly. It wouldn't hurt to look at someone and say please/thank you.  The egg rolls were very good. As was the spinach dip.  I ordered the fried shrimp. I asked for Mac and cheese to replace fries. Of course I had to pay. I received both. The fries were cold. The Mac and cheese was undercooked. The shrimp were hard and almost burnt.  The Louisiana pasta was tasty but greasy.  I ordered cheesecake to go. Not impressed.  This restaurant is too expensive for subpar food. And $13 for a martini! In a mini glass!  Outrageous!  The saving grace was our amazing waiter.  Maybe Cheesecake factory has run it's course.
Karen W.,"Ottawa, OH",4,170,17,3.0,6/6/2013,"I stopped by here for a late lunch, so the place was not packed. I was seated after only a couple minutes. I had a little wait until my server came to get my order, but I was not in a hurry.  I ordered the skinnylicious chicken enchiladas.  My server did ask if I wanted the bread basket, which I passed on. I also had iced tea, which my server made sure I did not get low on. The enchilada was good, topped with cilantro (my favorite herb) but it did not have a traditional Mexican taste. It was more tomato-y, and spiced more Italian tasting. Not that these things are bad, just unexpected. The vegetables were cold, like a salad, and light and tasty. I did have to wait to get my plate cleared up and request the check. But then the server was quick on the pickup and thanked me for stopping in."
Nancy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,64,35,1.0,3/7/2013,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory in Lawrenceville (Usually I go to Menlo Park or Bridgewater). I am surprised by the horrible experience I had here. The food was fine, but the service was unbelievably disappointing.  Our server did not bring us bread, and did not take our order for over 10 minutes. As a server myself, I would understand if she was just busy, but she walked past the table 5-6 times before coming over to take the order. No eye contact - nothing. She brought my friend the wrong salad, and for dessert we had to stir our coffee with straws because she took away our spoons. I can't believe how someone can screw up so many times throughout one meal! Maybe she knew she messed up because she didn't charge us for our coffees. Because of this poor first impression I will NEVER be visiting this Cheesecake Factory again..."
Emily S.,"Titusville, NJ",0,6,,4.0,3/22/2015,"Went here for lunch on Sunday at a very busy time, but the service was phenomenal. The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and our food came quickly. Food was delicious- we ordered the thai lettuce wraps and the chicken potstickers off of the skinnylicious menu. I will definitely be returning!"
Jennifer V.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",9,22,16,4.0,2/14/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. Used to drive to either freehold or Menlo park so glad there is a local one that is closer. It gets very busy here. They have a beeper system, but expect to wait 45 minutes on a busy Friday or Saturday night. That said, the pagers work quite a distance away and we usually head into the mall to browse stores while we wait for our table.  It's usually quicker than they say it will be when the beeper goes off.  Although it's a packed restaurant and clearly lots of frenetic energy, we have always had good service. The food is good  lots of choices on the biggest menu I have ever seen. Love the advocado wraps for appetizer and passion fruit mohitos are my favorite. Also always get slice of cheesecake to go because I never have room for it at the table. They also have takeout with close to the door parking for pickup."
Sun K.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,1,,1.0,10/29/2014,"We are a frequent to this restaurant. However the last time, the waitress was not so friendly. We thought she perhaps had a bad day. This time the waiter was not only rude, we told him 3 times we were all vegetarian. He even said ""ya ya you told me 2 times already"". Then he got us the burrito with chicken. He was not even bothered and ignored us the rest of the meal. He came back later and said "" we have vegetarian dessert!!!"". We didn't get a replacement meal with what we asked for either. When he showed up with the check ""well, it happens every now and then"" he said.  Really disappointing service. I won't go back for sure."
Kim G.,"Yardley, PA",37,33,2,2.0,5/24/2014,"Meh. Highly overrated, incredibly slow service and rude management. Food isn't anything great for what they charge.. I'd rather eat somewhere else and grab a piece of cheesecake to go, cause for the most part the cheesecake is pretty good."
