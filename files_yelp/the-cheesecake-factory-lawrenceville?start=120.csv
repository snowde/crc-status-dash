Hihihi h.,"ASTORIA, NY",0,24,,1.0,3/30/2014,"The service is by far the WORST.  Imagine every privileged little college snob working in one location; it's the Quakerbridge Mall Cheesecake Factory!  We have been there a few times now after moving to the area, and every time the service is extremely slow (5-10 minutes to get a drink order [no exaggeration], there is always the check from the last table sitting on our table still).  Last time we went, our waitress kept COMPLAINING about all of the things management makes the servers do (ie, grate parmesan cheese).  It was super awkward and made us feel weird asking her to do anything she didn't volunteer to do. My  main complaint was from how a hostess treated us.  My boyfriend and I both heard the one who took our name say there was a ""fifteen minute wait"", after a half hour of waiting I went to go ask how much longer for a table.  There was a different hostess at the computer when I went up, so I asked ""I just wanted to see how much longer for our table?"" when she without saying anything, reaches across the stand and GRABS the buzzer out of my hand and looks it up and goes ""20-25 minutes longer."" Since I thought it was a 15 minute wait, I said ""But we've been waiting a half hour already"" and she goes ""I can see that."" (?!!??!) So I said 'Well I was told it was a 15 minute wait"" to which she snaps back ""FIFTY. FIFTY MINUTES. FIVE ZERO. NOT fifteen""  And with that, we simply turned around and walk out and will not be returning.  I was not rude, obnoxious, or heated in any way shape or form to this hostess, and regardless if I was that's not how you treat a customer.  It goes without saying the food is overpriced but I have no desire to give this place 4th and 5th chances and still be forced to over-tip their servers for shit service."
Daniel K.,"Levittown, PA",7,18,,4.0,10/7/2014,"I ate at The Cheese Cake Factory at The Quaker Bridge Mall In Lawrenceville NJ.  The manu is extensive.  I took me a while to find what I wanted to eat. I chose The CHICKEN DI PANE. ""A lightly bread Chicken breast with home maid mashed potatoes broccoli served with a white wine sauce.""  Every bit was an adventure.  I savored every morsel. The rich sauce maid my mouth water. I would recommend this meal. The chicken fell apart with the mere touch of the fork. The mashed potatoes where creamy and full bodied. The Broccoli was fresh. The whole meal was a treat. The service was good. Are server was nice. The wait time was short. I am definitely going back to The Chess Cake factory."
Prasad N.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",0,6,,1.0,12/21/2013,"Service was not good at all. The food was not good either for the price you pay.  We had been there for our wedding anniversary. My wife's food order did not even come on time after me and kids almost finished our dinner her food came . It seems they had served her food to another table. My wife had ordered Bang Bang chicken which is a spicy dish, it was sweet and not good. The drinks were also not so good there cocktails on menu are on very sweeter side (sugar infused). The food is expensive compared to quality and price. Better off going to some Princeton area local restaurant.  We will not go there again."
Jarrod B.,"Jupiter, FL",30,20,,4.0,6/29/2014,"My wife and i always have a good experience when coming to this Cheesecake Factory.  The staff has always been nice to us and the food has always been good.  A little pricey, but we love the ambiance and it's a great place to spend the evening for a meal."
Nicole C.,"Trenton, NJ",1,31,3,5.0,8/27/2015,"Still love this place. Their pineapple mojito is the bomb. We tried different appetizers this time (mozzarella squares, buffalo bites and mini Cuban sandwiches). So good. Didn't even have room for cheesecake. My only gripe is they did away with the farro salad and that was our fav."
Tasha V.,"Princeton, NJ",0,36,,4.0,8/29/2014,"This location meets the standard of Cheesecake Factory.   The inside interior and ambiance are the same as other Cheesecake Factory locations.  Foods are great and portion size is BIG.  I ordered the Fetucinni pasta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend ordered a rib-eye steak.  I liked the pasta more than the steak; it was creamy, warm, and sweet from the sundried tomatoes. The steak seemed very typical, nothing special and it was OK.  This place is packed.  You should expect to wait for a long time to get seated and high noise level.  It's not an upscale, high end restaurant but still you can have a good time with our friend."
Hannah A.,"East Brunswick, NJ",11,9,4,2.0,1/11/2014,"Love the Cheesecake Factory because of the various items there are to choose from on the menu, BUT the service at this location was miserable! My husband and I came to this location and it was an empty Sunday evening; well our waitress was rude and forgot that we existed!! The restaurant was empty!!!!!!! I love this place, but don't know if I would sacrifice for the horrendous service! Train your stafffff!"
Marc S.,"Edison, NJ",0,13,,2.0,1/4/2015,We went there for a office party. Big menu and lots of items to select. Food was okay.. not excellent. Service was pathetic.. I would not prefer to go there again
Daniel O.,"Little Egg Harbor Township, NJ",0,4,,4.0,4/3/2014,I had a great time there the other night. I had a Parmesan crusted chicken with a tomato cream sauce which was really tasty. The atmosphere was nice and the service was terrific. I was surprised
Grace L.,"Stockton, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/28/2014,DO NOT GO HERE! Such bad service I think the waiter was trying to tell me I'm FAT did not give me bread or butter and told me to get the small portion of spaghetti and meatballs!!!!
Sarah W.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,4,1,1.0,3/26/2013,"I was expecting WAY better service from a restaurant with decorations more intricate than the Taj Mahal.  I mean the mood lighting was so dark, that I could barely read my menu, which had an advertisement on the back of every page, rendering the menu with a thickness of a small novel. The service was just terrible...our waiter's name was Sunshine for god's sake, and she was anything but.   I understand that the cheesecake factory sees a lot of traffic on a day to day basis, but we went on a TUESDAY afternoon, and it still took an hour and a half before we received any of our entrees.  I could see people who'd come before us not even having received their entrees while we were still waiting a while for ours.   When our entrees did come, I have to say, frankly, I was severely dissapointed.   I ordered the ""spring-tossed"" salad, and was met with a bowl of limp, tasteless vegetable greens.  Supposedly there was a ""red vinnegrette"" mixutre in there, but I could taste nothing My friend ordered the 4 cheese pasta, explicitely saying ""no chicken"" (as she's vegetarian),and it wasn't until she'd taken a few bites and shared some with our other vegetarian friend did she realize those odd-shaped mozzerella balls were actually just hunks of chicken.  What made it worse, was that it was her BIRTHDAY, and instead of not charging her for the pasta, as they rightfully should have, they took the entree away, and gave her a $7 cheesecake slice on the house.   Now, my math isn't that great...but a $7 free slice of cheesecake doesn't make up for the $17 we were charged, even though we didn't even eat the dish.   Bottom line: Go to the cheesecake factory if your expecting low quality service, negligent staff, and overpriced cheap food, that has so many calories packed in, you'll probably feel like you'll need a ride straight to the hospital.   I now know why its called the cheesecake FACTORY, thats how they automate their service and their food.  BUYER BEWARE;."
M H.,"Ocean City, NJ",46,20,11,3.0,11/23/2013,"I've been here a number of times since this place opened. Always very crowded with a long wait. Food is good but the service leaves a lot to be desired. For the prices they charge, everything should be better than it is."
Kartik I.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,9,,2.0,4/24/2013,"I was disappointed by the quality of food at this Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the one in Menlo Park many times and also visited the one in King of Prussia. However, this Cheesecake Factory in lags behind in quality.  I thought I would give this place a second chance and went there today with family at around 2 pm. I was hoping I would get great food and service since I was going at a off-peak hour. The service was good, however the quality of food wasn't. I was disappointed by the nachos, the avocados egg rolls and the fried macaroni and cheese. How do you mess up nachos!? The nachos looked a bit burnt and the cheese on it hadn't melted. For the price paid, this food definitely wasn't worth it."
Val K.,"Trenton, NJ",19,12,11,2.0,5/23/2014,"Tonight we ordered out, nice quiet already prepared easy dinner for us at home...so we pick up our food, they check it at the front and we are good to go. We order the spring rolls, a chop salad and a french country salad (fcs is my favorite) needless to say when I got home we enjoyed the spring rolls. Now, on to the salad...I open it up expecting nice big chunks of beets, and goat cheese with candied pecans and grilled asparagus atop mixed greens. Sounds good, right? Well after fighting my way through about 4 cups of mixed greens, I find less than an ounce of goat cheese, about 2 pecans, 3 little slivers of asparagus, and no beets to be found. You can imagine my disappointment, so I call the manager and after about 4 minutes of miscommunication between the front desk and everyone else picking up the phone I finally get to the manager. Very nice man and was very helpful. Refunded my salad ($11) but that still doesn't make up for the missing salad that I wanted for dinner and wasn't going to drive back to get a new one. I will be double checking anything (IF) I ever dine in/take out from there ever again..."
Cat L.,"Montgomery, NJ",10,29,25,3.0,10/6/2014,I went to dinner here with my coworker  and I got the teriyaki chicken. they gave you broccoli and the chicken breast was huge but it wasnt  really good because it was kind of dry it wasn't tender. they should call it chicken steak teriyaki because usually when I think of teriyaki chicken I think of slender pieces that are marinated in teriyaki sauce but this was a huge chicken fillet. it was thick and big. I would recommend the chicken teriyaki for people who like large portions of food. but if youre a food adventurist this isn't really the place to go for an amazing delicious groundbreaking mouthwatering surprise. however if you want good service and a nice dim lighted restaurant experience cheesecake factory will deliver. I always find the service people to be really nice really charming and really gracious at their  restaurants. but maybe it's just because I'm a nice person and I'm not mean to people. but I went to the Bridgewater one and I found their service to be equally as good. so overall this restaurant is good if you want good service fast food and Americanized dishes.
Tom E.,"Souderton, PA",0,3,,1.0,11/2/2014,"No phone number found on the Yelp listing, so we couldn't make a reservation. When we arrived, there was a 50-minute wait. We went elsewhere to eat."
Philip M.,"Trenton, NJ",62,7,,4.0,4/28/2013,"Ok, I have edited my review, I gave them a 4 (a 5 is near impossible in my book) My original review raved about their service as my wife and I are frequent diners there.  I edited it because we did have one bad experience, the server was friendly, when we saw him, he took our order and than we never saw him again until it was time to get the check (since the runners bring out the food) we never got bread, drink refills or anything.  We ended up leaving without dessert because we were so aggravated.   Being we were there for a special occasion I did not want to bring the issue to management while we were there, however felt they needed to know about our experience since it ultimately cost them money out of our register.  As a business man I know the voice of my customer is very important and if we had these issues I am sure other customers did as well and I know businesses use customer feedback as a training tool.  I decided to contact them directly though their website and explain our experiance.  I  got a call directly from the General Manager who was very apologetic.  Knowing that they actually read my email, knew about my concern and went out their way to contact me, reassures me that they are doing what they can to correct the situation, that's all I can ask for, so we shall return. With that said here is my review on the food.  My wife and used to meet up here for lunch without the kids atleast once a week, but on occasion will come with the kids for dinner.  There is usually a wait,  you can either call ahead or they will give you a buzzer that will work though out the newly renovated more upscale Quakerbridge Mall.   With that said, it is tough to rate Cheesecake factory on food, because there is so much going on there and I have a limited diet, but for the most part the quality is good. Don't let the name fool you,  If you have a group of people who are all in the mood for something different this is the place to go, the options are endless..... sorta, huge menu but any changes are a $2.00 upcharge.  Menu has everything from fresh delivered daily never frozen seafood to their signature flatbread pizzas, Cheesecake is only a part of the puzzle.  Any one who watches Kitchen Nightmares or is a fan of Gordon Ramsay will wonder why he is not standing in the middle of this restaurant screaming every 4 letter word while smashing all the plates and throwing the menus into a fire.  At Cheesecake Factory the menu is literally a book.  No lie a spiral bound 22 page book.  There are a ton of options (too many in some peoples opinion,) when opening the pages you will get an initial sticker shock as the prices seem fairly high.  This will be understood when you receive your portion and see how big it is.   With that said not all of us eat huge portions, like my profile says, I review for families on a budget and gastric bypass patients as I am a GB patient.  With the stomach the size of an egg, I am usually bringing a doggy bag home, the last thing I like to do is order something for $17.99 and bring 3/4 of it home knowing that if my mastiff does not eat it, it will probably just go bad in the fridge.  This is the nice thing about CcF, not only do they have a ""small plate"" & skinnylicious menu that is affordable, they also allow you to order lunch size portions until 5pm 7 days a week.  As a GB patient, I can usually leave there full, only spending about $7.00 on one of their small plate skinnylicious appetizers (I like the mexican chicken lettuce wrapped tacos)  As far as atmosphere, it is very loud, there are booths and tables, I would say the place is kid friendly and the kids meals are very reasonably priced and have a good selection."
J H.,"Borough of Princeton, NJ",0,97,,3.0,10/28/2012,I'm a fan overall.  First time at this newly opened location. Brand new attached to a tired mall in real need of updating. Glad they have come to town. Food was slow to be delivered. I think we caught a shift change. But it was tasty and in good portions as always. Love the fact that the menu has so many choices. One suggestion on the fish and chips. It makes no sense to serve them in a wire basket unless they are meant to be finger food.  Not my style personally. So I prefer a plate.  Chicken taquitos were delicious. Kids chicken tenders also good. We all loved the French fries. Service was efficient and pleasant.  I am confident the kitchen will speed up if the slowness was more than just a one off.
Tammy L.,"Langhorne, PA",4,1,,3.0,10/23/2012,Wait was 45 which is not bad for a Friday night.  This location has been open for about 2 weeks. The server was good but could use more training. He never asked for our drink order an didn't substitute my sides correctly. Over all the food was great. Had to take cheesecake to go I was so full.
J M.,"Trenton, NJ",0,20,1,5.0,3/23/2014,"I love this place and so did my kids and girlfriends. I ordered a flatbread pizza from the Skinny Menu and it was delicious. My son had a macaroni and cheese burger that he really liked. My daughter tried the mac and cheese and liked it. When I visited with friends all six of us were very pleased with our meals and the service. And yes the cheesecake is very good. Share it with one or two friends it is huge and rich. The only problem is that it gets so busy you might wait an hour. Go for lunch, right when they open and you'll get right in."
