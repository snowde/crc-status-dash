Phyllis F.,"Newtown, PA",0,16,19,5.0,3/26/2017,"So apparently if you sit at the high top tables or the bar, you can sit right down. No thanks waiting. Score!"
Tauseef S.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",15,32,14,4.0,4/11/2017,"Good overall experience at this location. My personal favorites are the Herb crusted salmon, shrimp platter, and the fried calamari for starters."
James T.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,8,9,2.0,2/25/2017,"Usually this place is the goto restaurant by default for virtually any occasion, however, despite not being that full we waited ~40 mins to get our entrees. We got 2 items from the special menu and we were disappointed. One was the chicken riesling, the pasta was missing flavor and was clumpy, the chicken was ok but not impressive. The other one was a crispy orange chicken and shrimp in a pineaple sweet and spicy sauce. The chicken was well cooked, but the sauce was a bit too sweet and the shrimp killed the dish, the crust was too brown and coupled with the shrimp's taste it just killed my appetite. [The manager did stop by and we communicated the issues but nothing was remediated or at anything done to improve the experience]"
Elizabeth W.,"Princeton, NJ",15,4,,1.0,7/12/2017,"Let me start this off by saying that I eat at Cheesecake Factory, including this location, quite frequently. I really enjoy their vast food options at a reasonable price, but also understand you get what you pay for. However, the experience I had tonight was awful!!! Our server took 10 mins to greet our table, and did not even introduce himself by name. Then we asked for bread, which took just as long as our actual food to come out (even though we asked for the bread when we ordered our drinks). The bread was not soft and warm like it usually is, but rather hard and gross. Finally, he did not come back to actually check on us when our food came out. We were mostly finished with our meal when he asked if we would like anything else. Overall, our server ruined our experience, he was not friendly and attentive like I'm used to at the Cheesecake Factory. When I voiced my awful experience to the manager, she did not seem to care. After this experience, I will not return this location, it sucks!!"
Amanda W.,"New York, NY",77,9,,1.0,8/24/2017,Usually love the Cheesecake Factory but had an awful experience tonight! It took ESP long to get a seat which is to be expected on a busy night.  Then we were seated and it took 15 mins just to get drink orders and another 10 mins for the drinks to arrive.  By drinks meaning only 1 of 2 arrived and the other drink was just apple juice.   After a long wait for a table not even having a drink or bread seemed a bit harsh.  Then I went to the restroom and there were no stalls with any paper.  It seemed as though it was all on the floor and hadn't been serviced in weeks.  Then when back to the table our waiter just whizzed by to other tables.  It was too much for us so we had to leave and go eat at Johnny Rockets next door because we were starving.
Elen B.,"Trenton, NJ",1,6,,1.0,7/4/2017,"4th of July, I guess they figured no one would out today. It took 10 minutes before we were acknowledged, and seated. The waiter came right away. Cocktails showed up in good time, although the ""Ultimate"", $13.00 margarita was just OK. We ordered some ""small plates"" to start, my husband hadn't eaten all day. Ahi Tartar, nice presentation, just ok., Cuban egg rolls, he liked them, my favorite was the "" Korean cauliflower"", that was really good. When we finished these, I went to the restroom, and hubby went to smoke, (we did let our waitress know). When we returned the buser was clearing off our table!! Half of my cocktail and all!! Obviously, no communication between server and buser. They replaced my margarita, then the food comes. Hubby ordered a burger, nothing special. I ordered a ""Cuban sandwich"". Now, I have had this before at CCF, and it was very good. NOT THIS TIME!! One piece of ham, a layer of pickles, cheese and mustard. THAT'S IT!! ONE PIECE OF HAM!! Luckily the fries were ok. I know I could have complained, but, it really wasn't worth it. WE WON'T BE BACK"
Robyn H.,"Morrisville, PA",119,199,349,5.0,4/13/2015,"I had dinner at this location tonight for my birthday. We arrived about 6:00 pm and had no wait which rarely happens! I love the large menu, but I always get the same thing. I had the stuffed chicken tortillas and my mom had the chopped salad. Both were prepared exactly as ordered. Mine with extra cilantro, the salad with dressing on the side.  I love stuffed chicken tortillas. I will say that I think they have started to make chicken a bit spicer. I don't mind it, but I felt a burn. I also the sweet corn cakes that come on the side. I need to figure out how to make this at home! My mom loved her salad. I have difficulty getting excited by a salad.  No dessert today. Too full from my huge meal!  Will return again soon!"
Sara M.,"Franklin Park, NJ",1,20,74,3.0,8/30/2016,"Came here for a quick lunch with my mom and sis. I had gotten the Veggie Melt a few weeks back and was craving it again. It was good but not great. When I had gotten it at the Menlo location it was much better, included all the ingredients that were listed on the menu, and was quite large! At Quakerbridge on the other hand, it was as if someone had thrown together a sloppy sandwich and tried to just fill it up with whatever they had within reach. It even came with these nasty tomatoes that had no taste and looked like they were canned, even though it's supposed to come with sundried tomatoes. You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not get cheesecake...as usual their cheesecake didn't disappoint. Try the Salted Caramel Cheesecake...you won't regret it!  As to the service it was pretty good. Our server (Eric) was quite nice and attentive without being pushy. Props to him for being patient while we looked over the cheesecake menu."
Renata M.,"Southampton, PA",48,56,35,2.0,1/5/2016,I have been to many different locations of this chain and all are consistently the same. The menu is huge and has options for everyone and the cheesecake is the BEST as it should be for a restaurant that specializes. The avocado egg rolls are my absolute favorite as are the Thai lettuce wraps. The dulce de leche and raspberry lemon cheesecakes are amazing.  This was the first time getting Louisiana chicken pasta and it was underwhelming as were the Mexican lettuce wraps that completely lacked any flavor. The service in this location was awful as well. The waiter was ignoring us from the second we sat down. We barely got a refill on our drinks and never got any bread.
Patricia F.,"Somerset, NJ",7,39,26,2.0,5/1/2016,"My husband and I went here last night after seeing a movie at AMC Hamilton. First things first, we walked in at 11:30 pm. Okay, it's a Saturday night and the restaurant doesn't close until 12:30 am. No problem, right? Wrong. There were, at most, four other patrons in the entire restaurant. Waiters were pissed at us as we came in and several waiters stood around IGNORING us. How dare we walk into an establishment on a Saturday night a full hour before they close? My husband had to walk up to the hostess table and lean across it until finally a waiter came up to us. He was very gruff and brusque but led us to our table. The waiters in the restaurant and bartenders were being EXTREMELY loud, yelling and laughing throughout our entire time there. And our waiter seemed pissed the entire time and like he couldn't wait for us to leave. I was feeling entirely uncomfortable at this point. My husband ordered a Mac and Cheese burger with a small Yuengling, I ordered the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp with a Lemonade. I told the waiter twice I wanted white rice and he still snapped at me before walking away, ""White rice or brown?"" To which my husband gave me an incredulous look and I said emphatically, ""White!"" Our food was brought out and it was pretty good. My husband enjoyed his burger. My shrimp was pretty damn tasty as was the plantain on the side. I will say they piled it on with too much rice and it was the literal driest rice I have ever tasted in my life. I tried eating it but just gave up on it. We are now the only patrons in the entire restaurant and the waiters are getting even louder. I honestly just want to leave at this point and order cheesecake to go (the entire point of coming to this place) but our waiter has literally disappeared. We have not seen him in close to 20 minutes. Finally, a blonde woman sweeps up to our table and breathlessly asks us if she can help us with anything else or if we are all finished. My husband ordered the Snickers cheesecake and I ordered my favorite, the Cherry cheesecake. Our waiter finally shows up with our dessert order and insists I ordered the Strawberry cheesecake, and I despise strawberry cheesecake btw. So, I told him no, I ordered the Cherry. My husband starts to agree until the waiter finally just opens the bag and sees that it is Cherry. ""Oh. My bad."" We then get our receipt. $75?! With a 15% tip? Are you kidding me?! There are 5 star, Zagat-rated restaurants in New Brunswick near the State Theater we could have eaten at for less than that! At the end of the day, this is a shitty chain restaurant with delicious cheesecake. Why is this restaurant so ridiculously overpriced?! Nothing we ate even almost warranted that price. I looked over the receipt and the cheesecake ALONE was $15! Fifteen freaking bucks! Come on, son. My first choice was Longhorn Steakhouse but they were closed by the time our movie got out. How I wish we could have gone there. Honestly, I prefer the food at Olive Garden. I dont eat meat so its always a delight for me to find a delicious vegetarian meal and their mushroom ravioli is tha bomb! Theyre a bit pricey but its worth it. Cheesecake Factory is way pricey and they're *not* worth it. You're paying for some fake ass ambiance with fake marble and low lights. Its a faux upscale restaurant with ridiculously oversized portions. I still love their cheesecake so lesson learned. I will only come here for appetizers and desserts in the future. This place isnt worth $75 for two people!"
Sarah E.,"Trenton, NJ",17,55,32,4.0,2/22/2017,They have a great happy hour. The girl bartender is so nice. She recommends good wine :) the other bartenders are nice too.
Melissa M.,"Hightstown, NJ",72,157,516,5.0,1/17/2016,"Once again in the mood for a salad so we went to the cheesecake factory. I simply cannot say enough about their amazing salads! This time I had a drink too, the red sangria, which was dangerously delicious! My fiance had the mojito and judging from how many he had, they seemed good lol... The egg roll sampler is really good and comes with several different dipping options, all of which are amazing. Recommended for salad lovers!"
Al W.,"Chatham, NJ",8,19,,1.0,6/5/2017,"This was the worst experience imaginable! Rude waiter who didnt bring my food until my companions were  almost done with theirs, not even a drink refill as I sat there watching everyone else eat.. Then when the meal finally came, it was wrong.. Just an awful time.. And the manager looked like she needed someone to babysit her. Never ever again!!"
Rachel G.,"East Windsor, NJ",122,7,,1.0,10/26/2016,"My boyfriend and I always go to The Cheesecake Factory on birthdays, anniversaries, etc. We always thought they were fairly priced. He always gets the burrito there that is HUGE and only $14 and he always has leftovers. BUT the other day we went there and I ordered my mom the lemon shrimp and garlic pasta to go that is on the ""skinnylicious"" menu that was $18.99. When I got home and opened the box I was so disappointed. There was 3 pieces of shrimp with a child's portion of pasta in a huge box. It honestly looked like someone ate half of the meal. Now, I understand the portioning because everything on that menu is 600 calories or less but there is absolutely NO reason why that entree should have costed me $19. I'm not one to complain and write reviews and whatnot but this made me extremely upset."
Daniela J.,"Princeton, NJ",5,542,1522,5.0,7/8/2016,Great service and great food. The location is beautiful and one of my favorite spots to eat out! My boyfriend and I both had the bacon bacon cheeseburger with sweet potatoe fries. Absolutely delicious. Desert: original cheesecake!!! Amazing!!!! Server Jim was very nice!!!
Grace L.,"New Hope, PA",0,12,,5.0,2/11/2017,"My daughter and I were there this afternoon. Food, service and waitress were great. Will go back."
Leah B.,"Princeton, NJ",0,9,,4.0,7/14/2017,Great vibes and huge variety of cheesecakes. Perfect place to rest after doing some shopping at the mall
Maheen M.,"Monroe Township, NJ",346,204,824,4.0,7/3/2015,"The first time I came here was with a group of 20-25 people. Because we didn't call beforehand, we had to wait around and hour to be seated.  When we were seated, our orders were taken quickly and the food came out promptly. The waiter and waitress assigned to out table were very nice and attentive. All I know is that my dish tasted good. Everyone else was also satisfied with their dishes. Surprisingly we also ordered dessert. Majority got cheesecake while others got the strawberry shortcake. We were all so happy and satisfied with food."
Giang-Tien M.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",2830,1127,3869,3.0,6/27/2015,We had lunch there while waiting for our car to have an oil change at the nearby Sears auto center. Pros: Clean and modern restaurant and bathroom with a customer-oriented and fast service.... Cons: The food is average and over-priced.
Tim M.,"New York, NY",0,3,,2.0,4/29/2017,"Got take out. About as friendly as ordering at the DMV. Food is at best average. So many other choices in the area,. Suggest skipping it."
