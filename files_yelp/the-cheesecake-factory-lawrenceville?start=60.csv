Caleb B.,"Hicksville, NY",14,40,2,5.0,5/4/2016,"Wow!              I thought the food would be under rated, but to my surprise the food was better than I thought. It was stated it would be a 45 min wait, so I decided to shop at macys. To my surprise upon arrival I decided to check at the front desk to see, if I was called and I sure was. I never should have left. Yet I had the best seat in the joint, corner table. I hope I can get that table all the time I will request it, near the waiters station. Our Customer Service Host  was the best 10 stars, amanda proceeded to ask if this was our first time and I stated yes, and she explained the menu in a way that most other restaurants will not do and take out the time to explain.fried calamari,steak,kids pizza and grilled salmon was yummy. I would recommend you to sit in his section near the bar. Once again I under estimated this place. Never again! great experience ,awesome food,excellent service."
Sai M.,"Princeton, NJ",80,2,,1.0,9/20/2016,Found strands of hair in my food along with flies roaming around us. Horrible experience never coming back here again!
Nat M.,"Philadelphia, PA",27,255,577,3.0,2/21/2016,"This is a nice branch of the Cheesecake Factory chain. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I tried the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and was underwhelmed - it was not spicy but the fried chicken was good. Love their cheesecake, which never disappoints! Enjoyed the flatbread appetizer with pear, walnuts, and blue cheese."
Taylor P.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,1,,3.0,6/6/2017,"To start off, I never ever get disappointed with the appetizers. My favorite are the Tex Mex Egg Rolls and they are always amazing every single time. However, the most recent time I have been there and ordered those egg rolls, me and one other person in my party discovered that maybe 2-3 egg rolls in the 2 plates that we ordered, were one of the other varieties of egg rolls on the appetizers or small plates menu. It tasted like beef and mustard, rather than the chicken Tex Mex ones. Now luckily, I was the one who tasted that one and realized. 2 people in my party are not able to eat beef, and also, what if someone had an allergy to one of the ingredients that were in that other variety of egg rolls. They need to be careful in what they plate. Another reason why I'm not too fond of this place is because every single sort of entree I have gotten, was terrible. Whether it was chicken or one of the pasta dishes. For what it is, they are extremely over priced. There was this one time I had a $50 gift card, and I hated my $20 pasta dish, that probably costs them 50 cents or less to make. I should have spoken up, but I basically wasted half my gift card. One person in my party the most recent time I've been there, got the chicken with cashews and brown rice. He had to send it back because the rice was barely even cooked and was hard. It's not that hard to make rice, or maybe they heated it up in the microwave. Who knows. But for now on, I will only go there for their appetizers. The entrees are just crap to me and overpriced , but also, everyone has their own opinion and their own tastebuds. But this was just my experience."
Jennifer C.,"Morrisville, PA",0,6,,1.0,3/13/2017,"Reason for dining here: lunch date with boyfriend Pro: 1. was seated right away despite that the place was very busy. 2.our waiter was friendly and informative about the menu. 3. they have some vegetarian options 4. They pack your leftovers for you.   Con: 1. If you are seated at a table be prepared to sit very close to other people, close enough where you can touch their arm or have a full conversation. 2. the menu is wayyyy to big in my opinion over 50 different food choices.(not a good idea for indecisive people) 3. Food below average. I order the fish taco and it came with rice and beans. The fish tacos weren't good. The shell was a bit soggy and the fish wasn't hot. The rice and beans was good, but nothing I could've made myself at home. My boyfriend had a regular hamburger with fries. He asked for well done and it was given to him medium rare. On top of that he only received a handful of fries. 4. This place is overpriced ! I didn't even want dessert. For the price of the food I would of thought my taste buds would be throwing a party. Sadly that was not the case. We would not be returning. Now we know why the prices aren't online. My fish taco was about $14.00 and his hamburger with his pitiful fries was about $11.00. There is menu outside by the door that unfortunately my boyfriend and I missed on the way in."
Vinayak B.,"Langhorne, PA",387,267,769,1.0,10/16/2014,"Will write a review of our experience at the cheese cake factory location once the soap dispensers in the mens room are fixed. I would imagine on any given day that at least 500-800 patrons would get served (read ""processed"") at the factory. Took the manager personally for a tour of the bathroom situation and he had a really lame excuse that springs for the dispensers were ordered and were arriving in a day or two. Well if you would ask me, place a soap bottle or two in the bathroom so that patrons, waitstaff and cooks alike would have an opportunity to sanitize their hands in the interest of public health and safety. Monsieur Overton, if your team needs to reach out to me for ANY reason,  they're more than welcome to. Would so love to be your guest as to what precisely transpired at the factory on this particular evening besides the health code violation. A bientôt!"
Siri S.,"Frisco, TX",0,8,,3.0,5/9/2017,Food is delicious. We love cheese cakes and Godiva chocolate cake. They are out of this world. Average ambiance. This place is always busy. There is also lot of wait time.
Yvonne R.,"Las Cruces, NM",8,4,1,1.0,12/26/2016,"I wish we didn't have to give even one star! We waited over an hour for our food (the actual food was good when we got it), the waiter - John - never offered to refill our glasses even once. Finally asked for the manager and surprise - when she came over the food finally showed up. All she said was ""Oh sorry"". Won't be going there anymore."
Jeff B.,"Princeton, NJ",0,53,,4.0,4/28/2017,Good place to grab a burger or decent pasta dish. Can be very busy at times and parking is always hard to find in that area.
Akilah M.,"Trenton, NJ",74,89,46,2.0,2/16/2016,"My best friend and I went for a lunch date... My  waitress was sweet and friendly made a good suggestion about the cucumber lemonade. We had buffalo blast, crispy crab balls and chicken caesar salad. The food was good but the sitting is extremely to close...its so close you can smell your neighbors perfume and his cologne.... I won't ever sit at a table again...THE WAITRESS at the TABLE NEXT to US GAVE our NEIGHBORS THERE FOOD HER ASS WAS SO CLOSE I COULD GRAB IT....."
Mariam H.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",12,5,12,4.0,7/22/2016,My favorite place for special occasions since this is very close to us and i love the ambience. Their complimentary breads are super amazing and fresh. Love the fried calamari for appetizer. Favorite entrees are herb crusted salmon and fish and chips.
Harriett T.,"Vincentown, NJ",11,286,,1.0,1/16/2016,"My friend ordered the white chilli which was completely overloaded with jalapeno peppers! It was way too spicy for public consumption! I ordered the french dip sandwich with au jus gravy.They must have tenderized the meat with MSG plus put some in the au jus. I am allergic to MSG so you can see where this is going. The cheese on the sandwich was not melted and was hard (stale??). The meat was hot-can't figure out how the cheese was hard! If you discount the flavorings--The Cheesecake Factory's basic cheesecake is NOT all that good! It's pretty bland and it does not taste of good cheese ingredients. I taste more flour and sugar than any type of cheese. I really think you can get a better meal at a better value someplace else. I don't understand the ""hype""."
Maria A.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",75,42,2,1.0,8/23/2016,"It is good,  although the smell of the restaurant is terrible. It smells like someone threw up.  I came for the opening and was obviously fine,  the next time is when it smelled bad, I thought someone had actually thrown up.  After the third and following meals the restaurant simply smells bad.  I've had experience with lots of cheesecake factory restaurant around the country and this is the only one with the issue."
Abhishek J.,"Uniondale, NY",0,1,,1.0,11/15/2015,"Waited 10 minutes for sub-ordinary food. The Buffalo Wings and the Crispy Crab Bites were the only things great. Celery was  fresh. The garlic noodles were full of oil, bland. Halfway done eating, the waitress realized we could've used bigger plates. She was pretty warm & welcoming otherwise. Nachos felt stale and a mix of undercooked and overfried. The spicy chipotle pasta was just OK, can't be called spicy per chipotle standards.  Truthfully Honest"
Jay K.,"Levittown, PA",0,25,11,2.0,9/7/2015,"Ridiculously overpriced and this restaurant is HIGHLY OVERRATED. I will get into detail of all I ordered. Appetizer: buffalo blasts. A breaded and fried wonton filled with shredded buffalo chucked and cheese. .. Extremely good Dinner: Ordered the parmesan crusted chicken. The very first thing I noticed, that my eyes hit right away as soon as the waiter put my plate down. Was a long piece of hair on top of my chicken. How do you decide to serve that to a customer and think thats ok? Dont they have someone checking every plate for presentation etc before going out to the customer? It was literally the first thing I noticed instantly. I sent it back and a few minutes later the manager came to me apologizing and offered me a complimentary soup or salad. I however declined. What ended up being extremely more upsetting to me was that my original plate had a very large piece of chicken. The new dish they sent me had 2 little pieces of chicken and twice as much pasta to fill out the plate. So that pissed me off even more. No consistency to what they serve in portions. The chicken and pasta is very good though. Dessert: got the godiva chocolate brownie sundae. It was pretty decent portion size, not much ice cream. The brownies were disgusting. They were like rock solid and had to use a lot of force/pressure to get my spoon through them. They were also kind of like chalky. Definitely would never order that again Cheesecake: it is good, however I refuse to pay $8 just for a little slice of cheesecake. Another thing they are highly inconsistent with. I have had cheesecake on a few occasions in the past. One time for takeout I got 2 pretty big pieces. 3 other times stopping in for takeout and I got these little slivers that make you say ""what the f**k is this? $8 for a piece of this crap!?!?""  If I want cheesecake I'll go to the Edison Diner."
Ashley M.,"New York, NY",0,20,7,3.0,8/16/2016,"Service was great, food was okay. The cheesecake is amazing, especially with all the different flavors"
Fran L.,"Trenton, NJ",7,100,,3.0,7/29/2016,"Let's start by saying - I like the food. The cheesecakes are tasty, they have a 'light' menu with pretty tasty options, their complimentary bread is good, and their menu is big enough to satisfy pretty much anyone. Sure, it's not cheap, but not outrageous either. My main issue with the place is that it's just not pleasant to dine there. The place is incredibly loud and the AC is just too high, my daughter and I are freezing every time we go eat there. Other than that, I wish they changed their menu once in a while."
Tha C.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,,3.0,1/22/2017,3 star for the waitress who was awesome and attentive. We usually go to the one in cherry hill or Philadelphia and decided to check this one out and the food was disappointing.
Douglas C.,"Robbinsville, NJ",1,22,,2.0,6/6/2016,Consistently mediocre food.  Our last visit was highlighted by apps coming out right on top of our entree.  The server alerted management to the issue and they compted our app.  Disappointing but the right move.  Both entrees were overcooked.  Then a new manger comes over and let's us know our stroller can't be in the aisle.  He tells we can finish our meal.  Why say that after we're done nearly done?  Don't feel rushed or anything.  Then I over hear him give the server a hard time not 5 feet from our table at the hostess station.  She took the table over on a shift change and had nothing to do with seating us.  I tell the server that was unfair and that I want to speak to him before I leave.  When I do he lies about it.  I heard him say those things and he says I didn't hear it correctly!  Unbelievable!
Julie L.,"Trenton, NJ",3,76,38,4.0,7/10/2016,"The food is very good, but not cheap.  I wish the menu was less confusing.  I enjoy the food and love the cheesecake.  This place is very busy and usually has a long wait."
