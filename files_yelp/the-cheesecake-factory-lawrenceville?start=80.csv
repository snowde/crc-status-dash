John M.,"Southampton, PA",1,34,1,1.0,6/21/2015,"I visited Cheesecake Factory on 6/20/2015 at 12pm. Let me start by saying I had a trainee for a waitress which I understand because everyone has to start somewhere. My wife ordered the factory nachos and I ordered fried shrimp with fries and cole slaw. The Nachos came out burned and cold with no chicken which the dish is supposed to have. My dish came out with shrimp very greasy and w/o the cole slaw. This whole experience made me very frustrated because when someone chooses to go out for a dining experience how hard is it to do what you are supposed to do correctly,especially when I spend my hard earned money in the establishment. My wife kindly spoke to one of the male staff members to get her dish corrected and it still came back burned and cold. Now I hope that the manager reads this because it's very sad to me that getting something as simple as nachos and shrimp wrong is ridiculous. I will not be returning to the Cheesecake Factory and I will be passing the word because I have had it up to my ears with these businesses taking my money and giving me horrible service. Here's a clue get your mind off of Instagram, Facebook etc. and please concentrate on the task at hand.                                                 John Morris "

Megan C.,"Columbus, NJ",13,14,,5.0,4/5/2016,The best place to stop after shopping! My friend and I were here last Friday for Happy hour we both ordered the mojitos and they were delish. The appetizers aare always consistent and I love the Ahi Tuna Salad. Thanks can't wait to go back!
Kyle L.,"North Brunswick, NJ",27,11,1,4.0,1/21/2015,"If you haven't been to a Cheesecake factory then you most likely don't live near any malls. That, or you just don't understand the appeal 'high-class' chain restos. I have been to quite a few of these restaurants and they all have the same harry-potter-series style menu that includes all different types of culturally diverse selections with your typical advertisements thrown in the mix because, really? who wouldn't want to be sold perfume while trying to eat? Not me that's who.  My partner in crime and I came in on a late Monday evening and were immediately sat. The decor is interesting to say the least and the lighting leaves something to be desired (bring a flashlight). Even at the hour that we went there were still people flowing in (around 9:30). Our waitress was attentive and accommodating, both of us were able to change the dishes we order to our liking.  I had ordered the Spicy chipotle chicken with Angel hair pasta. The spice and texture on the dish was very pleasing, the chicken bits in the dish were a tad bit dry but nicely spiced. The pasta was a bit over cooked. My PIC had the Farafalle garlic noodles which were a bit overcooked as well but there was a strong taste of garlic which I actually preferred. Both were very large portions and required another day to finish. The cheesecake as always was superb, we had the lemon meringue cheesecake whic had their delicious homemade whipped cream as well as a nice light lemoney custard filling with a hint of lemon which wasn't over bearing. This resto offers above average food for an above average price, You pay for what you get. It is usually a hit or miss when it comes to the service."
Mister T.,"Hightstown, NJ",28,169,,3.0,9/14/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory in particular is fairly decent in terms of service and speed.  I don't usually go out of my way for restaurants like these, but the wife likes this place.  So long as she's happy, I'm happy.  And she is always pleased with her meals here.  But there are many better options for dinner in this area.  And it's just foolish to wait in line when there is one, with the herd."
Brittany A.,"Toronto, Canada",186,509,907,4.0,4/15/2014,"I loved the chill relleno! There are so many items on their menu, it can be a bit overwhelming. Also, a tip - don't come here if you are on a diet ;) while they do have a Skinnylicious menu to choose from, the most tasty things aren't good for you! I enjoyed the appetizers we ordered, including the Firecracker Salmon, Dynamite Shrimp, Cuban Rolls, and the fire grilled artichoke. The only one I would not order again would be the shrimp, just a bit on the boring side. I was so stuffed from the apps and drinks, I only ordered a chilli relleno for my main, which I really liked. It was very nicely crispy, slightly spicy, and just stuffed to the gills with oozy monterey jack cheese - yum overload! We took a Reese peanut butter cheesecake slice to go home - it was absolutely insanity! Like the best cheesecake I have ever eaten for sure.  Fun to come to check out when in the States, that's for sure (we don't have any yet in Canada lol)!"
Michelle C.,"BURLNGTN CITY, NJ",1,39,31,4.0,2/28/2016,"Bartenders were fairly nice and friendly... Gave us a few samples of drinks! And they were delish!!! We got a taste of chocolate shake, Oreo shake and some mango drink. We didn't know what to get so we figured we would tried a few different things instead of committing to just one meal! We had the mixed egg roll app, it did not disappoint, along with the fried shrimp app and sesame chicken with shrimp and brown rice!! Today was a total success.. I love food! Lol This was my first time here and so I shall return. Oh yeah, tiramisu was excellent as well. =) Down side to a great place is the wait.. But we found a spot at the bar and that was nothing to frown upon."
Grant A.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",0,11,6,3.0,4/2/2016,"The food is so good and their cheesecakes are smooth and creamy however, the service is slow and one of my orders took almost 20 minutes long. Also, it was a pain to get a table with a 30 minute wait. Next, the prices are too high for meals you can get anywhere. If you ask me, this is a bad experience for people who have a small budget and little patience."
AnneMarie F.,"Simi Valley, CA",67,155,32,4.0,11/20/2015,Piña colada was meh. Bread is yummy before food. Fried cheese was good. Their BBQ sauce is the best of all time
Fiona L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",426,347,1581,3.0,11/5/2014,"I've only been here once. In fact, I only got a piece of chocolate tuxedo cheesecake to-go because the wait was like 1 hour plus! It was insanely packed and busy. I forgot which night it was (probably on the weekend). There were just too many people during dinner time and the wait time is crazy long! Instead, my friend and I went elsewhere for dinner, and we got a cheesecake for dessert."
Richard T.,"Princeton, NJ",4,13,,2.0,9/30/2014,"When my family arrived there was not seat available inside so we took a seat outside. I thought a restaurant is usually good if there are people waiting for seats becoming available. But this was not the case. First we were surprised by the size of the dishes, they were huge! However the taste was soso. The steak seems to pan seared, the shrimp wasn't very fresh, there was some weird taste in it.  Lastly the desert -- we thought it was supposed to be good since it's cheese cake factory! But, I thought the lemon cheesecake was way too sweet. Well, the kids love it, because it rivals candy. Not impressed overall."
Roger W.,"Red Bank, NJ",17,26,,2.0,8/28/2016,"Firstly, let me say that I have eaten at numerous locations of The Cheescake Factory over the past twenty years and this was the first time I was ever disappointed with my experience.  I can tolerate slow service and drink refills, but not dirty knives and forks.  The condition of silverware was atrocious.  We called for the manager and they immediately cleared our table and brought us new silverware.  Also, this was the first time a server ever brought room temperature water with no ice when we asked for water.  I guess you have to specify that you want ice in your water and a straw.  I would avoid this location, until they fix the obvious problem they are have with their dishwasher."
Steven H.,"Trenton, NJ",75,89,158,2.0,8/10/2015,"Amateur Hour: save your money and go to Applebee's it's the same Food! This was our first visit to the Cheese Cake Factory at the Quakerbridge Mall and it will definitely be our last.  We called earlier in the day to make reservations and we're told they they did not accept reservations.  We arrived around 5pm and seated immediately outside as requested.  The waiter came over and took our drink order and asked the usual questions.  We ordered 4 alcoholic beverages and 4 glasses of water.  The drinks arrive in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the LIT which was amazing (we all know they are easy to mess up), my friend ordered a glass of red Sangria which was also good.  However the two girls where less fortunate,one ordered the strawberry martini and it tasted as though the entire strawberry (stem included) was blended into the drink.  It defiantly had a earthy taste to it.  it was drinkable but less than enjoyable.  The other girl in our group ordered a simple Mai Tai and It was extremely strong.  She was able to enjoy it after letting some of the ice melt.  We then ordered the following appetizers, buffalo blast, avocado egg rolls and the Mac and cheese bites.  We also reordered the same 4 glasses of water that we had not gotten.  The Mac and cheese was defiantly the highlight of the appetizers.  The buffalo blast is shredded buffalo chicken wrapped in a wonton like shell then deep fried.  In theory this sounds perfect but it was obvious that this was sitting for a few minutes before they brought it out due to the fact it was very soggy.  Each piece  was stacked on one another so the oil drained onto all the lower pieces.  The avocado egg rolls where good I happen to not be a fan of avocado but I did try them and I found them to be enjoyable still not my cup of tea though.  We ordered our meals and they consisted of the following, chicken marsala, chicken cashew, pasta carbonara and the spicy crispy chicken sandwich.  The food arrived in a reasonable time and other then that I felt also thought the food fell extremely flat.  I remember the food at other cheese cake factory's had a great deal of flavor to it.  To be honest while eating I kind of thought the food was very similar to Applebee's.   You could tell the chicken cashew was not freshly cooked and they other meals just did not have anything special that would justify the price range.  The chicken breast on the chicken sandwich was so large that it was impossible to eat as a sandwich.  I also was thought the point of getting a sandwich was to eat it like one.  Well at least dinner was over and it was time to eat cheese cake!!!!! We waited over 30 minutes for our waiter to make it back around to our table to bring desert menus, lucky for us we just found the menus online and were ready to order. Again 4 pieces ordered, strawberry, the new salted Carmel, and 2 of Adams peanut butter cup fudge ripple.  The cheese cake came out fast and it looked delicious.  From a visual inspection it was very clear the the two pieces of Adams peanut butter cheese cake were very uneven, one slice had a ton of peanut butter cups and butterfingers but almost no actual cheeses cake, the other slice was just the opposite.  It did not help that we ordered a slice of strawberry and instead received a slice of plain with strawberry on top.  This meal came to a grand total of $244 for four people to eat.  Granted we had three courses but for the quality of the food and the freshness this is in my opinion extremely over prices.  The service was horrible and this was the first time in a very long time I tipped only 15%.  The meals  on the menu ranged in price from 16-30$ depending of what you wanted to order.  I have no problem with these prices but if this is going to be your price you better deliver on the promise that is associated with that price.  I am the guy that has no problem going to Scarpetta in NYC and paying 24$ for a small bowl of spaghetti but that price dictates it better be the best spaghetti I have ever eaten (oh and it was).  Perhaps it's time to trim down that 15 page menu and instead of making 100 items half assed, it's time to try making 25 really really well.  Just one mans opinion however based of the other yelp reviews you guys are in a bit of trouble."
Beth C.,"Freehold, NJ",0,53,16,2.0,8/26/2016,"This is not the location I usually visit, we live closer to the Freehold mall but visited Quakerbridge for a change. We walked in at around 1pm on a Friday and were told the wait was 10-15 minutes. 30 minutes later after watching countless party's walk through the door and be seated immediately, we were seated. That was aggravating. Our waiter asked for our drink order and we ordered the food right away as well. Two cokes and a water...well the water never showed up. We were looking everywhere for our waiter and he was absolutely nowhere in sight. I would have asked another wait staff but after hearing two of them complaining about another table asking them for help when they weren't their table... Made me very uncomfortable. (We were seated by the bar and the waiters register a very popular place for them to congregate and bitch... Everyone but our missing waiter) after the food was delivered and halfway into my salad the waiter rose from the dead I asked for my water and he didn't even realize he didn't bring it initially. Once we finished we were ready for the check and what do you know? No waiter. I should have known this trip was going to be bad the minute we walked in, waited longer than we should have, watched as an older lady sneezed all over the menu... Twice. Just a mess really won't be returning to this location anytime soon, we will stick with freehold."
Nancy D.,"New York, NY",0,20,,1.0,1/23/2016,"HAIR ON YOUR HEAD, GOOD. HAIR IN YOUR SANDWICH, BAD, VERY BAD. I have no idea why everybody wants to make a pit stop at the cheesecake factory every time we drive through here. Long story short, we ordered bunch of appetizers, including wings, etc. (wings were pretty good btw). Ordered bunch of pastas, which were bland and swimming in oil. Then my extra hair sandwich came, took two bites and saw alfalfa sprouts! You wish. #Hairsandwichanyone?"
christine t.,"Jersey City, NJ",11,7,6,2.0,8/17/2015,"Monday mid-afternoon. Party of 4. Seated quickly. Service was extremely slow. Waiter took 15 mins to give us our drinks. Another 15 mins after to take our order. And to top it all off, the food came out sporadically and some food items were left cold as if it was sitting out waiting to be served. Sigh, not impressed."
Jessica I.,"trenton, NJ",50,62,43,3.0,8/5/2015,"Dropped in for a solo drink and snack at the bar while at the mall. It was pricey, so I'd like to think of it as a once in a while treat. Long Island Iced Tea could have been stronger, which says a lot considering they are comprised of 5 different spirits. It was expensive too, around $11. I had the crispy fried cheese ($4.95) and it was satisfactory. Service was really great for how busy it was; they brought me a bread basket and everything. Overall, a good and relaxed time watching the Mets and poisoning my body. Hehe."
Ella A.,"Pennington, NJ",3,9,2,3.0,2/14/2015,"Stopped by just for dessert with a group and tried both the carrot cake and banana cream cheesecakes. The carrot cake was delicious but very heavy, the banana was light and creamy."
Ed K.,"New Hope, PA",36,48,2,3.0,12/30/2014,"This was not as good as I expected. The service was slow food coming to the table slower, and the noise awful!!! The waiter was friendly. The food over salted! The Cheesecake sickening sweet. We probably will never go back.  There was one table that moved their place 3 times because of the noise. I don't know what you can do about that except acoustical tiles. Because it's a big warehouse set up."
Janet R.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,9,,3.0,1/4/2017,very crowded and pricy for what you get.  the cheese cake variety is awesome but that can be purchased for take out so i am not sure the food is worth putting up with the cafeteria like setting the restaurant offers.
