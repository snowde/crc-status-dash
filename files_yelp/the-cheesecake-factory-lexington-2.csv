James R.,"Northside District, Lexington, KY",17,7,11,5.0,1/7/2018,"Have been to The Cheesecake Factory several times either dining in or getting cheesecake to go. Whether dining in or getting cheesecake to go the menu is huge! The dine-in menu seems very Guy Fieri inspired, what with its cheddar blasted wasabi infused pretzel bites and beer battered ginger glazed egg roll nibblers. However, i am always able to find something goon the menu.  This time in particular we got cheesecake to-go. Of course there are so many to choose from. There's always the option of taking home a 6-inch regular cheesecake, which is big enough to satisfy even the biggest size queen. However, whenever I go my strategy is to pick one chocolate type cheesecake and a non-chocolate cheesecake.  The first slice I got was Oreo cheesecake. To say it was rich is an understatement. It featured chocolate ganache, a cheesecake layer, Oreo cookies inside and a base layer of chocolate cake. Of course it was delicious and enough for 2 or 3 people to share. A lesser man would have stopped there, but not me. I decided to get another slice. This time the celebration cheesecake. It has cheesecake, birthday cake layers, strawberry and vanilla flavoured mousse and a blue frosting layer as well. Very delicious and rich. I'm going to enjoy this slice in two sittings. Either way, it's worth the trip. Go, have fun, take a date and enjoy!"
Dennis W.,"Lexington, KY",246,163,626,2.0,11/30/2017,"I've been here three times now, and I can honestly say that I'm not impressed with their service and food. My second time here, I visited with a friend. We just wanted some appetizers - specifically, eggrolls. We went for the sampler, but asked for an extra avocado one in place of the salmon. We received the avocado and Cuban, but no southwest. The waiter said he'd fix it, but out came more Cuban rolls. Once again, waiter wanted to fix it. More avocado rolls came out. Finally, the southwest ones arrived but at that point we were just ready to go because we had been there for two hours.  During the visit, I noticed they do Sunday brunch. My hubby and I have it a try a few weeks later. Service was on par, not great. I ordered eggs benedict, and asked the waitress how their poached eggs were turning out. She said perfect since a corporate chef was there doing some training. Food arrives, and the eggs are not poached medium like I requested. So the waitress sent the entire plate back. Joe's don't eating by the time my food arrives. This time, poached hard. They were done, so I ate them but I was not surprised at that point it was messed up.  If you go, just order cheesecake to go. You'll be happier and spend a lot less if you do."
Samara B.,"Lexington, KY",163,380,3354,2.0,10/6/2017,"I don't know why I ever think about coming here. The food is expensive for what it is. The cocktails are super expensive ($10-$12 for a mojito or margarita?!?!?). The service sucks. And the food isn't great, except for the cheesecake.  We ordered the eggroll sampler (4 different types of eggrolls: avocado, salmon, Cuban, Southwest) without the salmon, sub extra avocado. Seemed simpled enough. When it came out, it only had avocado and Cuban. We told the server who wanted to fix it. Then two more Cubans were sent out. Well that wasn't right. So then 2 avocado were sent out. Still not correct. Finally, we got the southwest. By then we were done; we wanted a box and we wanted to leave.  But the pumpkin cheesecake was good."
Brian C.,"Northside District, Lexington, KY",0,2,,3.0,1/7/2018,"Recently went to the Cheesecake Factory on a busy Saturday afternoon. I had never tried the brunch menu since I thought it was only on Sundays but to my surprise it is served both Saturday and Sunday until 2pm. We arrived right at 2:00 pm and were told by the friendly staff that we could still order brunch though they had officially stopped taking brunch orders. I ordered the brunch combo which was eggs made to order, bacon, and pancakes. They were nothing special but definitely good.  My date ordered the French toast which was also good and filling. Once again nothing special but definitely worth ordering again. Overall a good experience with a five star rating on service."
Craig U.,"Lexington, KY",148,309,858,5.0,11/20/2017,"We went here on a rare date night after going to the movies for some cheesecake.  I must say, this is definitely a step up from my usual post-movie Taco Bell.  The cheesecake was excellent, and the staff surprisingly was pretty okay with us just coming in to order dessert.  No eye rolls or excessive waits.  Will have to do this again."
Shannon E.,"Beattyville, KY",23,55,47,4.0,9/23/2017,"If you don't mind an unusually long wait, this is a really good restaurant. The complimentary bread was very welcomed after waiting 45 minutes for a table (granted, there were 7 of us). The brown bread is really delicious, the white tastes okay but is really tough. The nacho appitizer was more than enough for an actual main course (as one guest decided to order).The burgers and fries were awesome. And the pasta dishes were large enough for dinner and lunch the next day! And about that cheesecake...Oh My Goodness!!!...I totally understand how they got their name!! The cheesecake is devine!! Everyone at our table got a different kind and they were ALL amazing!!  Overall:  Pros - Awesome Food, Unbelievable Cheesecake, choices galore, a beautiful restaurant and good service. Cons - LONG wait times and No Free Birthday Dessert (boo!)."
Tina L.,"Lexington, KY",1,100,240,2.0,9/12/2017,"My opinion on this location has changed based on multiple visits that have been a disappointment one after another. The service is not what it once was, its very slow, the servers are not as friendly, the food quality isnt as great as one would expect and the manager is snippy. How they pay attention to cleaning areas has gone down as well. I have been to many others that have been consistant with the service that TCF is known for. This location isnt doing them any favors with how they have changed."
Morris H.,"Lexington, KY",33,4,,2.0,1/7/2018,"The food was ok but the entire service process was terrible. We walked in the door and stood for over 5 minutes while a young man was on the phone. He never acknowledged that we were there until he got off the phone... he said two? And turned around and started walking. We followed him without knowing if we were supposed to or not. He took us to a table laid menus and said nothing. All that was ever said to us was one word ... ""two."" We sat there for another few minutes until our server showed up and wanted to know if we wanted bread? We said yes thinking he might ask about drinks or apps to buy no he walked away, I'm assuming to get bread. After about another 5 minutes he showed up  with bread. Then we ordered drinks and before he walked away I said we want to complete our order. We did place our order and immediately received our drinks. We were not so fortunate with our food. No waiter and no food for 20 to 25 minutes. My wife ordered Monte Cristo and I ordered the French toast with bacon and added potatoes. Our entrees showed up after around 30 minutes by I did not get potatoes or bacon. The food runner who dropped off our food said enjoy. I told her I was still missing food. She sighed and said ""OK."" She came back a couple minutes later with potatoes but no bacon and this time got away before I could get her attention. Still hadn't seen my original server... suddenly my server showed up and wanted to know how all was. I said I was missing bacon. He looked at me and ""yes I think you might have ordered bacon with that. "" It took a few but I got my bacon and all my order at the table. The Monte Christo and French Toast were good but the bacon I had worked so hard to get had obviously been cooked and kept in a warming drawer for hours and wasn't good. After I finished my food I told my wife that I was going to stack all the dishes up at the end of the table and see if that gets them removed. Many servers, managers, hosts and what looked like cooks passed but the leaning tower of Piza remained until our waiter finally came back. All in all our food wasn't too bad but the service was no where equal to the prices paid. I have no desire to return."
Vernus S.,"Vicco, KY",10,47,86,3.0,6/30/2017,"I got spaghetti with meat balls, thank God for salt it was a bit tasteless without it. My wife got meatloaf with mashed potato but who puts gravy on them without asking she doesn't like it. My Son got the filet mignon the best of all. Service a little slow for a slow night to be here. Environment good, not crowded and oh yea the cheesecake was great."
Olivia P.,"Stanford, KY",0,1,1,1.0,12/10/2017,"Didn't have a good experience. Accidentally ordered the wrong thing first, and then when asked to fix it, got a smaller portion of food and didn't put all the ingredients required into it. Not worth the price."
Isa M.,"Georgetown, KY",0,34,88,5.0,6/30/2017,I really enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. I recommend to look up the menu before you get to the restaurant so you have an idea what you want to order before the waiter gets to the table. Otherwise you might have to wait a little for him to come back. It is a very big menu. Take a look at the menu and prices:     If you download the app you can see pictures. That was very helpful. The food is really tasty. Love the Crispy Cuban Rolls and the chicken wings. And I really recommend the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheese Cake.
Klinton B.,"Lexington, KY",177,233,818,4.0,6/25/2017,"The place is very nice inside and makes you feel like your in an exotic restaurant of sorts. I love the lighting and colors inside. There was no wait as we went late and on a rainy night. The menu is over 20 pages so there is probably something you will like. The bread they bring you when you sit down is excellent and the staff was friendly as well. My food was good only the portion size was a bit smaller than I remember but still a lot of food. I did not have a desert. 2 meals, 2 teas, and an app $60+"
Zach C.,"Paintsville, KY",17,11,1,3.0,12/5/2017,"The only reason this restaurant deserves a 3 out of 5 is because of the wide variety of delicious cheesecake. As far as the food goes, don't waste your time. Also if you don't have time to wait at least an hour or hour and a half even after you have been seated, don't eat here."
joelle v.,"Apex, NC",1,7,2,5.0,11/12/2017,"Our family of 5 just ate Sunday Brunch at the Cheesecake Factory at Fayette Mall and throughly enjoyed our meal and the service we received.  We were seated quickly and our waiter, Christopher, was fantastic.  The service we received was superb, very friendly, courteous, and helpful.  Christopher went above and beyond for us.  Thank you!"
Harry W.,"Hattiesburg, MS",0,5,,2.0,10/27/2017,Really wanted a piece of cheesecake so wife and I stopped to get some. Pieces were very small and incredibly overpriced. Cheesecake was good but again no where near worth what we paid.
Lana F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,6,3.0,2/4/2017,"Everyone seems to love Cheesecake Factory and I've never seen the appeal. Grant you, I didn't go there until two weeks ago. That's right, I'd never been, then a friend and I decided to go there for lunch.  Right after being seated the waitress came and invited us to ask her questions. I decided to navigate the 21 page menu by myself. I settled on ordering the calamari and macaroni.  The calamari was over breaded and over fried, which is usually a sign of tough, unmassaged squid. The two sauces it came with were good and covered up the tasteless sea food.  The macaroni was brought out in a cast iron dish. The top was crisp and warm, like all good, country macaroni should be, but underneath it was an ocean of too milky creme. The cheese sauce that usually adds to the macaroni drowned it out and I was disappointed after hearing all the hoopla. What saves Cheesecake Factory is its fish tacos. My sisters birthday was the other day and of course she picked this restaurant. I decided upon the fish tacos with white rice and beans. The fish was panko fried and the sauce they paired it with was excellent. Chopped pepper, avocado and onion brought it all together nicely.  The service was lovely and they sang Happy Birthday to my sister. It's probably not my first choice and I doubt I'll go again unless it's someone else's Birthday."
Meli F.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",0,12,,3.0,5/24/2017,"Got the basil pasta. Noodles were over cooked and hard, and didn't have a lot of chicken on it. Also got the small house salad which was just an average salad with lettuce tomatoes and cucumbers. Wasn't worth the money because it is pretty pricey but it was decent."
Chuck G.,"Lexington, KY",0,45,20,4.0,5/8/2017,We've been here several times and it's kind of hit & miss.  Some servers are great while others not so much.  Same goes for the food.  The menu is huge though!  I've liked every piece of cheesecake that I've tried.
Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,1,1.0,3/15/2017,"This location is the worst of them all. It is ridiculously priced considering Kentucky is a poor state. The customer service needs help and unfortunately after numerous attempts to redeem themselves... I like others just do not like it.  I am from LA and was so estatic when I saw they were opening but the food is mediocre and again over priced. I paid $50 for two meals!!!!! Both were wrong and disgusting. Im good on this location, yall can have it."
Drop D Jimmy ..,"Lexington, KY",0,14,3,2.0,8/7/2017,"I will never go back to this restaurant if i have my way. If i am invited  there for any celebratory occasion (Birthday, anniversary,graduation) i will only order a beer and what they are named after CHEESECAKE!! Food is too expensive to be so mediocre."
Stephanie D.,"Villa Park, IL",0,24,7,1.0,7/20/2017,"Not returning to this location again. I am a celiac so I can not have gluten. I ordered a gluten free item, the roasted chicken with lemon and garlic (came with carrots and mashed potatoes), I made the server aware and she said it'll be no problem, and she made the kitchen aware to prepare my food with caution. Needless to say I got glutened. And now I'm very sick, and on my way to the hospital. If you have any serious food allergies don't eat here!!! Careless cooks and kitchen."
Bill F.,"Campbellsville, KY",0,6,,1.0,10/15/2017,"Service keeps declining.  Came today with my wife for her birthday.  Arrived at 10:45 a.m. Sunday and was seated right away.  Restaurant not busy.  Took the server a few minutes to arrive so we ordered.  After 45 min, still no food.  I asked the server why taking so long.  He said that the kitchen prepared the wrong dish.  Well, why didn't he let us know before I asked??  I asked to speak to the manager.  In a few minutes, the 'cook' came over and said that they prepared the wrong order, but no problem because they would put in the correct order.  Really?  Never saw a manager.  Food finally arrived.  We ate and left and won't be back.  J Alexanders is so much more professional and attention to detail.  CKF needs completely new management.  It's a shame that a restaurant like CKF has to offer such poor service, albeit expensive nonetheless."
Katie F.,"Lexington, KY",11,100,346,3.0,5/5/2016,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory! I don't LOVE it, but I do like it. They have amazing food but it is a little pricey. Their menu is incredible and will take you a while to look through it and decide on your meal. It took quite a while for our waitress to come and get our order but in all honesty, I was kind of glad because I had such a hard time deciding what I wanted. Now, if you already knew what you wanted and had to wait that long it would get really frustrating. Perfect for the indecisive crowd like me though! :)  I like the atmosphere/ambiance of the Cheesecake Factory and an never displeased with the food. I would recommend dining here if you have a little while and want a date night or a more drawn out meal.  As always, their dessert menu never fails! I will say, I was pretty disappointed last night when we went because I absolutely love the strawberry shortcake and of course they were out of biscuits :( I ended up getting the s'mores cheesecake which turned out to be amazing!  Great place. Just a little slow and on the higher end of the price chain but worth it if you are planning to spend a little more and don't mind a wait!!"
Kara G.,"Lexington, KY",0,2,,5.0,10/17/2017,"I am a long time fan of the Cheesecake Factory and now I respect them even more. Tonight I went with two friends, waited for 40 minutes before we were seated then it took another 40 before we got our food, none of which tasted very good. We told the waitress and the kitchen manager completely redid our food and comped it. I have a new respect for the restaurant and definitely be returning."
Michael J.,"Lexington, KY",0,36,,3.0,7/11/2017,Never had a bad experience or bad food and have been there about 5 different times.  But three of those times I only had cheesecake.  Can be a long wait.  Even if u just want cheesecake to go it can be a long wait.  That's why the 3 stars.  It should not take a half hour for a piece of cheesecake no matter how busy they might be.
Jaclyn G.,"Lexington, KY",127,35,12,4.0,11/10/2016,"I'm not a big chain restaurant person, but I do like the Cheesecake Factory for their happy hour!  They have a ton of options to choose from and wine/appetizer specials on weekdays from 4-6pm.  For appetizers, I love their flat breads and avocado eggrolls.  Their staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  I also love their brown/rye bread with salted butter.  Another thing I love to order to-go is their salmon dish on the kids menu.  It's a perfectly sized portion with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  It's delish!"
Jessica H.,"Winchester, KY",73,12,4,1.0,4/30/2017,"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. The servers are rude, it is very un-organized, they told us they didn't have time to box up our food, and when I complained that three other tables had their food before we did the server got very rude with me. Horrible horrible horrible horrible service!!!!!!!! Will NEVER come back again."
Vikki B.,"Lexington, KY",0,20,1,1.0,9/13/2017,"I tried again. I know i shouldnt have but i wanted it to be good. Party of 4 one being a 6 year old. I ordered chips and guac, 6 year old ordered the mini corn dogs, one adult ordered steak medallions and one the steak tacos. I ordered the blood orange martini and there was ZERO alcohol in it. NONE!It was a syrupy mix with a slice of orange in it. The portion of guac and chips was large but had zero taste to it. I ate about 3 bits and quit, wasnt even worth chewing. The chips were to salty and hard as a rock. The one who ordered the steak tacos received chicken instead of steak, had to be replaced. The one with the steak medallions said her order was fine. The 6 year old was in tears when he saw what they considered to be a mini corn dog. There was no way any child could bite that monster of dough it was actually disgusting. So i figured we could at least get some cheesecake. Well mine was frozen in the middle. So i wasted $100 on a birthday dinner for my niece and will never do that again. Just bad food. Not good at all."
Brittany D.,"Lexington, KY",95,62,24,3.0,10/27/2016,I can't lie I've got a soft spot for this chain restaurant. The menu is of course massive. I wanted pasta really bad but asked the server for recommendations from the Skinnylicious menu and was directed toward the Mexican tortilla salad. Great choice! The vinaigrette was very good without all the high calories of most their dishes.
Adam F.,"Lexington, KY",1,9,16,3.0,5/23/2016,"Great food, fun atmosphere despite slightly high prices has made this franchise explode in popularity. My visit to this particular restaurant was no exception Our waitress was prompt and pleasant, she was answered all of our questions, which was helpful in making decision in the massive menu they offer.  I ordered a Ribeye steak, it was cooked perfectly and did not disappoint... It's not going to replace establishments that I have as my top steakhouses but it held it's own. The steak was complimented by mashed potatoes and French which were both well seasoned and tasted freshly prepared.  I ordered a Mai Tai with my meal which was overall good but was slightly too sweet for my tastes.   I concluded my meal with anniversary cheesecake that had layers of dense chocolate cake and original cheesecake garnished with chocolate mousse and some chocolate drizzle. I am big fan of traditional desserts and this is the perfect hybrid of an original cheesecake and a rich chocolate cake.  This restaurant has many bold flavors and could be overpowering to those who are more attracted to subtle tastes but all the dishes seemed to have good balances of different flavors. However, With that said, the size of the menu gives a good variety and does really have something for everyone. The only negative part about my visit was the hole it burned in my wallet and the number of miles I will have to run to burn off just the Cheesecake!"
Heeju S.,"Boston, MA",207,12,25,4.0,7/1/2016,"Great food, great cheesecake. The servers were all very friendly, but service was wicked slow for a not-so-busy weekday dinner.  They do have a birthday dessert special. You can get either a mini birthday sundae or a cheesecake if you let them sing to you"
Miranda H.,"Lexington, KY",0,4,,1.0,8/17/2017,Had a nice time until we asked for a manager she said her name was Jennifer she was super rude she didn't care she talked about us to another employee really loud I felt really disrespected I always have a good time there the last time I went cory was my server and she was great I had some guy and he and that Jennifer was rude I don't know about this place they need to get their manager staff together I will be contacting corporate on Jennifer and this happened a few weeks ago
Jamie M.,"Lexington, KY",124,211,405,5.0,12/3/2014,"I love the cheesecake factory and am so happy we finally got one in Lexington. I've been to the one in Louisville several times. It's usually always busy and some sort of wait so I knew this one would stay that way, not just because it was new, but because of my experience with the on in Louisville. That said, I do agree with others that this one is definitely smaller than the one in Louisville so that will probably cause it to have longer wait times. If you go in expecting the wait then there should be no reason to complain about it. It's a new restaurant and popular and will probably stay that way. Given this, the neat thing is instead of having to sit in the restaurant and wait, they can text you when your table is ready. If you plan around having to wait, you can do some window shopping or actual shopping in the mall and you don't feel like you've wasted your time.  My first visit was on a Saturday about two weeks or so ago. My mom and I were already at the mall early (10amish). We finished our shopping right about 11am so I said lets see how long the wait is. There was a line outside the door, but it was just about 11:05. I think they were trying to seat as they went at first and then decided to check people in and then seat to get the line outside moving. We had about 10-15 minute wait. They texted me when our seat was ready. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Brought the bread out with our drinks and even recommended when we received our meals to go ahead and order the cheesecake if we planned to do so that way we wouldn't have to wait very long for it. Great idea! I had the fish and chips and forgot to take a picture of it. The fish was really light and great flavor. It came with coleslaw and fries. I don't care for coleslaw so I didn't eat that and I failed to ask if I could switch it out with something else. My mom had one of the salads and it looked awesome. The menu can be overwhelming because they have so many options, but the portion sizes are plentiful and most will want a take home box. It is on the pricier side, but it's a great atmosphere. We split the pumpkin and pumpkin pecan cheesecake slice. Wow that was amazing. Like eating pumpkin pie and pecan pie all in one bite. Heaven!"
Kenny C.,"Denver, CO",63,94,41,2.0,1/25/2017,"Well, the only reason it's not a 1 star was due to my server/bartender.  I ordered a drink at the bar which was fine.  I decided to order dinner.  I asked for the Chicken & Avocado Club.  It took some time to come out for being a slow Wed.  When it did, the bread on the bottom was soggy.  Which means it had to been sitting for sometime.  Didn't see a lot of avocado either.  I ate the inside of one half and left the rest.  I mentioned it when he asked how it was, but was still charged for it.  I also ordered a slice of cheesecake which was incredibly SMALL.   The banana slices on the side were bigger than the actual cheesecake. Must have been the last slice.  Overall, very disappointing."
Sarah M.,"Lexington, KY",209,407,2016,5.0,5/14/2016,Always busy but definitely worth the wait. They'll take your number and text you once it's your tables ready and you have about 5-6 minutes to walk back over from the mall. The menu is MASSIVE. The chicken selection's normally my favorite. The Cajun Chicken & Shrimp Jambalaya and the Chicken Farfalle. And the cheesecake is always a plus.
Cathy T.,"Whitehall, MI",19,14,9,4.0,4/20/2017,We had lunch in the outside area. It was a nice pleasant setting with the breeze. Our waitress came after several minutes and apologized as she didn't realize they were also giving her the section we were in. We ordered a pasta dish and Kolby burger dish. My burger was ok but more well done than medium-well which seems important for Kolby beef. We didn't order cheesecake but my husband said the ones he saw served were very large! Overall our experience was medium I'd say but of course we will return since they are the Cheesecake Factory after all!
Cesilee M.,"Lexington, KY",43,61,65,4.0,8/12/2016,"Great food, phenomenal cheesecake!!!!! When it first opened, the food was a bit off & didn't taste up to par. However, it has improved since the opening & we haven't been disappointed since.  Waits to be expected & prices are slightly high BUT the cheesecake is totally worth it"
Colby K.,"Lexington, KY",330,17,,3.0,12/5/2016,"Eh...decent food, nothing to write home about though.  Service was disappointing - SLOW!  Took 45 min for them to cook and bring us a burger and wings.  And the price is too high for the food quality."
Taryn M.,"Louisville, KY",193,132,49,2.0,6/29/2016,"As a Louisvillian who's been going to the Cheesecake Factory for a while, I have to admit I was a little annoyed when my Lexington friends wanted to eat at the Cheesecake Factory while we were in town, but I figured it's all good as I've never been disappointed with the Louisville location.  I ordered the basil pasta, and it was decent, but nothing to write home about. Sorta bland. Two people at our table ordered the chicken and biscuits, and they apparently didn't have any ready at the time and had to make (I guess from scratch, since it took so long!). When they finally did come out, they weren't even cooked completely and they had finished most of their meals. The manager gave us a couple of free pieces of cheesecake for the inconvenience, which was cool, but my boyfriend wasn't much impressed with his meal as it lacked gravy and veggies, which are important to the meal!  Appetizer - fried mac and cheese, was the bomb as always. And cheesecake, which we got to go, was of course good - they better not mess that up, right? The icing on the cake, I left my debit card, and when I called the next day they didn't have it (didn't use it anywhere else after that). Maybe it really was lost, but oh well. All in all, not an absolutely terrible experience, but there are tons of restaurants I would choose in Lexington before going back."
Jessica M.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,4.0,1/24/2017,"The service has always been excellent. The food is okay, but not for what it is priced. The cheesecake is worth every penny."
