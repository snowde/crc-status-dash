Brenda D.,"Nicholasville, KY",0,5,,1.0,2/16/2016,"Horrible service! We waited until well past lunch to avoid crowds.. Waiter was rude after we only ordered appetizers. He brought out our food one order at a time about 10 minutes apart. My son got his food 20-25 minutes after I had mine put in front of me. Waiter said that his order had been given to someone else. My daughters food was overcooked and too salty to eat. Waiter never once asked how our food was, never refilled our waters (glasses were empty) and never apologized or did a manager apologize for the long wait for my child's food. Will never go back to THIS Cheesecake Factory"
Gerri F.,"Lexington, KY",26,44,59,4.0,11/18/2014,"I went to the cheesecake factory at the mall for the 1st time and the 1st time ever to eat at one and for my birthday. It was very busy and crowded. The Cheesecake display was awesome to look at but way to expensive to buy. One would cost from $30 and up. A slice of any of the 30 choices to choice from was $7.95. They had huge menu and in my opinion to many options to pick from. I had the Renee Special which was a turkey sandwich  and a side salad, cream corn soup. This was a huge amount of food for $11. Ice tea cost me $2.95. I choice the Dutch apple and pecan cheesecake huge slice.They even had gluten free section, a skinny selection and breakfeast selection. There was an open bar as well. It was very clean and the staff were very friendly. I would say it would be one of those special occasions for me to go back again for its really costly in my opinion."
David D.,"Versailles, KY",0,3,,2.0,6/1/2015,"3 people in our party, 2 burgers and sandwich to start: side salad was very good, burgers were over cooked, very badly seasoned and little flavor, took about 30 minutes for the burgers and another 10 for the sandwich. 2 Drinks were ok, just mediocre. Cheesecake was excellent, and coffee was fine... our bill was nearly $80, which is ridiculous in my opinion for some serious lack luster food...if you must come here, just stick to dessert."
Garrett V.,"Oceanside, CA",0,1,,3.0,10/22/2015,"First off, this place was way over hyped. The food was good, but for the 100 dollar check for my wife and I just to have an appetizer, dinner and dessert is a little nuts. It was not 120 good if you include a 20% tip. The food was slow, the server was nice but very overwhelmed. I could have enjoyed the same experience at Johnny carinos for a 3 the cost for the same dish I got."
Stephanie M.,"Georgetown, KY",0,5,,5.0,4/23/2015,Really yummy. However I think we will just come for appetizers & cheese cake next time. However our waitress was very nice & helpful. :) definitely returning.
Sarah G.,"Minneapolis, MN",20,18,1,2.0,12/26/2015,Huge portions that are either 1-incredible unhealthy for you or 2-taste awful. I don't know why this place is so busy. I was less than impressed. Get the cheesecake and get out.
Greg K.,"Winchester, KY",14,63,42,3.0,11/16/2014,"Let me start with this. There was 8 of us on a Saturday evening. We got there at 4:52p per the ticket we were given to wait for our table. On the ticket it said 2.5 to 3 hours wait. That was fine. We had shopping to do. They text you when your table is ready which is nice. You have 10 minutes to get back to claim your table. Well 7:52p came around and no text. I went and asked at the hostess stand. They said the times were wrong on the ticket I got. It should've said 3 to 3.5 hours, so they scratched it out and said we'll need to wait. I was not happy. I found a manager and explained what I had been through. He was apologetic and told me we'd be next. Well we weren't. About 35 minutes later we got a table. We sat down around 8:35p. Once we sat down the service was great and so was the food. Make sure when you get there you get the correct wait times written on your ticket otherwise you'll be disappointed like we were. We would've left but everywhere else we called had a 35 to 40 minute wait. That was at 8p.  Bottom line...  Would we go here again?  Yes. Will we wait like we did last time?  No way."
Taylor B.,"Lexington, KY",1,3,,2.0,10/13/2015,"I wonder if I have bad luck at Cheesecake Factory restaurants...this is the 3rd location I've been to and the service was terrible at all 3! One was even in a different state. Is that why the Big Bang Theory always jokes about how Penny is such a bad waitress? Maybe her poor waitressing maintains TCF brand?? First off, Our waiter apparently didn't think our party needed silverware & plates (although we had bread). By the time he discovered we needed silverware (he had to be told), he apparently disagreed we needed plates. He was asked to get these as well but just never got them. We had to flag down a random waiter to get plates. Our own waiter never acknowledged how we magically got plates placed on our table lol. On the plus side, the food was great for the most part. We went to Happy Hour on a Friday and I can now say that I'm obsessed with the Buffalo Blasts....they were perfectly crispy & honestly the best thing I've eaten all month. The Fried Mac & Cheese was also a big hit with the table. We also got free nachos, due to suspiciously soupy crab & artichoke dip we sent back & our waiter bringing out an incorrect appetizer (just roasted artichokes), which were amazing as well."
P I.,"Saint Pete Beach, FL",0,5,,1.0,7/19/2015,Had a chicken salad sandwich today.  Was really spicy - I asked why? Waitress checked with the kitchen - said it was garlic in the mayonnaise.  Yuck.  Sweet potato fries were okay.  This was my third time there - not impressed any of the times.  Too much on the menu for any of the entrees to really be special.
Bryan P.,"Lexington, KY",1,1,,1.0,1/9/2015,CF - Lex continuously put us on hold and didn't take our order after 15 minutes. Two of the three cheesecake chefs didn't wear gloves. One rubbed her nose and the other kept touching the desserts with her bare hands. And didn't ever see one curbside delivery while waiting for 20 minutes on dessert
Patt L.,"Lexington, KY",0,5,,1.0,7/3/2015,"My husband and I had late lunch at Cheesecake Factory Lexington - on workday arrived at 2pm, wait was 50 min, then another 10 min wait for waitress. After ordering, we waited 40 more minutes for the food to come. Almost decided to leave. Food was served with apology for the delay. We ordered hamburger and steak cheese sandwich - good, but nothing really superb, and overpriced. We took our cheesecakes for to go (they were delicious). The restaurant is noisy, tables are too close, I feel like I was having lunch at school cafeteria. Waitress was good, but she had too many tables to be able to manage more efficiently. Overall,  we are disappointed from Cheesecake Factory(Lex) and will not go again."
Carley L.,"Lexington, KY",0,5,,1.0,3/22/2016,"I had dinner last night at this location. I have never had such a terrible experience. The server was rude. I'm not gunna put her name down here because I'm just going to assume she was having a bad day but she was extremely rude. The food took a really long time to come out. She never came back out to check if our food was right or good and honestly it wasn't. I got the Louisiana chicken pasta and it was really bad. I've had it before and it was always great before but last night it tasted watery and bland. The chicken was tough and the meal was just not great. When my dinner companion asked for more water, since the server hadn't shown up from the time she took our order till the food was dropped, she asked for my more water and the server literally responded, ""please and thank you"" in the nastiest tone. The child at our table wanted to substitute carrots with his salmon kids meal. The server acted like this was extremely inconvenient and when the food came out she carelessly mentioned that the carrots would be out soon. For some reason I received my food about 6 minutes before anyone else was served. There was no manager walking around to check if we were okay, which is kinda strange for a restaurant. Needless to say this was an extremely disappointing experience."
Parker L.,"Nicholasville, KY",0,12,,2.0,5/20/2015,What's all th hype?? The food is average.. So what if they give you big portions.. Who wants big when it's not good?? Most of th cheesecakes and layered  with stale boxed layered cake.. Not impressed.
Sue W.,"Lexington, KY",0,9,,4.0,11/23/2014,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factories all over the US....and they are all wonderful!! So happy one is in Lexington now! I know I will be visiting often. Service was fantastic for just opening, food was wonderful.....except my side salad had very bitter leaves of some sort....usually I just take out the bitter leaves and eat on...but not this salad, too much bitter.... when I told the waitress she said that she had heard that....ok, this is the Cheesecake Factory, I expected to have the waitress offer to bring something else, or have a manager inquire or something to replace the salad.....but nothing happened...was this a deal breaker, no....but it was half of my entre (sandwich/salad) and would have been a good courtesy....I guess   I did have room for cheesecake now!  But note to management, advise your service staff and don't let this happen....and kitchen...don't let this get to the customer!"
