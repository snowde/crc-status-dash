Linds H.,"Nicholasville, KY",14,38,7,4.0,2/7/2017,Didn't have any expectations upon arriving except that it would probably be fancier than my taste. It was. It's pricey. I went for lunch and got the pizza and salad. It was pretty basic but surprisingly had a good amount of flavor. Personally I like this place ok  but overall it has a good atmosphere and I think other ppl would like it more than I did.
Mike R.,"Mount Sterling, KY",23,5,,3.0,7/29/2017,"Food is good but way over priced.  Some staff members are a bit grumpy mostly at the take away counter.  When you pay over $50 for one cheesecake you would expect a smile and a thank you. Plus, they won't mix up the selections, only half and half."
Arvin B.,"Lexington, KY",46,398,112,4.0,7/16/2015,"Went to this place today to try out a slice of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, recommended by a youtube food reviewer. I went in to get a carryout order of the cheesecake and felt that I should try the Chinese Chicken Salad as well. Immediately, I was helped out. The gal said it would take 15 minutes and really, I had the order in my hands within less than 10! Speedy customer service.  When I got home, I opened it up and the portion size was HUGE!!!! It also came with free little white curly chinese cruton things and the sesame salad dressing. The cheesecake portion was huge as well. Had taken a fork full of salad and it was delicious! The cheesecake flavor was like a taste of HEAVEN!!!  Backstory (yawn)...The first time I ate at The Cheesecake Factory was when I was in California, very young with my family. So glad one popped up here. Also, to anyone who says it is expensive: Stop being whiny stinges! This place is obviously not tuned to Kentucky's cost of living, as it is HQed in California! If you are as big of a foodie as I am, do some ground work research of the restaurant you want to eat at. Know where it is hqed and history (okay...maybe I am just that nerdy enough to do that~) If you cannot afford to eat at this place, then do not. Stop hating just because you can't pay!!"
Shawn D.,"Lexington, KY",0,11,6,4.0,3/4/2017,"Great selection, pretty good food, little expensive, but they loose a star for the slow service. If your in the mall area it might be just fine if you want to rest your feet for a bit."
Douglas W.,"Lexington, KY",101,10,,3.0,10/23/2016,"Worst service ever. Took almost 45 minutes to get a waffle. Two of the four meals came out wrong. The burger was dried up after the water had it nuked to melt the cheese. Had the manager not come over and apologized,  I would have given one star instead of 3. From now on, I dessert only for us at this Cheesecake Factory."
Kevin S.,"Lexington, KY",17,17,2,3.0,4/19/2016,"I have never felt more indifferently about a restaurant in my life. The Cheesecake factory is the latest major national chain to make its way to Lexington and as such is located conveniently connected to Fayette Mall. It has so so quality of food that is present in all huge chains like this but it is somewhat paradoxically built like a casino buffet in Las Vegas. If Zeus opened an upper middle class restaurant chain, it would look exactly like this, I'm sure. Looking at the menu is an extension of the debate; ""what are we going to eat tonight?"" If you haven't fully made your mind up, just go to the Cheesecake Factory because they're 12 page menu full of nearly every kind of cuisine just short of BBQ (they might have BBQ, I dunno) will certainly give you room to figure it out. It feels odd getting a Cuban sandwich or Jambalaya at an (Italian?) restaurant, but I've done both and can honestly give the Cheese Factory a solid ""meh"". The cheesecake menu is equally robust. I once went to the Coco Cola museum in Atlanta where they had the coke machines from around the world. I'm fairly certain they had less flavor choices than the Cheesecake Factory offers in its deserts. One could try a different cheesecake every night and I'm not sure how many nights that would take but the onset of diabetic comas would make the matter moot."
Pepper T.,"Lexington, KY",60,215,70,1.0,1/3/2015,The husband and I receive the gift card for Christmas and decided we would stop in to get a couple of cheesecakes slices to take home. I called the curbside to go because nowhere on their menu doesn't state they cannot take cheese cake orders over the phone.  After waiting 10 minutes on hold I was told that they could not take my cheesecake only orders and that we would have to come in and order and wait 10 minutes. I think we will be regifting the gift card and stick with our local mom and pop eateries.  What I find absurd is there cheese cake slices are as much if not more than some of their appetizers which you can order to go.
Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1367,1367,6002,2.0,11/24/2014,"This is the smallest Cheesecake Factory that I've ever been to. Maybe that's a big reason why the wait is always so long. The first time that I attempted to eat at this new location was a weekday around noon. The wait was 90 minutes and I decided that I was too hungry to wait.  Here is my opinion on the wait... if you're going to the mall and will be walking around or shopping for the amount of the wait, then it's not a big deal. What is a big deal and a major annoyance, is when people sign in, and wait at the door and just inside the entrance. Both times that I've been there people are doing just that, like they have no clue that they will text you when your seat is available and you have 10 minutes to get there. Not to mention that they stand and stare at the people dining near the entrance and gawking as the cheesecake is brought from the bakery area. The time that I actually stayed and dined.... there wasn't a separate line for the people who just arriving and were signing in and the ones whose tables were ready. So, the ones whose tables were ready seemed to be rudely cutting line, but it's actually a mismanagement that will hopefully be worked out. When you sign in and give your phone number, they give you a receipt to present once they text you to let you know that your table is ready. That is the only organized part about the check in stand. Otherwise, it seems chaotic even though there were four hostesses, only one was taking the names and phone numbers. Finally, I was seated and my drink order was taken and my soda brought immediately. The weird thing was that the waiter continuously grabbed my soda and took off with it to refill it... every time that it was even remotely near the half way mark. It was annoying because it was literally minutes each time until his return. In all of my days of dining out, this was a first... I've never complained about getting refills... until now.  The menu could use less advertisements and more pictures of entrees... until then, hopefully more people will post entree photos on Yelp ;) The waiter was pretty attentive, except we didn't receive the complimentary bread until our appetizer was brought out and the people at the tables on each side of us, who arrived after us, received their food entrees prior to our appetizer... strange. When we finally received the fried avocado egg rolls, they were excellent, just as the last time that I ordered them, in Miami.  For my entree, I ordered the fish tacos and they came out cold and tasteless. My husband ordered a Jamaican shrimp dish that came out piping hot, so I assume that my meal sat while his was being prepared. After the long wait after ordering, I was looking forward to enjoying my meal... not so much.  The entree prices are a bit steep but the sizes are big. For example, my entree of fish tacos, came with four tacos, beans and rice. Everyone was leaving with leftovers. I ordered the Reese Cup cheesecake and it tasted more like peanut butter fudge than Reese Cup or cheesecake, but highly worth a revisit. All in all, I think that the quirks will eventually be worked out."
Rachael F.,"Lexington, KY",0,2,1,1.0,10/16/2016,My husband went in to order us some cheesecake to go. It took him about a total of 20 minutes to get the cheescake. When we got home we discovered that they had given me some sort of pumpkin flavored cheesecake. My husband had clearly ordered me the kahlua cheesecake. Im not sure how they could have messed up such a small order that has nothing to do with pumpkin. Very disapointing to pay 8 dollars for a tiny slice of cheesecake that we didnt order.
Elaine D.,"Lexington, KY",14,477,,4.0,8/6/2015,"Have to give my Harvest Salad 5-Stars as it may be one of the best restaurant salads I've had anywhere.  Billed as an appetizer salad, it's quite large and hearty, given the multitude of generous ingredients -- faro/quinoa, greens apples, grapes, tomatoes, green beans, edamame, marcona almonds, parmesan, chicken (good sized, shaved slices) with a house made vin dressing.  Did I miss anything?  Ate only half the salad so I could manage the cheesecake.  My dinner companion and I shared a slice of the White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut.  There are no bad cheesecakes at the Factory, just a matter of taste.  Owing to the lovely evening, we ate outside,which I find preferable here. Props to Josh, our waiter."
Hurriyat G.,"London, KY",0,16,6,2.0,1/3/2016,"I went to CCF in Lex on 29th Dec with my family to celebrate the birthday of my niece. After a wait of 40 minutes (which was normal) we were shown to a really good table.... Unfortunately, that was the end of all things 'good'.  Our starters were ok... The avocado was soggy and the shrimps were hardly there. In the entree, my Chicken with cashew nuts was burnt and the spices so horribly strong that it burnt my tongue. My sister's pasta was dry, a salmon order was almost raw. The only good and edible thing was the cheese pizza for the kids.. Which apparently they had burnt and had to remake, thus delaying our food and making the other dishes cold.  For desserts, we ordered sundaes and a red velvet cheesecake and an original one. I was stunned to see the shrinkage in size...  Very disappointed this time. But because I've had wonderful experiences in CCF in other cities, I will give this Lex branch just one more chance sometime soon."
Shannon D.,"Lexington, KY",5,72,38,1.0,10/8/2015,"We usually eat here any time that we're in Lexington (once a month at least), but after today we have serious doubts about returning.   The young lady at the hostess station was disinterested at best (more like just plain rude).  After waiting about 15 minutes and then called up to be seated, we were told to wait again.   When the woman finally came to seat us, she instead took another party of two to their table (and who signed in long after we did).   We finally get seated and think that the worst is over, but we were wrong.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our food, and while we were eating we watched the busboy clean and reassemble the little tiny table RIGHT next to us.  Instead of gripping the silverware by the stems, he had his hands ALL OVER the parts that go into customers' mouths - ALL OVER them.  At that point, my husband and I just said a prayer that he hadn't been the one to assemble our table.   I actually went to speak to the manager about it, and although she seemed to be very concerned, I was appalled when I returned to the table after using the restroom only to find out that they seated two unsuspecting customers without ever removing the nasty silverware that the busboy had handled like a barbarian.  Epic fail on management's part.  We felt compelled to warn the women, who immediately asked for brand new and unfingered utensils.   We thought about ordering cheesecake to go (so we could use our own clean silverware), but after waiting another 15-20 minutes after finishing our meal without being offered either a dessert menu or our check, we were just thoroughly disappointed with the overall experience and decided that it was time to go.   As of right now, I doubt that we will return to this location any time soon."
Kriss W.,"Lexington, KY",18,124,172,3.0,1/2/2016,Rolled in after University of Kentucky basketball game.  Add a point for open late! Food was average hubs had a pasta dish I had a couple of small bites.  I would say food is fine. My beer tasted like it had sanitizer in left in the glass. Not a go to for me unless it is the only thing open.
Katherine H.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,3.0,8/14/2017,"Really enjoy the cheesecake, some of the best I've had. We can't afford it often, so it's a really special treat for us to just get some cheesecake to go. Went in last Saturday evening, and ordered two pieces of cheesecake in the to-go line. One of the Coffee and Cream Cheesecake, and one of the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle. Coffee for husband, and white chocolate for me. His was awesome, however, when I got to mine I noticed it was sort of short, if that makes sense. I took a bite, and realized there was no crust in that bite. (LOVE the chocolate cookie crust, makes the cheesecake a little less rich). Took another bite, and didn't have any crust in it... so I lifted the whole piece up and realized there was no crust until you got to the back of the cheesecake- like someone had lifted it and the bottom hadn't come with it. That's not a huge deal- but when you're spending $8 on a piece of cheesecake that you allow yourself once or twice a year, it was super disappointing. Had already been out all day and didn't feel like being that girl to bring back a half-eaten piece of cheesecake for a possible refund. So I just let it be- but I was definitely disappointed I only got part of what I paid for."
Ruth R.,"Alum Creek, WV",4,1,5,5.0,12/21/2014,"We were here on a Saturday night, right before Christmas, so we expected a long wait.  We checked in and gave our name and cell number.  We were giving a wait time of approximately an hr.  Had time to do a little shopping in the mall while we waited.  Approximately 30 mins later, we were texted and returned to the restaurant.   We received excellent service and were pleased with our entire experience.  The food was wonderful and we were even serenaded with a lovely ""Happy Birthday"" song for my son. Very pleased with our waiter, who was extremely accommodating.  Unfortunately, I am bad with names and cannot recall his. Wish we had a Cheesecake Factory in our home town!!"
Laurie A.,"Lexington, KY",11,19,59,5.0,10/24/2014,"Finally, Lexington has a Cheesecake Factory!  If you've ever been to the CcF you know how amazing it is. Do I even need to write a review?? I went on one of the training days and even though cooks, bussers, and wait staff were practicing it was the same service and quality that I have come to expect from the CcF.  If you haven't been to a CcF then what are you waiting for? I recommend perusing the menu online beforehand as it is quite extensive. If you're a party of two I would say expect to spend around $50, more if you order drinks, etc. I'd say our average bill is around $75 whenever we go, which wasn't often. Until now! The ambiance is nice, with low light, and even though the place is usually packed with people it somehow doesn't feel crowded. Portion sizes are generous and more than likely you'll be bringing leftovers home with you.  Favorite app: Tex Mex egg rolls. Favorite entrees: Miso Salmon and Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Favorite Cheesecake: Red Velvet."
Oly M.,"Somset, United Kingdom",25,13,,4.0,6/19/2016,"Great ambience.. Lovely variety and great taste! This place is right outside the mall and is perfect to chill after a exhausting day at the mall.. No matter what you try, you will find it delicious... So far I have tried the Chicken Couscous, the lettuce wrapped Mexican tacos..ley lime cheesecake, the coffe flavoured one -all turned out be great!"
Aaron O.,"Lexington, KY",23,51,122,4.0,8/10/2016,"Had a great experience dining at this location. Our server was great as she made sure we were taken care of without being too pushy. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip which is phenomenal with the bread. My date and I split the BBQ Chicken salad which was pretty good. Oreo Cheesecake was the best part. Love their bar/lounge area happy hour, definitely worth going again and again."
Jennifer K.,"Lexington, KY",551,4,104,5.0,8/30/2015,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory for a late lunch on a Sunday. It wasn't too crowded and not too noisy. The food was good and our server (Jacob) was excellent, attentive and checked on us often but not too often. I had the Avocado Egg Rolls, Cobb Salad and Red Velvet Cheesecake. The servings were quite large so I have food for another meal (or 2)! Will hopefully return in the near future. In my opinion this location is just as others I have been to in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Maryland, North Carolina and Florida!"
Nathan Bradley F.,"Prestonsburg, KY",0,11,,4.0,7/21/2016,You can't go wrong with The Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge and they have something for everyone. I've been here about 10 times and I always try something different. But I always have the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake for dessert. It's one of the best things I've ever eaten. No other cheesecake they have exists to me. I dream about this cheesecake!  The best thing I've had from the dinner menu is probably the Louisiana something Pasta. They have great pasta!  The garlic noodles are also good. The atmosphere can be a bit chaotic at times and I wish it were a little darker. When we don't know what kind of food we're in the mood for we go here.  They're bound to have something you like!
