Jason B.,"Roseville, MI",116,278,1285,4.0,12/1/2014,Let's just say I've been to the cheesecake factory quite a few times before this one open here in Lexington. For a corporate corporation move chains it's pretty decent you know specially being frozen food. But I always do love the service when you come in to the cheesecake factory always top notch always professional and always courteous and polite. The food is always about average Chino just like any other you know chain that you go to but the cheesecake is always what makes this place the cheesecake factory. I always go in and never expect less than perfect when getting served and being treated right. Happy to have one of these in Lexington now. :)
Amy W.,"Lexington, KY",134,207,193,4.0,12/1/2014,"I have a major sweet tooth, so you know that a restaurant devoted to a rich and sugary dessert would earn my repeated patronage!  I have been to this location twice, but I keep forgetting to check in or take pictures.   The high ceilings, art deco lighting fixtures, and servers dressed in shirts and ties give the ambiance of a nice restaurant.  However, the crowds of people casually dressed reminds you that this is a restaurant attached to the mall.   Expect a long wait until everyone who lives in Fayette and the surrounding counties have had their chance to try it out.  The only upside to the long wait is the fact that you don't have to wait at the restaurant with a buzzer, but can roam the mall and you will receive a text when your table is ready. I have had the fettuccine alfredo at this location.  It was okay, but on the plain side.  On my second visit I had the Factory Nachos with spicy chicken as my entrée.  The portion is huge (like all portions at this chain) and delicious!  The tortilla chips are the real deal (made from tortillas cut up and fried it appears).  The flavors of all of the toppings were just incredible.  I love nachos and these have to be my favorite. As for the real reason why people visit this restaurant: the cheesecake is always perfect!  The first time I had the Snickers cheesecake.  It really tasted like a Snickers bar!  It had that salty peaunuty, chocolatey taste!  The flavor that I tried on my second visit was the S'more cheesecake.  The presentation was pleasing with melted marshmallows and graham crackers on top.  This is my favorite flavor yet.  I can't wait to go back and try the pineapple upside down cheesecake.   If you don't want to be eating the same leftovers for your next three meals then I would recommend stopping by and purchasing a slice of cheesecake without the hassle of waiting to dine in."
Brock T.,"Pisgah, OH",88,1,,2.0,5/30/2015,"I was scorned at the host stand because their ""paging system"" via text didn't work correctly. I'm not sure if the number was typed in correctly (she repeated it correctly) or if their system does not support long distance phone numbers.  The main host was rude...tapping her ball point pin on the LCD monitor to get to our reservation after I asked about the wait time. The secondary host "" Yeah! We paged you"" she exclaimed. I Spoke to the manager, he was very nice. I left and did not eat. I'll continue to eat at the Cincinnati location where I live. Horrible customer service makes me lose my appetite. The manager was nice and caring. I was just not seeing the menu appetizing after the way the hosts approached me.  Training is needed."
Tiffany F.,"Virginia Beach, VA",26,7,1,5.0,12/1/2015,I've been here quite a few times & I love coming here. Prices are reasonable for bigger portions that u get. Try their many cheesecakes since they are all delightful no matter which one u get. Weekends are very busy so expect a wait but it's worth it. Service is great as well.
Mew W.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",42,149,417,4.0,10/30/2015,Love the cheesecake. Huge menu - spiral bound.we love the Factory. Can't be beat. Heard you can roam the mall to  wait for table- that should be universal! That's a great idea.
Charles H.,"Lexington, KY",0,10,13,4.0,6/8/2016,"My wife and I ate here on my birthday.  She ordered the fish and chips and I got the bacon bacon cheeseburger.  She got the lunch portion of fish and chips, which was huge!! She couldn't eat it all!  My burger was fat, juicy and stacked with bacon!! Hell yeah!! I finished my meal with some tasty lemonade and cheesecake!"
Alana M.,"Lexington, KY",71,129,320,5.0,10/31/2014,"A wonderful experience! From the time we walked in the door, the staff was excellent! The hostess were amazing! Totally friendly even though it was a mad house in there! I love the idea of them texting you when your table is ready! They said our table would be ready in 50 minutes and we were seated in exactly 50 minutes! We got an excellent waitress... She made sure we had everything we needed!!! The food was on point too!!! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms small plate!!! I LOVE those mushrooms!!! My husband being the picky eater he is, just got the burger, but he loved it all the same! I got the Chicken Madeira. It was really good! I've been to multiple Cheesecake Factory's and have tried alot of items and I will get this again, after I get through the entire 21 page menu :) last but not least, the Cheesecake! I got the Godiva chocolate cheesecake! This is MY cheesecake, from now on, this is all I'm getting!!! It even had chocolate chunks in the Cheesecake!!! Awe man! Delicious! My favorite has always been the strawberry, but I have turned in my resignation and I definitely have a new fave!!!"
William G E.,"Lexington, KY",0,29,18,5.0,10/28/2014,"Attended opening night of new store. Of course was crazy as expected. Waited 2hrs but knew I would. Lexington has been craving this forever. A beautiful place like all. The staff very attentive to us. Food awesome  as knew would be. Had a new check in system which I'm not sure of. Took your cell # and text you. Ok I guess but the flashing pager is hard to beet. The hostess girls had to come into crowd and ask out people's names from check in slip. It's a noisy place and you couldn't hear them and they shouldn't have to holler! So maybe need to think over check in. Small problem to fix. Cheesecake Factory is an experience worth the wait. It will do great here, should have been bigger built maybe. Do go and enjoy!! The food selection is wild and amounts real nice! Thanks for choosing Lexington Ky!"
Justin S.,"Lexington, KY",24,33,,1.0,12/20/2015,"If I were evaluating just the food, it would be more like a 4/5. The problem is that the experience is so much more than the food. I waited until I had been there 3 times to form an opinion, and it's not a good one. They will pack the house no matter what every night of the week, and they know it. They over book and over work their wait staff, so everything takes way too long...and they don't work to make it right when they mess something up. You could walk in and order a slice of pre-made cheesecake to-go & it could still take you over a quarter of an hour to get out of there."
Tony M.,"Lexington, KY",1,41,,2.0,3/19/2016,"Service is really slow, food is okay, I'll rather drive to Louisville and eat at that one. This location is a joke, they need better management."
Sylvia R.,"Nicholasville, KY",4,20,40,5.0,3/12/2015,"I've heard about the Cheesecake Factory, but never had a chance to go. Well my son and I went there for the first time. Amazing food.  Both my son and I enjoyed the food we ordered. The menu is very big and could get overwhelmed by looking at the menu. Our wonderful waiter helped us out. Couldn't believe the size of the plates. It was definitely worth the wait. I recommend that to go without having a tremendous wait is go for lunch or late dinner."
Brian K.,"Lexington, KY",52,72,99,5.0,10/23/2014,"My wife and I were invited to the soft opening tonight.  The food was excellent. The portions were so big that we had to take ""doggie bags"" home.  It was my first visit to this chain.  I'm told this is common for them.  It was a soft opening so there were a few issues so I don't think it is fair to lower my review rating because of them. I highly recommend this restaurant when they open next week. Try the Factory Nachos.  Enough for at least 2 people."
Elisha R.,"Berea, KY",0,21,,4.0,1/22/2015,"Can't really comment on the food or service for dining yet but we have stopped in a few times while out in Lexington to get cheesecake to go. The quality is always great and very tasty. Only thing I've noticed is the rest rooms seem to always be short on supplies such as toilet paper and soaps etc.  Overall probably a great place to go, things look a bit pricy but probably worth stopping in for a special occasion."
Amy N.,"Lexington, KY",0,13,14,1.0,10/26/2015,"I was here with my son on a Saturday afternoon at about 1:30 and though they were very busy we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. I was impressed with the variety on the menu, but found the prices outrageous. However, I had heard that the serving sizes were generous, so I decided to get an appetizer and salad. I asked the waitress a few questions and decided to go with a simple green appetizer salad, which she described as having mixed greens with a variety of veggies on top.  I was very surprised by the low quality of the ingredients, including the pale green lettuce with brown edges, tasteless tomatoes, waxy cucumbers, and stale croutons. The dynamite shrimp were also disappointing- extremely small shrimp made up mostly of tempura batter with a sauce that was not at all spicy. My son ordered the hanger steak and though it was missing the asparagus and had an overly sweet sauce he said it was good; I really don't know how they get away with charging $20 for it though, I expected more for the price. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go, also very expensive @ $7.95, and it took a ridiculous amount of time for our server to bring it out. Overall, the quality of the food was low (especially for the prices), the service was average, the wait for our food (45 minutes!) was shockingly long, and the environment was no better than a casual restaurant. I don't understand the popularity of the place..."
Rachel I.,"Georgetown, KY",12,28,32,4.0,2/6/2015,"Had lunch here last Sunday with my daughter and a friend. Luckily we got in before the midday rush and had no wait. Food was good, I had shepherds pie and we shared lettuce wraps. Service was inconsistent, we had one server who then introduced us to another man who supposedly was helping take care of us, then the female server disappeared for 20 minutes... a little confusing, the food was slow to arrive for lunch service standards, but it is a new restaurant. Overall a good experience."
Elizabeth T.,"Lexington, KY",0,4,,3.0,6/19/2016,"We had terrible service. We did have a table of ten, but service was very slow and we were pretty much ignored when it came to refilling our water. I ordered an egg white omlette after specifically asking if they could make an egg white omlette. When our orders came out after 30 minutes, my omlette was not an egg white omlette so I sent it back. The server never said she was sorry and when I asked her about it, she said it was coming. It did not. My family was finished eating and I still had not gotten my omlette. I went to the hostess stand and asked for the manager. It still took 10 minutes more to get an omlette. Meanwhile the setver is asking about dessert. She was absolutely the worst server ever.  They were not very busy. It was truly an rmbarrassment all around. She did not care and this is the reason I leave this review. We were patient and still, she did not care."
Frank V.,"Prestonsburg, KY",31,4,5,4.0,2/12/2016,"The restaurant was pretty fancy, first time eating there. It was crowded so I knew the place was good. Their menu choices are ridiculous. There has to be at least 100 different dishes and a lot of them sounded great to me! The food is expensive but it's kind of worth is because my plate was huge. I got the chicken Romano and I recommend it! Sadly I didn't try the cheesecake so I'm not sure how good they are. But I'm definitely eating there again my next visit to the city!!"
Sarah R.,"Corbin, KY",46,37,,4.0,5/19/2015,Visited the Cheesecake factory for the first time mainly to see what all the hype was about. I went at 11am so it wasnt crowded yet the staff was friendly and helpful. I knew what I wanted already so no searching through their huge menu. I got the shepherds pie the dinner portion and it was huge enough for two meals and I took half home including the fresh hot bread six pieces of french white and oat wheat which was really good also. Cons were the wait on the food since they werent busy and what I ordered was one of their specialties also I noticed other customers getting tired of the wait. Also they play music basic pop rock but the volume was so loud at times that it was annoying maybe just background music would be better.
Katherine R.,"Nicholasville, KY",0,13,5,2.0,5/8/2015,They've left a few delicious items off the menu from the one in Louisville.  Service was slow and never refilled drinks.  Food took a while to come and was simply meh.  They had to remake my Cuban since it had gotten cold from probably sitting.  Tasted microwaved.  I love the cheesecake and the only reason they didn't get 1 star.  This place won't be first on my list of choices for dinner.  Go to Travitina  next door.  Great food there!
Ryan G.,"Denver, CO",1,16,2,3.0,10/15/2015,Food is good. It's not the gourmet food that brings you in. The cheesecake was delicious as usual. The service itself just did not exist. The waitress would disappear for 20 minutes at a time. The food alone doesn't make the place and with service as lacking as it was doesn't entice me to return.
