Travis W.,"Lexington, KY",18,43,2,1.0,3/14/2015,It is hard to review a place that has a 2 hour wait. We left without dining both times. We have eaten at a CF before so we know the food is good. Large dishes but large prices. We did leave with take out cheese cake but it was $8 per slice. Eight dollars! That is crazy. It was a large slice and it was tasty but it was one slice for $8. If we did not have a gift card we would just write it off as a no go place.
Emily M.,"Lexington, KY",0,15,,1.0,9/6/2016,Worst service ever!!! Our server was Layton and he was absolutely the worst waiter I have ever had....ever!  It took him 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 20 minutes to even take our order.  Our table of 5 waited over an hour to get our food and when it did come he forgot my pizza and side salad.  The salad was suppose to be the first thing that came out and I never even got it.  He said that someone took my food on accident and he would go get me a new one.  After 10 minutes of him not returning I asked for the manager who then told me that they ran out of pizza dough and that's why it was taking so long.  I told him Layton told us that someone took my pizza and he told me not to listen to him.....what?!  When I finally did receive my pizza and salad the rest of the table was done eating.  Layton never cleared our dishes and never came back to take our cheesecake order.  After flagging down the manager yet again we finally were able to order our cheesecake.  It took over 10 minutes to get our bill because Layton was talking to other servers.  I absolutely will not go back.  By far the worst experience ever.
Madison L.,"London, KY",1,10,,3.0,10/17/2015,"When I go to this place, the wait is normally 90 minutes- 2 hours. That's one thing I don't like about this Cheesecake Factory. Besides that, the food has always been great and the cheesecake is fantastic. Also, most of the workers are terrific. The 2nd time I went here, my waiter actually sat down with me and asked if everything is alright with the service/food. I really appreciate the workers respecting the customer. I will be back (but maybe at an earlier time in the day)."
Allen-Stacie B.,"Nicholasville, KY",77,4,,5.0,12/11/2015,Excellent food and staff.  Can't wait to go back!  The blackened salmon and shrimp can't be beat.
Robert E.,"Lexington, KY",38,6,,2.0,4/6/2016,"This is a review of my first visit to this location which occurred Thursday, March 31. Having gone to several CCF's around the country I had certain expectations. Quality in nearly all facets has been relatively uniform and above average. However my experience today, whole possibly an outlier, was disappointing. The lunch I ordered was served with what was essentially raw chicken on top. When I brought this to my servers attention she promptly said that she would replace my meal and send the manager over to speak with us about the inadequacy of the meal. After a very lengthy time the replacement meal was brought by another server. This was thankfully cooked, yet we never saw a manager and our initial server was avoiding our table. Later after trying for a while to get the check we finally got our servers attention and she brought the check. A manager was never sent over, nor we were offered anything for our lost time and inconvenience in waiting for a new meal to come out. This was very poorly handled and with a little initiative on the part of the server or the manager she supposedly informed this review could have been avoided."
Philip A.,"Genoa, OH",29,32,16,4.0,7/16/2015,"Went in for lunch and came out full! First time I have been to this Cheesecake Factory and the service was very good! The food was just as good. The one thing to remember is that the portions are big! So, if you get dessert don't order a huge meal. Ask the server about the size. I would come here again!"
Ashley M.,"Lexington, KY",107,81,402,3.0,7/6/2015,"Three stars because the food did taste good. Between the two of us we had two salads: The Luau & The BBQ-Ranch. These salads were off the lunch menu and were HUGE. Seriously couldn't eat it all. Didn't want such a big portion for the ""lunch""size. Speaking of the menu, it too was HUGE. I don't like having to read more than a couple pages to figure out what I'm going to eat.  I've had better cheesecake. Perhaps the specialty flavors are better than the plain with strawberries? You can buy an entire cheesecake at the Fresh Market for the price of their one-slice. Our wait-staff were friendly. The music too loud and not to my taste. Surprise of the meal: the Mojito. I generally don't like them but this one had a fun twist, pineapple. It turned out to be excellent. Kudos to the bar tender! I may go back to try a specialty cheesecake for a special occasion but I can't justify the cost. I'd rather go to Malones to spend that kind of money in Lexington. No pictures from me on this review. The lighting isn't great and made things look yellow-ish. Unless someone was sitting outside for better lighting all these photos posted by other people that look so clear & bright are not from actual patron's experiences. I just don't believe it."
Don M.,"Versailles, KY",19,30,,2.0,12/12/2014,"My wife and I were really excited to try the new location since we have been to the one in Chicago, St Louis and Vegas.  Always had AWESOME service and food.  This is my review of this location.  The wait was told to me 20-30 minutes.  No problem.  55 minutes later we were finally seated.  Not a problem I get that as it is new.   Our server was there in no time for the drink order.  Things were looking awesome.  He came back few later, answered some questions and took our order.  Now this is where it went down hill.   We ordered an appetizer.  We wait about 24 minutes roughly for the appetizer.  To our surprise they brought out an Entree with the appetizer.  When mentioned to the server (not our waiter for the record) she just looked at us in surprise.  Nothing was said.  Then we asked where the second entree was?  I was told ""I only have two hands.""  We waited another 9 minutes for my overcooked burger to arrive.  I had a salad with it and I ordered dressing.  Did she bring dressing, nope.  I was told it is on it already.  Well I ordered Thousand island which is not a clear dressing and can usually see it on leaves.  Plus the lettuce appeared to be freshly washed.   So after the dressing was brought and yes actually slammed on the table, our server came to check on how things were.  We explained EVERYTHING to him about what was going on.  His jaw hit the floor.  Did he apologize, Nope.  Did he offer to help at all, Nope.  He simply asked if there was anything else we needed.  My wife and I bit our tongues and refused anything further.  We bought cheese cake after dinner, he bagged up the wrong ones.  Did he apologize for that, nope.  He said ""they bagged up the wrong ones.""  If you are going to blame someone else for the mistake then I think you should make sure the people you are lying to cannot see you..... just pointing that out.  He was friendly and seemed to try hard but severly lacks customer service.  I have to say I am not sure if I will go back.  The food was good but the service seemed to have most table looking for more.  Food Great and the take home cheese cake was spectacular.  The food is the only reason for the second star.   Time waiting: 55 minutes (estimate 20-30 minutes) Time from seating to check out: 93 minutes (ordered 2 entrees, appetizer that came with entrees, kind of)   Service 0 stars  Food 5 stars"
Robin H.,"Lexington, KY",18,6,,1.0,1/31/2015,Quoted 2.5 - 3 hour wait for a table at lunch...not sure when the ridiculous wait times will end.
Emily B.,"Lexington, KY",22,259,11,4.0,5/26/2015,"My family rarely goes to chain restaurants, but had received a gift card for the Cheesecake Factory and decided to use it last week.  I was pleasantly surprised that we were immediately greeted and seated in our requested dining area with no wait.  I'd read about service being inconsistent at this location, but our server was great!  We went for an early dinner (about 5:30) on a Monday so they weren't slammed, but by the time we left, he was covering about 6 tables (I've received MUCH worse service at restaurants where the server only covered 2-3), and our water glasses were never empty, he checked in regularly without being invasive, and any requests were promptly met.  We ordered samosas for my son which were very good and came out quickly, a battered chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes for me which was excellent, and the tempura fish tacos for my husband.  The tacos, as well as the beans and rice that accompanied them, were very bland which is what keeps this review from being 5 stars.  Overall though, portions were VERY generous (I ate until I was stuffed and still had half of my dish to take home for lunch the next day), most of the dishes were tasty, and service was really good.  We would certainly return, though probably not during a busier time and we definitely wouldn't order the fish tacos again."
Doug O.,"Big Lake, AK",1,5,1,2.0,12/30/2014,"This is gonna be short and sweet. Waited 4 hrs, got food that wasn't that great, had the expensive jello no bake cheesecake, came out with a $110 check. The waitress was ok though. Never again"
Happy F.,"Lexington, KY",1,35,,3.0,2/11/2015,The food is really good but the service is not. You would think with the seriously long waits the staff would be told to make sure after waiting so long people are taken care of immediately. But they're not. After you get to the table you have to wait forever for someone to wait on you. It's like they don't see you. You may even have to ask for a server. I can't say that it's all really worth it. A lot of places have good food.
Jeremy D.,"Evarts, KY",51,5,,2.0,10/16/2015,Cheese cake is the only thing you should go for.... Forsake every thing else cause it is terrible....however sevice was extremely excellent...... And atmosphere was top notch.
Tammy F.,"Berea, KY",15,45,24,1.0,11/29/2014,Slow horrible service. Too pricey. Noisey. Annoying music. Feels like I'm in a dark dungeon trying to eat. Even the bathroom was dark. Never again
Ernie D.,"Lexington-Fayette, KY",96,127,21,3.0,9/5/2015,"This place is all right. I had a mushroom burger which was pretty good, although it was a bit heavy on the garlic. The Oreo cheesecake was fantastic. Our waitress was great and knew what she was doing. I don't think the place is worth the prices you pay, though, and i'd rather have something comparable somewhere else for less than half the price. I know it's mainly about the name, but I just don't really care about that."
Shelly P.,"Washington, DC",3,29,6,3.0,11/25/2014,"Cheesecake Factory (CF)...what were you thinking when you created your chain's smallest restaurant in Lexington, KY at Fayette Mall?  If square footage of available space was an issue, you could have easily made it two stories, but as it stands now, the minimal seating offered isn't half as large as it needs to be. Ahem.   Excellent hosts/hostesses and the waitstaff are very friendly and helpful.  The food is standard for the chain and as always, their cheesecakes out of this world.  However, our family of 4 waited an hour and a half for a table on a Tuesday.  I want to be clear however, this is not the fault of anyone working there--it's the fault of the Cheesecake Factory company for thinking that tiny space was sufficient for a city with a population of this size.   Luckily-- you have the option of roaming the mall as you wait; so my advice is to come early, put down you name, and then do some shopping.  They take your cell number and send you a text message when your table is ready, so you can wander away from the restaurant premises. Having lived in SF, ATL, and DC and been to CF's in each, this one is 1/4 the size of any of those restaurants."
T H.,"Lawrenceburg, KY",0,39,11,1.0,7/5/2015,"Just had Sunday brunch and it was a horrible experience. Potatoes were obviously cooked twice, they were hard as a rock. Bagel was fifty percent black from being overdone in toaster. The worst thing was the giant clump of hair on the napkin and plate. The reason given was that it must have been from the staff that set the tables last night. So apparently no one checks tables before they serve. Outrageous for $62"
Will R.,"Lexington, KY",0,3,,3.0,5/15/2016,"when i called the cheesecake factory to make a reservation, they told me that i didn't need a reservation as there was not alot of customers at the moment, but when i arrived i had to wait 45 minutes before i got a seat. other than that i thought the food was great if not a bit too expensive."
Bradley And Laci S.,"Boston, MA",1,4,,5.0,12/24/2014,"GREAT EXPERIENCE!!! Food was outstanding! Atmosphere, ambiance, and guest service was exceptional. Extremely well managed!"
Jared S.,"Richmond, KY",3,22,6,2.0,12/19/2014,"Stopped in for my first time here to have lunch. It was moderately busy but it is Christmas time. Seated in 10 minutes which was great but it took the server 10 minutes to get to us to get a drink order and another 7 minutes to receive it and 20 minutes to just get drinks is really too much for me to deal with especially since the server Tyra C. Had only 3 tables. Refills were a pain to get and had to flag other servers down, once the food arrived at our table our server never check on us to ask us how it was or if anything was wrong which would have been nice since I needed ketchup and my girlfriend had already finished her meal by the time I finally got our server to bring it to our table. The food was great which is why I at least gave it 2 stars. Hopefully if I come back I can get a better server which will increase my star rating of this establishment"
