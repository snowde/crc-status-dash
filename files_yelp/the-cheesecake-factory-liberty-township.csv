Katie H.,"Cincinnati, OH",770,1000,3186,5.0,10/23/2017,"Always one of my favorite places. ALWAYS. After having dinner elsewhere, we came here for dessert. We got two slices to go. The weather was perfect for sitting on the green so our little one (who was way too antsy to sit in a high chair) could crawl around.  On this particular trip we chose one slice of Oreo and one of S'mores. But there are so many other amazing choices if those don't sound good to you. Dulche De Leche, Tuxedo, Tiramisu, Reese's, Chocolate Hazelnut. You can't go wrong! And if for some reason you don't like cheesecake, try their Godiva Brownie Sundae!"
Suzanne E.,"Cincinnati, OH",46,5,,3.0,10/28/2017,Food and desserts are excellent  Just the wait on being served your food and checks.  Doesn't matter if you eat in or carry out.  Service just sucks
Jeff J.,"Loveland, OH",59,22,4,5.0,9/9/2017,Ok in fairness we went here after a horrible experience at rodizio grill.  We were there only for drinks and dessert. Our server Jayna was awesome.  A breath of fresh air after what we'd recently experienced.  She was attentive and friendly.  The facility was modern and the decor eclectic.  I described it as what it must be like to be in a cheesecake looking out =) Cheesecake by the way.  This was my first ever visit to the factory so I got the original.  You guys I don't even like cheesecake for the most part but good lord.  It was amazing.  Mediocre draft beer and wine selections but the positives far outweighed the negatives and our awesome server was a big part of that.
Cindy W.,"Cincinnati, OH",220,115,610,5.0,6/16/2017,"Huge fan! You can please everyone in the group with a 20+ page menu! This restaurant offers anything from an appetizer or a side plate to Mexican, Italian pasta, or seafood! Very rarely does a restaurant cross the borders of hitting each food type under one roof-and The Cheesecake Factory does it well.  If you are looking for a smaller version of what is on the menu, check out their Skinnylicious menu. It is basically another condensed version of what is on the regular menu--but slightly cheaper and a bit healthier (less calories).  Of course, you can't go wrong with their various choices of cheesecake! They do not offer samples, but I have never been disappointed with anything brought to the table. In the mood for dessert but do not like cheesecake? No worries! They have some delicious featured desserts as well. Overall, this restaurant has plenty of seating (at the bar or at a table) for large groups or a small family or even a couple's date night. The only other Cheesecake Factory in Cincinnati is in Kenwood, so it is pretty awesome to have another version of this in Liberty Townecenter. Check it out!"
Thatcher H.,"Cincinnati, OH",7,50,21,5.0,11/1/2017,"We stopped here for take-out cheesecake, and then sat in the green outside. This is a beautiful location conveniently located between Dayton and Cincinnati. We got the S'Mores and the Oreo. This is a great combination; I highly recommend it!"
Luis S.,"Liberty Township, OH",273,83,126,1.0,10/13/2017,"So the experience started out badly when we came in and the hostesses had and attitude, as if we were bothering them for coming in. We asked for a booth and ended up getting a small table that was half booth, and so close to the next table over that we had to move it away so we could have a conversation without having to talk loudly. Our waitress was nice, I think she might have been new, since we ordered some alcoholic drinks and they came without ice. We got the NY strip and some Asian steak.  Sad to say, but the food was not very flavorful, nor was it worth the price on the menu. The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because our waitress was really nice and friendly.  Save your money and go to another restaurant, plenty of others near by."
Mike V.,"East Lansing, MI",0,16,17,3.0,7/25/2017,"SLOW is the only word for it.  Came here at 1:30 on a Tuesday for a late lunch, told the bartender I'd be ready to order in 5 minutes but didn't see her for 10 which felt like 20.  I ordered a simple soup, salad,sandwich and it is 20 minutes later and I'm still waiting for anything to show up.  Place is relatively empty. Finally showed up and looks awesome.  Not sure if the overall lack of speed is due to the kitchen or bar staff but this was disappointing considering the time of day and relatively empty restaurant.  The chicken salad sandwich tastes amazing as does the side salad with thousand island dressing, the chicken tortilla soup however is warm at best and nowhere near as hot as it should be.  I was planning on staying and enjoying a piece of cheesecake however the restaurant is entirely too cold, by the way I usually like it cold so I can only imagine how it feels to others, so I decide to get my cheesecake to go. Found my way to my hotel hoping to have a taste of my cheesecake and unfortunately there's no fork in the bag which means I've got to figure something else out, seems like there is no attention to detail at this Cheesecake Factory.  I won't be coming back to this one even though the sandwich salad and cheesecake were pretty tasty. I would give this an overall average three stars experience at best."
Rhonda M.,"Middletown, OH",9,116,318,4.0,1/8/2017,1/8/17 Update: My son & I went for the Sunday brunch menu after church at 12:30 & only waited 5 minutes for a table! I'm guessing the cold temps kept people away?
Henry J.,"Olde West Chester, OH",150,253,96,3.0,6/21/2017,"On consecutive trips here, the kitchen had no bread to serve. Appetizers coming after entree. Seriously?"
Jeff Z.,"Mason, OH",0,2,,2.0,11/19/2017,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Liberty Town Center tonight for the first and last time. We had a party of five that after obtaining our pager for dinner (and being told it would be a 45 minute wait) went to a high top in the bar with hopes to order a drink while we waited together. A full half hour later, no one had greeted us in the bar or even brought us water even after we looked around to try to make eye contact with a server. We noticed the couple next to us waiting with a pager was approached by a young male waiter who brought them waters. When our pager lit up we went to the hostess station and we were then led back to a table that was right behind the five top we had been sitting at in the bar. After a while, our waiter showed up who was the same waiter that had ignored us in the bar for 30 minutes (a younger man with a thick black headband on his forehead). I went to the hostess station and advised them that we would need a different table as we were not going to be served by the same guy that had already ignored us for half an hour. The Manager then appeared at our table asking about the problem and he found us a new table in the restaurant. After sitting at our new table we finally received our drinks 50 minutes after we had arrived (20 minutes at the new table). When our food finally arrived our plates were not placed in front of us but were handed to us, including the ""hot"" plates where we had to put a napkin in our hands to accept the plate. The food was decent, but the overall service and speed of service was the worst I have experienced in the year plus I have been in the Cincinnati area. The manager also never checked back with us after having us transferred out of our original table in the bar. It appears that based upon my experience tonight that the Liberty Town Center Cheesecake Factory is relying on the Cheesecake Factory reputation and the fact that they are in the Liberty Town Center for business. I have been to numerous Cheesecake Factory sites in California to Colorado and have not experienced what happened tonight. I felt really bad dropping $150.00 for service that was that bad with poor management oversight. Will be going to Kenwood in the future as they know what they are doing."
Eric O.,"Liberty Township, OH",3,221,4,5.0,2/12/2017,"Sunday lunch. Everyone enjoyed their food . Pasta, salads , sandwich   , I think we had done of everything .  The deserts are incredible . Service from kitchen is rather slow . Waitress was excellent ."
Brian S.,"West Chester, OH",0,2,,1.0,7/30/2017,"This is the first negative review I have given on yelp. My family and I had a terrible experience at Liberty Center Cheesecake Factory today. Our server took our drink order and then was gone for almost 15 minutes. My wife went to see if we could move to an open booth and look for our server. The server said we could not move and she was ""looking for a sugar caddy"" to go with our drinks. When she finally brought our drinks she brought the manager with her. He proceeded to provide the worst example of management I have seen at a restaurant. He kept asking us what was so wrong with what the server did and what was wrong. I explained that we were seated first in the section and 6 other tables had been seated after us. some of them had drinks already. He explained that was a different server which really made no sense. The biggest thing was he tried to make it our fault. He was not going to take any blame for bad service. I feel like they are so busy they could care less about the individual customer.  We ended up leaving before they even took our meal order."
Mike L.,"Middletown, OH",1,11,,1.0,2/25/2017,"The word is out. The staff and management despise the angry impatient customers packed in the ""waiting area"" for hours waiting to eat. After several bad experiences we're giving up on this location. This poorly designed layout breeds tempers and awkward encounters every night. Steer clear!! Go to kenwood where people can spill out into the mall to help thin out the crowd. I watched a manager lash out at two customers back to back. One was a lady asking for her cheesecake sitting on the counter ready to go. The hostess and waiters seem to follow the lead of management. The majority of our weekend evening experiences have been sub par at best. Tonight was comical. Our waiter was so far out of line, all we could do was laugh... you'll have better service at Arby's or KFC."
Annie B.,"Spring, TX",149,24,4,1.0,2/13/2017,"This has got to be the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to. We got seated within 5 minutes which is great, but we sat there for 15 minutes before even being greeted.  the bread was literally rock solid. Couldn't even break it off of the loaf. The girl came and got our drink order and that took 10 minutes to come back, then we ordered our meals (2 entrees), and that took 25 minutes to get to us and it was literally cold when we got our plates so we sent it back to get heated up. It finally came back 10-15 minutes later. The whole time our waitress was MIA. Didn't receive 1 drink refill or even asked how our food was. She finally came back after we were done eating for 15 minutes and she asked if we wanted cheesecake so we said yes and she brought a menu over. We decided within 2 minutes what we wanted, she didn't come back for over 20 minutes so we decided we were just done and didn't feel like waiting even longer so we asked for the check and didn't receive that for another 10 minutes and once she took the check and card, she didn't come back for 10-15 minutes.  I won't be back."
Cassie G.,"Camp Lejeune, NC",3,32,,5.0,5/17/2017,I love this place. We went for mothers day and was seated immediately. Our waiter was Chad. Let me tell you about a dam good waiter! He was amazing. I could write a whole page on how outstanding his service was.He was genuinely friendly and not too fake! Food was amazing! Drinks were good. I also love this location it's just super cute. My new fav spot
Melinda Y.,"Union, KY",17,86,125,3.0,2/3/2016,"We went here with my in laws on a Wednesday night. At 7pm there was still a 30 to 40 minute wait for 6. I don't usually like going to places like this, but they do have something for everyone.  After finally getting seated, the service was a bit slow. Fortunately, I ordered the kids food for them right off the bat. One thing I like about Cheesecake Factory is their gluten-free options. My kids happily split a burger and fries with a gluten-free bun.  I'm also happy that they have several vegetarian and vegan options. We ordered the made to order guacamole for an appetizer and it was delicious. I ordered the antioxidant salad for my meal and it was excellent. I like that it had a lot of different toppings and a substantial amount of greens. I got the dressing on the side and didn't need a lot of it since the salad was so tasty.  My husband ordered the glazed salmon and really enjoyed it. It was cooked perfectly. For dessert, one kid had a scoop of ice cream and the other had the strawberries which they both loved. Hubby and I got the Reeses cheesecake and were not terribly impressed. It tasted like it had been hanging out in the fridge for a few days. Disappointing for an $8 piece of cheesecake.  The service was sluggish. Our drinks ran low a couple of times and our food took a long time to come out. Overall, the food was good, except for the  cheesecake. It's a good place to go when you have a variety of tastes and people."
Sandra M.,"Mason, OH",1,20,18,5.0,9/18/2016,Went to Cheesecake Factory for dinner and ordered the Meatloaf meal that I heard was delicious. Omg this hearty meal is scrumptious. You get three nice thick slices of meatloaf with mushroom gravy with smothered onions on top. Also included is mash potatoes and succotash which was so so good.
Jonathan H.,"Butler County, OH",23,32,26,3.0,11/15/2015,"This may be the first time my kids meal was better than my entree.  More on that in a moment.  This new location at Liberty Center is beautiful and spacious, but can be a bit loud.  Though seemingly very busy, we walked in a tad early on a Friday night and got seated right away.  Service seemed slow at first but improved right away and the evening was off to a good start.   I had the spicy jambalaya, my wife the fish tacos and my daughter had the kids salmon filet. The fish tacos arrived, $14.50 for four in a rack and quite small.  The small slice of grilled fish was perched on top, with generous heaps of guacamole, lettuce and oddly, in double-wrapped tortillas. Seemed like barely a meal, and during the writing of this review, I double-checked the menu to make sure we weren't whining after accidentally ordering off the appetizer menu.  Nope, fish tacos are a house ""specialty"", disguised as an appetizer. The $17.95 jambalaya seemed stacked high with shrimp and chicken, albeit doused in chopped parsley and paprika.  The sauce was very oily...a mouth-coating that distracted me from the flavor.  I was surprised that this dish had a lot of grilled onions in it.  Too many. Is jambalaya even supposed to have grilled onions?  It didn't work. Chicken and shrimp were soft and tender so I skewered them off the top and expected to find a rice underneath.  Second surprise!  It was a big pile of pasta...does jambalaya come with pasta?  I checked the menu again...whoops that was my miss....it says linguine. Oh well, not horrible, but that's the second dish that seemed light on meat and long on filler ingredients. Maybe I'm nit-picking but I wish this dish had impressed me more.  I love jambalaya. My daughters salmon was a fairly large piece of fish for the kids meal, prepared simply and cooked well.  My wife and I took turns stealing small bites of it...very delicious.  The highlight protein of the evening in my opinion. The green beans, however, were profoundly under cooked...nearly raw.  They crunched on your first, second and third chews....took forever to chew them in fact. We're not a big sweets-loving family, but you can't go to the cheesecake factory and not enjoy a piece of that $8-buck-a-slice cheesecake.  We took ours home and split it three ways, which was plenty for all.  Very rich, very creamy.  Certainly done right.   If cheesecake is your kryptonite, it's probably worth a visit.  Food is middle-of-the-road, but this cheesecake will leave you happy."
Jordan D.,"Guilford, IN",120,16,1,5.0,5/15/2017,Sunday for Mother's Day I took my mom for brunch. I made reservations ahead of time. It was by far the best brunch we have both ever had! She got the eggs Benedict and I had the Belgian waffle. I highly suggest it! The service was great too!
David B.,"Middletown, OH",0,48,1,4.0,12/27/2016,"Went the day after Christmas for lunch and it was crazy busy as expected. The server was very good. I got the Cuban sandwich and it was phenomenal. Everything about it was delicious; the warm crunchy bread, the pork, the ham, the pickles, the melted cheese. My wife got the flat bread from the light menu and she said it was just ok. Look forward to trying other dishes there as some of them sounded very enticing."
Ashlie F.,"Dayton, OH",26,71,214,4.0,10/19/2015,"As a local resident I was invited to participate in the soft opening for the new Cheesecake Factory at Liberty Center. It was a hit and I'm excited for them to be open for business! I live within walking distance, and this is a place I can see us going for happy hour or to carry out dinner. The ambiance is great - what you would expect of a typical Cheesecake Factory. The staff are friendly and eager to make the restaurant a success. The food was just what I expect from Cheesecake Factory - a huge variety of selections and large portions. We ordered the Thai lettuce wraps for our app. For just two people it was very big - so much that we were full by the time our entrees arrived. The pear and endive salad was enticing but lacked flavor, like they forgot something. The California guacamole salad was fresh and flavorful - no dressing required in my opinion. I added grilled shrimp, which were cooked perfectly. Of course, the cheesecake was decadent and fabulous. We ordered the S'mores Galore, which comes topped with toasted marshmallow and a graham cracker. Good job, Cheesecake. We'll be back when you open!"
Heather L.,"Batavia, OH",71,469,579,4.0,11/22/2015,"I say it time and time again, not a huge fan of chains, even though I still eat at them. The Cheesecake factory has consistently good food and this new location was no exception. Impressed that our buzzer worked all the way down by the movie theater so we were able to walk around while waiting. Super nice outdoor seating, although it was too cold on this particular night. I had the chicken madeira which is a huge portion along with the homemade lemonade and s'more cheesecake. Decent service for being so busy as they havent been open very long."
Sirisha I.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,43,23,5.0,10/14/2016,"Wonderful place and very good service. Felt like they care about this place. Food is really great and couldn't eat the portion. Ate southern chicken sandwich appetizer and they are great taste. Never had it before , would recommend going to this Location."
Sharon H.,"Hamilton, OH",0,1,,1.0,2/13/2017,"We went to the Liberty Center location last night to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It's her favorite place to celebrate her birthday. We had a large party, 14, and waited a little over an hour before being seated. I really have no complaints there.....but the night got worse. Some folks ordered salads, after waiting about half hour for our salads we reminded the waitress that we ordered salads, they finally came. Our food came out an hour after we ordered it but then it came out in a couple plates at a time by the time the last of out table got their meal the folks who got their food first were done. We ordered a steak medium well and it was so overdone and dry we sent it back. We hadn't gotten the new steak by the time everyone was done so I told the waitress to forget about it and take it off the bill. We had another order wrong that had to be sent back as well. We asked for a manager, she finally came to the table took the plates back and we never saw her again. When you complain about bad service or have bad food the manager should always come back and check and make sure the situation was rectified, that is basic good service.  My husband was so upset that he got up from the table and went and asked for a manager. That is when he got Nate. Things got way worse. Nate is very condescending and rude, I was shocked at the way he treated us as customers. He insisted our food came out in 30 minutes, that was true only if the waitress rang it in late. He kept asking what do you want me to do? We didn't want a free meal or anything like that we wanted them to be aware of the bad service we received and the impact it had on celebrating my daughter's birthday. Her birthday was completely overshadowed by terrible service that spread like wildfire through our party of 14, every one was aggravated and just wanted to get out of there.  We finally left there at 8:49. We were seated at  6:40 and didn't even have cheesecake....heck we didn't even have appetizers. That's a problem! We were there to celebrate her birthday and didn't even have cheesecake. I WILL NEVER go back to the Liberty Center location. I've never had bad service at the Kenwood location."
T K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,2.0,7/11/2017,"Did The Cheesecake Factory change their Veggie Burger recipe?  I ordered one today like I do every other time I go and it was awful. If it weren't for the fact I was meeting a friend I hadn't seen in a long while and caught up in conversation, I would have definitely said something. I'm sure I was given the wrong item. Just can't imagine what!"
I P.,"Pisgah, OH",2,28,17,2.0,8/15/2016,Horrible service. Worst fettuccine Alfredo ever. I felt like I was just dry pasta. No seasoning in the sauce. Customer service has been horrible the past couple I have been there. I am afraid to go to this cheesecake location because I feel like I am going to be just left at my own table without any service or decent food. Obviously it's pricey! I would probably just trust their cheesecakes for take out.
Melissa M.,"Hamilton, OH",11,27,,3.0,12/5/2016,"Amazing cheesecake ..I'm picky about crust so they have a wide variety of flavors/crust..I do not enjoy the food ..I've tried it on several occasions .its over priced for what it is ...And I just don't see the appeal.The cheesecake is what I go back for ,I love the lemon meringue ,vanilla bean and the key lime mango .The one thing I don't like is the miscommunication between bakery and front counter ..I think the lady in the bakery just dropped the ball..I placed a over the phone order and they wrote it down but never actually put it in the computer.And told my boyfriend i might have called the wrong store ..Then found my order written on a piece of paper ."
Kathy H.,"West Carrollton, OH",8,10,3,1.0,7/22/2016,Happy hour only in bar. 1 drink per person per order. Wait staff and manager were incredibly rude.
Henry B.,"Fairfield, OH",0,6,,1.0,1/18/2017,"More than a week after replying to the Cheesecake Factory's request with my contact information they have chosen not to reach out. This leaves me to believe they only made the request to pretend to care about the problem. That is sad but it does keep me from making a mistake and trying another location, as clearly they have serious issues from the top down in this organization!!"
Chuck S.,"Middletown, OH",9,1,,2.0,7/16/2016,"Food  was  tasteless , I  had  lightly  breaded  chicken  breast  with  mashed  potatoes  and  broccoli . Cheese  cake  was  good ."
Dana M.,"West Chester Township, OH",16,79,24,1.0,5/16/2016,"Took my son and his family, along with my daughter, out for my son's birthday to the Cheesecake factory in Liberty Town Center.  NOT my choice because I'm not fond of chain restaurants and this one did nothing to change my opinion there. First, why is there 15 or more pages to the menu?  My gosh, it took twenty minutes to figure out what to have.  I settled on the Mac n cheese burger (with fried mac and cheese on top).  My son had the Aloha salad minus the peanuts (the waitress made a big deal about leaving off the peanuts but agreed it after some negotiating).  My daughter and daughter in law had the Parm chicken and my granddaughter had a regular cheeseburger.  We waited 40 minutes for our food.  No drink refills offered, so we asked.  We got them eventually.  Food came out and there was no dressing for my son's salad.  Took another 10 minutes to get that.  My burger, that was ordered MEDIUM, came out well done.  I only ate a few bites.  I just told the waitress to take it away.  I didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for a remade burger.  We ordered cheesecake (four pieces) and that took another 30 minutes to arrive.  Cheesecake was good, but we never had a manager to come over to check why I didn't like the burger and the check was the only prompt thing that came to the table when asked.  Bill was $140 plus a $25 tip.  Just a bust all the way around.  Not going back no matter who's birthday it is!"
Tim R.,"Mason, OH",13,38,12,5.0,11/1/2015,"We have always loved Cheesecake Factory and were super excited to know one was opening literally 5 minutes away at the new Liberty Center. We finally went a couple days ago and it met all of our expectations.  The staff doing a great job and the food is delicious as always. Having it so close so we can do carry out for food or just the cheesecake is gl dangerous!!! Our favorite food to get there for me is the BBQ chicken salad, the Louisiana chicken pasta, or any number of the amazing appetizers like the avocado rolls, lettuce wraps, etc. My wife usually gets a salad or the turkey club which are great too.  And of course the cheesecake is perfect. Especially the pineapple upside down, the dulce de leche, and vanilla bean.  Love this place! Be back soon :-)"
Mike S.,"Blue Ash, OH",0,7,,1.0,7/4/2016,"OMG.  My wife always says not to go to a place for things they're not known for. So of course I was immediately skeptical about visiting the restaurant here. Lo and behold they managed to go far below my expectations.  We had no waiter. There was a kid who dropped off food but never asked us what we wanted or if the food was right. Speaking of the food, it was so very wrong, this review wouldn't cover it. Inedible is the word I'd use. We knew we were in for a bad time when a lady who dropped out lettuce wraps said they were made ""without contamination""? To top it all off, even though we complained and the manager removed the meal from our bill, we still had a balance for our drinks.  No one was there to collect our payment. We had to ask a waitress from another table to take our payment.  Bad food, bad service. Can't get worse. Avoid at all costs."
Hannah P.,"Dayton, OH",156,296,28,4.0,12/21/2015,"I had a great meal here on a Monday night. It was very busy but the wait not long for two. Severs were friendly, helpful and prompt. I had a beet goat cheese salad that was very tasty. Great presentation too. I also had some pear blue cheese flatbread that was well made. I'm confident you could find just about anything on the menu, including advertisments, and sadly, high prices."
Sarah D.,"Cincinnati, OH",91,14,1,4.0,1/30/2016,"Impressed! This was my second time back. The wait was long so we snagged seats at the bar so we could make our movie on time. The drinks were the best I've ever ordered from a restaurant, ever. We had a Mai Tai and an Old Fashion. The bartender was SO nice to us despite how crazy busy she was.  I got the skinny enchilada dish. The salad that came with it was the best part ... I mean, it's good, really good. I would order a huge bowl of it if it was on the menu. The enchiladas were so-so but pretty impressive when considering the low calories. Last time I had the chicken/marinara skinny pasta ... That has been my favorite so I'd say go for that if you're in between like I was tonight."
Brianna C.,"Cincinnati, OH",82,25,1,3.0,5/27/2016,"I went here tonight and had an okay experience. We sat outside in the patio area which was really nice and there was no wait which was great. But, our waiter didn't come back often and I ordered my veggie burger plain and it came with the other stuff on it and the employee gave me attitude about fixing their mistake. Overall, the food was alright and I had an okay experience. But, I may choose another location next time!"
Jon W.,"Hamilton, OH",0,5,,2.0,2/20/2016,"Service is terrible.  We've been there a couple of times, and each time the service is terrible.  We even tried to call ahead a carryout order for a piece of cheesecake, and when we got there, it wasn't ready, they screwed it up, and we had to wait in a huge long to pay for it. There are too many restaurant options in West Chester and Liberty Township to bother with this place again."
Joe G.,"West Chester, OH",0,1,,1.0,2/14/2016,"Valeantine Day disappointment.  1PM Sunday, Feb 14.  Wife and I both ordered eggs benedict.  Worst we've ever had. The eggs were HARD BOILED (yes, serious and i have a photo).  english muffin was soggy from a tomato gob, potato cubes were scorched and hard like a rock.  Asked the waitress to take my plate and show the chef but she never came back.  Neither will we. At $52 this place is a bust.  Don't bother going."
Steve B.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,47,19,1.0,3/25/2016,"This place blows, disappointed that this location seems to resting on the reputation of the other Cheese Cake Factory's in the region.   Was here 2 1/2 hours on a Friday night, but the place was not crowded or busy.  This WestChester-Liberty are has to many excellent restaurants around here to settle for lazy, slow, inattentive wait staff.   Horrible service ok food, do yourself a favor and eat someplace else."
Dan S.,"Mason, OH",20,31,,4.0,5/7/2016,"Just ate lunch here with some friends.  I tend to be hesitant towards this chain as it is overpriced in my opinion, but I had a great lunch.  My chorizo omelette was incredible, and our waitress (Mary) was one of the most prompt, efficient, and friendly waitresses I have had anywhere in quite some time.  Will definitely be back!"
