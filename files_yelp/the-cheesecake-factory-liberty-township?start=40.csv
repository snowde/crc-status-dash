Carla H.,"Cincinnati, OH",13,18,3,3.0,11/15/2015,"Really expected a long wait after fighting for a parking spot in the ""very busy on the weekends"" Liberty Center, however we were seated rather quickly. The lobby/cheesecake cabinet area is too small and unorganized for a busy night, but we enjoyed the atmosphere once seated. Having never been in a Cheesecake Factory before, I found the decor and ambiance pleasant enough. They have a huge bar as well for those interested in shots with their cheesecake... Service was pretty good considering the crowd. Menus are far too big in my opinion. Too many choices, so I went with something easy and familiar, the fish tacos. Hubby got the Jambalaya and my daughter ordered the Salmon off the kids menu. The fish tacos looked more like an appetizer, 4 mini tortillas gooped full of guac and a touch of salsa, with a TINY piece of fish perched on top. Black beans and overcooked rice on the side... very disappointing. Fish tacos at Ruby Tuesday's actually blow these away.  Husband's Jambalaya wasn't at all what he expected either. Guess he should have read the fine print.. Linguine in Jambalaya instead of rice?? and swimming in think oil and grilled onions. Eesh. Saving grace was my daughter's Salmon, mashed potatoes and green beans (although these were fresh out of the garden raw). Great portion and delicious- she ate like a queen! She left enough on her plate to help satisfy us hungry peasants, so all was not lost.  I'm not sure if we ordered the worst thing on the menu, but we won't be returning to test that theory. Still hungry, we couldn't leave without hitting the cheesecake counter for a ginormous slice of Oreo style to share at home. Atleast there's that!"
James D.,"Monroe, OH",0,7,,4.0,10/1/2016,"Good atmosphere, expect a 45min wait on weekends. Food is good, drinks are good, service is not the best, they forgot to bring out our appetizer, server was nice at first, I would say this was fake and then became rude by request for dipping sauces or bread."
Tracy S.,"Maineville, OH",43,61,33,5.0,1/10/2016,I went tonight for my birthday dinner. Carlos was one of the best servers I have seen in a long time. He was very knowledgeable about the menu (Which is quite large) he also was very informative on specials and soup of the day.  Portion sizes of items on the menu came up several times in our table of nine dinner selection. Every time a question was asked an informative answer was given. We wanted for nothing. The cheesecake was fantastic as usual! My Husband had the red velvet. I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake. Even though it took a long while to get seated because it was busy. We were happy that it was worth the wait. Keep up the fantastic service & we wish you the very brightest future for your restaurant! Your service was our pleasure. .....Job Well done....
Mari B.,"Middletown, OH",13,16,,5.0,8/17/2016,"Tried for the first time in new location. The cucumber lemonade was great, free refills. I got the tuna sushi which was delicious. My daughter got the mac and cheese, nice and creamy. Our server, Lisa was so nice and attentive. Try the original cheesecake."
Mark S.,"West Chester Township, OH",6,35,1,1.0,12/6/2015,"Food is average like all other Cheesecake Factories. We went on a Sunday night. They weren't that busy. We were sat fairly quick. The fun ends there. AWFUL service!! Save your money. Slow, salads came out with dinner, etc. you name it , they screwed it up."
John A.,"Pisgah, OH",0,3,,2.0,11/29/2015,"Not impressed with this Cheesecake Factory staff. We were treated like an inconvenience between them and their payment. We all felt rushed to finish our meal and leave. Since our meals were not that good, and the atmosphere was not friendly, we gladly left."
Lindsey H.,"Oxford, OH",0,8,,2.0,6/30/2016,"We were seated at 4:50 pm and our surly waitress looked miserable. I asked about the daily specials and she informed me that dinner service did not start until 5 pm. No ""would you like to wait until 5:00 or is the lunch menu okay for you""? Just looking unhappy. At 5 pm we had a new waiter tell us that our original waitress was leaving, and he would be taking care of us. Now we know why our waitress looked so miserable! We were also told by the hostess that her delay in seating us was due to not having any silverware. At 5;15 pm I politely asked where our food was since we had been waiting for nearly 30 minutes and it was not busy. The food -grilled salmon and chicken piccata - was good. But bad service always trumps good food. We took our cheesecake to go so we could leave. Not impressed."
Deborah M.,"Maineville, OH",0,7,5,2.0,5/1/2016,"Went with friends last night , the food the last 2 times has not been that great. Purchased bang bang chicken and shrimp not much flavor.  We had 18 people and more than 1/2 did not care for the food again this time."
J D.,"Mason, OH",0,2,,3.0,5/4/2016,"While the food is decent, the two times I've been here service has been pretty slow. If you're looking for variety and are in no hurry, then this is a good fit. My only complaint on our recent visit was the server could not seem to get our drinks correct. We both order root beer, the first drink my husband got was diet coke. After nearly ten minutes his correct drink came out. Then, towards the end of the meal our drinks were refilled, but this time it was coke. It was an otherwise good experience, just check your drinks."
Julz B.,"Middletown, OH",0,7,,4.0,3/2/2016,"My husband and I went there for the first time for dinner today. Our food was delicious, and our server was very friendly and attentive. I had the factory combo steak Diane and shrimp scampi, and my husband had four cheese pasta with chicken. We also had potstickers for an appetizer and cheesecake for dessert, naturally. We will most likely be back."
J R.,"Dayton, OH",0,15,,3.0,4/21/2016,1 star for service - slow all around. 4-5 star for taste of food. I walked in at 11:10 and they were super slow. The hostess was talking to a server and it took her about 45 seconds to acknowledge me because the server kept talking to her.  It took about six minutes before the server came to my table but only because I had to flag him down. Really did not show any personality just more of an order taker than anything else. The food came out pretty quick and was prepared well.  I got the Parmesan chicken sandwich and it had a nice flavor profile although the bread was excessive and I discarded about half of it - personal preference. The server did check on me once but didn't come back for about six or eight minutes after I was done. I'm certainly glad that I was not in any hurry to get in and out. I got a piece of cheesecake to go and ate most of it in the restaurant and noticed a refrigerator type taste on the top of it. Like the refrigerator need to be cleaned out and/or they need to keep the cheesecakes covered.
