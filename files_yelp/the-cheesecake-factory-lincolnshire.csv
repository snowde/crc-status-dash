Elice L.,"Mundelein, IL",4,36,28,4.0,11/24/2017,"This is a very good place  for a very long time ago. Especially  the steak, and onion rings are all ways delicious chicken  warp is also  one of them. Now this is the Lincolnshire  staff  good service better than old orchard staff.  Other food are a personal preference, but you shouldn't not in this place is the coffee, I would  rather have a  McDonald's coffee. Hear I recommend food's creamy pasta,  steak, burgers, cake type..."
Sherwin C.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",534,910,13465,3.0,12/23/2017,"Similar to other Cheesecake Factory locations, the food here is fresh and light -- but the cooking really isn't anything special. The decor is very nice and the dining room is large but service can be slow at times and the dining room can be noisy. However, the portion sizes are fairly large and prices are reasonable. Definitely come here for the cheesecake, but the other food isn't really anything special."
Jinay S.,"Vernon Hills, IL",109,12,19,5.0,9/30/2017,"I've always been a fan of Cheesecake factory ever since I moved to the United States from India. The problem is today was my first time eating there in almost seven years. The last time I ate at Cheesecake was in Chandler, Arizona. The menu and vegetarian options back then were way different. You may be wondering why I didn't go to Cheesecake in Lincolnshire despite moving so close to the area. My answer: Crazy Waiting times.  Anyway, absolutely amazing ambience and delicious make for a great trip to Cheesecake. My family and I are not big dessert fans so we tend to focus all our attention on the amazing salads and appetizers.  Must try every single salad here along with lettuce wraps, and flat breads. I promise you, you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!"
Jim J.,"Park Ridge, IL",2092,245,728,2.0,1/8/2018,"I have been to a few Cheesecake Factory locations over the years and have always had a good experience.  They are known for giant portions of tasty comfort food.  People flock to this place on weekends and we ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table.  The lobby is pretty cramped and the bar was full, so we just stood by the door. When seated our waitress was frazzled and got to us after a few minutes of bouncing around.  Maybe they were understaffed, but it was 5:30pm on a Saturday. She quickly took our drink order and got them back in 5 min.  She took our orders and our food came out in literally 10 minutes!  Our appetizer never showed up and she made up some excuse about the kitchen messing up.  Our food was cold (how does that happen if it came out so quick) and wasn't very appetizing.  My club sandwich (see pic) was worse than airport food.  It was bland with hard toast, wilted lettuce, minimal meat and a truly sad appearance. The fruit on my son's kids meal sums up the whole meal - no effort.  My small side of fries had no real taste and were room temperature.  I was tempted to complain but didn't want to worsen the waitresses seemingly bad night. I will try to steer my kids away from choosing here again."
Ganga S.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",240,40,61,4.0,1/5/2018,"Great service, great food, great drinks!!! And always GREAT CHEESECAKE. Great place to come with family, friends, or even on a date. NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT! I love that the menu is soooo vast, that every single time I'm able to try something new, and every dish has it's special taste to it which makes every dish different."
Sascha C.,"Sonnenbühl, Germany",46,8,9,5.0,11/12/2017,"Never a disappointment! Sometimes you get to wait, other times you get a table fast. Of course it depends on the day and time, but if you have to wait at Restaurants you know that people like it. The menu is huge and has all kind of food. Pricy but I think it equals the quality. Their cakes are amazing too but my favorite is the bread and butter. I can also recommend the Taco appetizer. Very yummy! All in all a great place to come occasionally to celebrate any event. Even just a Sunday night :)"
Julia J.,"Columbus, OH",158,93,50,4.0,3/26/2017,"Usually come here for dinner but today decided to sit at the bar high tops. The bar TVs are very very small. However, the service was attentive compared to lounge areas at other restaurants.  I wanted a warm dessert after dinner so I ordered the apple crisp. I wish there was less apple and more ice cream because the dish was overwhelmingly sweet without enough ice cream.  Overall, i enjoy the service and food every time I come here."
Tara S.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",11,60,24,2.0,6/6/2017,"Came here for lunch with some coworkers. We sat down around 11:50 and ordered our food by 12:00. We needed to be back at the office by 1, and we figured it was reasonable considering that we were pretty close. It wasn't that busy when we first ordered, but the restaurant slowly started filling in with the lunch rush. Unfortunately, we didn't get our food until 12:40, so I had no time to eat it. I immediately asked for the checks and some boxes to pack up the food, and I told the server that we were in a rush. It took him around another 15 minutes to bring the checks and boxes, and we didn't leave the restaurant until around 1pm. I definitely won't be coming back considering it took around 40 minutes to get our food and we were late getting back to work. At least the food looks tasty...."
Cara M.,"Chicago, IL",53,57,83,4.0,5/12/2017,"I LOVE cheesecake factory. From the bread to the service,I always have a great experience. Although the food was not amazing this time around, it will not stop me from ordering more new items on the menu. We got a new appetizer of hot Nashville chicken nuggets. Our waitress didn't think they were spicy, but she obviously has no problem with hot flavored foods, because it was too spicy for me haha. They also were mostly breading and a super thin layer of chicken. It was weird. If you like chicken nuggets, I suggest not ordering these as there is almost no chicken in it. I got the cauliflower steak. It was good. I don't know if I'll get it again, but it's a great vegetarian option. The couscous on the side was my favorite part. My fiance got the almond crusted salmon salad. He like the salad and the dressing, but was not crazy about the salmon. I don't like fish, so I didn't try it and can't say, but I'm passing the message on."
Katy K.,"Highwood, IL",11,182,170,5.0,3/26/2017,"What a great way to spend a Sunday! My friend and I met up here to catch up. I had heard it was a great place for brunch so we gave it a shot!  Well, we weren't disappointed.  There were plenty of options in the menu. The Cheesecake Factory doesn't lack options. Their menu is like a chapter book. I had the huevos rancheros and a chocolate chip pancake. My friend had a make your own omelet. The food was delicious. Totally hit the spot. Brought out fresh and hot. Everything as ordered. We even ordered a couple pieces of cheesecake to take home to our husband's since they were missing out.  The parking is plentiful and the service was wonderful. Our waiter was attentive. The manager even came by to check on us! A great place to visit on the weekend for a lovely meal away from home with no dishes to do!!!"
Roserry Y.,"Chicago, IL",394,184,102,4.0,4/24/2017,"My mom doesn't like going to chain restaurants when my family goes out to eat, but we ended up coming here for my sister's birthday. It's always so hard to decide on what to get because there are way too many options to choose from (from pasta to burgers to salmon). I like how they include calories for each item on the menu, but it's a little alarming how many calories there are (most entrees are over 1000 calories).  We ordered the tomato basil pasta, lunch portioned spicy chicken chipotle pasta and lunch portioned miso salmon. Even though it took awhile for the food to come out, it was delicious! I'd recommend going with the lunch portions since they're smaller and cheaper.  And of course you can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without getting dessert! I mentioned to our server that it was my sister's birthday and ordered the strawberry shortcake to share. Several servers brought out the dessert with a candle on top and sang to her, which was so sweet. The strawberry shortcake was HUGE and sooo good - three shortcakes with vanilla ice cream sandwiched in the middle of each shortcake, topped with whipped cream and fresh strawberries."
Hayley S.,"Chicago, IL",444,126,62,3.0,2/15/2017,"Cheesecake Factory. I usually cringe at the idea of coming to a place like this because there are so many good, local places to go to. But fine, I went. It wasn't bad. It was actually good. The portions are still outrageously large, especially for lunch. It leaves me wondering how much food they waste. I'm saying this because my mom and I shared the spicy cashew chicken and even we had a few bites remaining. The spice could've been more pronounced, but overall it was a good dish. It's more like ""spicy-ish chicken with a few cashews,"" but hey, this isn't an Asian restaurant -- so I'm not expecting something authentic. Service was alright."
Gabriella P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",110,1,,1.0,10/28/2017,"ZERO OUT OF FIVE: THAT WOULD BE A GENEROUS OPINION.  I actually love this restaurant and was looking forward to a fun night with friends starting at The Cheesecake Factory- but once I left, my once fondness for this restaurant was completely erased.  I specifically chose this location because I figured the Woodfield location would be too crowded on a Friday night (even though it is closer to me), but nonetheless I was optimistic for a good experience and good food.  The food was good, as usual, but I can honestly say this is the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had.  Our waiter was not personable at all, and not in that he was rude or pushy, but more in that he was just completely absent overall. In about a 2 hour and 30 minute span- I probably saw him all of three times- two of those times where I actually had to find someone to grab him or find him myself.  I kindly asked a waitress if she could let him know we needed him at our table, and her response was ""Sorry he is really busy with another party right now."" This was about an hour and a half into the experience- and the table he was ""helping"" had arrived about 30 minutes after us. I didn't realize that a part of waiting on customers was assigning different parties different values. Let's also keep in mind that at this point the time was near 9:30 p.m., and many customers had already left. Even after all of this, we still ordered dessert, and it was at no surprise that it was another 20 minute ordeal just to receive our dessert. Please note also that I SAW our dessert sitting on the counter for about 10 minutes and watched my waiter chat with other staff members, and received my brownie with ""hot fudge"" cold.  At the same time, I understand that restaurants are busy, people get caught up. Once we finished our dessert- no surprise that our waiter went missing again. When I finally caught him standing at the computer, I asked for boxes and separate checks- another 10 minutes.  I always tip above 20%, because as someone who understands how hard it can be to be in a job setting where your performance determines your pay, I believe tipping is important and necessary. But this time, I could not bring myself to give a good tip. The service was awful and we ended up having to miss plans we had after dinner because it took so long to be helped.  Between me and two other friends and about $100 spent, we left a tip that anyone in that profession would find extremely insulting, but at the same degree well-deserved. To call this the worst experience of my life in a restaurant would be a major understatement!!!!!!!!"
Regina J.,"Lindenhurst, IL",10,116,12,2.0,7/21/2017,"I've eaten here several times and I have to say that this is the first time I can honestly say I was disappointed.  I ordered the lettuce wraps, but the first lettuce leaf had a hair on it.  Not sure how other people feel about this, but it turns my stomach.  I tried to make the best of this, and moved the offensive lettuce leaf off to the side, but I just couldn't get past it.  The manager walked by and I showed him the hair and he asked if I wanted some more lettuce.   I said sure, but I should have asked for a different meal (though he did not offer that as an option). He did apologize and bring me more lettuce, but I just couldn't get excited about my meal after that.  He never stopped by again to see how things were and I don't think he told my server that we had a problem since she acted like there were never any issues. I would also like to add that this was at 11:30am, there were hardly any people in the restaurant. My second criticism involves my server.  She was sweet and friendly, but OMG, she must have poured a bottle of cologne over her head before coming to work.  Every time she came by the table I had to stifle a cough.  Once she left, I had to wave the air to try and get the lingering smell away.  A restaurant is just not the place to wear heavy colognes, it really messes up the experience when it overrides the smell of your food.   I hope that this place can get their stuff together.  So disappointed...."
Yavi B.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,3,,2.0,12/28/2017,"The service was good, but the food was not worth the money or my time. I ordered the borito, which was 70 percent rice. It did not taste good. My wife ordered Crispy Pineapple chicken and shrimp. It tasted like cheap Chinese food. All came up to 50 bucks. Almost half of the food went in the trush. What a waste."
Yolanda I.,"Wheeling, IL",0,7,2,5.0,11/24/2017,After long Black Friday shopping lunch ay cheesecake factory is a must. This place will always remind me this time of the year. Every year after black Friday shopping i stop in cheesecake factory restaurant. I love their menu. You can  find anything you want. Of course their signature cheesecake must be consumed by me every time i go there. Of you haven't been there yet please do so.   . .
Jordan E.,"Chicago, IL",348,176,119,4.0,6/30/2017,"Always a great time at this establishment. Though obviously a chain, it never fails to provide a great experience and food. I typically go for their bacon bacon burger, which is delicious with two types of bacon on top. However, this time we split the spinach ricotta flat bread, pasta napoletana, avocado spring rolls, and the farmers salad. All of these were amazing, particularly the flatbread (amazing dough) and the farmers salad (good combo of goat cheese, beets, and nuts). Definitely recommend if you're looking for a reliable meal with a huge menu in the burbs."
Sonia L.,"Schaumburg, IL",290,161,153,4.0,4/12/2017,"So my workmates and I go here all the time and I will say this is one of the more beautiful Cheesecake factories. This time it was my birthday and I just graciously went along with my birthday treat.  I do my best not to frequent chains and if I do I don't usually review then because they are the same across the board. Service is what trips up or boosts a chain. Now that you know my opinion... more than you wanted to know.....I will most likely keep going back to this one. It is again really beautiful, high ceilings, fake but clean and attractive decor, roomy dining even waterside outdoor dining. It is a positive and pleasant place. Service is trained well and typically nice...I have yet to have a bad experience with the waitstaff. Now the food. This last time we went has prompted me to write a review. It sounds silly but I had a craving for a burger but that would have put me fast asleep at my desk so I opted for the turkey burger off the skinnylicious menu. It was juicy delicious! the brioche bun was actually a highlight instead of annoying as the bun often is when its too big on any burger. It was light and tasty and enough to hold down a very thick and yummy turkey burger. toppings are as you like and I always order mayo on the side. I forgot what kind of aoli this was but I did have a taste and it was actually not that bland mayo type of aoli..it actually had some flavor! I think the best part of the burger which I never even think about is the nest of caramelized onion. I think I'll always do it like this at home. Who would think a Cheesecake factory would have such a burger delight!. Came with a side salad which wasn't bad either. I washed it down with a half sweet half un-sweet tea. Then came the embarrassing song and free sundae. ---I would recommend that since it is Cheesecake Factory---a tiny B-day Cheesecake may be more appropriate but it was a free ice cream sundae on my birthday nonetheless. So thanks. It's hard to recommend such places but this one is a happy place...and do have the turkey burger--it's pretty good. So, I can't bash this particular place AWWWW  how sweet. I tried though. Plenty of parking. Quick service. Nice staff. Good food."
Faith H.,"Glenview, IL",225,142,108,5.0,1/23/2017,"Overall, I'm a big fan of Cheesecake Factory. It's a good place for people to go when it's a large group and everyone wants something different. Their menu is so broad and diverse; everyone will be able to find something they like. Their food is consistently good and the prices are decent. That being said, I'm writing this specific review for my experience this past Saturday. My boyfriend and I had our first date here and it was our one-year anniversary. So to be cheesy, we decided to celebrate our anniversary by doing the same exact thing we did on our first date. Dinner at Cheesecake in Lincolnshire and movie at Hawthorn Mall. On our first date, we were super rushed because we were seated right away (it was a weekday) at 5:45 but our movie was at 7:00 and the movie theater is 12-15 minutes away. We decided to plan a little better and decided to get to dinner by 5:15 and go to the movie theater by 7. I know Cheesecake Factory is packed on weekends but I assumed it wouldn't be bad at 5. I was wrong. So wrong. The entire place was packed and we were told that we'd be seated by 6:10. That means we had 35 minutes to get seated, order our food, eat, and get out of there. My boyfriend suggested changing movies or theater or even going to another restaurant but I was adamant that things go exactly as planned. We waited and were indeed seated at 6:10 on the dot. Our waitress, Charneice, came over immediately and asked us if we wanted any drinks. I told our situation and how we had to leave in literally 30 minutes. I expected her to be rude and annoyed but she was AMAZING. She got her ordering pad and said, ""Let's do it, we got this...what do you guys want to order."" We ordered our entrees, drinks, and cheesecake. We told her we wanted the cheesecake to go and she told us that she would also grab out check so that we can pay early and leave as soon as we're ready. We got our food around 6:35 so we told her we would take a few bites and then pack it so if she could please get us to-go containers. She brought over our to-go boxes and we pretty much packed everything after 2 bites and left. We were out the door by 6:43 and I am still amazed by what a fantastic waitress Charneice was. We would not have made our movie without her help. She really saved our anniversary, hahaha. Definitely will be back and will request Charneice!"
Jt P.,"Westerville, OH",20,113,105,4.0,2/15/2017,"This is not my first encounter with TCF. I usually am not a huge fan of anything but the Cheesecake, but had a meeting at work that drug me here.  The food although hit or miss has always seemed very overpriced. The noodles I had inside my Chicken Carbonara were overcooked a bit, but they were insanely busy. Kinda expected.  Very loud and the lights were a bit too dark. For some reason 3/4 of the way through dinner the sound on the music went up about double of what it was.... not sure why. The waiting area / or lack there of - making everyone crowd close to cheesecake counter or inside the foyer was extremely warm. The bartender knows how to make a good Long Island though."
Michelle N.,"Mundelein, IL",38,71,71,2.0,2/12/2017,"Honestly I haven't been here for over 4years... until last night. I used to frequent this location with my parents and it was always something I looked forward to. The cheesecake, atmosphere and other food delights. Last night was most definitely sub par to that. I went with my fiancé at 4pm. We were seated within 3 mins of entering (not upset about that at all). The waiter comes over introduces himself takes the drink order and maybe 10 minutes later returns with the drinks and bread. Another 10 mins goes by. Takes the appetizer order and we can't seem to find the waiter for another 15 to place our entree orders. When the waiter comes back he bumps into my chair , while talking to the table next to us and totally ignores us behind him. I flagged him down while walking by again and he took our entree orders. About 20 mins later the waiter comes back and tells us shift has ended and introduces us to his cover. Now , by this time the restaurant has gotten quite busy because of dinner hour and valentines  day being so close. The new waiter-cover comes back 10 mins later and tells us the food will be out in 5 mins. 10 mins go by and the food finally comes. By this point I'm frustrated and just want to take my food to go and order some cheesecake to go. I couldn't even find the the waiter in our area for another 5 mins. He got us a cheesecake menu , we ordered on the spit then he proceeded for the next 10 mins to come back and forth randomly to tell us the counter was too busy to get the cake. So I asked for the check and we paid. As soon as that check came out you better get the waiter was hanging around more often. We finally got the cake and navigated our way through the sea of people blocking the entrance/exit.  In short, I will not be returning to this location ever again. Thanks for ruining our Valentine's Day dinner for us :( Edited: I have been contacted by Cheesecake Factory. Issue has been taken care of for now. I will still never visit this location again. Maybe northbrook or Schaumburg someday. Not anytime soon as I am still sore about this place. Thank you"
Lawrence S.,"Glenview, IL",0,1,,1.0,9/11/2017,"Once when you ordered chocolate cake ""to go"" it was placed in a large flat plastic container. The cake would lay on its side next to the dollop of whip cream and when you were ready to eat it, there it was in one piece ready to enjoy! Now, they cram the large piece of chocolate cake into the same plastic containers they use for the much smaller slices of cheesecake. The result is the top layer of frosting is plastered to the inside roof of the container and when you open it, the frosting is peeled from the top layer of the cake. It seems like a small issue but when you pay $9.00 for a slice it would be nice to have it intact and in one piece rather than the sticky mess I'm looking at now Go back to the large trays you used before."
Anusha J.,"Gurnee, IL",74,4,1,4.0,3/18/2017,"The aesthetic is great, very calm yet lively atmosphere. The menu is extensive, and even as a vegan I could find options to eat (I ordered the Mexican Taco Salad without sour cream, meat, or cheese and it was nice to be able to eat a meal that wasn't lettuce greens and tomato slices). However, the waitress I was with wasn't vey informed on veganism and first told me I could order the eggplant parmesean without parmesean (but still brought it with cheese), and struggled to order the Taco Salad vegan style. Great service regardless though, and the view outside is stunning!"
Melanie L.,"Murrieta, CA",2,24,1,2.0,8/11/2017,The food was horrible.  Two salads were soggy from the dressing and they put tostadas and chicken under the salad so you have to dig for it like a treasure hunt.  My kids wouldn't even eat their corn dogs and fried shrimp because it was 90% breaking and 10% meat.  I give two stars for decor and great Cheesecake!!!
J W.,"Chicagoland, IL",2,27,31,4.0,8/29/2016,"Plethora of food options with lots & lots of calories.  That said, the Skinnylicious menu and snack portions are the way to go.  You can still enjoy the Factory's good eats and save room for 1/3 a slice of cheesecake. Open and airy restaurant with outside seating options for good weather days.  Service was prompt and courteous.  Our order took a bit longer than expected, but arrived piping hot.  I enjoyed the shrimp tacos, my wife the Jamaican shrimp and our kids had fettuccine Alfredo and the kids chicken platter.  Also my portion was small enough that I was the only one to finish, everyone else took the remainder home along with 2 slices of cake and 1 cheesecake to share. We will be back and suggest the Cheesecake Factory when it's not peak eating time (e.g., Friday and Saturday nights, Sunday for brunch)."
Sara B.,"Wonder Lake, IL",21,5,1,1.0,10/29/2017,One of my favorite restaurants but for some reason this location is my least favorite. Every time I've attempted to have dinner here they are out of What I order. Being vegetarian it's frustrating to not be able to get what you like especially driving over 40 min to not even be accommodated. Very disappointing for my third visit here to leave unhappy with what I end up ordering
Barney S.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,6,1,1.0,8/26/2017,"Went here with my family around 4pm on a Saturday. 2 adults and a baby. 10 tables occupied max. More personnel than clientele. We were supposed to get seated quickly on the patio. Waited 10 minutes, asked whats going on. Should be 5 more minutes. 10 minutes later I asked again how much longer and why we're not getting seated on an empty patio - all tables are dirty,  waiting on a busboy to clean one. Never saw a busboy try to clean a table for the 20 minutes we were there. Got up and left."
Anita H.,"Techny, IL",4,2,24,1.0,8/3/2017,"We love cheesecake and understand it's super busy most of the time. I was not being pushy and just curious to how much time we had left to wait. The host was so rude. I understand when things are busy, it can be hard... but don't respond to me with sarcasm and give me a dirty look. This is the second host who was rude there. I will not be going to that cheesecake again."
Miguel H.,"Deerfield, IL",0,2,,5.0,6/8/2017,One of my favorite restaurants always good to go to. Had a Louisiana chicken pasta was extremely delicious. Service was great
Sharlene M.,"Wheeling, IL",1,34,,4.0,8/13/2017,"Service was slow. Took more then 5 minutes for us to get acknowledged. Food was good, not great but it was good just needed more flavor. The cheesecake was great"
Vilmos ..,"Abingdon, IL",3,27,3,4.0,2/13/2017,"This was my first experience with The Cheesecake Factory. It was Saturday lunch and we came in around noon and were seated immediately even thought it appeared to be very full. As it turned out when we left there was a long waiting line so we must have come in just in time. It took about an hour and a half from start to finish.  The facility is very elegant. Very high ceilings with great decoration. Aside from making me feel like I was in a very large room, it also helped keep the sounds around us down.  While our service was good I felt it was a little slow which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. This is not to say that our server did not do a good job, she checked in with us in a regular basis but the flow of the food was slow. We found ourselves waiting for the next item a little too long.  The food was good and the menu extremely large. I ended up choosing one of the featured items because there were so many choices I got tired flipping through the enemy ""book."". The final cost was a little more that I would normally pay but overall it was a good experience."
Stephanie S.,"Orlando, FL",85,2,,1.0,7/28/2017,"We came in at 10pm, so the restaurant was fairly empty. Fabiana took 15 minutes to greet our table, wasnt very pleasant, our food came out wrong, and was hard to get a hold of if we needed anything. I love Cheesecake Factory, their food is always so great. Just do yourself a favor and don't have her as your server if you can help it. I, myself, am a server so I understand how the business works."
Maddie H.,"Round Lake, IL",3,22,6,1.0,6/23/2017,"Beware of the service here. We waited for over ten minutes at our table for our server to even come and greet us. We saw her standing through the door looking at us for a good two minutes before she walked up, without introducing herself, and blatantly stated ""what can I get for you to drink"". Her attire was messy and stained and her shirt was dirty and half-tucked in, which from the start gave a bad impression. She seemed completely annoyed to be serving us. Working in a restaurant myself I'm a very patient person but this lady was horrible."
Nicole L.,"Grayslake, IL",0,2,,5.0,9/27/2017,We love cheescake factory my husband and I we have the best dinner Friday night with out beautiful server yessica she is so friendly and her accent is so cute she is our best server we ever got
Rakesh R.,"Binghamton, NY",21,7,,4.0,12/21/2016,We went here for a team lunch. These are the pros and cons about this restaurant. Pros: The ambience here was very good.  When comes to the service it was good but it was hard to understand the waiter.  One thing you should definitely visit this restaurant because they have huge number of cheesecake varieties as well as the entrees. Cons: The item in the menu said very spicy but actually when you get it was very sweet. The item I ordered was very *spicy cashew chicken* over brown rice. The sauce on the chicken was too sweet and was hard to eat.  Overall the experience here was quite good (although I was disappointed with the entree). I would rate this as a good restaurant you can visit with your friends and family.
Julia W.,"Johnsburg, IL",58,3,,4.0,7/9/2017,"Very good service and food, but would not buy pot stickers again. Only 4 small pot stickers for $10.95, delicious but not worth the price."
Tanya A.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",37,198,243,3.0,4/12/2016,"So Cheesecake Factory is the UNHEALTHIEST restaurant in America! Nothing you get is remotely good for you.  Nevertheless, the staff at this location are great! They are always very friendly and helpful whether you're dining in, or using curbside pickup. They are always on top of the game. I just hope they don't eat there. Officially boycotted. Thanks for all the great years!"
Katherine S.,"Vernon Hills, IL",149,2,,1.0,6/3/2017,"They will tell you the wait will be 30 minutes, but you will actually be there for waiting for over an hour. Decent food, but not worth the lies they tell you about the wait time."
Harris P.,"Stockbridge, GA",138,3,,5.0,5/23/2017,Cannot say enough good things about this place. Easily one of the greatest restaurants I have ever eaten at. I have had several items on the menu and all of them have been amazing!
Alexandra J.,"Willow Springs, IL",9,9,18,4.0,4/28/2017,This place never disappoints and it's surprising because of the large menu and options. I got the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was bomb! Our waiter was super friendly and the service was quick. Only giving four stars because I asked for broccoli instead of asparagus which I did not receive. Overall I'm happy with everything.
