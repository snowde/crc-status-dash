Tita P.,"Chicago, IL",146,252,,3.0,2/8/2009,"What can you really say about a chain restaurant?  Well I can say that they really serve good breakfast.  My friend and I decided to go to Cheesecake Factory because our first choice was way too crowded.   Well we made a good choice.  We sat at the bar and I had my much needed coffee.  She had OJ, fresh squeezed.  I had a spinach, bacon, mushroom, and cheese omelet.  She had french toast.  We left full and very satisfied.   The food was good, the service was attentive and we managed to leave without cheesecake so we did not feel too guilty."
Dave V.,"Palatine, IL",110,469,96,3.0,10/2/2011,"Our waiter was very accommodating and a very nice guy. Food was good withe exception of the bad chicken cuts, too much cartilage. Table was so tiny and slippery. our drinks and plates kept sliding around. All this together made it difficult to enjoy our date night. Will continue visiting the location in old orchard though."
Rob B.,"Chicago, IL",19,29,9,4.0,6/11/2009,"A very safe lunch place. We go on occasion for a lunch outing and have never been let down. I know the food is full of sugar and salt and everything else that will send me to an early grave, but for now, it makes for good eats. It's uniquely decorated and the wait staff is well trained which makes for a nice time. The portions are sizeable and after tasting lots of different items off of the expansive menu, I'm still impressed. Cashew Chicken = yum. Sheperds Pie = yum. Southwest Egg Rolls = yum. Be ready to bring leftovers back to the office!"
Dexter M.,"Boston, MA",0,73,16,4.0,1/1/2012,"I'm not sure why I'm writing a review, It's the Cheese Cake Factory,,, the menu is huge (almost to the point where is its hard to pick what you want. The food is good, the service is okay."
Anthony P.,"Lake Zurich, IL",8,28,8,4.0,9/21/2009,"We arrived for dinner around 5:45pm on a Sat night and was quickly seated at a small table under a palm tree. The environment was nice and the service was very prompt. We ordered a factory peach bellini to share and it was tasty (sort of like a fuzzy navel). As recommended by other yelpers, we got the avocado rolls and they were quite tasty. I ordered the Shrimp Bistro pasta which was also very tasty and flavorful and my wife ordered the Fish Tacos, though she would not order the dish again. Based on the recommendation of our waitress, we got the carrot cake cheesecake and it was delicious. We are fans of both cakes so it only made sense to combine them ;) Overall, we enjoyed our visit and would definitely come back to try other items on the menu, though next time we may order 2 appetizers and 1 entree as the portions are HUGE! We barely dented our entrees, but had to save room for dessert ;)"
Mary S.,"Downers Grove, IL",1,7,,5.0,11/8/2008,"I've gone here SEVERAL time when I visit family friends.  There are pros and cons to the place.   One good thing about this cheesecake factory is there there is NEVER a line to get a seat!  ONCE we had to wait 15 mins, but it was because we had a fairly large party and they needed to get the large table cleared.   The service is usually great, the staff checks in on you all the time. The food is USUALLY AWESOME!  and so are the bar drinks!   Of course its a bit pricey here, but hey, it's cheesecake factory, what do you expect, it's better quality than a cheap place. The last time a went here though the food was horrible.  I ordered the 3 cheese pasta.  The noodles were under cooked and still hard, and there was almost NO sause on the pasta!  My husband ordered the steak which had a funny smell to it.  Since we had been here MANY times before we knew this wasn't up to their usual par, so we had them take the food back.  They were happy to reaplace it and take it off our bill.  Since I usually have such a GREAT experience here I have to wonder if maybe they had a new cook or something that night.   I haven't been back since that night, but I won't let it keep me away, I would def. go back here!"

Sarah L.,"Holland, MI",182,428,3,3.0,11/12/2008,"I have been here a couple of times, I was recently here a couple of weeks ago. My husband and I were seated next to a table of ""moms"" catching up on the neighborhood gossip. They were cackling and hooo-ing and haaa-ing so we asked to be moved. We wanted to enjoy our dinner in peace and quiet. Our waiter gladly moved us and we were happy campers!  The food is the same no matter what Cheesecake Factory you go to. The menu is enormous and it's sometimes hard to pick out something to eat. This time I settled on the crab cake sandwich. It was HUGE and it was falling apart. It kind of reminded me of tuna salad and I really wasn't a fan. I ended up eating the ""crab cake"" and ditching the bread. They give you a million fries and I left those behind as well. Hubs had the club and that's the most standard thing on the menu. I should have been bold and gotten the Ahi tuna salad.  We didn't get cheesecake because we didn't want to gorge. My favorite cheesecake(s) from the CF are the Snickers, peanut buttercup, and the plain with strawberries. No matter the cheesecake flavor you will find something to satisfy your sweet tooth. The shopping around this location is awesome! DSW, White House/Black Market along with a massive Barnes and Noble, I'm in heaven!"
Stephanie D.,"Libertyville, IL",0,12,3,3.0,12/29/2012,"Have always been a huge fan of this place.  Lots to choose from and great atmosphere. Service is usually pretty good, but last night had a bad experience getting seated. It was VERY crowded on a Friday night. Host said 45 minutes. At that time, our buzzer rang. We went to the hostess stand and stood for another ten minutes. Apparently the table they wanted for us was not ready.  Finally the host walked us to a table, but it was also not ready.  She wandered around until she found a table that was in the process of being set.  Awkward!"
Allyson D.,"New York, NY",27,71,,4.0,9/20/2008,"I've been there twice. The first time I went, I had a pineapple pisco sour, which was delicious. I was actually shocked that they had such a diverse and eclectic selection of alcohol - Pisco is the national beverage of Peru. I ordered the Chicken Piccata, and they went really cheap with the capers. There were probably 5 on my dish. The next time I went, I ordered my meal with extra capers and I finally got enough."
M C.,"Wellesley Hills, MA",1,5,,5.0,9/17/2010,"Wide variety food for EVERYONE.   Food is great.  Service is top notch.  We love Sunday brunch- it's never crowded (unlike Walker Brothers or Wildberry).  Steak and Eggs are delicious!  And the lemon-ricotta pancakes are just amazing.  On a normal night, try chicken marsala, or the fish tacos.  The artichoke heart appetizers are fantastic.  Just about anything on the menu is delicious.  With a family of 6- the wide array of delicious food, large portion sizes, and the family friendly atmosphere this place ranks top-notch in my book!!!"
Chase K.,"Chicago, IL",1,24,3,4.0,6/7/2011,"This place has much nicer staff than Woodfield and a lot more to offer such as scenic seating next to floor to ceiling windows overlooking a landscaped pond, or outdoor seating to really get a great view.  I made a comment to one of the servers about how terrible Woodfield has become and they have mentioned many customers say the same thing."
LaWanna O.,"Libertyville, IL",22,30,6,5.0,2/22/2011,"What is there to not say about Cheese cake factory, everything I had Mmm mmm good! The fried mac & cheese is to die for, also the crab cakes. The bistro shrimp pasta & chicken marsala are two of my favorites!"
Bruce H.,"Lake Forest, IL",104,14,24,5.0,4/26/2011,"This is my ""go to"" place whenever I feel like a nice relaxed afternoon lunch. I usually arrive between the lunch and dinner rush on the weekend. Rarely, if ever, have to wait for a table. The bread is a great start, but you've got to get it right after it comes out of the oven. The portions are large, even the burger & fries. I always split the 30th anniversary cheesecake and usually get at least one to-go box."
Tara M.,"Des Plaines, IL",91,355,7,4.0,11/15/2007,"Okay, so I gave Cheesecake a second chance and thoroughly enjoyed the experience... but when and where you go makes a difference.  I stopped in at this locale on a Monday night for dinner.  While I wasn't looking forward to going, because the Cheesecake at Old Orchard did nothing for me, I was willing to give it a second go 'round. Anyway, on a Monday night at 7:00 pm, it was relatively quiet in the restaurant, no wait to be seated and not so loud that we couldn't have a conversation. Our server was a cute, up-beat guy who was attentive (not annoying) and helpful (when asked questions).  I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad and it was absolutely wonderful!  There was a lot, too much too eat at one sitting (but because the dressing is on the salad for you, it will lose it's freshness if you bring home leftovers).  Anyway... very tasty.  My friend had a burger which she said was very tasty."
nicole h.,"Cary, IL",37,247,,4.0,2/22/2010,"I love the food at the Cheesecake Factory.  The menu is like a novel and there's something for everyone.  The prices are crazy reasonable for the gigantic portions.  Do your waistline a favor and just pack up half of your plate to-go right away.  The miso salmon is my absolute favorite.  I've got one serious bone to pick with the place though--they don't take reservations and I freaking hate that.  While I understand that they don't necessarily have to because they usually have a full house anyway, it makes it really difficult when planning a meal for a large group."
C C.,"Northbrook, IL",21,5,,4.0,6/7/2011,"My second time eating there and I love it. Would give it 5 stars but this time it was so busy our food took awhile. We ordered the fried macaroni cheese balls as an appetizer - so good, then I ordered the pan fried salmon, my husband had the jumbalaya, my son shephard pie, and my daughter the kids alfredo pasta. Everything was so good, huge portions, my son couldn't finish it - and he has an enormous appetite, and we had to doggie bag all of it. One minor complaint besides the wait, the jumbalaya wasn't spicy enough. Then the best for last, dessert! We ordered the red velvet cheesecake - too die for! So yummy, it was the major reason we went to the Cheesecake Factory for my birthday. Also, I had ordered the strawberry creamsicle, which is basically an alcoholic strawberry milkshake - not bad."
J D.,"Chicago, IL",0,29,,2.0,1/16/2013,"Okay, I am only writing a review because this is my second not so fabulous visit to this location and I am frankly a tad annoyed at the slapdash quality of the Cheesecake bunch.  My first visit issues: salmon filet was undercooked, no attempt to offer a beverage, dessert etc. in recompense for raw fish. On the same visit we entered the ladies room, finding paper towels strewn about the floor, no paper in the stalls and a leaky toilet. An elderly woman was complaining when I came out of my stall, so we hunted down some paper from another. I am not an elderly gal, but it was gross to me as well and seemed odd, even on a busy holiday. So, off I went to let the powers that be know. I told a manager(?) at the front desk (and I was nice, I promise) who then barked at me ""Yeah, we know! We'll clean it as soon as possible."". Wow, really? Now, I did notice that almost all the staff were very young and frankly didn't seem to be Olympians in the customer service realm. But this IS a restaurant, right? Second visit was today: Same childlike crew, waiter was really young, with the whole 80's über cheerful thing going on, no problem. We order and just asking for a sauce on the side seemed to flummox him. Again, not an issue. However, my table mate's appetizer came, and IMMEDIATELY following, came her meal. Huh. I looked at the manager(?), who was setting it down and the waiter hovering as well, and just said ""oh"", was then asked if all was okay and I said I had presumed the meal would have come later. The waiter replied, ""I thought you wanted it all at once."" Huh. We would want an appetizer and meal all at once because......????? Neither of us asked for that so the presumption was based on.....????? HIS eating preferences?  So, Cheesecake corporation, you may want to spend a dime or two on more experienced staff....on all fronts. You are the only suburban sit down game in town with as vast a menu, so I know you have the coinage to step it up. Oh, and this is personal preference, but could you get an actually HEALTHY menu, not just a low calorie one? We are of an enlightened age, so maybe some things without mayonnaise, high sodium, cheese and fried stuff would make us artery conscious folks happy. Or maybe someone could open a really great simple sit down deli in the suburbs. I beg of you. Please serve wine."
Justin G.,"San Diego, CA",74,635,,5.0,11/8/2007,"I agree with Laura O. and Andrew P.  The lights are a bit dim and the menu is large, and it is a good place to go when you have a group that likes different things.  I originally thought it was just a dessert place by the name, but damn was I wrong.   Portions are big and filling, and everyone in my group of 14 seemed to be pretty satisfied with their meals."
Vira K.,"Gurnee, IL",1,6,,5.0,12/4/2010,"Love this place. Every time I went there I had a great experience. I usually go there with my hubby and few times we took the kids as well. Great atmosphere, the food is delicious, never been disappointed with any of the dishes."
