Michelle F.,"Schaumburg, IL",174,722,1961,4.0,8/31/2012,"I have been to a couple other cheesecake factories in the past, but this one is one of the best!! The only downside to the menu is the size of the menu.  It's a great problem to have, really, but it makes it really hard to narrow down what you want to eat when you're starving and looking at the menu. I know, I know.  First world problems... We were seated right away on a Thursday evening--we had the choice of indoor or outdoor.  We chose outdoor because we know our days of outdoor seating are limited ::cue the waterworks:: It took a little while for our waiter to notice we were there, but from then on out, he was extremely attentive and great.  He brought us everything we needed in a timely fashion, and he was really on top of things.  Oh, and the complimentary bread was so fresh, crispy, and HOT.  Loved it. So in order to streamline our ordering, we decided to look off of the skinny menu.  It's a pretty comprehensive menu in itself!  We ordered the mexican ""tacos"" as an appetizer.  They were actually Mexican lettuce wraps, and you didn't even miss the tortilla, quite honestly!  It had just the right amount of spice and flavor.  YUM! For my meal, I got the turkey burger, no mayo (but when it came with mayo, it was rectified right away--they were really on top of it) and it comes with a side salad.  This is my kind of meal!! Dessert time came, and of COURSE we each got one!  My friend got the Key Lime Cheesecake, and me--not being a cheesecake fan ::ducks from flying objects::--got the Blackout Cake.  Trust me, it doesn't leave you missing cheesecake FOR SURE.  It was CRAZY good.  But I did have some Key Lime Cheesecake, and it didn't suck.  It's still not my favorite, but I would take chocolate ANY day :) I will definitely be back for the wonderful food, great service, and delectable desserts! :)"
Andrew M.,"Palatine, IL",31,208,12,4.0,5/10/2013,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory numerous times. Last night I had dinner here. The wait wasn't too long, which is unusual for Cheesecake Factory, and our service was good.  The menu is, in my opinion, too big for its own good; but they don't sacrifice quality. I have had a variety of dishes, and I have only been disappointed with the tacos. Things I have enjoyed include the chicken littles, jambalaya, quesadillas, etc. The only bad part is that the serving sizes are outrageous. I usually finish my meal, but I have no room left over for cheesecake.  When I do have room for cheesecake, my personal favorite is the Reese's Peanut butter cup cheesecake. If you aren't salivating over the thought of eating this, you're wrong.  Although it is a chain, the food is consistently good with options for even the pickiest of eaters plus cheesecake."
jim s.,"Long Grove, IL",33,251,179,3.0,5/12/2015,"my son recommended a pasta dish so i carried one out it was good, ok, nothing super special it is a big chain and they have lines out the door sometimes so they don't seem to be trying too hard"
Emily K.,"Racine, WI",35,184,13,2.0,6/7/2015,I don't get why people get so excited about this place. It's about as good as TGIFridays. The only exception is the cheesecake.
Chickago K.,"Palatine, IL",2,23,6,3.0,1/4/2014,"Been to Cheesecake Factory many many times and this was by far the worse experience. First off, the waitress was in rush with us and running to her other larger group of tables and not letting us finish our questions nor ordering. I paid over $70 for the guacamole, fried mac n cheese balls, chicken teriyaki & chicken chipotle pasta. The guacamole was unsalted and no lime juice. The Mac n Cheese was okay. My teriyaki dish was horrible & my husbands pasta had one piece of chicken and 2 piece asparagus in it. Pasta was good!  My hubby complained about his dish and offered him extra chicken to go. I came here to enjoy my food at the restaurant, not at home.  The manager came to apologize...  Seriously feel bad paying that much for nothing.."
Larry L.,"Washington, DC",21,87,177,1.0,6/26/2014,So far I noticed how long it takes to bus and clear tables.  Be ready for a wait.   Been here many times over the past 7 years.  There is a noticeable change in the vibe of the waitstaff.  In slow motion and they don't look happy.  Maybe a change in managers is needed.
Katie S.,"Kenosha, WI",0,6,,3.0,11/12/2016,"A few friends and I decided to come for a late dinner tonight and weren't as satisfied as we'd wished after leaving. We ordered 2 entrees which were split between us, and Cheesecake to go. Could have been better service but we understand it's a busy establishment on a Saturday night, not a big deal. When we asked our check to be split a certain way, it came back half right. We sent it back to be corrected and run the payment through right away. We came back and more of our checks were incorrectly switched, but the cards had already been run through so there was no point in correcting a second time. I was charged for all 4 pieces of cheesecake I ordered but as soon as I got home I noticed our server had only given me 3. I wouldn't mind so much if it was my own piece and I didn't pay $8-$9 for a single slice of cheesecake but I'm disappointed not only by our so-so service, but being jipped out money and my friends partially paying for my meal when it wasn't intended."
Judy L.,"Waukegan, IL",0,6,,4.0,8/8/2015,"I decided to eat dinner here for my birthday and let me tell you it was delicious loved everything about this place very friendly staff exept, I would've gave it 5 stars but I didn't like the fact that you do wait almost 30 minutes to be seated and it tends to be crowded, also  the utensils did seem dirty which I didn't like that very much!!"
Zach A.,"Mundelein, IL",3,11,1,5.0,8/9/2015,"I always go here but the food was more amazing than normal.  Buffalo blasts are on point.  Pina colada is one of the best I've ever had (surprising I know).  The new steak tacos were better than any tacos I've ever had (also surprising).  You can never go wrong with the godiva cheesecake or the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake.  Overall, bomb as f**k."
Gina C.,"Lake Villa, IL",0,3,,3.0,12/31/2015,"The food was excellent.  Our waitress was very nice.  However, the person seating people was seating everyone in clusters, on top of one another when there were other open seats.  It almost felt like being on candid camera when the host brought 2 people to sit at a table, squeezing them between myself and my date and another couple when there were 5 empty tables to the left.  It was comical and I yelled out ""are you kidding me?"" Their seating service was a disaster and pushes their rating down, in my humble opinion."
Aleksandra P.,"Schiller Park, IL",3,5,,1.0,7/7/2015,I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich off the menu for pick up. when I came to pick it up a Santa Fe sandwich was listed on receipt. I was told it's the same thing. Got home and found grilled chicken with avacado not breaded Crispy chicken. I contact the manager and got no response !!! Really !!!!!
Dave J.,"Wheeling, IL",47,224,83,4.0,7/8/2012,"The menu is HUGE...so much to choose from. If you don't know what you're in the mood for, there's a good chance you'll find something to enjoy here. Salads, pasta, beef, chicken, fish, Thai, Viet, American, Mexican, Italian...so much food to choose from! The service was very good. We were offered drink refills frequently and our table was cleared of dirty dishes frequently as well. Prices are reasonable too. My wife and I started off with the ""Vietnamese Tacos"", which is a bit of a misnomer.  These were steamed buns filled with pork and pickled veggies.  They were trying to be cute with the name, but to call it a ""taco"" is a bit misleading IMHO.  Our main courses consisted of the Factory Chopped Salad for me, and grilled Salmon for the Mrs.  Hers came with a side of pasta.  Mine was a hearty blend of lettuce, corn, veggies, and roasted chicken.  It was very good.  And to be honest, you can't come to Cheesecake Factory without having a piece of cheesecake.  We opted to share a slice of Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake.  It was outstanding. Fresh, creative, and delicious. A great way to finish off a meal."
Dr S.,"Vernon Hills, IL",5,88,3,4.0,5/13/2015,"pretty good food here, the menu is very extensive and too much to choose from.... usually the service is pretty good here but on busy days, it may suffer.... will be back for sure as this is the only restaurant in the plaza that we'll go back to.... (no more flemings, or kona grill)"
Nataliya A.,"Chicago, IL",250,331,773,4.0,12/12/2011,"I'll be honest, I don't see what all of the hipe is about. All of my friends just adore this restaurant. Yes the food is good. Yes the drinks are fine. Yes the service is okay. Am I so over the top in love with it... Not really. Don't get me wrong, if I have an option to come here I won't pass it up. The only thing I could say I really love there, are the desserts :) I've had the shepards pie and I've had their steak. Both were good, especially I liked the mashed potatoes (real potatoes not that powder crap). Their carrot cake is top notch, creamy, yummy moose on top, not too sweet. Ive tried some of their cheesecakes, all of them were good. Im usually not a fan of cheesecakes, but these were pretty darn good. Its a fancier restaurant that somehow turned into a more casual restaurant. The menu is insanely long, has something for everyone. If you have a special occasion I could recommend cheesecake factory, however, they do not take reservations and the waiting time is often up to 2 hours on weekend nights. Week nights I have never experienced a wait. It does take forever to get your main dish, come here only when you have about half an hour to get your main dish even on a slow night. The slowness of cooking can maybe be explained by the fact that they cook everything from scratch. Yes, it's a chain restaurant that cooks from scratch. Try it out, maybe you will love it as much as all of my friends do."
Todd P.,"Chandler, AZ",0,35,3,5.0,7/9/2015,I had their Steak Diane with mashed potatoes. Delicisiso! I also love the fried macaroni and cheese!
Joseph S.,"Palatine, IL",6,22,,1.0,1/2/2016,"One star for dessert and rest nothing!  Consistently too salty or too bland.  Over priced just for decoration, slow service (15 min to order, 20min to get the food, no silver ware or water) and free bread.  Ordered lemon garlic and it was so under seasoned that all you test was raw pasta and 5 cooked shrimp. Charged 17.50 for 5 pieces of medium shrimp.  The portion so unacceptable had to eat again somewhere else.  Also ordered, Spicy Cashew Chicken, which wasn't spicy but extremely salty as though sauce was was condensed being left in the heating element.  Paid 16.95.  So so kids pizza, 6.95 and 1.95 kids drink.  Each adult beverage 3.00 x 2  Two adult and child totaling over $60 for the worst meal I have ever had with my family.  We decided to pass on the desert as I didn't want to support this company anymore.  Walking out of the restaurant, I realized that most people have really bad taste in food as there was long line waiting something that was mediocre at best.  Im guilty of it too but no more."
Ravi R.,"Libertyville, IL",0,17,16,4.0,1/1/2015,"The menu is extensive and the food is very good.   The bread, especially the pumpernickel is excellent.   Lots and lots of calories, BUT, they have a reasonably extensive Skinnylicious menu!   Especially for a busy night the service was great and speedy.   The dessert is awesome.  Don't try to eat it all at the restaurant - have the courage to take some home or you will regret it!   The portions are HUGE."
Chris N.,"Hiram, GA",98,46,47,3.0,2/4/2015,"So it's...the cheesecake factory. Nothing I can say about the food that hasn't likely already been said so I will just focus on the service. It's usually very good with helpful, friendly wait staff. The biggest concern here is crowds and wait time. if you go during the peak hours of 5-8 Mon-Thurs and 5 till close Fri and Saturday. You are asking for a nice wait. Sunday brunch and after church hours too. The restaurant is always clean and the atmosphere a bit noisy but tolerable for a restaurant of this size."
Justin S.,"Portsmouth, VA",54,44,31,4.0,2/17/2015,"Came here for Valentine's Day with the family. Had the fried cheese for starters and Chicken Madeira / Steak Diane. Food was very good. The menu was as big as a thesis, which I guess is good, but for me too much. We ended with velvet cake cheesecake and the Godiva cheesecake. Both were fantastic. Because let's be honest. We all come for the cheesecake. Haven't had a bad one yet! Portions are big. Will go back."
Keith M.,"Grand Ledge, MI",6,22,1,4.0,6/24/2013,"Having never been to a Cheesecake Factory, my family was quite surprised by the atmosphere, as well as the amazing cheesecakes!! We were overwhelmed by the large menu, and I was skeptical that our dinner would be anything but ordinary. What a great surprise when the pasta, fish, steak, and salad entrees were all well prepared, and tasted fantastic.  Of course we had cheesecake and devoured red velvet, and bluebrerry.  Wonderful meal, fantastic service!"
