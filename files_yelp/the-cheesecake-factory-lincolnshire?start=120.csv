E S.,"Chicago, IL",15,218,127,4.0,2/7/2015,"Altho it's a commercial joint, i love cheesecake factory. I always get either the chicken bellagio or spicy chipotle chicken pasta. Both are excellent. And of course the ultimate margarita on rock and cheesecake are awesome!! Their corn cake appetizers are delish too!"
Tim S.,"Chicago, IL",98,426,75,4.0,1/18/2011,"What to do on Boxing Day after all the gifts are open and the kids need an escape? Leave the niece with the grand parents and head out for a long lunch and a movie.  We all piled in the car and headed to the Cheesecake Factory.  Food - Started with the calimari and seared tuna, pretty good. Entree were huge. I had a great burger with an egg on top. All of the meals were more than ample and everyone was stuffed. Surprise surprise... Had to have some cheesecke. Key lime, and a chocolate moose piece, plenty for all 5 of us to enjoy.  Service - fantastic. Even though we sat for over 2hrs the server was attentive and more than helpful with suggestions.  Perfect way to spend some time with the brothers."
Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",667,491,62,4.0,11/22/2011,Servers - Nice Atmosphere - Average  Food - Decent  Just like all Cheesecake Factories but the servers seem nicer. :]
Melli B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",124,285,457,3.0,9/16/2013,"One of my coworkers had been dying to go to Cheesecake Factory after we passed it on the way to another restaurant. I agreed we could go the following night. Just like any other Cheesecake Factory, the decor was pretty. The staff was nice and we were seated almost immediately on a Sunday evening. Our very happy waitress took our orders with a big smile and the food came out pretty fast. I ordered an appetizer Mac n cheese bites which was fantastic and especially with the red sauce they put on the side. The herb crusted salmon and its accompaniments were a little bland but nothing a dash of salt and pepper couldn't fix. The Bloody Mary was spicy the way I like it and served with olives and celery. Overall, my meal was good and our waitress was very sweet."
Mark S.,"Mundelein, IL",2,110,9,3.0,2/4/2015,"Super delish cheesecake. Probably the best I've ever had. Comes in about 50 vareties, too. Huge slices. My only complaint: the cost. Five people stopping in for dessert was around $50! Yikes. So if you are a ""one percenter"" and you have money and calories to burn, this is your place."
Valencia W.,"Annandale, VA",102,782,8,3.0,8/25/2013,I was in town.  I was starving.  I found the Cheesecake Factory and did not want to sit inside so I decided I would have the meal for carryout.  I know it may seem ridiculous but in all of the years I've been to Cheesecake Factory I've never had carryout so this was a first.  I was a little hesistant because I thought my food would be cold.  It wasn't cold - just luke warm.  Everything looked okay but I would've been happier if my food was piping hot as it would naturally be when sitting at the table.  I guess that's what I get.  It tasted great and I didn't get sick.  3 Stars.
Howard C.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",236,187,98,2.0,6/27/2014,"Purely average and overpriced. I had a Cuban sandwich that was a total sham. First time it came out cold and I had it replaced. Second time the pork was the most un-tender thing I've ever eaten. I just took it off to try and enjoy the rest of the sandwich. The bread was straight up artisan french bread. For a Cuban?!! I mean, I know you don't have Cuban bread but I expect a smooth french as replacement. It was just completely disappointing. My wife did enjoy her sundried tomato chicken pasta. I tasted it and it was good. Their bread basket is always worth my money (it's free). But I guess it's not really free since everything is a good $2 too expensive. Our southwest egg rolls were really greasy. They tasted good, but just super greasy. And I get it, I normally laugh at people who are like, ""my fried food was too greasy."" but I've had enough southwest egg rolls to know they can be done without the shiny layer of fryer oil.  Anywho, I don't give a lot of reviews below a 4, so you've got to significantly disappoint me to get 2 stars.  I'd spend your money at Kona 10/10 nights."
Dana R.,"Quantico, VA",69,180,9,4.0,1/17/2014,"My fiance and I went to this location to celebrate my Birthday this past week. We didn't have to wait long for a table, which we were grateful for. We were seated in the banquet seating, which was okay if you like that. I'm not such a huge fan. Let me just say upfront that the food was wonderful! Everything we ate was delicious, and so filling.We've never had a problem with the food. It was more so the service that really bummed us out. The waitresses name was Colleen and her service was awful. Having been seated in the banquet section, we viewed tables seated on both sides of us. We observed throughout the meal that they had ordered just as much food as us, or more. Yet, they finished and were out the door way before us. We were halfway through our drinks by the time that the waitress came back for our order of appetizers. A good 20-30 minutes after we had been seated and given bread. When we ordered our appetizers, we also put in the orders for meals. By the time our appetizers arrived, we hadn't even gotten halfway through them when our meals arrived. We had to have the appetizers boxed up to make room for our meals. We were disappointed by this.  We found it a little odd, that both our appetizers and our meals were delievered by people other than our waitress. Our waitress didn't come through the meal to check on anything or see how we were doing. I repeatedly had to ask for larger bag to hold all of the smaller bags were give for our appetizers etc. This became very annoying. In the end, we left with full bellies and take home containers of appetizers, entrees and cheesecake. Aside from the service, we had a good time."
Andrea C.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",797,86,20,4.0,11/12/2013,"Friendly service. I was seated quickly. Maybe a 5 minute wait.  The food... What can I say? The portions were HUGE! This was either made to take leftovers or for obese America.  I got one of the ""skinny"" meals and it came with about 3 servings of food. But under 600 calories For dessert I got the Rocky road sundae which was enough for like 4 people. It was massive. I shared with a friend but we still couldn't finish half. Same with the main course. Money well spent!"
Taylor M.,"Bloomingdale, IL",562,1072,903,2.0,11/13/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory dining experience consists of two things; waiting to eat and eating. Be prepared to spend most of your time waiting. What happens is that you squeeze in, the greeter takes your name and asks you to wait for ""15-20 minutes"". In reality this turned into over 40 minutes of waiting and there is minimal standing room for people waiting.  Once seated, the food comes out fast....TOO FAST! Before you can finish your appetizer, the meal is already there. However, when it comes to clearing plates, filling water or returning your check.... it takes forever! The rushed and cramped atmosphere does not allow you to have a relaxed and enjoyable meal. The tables were basically stacked on top of each other. The lady kept to me kept bumping me and the waitstaff run into your chair.  The food was dripping in grease and is nothing special at all in terms of flavor, presentation or originality.  However, if you are hungry and don't know quite what you have a taste for, the menu selection is HUGE. Anything from Asian and Mexican to Italian and American can be found on the menu. However, glance over your food before you bite... I got half of a toothpick in my sweet potato fries."
Missy R.,"Zion, IL",8,158,,2.0,10/12/2014,"I would give this place a 5 star just based on how it looks, but I was there to eat.  The waiter I had was disengaged. The service was slow.  The food should have been much better for the price we paid.  My daughter had shrimp scampi, we had much better at Red Lobster. I had the breakfast, two eggs, toast, and small potatoes.  I asked for over easy, they came out sunny side up.  I would have complained, but I knew I would never be back.  This restaurant is to expensive to take your family to."
Courtney S.,"Round Lake, IL",2,54,21,4.0,10/23/2013,"My husband and I have been here twice, the first time was about two years ago. The experience was ok, it was a very long wait about 30-40mins for a table, I didn't like how close the seats were to the people next to us and it was very loud. Our meal was ok, but I think we just didn't know what to get... The cheesecake however as to die for Our most recent visit was better, we still had to wait about 30-40mins for a table but we were seated in our own booth!! My husband got the huge burrito and really enjoyed it, I got a chipotle chicken burger which was fantastic! But I course the pièce de résistance was the cheesecake!! Yummy"
Larry P.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,2,,1.0,5/3/2014,Stopped out at the restaurant this morning to ask for accommodations for tonight.  We wanted to bring my mother there tonight for her 79th birthday.  She is in a wheelchair and has dementia. Wanted to thank the manager on duty for his understanding an assistance. For got to mention.....HE SAID NO!
Shrinath P.,"Wheeling, IL",17,43,7,5.0,12/2/2014,"Love every time I go to any cheesecake factory. The food is always decent to great. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle  Pasta, loved the little chips on top to give the crunchy taste. I also tried a new cheesecake this time, the chocolate chip cookie dough was amazing! I always get the Oreo so this was a nice change. Also ask for Julie for your server, she was great."
Duncan M.,"Highwood, IL",9,11,1,5.0,12/19/2012,"Ironically, I almost never get cheesecake. The food is always really good, no matter what I order. Their menu is like a novel, with so many different things. I like the decor as well, very classy, although I sometimes joke that the eye of Sauron is watching me, you'll understand when you see it. It can be a little pricey, compared to what I'm used to, and can get crowded on the weekends.  Definitely worth it though."
Diane L.,"Lake Villa, IL",1,6,,1.0,7/22/2015,"Our family of five went here for a birthday dinner on a Tuesday night.  We were seated right away however our service was terrible.  Server was very rushed, asking us how things were as she walked by without stopping and forgot little things like bringing bread to the table.  Three of our meals were dried out from being under heat lamps for an extended period of time and while two of us ordered dessert to go we had one that was going to eat dessert there.  Our server seemed annoyed with this and walked away before we could also order something to drink with the dessert.  So for $165 we had crappy service and a crappy meal.  They have too much on their menu to really do anything well.  We will not be going again anytime soon."
Jennifer L.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",113,564,985,4.0,5/20/2011,"Except for the Cheesecake being overpriced, I love The Cheesecake Factory!!  Great food, Great location, Beautiful inside, usually fair service, and FABULOUS cheesecake. Very nice menu full of options. Something for everyone."
Foodie F.,"Blue Springs, MO",0,17,,2.0,6/26/2015,Have had better burgers for less. The Key lime cheesecake was way too sweet.
Kirsten H.,"Northbrook, IL",4,151,,4.0,9/9/2014,Hard to go wrong with cheesecake. We headed into Cheesecake Factory to grab a sweet treat for later at home. Though there were 2 people manning the dessert counter and not many customers there (though maybe they were busy also getting food prepared for the 'dining in' customers) service was very slow. Smores cheesecake was excellent and worth the wait though!
David L.,"Boston, MA",116,981,840,3.0,10/23/2010,"Food: 3 Decor: 3 Service: 3 Came here with a group of coworkers for dinner  . 1. Frozen iced mango, 5 (Mango, Tropical Juices and a Hint of Coconut Blended with Ice and Swirled with Raspberry Puree.) Yummy. 2. Thai lettuce wraps, 12 (Create Your Own Thai Lettuce Rolls! Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles and Lettuce Leaves with three delicious Spicy Thai Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew.) Not bad. 3. Chicken madeira, 16? (Our most popular chicken dish! Sautéed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes) Not that great. Didn't like the huge servings of mashed potatoes, and the rest was mediocre."
