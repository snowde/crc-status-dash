Christine V.,"McHenry, IL",124,136,17,3.0,9/5/2012,"The turnover rate at this restaurant is incredible. They have people pouring out of the front door either leaving or entering at all times. We were told our wait was going to be 45 minutes and we were seated within 10. Don't know how that happened but I am not going to question it.  We came here for cheesecake after eating dinner at Cooper's Hawk, and were excited once we put in our orders. One slice of Kahlua Cheesecake, and one slice of Chocolate with raspberry. BOTH were great. The Kahlua wasn't that pronounced in the cheesecake but the texture and flavor was spot on.  Quick service, good food and a very well organized wait staff. Kudos!"
Kathy J.,"Wheeling, IL",1,6,13,2.0,1/15/2015,"Ate here again yesterday, had the spicy chicken breast. It was not spicy at all, and no flavor and was very overcooked. I do not like the table set ups in there, I do not want to be sitting right on top of my neighbor, so be sure to ask for a booth when you try this location out."
Chris J.,"Chicago, IL",123,10,5,2.0,8/2/2012,"Good:  we were seated very quickly on the outside patio even though there was a line of people waiting.  I guess they wanted inside seats.  The view is nice and the weather was great.  A few ducks were hustling for hand-outs which wasn't bad.  Kinda funny seeing them waddle around. Meh; our waiter was a guy that kinda looked like ManCow Muller.  Hmm....anyway, we ordered the passion fruit tea and it was horrible.  He immediately asked ""Too perfumey?"" like he knew it wasn't that great.  We changed that for regular tea but they don't have any sweet tea or raspberry.  We asked for sugar, which he never brought over.  A different waitress got it for us. The food was good and we had to take 'to go' boxes.  My problem though, is that the guy never came back around to check on us.  I had to flag him down after the busboy cleared the table.  We ordered desserts to go.   Bill came to $60 which wasn't bad but, gotta pay attention to your customers.  And lose that passion tea.  Yuk."
Karen S.,"Wheeling, IL",2,23,14,2.0,11/15/2014,"I've been here quite a few times and last night I was very dissatisfied with the service we received. I understand that it is Friday night and the place gets packed, however I find it unacceptable to make a paying customer feel rushed. Food was ok. Blueberry cheesecake was on point."
Yer X.,"Chicago, IL",6,8,,4.0,8/5/2013,"Yesterday my fiance and I came to try out Cheesecake for the first time--me that is, and few times for him. The introductory of the desserts fascinate me, therefore I decided we should dine here for the evening and call it a day. Upon reaching inside the restaurant, we were party of two and had a decision either dine in or outside. The inside was twenty minutes, which I should of have patience of waiting for it, but we went outside instead. Outside is a rather refreshing news to me, however, I suffered a migraine headache so there is no fault at anywhere but my own. At this time of the day, the wind still out there blowing people's leg like a snake. The breeze chills me, but like in ten minutes there were those lamp heaters to protect me from it. That's even greater. However, next time I dine here I will wait for the inside than the outside. Sorry love! Our server was nice, but she didn't tell me anything about the Orange Juice cannot be refilled. My fiance hasn't been here for such a long time he doesn't know what changed or not. So I ordered that and was told perhaps like twenty-thirty minutes after we got our dinner that it's nonrefillable. How unfortunate, but the good thing is that I drunk so many before I left, why need to drink more Vitamin C? Water was great to my dinner plus anyways. So onwards with dinner, we ordered two appetizers; Buffalo Wings and some fries that is actually creamy fried-breaded mozzarella sticks. The Buffalo Wings is perfect amount not to get full so fast of, and is easily devour than it can be in Miller Pub. Miller Pub has so much sauce their wings, I can easily contrast Cheesecake Factory's wings better. My fiance likes his appetizer, therefore we were more than satisfied. Then, we ordered our dinner. I ordered the Steakhouse BBQ burger and asked it for well done. My fiance ordered a five-cheese pasta and was arrived later than twenty-thirty minutes after we finished eating our appetizers. My husband's came first. He adored his too much he said, ""It's GG for me!"". I laughed. Now we waited for mines only in five minutes just to find out it's still rare. We asked our server to return it for well-done, leaving me the fries temporarily. Twenty minutes later, my burger returned to me and was cooked well. Sadly, I was  quite disappointed that moment I only ate half of my burger and took it home. We ordered three desserts! We can't say much about the Tiramisu and Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake yet cause..~ It's in our fridge! But we ordered a strawberry Cheesecake, the classic, and it. WAS. THE. BEST.  My fiance almost passed out from the deliciousness of it to his mouth. It exploded with its originality I loved from it in my mouth, and will definitely come back to get one more before I leave back home! Yummy!! So the only reason I give it four was because the server could of told me more exact about the Orange Juice a nonrefillable juice, otherwise it'd be perfect. Another point is that my disappointment of my burger. Couldn't get comfortable after finding out its rare. Nothing bad, but I did request it and I have to wait another twenty minutes just to have it in my hands only to pack half of it home. It's a definite must try! Once again I must come back again before I leave."
Tony M.,"Morton Grove, IL",1005,137,2070,4.0,7/30/2014,"Usually wait for seating and service! If your not in a hurry then this is great to relax and take your time at! Every cheesecake restaurant I go to usually wait for seating and service. The food has generous portions for the price. Tasty foods full of flavor usually at every restaurant. All of the entrees are tasty and generous portions. My favorite is the Jumbalaya Linguini Pasta with chicken and shrimp. It is spicy with Cajun flavors. The bang bang chicken and shrimp is great that has a Thai peanut sauce with rice. Also, They have a special menu for the healthy eater. Every restaurant no matter the location has the same feel of relaxation in the restaurant where you can relax and unwind with your friends there. They accommodate large groups but mainly booths of six people are common. They are the best with many assortment of cheesecake. All of them taste so good! Best way to end a meal is a big slice of cheesecake! I love the Godiva cheesecake for chocolate lovers! All in all, I go back for the food and cheesecake! Their is plenty of parking in the plaza with Barnes and Noble next door."
Irene S.,"Northbrook, IL",0,3,,4.0,11/19/2014,Great restaurant for a family dinner - and great for a special celebration ! Food is always consistent - quality and presentation is great. Wait staff tries to accommodate all requests - our waiter remembered all special requests and delivered all food and drinks as ordered. Wait staff made a very nice ice cream sundae presentation for our 6-year old son - it was his Birthday and he loved the attention! We are long-term customers and will always come back - Cheesecake Factory is great and we highly recommend it for both food quality and service - way to go!
Carol H.,"Newport News, VA",29,44,13,3.0,2/14/2010,"I have been to this location several times, and each time I have had an enjoyable experience. It is a chain restaurant so by nature its a bit lack luster, but its a great place to go to feed a crowd. I will write my review for my most recent visit. My husband, three children and I went to The Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. When we arrived we were seated promptly and right away asked what we would like to drink. Our server was courteous and prompt. He made sure our drinks were topped off and was very friendly towards the children.  As an appetizer we ordered the Lettuce Wraps. They were delicious, but they only gave us enough chicken to make three small wrap. The cashew sauce that was served with them was so yummy I was dipping the leftover lettuce in it and truly enjoying it. For the main course I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. I have ordered this before and liked it but this time it was only okay. It seemed to be overly sweet with no spice. Its a curry based dish, and I was told it should have a little kick to it- it didn't. I had a lot leftover to take home, and when I reheated it to eat it tasted much better.  My husband ordered from the specials menu and got a gumbo with shrimp and he really liked it. To me, it was rather bland. Not at all like the yummy goodness that you would expect from gumbo. My kids ordered the Orange Chicken, and shared the huge helping. They almost nearly cleaned their plates so I guess they loved their food. We took home the Carmel La Leche cheesecake, and it was superb. Just thinking about it makes me craving more. All in all, The Cheesecake Factory is a good place to grab a bite to eat, but be sure to save room for dessert."
Kelly C.,"Nashville, TN",26,100,2,4.0,3/26/2012,"Yes it is a chain restaurant and living in Chicago I try to avoid them because there are so many good restaurants.  But I work in the burbs where chain restaurants rule.  I'm not going to lie if people want to do lunch Cheesecake Factory is always the top of my list.   They have a VERY extensive menu...you could spend your entire lunch hour trying to figure out what to order!  I'm boring and always get the same thing: tuna tataki salad.  It's devine with seared tuna, avocado, tomatoes and a spring mix salad.  Healthy and filling.  I could eat this for lunch everyday. I dine with other people who get a variety of items and wow the portions are huge - even the half/lunch portion salad is enough for 2 meals - I wonder what the full one looks like! I don't get the cheesecake often but when I do the red velvet cheesecake is to die for.  It seriously is the best thing ever. The service at this location for lunch have always been good and the food comes out quick.  I would recommend doing lunch a little earlier than the typical lunch crowd (around 1130 is when i go)."
Avinash K.,"Elgin, IL",248,514,112,4.0,6/9/2014,"Pretty good place. Like the outdoor-seating with nice view. We were a group of five, I ordered the Adam's Peanut Butter cheesecake, that was awesome, one guy had ordered the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake - which had a strong mango flavor, which had a strong punch, one girl ordered the 30th anniversary - which was really good, one another guy ordered the Red velvet which was pretty good and the last guy ordered Blueberry white chocolate and it was pretty good. Server was friendly but he had got the check even before we asked for it, possibly because there was so much crowd, but nonetheless, food was really good. Rather desserts were really good."
Gal P.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,,1.0,11/1/2015,Why is this place not taking reservations for large parties? The wait it ridiculous and the host on the phone was very in accurate with his time estimates. Foods just OK
Joel A.,"Lake Forest, IL",12,97,42,5.0,1/3/2014,I can't complain. A full menu very Las Vegas style casino restaurant style with extremely reasonable prices for the quantity of food. I love the ribeye which had always been juicy and flavorful. Amazing onion rings compliment my meal well.
Gene L.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,9,,2.0,9/20/2015,"I ordered gluten free Evelyn's pasta from our waitress.  Another waiter brought me a pasta dish that was not gluten free (strike one).  I asked him if it was gluten free and he said, ""yes, it is"" (strike two).  After I ate a few bites our waitress comes running over and said, ""Don't eat that. There's been a mistake!""  I asked to speak with a manager and she said, no, he knows about this and he's already mad at her and the kitchen. (strike three).  When the bill came they charged us full price (strike four). After we further complained they took it off the bill. For a gluten free meal you are better off going to PF Chang's or CPK."
louise b.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,14,,1.0,7/31/2014,"Usually nice, but incompetent personnel on duty this evening! Very busy evening.  My party entered, followed by two women.  We stood in a long line to ""check in"" for a table. As three of us spoke, the companion of the woman who came in behind me stepped away,  thought for the rest room.  Several seconds later the woman who had stepped away motioned to her friend in line behind us, and the two were taken to be seated outside.  There were at least 10 people before them in line, and many others waiting for their seats clutching pagers.  When questioned the reservation desk said the women ""must have checked in earlier."" They did not.  Know for sure as we had spoken in line.The women actually spoke about rude treatment they had received there in the past. The women who were seated before at least 50 other guests should have been removed, and their table given to the next on the list."
Nick L.,"San Mateo, CA",82,1025,13,3.0,10/3/2011,"This place is always busy. The menu is crazy extensive, it can take your lunch hour to read through the whole thing. The portions sizes are huge. I'd never think I would say it but perhaps a little too huge! Prepare for sleep coma."
Kim F.,"Northbrook, IL",3,24,1,1.0,8/17/2013,My husband and I came here for dinner last month and they sat us at a table with crumbs and food particles all over it. We asked for the table to be cleaned again and they wiped it down for us. Then we looked at the silverware and there was food stuck to them as well. We asked for new silverware and they brought it. Then they put down appetizer plates with... you guessed it... more food stuck on the plates. We left without ordering and complained to the manager.
Daniel F.,"Bloomington, IN",0,13,,1.0,6/4/2014,Don't come here on your lunch hour unless you have hours of time to spend. I've tried 3 times now and each time the door was still locked (they are supposed to open at 11). They are always scrambling during opening time and are not prepared for service on a consistent basis. It takes 10min just to get a seat (restaurant is empty). And then you will hav to flag down a waiter to get service because they will not come to you otherwise. No complaints with the food though.
Lise S.,"Northbrook, IL",0,9,1,2.0,8/19/2015,"I've tried a couple of times, but it just isn't working for me.  Long waits, loud, loud, loud. Just not a comfortable place.  The food is fine, but not worth the wait."
Mindy B.,"Lincolnshire, IL",1,26,2,1.0,9/28/2014,"We love The Cheesecake Factory, but this location is unlike any other location we've been to.  Even when there are few people in the restaurant, the time it takes to be seated at a table is beyond unacceptable.  There is zero sense of urgency on behalf of the hostess to seat you.  On three separate occassions with three different wait staff, we also experienced really slow and poor service.  At our last visit, we arrived around 8:30pm and I asked to be seated somewhere other than a table right next to other diners.  The hostess smiled at me and walked us to a table located smack dab in the middle of other diners.  I asked again, ""Can we have a more private table?""  She said, ""This is all I have.""  I looked around at three private booths located directly across from us and asked, ""What about those?""  She said, ""No, this is all I have.""  Minutes later, I watched as the next couple that came in was seated at one of the booths I had inquired about.""  In addition to there being a lack of accommodation of the customers here, my biggest complaint at this location is the fact that your kitchen staff simply doesn't know how to properly season food.  Dishes that I love and have come to be my favorites at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants are bland and tasteless at this location.  Upper management needs to send in some secret shoppers to this location to experience what's really going on there."
Kay R.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,4,,3.0,7/30/2015,"Rather unfortunate to say that ive yet to be fully satisfied with cheesecake factory every time i go. Portions are big and make the price worth, but the taste neve satisfies. I get the impression that cheesecake values quantity over quality. Environment is great, servers are very friendly, and it is a great place to eat out a bit fancy, but personally, the food just does not hit the spot for me compared to the rest of the restaurant's specs which are excellent."
