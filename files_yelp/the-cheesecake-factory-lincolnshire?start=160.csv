Lindsey W.,"Vernon Hills, IL",2,41,1,5.0,6/13/2012,"I really like this place.  I have been to a number of locations, but I like this one because it is never crowded enough to have to wait to be seated when I come here.  They have a very extensive menu, and I've never had anything bad from it.  The crusted chicken Romano with white sauce is my absolute favorite. This past visit, I had stuffed chicken tortillas, and they were awesome.  My favorites for cheesecake are adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple and red velvet, but they are probably all good.  If a lunch portion of what you want is available, order it.  The portion will still be huge and you will still have leftovers.  Service is always spot on, which is major for me.  Yes, it's a chain.  They have yummy food though, so get over it!"
Sludge R.,"Wheeling, IL",7,106,233,4.0,3/16/2014,"Very good. My wife is the picky eater, and she found something to mildly be a little unhappy about. Our server, Chris R, was fantastic. A server can make or break an experience, of course. The tables are close together. This didn't bother me. The restaurant was loud, and the couple next to us never shut up, so it was no problem for me. But it DID inhibit my wife. The music could barely be heard, but I did hear Me and Mrs. Jones playing. Overall, a wonderful dinner."
Jennifer R.,"Palatine, IL",15,3,,2.0,11/19/2014,"I frequently dine at The Cheesecake Factory in Lincolnshire for lunch; I usually dine with family there a couple times per month, and I dine with a friend there once per month.  The customer service we experience is usually very good, which is part of the reason I keep returning (of course, the food is great too).  When I dine with my friend, it is always on a Saturday, and we usually arrive at about 11:30.  We are greeted by a tall man at the front desk who recognizes us as regular customers and says, ""Hi folks, a booth for two?""  He knows we prefer a booth, and is always accommodating.  There have been a couple times when my friend and I arrived later, the restaurant was packed, and there were no booths available.  That is completely understandable.  However, the customer service we received during our visit on Saturday, November 15th left us dissatisfied. We arrived at 11:30, and I approached the young woman at the front desk; I indicated that we were a party of 2, and that we would prefer a booth.  She stated that there were no booths available and that we would be seated at a table instead.  I looked around the restaurant and saw plenty of unoccupied booths, so I was a bit confused.  Shortly after that, the host (a young man) grabbed 2 menus and started walking us to our table.  Before sitting down, I looked around again, and noticed several booths unoccupied.  I pointed to one, and asked the host if we could have a booth instead.  He stated that we could not.  I then asked why we couldn't when there were many unoccupied booths.  He replied that people being seated after us would get a booth.  I said, ""So, people being seated after us will get a booth even though we arrived here first and specifically requested a booth?""  He indicated that was correct, and as I sat down, I stated that did not make any sense and is poor customer service.  He said that unfortunately, that is how it works sometimes, told us to enjoy our lunch, and walked away.  My friend and I felt that he did not handle the situation in a professional manner, and we were dissatisfied.  Shortly after we were seated, my friend noticed that a party of 2 was seated at a nearby booth. I completely understand if a booth is unavailable due to a valid reason, such as the restaurant being packed and all the booths are occupied.  However, in this particular situation, my friend and I felt that we were being treated rudely.  We still plan on visiting the restaurant regularly, but we are hoping this was a one-off situation we won't have to experience again."
Joseph S.,"Chicago, IL",23,5,,1.0,8/10/2013,"Let me get this out of the way - the food here was fine, but the service and the time it took to get served were horrible.  We waited over an hour and 15 minutes to get our food.  We  had to hunt our waitress down not once but twice - and then we had to find her again to get her to take our credit card so that we could get out of there.  It is wonderful to be able to have a leisurely meal - but only when you want it to be that way.  We saw three tables that arrived long after us get their meals before - I'm not sure what was wrong or if they just didn't like us.  We weren't loud, we didn't berate anyone and we left a good tip (it was obviously not our waitress's fault).  Just bad service - and when we complained we weren't listened to.  I would not come back here - nor would I recommend this to a friend."
Vincent D.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/4/2015,"I ordered 1 pasta and 1 piece of cheesecake for takeout at 3:15 pm. My order wasn't ready until 4:05 after complaining to the manager. Otherwise, the food is still delicious."
Charlise P.,"Avon Lake, OH",0,6,,4.0,5/20/2015,Busy as usual during dinner time- we went on Mother's Day. Told the wait was over 45 mins but we were sat in 20. Service was really excellent and food was great. The cheesecake of course was the best-- even after I took it home to eat later!
Catalina J.,"Chicago, IL",0,4,,1.0,4/24/2015,"If I could give 0, I would give 0. I love Cheesecake Factory at Old Orchard mall but in Lincolnshire I had a horrible experience with my order. I asked for a take out order. I was shocked when I opened the box at home, I literary got one spoon of dry, old mashed potatoes, left overs from meat and vegetables. It's too bad that I live way too far from that place to go and return it. Otherwise, I would do that. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for wasting 16$ into the garbage!"
Derek G.,"Lincolnshire, IL",0,3,,1.0,4/23/2015,Had to leave today without ordering.  Music was so loud couldn't hear my dining companion.This came even after I politely requested  to the manager that the volume be lowered. It was lowered for one minute and went back up again.  We left and will not return.
Luna M.,"Wauconda, IL",208,206,820,4.0,9/3/2011,"Been to the Old Orchard & Schaumburg locations, but I like this location the best. Their menu is overwhelming so I tend to order the usual favorites. It helps to read other YELP reviews so you can get other meal suggestions at CF. And of course, how can we forget the ""extensive list"" of cheesecakes & cakes to choose from. Because their food entrees are so generous, I usually take my dessert to go."
Linda K.,"Arlington Heights, IL",50,34,,4.0,4/16/2011,"I had been to the Cheesecake Factory in Woodfield mall, but this was my first visit to this location. Got there kind of late on a Friday and thought there wouldn't be a wait but i think that place is always busy! Waited about 15 minutes so it wasn't too bad. I like the decor of this location. The place was loud and bustling. Our server, Rob, was very attentive and efficient. The menu is very extensive,  which I like, with many interesting items to choose from. We started with the crispy crab bites and white bean hummus for an appetizer. Both were quite yummy! I had the Herb crusted Salmon for my entree which was outstanding. The portion was very generous, as was  the side of garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. Couldn't even eat half...good thing for ""to-go"" boxes! My dining companions had the Luau Salad and the Spicy Crispy Chicken Salad. These items were also very generous in size, and delicious. Unfortunately, I've never been able to enjoy any of their decadent looking desserts because their entrees are so large!  All in all, the service, food, and atmosphere was very good. Not usually a fan of chain restaurants but I'll go back again to try some other items....or maybe just for cheesecake or Linda's chocolate cake!!"
Dmitriy O.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",1,13,,4.0,6/24/2011,"I spent five and a half years working at this restaurant while in school (since it opened in November 2005). I still eat there and am not repulsed by the food. The food quality is great and if it's not, you should say something about it. My favorite dishes are the Hibachi Steak, Crispy Spicy Beef, and Ahi Tuna Salad. And if you don't mind consuming 1800 calories in a sandwich, go for the Shrimp and Bacon Club. And no, they do NOT do samplers of cheesecake and the bread is NOT chocolate bread :P"
Abhijit C.,"Barrington, IL",12,43,5,5.0,10/15/2012,Love this place!! My wife took me there on my birthday and i loved every minute i was there. Very professional service and a very extensive menu. We loved the sea food collection they have and oh how can you not love the fantastic selection of dessert they have..5 stars all the way!!
Vince V.,"Roselle, IL",70,161,282,4.0,1/24/2011,"In the interest of full-disclosure, I have never been the greatest fan of the Cheesecake Factory restaurant concept: take everyone else's signature dishes, reverse engineer them and resell the stuff under one roof with twice the portion size. It feels like Costco for the foodie crowd. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed myself the last couple of times I was there. The shrimp and chicken jambalaya pasta (ask for extra sauce) was excellent comfort food and the Honker's ale on tap was fresh. I finished up with coffee and a lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. Yep, it was all good after a rough day at work."
Sarah W.,"Joliet, IL",8,10,2,3.0,2/10/2012,"Recently had a business lunch there recently. They don't have any tables that are not half booth half chairs. When you have a group it's not fun to scoot all the way across a booth to the corner. The server was not very friendly and every person who asked a question about the menu was answered with a ""No"" and not a single suggestion. My biggest complaint is that we didn't get our food at the same time. 1 person received his food, then a few minutes later (after helping another table) she brought 2 more plates, then a bit more waiting until the final 2 plates arrived. Not cool. The only redeeming quality was the food and the fact that my water was constantly refilled. The veggie burger was delicious!"
Carl F.,"Effingham, IL",65,382,424,4.0,7/18/2011,"As always the food is great here.  The presentation is nice and portions are large.  Then of course the desserts are to die for.   This place is always busy, so if you can plan ahead, make reservations if your eating during the normal meal times.  If you get there at around 7:30 pm, the wait time is relatively short.    As for the menu, you will find it has a wide range of items covering the basic burger to mexican, asian fusion, and Mediterranean.    This is also a great place to get an appetizer or two to share and then top it off with dessert.   The only caution is, if your looking for an intimate dinner, this is probably not your best spot because it is generally loud and many of the tables are really close together."
Jacob J.,"Chicago, IL",705,2453,3000,4.0,4/29/2009,"Nice location, reminds me of the Grand Lux Cafe in Houston, Tx (which is Cheesecake Factory on steroids). Business lunches, you need to get in here at noon or at least an hour before if you'd like to have a good table. No phone reservations, they'll give you a window of time that is optimal for a table. Great food, prompt and eager service. Something worth mention; a jacket had fallen off a chair, a gal within the group was seated at. Without a word, a table attendant grabbed the jacket and placed it back on her chair like a parent assisting a child to sit down. I can think of times where I've seen a waiter note to a customer that their jacket had fallen instead of picking it up them-self.  I don't go to Cheesecake often, looked for something reasonably priced like a soup and salad combo. Found a personal pizza and salad combo for $10.50. It was a 6"" personal pie that wasn't like what you could expect at Pizza hut. This was gourmet like a California pizza kitchen pie, got the BBQ chicken pizza with a side Cesar. Light, filling and the right price."
Margaret B.,"Arlington Heights, IL",0,29,,3.0,3/20/2015,"The food is mostly good, and the menu is huge.  I say go on a lovely day, when the outdoor patio is open.  It's just so nice eating out back, away from the parking lot, and if you're lucky, you'll see a mama duck and her little babies waddling around the patio."
Elina K.,"Lake Zurich, IL",103,100,7,4.0,7/5/2013,"The service, atmosphere (VERY nice outdoor seating) and food quality at this CF location is always consistent, which earns it a solid 3 stars.  But The fourth star is for the suprisingly delicious and generous Skinnylicious menu. I really enjoyed my ahi tuna tartare and mexican lettuce wraps (together, only 500 calories!)"
Sam M.,"Warrenville, IL",32,139,185,4.0,6/21/2014,"Every month or so we meet up with a friend; this is our halfway point, how convenient. The food is ok. They had a peanut butter noodle something a while ago, but it is no more. Since then I've tried several dishes and not really overly happy about any of them. I now usually get the jambalaya with the chicken and shrimp on the side. Tonight hubs got the pasta carbonara with chicken. It was alright, needed salt. He liked it, especially because he added my chicken and shrimp hah My girlfriend got the white chicken chili, which is tasty. Now, the major reason we dine here: the dessert. The chocolate truffle tower is amazing!! I usually cut it into thirds and eat it a little as I go, otherwise it's 1600 calories, just for that. Thirds make it easier on the waistline. Tonight I got my usual mango lime cheesecake. Love it! I ask for half on my plate and half in a to go box. Hubs got the red velvet cheesecake, he thought it was excellent, he could've had another piece. Fatty. My girl got the carrot cake and put some to go to enjoy later. We left happy; off to the car for our food coma :-)"
Gee M.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,7,,4.0,8/17/2012,"I don't usually rave about chain restaurants but the food here is to die for! They start you off with two kinds of bread, a slice of french baguette and this dark whole wheat one (or maybe pumpernickel?). I ignore the white one and savor the dark bread. I don't exactly know what it is but it's crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, a bit warm that the butter just melts smoothly, a bit sweet but not too sweet, and has that whole wheat texture to it. AHHH just writing about it makes me drool. Then comes the appetizers. I don't usually get any appetizers because the plat principal is usually more than enough. I usually get either an avocado roll, Evelyn's favorite, or Roasted Veggies pizza. I believe these are vegetarian so if you are one, try these. If you love goat cheese as much as I do, the pizza is amazing. Then, dessert. Now, I'm one of those people who like their chocolate really dark and I'm afraid their cheesecakes, even the dark chocolate one, is just too sweet for my liking. I have tasted the dark chocolate one and the tiramisu cheesecake and normal people might like them. So, food is amazing. Location is wonderful. The patio overlooks a pond. Service can be better. I wish the wait wasn't so long. But overall, I love this place. The food and ambiance outweigh the wait."
