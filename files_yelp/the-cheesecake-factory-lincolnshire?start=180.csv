Krista B.,"Gurnee, IL",4,19,1,2.0,4/3/2013,Not so satisfied with this place anymore. The interiors are beautifully decorated the good is good but the service sucked. I went on a Thursday night and it was slamming busy. After a fourty minute wait to get seated the waitress seats us and we tell her up front it is my birthday. After she takes our order it took a very long time just to get our appetizers and we had to track the girl down to ask about it. She then rushes to go get them but by then two minutes later the actual food comes out which defeats the purpose of an appetizer.  We ordered cheesecakes too which were very good but they did absolutely nothing special for my birthday. Overall I was expecting for a special night but got nothing but bad service.
Richard R.,"Grayslake, IL",0,31,,3.0,9/26/2014,"Stopped in for a late night bite.  First we were told that a table we would like to sit at was not available because the bus boys hadn't cleaned it for 30 minutes.  The host could not get the table cleared. After waiting 10 minutes, the manager seemed to indicate that because it was later, it wasn't important.  My wife and I ordered a sandwich to split. It was brought out on one plate, unlike the past when splits were served on two plates. Finally, we ordered a piece of cheesecake which took almost ten minutes to get. Our waiter apologized and told us that the person who serves cheesecake was not behind the counter. Service was bad. When the staff is not doing their job, I blame the manager for not doing his job, he should not be hiding in the kitchen."
Louie S.,"Chicago, IL",1,19,48,5.0,6/27/2012,"The Kobe Burger... best burger I've ever had.  Perfectly done, juicy and great customer service.  Simply fantastic!"
Tj C.,"Lincolnshire, IL",102,10,3,1.0,10/30/2014,"Places even as arrogant and popular as the Cheesecake Factory do not deserve your business if the staff is snippy or rude.  Luke, the guy who answered the phone for a carryout order, was sarcastic and rude when I called back to ATTEMPT to place a To Go order.   The reason I had to call back to him was that their TO Go department never picked up the phone.  This was at 2:30pm on a weekday, not a busy time.  Luke--work on your manners."
Frank L.,"Chicago, IL",58,117,5,4.0,5/11/2010,"This review of Cheesecake Factory may be a little unnecessary, because everyone knows what Cheesecake has to offer, but I'm here to highlight some of the other aspects of this Cheesecake Factory that may go unnoticed in the day to day dining experince at Cheesecake Factory.  1. The host was very good. I mentioned to the host that my party had not completely arrived, and I was hoping to put my name down to wait for my party to arrive. The host asked how long my party would be, gave me a buzer and said they would seat ME as soon as a table opened up. Granted it was 8:15pm, on a friday night and things were slowing somewhat, but I've only ever experienced long waits at Cheesecake, so this was a pleasant surprise as I waited for my co-diners. Two thumbs up to Cheesecake policy and the host.  2. Red velvet Cheesevake. When I was in Seattle a few months ago, myself and my two friemds bought an entire 7"" cheesecake for ourselves. It was cheesecake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. By the end of the weekend, we were a little cheesecaked out. But on this last dine-in, three of us shared one slice, and it was as good as ever. If you haven't tried the Red velvet Cheesecake, and you're comfortable with rich, sugary and fattening, then you need to try this IMMEDIATELY! STOP READING THIS AND PICK UP A SLICE! CHEESECAKE FACTORY IS EVERYWHERE.  3. Servers. Could actually be accused of being ""too friendly"". But is this a bad thing? Give me the exhuberent and kill-you-with-kindness energy over the ""what the hell do you want attitude"" and you've got my repeat business.  4. Menu. This is also something that could be considered a negative, because there is almost TOO MUCH to choose from. But this last trip in, I tried something new, something I never. Thought I would order (crispy spicy beef) and I found myself trying to stuff every last bit of crispy beef, rice and veggies into my piehole despite my stomach telling me ""no stop. No more food"". Use the expansive menu to your advantage! Try something different because you may be pleasantly surprised.  5. The bread. I am a sucker for their dark sweet wheat bread. Or is it rye? Who knows, who cares. Just give me lots of it. Especially when its warm and right out of the oven. We were at Cheesecake a few months ago and it was late, but our server brought out fresh bread for us anyways. Another notch in the belt of superior customer service.  To recap and advise: Check out Cheesecake Factory for: Incredible red velvet cheesecake.  Great service. Top to bottom.  Expansive menu - that should satisfy even the pickiest eaters.  Some words of caution: Be prepared for a long wait.  The food portions are large, so those watching their figure should take heed (and maybe skip the cheesecake)"
Steven B.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,13,,1.0,10/27/2014,"The food is always great but the service can ruin a meal.  Stopped in with the family after 8 on saturday night.  Took the waitress almost 15 minutes just to stop by and take our drink order.  While waiting for dinner, she came by to tell us she was going on her 30 minute break and someone else would continue the service.  After dinner, waited almost 20 minutes to order some cheesecake to go."
Raena W.,"Manhattan, NY",84,56,23,3.0,11/19/2012,"Food here is wonderful! Pretty good service. They turn the lights down pretty low in the restaurant, so make sure you go with someone you actually want to talk to. Oh, and skip the fried macaroni bites, its not worth it."
Rohan R.,"Antioch, IL",0,14,,4.0,1/3/2010,Love the food.... very extensive menu!  Always something for everyone no matter when you go. Only problem is the damn wait :(  It always takes forever to get seated... i guess thats how good the food is.  People wait for an hour to get seated on regular work days too.
LISA G.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,2,,1.0,9/6/2015,"Don't ever attempt to order carryout at Cheesecake Factory especially curbside pickup.. It starts with the phone call to order your food. They put you on hold for 5 minutes or more and nobody ever comes to the phone. So then I called back and they tried to put me on hold again to wait for manager. Eventually someone picked up the phone and said are you holding for a manager and I told her I just wanted to order food.  So she took my order and said it would be ready in 30 minutes. We showed up at the curbside pickup exactly 30 minutes later and called the number on the sign to tell them we are there. She replied ""we will be right out with your food"". 20 minutes later we are still sitting in the car. It is now 50 minutes since I placed my order. My husband then goes inside to see what is going on and doesn't return for another 15 to 20 minutes. That is because he has to wait in line at the bakery where people are ordering Cheesecake while our order is sitting on the counter right behind the cashier. If he hadn't gone in that food would still be sitting there tomorrow. Why do they bother to have a carry out if they do not have anyone working it. it is now an hour and 20 minutes since I ordered the food and I'm home with it but I'm not even hungry anymore. Cheesecake Factory is run by a ship of fools. I don't know how they stay in business. I for one will never be back. Oh, btw, the food is stone cold!"
Drew W.,"Chicago, IL",8,67,,4.0,10/10/2010,"Picked up a little carryout fix... Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake-yes it really does tatse like Red Velvet Cake Linda' Fudge Cake-Good if not the greatest chocolate cake ever (go to Gibson's) Strawberry Shortcake-really good, packed everything seperate which was nice Person at the counter was helpful and it was a quick grab and go I've got the sugar munchies experience!"
amy l.,"Arlington Heights, IL",12,13,,3.0,7/19/2014,"The husband and I went for dinner last night. We went later- around 8- were seated right away and had a very nice waiter. I had the orange chicken, and it was sooo delicious! It was also a large helping and I had a lot left over for lunch today! We enjoy the Cheesecake Factory once in a while for a night out :)"
B A.,"Chicago, IL",0,121,4,5.0,7/14/2014,"The food was very good. Their prices are a little higher than the average sit-down restaurant around. The menu is quite extensive. They do offer a gluten free menu. The service was pretty good, with no complaints."
E M.,"Mundelein, IL",0,31,3,3.0,2/19/2012,"Let me start off by saying that on Yelp, three stars is ""A-OK."" For me, it's more like, ""Ehhhh...it was okay.""   Secondly, I am truly befuddled by the people that pack these places every night, and all I can think of is that they are the same relatively small cross-section of the populations that come over and over again -- unimaginative, chain-restaurant dwellers.  This place's biggest appeal in their food is that most of the dishes are comfort food with lots of ingredients, which definitely makes people feel like they are getting their money's worth.  (??)  Sorry, but an over-over-sized bowl of mushy noodles with red AND yellow peppers AND three kinds of cheese instead of one is not worth my $17.00.  I've probably been to various Cheesecake Factories in the area a total of ten times over the the years; after a many-year hiatus, we went to the one in Lincolnshire to meet a friend and had the same ""why did we come here?"" experience as always.  Let's start with the food, which was okay, and go one to the service, which was dismal.  The bread they bring to the table was actually fantastic...yippee!  As we wrestled through the ridiculously long menu, we had an order of chips with spinach dip, which was fine, but what wouldn't be with mounds of cheese and oil literally floating on top? I'm a rich-food junkie, but this was too much even for me.  Also had the chicken croquettes which were fried balls of mush. Again, I can see where someone who had never ventured to a (*gasp!*) real ethnic restaurant, such as Cuban or Spanish, might think this was a passable example of that dish.  However, we are talking about a chain restaurant in ""the soul-less suburbs,"" so I guess I have to adjust my thinking for that.  Next up was my Louisiana pasta dish.  I pretty much ordered exactly the kind of dish I associate with this place -- an inventive (lots of ingredients!!!) rich dish that was executed at about 65%.  The chicken was thin and tender, but heavily breaded. The bow tie pasta was alright but overcooked and had almost no sauce on it -- it was quite unexpectedly dry (but hey...on the menu it listed lots of ingredients!!!!)   Also at the table was a chicken club, a burger, pasta with meat sauce, chicken tenders, and the romano chicken.  Out of the six of us, three liked their dish, and three didn't.  The cheesecake was, I guess, as good or bad as one makes it.  In other words, it looks fantastic, they have every combo of cheesecake under the sun, and it's all rich and smack-you-over the head sweet, but in varying degrees. You should order as over the top as you think you can handle....I got carried away and ordered too far over the top (Dulce de Leche.)  I really liked my husband's Original, and if there was a next time, I'd probably get the Cherry cheesecake.  Now, the service.  The list is long but somewhat entertaining in a sad way, so read on.  At least if you stick with my review, you can come out of it feeling good that at least it happened to me and not you (hopefully.)  This place HAS to have a high turnover -- no one looks happy or like they know what's going on.  Our waiter was the type that makes me want to go back later and smack once I think about how bad he was, especially considering he added our 18% tip in automatically.  My friend (a very apologetic person by nature) had to screech at him three separate times for new (alcoholic, i.e., expensive, i.e. more money for the restaurant and waiter) drinks as he whizzed by without a glance.  He took my daughter's water glass away for some reason while we were in the bathroom, and later when she wanted water I asked where her glass went and my husband said ""the waiter spilled it in my lap.""  Huh?? Was he picking it up to take away, or to refill? We don't know, but after he disposed of it on my husband, he never came back with another.  When I told him we all wanted waters (they had all disappeared) he said ""How many?""  Umm....we ALL want them.  All means ALL.  Waters all around.  Ten minutes later, he comes back -- one water short.  Now, you may think I'm picking on our poor guy, but no....there are many more people that can share the blame on this one!  Ever heard of the phrase ""Ship of fools?""  Read on to the next review, as 5000 characters can't do this place justice!"
Emily G.,"Hawthorn Woods, IL",1,37,40,3.0,7/22/2012,"Lovely atmosphere, good prices and ok food. Service always A. Big ... menu, there is definitely a selection that will satisfy everyone's tastes. Food not very good anymore:/"
Joann L.,"Skokie, IL",0,14,,5.0,7/9/2012,"I love this place.  You can go there after a movie for just desserts or enjoy meal.  No matter what you have the service has always been top notch.  The food is awesome.  And with the wide menu there is something for everyone.  The portions tend to be on the large size so if you choose not to share you can always request the lunch portion.  Or, you can just save it for the next day which is just as yummy."
Johnny B.,"Austin, TX",3,93,,4.0,3/31/2012,"My 1st time at The Cheesecake Factory. I've never been to Hooters either, but driving up to this place, I thought I was in Las Vegas. The place looked like the Taj Mahal. As I entered, it was like a Taj Mahal inside! Tell me they ain't making $$$$. I also didn't know they had  free standing restaurants. Had a short wait as we got there b4 6:00. That seems to be the breaking point. Sat at a table with a beautiful view. Ordered an appetizer of Tahini. Great choice. Very fresh and garlicky. Sweet. My companion ordered a huge salad. She is on a diet again! I had the Americana Burger. Great toasted bun with all the fillings (onion, tomato lettuce, 1000 island dressing). Fries accompany the burger. BUT, the reason I came- DESSERT!!!!! I had the white choc, macadamia nut, caramel cheesecake. WOW! Oh, do not forget the whipped cream liberally used for the topping. GREAT.  All in all, good circus, good service, good food and GREAT DESSERTS. Will return after my diet! Johnny Chitown"
Isabelle L.,"Wheeling, IL",23,499,4,4.0,6/20/2009,"You can't go wrong with the cheesecake factory when you have to feed people who have drastically different tastes: menu is huge: salads, pastas, pizza, meats, seafoods and even all day breakfast and then of course a bunch of cheesecakes to choose from.  This makes going out easy. I certainly prefer this location over the Skokie one as it offers a really nice outdoor patio in the back with a view of a man-made lake with quite a bit of wildlife.  The patio in the summer is a great place to enjoy a Sunday brunch or have a nice evening."
Jim K.,"Chicago, IL",1,12,,1.0,6/11/2014,"Had just the worst time here. Went on a date with my girlfriend and had 4 different servers who didn't even serve on us. Some of the worst service I have ever witnessed. Took about 35 min just to get bread and water on the table. Really disappointed because this chain is usually pretty good and had good times before. But the Lincolnshire location needs to find workers that want to work, and not just going through the motions...which they hardly even do that!"
Rachel H.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",57,138,43,4.0,11/16/2008,"I have been to the Lincolnshire location a few times, I usually frequent the Old Orchard location  as I work a few minutes away from there. I was introduced to the Avacado rolls by my co workers, I fell in love... with the rolls, not the co workers. The roll itself is hot ( as in temperature)and crispy, the filling is cold creamy avacado. Its like a mini explosion when you take the first bite. I usually dunk my roll in the sauce and pop it in and savor the magnafico taste! Fish taco are very good, I can never finish the entire plate,it is a lot of food. I once ordered the Chicken pot pie..It is HUGE! I was a bit disappointed I couldn't finish all of the pastry. The Cheesecakes Rock! In my quest to taste ALL the flavors, I have tried quite a few. Including the low carb....yes I go on a crash diet at times. I cannot tell you which one is my favorite, I fall hopelessly in love with every slice. I usually get the Pumpkin cheesecake during Nov-Dec. ,it is a seasonal item, you should try it if you get a chance. Reservations are not taken,the wait is always between 10 - 40 minutes, in the evenings. If you do not mind sitting at the bar, grab a table. Service includes food and desserts at the bar."
J W.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,65,,3.0,3/18/2012,Love the ambience. Its so pretty in there. And of course the desserts are delicious. But the rest is just ok. We went to the bar to get some drinks first because we had to wait 30 minutes for a table. Which is the minimum for a saturday night.  The bartenders were really rude and didnt serve us right away. And they said they couldnt transfer the bill to our table which I thought wasnt ok.  Our waitress was clueless when I asked her questions about certain meals she couldnt answer them and she didnt seem to know the menu. Maybe she was just very unexperienced.  My dinner was good not great. I wish my steak would have been a little bit more tender. The salad was ok but a little dry. And like I said the dessert was very good. We ordered cheesecake of course (I think we had the one with lime in it) and tiramisu.  Another thing is if you are looking for a more quiet/ romantic place this is not the place to go to. It gets very crowded and very loud in there.
