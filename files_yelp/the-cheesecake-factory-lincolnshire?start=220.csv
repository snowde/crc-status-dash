Patrick W.,"Chicago, IL",138,416,,5.0,4/6/2009,"Oh lets whine and moan about the fact that this is a chain restaurant and how that is incredibly evil. Yes, let's be aloof and prejudge just because there happen to be Cheesecake Factories here, there, and everywhere. Look, you're entitled to have a preference against chain restaurants just as much as I'm entitled to have a preference against Regis Philbin. There are more important things in life than to worry about what other people like or don't like. Here's what I like: the black pepper shrimp. This was a really unique flavor and dish, one I can't say I expected, being somewhat unfamiliar with Cheesecake Factory and it's 80 page menu. There really is something for everyone here, unless, that is, you want a hamburger, which they don't offer. We had the sweet corn tamale cakes, which were also very good, offering a good balance of several flavors. For dessert, on the off chance you have any room, try the low carb cheesecake. It's made with splenda but I'll be amazed if you can tell the difference, and plus it has a crust made from crushed nuts, which offers a flavor I actually prefer over the typical graham cracker crust. If you carry a bias against chain restaurants, by all means continue. I'd just as soon have a shorter line ahead of me next time I visit."
Sharon W.,"Galesburg, IL",0,13,,4.0,6/17/2014,"Went for lunch while on a mini vacation. No wait time at all. Greeted immediately by a very professional looking gentleman. I hate the tables here....not meant for large people, that is for sure! But, we got a table quickly. Menu is OVERWHELMING....sooo many choices! But, lucky for us, they can customize any order since food is made in house. I had the greek salad (FABULOUS) which I customized and they did it perfectly. I also had the buffalo chicken rolls which were amazing! Food was at perfect temp, served quickly. Waitress was amazing. Know that when you go here, it is NOT cheap! I hate that people complain....do some reasearch before you go. Not an economical lunch, definitely a splurge for most of us. Split a piece of red velvet cheesecake and it was definitely big enough to do so with some to spare! So good! Would give 5 stars if seating had been more accomodating/comfortable. OH, the man that seated us did come over and ask us if we wanted to move to a better table but unfortunately the size of the seats wouldn't change. But, overall, great experience and I would go back in a heartbeat!"
Jenny H.,"San Mateo, CA",354,456,642,3.0,12/31/2010,"This is as fancy as it gets in the 'burbs, provided that you decide not to drive your car up for valet at Fleming's. Plus the food at Cheesecake has always been consistently decent whether it's here with friends in Lincolnshire or with friends in Columbus. However, I feel that their mood lighting's a little too dim for my liking. Maybe it's to cover up the lackadaisical job cleaning up the film of oil/grease on their plates. We all didn't want to eat a full entree so we opted for the small plates. The roasted pear and blue cheese pizzette stood out. The fresh spritz of lemon and crisp arugula added a refreshing element to the pizzette. My friend's warm crab and artichoke dip felt like I was dipping into a chunky crab cake. Mmmm! Our server was super nice and accommodating. The wait was pretty ridiculous. 25 minutes? For Cheesecake Factory? I suppose for its decent quality, pricing and across the board appeal for families, large groups, high schoolers, date nights, etc it's probably one of the only go to places in town."
Kelli W.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,12,,2.0,4/6/2014,"I love the food; I hate the service (most of the time). Your job sucks. I get it. You have to handle germ-ridden dishes, cut fruit, and smile all while maintaining professional composure especially when all you want to do is roll your eyes. It's just food, and we're in America so we technically won't die without it (if it's delayed). Still, the smallest amount of empathy when something is wrong goes a LONG way. Thirty minutes for a Monte Cristo for the only guests in the restaurant is excessive. An apology from the manager instead of asking me how it's going and telling me you couldn't get the flat top to work would have been plenty. The bartender simply asked if the manager stopped by. Yes, he did, and neither of you seemed to care.  I don't need something for nothing. I don't even care that you didn't discount a thing. Simply apologize, though! By the way, if this were the only issue I've ever encountered here, this review wouldn't exist. Take pride in what you do."
Kristin B.,"Evanston, IL",24,131,,5.0,11/16/2010,"Ok, so I have a soft spot for the cheesecake factory...I can't get enough of their brown bread, salads and cheesecake!  Anywho, I felt compelled to write this review to praise the customer service at this location---it was awesome!  My mother took me out to lunch and we both ordered salads....about 3/4 of the way through her salad, my mother noticed a black and red insect (still moving!) under a piece of lettuce towards the bottom of the bowl.  Needless to say, she didn't wish to finish the salad and called our waiter over---she was very nice about it and said that she knew things like that happen, but she wasn't about to finish it!  He apologized, took the salad off the bill AND gave us a new one to go!  Then the manager came over to apologize as well--I forgot our waiter's name, but he was excellent and very attentive.  I read many reviews on the other cheesecake factory locations and they consistently mention poor service.....come to this one and you won't be disappointed!"
Alyce S.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,3,,1.0,1/13/2013,"Went there about a month ago for late night dessert. We sat in a booth close to the kitchen. Server was very pleasant. We ordered desserts and coffee.  I had placed my open purse and coat next to me in the booth. Upon finishing, I noticed to my right something moving as did my friend. We both looked, only to find cockroaches crawling on our table. We immediately went to find manager who came and said he would take care of the bill...then proceeded to tell us it was probably because they had sprayed that morning. we said we just wanted to leave but I wanted to inspect my purse and coat first. No help from the restaurant. They asked us to write down our names and phone numbers. After a week I called their customer relations department. They landed up sending me a $25 gc. Never did anyone actually contact me or my friend to even apologize. The thought of even going back there when they care so little disgusts me. We used to eat there every week. I would sincerely think about this restaurant before indulging."
Patrycja K.,"Skokie, IL",0,4,,5.0,2/16/2012,"The food here is always amazing.  The avocado egg rolls are the best!  We go there all the time because of the menu, it has numerous choices and you can always pick a different meal everyday of the week. I am not going to even mention the cheescake because it is the best I've ever had!"
Christina K.,"Vernon Hills, IL",1,97,,1.0,2/10/2009,"I dread business lunches, because it seems like we always end up at Cheesecake Factory.  I don't get it!  The food is mediocre, which has to be expected from a menu selection that tries to be five restaurants in one.  Then there's the excessive portions of food.  Who wants a double serving of bland.  I'd rather go to a family diner for what I'm sure would be better meal.  Every time I leave a Cheesecake Factory, I can't help but feel like I wasted an opportunity to eat good food."
Dean K.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",158,87,3,4.0,1/14/2009,We have been there several times.  It is a good restaurant for us to meet my parents and brother midway.  The kids also never give me a hard time about going there and that is a very good thing as they are 7 and 9.  The menu is sometimes difficult to order from so I kind of narrowed it down to 2-3 items and never switch.  The last 2 times we were there though I have to say the orders seem to come out a little on the slow side.  We go about every 4-6 weeks it seems and will continue to go there.
James R.,"Lake Forest, IL",11,5,,5.0,8/1/2008,"I like this Cheesecake Factory so much more than the ones downtown and in Old Orchard.  The restaurant is not as loud as the one downtown, and I have found that the service is better than the one in Old Orchard.  There is outdoor seating that looks onto a pond that really makes it a nice atmosphere.  I have never had a problem with the food here, one of my favorite dishes is the fish and chips, and it is excellent.  The best part is definitely the dessert menu, after all, it is called the CHEESECAKE factory.  The one negative thing is that they do not take reservations, so you may wind up waiting for a table for awhile on a busy night, but its definitely worth the wait!"
Brandon H.,"Chicago, IL",211,255,3,4.0,5/23/2006,"The latest suburban incarnation of the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory chain, the Lincolnshire location is no different than the Old Orchard or Woodfield restaurants; same meals; same cheesecake. The location is convenient for the Lincolnshire and surrounding areas though, right across from the Regal Theaters and the shops near it. It's still quite busy as it only opened a few months ago, but parking is ample and the service is above average."
Kevin B.,"Streamwood, IL",10,43,,3.0,12/23/2006,"A few months ago, my sister insisted that we go to Cheesecake Factory.  I had time limits for the night and was hesitant about going.  I hadn't been there before either, but entered the restaurant with trepidation. The wait was probably the worst part of the experience for me.  Not just the wait, but everything associated with it.  Their front entrance didn't have any place for me to sit for the 30 or 45 minute wait.  After about 10 minutes, I was wishing for a chair and ended up on the curb outside when I wanted relief for the feet.  The front had menus for me to read while in line.  I opened the menu and as people had promised, there was plenty on the menu.  Much to my surprise, I discovered advertisements in the menu.  Every other page had ads for local businesses and real estate agents.  This did not impress me whatsoever.  We all see a lot of advertisements and product placement through our day and the last place I want to find them is in my menu.  I am paying to eat there, I don't want to see ads (same goes for movies but that's another rant).  In addition to the wait and advertisement ridden menu, the restaurant is annoyingly dark.  They try to ""set a mood"" but it's a large, noisy chain restaurant.  It felt tacky and fake. Once we got to the table, my experience improved.  The food was generally above average and pretty creative as things go.  The waiter was prompt, kind, and humorous.  The lighting didn't improve, but I no longer cared as I had ordered.  The portions were quite large and prices were reasonable, especially for the amount of food I received.  If the portions were smaller, I wouldn't have complained. Maybe I went into The Cheesecake Factory with a chip on my shoulder and had an average experience because of that.  However, I cannot say that The Cheesecake Factory was a great experience.  The advertisements in the menu gave me frustration which I just cannot shake.  Call me bitter.  I know I am in the minority of people who don't think The Cheesecake Factory isn't the cat's pajamas.  I'm not against going again but I wouldn't go on my own wish.   I give it a 3 because of the food and service.  I also took into consideration my bitterness going in."
Irene J.,"New York, NY",3,109,,3.0,1/2/2011,"cheesecake factory's food is pretty standard wherever you go: flavorful, big portions, and more gluttony. i just wanted to note on the service at this particular location. i understand it was christmas eve so it was going to be busy. however, our server made no attempt to connect with us whatsoever. i've been a server myself, and there is an art to small talk, whether you have chemistry with the particular party or not. for it being christmas eve, and being in a generous and spirited mood, my server definitely did not reciprocate. i've been to this location several times and if distance weren't an issue, i would much rather go to the skokie old orchard location or even trek to the john hancock location. the dulce de leche cheesecake, however, did make up for bittersweet service."
Ann G.,"Chicago, IL",2,94,,3.0,5/22/2008,We went on a weekday night and had the worst service. I hope it's improved!!
Darlene L.,"Chicago, IL",0,195,,4.0,1/10/2010,"The voluminous menu makes this place one in which there is something for everyone.  My party of six enjoyed a variety of fish, pasta, chicken, and salad entrees.  All diners expressed satisfaction with their food.  However, I must state that while my enormous Asian chicken salad was tasty, the chicken was hard to find under a mound of lettuce.  The chef could improve this item by adding a bit more chicken and cutting back on some of the bitter tasting lettuce.  That said it was on to their signature dessert. They are currently featuring (for the year) a red velvet cheesecake which is sublime.  It contains a red velvet cake and cheesecake filling topped with a white chocolate frosting.  Six of us shared it, and it was just enough to give each person a sufficient sampling.   In summation, this place still pleases. Service is efficient, drinks are provided quickly, and the basket of warm bread is a welcome site after waiting for a table in this no reservation environment."
Lilian E.,"Evanston, IL",0,7,,4.0,5/27/2010,We went here last Sunday for lunch. No wait and we got a table outside which was lovely.  Great service and the food was very good too. I got the fried mac and cheese - which was so yummy - and a small salad. Wanted to make sure i had room for dessert! Our server brought out a small plate with bread and banana just for our 1-yr old which I was delighted with. The cheesecake was divine and even after my small meal I couldn't finish it. We will definitely return so I can try other meals and cheesecakes!
Steve S.,"Round Lake, IL",2,24,,4.0,1/18/2008,"The Cheesecake Factory is one awesome place. The menu is huge, and has something for everyone. I love the Factory Burrito Grande! It's a massive burrito the size of the plate stuffed with grilled chicken, red and yellow peppers, rice, beans, and a bunch of other fresh ingredients. My favorite cheesecake here is Adam's peanut butter fudge ripple!! That will knock your socks off. 1 slice is good enough for 2 people!! The Lincolnshire location has plenty of parking and good service."
Teri F.,"Holly, MI",32,17,,4.0,12/7/2009,It's a great place to eat. I have  been to numerous CF and this location is one of the best. All of the food is really good and of course the cheesecake is to die for.
Laura R.,"Chicago, IL",10,80,1,4.0,6/11/2007,"Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go if you have picky eaters... it seems like they have pretty much everything.  I've only eaten here a couple times, but everything I have tried has been great.  It seems like it's always packed, but we've actually never had to wait longer than a couple minutes.  The menu is at least 20 pages long though, which seems kind of ridiculous, and the advertisements on them are kind of annoying.  Last time we were there it was during the evening, and it seemed like the lights kept dimming and getting brighter.  It was really weird, and at one point it was so dark we could barely see what we were eating.  But overall, great food and good service.  Just don't go on a Saturday night unless you don't mind waiting."
Jonathan C.,"Chicago, IL",137,359,6,3.0,5/7/2008,"A somewhat smaller version of the ubiquitous big food, big portions chain.  This Cheesecake is the same as all the others.  Menu and selection are gigantic, so you won't have any problem finding something you want.  I would suggest avoiding the asian inspired orange chicken/beef, its slightsly too sweet, and it doesn't come off right.  My favorites are the parmesean encrusted chicken (on the bland, uncrispy side, but somehow compelling with the sauce) and the shrimp bistro.  On the whole the food is good, big, and unmemorible.  The Cheesecake however, should not be missed out on.   Over the years I am unhappy to report that the quality and quantity of the free bread has gone down (at all locations), its a shame and that sweet warm brown bread, really sold me on the place.  Service is good.  Good place for groups, as the are used to big ones, wait times are short at this location.  Solid.  Probably a 3.5 star place, but I will round down for now, until something stands out for me."
