James L.,"Deerfield, IL",0,1,,5.0,9/15/2017,"Fabiana  our server was beyond amazing. Service was great, request her if you can. She has great recommendations. She recommended to us the chicken Parmesan sandwhich, and it was delightful. Great choice, and again great service."
Melissa V.,"Kenosha, WI",15,26,21,5.0,7/16/2016,"By now, everyone probably knows I Love a Great Dessert ... But let's start with the Turkey Burger that was much bigger than the Bun which was scrumptious gourmet and the Service, Grand ... Atmosphere, Comfy; and the CremeDelaCreme' ... Aaah, the Dessert ... Dulce De Leche Caramel Cheesecake!!! Yummo and Why Not, It is the Cheesecake Factory.  Would highly recommend the lunch and dessert, leave satisfied and happy!!!"
Yanja B.,"Streamwood, IL",303,225,278,4.0,9/8/2014,Best location I been to. Avocado Eggroll- that is all
Inna I.,"Glenview, IL",57,17,13,5.0,10/7/2016,"Love this restaurant, love their huge portions, and drinks. Also interior and exterior are gorgeous. If I don't know where to go for dinner with husband or friends, we go there"
Antoinette T.,"Trevor, WI",0,3,,5.0,4/1/2017,"My go to spot every chance I get!  Love the service, the prices and the food!  Love the zucchini spears and my husband loves the mac n cheese bites.  Best Cobb salad ever!  Im not an avid salad eater, and this is the only place I will order one and get it every time I go.  It's like the never ending salad!  A Bellini or some green tea and the red velvet or Carmel apple streusel cheesecake to go and I'm a happy girl!"
William H.,"St. George, SC",0,10,,2.0,6/21/2016,"I've been to this particular one once before and it was ok, my wife & kids had never been to any cheesecake factory so I decided to treat them this tuesday night.  First we got there at around 6:30 and had roughly a 15 minute wait on a TUESDAY! so yes they are a busy branch.  We get seated but the hostess provided no kids menus for my 7 & 9 year olds so when our waiter came some 5 minutes later we asked for them.  I ordered the chicken pot stickers for an app with hopes that I could share with the family unfortunately it only came with 5 so 1 per person...at $12 pretty expensive for fried dumplings, they were good though. I ordered one of their flavored lemonades(strawberry) which was very sour, switched to a rasberry lemonade but it was no better. My daughter ordered the kids salmon with mashed potatoes & sauteed spinich, the salmon & potatoes were fine but the spinich was inedible it tasted like they dumped way too much black pepper in it. my youngest ordered the slider burgers & fries, no ketsup on the burger and none on the side for the fries  which I didn't notice at first and by the time the waiter returned nearly 10 minutes had passed at that point and my son had already finished one of the burgers as is, dry.  He wasn't too happy. Wifes salad was fine, other daughters garlic crusted chicken was fine, I had the fried fish tacos which are average at best, not a whole lot of flavor to be perfectly honest, I've had much better. Of course we had cheese cake which was very good.  Overall I understand they were slammed but from the time we arrived until the time we left it was close to 2 hours so everything was a bit slow and the food average at best.  For $120 bill for 3 adults & 2 kids I definitely expect more."
Aaron R.,"Post Falls, ID",127,158,66,4.0,7/11/2015,"Dirty spoons! There's the one and only reason for a less then five star review   Food: We had the ahi carpaccio which was a large portion and well presented for a whopping 13 bucks which is cheap for said dish. We tried the fried zucchini which was amazingly crispy on the outside and firm veg in the middle-outstanding texture.  The menu is vast and everything came out hot, tasty and presented well. We would return anytime.  Fix your spoon washing neglect."
Daniel S.,"Beecher, IL",32,38,110,5.0,1/31/2016,The food is always well prepared and tasty here.  The wait staff do a great job keeping up with our table demands.  This place is always crowded so be prepared to wait a little bit. Save some room for desert.  The cheesecake selections are varied and the product is always fresh.  I think on volume alone it forces everything always to be fresh simply because of the turn over.
michael w.,"Northbrook, IL",85,592,1025,3.0,5/2/2016,"They do not take reservations on the weekends but they were able to accommodate a short notice party of nine with little fuss or muss, wish I could say the same for Maggiano but nope.  I had not been to a cheese in forever and the prices on the menu have grown since I was here last, averaging 12-20 range. I am happy to report that out of nine folks no one's meal looked like a dud, they all looked yummy.  I kept it healthy and opted for the falafel salad with salmon. The server was a little lost in translation and did not manage to screw up the bill split two ways too bad, but the turn around time for the correction was a little too much.  My bourbon smash was tasty, so much so that even non-bourbon drinkers liked it. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Depends on whether you like bourbon I guess. I like bourbon, and I drink it to taste it, so imo they could have been a little more heavy handed on the pour.  Drink prices here have not changed, prices are still not posted on the menu and you can count on 10 plus for just about any booze drink.  What was nice was that lunch special prices were still in effect until 5pm on a Saturday."
David S.,"Deerfield, IL",16,4,,1.0,2/26/2017,"After waiting 45 minutes at curbside, calling 5xs to hear promises of delivery, I went inside talked to manager. She was no help.  They finally delivered our cold meal inside with no apologies."
Kristen H.,"Gurnee, IL",68,107,25,2.0,6/20/2017,"This review will have two parts since our party sat in two sections and had two different, but similar experiences. I dined here the evening of 6/16. My daughter was attending a teen friend's birthday dinner and they had a table for 8. I sat at a table with parents and there was three of us. I'll start with the parent's table. The fruit beverages were made incorrectly the first time and had to be re-done. Once we ordered our appetizers and meals, I was happy to see the number of items with a lower calorie count I could choose from and chose a chopped salad with apples. We waited a little while and then our dinners came out...before we received our appetizers. Appetizers came out a little while after. At this point, we had already started eating our meals so they were pretty much untouched. (They did get comped) We checked in with the teenagers. They were still waiting for their food. Our waitress was actually pretty attentive and kept our refills coming and apologized for the dinner/appetizer debacle (which she did not bring out). We ordered dessert and checked on the teens again; they had just received their food. We complained to our waitress and she said she would get the manager for us. I did enjoy my salad and ordered the low carb cheesecake with strawberries and it was great. I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything. We heard the servers singing ""Happy Birthday"" and thought they were singing it to our party so looked around the corner, but they were singing to another table. At this point, we had been at the restaurant 2 hours and we were done, but the teens were still finishing their dinners and wanting to order dessert. We waited. The birthday girl's mother spoke to a manager. About 20 minutes later, we moved and sat at the table next to the teens. We were waiting for their waiter to bring back change/credit cards. We noticed him assisting another table and serving them items. I'm not very comfortable with a waiter taking my credit card and then doing multiple other tasks. Once a credit card is picked up from a table, it should be ran and brought back. There is far too much fraud going on these days for a waiter to walking around the restaurant with people's credit cards. While we were waiting, the teens told us they asked for refills on their beverages but NEVER received them, had ""Happy Birthday"" sang to the birthday girl in the most dry way EVER (we didn't even hear it take place) and the waiter NEVER checked on them to see if they needed anything, if their food was ok or anything. All of our children go to restaurants frequently, many of them far nicer than this. They know how to speak up, they know how to ask for refills and they know how to behave in public. The birthday girl chose Cheesecake Factory to celebrate her 16th birthday with her friends and brought the business of 11 people there to do so. She was treated as a second class citizen. Totally unacceptable."
Ally R.,"Mundelein, IL",0,29,2,5.0,1/13/2017,"My family and I have visited this location many times over the past (at least) 8 years. The servers are always attentive. I try to order something different every visit and most dishes are hits but some aren't the best. Dessert is always to die for and are consistent. Bathrooms are always clean, too, but the dining area can use a lot of updating."
Azhar S.,"Bartlett, IL",30,90,85,5.0,7/19/2015,"Good place to eat and relax.  Food quality has always been good and the wait staff I always friendly and nice.   I usually get a big ceaser salad, pizza or nachos and split it with others since the portions are gigantic!  It's easy to get a few things off the menu and share and still feel more than full.  The complimentary wheat and white breads are always delicious and warm too.  Of course, like the title of the restaurant says it offers cheesecake.  Wow desserts are top notch here and they live up to their reputation for sure.  Excellent flavors and they get very creative with their cheesecakes.   They'll come out with seasonal flavors too like pumpkin pie cheesecake. My family loves the relaxing decor of this place. Relaxing atmosphere with dim lighting and recessed lights.  Definitely a good Saturday night place to relax."
Ed T.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,14,1,1.0,7/16/2017,"Most Cheesecake Factory restaurants are awesome and so are their Grand Lux cafes. This is the second time I've had a bad experienced at this restaurant so I have to write a review so others are aware. This location in particular has a poor staff with a lot of bad attitudes. We went there today and asked to be seated. A guy came in behind us and rudely asked for a to go menu while I was speaking to the hostess. Instead of asking the gentleman to wait until she was finished taking down my reservation she decided helped him and told me it will be 20 minutes. She forgot to write down my name and after 30 minutes passed, I decided to ask if our table was ready. She said I walked away and she didn't take down my reservation. Well I was sitting with my family in front of her and she kept looking over at my wife the entire time. I wouldn't have been mad but the fact that she gave me an attitude like it was our fault pissed me off. She knew she didn't have a reservation for us and she could have walked over and asked knowing that I had went up to the desk previously but instead she just stared. She's the Asian hostess with he attitude and as I was walking out with my kids she points me out to the other bus boys and wanted to give me the finger. If this is what type of people Cheesecake Factory likes to hire, I am done with them and the Grand Lux as well."
Stephen M.,"Lake Forest, IL",41,325,84,2.0,3/7/2015,"They have a very extensive menu, and I've never had anything good from it. The one positive for this restaurant is their late hours during the week.  This led to my last meal there.  (Last as in most recent; and hopefully last as in never again). In order of my meal: 1) avocado roll--boring although fresh; 2) meatloaf--huge but mediocre; and 3) classic cheesecake--a well earned two stars. Meals that photograph well on an extensive menu but meals that don't live up to their appearance.  Not for me."
Randy S.,"Deerfield, IL",61,24,,1.0,2/28/2016,"As a dedicated Cheesecake Factory Fan/Customer who has dined in locations around the world I can say that the Lincolnshire, Illinois location has traditionally been of of the better locations worldwide.  This is not true anymore.   A major drop  in customer service,  food quality and management.  Today we went for Sunday Brunch.   One of only 10 tables occupied.    We ordered quickly and 20 minutes later no food.    Manager came and told us the kitchen did not have the veggie Benedict prepared in advance so they can't serve it.   20 minutes to find out something we ordered was not available??    We chose an alternate entree.    It came out quickly but the rest of our order was not served.   So one person is eating while others are waiting.   And the strawberries served on a plate where overly ripe and bruised.  Add this to our last carry out orders where they lost our order and then didn't package soup correctly that spilled all over the bag and it is clear that management no longer cares.  Sadly we will not be back."
Surim H.,"Chicago, IL",215,22,19,1.0,9/15/2016,"I'm solely giving this location a one star rating because of the sloth paced service for curbside pickup. I was put on hold for about 10 minutes to phone in the order and put on hold when I called the number to pick up my order. Stop putting meet on hold! I hung up on the middle of waiting because no one was answering the phone. There's no other parties picking up and the parking lot was fairly empty on the restaurants side. Also, they need to get one of those mobile card readers. Seriously, they drop your food off at the car then walk back inside the restaurant to charge your card= more wasted waiting time. They need to pick up the pace! Was I calling in to order food or to a utility company??!"
Delphine D.,"Highland Park, IL",40,1,,2.0,1/2/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is not the best place you want to eat if your looking for something quick i have to wait 45 minutes just to get my food and i also got the wrong drink but overall there food was great
Sara P.,"Vernon Hills, IL",0,8,20,3.0,6/2/2015,"3 out of 5. I had a pasta called SHRIMP WITH ANGEL HAIR, and it was A-OK. Very blend, but only the shrimp was tasty (there are five shrimps in there). For my dessert, I ordered TIRAMISU CHEESECAKE which was delicious, but presentation wasn't great. I'd go there again for cheesecakes..."
BiggJoeb J.,"Morton Grove, IL",24,49,401,4.0,5/24/2016,Great tasting food one of the better looking cheese cake factory locations..a bit in the noisier side the only think I didn't enjoy was the wait time for food and drinks  but after a few drinks it seemed fine...lol
