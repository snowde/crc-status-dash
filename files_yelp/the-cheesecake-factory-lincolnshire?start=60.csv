Allie B.,"Chicago, IL",1088,254,470,4.0,4/8/2016,"I would eat the Oreo extreme cheesecake (or whatever it's called) every single day if I could. The happy hour menu has decent options. If you are seated in the bar area before 6, you can order off the happy hour menu. I love the factory chopped salad. I love the pasta dishes, too. The portions are unbelievably big. Come hungry but save room for cheesecake!"
Gabriela M.,"Waukegan, IL",8,19,,4.0,6/23/2017,good food its decent and so are the prices but i loveeeee the tiramisu cake omg :) plenty of parking and great staff
Igor C.,"Vernon Hills, IL",4,294,1,3.0,6/15/2015,"Three stars just because reasons. I don't like The Cheesecake Factory very much because the food is always ok but nothing special no matter what you get, the menu is too large ( they can't do everything well), it is almost always too crowded. and it just does not feel like good value for the money. I go here because my wife likes it. Mainly because they have Shrimp Scampi.   Nothing really wrong with it but I always feel disappointed."
Ann H.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,40,,1.0,6/12/2017,"Let me first say that I have been dining at The Cheesecake Factory for years - both this location and others. And I've had good experiences. Always solid. However, I doubt I'll be returning any time soon. This Saturday we headed there for lunch. My mom and I decided to get a couple things to share. As we placed our order, we were informed one thing wasn't available (grilled artichoke) - no biggie. We made an alternative selection. Overall, we were pleased with our meal. So much so that when Sunday rolled around, I couldn't get the artichoke that I didn't have out of my head. There are two locations about 30 minutes from my house. I called the location in Lincolnshire (where we were the day prior) on the off chance they might have the dish. The front desk put me on hold and told me to talk to the manager. She picked up after about 5 minutes and when I asked if they had the grilled artichoke, she replied that they did. Her tone seemed to imply I was goofy for asking. So, I explained they were out of it the day before. She said she's sorry to hear that, but said they had it now. So we headed back there for my artichoke fix. When the waitress came for our order we were informed...you guessed it...they were out of the artichoke! She also confirmed they didn't have it at all that day. Annoyed, as that was specifically why we were there and because I specifically called to check first, we explained about our call before coming in and expressed our frustration, initially asking to speak with the manager. It was late - so we decided to stay. We also told the waitress not to worry about getting the manager as we figured any discussion with her would be futile. After all, she was the one who was responsible for the frustration. We ordered two small things. An small plate of Cuban Rolls and Lettuce Roll Tacos. We waited almost 50 minutes to be served while everyone around us who arrived much later were served way before us. Because we complained? I don't know. But it is unacceptable to assure someone you have a dish when they call to check. It is even more so when you don't bother to check after they explain they are asking because it was unavailable the day before. And that kind of service, or lack thereof, when the place isn't even busy is ridiculous - especially when everyone else around is getting great service. Terrible experience. As a side note, the Cuban Rolls had good flavor - but were way too greasy. That said - the food was the least of the issue. Customer service, anyone?"
Dave K.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",54,33,3,1.0,10/1/2016,"Ugh! I'm done with this place. I ordered a half sandwich and soup. The soup was supposed to be baked potato, but they ran out. So instead of telling me, they served me their cream of chicken with artichoke and mushroom and put bacon bits, cheese and sour cream on top to pass it off as baked potato. Really??? What if I had an allergy. Shame on them. Just lost a customer."
Michele B.,"Long Grove, IL",84,288,70,4.0,11/29/2014,Stopped in before a movie and had bar snacks and drink specials--very reasonable and fast.  We made our movie! p.s. the fresh raspberry martini was awesome.
Lina L.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,17,,2.0,5/16/2017,"The food is a no brainer-delicious. I've had quite a few issues with service here. I've been told that I'll get a table in 30 minutes...took an hour and a half. I've ordered my meal with modifications for dietary restrictions...it came out wrong with ingredients in it that I couldn't eat and missing the things that I could. I asked for a new fork or for the dressing that was supposed to come with my salad, I didn't get them. I finished a dry salad.Our server was no where to be found."
Amy M.,"Kenosha, WI",0,98,96,3.0,4/5/2017,"Really awesome selection of food and very generous HUGE portions plus an awe inspiring variety of decadent cheesecakes. What's not to like? Super slow service. My coworkers and I work very close to this location and we like to go here for lunch but the last few times the service has been terribly slow. When you have an hour for lunch it makes it a bit challenging. The food is great. They even have an extensive ""skinnylicious"" menu that has a variety of salads, sandwiches, chili, and pastas that are great! I really like the lemon shrimp with angel hair pasta as well as the white chicken chili both on the skinnylicious menu. The cheesecakes are always fabulous! Generally, I get the original cherry cheesecake which is so very good! Of course with the name the Cheesecake Factory you have to do the cheesecake right! Absolutely outstanding cheesecakes!  A bit pricey but worth every penny. If you have never been to this restaurant you definitely need to check it out at least once just don't go over your lunch hour."
Carole B.,"Waukegan, IL",2,7,,2.0,1/1/2016,"Went to the one in Lincolnshire... the service and building was great.  This was our first time going to a Cheesecake Factory.  Ordered:  Fried Cheese and Calamari as appetizers... those were just OK.  Baguette and butter was yummy.  Shrimp Scampi and Meatloaf as dinners: we didn't like either dinner item. Too much seasoning, too many flavors, too much cream... shrimp scampi was coated with some odd seasoned batter, dry noodles, just not normal seasonings - meatloaf and potatoes were drowned dead in thick yucky brown mushroom sauce and the vegetables were so over seasoned... it was just too too much.  And I was excited to go because I just learned it wasn't just a cheesecake / dessert store, and my friends were raving how good it was.  Will not go again.  And what's with the full page ads in the dinner menu?  I thought it was funny that the waitress didn't ask if we wanted dessert... Cheesecake is what they're known for isn't it?  Just not for us."
Rosemary T.,"Lake Forest, IL",1,47,,2.0,7/7/2017,"Going to the Cheesecake Factory has always been the guarantee of a great meal, whatever was ordered.  Not so for the Lincolnshire restaurant in this chain.  The last three meals I had there have not been up to the Cheesecake Factory's standard.  All have been salads, one a Cobb salad that my husband and I both had.  We agreed that of the Cobb's we have had out at other restaurants, this was substandard.  The chef skimped on ingredients.  Lettuce, chopped egg, and a few other ingredients could be found.  Next two visits with friends and I ordered my new favorite ( as first experienced at the Milwaukee area Cheesecake Factory in the Bay Shore shopping area).  I tried it on my last visit to Lincolnshire and found it to be very overly-saturated with salad dressing.  I thought that maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen, so I again ordered it today while out with friends to celebrate a birthday.  It was even worse! The salad was drenched in dressing and very soggy.  The three people with me had Caesar salad that were, in their words ,""boring"".  Lettuce and dressing....oh, there were 2-3 croutons in each salad.  Our bill was $80.00 and we left feeling unsatisfied. We even skipped the free birthday ice cream sundae, as we were anxious to leave.  I will save my appetite for other Cheesecake Factories."
Ramya V.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,,1.0,11/13/2016,I usually don't write bad reviews. But am forced to write Because of the very bad treatment given to us. Three of us visited Lincolnshire Cheesecake Factory last Friday for desserts. We order two Cheesecake for there and 1 to go. The person who took order didn't mention anything like there is no seating option available only for desserts. After paying he told us to wait in the bar area where we will be served. We were initially skeptical and since it was info from the  employee we seated ourselves in the bar. The bar tender seemed not happy and when the cakes were served he called the waiter.. took him away and discussed something. Alas we were given only plates and no silverware to eat the cakes.. when we asked a person near the counter she lectured us saying u should ask form  the bar. Yet 5 minutes later we saw her in the bar. The bar tender turned toward us and said ' I know where u are coming from and u might not know.. but this is a full service restaurant and u cannot be having these here.' It was rude and sounded racist to me. He finally gave some napkins and fork.. we politely told him we are not aware and we simply followed what was told to us. After a while we felt uncomfortable in the situation and thought it is better to take home and eat in peace. So we grabbed some boxes from pastry counter and packed. As we were packing the bar tender appeared again and asked again 'do u have all the boxes that u need?'in a sarcastic tone. We felt the service was so rude and humiliated. Might be it is not common and does not happen. May be we were ignorant. But the situation could had been handled better. In the end we decided not to visit any Cheesecake Factory although how yummy the cheesecakes are. There are numerous other bakeries that treat people fair. And the name or brand does not take any value when you look down at people. And this is not the first time it happened.earlier few similar incidents happened and we thought it is some minor issues and can be ignored. It's probably because the waiter had a long day or something....but it seem to be not. It is the true nature of few people working there.
Yevgeniy B.,"Round Lake, IL",0,1,,1.0,4/9/2017,That was a worse experience I have with this location I come to restaurant about 10:30 pm and get seat right a way and wait about 10 min for server when restaurant is not busy server come and we order drinks than after 15-20 min later bring my what're and my drinks and bread and than everything start half of menu items are not available so I ask server show me what available she point try something else I am weary upset with this location. Was not clean table Serbia was unbelievably bad wait for  20 min 2 drinks when store is not busy and than you can eat what we shan't I think management of company need start checking this location and get fix issues.
B E.,"Glenview, IL",0,21,,2.0,10/17/2016,"Meh.  The Old Orchard location has much better service.  We waited 15 minutes for a table, then stood there for 10 minutes while the host tried to figure out where to put us when our table was ready.  We were seated and they were out of two of the dishes we tried to order.  Food took over 45 minutes from time of ordering to time of service.  Our waiter was very nice and friendly, but everything else service wise was really lacking.  Definitely won't be coming back to this location. Response to Management Response: Appreciate your reply however after we were waiting 45 minutes there isn't much you could have done to fix that; Being proactive instead of reactive with these types of issues would likely be the better solution as based on reading other reviews this isn't an isolated experience.  When the manager was seen just wandering the restaurant instead of helping in the busy areas that's a sign the place is in trouble from the top down."
Reggie S.,"Apex, NC",37,214,762,4.0,12/16/2015,"This chain never disappoints no matter what city I'm in. Always crowded. Food is consistently good.  Portions are always ""Americanized"" code word for ginormous. Get a salad and expect a head of lettuce. Get breakfast and expect the eggs to be ostrich sized. My kind of spot"
L P.,"Deerfield, IL",0,1,,1.0,2/26/2017,NEVER ordering carry out from here EVER again. This is the 2nd time I have ordered here and they have made me wait 45 minutes after the time they said my food would be ready! Beware if you want your food at the exact time. Be prepared to wait in a long line as well if using curbside pick up. This carryout is a disaster!!!
Karen K.,"Skokie, IL",143,187,1567,5.0,12/1/2012,"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants.  The service here is always good (along with all other cheesecake factory chains i've been to) and there are so many choices of food on the menu. Here are some things to order Every table is served warm scrumptious bread which you'll have to be careful not to get too full on these before you order your meals.   Appetizer: SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES!!!!! My mouth is drooling just thinking about these.  Pasta: Louisiana Chicken.  It's really greasy but the fried chicken they include in the pasta is very crispy and gets very addicting quickly Salad: Santa Fe.  The salad comes with your standard mexican-style items such as corn,black beans, crispy chips,etc.  However, it's light and not heavily drenched in dressing which I like.   Dessert: um... everything. literally. you can't go wrong with any choice here.. but I DO love their tiramisu cake (not the cheesecake.. although their tiramisu cheesecake is also amazing).  If you're ever coming on a weekend, make sure you make reservations or you'll be in the waiting area forever.  The prices here are pretty decent considering the portion sizes which are huge huge huge! One dish can feed 2-3 people.   Yummy!!"
Ellie P.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",215,107,44,4.0,7/15/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory has one of the best menus. Not only is it huge, but they make everything amazingly. It also had many healthy options and a skinnylicious menu."
C M G.,"Deerfield, IL",0,31,,3.0,2/17/2017,Good restaurant. Even better desert.  Highly recommend Adams peanut butter cup cheesecake.  Saturday evening's are impossible to get in. Would give it 5 stars if they started taking reservations for the weekend.
Jennifer H.,"Lake Forest, IL",2386,404,2166,4.0,10/8/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is a warehouse of dining. And yet I keep coming back for that darn ahi tuna plate. You can say what you want about chains (because goodness knows I'm not a fan) but no one disses the Cheesecake Factory! They deliver good consistent food. I've never been disappointed by a dish. But now I'm stuck on that darn ahi tuna. It's just so good! Cheesecake can be super crowded. Have a long wait time and be overly noisy. And yet. I can't stay away.  I've learned. Come here early or late. Otherwise shut your yap and accept the fact that you came at rush hour. And yes, this place is called The Cheesecake Factory for a reason. I'm going to let you figure it out for yourself. All I know is I haven't ordered cheesecake in quite some time but it is quite amazing there.  You know where cheesecake is even better! Home. Order a whole cheesecake for holidays, special occasions. Whatever. That's when people really go gaga over this stuff. Just order it on the phone and pick up on your preferred date.  So call it a chain if you must. But this food snob finds herself there anyway."
Deepanjan M.,"Highland Park, IL",0,7,,3.0,2/7/2016,"Slow and uncoordinated service I went to the Lincolnshire location on my sons birthday. We told them in advance that it was his birthday. Anyway, we ordered ok. Service was really slow. They did not bring all the entrees out  to the table together. First plate came out and the rest came almost 20 minutes later. Worst of all they did not do anything for my sons birthday. Food was ok, not great. Later when I reminded them, they brought a small cake out and sang happy birthday to my kid."
