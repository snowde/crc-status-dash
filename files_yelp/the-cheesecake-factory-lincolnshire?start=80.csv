Joe W.,"Wheeling, IL",3,20,,4.0,8/18/2015,"Cheesecake?  I suppose a lot of people go there for this.  But my sweet tooth is not what it used to be. Meatloaf?  Yes, that is where it is at.  I love this meatloaf and the succotach side.  Yummy. The ambiance is starting to be old though.  They probably need to rebrand a little bit after x decades. And although i like their cheesecake, i like their chocolate cake even more."
Sara T.,"Silver Spring, MD",195,219,654,3.0,5/28/2014,"I ordered the chicken Bellagio (breaded chicken with arugula and prosciutto over basil pesto pasta, $15). This is one of the best pasta dishes I've had at Cheesecake Factory to date. Other good options include the chopped salad, fish tacos, and miso salmon. For appetizers, the Thai lettuce wraps are delicious, but for $14, you'd expect much more quantity-wise. For dessert, I personally enjoy the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake - yum! Definitely save room for dessert.  One thing I did notice was that this particular location is not as busy as others I've been to. That is fine by me - no wait!"
Carol P.,"Rye, NY",4,88,53,5.0,9/18/2014,"Love the experience of eating here, love the decoration even with its pomposity and its varied and extensive menu. The menu is so extensive there is something for every taste, from its delicious fish tacos, to the lettuce Mexican tacos, to its fried calamari , to Asian specialties such as Vietnamese  rolls, to the original section of hamburgers, to the succulent comfort food such as macarroni and cheese or a wide selection of soups, to  meat cuts grilled or with sauces and for vegetarian clients they also have a great extensive choice of creative and tasty dishes.  For desert lovers you won't get disappointed with the wide selection of ... Cheesecakes. Love this place!"

Elina S.,"Chicago, IL",665,705,220,4.0,8/30/2012,"How have I never written a review for this place? It's an institution all around the country but I guess this specific location is the one that I make my rounds in. I would start by saying the only reason they don't have five stars is because they don't take reservations, but that makes sense to me since the place gets so busy especially on  Friday and Saturday nights during dinner rush. I love everything here, from the awesome salads, to the mini corn dogs, to the sliders, to the best wheat bread on the planet (with butter of course) to their sangria (super yummy and really hits the spot) and the finale of all finale's their CHEESECAKE!!!! It is to die for and seriously, they may have more flavors than Baskin Robbins, my personal favorite flavor is the tuxedo, it's not overly rich, but has the right amount of chocolate and white chocolate, wow I'm salivating just thinking about it now.  This place does it all right, from consistent positive service, to stellar food and drinks, to the crave worthy cheesecakes, and I mean there isn't a flavor on the menu that I didn't like. Whether it's a mom and me date, night out w/ my hubby or a last minute dinner with a bunch of friends, we always leave super full (because of all that bread we fill up on) and happy. How can you not like a place, like that? Too bad it took me like 10 years to write this review, but wait, did yelp exist then?! :)"
Patrick M.,"Chicago, IL",105,138,511,5.0,7/27/2014,Had a Cuban Sandwich for lunch today.  Added jalapeños.  It was great.  5 stars.  I'll be grabbing them to go once football season starts.  Perfect Sunday sandwich. The butter that came with the bread was really good too.
Mary Y.,"Troy, MI",1,10,5,5.0,6/16/2016,"Delicious chicken tostada salad, meant to be shared, it's an absolutely huge portion!"
Deb M.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",16,25,2,2.0,4/6/2015,"horrible service and mediocre food....  The waiter  was kind of a Jerk - told me is didn't want my steak  in my salad the way i requested it- seriously?   so i received it well done, not even the medium that she said I would get ...    LET ME TELL YA, if I wasn't with a group, I would have had a few words with him about this.    and i never never did get the lemon for my water that I asked for twice..."
Melissa H.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",151,65,119,4.0,3/8/2015,"For the past couple years after we enjoy happy hour at Kona we usually come here for dessert. Friday night we did our usual dessert stop here.  The moment we were seated my husband immediately noticed how each utensil was dirty (hence, the 4 stars). Luckily, we had a great server named Chaz who had no problem bringing us new silverware and apologizing for the dirty utensils. We decided on the banana cream cheesecake. We had never ordered that cheesecake before and our served agreed it is one of the best cheesecakes and highly recommended it. The banana cream cheesecake had the perfect amount of creaminess and cheesecake. It was also served with fresh sliced bananas. The husband and I agreed that this was the best cheesecake we had ever ordered here. To those reading this review you should definitely order it! We look forward to dining here again soon!"
Ken T.,"Grayslake, IL",3,106,,2.0,12/27/2014,"Today Saturday December 27th I took my family to dinner for my daughter in law birthday, when I arrived I mentioned that we had a Birthday in our party and the host took the information. Needless to say they forgot about it and did nothing I did mention it to one of the managers and all he said was ""well I can come over and sing, in a sarcastic manor. I would never suggest that anyone go to Lincolnshire cheesecake factory for a special occasion. It appears they are so busy they just don't care. One would think that a manager would have done something other than a sarcastic  statement. Ken Thunholm 847 814-6223"
Gaiane A.,"Glendale, CA",0,42,13,4.0,4/17/2016,"Best Cheesecake Factory experience by far. I'm from Los Angeles so we don't get the awesome lakeside seating like we did here. Beautiful place! We ordered buffalo wings and avocado rolls, which we were very happy with. The chocolate-caramel-turtle cheesecake was to die for! Also got GREAT SERVICE THANKS TO KELSEY! Overall very good location and the inside is not dark and gloomy like the CF's in LA."
Rob T.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,21,12,4.0,9/5/2015,"We'll hello there...I'm always happy when I wind up at the factory. Start off with the thai wraps or the stuffed avocado rolls, can't go wrong with either. Then a medium rare Steak Diane with a cold Stella...or perhaps the peppered Salmon with a Mojito, yum.next if you will have enough room."
William H.,"Deerfield, IL",37,41,21,4.0,4/2/2015,"I realize this is practically sacrilege - the cheesecake is the Main attraction - but the Hot Fudge Sundae here is The Bomb! The fudge casts one's palate back to CC Brown's of old Hollywood - where Hot Fudge was invented. The ice cream provides a rich, creamy foundation for the Real whipped cream, Real almonds and Real cherry on top. This is a faithful rendition of an old classic - no Wonder I like it so much.  I guess in all my previous trips I was just blinded by the vast array of Cheesecake offerings. Don't miss this."
Susan S.,"Vernon Hills, IL",121,381,2251,4.0,2/26/2014,Like the lettuce wraps and the beet dish. great tirimisu.
Jacqueline N.,"North Chicago, IL",242,104,182,3.0,7/21/2013,"Cheesecake Factory has always been a staple that has decent food everyw But I don't find it as exciting as other places. There is a huge selection of food for pretty expensive prices for what it is.  Food: -Chicken Alfredo: Not flavorful like I remembered. It was very bland and too oily. Portions are large and definitely took half of it home. HOWEVER, the day after the sauce completely separated into 75% OIL. OIL OIL OIL EVERYWHERE!! I can't believe I ingested THAT much oil. T_T I'm sure there are many other dishes that are better but this one receives (1 star) from me.  -Sante Fe Salad: Pretty good salad, I would skip the beans in this salad but it was very flavorful. (3 stars) -Tuxedo cheesecake: My roommate and I decided to try a different cheesecake based on our waiter's suggestion. This was wayyyy more cake and mousse in the layers than cheesecake. It was not as good because it didn't even taste like cheesecake, ixnay on the mousse to cheesecake ratio. (1 star) In any case, I love love LOVE their Red Velvet Cheesecake which i can eat alll day errday. (5 STARS!) Definitely going to stick with red velvet cheesecake from now on.  Still a decent place to try, especially for cheesecake but it is definitely not my first choice for actual entrees and other foods. I would prefer specialty shops for those. Will always return for more cheesecake!"
Laurie M.,"Mundelein, IL",1,22,,1.0,3/27/2017,"Looking to dine for a friend's birthday we stopped by after shopping in the plaza. We were seated and right away we noticed there was some sort of fling between our waiter, the manager, and a hostess. We sat down, waited some time for someone to stop by our table... we had to flag someone down. Finally, our waiter stops by and he had the most unenthusiastic mood. My group and I are quite cheery people and worked in retail and food service while in college therefore we are always respectful of those that serve us. Our waiter though, was very prejudice and came off as racist as well when we started ordering. We questioned his word selection and kindly requested a different waiter. We attempted to talk to the manager about this and they were too busy to be found. Another waiter took our order, but the same guy brought us our food - which we did not like. It was cold, and way too spicy. This was my first time here as I am not fond of chain restaurants, but my friends had been here many times. We just visit the sushi place next door now as we do not want to be treated the way we were here."
Steven T.,"Deerfield, IL",0,47,5,5.0,5/21/2015,"Just got back from a early supper been here a couple of times so let me suggest you go in early. We went in at 5:45pm and were seated in 5 minutes. I asked for a booth and they accommodated us. Our extremely nice and pleasant server Alvin was over straight away and brought water in a jiffy.  My son and I had burgers and fries, the meat was cooked well and exactly medium as ordered the fries were crispy and piping hot. Flat bread was delicious as was grilled artichokes and salads. After dinner we ordered carrot cake to go as we were stuffed. The meal was and service were 5 stars and we were very happy. I recommend you go at this time as this place gets crazy busy and there are long lines and of course the service and food may not be as attentive."
Isabelle M.,"Chicago, IL",36,6,4,4.0,7/9/2016,"Came here on a Saturday night. Busy but not bad. Told we had to wait 30 minutes. Time passes, we went inside to inquire on the wait because it felt like it was taking long. Turns out our beeper wasn't working.  Once inside though we got great service from Rueben. Food was good. Dessert even better ."
Lisa M.,"Glencoe, IL",0,10,3,5.0,3/22/2016,Love their cheesecake and food.....Always easy to get take out orders. Outstanding service and restaurant managers Dealt with a minor issue last time I was in and had everything taken care of swiftly. Will definitely be back! The large menu never gets boring so it's a plus.
Sung Y.,"Bloomingdale, IL",15,107,174,2.0,7/19/2015,Let me preface this by saying we love the Cheesecake Factory and have been to many many locations throughout the U.S. This by far was one of the worst experiences. It started off by taking forever to get our drinks and take our order. When our appetizer came out our server did not brink any small appetizer plates. Also I wanted to order the chicken and biscuits but after ordering was told they were out? Seriously I thought that was one of their more popular dishes? Probably won't return to this location.
