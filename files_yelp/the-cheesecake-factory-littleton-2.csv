Diane Z.,"Lakewood, CO",21,30,20,5.0,12/28/2017,Best Cheesecake to go with the best service on this side of town!  Mango Key Lime is an all time favorite of mine.
Bruce L.,"Denver, CO",53,1,,1.0,9/19/2017,"Went there tonight to pick up a Togo order from doordash. Arrived a little early and let the Togo counter cashiers know that I am there to pick up an order, and they informed they would let me know when the order was ready. No problem at all. I sat down patiently as I watched 4 other customers eventually get helped and was the last person there waiting for my order. The original two cashiers were still there as well as a third cashier who showed up later who did not know of my situation.  After patiently waiting about 20 minutes past pick up time, about 30 minutes total wait, I finally go up to the counter myself to let them know that I am waiting for my order. The new cashier looks at me and with an clear attitude to start off with and says ""Well IIII didn't know anyone was here for doordash"" with very apparent attitude in his voice, so I say to him ""Well I informed the two previous cashiers that I was here, and they told me that they would let me know. But yes, I'm STILL waiting for my doordash order."" I would not have responded that way if there hadnt been that look of disdain on his face and voice to start off with. After my response he then proceeds to aggresively put his hands on the counter as if trying to intimidate me and leans towards me and told me not to give him attitude. Clearly he had a problem with me from the start before I had even decided to give him my initial lippy  response. Granted I look like a 20 something years old, when in reality I am 30 years old, so I feel this guy got on his macho guy attitude on because he thought some kid was trying to make him look foolish.  I'm sorry but I am not some child that he can reprimand or tell me how to react to his intimidation so I just said, ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" In response to his intimidation tactics. If you are going to put your hands in a defiant manner on the counter and treat me as if I'm a child, of course I will defend myself. He then proceeds to ask me ""You gonna cuss at me?! What are you going to do about it? He was clearly trying to get a reaction out of me and yes it worked. So I told the cashier ""I'm a grown man and can cuss if i choose and fuck you"" and walked out the store. I then proceeded to call the manager of the store to explain what happened, and she keeps on saying I'm sorry if something happened to make me have a bad day? Uh yea you're cashier is ptententious ass. But by then I was so frustrated and was seeing red from being mistreated that most of my conversation with her was nothing but curse words. Been delivering from DD for two years. NEVER had an encounter like this one."
Zack K.,"Littleton, CO",396,84,6,2.0,9/17/2017,"You get two stars because of Stacey the bartender and the guy backing her up, (Jason?).  They were literally the only decent part of this entire overpriced debacle.  I've been here twice now and the first time it was fine.  I ordered their Evelyn's pasta, and being vegan, asked them to simply leave the cheese off and not cook it in butter as per the website.  No problem, done and done.  Ok, back again for a second try, as my better half wants a burger.  I order the same thing and she orders her burger on a different bread.  Ok, 5 minutes later our fill in waiter (for the waiter on break apparently) comes back to tell us the bread is shaped differently from the burger.  The burger is round and the bread is square.  Uh.  No problem.  After about five minutes of trying to fit a round burger on a square bun, we are informed we can order the other burger on the bread she wants or just take this burger on the bread it's on.  Fine, just get away from me so we can crack up.  Note, it's now been ten minutes and I have no wine I ordered.  About five minutes after, the waiter returns to tell me their ""head chef"" (quite a stretch) said the pasta isn't vegan.  I know. - That's why I said don't cook it in butter or put cheese on it.  The website says the pasta is vegan, try to keep up.  Ok, still don't have any wine and it's taken us explaining orders twice now.  Now I have a new waiter.  The IQ in this restaurant on average is remarkably low apparently.  I reorder my wine.  This Chianti sucks.  Whatever. About twenty minutes after our orders show up.  First thing I notice is my meal is literally half the size it was last time and sitting in a puddle of olive oil.  Both meals have been under the heat lamp for quite some time obviously.  I don't even have the heart to complain at this point.  My girl's burger is way undercooked.  I'm a vegan and I can see it from here.  Her salad is spring mix and the side of dressing is legit bigger than the salad.  Shoot me.  It then took fifteen minutes to get a piece of cheesecake to go that I know is frozen.  Maybe if the meathead server would have spent less time trying to hit on my lady then it would have had decent service.  At this point I'm not sure I even care about anything more than just getting the hell out of this restaurant.  I don't think we will be back ever.  Screw that.  This place feels amateur as hell.   P.S. Now neither of us feel very good.  Ugh."
D M.,"Littleton, CO",0,10,1,1.0,1/7/2018,Tried it right after it first opened.  Very disappointed!  Tried again today.  Same issues.....over priced mediocre food and service.  If you want true Cheesecake Factory food go to Park Meadows.  The portions were half of what you get at Park Meadows.   Huge tab for  nothing special.  Waiter was checked out.
Alice Q.,"Denver, CO",2578,1627,6800,3.0,10/15/2017,"The biggest Cheesecake Factory, right behind the Southwest Plaza mall. It's next to the Big 8 (Sports shop?) and there is to go parking as Always. I came in, literally the guy at the counter annoyed me, or maybe I get annoyed too quickly. None of these workers seemed happy to be there when I dined in that Friday night. Utter disappointment because the restaurant is super fancy looking compared to other locations I've been to. Left promptly and don't plan on returning"
Nicole P.,"Denver, CO",0,20,2,1.0,11/19/2017,"Arrived for brunch and hardly crowded at 11:30 am on a Sunday. Should have been my first red flag. Server was nice enough. But we waited 30 minutes to arrive cold. The chiquiles and the eggs on top were cold and the other dish presented was incorrect. When they brought the correct dish it was cold. The eggs had cheese shreds that weren't even melted and my ""crispy"" bacon showed up almost raw. We had appointments for the day and didn't have time to wait another 30 minutes for fresh hot food to arrive. Didn't even take a bite. Three $3 on table for 1 cup of coffee and were asked to ""wait"" another 5 minutes for the manager to have the audacity to walk over and try to tell us he ""had our bill"" for inedible food we didn't eat a bite of. Was planning to take home a pumpkin cheesecake for holidays and now I have to rethink dessert as this left a terrible taste in my mouth and we won't be back."
Kelli D.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",10,33,,4.0,11/11/2017,"We had a great experience when we came here for ""date night"". Our waitress was wonderful and made our dinner a ton of fun. I ordered a meal from the lighter menu and it was the perfect size and delicious. We ordered cheesecake and although it was good, it was extremely rich and far too large for the 2 of us. We were only able to eat a little bit of it. Overall a great experience!"
jon b.,"Denver, CO",32,9,4,1.0,11/18/2017,"Too busy, slow service,  three servers no communication, took 45 minutes to get appetizer so they told us it was going to be taken care of (wasn't, still on bill) almost 4 dollars for coke refill? The $14 chips called nachos weren't good at all however the dinner portions were good sized and tasty but arrived over 1 hr after being seated. We arrived at 7:30 We're seated at 8 but were late for 10pm movie cross the street.  Good thing the daughters b-day is only once a year"
Glenn C.,"Fairplay, CO",1,91,1,2.0,11/12/2017,Went here for lunch on Saturday. Service was slow. Food was ok. My breakfast Monte cristo was soggy.
Raylan G.,"Denver, CO",0,7,2,1.0,1/8/2017,"SLOWEST Cheesecake Factory on Earth! This location doesn't compare with the rest of them. The food tastes great- but getting it is another story! Longest wait with approx. 22 EMPTY tables...and I mean, they've been sitting empty for over 35 min with approx 42 customers waiting to be sat. I've been here many times and it's always the same. The waiter or waitress always says ""I'll bring you fresh bread when it's ready, but there's none right now."" Every. Single. Time.  Wait staff is not attentive to their tables the way they are in other Cheesecake Factories. I strongly feel corporate needs to visit and whip this new location into shape because their service is terrible and they move like turtles. I literally only come here because it's so much closer than the other CCF locations. :("
Ronnie K.,"Denver, CO",0,39,,1.0,9/10/2017,"I tried contacting management like the person who responded to my review said to, with zero response back. They truly don't care."
Veronica V.,"Columbine Townhomes, Littleton, CO",7,3,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Horrible service and management is clueless. I truly believe that when you receive bad service it is not the servers fault it is the managements fault, as a GOOD manager you should be touching the tables and assisting your servers when there in need of help. There is no reason why the manager was on the expo line when it wasn't busy, The management team should be checking on the guest, cleanliness of the restaurant and making sure her staff is up to standards.  Get this restaurant up to standards.."
Heidi P.,"Littleton, CO",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"That was the worst birthday dinner that I ever had in my life. I always went the cheese factory at park meadow mall; but they opened a new one at southwest plaza. Therefore, I planned my birthday dinner over there; but it was so so so upset me. First, the food was made wrong. Second, service was awful. Third, after I talked to the manager and he had done nothing. Forth, after I talked to manager, everyone acted differently. The waitress had to leave because her ride was here and she didn't want to spend money for Uber. The bus boy tried to make us leave by clean everything on the table ( especially the water that I still drinking). The new waiter told me:"" just tell me what you want to pay!"" After I mentioned that today is my birthday. Do I get a cheese cake for free? I usually a easy personal and not complain. Because I have 2 friends work at cheese factory that they told me the host suppose ask if we have any special events going before they sit us; but the host didn't ask me anything. Bad service, nobody sing and no cake ( even I mentioned it) Well, overall, it was the worst birthday dinner I ever had."
Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",227,850,,5.0,4/4/2017,"The new Chicken Riesling is remarkably delicious.  If you got this in the fanciest restaurant in Denver, you'd be happy with it.  Highly recommend!"
Linda H.,"Littleton, CO",36,1,1,4.0,9/20/2017,I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory. I am never disappointed.  This time I tried The Chicken Medira. The menu stated it was the most popular dish. I wondered how I had never tried it before.  The mushroom Medira sauce was heaven. I was hooked at the first bite.  The service was great. The portions huge so there is plenty of leftovers for tomorrow. I would definitely recommend giving it a try.
Aivy T.,"Littleton, CO",68,21,37,3.0,2/21/2017,"I went to cheesecake for a late lunch with my family. Our server was nice, but it was hard to get a hold of her. It was not that busy, but she did not check up on us often. We had to wait a while for her in order to get our check.  I ordered the shepherds pie and was not very satisfied. The gravy they used was too salty and there were enough mashed potatoes to mask the taste. There carbonara was also pretty oily as well."
Pur O.,"Englewood, CO",0,24,,1.0,9/3/2017,The management of this restaurant is stunningly arrogant. Their food is below mediocre. Service is normally below average or worse. We have eaten there for the last time. We will not be ripped off again. Absurd that when they respond to these comments they just refer you to their website and to wait a few days. Better customer service at Waffle House . Avoid this location
Jen N.,"Littleton, CO",50,13,15,4.0,3/1/2017,"This place is just as you think. You come in, big menu, lots of cheesecake. I had the skinnylicious chicken pot pie and it was not skinnylicious tasting which was awesome!"
Emily H.,"Denver, CO",95,2,,5.0,8/23/2017,Jess was our server tonight and she was wonderful! Made sure that we were always taken care of but wasn't constantly at our table either. The food was delicious as usual- loved the stuffed mushrooms! The only thing I don't love is that the cocktail prices aren't on the menu so my drink was more expensive than I thought it would be. Drink was still good though!
Lo O.,"Littleton, CO",5,86,63,4.0,7/20/2016,"Offered to take my Mom to breakfast for her birthday, she chose this place. I figured it must be good because she has been here around 10 times since they opened and she is picky.  We went on a Sunday morning when they opened at 10AM.  No wait, friendly faces were ready to greet us.  Love the decorating in this place, it's gorgeous. We were sat at a roomy booth. They have a good selection to choose from for Breakfast and Brunch.  I ended up copying my Mom but wish I would have ordered the Eggs Benedict or an Omelette.  We ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon. She got the bagel with it and I ordered the english muffin with mine.  Eggs were cooked perfectly! For both of us. Bacon was good too. Potatoes were so dry, maybe overcooked?  Her bagel was good and my english muffin was huge and delicious.  Our server was friendly and good."
Jamie B.,"Littleton, CO",0,6,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Soooo slow.  Service was slow and not very friendly and waited 55 min to get our food.  It was 7:00pm on a Sunday so busy, but not crazy busy.  Don't think we'll be back anytime soon."
Kevin F.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,6,,2.0,8/16/2017,"Pretty disappointed.  Maybe they have issues staffing the kitchen?  45 minutes wait on food.  Waiter kept coming by apologizing and saying ""it's coming right out"".  Not until we got manager on duty was their issue explained.  I get things happen, but all the wait staff look super harried and stressed.  Wound up asking to have food bagged up to take home.  Manager comp'd some cheesecakes and those were good.  But, I'm telling you as if this review posting, avoid this place for now till they unscrew themselves.  Too many dining options around here to deal with this."
Josie M.,"Littleton, CO",0,12,,1.0,9/10/2017,"A visit to the Cheesecake Factory used to mean a special occasion, because of the varied menu, great service, and tasty food. We, too, were excited about the Cheesecake Factory coming to our area. What a huge disappointment. We've given them sooooo many chances to change our minds, and they keep failing, failing, failing - on all levels. The food is sub-par, over seasoned (even the kids' plates), and greasy. You have to beg for bread and butter when you order to go and still don't get it. Their attitudes reek of apathy. When we have ordered to go online, we have called to ensure they have gotten our order correctly. Even with this over-kill and their arrogant assurance that they will get it right - they have gotten it all wrong, time and time again. We finally contacted a manager, who promised to send a $20 gift card for recompense (even though we spent over $50 for another messed-up family meal). Weeks later we got the gift card......  Guess what? Went to use the gift card today (why did I do this - meal was horrible!!), and it was for $10. Even the manager can't get it right! An organization is reflective of its leaders .... it is apparent that a completely NEW management team needs to come in and clean house from the bottom up. Hoping this newer restaurant will be able to get their act together before it's too late. PS - I do not need a response from the management. Won't do any good."
Taylor P.,"Pine, CO",0,10,,4.0,8/23/2017,"I would give this place 5 stars because of the food! But the service is what brings it down. We have had great service here once, but the last 3 times the service was just ""ok"" and the host staff wasn't very friendly. If they could get there service better this place would be perfect."
Jason G.,"Morrison, CO",0,5,,1.0,5/14/2017,"This place is a bad joke! Worst restaurant experience I've had in years!! Too start we were served water in scratched plastic mugs with water marks and specks of food. Me and two people I was sitting with had to ask for new mugs. My second mug was also speckled with food. My dad got fed up and went to the bar to get me a PROPER GLASS from the bar and a to go cup for my brother. My silverware consisted of a rusted spoon and water marked fork and knife speckled with food. A table next to us had a wobbly table leg bieng propped up by a MENU. That's right a MENU ON THE GROUND HOLDING UP THE TABLE. On to the service. Staff was dismissive and curt. No smiles and and appeared to spend more time caking their face with 1/4"" of makeup than polishing silverware. The manager was polite, but very curt as well and when I tried to find him about the silverware my waitor tried to yank it out of my hand and told me I had been ""doing nothing but complaining all night"". REALLY?! My mom had to ask twice for a glass of wine and my dad had to get up and go to the bar to get water. The food. My dad's tuna was tough and served with tomatoes that did not have the brown stem part cored out. I worked at einstiens for 10/hour and would not dare serve a tomato like this. Plates had wipe marks and saucy hand prints from the ""cooks"". Even though ordered at the same time, his came out before the before the rest and eventually was sent back. WOW"
Shane B.,"Littleton, CO",260,8,,1.0,4/30/2017,Went there to celebrate a family occasion. Had five people total. They serve the food one by one. So the first person was almost halfway through eating before everyone else was served.  Very disappointing.
Gary H.,"Littleton, CO",2,12,1,1.0,3/27/2017,"Honestly the food was delicious. I'm a 6 foot tall full grown man and the portions were ridiculous. Just way to much food. However that would be the least of our problems. In a half full restaurant it took our server 16 minutes to acknowledge my wife and I. It would take 10 more minutes to actually get our drinks. We had to practically beg for bread for the table. The food came out at a reasonable time, however we were lucky we didn't require anything else for the table because once again our server was no where to be found. While we ate the couple at the next table we're getting refunds and apologies for the exact same problems. Lol. We would never see our server again until the time to pay.   We ate here about a year ago when it first opened and received the exact same treatment but chalked it up to a new staff. We gave it some time and finely went back to give it a second chance. Because of this decision I now question a lot of decisions I've made over the years. Lol.    I'll get it to go from now on. Save 3 hours and 80.00.  This locations service gets 0 stars!"
Ed G.,"Littleton, CO",33,178,6,2.0,6/13/2017,"I would say that 2 1/2 stars is what this place deserves. It gives me about half of what I expected. The cheesecake factory used to be awesome it's gone downhill over the last few years and the new one at Southwest Plaza is no exception. The quality of the food, the service, just the whole experience overall. I always try to give them another chance but I don't think I'm giving them any more chances..."
Rodney A.,"Littleton, CO",0,23,,2.0,10/3/2017,"If you're loaded, and have time to burn, and a lot of tolerance the food is good.  But its insanely overpriced and they are helplessly understaffed.  Average cocktails for 12 bucks that take the staff 20 min to get to you.  When you are charging over 20 bucks a plate please bring all the entrees for the table out at the same time.  Painful in so many ways"
Jennifer N.,"Littleton, CO",7,48,23,1.0,6/9/2017,Met a friend tonight for happy hour at 5pm. The 2 female bartenders provided horrible service. We sat there with empty glasses most of the time.  They were busy washing and stacking glasses and chatting but ignoring most people sitting @ the bar.  I've been here before for HH Monday through Thursday and that male bartender is fantastic.  He could certainly give these women a lesson in customer service.
Heather N.,"Arvada, CO",1,14,5,5.0,3/13/2017,The staff was amazing...I've never actually eaten at this facility...i was working on a job site in the parking lot and went into a hypoglycemic low and walked in and the gentleman at the counter quickly got me a soda to help being my sugar back up.  Ky was the guys name and he was very helpful.  He didn't even question me when i stumbled in acting almost drunk...if you don't know someone has hypoglycemia one would assume the person is drunk or on druids or something but ky was very nice and quick and didn't even charge me for the soda.  Thank you very much.
Kelly C.,"Pensacola, FL",7,16,2,1.0,8/7/2016,"If I could I would give 1/4 of a star. 4 brunch plates ordered. 2 of them missing part of the meal 1 made incorrectly the other one lost and finally came out with burnt eggs and in toasted bread. Manager seemed unapologetic and comped 1 of the meals.. Should have comped half of them if not all of them. We almost walked out on our check  It is sad we love cheese cake factory but this performance is very horrible. Blamed on ""food inspection"""
Candace M.,"Spokane, WA",275,671,1126,3.0,12/25/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. The food is good, the portions are huge, the menu is large, and the lines are long. In these ways, this location is pretty standard. I'm boring and when I go to the Cheesecake Factory, I almost always get the same thing: a grilled artichoke and a beet salad. The grilled artichoke was delectable, as always. The beet salad didn't have a ton of beets in it, but wasn't bad. Our waiter was very nice and friendly.  I will say that this location is a lot smaller than I expected. The bar is relatively small, so it's not somewhere you can rely on if they're busy and want a relatively quick meal. We were seated in a booth and were practically on top of a family of 4 next to us. We got to hear all of their conversation. Not ideal, especially for somewhere with atmosphere goals like the Cheesecake Factory. I got a mojito and it was very good, but $12.50. We took cheesecake home and it was also quite good. My only complaints have to do with the service. This is clearly still a new location, and there are some kinks to work out. When we got up to the host stand, what appeared to be a group of teenage girls stood around talking to one another, ignoring us until they were at a good place in their conversation. Really? Your one job is to greet and seat. Maybe focus on doing that. Also, we were ready to go and were just waiting on our cheesecake, which took way longer than any other part of our meal had. I would imagine this would be pretty easy so I'm not sure what the delay was. Otherwise, not a bad visit. It's pricey, so we may not be back with much frequency, but it's nice to have it in the area. It'll be even better when they work on the service a little more."
Anna F.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,1.0,2/18/2017,"My kids love this place, so we've given it a few tries now. Tonight was our last, at least for this location. We called from the mall to see what the wait was, and were told 30 minutes. When we walked in 2 minutes later, they said it was actually 55-75 minutes. After waiting 80 minutes, we were finally sat. Unfortunately, they were 0 for 4 on our meals. Kid's food didn't come out until 10 minutes after adult's food. When it did come out, it was so salty as to be inedible. My white chicken chili was cold, and my husband's food tasted off. We told the server we'd like to pay for our drinks and apps and leave. To her credit, the manager did not charge us for anything. This is on top of a couple prior disappointing visits, so we will no longer be patronizing this location."
Juliet S.,"Mountain Gate Condos, Littleton, CO",1,5,,1.0,1/9/2017,"Ate here twice in the moth of December, only because we had gift cards to use.  Worst service, food, experience both times.  If you want a good Cheesecake Factory experience go to the one at Park Meadows."
Bryan B.,"Littleton, CO",2,35,8,4.0,1/14/2017,"Floors were very dirty when we got to our table but was eventually cleaned up. Had the carbonara. Had a good sauce with it at the bottom of the dish.  The pear martini is really unbelievable, rich and very fruity. I always get the Godiva cheesecake for dessert. Overall a good place to go when there is no other place to go."
Joanna B.,"Denver, CO",67,48,9,5.0,1/31/2017,"It's Cheesecake Factory.  You can't judge it by one bad or good experience, it is what it is! I like the location and the value it adds to Southwest Plaza Mall. They offer Happy Hour from 4-6 pm with food and drink specials.  You know how it works.  Enjoy the atmosphere with this great addition to Littleton!"
Pam F.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,,1.0,4/30/2017,"This is the worst restaurant I have ever dealt with. We have used Door Dash 3 times to deliver their food and Cheese Cake Factory had messed up the orders every time!!!! They made a breakfast burrito when we ordered the regular burrito.  We ordered shrimp and got salmon instead. Had been waiting another time for our food to be delivered from Door Dash, and when it was taking forever, we contacted Door Dash and they told us that the order never got acknowledged at the Cheesecake Factory!!!  Had called at an earlier time and spoke to a manager of Cheese Cake to complain about the burrito, but he had no customer service skills, as all he could say was it's Door Dashes problem.  He never apologized or said they would re-make the order!!!!   We have been to the one downtown and at Park Meadows, and they are both great! But this one at Southwest Plaza is HORRIBLE!!!!!"
Laura L.,"Denver, CO",105,104,33,1.0,6/12/2016,"Service was extremely slow and the manager who came by to apologize for the wait almost seemed like it was a drag for him to go to each table and explain what was going on I wish I would've saw the reviews beforehand!  The staff were standing around talking amongst eachother, not paying attention to their tables at all:[  The one star is for the 2 servers behind the cheesecake  who helped me get a couple slices to go! They were attentive and so friendly!"
M J.,"Golden, CO",0,12,2,1.0,12/5/2016,"Rotten avocado served on my $13 chicken sandwich.  I showed my server and she didn't take my plate away or apologize but agitated said she would bring me a few slices of avocado.  I guess she just is not familiar with avocado in that when it is past its prime it is no longer firm but mushy and liquid in that the rotten remains were all over the rest of the produce and baked into my chicken.  In addition, I waited for over five minutes to even get my non-rotten slices so at that time my food was cold and soggy.  I've been to all of the surrounding Cheesecake Factories many times and this particular restaurant clearly shows its lack of training."
