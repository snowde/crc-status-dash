Shauna T.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,,1.0,2/3/2016,"I've come to discover that The Cheesecake Factory is totally over rated no matter which one you go to.  My husband and I went to the SW Plaza location a couple weeks ago for lunch. Two lunch entrees,  two pieces of cheesecake,  a margarita and an iced tea cost exactly $80 including tip!!! It was 3:00 on a Saturday and they were out of the first thing I ordered, a Cuban sandwich, really?!!?  The huge menu is a ruse because our waitress then gave us a huge list of everything they were ""out of"".  My husband's pasta was scalding hot while my roast beef sandwich was luke warm at best. Our food was ok, not great. Portion sizes are very good. I had the prime rib dip it was served on a soggy hamburger bun! Really? It took 30 minutes for the food to come to our table and the seating sucks.  If you're not at a booth or a bigger table,  you're sitting in a chair/booth combo table on top of your neighbor.  I was so close to the woman next to me I could hear her clicking her dentures and I know all about her relatives in Schenectady.  Yes,  the cheesecake is amazing,  but don't even bother eating it there,  order it up front and take it home!  Don't waste your money or time on this place!"

Elise R.,"Littleton, CO",0,1,,1.0,2/21/2016,Southwest Plaza cheese cake was horrible. We go here very very often I was amazed at the horrible service and when I asked to talk to manager he was very rude. I will never go back to the southwest plaza location they should be ashamed of the chimsey food and horrible service
Randy S.,"Littleton, CO",0,5,,1.0,2/20/2016,"I am a person who HATES to give bad reviews, But in this case I feel I have to. So far this place has been a total disappointment. We have gone twice. The first time was just before Christmas and they had not been open long. We got there at 5:30 and they said there was a wait of 2 hours. There is extremely little seating to wait. They are in a mall so you would think they would have a way to page you anywhere in the mall. Everyone has cell phone and a simple text should suffice. But they only have the standard blinking pager. This you can't get as far as the main mall hallway. So you have to stand for two hours or just guess. We guessed and made it back 30 minutes early only to be told it would be another hour and a half. That is a 3 hour total wait! My wife is diabetic and we timed to make sure she wouldn't have any issues. We ended up waiting 3 and a half hours and the food cane out cold. The apologies profusely and compped us desert (great idea for a diabetic). But I decided to give them a second chance. They were new and it was the holidays. Mid January we tried again. Once we decided not to wait again for a 2 hour wait (once bitten, twice). Next time we went back at 4:00 on Saturday we didn't have long of a wait. However, we had to wait 45 minutes between the time we ordered and for ANY food to arrive. Then everything came at once. Bread, salad, and main coarse. And my wife's Shepard Pie was again cold. Also, the had a very young woman with very long hair who was part of the seating staff hanging around the wait staff station, doing her best flirting not 10 feet from where we were eating. Amd part of her flirting was constantly flipping her hair around. This time when we complained to the manger, she just say ""Sorry about that and nothing else."""
Tiffany D.,"Littleton, CO",0,47,15,4.0,1/10/2016,"Our server was definitely on drugs when we went the first day this place opened but he was friendly and tried to explain the menu to the best of his ability. I did ask some tricky questions, I suppose.As expected, there were many things that didn't run smoothly but we were there for the food we love. Because it was their first day open, I expected a little chaos but it was overall a good experience!"
Megan H.,"Littleton, CO",112,15,6,2.0,12/6/2015,"I have been to several Cheesecake Factory's over the years. While I'm typically not a big fan of chain restaurants, CCF is usually pretty good. We did have a large party of 8, so I figured it would be a long wait for a table. In addition, I also assumed there would be some hiccups in the service considering they had only been open a week. When we finally got seated after an hour and 15-minute wait, it took FOREVER for anyone to even come to our table. Like, probably almost 15 minutes...just to get our drink order! I ordered a glass of the Matua Sauvignon Blanc which was $2 cheaper per glass than the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. I love Kim Crawford, but sorry - I'm not spending $10.50 a glass when I can get a bottle for $13 at Costco. I also asked her the difference between the regular chicken salad sandwich and the Skinnylicious chicken salad sandwich, as there was $1 difference in price and nothing looked different in the 2 descriptions. She said the only difference was that it came with salad instead of fries. I asked her to clarify because the regular one, you also have the option of getting salad instead of fries. She said that was it. Fast forward 55 minutes (yes 55 minutes because that's how long it took to get our food once we'd ordered), and here were the issues. I went with the Skinnylicious version of my sandwich because I always get salad with it anyway, and it was barely even HALF the size of their regular portion. I was basically starving at that point, so I wasn't super thrilled to get half the amount of food for only $1 less. Also there was maybe a tiny drizzle of dressing on the tiny salad. They brought the wrong thing completely for one person in our party, but she didn't want to wait any longer so she just ate it. The manager did come over and apologize for the food taking so long but it was all of 3 minutes before it actually did come out. I asked our server when she came back to the table if the sandwich was smaller than the regular portion (because hello, I'd specifically asked her what the difference was between the 2 and this wasn't mentioned), and she said, ""Yes it's smaller, but it is the Cheesecake Factory so all of our portions are big here."" ?!? Okayyyyyyy, thanks for the lecture, and you should have told me that to begin with because I would have spent the extra $1 and gotten the amount of food I was expecting. At the end of our 2+-hour dining experience, we receive the check. And she had charged me for the Kim Crawford wine rather than the Matua that I'd ordered. When she tried to argue with me, 3 people at my table confirmed they'd heard me order the Matua. Mind you, it was family I was with, so if I'd ordered the wrong thing and didn't realize it, they definitely would have told me. She huffed off to adjust the bill and was rude to everyone the last few minutes we were there. I'd be happy to give them another chance, but I think I'll wait a while until the staff (including management) offers a little better service."
Kelly W.,"Golden, CO",0,16,,2.0,11/22/2015,"Food was pretty good. There were way too many staff working. All staff members were confused because everyone was doing everybody else's job. Other staff just stood around. The manager could use better people skills. There was a long wait time once food was ordered until being served. This review is for my first experience at this location. Like others have said, service may improve with time."
Tonio R.,"Denver, CO",0,8,,5.0,11/30/2015,Just got back from the Cheesecake Factory and all of our food was delicious! Our waitress Debbie really had set a new standard to going above and beyond on customer service and had truly made my experience here a great one to remember. I will certainly be back for some dessert I was just too full today.
