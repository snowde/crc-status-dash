Mary Ellen T.,"Littleton, CO",20,2,,1.0,3/30/2017,"Usually really like CCF and was excited when this came to Southwest Plaza.  Have been here several times and each time the service is terrible. The manager is just awful and barely acknowledged our concern.  Skip this location, save some $ and go to Chilis because it is about the same level of service and experience.  Won't be going back to this location again."
Susan D.,"Littleton, CO",11,79,30,5.0,8/2/2017,"Just tried their Factory Chopped Salad this week. It was VERY tasty. And I also tried the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake-OMG, one of the best desserts ever!"
Doyle O.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,7,,2.0,5/8/2016,"Interminable wait for good food. We tried to call for reservations because we had a group of 8 but this location wouldn't take them. Instead, we were told to get there early and there would be no problem. This was a birthday lunch for my wife. We arrived at 11:15 for the 11:30 opening. Our group was third in line, behind two couples. The doors were opened promptly at 11:30 and we walked to the receptionist station. We were told that they couldn't help us there, to go to the other station. The other station was 6 feet away behind the same counter.  We were told to go stand by the cheesecake display case and wait. Other groups were being seated, including 2 different groups of 7. One of us went to the counter and asked when we would be seated and were told that we would be seated as soon as possible.  Finally, at 11:45 we were taken to a corner booth. We ordered and then began the wait. Bread came...another batch of bread came...our drinks were refilled. No food. I was getting ready to go ask about our meals when a meal was delivered. Great, I thought, here comes our food. This was at 12:30. We had been there for an hour and one of us had a meal. No other meal showed up. After five minutes (12:35) my meal came. So 2 of us had meals, but politely waited for the others. At 12:40 two salads came out. Then the rest of the meals showed up. So we started eating about 12:45...an hour after we were seated and one and a quarter hours after we walked into an empty restaurant. We finished eating and were presented with the bill. We were never asked if we wanted dessert, just given the bill and we left the restaurant at 1:30. This may have been the slowest service I have ever experienced."
Lindsey U.,"Denver, CO",0,3,1,1.0,9/24/2016,"If I could give 0 I would! First time in about 5 years going to one of these chains. We live close and wanted to try something new, never again will we go back here. 11.50 to 12.50 for a drink you can't taste any alcohol in. For two of us we spent over 110 in under and hour! Waited 15 mins for a second round of drinks. The food is ok, waaaay to big of portions! Our waitress smelled of smoke not only when we sat down but every time she came to our table, we would ask her what she suggested and basically got it's all good. The tacos I ordered had a sweet cabbage that wasn't listed on the ingredients and did not taste good with tacos. The bread was hard as a rock. 11.50 for 4 fried mac and cheese bites! An appetizer for two? Seems pricy. We could have gone to the melting pot for close to this price.  Please don't waste you time here, go something worth the price!"
Tim L.,"Littleton, CO",0,21,1,5.0,1/15/2017,"This place is great. We were so excited when we learned that we would be getting our own Cheesecake Factory!  We have not been disappointed. The food is consistent, the staff has been great, and the menu has something for everyone. Some people complain about the length of the menu, but to us it's just more of a reason to go here. Great lunch specials. We will go back!"
Annie L.,"Denver, CO",52,4,,1.0,7/2/2017,My friend and I went back after a good experience.  The wait staff was ok and the food was awful!  Never again!  I got an upset stomach from the meal and I will be contacting the health department!
David C.,"Denver, CO",2,33,3,4.0,3/11/2017,"We've had good luck here.  Bellagio chicken - a favorite, 5 stars Steak Diane - 4.5 Chicken sliders - 4.5 Pit Dip Beef - 2.5 stars Dynamite shrimp - 5 Chicken Piccata - 3 Orange chicken - 2.5"
Carey F.,"Durango, CO",23,27,,4.0,12/9/2016,"Love their apps: spinach dip is my favorite, love the large green chilis in the quesadilla, and fried chicken sliders are tasty and filling. Always great service !"
Michael C.,"Littleton, CO",1,6,5,2.0,2/22/2017,I appreciate the quick response.  I will be taking you up on your offer to contact you directly.
Kathy C.,"Denver, CO",5,72,1,2.0,1/17/2017,"The Cheesecake premium reserve was fantastic wine.  My partner ordered the Shepard's Pie which he said was delicious.  I ordered the vegetable salad with chicken.  The asparagus was chopped so small, that it was hard to tell what it was.  The other vegetables were so small that they all fell to the bottom of the bowl.  The chicken was cold.  Overall, a tasteless and bland salad.  We ordered the Kahlua cheesecake for dessert and it was okay, although it didn't really taste like cheesecake.  The service was good, I would go back, but choose a different entree."
Adam V.,"Lakewood, CO",2,44,7,2.0,8/21/2016,"My previous review -- it was a little uninformed, I'll admit. Not only have I been educated on how several main dishes (besides the cheesecake) are here, I'm underwhelmed for sure. I have a friend who works at this restaurant. With that come a myriad of free dishes she receives. She happens to love it, which is odd because we have very close palettes. We love the same foods/flavor combinations. However, the main dishes here are just SO bland.  Thinking back, I've also always been really let down by the food here. It's fine, but nothing special. Especially when you're dropping over $150 on a special occasion. That much money makes you want to keep your head down and just eat it to justify the marginal main courses.  Having to put salt on food in such an ""upscale place"" is weird and embarrassing. At both locations, I've been very unimpressed. They pastas need way more garlic, the sauce is so vague tasting. The chicken is usually dry and flavorless, and everything else is almost a tease of the potential. Most of the cheesecake is good. Stick to the light fluffy ones. The dark chocolate rich type is a stroke waiting to happen.  My only theory is that this is an American themed place, so the average American person will complain if it has too much flavor.  Just a guess, but it's sad."
Jim M.,"Littleton, CO",0,17,,2.0,9/16/2016,"Cheesecake Factory has a great menu and the food is good. The service is lacking and needs improvement. Recently ordered a burger which was took in excess of 25 minutes until I inquired about the timing. I was told that well done burgers took longer, a fair retort. When the burger showed up after 30 minutes it was rare! No apologies, just a promise to cook another one which showed up in 10 minutes. I have noticed slow service a couple of time now at this location. Expect more from this chain. Stay on top of your servers!!!!"
Carrie D.,"Littleton, CO",156,336,10,1.0,2/7/2016,"I don't usually give bad reviews, but I have to say something this time. We came to this Cheesecake Factory in hopes of a nice meal. The wait was over an hour, so we decided to order food to go. They said it'd be about 25 minutes, which was fine. The girl who took our order was friendly and courteous. Great! So we waited. After about 35 minutes, I went to check on the food. Apparently the people taking orders don't speak to one another because the lady at the register didn't have any record of our order because 'the other girl must have helped you'. Seriously? So they found the girl who took our order and after looking for a few minutes, she found our food stuffed on a shelf behind the register. Again, Seriously?! So we took our food, home and big surprise, it was cold. Not like room temp cold, almost like it had been refrigerated cold... We were hungry so I nuked my and my husband's entrees. We ate the food. Mine was still not warm after 2 minutes in the microwave, so I gave up. The only thing good about our order was the cheesecake. To put the cherry on top of a bad experience, I got a nice dose of food poisoning from my dinner, so for 12 hours, I was in agony, with vomiting, dry heaves and terrible, sharp stomach cramps? Once I recovered, I did call to let the manager know and he told me that the dish I had, the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp, was a very popular dish and he hadn't had any other reports of food poisoning. It kinda felt like he was telling me it wasn't their fault. But after not eating all day, having that reheated/cold meal and then 4 hours later being stuck with my head in the toilet, it kinda seems like that food probably was the culprit. Sorry, Cheesecake Factory, this was an experience I just can't get over. We won't be back."
Ray Y.,"Littleton, CO",0,2,,1.0,12/28/2016,Horrible service tonight in the lounge area. Gabriel should not be a server. Our food took almost an hour before it was placed on our table. Then my steak tacos where cold and dry. I did send them back and asked for a fresh  hot plate. They tasted great the 2nd time around! The server did not even ask how the tacos where. Not even a manager asked how things were. As I was walking out I couldn't help over hearing another customer complaining about the service. It's really nice having a Cheese Cake Factory near by. But if this is the service we are going to get from the South West location I would rather go to the Lone tree or Downtown Cheesecake Factory for a more professional experience.
Jeremy D.,"Denver, CO",0,1,,5.0,5/26/2017,"Had a business lunch with two others and our waitress, Amanda R was awesome! Her service was exceptional. Thank you!"
Martha Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,36,39,1.0,9/18/2016,No bread... no avocado rolls... took 10 minutes to have a waitress to come take our order. This place was doing well when they first opened. Guess there's too many unsatisfied customers that they only had one waitress. Horrible birthday experience.  Food wasn't well prepared sat in our table for about 5 minutes and left. Pumpkin pie cheesecake was great that's the only reason for a positive star.
Evette R.,"Red Cliff, CO",62,6,,5.0,12/22/2016,Daniel the bartender is absolutely amazing!  A great asset to your company!  Not only great to the customers but wonderful to the serving staff!  First time at your restaurants and I will definitely be back to this location!!!!
Terri B.,"Denver, CO",358,342,289,5.0,1/29/2016,I just left the ModMarket place to stop off at the Cheesecake Factory to pick up an order for a retirement party at where I work. It is a large Godiva chocolate cheesecake that has chocolate mousse in the middle. They have a lot of wonderful dinner plates at the Cheesecake Factory. The first time I was there I had corn fritters and blackened catfish while my friend had a medium rare ribeye steak. This location in Littleton is fairly new and is welcomed around here.
Daniel W.,"Little Elm, TX",19,15,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Was not really busy, we were told 5 minute wait , which was longer.. no biggie.  Sat down and waited 15 minutes for no waitress to acknowledge us.  The family next to us stated they had already been waiting over an hour for their  food.  Clear indication to leave, so we did."
Michael F.,"Denver, CO",19,39,,4.0,5/20/2017,"Nice decor and plentiful good food. There's a very big menu and so a lot of variety of types of food. Portions are huge and the brown bread they serve to each table is delicious. They also have a patio and, obviously, great Cheesecake and Carrot Cake."
