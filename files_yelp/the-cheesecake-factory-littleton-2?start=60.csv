Tim B.,"Denver, CO",146,123,19,5.0,1/5/2016,"Happy to have a Cheesecake Factory on this side of town.  The extensive menu makes it a great place to go when no one can decide what type of food they want.  There are also some great ""skinny"" items for those who are watching their figure, so that they can binge on cheesecake later. Very nice decor, as all Cheesecake Factories have.  The lighting is a bit on the dark side, in my opinion, but not bad.  Staff are friendly and attentive.  Service is fairly fast.  This was my third attempt at dining here, as my previous 2 attempts failed due to the long waits on weekend nights (1+ hour).   We started with an appetizer - the Tex Mex Eggrolls. They were outstanding.  I got the barbecue ranch chicken salad and it was huge - definitely you could split this with 1-2 other people.  It was also delicious.  Topped the meal off with a slice of red velvet cheesecake, but couldn't eat the whole thing due to the bread and appetizers earlier. Overall, this location is at the same quality as you would expect from The Cheesecake Factory and it is a great option for those in this part of town."
Matt C.,"Littleton, CO",24,66,58,4.0,11/17/2015,Dropped in to check out the mall renovations and decided to eat here. Been to several cheese cake factories and this one doesn't disappoint. We had the kids at a table in the bar area. Tons of staff on hand. There was no wait and ended up ordering the avocado egg rolls for an app. Came out quickly and then the kids pizza was ready. We had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and finished with the Carmel salt cheese cake. We'll surely be back.
Stan P.,"Denver, CO",0,5,6,1.0,1/29/2016,"Would give no stars if I could. Manager tonight really needs more training and if this is how he acts with the clientele I can only wonder what he lets go on back of the house. You have to be able to fill requirements that older, disabled people have and definitely not turn around and tell them ""it was their fault"" that their wait was almost two hours  Unbelievable  I am sure good people work here but this person's behavior was atrocious and taints our entire experience!  I am leaving a good deal out of this review. If you eat here I hope everything goes well!"
Amy N.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",28,12,1,2.0,7/24/2016,2* only because the hostess were very rude and didn't even acknowledge our existence for about 2 min!! Mind you it's a Sunday evening and not busy at all!! We love this place and the food is off the wall. They definitely need to step it up with the greeters!!
EM G.,"Littleton, CO",2,113,1,3.0,8/23/2016,"We were there at 3 pm on a Tuesday, nearly the only people in the whole place.  Our party of 3 was seated in a corner booth which was kind of fun, more than enough room.  We were approached by a waitress who said she'd be sharing wait responsibilities with Ashley.  Our drink orders were taken quickly and delivered quickly.  Our order was then taken and the wait started.  Thankfully they brought bread because we were starving and the entrees took their usual CF sweet time to arrive. Gigantic entrees.  Husband ordered the BBQ Ranch salad, lunch size (still enough to feed the Duggar family).  I got the Chicken Bellagio.  Our son got the grilled cheese kid meal with fruit. When the food did arrive, they brought out my son's and my husband's, but not mine (weird) and didn't say anything to me about ""we'll be right back with yours.""  They just disappeared which was, again, weird.  It felt like a very long time before they came back with mine though it may've only been 2 or 3 minutes.  Still, weird.  The food was fantastic pretty much right across the board.  There was some gristle in my chicken and I wasn't 100% sure it was cooked all the way through but I'm still alive 5 hours later so it must have been ok.  The pesto sauce on the pasta, though, was soooooooo delicious.  It's almost impossible to find good pesto on the menu anymore anywhere. My husband couldn't finish his lunch-sized salad but loved it.  He brought home the little bit he had left. I'm dinging them pretty hard for being inattentive.  I had to flag down the waitress for a water refill and she never once came by to check drink fullness on her own.  My husband's soda was never refilled in spite of the three bucks they charged for it.  It seems like a lot of other people have made the same kinds of concerns known here on yelp, and so it is pretty inexcusable at this point that it's still happening.  Particularly when the restaurant is so sparsely populated. It's very expensive here, too, though the portions are so gargantuan you'll definitely be able to get a few meals out of it. Anyway I want to give Ashley snaps for being extremely friendly and accommodating when she was attending to us, just could've used more of it."
Jeff B.,"Aspen Park, CO",0,108,4,5.0,9/6/2016,"When I heard they were putting a Cheesecake factory in the Southwest Plaza Mall, I was over the moon. I've been to many of them across the nation and they are always (well, almost always) consistently good. I've been here 3 times now and I've had a great experience every time! I could get away with just having some of their incredible appetizers and a piece of one of their incredible cheesecakes. The service has always been good, the food excellent (you could spend half an hour just going through they extensive menu with incredible selections) and the atmosphere very pleasant. I love this place!"
Sean Z.,"Littleton, CO",15,75,,2.0,5/9/2016,"I'm not  big fan of the Cheesecake factory although we tend to find ourselves there periodically... The food is surprisingly good considering they offer everything from pizza to Mexican food and steaks & seafood which is why I gave more than one star. Always leery of these 8 page menus as there has to be some dishes that just don't sell as fast and likely aren't as fresh as the should be. I don't think they have a dish that could really knock your socks off, but they do well with what they have. Its not cheap; 13-$15 for a burger/sandwich is a bit nuts. Its the service that always irks me... As if they try to pass off poor, slow service as if it were really some sort of leisurely meal. To be sure a ""leisurely meal"" would include the drinks being refilled, attentive service with the waiter coming back to check to be sure your food was ""OK"" before you have had an hour so to consider it... Even worse when the waiter stops by in a half ass attempt to deliver service. Grabs one of 5 empty drink glasses and rushes off before anyone can ask for anything else. Then to take the cake he gets annoyed when he sets the refilled drink down and is immediately asked to refill the others before he can run off. Seriously this guy was either afraid of dining tables, allergic to table linens or he was running some sort of relay and was only required to touch the table and not do anything with it. Our waiter clearly did not want to be there. That or he was absolutely clueless when it comes to the 101 of waiting tables.  It got worse... dessert is at least part of the reason why many people go to the CHEESECAKE factory. Seems like if I worked at a CHEESECAKE factory offering people dessert would be a basic required function of my job. This was not part of the waiters plan though, he was ready to have us wrapped up, paid and out the door. Getting to order dessert was like pulling teeth. I know it was Mothers Day, I'm sure he had a long day and was tired of people and their Mothers making him work. These are not my problems, I am paying for it. Tipped $10 on $150 bill, which is about as close as I get to stiffing a server. I'm sure he expected more, and I had no problem looking him in the eye after I saw him pick it up and check the receipt. I have almost been fired a few times when I was waiting tables for questioning customers who left a crappy tip on what I know was good service. I am always prepared for the question when I leave a less than generous tip. Was kind of hoping he would ask me if there was a problem so I could explain the virtues of good service. I wont be back unless my mother in law makes me..."
Alexa B.,"Denver, CO",2,35,1,3.0,12/30/2015,"I forgot how awesome the cheesecake factory is... Picked up a Chris' Outrageous and it was pretty F'ing awesome. It's chillin in the freezer up to 6 months. Since I had been there circa 2005 they have a ""superfoods"" salads list as well as a ""skinnylicious"" list too. You can make anything on the menu without all the butter and fat!  Cheesecake factory rocks"
Allison C.,"Denver, CO",145,75,78,3.0,12/29/2015,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory chain, recently added on to the newly renovated Southwest Plaza. The decor inside is consistent with the rest of the chains--a mix of seemly random but ornate styles of furniture, lighting, and art. Service was prompt, food was good. Their dark brown bread is still the best part of the meal and something I wish I could make at home. Only real complaint is that it still has the new, plasticy smell permeating the restaurant. Not exactly something that whets the appetite."
Joshua U.,"Denver, CO",0,20,,1.0,11/28/2015,"55 minute wait drove us right back out the door. I'll never understand why I keep giving CCF second chances.  On top of that, there was a second line right at the door where they where hocking gift cards that was blocking the entrance, and my inevitable escape.  Also, the parking sucks."
Jeffrey J.,"Littleton, CO",170,5,,2.0,12/9/2016,"Great food here, lots of variety. Always a wait, busy place. That's good because the bar service absolutely sucks. My family and I put our name on the wait list which was 40 mins. Went to the bar for a drink while we waited. and the bartenders cared more about gossiping with the wait staff and washing glasses without even lifting their heads to acknowledge whoever was sitting at the bar."
Barb T.,"Denver, CO",0,2,,3.0,7/30/2017,"Let me first start by saying that I was very impressed that on noon on a Sunday Afternoon and ""National Cheesecake Day"" when you were crowded we were seated in 5 minutes.  My husband, son and I  came here for a belated birthday lunch for my birthday.  Both servers we had were wonderful, attentative  and we felt we should give a large tip because of the  wonderful service we received, the food and cheesecake were very good. However: when I came back from the restroom, I got mixed up and couldn't remember how to get back to the table, I had only been in the SW Plaza Cheesecake Factory to order cheesecake , not for a sit down lunch or dinner before, this was the first time since you opened a year and a half ago. Because it was so crowded it was easy to get turned around, I thought I had found the aisle where my table was and an employee in the kitchen instead of asking me if he could help me find my table, yelled at me that I couldn't be there because I was too  close to the kitchen. I am in my early 60s and work in a Customer Service position and was shocked at the rude behavior of this employee ( a dark haired young man in his early 20s).  Rude Employees are the reason that I stopped going to the Park Meadows Cheesecake Factory. There Is no excuse for the behavior of this employee."
Katie J.,"Littleton, CO",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2016,"This experience was disappointing. We ordered an appetizer, 30 minutes later the waitress comes to tell us they're out. Our food took 1 hour 39 minutes to come and when it finally came it was cold. The server was overwhelmed and offered no explanation for the issues and nothing to make it right. I wrote to Cheesecake Factory directly to allow them the opportunity to make this disappointing right, and they've never written back. Poor food. Poor customer service. And one ruined birthday dinner."
Amy W.,"Englewood, CO",0,13,4,2.0,1/12/2017,"Why in the name of all that is cheesecake does it take SO LONG to get food here?  I've been here three times.  At first I thought it was because they were new.  It only has gotten worse.  It's Cheesecake Factory.  The food is the same at all of them and it tastes pretty good.  They have lots of choices.  Everyone is nice.  But why is it sooooo slow?  Last night I ordered a beer, thinking I'd be drinking it with dinner.  Nope, it was gone before dinner came, and they had the nerve to ask me if I'd like another expensive beer while I wait SOME MORE for my food.  Plan on being there 1.5 hours, and that's when there isn't a wait for a table."
Lisa T.,"Golden, CO",14,14,2,4.0,12/21/2015,"Just went this past weekend and the food was great, and that cheesecake, well its what they are known for, right?  It was good too. The wait was over 90 minutes which for the Saturday night before Christmas- at the mall- well Ok, I can see that being a reason.  It would be great if they took dinner reservations, because their bar area is very small and there wasn't really a place to hang out while you wait, even if you did want a drink. I did see the patio area-but being winter time, well--I'll just have to try it again in the summer to see if that helps take some of the crowded area issues out the picture. But if you are looking for good food - this is a good place to eat.  I will be going back."
David C.,"Littleton, CO",141,3,,1.0,8/3/2016,"So, the food was great and the service was fine but, just be advised, if you are a large family, you cannot sit outside due to ""fire hazard"". They don't want to push more than one table together. My husband, four kids and I went on a long hike and our treat was to go to Cheesecake Factory (having lots of kids, going to such a place is a rare occurrence for lots of reasons) and sit on the patio. It was a BEAUTIFUL night. It was so sad to hear, ""I'm sorry. You can't sit outside unless you want to separate."" I have to admit, I get REALLY tired of being penalized for having a lot of kids. When did that start? Is this a new thing in our country? You have to squeeze your entire family into a booth because people don't want to push any tables together? And is that not a fire hazard INSIDE? My husband and I went out to take a look and we found this: Two tables in rows, each sitting four. In-between the two tables were fake shrubs that took up the ENTIRE space between the two tables. I wish I could add a photo because we took one. It was unbelievable. Why are rather large shrubs that are stuffed in that space (with zero wiggle room) NOT a fire hazard? If there is a fire, will fake shrubs not be in the way? Will the firefighter OUTSIDE be OK with that? Or will they have to actually move them? Is it better or worse to have shrubs between two tables than having them pushed together? Will the screaming people leaving the building due to a fire trip over the shrubs? I don't understand. But, I know that our family won't be going back to that Cheesecake Factory . . . . ever. Because only small parties are welcome to sit on the patio. Period."
Andi A.,"Denver, CO",0,22,4,1.0,10/14/2016,"Just no! Very mediocre food at a high price. What happened here? This place was packed when they first opened and the food and service was good. Now? Nobody there, the bread isn't offered unless one asks and then it's ""in the oven"". What showed up wasn't even warm much less ""fresh out of the oven"". It's a chain, ok, but the prices are about $10++ more per plate than a chain. We ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer, was decent but for $11.50 there should be more than 3 scrawny halves and some over garlicky mayo. Also ordered spicy cashew chicken, about half of the serving they offered when first opened and about a quarter of the cashews. Tasted ok but for $16.95, um no! Other order was for the sliders, 4 squishy buns with some onions and a dab of ketchup, tasted like a dirty grill. Sent those away and while the were removed from the bill by the manager on duty, he never stopped over to see what the problem might be even though we were sitting at the table by the waitress station he had to ""adjust"" the bill at.  I will assume he already knows? Got a slice of cheesecake to go and while it is probably the highlight of the meal, at $7.95 per slice it's good but slices were almost twice the size when they first opened. Sad!"
S.w. S.,"Denver, CO",10,4,,4.0,8/30/2016,"We visited The Cheesecake Factory in Park Meadows, CO, today for our anniversary lunch.   We arrived and expected a short wait to be seated.  We were given a buzzer to let us know when our table would be ready.  The guy behind the desk (host) wouldn't look us in the eye, as though he was WAY to busy to be bothered.  Not many people waiting to put their name on the list to be seated.  We waited outside thinking the buzzer would go off but after 15 minutes we headed inside to see what the hold up was, where we stood near the host desk another five minutes.  Then we stood next to the host desk to speak to someone to see when we would be seated.  The lady, who was taking the patrons to their tables, was nice and when she returned to the desk, asked how she could help us.  She asked the host if he had Shawn, party of 2, when he returned to the desk, seconds after she asked how she could help us.  He responded, to us, ""I called out for you about 5 minutes ago.""  AGAIN not acknowledging that we were standing right in front of him.  Our point is, we were provided a buzzer so why would we expect our name to be called, let alone, why wouldn't the host check out front of the doors by the patio, especially on a nice day like today when guests would choose to wait in the fresh open air.  He didn't even look at the lady hostess.    The Waitress was very nice and let us know what her favorites were out of the menu options which we were considering.  We talked to the manager and he was also very nice and attentive.  The manager made sure our food was expedited since we'd been waiting so long and offered us complimentary slice of cheesecake.  If it hadn't been for the excellent service from our waitress and the manager it would have been a bad experience.   We will go back, but probably to one of the other locations in our area.  Hopefully they have the host get some training on appropriate customer service.  Because all he had to do was say, I'm sorry you've been waiting so long, I can get you seated immediately.  Very rude.    The rest of the staff were top notch."
Vanessa L.,"Littleton, CO",7,27,2,1.0,12/20/2015,Clearly everyone that works here Hates their life! This location is horrible. Waited for over an hour for a table and finally just sat at the bar. Everyone from the hostess to the bartender were just straight up rude! Don't waste your time going here
Jordan C.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,2.0,5/15/2017,"So so confused by the ridiculously bad service at this place. Now seeing the other reviews, I realize we should have gone elsewhere, but who knew? Have been to a few other locations of TCF and had no problems. Went in during a very slow lunch shift, a nearly empty restaurant, and still the wait and the errors piled up. We received bread with no plates or silverware, then were delivered plates... but still no silverware... Eventually I just walked around and found clean silverware on another table. Our server hardly ever dropped by our table, food came out at way different times, parts of meals missing, and we never really got an explanation or apology, (or like, eye contact...) so we spoke to a manager- who seemed put out and like we were just looking for free food. Probably not a good indication that they are working on improving. Everything tasted fine, but we have a pretty low bar for acceptable service which didn't come close to being met."
