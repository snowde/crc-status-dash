Jake V.,"Littleton, CO",19,421,214,4.0,3/5/2016,"Ok, I compromised, 4 stars only because I love the cheesecake!  The cheesecakes alone is worth 5 stars. Some many variations of cheesecake, anything you can ask for. My favorite is the Adam's peanut butter!  As to the food, it's ok, not great, there are some good things like the sweet corn tamale cakes but that's a rare find in their over cluttered menu of options. Food overall 3 stars, average and typical."
Bridget W.,"Morrison, CO",17,35,10,2.0,12/13/2015,"The food was great as we've eaten at other locations. However, when my two year old dropped her straw on the ground I politely asked the waitress, Christiana, if she had a straw...she looked at me with straight face and said ""um, this isn't a dennys"". I was shocked as my Grandmother worked for Dennys most of her life. Very rude and disrespectful of her. Nice place but staff obviously needs better training"
Christian M.,"Littleton, CO",1,64,45,1.0,1/16/2016,"I don't mind paying for good food, but I learned my lesson and won't waste my money here again.  Prime Rib Dip was a big jip.   Cheesecake was good."
Victor B.,"Lodo, Denver, CO",22,208,9,3.0,12/15/2015,We opted to try the new Southwest Plaza location on this visit and I have to say I do enjoy the layout much more than the downtown location.  I had the chicken Bellagio on this visit and could not have been happier.  It was cooked very nicely but the portions are just so huge!  Great value in that for $17 you basically have two meals.  I had the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Of course I had cheesecake for dessert....this time opting for the Hershey's cheesecake.  The wait considering this restaurant is new to the area was not bad.  We were quoted 20 minutes and it was about spot on.  Give this location a shot if you're in the mood for The Cheesecake Factory trademark but don't want to drive down to Denver.
Nicole B.,"Denver, CO",0,2,,1.0,8/2/2016,"Not only did we wait for over 30 minutes to get our food, they were out of half he things on the menu. Including French fries. Half way through our meal a bus boy asked us if we wanted boxes, as if they were trying to kick us out. Asked to speak to a manager and was told she was sorry. Not even an ""anything we can do to make your visit better?"" Was very rude and just kept saying sorry. Will not return to this location"
Madelynn O.,"Littleton, CO",0,42,,1.0,8/17/2016,"I used to like cheesecake, but not this one. poorly managed and kitchen. forgot appetizer and waitress laughed and said she'd take it off bill (how nice we don't have to pay for food we never received). fries were cold. hamburger was soggy. gave lunch portion when we ordered dinner entree. again, server laughed off. won't be back here"
Dawn N.,"Littleton, CO",4,36,15,2.0,11/28/2015,"The ambiance here is nice just as all the other Cheese Cake Factories however, that's where it ends. We had a party of five and each one of us was completely disappointed in our meals. I have been to several other locations and this one was no where near the service or food that the others offer. The only thing that was the same was their passion tea which is always great. None of us will be returning to this location. So very disappointed!"
Jan D.,"Englewood, CO",17,3,,5.0,2/25/2016,My new favorite restaurant. We have now gone here about seven times and not one bad experience. Great staff great food
Holly J.,"Littleton, CO",275,76,4,3.0,12/13/2015,Food is not bad. Too large of a menu for me. Took forever and took even longer to get us a check and with an infant was very very frustrating. Not sure we will go back.
Matt S.,"Denver, CO",0,2,,1.0,7/2/2016,The staff for their dessert counter is MUCH too small during dinner time on Saturday for a place named for desserts. 20 minutes wait for two to-go desserts.
Adam S.,"Aurora, CO",23,11,1,5.0,1/26/2016,"First time going, it was amazing! Great service, large food portions, and the food was wonderful!  Look forward to the next time we go!!"
Taylor Kelly L.,"Parker, CO",0,54,5,2.0,6/2/2016,"Horrible dining experience. I personally love Cheesecake Factory and was excited there was a new location in Littleton but this place is terrible. The service is slow and none of the servers really know anything about the menu. Our server took 5 minutes to greet us, 15 to even get our appetizer and we waited another 45 minutes to get our food. The food was decent but our sever forgot a side of veggies for the entire meal and brought out something else when we were already done with our food. Wish we had a different server because maybe then our experience would've been better...or probably not by the looks of this place"
Savannah M.,"Littleton, CO",0,39,1,5.0,12/30/2015,"I am so impressed by the service at this Cheesecake Factory. My family and I have loved the Cheesecake Factory for years, and this one by far surpasses most of the ones we have been too. The hostesses are so fun and nice, while the servers are always fantastic. Even though it always seems to be crowded, it is definitely worth the wait (:"
Khristina D.,"Littleton, CO",96,121,219,4.0,12/23/2015,"Our waiter was Beau. He was great. I had the vegan cob   date had soup salad sandwich combo. Our meals were EXCELLENT. The beets were roasted perfectly and I would say this is the best salad I have ever had. There are two reasons this experience didn't get 5 stars: the calimari was marginal at best. I have never....ever...been served calimari with cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. That's just wrong in soooooo many ways. Its a major rooky move and it wasn't good. Beau did bring me marinara sauce, but that was marginal also. There was no flavor to it. The other ding was the fact that they had only one soup to choose from. Not everyone likes mushroom soup. A substitution was not offered. We willing be back, and we will ask to sit in Beau's section."
Cait L.,"Littleton, CO",16,113,36,5.0,1/28/2016,"I'm SO HAPPY they opened a location at Southwest Plaza. Park Meadows (not specifically Cheesecake Factory, the mall itself) is a nightmare, we needed one on the west side of town...now if they would only build one up north...say...Westminster?? I'd be set! My friend and I go to CF for our little Christmas get together each year. I love their huge menu, you can get virtually anything you are craving. This year we split the Chicken Madeira, which was absolutely to die for! We also always get the Tex Mex Eggrolls as an appetizer...that dipping sauce is like crack cocaine...pretty sure I could drink a gallon of it on my own. Anyway, of course you can never fail with the cheesecake. My personal favorites are the key lime, and the original with cherry preserves. For being so new, I felt that the staff was very well trained. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and fast. As with every Cheesecake Factory location, the wait is usually long, we arrived around 5:45 on a Thursday, and luckily beat the rush. Others were waiting for up to an hour. They are picky about their reservations, so your best bet would be to plan for an extra early dinner, or don't arrive until after 8pm if you don't want a long wait. It's always so worth it, either way."
Maria M.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Not good. 5 of us ordered different dishes, none were especially tasty and it took a really long time for our order to arrive. I suspect it was due to cooking pasta which was quite undercooked and bland."
Kelly C.,"Littleton, CO",0,4,,1.0,5/30/2016,"We were told different prices by the waitress and the manager regarding happy hour, The food wasn't up to the standard that we had at other locations, and the manager was a jerk. Won't go back - waste of money. Go to any other location but here!"
Mirella D.,"Denver, CO",15,3,,5.0,11/23/2015,"Went here with the family yesterday and the experience was great! We waited a bit on the food which I expected since it's a new location, but the wait was totally worth it for the food, the presentation  and taste where perfect ! The guys who where walking  around  supervising I'm guessing, where very nice I  like the fact that they took concern in the service and how we where doing. Keep up the good work we will definitely be back :)!"
Renee B.,"Littleton, CO",39,84,9,3.0,11/22/2015,"Food and service were fantastic, but the wait on getting food and dessert were very long.  We got seated right away and ordered right away, but were there for 2 hours, with a 5 and 7 year old with us, made it hard for this wait.  Might try again later down the road, after they get this figured out.  Food was great and cheesecake was delicious!  Would love to add this to our weekend restaurants in the future."
Brooke W.,"Lakewood, CO",0,2,2,1.0,5/14/2016,Last experience was horrible. Sat us in the worse seat of the house and once we asked to be seated elsewhere they completely ignored us and the waiter never acknowledged us. So we got up and left. We wanted a good experience and it was completely ruined.
