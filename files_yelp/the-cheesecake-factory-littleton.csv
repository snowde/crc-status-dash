MaryAnn C.,"Denver, CO",48,43,115,4.0,12/11/2017,"I feel like I should give 5 stars considering how frequently we come here. However, without fail, the wait is either really long or even if we do get seated right away (which I think has only happened once), the food takes a while to arrive.  Things I love: -Brown bread (complimentary) -Asian chicken lettuce wrap tacos -BBQ chicken pizza  -Fettuccine Alfredo -Ranch -Coffee that is surprisingly good -Wide variety of menu options (Italian, various Asian dishes, comfort food, etc.) -They pack up your food for you  -Pay through the Cheesecake Factory app New things I've noticed: -They bring butter in a dish with the bread now instead of butter packets that are cold and hard to cut through  -Ranch is much less generous portions"
Aaron F.,"Aurora, CO",0,2,5,2.0,12/30/2017,"Ordered soup of the day which was pretty good.  Appetizer was okay Ordered fish and chips thinking that it would be crispy and flaky fish, but it was very soggy. Did not even go through one chip. Had to return it back to the kitchen. Server was great. She took the fish and chips off the menu. I'll maybe try ordering something different when I have 40 minutes to wait"
Jenna S.,"Parker, CO",58,54,85,4.0,11/26/2017,"Brunch? Yes, I just discovered The Cheesecake Factory serves brunch. Their menu is so big that I guess I just bypassed it before. The brunch menu is small but has the necessities. Most items range from $9-$15, typical brunch prices for the area.  I ended up ordering the Mexican lettuce wraps which I've never had before. I've had the Asian ones but decided to try the Mexican version. They weren't bad, they could've used more seasoning. The lettuce wrap had chicken, salsa, avocado and stringy radish. I definitely wanted more flavor out of them but it hit the spot. My fiancé had the chilaquiles from the brunch menu. It was really good and lots of flavor, I enjoyed his. We finished the meal with a cup of coffee. Their coffee is very strong so I added more cream and sugar than I wanted to. The coffee was very hot and very fresh. Don't forget the endless bread and butter, yum!!! I definitely want to try more items from the brunch menu since I newly discovered it. Their cinnamon rolls looked delicious too. I was surprised we didn't have to wait for a table on a Sunday morning and our service was fast and efficient. All of the staff was very friendly and attentive."
Dana B.,"Gilbert, AZ",410,745,614,4.0,11/28/2017,"The food, as always, was delicious! It was a busy day so service was slow but the waitress came back regularly to fill our drinks. The food was served warm and tasted great.  I substituted broccoli instead of pasta on my chicken piccata and it was delish! My friend loved her salad too. The only unfortunate part was the crowded bathrooms that could have used some servicing. Other than that - it was a Nice stop!"
Kathy W.,"Aurora, CO",0,14,1,3.0,1/7/2018,"We recently rediscovered the CF after being fans in Las Vegas.  This is our go to spot for our family of five when everyone wants something different. We have consistently had very good food here.  Yes,the wait can be long (1.5)hours for us this weekend.   The service has always been good as well with the exception of this last visit.  We had a gentleman waiter who was inattentive, cold and came off a bit snobby.  When you pay $25 per person average and have to wait such a long time the guest experience should be excellent.  Drinks should be full-bread replenished and empty plates taken immediately. Guests shouldn't have to hunt down the waiter who was conspicuously absent-often. Will we go back? Yes. Will we make sure we don't get him again.... you bet we will."
David C. M.,"Parker, CO",0,20,1,1.0,10/21/2017,"They are incapable of estimating wait time.  We were told 50 minutes; we're at 100 minutes and counting.  We're committed tonight but never again. Finally seated:  it's 80F,  the bench seats have NO padding, and there's a huge rip. Later:  And, it keeps getting worse:  I've had much better food (catfish) at Cracker Barrel for a fraction of the cost. On the way out, my friend slipped on the greasy floor."
Hailley G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",184,92,47,2.0,11/21/2017,"We showed up on a weekend just after lunch. The service was ridiculously slow and then the food wasn't that great, likely because it was overcrowded. In general I love Cheesecake Factories so this was disappointing. My advice is to maybe avoid it when it's too busy."
Clara E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",11,42,7,5.0,8/30/2017,"This  was my first dining experience at The Cheesecake Factory. We live in the Springs, and we need a Cheesecake Factory like last year. :)) We put our names on  the list and waited about 15 minutes. We were seated and greeted by a smiling, bubbly Mikaela. We ordered our drinks, and got our drinks and bread in a jiffy. We ordered the lunch portion chicken piccata and the carne asada steak medallions. Both dishes were cooked just right, and was so delicious. We had to get the Cheesecake so we ordered the  white chocolate caramel macadamia nut, and the fresh banana cream cheesecake with hut fudge. OMG- did we enjoy scrumptious cheesecakes! Great service, great food, and great Cheesecake."
Annette K.,"Lone Tree, CO",94,104,89,5.0,11/12/2017,"I alway have a great experience when I go to the Cheesecake Factory at the Park Meadows mall. The service is great and the food is always consistently yummy, I recommend the Chicken Madeira which is a great twist on a chicken in Marsala-Iike wine sauce, mushrooms, with red bliss mashed potatoes and asparagus. The cheesecakes are obviously always amazing! I love the classic strawberry, dulce de leche, oreo, or banana cheesecakes!"
Andrew W.,"Englewood, CO",88,39,17,4.0,8/4/2017,"If you haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory, it's got the ambiance of a finer dining restaurant but definitely made more accessible (in price, location, etc.) I'll go through some of the highlights.  It's a cozy, dim lit restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating (however the outdoor seating is very exposed to all the traffic coming in from the mall parking lot). It would be cute for a date (I think I went to a Cheesecake Factory before prom?) and could be appropriate for a more business-y lunch. They've got free bread!  As far as entrees go, their potions are big! I almost always go home with left overs.  Of course, the cheesecake is good, but far too often do they drop my go-to Cheesecake (the latest disappearance being the White Chocolate Blueberry Swirl). So if you've been missing what may be considered a seasonal flavor cheesecake, don't take it for granted!  If you're bringing kids, you'll find a cheesecake they like too. They have more rich, chocolatey flavors like snickers, reece's, carrot cake etc and some more subtle ones as well, like tiramisu...or just straight up original, no surprises Cheesecake. Like I previously mentioned, they are in a mall AND they just very popular, so expect a good amount of traffic. Take that into account when making dinner plans!"
Nancy R.,"Parker, CO",407,169,575,2.0,7/11/2017,"Good cheesecake but, the service is horrible. I have come in here for something sweet many times and the cashier either forgets, or their system sucks for to-go.  10 minutes, 20 minutes then 30 minutes to place cheesecake in a container? We had a gift card and had to use it!"
Joanna A.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,,5.0,12/19/2017,Always very good food!  I love love love the bang bang shrimp!!!  Wait staff is always friendly and attentive.   Highly recommend
Anna D.,"Denver, CO",38,151,673,4.0,10/17/2016,"Cheesecake Factory has always been our Go-To when it comes to Family Birthday Celebrations.  A big factor is how quickly food comes out and of course this is a big deal when you have 3 young kiddos.  We've eaten at this location at least 2 times now, and the staff is always great... and the food is on point. Being a regular at other Cheesecake Factory locations (and out of state)... we know when to beat the crowds (basically don't go in the Evenings or during prime time Eat Times!) so going early in the morning when breakfast starts, after the lunch hour, or before dinner starts have been good times for us (and rightfully so, because a hungry child is not a good thing!) The kids love the kids menu... and we always get our calamari fix for an appetizer. My hubby loves the Chicken Bellagio... (which he likes to call the Man Salad... because you get Protein with noodles and a delicious salad). And of course you can't go wrong with the Cheesecake for dessert!  We will continue to go to this location.... and are happy with the staff and the food here!"
Audrey H.,"Littleton, CO",24,71,7,4.0,5/21/2017,I really don't know how anyone can complain about this restaurant. My husband and I eat there a couple times a month. The food is consistently good and the service is never lacking. This location is always clean and usually there's a wait but that's because it's one of the more reasonably priced restaurants in the area. Another perk is that the food is upscale but it's also child friendly.
Angelique F.,"Elizabeth, CO",93,236,318,5.0,5/18/2017,"Honestly awesome night!! Rachael L out bartender was awesome and attentive!!  Shepherds pie was amazing, and the chicken via something was phenomenal.  To top it off tried some new margaritas tonight which were great!! Worth every penny and 10xs what we spend at other locations we walk away disappointed.   Only downfall was we parked near Dicks and had to walk outside in cold bitter winds to car instead of thru the mall as we entered.   Thats a negative on the mall not Cheesecake."
Alice Q.,"Denver, CO",2578,1627,6800,1.0,10/24/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has some of the most ill-mannered and impolite front staff. Nobody that greets, unfriendly faces, 0 smiles, 0 boundaries. This is also related to other locations. I don't honestly know what's going on. It's almost like dating a pretty girl who wears a lot of makeup and then she invites you with her mad makeup skills, but her personality is crap. This is how I feel about this restaurant. Pretty on the outside, and much to be desired on the inside."
Rowena B.,"Centennial, CO",79,501,1131,1.0,8/14/2016,"New review: I'm so fed up with this place. I'm totally boycotting. We've been here twice sine my original review and my opinion doesn't change except for the service. The last two waitresses we've had were frustrating to say the least. Today we didn't even stay for cheesecake because I was just so over the place. I just wanted to leave. I despise how they don't put any cocktail prices on the menu. Today I asked how much a mojito was at it was something ridiculous like $15+ and she didn't know, she had to go ask. I asked another question about the menu and she was about to go ask again before I stopped her and just changed my order. She also forgot to bring our bread and when we asked for it she looked at us like we were aliens, then it hit her and suddenly all of her tables had bread... I go out to lunch for a good time not to be annoyed.  Original review:  We've been here twice. I hate the menu, it's too big, too much to choose from and then they're there within minutes trying to take your order - haven't even got to the 3rd page yet!!  The food is good and the cheesecake amazing but overall it's pretty expensive. Yesterday we had just cheesecake and coffee/tea and it was over $25. The previous time it was dinner and drinks and it was well over $100.  The service isn't bad, staff always friendly but I don't like having to ask for cutlery, that should be pretty standard and I felt like the wait for pulling cheesecake out of a fridge was a bit too long, we were almost finished our drinks by the time they came."
Travis F.,"Aurora, CO",79,108,141,3.0,8/26/2017,"A very unremarkable visit to the Cheesecake Factory chain. It was Friday so we expected a wait, and it was only 20 mins. having missed the main rush. We ordered the sphagetti, jambalaya and sliders. The meals took about 40 mins to come out. The jambalaya was delicious, spaghetti was average, and the sliders below average (White Castle is even better and not as pricey).  I actually took some of the jambalaya veggies to give the sliders some taste. Ended the evening with some red velvet cheesecake, which was delicious."
Chan L.,"Englewood, CO",0,49,,2.0,1/1/2018,"Slow service, waitress would go to all of her tables except ours.  Food was salty.  Not worth it.  There are a million other restaurants in the area.  Don't waste your money."
Marissa B.,"Aurora, CO",0,4,1,5.0,11/27/2017,We had Kevin as our server tonight. He took excellent care of us and as an indecisive person he helped me order a delicious entree followed by the Mango Key Lime cheesecake and Hazelnut cheesecake. Both were awesome. Thank you for the great experience Kevin.
Nathan B.,"Santa Fe, NM",101,21,13,1.0,7/26/2017,"Had the unfortunate occasion to eat at this restaurant with my family. Let's just say it was the worst experience we have ever had at a Cheesecake factory.  Server was a total space cadet, manager was dismissive and condescending along with a bunch of goofballs workin at the host counter.  Furthermore I thought the floor was wet in the place but I'm thinking now it was just a thin layer of grease everywhere making it feel slippery like it hasn't been mopped since it was erected.  My order was wrong twice, the second time it wasn't even cooked. My daughters meal was wrong as well. We have been to Cheesecake Factory all over the place from DC to California and this is the worst one ever. If you can avoid this place like the plague.  Oh and their cheesecake was warm too, how does The Cheesecake Factory mess up cheesecake! Drive on Yelpers!"
Kiki A.,"Atlanta, GA",20,8,5,2.0,10/24/2017,"How disappointing!  I was expecting spectacular and it stopped way short of it!  I met a couple of other girlfriends for dinner and when the hostess greeted me (kinda)... she looked at me --no smile, no warmth, no welcome--and rather rudely asked...""How many?""  Then when I told her I was meeting another party there and gave the name- she looked to her right, pointed and said ""They're straight down a few tables over.""  Wow, if you're too lazy to walk the customer to meet their party like the host or hostess should do-then you shouldn't be working as a hostess:). The server was mediocre at best... No eye contact, just dry and impersonal.  There must've been something going around--From the hostess, to the waiter, and it spread to our dinners -because by the time dinner arrived -it was dry and mediocre as well!  I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and it tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all night - it was very dry and probably the worst Eggplant Parmesan I've ever had!  My girlfriends weren't all that pleased with their dinners either, but I honestly didn't taste them so I can only speak for my own. ***In response to guest services-thank you for acknowledging my less than satisfactory experience!  If it's useful information, it was a Tuesday night, October 17th @ around 7:30 PM... hopefully you will see this since there's no way to reply to your response."
Michael H.,"Littleton, CO",0,9,1,2.0,11/22/2017,"This place takes no reservations and then has a 50 min wait.  The ladies at the front desk are rude and talked for 6 mins before even acknowledging me standing at the desk. It's been an hour and my drink is empty,  my meal isn't here.  I have seen the waitress twice.  So far this place is a total joke.  I will update after the meal.   Ohh and i had to ask for bread also."
Jeff P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",71,46,11,2.0,6/25/2017,"TL;DR overpriced, understaffed, really slow. Early Sunday (4:00 pm) dinner. Seated right away and wait staff was prompt, but after that services were very a joke...it took 20+ minutes for 3 pasta dishes and a burger. We had to flag down staff and ask for each drink refill, we were ""empty"" most of the meal. The ""mildly spicy"" peppers in the pasta were so hot she couldn't finish the dish. We came because we wanted dinner and then the famous cheesecake. The meal and services was disappointing enough that after the main course we just paid and left, and got cheesecake to go at the walk up counter. And we *STILL* had to wait almost 10 minutes while the counter staff messed around with the point-of-sale system. Really poor experience for what was decent but too-much food and substandard services. Receipt had a gratuity suggestion list that went up to 22%...Hah."
C G.,"Boulder, CO",0,5,,3.0,7/13/2017,"Got to say, this is an average place. Our server Krista was amazing, but the food here was totally average. And when you're getting standard food and the plates cost $20 bucks a pop, why really bother? The drinks are the trick here - you ought to realize something is sketchy when there aren't prices next to the drinks on the menu. Every cocktail on there is between 11-15$. Sure, they tasted fine, but for gods sake, what a waste of money! The prices here aren't worth the average food and drink in my opinion. It's a fine place to eat and drink though if you want to spend the money. 2.5 stars - totally average."
Nan H.,"Littleton, CO",12,16,,1.0,10/17/2017,"I  believe that one bad person in the staff can ruin the restaurant. I have never had problem with the service at other places before. When we went in, the place was busy. The hostess was in a foul mood and was angrily responding to us. I am hoping that she isn't racist although I noticed that everyone was seated but us, Asian and the other family who are indian. When I asked why we didn't get seated, she brushed off and said we are next.  If I am the owner of the restaurant, I will prob fire her for sure. She needs to understand that we, clients, contribute to her salary. We left the premises and ate at the nearby restaurant."
Valerie R.,"Aurora, CO",68,46,37,4.0,9/13/2017,"We got a couple cheesecakes to go! We got the new birthday cheesecake and we were expecting it to be too sweet but it was light, fluffy and delicious. We also got the original cheesecake and it was perfect as usual. We also decided to try the mango key lime cheesecake and that was my favorite. Out the three cheesecakes we got I definitely would get the mango key lime over every other one!!"
Principal O.,"Fort Myers, FL",1,62,24,5.0,10/24/2017,"If you can work your way thru the humongous menu, I've yet to have a bad appetizer, entree or (yup) dessert! The avocado egg rolls with tamarind sauce was delish. The daily special, Chicken Riesling (boneless breast in a light creamy sauce with garlic and mushrooms), was excellent over angel hair."
Fox M.,"Denver, CO",1,35,1,1.0,10/23/2017,"Truly dreadful food tonight. We had a large group and almost everyone was disappointed with the food. The service was good as usual but the food has gone downhill over the last year. Sooooo not worth the premium price. Many of us had french fries with our meals and they were all cold and hard/chewy like they had been sitting somewhere for a bit. The serving sizes appear to have gone down. Child's meal came about ten minutes after 12 other meals arrived. Just not good and I can't imagine coming back for anything except cheesecake. Used to be good food but not so great anymore. And Mr. Manager that responded, if you view our review on Zomato, you'll see that this isn't the first time we've had almost the same mediocre experience."
Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,63,4.0,8/25/2017,"Good food and service and awesome cheesecake in a state that is not known for great food.   I mean it's just a fact... it's hard to find good food in Colorado (?).   Food in Colorado is overpriced and underwhelming for the most part.  When I'm driven to a ""chain"" restaurant, a lot has been said.   But, this is about The Cheesecake Factory and they do a good job.  Have eaten at this location a few times and never had a bad meal.  This particular trip included Chicken Madeira, which I would highly recommend, and Spaghetti and Meatballs.  The spaghetti was lacking in sauce, but they were more than glad to bring me more.   The meatballs were very good with a mixture of ground beef and sausage; moist and flavorful.  Cocktails were also well-prepared and generous for the price.  And, of course..... the cheesecake!  You can never go wrong there, other than the calories and carbs, but why go to TCF if you're not having the cheesecake!?  LOL.  Other perks..... this location is in an upscale mall with easy on/off access to I-25 and direct entry and parking to the restaurant.  They also have a lovely outdoor, covered seating area to enjoy.   Just head for Dillard's and you'll see TCF around the corner to the southeast.  Enjoy."
Patricia J.,"Aurora, CO",1,10,1,3.0,4/19/2017,"Excellent service & Cheesecake. But !  I called for reservations & was told it had to be over 5 ppl. Our party of 4 waited for over an hour. Not good plus the food is way to expensive. Will only go back for Cheesecake. Thank you for responding to this post. Good customer service to try & resolve issues. We may try again, love the cheesecake !"
Monica L.,"Littleton, CO",227,850,,5.0,4/27/2017,"The new breakfast burrito (served all the time) is probably the best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  It's a bit of a gourmet version, and the ranchero sauce is extraordinary.  For what it is, The Cheesecake Factory does a good job!"
Sherrie N.,"Denver, CO",4,61,6,1.0,9/13/2017,"Horrible! Here is the really condensed version of my time at CCF.  I went to lunch with a friend, we both ordered salads, which we returned them 'THREE' times because they could not get them right...Our super quick lunch turned into an hour and a half and ended up boxing them to go, in which they STILL did not get one of them right.  The manager snickered through our explanation of our dissatisfaction and, I guess in her mind, tried to remedy the situation, but fell extremely short in doing so.  I am not sure if it is the management selection or they just don't give a crap about customers anymore...I can't say my time was pleasant or the food was enjoyed.  (I ended up throwing my salad away at home as it was not worth eating a wilted salad that just wasn't made to my satisfaction per their menu).  Save yourself the trouble and go to PF Changs next door :)"
Matt F.,"Littleton, CO",24,106,175,4.0,5/6/2017,We came here for dinner and got sat pretty quickly. Our server was wonderful very attentive to our every need. Food was good cheese cake was wonderful. I like the atmosphere only downside is it can be pricy.
Kaelan D.,"Centennial, CO",0,5,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"I wish I could get buffalo blasts other places. I came here today and sat and waited 15 minutes for a table, which I understand (even though I was told it would be a matter of minutes). We order as soon as we sit, and an hour later our food is still not here. All we ordered was buffalo blasts and a caesar salad. This place is a joke."
Holly P.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,91,5,4.0,4/10/2017,"One of my go to's. Went in for dinner on a Monday and was pretty impressed with the extremely short wait time. Never been seated that quickly at any cheesecake factory, ever. Was sad to see garlic noodles off the menu but we had another pasta and it was great. Our server was awesome!"
Laura R.,"Cheswick, PA",42,114,56,1.0,8/8/2017,"By far the worst experience at a CCF :( Food came out cold and tasted terrible. The pasta davinci is my favorite dish and it was pretty much inedible. We were starving after a very long trip from Co Springs to DIA and heading back to Co Springs. We never seen our waitress again to even get the chance to complain so we just sucked it up and ate what we could. With the super long wait for our table, then incredibly long wait for our food, it was such a terrible experience:("
Sara E.,"Castle Rock, CO",9,88,26,4.0,2/24/2016,"My mouth waters when I think of The Cheesecake Factory.  I love LOVE their food.  We share a meal as their portions are HUGE and with the bread and drinks...even while sharing there is usually any room to spare for the CHEESECAKE (which really shouldn't be missed).   OK--their wait time is OBNOXIOUS.  I mean really...no reservations?  90 minute waits?  That is ridiculousness.  At least do call ahead seating.  For the upscale situation they are presenting, they really should be more accommodating in this way.  More than once...more than SEVERAL TIMES we've left because of the lame wait.   However, if you get lucky enough to get seated, enjoy the food and savor the savory dishes they offer.   My Favorite Meal:   Appetizer: Crab Cakes or Boston House Salad or Avocado Egg Rolls (to die for)  Entree:  Chicken Bellagio or Chicken Madiera Dessert:  Lemoncello Cream Torte or Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake EAT UP!"
Heather P.,"Denver, CO",5,162,96,3.0,4/5/2017,Definitely a chain restaurant feel here.  There was a wait at lunchtime but we were able to grab an open table in the bar so we didn't have to wait.  Service was good and I like that they have a low calorie menu.  The Mexican lettuce wrap tacos came with three and were good enough.  This isn't a place I will likely frequent because there are so many other above average restaurants around here.
Nancy M.,"Littleton, CO",97,3,,1.0,9/29/2017,I would give it no stars if it was possible. Wait time was extremely long for two people however I understand it's a Friday night. Ordered our food and it took almost 40 minutes to get to the table. When it arrived I got completely the wrong dish . The food runner then proceeded to tell me if I send it back it would take another 15-20 Minutes I said I am not willing to wait see what you can do to fix it . The manager brings it out and its still not correct . And when the bill came they charged me for the incorrect item I told them I can't even believe your now going to charge me for the wrong item . The waitress Amanda did not even apologize nor did the manager and did not even acknowledge they screwed it up. I will never go back to this establishment ever. Worse customer service I have ever experienced .
