Ayleen M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,4,,4.0,3/16/2016,One of my favorite places ever since I went the first time. Love to have lunch there and of course I can never skip the dessert. I have taken friends and family members and they love it just as much as I do! Can't wait for the next visit.
Justin B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,12,4,5.0,5/20/2015,The service was excellent and our server Amy was extremely attentive to our family and paid close attention to our 14 month old as to make sure she had her needs met (bringing out 2 things of snack break at no extra charge)...and that's never happened before. To that I appreciate. I absolutely recommend this location!
Sarah S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",93,144,31,3.0,6/6/2013,"The food is great. Prices however are insane. Just me and my husband spent $60.00 on lunch. We got a delicious appetizer, a meal and once piece of cheesecake. Its good food, just the prices are far too high."
Krista S.,"Denver, CO",51,5,,5.0,10/18/2014,"Can't go wrong with the cheesecake factory ever! But today I feel our server and the manager went above and beyond.  Once we had finished our lunch we had asked that they box up the rest of our food which they were very happy to do, some how in the kitchen though our leftovers had gotten dropped so they informed us that they were having our entire meals remade,  including our appetizer and that they would have them all boxed and ready to take home shortly! So fantastic to know they truly care about their customers. I would have never expected them to replace our leftovers but they did it without even asking and to me that means the world!"
Tiffany M.,"San Francisco, CA",68,280,24,2.0,9/15/2014,"This location was pretty disappointing. There were 5 of us ladies and it took the restaurant 45 minutes just to bring our food out. The waitress, young blonde, was very attentive and sweet. I just wish the management was more apologetic."
Leah Y.,"McKinney, TX",17,7,,5.0,3/9/2015,"Never a bad meal here! We arrived late Saturday night after spending over $150 on the worst meal of our lives (The Broker-Denver).  We were starving.  We were quoted a 40 minute wait time and that was just fine for us.  The hostess is fantastic.  I believe her name is Elise.  She knew we had just had a bad dinner and made sure to put us in a really nice, private booth.  Our drinks came fast and were great.  We ordered several appetizers and some salads (crab/artichoke dip, fried mozzarella, endive salad, fried zucchini, kale salad) Everything was done to perfection. Our server Evan was on top of it.  A drank never sat empty, brought us tons of bread (and butter of course), and was attentive but not annoying.  Excellent service.  We will be back again Sunday for brunch.  They turned a terrible night into a terrific night! I just love this place."
Denise M.,"Denver, CO",0,1,,1.0,10/20/2015,"On Sunday October 18th I spoke to a manager at the Cheesecake Factory by the name of Paul at 12:00 noon. I explained to Paul that I would like to make a reservation for a large party of 18, at which time Paul informed me that they do not take reservations. However he did tell me if I was there at 5:00 pm that my wait time would only be 15 minutes. I arrived at 4:59 walked up and asked to speak with Paul.  Paul was at the hostes station I told him that I had spoke to him about a large party of 18 he looked up to see me and a few of my family member that were with me.  At that point Paul informend me that my wait would now be an hour and a half. Paul proceed to tell me I misunderstood our conversation.   I did not misunderstand our conversation Paul saw a larger group of Hispanic Americans and refused to treat us with respect.   I have never played the race card but in this case it was very clear to me that Paul is a huge RACIST.  What upset me even more was that a party of 15 white americans came in and were sitted while Paul and I were having a heated discussion.  If you are Hispanic, Mexican, Spanish or however you like to refer to yourself as in the Latin community I WOULD HAVE TO ASK THAT YOU NOT EAT AT THE PARKMEADOWS CHEESCAKE FACTORY."
Matthew M.,"Castle Rock, CO",100,113,5,4.0,1/1/2015,"Went with my wife for new years eve. Staff was VERY friendly and accommodating. Wait time was well within our promised time. The tag team of waiters attended to our every need. They seemed to have updated their menu and we were impressed. My wife loved her fish tacos and the burger with macaroni on it was delicious. And of course, as always, the cheesecake was on point. Great meal, great staff, great menu."
Cecille A.,"Littleton, CO",1,12,2,2.0,2/18/2014,"Everyone loves the cheesecake factory but if you are hungry and have to wait over an hour to get a table and then another 20-30 minutes for your food anything will taste good. Bored with the restaurants around the house we decided to go for a ""nice dinner"" since I hadn't been here in a while I decided that sounded good.  We arrive to a line of 10+ parties waiting to put their name in, okay no big deal. Wait time is 65-90 minutes, decided to wait since we were already there. They were out of pagers so we had to come back 40 minutes later and get one.  Finally get seated and we are ready to order because we had plenty of time to look over the menu during our wait. Server comes takes our drink orders and runs off, tried to tell we were ready but he didn't hear. He comes back 10 minutes later for our orders. Food arrives, looks pretty good but pasta on the Chicken Marsala is dry and the sauce on the chicken is greasy. The Chicken Medeira sauce is greasy but at least the mashed potatoes were good. The restaurant is cramped you are practically sitting in the lap of the table next to you. Definitely NOT worth the wait"
Cass D.,"Englewood, CO",140,921,257,2.0,6/18/2014,"Every time I come here I remember why I never come here. To start the decor makes absolutely no sense, the layout of the seating follows suit and the cherry on the sundae is the menu that's all over the place. It's like whoever came up with the concept for this place has schizophrenia. The food is less than stellar and the dessert name sake is bland; I can make a better cheesecake with minimal effort at home. I really don't understand what the draw is for people here, even the prices are ridiculous. Next time invited to this place I hope to remember well enough this last experience so as to not make the same mistake again. On the plus side, I didn't get violently ill and the service wasn't terrible."
Ronna F.,"Westminster, CO",128,58,8,5.0,5/24/2014,I've loved this place since I lived in Cali.  Service is always great. Portions are two meals easily.  Love chicken mediora :) White chocolate macadamia nut with Carmel cheese cake is the best!
Kevin S.,"Lone Tree, CO",64,39,4,1.0,12/11/2014,This place has gone down hill over the last couple months. A couple months ago I ordered the pork chop which was severly over done. When I complained they apologized and took it away saying there was a new cook in the kitchen just learning. The manager came over a few minutes later and apologized and told me it was an off night. I then got my bill which included the pork chop which I took three bites of. Not even a hint of comping it or asking if I wanted something else instead. Last night I got the chicken Picata. The sauce was cold and thick. The chicken was over done and barely warm. The angle hair pasta was cold and in one big clump which I had to pry apart. Not sure what happened but this place is no longer an option.
Cara K.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,17,5,5.0,11/10/2013,"We had a great time here! The service was exceptional, our server was really on top of everything. She had a lot of silly 'service jokes' that she probably says at every table , but she showed a lot of personality.  We ordered the ahi salad. It was pretty good. I have had better seared ahi before, but for a Cheesecake Factory, I was impressed.  Of course the cheesecake was amazing too. Definitely have to get some of that when you come here!  They are open until 11pm which was really nice since we happened to be out later and were worried about finding a restaurant that was open.   We had a great time and I would come back in a heartbeat! Thanks!"
Anica M.,"Brighton, CO",21,19,,2.0,8/9/2014,"The food was amazing. The servers were so nice. My problem is the reservation system and wait time. We tried to call ahead to make a reservation since there were seven in our party. Reservations would not be taken. Once we were at the restaurant, we were told it would be a ninety minutes wait since we were a party of seven. The party of five that checked in behind us had a wait of thirty minutes. I am sure this is not the way you are supposed to treat a large party, ordering drinks, desserts, meals, etc. Go to the restaurant in Denver instead- they will allow reservations and treat large parties the same as small groups. It saddens me to say we will not be going back to this restaurant again."
Samantha E.,"University Heights, OH",174,894,271,3.0,10/8/2012,"Holy portion size batman! Any reference to Cheesecake Factory makes me think of The Big Bang Theory, and I've been to the downtown location for, obviously, cheesecake, but I'd never had a full meal here before.  A girls night to Park Meadows on a quest for sweaters led us to dinner at Cheesecake Factory, where the wait was ""only"" fifty minutes.  It would be nice if they'd let you call ahead. Once we were seated our server was friendly, although a little hard to catch at times.  In her defense it was homecoming night, and they were ridiculously swamped. Their menu is ridiculously huge-- it's like reading a book.  At any rate, we had: --crispy chicken costoletta: my friend had this and loved it.  She said the chicken was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were delicious. --chicken bellagio:  actually, I think this is the same crispy chicken cutlets as the costoletta, but over spinach pasta with a light cream sauce, topped with arugula and prosciutto.  I really liked it, plus the serving was big enough for one dinner and two small lunches to pack to work. --avocado egg rolls: I'm not entirely sure how I feel about warm avocado, but these were interesting.  My friend loves them. --fresh strawberry cheesecake: my friend had this and loved it.  It's a classic. --Reese's peanut butter cheesecake: delicious, but waaaaay too rich. --white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake: I brought this home to my husband, who finished it in one sitting with yum noises, so I'm guessing it was good. --kahlua cocoa cheesecake: my friend bought this home to her husband-- I guess it's her favorite. Other tidbits: the wine list is decent, and has some reasonably priced glasses.  No reservations and no calling ahead.  Seating at the high-tops in the bar is first come first serve, but not at the regular tables in the bar. The verdict? Go not on a Saturday night.  Order a more normal cheesecake.  And splitting an entree would still yield plenty of food."
Brittney E.,"Parker, CO",1,58,23,1.0,8/5/2014,"Shame on you Cheesecake Factory!!! We were a party of 10 who went to Park Meadows for a 16th b-day outing. We went into the Cheesecake Factory and were told 30-45min for our large party, no problem. 45min later we went to the front to check on our status and was told another 30min... Ok  we though this is all my sister asked for her 16th. 30min later we still weren't buzzed so yet again went up to the desk and were told they were cleaning our tables and would be a few so we summoned everyone in our party to stop shopping and get to the factory... Well 20min later still no buzz. We approached the front desk yet again and the girl turned around to who I think was a manager and said talk to these people. We were than advised it would be yet again another 45min (Based on their track record the past few time quotes I doubt that would have actually happened)!! So not wanting my baby sisters day to be ruined my husband, kids, and I told them it would only be a table for 5 and we left back to our hotel so they could be sat right away and stop starving to death. My family missed out on my sisters 16th birthday lunch turned into early dinner & dessert... I will never forget that! I will never return ever again. Being told its Sunday and people are eating slow is no excuse for wasting our ENTIRE afternoon. If our party of 10 was a issue you should have let us make a reservation as we attempted to do when we called before arriving. Can't believe we booked a hotel specifically near this place to not even eat there!"
Yakov T.,"Aurora, CO",4,11,5,2.0,9/30/2013,"Steak, and filet in particular, is pretty simple. Brown it on both sides and serve it to me rare, that's it. The meat was good, but the fact that it was salted and peppered into oblivion is another matter."
Chris A.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",0,35,1,4.0,1/5/2015,"I eat here every few months, it's always good. The staff seems really busy, so they aren't on top of everything. So an empty glass is common. The food is always consistent, and very tasty. The cheesecake is amazing, I've tried about half of them."
Cris F.,"Englewood, CO",0,433,,4.0,8/13/2013,A classic restaurant to go to that has something for everyone and everyone loves the cheesecake. There is a reason why they named it Cheesecake FACTORY!!!  if you come on a Friday or Saturday night then be sure to get there early cause there will be a line and a list.  Average meal will cost about $15.00 bucks without cheesecake.
Lilliana M.,"Denver, CO",102,20,5,3.0,7/20/2014,"Spent 120 on food for 3 adults and 2 kids. The bread was hard and old, not fresh. Ordered wings... They ran out, so we ordered buffalo strips..... They ran out if sauce. Ordered farro salad.... Surprise they ran out of farro! So we ordered the kale salad they ran out of almonds and apples! Got slightly aggravated and the waitress says,"" it's Sunday don't ever come in on Sundays, we always run out of stuff."" Thankfully they had cheesecake! Yum that always saves the day! Service was good but was irritated they ran out of everything we wanted. We will not go to this location again. 16th street I hope your  food stock is better or it's goodbye Cheesecake Factory forever!"
