Sue O.,"Englewood, CO",0,3,,4.0,5/28/2017,Love this restaurant we go there often - Great service and great food.  Only downside - I know and appreciate their staff can be happy but a few employees walk around whistling ALL the time - its distracting and annoying especially when they are standing at your table doing it!
J P.,"Grand Junction, CO",0,36,1,2.0,5/28/2017,"There's no doubt that the food is pretty good. It is ridiculously fatty and high calorie, all of it. It is also expensive. And noisy. And they are not terribly fast."
Stuart H.,"Denver, CO",12,22,,2.0,4/23/2017,"The only reason that I have them a 2 star rating  is because they are normally not his bad. We waited while being seated at our table for 20 minutes before anyone even said hello to us.  Once someone did, they seemed annoyed when we handed back to them the dirty bread dish and even debated us over whether the dish was dirty. My order, eggs, was very over cooked, while my wife was served a completely wrong dish from what she ordered.  At this point, we just wanted to leave especially since the person waiting on us seemed to never loose that annoyed tone. Even though the person waiting on us acknowledged that we were not receiving proper service, we were asked to pay for the drinks (a coke and a coffee) that we never finished.  We informed the manager on duty whose response seemed less that surprised, then had our meal at Brio. Maybe the person waiting on us was having a bad day. I do not know. Maybe the also need a new cook. Again, I do not know. I just know that going out to eat is a luxury, and these things matter."
Ann C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",15,30,4,2.0,9/10/2016,If you like to spend money in a place with bad service ... This Cheesecake Factory is the place for you! After being told it would be a 20 min wait it turned into and hour wait ...bc they forgot to put us in the system ... 20 mins after being seated our server Jesse still hadn't brought us straws for our drinks or bread despite having walked past us 3 separate times to bring bread to table JUST BEING SEATED.  I give this place two stars because the manager Mike was quick about listening to us ...let him know how displeased we were before we just walked away from the table and left. I'm sure the food is just as good at any other cheesecake but the service leaves quite a bit to be desired. There are 4 other comparably priced restaurants within a few steps ... Just walk to one of those and enjoy a much better experience
Anne E.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,6,1,1.0,5/17/2017,"So disappointed!  Expensive, average service, long wait, harried service and foreign object in food!   Manager not impressive.  Not going here again!"
Rene S.,"Irvine, CA",0,11,,5.0,3/29/2017,"Had a nice dinner here tonight. Wonderful customer service start to finish. We came in to celebrate my son's birthday, and our server was great. She made great recommendations, checked in often enough to keep us happy, but not interrupt our experience or be too disingenuous. I'm glad we came by for the special occasion, it's exactly what we've come to expect from Cheesecake Factory - consistent food, drinks and ambience."
Steven S H C.,"Denver, CO",745,646,1874,4.0,1/7/2014,"Wow, no matter what the season is, they are always packed.   Got nice outdoor seating area that's heated.  This guy's got the menu down perfectly.  Their portion is huge so prepare to share with others."
Kelsie H.,"Castle Rock, CO",52,184,104,4.0,1/3/2015,"Just had lunch here!  The wait was short, however after our pager lit up it was a additional 5 minute wait. No exaggeration.  The place was packed! If I hadn't had a gift card for this place I would have turned around and bolted.  All the tables for two were RIGHT next to each other. We all might as well been at a community table together. I was tempted to try everyone's cheesecakes since they were in fork distance!! We each had the bbq burger, rare. Yum!!!! I recommend. I had salad with mine and hubby had French fries. The salad dressing was good! I would had been satisfied with a big one of those only.  I asked waiter if they had a salted caramel cheesecake (I hate menus, too many choices), sadly they didn't have one.  I looked at the menu and the fourth one down was a S'mores cheesecake. Score!! No need to look further, this was the one. And it was heavenly!  I'd return, but during off busy hours!"
Debbie B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",35,201,45,3.0,2/12/2016,"Came here on my birthday and the service was slow even though it wasn't that busy. Came again today and the service was fine, but the chicken salad sandwich wasn't so I sent it back. Got the bbq chicken salad which was just okay. Overall, this chain used to be one of my faves but lately or at this location it's subpar."
Savannah M.,"Littleton, CO",0,39,1,5.0,7/17/2016,"Me and my boyfriend came here today and we had the most amazing server EVER. She is so personable, attentive, and friendly. Ask for Nicole when you come in, because she will make sure you have a 5 star experience! Definitely will be coming back  oh, and the food is good too!"
Vickilyn F.,"Fort Collins, CO",28,6,,3.0,4/23/2017,It was okay but not great. Out of mashed potatoes (they did offer alternatives but i wanted my damn mashed taters!) Glass was cracked and had a slow irritating leak. Bread was fresh and good as was the rest of the food... minus the mashed potatoes.
Emma C.,"Denver, CO",30,135,21,3.0,10/16/2015,"As someone who doesn't exactly love cheesecake, I can't say I was thrilled going into it. Unfortunately we were there on a Friday evening, so it was almost an hour wait, but the staff was friendly and polite and we perused the mall while we waited for our table. We sat outside next to the fireplace, which was lovely. The menu is HUGE. I don't think I've ever seen such a ridiculously sized menu, and that's not even the cheesecake part of it. The portions were also huge, but considering the food is more on the pricey side, I suppose you're getting what you pay for. Our server was incredibly nice and checked in on us often, though he did forget to give me my leftovers in a box when I asked. Overall, a meh experience at a meh restaurant."
Todd H.,"Thornton, CO",0,9,1,1.0,9/18/2016,We have been coming here for years  and have always enjoyed a good meal and great service.  The last time we came the food was fair at best. The service was good. Today we had an even worse  experience  the food was cold improperly prepared and not taste at all. The manager came to the table and had the worst attitude I have ever seen in any restaurant. Not only did he not apologize. He treated us like we were stupid. The only good thing about the entire experience was the servers were wonderful. Bottom line I will never be back and I will make sure everyone I know knows about this experience.
N M.,"Aurora, CO",0,26,,2.0,4/15/2017,Aside from giving enormous portions of food (which is why they are always so busy) why are they busy? Food is  mass produced by big corporate chains! We ordered cheesecake to-go & it was frozen when we got home. Nothing ruins a meal like walking through clouds of smokers standing at the entrance...glad we didnt sit on the patio.
Brian C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,11,8,1.0,9/10/2016,"Poor customer service at this location. I'm sure the food is probably as good here as it is at every location...,but the service here strives to set the bar as low as possible and then digs under that. I won't get into the gritty details, but if l am going to spend my money I expect a level of courtesy.  Lucky for me, and this location I won't be back."
Kate G.,"Lakewood, CO",29,118,42,3.0,10/3/2015,This place really needs to invest in some sort of noise reducing. Food is good as always but I really hate coming here because of the noise factor. I'm not a fan at yelling at the people at my table when we are seated right next to each other. Bleh!
Sharon O.,"San Diego, CA",46,35,58,1.0,8/15/2015,"Have you ever tried to have a conversation with a wall? Yeah, neither have I, but I think I know what that feels like after eating here. Our server was incredibly slow & needed several reminders to bring our requested drinks & even the straws. When she was taking my mom's order, she kept shouting ""WHAT?"" & claimed that she was hard of hearing in one ear... Which is fine, but in that case, she should have known better than to not double check our orders. I ordered the Vegan Cobb salad. It took a long time for the food to come out, so when it finally did I dug in hungrily. A few bites later, I tasted... cheese. Clearly, this salad was not vegan. When I let the server know the mistake, she responded with an impressive amount of sass, ""I only heard 'Cobb,' honey."" When I finally got my vegan salad, it came drenched with dressing (I had requested dressing on the side to avoid this). By then, my party was almost done with their food, so I just sucked it up and ate it. Not very happily, mind you. As if that wasn't enough... When we were paying the bill, another waiter helped us. He brought back the change and said, ""I didn't bring the 17 cents; I'm just going to tack it on as tip."" Uh...  Is that even ALLOWED? Sure we'll gladly tip an extra 17 cents, but it's about the principle here, people! My friend, out of the wonderful kindness in his heart still left a generous tip. I am still giving the place 1 star, because 1) It's not an option to give zero. And 2) the food itself was actually pretty good. I would recommend the vegan Cobb salad if you're about that life. The buffalo chicken strips & crab artichoke dip were also good. Would NOT recommend the hibachi steak. I tasted my sister's, and I swear they marinated that thing in a tub of salt for half a decade. She drank a gallon of water after her meal. Would definitely have had a better experience here if we got better service. Or if our server had better hearing."
Irene M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",89,174,576,4.0,1/9/2016,"I've been here multiple times and I'm always greeted with a warm smile and have an excellent service. The food is great, but the reasons why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 stars are: 1. waiting time (My family and I had to wait one hour); 2. there is no price for the drink menu which is really shady because I get surprised by the bill every time. I guess I can wait while shopping but having to wait every time sucks. My favorites from this place are: avocado roll with sweet dipping sauce, Da Vinci Pasta, Steak Diane, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp (although the shrimp portion is TINY)."
Valentina R.,"Pueblo, CO",0,52,12,5.0,9/29/2016,"I spent my 16th, 18th, and 22nd birthday there! The food is great, the portions are wonderful and the Mac n cheese fried balls are to seriously die for. I craved them my entire pregnancy and after having my daughter 3 months ago I am still obsessed. The apple crumple cheesecake is so damn good and the chicken Parmesan is great. Great prices as well! My husband spend $90 for 5 adults, that to us is absolutely cheap."
Thomas D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,10,,5.0,3/28/2017,Fried Calimari was best ever had. Chicken parmesean sandwich  (thanks Peyton Manning!) was delicious and Anton was an excellent server. We're looking forward to leftovers and our cheesecake selections for dessert.  Outstanding!
