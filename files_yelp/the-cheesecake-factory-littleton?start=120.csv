Trevor C.,"Phoenix, AZ",436,24,473,4.0,1/25/2015,"Went here for a nice and somewhat quick dinner. The wait when we arrived seemed long but it was only around 10-15 min before we were seated. Waitress was professional and took care of us throughout the meal. Ordered Avocado Egg Rolls as an appetizer, the sauce pairing is to die for. Fiancé ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps while I got Baja Chicken Tacos. The food was good but nothing special.  We used to like it more before they changed the menu and got rid of some items and changed recipes for others. The Tex Mex Egg Rolls used to be my favorite item on the menu but they changed the recipe and got rid of the avocado cream sauce that previously came with the dish. ***If looking to eat healthy check out the skinnylicious menu, the food is quite delicious and the portions are still generous***"
Lea M.,"Denver, CO",58,4,1,5.0,9/24/2016,"I went with my family during a busy lunch rush. We were sat quickly, and service was great. The extensive menu was well priced, and they have an entire menu devoted to lower calorie, healthier options. The cheesecake and desert collection is exquisitely decadent. They are almost too pretty to eat...almost. We really enjoyed the birthday lunch we were celebrating. I'll be back."
Taylor S.,"Denver, CO",219,1,,1.0,3/18/2017,"VERY disappointed. Used to come here all the time for celebrations and tonight we came for my sister's birthday. We waited for a table for an hour and a half (they would take reservations for 7, but not for 6). There was no toilet paper in 3 of the 5 stalls in the women's bathroom and no paper towels. Not one, but 2 of our orders were made incorrectly after waiting another 30 mins for them. Already disappointed with the service and the experience, we went to order cheesecake at the front, thinking it would be faster. We stood for 20 minutes staring at our cheesecake ready and packed up the entire time. After saying that I believed our desserts were sitting ready to go, I got a snotty response from a lady working behind the counter, ""yeah, probably."" Absolutely not the way one should respond to an already annoyed and mistreated customer. Oh, and they forgot to bring by anything for my sister's birthday. Absolutely not coming back."
Crystal I.,"Lone Tree, CO",11,31,9,4.0,1/12/2016,"It's a chain. It does what it does exceptionally well, but there is nothing life-changing or earth-shattering here. Just very good chain food very well prepared served by top notch chain servers. If we were comparing them to other chains, I'd give them a 5, but yelpers aren't here looking for chain food. That said, after reading some of the reviews here we hesitated to visit at all. We are new to the area and crave their cheesecake on occasion. We were moving during my son's 20th birthday last month and a little celebration was overdue, so we went. I can't speak to the experiences of others, I can only say I've eaten at multiple locations in two handfuls of states, and it's probably one of the top two I've been to. The service was impeccable on our visit, and the food was just as delicious as always.  I think the only ""blooper"" was the very sweet young hostess telling myself and my son to ""have a nice day, ladies!"" as we were leaving. In all fairness, he has long, wavy blond hair and his back was towards her, and she didn't get to stop for two seconds the whole time we were there. But being Lone Tree, some might be offended rather than amused as we were. Let's hope I'm wrong, but I've lived in similar places and watched blowhards demand someone be fired for less, so I hope you'll forgive my cynicism. Our server was absolutely wonderful, I enjoyed the meal, we took some home some cheesecake. It was a nice afternoon, and gratefully appreciated after a long December spent schlepping boxes.  I expect that any negative reviews represent outliers, this is one of the better run locations (and Cheesecake Factory is already one of the better chains in terms of reliability and excellent service). If you aren't up for a wait or want to be sure you don't run to any issues, visit on their slower times and you'll get abundant attention and speedier seating and service. Otherwise, just go with the flow, it's still worth it, even during the busy times. Also, cheesecake."
Karissa M.,"Boulder, CO",17,30,61,4.0,5/9/2015,"Parking at this mall is insane. Drove around for 10 minutes and finally parked in a spot that was so squished because of the two ridiculous parkers that ruined the middle spot... thats why we were able to park in this spot. Otherwise we would be driving for another 10 minutes! Showed up at the Cheesecake Factory at 1:10pm on a Saturday with a group of 4. We were told the wait is 1 hour. The quotes time was perfect. We got our seats around 2:15pm. The hostess said they are always like this on Saturdays. I will try to avoid this place on weekends!  The food was as expected. Delicious. They do a great job even with such an immense menu. I was happy to see the GF symbol for gluten free options.  We got teas, coffee, club soda for beverages. We go the Chicken Samoa for our appetizer. For lunch we had bacon bacon burgers, kale and quinoa salad and the asain salad. For dessert we got raspberry white chocolate cheesecake, Godiva cheesecake and turtle cheesecake. EVERYTHING was so good! Our server was fun and attentative.  She was wonderful! We even stayed a little longer after our meal because we were having such a nice time and she didn't rush us out. Overall, parking is terrible. The wait time is long, especially during busy meal times and weekends. The food is great. The menu is huge - something for everyone. Service was top notch."
John C.,"Parker, CO",0,42,25,2.0,8/9/2016,"Hmm, where do I start? Monday afternoon @ 1:00pm and the place is absolutely packed! The hostess tells us its 15 min wait. Honestly, I'm a little ticked because why in the world is there a wait @ 1:00pm on Monday. We get our table and I already feel like things are off. We're having to wait on water and bread. You know it's getting bad when I have to tell my wife and kid that the next server they see tell them to bring more bread. Anyway, 20-25 min later and our food finally arrives. The food was good but the service is just simply lacking. I simply don't get it about this place. I mean $17 to $19 a head for lackluster service and wait time. I figure I can choose a half dozen other restaurants with walking distance that have no wait and better service for that price. It's just sad that restaurants are not the way the used to be. You can tell its kinda a downer. Nobody seems like they enjoy their job and theres a feeling of frustration in the air. Simply stated, I feel as though the elegance has been taken out of CC Factory......"
Eugene M.,"Aurora, CO",5,23,1,2.0,7/11/2016,The California omelette was bland and cold. The cheese/onion mix inside the omelette was cold slimy/runny and had a very bad aftertaste. I couldn't get rid of the aftertaste for hours. Disgusting. The breakfast potatoes were super hot (temperature) but also very hard as if they weren't cooked thoroughly. That happens when they're cooked too fast. The hot tea was lukewarm. This is my first time at this location. Not impressed at all. 2 stars instead of 1 because the waitress and other staff were very nice and welcoming.
Melissa R.,"Denver, CO",0,16,2,1.0,1/22/2017,"I eat here once a year as a family member likes to celebrate their birthday here. I have never been a fan of this place.  Terrible service here, mediocre overpriced food; today was no exception."
Jarold S.,"Denver, CO",15,1,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Terrible place to go to eat. My wife left a review on our way out of this place (I can't in good conscience call it a restaurant). Our server was switched to another station so we got a new one right when our meals came out. My $27.95 steak dinner was cold. Steak, potatoes, and green beans were all cold. Like ice box cold. Didn't eat it. After taking a taste of the ice cold steak, I had lost my appetite. Put my napkin over the meal and waited. Finally the new server came over, took my plate and said ""let me get this out of your way"" at which time I lifted the napkin and told her it arrived cold. She took it away and soon after a manager showed up asking if I wanted it remade. I told him no I just wanted to leave. He offered us some cheesecake which we declined. If my dinner was cold, the cheesecake might show up hot. He took off the price of my dinner from the check. I left no tip and wrote on the receipt ""You are lucky I paid for what I did"". I will never, ever return."
Julie D.,"Parker, CO",91,21,,3.0,8/18/2016,"The massive menu means there is something for everyone. Happy hour is a great deal because they have food and drinks. Good times. I also appreciate that there is a separate, plentiful Skinnylicious menu.  It makes picking something lower in calories a lot easier at CF than most places.  Please know that for almost $5 the side salad is a pile of mixed greens, 2 cucumbers, and 2 slices of tomatoes.  Finally, and I know I'm not the only one peeved by this:  the cheesecake slices are significantly smaller than they used to be. Forget about sharing! This whole slice is for me :p   Solid restaurant, good service, pricey, LONG wait time in most cases for dinner, they slack on the cheesecake size.  Three stars!"
Dave R.,"Littleton, CO",45,290,10,4.0,10/12/2015,"Always a solid stuffed experience.....and the food is always good....My foreign visitors are always blown away by the portion sizes in America, and this certainly takes portion sizes to new heights!!"
B.k. S.,"Englewood, CO",0,18,10,5.0,2/5/2016,"Excellent service, food, decoration..... Totally happy with them. Definitely recommend to everybody go there . You won't be disappointed."
Marie W.,"Aurora, CO",21,29,29,2.0,10/27/2014,"Service here absolutely sucks. Let me be clear - I love the Cheesecake Factory. I have loved it for many years since the first time I tasted the Orange Chicken. It was the first place I have ever had cheesecake. This location has really started to go down hill in terms of service.  I ordered tea (hot tea) from our waitress, Monica L, and didn't get it until I asked for it - three times. The third time I asked a different waitress who brought me iced tea in or minute from my request (one minute) - she tried and I greatly appreciated her quick response to my request. So why did it take my waitress so long? Was it because she was bringing martinis to the people next to us who asked twice? Was it because she kept disappearing for extended periods of time?  I received my tea give minutes after I got my food. Unacceptable. I have had it with the slow service and bad waitresses it is ALWAYS HIT OR MISS. Never consistent - service should be consistent. Go to the Boulder or Downtown location. Cheesecake Factory management - do something about this location before they ruin your reputation. Your food isn't good enough for bad service.  No one pays to be ignored and treated badly. NO ONE!! You get two stars because the Cuban sandwich was outstanding...."
Nicole H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",71,107,31,4.0,5/29/2015,I have yet to have a bad experience here! The food is always delicious and the service is very fast and friendly also. The reason I only give it four stars though is that some of the two top tables are placed way to close to each other though. Many times the table gets to cluttered with all your drinks and food and then your sitting really close to the person next to you so sometimes it's very awkward. Other then that this is a great restaurant that has a variety of choices of food!
Angela A.,"Centennial, CO",0,55,,5.0,6/4/2016,Love this place but can be pretty inconsistent. Once the bang bang chicken dish tasted off so sent it back. The manager came out and personally thanked me as they were forgetting an ingredient! That was pretty cool! She made it right and will always go back because of it!
Christina O.,"Durango, CO",0,9,2,5.0,7/19/2016,"My all time favorite place to eat when I go to the city! The carbonara is my favorite! Always have to finish it off with a piece of cheesecake to take home! The portions are enough for 3 meals, it's great. Nothing like shopping and then relaxing with some great food!"
Vicki H.,"Peyton, CO",0,4,,5.0,1/14/2017,"This was our first visit the the Cheesecake Factory.  We went late on a weeknight and were seated immediately.  Our male server was excellent.  He made us feel very comfortable, offered suggestions and was always available.  My husband ordered the filet mignon and said it was the best he'd ever had.  I had the herb salmon and it was also delicious.  Loved the salted caramel cheesecake but my husband didn't care for the ""turtle"" cheesecake (too chocolatey) not enough caramel and nuts.  Our overall experience was great.  Highly recommend this restaurant to others."
Joseph M.,"Littleton, CO",0,9,,3.0,6/14/2015,"Pretty much everything you would expect. Long waits (tables, orders, etc) made up for with monumental servings. Prices are good, but that wait kills two stars. Service at this location is, once again, par for the course. Nothing mind-blowing, nor offensive. Frankly, unless your goal is to have leftovers, i would suggest another restruant in the Park Meadows mall area. Cajun Grill, anyone?"
Crys A.,"Denton, TX",519,614,23,3.0,2/26/2014,"The food is decent and the portions are absolutely insanely big. I can only imagine someone traveling here from Asia and eating at The Cheesecake Factory for dinner. They would be horrified.  The menu is too long and too detailed so as to cause brain numbness and ultimate full-system shut down. In the end you kind of just point and grunt and hope for the best.  This location is like so many of the rest: decent, just ok."
Brick H.,"Denver, CO",123,95,24,3.0,8/6/2014,"My first Cheesecake Factory experience wasn't bad, but failed to blow me out of the water.  The atmosphere was nice, but very crowded and LOUD. We only waited about 5 minutes for a table inside (they also offer outside seating) and our service was friendly and as quick as expected for how busy it was.  I ordered a Caribbean Cooler to drink and the spicy crispy chicken sandwich. I have to be honest, the drink was bland. I'm not into super sugary things but this thing could have used a sweeten up. It was reminiscent of sipping slushy coconut water. The spicy crispy chicken was very dark - borderline burnt. It was edible, but I've had a better sandwich from Wendy's.  On the up side, we shared fried zucchini for an appetizer and it was fantastic! The zucchini was fresh and flavored to perfection. My counterpart got the steak Diane, which I snuck a bite of, and it was excellent. I might be back...maybe a different location."
