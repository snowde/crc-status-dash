Barton A.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,12,4,4.0,11/12/2016,The food is always delicious! And there are so many cheesecakes to chose from. However When we ate there today the tall black haired host was very rude to us. And we watched as she was very rude and unhelpful to other guests as well. Not good for the first impression of such a nice restaurant.
Katie H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,69,10,5.0,4/18/2016,"Beautiful, clean , and friendly restaurant to visit. The menu is quite extensive, so be prepared to read! I chose a lunch that had half a sandwich, salad, and a bowl of soup. I could not finish it it was quite a meal. So I suggest if you want cheesecake split that meal with somebody else. As for the cheesecakes so many choices, let me say that again so many choices, we took cheesecake home so we could enjoy them later."
Sonja A.,"Aurora, CO",126,272,598,4.0,5/14/2015,"Portions are HUGE, so if you can, order lunch size portions or from the Skinnylicious menu.  The latter has meals under 600 calories (perfect for that after dinner dessert).  This place is always busy so plan on at least a 20min wait.  Regardless, the service is top notch.  It is a great place to catch up with friends and have conversation without fighting with musak to be heard.   Not a fan of cheesecake so I go for the Lemoncello cake.  It totally rocks!"
Robin M.,"Denver, CO",260,283,1,4.0,12/2/2013,"I had heard the food was mediocre so I wasn't really in a hurry to visit. However, an out-of-town friend wanted the Cheesecake Factory before our jaunt to Ikea, so away we went. Each of us four ordered something different for lunch, and we all were pleased with our selections. (Good thing it was lunch - a dinner bill would have been horrendous.) I'd read about the avocado eggrolls, so we tried that as an appetizer. The dipping sauce added a very appealing zip; everyone liked the eggrolls and loved them with the sauce.  My friend's eggs Benedict were exactly to her taste. The pasta dish and salmon both were pleasing. My pit beef sandwich was delicious, as were the accompanying fries. Everyone had cheesecake for dessert, of course. While I usually prefer to stick to the plainer cheesecakes, I really enjoyed the Red Velvet version.  All in all, a very satisfactory lunch. The wait to be seated was ridiculous, however. We had a buzzer, but other people were getting in ahead of us just by standing at the hostess's stand. We had to push a bit to get seated, and we did complain about the lack of organization in having two different seating systems in use at the same time. The waitress's attentiveness and excellent service got us into a better mood, fortunately!"
Dave C.,"Denver, CO",27,235,588,1.0,11/8/2013,"We waited 45 minutes for our food while our ""Server"" was on her lunch break.  Her ""replacement"" kept our drinks filled but obviously there was no communication because even after she came back from her break we sat there waiting... And waiting... When we finally had to ""ask"" about our food i.e. ""remind"" her we had been waiting, our food was brought to us COLD.   And we had been STARVING.   Thanks for making us WASTE an hour of our time and skipping lunch on empty stomachs.  I am LIVID! I will NEVER go back!"
Randy J.,"Littleton, CO",20,294,45,3.0,4/16/2015,"We went here for a 16th birthday celebration this past Saturday.  The food was pretty good, but I thought overpriced for the quality that we got.  The waitress forgot one of our drinks several times, but I think they were understaffed and she was running wild trying to keep up, so I blame management not her.  The bartender was very friendly and was able to keep up, but the place was packed in which I just believe management should have known this would happen, so they should have been prepared.  For the price, I think that you could find a better place and would recommend them for a lunch special or something, but not a dinner if it were me."
Jane J.,"Littleton, CO",0,20,,2.0,5/15/2016,We have been going to this location very often over the past five years. Usually it is pretty good but today was awful. Our server could have cared less. We ordered our drinks and waited and waited. Finally the drinks came out and the waitress eagerly told us she would bring the bread. We waited and waited. 25 min later a different waitress put the bread down as someone else put down our entrees. The food was cold. I just wanted to get out of there. We don't go out much and it just made me grumpy and sad. The hostess was nice.
Mike W.,"Aurora, CO",1,16,5,3.0,12/21/2014,"A good place to eat and what seems to be a professional staff. Nice abiance but a smaller place as it's in Park Meadows mall. The hostess told us there was a 20 minute wait... turned out to be more like 45. I understand that its a popular place, but everyone before and after us was also told 20 minutes as well and there were plenty of grumbles in the queue. It would be nice to be told a slightly more accurate time. A popular place should have a more accurate feel for time. Took a bit of time, about 8 minutes to see our waiter. We ordered drinks. Very good. We ordered an appetizer. Fried cheese... only to be told they were out. Sigh. Had the potato tots. Pretty good. Had the Chicken ballagio and a chicken Ceasar salad. All good. Waiter then offered us a cheesecake menu and mentioned the scrumptious peppermint bark cheesecake. Ordered the chocolate mouse and the bark... you guessed it... out of the bark. By the way, I wrote this all, and edited it... after we ordered our single slice of cheesecake (to go) and it still hasn't arrived. A good place to visit, just not sure we'll come back to this one. Perhaps we'll try after the holidays since it seems they may not be able to hendle the rush, but maybe not."
Nikki B.,"Irving, TX",0,8,,2.0,7/16/2016,"I keep wanting to like the Cheesecake Factory again but just can't. Today's experience - sitting outside on the lovely patio - soaking in the fumes and noise of a diesel delivery truck making deliveries to the restaurant for over 30 minutes. And the waiter apparently gave me the ""wrong"" butter, so after dropping it at my table, she proceeded to take it back and switch it with another.  Really? Zero attention to the customer experience."
Jackie T.,"Yuma, AZ",21,158,14,5.0,2/22/2016,"Yes, it's loud and always crowded, but it's a great go-to restaurant with a great menu selection.  And I've never had bad food or device at any Cheesecake Factory I've been too."
Jen T.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,10,,4.0,3/25/2016,One of my favorite place. The services is always good no matter what time you go. The price isn't bad either. I think it's funny that people complaint about how expensive it is.
Etana D.,"Littleton, CO",1,30,32,5.0,6/2/2015,Christen did a wonderful job of waiting on our table. The good came out on time. The starter soup was delicious. I recommend this location highly.
Aggie S.,"Castle Rock, CO",1,14,,1.0,11/7/2015,"One of the longest meals ever! We were there for 1.5 hours and during that time a table of 5 beside us were sat after us and got their food before us. Our server went on break so our service was awful, the fill in didn't get the order correct and everything was a mess. A chicken avocado salad was ordered and there were zero avocados on there and when asked about it, they brought out like 3 slivers. Then it took almost 30 minutes to get the ticket straightened out and the gal To take our money. During which time I found a manager and expressed my frustration, especially because we had 4 kids with us. He assured me he would take care of it and yet nothing happened, and no discounts were given. To top it off we went to celebrate a birthday and the server forgot and we got tired of waiting to celebrate so we left without celebrating the entire reason for going. We will not be going back anytime soon."
Monalisa M.,"Miami, FL",212,334,95,5.0,6/24/2013,"ALWAYS tasty. ALWAYS impressive. ALWAYS a good time. ALWAYS great ambiance. Even though it's so cliche, it's still ALWAYS LIKE WHOA ;) - Pretzel Crusted Chicken - Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake"
Leila M.,"Denver, CO",37,31,8,1.0,1/2/2016,Downtown location is so much better!! Came here for lunch waited 20 minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad but it took over an hour to receive our entrees and the waitress didn't even box our food even though everyone else's was boxed. Food wasn't good since I was over being hungry! Daughters spaghetti was good but overall would not recommend
Joseph C.,"Denver, CO",37,273,184,4.0,11/18/2014,"I've eaten at other Cheesecake Factory locations before, but a few nights ago I was very satisfied with my time at this location last night during dinner. The customer service here that evening was excellent! The hostess was very pleasant and friendly. And our waiter was attentive without being overbearing and able to hold a conversation while doing his job with ease. For appetizers we had Southern Fried Chicken Sliders. Yummy! Portions were great and the food was delicious! We had the Chicken and Biscuits and the Shepherd's Pie. I will definitely return to this location again!"
Ashlee B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2016,"Upon arriving for lunch, we were given a pager and told a 20 minute wait. We waited 40 minutes before the pager went off. My husband handed the pager to the hostess and told us to wait off you the side. We waited another 20 minutes while watching party after party be taken back. My husband finally went up to the podium and told the guy what was happening. He said ""sorry about that"" and we were the next party called. After ordering immediately, we waited another 40 minutes to receive our food. We will not be coming back."
Oscar A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,36,,5.0,3/8/2016,"One of my favorite chain restaurants to frequently eat at. The food is always consistently delicious. They're nice and promptly seat you all the time. I'm always amazed as to how good everything on their menu is, even with the huge selection. Not many places can pull that off. My to go to dish is the Cajun Jambalaya pasta, sooooo good. No complaints here."
Jess B.,"Littleton, CO",15,21,8,1.0,10/10/2015,"While our server was animated, he was awkward.  Our food took FOREVER and we only ordered sandwiches and salads.  The cheesecake was gross.  Overall, two thumbs down.  Would not dine  here again.  Disappointing."
Madi P.,"Centennial, CO",2,12,6,3.0,6/24/2015,"We went for happy hour, and the prices were great. It wasn't very crowded either, so the service was fast. The food was underwhelming though. We ordered fresh guacamole, and it was completely bland. There was absolutely no flavor. The avocado rolls were the same way. Generally, their food is good. I would recommend their sandwiches in a heart beat. Based on my experience, dinner options are better cooked than happy hour options."
