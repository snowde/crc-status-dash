S T.,"Littleton, CO",0,22,2,1.0,4/1/2016,"If I could rate no stars, I would.  We were seated by the kitchen on a Thursday for lunch.  Not busy at 11:30a so no reason why?  We could hear the wait staff joking around making inappropriate comments and pool language.  The nachos were great, but we SPECIFICALLY asked for a well done burger and what came out but a rare one.  My chopped salad made me so sick I had to drive to the nearby 7-11 for pesto.  My fork was dirty and the waiter commented, ""Well, I guess there was extra flavor left..ha ha.""  Seriously??  Not again for $50.  What poor food, service, and cleanliness.  Headed to  TripAdvisor for some comments as well..."
Josh M.,"Denver, CO",124,136,3,1.0,9/4/2014,"I've been here several times over the past couple of years for various occassions ranging from just dinners to birthdays. I've always had an issue with their wait times and how it seems the wait staff is always over-extended like they aren't staffed enough for the volume of customers. The last time I was there, I had an atrocious experience and will never return. After waiting 25 minutes, the hostess called our party and then bolted out the door to go outside. We didn't want to sit outside but to be fair, we didn't request indoors. The hostess sat us at a table outside without shade and since the sun was starting to set, the sun was right in our eyes. We needed another chair for our party and she brought back a wet chair. It was wicker so wiping it down didn't get all the water off. She said sorry it rained and handed me the wet chair to sit on. I sat down and my shorts immediately started to get wet. I went inside and asked if we could get a table inside. The other hostess asked what was wrong with the table outside so I mentioned the sun and the chair discomforts. The first hostess who sat us outside, took us to a new table. After she was out of range from the manager and other hostesses, she turned to me and rudely stated that I should not have informed the front of the chair and not wanting to sit outside and that I should have stated it initially instead of being a poor customer and causing trouble. Since it was my friend's birthday I let it go and didn't cause a scene. The waitress we got was a rock star. She was friendly, courteous, knew the menu and gave us recommendations. The turkey burger is always good and cooked well. I think I've ordered it the last three visits. She had the staff sing happy birthday to my friend. Towards the end of the meal, I asked to speak to the manager who came over and I told her about the initial hostess experience. She really didn't ask for details or seem very concerned. I will not return here due to the poor host station customer service. The wait staff is awesome and the food is good especially considering the extensive menu. Props to the chefs and cooks in the back for pumping out high quality food at a reasonable rate. It's just hard to overcome an experience when the hostess is rude and then fires back when you bring it to their attention."
Anony M.,"Aurora, CO",19,12,,4.0,9/22/2016,"I love the luxurious atmosphere, but the place was too dim. The food is generally pretty good. The cheesecake selection is huge. They are very good- I can see why they specialize in them, but they are a little too sweet for my taste. The prices for the entrees are decent, but the drink menus are overpriced in my opinion. The service is good."
Tim E.,"Aurora, CO",27,131,247,4.0,12/22/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is always a good choice. The menu is large and caters to all tastes and diets; there's Italian, Asian, American food and of course cheesecake. It's all good and portions almost always leave you with left overs. I've been here several times and have never been let down. This place is very popular, so expect it to be busy. Put your name on the list , it's worth it!"
Sarah H.,"Aurora, CO",103,381,183,4.0,11/24/2013,"I won a $50 gift certificate, so I took my mom - I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over 10 years.   Not much has changed - they've got a massive menu and a big selection of specialty cheesecakes.   We had no wait to be seated for our Saturday lunch.  Our server was nice but a bit impatient - she checked in with us several times while we were perusing the menu until we explicitly told her it was going to take us at least 10 minutes to read through it all.   I ordered a parmesian chicken on a basil and olive oil pasta topped with prosciutto and arugula salad.  It was a bit greasy but so, so good and the portion was HUGE - I ate my leftovers for two days!  The strawberry lemonade was also very good - a perfect mix of sweet and tart - and the refill was included.  I ordered 2 cheesecakes to go - one for me and one for my partner.  Mine was a lemon cheesecake with raspberry soaked lady-finger crust, and though the portion was small for the $6 price tag, it was so rich that this too lasted me several days.  My partner got a tiramisu flavored cheesecake that was downed within 2 minutes of being handed to him (hey Mikey, I think he likes it!).   I really enjoyed the food at Cheesecake factory and would definitely go back for a special occasion.  While the prices are a bit steep (around $20 per entree), when it lasts for days, it's actually a great value."
Daniel L.,"Centennial, CO",99,28,21,4.0,11/11/2015,"This place gets a bad wrap.    I love it.   Yes it's a chain.   But they have a huge menu, something for everyone.   And there is always good to take home for lunch the next day.    I am convinced that Belinda Carlisle's song, ""heaven is a place on earth"" was written about the Key Lime cheesecake and the Avocado Spring rolls.    Minus 1 star for tables that so close to each other you can share plates with your neighbor.     It's a huge space, not an airplane.   Remove a few tables and make it comfortable for your guests."
Lee S.,"Parker, CO",184,417,41,3.0,9/12/2013,"The Salmon was very tasty. Cooked in a Coconut sauce served over a bed of brown rice and served with some fresh veggies. The beer was cold. The dark bread with fresh soft butter was delicious. Those were the good parts. Now the not so good. Where was Penny? or Bernadette? Service was slow. It's crowded. Inside and out. It's in a mall. It was Saturday at 5:00. I don't like waiting for a table at an average place. The cheesecake was ""okay."" Nothing to write home about. This was my first time here. It was a request from the birthday boy. Will I return? Not for dinner. Maybe for Happy Hour (which I hear is pretty good)"
William K.,"Louisville, CO",1,24,2,5.0,1/31/2016,"I love The Cheesecake Factory, as their food is always delicious and their desserts wonderful, but I am writing this review because of their service. Simply put, the Park Meadows location has always completely hit it out of the park for me. Their food is consistently tastier than at their other Denver area locations, and the service is always at least normal if not exceptional. I hope this location keeps up the good work."
Rocket R.,"Aurora, CO",6,18,19,5.0,5/31/2014,Foods awesome Dessert is even better Staff is superb Loads of hot chicks everywhere.  Triple thumbs up
Vivi M.,"Lakewood, WA",1,14,2,1.0,6/26/2014,"This is a really bad cheesecake, I order the grill artichokes they were really dry and uncooked. They I got salmon and it was so dry that it hurt my throat.  This place sucks big time. Need a new chef or somebody that supervise what they are serving our food."
Jim V.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,9,,1.0,9/9/2015,"If you go on a Saturday evening,  prepare for mass chaos. We were given a pager,  only to have the pager go off and have it snatched out of our hands with 4 other families. No explanation of what was going on. When I finally flagged someone down,  I was told to be patient and that our name would be called out when a table was ready. The lobby is extremely loud and hearing your name called is difficult at best (and why not use the pagers as most places do?) My ""complaining"" was rewarded by us being seated in the poorest seat outside. This time,  I did loudly complain and we were finally moved to a different table. Food was so-so.  The service from our actual waiter was great. For the whole experience, I'd save my money and go to cheaper competitor next time. Was not a pleasant date night. Other days may be better,  but we won't be back to experience it."
Elizabeth E.,"Aurora, CO",95,11,1,2.0,12/12/2015,"It is unacceptable to seat people 2 feet away from one another, and expect them to pay $20 a plate with bad service, my server was unable to talk to my face and spoke to my back because he was unable to get between my table, and the table next to us. I believe it's also unacceptable to not say anything to a patron with a screaming child when they have well over 40 people sitting around them. Over all the service was friendly though not the best service I've had and the food was an accepted size for the amount of money; taste wise was decent like most of the times I've come. Thought I have yet to have anything from the cheesecake factory thats spectacular. Lastly a server should never put their butt in my face do to the inability to get between tables, and take my drink while another server come to fill drink. A bit unorganized to say the least."
Gloria M.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,4.0,8/19/2016,"Service was excellent, food was great the only down side to this place is the waiting time. We waited 50 minutes to be seated for dinner on a Saturday night. It is busy but It was worth it. Time can go fast if you're walking around the mall and doing a little shopping. I had the ribeye steak with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, everything was cooked to perfection."
ParkerGal 1.,"Parker, CO",2,103,2,1.0,2/14/2016,"Love their cheesecake but TERRIBLE, SLOW service just trying to get cheesecake at 9pm! Come on, staff the bakery area better!"
Damion W.,"Aurora, CO",150,351,322,4.0,7/10/2013,"I had the Cuban sandwich with fries, the portions were great (as they always are at Cheesecake Factory) the food was fresh and didn't taste like ""chain restaurant"" food. The waitress was courteous and there wasn't a moment our table went without anything.  The menu is HUGE and at times it can be overwhelming trying to decide what you want. The best idea is to pick two or three things and ask for a recommendation from the wait staff, they are extremely knowledgeable on the drinks as well as all the menu items.  We stat out on the patio (around dinner time) in the summer and the sun wasn't overbearing, there weren't any flies or bugs to annoy us and we really enjoyed ourselves.  This was the first time I returned to the Cheesecake Factory in about 2 years and it was just as good from the last time I remembered eating here!"
Steve S.,"Ashland, OR",127,506,22,2.0,5/11/2014,"You know I've just about had enough with large portions to make up for mediocre food. And the king of this method is The Cheesecake Factory. Let me make this clear, go ANYWHERE else besides this place. Unless you want to have crappy leftovers for the next three days. It's sad in this day and age that a restaurant like this can still serve uninspired and pointless food at a HIGH price point and an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are in a cheaply adorned porn shop. The only reason this is not a one-star place for me is that the food is edible. But if I'm going to spend at least $10 to $15 on lunch, it's got to be much more than that. Do yourself a favor, head over the Yard House if you must have a chain restaurant or even McDonalds to offer a better experience."
Courtney M.,"Pontotoc, OK",10,4,,1.0,5/16/2015,"Staff was rude and practically laughed me out the door when I asked for a large table for our group and quoted me ""2.5-3 hours."" The host was also rude to other patrons when they asked how much longer and he would accuse them of not paying attention to their pagers when both said they hadn't gone off. Went across the street to the Yard House and it was fantastic with great service."
Jennifer W.,"Denver, CO",1,44,1,4.0,1/31/2016,"The service, bread, appetizers, and cheesecake were great.  I went here with my family on a Sunday and there is a special Sunday brunch menu.  I ordered the veggie Benedict.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, but the veggie patty things they were served on top of was weird and not tasty. I prefer English muffins with my eggs Benedict,  and it was my fault for not reading the menu closely.  No big deal though. The whole experience was fine."
Riza H. C.,"Denver, CO",362,1249,9729,3.0,4/12/2011,"This was my 2nd visit here.  Unfortunately, my first visit was MANY MOONS AGO, and I forgot to write the review.  Oh well. This time around, its my review BASED ONLY FOR THE DESSERTS, dine in.  Went here after our lunch.   Date : Friday March 4th 2011. My fren T ordered one of the Specials, MANGO Keylime Cheesecake.  This was highly recommended by one of the waitstaffs.  This cheesecake, I like, and my fren like it too.  She also order a beverage aka Coffee and a vanilla ice cream with Strawberries for her little one. From what I recall here was what I ordered : *  A Chocolate Cake named the Black Out Cake, I think.  I was disappointed with my order.  The cake was too dense aka DRY and too sweet for my taste bud. *  Reese's PB Choc Cake Cheese Cake for Hubs, an order of cheesecake to go.  When Hubs ate it @ home, he likes it alot, since anything with REESE's that will be his favorite. 8405 Park Meadows Center Drive Littleton, CO 80124 (303) 858-1111"
Houston H.,"Parker, CO",164,10,,2.0,1/18/2016,"Not my favorite. Ordered regular spaghetti and asked for no cheese. The waiter came out and said the meatballs had cheese in them so I asked for something to substitute it like chicken, and they brought it out with meatballs so ultimately the people I was with all ate before me and then stared at me until I was done haha. And our waiter seemed on the go and rushed the whole time. Not the nicest. Overall I could live without."
