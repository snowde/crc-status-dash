A D.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,,4.0,1/18/2016,"First of all, the wait time was very long (40 minutes) We ordered 2 kids meals, the Pasta with Alfredo sauce and Chicken Tenders/w fries. The portions were large. We also ordered Thai Chicken Wraps which were OK. We will be back!"
Marie R.,"Chesapeake, VA",25,269,202,5.0,3/19/2013,"It is a really nice cheesecake factory: PROs:  Nice, friendly service.  A little bit of a wait on weekends but pretty fast on weekdays.  The portion sizes are very generous.  There are many varieties of cheesecakes and other desserts, which all are delicious :).   Cons:  Calories! If you count calories I recommend not eating everything in one setting.  If you are like me and like to cheat once in a while you'll be fine ;).   Great for kids, date night, by yourself, you name it.  The prices are a tad bit on the high side, but IMO it is worth it."
July H.,"Raton, NM",0,3,,4.0,7/2/2015,"I ate here last night, the wait was pretty long but that's because it was super busy. My family seemed pleased with their food, but when I ordered a mac and cheese burger, I got a crab cake instead of mac and cheese on my burger. The waiter and manager apologized and got me a new one, which had the exact same problem. After telling them this, they decided to take my meal off of the ticket and gave me free cheesecake after getting me the correct burger. They were super friendly and despite this happening I enjoyed it."
Ily V.,"Lone Tree, CO",2,4,7,3.0,4/27/2015,"Restaurant is empty and you have to wait 15 minutes???? And on top of that you get an attitude from the hostess? Oh yeah I forgot, she's busy chatting with the other hostess. Great food. Horrible service. Because of Elisse I should give them 1 star."
Darin B.,"Aurora, CO",1,100,101,4.0,8/16/2015,Good place to eat we had good service and good food. Only thing was they put the silverware directly on the tables kinda gross. Two people for lunch appetizer and desert bill $74.00
Chelsey H.,"Centennial, CO",108,2,1,1.0,6/14/2016,"Came tonight to celebrate my son's first birthday, but mostly an excuse for the adults in his life to get together. I called earlier in the day to make a reservation for 10, but they told me they wouldn't take reservations after 5:30 pm, I needed one for 6:30 so I guess we had no choice, but to walk in. At 6:30 we arrived with half our party, the rest running a few minutes late. They said our table is ready, but we weren't allowed to sit down until everyone arrived. Frustrating because I am holding a 29 lb baby in my arms. A few minutes later, the rest of our party arrive and we go to tell the concierge we are ready and they tell us now we have to wait 15 minutes. Finally, we get seated and they don't bring a high chair nor a kids menu even though they asked us if we needed on right before we sat down. Luckily our waiter, was the only good part about the experience. He was quick to get us a high chair, kids menu and was very friendly. We order and it takes AN HOUR to receive our food. Then when we receive our food, they are delivered one at a time spanning a total of 10 minutes to serve us all. My husband's food and son's meal were supposed to have fries, but we had to wait another 5 minutes to receive them. The food was ok, nothing great. When all was said and done it took us 2.5 hours to eat dinner."
Dan D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",47,22,,1.0,3/24/2014,"Very expensive menu, so do as others suggest: be prepared to shared entre's or bring home food. Cleanliness is what turned us off.  From the knee up is a nice restaurant, but the floor is a mess, discusting. Staff are so busy, they brush by so quickly, you feel you have to dodge out of their way, so weird. Sat near the kitchen, and it was very loud. Staff was nice, but didn't make up for the lack of cleanliness. Entres were pretty gross, but dessert of course was fabulous. I will not go back to this place due to floor being so gross."
Rebecca T.,"Englewood, CO",0,10,1,1.0,3/24/2015,"My husband and I have been here several times and the reason we kept going back was because he liked the Kobe beef burger. Until we went and I food tasted bad, his burger fell into pieces and tasted bad and we both felt sick. And that was just the food. The service was slow and did not check up on us and very unprofessional. Several times we heard them yelling inappropriate jokes around us toward each other. We still like Cheesecake Factory but we will never return to this location"
Cody M.,"Castle Rock, CO",16,68,29,2.0,6/1/2015,"The good thing is I didn't expect much from this assembly-line food factory but the shrimp summer rolls were surprisingly excellent.  The skinnylicious vegetable salad was just okay though.  They were slammed since it was lunchtime in the mall and it's cheesecake factory so the service and food were both acceptable but there is something inherently wrong with a place that offers over 350 items... I mean seriously this place has the largest damn menu on record.  Asian, American, Italian, wtf are you!??!"
Otabek S.,"Englewood, CO",64,49,6,5.0,4/1/2016,"like always i love this place , we went there with my brother his wife , we all love this place, everything is fresh, testing good, service is great, i highly recomendate this place!!!!"
Matt H.,"Granby, CO",0,5,,4.0,7/20/2015,"My family and I ate here at the Factory and had a good experience.  The food was good, the service was really good and the atmosphere was warm."
Jessica M.,"Lone Tree, CO",2,6,,5.0,5/13/2016,Amazing service and food. Very clean establishment and friendly staff. Great outdoor seating area for nice days. Highly recommend this place! Will be returning!
Patterson M.,"Parker, CO",0,41,,2.0,5/8/2016,"Took the family of 5 for Mothers Day.  We had a couple of burgers, pasta dish, spaghetti and lettuce wraps.  Soda's but no desserts.  With tip the check was $110.  This is just rediculous.  The Chicken Alfredo that my daughter ordered was $20 and it was average at best.  No more we are done paying over the top for average food."
Kate Y.,"Morrison, CO",40,3,,1.0,8/18/2013,"It has been a few years since my last  Cheesecake Factory visit, I am surprised by how terrible our (nearly) three hour experience was. While bringing out the children's food first was appreciated, it was quickly followed by one adult meal...10 minutes later another meal came out...5 minutes later 2 more meals came out (including a pink in the middle turkey burger)..it was another 25-30 minutes before our final meal came out (I am shocked they left that and the undercooked turkey burger on our bill )...so much for eating as a family. When it came to dessert, it was the same screwy, sporadic delivery, only with the added bonus of one completely forgotten order... which came with more excuses.   My salad was pretty good, my smore's cheesecake was a letdown/borderline gross (it tasted more like a malted milk ball than anything).  I'm utterly disappointed that we chose this place to celebrate a birthday...never again... If I had to sum this up in one word it would be: YIKES."
Charlotte M.,"Parker, CO",12,8,,4.0,5/2/2015,"Beware, the drinks are too expensive for what they are. 8.50 jack and coke? 8.50 flute of prosecco? The service was great, thanks Mike/Muchael! He was very attentive. Cheesecake and small plates were great. Try the Cuban crispy rolls and the beats with goat cheese!! The employees at the hostess stand were extremely nice!"
Linda T.,"Menifee, CA",1,13,1,2.0,5/12/2015,"The service was adequate...the food was warm... Plates dropped off and no one checked if we needed any thing ... Thy he scampi had not been deveined .... Mentioned my granddaughter's birthday .. It was ignored .... Won't be back,"
Jamie L.,"Broomfield, CO",307,908,1148,4.0,6/20/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory. It's chain-food, formula food, but it's Good Chain Food.  The portions are not as ridiculous as I remember them.  The menu IS as ridiculous as I remember it.  My friends have this tradition.  They take the menu AWAY from me after giving me 20 minutes to look at it and then I'm FORCED to make a decision.  Crude but Effective! Honestly, though, The Cheesecake Factory is the place to go when you don't know where to go.  Good reliable food, consistently good service, and roughly 33 Cheesecakes to choose from. There's something for everyone, every ""Genre"" of food, from Asian to Italian, Home-Cookin' to Steaks, Salads and PIzzas and more.  And somehow, all are done well. I love to cozy up in a booth and talk over drinks and cheesecake.   ...And I don't even like cheesecake."
Milagros M.,"Brighton, CO",1,3,,1.0,6/27/2015,"The wait to get a table was very long. The food was just ok. The chairs are very uncomfortable. The burgers where so greasy, also the wait to get the food was long as well the check."
Ai Ling C.,"Brighton, CO",87,199,48,4.0,6/12/2011,"I finally tried the red velvet cheesecake.  Wow--it's fantastic!  I loved the Reese's peanut butter cheesecake I had the last time I was here, but the red velvet cheesecake blows that one away.   My recommendation: order something small for food (less than $8 if you can swing it) and just save room for the cake.  After eating an omelette, I only managed to eat a third of my cake.  I ended up bringing the rest home, and breaking that up into two more occasions!"
Kalani F.,"Seattle, WA",145,376,,4.0,6/11/2011,"I know, it's a chain. I know, it's in a mall. It goes against everything I believe in for a restaurant, yet I'm hooked.  Not all cheesecake factories are created equal. My favorite is in Vegas and I have to eat there, every time I go.  This one is a close second.  I'm terrible too, because I order the same thing every time: Evelyn's pasta and Chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  Both that I love and believe are perfection.  Our service this last week was outstanding- attentive, polite and speedy.  When I forgot to tell our server to hold the whipped cream on the cheesecake, he made a mad dash across the restaurant.  My dad loves their coffee, which is very dark, so be prepared- the server had it filled up at just the right moments for my dad.  The bread- fabulous.  I love the bread. I'll admit it, when I was younger and poorer, happy hour drinks and this bread made a fantastic meal.  Portions are huge.  A little pricey, but you get a lot of food.  And the waitstaff- phenomenal.  I'd eat here once a week if it wasn't so out of my way.  It can also get quite loud in here, with everyone from families and couples and who all in between talking."
