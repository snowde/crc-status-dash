Hrudaya S.,"Toronto, Canada",70,147,41,4.0,6/9/2013,"It is like most cheesecake factory locations! We tried the avocado eggrolls, and WOW, it was like a party in my mouth! I would have just had them as my main course! Their food was delicious as usual! And ofcourse, we had the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and again WOW!  We definitely over stuffed ourselves, but it was all delicious till the end."
Christian W.,"Denver, CO",109,20,1,5.0,11/7/2014,"2 nd visit, this time sat at bar and again got exceptional service, just stopped in for a quick drink but Ashley and Robin were attentive an hospitable I will return."
Ashley S.,"Castle Pines, CO",0,84,,1.0,2/2/2015,"If I could give this place no stars I would, we went there a few weeks back because we have heard the food was good so we thought we would try. When we got there we got seated after only about a 20 minute wait.  When we were seated we waited over 25 minutes for a drink! We couldn't believe it. We finally asked if someone could help us because we were getting aggravated at this point. Our food was okay nothing we would rave about, but the service was SO bad we will NEVER EVER GO BACK! The waiter was a joke!"
Taylor F.,"Denver, CO",12,16,2,5.0,6/21/2013,"Let me start by saying this: I am VERY big on service. If my server does not meet my standard of service, I usually will not enjoy my visit, no matter how good the food is. Good service makes terrible food much more bearable. That being said, the gentleman who served my boyfriend and I tonight was the best server I have ever had. I desperately wish that I could remember his name. He was tall dark-haired, with dark facial hair, dark eyes and semi-large gauges in his ears. Both of us were, for lack of a better word, horribly quiet and rude, and barely spoke to him, but he still stayed incredibly friendly, polite, and smiled at both of us the entire time, and still tried to make conversation. He was absolutely wonderful. He did such a good job of staying polite and friendly that I tipped him 120% because we were that awful. My boyfriend and I arrived at The Cheesecake Factory already fighting, and both of us in very bad moods. Now, I have been to this Cheesecake Factory before, and always the staff have been very ""normal"" looking. Tonight, everyone working was tattooed, pierced, with unusual hair color and all incredibly, incredibly friendly. My favorite staff so far. As for the food, the only thing ordered were 2 waters, and the small plate of seared ahi, which was absolutely divine. I wish our fight hadn't escalated to needing to leave because I would have loved to have ordered some of the cheesecake, which I love. All in all great restaurant, great service, great food."
Mark M.,"Parker, CO",0,13,,4.0,1/25/2015,"Took family for NYE dinner.  Hour wait turned out to be only 40 minutes. but wait for food was incredibly long.  Waiter was apologetic and offered additional bread, soup etc to keep kids settled.  Brought home lots of leftovers since everyone was full when our meal finally came."
Nic T.,"Aurora, CO",55,36,9,3.0,6/3/2013,"Huge menu and good cheesecake. Unfortunately, it has become another over commercialized chain. Yes it's better than most. However, it has succumbed to mediocrity. I know in its infancy it was a really good restaurant. It has become a victim of its own success, as far as food goes.  Naturally, in places such as this the staff is good. They are held accountable for their service and this they are responsive. It's a convenience spot for us now."
Drew M.,"Parker, CO",10,47,41,4.0,6/26/2013,"Food was pretty good that day, sometimes hit and miss with this specific restaurant.  Had the fish and chips, wife had a flatbread.  Tables too close can be annoying, and in this case, a little considering the guy next to us continued to bitch about not having enough bread.  He said he'd take care of the server if he got more, don't know how that played out but he ended up ordering a small pizza for the entire table and just waters.  If you're that cheap, head down to Sbarro and get a 2 for $7 slice special.  Let me enjoy my lunch! Anyway...server was good and considering he had to deal with bread boy, i think he did a pretty good job. We took home a slice of the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake which was by far one of the richest we've ever had.  It was great, just be prepared for how much flavor it has.  I certainly couldn't eat a piece by myself."
Kate O.,"Portland, OR",15,214,559,4.0,4/10/2013,"I really like that they have a skinny menu now. We started with the crab cakes and they were AMAZING! So much crab. I may just order that for my meal next time!!! We also got the calamari. I love that they serve it with both the tarter and marinara sauce. Then I got my standard BBQ chicken salad, really love that. I ordered my son the pot stickers and they were awesome!!! My husband got the ahi tuna salad off the skinny menu and really enjoyed that too. And of course always have to take some cheesecake to go."
Amber A.,"Denver, CO",0,10,4,2.0,1/4/2016,"I really love the food that The Cheesecake Factory has, however my fiancé and I have been to the Park Meadows one twice and BOTH times his food has went to other tables while mine was brought out. The first time it took about 15 minutes and we were okay as it was just the two of us eating at the bar. The bartender apologized but we didn't it comped (I work at Corporate for The Egg and I Restaurants) we wouldn't never allow a guest to pay for a meal that they didn't receive or was wrong in our error! We took a couple out to dinner on New Years Eve and it happened AGAIN this time the manager came over to apologize along with our waitress, it took over 25 MINUTES for his plate to come out, by this time out guests had already finished and mine was cold because I wasn't going to have him eat alone. Both times they did not give us a discount or atleast comp his meal, we still had to pay 20+ dollars for his meal! I am very disappointed in their costumer service!!"
Ron H.,"Aurora, CO",1,1,,2.0,12/12/2015,"The food is decent(with very large portions), service is usually decent as well. On the other side of things it is always ridiculously loud, and if you are a party of 2 , you will  be seated at a table less than a foot away from the people next to you, close enough to hear them chew. From a place that costs near 50 dollars for 2 people to eat, I would expect to at least be able to have a conversation with the person across from me, without sharing all of the details with the 2 tables to my right and left. The server was also asking if we wanted boxes less than 5 minutes after our food came out, placing obvious emphasis on the fact that they are trying to get as many people in and out in an evening as possible. This made for a very uncomfortable environment for a meal. Definitely not in my picks for restaurants in the area."
Sandy R.,"Littleton, CO",0,9,,3.0,10/10/2012,"Ok.  Don't let my 3 stars fool you, I'll explain myself: I think the menu is just too big to easily make a decision, and if you go on the weekends it's insanity trying to get seated and the seating could be better in the atrium.  But once you know what you're doing, you can easily navigate around that. OTHER THAN THAT - the food is just amazing every time we come here, always fresh and hot and large portions (which I happen to like because I can take it for lunch the next day).  And the cheesecake, well it's the cheesecake factory, so it's amazing."
Jeremy C.,"Lakewood, CO",64,155,52,2.0,5/27/2012,"I Didn't have a horrible experience during my last visit. However the person I went with had a horrible experience and actually got sick. We didn't have cheese cake during the visit which is one of the reasons for going. I had been getting hassled about always picking the same kind of foods (american, steak and burgers to be exact) so I suggested we try Cheese Cake factory. We were in the neighborhood because they have a croc's store in the mall. The person I went with said it was horribly over priced and the food didn't make her feel right. After we got home she claimed to have fell really sick and we believe it was the food she had.  Waitresses are very good and attentive like usual."
Lisa T.,"Denver, CO",4,4,,5.0,9/14/2014,"I was super impressed!  We were told it would be a 45 min wait and it was almost exactly.  We were seated and my friends were here from out of town wanting the steak street tacos.  Once opening the menu...they weren't on it any more!  Only chicken and shrimp.  We told or waitress Lyndsey who went directly to the kitchen to ask.  The chef came out!  On a packed, busy Friday night!  Did you hear me?  He asked her exactly what kind of meat she wanted and he would take care of it.  Are you kidding me?  There are plenty of great things on the menu that they could have easily said they couldn't do it and made her choose something else, but they didn't!  They went above and beyond...we were thoroughly impressed.  Our food was all hot and delicious.  Thank you CCF...you made a great night with dinner and friends.  :-)"
Matt D.,"Denver, CO",0,45,7,2.0,3/9/2013,"Don't believe the hype. Overpriced. This place is located in a mall. Need I say more?? Crab cakes are good. Not worth $16. Got a burger. Nothing special. Ordered a chicken & pasta meal... nothing special. Ok, service is fast & friendly. I'll give it that."
Logan L.,"Castle Rock, CO",7,77,2,4.0,10/14/2012,"My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our first anniversary at The Cheesecake Factory, considering that they were open late, and it was convenient to where he was working on Saturday evening. Naturally, the restaurant was packed, but the wait was not too terrible.  The staff were very accommodating.  Our first table was in the corner at the bar, and after 10 minutes of a lady sticking her derriere in my boyfriend's face (oh and rubbing it, which was awkward) while she was talking to the table next to us, our waitress came over and asked if we would like to be reseated, and we thankfully leapt at that opportunity.  We had barely sat at our new table for 2 minutes when our waiter informed us that he thought we would be more comfortable at a booth (thank God). Our server unfortunately got double sat (where the hostesses seat two tables at a time in his section, which really throws a server off) after we moved, so he was not the most available for the first part of our meal.  My boyfriend, being the typical picky eater, ordered his staple chicken fettuccine alfredo, which he enjoyed, and I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich.  The chipolte mayo was divine, but the breading on the chicken was a bit too crunchy for me.  It was a lot of food, combined with an excellent strawberry martini, and I could barely eat half of it.  Of course that also meant that I was saving room for cheesecake.  During the fall, go for the Pumpkin Pecan cheesecake, and thank me later for the heaven that will arrive on your plate. The menu for both dinner and dessert is very expansive, with many selections.  It can get a bit overwhelming for the undecided, but there is something for every palate there! All in all, things were decently priced, considering that this is the Cheesecake Factory.  My boyfriend and I, with alcohol and the cheesecakes, spent less than $70 for both of us, which was less than what we were expecting (my guess was $85, his I won't mention to save him embarrassment). The Cheesecake Factory is a good chain restaurant, and is always a good go-to for a nice dinner out.  Plus, the cheesecake is addicting, so I will definitely be there again!"
Laura O.,"Castle Rock, CO",61,24,1,2.0,10/4/2015,We were seated on the patio...the FREEZING patio.  And the heater next to us didn't work.  And when we asked to move inside they told us it would be another half hour.  The server was amazing but the atmosphere was completely lacking.  Don't seat the patio if it's cold outside.
Cassidy D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",21,53,51,3.0,5/21/2014,"I was surprised that we were seated right away today. So that was nice. But the wait for our food and everything else was ridiculous! We waited forever for an appetizer, then even longer for our meals, longer for the checks.. It was horrendous. And when we gave her cash in the check, she didn't even bother to ask it we wanted change, she just took the rest for a tip. Food was fantastic but service... Not so much."
Tammy M.,"Englewood, CO",12,137,71,2.0,5/17/2014,It's a 2 star cause the good is usually pretty good but I ordered at 11:07am yesterday morning for curbside pickup. I ordered with a server named Diana. Of course at the end they tell you when to arrive and she said 10-15 minutes then I said see you at 11:30! My daughter had a recent head injury so we didn't go in. I arrived at 11:30. Called and Mike answered. He told me to hang tight and someone would he out. At 11:51 was when the lady arrived after three calls to mike. I didn't have time to talk to a mgr cause I needed to drop off lunch for my husband on our way home. To make matters worse I ordered a shrimp and bacon sandwich which ended up bring chicken not shrimp. Really upset and won't waste my time again. I will never recommend curbside.
Sugar L.,"Littleton, CO",97,45,23,4.0,4/11/2012,"I ALWAYS love the Cheesecake Factory, but have a hard time deciding on a  menu item when I'm hungry!  I typically go for the Bacon & Shrimp Club - so delicious, but HUGE!   Oh and the cheesecake - have you ever just gone for the Original Cheesecake?  One of the best I've ever tasted, so creamy and light.  I LOVE it!"
Carolyn H.,"Mesa, AZ",471,352,91,4.0,7/23/2012,"This is by far my favorite Cheesecake Factory location.  I always receive great service here, and last night was no exception.  Our server was really attentive and friendly (even though we walked in 20 mins prior to them closing because we thought they were open later). My votes on food: sweet corn tamale cakes and pasta carbonara.  You will not be disappointed with either of these, I promise!"
