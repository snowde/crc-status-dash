Paul H.,"Littleton, CO",6,12,8,5.0,6/24/2014,"Great service, reasonable wait time, food is way more than you need. Our server Jeremy was fantastic. He treated my son like a prince. We will be back to see Jeremy and to have more white chocolate cheesecake."
Heather G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",45,298,23,3.0,10/8/2013,"The food is always amazing. They know how to cook that is for sure. Tried the Shepard's Pie and it was to die for. I usually go for a salad but I am glad I changed things up. Our server was great too, my drink never went dry! (big pet peeve of mine) The reason they are getting three stars? SEATING! It is horrible. We were so close to our neighboring table that when they got up we got a nice butt to the face. We were practically sitting on top of each other. Not comfortable at all, we wanted to eat and get out."
Angela F.,"Castle Rock, CO",12,12,5,3.0,5/25/2014,pretty busy location since it is attached to a mall. the service was outstanding but the food was just so so. I ordered a cheeseburger and french fries were cold even though I had asked for them to be a cooked extra Crispy. I also think that the menu has too many things kind of like reading a book. the desert is really the reason you would go there after all they are called The Cheesecake Factory. I will definitely return for the cheesecake but probably not eat lunch or dinner
Jon T.,"Aurora, CO",0,43,2,4.0,12/30/2013,"Our first visit to the Cheesecake Factory was pretty bad. Our server lady was super slow, almost never came to check on us, and almost made us never come back here. It took 5-10 minutes just to take our order of drinks and another 15-20 minutes to take our order of food. It took 15 minutes after our waters had been emptied to finally get a refill of water. Another 15 minutes later, our dishes were finally taken away and a dessert menu was given to us. But we just told her to bring the check since we were going to grab dessert at the counter because she was just providing terribly slow service. I got some salmon dish and it was mediocre. The salmon was a little past well done even though I ordered medium rare, but at least it was not raw. We got the s'mores cheesecake and it was amazing! It was the only saving grace for this place (which makes sense given the name of the restaurant). We came back a second time (hoping we would not get the same server lady as last time) because of the ""Buy a gift certificate and get two free slices of cheesecake"" promotion. I got a chicken with linguine pasta dish this time around. The food is mediocre, but at least it is consistently mediocre? This time around, we got a really amazing server who was constantly keeping our water filled, packing our leftovers for us, and providing amazing, timely service. All in all, a great experience with amazing cheesecake, but mediocre food again. The mediocre food would net three stars, but the amazing cheesecakes pull it up to a four. The terrible service followed by the amazing service leave the rating at a 4.0"
Devin S.,"Littleton, CO",1,45,10,4.0,4/23/2014,"The family stopped in for Easter dinner. One of the first times we didn't have to wait for a table. Our meal was very good, but, 2 of us ordered the chicken and it seemed like it was taking a long time to get to our table.  The kitchen manager came to our table to apologize for the delay and they would comp those 2 meals. Seems they pre-cook the chicken meals during the day but they ran short that night and that's what caused the delay."
Michelle N.,"Crestview, FL",9,29,8,4.0,1/28/2012,"I normally get the steak Dianne but this last visit didn't do it justice so the dogs got dinner. I adore several items from here: first being the blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake. Next, the apple crisp cheesecake. Last but not least, my most favorite find here: the corn cakes!!!!!!!! The salsa verde that they managed to come up with is to literally, die for. I stopped myself from eating the entire appetizer so I could take them home for a later treat. We got all the fixings on the side because my husband is anti-condiment and I am a pro-condiment and like to experiment with different combinations versus having it all piled onto one bite. I could make these a meal next time. Great, now my mouth is watering again..."
Sarah K.,"Richmond, VA",348,315,300,4.0,5/28/2011,"No reservations accepted on the weekend--be prepared to wait a while if you're stopping by on a Saturday night (as we did). To pass the time we had drinks and appetizers in the bar area.  I highly recommend the Thai lettuce wraps.  They are fresh, healthy and accompanied with three dipping sauces.  Delish.  An attentive waitress kept our drinks full and our spirits higduse we waited it out... flash forward to dinner... Our waiter was memorable (in a good way) but I got the feeling he was serving a few too many tables (not his fault!). It was a busy night so a couple things took longer than preferred (e.g. boxing up leftovers...bringing dessert menus), but he gets an A for effort and personality.   The food was really, really good. Monstrous portions, prepared exactly as requested. The Santa Fe salad is always a good choice (I ask for the dressing on the side...it's rich and addicting!).  My sis LOVED the stuffed chicken tortillas. The grilled corn cakes, melted cheese, and savory chicken unite in flavorful harmony.  The hardest part of the meal is deciding which kind of cheesecake to order.  With over 30 tasty options you're bound to run into some indecisiveness. Chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake was sinful, and the original cheesecake was light and fluffy (I personally prefer more density).  Although lengthy, a very good experience."
Amber O.,"Falcon, CO",0,15,1,1.0,5/13/2014,"Horrible food and over priced. We ordered the calamari and was mushy, I had to spit it out on a napkin. Then we both got our meals and were highly disappointed. It was just not good at all. My husband found things in his pasta that weren't even supposed to be part if his meal, which just shows how sloppy they are in the kitchen. Save your money. Go somewhere else."
Jayson L.,"Denver, CO",71,53,99,4.0,6/30/2013,"I have always been overwhelmed by the menu at The Cheesecake Factory. However, I am no longer in this situation due to the discovery of one terrific menu item: Chicken Bellagio. The combination of crispy chicken breast, basil pasta, prosciutto, and arugula salad is genius and the portion size leaves enough for a late night snack or lunch the next day. I've converted a few people to this dish and they are satisfied."
Deno V.,"Castle Pines, CO",18,96,1,4.0,4/16/2014,Always a great ambiance. The food never let's me down. This place is so reliable. I love the Chicken Marsala. Sweet corn tamales are my favorite appetizer. Service is hit or miss from time to time but I guess that any restaurant. Our server had a few senior moments and had to be reminded about simple requests. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Ask me.
Jafey A.,"Parker, CO",6,397,,2.0,7/23/2013,"The food has really taken a dip at this Cheesecake Factory.  I used to eat here weekly and we stopped because of the bad service, but I came back in because I missed the food. Big mistake.  The portions are smaller which is fine, but the food tastes frozen and old.  I had a chicken sandwich with fries and my wife had a salad.  The salad tasted old and the fries were just terrible.  The cheesecake is still great but the meal was terrible."
Chadd S.,"Loveland, CO",22,27,,3.0,9/24/2011,"My first time eating here. Pretty classy joint for a restaurant based around cheesecake. Waitress was annoying on several levels. Spoke in really strange octaves that were atrocious to my ears.  Food was good but not worth the enormous prices, HOWEVER, the Calamari appetizer made me gurgle with joy."
Justin B.,"Murray, KY",3,68,3,5.0,2/21/2014,"Took the wife here on her b-day......also valentine day.  Wait wasn't too bad for a holiday and Friday evening. Walked around the mall then sat down. Having the ability to shop made the wait nice. I ordered the steak and salmon and a beer, wife ordered the shrimp with a mixed drink. Service was top 10 ever, period. The server was so great, made sure the management knew, they took time on a busy night to hear my compliment. I'm a cheesecake snob, real cheesecake is only made in Europe. The Cheesecake Factory is the closest to the real thing I've found in the states in a normal restaurant. We will be back for sure!"
Brandon C.,"Pleasanton, CA",57,473,16,3.0,11/14/2011,"I dined in the bar area one night and got takeout another. Service for both visits was fast, friendly and warm. My food was cooked perfectly. This was a familiar spot to wind down the evening while in town on business."
Crystal T.,"Campbell, CA",30,217,28,3.0,12/29/2013,"Cheesecake is always fabulous and there are tons of choices on the menu. My reason for 3 stars is my meal was a bit too salty. I got the tuna tataki salad and usually is very good, although this time the tuna had too much seasoning on the outside, way to salty and peppery. Lost the flavor of the fish due to this. The wait also was 30 minutes longer than we were told. I don't mind waiting, I just like to have a better expectation of how long I will be waiting. Overall still like coming here, but will try ordering something different next time."
Olivia B.,"Littleton, CO",62,96,,2.0,9/15/2011,"Cheesecake only gets three stars because of their Cheesecake. Don't even bother going here for dinner. Unless you like restaurants that have such a big menu and diverse array of cuisines that they can't get one thing right...  Yes, they have Asian and American, Italian and everything in between. You can have whatever your little heart desires. But its all sub par. They are a CHEESECAKE factory. A factory of desserts. If you want wontons, ravioli, even a hamburger, don't bother. Go to a real Asian restaurant, or a real Italian restaurant. Flip your own burgers. It's nothing special, honestly. If you're a tourist and aren't adventurous enough to try a new restaurant and a new city, then yeah, go to the Cheesecake Factory. You'll get mediocre food for a dumb price. If you want salads and pasta servings as big as your head, go here too. If you like eating 3,500 calorie meals... definitely go here.  Maybe this one just sucks? It's in the mall, that might have something to do with it. On another occasion, my friends and I were craving cheesecake on a Saturday night after some time out. It was only 11:30. They close at 12 on weekends. They saw us walking up and came over and LOCKED THE DOORS ON US. Terrible, terrible customer service. When the customer service isn't awful, the waiters are way too attentive... refilling your drinks when it's not necessary, being pushy.  Spare yourselves."
Mark P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,10,1,1.0,1/31/2014,"Ordered dry chicken tacos with dry rice and a slop of beans.  Jeez, this was bad.  We got there as soon as they opened. Went to the airport today and decided to take our friend to the cheesecake factory.  Other times, the food was good.  Don't know what happened at this Cheesecake Factory."
Chris A.,"Morrison, CO",0,15,,4.0,1/14/2014,"I have been here several times, it's always a pleasant experience. They have a huge menu, and usually that scares me. However, everything I've tried tastes great! I just tried the chicken stuffed tortillas, it was amazing!"
Amanda N.,"Denver, CO",39,191,,5.0,9/27/2013,"Cheesecake factory has yet to disappoint me. Our server (I wish I had gotten her name) was beyond fantastic. For food we had the avocado egg roll appetizer (these things are the BOMB), for entrees my husband had the chicken...something, that I can't remember the name of, but he said it was delicious. I ALWAYS get the farfalle with garlic, it's my standby and I love it every time. Cheesecake a plus, the atmosphere was just fine, and like I said, service was a 10 last night."
Rick L.,"Aurora, CO",6,89,93,1.0,3/26/2013,Horrible discourteous service.  Waiter had dirty hands and was mean.  Never will go again to this establishment.
