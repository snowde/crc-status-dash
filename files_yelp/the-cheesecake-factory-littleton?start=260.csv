Max S.,"Denver, CO",14,37,,4.0,1/2/2011,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factories around the country many times and there is something to be said for consistent good food. Personally I like to review restaurants based on what they are, is this a high end restaurant with a celebrity chef? No it isn't, so I'm not going to rate it based on that criteria. What it IS is a reasonably priced premium CHAIN. Based on that, I would say Cheesecake Factory is a great experience and a good value. The service is consistently good, the food is delicious and the ambiance is nice.  Some of my favorites are: 1. Chicken Bellagio 2. Tomato Basil Pasta 3. Grilled Chicken Medallions 4. Meatloaf For Deserts try: 1. Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake 2. 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake 3. Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple If you're looking for a consistently good meal and service, I would say you're safe with CF."
Deborah B.,"Kirkland, WA",2,92,3,1.0,7/5/2014,"We had a large group in for dinner and celebrate one of the player's 16th birthday. We had probably 20 in our party. Avg price per meal, not including cheesecake, with drinks is $20, so that's about $400 plus tip-give or take. One of the moms brought a birthday cake and we were not allowed to serve the cake without paying a fee. Really??? Obviously they hoped to get another $7 for a slice of cheesecake in addition to making a huge killing on our group. Customer service=0"
Joe J.,"Denver, CO",68,474,93,3.0,8/13/2013,"We came here for a co-worker's celebratory lunch.  There were 8 or 9 of us I think.  We called ahead for a reservation, but they weren't ready to seat us.  In fact it took another 10 minutes or so standing in the entrance area.  Once we were seated, our waitress was helpful and pretty quick with drink orders.  It took another few minutes to get the food order taken.  Then, it seemed like we waited an eternity for the food to arrive.  Super slow kitchen.  I had the Baja chicken tacos and they were pretty bland.  I suggest not ordering them.  They had so little taste.  I was really really disappointed.  The check was split up between everyone, but with large parties they put a guaranteed 15% tip added in.  That has got to be the biggest pain in my butt ever.  I never tip less than 20%.  I totally get the reasoning behind it, but I hate having to recalculate an already calculated tip then add it all together.  For what I paid, I got slow service from a good waitress, a really sub-par meal, and an annoying check to recalc.  If I'm taking any clients out or thinking about finding a place to eat myself, I won't even consider Cheesecake Factory from this point on.  Sub-par on almost every level."
Whitney W.,"Englewood, CO",409,201,155,2.0,5/19/2014,"Me and my boyfriend decided to go here and sit on the patio and enjoy the scenery. We did end up waiting a while to be seated. Cheesecake factory has such a big menu and so that is why I enjoy coming here because there is all types of food to eat.  Long story short our food was pretty good but the service was just really bad. It took them forever to come over to our table and once they did, well first let me expand on saying they. We had two servers that we were thrown back and forth between. We wait to order for a ridiculously long time and that is how we met our second server. Second server then brought us bread which you do get first thing or at least everyone else around us did. He took our order saying that he would fill in for her while she was on her dinner break. A. how tacky is it to tell us that the reason why she didnt take your guys order and you have been sitting here for 20 minutes is because she went to eat and didnt say anything to us. Then ended up she help us once at the end.  Just overall we were not expecting that experience and that will probably detour us from picking the cheesecake factory again out of the blue. Can get better service somewhere else and we want the whole package. The food here is always great tho."
Desiree R.,"Houston, TX",31,150,89,4.0,9/10/2010,"I know this is a chain restaurant but I still love it anyway.  After a day of shopping at Park Meadows there is nothing more satisfying that taking a lunch/early dinner break here.  I know the food will be good (maybe not great- but satisfying)- and the cheesecake of my choice will be awesome.   Obviously there are drawbacks- menu is HUGE (way too many choices), unless you're in a booth, the seating is very close together so you can hear most peoples' conversation, and it is ALWAYS busy.  But nonetheless I still find this a reasonable priced place that serves consistently good food.  (the portions are huge- I always suggest getting the lunch or half portion-you are still guaranteed to have leftovers) The work staff at this location has always been courteous and fun and then décor is pleasant.  Last but not least the cheesecake- if you're not a fan this is not the place for you.  Having more than 30 different kinds- it's amazing.  The special Red Velvet is perfect- no overwhelmingly sweet just a bit of heaven.  My FAVORITE is the Tuxedo cheesecake- a perfect melding of Chocolate Cheesecake and vanilla Mascarpone Mousse is mouth watering.   Oh and if you get the chance try the fried macaroni and cheese- maybe the best thing ever to come out of this place!"
Rachel B.,"Lakeland, FL",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2012,"we came into the restaurant at 12:30 on the day after Christmas. While we knew it would be busy especially with 13 people, but the hostess told us it would be about an hour. A even said it would be fine to split us up into two tables if needed. She said that would be fine and we could probably even get in faster. After waiting for 20 minutes, e checked and were told it was another 80 min. Wait. But they were working to get us altogether at one table.  we checked with them after an hour, we were told it was still another 20 min wait, which is what they said they told us in the beginning -WHICH WAS NOT TRUE. they tell you anything to get you in to wait and then push you offs avatar you have waited so long. A still got split up into two tables."
Shankar R.,"Dallas, TX",15,74,83,5.0,6/10/2013,"Checked in over the weekend for Saturday lunch.  It's pretty much busy but straight away we were seated.  The menu was huge and I felt reading my text book for the exam. :) Started with crab bites and chicken Samasos (Indian style). Main course  Louisiana chicken pasta - perfectly cooked and liked the way chicken is grilled. Bang Bang chicken and shrimp - I can say WOW for everything, the way it's presented and also the taste. The gravy is taste of more coconut flavor and shrimp is cooked properly. In the middle of the plate, the rice is topped with chopped peanuts and cilantro. Coming to the dessert, we have no clue about the order. Finally we asked the staff who served us (I did remember her name RACHEL) and she suggested the fresh banana cream Cheese cake. The cake tastes superb. The portions are good for what you pay and I felt the sodas are overpriced even though they have the refill option.  Friendly and attentive staff!!!!"
Arlyn C.,"Denver, CO",20,190,1,4.0,8/8/2010,"Came here again for lunch.  Same story, thank goodness, but alas, we have cheesecake this time! Cuban sandwich: 5/5.  Again Navajo sandwich: 4/5.  The fried bread was so deliciously lard-y & crunchy, omg still thinking about it.  This would have gotten 5 stars IF they had added some sort of distinguishable spread, like a spicy, chipotle, garlic mayo.. Something rather than plain mayo.  It needed a kick, otherwise, finger-licking good French fries: 4.5  So crispy on the outside & nice and potato-y on the inside, just like I like it. Oh yah & the starter salads? 4/5. We asked for broccoli to be added and we were hooked up. The balsamic vinegarette was also perfectly balanced. And now, for the grand finale... Red velvet cheescake: 4.5/5  Moist, creamy, not overly sweetened, delicately whipped.. Kahlua cheesecake 4/5.  See above + coffee flavored graham cracker crust... *drool"
Archer A.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,97,19,2.0,9/11/2012,"Leave this one well alone if you've ever been to a decent Cheesecake Factory, such as in Irvine or Houston for example. Just rotten food at top prices. I could go into detail, but oh why bother. One redeeming factor.. friendly waitresses."
Alexa D.,"Denver, CO",3,12,,2.0,10/4/2011,Not sure exactly what the hype of this place is.... The wait is long and chaotic at best. Food is so so and HUGE!!! Not sure I need all that salad. You can easily split a dish among three people. Don't think i'll be going back anytime soon.
Leslie K.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,6,,1.0,5/23/2014,What a regret! A regret that I did not send my onion rings and california philly back to the kitchen.  The onion rings were under fried even though I asked for them well done.  Waitress didn't care.  I asked if the meat was lean in the philly and the waitress said yes.  It was the fattiest  awful sandwich I've had in a long time.  Told waitrees it was layered in fat and she didn't care.  Now why oh why didn't I sent it back!  Wimp!!!The biggest waste of $20.00 on a long time.  Never will be back.
Randall S.,"Aurora, CO",138,104,20,2.0,2/26/2012,"We got a gift card for Christmas and went to use it the weekend before Valentine's Day. Or not...90 minute wait at 6PM on a Saturday night, no thank you. So, we went back on Sunday the 26th around 2PM as we were in the area. We were told 35 minutes, which we were fine with as we were able to run through the mall to get things done to kill the time. We were seated near a server station which was busy with bussers and wait staff constantly. About 10 minutes after being seated, I asked our waitress to see the manager and proceeded to explain to him that we his bus boys were hanging out at the station cussing and being disrespectful toward other staff, to the point that the female staff were visibly upset. One waitress even walked by and apologized to us after a bus boy flung the cabinet doors open and forcefully pulled chairs and stools out of it slamming them around at the edge of our table. Manager was polite, as well as appreciative and said it would be handled. Funny, our lunch was very quiet after that and we rarely saw the bus boys even enter the area.  As for the food, I had the Pasta Carbonara and she had the Chicken Bellagio. Both dishes were lacking their usually flavor, as they are, respectively, our favorites.  They really need to do something about the wait times. No reservations is a thing of the past. Not necessarily thinking I'll go back anytime soon unless family wants to go."
Leahrae A.,"Plano, TX",131,99,17,3.0,2/16/2013,I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I make it a point to visit one where ever I am.  However on this particular visit (or maybe just to this particular Cheesecake Factory) the food was a little less then excellent.  I won't say that it was bad but not their normal best.  I ordered Miso Salmon.....what I always seem to order.  The salmon was a bit dry and the rice a little undercooked.  What saved the dish was the Miso sauce which just makes the dish yummy.
Megan N.,"Dillon, CO",141,112,13,4.0,11/16/2010,"I would recommend this location rather than the one on the 16th street mall in downtown Denver.  I think there portions are bigger and it seems we dont wait as long here.  The food is good. I really like their chicken salad sandwhich. The chicken marsala dish is good. The mash potatoes are good.  Great place for groups and the cheesecake- so good!. Dont think we have ever gone here without getting cheescake to go. Something for everyone here. Can't mess up a lot of the items either. I wouldnt get a drink here- alcohol I mean, a bit pricey."
Nir M.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,1,,5.0,10/26/2014,"Great service, loved the avocado egg roll."
Jessica J.,"Centennial, CO",227,1110,857,3.0,10/28/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain and so  you probably either love it or hate it.  In my opinion, the cheesecake is top notch!  This time of year when their pumpkin cheesecake is in season is my favorite time to go.  Their cheesecakes are rich and served in huge slices that will satisfy any sweet tooth.  As for the food, well, it is what it is.  The menu is HUGE (if you haven't been there it is a spiral bound book!).  That is great for variety, but other than the cheesecake they haven't perfected anything.  My favorite food there is the BBQ Chicken salad.  Tip: the half portion is as large as any entree salad anywhere else so save some $$ and cut the portion size!  Other than that, service is usually good, the place is usually packed (so expect a wait) and parking is easy (it's in the mall)."
Mandy R.,"Southeast, Denver, CO",0,36,,1.0,10/5/2013,"Worst service tonight ever. Drove out just for pumpkin pecan cheesecake, 9 months pregnant. Spent $80 on a dinner for two, when it came time to order dessert we were told the pumpkin pecan cake was sold out. Bummer. On our way out I saw 4 slices displayed in the case (as if not sold out) I asked if they were reserved, I was told they were out-period. I asked why are they displayed, and was still denied, it was 10:30 pm so not like they needed the cake in case any longer. this was my favorite place, I will never go back. Jerks."
Kathy S.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,,5.0,7/31/2014,"My girlfriends and I come here almost once a week. The food is delicious, the staff/service is even better, and the restaurant is always so clean!"
Jeremy N.,"Centennial, CO",24,51,2,4.0,6/23/2012,Good food and atmosphere.  Their selection of alcohol is lacking though.
Ang H.,"Denver, CO",66,100,41,5.0,7/7/2013,"I'm giving this chain restaurant FIVE stars, which is unusual for me! The cheesecake factory is always a solid choice in my book. The service is consistently prompt, friendly, and attentive - every time. I give Cheesecake Factory a lot of credit for that! Also, the food is delicious. My favorite entree is the Louisiana chicken pasta - breaded white meat chicken, bow tie pasta, peppers and mushrooms in a somewhat spicy sauce. It is absolutely yummy in the tummy!! I also love the salads - each one that I try is great. The burgers are also a huge treat. Seriously, I think just about everything I've tried at Cheesecake Factory, I have enjoyed. Of course, we can't forget the wonderful desserts. I love the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake - it is decadent deliciousness. I also love the strawberry shortcake. Oh man - who is hungry?? ME!!! I'm craving some Cheesecake Factory. Right. About. Now!!!!"
