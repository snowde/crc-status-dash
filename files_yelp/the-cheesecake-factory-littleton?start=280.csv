Bryan E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,4,,5.0,6/17/2014,I went to the Cheesecake Factory with my kids for Father's Day.  The food and service were fantastic!  I live in Colorado Springs but always make a point to stop and eat here with the family when I'm in the Denver area.  The food and service are awesome everytime and we always take some good Cheesecake to go :)
Savanna G.,"Centennial, CO",1,40,,2.0,6/9/2012,"I have eaten here countless times and while the food is good, I have NEVER gotten good service.  It's gotten to the point where I start craving cheescake and have to prepare myself for a frustrating expereince.  I've literrally gotten chicken sliders where the kitchen forgot the chicken and the waitstaff was reluctant to have it remade !!!  I'm not sure what's up with the servers.  They certainly don't want for tips, with cheesecake my tickets are usually $75+"
Rohn G.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,11,,1.0,7/23/2013,Really bad experience here tonight. Salads had rotten lettuce   We used to live the Chinese chicken salads her but tonight was horrible.
Tom P.,"Pueblo, CO",0,4,15,1.0,4/22/2014,Stopped in for Easter Dinner with the familt. Our meals were horrible. The Cajun Pasta had not taste and Evelyn's Pasta tasted like hospital type food. I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory Restaurants all over the United States and this one has he worst food I have ever eaten. Don't waste your time or money pick another restaurant.
Kim L.,"Denver, CO",15,7,3,3.0,4/1/2012,We decided to try out this place today. The food was ok the place is huge the servers are very friendly & fast. Maybe next we'll be back to try out their ohter foods on the menu :)
Kim S.,"Aurora, CO",0,22,1,3.0,5/26/2009,"Consider my lesson learned. When a restaurant has a name like ""Cheesecake Factory,"" the specialty is... cheesecake. Not food. I'm still trying to figure out what the point of a twenty-three page long (and still growing) menu is.... Hmm.... I will give them this, though, the fried macaroni balls with marinara was pretty darned outta sight. And their cocktails were good. But really, outside of our appetizers, drinks, and dessert, dinner was a pretty sad affair. I went out as a group of 5 (perfect number for the appetizer... we each got our own ball thing), and we all got different entrees. I have a bad habit of stealing bites from other people's plates (No, not strangers. The people I came with. I give them bites too. It's more fair that way, and if I get something really fabulous, you know they'll be stealing bites of my dinner right back.) Anyway... I stole bites of 4 entrees, and had my own (wasabi-crusted Ahi tuna, which sounded delish. No.) entree, and I was very sad after my tasting spree... I think we all had leftovers and no one wanted a box, because the food was sad. To balance out the rather depressing and pitiful whimper that dinner was, the cheesecake was freakin fantastic. Not like mom makes (or like I make, for that matter) but considering I didn't have to go through all the effort to make a cheesecake for a really good cheesecake, they recovered themselves there. Basically, go to Cheesecake Factory for dessert if you're in this area and can't find an open patisserie shop. Otherwise, skip it, you won't be missing anything."
Mike H.,"Aurora, CO",41,50,,5.0,10/25/2010,"This is, by far, one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is just *that* good. Don't be confused by the name, it is a full-blown restaurant and not just dessert. The menu is HUGE, which can be a problem if you are hungry because you might want everything.  I love many things on the menu, but a few favorites are: The Corn Fritters Cashew Chicken Avocado Eggrolls Club Sandwich Try to get the lunch specials whenever possible.  The meals are very, very large.  You could easily share one of their meals with three people and be full.  I have to admit to eating one by myself often, but not because I should (if you know what I mean). The cheesecake is good and they have more than 20 varieties."
Lisa M.,"Fairfax, VA",7,27,34,1.0,11/13/2013,"To be fair we never got seated so my review is solely based on how we were mistreated by the host staff, and does not reflect the food or wait staff in any way. My husband and I stopped in for an early dinner while shopping at Park Meadows. It was a little before five, but there was a huge crowd of people waiting inside and out. The hostess who greeted us had colorful hair and her attitude was just as vibrant. When we checked in she told us it wouldn't be more than a few minutes because it was only the two of us and we would be seated very soon, she asked us to wait nearby for our name to be called and we were not given a pager. We waited patiently but started wondering why all the couples and groups who checked in after us were being called and seated. After about a fifteen minute wait my husband went back to the host table where a young male told us. ""We know you're waiting just go back to where you were."" He knew that we were overlooked, however did not offer an apology or suggest that we would be the next to be seated. Not only was his attitude extremely rude, but I want to add that the fact that my husband and I were the only Asians in the waiting area may have been a factor in our non-seating. Anyway, had many good experiences at the Cheesecake Factory in Hawaii, but will never give them my business in Denver."
Heather B.,"Centennial, CO",465,451,100,4.0,11/6/2008,"I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory; I'm not sure what it is. In nearly every case, the admirable architecture and ambiance are ruined by the deafening noise of other diners' conversations, and FORGET sitting at the ""tables."" I've always disliked the half padded bench seat / half chair set-ups - WHAT are they doing in a restaurant that prides itself in being ""upscale"", and WHY are they placed so closely together!? The last time I had to sit at one of these tables I felt as though the people to the left and right of us might as well have participated in our conversation. Lord knows that EVERY time I've had to get up while sitting at the tables, I've been completely embarrassed by the feeling that my butt was going to knock over their wine glass (never has!)  I'd say the three best features of The Cheesecake Factory are: 1. The wheat bread. I always ask for fifths! Ha! :P 2. The huge portions - I always have left-overs to last a few days. 3. THE CHEESECAKE What about the food, you ask? I'm a fan of the Farfalle Pasta and tend to stick to salads. I had the BBQ chicken salad for the first time during my last visit and it had to be one of the best salads I have ever had - hands down. The Luau salad is also unique, a tried and true favorite, but I wouldn't say that the food at TCF is much better than your regular chain restaurant. I was bummed that my server didn't give me the left-over wheat bread I had last time :( She didn't even ask! Oh well, there is always next time I guess!"
Gary V.,"Lone Tree, CO",4,19,,2.0,12/19/2013,"I thought I'd never have to write one of these for the cheesecake factory. It all started when we got sit at our table. Its just my wife and I at a table of four with one chair missing which isn't that big of a deal because there's only two of us not four but no place for my wife to sit down do to the fact that some lady at the other table at her chair pushed all the way practically into our table. Our waiter took our order in a timely fashion even gave us the lunch special after lunch time. So things seem to be going into a positive direction,  When are pizzas and salad arrived my wife's didn't show up so he had to go back and grab hers and my Hawaiian pizza had no pineapple. I was joking with my wife and said watch he will probably just throw some pineapple on it. Sure enough that's exactly what happened cold pineapple pieces. I gave it back to the waiter and said I wasn't interested he said he be heated for me I said no they should've done it right the first time. As a manager showed up he come comp my meal  obviously because I didn't have the pizza. And the clincher this all as they overcooked my wife's undercooked mine, And My wife said she could hear the busboys in the background laughing about them not bring her salad out and after we left we both got deathly sick, Since we both had the salads were thinking that they weren't even wash Properly."
Kristol T.,"Aurora, CO",22,94,2,3.0,3/7/2011,"75-90 minute wait on Saturday but the place didn't even look like it was packed! We ended up not waiting as long and by the time we sat down and ordered our food, it really got busy! Thank god for raspberry martinis. They are so addicting. Then we had the three cheese pasta but substitute it with Alfredo sauce and breaded chicken. Even the servers were wanting to try this combination. Our server was okay. We didn't really see her much till dessert time but she was nice. We had the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake which was delicious!"
Brian R.,"Littleton, CO",45,41,31,4.0,12/25/2010,"Special thanks to our server Anthony, great food, great service and thanks for putting up with our kids ( the couple next to us moved tables), The kids really like the sliders and the banana  cheesecake  desert was worth all the calories!"
Steph O.,"Fountain, CO",53,23,16,2.0,1/10/2013,"I had not been to a Cheesecake Factory in quite a few years and now I remember why. For the cost you would expect this place to have wonderful food and outstanding service, which is pretty much the opposite of what we experienced. The service is terrible! The waitress seemed less than interested in our table even though she could have likely made a whole lot more money in drinks (and subsequent tips alone) she didn't even care to keep the water full. Rule #1 of serving, don't let your guests run out of liquid. Rule #2, ask them if they want another drink... For as slow as it was you would think this was part of the 'slow food movement', but no. On top of that I ordered the tempura and they didn't even have chopsticks. Seriously? How hard is it to keep chopsticks in stock? And to make matters worse there was a terrible mess in one of the stalls and another door that doesn't lock. Bathrooms are a must to keep in order, especially in a restaurant. You don't want to go into a bathroom to such a disgusting mess while you're eating. UGH!!! For a meal that cost my husband and I 75$ I expected better than this. I'm terribly disappointed."
Raven P.,"Littleton, CO",10,4,,1.0,11/10/2011,"I was very disappointed in the quality of service we received at the Cheesecake Factory. Our waitress kept rushing off before we could order, our daughter's food was ready and already eaten by the time we were able to order our own meals, and despite being upfront about my onion allergy, we couldn't get a straight answer from her on what was safe to eat. Believe me, they won't be getting our patronage again."
Trevor T.,"Irvine, CA",80,365,27,3.0,4/23/2009,"My favorite here is the cheesecake variety. The bonus is the HUGE amount of food you get for your money. For a chain restaurant, they do that part right. What I don't like are the crowds, the overwhelming menu, the often unexciting food taste, and the noise."
Anne G.,"San Diego, CA",7,50,2,4.0,8/12/2010,"This was my first time here and I loved It! First I need to say My brother and his Girl work for the CCF in Vegas but this one is in Co and they did not give me coupons or a discount or anything (I wish they would however ) I ordered the Shrimp Scampi/Chicken Maidera platter the mash patatoes were addictive so yummy as was the chicken and the Scampi sauce. The reason they lost a star was for the method of cooking on the shrimp. I am a chef (Retired to go back to teaching after I injured my arm on the job)so, excuse my nit picking but I MUST critique thier techninue. The shrimp is seared to perfection and the texutre is perfect! but, because when they seared it they did not add the sauce to the pan there is no flavor seared in. So while the shrimp was perfectly cooked it had no flavor since searing removed it's nature flavor. The sauce was so good (I wanted to lick my plate) it was wasted on the shrimp that served as a spoon to simply enjoy the sauce flavor . Other than that, everything was Heavenly! the server was sweet and attentive even when my son was acting silly and she was trying to understand what he was saying but he was talking in nonsense langauge so I said ""just ignore him he is nuts "" and she says ""ok"" and walks away later when she came back she said I am the oldest of 6 I know ""nutty kids"" and we laughed she was so pleasant! I LOVE that when, the food is good the staff is great every one is doing thier job and loving it! oh, and it was my ""early"" birthday dinner so, they sang Happy Birthday and two of the staff members were holding hands while they sang and being silly afterwards it was so cute! I love to see people who are truly happy with thier jobs! it spreads to all thier customers! When you can have fun at work it says so much about you and the company you work for. Cheese Cake Factory you have a new ""regular"" The idea that they have mixed  two of my favorite things (kaula and cheesecake) together was mind blowing and they did not dissapoint! I am afraid I will prob never try any other flavor because that one was so Good! I might go back before the end of my vacation and buy some for the freezer for bad days no, in fact I MUST go back and get some for the freezer! that might save some ones' life LOL when I feel like killing some one I can talk myself down by promising myself a slice of Kaula cheese cake (yummy!)"
Jenn H.,"Sacramento, CA",98,125,495,4.0,6/25/2012,"I know it's a chain restaurant,...but its soooooo goooood! The best veggie pizza I've ever had is to be eaten here. It's HUGE!! Enough for two people to share, which is exactly what I did. I got the Veggie Pizza with goat cheese. The pizza had mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, artichoke hearts, kalmata olives and herbs. It's sooo scrumptious!! After the pizza we ordered the summer raspberry lemon cheesecake. OMG...it was like a sweet light and tangy cloud in your mouth! LOVED it! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is the service. The hostess was super nice and talkative. Our server on the other hand...:0( She was odd. She seemed to question what I would ask for and didn't seem to have any personality. She wasn't able to hear me when I spoke, from what I can assume, because she would lean in REAL close and stare at my mouth when I spoke. I found it kind of uncomfortable, even though I was trying to speak loudly and clearly. It is pretty loud in the dining area. So...other than that, my dining experience was great! The menu is soooo huge! I wonder how many cooks are back there! Another great thing they offer is the Skinnilicious menu for those watching their diet. But if you're gonna go to the Cheesecake Factory...you may as well go ALL OUT! :0) But it's a great idea. I'll definitely be back for the pizza. YUM!"
Rhonda B.,"Littleton, CO",9,8,,4.0,9/29/2010,"My husband and I love to go to the Cheesecake Factory! The atmosphere is decadent and overstated; but, hey...I love the real marble floors and white cloth napkins at lunch! They have me at the cheesecake counter when I walk in and I don't even order dessert most times when I eat there. However, they do a terrific job on cheesecake and I like the firmness of their texture. The Red Velvet is A+. I adore the soup and salad for a light lunch and the Sunday brunch is a real treat. Their menu reads like a book and I can always find something I want. I really like to order a couple of appetizers and then go for the cheesecake! ENJOY!"
Jeff L.,"Littleton, CO",28,25,5,1.0,2/17/2010,"The Cheesecake factory. That is exactly what it is, the place you go when you want good cheesecake. Unfortunately, I have yet to find any other reason to visit. I have been to the Cheesecake Factory on two separate occasions, at two different locations. My first experience was not good, but figured I would try it again since so many people seem to enjoy it. Let me first start by commenting on their menu. The menu is 15 pages long, which to some may seem like a good thing, as there are so many choices to pick from. In my opinion, the menu is so extensive that it hints at the fact that they don't specialize in any type of food. My girlfriend and I had their sliders and pizza, figuring they were simple enough items that the cheesecake factory couldn't possibly screw them up. I was wrong. The meat in the first (of 4)sliders I picked up, barely filled half the one and a half inch bun, and looked and tasted like it was literally heated up in a microwave and then thrown into the bun with absolutely no care at all by the cooks. The other 3 were not much to write home about, being mainly greasy and lacking taste. The ""everything"" pizza came out and was even worse. Not only was it barely room temperature when it came to the table, but was created in such a way that it literally looked like a 2 year old had taken the ingredients and thrown it randomly on the pizza. The taste was not enjoyable, and was definitely not worth the money spent. The food ordered by our friends at the table was similarly disappointing and all agreed was overpriced for the quality. The strawberry cheesecake was the only part of the meal that was actually enjoyable. In conclusion, I do not plan on returning to the Cheesecake factory again for anything other than Cheesecake; and do not recommend to anyone who is looking a good meal. Perhaps the factory could cut down its menu, and actually specialize in a certain type of food instead of specializing in offering a large menu of low quality food."
M H.,"CO, CO",4,31,,3.0,7/25/2011,"I've been to this location multiple times and have never had a bad experience...until my last visit.   It was about 9pm on a Friday so it was busy. There was about a 15 minute wait. The bread was rock hard. We ordered what we usually order but it was not the same. The calamari was chewy and my hubby swore he bit into something that tasted like plastic. We ordered a pasta to share and my son ordered his own pasta. Well they brought them out together and as soon as they went to hand us ours we realized that is not what we ordered. So the girl took it back and few minutes go by and our waiter says ""im sorry i know you said you wanted the louisanna but i wrote down chipotle."" As he was apologizing what appeared to be a manager tried to bring us back the same WRONG dish. So our waiter told him that it wasnt right, so he takes it back again. Another ten minutes go by before we get the right meal and my son is just about finished with his. Having ordered appitzers, drinks and dessert you'd think hey maybe they'd discount the meal they messed up? No, of course not I'm paying full price when i just ate rock hard bread, chewy calamari and my pasta dish after my son was finished. Obviously I'm disappointed, this place usually is top notch."
