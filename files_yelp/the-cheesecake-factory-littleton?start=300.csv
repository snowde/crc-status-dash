Andee H.,"Brighton, CO",260,320,36,3.0,7/18/2008,"I have mixed feeling about the CCF.  On one hand I like to get a good sized portion of food. After all I do enjoy eating, but the portions here are grown up sizes on crack.  There is really no need for THAT much food unless you are a homeless person who saved up all there days ""salary"" to buy a meal that could last you all week. The cheesecake is good, but I always suggest getting it to go. After eating half my meal there isn't too much room left for dessert."
Caitie M.,"Englewood, CO",0,13,,1.0,10/6/2013,"My sister and I ordered 2 side salads and nachos. Our salads came out quickly, and we ate them. 20 min. Later, our nachos still hasn't come out. Our waitress said they burned the first order. 10 min later we still didn't have them. At that point we had to leave bc we had somewhere to be. We couldn't find our waiter, so we went to the bar to have them remove the nachos from our bill. She went to get the manager. The manager was standing right next to us and never apologized or even acknowledged us for that matter. We left hungry and upset. What ever happened to customer service??? When I used to work in the restaurant industry, we would do our best to try and make sure the customer came back especially if we messed something up."
Julio P.,"Miami, FL",8,29,6,5.0,3/28/2010,The quality of the food is great and consistent. The seating is somewhat cramped and on busy days its hard to get good service. The chicken and biscuits is great and the portions are generous. The restaurant is located by the parking lot and easy to find good parking. You will not be disappointed by this restaurant
Ben W.,"Aurora, CO",0,1,,3.0,7/5/2013,"Everyone knows this chain has good desserts, and the prices are not too bad. At this particular location, service has become a low priority. The overwhelming majority of the staff are very young and poorly trained. The weird hair, tattoos, etc, are just part of being at the mall, but the atmosphere of ignoring customers is irritating. I've seen it on 2 visits in the last month. You have to interrupt someone to get on the waiting list, or to order something to go, etc. At the first visit, we waited 30 minutes for a table one evening even though we could see 4 or 5 empty tables at times. The second time, I went in to preorder a cheesecake for my upcoming anniversary. They took all my information, etc, arranging that I would pick it up about 5 pm in 2 days, and have an anniversary message on a piece of chocolate (they don't put messages on the cake itself I was told). When I came to pick it up, they had apparently done little or nothing to get it ready. I had to wait while they got a pre made cake from the freezer, frosted it, put on the topping, etc. Oh, and no chocolate, or message. So, what was the purpose of ordering it ahead of time? This took so long I didn't ask questions but paid and left. The entertainment, while I waited for 20 minutes, was watching 2 cashiers trying to reconcile the cash drawer. They couldn't agree on the total, and would count it out again. Each time, they counted a ten dollar bill as a twenty. My hint was ignored or too subtle. They had to get a third person (adult, probably supervisor) to break the tie. Another negative factor in my mind is the incredible noise level - not just conversations, but banging dishes, etc. So on balance, I will only rarely be at this establishment, but the food is very good usually."
Ben S.,"Palo Alto, CA",47,113,52,5.0,7/1/2007,"OK, I admit, I'm biased.. call it full disclosure or call it just fandom, but I'm a huge TCF fan (The Cheesecake Factory).  I've been a huge fan since the early 1990s, when I first tried it in Beverly Hills, CA. I do own the stock (ticker = CAKE, how cool is that!?) and blog about all the ones I've been (count is now 15) -  But once you get past my personal love of this place, it's hard to dispute that it's a great eatery.  The selection is as extensive as you could find, the portions are big (but many items available in 1/2 portions around lunch), the drinks are excellent, and yes, the dessert is something special. I don't even go just for the cheesecake!  I and my family love the menu: the salads, the appetizers, the delicious passion fruit iced tea, and my personal favorite, thai chicken pasta! The service is generally very good and for a chain, this is one of the better run ones.  They don't do reservations and are often full, so you may need to take a pager and wait.  My tip is to go an early lunch and beat the crowd."
Joseph A.,"Littleton, CO",4,16,,4.0,8/19/2013,"My girlfriend and I went there last Saturday night.  When we got there, it was a 40 minute wait for a table.  We went to the bar to grab some drinks and decided to stay there.  40 minute wait turned into a 2 minute wait.  The two bartenders, Dorian and Eric, were two of the most professional and social bartenders I have ever encountered.  They made the bar experience very enjoyable.  The food and cheesecake, as always, were good.  This visit reminded me of how professional everything is here."
Erin J.,"Denver, CO",61,380,20,4.0,2/1/2010,"so the cheesecake alone is worth the 4 stars, but the food really is good.  i'm a fan of the lunch portion menu - which is still way more than enough food. the santa fe chicken salad is ridiculous and my usual go-to menu item. this last visit i had the chicken picatta. it was good. not mind blowingly excellent, but good."
Danna S.,"Denver, CO",0,50,,2.0,2/17/2010,A bunch of us met  for an early lunch last weekend  to catch up with the latest going on's. The CF has so many items on their menu that dinning with a large group allows you to  see/taste a larger selection without multiple trips.  My cobb salad was generous in portion  and tasted fine but I don't think I would reorder. (Champs has the best Cobb in Denver ).  The Chinese Chicken entree is a real winner - skip the Chinese chicken salad as they are completely different.  Sure the sodas are all you can drink but at $4 for lemonade I opted for the healthy water alternative.  Service was pretty good and the conversation was engaging.  Not my pick for the next gathering and an expensive locale for those that don't crave their $7 per slice cheesecake.
Trish T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,27,1,4.0,10/6/2012,"The food was delicious.  I ordered the lettuce wraps (asian style) for an appetizer, a combo shrimp and salmon entree and the banana creme cheesecake for dessert.  No complaints on the prices.  I've noticed that they recently have options for smaller and healthier appetizers and entrees.  Although I think ""smaller"" is just right for me.  My ONLY complaint is the way they try to stuff as many people as possible in that stretch of small tables.  My boyfriend and I had a tough time enjoying our dinner and conversation because 5 minutes after we were seated, the hostess seated a group of loud teenage girls who were having a great time and couldnt stop talking. They were (no kidding) about a foot away from us.  It was on a weekday night, with PLENTY of open tables and booths around the restaurant. I wish the hostess could have been a little more considerate and rotated to another server's section also because our waiter ended up having two tables to serve right after another. Next time, we will request a booth."
Al P.,"Aurora, CO",9,14,51,4.0,10/6/2010,You have to try their new Vietnamese tacos. Excellent starter. You know it is good when your love it too. :-)
Seth J.,"Denver, CO",450,149,4,4.0,6/6/2010,Love that there's a huge variety of food choices. The big portions are great and easy to share. I've never had something I didn't like. The atmosphere is great and the servers are all fantastic. We even got free dessert one time when the wait was too long. And oh the desserts. The cheesecake is great as one would expect. Try the apple dumpling a la mode if you get a chance. Mmmmmmm.
Mira S.,"Littleton, CO",19,184,4,4.0,3/3/2010,"Cheesecake Factory has great Chicken Madeira dish which is one of their most popular dishes (comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus, white-meat chicken tenderloins well seasoned, mushroom sauce). Great cheesecakes, my personal favorite are Tiramisu Cheesecake and White Chocolate Raspberry. Although because they serve so much food (their portions are very large) plus basket of tasty bread to start with, I rarely have room for desert."
Heather H.,"Denver, CO",0,14,,5.0,7/31/2014,favorite restaurant of alllll time! the lemon chicken piccata and the bbq ranch chicken salad...nothing like them! absolutely recommend this place to anyone! great clean place with a smiling happy staff!
Ambra V.,"La Jolla, CA",3,11,,5.0,12/2/2009,"I have eaten here several times, and I have never been disappointed.  All the servers have tried most of the entrees, so they are able to give their opinion and can give great suggestions.  The service is great and the food has always been great.  The sandwiches are excellent and the portions are huge.  The Louisiana pasta dish is to die for and the cheesecake ain't so bad either.  For a chain restaurant that is moderately priced, you cannot go wrong here."
Amy H.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,2,,1.0,1/27/2013,"My daughter and her friends went to this restaurant before their winter formal.  It was an all girl group.  They got there at 5pm and were told they would be seated in an hour and fifteen minutes.  Over two hours later they were finally seated.  They had to rush through dinner to make it to the formal on time.  When they got the bill, my daughter's $13 pasta dish mysteriously cost $21, which is too much even counting tax and gratuity (she did not order a drink).  She said that they couldn't take the time to fight it because they were running so late.  One girl was shorted on her change and told by the server that the restaurant had run out of change.  Quite honestly, this restaurant took advantage of these kids and provided outrageously bad and even dishonest service.  I will never go to this restaurant again and I'm quite sure none of these girls or their families will either."
Betty B.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",0,113,,5.0,7/12/2012,"The Georgia peach drinks is wonderful. The fish tacos rock, best ever, so much flavor. And the stephanys red velvet cheesecake.....omg!"
Sarah M.,"Denver, CO",258,260,22,2.0,4/7/2009,"-Our server was really for lack of a better word corporatized.... very much like a drone.  One of many reasons I dislike corporate chains... I also think that an all white outfit is awful!  IT LOOKS HORRIBLE!  Everyone's uniform was dirty! The menu is way to freaking big... and the tackiest thing in the world is the ads throughout the menu.  It was distracting! Our small plates were good, not great.  Our food.... seriously.... Way to big... Ray got a double cheeseburger with onion rings and BBQ sauce. IT was RIDICULOUS! 3 slices of bread raw onions (which were actually horrible and contained an entire layer of the rubbery skin) onion rings 2 large patties, 2 pieces of thick, thick cheese and fixings... It stood a foot high! How the heck can you possibly eat that??   My shrimp and bacon club was equally ridiculous! 3 pieces of bread and two different kinds of mayo like sauces.... they both were horrible. My friend club was ridiculous as well!  It was stacked up just as tall as the cheeseburger.   I think the quality of food is much more important than the size... This is one of those places where I would love to see the calorie count...especially on the burger. The cheesecake is of course amazing...  I like the option to sub out the side of French Fries without charge.   I did not love my meal at all I love dining with friends.  I enjoyed that.  And the music playing is good!!   I will probably just come in for dessert next time... if there is a next time..."
Wende C.,"Littleton, CO",0,17,,1.0,4/18/2014,"We went to the Cheesecake Factory for my daughters birthday last week. 3 members of our party got food poisoning. I called the restaurant to notify them and the manager basically responded that they had served 1000 people the night before and it was impossible that we got sick because of their food. I have worked in corporate American for 25 years, first of all it is possible and it is what happened to be food poisoning was confirmed by our doctor. Secondly, the manager said he would call back after investigating and he didn't. Third of all, it could be a health hazard for other customers and should have been taken seriously. After reading other yelp posts about the lack of cleanliness, I am not surprised we got sick. So beware, we got 3 seafood type dishes.  I would avoid this restaurant but if you do go avoid any seafood dishes. And to the manager that didn't take my call seriously, some customers will go the extra mile to let others know when they have a bad experience because we care about other people and do not want the same thing happening to them."
Jules M.,"Denver, CO",0,9,,5.0,10/15/2012,"If you are at Park Meadows during lunch time Tuesday-Saturday, head to the Cheesecake Factory, sit at the bar, and let Darren take excellent care of you.  I am a pain in the neck when it comes to food due to allergies and sensitivities and they accommodate me without batting an eye.  When you have food allergies eating out can be scary, but I have eaten there at least once a week for the past year and have NEVER, EVER had a problem! Darren is a sweetheart and treats his customers like gold.  Head on down, you won't be sorry!"
Maria H.,"Aurora, CO",0,23,,3.0,4/5/2012,"The appetizers were great. I had ordered a veggie burger and it was not so tasty as I was hoping for, for the price that I was paying for it. Their dessert is great. Drinks are yummy. Just the burger that ruined it for me. A little pricey for what they have to offer."
