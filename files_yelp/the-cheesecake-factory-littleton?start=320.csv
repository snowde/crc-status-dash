Nicole M.,"Denver, CO",103,151,7,4.0,6/1/2011,"Yum, Yumm, Yummy!  I forgot how good this place is!!  I sometimes will pass it up as I think it's too pricey but as we had a gift card we figured we'd give it a go.  First off, it's not nearly as pricey as I thought it was and for the amount of food they give you it's well worth the menu prices!  The atmosphere is nice, even though it's attached to the mall.  Our waiter, Matt, was helpful and attentive even though it was a quite busy evening.  The menu is large so go with your gut or ask your waiter/waitress to recommend - they actually have had the food and do know a thing or two!  My boyfriend got a house salad to start, which was a fresh bed of mixed greens and huge so we split it.  For our entrees he opted for the buffalo chicken sandwich w/ fries and I got the Tomato basil pasta.  We couldn't believe our eyes when our plates came!  His sandwich was ENORMOUS and the breading they use was perfectly crisp.  My pasta was amazing as well.  We both ended up taking leftovers home to be had the next day - reheated it was still damn good!  Oh and I forgot how much I love their brown bread that they give you.  I DEF won't be passing this place up too much in the future.  Too bad with all that yummy food we didn't even have room for cheesecake or the strawberry shortcake the couple next to us had  that I drooled over as we left!"

They went above and beyond, even brought out warm water for my 6 month old five stars you deserve six. f.y.i we did tip over 20% as we always do when it is deserved."
Andrew N.,"Arapahoe, CO",0,27,,5.0,10/19/2009,"My wife and I eat here at least two times a month. The only drawback is knowing when to go when you will not have to wait forever or it is packed with kids. But, we only have had one problem in the last ten visits, and the problem was resolved. The food is great, large portions, at least two meals worth. We ate at the bar the last time we went and the bartender was the best waiter we have ever had there. People rave on the cheesecake, and it is good, but we love their chocolate fudge cake."
R T.,"Denver, CO",0,57,5,4.0,5/29/2011,"I ate here a couple weeks ago, for dinner. My first time. They are very good. Service was excellent. Food portions are large. They tell you the food portions will be large, and they were correct.  They have a very large menu too, with a little of everything. My wife and I felt they are a little expensive, but they are good and we enjoyed eating there. It is a great looking place. Plenty of noise in the restaurant. I ordered a blackened chicken sandwich which was very good and quite large.  My wife ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich which she said she loved.  We will go there again when, if ever, we are not worried too much about the calorie count.  We've been told a lot of people order side dishes and share. This definitely could be a good place for sharing. We enjoyed it."
Rampage J.,"Redmond, WA",0,19,2,4.0,5/28/2011,"Great place, expensive food and long wait times. They have reduced the quantity of food, in the past there was always stuff left to pack."
Sarah V.,"Englewood, CO",0,79,,5.0,4/22/2011,"This place is always packed, especially on the weekends. Despite this, their service is impeccable and the food is fairly delicious. I highly recommend the Mahi Mahi and you just CANNOT leave The Cheesecake Factory without an order of cheesecake a la mode!"
