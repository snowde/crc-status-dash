Louisa W.,"Castle Rock, CO",34,22,1,2.0,12/2/2017,"My last visit here was not that great. My daughter and I had dinner here last night and we were disappointed. Our waitress was nice but forgot things we asked for just seconds before and brought items to guests who had come in well after us, before us. No biggie, nothing like getting bread 30 seconds before your dinner shows up. We both ordered taco dishes and we both got hard, crunchy rice. When we told our waitress, she went to the kitchen to get us fresh rice but came back to tell us that the white, brown and cilantro rice were all undercooked and would take some time. By now we were nearly finished eating. Nothing like black beans all by themselves. A manager came over and addressed the problem by offering us rice to go since, by that time, we were long finished with our plates. Seriously? Sure, give me a vat of rice to take home, that makes my current meal much better. I have worked in restaurants my whole life and this situation would have called for some sort of comp, a dessert, our sodas, something, not the offer of rice after the fact. You have to leave your customers feeling satisfied with their experience at your establishment, not whit a negative, lacking feeling. This doesn't warrant a return visit. This doesn't matter to this particular Cheesecake Factory though. It will always be busy, no matter what, because of the location. There will always be hungry people at the mall wanting to sit down at a familiar place. All of these negative reviews I am seeing don't matter one bit to the management. Look at all of the insincere, copied and pasted replies from them here on Yelp. I'm so looking forward to mine."
Britt C.,"Aurora, CO",0,37,,2.0,3/10/2017,"For the quality of food and service this place is just not worth the wait (on weekend) or price. Service was painfully slow and seemed chaotic even though they appeared to be well staffed. Our bread was hard as rock, macaroni and cheese balls were cold, and our entrees didnt come out right. The burger my husband ordered well was medium rare at best, and the sauce was vile, and the fries were cold. We ordered salads that for some reason came out literally 3 or 4 minutes before the entrees. Our drinks werent refilled until we were done eating and my son ordered his pizza half peperoni but the whole thing was peperoni.  We ordered cheescake to go and 2 of the 3 were tipped over and our slices were small for 8 bucks. Definately smaller than they used to be. What a bummer! I mentioned these things to our waitress and she said sorry but didnt actually do much to fix it- except she did have my husbands burger cooked longer- but all the other issues werent addressed. A manager didnt come by either even though we were so disappointed with every course of our meal. I dont reccommend."
Madison M.,"Denver, CO",102,206,254,3.0,9/24/2016,"Overall this is your standard cheesecake factory experience. The staff are friendly, the menu is massive, and the portions are very large. I think the best time to go in here is around 11 AM if it's a weekend or else you'll be waiting 20 to 30 minutes to get seated during the lunch rushwhich seems to happen between 1130 AM and 2 PM, Especially on the weekends. Your best bet when ordering is to do one of the lunch specials, The portions are so large you can actually split it with someone. The ice tea is always a good bet and who doesn't like free bread? If your kids bring in American girl dolls you can get a special high chair for the doll that they will put at the table with you. It's a nice touch and shows that they definitely understand their market. Overall, the food is consistent at this cheesecake factory just like it is it every other cheesecake factory across the nation. The staff are friendly but the restaurant is so large it's easy to get lost and you may not see your waiter as often as you like."
Tom S.,"Evergreen, CO",0,7,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Cockroach Factory? We just ate here and the food is generally very good HOWEVER, as we were waiting for our check, we were visited at our table by a passing cockroach. Dead seriously, I asked my wife ""what is that?"" She responded ""what you think it is"". We warned the folks seated behind us as the roach crawled past their kid's head along the wall. I notified the server and the apologetic manager HOWEVER, we are done here. Tableside Roaches!"
Anthony G.,"Aurora, CO",3,9,11,3.0,4/30/2017,"I was a little disappointed with this place in the beginning. The wait time was only 30 minutes for a party of two, that wasn't bad. They called my name and told me to step to the side and my host would be right with me. Me and my fiance had to wait almost 20 minutes before we even got seated. They forgot to call my name and just threw it away. We finally got seated and I order a old fashion, let's just say it was very disappointing, but my second drink was a whiskey sour and I must say it was amazing. I order a ribeye steak, green beans, and French fries. The ribeyes was the only thing good, green beans should have been cooked a little longer, and the fries were not seasoned at all."
Heidi K.,"Aurora, CO",7,145,33,5.0,3/6/2017,"We just celebrated our oldest daughter's 15th birthday and the service and experience were stellar! BJ was our server and he was so kind and very good. Kept our glasses full and offered my daughter an amazing custom hot fudge sundae with some.singing too! All four meals, appetizer and desserts were A+! We've been to CF several times before, this one and many other locations. This was one of the best!"
Ray K.,"Lone Tree, CO",5,209,414,4.0,8/18/2016,Very nice setting for a casual dinner. I had the country omelette with potatoes and bacon. Others ordered the chicken with lemon couscous which looked really good. We had a firecracker salmon appetizer which is unique and really good with a soy based sauce.
T W.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",11,81,9,3.0,8/4/2017,The Waite time is the worst I would give them 5 stars if they told the truth about Wait time and if we had a good server our food is  always good  but they obviously are so busy they dot care about Loyal customers
McKayla P.,"Medford, MN",1,33,1,5.0,8/31/2017,"I loved my visit to this Cheesecake Factory this week. Tiffany was the most pleasant and attentive server. I came for lunch and had the Firecracker Salmon Rolls as an appetizer. I'm definitely a fan now!! My drink was never empty, and I didn't have to flag Tiffany down once for something I didn't have. She made sure everything was in order, even though I could clearly see she was running around busy. I had a wonderful lunch break from work, and a great meal before heading to the airport:)"
Steve W.,"Aurora, CO",0,21,,2.0,8/7/2017,"Always a favorite of our family with great service, menu, and quality.  Except last week.  Our server was great, our food took nearly an hour to arrive for lunch, the spaghetti and meat balls was cold , noodles were hard n crunchy.  Ordered a Kobe beef burger which they were OUT of so switched to a different burger.  It arrived cold, 50% the size it should be.  It was so awful I took a picture of it.  Asked for manager, Steve.  Steve gave the usual I am sorry yodel. Not impressed with Steve or the food.  Server received 30% tip."
Amy E.,"Englewood, CO",32,3,,4.0,6/26/2017,"Lauren was our server and she was amazing! She was extremely accommodating, had great food suggestions and a great sense of humor. The food was good but the service is really what made it a great experience.  Thank you Lauren!"
Linda B.,"Monument, CO",0,2,3,1.0,3/19/2017,"Visited Saturday afternoon waiting for table. Ladies restroom FILTHY & trashed out. There were several diapers on floor as well. Unbelievable dirt!  So if their kitchen was this bad, how can food be safely handled!  We left & found another restaurant close by."
Anne M.,"Parker, CO",0,21,,5.0,10/18/2017,"Another one of my favorites.  The food is a bit overpriced, but it does not disappoint.  A friend and I meet for lunch several times a year and we call this ""the usual."""
Walt L.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,41,27,2.0,4/5/2017,"Cheesecake Factory suffers from ho-hum service now. In earlier years, my server would take great care to see that my food arrived as ordered and ensured all my needs were attended to. Tonight, the server delivering our appetizer wasn't sure he had the right table and was unaware of what we ordered. My Orange Chicken main course was just okay. Again, the server wasn't sure he had the correct table or the proper order. My server checked in with me from a distance, answering their own question and moving onto bigger and better things. I would have liked soy sauce to accompany my meal, but no one seemed to care or ask me. My advice, skip the meal and just order cheesecake to go. I'm no longer going to drive up here from the Springs for a meal and cheesecake. Another one bites the dust."
Elisabeth F.,"Littleton, CO",32,2,,1.0,9/18/2016,"We just celebrated my daughters 8th birthday with Sunday brunch and had the worst experience. We had a semi large party of 13. I will start with the single positive and it was our wonderful waitress who was kind and caring and attentive. She wasn't even the normal waitress just the one covering someone's breaks.  Now the meal: they changed the recipe on the monte cristo and it was absolutely inedible. The bread was slimy and undercooked and completely saturated in uncooked egg. The huevos rancheros ordered with eggs over medium the egg whites were not cooked, when sent back they came out a second time not cooked. The eggs Benedict eggs were hard boiled and the French toast was not cooked. The eggs and bacon plate with eggs over medium came out with runny whites of the uncooked eggs. The meal was inedible to say the least. Not a single dish was served even warm everything was cold. Out of 12 dishes not one was hot and 6 were not edible. 7 of us have to eat again now that we have left. The general manager came out swinging telling me the meals were cooked like they always were and never once apologized. I have had brunch here numerous times and later the manager admitted the recipes had changed. The general manager was incredibly rude, short tempered and did not resolve a single issue. Our kind waitress was grossed out at the uncooked eggs but the general manager did not seem concerned in the least. He is the reason we will never dine here again and we will tell all of our friends and family of this experience."
Liz W.,"Lone Tree, CO",11,7,1,5.0,6/18/2017,We always get dessert first we have a a few disappointments with the food but our last visit was great
Robert R.,"Englewood, CO",7,14,2,2.0,8/28/2016,"Been to Cheesecake Factory many times, always disappointed. The food is just ok, nothing is 'great'. The portions are just too big, it makes you feel bad to not finish.  I think my biggest gripe is with the host/hostess stand. They are incapable of making an adjustment or decision on the fly. Not only have they frustrated me, but I witnessed another party walk out because the host couldn't figure out how to seat them in an adjacent table because that section was ""closed"" - the table they wanted to sit at was about 15inches away. Ridiculous! Decided today 8/28/16 they we won't be back."
Danielle F.,"Littleton, CO",113,4,,2.0,9/26/2017,The past two times I ate here the food was incredibly greasy. We didn't order anything fried so the amount of oil on the plate was not normal. Will not be returning except to buy Cheesecake.
Gil S.,"Littleton, CO",3,132,36,2.0,7/17/2016,"Some items on the menu are pretty good but others are just terrible. I don't even remember when was the last time I had to send back a dish, but it happened to me here last week. The manager came over and said he'll have the replacement dish I order ""right out"" but it never came so after a long wait we had to cancel it. Obviously it wasn't on the check but I would have expected some more here. We didn't pay for it because we never got it so we ended up paying in full - no compensation at all and we never saw the manager again after they messed up. This was for my daughter's birthday so I kept cool, did not want to ruin the night for her but I doubt we will ever come back."
Zlatan-mirela V.,"Denver, CO",0,6,,1.0,4/30/2017,"$138 for a dinner for two. $12 Long Island ice tea ,$8 cheese cake ,   $25 chicken Alfredo .  No thanks. Overrated , to expensive,service sucks, 45 min wait for table."
