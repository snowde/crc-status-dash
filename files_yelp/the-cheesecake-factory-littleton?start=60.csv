Jessica N Andrew G.,"Cocoa Beach, FL",19,7,,5.0,5/24/2017,"The place was great! Good food, stellar service. Of course it's pricey, but the food is good. It's worth the money. Our server was incredible. We all had a great time"
David D.,"Centennial, CO",0,1,,1.0,9/15/2017,"Went to CF with my friend on Wednesday and had a very bad experience. Ordered some wine with 2 appetizers to start. Neither appetizer was available but somehow the exact same item as an appetizer was available as an entree. That is ""bait and switch"" which is illegal. Service was substandard and dismissive. Food is average and overpriced for the quantity and quality served. Stay away from CF. There are some great alternatives nearby."
Scott G.,"Denver, CO",0,11,8,3.0,7/13/2016,"I am here right now and this is a horrible experience! They are relatively slow as its 530 on a Wednesday, and it took 12 minutes for our waiter to come to our table... Which is to say we had to flag down one of the three waiters sitting at the station to ask who our person was. Come to find out it's a fourth waiter who is taking the order of the person seated after us. Then we get the kids meals and the plates are Scolding hot and the fruit is nothing more than cocktail garnishes from the bar. Ridiculous, should have went to tap house for their happy hour menu.manager just came by and was very nice so they get another two stars for the effort"
Joanie V.,"Parker, CO",1,158,48,5.0,3/16/2017,"A huge menu. Wow. Gluten-free choices are clearly stated on the menu which is a great help. Scarlet was our waitress and she completely took care of us from start to finish. We could not have been happier. We ordered two salads and asked or salmon to be added to them, she quickly got us a price to make an off menu change. We were served quickly and drinks were refilled frequently and she often checked to see if we needed anything. We sat in the bar and it was an overall great experience. Thank you scarlet!!!!  You made our visit to cheesecake factory excellent!"
Jason S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",36,27,3,5.0,5/6/2017,"So good, the service was excellent our meal and drinks were fantastic and what can I say they lived up to their name, we had the original cheesecake for dessert and it was the best we've ever had! Perfect date night stop!"
Katie-Lynne M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",15,8,2,1.0,8/14/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory location ever. My mom and I were trying to get a simple lunch of sharing two appetizers and a salad, we didn't order anything fancy or an entree. We also ordered iced teas, so we literally ordered the easiest lunch. As we are sitting there chit chatting, I noticed that 45 minutes had gone by without a single waiter or waitress coming over to tell us about our lunch. Our original waitress seemed more attentive to her friends and making jokes than working. When we finally flagged her down, I asked her what was taking so long for two appetizers and a house salad. Her reply was that the kitchen had a long wait time and that she would check on our ticket time. She came back probably five minutes later and told us that on top of the hour we had already wait, it would be another half an hour before we would see any food. We then requested a manager, who after wandering around for another 5 minutes finally came over. We explained the situation and it literally looked like our concerns and frustrations went in one ear and out the other. We will not be going back to this location."
Michael P.,"Aurora, CO",104,389,21,3.0,2/8/2015,"My wife, her grandmother,  and I went to this location on January 31th.  We had lunch and dessert on this occasion. Michael S. was our waiter and he hit out of the park. Giving great recommendations, prompt service for food, and we got everything we could ask for as taste. One recommendation would be for the front of house: the manager and attendant were pushing some people to the front of the line that were local celebrities. It is not a good idea to favor those who waited in line as opposed to those who have been there or have a reservation.  Unlike the local celebrities who did neither.  Could have been a 5 star visit, must knock you 2 stars for that."
Katrina D.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,9,,5.0,4/27/2017,This is one of my favorites. I enjoy there wide selection of food and portions.They get busy so try their curbside pickup it might go swell with a good movie. ;)
Diane B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",25,5,1,2.0,4/2/2017,"I usually like the Cheesecake Factory however, my last visit was disappointing due to the small portion of cheesecake that my friend and I received.  We chose to share a slice because we figured it would be a waste to order 2 separate slices, boy we're we wrong! I also took a slice home for my husband and his was small also! I went there a year ago and the slices were so big that you couldn't eat it all at once. I'm so disappointed that I won't be dining there for a while!"
Steven B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,13,1,3.0,3/31/2017,Great food. A little long of a wait but worth it. Sevice was fair.  I would not go again. The desert was fabulous the Staff toock too long. We were a group of 10 and love the food but service needs improving
Prabha R.,"Englewood, CO",0,2,,1.0,8/4/2017,"I contacted them before arriving at the restaurant and they informed me that the wait time would be 20 minutes for 8 people. However, we were told that the wait time would be more than an hour. Very poor service. We have decided to go to another restaurant. No apologies from the staff and they were like deers facing the headlight. We had a three year old kid and two more children. We will never go back to this restaurant."
Lily S.,"Denver, CO",146,622,3464,3.0,8/22/2014,"We always seem to run into little problems at this location. First time a few years back (before I started using Yelp!) we dined inside and encountered the dirtiest plate in my life. Oh it looked fine on the surface, but seemed to be unsteady so I turned it a round and a big old chunk of leftover dried-up cheese was stuck on the bottom!!! Ewww gross. How could they miss that? Makes you wonder there's no QA person in charge of sanitation or even food quality in this establishment? This time around, we got sat outside (didn't even ask if we were OK with that, I always prefer inside) and were served with perhaps one of the slowest servers (albeit nice and friendly). Of course I looked really carefully at our dining ware and there we go again, both of my forks (why is it always me?!?) had crumbs stuck to the tines. Sigh. (while we got free appetizer and dessert last time, they did not even apologize for the dirty forks this time, maybe they're used to it, it happens on a daily basis kind of thing). There's nothing I can complain about the food. The Cheesecake Factory has consistently good tasting offerings, and I've gotta give it to their chef and management for great creations. Sorry the staff at this location is sloppy and is giving off a bad impression. By the way, it was my birthday that day and instead of a free Sundae (I've read online several people have received that) all I got was a candle and a Happy Birthday message on my cheesecake plate (what if I hadn't ordered cheesecake?!?). I felt sorry that I chose this place to celebrate my special day. Not to mention we had to wait like 15 minutes for the cheesecakes and I swear they started to melt a little already. The whole dining experience has put us in a worse mood that day and I really did not appreciate it!"
Kumar U.,"Lone Tree, CO",2,7,,4.0,10/16/2016,"Ambiance - Excellent decor and ambiance Service - Excellent service, I ordered a beer and it wasn't chilled enough, it was swiftly replaced. Food - Buffalo blasts was delicious, highly recommended. Pizza was nice too. Drinks - Not that extensive menu"
Lillian D.,"Littleton, CO",0,8,1,2.0,8/13/2017,"Wow honestly I was rather disappointed with the service. First when we came in to put our name on the waiting list, the hostess wasn't very friendly at all. Besides that when we finally got a table, we were not greeted by a waitress till about 10 minutes in and we didn't even get our waters till then. The food took forever to come out, most of my friends just ordered cheesecake, but a couple of us actually ordered food. It took about 45-1 hour to come out. And the lady who brought out our food said the calamari would come out in 2 minutes, 15 minutes later we had to remind our waitress who forgot. The food was pretty good. And the strawberry shortcake was very good. But it just took forever and people were not too friendly, I probably won't ever return to this location."
Sam T.,"Castle Rock, CO",1,23,2,3.0,2/7/2017,"The food is always good, and nobody makes better cheesecake.  Staff service is excellent as well.   It is by far the best restaurant at Park Meadows Mall IMHO.   Its $10 more a person to eat here than most other regular places you might find...and its worth the $10. That said, I constantly have to remind myself that I should consider going to the next tier for a special event, like Ruth's Chris, Del Frisco, or Texas de Brazil.   Each of these places is $10 more on average for a head....and its worth the $10."
Anne A.,"Denver, CO",0,21,6,1.0,4/20/2016,Terrible terrible terrible. Received a burger with two slices of ice cold cheese and mashed potatoes that weren't even room temperature.
Kathy W.,"Denver, CO",1,3,,2.0,8/8/2017,"Not one of my better experiences at Cheesecake Factory.  Slow service, salad with hardly any dressing. My lunch had to be made over because it ""dried out"" under the heat lamp because it sat there too long.  For the money they charge I expect better.  Won't be back anytime soon."
Rick C.,"Castle Rock, CO",0,13,3,1.0,7/22/2017,"Ordinarily my family and I are big fans of The Cheesecake Factory; however, our recent experience at this particular location was disappointing.  One of the members of our party ordered the filet mignon (medium well) and the steak came out rare to medium rare.  Not a huge deal as that can happen occasionally, but our server did mention it happens entirely too often at their restaurant. However, when the steak came back out (still medium rare) the Manager (Nichelle) informed us that if we want cooked better, we should order the Medallions next time. No apology, nor did they offer to take care of it.  Instead, they just implied we should order something different next time.  If you are going to have a $30 filet on the menu, at least teach your kitchen how to properly prepare it.  Nichelle is clearly incompetent if she thinks this is the proper way to handle the situation.  Hire better shift managers Cheesecake!"
Honest O.,"Denver, CO",0,40,,1.0,4/9/2016,"I use to love, but no more. My family ate here at least 2-3 times a month in the past. I went here for the last time a few weeks ago. Bad service, cold food, sloppy presentation, and worst of all, my waitress was clueless. I asked to have my food boxed up to take home, and she picked up my plate and sat it on a stack of dirty dishes from another table. YUCK! Needless to say, I didn't eat that.  Also, one of the last times I was here the hostess forgot us! We waited over an hour for a table and watched people who checked in After us, be seated before us. When we asked the hostess, she insisted we had just checked in 20 mins prior.... And she was rude! So disappointing.... I use to love this place! BUT NO MORE. It's amazing how much a manager can do, or not do.  This place is going downhill......."
Vanessa C.,"Lone Tree, CO",75,83,229,1.0,7/22/2015,"I went here with my sister, my 3 young kids, and a friend of ours who was visiting from out of state. Service was absolutely slow for a place that wasn't particularly busy on a weekday afternoon. We had to ask for their complimentary bread twice for my more than hungry kids because of the long wait to order and receive our food. They didn't even offer it the first time around like most Cheesecake Factory(s) would do after placing a drink order.  Our friend's salmon was dry as my shrimp tacos tasted extremely plain. I felt like I was eating a flavorless salad with random bits of unseasoned shrimp. My children shared a chicken pasta dish with my sister (I forgot what their dish was but it had lots of cheese), which they all seem to enjoy besides the chicken that my sister said the pasta itself can do without.  The only pro is the portion sizes were large to share with everyone and take home leftovers. I can't say much about our waitress who ended up handing us over to another to go on break. I would probably only come back to get a cheesecake to go. More than two hours of mainly waiting is enough to not bring us back again."
