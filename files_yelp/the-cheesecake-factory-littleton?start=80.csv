Elisa C.,"Aurora, CO",5,39,24,5.0,6/30/2015,"Had a wonderful dinner at the Cheesecake Factory. We visited on a Tuesday night after the usual dinner rush, therefore there was no wait. The hostesses were absolutely great. I've never been welcomed so well into a restaurant. They were very nice and accommodating.  Our server Levi was great. He was super attentive and had thorough knowledge of the menu (as tough as that seems!) and offered to us his favorite dishes as well as check up on us a consistent but not pushy amount of times. The food was spectacular. The chicken was perfectly grilled, veggies nice and crisp, and the mashed potatoes were heavenly.  The cheesecake, dulce de leche and a recommendation by Levi, really hit the spot! Would definitely recommend after a long day of shopping :)"
Mike D.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,3,,1.0,12/31/2016,"Used to be good. Total conveyor belt service. Wrong orders, cold food, appetizers with salads served on top of them with dinner served on top of that. No room on table for all the plates. I expect this from Olive Garden, not CF. big price tag for poor dining experience.Sad decline...."
Susan S.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",102,40,17,2.0,12/16/2016,Because they allow kids to sit AT THE BAR on a 40 minute wait.  #1 That's ILLEGAL.  #2 40 minute wait!! On a Friday night on December 16th amid Christmas shoppers.  Sheesh!
Heather V.,"Aurora, CO",0,4,7,2.0,2/12/2017,This was my 1st and my last time going to the Cheesecake Factory. Only giving 2 stars because my dish actually tasted good. I had the Asian chicken lettuce wrap/tacos. My husband got an overpriced Philly sandwhich that barely had anything in it and the bread was rock hard and not edible. (He didn't eat the bread) The stuff that was in the sandwhich was bland. The alcoholic beverages were WAY overpriced. I had 2 amerretto sours  which ended up being $10.50 per drink!! My husband had a beer that was $7. The service was just ok at best. After waiting an hour and a half to be seated it was not the best experience.
Missy B.,"San Diego, CA",474,411,844,2.0,5/8/2015,"I typically like the Cheesecake factory with its humongous menu and friendly service. However, this experience was really a bummer.  I was considering ordering the Spicy Cashew Chicken dish. I've had my eye on it for a while and decided to ask our server about it since I was afraid it would be sweet (like most dishes similar to this one are). She assured me that it was not sweet at all but rather, was savory and had a nice spicy kick to it. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, I took my first bite and much to my dismay, it was VERY sweet. Not only was the sauce too sweet, but the rice was not cooked properly and was like a mush under my chicken.  She asked how I liked it and I told her not at all (this was towards the end of our meal, otherwise I would have ordered something else). I told her that the dish is in fact sweet and she said, ""Yeah, it is a little sweet, sorry I didn't tell you that in the beginning."" I'm sorry too, because I asked about it specifically! I think it was just a matter of not knowing the menu item very well. And how could she? There are hundreds of items to learn and remember! She should have at least been honest with me and said she didn't know. And, on top of that, she didn't even make an attempt to remedy the situation. No offer to take it off the bill and no offer to get me something fast to-go. Such a bummer. I don't think I'll ever be back to this location (not necessarily because of this experience but more so because I actually live in San Diego and only visit Colorado Springs once or twice a year) but I thought it was worth sharing since the service was especially lack-luster."
Kelley S.,"Lone Tree, CO",0,1,,1.0,7/24/2017,"I've liked coming here in the past, but this visit will be my last to this location for sure. I got to the restaurant a couple minutes after they opened at 11:00. We ordered a salad and a veggie burger. 45 min later it still hadn't arrived. The waitress stopped by once to say sorry it's taking so long and then refused to even look at us and wouldn't walk by our table after that.  They apparently had a large salad take out order, but we didn't get that message until we called the waitress over, from across the room since she was avoiding the table.  I maybe would have ordered something else if given the chance and the right information. The girl didn't even offer bread or anything.  I finally went up to the front desk to ask for a manager, we wanted to pay for our teas and get out of there.  He walks up and says that he was just coming to talk with us; that his salad station was backed up. ""Well, after waiting for almost an hour and everyone around us getting food, (some of which were salads, but I didn't mention that) we'd like to pay for our teas and we are leaving.""  His charming and professional response was, ""oh, you've got to be kidding!"" I think his name was Tom, but to be honest, I was so mad I was shaky and don't remember for sure. But to Tom, or whatever his name actually was, I say thanks for solidifying my desire to never set foot in your restaurant again. And no, I'm not kidding."
Ram E.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,1.0,1/27/2017,"So every time I go to this Cheesecake Factory it's always busy with no sitting while waiting. It doesn't matter if it's a holiday or not. I actually tried to make reservations, and they said no reservations on Friday, really!  So I wait 30 minutes, only to wait at the table again, then to find out the macaroni cheese balls are not available. Could someone have told me that 46 minutes ago so I could have made an executive decision to go else where?! I do love Cheesecake Factory but this particular store always does something upsetting. The corporate office in Calabasas need to really do an audit on this store to regulate what's going on."
Denise R.,"Aurora, CO",650,491,905,2.0,5/29/2016,Today must have just been a bad day I know that they are busy here at this location however I literally got lettuce tacos with half a piece of lettuce I was literally scooping my toppings on to my place which I had to eat with a fork I told the girl that brought the food to me and she said that's how the letters come sometimes I cannot believe it my cheese casadia I wanted Betty they brought it with chicken however there was nobody to tell everybody was too busy nobody checked on this the entire visit
Pur O.,"Englewood, CO",0,24,,1.0,10/23/2016,This places deserves zero stars and I was completely ripped off. Had a to- go order today and it was a mess. I live on a limited budget and am elderly so this was supposed to be a treat and was going to have two meals from it. The asparagus was not oncluded with the chicken costeleta and the food was horrible. As I was trying to eat it I found a hair under the chicken. Gross! Even the bread was not edible because it was old and just crumbled.....you should be ashamed of this service and AND DO NOT DIRECT MR TO YOUR WEBSITE AND I WANT THIS ADDRESSED NOW!
Eric B.,"El Paso, TX",57,91,91,2.0,11/11/2016,"This was my 1st time at the Cheesecake factory. I was not impressed.  For our 100 dollar bill we received our food at separate times, food that was mediocre and over priced drinks. My wife was finished with her meal before I even got mine and when I did get mine it was over cooked. The waiter was nice but that did not make up for the quality of the food or servie."
Ed G.,"Littleton, CO",33,178,6,3.0,3/16/2016,When I leave a review I take ALL factors into consideration. Price service quality of food and truthfulness. Every time I come her I am continually disappointed. Today I got a skinny something turkey bacon sandwich. A glorified slider. I had fries instead of salad. Took over 20 minutes and I was told they were waiting on the fries. I think they were waiting for them to get cold and rubbery. The servers was charming hence the generous 3 stars. Will I ever learn...
Jason L.,"Denver, CO",4,11,,2.0,6/4/2017,I think someone spit on my bread when my kids asked for some.  We probably just had a bad sever
Jeffrey W.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,5,,1.0,7/15/2017,Came here with entire family for dinner & was told to wait five minutes to see what the actual wait time would be. Pager didn't go off so checked with them only to be told it would be a two hour wait. Why couldn't they say that from the beginning?
Morgan M.,"Denver, CO",182,251,2071,4.0,6/21/2015,Cheesecake Factory is a great family meal place for many occasions. The menu is literally a book with meal options for all different types. So many choices you can't go wrong !!! The food is excellent !! Portions are huge !! Yet the service is very slow ! It will take a good amount of time to get your food . Defiantly recommend as a fun place to eat though !
Kelly S.,"Aurora, CO",80,202,371,3.0,8/19/2016,"In the past this Cheesecake Factory has always been a great place for me to dine with my family or friends. I've never had to wait long, even on weekends, and my servers have always been friendly. This last visit left me a little disappointed. The restaurant does not take reservations, so obviously they seat their tables on a first come first serve basis. I arrived for a bridal shower at 6 o'clock for dinner at 6:30 on a Sunday evening. The sister of the bride had arrived early at 5pm to the restaurant to reserve a table for 10 women. They told her that the wait would be about 45 minutes. No problem, we would have a table by 6. Come 6:45 and then they tell us that our wait has extended to 45 more minutes. We waited 2 hours for a table we never got to sit at. So then we all decide to order carry out. We all order and we got our food within 25 minutes. How does that work?? I ordered the Asian chicken salad. The chicken was good and generously portioned but the lettuce was a little floppy. All in all this was a disappointing experience. There are so many restaurants at Park Meadows who want my business more than the Cheesecake Factory."
Ann H.,"Littleton, CO",0,8,,5.0,6/21/2017,"I had a wonderful experience at this Cheesecake Factory 2 days ago for a Monday lunch.  The bread came fresh and delicious.  Our sliders were great and the French fries were hot and tasty.  Our cheesecake was excellent.  Our server, Elizabeth, was efficient, gracious and helpful.  I will gladly return to this restaurant!"
Shannon P.,"Glenrock, WY",81,133,451,4.0,4/16/2016,We always get great service when we come here food has always been great love there pasta and shrimp dish along with there everything pizza
Jenny G.,"Aurora, CO",10,47,4,1.0,7/10/2016,"I live in Colorado Springs. Lucky form me my husband knowsI love cheesecake. He took me here for our 12 year wedding anniversary. We set a reservation for 5:15 PM on July 9th 2016 with Mike. When we came in it was not there so we had to wait. The wait was supposed to be 15 to 20 min. We were not called after thirty min so we double checked. A young host took our pager away and stated you are in my next four. After being skipped by seven more groupings. My husband went up again. The same young host, had the nerve to ask where my pager was. I looked him directly in the eyes and said, did you not take it away 15 minutes ago? He did not recall. I then asked why our reservation was lost, why no one had paid attention to the list of names as we put our name on it at 5:10 pm it was now almost six. He asks if we wanted a manager. However, he never got one to us. I eventually located one and was seated 5 minutes later. After all that, I was provided a complementary appetizer... But the servers who served us changed twice. She was not an able to provide napkins for wings. The plates sat and sat on the table, no bread refill . The mustard for the club was not provided. Fries with both sandwiches were over salted and cold.  I had to speak up to order desert. We also had dirty silverware. I guess it was a good thing we had finger food. I felt so badly treated and so frustrated, that I just wanted the bill.  The manager should have checked back in my opinion. However, that opportunity was missed."
Brad n.,"Elgin, IL",19,213,59,5.0,5/23/2015,"Yes it is just like other Cheesecake Factories, but thanks to Nate or waitress we had a wonderful experience.    There were three of us that include my wife, myself, and our 2yr old. Nate was great to offer good recommendations (Chicken Bellagio, awesome!). She was very attentive with our order, drinks, desert, and check. Overall she is the reason for the five stars, oh, and the food too. Thank you Nate."
Karyn K.,"Littleton, CO",6,3,,5.0,12/5/2016,"I had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at Southwest Plaza in Littleton, Colorado last night.  I indulged in the Chicken with couscous and lemon sauce, there are not enough words to describe how delicious this meal was and the left overs tonight were just as goodTo top it all off the service was exceptional even though we arrived late to a very busy restaurant. From the hostess to our waitress to the lady who serviced us they were as delightful as the meal. Bravo to all of you and many thanks for a wonderful eveningMerry Christmas you are on Santas very nice list"
