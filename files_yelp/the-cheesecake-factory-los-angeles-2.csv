Rita W.,"Rockville, MD",528,337,1552,4.0,10/1/2012,"Did this location close already? I don't see it listed on their website, and no one answered the phone number listed. I saw that there was a recent review, so I went to check it out, and the sign is gone... SOOO SAD! I couldn't use my $25 cheesecake factory gift card... *sigh* Anyways, this place gave me good memories during my college days.  I tried nearly all the cheeescakes on menu, and I've definitely picked out some favorites. I am glad that they still have their red velvet cheesecake on menu, especially since I thought it was just a seasonal thing.  Their salads are good, but their chicken picatta was super gross.  I loved their cheesecakes. Byebye, this location... I guess I'll have to drive a few more hours in traffic for the next closest location by the west side: Beverly Center.  UGH!"
Ken S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1013,278,551,4.0,2/9/2012,"I come here quite often because I live in the neighborhood.  This is one restaurant that I can always count on.   Their service is great, the restaurant has a big layout with beautiful outdoor seating with a water fountain in the middle. Food is always delicious weather you order a pasta, steak, thai dish, or mexican dish.  Everything is always quality."
Alan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",506,1367,207,3.0,7/2/2012,"A friend had chosen this Cheesecake Factory for lunch. This location is in dire need of a remodel. Anyhow, there is validated valet parking in the underground garage. The entrance is on San Vicente Boulevard, but the entrance is difficult to see. The parking entrance is west of the restaurant. Validation is for 1 1/2 hours and then I believe it is $2.20 every 15 minutes thereafter.  If you had to eat here, I would suggest eating outside as eating inside reminds of a place your grandma would dine at. Also, these circular booths with the mirrors behind you remind me of a strip club. Our server Brent was really nice and prompt. I feel bad for him because there was this rude customer that was sitting diagonally across from us. I even took a picture of this lady because this lady had the nerve to steal the house bread. She was barking orders to the waiter which was so rude. She was so loud, we could not help hearing her nor laughing at the situation. We even made a joke to our waiter about the lady and he got the joke.  My friend ordered a Santa Fe salad while I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. According to him, his salad was good and I thought my salad was good. After coming to this location, I think I would rather go to the other Cheesecake Factory locations around the Southern California area just because I don't want to feel like I am in a funeral home while eating."
Hannah M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",324,275,101,3.0,7/9/2010,"Cheesecake is cheesecake is cheesecake.. If you have been to one you have been to them all. This one is nice. I like the outdoor seating by the fountain. I have come so many times that I can say the service is average. There have been a few BIG issues but they handled them with comps. (As they should have in these instances!!) Today I called in a pick up order and a woman with the syrupiest voice answered the phone. I can't STAND that uuuuber customer service voice. I did not call a freakin sex line!!! I called a restaurant! For anyone who uses this voice in their job, just know the rest of us CAN'T STAND to hear you. Talk normal! It's insulting to hear the stupid voice. Anyway, I walked in and the guy who had the to-go orders asked me if my name was Hannah. I liked that and the syrup voice girl was no where to be seen so I am happy again. LOL! The menu is so strange. I don't like being marketed to while I am trying to find food. There are also too many options.  You really need to find something you like and keep getting it when you come because not all of the ga-gillion options taste good. Try the stuffed mushroom appetizer, or the avocado egg rolls. They are both good. I also like the dinner Caesar salad with chicken. Overall.. it's good but totally overpriced.  Also, they have validated parking underneath and street parking. (Just make sure you pull into the right lot! There are 2 and you won't be validated at one of them. The sign says ""Cheesecake parking,"" so pay attention or you will have to exit and circle the block to get back."
Noel K.,"Brentwood, CA",141,359,78,2.0,9/2/2010,"Meh. Huge portions of overpriced food.  There is never a visit without an issue.  From food that is supposed to be hot being served cold to picking up a take out order and finding something is missing when you get home. The service has been inconsistent and now we only go once in a blue moon.   I left a pair of Persol's behind which the manager acknowleged...when I went to pick them up they were gone.  My iPhone was left behind and a bus boy tried to keep it...thank goodness I have Mobile Me and was able to tell the manager that even though no one turned my iPhone in, it was at her restaurant according to Google Maps...magically a  bus boy suddenly found it."
Brandon C.,"Pleasanton, CA",57,473,16,1.0,9/5/2011,"Apparently no one is watching this location in the management chain. This is by far the worst CKF experience I've had. Nothing like the usual very buttoned up service, delivery and atmosphere the other locations deliver. The staff was clueless and running around in different directions, often attempting to deliver food to the wrong tables multiple times. Our server appeared to be the only one in the outdoor section and was constantly being flagged down by his tables for forgotten or incorrect items and apologizing for some mistake. The one star is for the tuna salad sandwich that tasted good but needed more tuna.  The bathrooms were also in disrepair and in need of some attention.  Management - you need to visit this place and straighten it up. I won't be coming back when the Beverly Hills location is much better."
Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",504,559,1042,5.0,3/27/2012,"I ADORE the Cheesecake Factory! I think it is my FAVORITE restaurant! I went to the Cheesecake Factory a few times now and the most recent dish I tried was ""Crispy Chicken Costoletta"" DANG! Sooooo Good! I usually don't order same dishes I have had before, only to try new ones but.. I have to tell ya, it was my 2nd time!  Side Note: I never tried asparagus until when I tried this CHICKEN! The first dish I ever ordered was Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta, which was good but don't think it suits my tastebuds, and probably won't be ordering that one again! Now I don't remember which dish my friend got the first time I went but I think it was the Caramel Chicken! I have a picture but I don't know if it was that one. How could I forget! I LOVE the interior of the cheesecake factory, it is sooooo cute! I definitely like how the servers are dressed in all white too! That is itneresting:) I always get the huge Raspberry Lemonade to go with my orders, its a bit sweet but I LOVE it!"
Kevin B.,"Signal Hill, CA",211,855,4993,3.0,3/4/2011,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in probably a year or so.    Went to this Brentwood location for a first date. The food is good, more then good in fact, but it's not exceptional.    The service was what you'd expect for this type of restaurant, polite and attentive, but not 5 star. I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad and my date had the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.   I thought the salad was fine but nothing special.   It was topped with these thin sliced, lightly battered onion rings, which were, in a word, HORRIBLE!  Ugh, so bland and flavorless!   After eating one I pushed the rest aside!   Other then this, it's a VERY large salad!    I was full after just a third of it!  My dates Crispy Chicken Costoletta with smashed red potatoes and asparagus was VERY good!    I should have ordered that instead!    No dessert for us this time around! Bottom line:  I would go back, but I'd try something different on the extensive menu."
Shannon H.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,312,161,3.0,2/7/2012,"My fiancé and I visits this location on a weekly basis. Never really had a problem with this location except for the fact that they always seem to mess up our orders on every visit. We usually enjoy.lunch or dinner here. The Renee special for lunch is great. A 1/2 turkey sandwich with salad and soup. I suggest spending lunch here on a Sunday to experience their broccoli and cheddar soup. For dinner, we usually order buffalo blasts, wings, the Renee dinner special and a Chocolate Gorilla shake. The wings are amazing! Crispy and spicy. Don't let being on the appetizer menu fool you lol, they serve a pretty decent amount of wings that's filling. The reason I give this location 3/5 stars is because the waiters are never anywhere to be found. During a sit down lunch or dinner you may see the waiter twice! We sat in a booth once with mirrors and could see our waiter behind us in the kitchen flirting with a female co worker. We had the busser fill up our drinks twice and provided us with more ranch for the wings."
Steven V.,"Sacramento, CA",533,623,621,4.0,4/11/2011,"I went here for the day before my birthday with a few friends, but I've to a couple Cheesecake Factories and enjoyed the dining experience.  I've had appetizers, Chicken Piccata, the salad, and sandwiches at Cheesecake before and they're all good. I like the big portions and quality food, and it's always nice to have a fancy lunch or dinner at Cheesecake when you get the chance.  Usually known for its elaborate interior and regal setting, this was the first time I sat outside by a fountain and enjoyed the nice sunset sky as I was dining at a cheesecake. I don't know if it was worth the sacrifice of the large and comfortable booths, but I'm a fan of trying new things.  I ordered a rib eye steak, and it was delicious. I also used my $1.50 Cheesecake coupon from facebook, which was the best deal ever. I had the Reese's Cheesecake which was extremely rich as expected and I couldn't finish it, and it wasn't my favorite cheesecake. I've tried Oreo and the Red Velvet, but the best was the chocolate crust with coconut, omg best combination of flavors ever.  I like other locations better, but if you're around the area and want to find a place where most people will be satisfied by the food, come to this Cheesecake that's hidden but at the same time close to all the hustle and bustle of Santa Monica."
Ayla A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,1,2,3.0,2/21/2015,"Great location and good food. I especially liked the tea they served, it's called Numi tea and it was so tasty that I ordered it online as soon as I got home! As for the the service it wasn't good, we waited 10 minutes for the menu, over 25 mins for the orders and the waiter wasn't around whenever we needed him. But overall, CF is a nice experience."
Jessica C.,"Los Angeles, CA",450,205,22,1.0,9/24/2010,"I used to love this place...really I did.  But this last time turned me off probably for good. Every year I break my Yom Kippur fast with friends at this location.  This year, I had received a $10 off gift card in the mail and I was excited to use it.  This year, I picked up the order and was informed that the gift card would not be honored at that location as it was only for the on in Beverly Hills.  Fine.  When I bit into my Santa Fe Salad at my friends' place, I bit into a BROKEN RUBBER BAND.  So that killed my appetite after fasting for 24 hours.  It was disgusting!!!   I called the restaurant to complain to a manager and after being on hold for almost 10 min, the manager didn't really express any remorse but instead started offering excuses for how or why a rubber band would be in a salad.  Sorry, but last I checked, there have been no health reports explaining the benefits of putting rubber bands into your diet so I didn't want to hear any excuses.  The manager offered me yet another gift card which I appreciated, but I received it in the mail yesterday and it barely covered the cost of my meal.   Very disappointed....bye bye Cheesecake Factory Brentwood.  I doubt I will ever be at your location again."
Yi Z.,"Oakland, CA",681,2747,1045,5.0,7/23/2010,Most incredible value EVER (for an non-Asian place)! I think they messed up our orders and gave us twice as much food as they were supposed to.  I got a pizza (full-sized with 8 slices) and a salad (which also seemed like it was full-sized) for $11.   It turned out to be enough for 3 meals.  Fantastic!
Karreno A.,"Los Angeles, CA",723,514,2043,5.0,11/19/2010,"NO Matter what People Say... I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! The food is never disappointing, always fresh, always well decorated, and the customer service is impecable.  The Orange and Cashew chickens are to die for along with their mashed potatoes :)  and to top it off you gotta have the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake as it is heaven in your mouth!!! YUM!!!!"
David S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",53,41,29,3.0,12/20/2012,"Typical, wait a long time, order, wait a long time, brown bread, food, finish...""did the waiter go home?""...no, here comes the bill. It's a cheesecake factory, I'm not even sure why I drafted a review for this place. It's the most vanilla restaurant on Earth. Good value on the lunch menu."
Lauren K.,"Livermore, CA",37,65,9,4.0,12/29/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant... You couldn't ask for a better selection! The prices are a bit expensive, but when compared to the amount of food you get it is actually a good deal. You just have to make sure you save at least half for leftovers (which is never a problem for me... I usually make it into four meals actually :)) My favorite dishes here include: Spicy cashew chicken, Bang bang chicken and shrimp, and Sweet potato fries. There dressings are also really good (the honey mustard and balsamic to be specific) More often than not, the wait is really long... but I think its worth it!"
Rushie B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",160,94,1174,4.0,10/24/2010,Simple I had:  Cajun pasta-a little spicy but really flavorful and Good. Santa Fe salad- Great/delish all the time ( love this one and the Chinese chicken). Fried Chicken Sliders- My 6 yr. old and I  love them. Dessert- Pineapple upside down Cheesecake. I'm not a cheesecake type of person but it was good because it also had layers of cake. Service- Good
Chanh H.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,68,,2.0,3/17/2012,"Every time I come here I am disappointed.  I've tried several of the pasta entrees and none of them have impressed me.  So for the most recent visit, I thought I'd mix it up and try a burger.  I got the mac and cheeseburger.  How could this go wrong?  I love mac n cheese and I love burgers.  Fried mac n cheese on a burger sounds like a delicious proposition.  Unfortunately, the final product was not so amazing.  It was too rich and didn't have enough mac.   I always promise myself that i'll never come back, but unfortunately my friends love cheesecake so I'll probably have to keep putting up with it.  You on the other hand should just skip this place outright."
Kayla O.,"San Francisco, CA",578,181,368,3.0,6/6/2012,"4-6 pm happy hour ! 5$ appetizers!!!  I have a love hate relationship with cheesecake factory. i used to come to this location often for happy hour. i mean for 5$ for most appetizer items you can get pretty full! until i discovered the amount of calories in their appetizers. i won't ruin it for you, but if you look it up you'll only want to pick at your food the next time you go to a cheesecake factory....  HOWEVER. i LOVE their ahi tuna tartar. I LOVE(d) their macaroni and cheese balls, til i found out one order has 1000 calories. their corn tamales are great too.  this location has valet parking, which isn't bad and makes parking in brentwood easier. the happy hour bar area is really spacious and the servers always warn you when happy hour is about to be over!"
Helen S.,"Columbus, OH",337,608,278,4.0,11/17/2011,"So I've tried practically everything that Cheesecake Factory has to offer. I've been once with my parents to the Marina Del Rey location, and once here for work (it was my going away party). But Cheesecake Factory was also one of my boss's favorite places to order from, and with weekly meetings on Fridays, I had something from here at least twice a month, not including other office parties. I really like this place, even though I never need to go again. The food is solid, I've never ordered anything I didn't like, and I don't want to like this place because it's part of a huge chain, but at the same time I can't help myself. The cheesecakes are also super tasty, like I can eat that stuff for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
Steven P.,"Danville, CA",17,260,22,1.0,3/7/2012,"If you are standing outside the place reading this, just keep walking. How corporate let this place get this bad is beyond me. Not like any other Cheesecake Factory. Horrible staff, order was done wrong, and not fresh. Don't waste your time with this one....just keep walking!"
David W.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,207,1,2.0,4/12/2012,"Food was ok, would rather have gone somewhere else for the price.  The cheesecake was good, but eating dinner instead of just getting a cheesecake may have been a lot better. My biggest issue is that this place was literally almost empty and the service was ridiculous.  I had random people asking me if I was served, I had to ask for a lot of stuff that should have been given by itself.  And just in general the waiters were talking and joking loudly and just didn't seem to take this place seriously. I can take slow service, I can even take a bit of rude, but when I'm hungry and they repeatedly both ignore me and act rude, I just can't stand it.   And of course if you want to not tip you're suddenly a criminal or a cheap jerk, so you have to tip for complete crap service!"
Lyssa B.,"Staten Island, NY",20,61,40,4.0,9/7/2010,"Very large portions, some tasty items, good ambiance, and slightly overpriced.  I come here on occasion, definately better price to quality ratio during happy hour and lunch. Cons: --Try getting street parking on San Vicente, you can't...so your other option is valet, with validation it's still like $3 plus tip. That's a general con for city life though. --There are about a bazzillion calories in most of the dishes Pros: ---Lots of options, which is particularly helpful when you're a couple and can't sychronize your cravings...chances are it's on the menu. ---Large outdoor patio to enjoy that perfect westside weather. ---""lunch portions"" which are still big enough for 3 people to share ---happy hour ---avocado egg rolls are a staple everytime I come here ---farfalle pasta is the bomb  ---good beer selection ---friendly waitstaff"
Douglas P.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,5,,4.0,9/7/2011,"It's hard to review chains but I give the Cheesecake Factory 4 stars. I am holding it to chain standards, not high-end restaurant standards, but as a good, solid chain, it deserves four. I think Brentwood is one of their best locations. I enjoy their Asian-inspired appetizers like the spicy Ahi tempura rolls and the Thai lettuce wraps, which are a great staple of this restaurant. Usually when I come here with a group for a business lunch (it is good for groups and people you just need to have a working lunch with and not necessarily impress), we'll order multiple appetizers and share across the table, like family-style tapas. Often the appetizers are enough.  I always get dessert here though, as its name suggests, I don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory without having a piece of cheesecake! My personal favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake with a coffee. We're not in Italy here but they make a decent cup. I recommend this restaurant particularly for lunch meals. Underground parking is convenient as can be its proximity to UCLA."
Beini S.,"Berkeley, CA",108,133,17,4.0,1/4/2012,"The quality of the food deserves is 3 stars, absolutely medicore (albeit the better side of medicore) chain food.  But the service, nostaliga that I lived around the block for years, and ambiance round it up to 4 stars. Great service, two types of bread (the rye is the best!!).   You can't go wrong with the Pasta Da Vinci or Steak Diane.  Cheesecake wise I love the Godiva and Banana Cream.  The omelette with mashed potato is marvelous as well.   If you're willing to walk two blocks, there's free parking off of Barrington if you head towards Wilshire."
Jacob F.,"Redlands, CA",9,7,2,3.0,9/22/2012,"Came here after a date with my girlfriend at the Getty.  Convenient location and complimentary valet parking. It was national cheesecake day, so all of their cheesecakes were half off! -Steal!  Not great service but pretty good food."
Anthony C.,"Los Angeles, CA",156,454,334,3.0,2/2/2012,"Not a big fan of Cheesecake factory and their mediocre and overpriced foods (I mean seriously, a slice of cheesecake for about $7) and everything about this place is the same.  So if you are in the area and want a consistent meal than by all means come here, otherwise there are a lot of other places to explore in West LA. Another minor gripe here is that parking is valet only and on Friday and Saturdays, even with validation, it still costs money to park.  You could also try parking in the residential area behind the restaurant but it is a little bit of a walk and don't know if it is by permit only.  Hate LA parking."
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,3.0,4/30/2009,"The restaurant is really cute, it's smaller than the other Cheesecake Factory's than I have been to.  It's kind of hard to find and the parking is difficult too.  You have to valet park in the Union Bank Parking Structure which is O.K. but if you aren't looking closely you will miss it.   My boyfriend and I came here after going to the Getty Center and it wasn't really crowded on Wednesday around 6pm.  We got the combination dinners of steak and chicken and he got the chicken and salmon.  The food was excellent and good size portions.  We got the carrot cheesecake to go...also wonderful. So why only three stars...because in the middle of our romantic birthday dinner the hostess put a mother and her THREE out of control children next to us...and there were other tables available in the SAME section.  These kids cried and screamed and pushed chairs all around banging into other customers and the waiters, it was terrible.  The hostess should have seated them a little farther from us, especially since there were other nearby tables open.  We couldn't have a nice conversation or anything with all those children crying and screaming.  We ate quickly and left.  Considering I spent $80.00...not worth it...we could have gone to Mc Donalds for the the same environment and I would have spent $15.00."
Jenna B.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,32,,4.0,9/11/2010,Really good food but EVERY time I eat there I get water thirsty- lol too much salt maybe? haha  Food is ALWAYS good and service is ok. I like the location of it. xoxo Jenna
Jensine D.,"Inglewood, CA",14,38,1,5.0,1/5/2012,"This review is solely for the cheesecakes near the to go pickup. I came in on a Tuesday night to quench a fierce cheesecake craving. Although I have eaten at Cheesecake Factory many times, I'm usually too full to even sample a piece of cheesecake. However, this time I had the delicious opportunity to have their vanilla bean cheesecake and the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. Both were incredible and even came with a heart helping of whipped cream in a to-go box. Let's just say that my inner fat girl screamed for joy :)  The to go service was prompt and the cashier was friendly. I would definitely come here again if another cheesecake craving strikes again."
Eli B.,"Chicago, IL",19,12,7,3.0,1/30/2012,"Nice place to have dinner on a saturday night, the environment is good and they open until late. As appetizers we got the stuffed mushrooms (yummy), and then we ordered a ceased salad and pan seared salmon pasta. It was decent but nothing special, the amount was good for two. It's a bit overpriced, but acceptable for 'LA-reality'.  For the desert we shared the original and cherry cheesecake -- wow, it was really amazing!  Some years ago I went to another branch in San Diego and in Mountain View but I couldn't recall how delicious their cheesecake was.  Accurate grades: for the overall experience: 3.5, but the cheesecake deserves a 4.5 :-)"
Mike S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,85,2,3.0,9/5/2011,"I simply wonder, that for a place which does a decent job of Americanized international smorgasbord, (you know, one menu having enchiladas, Thai this, Chinese that, Vietnamese something, pizza, fish 'n' chips, etc.)...   why does the cheesecake suck?  It's not inedible and it's not from Ralph's or something.  But it also is definitely not good.   I don't get it.  It's called The Cheesecake Factory.  They've been around for a long time.  Can't they come up with a better cheesecake recipe?  Eli's Cheesecake in Chicago is infinitely better. Anyway, just curious.  Other than that, they do a good job at what they do.  While PF Chang's is better at what it does, and Red Lobster is better at what it does, Cheesecake Factory is still at least good at what it does.  The stuffed mushrooms are bomb.   The calamari was good.  The enchiladas were bleh.  The kids' mac 'n' cheese for our little one was worse than Kraft. The lingering question remains...  is there anyone else out there wondering why their cheesecake isn't any good?"
Beatrice T.,"Los Angeles, CA",303,358,101,4.0,5/26/2011,"Showed up at 10:45pm not realizing they closed at 11pm on a Tuesday night. We offered to leave but the staff was still super nice and seated us, telling us to take our time. Server was amazingly attentive and friendly, and even though time got away from us, by midnight, he still served us happily. Perhaps because we were one of the last tables, the food came out fast and perfectly cooked. The fries were delish, much better than other locations with the crispy shell and soft center. Vietnamese tacos with pork belly and pickled veggies were surprisingly accurate with Asian flavors and very tasty. Chicken and biscuits was good if you like your food mushy. The chicken filets tasted as if they had been boiled, still flavorful but very soft and fork-tender... piled over mashed potatoes, and smothered with cream gravy, peas, and mushrooms. Biscuits weren't memorable but overall, good comfort food. My steakhouse cheese burger with pork belly and fried egg was juicy decadent goodness as well =) Frozen mango margarita, which has been my go-to drink for the past few weeks, did not disappoint. Very refreshing and smooth, though not that much alky. And my only gripe is for the cheesecake. It's possible that my appetite has grown but my oreo cheesecake felt smaller than usual and didn't have that burst of flavor I so crave. Maybe it had been sitting out too long."
Caroline C.,"Burbank, CA",83,77,12,5.0,7/23/2011,"My perspective for this review is coming from a mom of a toddler. I am reviewing their service at this location. If you're reading this to see how the food is, then you must not be from LA. I mean who hasn't been to CF.  When you can't decide what to eat and have time to look through a 50 page  menu, this is your place. You will always find what you might be looking for and leave full and satisfied.  I come to this location often and have never been disappointed. They have a nice bar area and outdoor patio space by the fountain.  I often order tapa style plates and drinks after work with co-workers. Recently, I came here to meet my SIL with my one yr old. The waiter brought out a ""kid's plate"" consisting of thinly sliced versions of their two breads with sliced bananas within 2 minutes of seating us.  All the servants were so attentive and checked up on even my LO. I'm always nervous about going to non kid oriented restaurants during dinner time, but the staff couldn't have made our visit any more comfortable.  Overall five star experience.  We had Cajun jambalaya, Vietnamese spring rolls, and garlic noodles with shrimp. Good food, too."
Mel G.,"Tucson, AZ",131,1891,,4.0,3/18/2011,"Great lunch spot -- not too packed, you usually get seated quickly.  This is also a good place to meet on the westside -- right off the 405, and there's usually metered parking/parking garage in the back.  Can't go wrong with the pasta carbonara and their bellinis, yummm."
Denis S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",704,1938,21,2.0,3/17/2008,"Why do I come here?  Yes, it is walking distance from my house, but so is a LOT of other delicious food.  The only thing I ever get out of this place is a large amount of guilt for eating really unhealthy food, a larger bill, and an even larger stomach.   This time was actually worse than usual.  I think my water was laced with something, because it tasted weird and my tongue became numb.  The server messed up several times on both mine and my friend's orders, and as always, I walked away regretting coming here.   Hopefully, next time I think about coming here, I'll just read this review and talk myself out of it."
Kim l.,"Santa Clara, CA",595,1236,897,4.0,12/22/2010,"The HS crew got together for dinner at CF last night around 7:30pm. There was no wait to sit at the bar/lounge area so we grabbed a table and Dan L. quickly came over with our menus. He was super polite and friendly. We all shared the avocado taquito type appetizers. Those were ok...not a big fan but my friends liked it. I ordered the Renee's special (chicken salad sandwich, salad and the wild mushroom soup) $9.95. I only finished half of the meal. The chicken salad was drowned in mayo and the bread was lathered in butter and probably pan fried=heart attack waiting to happen. The salad had a good vinaigrette dressing and the wild mushroom soup was very tasty. I had a taste of my friend's lettuce wraps (the plate looked like a mini buffet!). The chicken was a tad spicy. We enjoyed a nice dinner and got in some nice quality time with the gals."
Jean L.,"Santa Monica, CA",547,453,396,4.0,4/12/2010,"If there is one place that offers gigantic+delicious salads that leave mental room for otherwise guiltastic desserts, Cheesecake Factory wins.  I started coming to this one about five or six years ago during college. We sat in the bar to avoid the wait this past Saturday. The service is still top-notch and the food still hits the spot. Parking, a commodity in Brentwood, is valet and validated. I like it, and I return once every year or so. Oh, red velvet cheesecake..."
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,4.0,7/14/2006,"My friend being a cheesecake fiend and living in the area caused this locale to be one of my staples when I would visit the area. Sometimes long waits and a see and be seen crowd but it still has a good bustling vibe. I must admit on occasion the crowd can be extraordinarily beautiful and it's nice that there's the a decent outside area (try the outside area for the one in SF, you'll freeze your #@$! off). Alas the Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory and whether you like it or not the food is pretty darn consistent. Huge menu, huge portions, and a killer classic cherry cheesecake."

The bread they give you while you wait for your food is GOOD! They have Happy Hour specials Mon-Fri 4- 6 p.m, many appetizers are $3-$5, normally those appetizers are $5-$12. The drinks are not on special. Check out the picture I took to see the listing of the appetizer specials."
