Avital C.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,118,8,5.0,9/28/2011,"5 stars, service was great & it was pretty lonely how I like it some peace & moderate noise while I'm dinning., had the mahi mahi & my fav ritz martinis.. Fish is def a better choice for an entree than Any poultry entree.. This isn't a steakhouse so they don't have corn fed or grass fed prime steaks."
hank c.,"Cerritos, CA",103,151,,4.0,7/17/2006,"I actually got lost the first time I went here cuz i followed mapquest and literally went 340 degrees in a circle along wilshire before finally hitting this place when i could have just gone the OTHER way and came in from the backside. anyhow, again i remember this place fondly because i took a date out and funny enough my cousins gf was waitressing that night but we didnt bump into each other so i didnt get any grief about it later. you go to cheesecake factory to have cheesecake right? well, my date didnt feel like having any at the end of the meal and i almost had a COW and left there right then and there but it all worked out in the end. still my favorite dish there -- believe it or not -- the buffalo chicken strips with ALL WHITE MEAT inside. YUMMY!"
lhenay a.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/16/2010,"I've eaten at this place 3 or 4 times, and I love it! its consistently tasty and well price. I highly recommend it for anybody who likes quality food."
Jonnathan C.,"San Francisco, CA",8,39,65,2.0,4/5/2008,"I am in Los Angeles for a conference so when my fellow conference-goers decided on the Cheesecake Factory I tagged along.  My overall opinion is that if you have been to one Cheesecake Factory, you have been to them all!  Food is over flavored and rich, as are the drinks, and desserts.  Portions are huge. Even at 5pm the wait was 1 hour for a party of 6 so we ended up in the bar where we were able to sit in a matter of minutes.  The only good thing about our early arrival was the fact that we arrived during happy hour and were able to load up on appetizers for super cheap.   I would never recommend The Cheesecake Factory to anyone as it seems so commercial and touristy."
Maziar M.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,4,,4.0,10/17/2010,"Simply Good Food, Good price, Nice place, Nice Service. The only complain about this place is parking."
Linus L.,"Singapore, Singapore",51,63,,3.0,11/20/2006,"The Cheescake factory despite its name serves alot more than cheescakes. It was my first visit to this North American Chain and I was confronted with a menu complete with left pages for advertisements of Neiman Marcus the Jeweller, Dodge cars and carnival cruises. The patio outside can be a little chilly as the outdoor heaters were not working too well (2 settings boiling and no heat). Food: Beef ribs good, leave off the pasta. Louisiana Chicken was pasta with breaded chicken - neither spicy just bland, the jamabalaya tasted like something I had thrown together with spices and noodles. The Steak Diane was pretty ok , although the mash I prefer lumpier. Beef Ribs came with fries that were a little chilly which makes me think the kitchen was not timing its chips and its main dish right. The appetisers were a mixed bag: Viet spring rolls were tasty, the fried calamari were soft and cold , also the Buffalo Blast you can easily leave out. Cakes!: An unusual twist to the cheesecake was the LimeKey cheesecake, tangy flavour - probably would go well with a Magarita. The Tuxedo Choc was ok too ( I was hoping it would be more moist) All in all an ok dining experience."
J A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,40,3,5.0,8/14/2012,"Closing September 26th, have to sit on the patio one more time before it's gone."
Olivia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,90,,2.0,4/7/2010,"Decent food, but very slow service and unattentive waiter."
Lara S.,"Redlands, CA",116,19,21,4.0,3/23/2010,"The freakled strawberry lemonaid is really good, there are actuall pieces of strawberry in the glass and it's rimmed in sugar. The portions are huge and the food tastes great"
Jon U.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,3,,4.0,3/28/2010,"I come here on a regular basis with my girlfriend since it is close, open late, and pretty predictable.  They have a happy hour menu and the wait is usually not more than 5 minutes.  I think in the 20+ times I've been here in the past year we've only had to wait up to 10 minutes for a seat.  The restaurant is clean and the folks are friendly."
JD H.,"Somerville, MA",44,205,,2.0,2/7/2009,"It's hard to write this review, having worked in the restaurant business.  Some nights are off, but this night was nightmare material.  It started off great and normal (ever noticed that even the most bizzare dreams are that way to?).  We were seated quickly in the outdoor patio.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  After about 30minutes we ordered our dinner. About 40 minutes later our server told us that he forgot to put in our order.  (Both having worked in the biz before we graciously ordered again without annoyance).  30 minutes later the food came.  It was average not bad not great.  We assumed that the server would take something off the bill since we had waited for so long and had been good customers ordering apps, entrees, drinks and cheesecake.  He didn't.  We should have said something but we were tired.  The atmosphere was nice but the service atrocious.  Doe's anyone else find their menu intimidating?"
MIKE B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",27,38,,5.0,11/8/2009,"Me and my family really love this chain.  It really does not get any better than this restaurant for quality and variety.  I usually tell diners to choose only from 2 or 3 items on the menu of most restaurants to avoid disappointment, but CCF is an exception to my rule. I have eaten countless dishes on their menu and been pleasantly surprised with the wonderful meals each time. However, I would be shortchanging new diners if I did not mention what I love most on their menu which includes: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta-unbelievable Crusted Chicken Romano-again YUM Cajun Chicken Littles-Best chicken fingers on the planet BBQ Ribs-OMG great! Renee's Special-Soup,Salad,Sandwich-have it on Saturday with the Chicken soup(Sat Only) and your soul will thank you. Pizza-great Steaks-surprisingly great! You can't go wrong with the great food, huge portions, and the beautiful space you are eating within. The service is usually really good too, however I have had a few bums as servers.  The good thing is the manager has comped us completely on those occasions. This place is a real winner, eat there as much as possible, we do!"
Clifford H.,"West Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,1.0,7/25/2010,"Cheesecake Factory itself is fine.  But this is for their valet.  These a-holes scratched my car.  Then sent their insurance agent to look at it and he lied and said somebody had keyed my car. Total bs!  Because the valet is the only practical way to eat here, I've never been back since.  Valet parking is terrible."
Jon H.,"Rosemead, CA",357,29,18,2.0,1/7/2009,"I've been coming to this location for awhile now, while I'm in the area, visiting my girlfriend. We usually get ok-ish service here, but the last time we were here... ughh.... we were getting such bad service from our servers that even the manager noticed. Well I thought he did, but I'll get to that later. So I ordered a Prime Rib Medium-Rare. It should have been cooked slightly a little longer, but I won't complain about that... wait.. where's my steak knife? Can I get a knife please? Ok... hmm.. 3 minutes later after trying to flag down a waiter or a busboy...all this while my girlfriends' pasta comes and they ask if she wants cheese, and she says yes, and the waiter says ""I'll be right back with the cheese"". Ok. Bring my steak knife too please. I don't want to appear to be a barbarian, gnawing on my prime rib with a fork. Management sees me getting agitated (and did I mention we were placed on a table for two, right between a booth table and a bigger table... and there was just no room for us there) and I figure... okay, our servers will get a warning or something hopefully...whatever, I just want to EAT already. By the time I'm halfway through the prime rib, it's already gone cold. While it has gone cold.. if I am still trying to work at it with my knife and fork... it's very rude to ask me if I want a box for that. Don't even get me started on refills. It's a little rude, when the manager is standing next to me, overlooking me, and waiting for me to write out a tip. TIP? It means To Implied/Insure Prompt Service. I don't think I got that, but hey, I won't be cheap, I'll just give you a dollar.  It deserves a 1 star rating for the service I got.. but usually they're a 3-star at most. I gave it 2-stars because I'll still go there, because we just won't go as often anymore."
Nikhil P.,"Park La Brea, CA",65,21,,5.0,1/11/2007,"The fact that it is crowded has got to be a testament to it's quality. This was my 1st visit to any CF & I like this spot cuz they had a variety of folk dining there. It felt like you were a part of something, you know! The decor was, of course, styled after cheesecakes, I liked the striped designs. It has a very warm setting to it. Next time, would like to sit outside under the heat lamps & have a nice gathering there!  I tried the Hungarian Goulash & boy, did it hit the spot. A+ dish. Quantity was generous also."
Michaela S.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,239,2,3.0,6/10/2009,"i don't think i'm allowed to give the cheesecake factory anything other than three stars.  why?  well, my friend used to work there and he would constantly compare it to a corporate office - complete with rules, regulations, audits and dress codes.  (the waiters don't wear those white collared shirts for nothin'!) granted, the cheesecake factory IS a corporation, but eating at the brentwood location is probably comparable to an experience at the location in nebraska (yes, there is one in omaha, i checked).   just like in omaha, the food is delicious (how could it not with all that butter and fat in everything?), and the portions are generous.  and of course, there is a wait and no reservations.  you're not going for a dining experience, you're going for the calories."
Amanda S.,"Atascadero, CA",0,11,,4.0,10/14/2009,"I really love this Cheesecake Factory. It's walking distance from my apartment, there is parking (free with Validation!) and the outside sitting area is lovely and heated. The staff both times I went were nice and attentive, good service. The best thing for me however is the ""small plates"" listed in the beginning of the menu. The stuffed mushrooms are THE BEST. Seriously, if you like mushrooms, these will bring you back. I get them EVERY time I go to a Cheesecake Factory now. Caution: Their menu is a bit...daunting. They have SO many choices, you might be there a while. Also, there is usually a wait to get seated, reservations could be handy. And the larger your party, the longer you will wait. Also, you must valet park after a certain time in the evening, I can't remember right now. But if you go earlier like for a late lunch you're fine.  PS: A 5 star is really really hard for me to give out. This is about as good as it gets."
Tracy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",162,445,123,4.0,5/7/2007,"After an afternoon of exploring the Getty, dinner was next on list.  We timed it right, no wait.  The food was plentiful.  The service was excellent.  We were able to take our time, have a leisurely dinner with lots of conversation.   We didn't feel rush or pushed out of table.  Kudos to the staff for letting us sit and chat for an extended period of time."
m s.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,,1.0,1/27/2008,"Tonight, my fiance and I ate dinner at the Brentwood location of the Cheesecake Factory, and I have to say that it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant in my life. I live very close to that Cheesecake Factory location, so I am a frequent visitor, and I am VERY disappointed in the level of service tonight. I started off by ordering a Bikini Martini, my favorite cocktail. I have been ordering that drink for about 13 years, but tonight, for the first time ever, I was informed that I would not be able to have my usual drink. Apparently the Bikini Martini recipe has changed (I believe it used to be made with Skyy vodka, Malibu rum, pineapple juice and grenadine) and I was RUDELY informed by the waiter that the drink isn't made with vodka. When I explained that I've always ordered it with vodka, the bartender came over and told me that she didn't know what I was talking about. She then informed me that she would make it with vodka, but if I didn't like it, she would not comp the drink for me (I had never asked to be comped, so I found her statement to be rather offensive). We were also never offered any water. We had to ASK for bread to be served. The waiter finally brought the bread, but no flatware or bread plates! He just dumped the basket on the table and walked away! Since he never looked our way after dropping off the bread, we had to get up and ask for those items. He brought the flatware first, then the plates after several minutes. He never asked if we might like to order an appetizer, we just happened to catch him as he was walking away and we asked if we could order a starter. I then ordered a medium-rare Hibachi steak. It arrived rare. Again, we had to get up and walk to the register area to inform the waiter of this. I waited for at least 10-12 minutes for a replacement. A busboy finally brought my dinner to me, but again I had NO fork or steak knife (these had been taken away with the rare steak). When I asked for more utensils, I was informed that the restaurant was out of steak knives! When I protested that it had been at least 30 minutes since I first ordered the steak and that I was hungry, the busboy apologized and said that he would take care of it. This was the first act of kindness or caring shown to me since sitting down at my table.  I wanted another drink, but again, the waiter refused to look our way. (God forbid he might, you know, come by to see if we needed anything!) At that point, my fiance got the manager. The manager came to our table and apologized, and he assured us that nothing else would go wrong. He came back to check on us several times after that (something the previous waiter had never done.) I understand that mistakes happen, and sometimes people have an ""off"" night, but what really bothers me is the complete indifference of the waitress and bartender. They were both rude and incompetent, and neither ever offered ANY apology. Every time we told the waiter that something was wrong, he said ""Oops"" and nothing else. As I mentioned, I eat at the Cheesecake Factory frequently, and the Brentwood location is frequently less than stellar (Marina del Rey is the best in the area-- friendly, attentive service with a smile!), but this experience takes the cake. I honestly don't think I will return to Brentwood. For the record, my partner and I were seated in the bar area right next to the window, and the waiter was a young blonde-haired man."
Srinivas R.,"Los Angeles, CA",692,252,2,3.0,12/11/2007,"Never has a trip to the cheesecake factory been so eventful. I woke up hung over after throwing a huge house party only to find a few friends passed out on my couches and woken by the sound of one of them talking on the phone to the one friend who found a cab home. It was a great night from what we remember despite the fact that somebody knocked over our stripper pole.  As we're taking out the trash, I run into our neighbor who made a brief appearance the night before.   I'm thinking ""shes our age, we should invite her to breakfast."" So we do. I should have known something was wrong when she asked if she could come over and have a drink at 9:30 in the morning and she drank a vodka and red bull. Actually, she drank one and made another one.  In the midst of her drinking we hear that she's a recurring actress on CSI Miami or so she says. Then, we decide to head out, and my friends leave to go change. Then I get a phone call from a friend saying ""yo, I looked her up on IMDB, she's full of sh$#$.""  As we roll to another friends to pick him up, I realize she's drinking vodka and red bull in a red solo cup and driving. When she parks 10 feet from the curb I take the keys from her.  Shortly after, we proceed to the Fairmont to attempt brunch only to learn brunch is already over. We are planning to go to IHOP and Ms. CSI MIAMI tells us ""I can get you hooked up at Viceroy. I'm a pretty famous actress."" So famous, that you live in my apartment complex, sharing an apartment with someone.  By the time we arrived at Viceroy MS. CSI MIAMI is quite drunk. After 10 minutes, she tells us she's hooked it up. ""I got you hooked up with Valet Parking."" We learn that the brunch is 55 dollars. Considering we're grad students, we're like, ""let's get out of here."" One of our friends decides to stay behind to take care of CSI MIAMI. About 20 mins later we get a call from our friend and he tells us ""she decided to stop at the bar and have a drink.  Me: what the hell is she drinking?  Friend: She had a mimosa Me: Oh Friend: And two shots of patron. I have to go... Another 30 mins goes by and we haven't heard anything. Next, we get a phone call  Friend: Yo!!!! This bitch is crazy...Come and get me. CSI MIAMI: F$%$$ YOU.. GIVE ME MY PURSE Me: Yo, give her the purse Friend: I don't have her purse, it's on the floor.  Me(laughing my ass off): Well do something.  20 Mins Later Friend: Yo, I have a problem. I'm driving her car to cheescake factory but she's passed out.  Me: Stop at a red light, leave the keys and jump out.  Friend: Yo, I can't do that Me: fine, leave her car in a residential neighborhood and roll down the windows Friend(running down San Vicente in his pajamas, pulling out his hair): Yo, I left her car and her in it. I felt like Jack Bauer walking away from that car.  Apparently they have cheesecake"
