Kanani B.,"Cardiff, CA",226,194,49,4.0,9/3/2008,"I get the same thing every time - brown bread (skip the white), strawberry lemonade, avocado egg rolls, chicken piccata with pasta and a dessert.  The cheesecake is good but super expensive for a tiny slice - there's usually more whipped cream than actual cheesecake. The other dessert options are surprisingly good - strawberry shortcake and apple crisp are always yummy if you're looking for a healtheir alternative. Although there can be a wait, after being seated I have received good service the majority of the time!  Although I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes at this location. I'm sure the wait is significantly longer if you dine during peak hours, on the weekends, with a large group, or a combination of these so you have to factor that in to the ever popular Cheesecake Factory!"
Nicole J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,3.0,6/23/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but I have had not so great service every time I have come in to this specific location. Once it took almost 45 mins for our food to arrive (only 3 of us dining - on a weeknight). Same thing the next time my husband and I went, and we both ordered salads! The worst though was when we tried to use a Cheesecake Factory gift card that we had just been given as a gift and the server came back and said there was no money on it. He said I could call the customer service number on the back of the gift card if I wanted to check. I did. The full $50 was still on the card. I still have no idea why he didn't call the number himself or talk to a manager. Still, I like the southwest chicken salad here so I will probably still come back. Wish the service was better (I think I have always had the same server though ..  maybe I should just try to sit in a different section)."
Jacob M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,23,,5.0,4/15/2009,"Just like the CPK, Cheesecake Factory is a good place to go with a group of people or your family because the menu is so diverse.  This place makes you wonder how many different chefs they have to have in order to make so many different styles of food.  In addition, they do almost everything extremely well.  The food is a bit pricey, but it is a delicious meal with more than generous portions.  I usually eat so much that I do not really have room for dessert.  That does not even count the various appetizers that they offer and the 2 types of bread are great (sourdough and a wheat...both are great).  Get to this place early because it will get crowded.   The only thing that bothers me is menu advertisements.  Really...I have to see advertisements when I am out to dinner looking at a menu?"
Grant H.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,60,8,3.0,7/15/2007,"Ever been to Cheesecake Factory before? Ok, picture that except add an hour to the wait time and there you have the Grove's Cheesecake. Insanely large portions, decent service, etc. etc. Nothing new here, but that can be a good thing, no?"
Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,67,,4.0,3/6/2006,"One of the better Cheesecake locations around.  It hasn't been as crowded as other locations... I have never waited for one of the buzzers here because I usually arrive on the later side.  They stay open until 11 M-Th and 12:30 on Weekends which may not sound late but in L.A. this is kind of rare.  Huge menu and they are always willing to make any changes you want with your entree.  Decent food, fun, and always great desserts.  Try the underrated Strawberry Shortcake but ask for berries w/o syrup or the Baked Apple."
Jay D.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,77,1,5.0,12/11/2007,"Consistently the best dinner around for the money.  Huge portions, excellent food.  Only complaint is the long wait at times (Marina Del Rey and the Grove), but that's from the deserved popularity."
eduardo m.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,,4.0,9/16/2007,"Its a pretty good place, I've been at another one around Alhambra and there was not much in a difference in between the two. I love their BBQ pork sandwich, big and messy just how i like it. :]"
Navin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/11/2009,Visited this lovely restaurant twice in the last week- excellent service- great food- highly recommended for a casual night out
Mike C.,"West Hollywood, CA",49,555,106,3.0,12/19/2006,"Yeah, I agree all Cheesecake factories are ""eh."" This is the place to go when you're too lazy to go anywhere else, or can't agree on where to go. Food is decent enough, with prices and portions that are appropriate. A place with such a huge selection of menu inevitablty has some real good items, some mediocre. Brunch is not as good as lunch, for example. This particularly location has awfully slow service, which is fine when you want to spend time with the people you're eating with."
Rae T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,4.0,4/15/2009,"best cheesecake factory location i've been too. really great service, amazing bread (of course), and convenient location. you never have to wait that long and there is cheap underground parking. huge portions so go hungry or be prepared to take home leftovers!"
Lynn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,69,1,5.0,10/27/2006,One of my favorite places! Try the banana cheesecake! Incredible. Easy parking. Nice outdoor seating with heat lamps. The only downside is that sometimes there is a wait. It is worth it thought.
Gina C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,74,,4.0,9/25/2008,"It's standard Cheesecake Factory food (large portions and also you should just stick with what you know and like because there are some true horrors on their menu), but I'm giving this four stars for having a surprisingly nice outdoor space with a good ambience and for having very low wait times for a Cheesecake Factory.  Lots of times we've been seated immediately.  On a nice night the outdoor area has just the right amount of quiet buzz.  And they're not stingy with the heat lamps if it's a little colder."
E S.,"San Francisco, CA",12,76,,1.0,6/11/2007,"i came here with a group of firends for brunch.  they sat us outside in the cold and didn't even turn on the torches for us. my food came out when everyone else in my group was finishing up theirs. the waitress gave me a mumble for an apology (more like an excuse than an apology).  at a restaurant like this, one would think a comp the dish, but, nothing.  needless to say, i was utterly disappointed at the level of service i was given at this location."
