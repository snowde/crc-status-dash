lance i.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,50,,2.0,7/28/2011,"CAFETERIA FOOD is a perfect description. I came in for a beer and appetizer about 2 months ago. Stone IPA for $5 great price for a really good IPA. Popcorn shrimp was whatever, greasy no real crunch or flavor and way too filling, like blowup food feeling after. Went back for dinner with my lady around 10 PM because Tavern Kitchen was closed...WTF! Tavern you suck, kitchen is closed at 9:50 on a Wednesday boy business must be bad! Anyway, walked to Cheese Cake and I was raving how good the meatloaf is to my lady, wow have things changed. Really sad to think how good this place was and how it has really regressed through time. They use to serve with these caramelized onions that would melt in your mouth. The sauce used to be a kind of a BBQ/Gravy and was perfect complement to the meat. The onions were grilled and not for a very long time and the sauce was really thin with no flavor and ABSOLUTELY not the same as they use to make it. The mash potatoes were really starchy, not bad but not good either. The vegetables had the most flavor, was the tastiest item on the plate. Overall the dish lacked flavor and freshness, tasted like I was eating leftovers...totally unsatisfying meal."
Juliana K.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,22,13,3.0,3/26/2011,"This is probably the best Cheesecake factory I've been to. The service is great, the food is just like all the other locations, but the atmosphere is awesome! It was darker then all the other cheesecake factories which in my opinion.  It was probably my favorite location because I finally found my favorite thing to eat from Cheesecake. The Ahi Tuna Salad is amazing!"
Amy F.,"Orange County, CA",316,508,31,5.0,10/27/2009,"Yum yum yum, went here for my 24th birthday! I liked my grilled chicken sandwich, although I wish they did not butter the breads...too much butter! Yech. Otherwise, the chicken inside was good. And my favorite part was the fresh strawberry cheesecake. My friends and I were talking about how nice it would be if we could sample every flavor...I'd totally do it! This restaurant was nice and had an upper class feeling. I think it's because it's in Brentwood! Me like."
Nathan C.,"Dallas, TX",110,19,8,4.0,3/26/2011,Great food/great portions/great prices. Great restaurant with a good view of Marina Del Rey.  The only downfall is there is only valet parking ~$4 and there is almost always a short wait to get a table.
Monica C.,"Long Beach, CA",81,82,44,4.0,7/31/2010,"Out of all the chain restaurants there is, Cheesecake Factory is by far the best. This is no understatement! Value? Check.  Large portions? Check.  Good tasting food? Check.  Variety? Check. Check.  Dessert? It's called Cheesecake Factory for a reason!  Good alcohol selection? Fully stocked bar!  Service? Decent. Parking? Ehhh. Overall, this particular Brentwood location is set apart from all the other Cheesecakes because of their outdoor seating. I've been to quite a few and to be honest, I think the tables surrounded by a huge fountain makes the restaurant more upscale and less like a chain - totally fits into the Brentwood neighborhood as well.  Usually Cheesecake Factory does not do reservations, but I hear, if you know somebody that works there or want a particular server, you just might be able to get seated in a timely manner!  Yet, what I felt might draw people away from coming to this location might be the difficult parking. They have their own valet parking garage that you can get free parking for 1 & 1/2 hours if validated and parked before 6pm, but after that, it's a flat rate of $2.75. All I gotta say is, that's LA for ya and if you want to save a buck or two, eat fast and come before 6! They wouldn't even let me slide for parking at 6:02 :[ Also, what I didn't like about this location was their restroom. I know this is odd, but all the other Cheesecake restrooms have quite a few stalls (this had only 2) and look just as elaborate as the interior of the dining area (this bathroom was not cute).  But if none of that bothers you and you're just looking for a good meal at a good value and amazing portions, Cheesecake Factory's food never disappoints!"
Henry S.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,130,18,4.0,8/27/2010,"So here's the thing about cheesecake, are their food amazing? nope does it taste good? i would say so. good service? good 90% of the time. Large portions? Very large. Variety? almost too much. Open late? kind of (11pm). I've been to Cheesecake for years... almost too many times. It's because it's such a great place to go to when you can't decide what you want to eat. You want to go to somewhere relatively nice, with a full bar but not too expensive but also with good food... eh... ok lets go to cheesecake. It always goes like that. Honestly they deserve 3.5... but being a frequent patron I'll round them up."
Tom A.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,121,1,3.0,8/14/2011,"Extremely good free bread & diet coke. Or maybe I was just in a good mood. Crab cake appetizer, good. Fish Tacos, OK. There's about 10,000 things on this menu. I decided I'm going to start treating it as 100 restaurants in one and work my way through the menu to find the best stuff."
J S.,"Los Angeles, CA",313,520,92,4.0,11/15/2009,"Everybody knows cheesecake factory.  Good Chain, and the location is one of the better ones despite parking garage (pay).  But Validated for ~1.5 hours...which isn't a very long time.  But the plus side is that on a Friday night ~ it wasn't too busy.   Needed some cheesecake coffee and mojitos ;) to dilute the beer and wine from F.O. (CC Location, clearly)."
Ray C.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,125,,4.0,9/18/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is just Cheesecake Factory, but I LOVE x3 this location! Ok, so the parking fee sucks - they make you valet your car, but it should be no reason to deter you from going.  It's like the Redondo Beach location, but much much cozier and rustic.  I flippin love sitting in the Patio. The service here is excellent - as most Cheesecake Factories have great service, but I was quite impressed by how particularly friendly the hostess was and how kind my server was.  They demonstrated the perfect amount of attention and gave us enough privacy to make us feel as if we were in our own corner of the world. I don' think I need to mention the food.  You don't go to Cheesecake because of the food, but you go for the Cheesecake.  Their Red Velvet is AWESOME, but its also a heart attack waiting to happen.  I usually go for the Banana Cream, Turtle, Original with Strawberry, or their Oreo.  Can't ever go wrong with any of them. Drool..."
lindsey s.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,14,1,3.0,11/17/2009,"I live right by this location, so I head over every so often when i feel like eating something grossly oversized.  It seems like its sort of headed downhill if you ask me. One, the presentation of the calorie info on the foods MAKES ME UNABLE TO EAT ANYTHING ON THEIR MENU.  I guess I just prefer to not know that my favorite dish is gonna set me back 2000 calories.  I miss when i could eat in ignorance.   And lately the servers I have had have either had sections that were too big (so they couldn't manage their tables in a timely manner) or they were just inattentive.  Whenever I needed something, they weren't around.  And some of the servers just have odd personalities, which doesn't mesh well with the insanely corporate robotron waiter service they are simultaneously trying to present.   my tip: eat in the bar.  The servers aren't such weirdos back there."
Edwin C.,"New York, NY",109,111,33,1.0,6/4/2009,"Cheesecake Factory, just like every other one, nothing special.  But this one was extremely slowwwwww. We came here during lunch on a Friday and they were pretty busy.  We made reservations for our group but still had to wait for about 10 minutes.  Then it took another 10 minutes for our waiter to come take our order. It took about another 30 minutes to get our food, but we were still missing 1 order. We asked the waiter about it, and he said it was coming... He had to keep asking us what it was that we ordered... probably because he forgot to put the order in.  So we waited another 20 minutes for that last order.  Finally when we were done and wanted to ask for the check, no one would even acknowledge us. Or when they did, they would say they'd be right back.  That was another 15 minutes of trying to just get our check.  It then took another 10 minutes before we got our cards back to sign the receipt.  In the end, it ended up being a 3 hour lunch during a work day. At least I got to spend less time at work."
Leslie C.,"San Francisco, CA",51,264,202,3.0,5/30/2010,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. I've never had dinner here, so this was a first. Food was alright, pretty big portions. Got the herb crusted filet of salmon, not too bad for a place that specializes in cheesecake, which of course, were really good. I will say this though, the lighting could've been better.. it was a little dark. I mean, I'm sure they were going for a romantic atmosphere.. but seriously, there's a difference between a slightly dimly lit restaurant and a place of darkness. All in all, it was coo. Could've been worse and I'm willing to come again, but I won't go out of my way to come here."
Brian D.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,80,,3.0,3/20/2009,I'd managed to live my whole life without dining at a Cheescake Factory ... until last night. It wasn't awful.  What else could I possibly say? Oh ... It has the biggest menu I've seen outside of an NYC diner in a long time...
Alan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,162,14,2.0,3/25/2012,"Honestly I don't know why I went here.  For some reason I thought we wouldn't have to wait if we went early, but of course that's not the case with an hour wait.  The tables were packed together and I wanted to get out of there as soon as we sat down. Food was good, but its not worth the hoops we have to go through to get a table."
Chris H.,"London, United Kingdom",18,81,23,3.0,6/10/2009,"Setting - The outside seats have a great view of the ocean and at night this place is great! I loved the setting and the space available  Service - Very friendly chatty beautiful girl who was very accommodating and there to help us as well as tell a few jokes and really improve the whole experience. Food - Ok, the menu is huge. Way to huge. I mean stupidly huge. I swear War and Peace is shorter than this thing. For starter I had Buffalo Blasts which were ok. I got 7 of them (yes 7!!) and in the end just ate the insides as the outside was just too greasy and spicy. The chicken and cheese inside was fine. Mains was Steak Diane and Chicken something or other with Mash. Nice, Steak was ok but could have been a bit more of it and the chicken was very flat and had cheese baked onto it (no idea why, didn't say that in the menu) and the mash had great big lumps in it. It was edible and I survived eating it so all good. What saved this place was the cheese cakes, OMG the cheesecakes. They were awesome. Cherry and Strawberry with cream. Oh yes it was heaven.  Go for the cheesecake and leave the rest of the foods.  Overall - I wouldn't go here again for a main meal but for cheesecake this place is a must."
Robert H.,"West Los Angeles, CA",1,44,,2.0,12/1/2010,"Been going here for years.  10 years ago I would say it was a 4.5, but it's been in decline for awhile, so now it's about a 2.5.  3-3.5 stars if we get Ric to serve us.  Other servers are more miss than hit; the service is very inconsistent and often very inattentive.  They have this annoying policy of sending your server on a break in the middle of your meal and the substitute usually is clueless about what you are having or what you may need.  They also send your food out with expediters who almost always have no clue about something you may have asked for (i.e., no cheese, dressing on the side, etc.)  If your expediter brings out a dish incomplete (like for instance, no soup spoons for the soup), they invariably will not return to correct the oversight even when asked. As far as the food goes, the Thursday night chicken tortilla soup is consistently very good.  This is probably the only reason we have kept going back for all these years.  The rest of the items can be pretty inconsistent, although the grilled salmon is usually a safe bet.  The bread used to be great, but now it often tastes like they keep it in the bread warmer inside the plastic bags (mmm...melty plastic); that is, if you get it warm.  As far as the signature cheesecake, I never have it since I prefer the more New York style sour cream cheesecake to this sugary mess.  My wife likes the pumpkin cheesecake though."
Love C.,"Santa Monica, CA",1064,440,274,5.0,1/19/2007,"I heart Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is a novel and every single item is delicious!  I haven't been disappointed yet... from the appetizers, to their lunch specials, to their steaks, sandwiches, dessert... EVERYTHING is super good.  The one in Brentwood is cool because you can eat outside near the fountain... don't worry... there are heaters. My fave:  Miso Salmon.  Yum."
Amber B.,"Playa Vista, CA",1794,501,221,3.0,1/20/2009,"I'm kind of vacillating between 2 and 3 stars for my experience yesterday at this Cheesecake Factory location. I'm at a 2.5 star rating right now but you can decide for yourself if you want to round that up or down. The Pros: - at 1pm (prime lunch time) on a holiday (MLK day) we were able to get seated immediately in their patio area (it was a beautiful day so this was great) - lunch-sized salad portions are HUGE! and a couple bucks cheaper than the full order - my peach smoothie was also HUGE and totally refreshing - the menu offers ""Weight Management"" salads that boast to only have ""590 calories"" (wait, almost 600 calories for a ""diet"" salad? Am I the only one who thinks there's something wrong with this?) - underground valet parking that Cheesecake Factory can validate for 1.5 hours The Cons: - the waiter never brought us or even offered to bring us the bread basket - it took over half an hour for our DRINKS to arrive - overheard the waiter and a table of diners next to us discussing how he totally got their salad order wrong. A manager then came out and offered to give the woman an EXTRA order of the correct salad for her to take home with her but when she declined this the manager didn't offer to remove the salad charge off the bill or anything. ""I'm very sorry"" is all she would say. - most of the time our waiter was totally MIA. So, the food was good overall and I loooooove the patio area here. It has a nice little fountain area with seats surrounding it and the trees have lights in them to set a nice mood in the evening hours. I think either our waiter was just out of it that day or the restaurant was busier than they were prepared for but I felt like this lunch took forever. We barely got downstairs to the car in time for the 1.5 hour parking validation cut-off."
Katy D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,77,2,4.0,9/6/2012,"So much food!  And most of it pretty good.  The bread that comes before the meal is outstanding.  The menu is huge.  I like the chicken and biscuits, and almost everything else I have tried.  I actually love getting the strawberry shortcake, instead of the cheesecake!"
Sam L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,31,,2.0,8/7/2011,"My cousin from out of town wanted to eat here. I prefer to take the food out as service is typically ok. On this in particular instance, it was terrible with a twist of bad timing. It was 10pm & they seated us by the kitchen where there was only 1 seat that had light on the table & the other 5 seats were in the dark. I had the fish & chips which included 5 pieces of fish with a small amount of tartar sauce. The waitress asked me how's everything which I answered fine then 1 minute after, I ran out of tartar sauce. It litterally took what felt like a lifetime to get someone's attention. It was closer to 4-5 mins, it was akward during that time period because there was people passing by but not a single person looked at us with our arms waving in the air. Quite irritating as I was hungry & simply wanted to finish my food with tasty tartar sauce.  Food is consistently good with hearty portions. Gave it 2 stars because the service was a bit upsetting. We got there at 10pm & they close at midnight so it's not like we were holding them up from closing. Just had to vent. Normally it's 3-4 stars. Will write another review when I eat there again"
