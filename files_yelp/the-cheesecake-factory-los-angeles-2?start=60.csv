David M.,"Zürich, Switzerland",0,23,2,4.0,8/12/2012,"I know it's a bit tacky, but coming from Europe, it's difficult to get good cheesecake around here. And whenever I am in the states, the Cheesecake Factory is the first choice. Have been in this particular one last time I was in LA. Nothing negative to report, as long as they have the cake ;-)"
Lonneshia W.,"Bellflower, CA",3,35,,4.0,3/1/2010,"I came on a Saturday night before me and cousin went out to a lounge. We were quickly able to find seats in their bar area.  I chose a Turkey Burger  and my cousin ordered pasta. My cousin food came out and my plate food never came out. After bringing it to the waitress attention, she informed that they messed up my order and would take another 15 minutes to receive my meal. My cousin was done with her food by the time mine came and we were pushed behind on going to our next location. At the end the manager did take my burger off my bill, which was nice, but after all the waiting I chose to take my burger to go.   It sucks that you have to pay for parking, it should be validated everyday and not just the weekdays.  Overall, its a typical cheescake factory nothing beyond the norm. I probably would not chose this location just because of distance, but the ambiance is LOVELY!"
The Big E.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,5,,4.0,9/11/2012,"Well, I just found out that after 20 years (1991) of doing business, the Brentwood location will be closing by the end of September; sad. Although the other locations in the area will remain open, Brentwood was the most convieint for north west L.A. and Santa Monica residents. So long CF Brentwood; thanks for the delicious food, cheesecake, and great memories..."
Mayumi L.,"Mililani, HI",33,42,,5.0,3/26/2010,"Always a pleasure, been here almost 15 times since 2004.  My signature dishes that I love are:  1.  Miso Salmon with green scallions (green onion) and a velvety miso/teriyaki sauce with snow peas and white rice.    2.  Pasta Da Vinci: Penne Pasta W/ Chicken and Mushrooms sauteed in a creamy madeira wine sauce. 3.  Homestyle Meatloaf with corn succotash, carmelized onions, and white rice.   4.  Beverages: Frozen Iced Mango!  Yum...non-alcoholic. The wait-staff is wonderful and the hostesses are prompt.  Take-out is a breeze, and the cheesecake is great! Two thumbs up."
Tommy D.,"New York, NY",283,198,463,3.0,3/20/2009,"HOLD UP!!! Is it me or is the price of cheesecake outrageous at 7 bucks a slice?  I admit I haven't been to cheesecake in like a year.  Things have changed so much...and I thought we're in a recession.  Or may be it was just this particular branch in Brentwood. We went here on a Friday night and it was extremely quick for us to get a table (a little unusual for a Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night).  The waitress was super friendly and we found ourselves engaged in a coversation about food and Top Chef right away.  Then it all went down hill from there.  Our orders were the Evelyn's Favorite Pasta and the Grilled Eggplant Sandwich (it was a vegetarian night).  While the grilled vegetables in the sandwich were not bad...the whole sandwich tasted like it was basted with mayonnaise, injected with olive oil, and dipped in butter.  I felt that the guy chomping down a burger next to us was more health conscious than me.  Add to the side of that were french fries!  Normally...I do accept the consequences of fried foods.....if they were good!  These fries were barely worth the effort to dispense the ketchup, to sprinkle some salt and pepper, to pick it up and to eat it....not to mention the caloric intake. The Evelyn's favorite pasta was also soaked in olive oil!  Evelyn, your favorite pasta is now officialy a favorite heartache moment.  51 percent of the daily fat intake and 59 percent of the daily sodium intake....sheesh... We decided to skip the cheesecake dessert and leave the heart attack for another night.  The meal was dissatisfying...but at least the wait was enjoyably short."
priscilla d.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,138,,3.0,12/29/2011,"The cheesecake alone would get 5 stars, but I would give only 1 for the food.....Of course I love going to the cheesecake factory, I ve been there like a zillion times, and even worked there about 10 years ago, but I guess besides the cheesecake and the decor/atmosphere, the food is really bland, big portions of no taste....when there is so many items on a menu, I guess it is expected....The service has always been good and friendly though....will only go there for drinks and cheesecake from now on :) Tuxedo cheesecake is my husband;s favorite and I love their lemon-raspberry one!"
Faraz Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,36,18,4.0,12/18/2011,great place to eat. the food and service is really good and the prices are a appropriate.  there is a long wait to get a table so eiher arrive early or make reservation in advance.
Raimi B.,"Royal Oak, MI",25,21,5,4.0,2/19/2012,"The food was good and the outside patio is beautiful. The service was a bit slow but overall, it was a good experience."
Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,5.0,2/15/2009,"My favorite Cheesecake Factory location. Nice patio area, and I like that you can see into the kitchen.  Service is good. Love the happy hour prices, though I was surprised to find that the drinks were NOT discounted.  Would have thought a little harder about the 4th (or 3rd?) sangria lol.  Oh well--still a great way to try some of their appetizers at a fraction of the price. I really recommend the fried mac n' cheese. The fact that I can eat more than one or two things on the menu is enough to give it 5 stars in my book.  (I normally only eat one thing per restaurant). It's consistent with other locations, but with a better atmosphere and service. The only thing that really sucks is the parking.  EXPENSIVE..and cash only."
Jody S.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,263,224,4.0,4/16/2011,"You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. It's like a fallback safety net when trying to accommodate picky eaters or large groups.  I love their happy hour and end up coming here at least once a month after a long day at work.  From the happy hour menu, must gets are: the sauteed mushrooms, avocado rolls and the sliders.  This with the unlimited bread is definitely filling.  The staff are friendly and the wait for food is not too long. As for the regular dining area, I've had lunch and dinner here and both can get pretty crowded quickly.  I think the lunch specials are good deals but definitely not doable to be in and out of the restaurant within the hour.  Street parking is available along San Vicente or in the underground parking lot."
Katherine N.,"Santa Monica, CA",383,294,31,4.0,7/31/2008,"Everytime I come here, I must remind myself not to eat too much of the bread(especially the pumpernikel/wheat/whatever it is) as that is a meal in itself and just makes my mouth water.  The Roadslide Sliders are yummy as are the Avacado Eggrolls. Good atmosphere and very close to my place.  I reccomend the lemon drop as a drink.  Hmmm alot of their stuff is good actually"
S G.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,33,,5.0,7/16/2011,"We came here on the 4th of July, and was seated very quickly. They have a valet service, but since we walked there, we didn't need to use it. Convenient though, because parking in Brentwood can be tough. The food, I would say, is slightly above average from what you'd expect from a chain restaurant that serves a wide variety of American-style food. The fish tacos I had weren't great. Even though it was fried fish with a creamy taco sauce on it, there wasn't much flavor. My bf's pizza was pretty good. Their salads are pretty good. The portions are huge, and the price is fair for what you get.  The reason I gave the Cheesecake Factory 5 stars was because our server, Gerry, was freaking fantastic. He was really personable, cheery (even though he had to work on a holiday) and was prompt with the refills and service. He kept us up to date on the orders (such as when the bread wasn't very good so they were cooking some more, so there was a slight wait) without being overbearing. It is really true that a good server can make a mediocre meal more enjoyable.  If this is the level of service I can expect from the Cheesecake Factory from now on, I will certainly go back."
Jordan M.,"Chicago, IL",123,39,,5.0,6/6/2009,"Freaking awesome. We went on a Saturday for lunch and were seated right away outside.  Service was prompt, food was awesome, drinks were good.  We got a ""baby plate"" given to us for our little one, which I thought was pretty thoughtful.  We ordered crispy artichoke hearts, the club sandwich with fries, and a lunch pizza/caesar salad.  The portions were absolutely huge for the entrees, and no joke, all of the food was amazing.  I was so pleased with this experience. I usually wait to dine at a place twice before Yelping it, but I was really impressed with this one, so I made the exception. Edit: Not that I need to, but I forgot to mention the cheesecake.  I got the Pineapple Upside Down - it was unbelieveable."
Kris C.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,8,,3.0,12/5/2011,"It's Cheese Cake Factory. So it's got something for everyone. And we all already know it has great cheesecake. The problem at this place tends to be service. They're really slow. And they're not very attentive. The last two or three times I've met family/friends here we've had unreasonably long waits to put in orders for meals and desserts or just to ask the waiter a question. So it's not a bad place, but if the service were better it would be a better place."
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,4.0,8/19/2008,"Special Value: If you come in at Happy Hour (4-6? Monday-Friday) you can have the appetizers at a very, very modest price. These are basically the same dishes on the main menu. The appetizers are quite varied and delicious. This way you have room for dessert. The house wine by glass is very good. Our favorite dessert is the mud pie (we share)."
sarah beth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",405,339,95,3.0,5/15/2007,"First place I worked in LA, right out of graduate school. Welcome to Hollywood, here's your requisite apron.  This location, the 7th in the country, has been around since the 70's- that's why it's smaller than most CFs. The bathroom situation (2 stalls in the ladies!) is abominable, but on the whole a bit classier than the department store-sized locations. Items that are very yummy: Heavenly mashed potatoes. You can subsitute for ANY Side. (You can sub any side for any side except the new mac and cheese which will have an upcharge.) Appetizers: Calamari (comes with garlic dip and cocktail sauce, but i request marinara) Avocado Eggrolls FIrecracker Salmon Rolls Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Popcorn Shrimp (suprisingly so!) Entrees: Miso Salmon (priced better at lunch) Hibachi Steak Pasta Da Vinci bang bang chicken and shrimp (like panang (peanut/coconut) curry)  Bistro Shrimp Pasta Breakfast Quesadilla (can be ordered any time) Sandwiches: Crabcake, my fav. Esp great with mash pots as side! Chicken Avo Club Navajo (special request bread not to be deep fried) Salads: French Country Luau BBQ Ranch Chopped Salad The ridiculously named ""weight managment"" salads are good WHAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED BECAUSE IT'S GROSS: steakhouse salad- ugh the stuff they try to pass as mozzerella sliders mini-burgers (sooo greasy) buffalo ""blasts"" southwestern eggrolls (not terrible but so much better at Chilis) boring vietnamese summer rolls garlicky ranch dressing and over-garlicky ceaser salad chipotle pasta the cold,bland french fries (sub the glorious mash pots!) ""tea smoothies"" almost made me barf. meatloaf boring, overcooked filet mignon Masa reminds me: Thai Pasta (peanut butter poured over noodles) Dry Tasteless Omlettes I'm not a huge cheesecake person but my fav was the Lemon Raspberry.  The lemon drop martini is delicous. Made with their high quality lemonade and lotsa booze, it is tart and refreshing but still tastes of liquor and packs a punch. Sugar rim is swell.  The frozen Malibu Colada is hella good. The mojito is too sweet. Don't do it.  Here's a tip: Much better service inside the restaurant than the patio. Employees HATE being scheduled on the patio, so only the waiters forced to be out here will be around to help you, and they'll be in the beverage shed texting their boyfriends and whining about the crappiest shift of their life."
Michael K.,"San Mateo, CA",38,136,11,2.0,1/10/2007,"I used to dread coming here.  But now that I'm more educated about Cheesecake, it's not so bad. The thing about Cheesecake Factory is: Some of the menu items are so horrible you'd never eat them in 100 years.   Some of the menu items are clearly deserving of 5-stars.  Spot on.  Delicious.   An example of the latter is the skirt steak, or the shrimp sandwich.   It's not easy to know ""a priori"" which category you will be ordering from.  That is why you should just order the skirt steak or the shrimp sandwich, and call it a day.  The avocado eggrolls and the mini-burgers are the best appetizers if you're looking for some. The cheesecake is just OK.  Don't bother with the extra calories. A major gripe is the ads in the menu.  Cheesecake Factory is kind of like AOL.  Lots of people like it or even love it, but they're really just robbing america blind.    Robbing it of culture, variety, cuisine, and ultimately robbing it of its slender waistlines."
Mike T.,"Los Angeles, CA",259,90,32,5.0,10/9/2010,"5 stars cuz I just love cheesecake factory except the one in Victoria Gardens. They have crap service there. No matter what you get the food is always delicious! Miso salmon, chicken Madeira, roasted garlic pasta farfalle, luau salad, eggplant or portabella sandwiches are all good choices! Good for dates cuz the lighting is dim. The waiters are usually nice and attentive. Food prices are above average."
Gee M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,169,66,2.0,5/30/2009,"Don't even get me started. The Cheesecake Factory is such a bore. First of all, it takes FOREVER to get a table (I'm talking at least 25 minutes. AT LEAST) and when you do get a table it takes 15 minutes for them to even acknowledge you're there. Once they do take note of your existence, the food takes 20 minutes or so to be served. Don't bother. The food really isn't that good, and it's served in elephantine portions. There are far better lunch places in the area, and this one's kind of a drag anyway."
Kate E.,"New York, NY",125,446,,3.0,3/16/2007,"Cheesecake doesn't tickle me pink the way I think it does for a lot of people.  However, it is always a viable choice.  It's especially good for groups and people who can't decide on what food genre to partake in.  I challenge anyone to not find something they like on their extensive menu.  Also, Cheesecakes are generally pretty nice, a definite step up from places like Chili's or Applebee's.  This location has patio seating around a fountain, which is nice in theory, but sort of bizarre when you realize it's kind of in the middle of an office park (for good outdoor Cheesecake, you cannot beat the Marina). Service at lunch is okay.  I don't think it's entirely possible to get out in under an hour.   You can't beat Renee's Special for a good, filling, somewhat cheap lunch.  Small salad, cup of soap, half sandwich, all under ten bucks.  The potato soup is REALLY good.  I'll even eat it on a hot day, if they have it. Standard favorites also include Cajun Chicken Littles, the Navajo sandwich, grilled cheese, and lettuce wraps.  Yum."
