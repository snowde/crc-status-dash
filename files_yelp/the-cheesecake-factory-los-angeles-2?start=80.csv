Christine Y.,"Brentwood, CA",212,235,25,4.0,12/25/2008,"i've come here a cajillion times over the last 3 years, it's been a while but went twice in the last month with friends. Their holiday special cheesecake, the Peppermint Bark cheesecake, is AMAZING. flourless chocolate crust, original cheesecake swirled with a reddish peppermint streak, whipped cream, and crushed candy canes on top! sooo good. omg. i'm so sad it's only for the holidays!  now onto food. pretty much the same as every other cheesecake factory location, but has always been high quality. i've never had a dish show up here that i found less than satisfactory. my favorites are the avocado eggrolls, pasta da vinci, kobe burger, spicy chicken chipotle pasta, and their AMAZING caesar salad. i always get a caesar, and it's always amazing. the dressing has a great bite, with garlic and fresh ground black pepper. it's not too much dressing, nor too little, and you can't actually taste the anchovy, thank god. the one time we ended up with a small, sad-looking salad portion, they replaced it with a new, large one when we complained. nice. it's a long wait for a table during peak hours, and open seating in the bar area is a god send. HOWEVER, service there can be pathetically slow, with 1-2 servers for the entire area and they are NOT really on top of their game. needs work, CF. all in all, if you want predictably good food and a decent atmosphere, come here. if it's warm outside, the fountain-side patio is a great setting. beware parking: valet only, 2.75 with validation after 6 pm, but before 6 pm it's free but only for 1.5 hrs, after which is insanely expensive (we messed up once and had to pay almost 10 bucks!). see if you can get there before they stop serving the peppermint park cheesecake; it is just sooo good."
Christina W.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,226,30,4.0,7/15/2006,"I love this place.  It's crowded at this location, but not as bad as the one in Old Town Pas.  The valet parking is pretty much the only way to go.  The driveway down to the valet underground is REALLY hard to find ... it's the very narrow driveway entrance RIGHT AFTER you pass the restaurant itself. The restaurant will validate your parking, so you usually end up paying $1.75.  Now onto the food.  I enjoy their bar area when I just want to catch up with friends.  All their drinks go down smoothly and I like my spinach and artichoke dip on the side.  The sweet corn tamale cakes are really good too.  They put salsa and sour cream on it.   In the words of Ms. Ray, YUM-O. I know the selection is wide, but If you want a dinner entree rec, my ultimate favorite is the parmesan crusted chicken romano.  Ask them to serve it with bowtie pasta and cream sauce instead of the light tomato sauce.   For a spicy kick, try the cajun jambalaya pasta.  I also like the chicken madeira, but that's too mainstream.  If you're feeling the winter pounds comin' on, then try their HUMONGOUS salads - the santa fe, bbq ranch chicken, grilled chicken tostada, herb-crusted salmon or seared tuna tataki salads.   The only thing I wouldn't recommend here is their fresh fish tacos ... somewhat bland.   Onto dessert!  You HAVE to try their coffee heath bar, oreo and kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecakes (hey, anything with alcohol in it sounds good to me!)"
Elizabeth F.,"San Diego, CA",53,71,24,3.0,7/10/2011,"UPDATE: 1) person taking order for to go placed the wrong order 2) person who gave me my food said cheese quesadilla doesn't come with guacamole and salsa when the last 2 times I ordered quesadilla it did 3) got home to find a mini pizza instead of quesadilla 4) had to drive back to get quesadilla EQUALS refund for quesadilla, instead asked for free cheesecake. Next time I'll order my usual choice."
Morena C.,"Brentwood, CA",98,93,,2.0,6/25/2008,"You know how when you are hungover you really just want to eat what you want and enjoy it?  Well, I do.  I came with a few friends Sunday for lunch after a big night of drinking.  It was about 95 degrees out and we sat outside (partially) under an umbrella.  I usually love to come here and sit outside, but this was a little out of the ordinary.  You would think the waitress would be good about refilling our cold beverages on such a hot day in the sun...but not at all! Long story short, we were just taking our time and ordering an appetizer or two at a time.  We really just wanted calamari.  There was what looked to be a 3"" long, somewhat curly hair....from ""down there.""  It was DISGUSTING!!!   When we pointed it out to our waitress, she was very calm and casual and goes ""yeah, I guess that does look like a hair.  soooooooooo, do you want me to take this plate?""  No apology.  No, would you like me to bring a new plate....NOTHING!   My friend who was with us informed us that he was eating at this location a month before and bit into a rubber band!  Now this?  What is going on over there!?!?! I am a bit scarred and don't think I will be visiting this location anytime soon."
missy k.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,43,25,2.0,3/15/2011,let me start with the fact that i LOVE the cheesecake factory! one of our family's favorite places to eat. this one is the worst i have EVER been to! the food was not great and the service was horrible. this is our third time trying this location in brentwood. never again will we try.
Sandy W.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,18,,5.0,8/15/2011,"We brought a small group to this location, and had a great experience--Thanks to Fred Hanna, general manager! All the staff is superb, and the food is, of course, delicious. A great experience, and thank you everyone for your time and effort!"
Tami R.,"New York, NY",204,289,2,4.0,10/28/2006,"It's the cheescake factory, so it's predictably good. My friends and I have a few opinions about this place.. 1) every restaurant should do something really well, but it tooks us a while to realize what they do well (other than the obviousl cheesecake)... they made pretty decent healthy chinese food. The veggies are always crisp and there's always enough to share and then eat for lunch the next day.  2) My friend Natalie from home has this theory about every cheesecake factory.... they give you an ungodly large staw, continiously refil your water in a large glass so that after you've eaten a tone you have to go to the bathroom... at which point you pass by the cheesecake and say mmm that looks good but I'm sooo full.... then you do your business and have to go back to your table, at which point you again pass the enticing cheesecake and say ""well we can order a piece and share it now that I have room"". But when you get back to the table you realize all of the cheesecakes sound amazing and you can't decide on one between all of you and you have ot order more than one slice. And that's how with oversized portions they can still get people to have room for dessert. On a side note, you can order the full menu from the bar so if the wait is forever try to get seats in the bar area, it's a first come first serve sort of deal."
John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",136,576,46,4.0,10/8/2008,"You would think that my friends think I'm from another planet when we were standing on San Vicente Ave. trying to decide whether to eat at Coral Tree Cafe or Cheesecake Factory.   Ben: ""WHAT?  You've NEVER been to the Cheesecake Factory???""    Me:  ""Never been.""   It was if I had never been to Costco before.   Me: ""Let's go.""  Upon entering, I was in awe at the sheer size and variety of Cheesecakes offered in the glass display.   If this place didn't represent all that was American, I don't know what does.  We opted to sit outside (at my apprehension after reading my fellow Yelpers' reviews that service outside was inferior to service inside) since it was a pleasant day.   I found that this wasn't the case at all:  the service was quite good.  Upon opening the telephone-sized book called the menu, I was impressed at the variety of options from which to choose.  We ordered: GRILLED SHRIMP & BACON CLUB (Shannon), CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD (Bernie), THE CLUB (Ben), and I had the CALIFORNIA OMELETTE.   Everyone seemed quite happy with their selection -- needless to say there was food left over.  I tried the shrimp/bacon club sandwich and I can say it was even better than my omelette.  The bread that was delivered to the table was delicious (especially the squaw/dark bread) and everything was true to the Cheesecake Factory name:  LARGE baby.   Incredibly enough, I was the only one gluttonous enough to leave no trail of food on my plate.   I only wish they had the little piggy nose to give clients if they finish all the food on their plates.   Nevertheless, after scarfing down the entire meal, I HAD to try the famous cheesecake (OINK OINK).   Bernie opted for the 30th ANNIVERSARY CHOCOLATE CAKE CHEESECAKE  and I opted for ADAM'S PEANUT BUTTER CUP FUDGE RIPPLE.  It was, by far, the heaviest piece of cheesecake I've ever stuffed into my piehole.    Really delicious, but, must be on the order of 800 calories.  Wow.  Needless to say, I didn't eat dinner that night.   All in all, my first experience at the CF was a pleasureable one.  We were stuffed and happy.   If only they had wheelchairs to wheel out the stuffed patrons to the cars....then I'd surely give a 5 star review...."
Reilly L.,"Vancouver, Canada",18,15,29,4.0,1/29/2009,"Ive been here several times in the past six months and must say that I'm a fan. Truthfully, compared to other Cheesecake locations, these guys only have a few traits that allow them to stand out.  For one,  the view is awesome..  you can see out over the marina from just about anywhere you sit in the restaurant.  Plus every time I've been here I've never had to wait.  The valet parking on the other hand is a pain. I often park in neighboring lots and walk.   The food is really about the same as every other cheesecake which in my opinion isn't a problem at all. I find their food absolutely delicious and their portions to be very generous .  I find myself ordering the shepherds pie, the shrimp and chicken gumbo, or  the chicken and biscuits all the time..  And we always order some fried macaroni to start off."
DixieNormas t.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,54,1,4.0,6/12/2010,Very good example of what a cheesecake factory can be. Good food and fast great service.
A. C.,"Brentwood, CA",96,227,32,5.0,10/24/2006,"Cheesecake Factory rocks. I don't care how big they get, or how many people in Nebraska brag that they now have their own location and don't have to go to fancy-pants West LA... I love this joint. Let me list the reasons. The huge menu. You literally can walk in their with no idea of what you want to eat, and you'll find something good. The Portions. Are huge... like really big. You'll always have leftovers and a doggie bag. The Prices. Are reasonable. You can always afford to eat here. The Cheesecake. You name it, they have it. I prefer the plain with fresh strawberries though. And you can buy whole cheesecakes for parties. Not cheap... The Brentwood location has a good-sized bar in the front, where you can eat off the entire menu, or just have a drink. The main room is large and comfortable, but not as large as the Marina or Sherman Oaks. And the patio is great - tables surround a fountain, which is nice during the day or at night. Parking is validated in the structure below, a dollar or so for an hour and half (I think)."
Denise K.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,74,1,4.0,2/12/2011,Always good for a family outing.  Great portions and amazing deserts!
Jennifer C.,"Santa Monica, CA",42,173,7,3.0,4/22/2007,"I LOVE the strawberry shortcake.  It's the best thing on the menu. I love the big portions and price but the food doesn't always taste so great.  You really should just stick to what you know is good.  DO NOT TRY NEW THINGS.  My friend got a chicken pot pie and it was scarily huge and the taste was not so good.  I think the nachos, avocado egg rolls, burgers, chicken fingers, pizzas, and salads are good.  Great ice teas.  The cheesecakes all taste the same to me - super rich.  My favorite cheesecake is the plain strawberry, and I love rich chocolate things.  They have 4 or more kinds of chocolate cake but none are worth writing home about.  The carrot cake is decent.  Just go for the iced tea and strawberry shortcake.  The hostess at the location is sooo on the ball and friendly."
Farnaaz T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,,5.0,12/10/2010,This is one of my favorite places to eat at. Service is good. Waiters are knowledgeable. Food is yummy. My favorite is the mahi mahi meditteranean. It's the best I've tasted. But the coffee is a favorite. I'm not a huge coffee drinker but this place has the best coffee.
Rachel R.,"Cool, CA",372,1059,12,4.0,1/17/2006,"This Cheesecake Factory location always sports a long wait, though you can opt to try to find a seat in the crowded bar.  The decor is pleasing and their menu enormous.   Portions are huge, so plan to share or take home leftovers; an appetizer can easily fill in as an entree (as the bruschetta often does for me).  Parking can be terrible unless you valet it (drive past the restaurant and pull into the underground lot).  We also love to eat here because it is open until 11 pm everyday except Friday and Saturday, when it is open until 12:30 am.  Vegan Report:  The Cheesecake Factory has surprisingly few options.  Besides the bruschetta, I love the Chinese Chicken Salad without the chicken (or for a more reasonably priced and sized salad, I get the Traditional Tossed Green Salad wtih the Chinese plum dressing and I ask them to add rice noodles).  They have several good pastas and the veggie burger without cheese is decent.  I also always ask about the soup of the day in the off chance it is vegan.  Note that their Asian Stir Fry isn't vegetarian, because it has fish sauce in it."
Diana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,61,8,3.0,8/30/2012,good for big groups since it has a wide selecton but not crazy about the food.  everything has too much sauce and that is how they create flavor in the food.
Alli J.,"San Francisco, CA",136,446,1,1.0,10/30/2006,"If I could some up the Cheesecake Factory chain, I think I would say, ehhhh. It's just nothing to hoot about. This branch in particular has a nice outdoor patio but there are usually quite a few rowdy patrons at night therefore making it a not-so-pleasant experience most of the time. I also find it hard to believe that a restaurant which literally uses a 20 page menu can serve quality food, it's just not possible. (I find the ads on the menus really tacky as well!) If anything, go for the cheesecake or because it's one of the only late night dining options in Brentwood."
Jessica T.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,49,,4.0,3/14/2011,"LOVE the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake! Omg, just writing about it makes me salivate. May have to go there for dinner tonight :) I've had several items off their menu and they have all been delicious. Highly recommend this place for a casual dining experience."
Judy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",33,131,,4.0,1/15/2008,"I would give it a higher rating if only they took reservations.  But given that they don't, sometimes the wait can get pretty long on certain nights.  But this is LA and there's a wait everywhere.  I almost always get the pasta and the portions are pretty large (you will probably have leftovers).  Prices are around $15 which is very decent.  I've never had a problem with the service and all the servers are consistently friendly and attentive.   Their cheesecake is sooooooooo good and they have a HUGE selection.   Make sure you save room for dessert."
Natasha S.,"Oakland, CA",436,344,73,4.0,2/7/2007,"I've been to this one more times than I'd like to admit.  And I've got the group photos to prove it.  Same food, w/ a Brentwood twist.  Patio w/ heated lamps.  Valet garage parking.  And people chowing on salads, dressing on the side.  There's always some big party or another here, too. My friend from London loves this place.  So every time we're both in town, I pick my friend up from her ex-employer's (Claudette) place in the hills.  And each time, Claudette asks, ""So where are you two girls going to eat?""  And each time, we chime excitedly, ""Cheesecake Factory!"" To which, she shakes her uber-tan and youthful (""Hawaiians don't age"") head at us, tsk tsking, hand on her teeny tiny super-tan and taut waist, eyes glued to our expanding paunches.   Fried chicken salad and appetizers, here we come!"
