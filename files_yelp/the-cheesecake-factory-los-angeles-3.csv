Mark T.,"Los Angeles, CA",501,177,805,4.0,1/7/2018,"Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake? You know I love to go there Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney...... This is definitely a family place, the environment exudes that. The service was A1, the food was full of flavor and large in size, and the drinks were solid. I'd like to go back and try other things on the textbook of a menu they have."
Rylle R.,"Temecula, CA",88,2,,3.0,1/6/2018,"Like most Cheesecake Factories I've been to, the food has always been good. However, I would suggest to never go on a busy night.  A 2 hour wait is not great, but you have the rest of the mall to explore in that time. We were seated on the balcony with the theater lobby in view. It was a nice atmosphere but then I sat down and my feet were greeted with a wet syrupy floor. I look down and find that the entire floor has been neglected, cluttered with spills and stray food. Not something I want in any restaurant or my own home. A dirty restaurant is something I can't stand. The service is decent. The servers were very nice and food was served in about 10-20m of ordering. However, you can tell its a busy night when you notice that the pasta you ordered was slightly undercooked. It was also a little bit colder in temperature than you would want to eat it at. Then you would see under a light, the large smear that was meant to clean the edges of the plate. It should have been clean, but it was a clearly visible tomato smear.  As the table beside us finished eating and the clean up crew came around, I really hoped they would clean the floor. Unfortunately they didn't and it bothered me quite a bit. I wouldn't want to tell someone else to do their job when I'm a customer, so no words left my mouth.  TL;DR The cheesecake and food was good at least. Never go on a busy day, or you will face the quality of food and cleanliness of the restaurant lacking.  Better off going to Americana Cheesecake Factory."
Carolyn L.,"Arcadia, CA",37,71,149,2.0,12/22/2017,"Food: Good Service: TERRIBLE Atmosphere: Dark, Loud Chipotle chicken pasta: yummy, definitely try 2 stars because the food isn't bad or else I'd give it 1 STAR ONLY. Boyfriend and I came here for a dinner date. The wait to be seated for dinner around 7:45 pm was 45 minutes, so we decided to go to the bar and find self seating. Once seated, it took a good 10 minutes for a server to notice us and to clean the table from the previous people. We got our menu's and ordered fairly quickly but, we did not receive utensils, appetizer plates, or the complimentary bread that they typically hand out once you've been greeted. We had to ask for them ourselves after aimlessly waiting for a good 7 minutes. We also ordered drinks but, those did not come out for over 25 minutes. I understood they were busy, but that does not give them an excuse when I've been to much busier restaurants and have received better service. The food came out shortly after which was great, but our server NEVER came up to ask if we needed anything else or how the food was. We ate for a good 30 minutes without any contact. We even had to wave our server down to look at a desert menu and order. Those occurred on two separate occasions too. We almost just gave up on ordering dessert but, my boyfriend never had a cheesecake from here so I wanted him to try one obviously cos they are good. But, OMG, you do NOT even want me to get started on how terrible it was to get our check. It took forever to find our sever to ask for our check. Then, it took about 15 minutes to actually receive it and ANOTHER 10 minutes for the server notice us waving him down and process it. We could have dined and ditched!! Your food is good Cheesecake Factory but, please, train your employees better!! I won't be coming back here unless the service improves by an extraordinary amount."
Glenn A.,"Los Angeles, CA",725,468,3062,4.0,11/5/2017,"This location is very unique. You enter from the first floor and go up a long flight of stairs to the second floor where the bar and dining area are located at. If you are fortunate like us, you will get seated in the patio area overlooking the shopping center where you get a view of the stores and people walking around. As with every Cheesecake Factory location, the food is consistent. The service on the other hand, could be different from location to location. Luckily for us we didn't experience any issues with service that other Yelpers have experienced. The service was good as we expected."
Mariana G.,"Galt, CA",0,1,1,1.0,1/7/2018,I would never do this but the service was HORRIBLE . My friend and I came here for his birthday and from the moment we got there the hosts were very blunt and unhelpful. We got a table and our waitress (Mia) was the worst waitress I've very had. She was very un energetic it felt like she was just trying to rush us out . We got a dirty dish for our edamame and through out the whole dining experience Mia did not smile once & when I asked for the check she smiled and sounded relieved that we were leaving . She brought me the check and took the plates from the table and my friend wasn't done with his burger so he was left with 1/3 of his burger in his hand . We walked out after paying and not even a goodbye was said .
Shelby J.,"Lakewood, CA",44,149,485,3.0,9/24/2017,"Okay so every time I visit the Cheesecake Factory at any of the locations I am left highly disappointed and the Grove location is no exception! The wait at this location is a very long wait, but they supply you with a pager that allows you to go a pretty far distance so you can do a little shopping while you wait.  The staff here is a little rude and some of them are impatient and seem like they just hate their jobs. We were seated on the balcony and it was a pretty hot day so it was uncomfortable and crowded. Our waitress seemed a little off and was not very attentive. And for some reason I always feel like these restaurants are a little dirty! We ordered peach bellinis which were too sweet and tasted like they had zero alcohol. They also took forever to come out. The food was just very bland and not good. I decided to order the fish tacos and they were a little cold when they arrived to the table. The fish was not crispy and a little soggy. They just seemed flavorless. The only reason I gave this place another chance was because I was given a gift card. Do yourself a favor and try one of the other thousand restaurants in the area. This restaurant isn't worth the time or money."
Sayan P.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",38,3,3,3.0,12/25/2017,"Food is phenomenal. But service was kinda slow and disappointing. It was Christmas Eve so we had to wait for an hour to get seats, which is acceptable. We got seated and placed order but order took way too long to reach our table. The drinks itself took good half an hour. Worst thing was after getting our appetizers, waitress never came to ask if needed anything else. When we ask to order our mains, we were told kitchen is closed. We should have notified at least. Luckily we got the cheesecakes we wanted.  But overall the food was delicious but service needs to keep up with it."
Julius Patrick V.,"Irvine, CA",385,212,157,3.0,11/24/2017,"Came here while I was venturing out at The Grove for the first time, however there was a Dancing with the Stars event going on and it was super crowded. My girlfriend and I just snuck in and sat down at one of the tables near the bar and none of the servers noticed. We ordered a drink and some buffalo blasts as appetizers. We were in a rush to just get food, validate our parking, and leave to go somewhere later that evening. However because it was so packed, our planned 10 min dinner took about 30-40 min in total. Key Tip: Try not to come here while it's packed, or if there's an event going on. Our service took forever unfortunately."
Sirimas N.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,45,195,1.0,12/20/2017,"Tonight have A Bad day here. I've guests from Asia come to visit on holiday, we pick dinner at here. But we got **Unpleasant Experience** 1st The customer service was horrible, they put us wating 55+5 min but when is our time,  they give the seat to a group come after us and we've the same a group of 5 person too, **No professional at all** I ask them, What 's happend ?

Shelley H.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",62,3,1,3.0,1/7/2018,"J our server was phenomenal!! Our choice for breakfast meats didn't exist One would think in a restaurant of this caliber and location, that something other than ham or pork sausage would be available. Nope. Nothing. Come on Cheesecake Factory!! Get with the program. You do it on other items. Help us eat breakfast better. Thanks!!"
Fran V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",325,156,320,5.0,11/11/2017,This Cheesecake Factory compared to others has the best balcony outside seating possible. I got seated outside and it was a perfect view to everything on the grove strip. The food was great and our server was pleasant and accommodating. My mojito was amazing too.
Michael S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1013,373,297,3.0,10/29/2017,"I've always enjoyed my time at the Cheesecake Factory in the Grove. It's always been a pretty solid spot to eat. And it still is. But the idiot waiter named Juan really needs to be fired. I asked the dude for a refill and he refused. Literally said he's incapable of doing so. The woman next to him gave me one. Juan is a genuine idiot and a lazy employee. Don't be like Juan.  Outside of him, ""and also our non-existent waiter which was the reason I had to go get my own refill in the first place"", I would've given it a 4 star rating.  Get your shit together Cheesecake Factory. You've got prime real estate at the grove. Don't let lazy ass waiters ruin it.  Still tipped tho cuz I'm not a dick."
HM J.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,62,427,5.0,10/20/2017,"Long time diner and first time reviewer for the one and only the Cheesecake Factory. The Cheesecake Factory is a great place for family/friends gatherings, celebrations, and dates. Please keep in mind there will be a wait time (unless you choose to sit by the bar, first come first serve), which I don't mind because you can window shop or read a book to pass the time at Barnes and Noble. Ambiance here is always on point, with decent service.  I have been coming here since the golden days, and it has not been long since I discovered their chicken and shrimp gumbo. Perhaps it's my favorite dish of all time here which I highly recommend. Their sauce is absolutely delicious, words cannot describe how awesome it tastes. Their chicken is tender, shrimp is gorgeous, and it all goes great with perfectly steamed white or brown rice. Their steak Diane, and BBQ ribs are also great alternatives depending on your mood. Their nachos are awesome too for sharing. Ask for ranch sauce so you can dip their wheat bread in it. Try not to finish it or you will be too full by the time the main dish arrives. There's never any room left in my stomach for some cheesecake lol."
Darien C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3012,223,141,5.0,7/3/2017,"Definitely a nice vibe and an upscale looking restaurant. Walking in I was surprised to see that the entire restaurant is on the second level. I always thought they had two levels, but there's is in fact only one. They have an escalator and a staircase so take your pick on how you choose to get up there. Also, there is an elevator off to the left hand side if you would like to go that route.  We just came here for a few drinks and dessert so we sat at the bar. Nice low lighting ambiance and the service was great! Francisco was our server for the night.  He was attentive and made sure to get our drinks and desserts to us in a timely manner. I ordered the strawberry daiquiri and the White chocolate raspberry cheesecake to go along with it. Loved the drink! Tasted great and was made super quick.  The cheesecake was perfect. It wasn't too rich, the white chocolate didn't overpower the entire cheesecake so it was the perfect amount of sweet. Paired with my drink it was delicious!  Would definitely come back here for a drink or for dessert. I'm not too fond of their dinner menu so I'll stick to the sweets and the alcohol!"
PurpleRain R.,"Ladera Heights, Los Angeles, CA",3,74,29,1.0,1/6/2018,"This was second visit here. The guest I was with had a gift card so we decided to go here. Once again, this location was a disappointment. First we had to sit outside, we were not told my the hostess that we would have to sit outside/balcony. So we were cold sitting there no sofa were available inside for at least an hour. My food was not lukewarm and my order was incorrect. The waitress only visited our table to bring us our food...will not visit this location again."
Melissa G.,"Studio City, CA",155,165,1216,3.0,7/9/2017,"Make time if you're going to come to this location on a weekend. The Grove, as lovely as it is, is still a tourist trap and jammed on the weekends. They do validate, but I still had to pay $6 for 90 mins.  I came with a party of five and we had a 46-60 minute wait. Very small waiting area, so we waited outside in the summer heat. Once our buzzer was rang, we were instructed to go to the restaurant upstairs and check in at the left. We were seated in a booth but please note that this location is LOUD with echoes so it's very hard to hear and worse if your server can't hear you - because she didn't hear me ask for the additional $3.50 chicken in my super antioxidant salad. I wasn't mad, just not full!  The $10.95 antioxidant salad itself is mostly leaves and and broccoli. I think I counted three pieces of avocado and very little of anything else that was advertised on the menu (pears, grapes, blueberries, etc). I left disappointed with this choice, unfortunately.  The rest of my party seemed satisfied: the club (first we were under the impression it came with fries but does not), classic burger, BBQ Ranch chicken salad and chicken Thai coconut lime chicken seemed to be great.  So yes, I would be flexible to come be here if others want to, but not my first choice. Just very distractible ambiance wise which makes snafus prone to happen."
Adrian Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,48,6,1.0,12/3/2017,"I have not eaten at this particular Cheesecake Factory in 7 to 8 years. The customer service was horrible. I had an impolite and unpleasant experience. My first waiter acted as if he did not care and put my order in wrong. My waiter was going on break and another waiter took over. The second waiter did not have any manners and was nonchalant. I informed the manager and he was extremely kind along with responsive. I received a discount on my meal. Due to the crowdedness from THE GROVE and frequent customers, the staff is too busy to pay attention to customer's needs. I will not come back again to this location and don't recommend it to others."
Mickey L.,"Moreno Valley, CA",154,126,1119,3.0,7/3/2017,"One word: Slow Everything about this place is slow. There are too many people coming to this location, so the wait is long. Takes forever to get seated after you go up stairs. Servers seem over worked because they take forever to take your order or get you anything. Pretty much have to flag them down because they rarely have time to check up on you. Food is standard Cheesecake Factory so it is good. Favorite was the Avacodo Egg Rolls Overall pretty average."
Anna N.,"Pasadena, CA",48,202,128,2.0,10/9/2017,"It must have been over a decade since I've eaten at a Cheesecake Factory. I wanted to visit a pop up shop at The Grove (first time at The Grove, shopping plazas and places where everyone wants to go all at once in general are not really my thing although I could be describing all of LA save for a few precious square feet) and my friend wanted to eat here. It was a 25 minute wait for a table of two and we considered and later regretted just not walking one block to the Farmer's Market at The Grove.  My first impression of this place is that it's ""like a theme park restaurant"" - and my friend pointed out how a line on the escalator to the second floor looked like people were in fact on a ride. Macaroni Grill is comparable food wise but just does such a much better job with food and ambience. After 25 minutes of waiting people ride the escalator to wait 10-15 more minutes.  The low ratings is primarily due to the drink menu coupled with the greasiness of the tables and floors. I felt like I was eating somewhere in Chinatown where at least it's remotely acceptable and part of the atmosphere. But the light brown tables really brought out the greasy look. Walking to the restroom was greasy. I was wearing mule flats with a reliable bottom tread and the floor was greasy enough to make the trip to the restroom a bit precarious in terms of slippage potential and felt my step slide at least twice. I hate greasy places. The ""blood orange margarita"" was a joke that went unfinished. Wrong taste, wrong glass. Avoid their cocktails at all costs and just go for draft beer or wine.  Their food was the only good thing - their infamous brown bread and butter. I had the jambalaya pasta and it was scientifically perfect. Their food undeniably has the taste of several food scientists sweating over recipes and testing them before putting it onto their ever changing menu. That's really the only interesting thing about this place. I compare it to McDonald's and use the same term: ""eatability."" The food has high eatability - you can eat a lot of their huge portions before being sated and even when sated want to eat just a bit more. It isn't necessarily the best food by all standards but boy is it so...eatable. And I don't mean edible...eatable foods are foods that create their own standard rather than adhere to traditional standards and emphasize the most base human cravings and turn those up a notch. The balance of color, of ingredients, of texture, of ease of transporting food from plate to mouth and the art of shape/portioning - it is all down to a measured science and I gotta say that in itself is pretty respectable and fascinating. Eatability is all about being too good to be authentic. That said, I probably will never come back even if there is a time and place for eatable foods."
Koi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",244,518,1171,1.0,5/29/2017,"Service is horrible at this location. You can sit there and wait and nobody comes to greet you or ask you if you need a menu or water. We sat and waited for about 45 minutes and still nobody came to help, so I had to flag someone down and finally someone came to take our order!! They'reThey are very rude here I understand that they get super busy but it's not a way to treat the customer !!  I will never return!  Drinks were horrible and so was the food!   Don't get me wrong I love Cheesecake Factory, just not this location"
Hannah P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",387,65,108,5.0,6/19/2017,"The great thing about the Cheesecake Factory is that they somehow manage to replicate their brand, excellent customer service, and delicious food at every location across the US. This franchise at the Grove is no exception.  While my roommate and I just briefly stopped in to pick up a to-go order, the staff was very helpful and friendly and the ambiance was exquisite. You enter and there is a grand escalator to take you up to the dining area. To the right there is a large glass window which overlooks the movie theater-- the aesthetic is simply perfect.  While we didn't have the luxury of enjoying our meal in this environment, they managed to package the meals in a way that maintained expectations. This location makes the cheesecake factory really stand out and I would highly recommend going! Truly an experience."
John H.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,33,,2.0,12/2/2017,An example of high volume poor service. The wait is outrageous considering the quality of service and then the food. Largely tasteless with exceptional poor service means that if you were paying for a restaurant by the minute you would be over paying. A chain that has lost its values and service. Go somewhere else if you enjoy good food and good service.
Crystal M.,"Los Angeles, CA",363,75,149,2.0,5/1/2017,"I have mixed feelings about this Cheesecake Factory. I mean the location is great! It's right inside The Grove, which makes it a great place to eat at after a movie or after shopping BUT the service is slow. It took our waiter forever to bring drinks for the kids at our table. Our waiter rarely checked up on us. He only made it a point to make sure we knew he was going on break. That was it.  Also, I find it disappointing that the other waiters wouldn't even help out. I know we're not in your assigned area, but we had two kids who were so thirsty and needed water. I wish they staff had a more team player approach. Besides the slow service, the food was alright. I did really enjoy the calamari! That was tasty! Other than that nothing else stood out so if you plan on going, order the calamari!"
Julia V.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,67,142,4.0,10/30/2017,"We came here today on a Sunday evening around 7:30 pm. It was very crowded and we had to wait 45 minutes. The table we were seated was very small and we had to constantly move our dishes and drinks from left to right so that everything fits on the table. Because the restaurant was so full, it was also very loud and hard to have a conversation. Maybe not the best choice to come here on a Sunday evening, at least not if you want to have a little bit more relaxed time. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, BBQ chicken pizza and the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake. The food was very delicious and our waitress Allison was friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back and also try out other dishes and other cheesecake factory locations."
C G.,"Washington, DC",0,33,2,3.0,11/20/2017,"So, I have to write this review or else you will not know what to expect.   So tonight I cannot seem to shake this migraine headache and decided to self-diagnose the reason for it and decided I had not eaten correctly today.  Used a dash app to order tonight. 11.20.2017 For starters, one has to understand that The Cheesecake Factory's ""specialty"" is CHEESECAKE and yes they master cheesecake EXTREMELY well.  However, I could never give their food outside of the cheesecake a five-star rating, regardless of the location. Which brings me to my order tonight. I settled for the Shephard's Pie.  I TOTALLY LOVE the Irish version of the Shephard's Pie but decided to try this one due to the veggie content. Flavor - excellent (1 star) Food Quality - excellent (1 star) Ingredients - partially acceptable but questionable. (-1 star)  Cheesecake (Didn't order this time, but the Keylime Cheesecake is ALWAYS a star. (1 star) No need to dwell on Flavor and Food Quality as each held it's own.  Now the ingredients, well let's just say I renamed it the Mushroom Pie instead of Shepherd's pie. Who made the cook mad tonight and caused him to pour approximately 2 cups of mushrooms in a to go order size of the Shepherd's Pie.  Clearly, it was not made to order and given that, I can only imagine how many mushrooms were used for this pie.  Visual:  standard saucer sized portion with 1/4 cups of medium to large sized cooked mushrooms.  This is the amount I removed from the saucer-sized portion.  But where was the beef?  Yes, beef was in the pie, but more mushrooms than beef were alarming.  The beef is the base of a Shephard's Pie, not vegetables primarily the mushrooms.   So, if you LOVE mushrooms. order the mushroom pie, aka Shephard's Pie on the menu,  the next time you order and you will be delighted.   **Please omit typos as I still have a migraine."
Andy J G.,"Mount Olympus, CA",159,22,6,2.0,11/20/2017,"Seated upstairs close to the door we were freezing cold Ask to change table, our waiter refused have to spend all diner with our coats . Waited 10 min for a mojito, actually arrived after my food not good . My burger arrived without fries, been told they made fresh ones, well I was done with my burger the fries finally arrived, it's frozen fries :( takes 5 min to cook them anyway really bad experience for my first time at the Cheesecake Factory"
Rini M.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,68,112,2.0,11/10/2017,"I had been coming here for so many times. This is the first time ever i got a very bad service. Me and my 2 boys (age 4) went there last night. We sat down and the server came and said he'll be there soon. I was waiting then he came to asked us for drinks order . I already knew what i want so i ordered everything right away.  Usually Whenever we wait for the main dish, we always got the bread first. The drinks came out very fast. Then we were waiting for 15 mins until the main dish came out. Still no bread. I asked for the bread to the other server ( i don't know where our server was ) ... half way through our main dish the bread finally came out. Boooo  After that the server MIA again ... until we almost finish our main dish . I even have to asked other server to call our server ... i asked him to just pack the dessert that i order for to go.  I don't know if it's because he thinks i was only with 2 little kids so i will not spent so much money there or because he's so busy . But i spent $38.45 in total so i think i had the right to get good service right ?  He's like totally ignoring us the half time we were there ....  Oh well ... maybe it's just not my night .  Foodwise ... i have no complaints. Always so good. My new fav menu is Chicken Riesling  ( do i write it right? ) . And of course the cheesecakes are always the bomb. Tiramisu cake always the best ."
Becca S.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,117,127,4.0,5/16/2017,"Very impressed - came here with 20+ individuals for my friend and I's graduation dinner, and they executed!  Everyone's dish was indescribably delicious. Maybe it's because we were starving and had lunch around 4? Nah.  If you're a seafood lover, you have to - have to - order the Jambalaya. It's full of flavors with a hint of Cajun. I modified it and got rice instead of pasta (my friend got pasta and liked mines better) and only asked for shrimp in it (chicken and shrimp also tastes good). Ooo, don't be a fool and forget the Calamari Bites. Sometimes you get more batter than calamari but not here!  Our servers were also phenomenal at bring us the complimentary bread - yassssssss, bless. The only weird/annoying was that the bartender kindly asked us not to order drinks from the bar but at the table. A bar is a place designed for individuals to order drinks at - sorry. We were ordering drinks in intervals, so it didn't make sense to flag down the server every time we wanted to order one, two or four drinks. The funny thing was, it wasn't even busy at the bar."
James W.,"West Hollywood, CA",2665,1908,8066,3.0,7/13/2017,I like cheesecake factory's in general. The food is decent and decently priced. The service here was actually really good and the wait was about 40 minutes on a weeknight. They validate the parking but it'll still be about $6 to park in the garage.  The restaurant is on the second floor while the check in is on the first. The dishes are your standard but I felt the chicken to be a bit tough and some were slightly overbreaded. Not bad but also not as tender as some of the other locations I've been to. Cheesecake was still bomb though.
Maxima M.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,11,5.0,11/6/2017,"Great place to grab something to eat. We got there around 3:30 so there was LITERALLY no line and no wait to get seated. That was a huge plus+.  Beautiful place, great atmosphere, beautiful roof decor, lights were dim so perfect place for a date or to hang out with friends. As opposed to other places it was actually not too loud or noisy. There wasn't even the occasional plates being dropped so good job Cheesecake Factory. Staff was on point brought us warm bread basket (both white and oat) with butter and took our drink order. Server said food would be out in 15 minutes and guess what....it legit came within that time.  So happy cause we were both hungry. Server was so nice and always gave a warm smile.  Had a great experience! Before we left server reminded us to validate which i thought was a kind gesture. We'll definitely be back to this location."
Jamie B.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,1,3.0,12/30/2017,This place Is located at the grove.   Ordering to go is a hassle to pick it up.   The environment is always hectic !!! There is a guarantee wait for in house dining.  The food is just ok.  The service at this location is always pleasant.   The seating is very close together.  Not good for a romantic date or hanging with friends.  It's just to congested. It's full of people at all times.
Adrianna C.,"Los Angeles, CA",182,65,153,3.0,11/9/2017,"Wait is always long at cheesecake this is the biggest reason for the three stars, food options are never-ending, service was great which is unusual it can be a hit or miss depending on how good a shift the server is having LOL.... I had the three cheese pasta with chicken, hubby had the jambalaya, baby had the spaghetti ( which is pretty big for a kid so this is good they can have leftovers the next day) everything tastes good pretty basic  so no complaints.  We had no problems at all this time around, really enjoyed our dinner and will be back,  I mean it's the Cheesecake Factory they're Nationwide it's a chain of them can't really go wrong here"
Hanna H.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,87,133,5.0,8/18/2017,"The restaurant is on the 2nd floor. There's an escalator you can take if you go inside the building. The waiting time depends on the time of the day and on the day of the week. But if you are there for dinner, you will probably have to wait at least 30+ min. For appetizer, I would highly recommend ordering the warm crab and artichoke dip. It's delicious, but a bit oily. It comes with toast on the side."
Elianna B.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/28/2017,"We had an amazing server (Rachel) who was great the entire night and the amazing food like always. The wait was 1.5 hours which isn't surprising from this specific Cheesecake Factory since it's in the middle of The Grove. We ordered the Thai wraps, the Farfalle and the Bistro Shrimp pasta (forgive me if I spelled these wrong). All the food was delicious and I was so full by the end of the night. I also ate around 4 loaves of their wheat bread which is to die for!! Highly recommend going here and shopping while waiting for the time to pass."
Maria C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,42,13,3.0,8/27/2017,Waited 40 minutes to seat 2 people on a Saturday night. Waiter was great but did not come around to us often so had to keep calling him for more refills. It took us 20 minutes to get a check. Service was so slow even though we were there pretty late.  Food is decent.  They do validate.  Floors are greasy so be careful not to fall.
Jamila V.,"Los Angeles, CA",227,166,319,3.0,1/1/2017,"Since this location is at the always busy Grove, it's always packed.  Hubby and I decided to come here and use a gift card we'd received a few months back. We're huge fans but we both took the day off and it was during the holidays so it was a special occasion, or something of the sort.  We arrived around 1:45pm and the wait time for a table for two was 60 minutes. INSANE right?! What sucked is that their pager system wasn't working and they don't have a call/text feature so we pretty much just had to hang around and keep checking the list to see where we were. If it wasn't for that dang gift card we totally would've left.  Once we we were called 75 minutes later, we were told to go upstairs and the hostess would seat us. Well apparently there was a miscommunication bc when we went upstairs we had to wait another 5-10 minutes bc there wasn't a table ready for us.  I ordered the two mojitos, buffalo blasts and garlic noodles with shrimp. Hubby ordered a strawberry milkshake, fried Mac n cheese and fettuccine Alfredo. The bill was $155 and it kind of shocked me. I was thinking maybe $100 but $155 for the quality and portions we received def was not worth it.  Our waitress was clearly over booked. Anytime you have to flag down a busboy cleaning another table to ask for a refill on your water that's a problem! The only real Pros were the two mojitos. They were delicious and since I hit the skinny version they were under 150 cals!  Doubt we'll be visiting anytime soon. TBH I'd only come back with a gift card."
Adrineh A.,"Pasadena, CA",0,9,4,1.0,12/21/2017,"Extremely bad service!  It was my mom's memorial and 5 sisters decided to have lunch at one of our's and her favorite restaurant yesterday at the Grove around 3 PM.   We ordered a big mixed salad to share, but they brought the salad with no plates and no serving utensils.  We had to use our bread plates to eat our salad and our own forks to serve. Then we ordered 3 herb crusted Salmon and 2 steak Diane's with no onions; one well done and one medium well.  First they brought the 3 herb crusted salmon, one of which was not fully cooked (I found out later after we left - if not I would have returned it), which my sister did not eat.   Then there was about 7 minutes gap and they brought the well done steak, and it had the ONIONS ... another 5 minutes goes by, and finally my medium well steak shows up, totally well done!  Eeks ...  The meat was not the prime meat that I had the pleasure of experincing in their other locations.  It was fatty, chewy and poorly cut (more like a stew meat than steak meat) and very poor presentation (stew of something) - NOT their usual appetizing and mouth watering display of food.   When I called to express my dissatisfaction, the answer was I am so sorry ... really?   The bigger they become the less quality they offer and they treat the patrons that they don't know the art of dining and the fact that a family eats together, not one person at a time. Almost similar thing happened last year at the Americana location during dinner hours around X-Mas and I let it go then, but it seems this is becoming a norm for them.  So sorry to see such poor management!"
Brooke Z.,"Beverly Hills, CA",392,44,120,5.0,6/20/2017,"Is it just me or is The Cheesecake Factory wildly underrated?! Their menu is more expansive than almost any other restaurant I can think of, and the food is GOOD. Honestly I would just go for how great the appetizer bread is!  Real talk, the portions are very generous for a price that will not break your budget! Have you tried their Chinese Chicken Salad?! Only $15 and that thing is the size of 3 meals!  Another one of my favorite things this restaurant provides is the Skinnylicious menu! I adore the Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps - light and delicious! Another one of my favorites that you have to try if you haven't yet-- (not on the Skinnylicious menu) Mac n cheese balls! So great for a shareable appetizer!  This location at the Grove - just like every other Cheesecake location I've visited - has a beautiful ambiance full of classy decor and a helpful/friendly/professional staff. Whether you're going for a drink and cheesecake or a decadent meal - you'll enjoy your Cheesecake Factory experience!"
Aram K.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,13,1,1.0,5/7/2017,"If you want terrible service and food that is mediocre then this is the right place. Cheesecake Factory is a brand and unfortunately not quality for more than a decade.  I went to the grove to eat at the steak house, but  they closed. Seems like every restaurant here only lasts a few years at tops. So I was forced to go there. Unfortunately I was let down yet again. I ordered Hibachi Steak Med-rare and got med- well.  Also the mashed potatoes were cold. Lack of Presentation. Typical and upsetting. For paying over $20+ I personally think I would of enjoyed a double whopper from burger king more than I did here. Never Again will I make the same mistake. Another thing is sanitation. Tables are dirty, 2nd floor balcony glass was dirty, which unfortunately my sweater would rub against while I was crunched seated in a tiny space. :(  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(:( :( :( :(:("
Luis H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",411,416,1611,5.0,11/19/2016,"When we came in the Cheesecake Factory we were sat very quickly, we sat inside and had the best server ever. Yasmin was quick and very polite. Outstanding customer service, she brought bread automatically and we ordered drinks and appetizer. The food was good but the service made it outstanding. She checked on us and made sure our food was okay and brought bread and refilled drinks throughout the service.  The nachos was a big plate and enough for two people. The cheese was decent but the chicken and guacamole was very good! The salmon was cooked well and had good flavor. The calamari were delicious but came out too oily and the skin was coming off. Overall good service."
