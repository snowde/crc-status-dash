Jen H.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",310,237,1212,4.0,12/28/2015,"Decided to come here since my boyfriend and I were hungry when we got to The Grove and it was the first restaurant we saw. Entered, and there were quite a few people waiting in the lobby. Put down our name and was told to return in 40 minutes to get a buzzer. This was fine since we wanted to explore The Grove in all its Christmas-ey glory! Returned after 40 minutes, received our buzzer, and was told it was going to be another 20 minutes or so. We decided to wait outside since it was crowded in the lobby. After about a minute, the remote started going off and I assumed they were just starting it up. We go inside anyways and are told to go upstairs!! Score :) We wait just a few more minutes upstairs and then get seated! Our waiter, Jimmy, was great and took good care of us. He had excellent customer service skills and checked on us just enough times.  I ordered the garlic noodles with no meat. It was nice and simple.. just the way I like it. Don't forget to soak the noodles in the sauce every now and then for some more flavor. Had a few bites of the Hibachi steak, which was cooked just right. I also ordered the white sangria. It was light and refreshing. Good food, good service!"
Jacqueline S.,"Rialto, CA",82,15,,4.0,5/25/2017,Had the gumbo and it was really good.  Lunch with my coworkers and everyone said their food was good.
Eldor Y.,"Leominster, MA",7,17,,2.0,1/30/2017,"Taste is ok! They have to do smth with a line and waiting time, I understand that they have a lot of customers, but whats the all point to wait outside and wait again when you sat. Been there with wife and waited 30 min to get a call, and they made us to wait another 30 min until they figure out who is our server is!"
Stevie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,13,,3.0,3/9/2017,"The wait here on a weekend evening is never gonna be under 1 hour for a table for 2 so don't get your hopes up to get your food very quickly. It is good food though! I had the chicken fettuccini alfredo which was pretty bomb. My girlfriend got a salad with chicken and some crunchy onion ring-type-things on top - also good. After we were seated though our waitress didn't come back to take our order for a little while, and we kept having to go to great lengths to get our drinks refilled. I will definitely come to this location again, but I would avoid it during peak hours, especially if you are hungry, haha."
Jibri B.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,22,1,4.0,6/5/2017,This location has to be my favorite. Great staff and nice vibe. I just wish they gave samples of the cheesecake lol.
Judith G.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,3/15/2017,"Great food and drinks and always friendly waiters in the bar area. The margaritas and buffalo blasts are amazing! The front desk needs some work, I understand the restaurant gets busy at times but guests should always be acknowledged. The last time I went to this location the host didn't even look up to ask my name just kept typing on his computer screen. *Easy fix-go straight to the bar area, you will more than likely find a spot and not have to wait or deal with unfriendly host(s)."
Jordan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",457,79,448,4.0,5/22/2015,"I had the ahi tuna salad. The portion was pretty big, as usual for cheesecake. The sauce on the side that came with it was amazing. The weird part was that they gave me tomato slices and avocado slices on the side so I had to cut them and add them into the salad.  We got our table much sooner than expected too."
Jasmine F.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",10,4,,3.0,5/22/2017,"Always good to come to any Cheesecake Factory. Great service, yummy food but  average drinks."
Eryn C.,"Central LA, West Hollywood, CA",0,2,1,1.0,6/17/2017,"(1) the line was a 40 minute wait before our buzzer went off, when the buzzer went off and we went upstairs and (2) waited an additional 15 mins before being seated (3) the food took 40 minutes to come and then  (4) tab took me reminding the waiter  twice and another waitress... honestly you'd do better a McDonald's ."
Jazz G.,"Hawthorne, CA",129,48,38,1.0,1/8/2017,"This rating is based upon the wait time. We were told that there would be a 40 minute wait when 40 minutes hit we had to go back downstairs to ask was our buzzer broken. Come to find out they are running about 20 minutes behind because ""guests are sitting where they shouldn't be."" The issue is that you should give a higher wait time than a lower one. My husband has to eat in order to take his medication and now we have to wait another 20 minutes or more. We've just been standing because there is no seating in the wait area or the bar... this is bad service at its best.... maybe this will change once we are seated"
Gigi D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1036,660,3188,4.0,12/11/2015,"It had been a long time since I ate at a Cheesecake Factory... All I remember is the large and in charge portion sizes that even filled ME UP... So when it was suggested we hit up Cheesecake Factory for lunch, I agreed, with subtle excitement because I wanted to see what the latest was at the chain restaurant.  Well, bring your reading glasses because when you're seated, an ANTHOLOGY is given to you.... Full of delicious sounding fare and photos. Luckily for me, I was very much drawn to the ""Skinnylicious"" menu, thus I only had to read two pages of menu items... That being said, I still struggled to pick what I wanted... The chicken lettuce tacos or the large salad with salmon... I went with the latter because when do I ever crave chicken over salmon?  My dining companion got some chicken dish, the first menu item on page 11, without the mushroom sauce... But for starters, he got a slice of STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE. Clearly he's living the YOLO LIFE. Ha! Everything was up to par however, of course, some of the toppings I wanted included on my salad were taken off (Womp) and the piece of salmon wasn't as big as I was hoping... But oh well, maybe I should start training my stomach to eat smaller portions...? Ahhhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!! When all was said and eaten, we left the Cheesecake Factory bellies full (and a doggy bag for HIM... Pussy) and I do recall myself saying, ""we can totally add The Cheesecake Factory"" to the list of places we go again... After all, I still have to try those chicken tacos!"
S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,155,123,5.0,10/22/2016,"Love the Cheesecake Factory. Always something for everyone, even my 88 yr old dad who only likes Chinese food!  My current fav dish is the eggplant Parmesan. The Chinese chicken salad always good.  Great service, great food. This location, all the staff are nice and welcoming. Thank you CF"
Batavia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",549,75,73,1.0,7/1/2016,"So the story goes like this, a day before I called this location to make a reservation and I was told no reservation, first come first serve, I was ok with that but the fact that the lady who answered the phone told me they have lobster but when I came the day after with my visitors from Australia who wanted lobster we found out NO LOBSTER, management please teach your staff what to say and know their shit!!!!!"
Amee S.,"Riverside, CA",4,6,1,2.0,2/20/2017,"Service was slow. The server was obviously overwhelmed so we were not attended to adequately. He forgot several things. Our drinks, bread , and place settings. Food wasn't hot."
Uliana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,18,14,5.0,11/8/2016,"I've everything about this place. Location, waiters, surrounding area, comfy, nice, clean. Never wait too long even in the evenings. Love food, especially Thai glazed salmon and all pastas there. Of course cheesecakes is really gooood. Just try it. Price is reasonable."
Michelle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,37,27,4.0,9/29/2016,"We went around 8:30pm on a Wed night. I read one of the reviews with a reply from the management that advised us to come after 9pm to avoid crowding. We were promptly sat in 20mins after the front told us there was a 25min wait. We had this carpaccio(?) appetizer that was really good. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon and I had the Louisiana pasta. I had the pasta before at Santa Clara and really liked it but it wasn't as good here. It was kind of lacking but I still enjoyed it very much! My bf's mignon was supposed to be medium but it was a bit dry and well done unfortunately. Still, the meat was good quality and the mashed potatoes was really good! The servers were nice and attentive. I love this location! We were seated outside and had a nice view of the Apple store lols. It was nice."
David R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/12/2017,Great service. The food portions are huge. Def order the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake off the hook. Wished they took reservations but we'll be returning !
Cindy Z.,"San Francisco, CA",866,705,1110,4.0,9/1/2016,"This is a great spot for happy hour. The bar seating is first come, first serve. I ordered a Mint Mojito and Long Island Iced Tea ($6 each), which were both very refreshing and delicious. To share amongst me and my two friends, we ordered the Lobster and Artichoke Dip ($6). This was really good and you can taste the chunks and flavors of the lobster. I looked over at another table's plate of nachos, which looks huge too! It is definitely comparable to Yardhouse's nachos, so that's definitely something I'll order next time."
Ralph H.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,428,976,3.0,11/18/2015,"So, I hadn't visited this place in years, I was reminded why. Now its not necessarily the food is bad or even the service. For me, the wait time, the level of service and food is just not up to par with what you pay for. I came here because my sister wanted to come here for her birthday, and the birthday girl gets what the birthday girl wants.  First, Wait time is ridiculous, we waited roughly an hour for a table of 4. Then when we were helped we still waited another 15 minutes for them to clean the table and walk us over.  The food here is good, not my personal choice because it is on the heavy side for sure. I guess the cheesecakes are to ""die"" for apparently but I don't have a sweet tooth myself. Everything came out fairly quick I will say which is good.  The staff were helpful and very nice for sure. We asked questions and they were able to answer them confidently.  I would recommend this place to anyone but only if they are not hungry yet and are willing to wait for a long time for a table. This particular location happens to get extra busy so come with plenty of time. The great thing is that there are shops you can go and spend some time while you wait. So that part is definitely a plus.  Parking is not cheap but they do validate, just don't forget to do it.  Personally I wont be back to this place unless someone absolutely must eat here."
Brandon N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/20/2017,"3 Words: Biggest Disappointment Ever. My friends and I went to cheesecake factory thinking we could get some of the ""world's best cheesecake"" as a part of a suprise birthday celebration for one friend in our group who visited from another country. As we finally found a seat to settle for a party of six, we asked the waiter for a 6 inch whole cheesecake and found out that it would take over an hour after request. (Which is a huge delay!) He then gave us time to decide if we would want to make that purchase and decided we would wait, however once he came back, he told us that we may or may not be guaranteed the cheesecake after the 1 hour wait. Because of that, we decided to leave due to the extreme disappointment that this restaurant brought us. First of all, the Cheesecake factory should always have a whole cheesecake ready to go, having every single one frozen is completely ridiculous and only shows how unprepared the restaurant is to take on the demands of its customers. It's called the cheesecake factory for a reason is it not? So how about you stop freezing the cheesecakes during open hours where some customers might want to eat it then and there. Even Marie Callanders has their pies ready to eat upon request for God sakes. Even Vons has whole cheesecakes ready to eat!! The fact that Cheesecake Factory of all places would have all their world famous whole cheesecakes frozen 24/7 is insane! Ready to eat whole cheesecakes should be available upon request!! It's not even debatable for a restaurant looking to satisfy all customers. And for this, they will forever lose a customer. Also, the fact that our cheesecake was ""not guaranteed"" according to the waiter was also completely absurd. The customer should always be placed as a priority and tonight, our group did not recieve the treatment of customer priority.    If I could rate 0/5 stars I would. Cheesecake factory really let us down, and it was embarrassing for us not to have had a whole cheesecake ready for a suprise birthday celebration. Again, completely ridiculous experience and definitely would not come back."
