Nancy S.,"Sun City, CA",18,101,176,4.0,10/28/2016,"The restaurant receives a lot of attention from tourists, because it is located in The Grove. The Grove is ""Tourist Trap Central"". I walked the streets and possibly heard English spoken every 20th person. The other 19 spoke a rainbow of languages. I LOVED IT! I have been to this restaurant more times than I can count. However, this go round, I decided to order items I have never ordered before. And, I am VERY glad I did. Do yourself a big favor and check out the Buffalo Blast and Kale Salas appetizers. My husband is a Buffalo Wing aficionado. I took some back home to San Diego, because there were way too many for me to eat. They are the best he has ever had. It eliminates the bones. There is lots of crunch and the flavor is seriously amazing. I am giving it a lesser star, because the hosts clearly put their emphasis on the tourists and ""name brand"" folks. I literally had to say hello to them before they acknowledged my presence (after 2 minutes), which I found humorous. I was dressed extremely casual. I looked very unassuming - possible frugal. However, I am a ""More Than 20% Tipper"" for quality service. Positive Note: Tarin was my server. She was extremely patient and focused on making me happy - from the moment she said hello. She did not concern herself with my appearance, which was due to me spending 5 days in Cedar Sinai Hospital, nursing my son, who is in need of his second heart transplant. So, because of her, the generous cocktail, and the fabulous food, I will definitely go back."
Felipe G.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",43,10,,3.0,6/11/2017,"The place is pretty big, and give you a buzzer that allows you to wander the grove pleasant streets while waiting it's usually big lines.  It's up to its name and you won't find most delicious cheesecakes elsewhere, surprising considering its a big chain name. Food is also very good, I have tried fish, stake, burgers and was never let down.  Being that big and always crowded waiters can suffer to provide efficient service, although they're usually very nice and you can see they're trying.  Needed to go to the restroom in one of my visits and immediately regretted, scarily nasty."
Nik E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1345,303,502,4.0,9/30/2016,"This dinner came after a day of standing in heat waiting to get into Dancing with the Stars. After a good show I would like to get some good food! Our server was Allen and he was seriously the BEST!!! He started off with giving us an unwarranted breakdown of items to choose from! LOL just his charisma took over the table and he was on a roll!! we ended up going with the wontons for the appetizer and they were really good! For the entree I chose the factory burrito grande and wished I didn't. She went with the bistro shrimp pasta, which was really really good! The factory burrito was huge but a friend of mine made a great point... Don't order mexican food unless you are at a mexican restaurant LOL and I will leave it at that! The bistro shrimp pasta was just delicious and cooked to perfection! I have no complaints at all.  If you're looking for cocktails def get the lemon drop!"
Luis M.,"South Gate, CA",39,6,4,1.0,9/6/2017,Came for lunch today and wanted to sit on the balcony since its a nice day. We were told ther were no tables available so we were seated inside. As i was walking to the restroom i noticed a few empty tables. So i asked the hostess and she said ohh we don't have waiters for thoes tables. When i told my party i was asked what does that mean?  Lets just say we walked out never again.  To bad this app don't have negative stars
Billy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,60,21,5.0,10/22/2017,We have been eating at Cheesecake Factory for years. Today while having a late lunch we were given the opportunity to be served by a BEAUTIFUL individual. Throughout the entire meal our service was IMPECCABLE...We were AMAZED at how SPUNKY & PROFESSIONAL she was. She was definitely ON HER BEST GAME. OH AND HER NAME WAS...RACHEL. Thanks
Frank S.,"Los Angeles, CA",155,172,240,4.0,12/12/2016,Great service tonight.  Enjoyed the ambiance and great customer service.  Thanks Team Cheesecake!
Chantel P.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,72,,2.0,3/16/2017,"I hate to give bad reviews but our waiter was so douchefied it was unbelievable.  So full of himself and for no apparent reason.  Good looking????   NO    Great Personality ????   NO     Great Server       Yes, and NO.    The Orange Chicken was awful.  I mean, nothing good there.  The apps we ordered were amazing as was the bread.  The cheesecake is to die for.   Our waiter was such an ass, why doesn't he go sell cars or something?  The whole experience was not worth the wait, nor the $75 bill and he was so undeserving of the amazing tip he received that he will probably not realize how bad he was.  Dude, get a personality or at least get some looks, cause ya got neither. I'll never come back, not even for dessert.  I'll eat some M&Ms which are only $1.00 a bag and then go to another place where I don't have to spend $75 for food which has a main meal which is inedible. Mr. Personality forgot to give us forks with our to go cheesecakes, so we stopped at Mickey D's and got some there.  Maybe that is where we should have eaten!!!"
Marisela B.,"Azusa, CA",47,2,,1.0,12/13/2017,"I came here with my best friend for her birthday. Coming in everything was great. The place was spectacular and all. We were impressed. We got our waitress and that's when everything went downhill. The first waitress was horrible, she did not address me only unless I spoke. She had an attitude and did not disclose that a Cheesecake slice would not be complimentary but she made it believable to be. She hardly checked up on us and we were served more by other waiters. She eventually came back and another waitress with her, Allison, who would be taking her place. Allison was kind, she gave us better service. Well the tab came and I was surprised to find out that the slice of cheesecake wasn't free so the manager named Daniel came and basically told us we should know that cheesecakes aren't free. It was my first time celebrating a birthday and I felt like it should be disclosed. He was so unprofessional and rude. Allison, a waitress, was so much more professional than him. I will not be coming back to this location ever again."
宇,"Burbank, CA",61,4,3,1.0,3/23/2017,It's too busy and it's super bad service when we arrive here we need wait 20 min and more to get the water and bread. And if we didn't tell the waiter to grab the bread to us. We will just don't have it. And we sit in a corner and we can hardly find the right waiter. And the other waiter will just say someone will be right there when we have some questions need to talk to someone.
Gray O.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,2,2,1.0,9/1/2017,So me and my best friend come down to have a favorite meal at one of my favorite places. We wait 35 min.. No problem however couple big guys get sat at this tiny table felt like for kids and the two young girls behind us got sat at a full booth. So needless to say I asked for a booth because we are about to order lots of things that can't fit on one little kid table. So they move us to this small secluded booth that has a table that same size and over the theater entrance.. Not a happy guy.. Kinda ruined my afternoon. Nevertheless we are eating at LaPizza
Joseph T.,"Lancaster, CA",6,89,234,3.0,1/5/2017,"Came to ""The grove"" with the fam on a rainy day yeah grove on a rainy day insane right already saw a accident and a whole lot of people that shouldn't be driving but still made it here.  I ordered the bang shrimp and Cuban egg roll appetizers. The family said it was greasy, the egg rolls but it was ok and the shrimp was good but not a speck of spicy heat but it was good. We also ordered Madera chicken, everything pizza lunch, and Louisiana chicken pasta. The pizza was good. Crispy crust good toppings but it's pizza, even bad pizza is good pizza. The chicken Madera was slightly dry and needed some seasonings but the potatoes and sauce were delicious. Lots of mushrooms. The Louisiana pasta was a bit disappointing. The sauce was thin so it didn't really coat the pasta and the veggies were more like a garnish then part of the dish. It was like crispy chicken and bow tie pasta noodles with veggie garnish. Sad. But, what you really come here for, cheesecake, we ordered strawberry and Apple cheesecake. Both were excellent. Totally worth ordering. We actually enjoyed the strawberry a bit more than the applewhich is surprising for us. The apple had less cheesecake and more filler. The strawberry more cheesecake with just a bit of strawberry on top.  We had a really good waiter, Amanda, who was so awesome and took really good care of us. Kudos to her!"
Sandy H.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",30,164,83,3.0,6/11/2017,"We came here in a Saturday at 11:30am for lunch and we're seated right away. After that we say and waited for over 5 minutes with a hungry toddler, no drinks, no bread, no crayons - nothing. The restaurant wasn't even that busy as there were plenty of empty tables around us. Once we ordered the food took forever. We didn't get the food until over 30 minutes later. Our server barely checked in on us and the bread that was served wasn't warm. My Thai lettuce wrap appetizer as an entree was delicious. My husband's Kobe burger looked good. The kid's butter pasta was so dry. I've had better."
2mayma ..,"Ceres, CA",0,11,11,4.0,8/15/2017,"First time going to this one. Wait time was over an hour and waiting area was tight so we had to wait outside in the summer heat, luckily it was towards the evening. When upstairs and waited some more. Lots of chatter between co-workers. They looked understaffed maybe and overwhelmed. Food was tasty. Noise level was loud. The place was crowded. I would go back there. It's great for small and large crowds."
Jennifer Y.,"Austin, TX",486,1024,9615,5.0,3/7/2017,"Although this restaurant is a chain I felt like this one was on point when it came to customer service. They have an escalator and elevator to get to the main dining area and the hostess knew that my grandparents needed to use the elevator. She was so nice and showed us right to it. Then the person who was leading us to our table realized that the seating that was given to us would be uncomfortable for our elderly family members to get situated in and changed our table before inconveniencing us with the initial one.  The food was on point as always. We got the Chicken Madeira, Thai Lettuce Wrap, Corn Tamales, and Avocado Eggrolls. The Chicken Madeira was tender, juicy, and flavorful without being salty. The lettuce wrap was super fresh and refreshing. The corn tamales were a bit over sauced and drenched in sour cream but they were still good. Avocado eggrolls were like guacamole with wrapping on them. (it could be a good or bad thing lol)  All in all we had a great time and got to stroll just enough before it got too tiring for my gpa and gma. The parking garage is quite close to the restaurant so this is definitely a plus!"
Jason P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/1/2017,This is probably the worst cheesecake location ever ! We ordered a pizza to go since the line was so long -- and I have never seen a pizza so dried up and small in my life !! It was really a waste of money and I will never visit this location again !!  P.s. I am only talking about this location cause I had great experiences on other cheesecake factories !!
Vitaliy L.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",1,3,3,5.0,5/13/2017,That's awesome!  Amazing cheesecakes! Very nice staff!  Not too long time waits on the line. Very recommended for everyone who love sweets!
Daniel B.,"Tempe, AZ",205,45,1,1.0,1/1/2018,"This place is the absolute worst. A party of 6, we've waited over an hour 45 mins to sit and just to sit not counting the time the waiter came and took our order after sitting 30 mins. We placed our order and the waiter kept just bring bread to fill us up knowing that we probably would have never gotten our order. 45 mins later we were still wondering what happened to our order. The waiter comes back and said it's coming shortly. 10 mins later we all got our order and the entire food was completely different then what we got. The orange chicken was completely blant and cold. The salad was ordered without cheese and it came with cheese. The veggie burger was completely cold and the Fries felt like it was cooked back in 2016. Overall the services was terrible because the manager made us wait more for them to bring out the new order and didn't even take of a cheesecake bill. Honestly, cooperate needs to audit this establishment and Department of Health needs to double check to see what people are doing back there. Smh never again cheesecake of Grove LA. McDonald's has better service than here."
Lou V.,"Lakewood, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/20/2017,"If I could give zero stars I would. Our server Nicole gave the poorest service ever. First she forgets to put in our order so after waiting 40 minutes she informs us that she forgot to put the order in and she will bring it out as soon as possible.  Secondly, the food came out and it was terrible. The omelette was over cooked and my salad had no taste. The lunch salad at Wendy's had more flavor than the one served.  After the food came our sever Nicolle S. neglected to come by to see if we were happy with our food. At that point we had been there for over an hour and I wasn't willing to spend more time there to send the food back and order a different dish. As a result of getting bad service and terrible food I paid my bill and left zero tip (I've only done this one other time in my entire life). That's how bad the service and quality was.  I truly feel that Nicole had plenty of opportunity to make up for her mistake. However, her actions showed that she really didn't want to be there and do a a good job. Attitude is everything and hers played definitely a key role in making this experience a negative one."
Sonya T.,"Millbrae, CA",52,50,9,3.0,2/17/2017,Of course it was packed we waited to be seated for 1.5hrs!!! Ok no big deal. We waited 45 min then came in to get the pager. I ordered medallion steak. The portion was small compared to other food sizes of cheesecake factory. The steak was really dry.  The sangria drink was good not too sweet.  Of course the cheesecake- macadamia nut white chocolate cheesecake out of this world- very delicious. Overall experience was good but i was really disappointed with size of steak and dryness
Vanda W.,"Murrieta, CA",101,2,1,1.0,8/5/2017,"We just had the worst service ever by what the manager called one of his best servers. She literally  took order and never came back until our drinks were empty, food was gone, and actually said are you still waiting on your food?  We had asked for more bread about 15 minutes prior and no one delivered.  I'm extremely embarrassed that I brought my out of state guest to visit this place and extremely dissatisfied with the service.  The other unfortunate part of this is all the manager had to say was he apologized and to please find a manager next time we visit. REALLY!?!?! Why to remind them about their terrible service?!?! I would like to give it no stars if I had the option!!!"
