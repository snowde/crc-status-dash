Mev M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/18/2013,"Im a long time customer of the Cheesecake Factory but never visited during thier Happy Hour.  I went two weeks ago and the food, drinks and service were great! We sat at the bar and ordered a variety of items. The best item on their happy hour menu by far is the crab and artichoke dip. Its served warm and it was delicious down to the last bite. We also ordered a few items off of the skinny menu there which is my favorite menu. The asian lettuce wrap tacos are really delic. We also ordered the dumplings from the happy hour menu, also good. Overall I prefer the skinny menu and my favorite item on the happy hour menu is the dip and of course the drinks at half price."
Sue K.,"Norwalk, CA",283,247,249,5.0,6/19/2008,"EXCELLENT!!! The last time I was at this Cheesecake Factory, it was a perfect dining experience. The weather was warm and I was seated at the outdoor 2nd floor patio overlooking the shops.  The waiter gave us the best service I had have at any restaurant so far. He was extremely professional, fast, friendly, efficient, and right on cue.  The menu is a mind-boggling 20 or so pages - which is half advertisements. It's OK, I dont mind them, they distract my hunger pains. I was actually pretty surprised at the prices... most dishes are $10-$20, and they give you a pretty big portion.  I ate the strawberry cheesecake. It has just the RIGHT AMOUNT OF STRAWBERRY GLAZE and three huge strawberries on it. With lots of whip cream. Oh yeah, baby."
Phil K.,"Sierra Madre, CA",0,54,2,1.0,3/4/2009,"This review is solely for the staff at this restaurant. I have never actually eatten here, but I always get it to go.  The staff at the front area, where you order stuff to go, are very slow, clueless and lazy. Im pretty sure that not all of them are like that because a few times that I had ordered to go with this african american waitress, she was very fast and friendly. But the other other ones are just very slow. Many many times, I ordered something and they never bring my order to me, EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN READY FOR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES. When I ask them if it's ready, they tell me that they are still making it without actually checking it. I COULD LITERALLY SEE MY ORDER IN THE PREPARATION AREA JUST WAITING FOR ME. After losing my patience, I ask someone who is not working at front area to get it for me. And within seconds, I have my order in my hands and the person that helped me (who had nothing to do with the mess that the ""to go"" staff made) apologize to me. And what are the ""to go"" staff doing? Just talking to each other and not doing their work, of course."
Katie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,2,1.0,10/6/2014,worst fucking cheesecake factory ever!! been here 4 times and i always get d same  bad service! even the receptionist were so lazy n rude!! this is gonna be my last time here!
Lana G.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,124,12,4.0,5/17/2011,"Huge menu - there is something there for everyone and the food is delicious! The portions are big, desserts are yummy and drinks are also great.  It's a great family restaurant and it was pretty much the only restraurant we went to when my daughter was a baby! Service is usually pretty good and it's located at the grove where lots is going on.  Sometimes a wait can be long however."
Nancy B.,"Arcadia, CA",91,50,1,4.0,4/4/2009,"What I love about the cheesecake factory: Atmosphere, service, food and drinks. My main dish of all time is Chicken Marsala its delicious, trust me I've been to other restaurants for Chicken Marsala and none so far can top cheesecake factory. I have tried so many different dishes and cheesecakes and have no complaints. BUT my #1 cheesecake is Kahlua yummy. About drinks my favorite Georgia Peach I can't leave before I have my Georgia Peach. So, if I love the cheesecake factory so much why didn't i give it 5stars-- long wait specially on fridays and wknds and the fact that they don't take reservations. Reservations would be an ""A+"" That's really the only reason. Best time to go is lunch/dinner time on weekdays..."
Jason G.,"West Hollywood, CA",45,87,4,4.0,6/23/2009,"Great food, friendly staff and nice decor.  They make the BEST dirrrrrty martini that I've ever had. (YUM!!!) Also, try the strawberry infused martini.... very unique and delicious!  The Thai Chicken Pasta and Orange Chicken dishes are to DIE for.  They recently added a new, ""Happy Hour"" menu with SUPER-low prices. Lots of great items on there that are well worth trying.  I've never once had a bad experience here."
Kat R.,"Los Angeles, CA",340,333,15,4.0,8/23/2007,"Seriously the waits for Cheesecake Factory are insane!   I refuse to wait an hour to indulge in this high end TGI Fridays.  Still for a chain, Cheesecake Factory is bomb. Good salads, cocktails, desserts -obvi-, etc. Wait staff at this location is highly attentive and fairly attractive as well. I wouldn't wait longer than 20 minutes to eat here but the food exceptionally good for a chain and thus, very relaible.   Plus, when you're done you can easily head to the shops or check out a movie."
Jason Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,213,8,4.0,12/14/2010,"The only bad thing here is that it gets crowded and is hard to find a table, but you might be able to find a couple of seats at the bar.  This place and Wood Ranch Grill are really the only good places at the Grove to eat dinner, since Farmer's market would be closed.  They also give parking validation, so don't forget to ask on your way out."
Martha M.,"New York, NY",70,374,3,2.0,11/22/2008,"I normally adore this restaurant, but this particular CF was baaad. It took almost an hour to get seated on a random Thurs. evening at 6 PM.  Ok, it was busy, but I was on the verge of fainting by the time I wolfed down the (delicious) brown bread. Ok, the service blew.  Yeah, it was busy, but the waiter was a shmuck.  He was surly and went MIA throughout the evening.  When my mom nicely mentioned the poor service to him, he said something rude in Spanish.  Yep, my mom and I both speak Spanish.  When my mom told him--in Spanish--to get his manager, he just disappeared.  And then, we had a new waiter!   WTF?"
LALANNIE L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,51,43,3.0,1/13/2009,The dreadful 40 minutes of waiting is not too bad if you go to the bookstore to browse around. I give it 3 stars because of the tiny tables we get. I went there about 20 times and half the visit was mediocre.  The food however beats Grand Lux Cafe. Try sitting outside because it's very noisy inside or get a booth table. And a precaution to all those seated near the bathrooms beware. Your waiter may be still training and may not tell you that your plate is super hot and burn your hands. GEEZ!
RoB D.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,167,14,1.0,1/18/2010,"I dunno if its just this location, the boiled in bag food or the frozen cheesecake. But every time I eat at this place.  I have a miserable night wracked with sickness.   I tried to blame it on ""well maybe the foods just to rich and meant for people who enjoy a good triple bypass surgery.."" But This has now happened 3 times So now Im writing a review.  There food is alright. Honestly I think this place should ONLY sell Booze and cheesecake.  You know... Maybe stick to something there really good at."
Mohammed B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,5,,2.0,5/31/2011,"Ok, so i love going to the Grove, it is one amazing place, from the people to the shopping stores to the lovely atmosphere. and i gotta say the Cheesecake factory there used to be my favorite spot to dine after I finish watching a nice movie at the Pacific theatre. however, this has changed, mainly because the service started getting really sloppy.  first of, the wait for a table for 4 individuals takes for ever, seriously, every single time i ago, there has to be a minimum 45 minutes wait during weekdays, and forget about weekends where it can seriously reach up to 2 hours !! 2 hours wait !!  I know it is a popular and a good restuarant, but they really need to solve this issue, find more space and expand !! second problem, most receptionist downstairs who arrange the seatings are always gloomy and in a bad mood, they seem bored and unhappy with their work, at times rude like when you ask for a seat it is like asking them a mountain to climb, there is not the smiles and greetings that i would expect from a place like this. finally the food, I have to be honest, most of the times, they make really good food here, but recently, it seems there is a drop in quality, probably because of the crowded seats and high demand. the problem i usually have is with the Fillet Mingion, I always ask for it to be well done. last time i went i asked for it to be coocked well done, but i got it medium, which happens a lot , right ? so i asked to recoock it, so it was taken and brought back few minutes later, but it was still medium !! i was like WHAT !? i asked again to make it more coocked, third time and again brought back medium rare, seriously they have a problem. I finally returned it, and they were good enough not to charge me. but what is the point getting there if im not gonna get my meals coocked right. In short, they have to really watch out not to drop in quality and service, or they will start losing customers fast. and seriously, solve the waiting time issue !! it is very very annoying !!"
Kristina B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,2,5.0,2/22/2010,"The Best Restaurant Ever.  The Menu is so nice and organized, must try the dessert, too! I just came back from there. we spent 80$ for two people (with 1 dessert), but it worth every penny. =)"
Caroline Y.,"Santa Clarita, CA",607,587,103,2.0,11/16/2006,"I was very unhappy with my last visit here. I went for my sister's birthday recently and got a big fat disappointment handed to me. Our server sucked. At first, he was on break so this other girl was covering for his tables, so she didn't care if she gave good service or not. Who cares right? She's not getting the tip. Then he came back acting like he's been our server the whole time. Oh, and everything took so damn long. I think we were in the restaurant for over 2 hours. Oh wait, we were. I paid $3 for parking on my way out, even with validation. Anyway, seated on a table too small for a party of 5, this is how the whole night went... No real server. No good service. No good food (the one in Beverly Hills is better). No refills. No birthday dessert. No, no, no. I will not go back. Me no likee... ***I gave this place an extra star because I'm nice and because our ""servers"" sang my sister Happy Birthday.*** They still suck!!"
Liza B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,79,,2.0,6/18/2007,"Is it lame to admit that I don't hate this place? Despite the 1+ hour wait to be seated, the fact that it's always too crowded and too loud, the fact that there's always a happy birthday song be sung off-key by the waiters, and the mediocre food, I still go back. Why? Five words: white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake.  Their salmon firecracker rolls ain't bad either. But I digress... This particular location sucks. I hate that hideous escalator that takes you to the top. So ugly! Addendum: I reluctantly went back here with my family and I ordered the lemon herb chicken which came with carrots, watercress, and mashed potatoes. It was okay but at $14.95 and the nearly 2 hours I had to wait to get a table, I really think it should have tasted a whole lot better. But, the pumpkin cheesecake was fantastic."
Kim G.,"Los Angeles, CA",230,90,10,4.0,3/8/2008,"Spiderwick chronicles is a great movie. Dinner after was FABULOUS! We had the fried macaroni balls for the appetizer and it was to DIE FOR! it wasn't too cheesy cuz they have this sauce to balance it out. its just. u have to try it. The jambalaya is way to overrated here. it doesnt even taste like jambalaya! its not even the same color as jambalaya! ew and dry shrimp: it was so dry it tasted like chicken.The pomegranite margarita was mm delicious.  David spade was also dining there as well as that mtv host guy with the hugee hat with the dredlocks? O and we saw that euro guy from ""a shot at love"" too. ahha but obviously, like any other cheesecake factories, it has a longgggggg wait..."
Crystal R.,"Los Angeles, CA",344,174,236,4.0,10/11/2010,"it was a bit of a wait, not surprised Saturday night 45 minute wait. We did wait a while for the food too, our waiter seemed a little overwhelmed but break substitute was more attentive then he was. My plate was DELICIOUS, I know i will have to come back for time and time again. At the end of the night we got a complimentary slice of cheesecake for our patience from the manager."
Virginia P.,"Rosemead, CA",44,107,2,4.0,11/1/2012,"Came here for a birthday dinner with some friends. Wait was about an hour and a half on a Saturday night. My friend called in earlier they said they do not take reservations and the wait shouldn't be too long around 7pm. Oh boy, were they wrong! Once we got there they said 45-60 minutes. An hour and a half later and a glare from the front because- I'll admit-  I was pretty persistent in knowing how much longer it would take to get seated because I saw people who got their pagers after me get seated first, my party finally got a table! A bit cranky from the wait and unorganized chaos from the front of the house, our waitress was extremely welcoming and sweet. She took our order right away and brought them out very quickly! I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken. It was delicious! I ordered it with Penne pasta but it actually tastes better with the pasta it originally comes with. It had a creamy cheese sauce with peas, bacon and chicken (with extra cost). One of my friends ordered the Louisiana Chicken and the sauce was flavorful and light with fried chicken on top. Another friend ordered the Everything Pizza which had a variety of toppings. It was a bit salty and sweet. Overall, the food, service, and ambiance was nice. Food is overpriced and what you are really paying for is the experience. Only complaint is to get the front of the house more organized and set up a better system for helping customers because standing in a crowded messy line was pure chaos."
Gene M.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,4,1,4.0,6/13/2013,"I almost gave this place a one star....but I held off writing a review until I could actually write a good review because I really wanted to give it a good rating.  My wife took me there for my birthday as a surprise and we had a party of 13 that checked in 2 hours early because they do not take reservations.  Long story short, after checking in at 4, party was supposed to be at 6, 8 pm came and we all left and took our party to another local restaurant where we were immediately seated.  Word got back to the manager through a friend and the manager sent my wife and I an invitation back to the Cheesecake factory for dinner on him.  This experience was wonderful!  We brought our kids, were immediately seated, had a complimentary meal, food was excellent, service was awesome, and it was great that the management made up for my surprise birthday which was not a surprise after waiting 4 hours a few months back.  I will return..."
