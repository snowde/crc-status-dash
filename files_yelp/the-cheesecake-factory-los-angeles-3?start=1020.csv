Tony Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,152,11,4.0,11/1/2007,"Yes, there's a long wait for dinner, but it's usually less than the estimated time when I go. Plus you could always wander over to the Apple store or Barnes & Noble while you wait. The last time I went, there was a really nice hostess. She had a really bright smile the whole time she was talking to us, and she even asked how our night was going on the way up the escalator. When we left, she said bye and thank you, still with her face lit up. The food is kind of hit or miss. It's either really good, or just eh. Their pot pie and omelet were weird. Nachos are okay. Their sweet tamale appetizer is DELICIOUS, probably one of my favorite things there. Salads are good, pastas are good, and of course their CHEESECAKE is heavenly. It's okay to come here just for that. The times I've been to this location, the service has been pretty good. Servers are usually really nice."
Linda K.,"Los Angeles, CA",449,106,4162,4.0,1/16/2008,"Here's another location that I love eating while I'm at the Grove.  Portion sizes are huge and not too pricey either.  Food selection is so much better than Grand Lux.  Try the steak thai salad.  All the cheesecakes are to die for.  I took off 1 star since they did bring my the wrong dish that I ordered and didn't realize it until I was 1/2 through.  They could have offered me something free or at least brought me the correct dish since it was their fault for not bringing me what I ordered.  Also, the 1 less star includes the wait time since we usually have to wait awhile and they don't take reservations either."
Julie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",616,428,42,4.0,9/12/2007,"What can one say about the Cheesecake Factory? It is, indeed, a factory, but not just of cheesecakes - of every other kind of food imaginable, in inexpensive, massive quantities, served in massively sized restaurants that always have a long wait. Surprisingly, given the fact that this place turns over god knows how many customers, their food is very good. I've never been dissatisfied with a meal here. Some of my faves: Avocado egg rolls (that I shared with Ewa M. last time, yum yum) Factory burger Grilled portabella sandwich Fettucini with chicken and sundried tomatoes Chocolate mousse cheesecake Peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake (hello? delicious anyone?)  But seriously, there isn't anything you wouldn't like. It might not be gourmet, but you will get FULL and you will have LEFTOVERS and you won't break the bank. Your pants, on the other hand, might be a little tight when you leave. Good for groups."
Amy J.,"San Mateo, CA",30,160,4,3.0,11/19/2007,"I'm sure there are better places to eat in Los Angeles.  But, this place worked while we wandered around The Grove.  Standard food, standard prices...except for my $4.50 lemonade. What a joke!"
Shelly S.,"Fullerton, CA",243,32,8,4.0,9/23/2012,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake in a long time...avocado eggrolls, thai lettuce wrap, mushroom burger,not to mention the bread they give you at the beginning, were all flavorful and yummy. Especially that cilantro something sauce that comes with the eggrolls and wrap, I love cilantro.  I usually don't post reviews for chains but I have to give a shoutout for the excellent customer service here.  It was really busy, got there around 4:30 pm with a party of 4 on a Saturday afternoon.  We were never neglected nor harassed,(they have a loot of employees here), food came out on time, and at the end when I asked for a togo box for buffalo wings, she asked me first if I wanted to take some ranch or bleu cheese home, then she brought not one, but TWO containers of ranch.  Almost every restaurant I've been to will not volunteer to give sauce togo, and even if they do, they never give enough.  Attention to little details like that, which make the overall experience so much better, but most people don't bother to go the extra mile, really impresses me.  Also, I am a huge sauce person so it personally made me happy, lol. I wish I knew the awesome waitress' name, but since I don't I will just say, thanks Cheesecake!"
San K.,"Westwood, CA",9,133,1,4.0,9/11/2012,"Had lunch here for my mom's birthday.We only waited for five minutes. I ordered her a caramel macchiato as her drink and she really liked it. I tried a few sips and it was better than Starbuck's. My mom had no idea what to order so I just asked her what kind of what she wanted and she asked for chicken. The lunch special offerings didn't seem great so I ordered her the bang bang chicken and shrimp. I liked how they set it, and my mom took over half of it home. I ordered the kobe burger, which was okay, but nothing special. The waiter brought ice cream for dessert with a candle in the middle. Kind of surprised that cheesecake wasn't on the house for birthday goes (BJ's does give free pizookies for birthdays, which is their specialty), but hey, if you're going there, you're probably going for cheesecake. My mom was too full so I didn't get a chance to order any cheesecake but definitely for next time!"
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,3.0,8/20/2007,"OK, I seriously need to stop eating at Cheesecake Fac.'s but I love them so... BUT, this time it wasn't my decision to come here (surprisingly enough).  I mean we were at the Farmer's Market, endless eating options, and yet there we were, perusing the million page menu, pretending as if we all didn't pretty much have it memorized! i found this particular location to be one of the nicer looking ones.  Two stories, roomy, but the service...was pretty crappy.  Still I give it 3 stars because the food never disappoints me.   However, next time I am at the FM, I will MAKE everyone eat somewhere ELSE!!"
Vincenzo P.,"Modesto, CA",0,19,75,5.0,12/5/2010,"After attending an event in Hollywood some friends and I went to dinner here and it was great. The service was impeccable and done with a smile. Not one person in our party had a complaint about the food and we all reveled in the delicious cheesecake desert. I love The Cheesecake Factory in general, but this location at ""The Grove"" went above and beyond with the excellent service provided. I will return and recommend."
Crystal L.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,37,2,1.0,12/26/2009,I have been a fan of cheesecake factory all my life...until now. This is the first time i ate at this location and it was christmas eve. i got the chicken piccata which tasted great at the time and as soon as i got home my stomach started to hurt really bad. my boyfriend was ok so i figured it had to be my chicken dish that did it. This case of food poisoning completely ruined my christmas this year.and kept me from seeing my family. At least when i called to tell them (so they didnt poison anyone else) they offered to refund my money. so i didnt have to pay them to make me sick. I havent eatten in 24 hours until just now...broth and noodles just like mama used to make.
Christina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,124,30,4.0,6/20/2010,"Picked up an order on Father's Day.  It was packed, but the order was done in 20 minutes.  The guy at the bakery counter was swamped, but still pleasant.  I haven't had a sit down in this CF, but the decor looked nice.  However, it was REALLY dark in the dining area...more like a nightclub or bar.  Consistent food quality is a plus.  My husband adores the avocado eggrolls and key lime pie.  I second the adoration."
Dorothy S.,"Westwood, CA",34,82,85,2.0,5/25/2008,"If you feel like waiting for 2 hours to be seated for a meal, go to the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove. Of all the times that I've been (which, sadly, has been quite a few), I've been against my will. There is always SOMEONE in the party who for SOME reason, wants to go to the Cheesecake factory when we are at the Grove. There's a perfectly fine Cheesecake factory which serves the SAME food in Brentwood (sooo much closer to where most of us live) but does anyone ever want to go to that one? No. And why not? Because they don't make you wait a lifetime just so you can get a seat.  I mean, the food is good and I LOVE their cheesecakes (mmmm...the white chocolate macadamia or whatever-the-ever-seven-words-in-the-name cheesecake.....) but is the food WORTH the wait? I mean, it's a CHAIN restaurant after all. Like I said, I can get it in Brentwood...YOU can probably get it somewhere else too. I like the Cheesecake factory...just not the one at the Grove! But I do give them this: the staff are always extremely nice and attentive. Despite the fact that 2930812321 people are all trying to get a seat and be served. Prices are reasonable and,like I said, food is good. But really, there are SO MANY OTHER food choices at the Grove. Live a little and go beyond the chain restaurant. You want your dessert? There are plenty of places with AMAZING stuff at the Farmer's market next door. Yes, when you're at the grove, eat at the Farmer's market...then drive to Brentwood if you really want that Cheesecake."
Jon E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,11/13/2012,"Food Poisoning Alert.  Please know, I have eaten at this location numerous times without incident.  However, this past Sunday my wife and I both got food poisoning after eating here.  Bed-ridden for two days, both of us missing work, I write this on the hopes a manager or staff member reads this and alerts employees to remember to WASH YOUR HANDS!"
Avital C.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,118,8,3.0,10/3/2011,"This location sucks because it's twice as loud.. The waiter couldn't even hear me & service was slow unlike other locations & I think the entrees aren't that special.. Especially the steaks , the rib eye tasted like county food lol thank g-d for the cocktails & appetizers.  Love ritz martini & spinach dip appetizer."
Catherine A.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,83,3,5.0,6/4/2009,"I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory and this is hands down the best one in LA. They make THE BEST DIRTY MARTINI in town. It's called the Well Mannered Dirty, with the perfect amount of olive juice(because it's corporate and pre measured-thus perfection everytime! I can't stand it when it's too dirty, or not dirty enough), Kettle one and blue cheese stuffed olives they stuff there. Ice cold, like a Scandinavian holiday in your mouth. I also love the miso salmon with that addictive glaze. The avocado egg rolls and spinach & cheese dip are simply divine when sitting at the bar, having a Stella Artois and watching a sporting event. Should I begin talking about salads? The luau, tostada and small endive are my favorite, refreshing on a Grove walking day. Their heavy stuff is good, all the pastas, etc.. however I always eat the lights and leave sublimely happy. The corporate atmosphere is nice actually, great lighting, easy listening music and immaculately clean.  Note: if you go here with a big party yes- you will wait- duh. This is a very popular restaurant! If you come here with time and a great attitude it will well be worth it. (I have a secret way to be seated and served quickly, one day I may share it) P.S. the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is dark, super rich and should be passionately and delicately devoured with a nice glass of red and with a debaucherous, over indulgent companion."
Ewa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",315,268,1511,4.0,9/12/2007,"Love Cheesecake Factory. Don't love the long ass line as the Grove to get in! Every time the same story: walking around with that stupid beeper or waiting aimlessly in front of the restaurant where tons of people are passing by and bump into you.  But fortunately the food make it all up! My absolute favorite are the appetizer avocado rolls!!! This stuff is so good that I might just stop here. But I won't. They have huge menu selection and their portions are huge as well! I recommend sharing some stuff and leaving space for dessert, cause who does not wanna try their famous cheesecakes? And remember: sharing is carrying:)  ps. if you don't wanna wait in line you can hang out in the bar area and if you lucky you can snap a table!"
Rina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1067,22,13,3.0,4/14/2010,"What i really liked about this place was the beautiful atmosphere- i went for a friend's birthday and i loved how attentive the servers were and how special they made my friend feel by singing her happy birthday and bringing out dessert! The place is really pretty, but on the dark side at night. It is also on the second floor, so it offers a pretty nice view of outside, and The Grove is a beautiful place, especially when all the Christmas lights are out (we went during the winter)! As for the food, nothing beats the amazing dessert and OMG the red velvet cheesecake was spectacular! For dinner i had Jamaican Jerked chicken, and it was okay, but i have definitely had better. The portions are HUGE though, so come hungry if you do come for dinner, but i say you're better off just having drinks and dessert here!"
Marie P.,"West Hollywood, CA",148,62,1,3.0,5/18/2010,"The only redeeming quality for this place is the menu.  The alcohol beverages seem to lack some alcohol and the food has gone down hill in the last few years.  The desserts is what's keeping this place open, I hope they improve on the rest of the menu."
Adam R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,56,,5.0,1/12/2010,"This review is for the desserts only! We havent had any entrees here. Came here for dessert after an incredible italian meal at Vivoli on sunset. We sat down at a bar top table and opened our menus straight to the dessert section. We were not disappointed!!! Basically they have a tonne of cheesecakes (duh) a few regular cakes, and some sundaes and milkshakes etc. We ate: - Oreo Cheesecake: Nice. Wasnt my favourite though. Im not the biggest fan of cheesecakes, and it tasted a little too cheesy for me. - Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake: The name was a sign!!! I have to say, and not being bias, this was my favorite out of the 3. Soooooo peanut buttery it was delicious!  - Factory Mud Pie: Which was a HUGE slice of the regular chocolate cake, with two scoops of ice cream and whipped cream on top. This dessert was the size of a mountain!!! This one dish could have satisfied all three of us just by itself. Will definitely be going back next weekend for dessert!!!"
Stephanie G.,"Northridge, CA",0,15,1,1.0,12/19/2012,"My stomache still hurts the morning after having dinner here last night. First off the wait time was supposed to be 30 mins, and turned into 1.5 hours. I was there with a group of friends, and we all drove here from various places like Long Beach and the San Fernando valley so leaving wasn't really an option. We stuck it out in hopes of having a great meal. It was far from that. Seating was poor, with a friend of our sitting in the aisle in a chair since the booth was too small for all of us and when we complained they said it would another 3O mins, so we dealt with it. My food was mediocre. I ordered the pasta brocolini, which was pasta with italian sausage, brocolli, asparagus and tomatoe. It was so greasy, the bottom of my plate was filled with grease from the sausage. The sausage was not even cut evenly it looked like something you would feed your dog. Big and small uneven chunks. I didn't complain because there were people at the table I had just met and I did not want to make a bitchy impression. Now, my stomache hurts mainly becuase of all the grease. If meat isn't prepared and cooked thoroughly my stomache tends to hurt, it's very sensitive. Please avoid this place, or go during non traffic hours such as lunch, maybe get a salad or cheesecake. The cheesecake was to die  for!"
Brian T.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,80,9,4.0,6/24/2010,Portions are always huge.  Happy Hour is awesome.  Love the Mac and cheese balls!  Avocado Egg Rolls & Mojitos are also amazing.
