Rosie S.,"Culver City, CA",35,50,,4.0,2/29/2008,"Cheesecake factory.I apologise.I apologise because I judged you on your name and your 'chain style' look and I was wrong! I am sorry!  I had to drag my bf kicking and screaming into this place as generally he does not 'do' chains or anything similar.. However, the guy leading us to our table was as friendly as..the wait staff were lovely, informative AND happy and the food was great! Yes, great I tell ya! Not the sort of place you would take someone for a special night out or a celebration (go to Spargo for that) but if you want large portions (we took our leftover's  home and had them for dinner again the next night),  and fresh, 'just like your mama used to make' food go here! Oh yes..I had the lemon chicken and the man had the shephard's pie, topped off with the Key Lime Cheesecake..all of it was delic! x"
Juleigh J.,"Dana Point, CA",43,210,1,4.0,11/22/2009,"We came in here for an appetizer before going to a taping of The Late Late Show last week. We sat at the bar and ordered off the small plates menu. I got the garlic balls, fontina cheese with a garlic breading and sauce and they were delicious. My friend got the stuffed mushrooms and they were very good too. We both got Fat Tire on tap and boy were they cold! It wasn't too crowded at the time of day we went. The food is consistently good and this location was no exception."
Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,564,13,4.0,4/14/2010,I have never had a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory...ever and I have been eating at various locations for 20 years.  I only wish they took reservations!
Brett E.,"Hesston, KS",17,8,6,4.0,8/23/2010,"Good food and a fun nighttime atmosphere! Service was excellent but wait to get in was long, at least 30 min."
Tristin M.,"Chicago, IL",279,458,151,4.0,8/15/2007,The Cheesecake Factory in general gets 3 stars and the Steak Diane gets 4 but the staff at this particular location is um... really good looking... ahem... Just so you know. Eat here for 5 stars of eye candy too.
Monica J.,"Canyon Country, CA",159,374,109,3.0,1/8/2010,I know everyone most likely has tried The Cheesecake Factory so not going to Yelp about the food... instead on Wednesday stopped here for dessert with my sisters and the 3 cheesecakes we tried were all AMAZING!!! Red Velvet Cheesecake ~ To die for especially for a Red Velvet fan like myself but loaded with calories :) Tiramisu Cheesecake ~ Very good indeed :) Wild Blueberry White Chocolate Cheesecake ~ Excellent and this flavor combinations is great :)
Angela J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,12,,5.0,5/2/2010,always great service. awesome food include: - avocado eggrolls - cobb salad (no bleu cheese - but your preference) - louisiana chicken bowtie pasta - raspberry chocolate cheesecake - strawberry cheesecake
Theodore P.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,19,,4.0,7/30/2012,"At first I was fairly sanguine about taking my mom here by default because I'm unimaginably impatient and she can't make up her lovely mind. Much love mommy dearest. This place was not the place to dine and pontificate on a lovely and piquant maternal examination of my childhood but we did have a roaring good time partly because the waiter remembered my name and everyone was so loud it felt like a speakeasy due to the velveteen darkness. I don't even remember what we ordered except the strawberry cheesecake I still don't have in my fridge (because someone disavowed my name and ate it. I will find and haunt you forever whoever you are) it was in the Grove and I suggest you go have drinks first because the wait time was so appallingly long we almost went to see a movie, get enzyme facials and horse betting before we were finally buzzed for our table up the stairway to dining semi-heaven. Bon a petite. I need to stop reviewing while drinking wine."
Bardia E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,49,,3.0,6/7/2012,"Not bad for a chain. The portions are so enormous that you can easily spilt one entree with a friend and be completely satisfied. Favorites: avocado eggrolls, sweet corn tamale cakes and firecracker salmon."
S C.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,31,3,4.0,9/16/2007,"HUGE Menu. Huge. Lot's of choices, lots of cheesecake. You never leave hungry. It's like going to grandmas house. Just about everything I have tried is good from burgers to salads to pasta to the Navajo. For the Grove - go there first, get your name in, then go shopping or walk around, the wait is insane - especially on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays."
Karen W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,30,,2.0,4/26/2012,"This gets a two star rating because the grilled cheese was amazing or this would be a one star rating. My son's order was simple--the factory burger on sourdough, plain, with cheese. So it comes out plain without cheese, he asks the waiter to put cheese on it, he does, and it's a slice of ice cold cheese. It also took so long that the meat got half cold and the sourdough roll, though flavorful, had more in common with a rock than it did actual bread. The waiter wasn't very good, but the staff who wasn't serving us--the girl who brought us our bill, the girl who sat us, and the man at the front desk--were all quite nice. This was the first time at the Cheesecake Factory and it will most likely be my last."
Lorenzo M.,"San Pedro, CA",17,9,1,4.0,3/11/2010,Great atmosphere...waiters are super nice and informative! Portions are big and never disappoint... and if you still have room for dessert...the cheesecakes are fantastic. I also love this location because it is located in the Grove/Farmers Market shopping center which is always a destination in itself.
Ray B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,18,,5.0,7/29/2012,I was surprised at how good the food is at the Cheesecake Factory. Lots of food and free bread for a very reasonable price. The Roasted Pear and Blue Cheese Flatbread is really an amazing flavor combination.
richard f.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,30,,5.0,5/30/2010,"Great food and very speedy service. The food selection is big and the appetizers are enjoyable. For some reason, I couldn't stop ordering the orange juice because it tasted really good. I highly recommend."
Heather B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/30/2014,my family and i visited this cheesecake factory for a birthday get together. we arrive there about 3:00 pm.  it was a party of 20.  we asked how long it would take to be seated and the host said if we wanted to be seated separately we would have to wait 1 and a half hour and if we wanted to be seated together it could be a 4 hour wait.  so we stated we wanted to be seated together and we would wait.  so we decided to go see a movie next door and the movie started at 4:00 pm.  my nephew went into cheesecake factory and explained to the host that our entire party was going to see a movie next door and he was assured our table would be ready once the movie was over. so maybe 15 mins into the movie we get a text saying our table was ready so again my nephew goes to the host and he said that it was fine that we would have our table once we returned.  when we returned we were told that our table had be given away to other patrons.  we were told we had to wait an additional hour and a half for our   once we were called to the second floor for seating we were lead to three different booths at 7:58 pm.  we inquired about putting the tables together toward an open area in the back of the room the manager said they couldn't hold tables to accommodate us.  so we ended up sitting in three booths.  the manager promised each booth two appetizers and two slices of cheese cake. the birthday patron was never offered the free ice cream the waiter never came to sing happy birthday.  the overall experience was horrible.  we couldnt get our parking tickets validated and end up paying 24 dollars a car for parking. never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tolky W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,,5.0,12/10/2007,"Ok, out of all the restaurants I have been in my life this this is in my top 5! I have been to their Denver and Los Angeles places and they never (whuao! for consistency) disappoint. Their fare and quality are excellent and bountiful. Anything you order will be good as when I go with my family we sample each other's great looking plates because they look irresistible. Expect a long wait. Since the dishes are very big we usually don't have tummy space for their cheesecakes. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT THEM! or God will punish you. Just take 3 or 4 portions from different cheesecakes for home. Your trite comment: ""Oh, that is a franchise. I'll never go there"". Your mistake."
MIKE B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",27,38,,5.0,11/8/2009,"Me and my family really love this chain.  It really does not get any better than this restaurant for quality and variety.  I usually tell diners to choose only from 2 or 3 items on the menu of most restaurants to avoid disappointment, but CCF is an exception to my rule. I have eaten countless dishes on their menu and been pleasantly surprised with the wonderful meals each time. However, I would be shortchanging new diners if I did not mention what I love most on their menu which includes: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta-unbelievable Crusted Chicken Romano-again YUM Cajun Chicken Littles-Best chicken fingers on the planet BBQ Ribs-OMG great! Renee's Special-Soup,Salad,Sandwich-have it on Saturday with the Chicken soup(Sat Only) and your soul will thank you. Pizza-great Steaks-surprisingly great! You can't go wrong with the great food, huge portions, and the beautiful space you are eating within. The service is usually really good too, however I have had a few bums as servers.  The good thing is the manager has comped us completely on those occasions. This place is a real winner, eat there as much as possible, we do!"
Ji O.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,22,21,1.0,10/24/2011,good food but the reservation lady in the front desk is so rude to people i think she is racist. she's the black lady with afro. she told me to wait 20 minutes to get the pager and i waited. so i asked her for the pager after 20 minutes and she said to wait in line again when she had given the pagers to other black ladies who werent waiting.. thats....weird RACIST!
John K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,,5.0,2/27/2011,"All the cheesecake factory I've been to had similar service and food.  But being in Grove, it's a nice place to go.  It's a fallback place to take a date or so.  Can't go wrong with atmosphere."
Nancy D.,"Manteca, CA",24,10,1,3.0,10/22/2011,"Cheesecake is a safe bet for any type of eater, that's why we took our group of 8 here.  We were sat fast 4:45 on a Friday, made it easy.  The table location was good, the waitress was not great.  She greeted us but didn't ask if we had been there before, didn't tell us the soups or the specials.  She took our drink orders and returned with them in a decent amount of time.  Our food orders went smoothly, but as soon as the last person ordered she just said ok, and kinda ran away.  When the food came it was great, everyone was pleased with their dishes; a burger, a plain grilled chicken breast, sliders, jambalaya, Ahi Tuna, Chicken Marsala, spegetti with mushrooms, chicken & garlic sauce, and a kids pizza.  Very diverse - all came out at the sane time and were great.  We got the one bite waitress check-back and then she disappeared.  We all had empty cups and were thirsty.  Now I think she was busy and her tables were all over the place, but just tell me you are busy and I'll be patient, set the expectation.  And please; apologize when you realize we all have empty cups.  The sad thing is she knew the gratuity was included on our check and she figured sub-par service was acceptable.  If I had not seen the tables on either side of us receive great service during the same time. I might not have been so critical, but the other servers at least mentioned the soups and specials and kept the young couple to my right full on soda.  This should have been an easy 4 1/2, boo to the waitress.  PS My husband was a server for years and we always tip 20-25% for great service.  She missed out."
