Calvin L.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,206,2,4.0,2/22/2009,"The Cheesecake Factory is almost never my first choice to eat--too long a wait and too popular, but I've usually always liked the food.  I don't think I've had anything I didn't like here, but I usually keep quiet when foodie friends blast this place.  But, I have to admit it--I like this place.  Anyways, the lil guy turned two and we were at the Grove entertaining some relatives staying over, so for convenience's sake, we took a number and sat down pretty quickly out on the terrace.  The overhead heater was a little too hot and the lil guy put a napkin on his head and pointed up at the ceiing, prompting our waitress to giggle, hand over mouth anime-like, and turn down the heater.   Service was good.  Dishes were cleared promptly, though the entrees took a little while after the appetizers.  Oat bran bread was delicious.  The crab cakes were meaty and the vietnamese spring rolls were better than I expected.  I had some good pork chops--something I rarely order.  Miso salmon was average, and the shrimp scampi was too buttery.  The fish and chips were very good--not too oily and good fresh white colored fish meat-- and the stuffed chicken tamale was yummy.  A nice couple next to us gave us certificates for two cheesecake slices, and our family just had a very nice time and a very pretty view of the Grove.  They sang Happy Birthday to the lil guy, and everything just made my stomach all warm and cuddlylike.  My wife couldn't believe we had just spent three hours there.  Prices are not cheap, but reasonable, the service friendly, and the atmosphere a little hectic, but nice!"
Sharon S.,"Torrance, CA",157,348,7,3.0,4/4/2011,"This place is like a fortress of great service and delicious (although overpriced food) that you have to do battle with to get in. Deal with the semi rude hostess who has no idea what's going on, wait forever for your buzzer to go off, go up the escalator, deal with the next rude host who prints out your table ticket, and then wait to be led to your table. Once you get there... Enjoy!!! I'd recommend sitting outside- you have fresh air with background noise of the Grove. Inside can be kinda ... cramped. As far as the food goes... Delicious! The stuffed mushrooms are packed with flavor, the French country ""appetizer"" salad is HUGE and filled with creamy herbed goat cheese and tender beets, and the raspberry martini was quite refreshing! But then again, if I'm paying $12 for a weak drink, it should be. Our waiter was charming and helpful, and we never felt rushed (or even worse, forgotten). If you have money to spend on tasty chain restaurant food and want to spend a leisurely (slightly inebriated) afternoon in the Grove, this is the place for you!"
Najmah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,16,,5.0,11/21/2009,"What can I say.... this is a regular spot for my family and I when we go to the Grove. Everyone in your party has options to choose from. Food isn't too expensive and you will be satisfied with just about anything that you order. This is like Mc Donalds for my family. lol  Of course, there is the wild variety of desert options."
Darcy B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,36,,4.0,4/29/2009,"Whenever I want good ole American variety cuisine without a particular craving, I know I will not be disappointed with the Cheesecake Factory. A notch above the Grande Luxes and Cheesecake Bistros (in my opinion), there's always some salad or pasta or burger that will make my tummy happy.  Careful not to walk too far if dining at the Grove location as the seat alert thingie they give you fails to work after a certain distance. Doesn't hurt that I saw Danny Gokey there recently!  BUT...what's with the freaking slippery marble-like floors?"
Tony G.,"Los Angeles, CA",257,104,27,4.0,2/21/2011,"If you've ever been to Cheesecake Factory, you know that this place has an amazing array of Cheesecakes to satisfy anyones picky palate. But not only do their Cheesecakes rock, but they got some pretty fantabulous food if I do say so myself.  Now i know all of you true foodies are thinking, Oh brother this place is the fastfood of fine dining, I've had better, It's not fine dining, so on and so forth. But in these economic times, not everyone can afford La Buca, or Comme Ca or Mozza or so on and so forth. Cheesecake factory allows people to come and enjoy great food with not so expensive prices in a very beautiful atmospher if I do say so myself (kudos to the people who do the store lay out work for CCF) If i may suggest, try the parmesean crusted chicken. It's perfectly seasoned, moist, and served with most excellent garlic mashed potatos that have just the right amount of garlic and a texture most other places would strive for. Service is quick and friendly, but if you're looking to come here on a holiday....MAKE RESERVATIONS!!!! lol. This particular one in the Grove in Los Angeles is perfect because you can dine and then walk around the shops to let your dinner settle. bon apetit"
Danielle V.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,50,13,3.0,3/25/2009,UPDATE: A manager called me 2 days later and told me that they make every attempt to investigate the source of  the bad food and offered to send a gift card to make up for my inconvenience - I took them up on their offer but will probably go to their Marina del Rey or  BH location instead and will definitely not order chicken picatta again.
louise b.,"Burbank, CA",0,8,,5.0,10/20/2009,"The food, service and ambiance was great.!!! A little pricey but probably worth it."
Sam Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",1193,964,194,1.0,11/18/2006,nice and fancy looking. im probably the first person to ever not like cheese cake but whats there to like? getting wanabe actors with plucked eye brows and the diva attitude (even though they are a boy) to serve me badly and get food that is best served at another restaurant? though in california I know TONS of ppl and even yelpers who love that sort of  thing and rave about it. sometimes i think california has no idea what good service and food is. but yelp can help.
Darlene J.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,167,64,4.0,12/9/2010,i love. avocado rolls and mojitos..yum! i just wish they took reservations
Stan H.,"San Francisco, CA",13,127,277,3.0,2/1/2009,"My trip to this location was the first time at the Grove, so I was excited. I've visited my relatives down in L.A. many times, but not here. Just another solid Cheesecake Factory with the same great food, decor and big portions. The same inconsistent service is available here, but I'm sure little things can be done to change that.  They seemed to have a problem seating my party of four, and it took some time because we didn't want to squeeze ourselves into a single bar table. But with some waiting and some ""negotiation"", we got our booth seat. We were only there for a pie break, so I can only judge the desserts. My fudge cake was da bomb! Same great desserts as usual.  A bonus is the covered balcony seats overseeing the plaza of the Grove! There are less seats at this location, but the view makes up for this deficiency."
Cutieshungryformore P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,5.0,6/11/2009,"My favorite restaurant hands down. Exceptional service, plus i love the free bread. I always get the  alfredo fettuccini without chicken and sun-dried tomatoes...it's so creamy. Freshly grated Parmesan cheese takes it to the next level. The four cheese pasta is also good but not what i expected. Just picture spaghetti with loads of cheese. Another delicious pasta dish is the spicy chicken chipotle pasta without the chicken of course. It has a tang to it, a crunch(tortilla strips) and a spicy edge. As for appetizers, fried macaroni and cheese, so   it off with a strawberry or raspberry lemonade!Can't believe i've been here dozens of times and never had cheesecake..ha ha."
Steph M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,44,3,2.0,1/18/2009,"If you want to wait 45 minutes for a chain restaurant, be my guest.  You'll need the over-sized portions once you're finally seated."
George M.,"Los Angeles, CA",417,655,242,2.0,9/12/2007,The wait is so long I have never been able to get a table. With so many other options at The Grove I just wonder why anyone bothers. The Farm is a much better option and you can see the fountain and watch the people go by on lazy weekends.
Eater K.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,137,19,4.0,11/6/2007,"I still enjoy it - despite the obvious.  In this case parking, long lines, and the refusal to take reservations.  In terms of food and service, it's been consistent and quality so I give it four stars for what it is.  I just won't be frequenting it unless there isn't much of a wait and I'm already at the Grove."
andrea r.,"CA, CA",37,119,8,1.0,11/2/2007,"wow.  i don't get it.  i just really totally don't get it.  Why oh why do people love to eat bad food?  this place is like a dystopian nightmare of what will happen to american restaurants in the future.  I hated it.. Not because the food was vile.  It wasn't.  But because it was so not special in every way.  Everything tasted vaguely fake and processed, but tasty for the first few bites.  But by the time I had eaten half of my chicken and biscuits, i wondered what the hell i was doing there.  It makes you feel like you are complicit in your own demise."
Gil K.,"Torrance, CA",37,439,26,3.0,5/12/2008,"Just decent. I like it because the outside seating is ontop of the main walk way, but I don't really enjoy the food. They give you a lot, but it's not the best quality. I definitely taste a lot of artificial ingredients and non-fresh elements, or just factory made food like their fried foods, not fresh tortilla.  I like the jambalaya, it's quite good. The Godiva sundae is good too. I had this at another location and everyone was staring because it's a very pretty presentation. The eggplant burger is a miss. Didn't like the texture of the eggplant, too mushy.  Their saving grace is their service. I have to admit, they have pretty good waiters. The wait sucks, but it's not like you can't do anything while waiting, there are plenty of stores around.  I say their cheesecakes are overrated and that you would be better of going to a specialty store for real cheesecake. I will probably get bashed for saying it, but I don't really dig their cheesecakes. Too sweet and way too much topping/cream. Just american style I suppose. Pros: location service Cons: food isn't the best"
Ryan Y.,"San Diego, CA",73,8,1,4.0,12/10/2008,Great ambiance here. Always huge portions and good service. Although I and both of my other friends had a difficult time choosing from the massive menu placed in front of you. Almost too many choices for food. I would definitely go back again.
Stacy K.,"Seattle, WA",0,23,,1.0,9/22/2012,"Terrible experience. I only went because my mom gave me a gift certificate as a gift. We were told the wait would be 45 minutes for the patio. Fine. Americana-lots of places to kill time. Went back after 45 and still no buzz. Asked us (politely) to wait longer. Got a drink at the bar. After 30 minutes, buzzer went off. They asked us to wait to the side of the host/ess counter. Waited another 20 minutes, while we watched several other 2-person parties get seated on the patio. Finally we decided to let them know they had forgotten about us. Waited another 10 minutes. They asked us to follow them to a table INSIDE! After all that waiting for a patio table. We told the person seating us about how they'd made us wait waaayy longer than originally estimated, then they forgot about us, and now they were seating us at ""first available"" after we waited for a patio table. Apologies blah blah. 10 more minutes, they were ready to take us to a table on the patio. We decided we didn't even want to eat there after this whole TWO HOURS OF WAITING ordeal. I will just have to call in take out for some slices of cheesecake because I certainly won't be going back for dinner."
Sheyda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,32,,4.0,3/24/2009,"sooo....i work at this cheesecake factory  thought that might get your attention. so why didnt i give my own restaurant 5 stars?? heres why: yes, we're a good restaurant. yes, our food is good. yes, we are very accommodating. yes, our menu is huge. yes, our desserts are awesome. BUT we are busy, you WILL wait if you come at dinner rush or a weekend. and food DOES take time to cook because everything is done fresh! if you get a well done burger, expect to wait 17-20 minutes. we do run out of ""chocolate bread"" which, btw, is just whole wheat loaves fresh from the oven. overall our location is super busy, but the staff is really great i'd say 95% of our staff loves their jobs and really care about our guests (i'll never say 100% there's always a few people with bad attitudes!) and i'm one of them. i promise you that if you come to the CCF and arent having a good time, but let your server or the manager know whats wrong, we WILL fix it! which is why we do deserve four stars...but not 5!"
Julie S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",15,112,,3.0,12/28/2006,"I've eaten lunch here several times.  If you don't get there early for lunch you will have a long wait.  I've eaten solo at the bar area a couple of times which ended up being alright (I watched tv while I ate).  But be advised that nothing moves quick at this place.  Even if you call ahead for carry out, add at least 10 minutes on to what they tell you.  The food is good and portions are large.  They do have outdoor patio seating which appears to be nice but I've never eaten out there."
