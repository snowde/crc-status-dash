Lina O.,"Orange County, CA",404,485,1970,5.0,1/4/2009,"cheesecake factory is always a good pick. this was the first time ive been to the one at the grove though. its actually bigger than i thought it was. we put in our names and then when we got called, had to go up the escalators and then actually have to wait a bit longer to get seated, which i thought was a little weird. oh well though. i was in the mood for some angel hair pasta so i got the shrimp with angel hair. (Large Shrimp Sauteed with Herbs, Lemon and Garlic. Combined with Angel Hair Pasta, Fresh Tomato and Fresh Basil) it was actually really good. very light and with good flavor. the shrimp was a bit chewy though. my friend got the pasta carbonara i think. which was pretty tasty. (Spaghettini Tossed with Smoked Bacon, Sweet Green Peas and a Light Garlic-Parmesan Cream Sauce, with Chicken) it was a little on the heavy side but the taste was good."
Lissette G.,"Burbank, CA",0,18,,2.0,1/24/2012,the food here was great with big portions like always but i only gave it 2 stars because the service was horrible! the food came out late and the server was never around and when he was he never said much. he took our order and left. kept trying to get his attention. -__-
Arn R.,"Granada Hills, CA",176,111,,5.0,6/19/2011,"one of our favorite places to go to. lots of variety, good food. can't go wrong with cheesecake factory. love their pastas, perticularly the pasta davinci and the chicken marsala. yumm"
Rick L.,"Menlo Park, CA",38,228,,3.0,1/18/2009,"im being generous here. i honestly dont know what people love so much about cheesecake factory. sure their portions are big but the food itself is merely ok. i ordered the blackened chicken sandwich. and whereas it was pretty good, it wasn't anything super special or extraordinary that i could not make myself.  even my friend's entrees..i think my friend got the carbonara... it was just way too saucy and heavy. it should have been lighter. angel hair shrimp scampy was pretty nice, but again, something u could probably make at home for less than 5 bucks. the free bread is good though, thank goodness its free! and the wait. oh man this place said if we wanted to sit 10 together we had to wait FOUR hours. gimme a break four hours? gimme outback another day man. 3 stars, for decent tasting food and big portions. no wonder americans are friggen lardbutts, they finish those huge portions."
Michael A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,23,1,3.0,7/1/2008,"okay. so - TCF at the grove is great for brunch. you get to sit on the terrace and soak up the sun with a tasty mimosa or blueberry vodka soda in hand.....wait. that's right - they don't serve alky-hol until 11am. WTF is that about?! have you EVER heard of brunch withOUT drinks?? is that just the most insane thing ever?? i was shocked and appalled. but the food was tasty, gotta give it that."
michelle o.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/26/2009,"I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! and everything on their menu! my fave (just had it on my bday last night!) the BISTRO SHRIMP PASTA!!!! YUMMMM!!!!! and the calamari for appetizer!  delicious! it's can hold a large amount of people and great for dinner parties except yes, it does get loud!... I always enjoy it here but at one occasion, our waitress wasn't satisfied with her tip and came after us...hmmm...just like that waitress from sushimac lol... i didnt even realize it till my friend mentioned it to me! she went up to my friend and was like ""was there something wrong with my service?! i dont understand this!? I'm not a cheap person, I just believe that you get what you deserve; I will tip you if i find your service good. if not, oh well!  yuck! people like shouldnt even be working in restaurants with that kind of attitude begging for money like that!"
x h.,"CA, CA",0,90,,1.0,2/23/2007,"i was forced to eat lunch here today because of work.  i knew going in that the food would be disasterous. let's call it a hunch.  from looking at peoples dishes as we were being escourted to our table (party of 14), the portions were huge and well, not very pretty.  after scouring the menu and seeing that vegetarian options were not plentiful, i decided to get the cheese pizza.  i knew it would be awful so i figured i would at least get what i expected. and i did. i've had better frozen pizza that cost 99 cents than this piece of shit they are passing off as pizza. hello, ever heard of something called flavor? how about some oregeno? anything!!  the best part was watching my co-workers eat their dissapointng lunches. brandon, scott, and hector got the cajun chicken littles. hector assured them it was tasty.  hector will never live this down, apparantly.  both scott and brandon hated their lunch. in fact, it was brandon who asked if there was a food blog out there just to give this dish a bad review.  justin got the hungarian goulash. besides making a mess all over himself, he assured us it wasn't hungarian enough. poor justin even used his napkin as a bib.  jamie ordered an omlet with mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and cheese... well her omlet came with only mushroom and spinach.  she had to send it back claiming grossness.  oh, yeah. no way those were real eggs... egg beaters for sure.  the highlight of lunch was markus, who ordered the hamburger fun dish or whatever it was called.  something twice the size of a big mac.  he gulfed it down in less than 5 minutes. he's my new hero.  all in all, i'd recommend NEVER coming to this place. even when forced."
