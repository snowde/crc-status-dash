arnold a.,"Sepulveda, CA",47,18,6,5.0,9/1/2017,Great service from Anthony at the dessert bar today. He was very attentive to my needs. An asset to your organization.
Tim L.,"Los Angeles, CA",321,161,237,3.0,9/29/2016,Simple and Sweet Cheesecake factory is definitely a great place to go celebrate in big parties or when you have a lot of friends with different needs. Cheesecake factory can deliver as they have a massive menu that WILL cater to everyone. The food is alright but its the portions and the free bread that makes up for everything. You will definitely end up with leftovers because of how giant each dish is. I always get the Jambalaya pasta because that's my go to item. Of course they are known for their cheesecakes and their cheesecakes are super decadent but oh so delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them as all the ones i've tried are really good.  I think for this location service can be average as other yelpers have mentioned but its not bad. The decor is solid at every location and this one is no exception. Heck this one is 2 stories and you take a escalator up to the dining room! How awesome is that?!  Definitely a great place to celebrate in big parties and get together. Prices are also extremely fair so thumbs up!
Dawla A.,"Pasadena, CA",15,120,7,4.0,3/9/2017,"I've had the fish tacos, honey truffle fried chicken, dynamite shrimp and tuna tartar. Service was good. The only negative was there was very little tuna in the tartar."
Ron E.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,65,286,5.0,10/23/2016,"(My son's review) A foodie's must. From oreo cookie shakes to chicken alfredo, this place is great. The staff is friendly, too. For example, they give you a free birthday goodie (i.e. a cheesecake!)"
Gotty A.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,9,,1.0,8/5/2017,I'm disappointed to find out they sale fake glued steak because most of their food is good but I can't respect a well known restaurant to dip that low when they are tricking customers to pay for premium prices for scraps of meat. If you are not aware of this then I would do some research on it. This is bs The Cheesecake Faketory.
Andrea C.,"Irvine, CA",154,147,47,1.0,1/23/2017,"I usually love cheescake factory and I have been ordering the same thing for a while now. I wanted to order the lemon herb chicken on Saturday when I came in. i usually substitute the mashed potatoes for marinera pasta without a problem. I've done it at all cheescake factories including this one. The waiter we got was rude about it and said he could only ass regular plain pasta and would charge me 3.99$ for the sauce which would come separately..? 3.99$ for sauce? I told the waiter that i've been getting it that way for the longest time and he said that only ""lenient"" servers do that without a charge.. So are you not lenient?? Really bad customer service from him and I did not like the way he talked to us. I was disappointed.  Besides that Cheescake factory is a good place for the many options they give you. Try the chocolate moose cheescake it's to die for!"
Bruce M.,"Palmdale, CA",367,42,58,4.0,5/28/2017,"I'm personally not into chain restaurants but my fiancée convinced me to give this Chessecake Factory at The Grove. I honesty enjoyed the Chicken Madeira and my fiancé always raves about the chicken Piccata. The food, service, and location were above average. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day out. The only negative was ""Pleasure P(formerly of Pretty Ricky fame)"" was attempting to hide as if he weren't a C list celebrity."
Alyssa H.,"Wildomar, CA",66,19,12,4.0,9/13/2017,"My very first experience here started off rough with the hour long wait, but once we sat down it was wonderful. The service was amazing and had a couple people serving us. The food was absolutely amazing and big portions."
Courtnee A.,"Henderson, NV",5,11,2,2.0,7/26/2017,Probably the worst service I've ever received at a cheesecake factory. Also there are only two working bathroom stalls here. Two sets of people on either side of us ordered after I did and received their food and checks before  I got my food. Super slow service.
Kayla B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,,2.0,6/1/2017,"If you're expecting excellent service and good food in the restaurant, you will get it!  If you're expecting that same level of customer service when placing an order to go, you will NOT get it. I was placed on hold for over 5 minutes; I hung up and attempted to call FOUR more times- no answer. I understand inside restaurant traffic can build up- but having a to-go customer on hold for that long, and then not having anyone answer the phone FOUR times is just inexcusable. You will lose business that way."
Maurice T.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,193,260,3.0,12/31/2016,"Ok so I am a huge Cheesecake Factory fan, and have been to multiple across the country probably over a hundred times. So I am not slamming them as I am a realist. But this visit was the most subpar ever for their standards. If you read my reviews I like them and review them as such.  On 12/30/16 I went and there was a 15 minute wait but the ladies at the front desk were very nice and accurate about wait time. Once our buzzer went off we went upstairs and we're seated. Now here is where the fun began. We entered CKF at 12:57p, were seated at 1:12pm, but was not asked about drinks or anything until 1:35p. They were busy, and our waitress had multiple tables and I could tell she was doing her best, but we did not leave until 3:04p because everything took forever.  We just wanted to pay because our Gumbo was just plain nasty (this time, normally it is to die for), but that still took 30 minutes. The people serving us tried their best but they were clearly short staffed, and we always thank the great state of California for giving 18-22 year old millennials the option to go to work or simply call in and be paid (pretty sure if they had it when I was growing up I would us every hour I had lol). I will be back but the visit today was well below my standard for such a established restaurant that normally wows me with everything."
Mister S.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,122,13,5.0,1/17/2017,I have to say I have eaten here about a Dozen Times in the past few years and only once was I dissatisfied with the meal.  I feel that the serving staff here is top notch and in there game. My last visit I had this great girl that had personality and a continuos smile that made it that much better. Thanks.
Russell N.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",34,53,24,5.0,3/11/2017,"Treat yourself to good food and drink there. Drinks here are readily available, so you can enjoy a glass of wine or try something new. This restaurant is kid-friendly, so little ones are welcome to tag along. Be sure to check out outdoor seating when the climate is right.  Here  is a great location to host a group dinner or lunch. Very polite waiters, fantastic costumer services, awesome environment!  Totally, I really recommend this place to everyone!"
Sunny Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,28,43,3.0,8/9/2016,"Cheesecake Factory..at the Grove.. I don't have many positive feedback about this place.. [SERVICE]  The service was terrible..the people who came after my family and I got their food first, then we got our food, which I thought was weird.. And it took awhile to get our food and the check.. [FOOD]  * Chicken Piccata: It was really dry, and there was barely any sauce on the penne pasta, but the chicken was good.  * Louisiana Chicken Pasta: Delicious. Recommend  [TIP]  In my opinion, the seating inside is much better than the seating outside.  * Also I've heard the desserts and cheesecakes are good, but I've never tried it. [THOUGHTS]  I was pretty disappointed in this Cheesecake Factory..like really disappointed"
Taneesha A.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,33,145,2.0,7/31/2017,Food is okay depending on what you order. Food would be better if they would include all ingredients listed from the menu. However  Great happy hour!!!
Helen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,29,29,3.0,7/31/2017,Food is great except the wait time. It is rediculouse to wait 1 to 2 hours! And when you finally walk in you see some empty tables!!! And eating inside is horrible because it's too loud. Other than that I like this restaurant.
Edwin R.,"San Mateo, CA",140,972,8244,4.0,11/8/2015,"One good thing for sure you can always guarantee dining at The Cheesecake Factory for the most part, you will always get good service and a good meal.  Everyone of course raves about their breads, and so we ordered more and more of it.  Why not, it was complimentary.  LOL :p   While I'd tell you what to order here, but I'm sure at one point in your life or another, you've been to The Cheesecake Factory, but I believe most of everything on their menu are good. I prefer their seafood when I'm here.  If you do decide to order desserts, may I suggest ordering their Cheesecake Banana?  It is really darn good!!  And after your meal, don't forget to walk it off around The Grove, burn a few calories after dinner, or maybe even stop by for a nice outdoor cafe at the EBar-Nordstrom. Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"
Adel N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",118,54,40,4.0,3/10/2017,"One of the coolest restaurants in La that you miss the taste of their food once every few months, you can enjoy a great dinner after hanging out and shopping at the Grove"
Martina W.,"Los Angeles, CA",192,54,7,1.0,7/27/2017,"Regret getting the jambalaya - all because I was too lazy lol. Chain restaurant, what did I expect? ‍"
April D.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,89,68,2.0,12/8/2016,"Biiigggggg let down!  I normally love the factory but this time they dropped the ball!  I got the steak Diane and chicken madiera!  Cold as ice! Not sure how it was cold but me and my friends food was cold!  The waiter offered to ""re-toss"" the food on the stove and offered free cheesecakes but we don't eat cheesecake so we expected something off the check instead!  She brought the food back out and it looked nothing like it did before, no sauce and poor presentation!  It was warmer this time around  Check came, no comp!"
