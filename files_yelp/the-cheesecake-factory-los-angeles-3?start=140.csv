Jin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,6,,5.0,9/2/2017,I been here a lot of times and I got to say today's food was very delicious. Either the quality was upgraded or they hired a new more experienced chef. Regardless of the reason. I am very pleased with today's entree.
Aryo S.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",418,231,776,4.0,11/29/2016,"---Atmosphere, Service, Parking---- Located at The Grove you can expect this to be a busy place. With the same look and feel of other locations elsewhere, it's a great setting with a couple differences. They do have a patio with what I suspect to be a nice view. When you enter there's a host stand with several hosts, and they'll take your name down and present you with a pager (if you have to wait). The cool thing is that the pager allows you to walk to a certain distance, so ask about how far it reaches the surrounding area. Once entering you'll head up a set of stairs or escalators and then you need to talk to another set of hosts who then ultimately seat you. Nearby is a display with desserts and dressings for sale.  Service was pretty great by newcomer(at the time) Asia when I visited last and besides one bump in the road with hosts prior to sitting down, everything else went well.  The Grove has parking and it's in a large parking structure. Make to sure to ask about validation as they validate an hour here (first at The Grove is free).  --Food, Drinks & Prices--- I'm sure you know what they provide here and at the many other locations; the menu is vast with all sorts of things. Many appetizers, small plates, pasta dishes, pizzas, burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads, tacos, chicken and steak dishes, seafood, and all other sorts of entrees, ranging and hitting many flavors of different cuisines. Portions are large and same with the calories in everything (don't look!). Love the fresh bread and butter they serve first. I've pretty much loved everything I've had at the Factory over the years, can't go wrong with anything really. Here's a few things I've tried: -Avocado Eggrolls - Avocado lovers unite! Tons of it obviously with a couple other ingredients mixed in served with a tamarind dipping sauce. -Tex-Mex Eggrolls - Crispy rolls filled w/spicy chicken, corn, black beans, peppers, onions and melted cheese. Served with avocado cream and a pica de gallo. -Buffalo Bites - Lots of breading on this thing but for those who love buffalo sauce these are filled with chicken, cheese and wing sauce. -Crab Cakes - Three of them I believe and pretty tasty. -Meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread - Great meatballs and sauce, served with great bread for dipping -Chicken Scampi Pasta - All the great flavors of a scampi, delicious. -Steak Diane - Medallions of certified angus beef steak covered with black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled onions. Great! -Pumpkin Cheesecake - If you like pumpkin pie you'll adore this just the same. All sorts of drinks and a full bar is available. Something to note is that The Factory has it's own line of wine, I believe beer as well (I may be wrong on that). Prices are in the $5-20ish range."
Gina M.,"Monterey Park, CA",4,63,117,3.0,3/29/2017,Went here for dinner.  Ashley W our waitress was fantastic best service I have had in a long time.  Thank you Ashley!
Ivan G.,"Huntington Park, CA",286,1,,1.0,10/20/2017,This is the worst place to bring your family not because the food but the waiting time is ridiculous waiting one hours to be sat.  On top of the the customer service is not what I was expecting no one check on us during my visit. If any one is planning to come to this location be aware to spent more than an hour with your family just to get a table.
Breeonn J.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,20,52,5.0,3/26/2017,The server Demitri was amazing! He was so friendly and on point with the service! I've been coming to the Cheesecake Factory since I was a little girl but he made me write my first review! Promote him to something higher than a server! He deserves it!
Patrice D.,"Isla Vista, CA",247,3,,1.0,7/21/2017,"Not outstanding. The bread was too hard. The place was too noisy. Pasta had a rubbery mouth feel. ""Louisiana"" Chicken Pasta tasted ordinary. The Oreo ""cheesecake"" was too sweet and did not taste like a cheesecake. Waiters weren't very attentive. I will not be coming back and will not be recommending this place."
Coreen C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/1/2017,"My friend took me to Lunch yesterday at the Grove location...Our Mistake ...on a Saturday.  I had Never been to Any Cheesecake Factory....and I'm not sure I will again. Given that it was a Saturday...we had to wait to be paged...but to have to Wait an additional 24 minutes ...for a Turkey sandwich....WTH ? The sourdough bread ( type of roll) was a ROCK..I had to ""eat the Turkey OUT of the bread""...Server said she Could Exchange the bread....but after waiting 24 minutes for my Lunch....NOT"
Baris T.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,39,22,4.0,9/4/2016,Starting with Honey Wheat Brown Bread and Cucember lemonade. You prepared yourself with them before Bang Bang Chicken and shrimp;) also my favorites are famous meatloaf and cajun chicken. The only negative thing is waiting before get in;( Thanks
Ferriere T.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",21,9,7,1.0,7/14/2017,They are not very welcoming. The worst is that everything you touch is greasy ! The menu and the silverware were greasy and I brought my kids to wash their hands immediately. I'll never go back.
Mellinda H.,"Los Angeles, CA",173,1,,1.0,12/19/2016,"I had previously ordered from here for my exec staff at my company and written a review of two/three stars because they had forgotten to put the meat on two of my salads. As a person who's worked in the food industry for a few years, I get that things happen - this could've been a simple mistake, so though I wasn't happy about having to go back and get the order fixed (after tipping as well) I was okay with letting it slide. That being said, I decided to order from them again today, though I was uncertain about it.  Two more salads came out without meat on them, and because the person who filled my bags assured me they were made correctly, I didn't notice until I had walked back over with our food.  I could understand checking food to make sure it has no cheese on it, etc. as part of a specification, and I'm also not the type to leave bad reviews, but this is really unacceptable and reflects badly on me as an employee when my execs notice something's wrong. We usually order from CF pretty frequently, but I honestly think that's going to stop now. I've been to CF as a dine-in and had a good experience, but there's just some major miscommunication between the kitchen staff and the order team."
Judy a.,"Ontario, CA",26,256,185,5.0,8/2/2017,First time at this location . I went on half of cheesecake day which was crazy to say the least.  There was a line to get in before it even opened but I was at the Grove so I said I'm going to eat here anyways. Once the doors open it was a pleasant surprise. Service was good the cheesecake was good everything was perfect will definitely be back when I go to American girl.
Wendy E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/28/2017,"This is my first experience here. Now to start we waited twenty mins while looking around other stores, no big problem. We were seated by a host who had two sky buns and didn't even say a word, no hi or anything, then a women served us water, we assumed she was our waiter, 35 mins passed and we had not even ordered our food, while other people where getting their orders, or water we were being ignored, my friends asked the waiter that served us water who told the manager, and the manager came to take out order now to make things worse another man came mad becuase he probably got in trouble idk, but I would not recommend this restaurant, as a business major customer satisfaction should be priority, and the Manager taking more order, doesn't not make things better, anyways I am still waiting for my order lol might just leave because my movie is about to start!!SKIPPP"
Rachael B.,"West Hollywood, CA",48,271,388,3.0,2/15/2017,"If this review was based on service I would be giving negative stars. I have no clue where they find these waiters but it's a joke! The waiter had no clue about the drinks or beer when asked said ""no idea"". Pretty sure you need to be knowledgeable and trained in your job to best help your customers. Also, when I asked for extra sauce the waiter pointed in my food saying ""which sauce?"" Basically touching my food and in my personal space. Bit awkward, but that aside I wasn't too disappointed. The food was actually tolerable for a chain. I expected bland and low quality but I was impressed with my meal and my friends. Had miso glazed salmon with brown rice and veggies. Felt it was a good option and the flavor of the miso was lovely. I ate every bite! Would come back but hope I get a better waiter!"
Jackie Y.,"Valencia, CA",3,41,4,4.0,12/2/2016,"I really like Cheesecake Factory...food is great...service is usually pretty good...desserts are wonderful...but...my dissatisfaction is that they have a 'suggested' gratuity at the bottom of their check that has our local 9% sales tax added into the sub total! Why?? They are being dishonest in that the gratuity should be based on the sub total amount of the food/drinks, NOT the total amount of the bill, with the tax included.  So...if you choose to tip 20%, using the figures on their check, you are essentially giving a 22% tip. I totally support the servers, but Cheesecake Factory Corporate needs to be honest with their patrons and change their policy regarding their deceptive checks."
Sepi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",233,134,16,2.0,6/8/2017,"I have been to this Cheesecake Factory around 4 times and out of those times, I have received terrible customer service on 3 occasions. Twice I spoke to a Manager about it but this last time, I decided that I was done. I have worked at Cheesecake Factory when I was in graduate school and know for a fact the training they used to give their employees. Not sure if they do or if this location just had really bad management. I expected that their service would improve after the first two times, but alas, they are still lacking big time. I have experienced everything from servers having attitude, to not bringing out the appetizers and mains separately, to bringing out the wrong orders and I am done. The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the chefs actually do a good job with the food itself."
Grace H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,36,21,1.0,6/7/2017,"So disappointed. Cheesecake Factory is not the same as before. I used to love Cheesecake Factory but now I don't. I went to cheesecake with my bf and his mom. All three of us got pasta. My bf and I ordered the jambalaya and for one of them we asked for EXTRA sauce on the side. I repeated this to our server and he even confirmed it. HOWEVER, when it came out they did not put any sauce on it!!! AND no sauce on the side either...ummm...so you expect me to eat a tasteless jambalaya? I would understand if they at least gave me sauce on the side so I know where the miscommunication was but they put no sauce on the jambalaya AND no sauce on the side, just plain noodles. The jambalaya sauce took a very long time to come out, maybe around 20 minutes. By the time the sauce came out my bf and his mom were done eating. To top that off, my noodles had become cold! Ohmygosh...I'm a pretty understanding and patient person but this is unacceptable! As I was eating my cold jambalaya, my bf and his mom were watching me eating because they were already done...awkward. Even after this HUGE mistake, they did not offer any discounts. I'm not one to ask for discounts but the gesture tells you that they really are apologetic. All we got is a 'sorry' and nothing else. I used to work at a restaurant too and if something like this happened, I would go to the manager and explain what happened and see if I can do anything to make it up. Super disappointed! Especially since Cheesecake Factory is a huge chain restaurant.  I have more bad experiences at cheesecake but this review is already super long. The only reason I kept giving Cheesecake Factory another chance is because I used to like Cheesecake Factory, but not anymore. Just take my word for it. You're better off going to another restaurant."
Lady L.,"Gardena, CA",0,31,1,3.0,9/24/2017,Our server was ok. The wait was long. He set down all the tickets and didn't hand them to any of us.
Wes R.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,17,,1.0,12/6/2016,"Do not...I REPEAT....DO NOT order alcohol drinks here. We took a work associate to lunch for his birthday and had drinks with our lunch order. We all know drinks are expensive these days. That's cool.....as long as the bartender pours alcohol in them. They don't. I had TWO Mai Tais and a Long Island Ice Tea in an hour and walked away with ZERO buzz. We pissed away over $200 bucks on what amounted to several cups of water with a little juice in them disguised as drinks. But, kudos to the bartender. He/she saved the company fifteen bucks by being extremely light-handed in the pour. Maybe the bartender's in line for that beginning of the year 50 cent/hr. raise by showing management that they're saving them money on booze. I sure hope it was worth losing several customers over."
Sierra B.,"Santa Monica, CA",475,2,,1.0,7/11/2017,"Honestly im not one to write reviews , and I'm generally really chill about my service , but this was definitely not a good experience. It made me never want to come back to this location.   First the waiting was kinda long but I didn't mind the lady at the front desk was kinda rude when I had asked where the Nike store was. She had a little bit of an attitude as if I knew where it was  They sat us next to where the they enter everybody's orders and they all talk to each other we heard about the drama and there personal life's (problems)   . It took them about 20 minutes to get our drinks ,  and they didn't bring all our drinks at once , it took an additional 5 minutes for my lemonade to come out , then they placed our order, by that time we have watched a few people come in and out by the time we even got our food .. We both ordered a pasta dishes with no special request or anything like that .. we waited an additional 30-45 minutes just for our food. The food seemed like it was rushed and there was really no flavor .. so finally we asked for the bill which took about 15 minutes to get. We know it wasn't all the waiters fault because we watched some other waiters keep giving him request to help them out so we tried be as chill as possible and understanding . But it just wasn't the best experience and definitely made me not wanna come back."
Erika L.,"Los Angeles, CA",938,63,26,3.0,5/2/2016,"Once, we told the waiter it was our friend's birthday hoping they would give us some free cheesecake. Instead of giving us free cheesecake, he simply said ""oh, happy birthday"" and walked away. Used to be a place where my friends and I celebrate our birthdays in middle school and have our parents drop us off before taking group pictures outside. Now, this a place for families that drive Camry's and go to Disney. They don't need to know all of our business. The huge menu gives you world of flavors.  Drake loves coming here, we fought here once."
