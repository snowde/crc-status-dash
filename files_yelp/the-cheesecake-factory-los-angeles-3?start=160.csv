Maty A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,5.0,11/5/2017,"Great service good food always fresh, not first time the appetizers are delicious some time have to wait as up to an hour..."
Joy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,72,111,4.0,6/20/2017,"Best part of a corporate business is the consistency of quality of food, environment and service. We can always count on a nice time when we go to a CF! My one and  only complaint is the volume of the music that is always blasting that makes it hard to have any conversation iver dinner."
Elizabeth L.,"Fullerton, CA",19,133,69,3.0,7/20/2016,"The food is not terrible but it's not great. It is not worth the amount that is listed on their regular menu.  For this reason, if you want a quick decent snack and tasty drinks, I would suggest going for their happy hour (4pm-6pm). If you do not want to snack, just go for their cocktails! If you are on a diet, you can also get any of the cocktails in a skinny (less calories); just let the server know ."
Sonya C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",13,6,3,1.0,5/26/2017,"My husband and i requested a table for 10 got a wait time of 3-4 hrs.....sister and her husband request a table for 10 not even 10 minutes after us since our family was meeting there....they gave her a wait time of 40 minutes....my conclusion is they didnt want to seat an overweight couple over a ""normal size"" couple...will not be going back here"
Yvette G.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,14,7,1.0,4/24/2017,"Completely unhappy from beginning to end! I've been to so many Cheesecake Factory restaurants.. Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks, Beverly Hills, Glendale .. etc. And honestly I've never had bad service like this one.  First when we entered we were not greeted nicely, the 2 people up front were not friendly at all and not presentable either. We were ""greeted"" by a girl named Michelle, tattoos all over her, I mean nothing against that if you have a nice friendly attitude to balance it out but when you're mean looking and you're actually mean .. that art work does not help you at all. She asked how many people, i immediately felt a little rushed and just intimidated by her tone so I quickly responded with 2 she answered back with ""its going to be 15 min"" .. then I quickly said I'm sorry I meant to say 2 adults and a baby, she rolled her eyes and said ""THATS 3 people it's going to be 20 minutes"" I said ok that's fine, is it faster if we seat out door, she responds with ""thats an additional 15"" all with an attitude and a rude tone. Whatever .. we decided to stay and wait Bc it wasn't busy and wait wasn't long, any other day I would've probably not tolerated that kind of attitude specially as a good customer who goes to cheesecake on a weekly basis literally. So we get called to get seated, we get an outside table????? But did she not say it was going to be an additional 15? Okay well, we get seated around 5pm, ordered our drinks and food, didn't get our appetizer til almost 45 min later, our main entree we did not get until an hour later ??? Looking around and ppl who were seated after us received their food before us ? To top it off My food wasn't great at all, I get the same thing every time, the chicken pieces were super small, the sauce was watery with no flavor and my food was warm almost cold. Then right after the waitress serves our food, not even taking the first bite, she brings out the check???? Really guys? Idk but I'm so disappointed. Not happy. Not satisfied. And it's too bad Bc i was starving, hadn't had lunch and I was really looking forward to a great meal at my fav place. Don't think I'll be coming back to this location anytime soon."
Shamia B.,"Inglewood, CA",0,11,7,1.0,5/20/2017,"I absolutely love the Cheesecake Factory and I always get the Louisiana pasta with broccoli instead of chicken. This was my first time in years visiting this location and when I ordered they brought out the food with both broccoli and chicken, and I told them I would like it remade after they stated it was and easy fix, as in simply removing the chicken. Our server James was really great about it but I was upset that my husband had a great looking meal that was getting cold while waiting for mine. When they finally brought it out it had almost no sauce and was very dry and bland. Adding sauce after didn't bring the taste I am used to with this dish. I felt like I wasted my money. James was really great and tried to make up for it, but I was very disappointed. I think I'll stick with the Marina del Rey location."
Sarah E.,"Los Angeles, CA",235,218,346,4.0,4/15/2017,"Good old Cheesecake Factory-- a huge menu, with calories listed so you can feel motivated to go to that spin class the next day. The menu now has seasonal and vegetarian/gluten free options clearly market. The calorie count, while a buzzkill can make decision making a bit easier. They make a great dirty martini and their drink menus are actually very reasonably priced versus going to a local bar. They have an extensive list of sharing plates-- the flat-breads are awesome, chicken samosas have a good flavor. You have to order a slice of cheesecake to share at the end of your meal. The Godiva chocolate and fruit flavors are my favorite! Minus one star because the hostesses always seem to get some joy about saying how long the wait will be... maybe they have been beaten down by too many irritable customers. Even at 9pm there will be an hour wait. Snag a seat at the bar if you can, they are first come first serve."
YM K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/14/2017,Cheesecake Factory at the Grove is the worst on Friday night. Worst hostess today (ie Friday nite at 7.33pm). Got turned away because I was 1 minute pass the wait time. So much for letting my 5 year old to drop by the bathroom on the way. Waited 50minutes just to be turned away. Thanks hostess for making the wait worthwhile.....
Mike D.,"Wichita, KS",31,7,,4.0,7/28/2017,It's the Cheesecake Factory-full selection of every type of food and amazing desserts that are all expensive yet worth the experience.
Hye K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,5,2.0,3/31/2017,"Our server came after we waited for 15min, which means we didn't event get the water for like 15min. We also waited another 20min for food. Our server never came back after serving out food, and we had to waive at someone for a check. Also, there was a chunk of burnt bacon in my pasta and a piece of bowtie pasta in my friend's spaghetti, which seems very unprofessional. I understand that they are always busy, but in fact that the table in front of us were consistently checked by their server, I think  the quality of service is depends on a server."
Nikki B.,"Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",183,19,15,1.0,10/22/2016,"So... it was actually my roommate's birthday when we went. HIS FOOD HAD HAIR IN IT and the manger, James, told the whole table that he was going to ""take care"" of his food and that he was buying a round of cheesecake to our table. In our understanding (me, roommate, mom, pops), James was going to get my roommate's meal deducted from the bill and that everyone was going to get complimentary cheesecakes. That didn't happen.  What happened instead was 1. his food was still on the bill (after James said he would ""take care of it"") and 2. Only he (my roommate) was getting the complimentary cheesecake and not the rest of the table. Although it made sense my roommate was going to get the complimentary cheesecake, what we were not pleased about was how James CLEARLY said he was going to buy the whole table cheesecake and that he was going to ""take care"" of the bill.  It was CLEARLY said (""the whole table will get cheesecakes"") said AND implied (""I'll take care of it for you"") that his meal would be deducted AND we were getting complimentary cheesecakes. I felt really bad for my roommate. He was expecting to have a great time, we all did."
Osborn R.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,3.0,5/22/2017,"Definitely a nice seen for a date night if you ask me. Food was good, I got the herbs salmon fillet, combination of sauce and herbs really gave it a really good balance of favors. I would definitely get this dish again if I'm trying to eat something not so heavy. Service was okay, server did his job, no more, no less."
Vivian L.,"Inglewood, CA",12,585,236,1.0,11/5/2016,"The wait on Saturday night is literally insane. There is a 30 minute wait JUST TO GET a PAGER. Then you have to wait for them to call your pager. Your alternative is to fight like cavemen at the bar upstairs. Warning: People are vicious and it's kill or be killed like the African Sahara. I let a woman and baby, rightfully, grab a high table, but then there is NO ORDER. People just grab and jump in front and grab even though you've been waiting clearly before them. They really need to institute a list or line at least."
Leslie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,16,4.0,2/15/2017,"For my first time at any Cheesecake Factory and on valentines day ,what was expected to be a long wait turned out to be fast quick and easy. I absolutely loved it . The ambiance the setting perfect for a valentine dinner if you ask me. Great customer service everything was great except I must have ordered the wrong dish which wasn't so appetizing to my particular taste. However I did see other options on the menu that I might have enjoyed a little more and will definitely be returning to try something different. Plenty things to do afterwards, several stores . Very touristy everything about the Grove is lovely. Parking is validated for an hour or so I believe. Great place to visit. Highly recommend it."
Alex H.,"Los Angeles, CA",467,46,7,2.0,4/13/2017,"Mediocre, mediocre, mediocre. That's what you can expect from just about everything. Don't bring a large party here. Not good for groups at all. I would not eat here again. Management doesn't handle issues by means of trying to keep a clientele. So if you want to be treated like a corporate consumer, this is probably your cup of tea."
Patrisha E.,"Yucaipa, CA",69,12,3,1.0,8/27/2017,"Had to be the worst experience we have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. The music was way too loud, so much so that the server messed up orders. We passed on ordering appetizers because she said that the orders would be up quickly,  but that was not so so we awkwardly sat there ,because once again the music was so loud we couldn't even have any conversation. When our food did arrive ,my daughters pasta came without mushrooms because our server thought she said she didnt want any , also my daughters drink order was wrong but it took soo long to get it she just took what they gave. My waffles were burnt ,but again it took soo long I wasnt about to wait another 30 minutes. Needless to say I expected more , sad when Pleasanton, Irvine ,and Riverside are by far out perform..Unfortunately we were treating a friend from Japan and disappointed that this will be his one and only experience with a CF..."
Ken N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,12,,1.0,3/11/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory and the food!  But...the wait and service is rapidly going to hell.  Waited 30 mins for a salad and pasta to go.. People before us got their food before us.  Manager apologized and promised to give us cheesecake, but never came.  We told him about horrible waits and he said he worked at the Santa Monica Location and ""he knows"".   Fix the probs please"
Jess J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,2,1.0,3/3/2017,Hispanic entrance Host had the nastiest attitude ever maybe cheesecake should up her salary since everything is so pricey .
Amir A.,"Irvine, CA",58,39,6,1.0,8/23/2017,"I used to have good respect for Cheesecake Factory, but recently their quality and service has been declining. I have a major allergy issue, and we visited back in March. I ordered and specifically told the server 3 times to make the proper changes. I always get the same thing at other locations and they can accommodate. This server tried to have me to try something else instead, then went and checked with the back and came back to confirm they can do it. The food server (different person) even repeated the food order and the customization to me. After eating it, I started feeling ill. I asked the server again about the custom food and he said that's what you ordered. After a couple of more bites, I realized they were wrong and it was not customized. So the manager finally came over and confirmed it wasn't. He offered to pay for the meal of $40 which had no meaning for me and what I went thru that night. Thankfully it wasn't a hospital visit but still a painful night with no sleep. The manager even asked me for my name and number so he can check on me the next day. Guess what, no call. Probably thought I was a dine and dasher. I have been going to cheesecake since I was in my teens. Now it's just not something I will refer people to or go myself. I heard they are expanding, and we all know what can get lost during expansion; quality and service. This was a long time ago and I had a accidentally  placed it on the wrong location because of gps update. Sorry for the confusion."
Enn F.,"San Francisco, CA",7,4,1,3.0,3/25/2017,"My experience was honestly nothing special. The server wasn't attentive, was slow and pushy. But the food was wonderful. I ordered the meatball spaghetti, which was DELICIOUS! And I got a cream chocolate cake. It was good too, was very creamy and juicy, loved it. decor is cool and fancy. Overall, the food was delicious, but with such a big hall and busy servers, not a place I would come back for."
