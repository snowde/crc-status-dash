Josephine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,425,1832,3.0,5/18/2016,I went there for late lunch after the movies and it was 30min wait. The dining area is on 2nd floor so took the escalator up. It's smaller in size compared other locations. We sat in the patio and it was crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Our waiter was nice and good on refills by asking. I ordered my usual chicken Romano lunch special and it was delicious and smaller than regular dish. The free bread was delicious and fresh not crusty hard. Remember to validate the parking card.
Jordan W.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,191,150,4.0,9/29/2016,Been here a few times and have never been disappointed! There's almost always a little bit of a wait but the food quality and friendly service are just as dependable as getting bread delivered to your table upon arrival.  Always a solid choice and I'd recommend this location!
Giselle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,4,,5.0,1/19/2017,Omg I am addicted to the Cheesecake Factory especially on this location.  I come here with my husband all the time  Avocado egg rolls are a must!
Leslie C.,"Buena Park, CA",7,31,9,1.0,2/27/2017,"Me and my boyfriend came here February 10th. A little late on my review. We showed up around 9, the wait was about 15 -20 minutes. I have no complaints about the food itself. However will not be coming back. Our server, did not check on us. Our glasses were empty. There were 3 tables around us, and all surrounding tables got their food and appetizers before we did, and we had arrived before the others. Our server was not rude, however was very inattentive. I expected more, from such a nice location. I was wrong. Most likely will not return to this location."
Truman H.,"Los Angeles, CA",283,51,7,5.0,10/31/2016,"As I said on the phone -- while [that] one experience wasn't great... the whole thing that made it stand out is how freaking fantastic you guys typically are.  If ever there were a company to model by others who sought success, it's the operations, consistency and ethos of The Cheesecake Factory.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review -- and though the single experience truly was 2-stars... the comprehensive, lifetime review I have of your business is nothing short of 5."
Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",3715,733,1722,4.0,4/13/2015,"We went here for lunch. I had the Smoked BBQ Burger with fries; my friend had the veggies burger with a salad. The burger was great, but if you're looking for something somewhat healthy go for something else. I felt like I gained 10 lbs after eating the BBQ burger. Probably didn't help that I had a side of ranch to dip my fries in.  The service was great. Our ice teas and water were filled without having to ask our waiter. We sat outside and it was a beautiful day.  I've also been here several other times. The fried calamari is a must try, as well as the eggplant Parmesan. During dinner time it gets very busy. I've waited as long as an hour before. The good thing is they will send you a text when the table is ready so you don't have to wait around. Go shop and come back when you get the text. The grove has an hour of free parking, which means you'll end up paying if there's a slight wait or you plan on taking your time. I really enjoy this location. The outside seating is worth the wait when it's a nice day."
kim p.,"Burbank, CA",70,1,,1.0,8/12/2017,Food was fine. My husband left his sunglasses in the booth. When we returned a few minutes later to retrieve them the server tried to deny taking the glasses. Then another server told the other server that he broke down the table so he should have them. The hostess gave us attitude for asking about the sunglasses. Then the server finally said oh yeah I have them. So rude and unprofessional and overall strange. This location is a mess.
Gabriel ..,"Cathedral City, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/7/2017,"I don't understand why people leave bad reviews for the smallest things (the wait, the vibes, etc.) The food is amazing and never seems to disappoint me. Made with quality ingredients. It's the perfect restaurant."
Maya G.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,44,11,3.0,2/24/2017,Our server Bobbie was really nice however we got up to us the restroom and all of our food was gone... i understand you have people waiting for tables but please don't rush your customers out..
Asia S.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",203,158,106,4.0,2/5/2016,"I love this restaurant chain. I usually always have a good experience at which ever location I go.  This cheesecake is a nice spot. You can sit and order or get your food to go and in good time. If it's during their rush, they'll give You a buzzer. But you can easily waste 15-30mins walking around the Grove or Barnes n Nobles next door!!! The seating is upstairs, and you can also done in their outside seating area and get a sweet view of the Fountain.  Staff: pleasant, can be scant so you might need to get their attention Alcohol: pricey and not that strong but a large menu!  Food: good. I've never had any issues with my food at this location. Favs: Chicken Corn Tortillas, and their pastas !! Yum! Overall a good dining experience."
Mark T.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,38,63,3.0,6/6/2017,Lunch time at the bar is usually the shortest wait time for me here.  Usually only come during lunch and try to be in and out before the hour just so I don't have to pay for parking.  Best deal it get something from the lunch menu.  It's a smaller version of the regular dish and a lot cheaper.  Not much can be said that isn't already written.  Cheesecake is good but sometimes the special one are a tad to sweet for me.  Fan of the wheat bread so we just ask for it instead of the sourdough.  If you aren't in a rush there is always shopping to do once your meal is over. Just to burn those newly gained calories.
Lianne K.,"Simi Valley, CA",181,765,4289,2.0,2/6/2016,"Made a special trip to The Grove to see the decorations with the family visiting from the Bay Area during the holidays.  We were there after the stores closed, but Cheesecake Factory was still taking names for the waiting list at 9:30 at night. By the time we were seated, it was almost 10:00 PM.  Everyone was fading, and just seeking a slice of dessert and a beverage in a reasonable time frame. Instead, it was noisy, crowded, and though the servers were rocking and rolling, it was hard to get decent service. Everything at this location appears larger than life - the interior design is on a grand scale, the  second floor feels like being 3 or 4 stories high in the air.  The portions are big and expensive, to boot. By the time we were able to order and be served, it was late, late, late.  It just felt over the top on so many levels.  Was very happy to get out of there and back down to street level, which was blissfully quiet at the hour."
Derek L.,"San Jose, CA",140,216,708,2.0,8/5/2016,"This is more of a review regarding the layout they have here, which is just completely nonsensical. Why the heck do they have two check in stations that seem to operate separately?! When you walk in the door downstairs, you check in at the host stand. They tell you when you can go upstairs, presumably because your table is ready and someone will seat you upstairs. Well, tough luck. We went upstairs as instructed, no one helped us or greeted us upstairs so we walked around til we found a waiter and asked if we could just grab a table, since there were plenty at this hour. He told us to go back to the host stand, where the hostess was more interested in gossiping with her friend than she was in providing customer service. She made sure she finished her conversation before she attended to my party and the other parties waiting, with lots of attitude, mind you. Outrageous. I just don't understand what the point of checking in downstairs is if you have to check in again upstairs. Like logically, for crowd control purposes, you should check in downstairs, and then have the party go upstairs when someone upstairs is ready to seat you. Seamless process right? THe way they have it set up, upstairs is a total fire hazard. You have people waiting to be seated, and probably confused why no one is helping them. You have people oogling at the cheesecake displays. And you have people trying to exit the restaurant too. Three way traffic in a tiny hundred square foot radius."
Tiffani M.,"Baltimore, MD",30,69,55,5.0,8/13/2016,"Walked over to the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove for the happy hour from 4-6pm... They have a special menu with drinks and full sized appetizers for $5.50. It's only in the bar area so it can get crowded, we were able to get two tall boy tables in the bar area and we had 9 people in our group. Our waiter (sorry can't remember his name) was wonderful! Very accommodating and helpful. We probably ordered 1-2 of everything on the happy hour menu, I had a few Long Island iced teas, which were not in the least bit strong, but that's expected for $5.50. We had unlimited bread and butter and the place can get a little loud, but overall, I would go back because it was a fun get together for us. My daughter was also able to meet Zendaya and she was really sweet and took time to take pictures with a couple of the little girls who saw her."
Ed M.,"San Francisco, CA",63,16,1,5.0,3/19/2017,The service is amazing and the interior design is fancy. The menu is as big as a chapter book and most of the food is fresh. The food is delicious and there is a lot of diversity between the cheesecake flavors. Overall this place is amazing and the waiters have an amazing attitude.
Christina C.,"New York, NY",431,203,421,1.0,7/27/2016,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. I've always loved eating at this chain restaurant ever since in junior high. My go-to dish is the Pasta Da Vinci, and after 10+ years, I always still crave it every time I walk past a Cheesecake Factory. There is a location near my office, so I decided to grab the pasta dish as take out. HUGE mistake ordering from here as this place is in the Grove.. which basically equals super packed and full of tourists. When I got back to my apartment, I noticed my food was barely lukewarm and watery. The dish barely had a taste (and the little taste it did have.. was pretty funky) and did not taste ANYTHING like the other times I've gotten the Pasta Da Vinci. There was also pieces of pasta that did not belong. The dish comes with penne, but there were random pieces of farfalle and other types of pasta. I also found a couple pieces of sausage that obviously should not be there.... since this dish does not come with sausages... makes me wonder how they cook the food... Thanks to this location, I don't think I'll ever want to go to another Cheesecake Factory again. So thanks for ruining that for me."
Caroline G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",538,186,788,2.0,2/10/2015,"horrible service in the ""Bar area"" which is the area assigned for ""First Come First Serve""!!!  It has been vary accessible compared to waiting an average of 45 minutes to an hour!!!  And be careful you don't get into a bar fight because these hungry people don't MESSing around! LMAO!!!  The last couple times I went i waited for about 10 mins and a didn't want to hover over the guy that was leaving, so I thought I'll just wait until he leaves, I mean NO ONE wants crazy people running up to your every move that looks like your about to finish! This Lady runs up to th chair and says what... ""SORRY ITS FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE!!"" Im like wow!  So beside that craziness... Well let's start with the food, if you sit at the bar and not the high table area behind it, your food and service will be great..  But if you sit in the bar area that has separate tables well service is crap!! And food comes out LATE,Half way cold and the avocado eggrolls I usually get where dark brown when suppose to be well YEAH GREEN!!  the food is hit or miss.. The service is iffy.. But the management does the best they can:) HORTIBLE"
Julie K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",988,590,41,3.0,8/8/2016,"I went today with my family/clients .. 6 of us. three of them where children. I had the same thing I always get, the apz of Chicken thai salad. Two orders of avacado rolls, kids had mac n cheese , burgers and pork chops... good stuff... The bread is always fantastic.. (Even if I don't wat it) haha. The waitress had the best tie, storm troopers... She was A+... Good spot."
Nick N.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,15,,2.0,9/18/2016,"Now I was going to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but seeing other reviews changed my mind. I love The Cheesecake Factory, this was my first time to this location and I was disappointed. With the two check in stations seems to cause a lot of organization issues. We received a buzzer and was told it would be a 30 minute wait. After 20 minutes it went off and there seemed to be 5 other groups waiting to be seated. We waited another 10 minutes to be brought to a table, with no napkins or silverware. The food was decent, and the waiter was friendly, as usual. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned all day. I probably wouldn't return to this location. Glad to see you guys replied. I do love the Cheesecake Factory, this was my only visit that wasn't great! I hope you guys can improve this location."
Alex A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,96,9,2.0,2/11/2017,"Usually on top of their stuff, but this Friday I was rather disappointed. Ordered a Carbonara that came out as a pasta soup. Watery, zero taste. Normally I don't send my food back, but it was so bad that I had no choice. Second time it came out it was less watery(but still soupy) and still tasteless. (FYI; Had the same dish in Beverly Hills earlier this week, and it was delicious). Sent it back again but this time I didn't wanna take a chance on the same dish, so I got an alternative dish which came out decent. Service wise it sucked. The manager did replace the dish, but it was in a very mechanical way. No apologies, just didn't seem to give a damn. I mean; It's not that I think he should be on his knees,  but at least gave the courtesy to pretend like you care- Specially since you're the manager. The bartender was lagging like crazy when it came to pouring wine, and we had empty glasses for a loooong time. Finally ended up moving to the place next door, where we were taken care of. This review is based on the last visit. With exception of earlier this week, I've in general been very satisfied with both the food and the service at this location. But the last visits does bring down my rating unfortunately."
