Sandy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,90,12,4.0,1/30/2017,"I've been coming to this location since college, and I am never disappointed. I love sitting outside on the balcony overlooking the shops. Every time I have gone, our server has been very courteous and attentive. I have been to the location in Redondo Beach, and the service could have been better. I love their ""Evelyn's favorite pasta,"" hot spinach and cheese dip, and strawberry cheesecake...very addicting!"
Chhaya N.,"Los Angeles, CA",225,291,1038,3.0,11/11/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory however today was unbelievably overcrowded and no one was managing lines or making it easy to even enter the restaurant.  The line for one person was 35-40 mins.  The hostesses at front were trying to help too many people so no one person had their attention which made service even slower. They suggested I go upstairs and try for bar seating but because of the unmanaged crowds people were crowding everyone in the bar area and fighting for seats. When a seat finally opened up I had to compromise with a couple by agreeing to split a table we had both spotted at the same time but we weren't allowed to sit there because although in the bar area, it isn't considered the bar.  I left. I don't need a seat that bad, with that much stress, and management doing nothing to help. It is a shame because I was really looking forward to lunch."
Sarah S.,"Clonsilla, Dublin, Republic of Ireland",63,344,1978,5.0,4/17/2015,Came here in the middle of a touristy tour of LA as we visited the grove. We could've chosen anywhere to go because of the huge farmers market but I had a serious craving for cheesecake so this is where we went.. Place was absolutely packed but we managed to get seats for three at the bar. I chose the oreo cheesecake and a coffee.  I love Cheesecake Factory. I wish they'd come to Dublin!!
Denise O.,"Long Beach, CA",8,3,1,1.0,1/4/2017,Very poor service by the table arranger-Joe. We waited 1 1/2 hours when we were told our wait is only one hour. We went upstairs to check up again and it's only then that we were accommodated but in separate tables. They could have told us that in the first place rather than having us wait for almost 2 hours since they said the table we are waiting on still has people drinking. No common sense and respect for the customers.
Steve T.,"Los Angeles, CA",541,16,,3.0,7/14/2016,"Quite the ""eh"" experience. Wouldn't be my first pick, wouldn't be my last. Everything was very mediocre. Happy hour pricing is vey reasonable of you sit at the bar. We had about 4 appetizers, 1 entree and an additional side dish. Bill was 60 dollars which is not bad for 2. Our waitress was super sweet and did the best she could with being attentive. Everything took a while but it wasn't anything super ridiculous. If you're just getting out of work and wanna drop in for a small bite and some cheap drinks, recommend it.  But side note like come on with making servers and bartenders dress like the help. It's 2016 and you can have a fine dining experience without having your server running around in a sweaty Oxford shirt 3 sizes too big for them. It makes me uncomfortable because I know they are uncomfortable!"
Suzy L.,"Pasadena, CA",74,15,,1.0,12/30/2016,"ok, what happened to this place!  old bread to start with, dirty glasses -  I had the turkey burger that was definitely not the same as the other  cheesecake factories, and the fries were cold and stale!  blah"
Nicole J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,8,1.0,5/30/2016,"I tried to order in advance because I know  they can get busy.  I guess I'm an idiot, because that clearly doesn't work. I was on hold for 18 minutes. I LITERALLY had time to drive there, sit at the turn arrow to turn into the grove, park on level 4,walk to the elevator, WAIT for the elevator, walk to the restaurant, smile at the host in the front, slowly go up the escalator, wait for 2 people in front of me to be helped..and was STILL on hold..I literally showed the woman at the counter that I was on hold..and then she looked down at the phone and say ""oh""..........what in the actual f*uck???"
Nellie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,235,162,3.0,1/20/2017,"This CF is at the Grove which means parking is ridiculous and the line to eat here is even more ridiculous! We had to wait 30 minutes for a buzzer then 45 minutes for it to buzz. It was absolute chaos at the entrance with people trying be put on the list, to turn in buzzers, to get buzzers, OMG it was crazy and there were just two people working. I felt so bad for them. However, after the chaos, we were finally seated and our waiter was amazing and very attentive. My cajun pasta was very good and the cheesecake was even better of course. I would suggest to not come here on the weekend but if you must, just get ready to wait and walk through mazes made of bodies -_-"
Tatiana E.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,10,,2.0,7/24/2017,"I was here with my husband and daughter for lunch sometime last week. We waited about 15 minutes for a table, not bad. The server took about 10 minutes to get to us and was a little unfriendly, fine by me at this point since we were starving and wanted something to eat. He got us our drinks and we asked him for some bread as we ordered our meals. This is the reason for the 2 star. I am not joking, but I set my timer on my phone to check and see how long it took for him to get us the bread. 20 minutes go by and no bread!!! We flagged down another server that was walking by and mentioned to her that we requested bread from our server but he never got it. She was nice enough and brought us the bread herself. At this point its been 7 more minutes when she finally got us the bread. We did see our server walk up and down to the table across from us and next to us with bread and drink refills. Finally, another 15 minutes after we got the bread we get our meals. We requested refills on the drinks and more bread (its 3 of us and we're starving) . As we started eating our Santa Fe chicken salads we both noticed there was NO chicken in any of the 2 salads. I order the lunch size and my husband ordered the full size, the menu clearly says ""marinated chicken"" so I was expecting some kind of marinated chicken. We have ordered this salad at other locations and have notices they add very little chicken, not to say none. By the time the server came back to check on us again, we were almost done with our meals, but when he did we mentioned to him the chicken issue and he did in fact apologize (that is why I did 2 stars even though the chicken is not his fault but he did apologize) he  offer to bring us some chicken on the side or change our meals. We opted for chicken on the side for the salads. Will probably keep coming to Cheesecake since we do like their food but they need to work a little more on customer service and quality control."
Jonathan C.,"Walnut, CA",237,9,3,4.0,9/10/2016,"Always love coming to Cheesecake Factory. The pasta de Vinci was amazing, but as I was finishing my dish I bit into some charcoal bits. Was a sucky ending to a great meal"
Roland L.,"Los Angeles, CA",872,158,371,4.0,2/5/2016,"Cheesecake Cheesecake Cheesecake, enough said Being located at the Grove its nice. its close with lots of things to do but it sucks at the Grove because its always always super crowded. That aside the staff always has a smile and give you a buzzer so when your table is ready you can come. its has a good distance so that you can at least can shop some. Its hard to explain what to get here, if you never been then you need to come. The menu is a size of a large book. lots of things and they do brunch too with a different menu. Great drink menu lots of fruity drinks  Free bread and butter two kinds :) I love the skinny menu and come here for lunch all the time. I get the grilled chicken with pasta  I always get the food the way i requested.  Now for dessert. The cheesecake is good. Lots of different flavors and they always have a seasonal flavor.  My fav is the red velvet cheesecake and the second is key lime. I plan to come back and they do take out too."
Christophe A.,"Saint-Cloud, France",5,5,33,2.0,7/12/2016,"I was disappointed 2 times at this location. The waiters are not very nice and are rude. Besides,the food arrives always lukewarm and I hate this.The waiters don't even checked me if everything was good or not,he did like it was a fast food place. This location is to avoid."
Emily A.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Worst service of my life. When we first arrived, we waited easily forty five minutes for our buzzer to go off (we were told it would be less than twenty minutes). When we stood to be seated, we were told the table wasn't ready yet and they'd call us by name. When we FINALLY got seated after being there over an hour, we didn't see a waiter for almost thirty minutes. By the time he got there, we already knew what we wanted and asked for water please and then ordered the rest of our meal and dessert. The waiter was once again nowhere to be seen for yet another twenty minutes (so, to recap, we had been in the building almost two hours, seated for nearly an hour, and hadn't even seen a glass of water). He finally arrives with water and what we had ordered for dessert, without bringing out bread or our appetizers or our entree. We asked for the check early. We didn't touch dessert as we wanted our other food first, we finished both our waters with no refill for over forty minutes, and after yet another twenty minutes he brings out a basket of bread and a check. (My partner and I had started timing these rare visits as a betting game, it had gotten so bad.) It would be a while longer on our appetizer, he said. Could we wait another thirty minutes? At this point I could've laughed. We canceled the remainder of our order, paid for our cheesecake and left.  So, we had been seated nearly two hours before we got our bread basket. Nearly an hour before we got a glass of water and forty minutes for a refill. We had been in the building nearly three hours before being told we'd have to wait longer for even our appetizer. As we didn't want to be eating mediocre pasta when the sun came up, we had to leave early. I've worked in food service before. I've worked busy nights and have dealt with being understaffed, fussy customers, the lot. They were not understaffed, it wasn't particularly busy, and from what we could observe many tables in our section were barely ever checked on, many had finished drinks and long finished their bread or food and were simply waiting for someone to swing by.  We will absolutely not be returning to this location."
Armando Z.,"Downey, CA",20,80,438,4.0,10/19/2015,"Not the best experience having gone with a small group of friends. The waiter seemed really annoyed that we weren't ready. Three out of the four of us were first timers which I can see why it could be a problem. That said, we finally ordered and everything came in soon after.  At the end the waiter began to loosen up and made us feel a little more at home. With that, we went ahead and tried some of his suggested cheesecakes. I wasn't disappointed with my choice. I went with the seasonal pumpkin and pecan cheesecake. It was really good. If you like pumpkin pie and pecan pie that's for you."
Omar A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,5.0,8/31/2017,Alain was amazing. We never had to wait for water. Never had to ask for anything. Never had an attitude. Today is my birthday and he had no idea. This service I received was the best I've ever received. If every sever were this way I wouldn't be sure where to go or recommend to friends. But we'll be sure to come back here
Helen K.,"Inglewood, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/8/2017,I hate to even give these bitches 1star.  They deserve a fucking 0. How dare these rude disrespectful mother fcks had the audacity to have the poorest customer service on my parents wedding anniversary date this past Sunday. They were trying to have a nice dinner and asked for the check and this rude ass bitch caught herself talking to my mother in such a rude ass manner. 'Wait a second' no. How about a 'just a moment please' or I'll be right with you? Wtf is wrong with that. People pay with their hard earned money to come out and eat. It just had to be a black waitress acting out. Idk her name but I wish I did. Fuck u bitch!
Samer H.,"West Hollywood, CA",166,53,56,1.0,5/30/2017,Waiter stopped  once to check on us And waited 20 minute for silverware and I had to get up and go get them  Not sure what was going on or busy on Friday but I think the quality shouldn't go down this was the worse his name is terrele I believe but I was really disappointed  with the service
Chris D.,"West Hollywood, CA",7,6,2,5.0,4/18/2016,"Omg I love this place. You can't miss. Literally the best food I've ever had. The huge menu gives you world of flavors. Every time I there I step out satisfied and full. All the dishes are strongly recommended. The place is romantic and placed on top of the grove. You will be experiencing outstanding feeling seating at the balcony.  What I liked the most is the service. Apple, our server, was 100% helpful. He took care of us so elegantly and nice. To be honest the management are doing great job running this place. We ordered one dish by mistake and they changed it in a second, no question, with smile. I'll come back for sure. Wish all the places would be like this place."
Karem C.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,5,,4.0,4/11/2017,"Very good, a little pricey, large servings. The cheesecake is great. A good spot for an happy hour before a movie next door."
Foodie B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,9,,1.0,7/1/2017,"My friends and I are dinner here a few nights ago after the outdoor movie. The waitress was great but the older white lady with short hair kept rushing us out. She interrupted us mid convo saying ""we're closed you have to go!"" We still had food and half a bottle of champagne left. It's not our fault the food came out later and we had to eat it shortly after they closed. I can't believe how rude she was. I never want to go back."
