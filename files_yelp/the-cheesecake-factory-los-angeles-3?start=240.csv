Simone L.,"Inglewood, CA",55,29,,5.0,1/8/2017,Excellent food and great service!  Love this location and the wait wasn't bad for a party of 4 on a Sat @ 1pm.
Maher B.,"North Hollywood, CA",98,25,50,5.0,9/10/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory at The Grove is a very romantic and beautiful restaurant to eat at. I typically only go here if I have a date, as the ambiance and shopping places around it (and the fountain that is outside with the water shows) make this place quite enjoyable.  The food is just the same as any other Cheesecake Factory. Delicious, and the food comes out in a very reasonable amount of time.  We started off with one of my favorite appetizers. The Thai lettuce wraps. This thing is DELICIOUS. Always has amazing flavor. If you've never had it before please try it you'll love it. The sauces are savory the meat is perfectly cooked and wow. Just wow. Get it.  I got the garlic noodles with chicken. I normally get the Pasta Di Vinci (my favorite one) or the Spicy Chipotle Chicken. The garlic noodles were not as flavorful as those other two dishes. Nowhere near them. In fact the noodles tasted watered down which was disappointing.  My friend got the ribeye steak. THAT was delicious. A beautiful medium cook and it came with fries.  Gentleman if you're planning on bringing a date here, you won't be disappointed."
Evy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,1,3.0,9/24/2016,"This location is ALWAYS busy. I even came here for dinner at 8PM on a Tuesday night one time and it was still busy; we had to take a buzzer and wait 30 minutes before we could get a table. I recently came here for lunch with a colleague and made a reservation to avoid the 30 minute wait but we still had to wait 10 minutes upstairs to be seated. I debated about giving my review 4 stars, but the consistently long wait times here annoy me so much that I couldn't do it. I've had pretty good, attentive servers here though. No complains about the service. Expect at least a 20 minute wait for food... The last time I was here, we had to wait way longer than that for our food though which was annoying. I love the food and drinks here; it's generally on par. The only time I didn't enjoy the food was the time I ordered a Classic Burger; it tasted so bland that I could only eat a quarter of it. My favorite menu items are the nachos and their milkshakes!"
David A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/2/2017,I love cheesecake factory but this place sucks. We had to wait for an hour before we can be seated and when it was time to be seated they messed that up too instead of sitting us outside on the padio they sat us down inside i had to ask them numerous of times to be seated outside. Then it took them 45 to an hour to bring our appitizers and another 1 hour for our food which was cold like alaska
Gerry B.,"West Los Angeles, CA",14,22,13,1.0,6/21/2017,Bad experience with a take out. I live pretty close but what was supposed to be a Cobb salad became a chopped salad. The order taker admitted the wrong doing but what a waste of time. You think they just switch the salad and take care of the difference but I still had to pay $3. By the time I ate my other order it was terrible cold. I guess Cheesecake Factory doesn't stand by quality service or food.
Kat A.,"Burbank, CA",1028,13,6,5.0,7/30/2016,Taylor is lovely.  Me and my friend lucked out by heading to the bar area when given a quote for an hour wait.  All her recommendations were perfect.
Porsja T.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",125,9,,5.0,4/12/2017,Wonderful courteous service by Travis G. He anticipated our every need from water to napkins and generous recommendations. He was patient with our party as we celebrated my mother's birthday. Travis was attentive and proactive with our entire dining experience. Thank you Travis G. We appreciate outstanding service which is rare these days.
Xiao Q.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",38,1,1,4.0,4/1/2017,Gosh their steak is always well done when I request for medium. Consecutively two times I got my steak well done (tough) instead of medium. however we got it change in a short timing. And because at the same time unfortunately I have eggshell in my meatball (I ordered spaghetti and meatball). The waiter (Alex) got it change as well and they offered us free desserts :)
Michelle E.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",70,71,120,5.0,6/1/2016,"Great location and service! Everytime we are at The Grove we eat here, top floor seating! You can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory. We always seem to get the same dish... Miso Salmon and start with Crab Wontons and fresh tropical Iced Tea. Thank you to our beautiful and attentive server, Rebecca R!  Tip: Take advantage coming during lunch hours for the Lunch Specials (dinner sizes at lunch prices!). Happy Eating!"
Walt S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,59,,1.0,7/5/2017,"Not quite sure why we go there.  I suspect because there is something for everyone in your party with the large varied menu.  Wife called two time to make reservations for the 4th including a request for a piece of birthday cheesecake.  Got TWO different answers as to when one could begin making reservations on two different calls.  Finally, we were told just to arrive at 11:30a to put name on a list.  Arrive at 11:30a to find the CF had been seating folks since 11:00a!   Obviously no one there knows what is going on. The kids had a cheese pizza, only to find it was burnt.  Had the three tacos.  Salad (escabeche vegetables) had no dressing.  ""Spicy chicken"" had no flavor.   Chicken pasta was ""ok""  Club sandwich was ""ok.""        Wife had to ask the waitress about the slice of cheesecake with candle for my birthday   twice (when she made reservation) and at reception, a third time.  Waitress did not know any request for a birthday cheesecake.  To the credit of the waitress, she did an excellent job, but the rest of the experience did not go well.           Find someplace else folks"
Nicholas W.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,6,3,5.0,12/26/2016,This location is probably my favorite. Dined in the bar area waiter came right over took our orders but was unsure about the orders management came out just to double check our orders and food was prepared great give 5 stars for today's experience this location never disappoints.
Sean J.,"Santa Ana, CA",352,1,,1.0,6/15/2017,"I'm currently here with my group of my young friend and we are all around 20. Our service was terrible and seemed as if he automatically assumed that we didn't have money let it be our age or attire but we all are reasonably successful and have plenty of money for tips and our meals. Also the food was all served Luke warm and ""light tomatoes"" ended up being 75% of the plate this place needs to step their game up and stop assuming young people will not tip. We all also work in tip driven professions and know the value of good service and will tip our servers accordingly. We didn't get refills I had to ask twice for silverware because we were a group of 5 seated at a 4 person booth and a spare chair on the end with no space for drinks or food. Also we were never offered Dessert and it seemed as if he just wanted us to leave by pushing all the checks to us I also did not receive my change while writing this review cheese cake is like my 94 cents back"
Anna V.,"Los Angeles, CA",913,62,2,5.0,1/19/2017,"First time the other week at this location and it was awesome! I went with my grandma during the week on a cold rainy day. When we entered we went up the escalators after being greeted by the hostess and it was beautiful going up. The interior reminded me of the Ceasars Palace in Vegas.. really pretty inside. We had terrific service can't remember our waiters name but he was talkative and great! Food was amazing and I thought the Marina location was my favorite yet this may be the winner. I love their avocado spring rolls, the bellagio, chicken romano, bang bang chicken, and the red velvet Cheesecake. Soooo good!!! I'll be coming back."
Aracely F.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,23,8,4.0,7/31/2016,"Cheesecake Factory isn't something that can really go wrong. I know what to expect and my expectations were fulfilled. We came for lunch around 11:30 and were able to be seated promptly. Our server Eric was phenomenal and attentive to our table. We tried the Thai lettuce wraps and highly recommend them as an appetizer. My only issue with this location, or in general The Grove as a whole, is that people are so adamant about bringing their pets into restaurant and retail stores. Why does your dog need to be present in these locations? Some lady had her dog who kept barking at customers and servers walking by. Not so great when you keep hearing a high pitched dog bark every couple minutes. Beyond that I was satisfied with both the meal and service. I did notice though that by 1 the place was much more packed so come early to beat the crowd."
Shawn L.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",871,119,141,5.0,7/31/2016,"Great customer service. Always on point. One of my regular restaurants. Reasons why: Staff is friendly, on point and goes above and beyond. They also allow late night call in pick up orders which helps if you're on a time restraint ;) Will be back soon.! Thanks to the gentlemen at the pick up counter.! God bless you guys are the best. !"
Mary F.,"Moreno Valley, CA",244,9,1,5.0,12/19/2016,"What a Great experience!!! This isn't my first time visiting at cheesecake factory. But it is my first time visiting this location! A year ago I was diagnosed with celiac disease and it's hard to go out. Cheesecake factory makes it very easy and enjoyable!! Surprisingly, they have a large variety of completely gluten-free appetizers, salad, entrées, and even pastas!  Tristan gave us the best service and went over and above to answer all our questions!!!! The bus boy (Baltazar) even overheard us wishing we had asked for water to go, and went out of his way to get it, even though they were closed! ***I didn't even mention the gorgeous view from the balcony that overlooks the gorgeous Christmas lights at the grove!!!  Hands-down to this place! Highly highly recommend it!!"
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,20,1.0,6/8/2017,"I'm literally only giving this restaurant 1 star because the food is good but the service sucks! Yesterday my Dad who was visiting from Ohio, his girlfriend and my wife went here to eat. The waiter was so rude. He brought 4 waters only 3 of them had straws. It took 20 minutes to get the waters when I asked for another straw he never brought it. I asked him when we could put in an order he said he's serving a ton of table when there was only 3 table including my own that he was serving then when more people sat down he took there order. He continued to avoid or serve us hell I even apologized to him for being so busy and asking for a straw. The service was so bad that the validation they gave us ran out. That's how long it took to be served by this horrible server. I literally wanted a nice last meal with my father. I got a huge F you send off dinner from the Cheesecake Factory. Prior to this time there are 2 other occasions that the service was horrible but I love the food! The food is always so good but I can't see myself eating at this place again"
Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,4,1.0,9/6/2017,"If I could give it a 0 I would! My friend and I came all the way from Canada to specifically visit the Cheesecake Factory at the grove! We chose to sit in the bar so we didn't have to wait to get seated. It wasn't until about 15 minutes after we sat down to get greeted and ""served"". It was already getting late, so we made our decisions quickly and we're ready to order promptly. She brought us our drinks before we even got to tell her what we wanted as an appetizer. She was in a hurry to leave us. We shouted after her as she tried to ignore us. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms to start and again she proceeded to walk away even though we weren't finished. We waited another 30 min for the stuffed mushrooms to come out, which came out so cold they might as well have had icicles hanging from them! We were disgusted and outraged. We tried looking for our server. We even asked the manager to look for her. Our request was ignored... Finally we got her attention. We told her the stuffed mushrooms were cold. All she said was ""do you want a new order?"" We refused! No apology what so ever. At this point our jaws were basically on the floor. We were beyond outraged. Our experience only continued to get worse. The take out order we requested had no sauce what so ever. There was not a drop of sauce in sight. It was was supposed to be a bow tie pasta with white wine sauce. It was so dry I felt like I needed to go to the hospital for dehydration but I'm Canadian and don't have insurance. I do have to say our cheesecake was pretty good. But with a name like the Cheesecake Factory. It would be despicable if it wasn't! Overall we are extremely disappointed with our service. We are traveling back to Canada immediately and telling everyone!"
Guy G.,"Honolulu, HI",0,88,7,3.0,4/7/2016,This is for the Grove location only. The good: Pizza and salad were excellent. It was open late. The view from the patio was pretty nice. The price was ok. The bad: The staff. The host tries to be cheerful but makes odd jokes about peoples names. The server was cranky and nit picky taking orders. The food runner ignores several calls pretending not to hear them. The bread basket has gotten a lot smaller. I think the staff at the new Santa Monica location is a lot nicer.
Fahad A.,"Tempe, AZ",1,24,12,4.0,11/9/2015,"First time in Cheesecake Factory. Great experience and all. Ordered ""ultimate "" a velvet cheesecake, gosh it was amazing and a little too sweet for my taste plus that thing was huge. Staff is great, though it would be confusing for first timers with the greeting/seating arrangement .  Location is great, its the grove after all . Bathroom isn't capable of handling their costumer capacity . Overall good"
