Kiran S.,"Vaughan, Canada",0,10,,4.0,8/9/2017,"Went on a Saturday afternoon, it was my sister's first time so she was excited and our server Travis was very quick and attentive. Obviously amazing cheesecakes. I would go here for the service."
Elida R.,"Pasadena, CA",44,3,1,1.0,3/31/2016,Sitting here waiting to be seated.  We have 6 people waiting to be seated on a party of 9 according to the person at the door we have to have 6.6 people here to be seated. Unbelievable. According to him it corporate policy. I feel customer service should be priority.
Annie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,3,,5.0,12/9/2016,"I remember last year in September 20 my family and a few of my cousins we all went to eat in Cheesecake Factory. When we went inside the restaurant I was like oh my god!!! It was a big restaurant and super fancy at that with a lot of customers  The service was really good. The workers were friendly people and not rude at all to every customers. In the restaurant the customers were also really friendly and everyone was enjoying their food.  There was many good food in the restaurant. All the selection of food that they had looked delicious. The price looked expensive but in the plate they gave you a lot of food and the plate wasn't a small one it was a big plate. I remember that i ordered a chicken shrimp soup and it was the best soup I ever had in my life. I just wish that i would have gotten more shrimp than chicken. My brother ordered some nachos and it came with A LOT of cheese and meat. It was a huge plate in my opinion. After we finished eating we all ordered cheesecakes. I order a new York style cheesecake. It was super delicious. My cousin ordered a double cheese burger or some type of burger but damn it was really big and with the mouth of cheese it had i think it look like a juicy burger. I would recommend this to all my friends especially one of my close friend Maricruz because I am pretty positive that she will love it, she loves cheesecake and i would say hey i found the best cheesecake ever and you should try it in Cheesecake Factory it is worth it!!"
Alaina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,5,4,1.0,3/29/2016,"I'm from out east, I wanted to treat myself and a friend to 'guaranteed' great food, and this used to be one of my top 5 fave chain restaurants of all time, so I will be as nice as I can w/this review: Got seats fast, within 25 mins-- sat in outside area that barely had other people And now that I've stated the ONLY pros, I wish to get started with the cons: But, let's make it interesting and use a point system! -the virgin sweet cocktails were COMPLETELY FLAVORLESS, it tasted like I was drinking a FLAVORLESS rosy pink colored ice slush (-1pt) -replaced it with a straberry lemonade, settling for a tasty alternative....but was again disappointed, with a pink colored watery lemonade....(-1pt) -would have ordered another option, but it seemed that my server was too busy being just too busy to answer our tables needs (-2pt) -finally received my salad after about 20 mins of munching on bread, and to my surprise it arrived extremely soggy without any added dressing (-3) -ordered the herbed salmon with a small request of garlic mash and the server assured me that they can do it However, what I had received was 3 heaping spoons of minced garlic carefully spread atop only a ladle's worth of mash potatoes....(-10pts) Do these chefs @ this location even know how to cook??? I know of no one who can stomach 1 spoon of raw minced garlic and still taste their meal enough to enjoy it....I'm included, since I was unable to stop tasting garlic after downing my previous drink, and trying to nibble on anything else..... But hey, this is the nice version. And considering the above math, I will never eat @ cheesecake factory in the grove again!"
Jaime L.,"Santa Monica, CA",1450,1057,137,2.0,5/8/2015,"You know, I'm absolutely convinced that The Cheesecake Factory is literally last resort food. ""Hey, what do you want to eat. You want to go to [this place]?"" ""Nah, how about [that place]?"" ""No, we went there last week. What about [another place]?"" ""Not feeling that tonight."" 30 MINUTES LATER ""Ugh. Cheesecake Factory?"" ""Why do you hate us?"" Sure their cheesecake is good. There are a billion different kinds - one for everyone! But it's so mass produced. And the food - oh god. Look, if you have a menu with 12 pages dedicated to your GIGANTIC MENU, then chances are you don't do everything great. You do everything just good enough for people to power through until dessert. Their drinks are too goddamn sugary. If I order a whiskey cocktail, I'd like to taste the whiskey. Not the sugar you put in it. Is there something on this menu that doesn't have 80g of sugar attached to it? No? Fuck. The service is nice - at least it was for me. A little forgetful, and I had to remind them of things, but what person hasn't been stressed out? Don't be a dick. Just be like, ""Hey, could I get that [item they forgot]? Thanks."" In the meantime, for dinner I'm just going to eat a protein bar. Or if you've let out of the movie...go somewhere else. You're in LA for godssake."
Brian C.,"Northridge, CA",85,26,47,2.0,10/25/2016,"The grove is beautiful place. The Cheesecake Factory fits right in. The food here is not bad. They have an extensive menu, I usually get a glam burger and I'm really satisfied. This visit I decided to try their Cajun chicken littles. They were not great. Basically chicken tenders (small) with dipping sauce. I felt like I was a kid again except I paid 15-17 dollars for chicken strips. Not a fan of it but the desserts here are amazing. I personally love cheesecake so their classic New York cheesecake with strawberry  is always good. Don't forget to get your ticket validated on the way out. Could save you some money"
Veronica S.,"Misawa, Japan",85,172,364,4.0,7/31/2014,"I went around 4 and had to wait about 10-15 min... Which was great! Our waiter Daniel was absolutely amazing! He was on point and when he went home for the night out new waiter Howard, I believe, was awesome too!! Even the gentlemen who brought our dinner plates out was extremely nice!  My dinner, the skinnylicious Asian salad, needed more flavor to it. It was very bland and I felt like I was eating air! Lol the wild blueberry white chocolate cheesecake was delicious!!!  For as big as this restaurant is... Only having 3 stalls for the women's restroom is ridiculous!!! It's beyond tiny! I mean small!!!"
Becca D.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,143,59,5.0,7/29/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is one of those places you forgive for being a chain... The food is always excellent and so are the drinks and the service. I highly recommend the skinny angel hair pasta with shrimp and the Chinese chicken salad... Some of my personal favorites!  Something honorable to mention about this location in particular: I witnessed a waiter spill a drink on a customer at the next table. The customers were old and very upset about it, they weren't yelling or anything but they had disgusted and pissed looks on their faces and said nothing. A few minutes later, the manager approached their table and apologized and offered the meal free for the person the drink was spilt on. They made sure to make it up to the customer"
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,4/28/2015,"Given the location at the Grove, this Cheesecake Factory gets really full, so expect a long wait or go during off hours like right when they open or for a late dinner. Service was fine, not really stellar, they are busy and just trying to get through the line of people waiting to eat next. The menu is insane, way too much really, but usually everything that comes out is pretty good. One of the better chains when it comes to quality, prices are a bit higher, but portions are large and you can easily have left overs for later making the price justified. They also have a pretty good happy hour which is my favorite time to come here. Perfect for pleasing a large group of people with different tastes."
Shawn C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,4,,4.0,2/10/2017,I love this place! The avocado egg rolls are to die for!
Inbal P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,43,6,3.0,3/30/2016,"Love the food. Servers are always really nice, accommodating and knowledgeable. But why do I need to put myself on the list and come back 30 minutes later to get a buzzer, then wait 45 more minutes and then go up and wait 10 more minutes to be seated.  And why is it so dark inside? and why is the table for 2 are so tiny that you can't have more than 2 plates on them at the same time plus you feel part of the conversation of the tables on your sides because it is so crowded.  But the most annoying thing is that if you want to have a dinner and movie night you can't trust this spot to work with your movie time.  They don't take reservation and they are always full.  And yet, still one of my favorite places in Los Angeles."
Kenneth R.,"Los Angeles, CA",188,24,13,5.0,1/6/2017,"Haven't been to this location in ages, forgot how great the service was! Jadi was very attentive and made sure we were in the loop, she checked on us multiple times before we were even ready to order. My brother had dropped $40 out of his pocket onto the floor one of the hostess (cheyenne) was honest enough to pick it up and ask if it was my brothers money. Kudos to her and the company for employing such honest staff. Keep up the good work guys."
Laura P.,"Granada Hills, Granada Hills, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/3/2017,Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite restaurants. Service was great and the food was delicious! What more can I say.........
Ken Y.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/13/2017,"Terry was a great attentive manager. The check-in desk needs schooling in logistics and what it takes to clean and bus an area before attempting to seat guests. Terry to the rescue, she apologized for the issue and was A++ in customer service."
Mike E.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,19,24,1.0,2/19/2016,UPDATED REVIEW I had not 1 but multiple hairs on my chicken Madeira.  See photo.  Worst dining experience of my life!  The manager did not communicate.  She took off with the plate and just left us here.  What a strange date night.  So gross!  The hair felt thick like body hair.  It was in my teeth! Great selection of food.  I ordered pumpkin cheesecake and really liked it but would go back to my fav vanilla bean cheesecake next time.  The grove is beautiful for Christmas.
Ness S.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,156,386,3.0,9/7/2014,"I enjoy this location plenty to do after you eat you can walk that food right off by store hopping. The restaurant is very nice lots of murals, you can eat in or outdoors and it's all on the second floor.  Straight to the point the food was delicious, customer service was pretty good, they messed up on someone's order so we got there free salad with grilled chicken ;-), my negatives are I hate how you wait they take your number when your table is suppose to be ready than you get upstairs and wait some more, this location stays busy so the booths are half ass cleaned, and they're wrong orders or delays in receiving your drinks or condiments. Which is why I gave them 3 stars."
Roddy M.,"Monterey, CA",20,50,23,5.0,11/23/2015,"Med-Rare, Smokehouse BBQ Burger w/Ceasar Salad. Burger: Thin crispy onion rings. Applewood Smoked Bacon, 100% real Cheese, Smoked, tender beef. I remember their ""Ranch House Burger"". This one is just as tasty. I haven't found a better burger ""anywhere"", in 7 years! Caesar: Nice creamy dressing w/just enough tang & garlic, fresh grated Parmesan & super fresh Romaine.  When a dude, switches out ""French Fries""? You know the Caesar, is boss.  $21.00 and WORTH IT!"
Danté T.,"Garden Grove, CA",183,26,4,5.0,9/27/2016,"Came in for drinks and an appetizer during happy hour. Jadi was super personable, cool, and an overall pleasure to be around. Thanks for the great service"
Matthew H.,"Washington, DC",774,1035,605,3.0,4/9/2015,"The portions are huge, and the service is fantastic. So why the three start you ask? Well for starters, the place is filthy. From the uncleaned tables to the dirty silverware, I am disappointed in how this place operates. As for the food, it's mediocre at best. I'll be back because it's convenient for me, however. Improvements should be made."
Erin R.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",53,81,44,5.0,11/25/2016,Wow. Restaurant and bar amazing. Service was outstanding. Food is fair I have to say but ambiance more than makes up for it. 1.5 hr wait was only 45 min.
