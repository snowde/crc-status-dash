Steven C.,"Tustin, CA",17,89,11,5.0,11/21/2016,We ordered many types of food and all of them tasted amazing!! Our waiter was excellent because he would see that a cup is almost empty and wouldn't think twice about getting them a refill!! We will for sure come back here again!!
Jun R.,"Valencia, CA",110,160,493,3.0,5/8/2015,"I have to give this place 3.5 cause of their slow service. Came here for lunch at 2pm. The wait was 45 min so we just sat at the bar. We waited 5 mins to have the table cleaned and set-up. Another 5 mins for the waiter to show up. By the time, he asked for our drink order, we were ready to order our meal. We asked for the brown bread which we loved! And we got the salmon firecracker, Jamaican shrimp and jambalaya. Foods great but they served our appetizer with the meal so all the taste we're mixed together. We come to Cheesecake Factory all the time and by far this franchise at the Groove has the worst service."
Jeanette H.,"Paramount, CA",328,326,260,4.0,10/26/2016,Received excellent service even though they were busy. My family and I felt well taken care of. The food as usual hits the spot and cannot rave enough of the Avocado Eggrolls lol. I go to Cheesecake just for those rolls lol.
Banjo S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",410,34,2,1.0,9/21/2016,"I used to love this restaurant for the variety of the menu and the decent quality of  the food, my last experience was horrible, me and my wife after a movie decided to pick up some food at Cheesecake Factory, I choose porky chops and my wife spicy chicken cashew, first of all for pick up food 20$ each i can go to a fine dining restaurant and pay the same price for a better quality, second the food was just horrible the pork was dry and tasteless and the chicken was plain, I can get the same plate at a Thai restaurant for half of the price and with better quality. Next time and I will walk to the Farmer's market and get a better meal."
Brendan O.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,10,,2.0,9/21/2016,This is for sure the worst Cheesecake Factory location. They overlooked my shrimp and we waited over an hour for the table. Below average experience all around.
Bigjohn S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,11,,5.0,12/6/2016,"God bless you guys through Christ Jesus! I had the ribeye medium, it was cooked to perfection.  It was the best rib eye, so tender and juicy.  Made Flemings look silly in taste. Mashed potatoes were creamy, And the carrots in pecans or whatever get some!!!!!!! Raspberry chocolate truffle cheesecake to go, And all of my stomachs were happy. I usually go to Beverly Hills one, best kept secret until now."
Christine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,5,6,1.0,1/31/2016,"So disappointed,,, I ordered Bang Bang chicken & shrimp,,, but I got something different or somebody's leftovers? If you ordered togo, plz check before you leave to make sure... :/"
C. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,2,1.0,11/20/2016,"This place... I went there with my friend for lunch and first off the receptionist was so rude and cold.  After we ordered the waiter came back with the bread and it was freaking cold and stale.  Then I found a used butter wrapper. WTF they obviously recycle their bread basket.  Now he only impression I get is they probably recycle their foods too! Disgusting. So I calmly told my waiter so others wouldn't hear but guess what he says ""uh ok"" and takes it and brings back the same effin basket without the wrapper.  He was so damn rude.  No apologizes what so ever and gives attitude. I wish I could give this place a damn 0 star.  I even wrote to corporate but nope they didn't feel like my opinion was important.  Overall, people watch what you eat here."
Esmeraldita G.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,23,5,5.0,11/7/2016,"Love love this place , been here a couple of times , my mom really wanted to come so guess what we came !!! And indeed ! Best food ever !!! Definitely coming back!! And try more food!!!"
Jacyline G.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/18/2017,"My first time at this location and the service was not bad, but our utensils were dirty and then we found some kind of cream in my sons water after he finished drinking his drink. The manager was not compassionate about the situation and blamed us for not complaining sooner. This was my worst experience ever and the Manger need to be better trained to address these types of situations."
Nathan L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,1,1,1.0,1/24/2016,I didn't like this place. Gave me americano burger when I ordered macaroni burger. Bronze trash.
The Grubbin' M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",205,32,10,5.0,8/10/2016,"Sorry for not writing this review sooner. It has been two weeks since my visit to this location for the first time. I didn't like the hostesses downstairs. I patiently waited in line to put my name down on the list. People behind me in line stepped to the left and right of me, to be taken by the next hostess and have their name put down. At least 3 groups cut in front of me. Until I finally interrupted all the stimulation that seemed to be distracting the hostesses (the natural atmosphere of Cheesecake Factory) and said ""HEY! Aren't I next in line?"" She said, ""...yes."" And could not understand my firm statement. I said, if you see someone next in line, call them over. Don't just take the next person who walks up. Obvious a line had formed. Be fair to those waiting. I can be pushy too and cut the line, but don't think you hostesses would want people crowded around the counter in a disorganized fashion.  One hostess (young black girl with braids) was one I had contact with. She was unaware of what was happening. She apologized and put my name down, and apologized one other time later. I appreciate this, but please, take more notice of those who are patiently waiting to receive a pager. Just because I came in alone, does not mean I am not important, because that's how I felt... On a side note, I found a place at the bar, and my server was Kennedy. Gosh is she awesome. She was attentive and sincere in the way she engaged with you in conversation. She patiently answered ALLLL my menu questions and was knowledgeable about everything. I would go back to Cheesecake just because of her. Servers should emulate the style that Kennedy puts out there. She is kind, caters to your needs and is helpful. She offered to box my food for me, which many Cheesecake servers don't do. She checked on me enough. I didn't have to grab her attention much, if at all.  Thank you Kennedy, for making my solo dinner just days before my bday, a memorable one. Honestly.  I hope you get some recognition at work for your exemplary work ethic.  Keep doing you! Lastly, I can't forget Cindy. I hope I spelt her name right (or maybe it's Cindi)?  You were an absolute gem. U offered me a pleasant memory with your friendly and genuine chat. Thank you for your confirmation on my cheesecake selection.  You were very generous with your final gesture. My birthday celebration for the week, began that night and both you and Kennedy made it a memorable one. Much appreciated!!!"
Sohelz S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/17/2017,Food was wow! Service was excellent! But bathroom was nasty as hell. Urine was all over floor didn't know where to stand and do my natural duties?
Christina W.,"Chino Hills, CA",175,278,5231,4.0,12/23/2014,"When in LA visiting my mom with the kids, this is ALWAYS what everyone wants. I would prefer ANYTHING else at the Grove but the kids always come first :P Anytime of the day, there will be a wait so I always put in my name and go shopping for ONE hour. They have done away with the pagers now and will text when the table is ready but you must return 5 minutes of the text !!! My daughter always get a few appetizers for herself: chicken strips, fried cheese, Southern fried chicken sliders, Buffalo Blasts, and a side of mac and cheese. My youngest son likes the house made corn dog lollipops and french fries and  the older son likes a cheeseburger and french fries or a side of mashed potatoes and both have to have a apple juice. My mom loves her coffee and Shrimp Scampi or Steak and Shrimp Diane. Its hard for the kids to wait so the squaw and french breads are very helpful to keep them occupied before their food is ready. I stay away from EVERYTHING and order either a filet and vegetables or the pork chop with spinach, dump the mash potatoes and along with a Passion Ice tea, it's a decent meal for me :P My daughter always have to finish off eating here with her favorite dessert, Oreo Cheesecake. My mom doesn't like my sons and they sense it so while we were having dinner, my two sons tag teamed her while the older one kicked her from under the table and the younger one took a little spoon and threw whip cream directly in her eye. When I realized what was happening, I was like OMG!!!  The restaurant is very loud and busy so it's a great place for young children to eat :P"
Jieun J.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",143,62,63,2.0,1/13/2016,"IMO this place is so overrated and expensive.  I came here a couple of times but the only thing that actually made me happy was the avocado egg rolls.  Last night, I craved this place for some reason so we went.   Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta- gross.  I personally don't like ""asian styled"" pasta so the asiany flavor with the spice didn't hit it for me.  The sauce is just too sweet and non-appetizing for me.  I should've gotten the Da Vinci.   Fried Shrimp Platter- you can get this at Santa Monica or whatever beach for a cheaper price.  This was like $20 for a couple of shrimps with fries.   Salmon Plate w/ mashed potato- This was alright, nothing special about it. Alfredo- Too creamy, thick, and overwhelming.   Stuffed Mushrooms-  They give like 4 mushrooms for $6 lol.... LOL AHAH  HAHA HAHA HAAHAHAHAH when the bill came out my card and I probably cried a few tears.  RIP."
Ivette M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,2.0,9/5/2016,"Two stars because I love their food and obviously the cheese cake. BUT, service from hostess is the worst! Even Jack in the box have better service than this place."
Reese D.,"Long Beach, CA",45,77,27,1.0,2/19/2017,"I have to amend my last review. Where as I got 5 star service on my last visit (food on last visit sucked! DON'T ORDER THE STAKE! I could get a steak just as bad at Denny's), I am not happy with my service I received today. We sat on the patio which is nice because it's not as loud as inside the restaurant which is always insanely loud. We waited for over an hour to be seated and it was NOT worth the wait. The server when taking our order didn't even let us finish ordering before he proceeded to walk off waving at us in dismissal. No exaggeration. He actually waved us off and began to walk away WHILE we where trying to order! Flipping Rude! I asked for bread and it wasn't even brought to the table until our meal was finished. I was taking my last bite when it arrived. I think we wouldn't have even received it had our servers not been switched. I found his treatment to be extremely rude and inattentive. I ordered a soda but it was empty throughout my meal. The shrimp was bland and tasted old. It was mushy and Luke warm. To make matters worse, when we got home I looked at my Godiva brownie I ordered to go, there was no fudge, no whipped cream, no chocolate candy garnish. Just 3 dry brownie wedges. This is what upsets me the most. Why the hell did I pay almost $100.00 to be disrespected, ignored and treated like an inconvenience and then get a F.U.B.A.R. Dessert? I'm going to Marina Delray from now on. The food has always been good at that location and I've never been treated poorly there. I'm going to have to say goodbye to the Grove location from now on. You really should see this crusty brownie. I'm kicking myself for not looking before leaving the restaurant. So upset! You don't mess with a woman and her chocolate! That was the last slap in the face. Not coming back. Side evaluation, your floor is so greasy and slippery! Just gross!"
Markeithe W.,"Los Angeles, CA",68,2,,3.0,2/1/2016,"Complete Trash  Service is Very inconsistent  Staff believe in Self pride and fashion rather than complimentary Reality waiter service, Cheesecake Factory near the LA Beach Area's  are much better! The experience at the Grove was just petty, Free food for horrible service. But when you go out to enjoy A Nice meal with immediate family, you'd expect Superb Dinning. And A Priceless Affair! Not half stepping waiters and free handouts. Awful Inconsistent Service the least favorite Cheesecake Factory of them all in Los Angeles Area. The only plus is Farmer's market and Grove convenience."
Jeff L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",40,235,,2.0,7/27/2016,"Decided to take the kids to the Grove and hang out and have lunch. Well, went to get seated at the restaurant and got in right away as it was about noon. The only problem is it took over 18 minutes to even get acknowledged. Eleven minutes in I went to the hostess and said we have been here for over eleven minutes and completely ignored. She said she would send someone right over, yep, 7 minutes later. This was still after she said she would get us our drinks and never did. Ruined the whole lunch. Not going to this location again. I would have left but kids told me to relax. Two stars are for the salads we had. Many locations in the Grove, they won't miss me but we're not coming back."
cheri F.,"San Diego, CA",87,44,4,5.0,1/27/2016,"Beautiful Décor, Lengthy Menu, Great Food & Amazing Dessert. But what truly set it off as a 5-star PERFECT Review for our 'party of 9' table of ravenous girls..... was our fantastic server ""Big Mike."" He did all that he could do to make it a memorable night for us girls! From finding us a table for 9 (without the hour wait), to keeping us off his back by quickly responding with our drink order, to making sure there was bread & butter (and plenty of it), Mike did it all. Thank you Mike from your newest admirers! (I hope the management knows what a winner they have in you!!)  PS - the Chicken Madeira is 'da Bomb!! Be sure to order it!!"
