Jaimi G.,"Los Angeles, CA",255,195,336,5.0,3/22/2016,"I got the Mac n Cheese burger. It was okaaayyyy, but I've had the spicy chicken chipotle pasta and that's so freaking good. Of course the cheesecake is good, but make sure you order at the front instead of at the table because you get a bigger slice for the same price ;)"
Linette P.,"Los Angeles, CA",387,603,2111,3.0,1/2/2015,"I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory and it's has always been my default place for birthdays, anniversaries etc.  Came here on Christmas Eve and it was a mess. Longest wait ever in the cold, yes we had reservations. It seemed very unorganized with random names being called out. Many people were crowded by the door, had to trample through to get to the host. Next time I think they should keep the doors and hall clear.  Our food took a while to get to the table but I thank them for keeping the bread baskets coming. Unfortunately, having no self control doesn't help you here. I filled off the bread basket too soon and couldn't enjoy my meal, lol don't be like me.  The food arrived kind of cold, but it took so long for it to arrive and we were so hungry that we just ate. One member of our party asked the server about his dish but she didn't seen to take an interest and didn't offer to replace the cold dish. I understand it was hectic but standards are standards. Other than that thanks for being open on Christmas Eve!"
Ian M.,"San Pedro, CA",14,11,9,5.0,11/6/2015,"THE GARLIC SHRIMP NOODLES IS DELICIOUS!!! The Take Out portion is very generous. Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a Delicious Garlic Sauce. Available with Chicken or Shrimp."
Sarah N.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,10,25,1.0,1/27/2016,"Went in for an evening meal around 6pm, no reservation, got seated quickly... But then waited 25 mins for no one to acknowledge us, not even to take a drink order! Not a great first experience!"
Joy A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1554,288,678,3.0,12/15/2015,"I am going to assume that if you are reading this review, it's because you are walking around the Grove and you are wondering where you can have a sit down lunch or dinner and get some drinks and you are not entirely sure about the other restaurants so you are thinking a chain is a safe bet. And that is what it is. This is a safe bet. Same family restaurant with a huge menu and their trademark cheesecake. Except this location is loud... and it's dark... and did I mention it is loud, like a music videos? Lots of 20-somethings on dates before a movie, or hip families where the noise drowns out their kids. I only come here to get loud and eat lots of bar food type appetizers."
Hannah K.,"Los Angeles, CA",799,22,1,4.0,4/28/2016,"So yeah, I'm not a big fan of cheese. BUT. The cheesecakes here are so delish. So my focus for this review is gonna be solely on this cheesecake I tried the other day. I had the white truffle raspberry cheesecake and it was so smooth and creamy!! Typically, I don't like rich creamy and super sweet things, but I killed this slice easily. Everyone was surprised. It was a really nice balance between fruity and rich, I think, which was why I liked it. I asked for no whipped cream because I felt like that would've been an overkill. The crust was perfect, not too soft or hard but the perfect texture.  Basically: Try the desserts. They're fire."
Elizabeth P.,"Encino, CA",168,147,253,5.0,1/9/2015,"You can never go wrong with cheesecake factory they have the best variety of foods and everything is delicious. The cheesecake speaks for itself it is absolutely the best you can find in town. Usually this location doesn't have a long wait and there are plenty of bar tables available if you don't want to wait which is convenient. I have also ordered to go from this location and the only downside is that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to get your order, but other than that the service is great and they include utensils and napkins etc.  Must try: Chicken madera  Steak Diane  Miso salmon Avocado egg rolls Chinese chicken salad"
Crystal D.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,7,,4.0,5/22/2017,"The reason this isn't getting a higher rating was because the clientele in the restaurant really wasn't a respectful crowd. Went in to grab a few drinks and some dinner and left laughing and full. Our server James (the guy with the beard and blue eyes) was definitely the highlight of the night. His attitude was spot on and his knowledge of the menu was impressive. His sense of humor was refreshing, we even offered him a space at our table!"
Mark H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",282,68,69,5.0,2/16/2016,Food was great need  should taken more pictures but look at the milk shake wow try it
Pete Y.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,3.0,1/16/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is our favorite place.  But today in this location we were a little disappointed,  the customer service wasn't that good it's like they didn't really care about us. The 1st employee went to break 2nd one continued ( WHICH WAS OK WITH US). When we asked to take the food with us he brought the bags to our table and started to put the food inside the bag with his hands and the rest left so we continue and left helping others,  It's like we were helping ourselfs. Anyways the food is super."
Ryan C.,"San Francisco, CA",385,70,62,5.0,11/17/2015,"First time I've been to this location, and it was an amazing experience. First of all, there was a ridiculously long wait (more than a 2 hour wait) for a table, so I decided to just ask them if me and my friend can order takeout instead. Even thought they were jam packed, they were kind enough to let us in and order upstairs. When we got there, the display of cheesecakes was unimaginable. It was like walking into a bakery filled with your favorite cakes (mine being cheesecake). We were going to order, but we decided to try to ask if there were any bar seatings open. To our surprise, they told us that it was open seating and we were free to grab any open seat. We were shocked when we walked over and found two open seats!!! It was too great, bypassing maybe about 30 parties and getting to sit down at the bar and order. The ambiance is absolutely terrific. Though slightly dark, it highlights the collection of liquor at the bar, along with the Christmas lighting outside on the main street (if you come during the holiday season). If you want to save room for dessert, I would recommend just ordering appetizers, which in my opinion, are better than their main courses. I got the loaded baked tater tots and buffalo chicken wings. The chicken wings were average, wasn't bad, but didn't stand out. However, their loaded baked tater tots were out of this world. Perfectly fried tater tots with cheese, bacon, and green onions, with sour cream to dip on the side. Oh man it couldn't have been anymore perfect. Once you bite past the perfectly fried outer layer, the inside just melts in your mouth and you taste a creamy combination of cheese, potato, bacon, and green onions. And this appetizer is only $6 for about 10 of them. Definitely worth getting it.  As for the desert, I tried the tuxedo cheesecake, recommended to me by my friend. And boy it did not disappoint. If you love chocolate, or anything sweet, get ready to taste chocolate on top of cheesecake on top of chocolate on top of more chocolate. Comprised of their fudge cake, chocolate cheesecake, mousse, and more chocolate, this cheesecake makes you feel like your mouth is swimming in chocolate (along with the two giant creamy, delicious mounds of whipped cream they top it with).  This experience here couldn't have been any better. To those with a party of 2 or 3, try the bar if the restaurant is too crowded. If not, it's still definitely worth the experience, especially if you can get a seat outside on their beautiful balcony overlooking the Grove's heavily decorated and beautiful main street."
glen f.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,83,11,2.0,8/26/2016,"Not sure why I would give this corporate behemoth a chance, but I did and they proved to be disgusting. Crappy uninspired food churned out like a factory would. Never again. At least the cheesecake was decent."
Aram G.,"Albuquerque, NM",13,7,,1.0,12/8/2015,"Very slow service. Below average food. Will never go back.  The waiter took a long time to show up then went away for a long time before coming back to take our order and left without telling us who our waiter is. I realize that I probably won't have to deal with the same person again but considering  the food quality, price and the wait I will never go back."
Jessie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,42,91,4.0,3/23/2016,"Over all a decent place, always crowded even on a mid-week day. Staff is friendly, food well with the exception of two times were the food was cold and the cheesecake slice I received was so thin , it look like a reject. Cocktail drinks are tasty priced accordingly. Sometimes the place gets really loud. But I'm still a fan of the cheesecakes."
Kelley L.,"Long Beach, CA",24,430,463,4.0,11/12/2013,"It has become an annual tradition of a Stanford friend and mine to eat here every time we are at The Grove for the holidays. It seems silly to eat at a chain restaurant when there literally thousands of other places we could be eating at in L.A., but I love the view of the balcony as well as the service here - so much better than any other Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. My favorite things to order: - cheesecake (obviously) - Hibachi steak (sooooo good!!!!!!!!) - omelette (when I make my own) - cocktails (happy hour!) I have no complaints when I come here, except for the ridiculous waits at times. Other than that, if you are here on a crowded day, just reserve your table ahead of time and shop around the area so your buzzer works. (I believe the buzzer works as far away as two blocks, when I was in San Francisco)."
Fursty S.,"Glendale, CA",74,3,1,2.0,8/13/2016,"Expect to wait 45 minutes and for your order to be messed up. It's happened to us on multiple occasions... They'd take forever to bring out the order and then the order would be messed up. I once ordered fish tacos, and one of the tacos didn't have any fish in it LOL. This Cheesecake Factory is a joke, you're better off going to the Americana one. Save yourself the time and frustration."
Shari H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,15,1,1.0,8/12/2016,"My daughter was celebrating her 12th birthday on Tuesday, August 9, 2016 with shopping and chose Cheesecake Factory at The Grove for lunch.  We were sat immediately and noticed all the flatware had dried food. We asked waitress for new place settings.  She returned and again flatware was filthy.  On the 3rd attempt, all looked good until she started placing the knives down, my daughter noticed they had food.  Exasperated the waitress replied she would just be bringing us plastic because we were picky!  I replied that while dining at a National Chain, sit down restaurant that we were not being picky and most definitely expected clean flatware.  Due to her rude handling of the situation, we elected not to dine here.   I also spoke to the manager and expressed my disappointment at the handling of this situation."
M S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,28,4,5.0,11/2/2016,"Anthony and Luis at the To-go counter are awesome!!! Always friendly and exhibit impeccable customer service. I come to this location often, and usually pick up food to go. If my food is late, or im waiting a bit longer than usual, Anthony will even offer a courtesy beverage for my delay. This cheesecake factory is the reason i stopped going to the one in Beverly Hills. People fail to realize how far friendly service goes. Even if the food is not always impressive, the service always is."
Timothy P.,"Las Vegas, NV",100,7,,1.0,8/10/2016,"Food was good, however we were planning to order dessert. (Cheesecake anyone?) our server never asked if we wanted dessert, just brought the check which sent a clear message- Get Out! We mentioned this to the host on the way out who said we could've told our server we wanted dessert. Gee, never thought of that! The point was we didn't feel our business was welcomed. I make frequent trips to the Los Angeles area and this is one place I won't visit again."
Chris H.,"Los Angeles, CA",733,560,1841,3.0,10/9/2014,"Pretty good location since it is at the Grove.  We got there around 7:30 PM on a Friday night and man, the line was long.  We had to wait for about an hour just to get seated.  It's cool.  I guess.  Start time for the movie we wanted to watch was at 10PM anyway.   We spent the next hour sitting by the fountain area, people watching and listening to the awesome Jazz singer they had performing that night.   Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon (3 stars) -  I wanted to love it because I love fish in general but it came out so-so.  Nothing to rave about. Service (3 stars) - they were busy.  Our servers introduced themselves, delivered the food, came back for the tab. Ambiance (3 stars) - Very dimly lit.  They were probably going for the romantic vibe.  But with too many people dining it had a bar-like feel to it.  Which they also have towards the north side of the restaurant. One thing I like was how you have to walk up to the 2nd floor to get to their main dining area.  Reminded me a bit of Jin Fong Dim Sum place in NY."
