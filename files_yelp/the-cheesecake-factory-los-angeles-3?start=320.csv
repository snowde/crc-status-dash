Julie B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",76,6,,1.0,7/28/2016,"I was so disappointed!!! I thought for sure this place would be awesome since it's at ""The Grove"" but was I sadly mistaken. I have never been to a more disorganized restaurant in my life!  It started with the rude hostess and overly crowded waiting area downstairs, then as they herded us upstairs to the second overly crowded waiting area. The waiters/waitress all looked liked they wanted to be anywhere but there doing their job! Our food came out and mine was wrong. My daughter ordered the pizza  oh let me rephrase that...A cracker with sauce and a sprinkle of cheese on top. I will never go there, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone!!! Sorry Cheesecake factory. and yes...I did let the manager know!"
Julie B.,"Cerritos, CA",402,384,1873,2.0,2/26/2015,"I normally have good experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, but sadly our visit to TCF last Friday left a lot to be desired. We arrived right at 6pm with a party of 4 and were told the wait would be 15 mins. After 25 mins had passed we started getting a little antsy. Waited until the 30 min mark and went up to the hostess to find out how much longer we'd have to wait. When I handed them my number, the hostess looked on her computer, made an obvious ""oops"" face and said we should go upstairs to be seated. It was completely obvious that they had forgotten to text us although our table had been ready for a while. When I pressed them asking why we hadn't received a text, they rudely said ""we tried texting you but no one came up"".  Such a blatant lie as there were zero texts received. And how shady is it to try and blame the customer? I would have pushed it further, but we were with out of town guests and I didn't want to make them uncomfortable. Their unwillingness to admit the mistake and own up to it left me more than a little irritated. The meal itself was ok. Our main waitress was very nice and came by frequently to check on us. One of the random servers who delivered part of our meal was rude and barked ""who had the pasta"" when she had to repeat herself (uh, our guests didn't speak English, lady. Sheesh). Overall, our party enjoyed the food/wine/cheesecake. The low 2 star rating is solely for the irresponsible and rude service we received. I will avoid coming to this particular TCF location in the future."
Shunnae J.,"Sacramento, CA",3,29,14,3.0,7/19/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory. You usually can never go wrong eating here.  I love The Grove location but this visit wasn't so good. Quality of the food wasn't great. My daughter ordered a bacon cheeseburger and the bacon was so burnt and greasy. I can't believe they actually put it on her burger. It looked like burnt beef jerky.  It was literally black and greasy. I brought it to the attention of one of the waitresses and she had some NEW bacon cooked and brought out to us.
Destiny A.,"South Gate, CA",0,9,3,1.0,1/10/2017,"Went out a couple nights ago with my boyfriend to the grove and we originally were going to go to a different restaurant but decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory since our first visit was so good. We got there and the wait was thirty minutes but it felt like we were seated a bit sooner (which was nice) they say us outside near the edge squashed up next to a bigger party. They do have heaters but where they sat us the heaters did not reach...mind you this was at night so it was freezing! Most places would let you know ahead of time or ask if it's fine that you'd be outside. Nope! They assumed since we were young that we weren't going to spend much so we essentially didn't matter(we felt pretty judged) but they sat us inside and our server finally came. He spoke very low so it was hard to hear and we continuously asked him to repeat what he said. We knew what we wanted when he asked for our drinks so our orders were placed quickly. A couple next to us we're seated at the same time. This was an older and more rich looking couple...not only did they get their drinks, bread and butter before us but they also got their meal before us even though it was put in after us. We asked a few times what was taking so long and he just stared confused. Once the couple finished their food, paid, and another couple came, got their orders taken and served!!! We were served. I was so mad and so hungry. Ps my boyfriend got a burger and fries while I was served cold mashed potatoes and chicken. WORST SERVICE EVER! Never again!!!"
Corazon T.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,74,31,4.0,3/16/2017,"I came here once and they said it would be a 2 hour wait. I called to make a reservation and they said they don't do them. So I came here again was told an hour wait . We waited. And after 2 hours I went back to the desk and ask and she said almost and so we went back to the fountain and we got buzzed and lit by the time thing they gave us when they had a table for us. The food was delicious. My husband and his cousin were so obnoxious and rude I was so embarrassed I had to tell them to behave but the waiter still served us kindly. We had to tip  the waiter was so patient and I'm sure could tell I was embarrassed. Needless to say we don't go out with his family anymore. But as for the Cheesecake Factory, we will be back. & my husband will be on his best behavior as he normally is.  The food and service here is great. If your patient enough to get a table the servers have patience for you. Delicious food. And beautiful restaraunt. Nice ambience . Was very busy so a bit loud. Still great"
Jessica H.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",83,7,10,3.0,7/15/2017,"This rating is solely based on ""To Go"" orders. I work at the Grove so I order fairly regularly from this location.  I love this restaurant chain and they have delicious food, but this particular location seems to have issues when you place an order to go. More times than not, my to go order is missing something that wouldn't be missing from a dine in customer. My particular issue is when I order the Factory Nachos. On past occasions, I've added chicken and not received it or it's been something simple like they forgot the guacamole and sour cream; which is a special order for the nachos! They come standard! I haven't order the nachos in a while because of my poor luck with that particular item,  but I gave it another shot tonight. And, not surprising, they forgot the sour cream and guacamole.  I have always been taken care of when I have brought my complaint about missing items from my orders, but the frequency in which I have to do this is too often.  My advice would be to check your orders BEFORE leaving the restaurant."
Bernie L.,"Redlands, CA",1411,94,193,2.0,6/9/2016,"service is not award winning at all. food not the best version of cheesecake factory. i could have just been the string of employees we encountered. i had the biscuits and gravy meal. biscuits were burned. never happened in 15 years of going to different ones. if gordon ramsey came here he might pop his lid, just sayin..."
Najah C.,"Long Beach, CA",132,50,94,4.0,3/4/2016,"Besides this location always being busy service for me has always been great, and the food comes out good and hot except that it was hard to get warm bread today."
Mark G.,"West Hollywood, CA",352,13,,1.0,5/8/2016,"I am a mother and father of my son and this was possible the worst Mother's Day dinner I could have had. I love the food here but after being here for over two hours I left with no food because they couldn't get it right and the person taking the order couldn't understand English . I finally said forget it ,but while waiting for food they sure kept us plenty with drinks and had the nerve to charge us $90 in the end ,after they couldn't get out food right because they kept getting us to order drinks. Guess what my Mother's Day dinner still never happened ,and I still haven't eaten..... Possibly the worst experience EVER !!!"
Brandon H.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,3,2.0,5/20/2016,"Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years and probably won't be back for another few.  Friday around noon, restaurant not very busy. Sat at the bar, service was fine. Ordered a burger MEDIUM WELL and fries. Fries were over cooked, burger was under cooked. As soon as I cut into it it created a greasy bloody puddle and made the bun soggy. I had to cut the 2 halves in half so I could eat around the edges that weren't red. I would've been fine with a slight pink center but this was medium at best. Basically I got half of a burger, a few fries and a soda for $23. If the burger was cooked as well as the fries and the fries were cooked as much as the burger it would've been perfect.  Stick with the cheesecake. I should have."
Cristal M.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,4.0,3/31/2017,"Food is pretty good and like the outdoor balcony area they have. Only downside, the wait can be long."
Josie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",143,162,384,4.0,5/12/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Grove is pretty easy to find. Parking can be validated after you eat at the front desk downstairs. An escalator and stairs are the only access to get up to the second floor where the restaurant is located. Very intimate, dark inside but I enjoyed it. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. We ordered two items from their lunch menu which were the pizza and salad combo, and the pasta. They were considered ""smaller/lunch"" portions but I honestly felt they were pretty big already. The pizza was great! Salad was good, we ordered the Cesar salad with cheese and dressing on the side. I also ordered a fettuccine Alfredo in which you can add chicken to, but I passed and tried it by itself. It was sooo filling but it was good, thick, creamy! For dessert I had their ""original"" cheesecake which was also great!! Can't wait to come back for more but I'll have to try something else rather than the pastas."
Maria G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,107,,1.0,1/2/2017,"Came here on a Sunday. Took an hour to get in. Got seated by the theatre area, not so romantic or decent. Server got switched out, since one went for lunch at 8pm in the evening??? Order took an hour and a half since 1st and 2nd server got switched out, and did not communicate order properly. Server Jason M, seems to favor tables, and take his sweet time doing his job, making sure customers get their order, food and drinks. Always loved coming to the cheesecake, but today the food tasted old and disgusting."
Chris S.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/5/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but not this one. Maybe it was just my shitty server (James M.), I was seated quickly, but it took forever for Dumbass James to even acknowledge i was there.  When James finally came over, i knew i had better order my food too, cause god only knows when he would return. He tried to impress me by not writing anything down. Not surprisingly when my order came out it was wrong. Took forever for my meal to be corrected. The manager came out (without me asking) to apologize and comped a drink (should have comped my dinner too). James of course tried to pass the blame to the cooks and insisted on calling me ""dude"" and ""man"". I get more respect at McDonalds. Better service, too. I big let down! I would recommend trying one of the other many nice restaurants in the area. (This was on a slow Tuesday night)"
Maria O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,42,1.0,1/1/2017,Tried having a nice dinner with my boyfriend here on Friday..... The host said it would be at least 1 HOUR and 30 MINUTES!!! That's insane we hopped on over to Maggiano's were there was no wait at all :)
Linda K.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,494,102,2.0,11/12/2015,"The hostess working in the from was rude. The server seemed to have the kind of attitude that he didn't want to work there. The food was meh. The carbonara was wayy too heavy, the spicy jambalaya pasta wasn't spicy, the hibachi steak wast really hibachi, it was just regular grilled steak that was sliced ( not sliced and cooked) but it tasted pretty good. The sides that came with the steak wasn't good. The cheese cake was delicious. Next time I'll skip the food and get me 3 cheese cakes for dinner!"
Jina P.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,12,12,1.0,8/28/2015,"Worst service ever. Had three kids with me and waitress was missing most of the time.  My daughter was sitting on my lap, and the waitress puts my food across the table! I asked her to put it in front of me, and she says, ""I'll just leave it here and just walks away."" Ok, been coming to Cheesecake Factory all my life, but the management needs to do something about how they train their employees here."
Anissa F.,"Florence, MS",1,59,,5.0,9/30/2016,Visited this location twice while in LA. I loved the fried mac and cheese balls and the Bistro Shrimp pasta! Both items were served fresh and hot and were absolutely delicious.
