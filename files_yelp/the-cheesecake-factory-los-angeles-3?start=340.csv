Vatche K.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,64,116,3.0,8/11/2015,"I have been coming to Cheesecake Factory since I was a little kid. I definitely liked the restaurant and I still do. However I feel like the quality of the cheesecake factories have gone down. There are still certain entrees I remember just as I was a kid. However, a few I can definitely taste the lack of quality. For the period of wait I had to wait on a week day, which was over 45 mins, is definitely not worth it."
J Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/16/2017,"Worst experience ever. Very disappointed with the way our table was situation was handle. We check in to be seated out in the patio, we were told that the wait time would be 40 minutes. We agree and waited to be called. Once we where called in to be seated the hostess gave our table to another party so we where ask to wait additional time. We waited 15 additional minutes and where told that our table was ready. As we went in to be seated they tried to seat us inside, we said ""no, we want a table in the patio"". We where told we would have to wait some time for a table in he patio. We waited another 20 minutes and was told. It was a system error and that we had not register for patio seating. I said, that's not true we waited 40 minutes for a patio table and you gave out our table to another party. Finally 1hr and 20 minutes later we got our table and just a simple sorry. To top it off when leaving I asked for validation in the front counter and the gentleman in the counter took my ticket and didn't validated, so to my surprise when driving out I had to pay full parking fee. Thanks a lot cheese cake factory for giving me and my family a not so wonderful 17 wedding anniversary dinner. Never again are we going back."
Anasheh Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,18,45,4.0,9/13/2016,"I enjoy dining here it doesn't matter it's Tuesday or Saturday they are always busy you have to wait more than 30 minutes some times. The food was always good also the mode. Tonight I ordered pasta Alfredo, spinach dip and tortilla soup and quesadilla everything was good except the pasta I don't know why but it was very salty I think this kind of thing some times happen I have to say they don't charge the pasta by the way like always I give 4 stars to them I will come again but maybe don't order pasta :D"
Alina S.,"Downey, CA",0,21,,5.0,8/29/2016,"We love this place so much.  There's always a line but worth the wait (go check out the book store next door while you wait).  We ate here a couple of times and we always had amazing service.  Quick and friendly.  The food is AMAZING.  Some of the best plates worth the try: Cajun Chicken ""Littles', Chicken Madeira (OMG to die for), Chicken Piccata, Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms.  Ok so maybe most of the stuff I order is with chicken but trust me, it's all good.  Their pastas are very delish also.  If you're stuffed after your meal (and i think you will), order some desert to go.  We love the carrot cake and the original cheesecake."
Samantha R.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,26,1,2.0,8/8/2015,"My server was very nice and obviously this is a pretty location...but my dishes were dirty. The initial plate I was given for bread had crumbs and residue on it. I didn't have to use the plate so it wasn't an issue. However, my cheesecake was also service on a dirty plate. I touched the sides and it had hard food residue on it. Seems as if the dishwashing machine is not doing its job. I found this extremely unappetizing  and did not finish my cheesecake (it wasn't that good anyway) =("
Javier F.,"South Gate, CA",1,52,104,4.0,1/31/2016,"First time coming here with my wife. Overall good food . Started off with some wine. Next we had the egg roll sampler, then I had the Cajun pasta . Place was pretty busy so it was a pretty good wait time but the service was friendly and food was pretty good"
Gwen O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,1.0,11/5/2016,"I am not rating this a ""1"" on the food itself (it was good!), but I want to draw attention to the Reception area here at the Grove location restaurant.   I was there at 11:40 for lunch with my relatives and the 2 teen girls that were at the Reception Counter were not professional.  I'm sorry if they were not trained, but this seemed more like a lack of common sense behavior.  They were both chewing gum for most of the time we were sitting in the Waiting Area until they both decided to drink their Starbucks drinks; all this while customers were there and people coming in and out.  They would chat with each other, and at times when one would leave the area the other would have their back turned and couldn't see a customer waiting for assistance.  I did hear them say ""Thank' You"" to each customer, which in this day and age is a plus, but the other behavior was very disappointing."
Yesi P.,"Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, CA",53,24,4,5.0,4/21/2016,"Every single time i come here i am so satisfied. Being a server myself, this place goes above n beyond. Everyones super polite, the food is always hot and comes out exactly as ordered. I love my steak here!!"
George L.,"Torrance, CA",55,151,361,4.0,12/5/2015,"One of my go to places for Californian American food other than BJs. Easy, consistent food quality, nice decor and different depending on what venu you go to. I recommend trying their chocolate cake shot. Once in a while they have new dishes to try. Cocktails great too!"
Shery B.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,174,76,3.0,4/16/2016,"Extra star for a nice server; got there right when they opened up and things were just not ready to go; confusion as to what area was open and who was serving that area; we finally got an attentive server to assist; basic egg breakfast was ok- greasy potatoes, super hard bagel; avocado egg rolls also were also really greasy and dipping sauce that went with them was odd- like sweet and curry like. Coffee refills were plentiful but never actually hot. This place is much better for lunch and especially dinner, as their entrees and service then seem to be much more in point."
Alex M.,"Paris, France",163,369,1098,5.0,5/19/2013,"I've been there a while ago during my stay in Los Angeles. I was pretty young at that time and I was very amazed by the Cheesecake Factory 1/ It might sound silly for Americans, but as we don't have this system (yet?) in France, I think buzzer they give you so you know when seats are available is very efficient 2/ Our server was so nice and made us feel very comfortable 3/ I got the maha mahi fish with asparagus, it was fresh and delicious !  4/ It was so clean that I almost fall 5/ The strawberry chessecake was HEAVEN If I ever travel to the US again, I'll go back !"
Gabriela A.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,5,,5.0,8/23/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory was one of the greatest dining experiences I have ever had. It had great service and all the employees were nice. When I wanted to box up my food, they did it no problem. The Cheesecake Factory is a great restaurant, I highly recommend it. Anna, our server did an excellent job. She was funny and very kind."
Peng L.,"Quincy, MA",380,125,144,4.0,6/22/2016,"It's a good place, it's nice how they have outside seating as well do you can enjoy the day and not be in a dim lit room. The food is good, I get the chipotle pasta (what I always get regardless of which location I'm at). It's just as I remembered back home. The service here is good, but it did take a long time for the waitress/waiter to get to us. However, when they did, they are great as ever."
Tina C.,"Los Angeles, CA",251,129,174,1.0,3/24/2016,"WORST SERVICE... WORST FOOD..... WORST PARKING..... LONGEST WAIT........ GOSH..................... Literally the closest Cheesecake Factory for me so I do go here often but man.......... when I went last night I really decided I wont ever be coming back... I would rather wait and get into Wood Ranch instead.. I had a family dinner at Cheesecake Factory last night because my cousin was in town from New Jersey. There were 7 of us and when the food came out.. one of my cousins were waiting and waiting for his because everyone else's food came out but his.. We had to ask them about it and they had told us "" oops sorry it must have not went in"" and so my cousin had to wait even longer for his food to come out.... during the wait.. my cousin got a bit upset so he ordered a glass of whiskey on the rocks............ which once again never came out till we asked for it. I understand it's busy and it's dinner time but honestly it was a Wed night at 8:30PM ....................................... so compared to weekend dinner times, last night was no excuse for them to make so many mistakes. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I ordered the carbonera pasta and when I got home, I felt so sick ..... I don't know if I had food poisoning or if the food was too greasy but I felt like crap and had to sleep early to make the feeling go away."
Cathryn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,3.0,7/13/2016,"Started off with a dirty table and awful service. Servers weren't attentive and not accommodating except for one. I was supposed to give it 1 star but it gotten better at the middle of our meal. So, here's 3 stars."
Patrick G.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,90,88,4.0,8/12/2014,I love this place. It's really hard to get seated as they are always crowded so we normally sit at the bar to eat but that's fine with me.  The menu is Cheesecake Factory standard I guess so there is a lot to choose from and we've always had great bartenders.  The crowd is mixed so you might have loud kids around and as it is so crowded you will have at least three people run up to you and ask you if the seat next to you was free when one person has to see the restrooms but it's the grove so you wouldn't be here if you weren't willing to put up with masses of partially annoying people.
Nahry T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",74,74,36,1.0,5/18/2015,I normally love Cheesecake Factory. What I don't love is waiting literally an hour for our food. We came at 4:15 and got seated within 15 minutes. Cool! We sat with our menus for 20 minutes. Not cool. It took forever to get water. It took forever to get our orders taken. My salad was room temperature. How does this happen??? So inexcusable.
Angela W.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,341,162,3.0,7/3/2014,"I don't like big chain restaurants so I'm biased already against Cheesecake Factory.  I'll let you know that now.  Parking is not difficult since The Grove has sizable parking structure and Cheesecake Factory validates for 2 hours.  Not bad.   I was pretty happy to see their ""skinnylicious"" menu has gotten bigger.  If you haven't noticed, almost everything on their regular menu is over 1K calories, including salads.  The dish I ordered, Lemon garlic shrimp with angel hair pasta was under 570 calories.  Not little, but it made me feel less guilty.   Our server was very friendly and efficient."
Mikey M.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",40,114,138,5.0,8/17/2014,Great place to eat my family comes here almost ritually and now my girlfriend and I come on random dates. The Grove is another fantastic atmosphere for families and couples.
Jenni A.,"Los Angeles, CA",657,260,1134,5.0,10/29/2015,"i've had really positive experiences everytime i go to this cheesecake factory. especially today; i had ordered an oreo cheesecake about 4 days ago, and called to let them know i'd pick up early. but they had no file of my order. so alex quickly arranged everything for me. as i had ordered a 7"", he politely let me know they didnt have anymore but gave me a 10"" for the same price! such good customer service because honestly, i wouldn't have gotten the 10"" for full price.  every other time i come here, the waiters are always super nice. this location really does have the best service!!"
