Andres M.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,4,,4.0,6/16/2015,Waited 30 minutes to be seated. Had a great dinner. Server was friendly and attentive. Food was mediocre.
Jeannette G.,"Los Angeles, CA",510,808,612,4.0,6/25/2014,"4 Stars for Service 3.5 Stars for Food They open at 11:30 a.m. and I was the second party to get seated.  They were not fully prepared for the lunch hour.  Their bread was late in coming out (I was mid-meal when the bread finally came out). For lunch, I ordered the fish and chips.  The fish had not been drained enough as it was still heavily oily.  The fish was so oily, that it drenched the fries on which it was sitting.  The meal came with a side of cole slaw as well, and while it was tasting, the portion was quite deceiving.  What came to be a small scoop of cole slaw was resting on a heaping mound of lettuce."
Daniela Z.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",9,97,20,3.0,4/28/2016,"a server came up to us and said to us ""you guys can't sit here i can't handle anymore tables"" after waiting an hour for a table so we had to wait with the hostess for a different tables. THE WAIT HERE TAKES FOREVER. when i asked the male host how long more do we have to wait for a new table he says ""i dont care if you guys eat here or not it doesnt effect me"".... after finally being seated, our mood was already ruined by the other two employees. however, Jadi S turned our night around!! she is awesome. i noticed she had a lot of tables to take care of but she never gave us the feeling of being rushed. she is probably one of the best server in my experiences at cheesecake factory!! she was on top of her refill game and got all our orders out in a good timing from appetizer to dessert. she left us really happy after the negative beginning."
Marie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,16,12,5.0,9/27/2015,Perfect place for lunch! Food is very good service too. There's a long variety of meals and that's what I most like I highly recommend this place.
Alex W.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",406,629,1513,5.0,10/13/2014,"My favorite chain restaurant and one of my favorite restaurants.  I always sit at a high top or at the bar to avoid having to wait in a long line.  The menu is huge so there is something for everyone, and honestly everything is delicious.  You'll never leave here hungry and usually have leftovers on top of that.  The bread is enough to fill you up alone as it is so good.  Some of my favorite dishes include the Pasta with Meat Sauce and Chicken Bellagio."
Zoey O.,"San Diego, CA",508,391,292,5.0,7/16/2014,I came here with some friends during a really busy time. We found seating at a table in the bar since this is the only area that allows for self seating. The service was excellent and the server was sure to bring anything else we needed and filled up all soda cups when he saw them empty without us asking. I ordered the skinnylicious pear and endive salad. I love it and happen to order this every time! This location was great and I would absolutely come here again!
Leilani K.,"Hoquiam, WA",1,37,3,5.0,7/9/2016,The service here is amazing! Stasia is our server and I can't express enough how sweet and kind she is. It is slammed and she manages to come and check on us whenever she can. Good job cheesecake grove for having a great waitstaff! My food is also delicious. Sitting at the outdoor patio with this perfect summer day tops this wonderful meal and experience off!!
Aleska M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2016,"Wish I could possibly give this place no stars. I'm usually always at this location with friends! last night I had the worst customer service experience ever! Our Waiter Lamar needed to be reminded constantly about our order. The worst part however came later on when I realized I lost my wallet, not only were they giving me the complete run around but they made sure every person I spoke to about my wallet gave me a completely different story. At all cost please do not sit at Lamars table, I'm sure he found it, left him cleaning our table, and never turned anything in!  Also try avoiding the Manager Angela, said she looked at the camera, left me a message and no such thing happened! it's really hard supporting a company who doesn't care about their customers, wouldn't check the cameras for a loyal client and her friends, and had no sympathy  at all, in fact teased me about my wallet and being so careless! god bless"
Nelson M.,"Lancaster, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/1/2016,"Made us wait for more than hour telling us the system was down to get a table once we were seated, we werent served until about 15 minutes later, then they inform us that the grill has been down since noon  aswell  so we couldnt order what we initially plan to order, why couldnt they inform us the grill was down so we wouldnt have to have waited atleast 2 hours , ended up not eating anything, last time visiting this restaurant"
Diana W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1005,1504,6696,4.0,10/16/2012,"Wow once go through the whole crowd, and get seated. Superb service! Located at The Grove. 1 hour free parking + 1 hour free validated parking. The seating is upstairs with RSVP and host downstairs. Interesting? Food is the same. Nothing too great but very general for everyone to at least be able to eat something."
Brianna V.,"Chandler, AZ",0,3,1,2.0,3/4/2016,I don't normally complain about one of my favorite places to eat but the other day was the last straw. I ordered wings but they came out burnt and had barely any buffalo sauce on them. Their food is not so great anymore as it used to be. Give it two stars cause of the desert but wouldn't recommend eating at this restaurant anymore.
demanik d.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/29/2016,"We like the wide selection on the menu and big portions. But the last few times we were there the service has been excruciatingly slow - not only food service, but alcohol service too. Not sure if this was the servers' fault or poor management of staffing. Today we went there and after ten minutes at the table without any contact from a waiter, we left. Not returning ever."
Kelli A.,"Long Beach, CA",100,140,22,1.0,10/15/2016,What a way for my sister and I to celebrate our birthdays...Ok so a 35 minute wait to be seated on a Saturday is understandable..Once were seated is a whole different story. Micheal S. the waiter I only say it that way because he really wasn't at our table much at all. So we are a table of 4 order our drinks and request bread and butter. Looking around for the next 10 to 12 minutes watching the tables around us recieve drinks with bread..finally our 4 waters with lemon arrive..so a quick reminder for bread and butter please thinking he'll get it and come right back. Nope 5 minutes later we flag down a waitress running by who gets are bread in 2 minutes or less. Just watching Micheal S serve the other tables special glasses for their high end water and ice cream for another tables child..about 10 minutes he walks toward our table with a side of salad dressing that I ordered with my salad..he drops it off no salad...no bread?? 5 minutes later my burger and salad finally come than finally the order of bread?? Wow. Total time spent at Cheesecake factory 2 hours. As for the happy birthday...not!
Linda L.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",336,37,102,5.0,3/28/2014,"This is definitely my go-to restaurant. Every time I'm back home visiting family or meeting up with friends for a quick lunch, we always go to the Cheesecake Factory. Just the amount of options they have - there's always something good for everyone to choose from. My personal favorites are: the firecracker salmon roll for appetizers, the Pasta Da Vinci or Steak Diane for the main meal, and the 30th anniversary cheesecake for dessert. We came here this week and we had the Luau Salad which was so fresh and delicious, Pasta with Meat Sauce (we change the pasta to angel hair), and the Strawberry cheesecake. I'm sure everyone's been here by now, so hopefully these suggestions help!"
Claudia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,30,1,5.0,6/20/2016,Pretty nice customer service! It was packed around 6:30pm on a sunday. There was a long line for sitting inside and zero line for sitting outside. Our server JESSIE was super sweet and nice and the food and drinks were very good.
Leah M.,"Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, CA",617,767,957,3.0,8/20/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is right down the road from me so I find myself frequently coming here for occasions I deem to be ""special"" or if I feel like eating a whole heap of calories, mmm delicious calories! The restaurant is extremely impressive, two storeys high with gorgeous cathedral ceilings in the marbled lobby and the option of stairs, elevator or escalator to get from the waiting/hostess area to the restaurant level.  The Grove is a busy place, especially on a weekend so if you are looking to come here for lunch you'll need to be prepared to wait for a table, anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour depending on the time of day you turn up- they do not take reservations. I've never had a problem with the wait time although on one occasion I visited they managed to lose our reservation during the minute it took for myself and friend to ascend the stairs, it wasn't a busy evening though so it wasn't a problem. The service can vary, depending on time of day although the wait staff are generally very friendly and helpful. Because this place is so busy their attentiveness can be hit and miss which can be irritating if you're extremely hungry. If you aren't sure what to order you can always rely on your server to give you a great recommendation!  Speaking of food... HOLY MENU! It is crazy how many items are on offer. Everything is delicious but I highly recommend the following: Ahi Tuna Carpaccio (very healthy for all you gym nuts like myself) Asian Lettuce Cups (Though the lettuce is kind of hard to wrap the contents in because of the leaf shape of the type they use) Hangar Steak (Medium Rare for best outcome) I also love their Glam Burgers and Sweet Potato Fries. You definitely need to hook yourself up with a Cheesecake before you leave, the Oreo Dream and Godiva are to die for but also very, very rich. The best place to sit is either out on the balcony or (if you like the dark) inside in one of the booths."
James W.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,2,,1.0,2/15/2016,"This place has incredibly slow service.  The waiters do their utmost, but they're fighting a losing battle when they're so understaffed.  Unfortunately the food quality is also inconsistent."
Priya G.,"Glendale, CA",492,247,236,4.0,8/16/2014,"Came here for lunch with a party of 8 on Saturday around 1:45. Decided to eat here since everywhere else was packed. The wait for a table was 1.5 hours (!!!) but we luckily found two bar tables and pushed them together. We ordered from the Skinnylicious menu (low cal) and as always, it did not disappoint even for a vegetarian! We had a chicken pasta dish but subbed the chicken for mushrooms. The dish was so flavorful that I didn't even add hot sauce!! We also had the Asian lettuce wraps, which I love, and the margarita flatbread.  Service was great! Christian was our waiter! He's good at what he does."
Kimberly G.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,7,1,2.0,4/8/2015,"The food is ""okay"" but the service was not good at all.. My server didn't say any suggestions..and when I Asked if the pizza was thin or thick his answer was ""I think so"".. What an answer is that??? By the way.. The hostess didn't smile and she wasn't sweet at all.. I worked as a hostess for three years and your job is SMILE!!!! I'm not coming back!"
Primel K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,14,,3.0,7/20/2015,Probably one of the most overrated places I know. This place is so hyped and does not live up to it tbh. It takes hella long just to get seated upstairs(1-2 hrs usually) not to mention the 40 min wait to get your food and all for some fancy mediocre tasting food. If anything the pastas are pretty good and the burgers ate decent but for the wait/price/hype I kinda expect better.. Nonetheless it's a great place for special occasions due to the whole fancy atmosphere etc.  I would come here 1-2 times a year.
