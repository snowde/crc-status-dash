Wil K.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",61,79,21,2.0,5/26/2015,Long wait!  Also the staff at the front desk much rather have girl talk then assist the customers checking in.  The food is typical Cheesecake Factory and the service is mediocre.  Overall it is a typical food chain that services overprice cafeteria food.
jack a.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,19,1,5.0,1/23/2017,Excellence food very nice atmosphere good service nice out side setting mall view always busy
Mika A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,91,137,5.0,7/15/2016,"I love to go to The Grove on my birthdays, or other occasions, and eat here, the food is amazing! The staff is very attentive and friendly, and the place is really nice overall. Even the bread they serve before the meal is good, the brown bread is delicious! I usually get one of their pastas, my favorite is their fettuccine Alfredo, it has a really good sauce! And when it's your birthday, they give you a free ice cream sundae in a nice glass! The experience makes a lasting memory, especially on special occasions!"
Darius G.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,67,60,4.0,3/28/2014,"Cheesecake is consistent and you can't go wrong when you are hungry and you can't figure out what you want to eat. With a vast selection of menu items from pasta to meat to salads, they fill every void. What I really like about Cheesecake is the ""Skinylicious"" menu.  It's lean and clean food and very reasonable pricing. A job well done Cheesecake Factory!"
Ava K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,29,,4.0,12/2/2016,The food is consistent and great portions. I eat here at least once a week.
Samantha O.,"New York, NY",3,30,32,5.0,11/16/2014,"We got a few of their snack and appetiser menu options and boy was it worth it!  Cheesecakes are a must!! We tried the strawberry original and banana mousse. Nothing to fault at all! Waiter was friendly, very busy but still made time for all his tables."
Jackie K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",234,21,6,1.0,1/27/2016,"We had a terrible experience. We came there on a Tuesday night for my daughters 9th birthday.  The waiter held a tray full of drinks, including coffee, virgin daquiries, lemonade, and water, over my daughters head.  When she moved in her chair, he spilled the contents of the tray all over my child and into my purse and coat and me.  We were soaked.  My daughter was crying and sticky.  The waiter did not get a manager (the restaurant was so busy that it was hard to get any help). Instead he refused to even assist me with drying my coat and purse, and told me that there was nothing he could do about it.  He brought towels and wiped up the floor.  My daughter was a wet wreck.  She was sticky and her spirits were soured.  Despite the fact that my purse was swimming with water with the contents ruined, I attempted to bring up the mood so as to help my daughter forget the unpleasantness.  At the end of the meal... no one was around to help.  I tried to wave down assistance for 20 minutes... the evening was getting late.  I got up to leave with my family when finally a check was brought to me.  They not only charged me for everything, there were even additional drinks added to the list that were not ordered. I was in a hurry to leave, and I didn't want to get my daughter upset by arguing, so I quickly paid the check and even added the standard gratuity. When I called the next day regarding what happened so that my dry cleaning would be covered, they kept me on hold for 15 minutes before some manager named Cindy said ""that's not what my waiter told me""  and that ""no one heard a child cry"" and that ""you could have called a manager"" Avoid this place. The staff are only superficially nice, but deep down they hate their customers Who would pour a tray of drinks on people and then not pick up their dry cleaning bills. They don't have enough service -- make you wait before you get in and also make you wait as you sit for service. Avoid this place like the plague."
Neda K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/13/2016,It is a great restaurant and the service is also great. I love the avocado eggroll and the smoothies. The only problem is that it takes too long to get a table.
Arlene S.,"Tracy, CA",34,60,23,5.0,7/12/2016,"Had lunch here with my family and ordered from their lunch special. Our server Rebecca was friendly and attentive. My girls had pizza and salad. I had the almond chicken sandwich with ceasar salad and onion soup while my husband ordered the salmon. Presentation, taste, portion and cleanliness of the restaurant is a five for me although I didn't care much about the onion soup, a little too salty for me. Food was delicious and definitely coming back again. Location is perfect for shoppers."
Breeana Y.,"Burbank, CA",0,7,8,4.0,6/25/2016,Love Cheesecake Factory!! Even though this specific one has a wait the customer service is great Demetrius was my server and was great and friendly ! I always get the farfalla pasta or the buffalo blast
Kamran P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,8,2,1.0,9/17/2016,"The management, socks extremely out of order,  I would not recomended for a group, since waiters  get advantages and bring  foods late, wrong food  and do not well trained. Will complain to headquarter does not deserve even for one star"
Charles M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2016,Worst place ever . They took 2 hour to get a table . Manager was a asshole. The food was bad . Don't  go there . Duck them being real
Jean T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,48,15,5.0,4/7/2015,So far good customer service. The food is good. The  Miso Salmon is the best! Fresh warm bred served. Huge menu choices.i would recommend for a date or a big family. On the weekend you can expect to wait an hour to be seated.
Barry S.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,4.0,6/30/2017,"will definitely come back, love the shrimp, love the alfredo, love the service, just looooove it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Kennya M.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,5,,1.0,1/17/2016,This has to be the worst experience i have had... The hostess was extremely rude and wouldn't put my name on the list yet continued to take other parties! I felt so disrespected.. As if i wasn't good enough to be placed ??? So i asked her why she completely ignored me and continued to take other parties ... She looked at me and told me i had to wait? Well i been in line and yet u continue to take parties from the sideline ??   I just left and took my business to the restaurant across ... And there was no wait and the food was delicious!! U guys have to try Morels steakhouse  .:: best experience ever!
Vicky P.,"Los Angeles, CA",430,528,440,4.0,7/23/2012,"I can't go wrong with this place.   Admittedly, their service slows down when the place gets packed, but it's nothing too problematic.  Their pasta dishes are usually on the dry side...  why they don't make enough sauce for each dish is beyond my comprehension.  Their portions are pretty big, so I always end up taking leftovers home for a second, even third meal. Be forewarned though: the entire place gets REALLY loud!  I usually like sitting out on the patio where everyone else's conversations don't bounce off the walls to my table. Some decent dishes: - Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - Spinach and Artichoke Dip: definitely NOT as good as the one at CPK, but still good - Chicken Bellagio: Can be a bit dry, but the arugula makes this dish so yum~  Make sure you ask for extra arugula so that you get the mix of different texture throughout the entire meal - Chicken Madeira: My go-to dish.  You can't go wrong with this one.  So yummy and moist...  and the asparagus is always steamed just right. - Club Sandwich - Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club - Blackened Chicken Sandwich If you have room for dessert afterwards, a slice of cheesecake to share is a must!!!  These are some of my favorite: - Fresh Strawberry - Ultimate Red Velvet - Fresh Banana Cream - Vanilla Bean - Kahlua Cocoa Coffee - Wild Blueberry White Chocolate - Peppermint Bark"
Yeoreen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,36,3,4.0,7/20/2015,"The vibe here makes me feel luxurious. The waiters & waitresses are really friendly. When I come for dinner I usually wait around 10 minutes to even an hour, but I think it's worth it. Their bread & butter for appetizer is free and it's really good. Maybe it's good because it's free HAHA. Their coke is really good and refreshing. Yes... some cokes just taste awful but their coke never disappointed me. Their food:  Pasta Carbonara: BOMB! I always get this when I come here. I love bacon & cheesy noodles... so it's carbonara. I usually get another plate (of the other person's choice) and we share the two plates. It's less overwhelming like that because you don't get all of one plate. Carbonara can get a little bit cheesy in the end... One star off is for the wait, but it's reasonable."
Shaun S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,,4.0,6/7/2016,"This place has the best happy hour!the staff is always nice and the service is very quick, they validate as well!"
Audrey H.,"Las Vegas, NV",663,543,486,4.0,2/9/2014,"I'm not fan of Cheesecake Factory.....but I have to say this was the first time I actually enjoyed eating here.   I had the lunch Garlic Noodles with Shrimp, it was little too salty..but over all it was tasty.  I really enjoyed it.  The girls and I shared the buffalo wings and the shrimp dynamite.  They both were super delicious!  I had the Peach Mimosa, perfectly done.   I would definitely come back here. =D"
Shawn H.,"Los Angeles, CA",193,3,,5.0,6/17/2016,"I am truly pleased with this Cheesecake Factory location! I arrived at dinner time (which can be chaotic) but was able to be seated right away. From the young hostess at the door to my server, Daniel! Daniel was on the spot awesome! Great personality, and got my order right on the first try! I look forward to coming back again!"
