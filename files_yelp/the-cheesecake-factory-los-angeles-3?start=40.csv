Theodore C.,"Los Angeles, CA",269,129,1171,1.0,5/9/2017,I have to understand that fat meat is greasy... lol. I placed my order at 5:35 pm and my server approaches me at 5:53 pm stating my food is on its way. It is now 6:03pm and counting what makes matter worse everyone around me has several elaborate dishes and my food has yet to arrive. My server did offer me some soup and or salad while suggesting 6:05 and counting. The food arrived 35 minutes after ordering it....here is the kicker....they forget the fries....
Kira L.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,442,164,2.0,4/11/2017,"I ordered from Cheesecake Factory via Door Dash and was severely disappointed with a wrong delivery order. Who is to blame? I'm not 100% sure, but since the salad was prepared incorrectly, and I was missing key items like the darn DRESSING and salad toppings, I'm leaning towards Cheesecake Factory being in the wrong. I can't imagine Door Dash was in the kitchen making my food... so I hold the restaurant responsible for not including dressing for my Santa Fe salad, and also leaving out the crispy onions and ALSO for not including bread when I specifically requested it.  I called the restaurant for any reparations, and they told me that I needed to contact Door Dash for refunds. Fine, I'll accept my financial reparations from Door Dash, but I still hold the restaurant responsible because making the food properly is YOUR responsibility.  I'm sure people who have ordered delivery can understand the amplified frustration when food doesn't arrive correctly. We wait almost an hour for the food, and when it finally comes... it's not what we ordered. Plus, there's rarely anything we can do to correct the mistake immediately. We just have to be extremely disappointed with our meal for the day. It is quite frustrating and definitely affects my future decisions to order from this restaurant ever again."
Andy C.,"Chino, CA",4,85,31,1.0,8/27/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory! Unorganized long waits mediocre food and bad service! Couldn't get any worse on a Saturday ! Just don't understand how management does not organize their staff better. Waited for over a hour to get seated for two, another 15 mins to order and 30 minutes to get the food.  Will not be returning !"
Joshua S.,"Los Angeles, CA",373,40,52,3.0,8/31/2017,"Came yesterday for a late lunch! The service was a little slow but the food was great!! As you can tell by the pictures we ordered a lot of food!! One tip I would say is that the server served us our food and didn't once come back to check on us, we had to ask other servers and bus boys for Napkins and even spoons!"
Josef F.,"Palm Springs, CA",13,2,,1.0,11/18/2017,"i have been there many times.  Food and service usually is very good, but tonight after waiting more than thirty minutes for our food the manager came and apologized for the delay and told us that the kitchen burned my chicken picatta and that they are making it again.  When the food finally arrived I realized the chicken was undercooked.  I showed the manager and decided not to wait for another replacement!  I was offerred free dessert and we ordered two desserts we were charged for one of them!"
Ingrid R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,1,1.0,12/16/2017,First of all. Utensils should be the first thing out on the table...I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for a damn fork...second the food was disgusting...third the service was horrible...I would not come back here at all so over priced for crappy food....and the wait was ridiculous...an hour and 30 mins just so I'd order some nasty pineapple Chicken Shit that I had to send back cause it was just too gross for me to eat...my sister and I regretted coming here instead of wood ranch smh worst decision ever
Kristy T.,"North Hollywood, CA",27,273,569,3.0,10/1/2017,"I grew up on The Cheesecake Factory but when I became an adult and began to explore I moved on to different things. That being said I have loved this place most of my life. The food is consistent. Nothing spectacular nothing too tragic but today I was here for brunch and my breakfast potatoes were crunchy hard and so greasy I squeezed one and it dropped on the plate. The sad part is that I could tell by looking at it that this was going to happen. That is a simple quality control issue that could have been addressed in the kitchen before it came to the table. I exchanged it for a side salad instead. The disappointing part is that no member of management came to speak with me about it and the potatoes were left sitting on the table for the duration of our meal. It's been years since I've been here, it will probably be years before I come back. The wait staff was very nice and understanding and they worked tables together to assist each other which is always a plus."
Eric B.,"Porter Ranch, Porter Ranch, CA",17,96,193,3.0,6/17/2017,The service was too slow here. We came around 3 pm and we had a hard time just getting our orders in. Of course food is always good here however to get a guacamole dip took 30 minutes. Overall 3 stars because of time. And prices are about $15-25 per person.
Dara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,385,46,1.0,8/23/2017,"I had a disappointing dinner here and I hope someone from management finds this review. My friend and I had dinner here last night (Tuesday) at 6pm. We got seated right away and our waitress was fast to offer water, bread and take our order. I ordered the almond crusted kale salad from the superfood section. At first I asked for dressing on the side then changed my mind and said just give me the salad as is. My friend ordered the same salad but instead of kale asked for mixed greens. Both of our salads arrive but look completely different aside from the greens. My salad was missing pretty much everything- dressing, avocado, quinoa and cranberries. I asked the waitress if this was how my salad was supposed to be because they looked very different. She told me she would take it back to the kitchen, 10 minutes late I get the corrected salad.  I understand mistakes happen but HOW they get handled says a lot about the restaurant and customer service. I am not going to ask for a discount but I do think a discount or complimentary dessert should have been offered. I just expected a bit more service. Oh well."
Janelle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,91,31,1.0,11/12/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is horrible & super disorganized. Every time ive gone there, they always have issues seating people. Anyway, today i went again & it's safe to say this is the last time i visit this location. The woman in the front (bottom floor) saw my husband and i clearly waiting to give our name for the list and she proceeded to help someone who came in after us. I'll be calling to complain about that tomorrow. The waiter brought out the most stale, hard sourdough bread to our table & when we pointed it out to him he said he'd get us a fresh batch. He also admitted that several other people had complained about the bread, but then brought out another stale batch to our table. We ordered our food and didnt get steak knives. We never got refills on our drinks. Horrible service."
Angel C.,"Inglewood, CA",186,19,9,1.0,12/7/2017,"Doesn't take reservations, fix your website and help your people with better information."
Tarnya M.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",10,1,,1.0,11/21/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to America a number of times now and I always make sure that the Cheesecake Factory is on my list of places to go.  We went to the Cheesecake Factory in a large family group. It was the last night of our holidays and probably the worst night of our holidays. We waited around an hour (which we expected) to be seated. When our server, April, arrived we were lucky to get a smile out of her. We placed our drink orders and I ordered an alcoholic drink - you know being 30 and all. I got asked for ID, which is fine. I provided the server with my Australian drivers licence. She glanced at my licence asked if I had my passport on me, which I told her no. (As a traveller I never carry my passport on my person in case I lose it or something happens). She then told me she can't serve me any alcohol (I don't even think she looked at the ID properly). We tried to explain that our group had been served at the bar before being seated with the same ID's but she still wouldn't serve us. That was that.  We had also tried to order drinks at the bar after she had declined us service (as we had ordered there prior to being seated) but the server had told the bar staff to refuse us service.  The server came back shortly after and said she feels like she didn't explain herself properly before. She then gave a spiel about how it's company policy and she could lose her job (understandable) and that how every so often the staff of Cheesecake Factory come in and do training on international ID's/licenses (which I call bulls**t as she wouldn't serve us on a valid Australian Drivers Licence). Also, we have been to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants and we were served on the exact same ID's.  Now I understand that there is company policy and procedures and there are laws that need to be followed (being in law enforcement myself) but I feel that the way this was handled was very poor. Our group was extremely dissatisfied with the service provided at this particular store. Furthermore, some of the meals were poor quality.  Our group was not happy with the experience at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove. The server (April) provided poor service from the moment she said hello to the end of our dinner."
Danielle R.,"Hancock Park, CA",1,38,9,2.0,11/18/2017,"Had to knock off two stars, I was there last night.  Usually service is okay, I always go back for their food and drinks.  But last night our waitress took forever to tend to us, & then we weren't given utensils till our food came. My husband was very annoyed & was shocked we didn't have decent service like we always have.  There are a few servers that I usually prefer to be serviced by, but I never know if they are working or not.  We had this waitress before from last night, and the last time we had her she got my order wrong, I had requested no chicken in my pasta, I don't eat red meats, pork, or chicken. So I was bothered by it because the chicken was hidden underneath the pasta, and I had taken few bites of the pasta. I was starving so the second one I devoured. But she never said sorry for the mistake, nothing. The Cheesecake Factory is my favorite  restaurant in LA, so I keep going back. But I'd just prefer if we can just at least have utensils before our food is served to us, and straws when our drinks are given to us."
Michaela M.,"Portland, OR",48,22,8,5.0,12/10/2017,I keep ordering the Thai coconut lime chicken and rice and a key lime cheesecake to go. The beets with goat cheese is also my all-time favorite salad. I love the little pears and the chopped nuts with the arugula and the tender red and golden beets.
Lisa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,10,19,5.0,10/23/2017,Had a great time here last night for our Anniversary!

Sienna S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",318,17,42,4.0,7/9/2017,"You obviously can't ever go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. They have so many options to choose from, that no matter how big your party is, there is definitely something for everyone. From my experience, I try a different dish during each visit and they've never disappointed. Not to mention, their cheesecake is incredible (10/10 would recommend the Red Velvet).  One thing about this location is it is always packed so you'll usually always end up waiting at least 15 minutes for a seat, and on top of that service tends to be a little slow (but they try their best). If you have a lot of time on your hands, and you're looking for a place to hang out with friends, this is the place to be, but if you're in a rush, I would definitely go with somewhere a little quicker.  Side note, if you're a sucker for table bread, you'll LOVE theirs. I could honestly get full off of just the bread itself.  If you want a really good appetizer, go with the avocado egg rolls. Probably the best thing to ever happen to me."
Noam D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/21/2017,I just left the cheescake Food good servisr good but i had to wait for one hour and half
J. L.,"Central LA, West Hollywood, CA",0,52,312,4.0,10/21/2017,"CATERING & OFFICE SNACKS!! Easy way to out do the other moms at school or home events or at work is order some of everyone's favs from here off the catering menu!! Ask for kosher and halal though so we can encourage it.  They are always so nice when I go here whether alone or with my now eleven year old son over all his life even when he was a tiny tot and were even then kind to a woman with a small baby and toddler all thru those hard to deal with kid in restaurant ages he was and though he was well behaved they never rolled their eyes or acted like they did not want families there like some places do so they are very family friendly also but please remember to clean up after small kids at places including restaurants as parents and to tip a little extra when affordable to those waiting on a small child who made a mess not able to fully be cleaned up by those parents. As that should not be a stand out thing and no one should have to have that problem but grateful I was able to eat miso salmon here so often before a big slice of cheese cake over the years. And what a nice kids menu, he always enjoys it!! I do hope they add kosher and halal and diabetes friendly options listed as such on the menu."
Alexandra A.,"West Covina, CA",1,7,,1.0,12/13/2017,"Came here to this restaurant to have a good time. I did with my friend and the food was amazing. What I didn't like was the nasty attitude our first waitress gave us. Did not like her at all. When she had to leave and we had Allison as a waitress she was so much better. Now it was my birthday so me and my friend assumed we'd get a complimentary slice of cheesecake. We were charged which is fine, but the attitude given by Daniel a manager  really pissed us off as he was unprofessional and rude about the ordeal. Won't be coming back here at all I'll stick to the Santa Monica location. I'd give ZERO stars of I could, screw this location."
Esther Y.,"Buena Park, CA",99,381,1111,2.0,2/7/2017,"I got the 1. Shrimp with angel hair pasta ($18.95): Large Shrimp Sautéed with Tomatoes, Lemon, Garlic, Herbs and Fresh Basil on Top of Angel Hair Pasta with a Touch of Marinara Sauce. I'd say it was a 2.5/5.  I also got fries on the side and they were 1/5."
