Sarina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,101,48,5.0,3/16/2016,"My friend was in town from New York and we chose to eat here because she works for the company. Service is always on point and the seating area above the movie theatre was very peaceful and a huge difference from the larger part of the restaurant. I fed my baby Mac and cheese off the kids menu. She is only one and loved it. My friend and I shared the vegan Cobb salad and a pasta. I enjoyed the Vegan Cobb. It had fruit on it but I thought that was slightly strange but the quinoa addition was very nice. We ordered Santa Fe Egg Rolls also, if you have these make sure you use the dipping sauce and eat some rice noodles which are really a garnish but we enjoyed. Refills came when they were supposed to and they gave us enough time to dine due to the baby slowing us down. They even brought fresh bread when we requested with olive oil and balsamic. Fantastic!"
serra k.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,40,23,5.0,3/24/2015,Absolutely amazing cheese cake. I love their chocolate tower truffle cake. Just share it with sombody. The only place i feel i am eating real cake. It usually takes long time to get seated but worths to wait. Go weekdays around 3 pm.
Ebony W.,"New York, NY",131,15,16,5.0,4/25/2016,Jimmy our server rocks! He's super friendly and made us feel like we were the only ones in the place. I'd definitely come back to this location just so I could have him as my server.
Marilyn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/7/2017,"i'm about a month or 2 late on this review. okay let's start ,! my sister's name was jimmy who i had before and didn't quite suit me but this time i give it to him !! he was amazing super attentive  very professional and he went out of his way for some hot water for my baby !!! he deseves 5 stars as for the restaurant can't say the same thing . my baby is a small 9 monther so sitting on the chair wadnt working out for us . i asked to get my stroller an it seemed fine until the host (can't remember her name)  decided to sit a family with a hightchair right across from us making it difficult for anyone to pass through.  we had literally ordered had appetizers on our table out drinks were half way an they asked us to move . whatever we did it ! just to sit right in the entrance of the bathroom and the kitchen. i mean come on i know it's loud but that is even louder. my kid was going to fall asleep that's another reason i needed my stroller. my brother in law ended up leaving cause he was so upset . eventually we got a manager cause we didn't want to sit there and our food was coming out . we ended up sitting back down where we originally where at and our appetizers were gone, our drinks were gone, we had our table cleaned and re set up. we begged my brother in law to come back we asked for our appetizers again and our drinks . it was kind of chaotic specially with a annoyed baby . our host told us we weren't allowed tobhsve strollers in the section where we were due to safety issues an i get it but nothing had been said and everyone saw us bring it i mean u sat another family across from us . why didn't u move them ?? . anyways , i went to the bathroom just yo find the host and she asks me "" what did the manager tell u "" i'm sorry i don't mean to be rude but ""none of ur business ? long story short we got our food jimmy was super helpful re setting us up and just being super extremely attentive . this is the closet cheesecake we have and i love the food but i think i rather hit the road and go somewhere else . jimmy wish u the best dude but i'm sure u can find a way better place to work at ."
Neil G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1011,552,1147,4.0,10/30/2013,"Yay! I'm a fan...Yes, I really am. I was pleasantly surprised with my first try at The Cheesecake Factory. It turned out to be a perfect Sunday night dinner with friends. Even though service is on the slow side, the very cordial server and the delicious mouth watering menu made it worth while. As the name implies, The Cheesecake Factory specializes on ""cheesecake"", however with the wonderful selections on their menu, the Salad, Pasta's & Farfalle are just too  hard to resist!  The Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic I ordered was terrific! Blanketed with a rich and creamy Parmesan cream sauce, this dish just screams ""eat me!"" I also tried the Chinese Chicken Salad that my sister ordered...what an amazing way to start a meal! Sliced grilled chicken breast, rice noodles, mandarin orange and other delightful goodies consist this refreshing starter! Our table have become a smorgasbord of generous servings of aromatic and mouth watering pasta dishes! With marinara or white sauce, they all looked amazing and tasted fantastic! I have to say, The Cheesecake Factory impressed me, Often I just zoomed and scrolled past TCF when looking for dinner place suggestions, with the fantastic service and generous delicious food serving that we got, I highly recommend giving The Cheesecake Factory a try - it would probably change the way you look at a Cheesecake House. Chin chin!"
Crumpet T.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,46,7,5.0,3/13/2015,"THE CHEESECAKE                                    FACTORY _______________________________________________      I LOVED this place, the custom r service was  and the food was also  I had a great time we sat outside, and you can see the WHOLE grove (well almost) and our waiter was very nice. I loved the cheesecake the most!  ps. this was written and photographed by my 9yo daughter."
Lu L.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,58,,2.0,2/28/2016,Stopped in for quick drinks. It was nice that a few seats at the bar were open and we didn't have to wait but my Bloody Mary drink was not the best.
Jennie A.,"Joshua Tree, CA",1,16,7,3.0,2/27/2016,Just so-so. Excellent food (as always) but mediocre service. We spilled some water and it took someone five minutes to come over. When I try to hand the lady I reported it to the bowl of pasta that was filled with water she just stared at it for a full 10 seconds. And she looked at me and said OK but never took it. I looked at her and said well can you take this so we can wipe the table? Sheesh.
TROY E.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,116,108,5.0,9/12/2015,Perfect vegan salad and great waiter Tyler. What I enjoyed the most is how good the food was and the waiter being so involved with the selection of food and making sure what I ordered was vegan with no dairy products.
Candace B.,"PANORAMA CITY, CA",195,279,2578,5.0,5/19/2014,"Enjoying a leisure stroll with my fiancé and we decided to stop here for lunch. The customer service was great. All the servers were pleasant and welcoming. They had a Skinnylicious menu which made me happy, watching my weight and all. I ordered the crab bites and the firecracker salmon rolls, delicious! I had the miso salmon with brown rice, it was good also. We didn't wait long for our food or drinks and the server kept refilling my iced green tea. I would definitely come again. My server was very nice."
Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",298,1008,961,4.0,2/3/2014,"What's left to say? The Grove kicks butt! I do however, wish there were more Cheesecake Factory locations. As my bff and I forged around the bar area like famished transients w/ attempt at locating an available table, we placed our names upon the wait list. Half an hour... not bad. I've DEFINITELY seen worse here.  Wouldn't you know it? Turned our backs a split 2nd and we got table-jacked by Laverne and Shirley. Bunch of whores!!!!  Talk about karma. Another table opened up immediately afterwards and those troglodytes that stole ours' were forced to remain seated at the bar ^ HAAA! Hope you develop hemorrhoids, ole' heiffers! Anyway... What can I say that hasn't already been stated? Cheesecake Fact- is totally hit or miss. I've had everything from their jambalaya (meh.....) to their deep fried macaroni. I swear the taste is completely contingent on which location you elect to dine within. I personally find there food to be quite bland while their drinks rarely ever disappoint. I've been to the location in Sherman Oaks, as well as Marina alongside this particular one and NO 2 meals have ever been prepared the same. I do, however, prefer this location simply for ambiance and accessibility. Might I recommend the ""Ritz""? You'll be quite happy you did."
Marilyn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/17/2017,"Brought my mom here for valentine's day , didn't wait at all we got there around 3. Our server was Jimmy at the beginning , worst swevice ever .  First of all He leaned in on our table as if we knew him didn't write down our order and when we asked questions he answered with a rude tone . We decided to move tables because we sat in the first table and my mom couldn't get up with out bumping into someone his answer was "" we are getting a rush it's going to be loud an people will be everywhere "" I'm a server my self and never have I ever answered anyone like this it's your job to make sure we have a great experience and make people comfortable.  I mean we did spend over 200 dollars . Anyways once he said we were getting another server I was so glad . I forgot her name but she was a lot better . She could have been a bit more welcoming but her service was wayyyyyy better than Jimmy's.  Ohhhhh an once I got my food they had given me mashed potatoes instead of French fries he came over an said "" I got everyone's order correct!"" I said no I asked for French fries not mashed potatoes , his answer was "" well u have French fries there so u got them so everything is good "" not even a apology maybe write down ur orders next time and try being a little nicer!! Doubt I'm coming back here I honestly rather drive further for better service ."
Denis D.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,30,14,4.0,1/23/2016,"This is a nice place, but the lines are crazy long and it is on the pricier side for the food they serve."
F G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,23,4,3.0,12/6/2014,"When we arrived there was a 30 minute wait. The hostess was pleasant and smiling. When we we were seated it was prompt and the seater was polite. Our server was very polite and quite pleasant. Refills came often and quick. My guests ordered the cob salad and the orange chicken both were plentiful and enjoyable. I ordered the Tex Mex egg roll. This is not the first time that I orders them but first time in a while. I was very disappointed, they changed the recipe. They were greasy, over cooked, and burned. When mentioned to the server nothing happened. I did not eat them. Overall I enjoyed my visit, I guess I'll stick to what I know."
Liam J.,"West Hollywood, CA",4,21,76,3.0,7/24/2015,"I think this place is pretty average. My friend and I went last night and waited 15 minutes to be seated, this is not bad at all considering it was a Thursday night. I ordered the Asian chicken salad. Big portion but not a lot of flavor. My friend got chicken tacos. He said they were delicious. The server was ok. Overall an average experience. Unfortunately, I probably wouldn't go back."
Natasha S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,35,8,4.0,7/22/2014,The food is always good. Not exceptionally awesome but just good food! Haven't eaten something I don't like. Some things are really awesome others are okay.  I love sitting outside because the inside gets so loud!
Eugi H.,"Los Angeles, CA",732,1274,127,4.0,2/15/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is a pretty safe choice for food. I almost always get their carbonara pasta, it's my guilty pleasure =). It's the fattiest, greasiest bowl of pasta ever but it's SO good. I like this location more than others because they take down your phone number and will text you when your table is ready, so you can wander the rest of the Grove instead of just standing around waiting. Also, they have a wonderful view on the balcony, great for people watching and if there is any kind of event going on. We also got the avocado, zucchini, and portobello mushroom fries as an appetizer the last time we went, and it's an awesome starter! I love portobello fries, and the batter they use here is great! I've never had avocado fries until then and I think it may top portobello fries for me! So creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside! Love! The staff here are really nice and the service is pretty quick. Great food choice when you have a large party and when you want to maximize your shopping time at the Grove!"
Simone T.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,574,1123,4.0,4/30/2015,"Had a late Friday date night with the hubby and as we were strolling along at the grove we decided to eat here since it was one of the places still open. Now we arrived at 11pm and still had a good 15-20 minute wait. I love the overall atmosphere of this place its spacious with high ceilings and if your not dining here you can go right up the escalator and bam order up your desserts. WINNER!!!! They have a very extensive eclectic menu, I had the Jamaican chicken which was very good but did not care for mango salsa. The hit of the evening was our appetizer, the fried mac n cheese balls they were golden cheesy perfection. Service was a little slow but our waitress was fantastic, the place was popping so I'm patient. My only con is the small tables and dim lighting, which is great if they had enough room for a candle on the table, but they can barely fit plates, drinks, and free bread. Took home a slice of fudge cake and I must say now that I think their cakes are the underdog here, because they definitely outshine the cheesecake in my opinion. Yes I will be back I gotta lotta stuff to try!!!!!"
Seth B.,"San Dimas, CA",1,172,4,5.0,4/10/2015,"I really do love the Cheesecake factory.  The service and food are both outstanding. The menu is hilariously large, but manages to be creative.  The salads here are surprisingly good and their sandwiches are fresh and flavorful. Ironically, the one thing that isn't very good here is the cheesecake....go figure.  Other deserts are great, however.  The strawberry shortcake is isn't short on anything. Will it change the way you look at food?  No.  But if you're looking for a semi-casual dining experience managed impeccably, then look no further."
Madeline N.,"Torrance, CA",0,11,,5.0,11/6/2016,I made the mistake of going here on a Saturday night at the grove which also happened to be the first week of the Christmas light set up etc. Cheesecake was packed- 1.5 hour wait for 2 people so we sat in the bar. But we fortunately had an awesome server - ALLISON. She was working her ass off to accommodate all her tables and all the special requests. She was so polite and professional even when there were cranky guests testing her patience. We might not be back on Saturday night but will still come for the awesome staff here! Thanks Allison:)
