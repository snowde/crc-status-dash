Diana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,13,10,4.0,9/1/2014,"I love this place!. The pineapple upside down cheesecake is to die for!. It is the main reason why  come here. However, the rest of the menu is very extensive and tasty. They have a separate menu at 600 caloroes or less!(if you meed that). The lettuce wrapped chicken tavos are great!   Best place to share if you want to have desert and a full meal. Try the chicken madera and steak Diane. Try it!. You can just add a small caesar salad (its big!), share that plate with someone and you will have plenty of space to share fesert. Totally worth it!.  Location thou is always super busy. It is hard to decide to eat here because the wait is always at least 20 min. But today, on labor day, it wasnt. We came here and we were told to wait about 30 min. I was very hungry but decided to wait. We only waited 10 min!."
Cirque Du Soleil Chef D.,"Lawndale, CA",337,128,503,4.0,6/12/2014,"Ahhhh.....  I love you Cheesecake Factory.  After a gastly experience at Swingers Cafe around the corner, it was nice to be in a beautiful and clean establishment.  The first thing we did was wash our hands to get the muk off from the sticky menus at Swingers.   We were seated right away and took the elevator to the top floor.  We were leed to a quant little table outside on the patio with a view of the store fronts.  Very nice.  And the weather was perfect.   We ordered the tuna tartare and fried calamari and shared the grilled chicken salad.  All was wonderful and tasty as it should be.  Cheesecake factory has such a vast menu, that there is always something to tantalize your taste buds."
Lidiya M.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,346,735,4.0,5/16/2012,"The first thing you should know is that they DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. This is a well-known restaurant located in a busy shopping mall in the heart of Los Angeles! What the hell do you think is going to happen if you show up at 7 PM on a Saturday night?! You're going to effing wait. So don't be a dick to the host or bitch to your friends about it--you CHOSE to come here, you CHOSE a busy restaurant, and you CHOSE to come on a noted DATE NIGHT. So stop being such a moron. If you don't want to wait for good food and ambiance, hit up a drive-through. *end rant* I have never once had bad service here. That already says a lot about this place. I've come for lunch, dinner, late night, in between meals, whatever time of day--never gotten a shitty server. In fact, I've always left a good tip here. I feel like, for once, my age is not an issue at this place and the server doesn't treat me like a sub-par customer because I'm not holding a black Amex.  Food I've had here that's rocked my socks: Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pastai CAJUN JAMBALAYA PASTA!! (my personal favorite) HIBACHI STEAK (server recommended it and it's amazing!) MISO SALMON  Cajun Chicken Littles (my boyfriend gets this EVERY time) Avocado Eggrolls Thai Lettuce Wraps Cheesecake (avoid the low carb one and you'll find a plethora of tasties) Food that's been good, but not stellar: Chicken Madeira (surprising since it's their ""most popular dish"") Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp Chicken Bellagio I can't really speak to their breakfast menu since I've never had it here, and judging by their menu, probably never will. I've had drinks here before and to be honest, it's just not worth it. There's plenty of other places to get drinks and kick back at that have a better drinking vibe. Also, never had any fish dishes here, but I'm curious about them. Maybe next time? Go for the food. And sit on the patio!"
Tete J.,"Fontana, CA",3,51,3,1.0,11/1/2015,"BE ADVISED: I ordered steak Diana and I received stew pieces on my plate. I called up The manager told him I've had this dish at multiple cheesecake factories and it is nothing like this, he takes it back and gets me a new one and it is the same exact dish they just warmed it up. It's called ""steak Daine"" meaning a while Steak cut in without altering the look of the actual steak not stew pieces. The meat was so brittle and chewy it was disgusting.  Also, my friend ordered salmon with shrimp scampi and they gave her the salmon and three pieces of grilled shrimp that was clearly not even in the scampi sauce like other cheesecake factories. They seem to do their own thing in the location.  Let's not forget the rude hosts at the door, they all need to be fired and hire new polite employees.  I would never come to this location ever again."
Erica K.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,37,,4.0,7/16/2015,"An obvious choice for families and they know how to accommodate but I did learn a few tricks. Instead of taking advantage of their high chairs which I thought were a bit too low for the table, I used my own booster seats. But discovered the same problem - the table was eye level so the boys' had to reach up a bit to grab the food. For more, check out my site - link in profile!"
Pau N.,"Hollywood, CA",0,3,4,1.0,10/17/2015,"Just came back from The Cheesecake Factory after having celebrated two birthdays in our party of 6.  The following incidents occurred on a Friday night and I'd understand if the waiters were just having a bad day to begin with. However, it does not constitute their rude behavior and unwarranted comments. The other Yelp reviewers were right when they said that the service was bad. I've withheld the waiters' names to protect their rights. Waiter 1 - Everything was going okay in the beginning and he even took our group photos (not well, unfortunately). Then he wrote down our orders: 1 Da Vinci Pasta, 1 Chicken Scampi, 3 Chicken Madeira, and 1 Bang Bang Chicken. He repeated the order and we thought we were good. Twenty to 30 minutes later, our order arrives, but instead of 3 Madeiras, 2 other waiters bring in 3 Chicken Scampis. We tell them that we only ordered 1 Chicken Scampi.  The waiters go back and probably caused a commotion because Waiter 1 comes over shortly and says aloud, ""Next time, be careful with what you order"", trying to take the blame away from himself and putting it on us. Remember, the guy repeated the order before he left, but he tells us that we got it wrong?  He quickly leaves before we could say anything--we were shocked.  The manager must have gotten word and came over to apologize about the mistake on our order. We told her what rude Waiter 1 said and we confirmed it was only him, and not the other waitress who also attended to us (but more on her later). The manager offered two soups on the house. This lady, unlike her waiters, has good PR and customer service. She alone deserves a star. Waiter 2 - She was the waiter who tended to us for the remainder of the evening. We thought everything was going smoothly, but we were mistaken. One of us in our party had spoken with this waitress early on to let them know that we had 2 birthday celebrants. When it was time for dessert, our friend asked Waiter 2 if she remembered what they spoke about and if they had some kind of birthday treat (which they've done in the past, along with singing 'Happy Birthday'; they even did it that same night for a different table). Waiter 2 says with an attitude that came out of no where: ""We don't offer free cheesecakes; if we did, everyone would be coming here"".  First of all, our friend didn't ask for a free cheesecake. She was trying to help you recall your earlier conversation. Secondly, you are in the customer service industry--what is up with the attitude and why? It seems that Waiter 2, for reasons known only to her, mistook what our friend said. Waiter 2 continues to ask if whether we'd like to order dessert, gives us some time, and leaves to pack up our leftovers. When she came back, we declined in ordering desserts and instead asked for the bill. Did we leave a tip? No way. Would anyone in their right mind leave a tip after being insulted? Twice? No, and no thanks.  We won't be coming back to this Cheesecake Factory located at The Grove. There's a long wait (they don't take reservations), they have rude and untrained waiters, and bad lighting. The only good thing was the manager. Someone give her a raise! With that said, we don't want any of the waiters to be fired from their jobs; we simply want to let it be known that their attitude and behavior was insulting and uncalled for.  After this bad experience, we brought our party to Marmalade Cafe at the Farmer's Market side for dessert. We were met with kindness and great, quality service. Cheesecake Factory, head over to the Marmalade Cafe and you guys might learn a thing or two."
Kami R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,3,5.0,1/5/2016,"I love coming to this Location.... My food is always Good and the staff is very friendly and welcoming.... Just remember if your going during ""happy hour"" it gets pretty busy and you might have to wait awhile for your food, but it will be delicious! :)"
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,5.0,9/9/2013,"Came in with 8 people, was promised an hour and when I called back in half hour to add one more person, they handled it like the pros they are! We were seated in less than the time the told us. They noticed the number of children with us and our server took good care of them by taking their order first and making sure they were situated.  The food is always a 5-star because you can't go wrong with Cheesecake! The service was great. With three large parties located immediately next to our tables, the servers didn't miss a beat. it's the kind of service that corporate offices would dream of. I was very impressed. Cost was very good for the quality and service. For 9 people to have lunch and drinks, it came out to $175 including the added gratuity for the large group. I was very satisfied. I only wish that they would open up in Santa Clarita so we don't have to drive all the way down!"
Jeanne R.,"San Pedro, CA",9,40,4,5.0,5/6/2014,"Dining at Cheesecake Factory makes eating out an enjoyable experience; nice environment, kind staff, and delicious food for fair prices! This restaurant is located right next to the movie theater, and has both indoor and outdoor seating. All aspects of this establishment are clean, from the dining areas to the restrooms. All of the servers we've been with were very patient, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.  The menu has many different kinds of dishes, from American to Asian to Italian. Servers bring out baskets of warm bread and butter while you go through the very large menu, and after eating, you can choose from a plethora of desserts. Oh, and if you're looking for a place to grab lunch, they also have lunch specials! They range in price from around $10-15, and they're just as delicious and large portioned. Overall, whether you're having a casual dinner date or celebrating a special occasion, Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place for you!"
Ash M.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",7,202,134,2.0,1/18/2015,the food is good got the Louisiana chicken pasta and my girl got the white chicken chili and both were good we also got buffalo blast. No complains  The waiting period is very slow they told us 1:10 mins before we can be sittted for a party of 4. Then we had to wait like 20mins for food to come. Our server didn't have any customer service matter fact she seemed like she didn't wanna be their. Took 10 mins just to bring our drinks ! No service !!
Daria K.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,7,,5.0,1/20/2016,"We celebrate the birthday. All liked the waiters sang a song together, and gave a dessert at the same time a sense of celebration. I do not know of other places may well congratulate recommend! The only negative, which I ordered dessert, imagine a ball of ice cream, and when he brought the ice cream is almost completely melted. therefore traditionally 5 stars."
Ariana A.,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA",0,16,18,5.0,2/12/2015,"Just had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove it was amazing! Our server was Demetrie, really sweet guy and took care of us very well.  After a long day at work all I wanted was a good drink and a really great dinner with my boyfriend & that's what we got and more. Thank you Demetrie for taking care of us, you're such a sweetheart."
Melody C.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,119,198,3.0,5/6/2015,"Took my son and foster kids out for lunch here today. The service was good. Thank you Sophia.  One adult and 4 kids having a day out at the Grove. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip. It was good but a little on the cold side. The kids ordered the kids Mac n cheese, kids pizza and kids chicken quesadilla. Really can't go wrong with kids food, ya know.  I had tried the grilled salmon last time and it was dry and too cooked. Asked for not too well this time and it was raw inside. Asked for the Tataki salad to go. Will rule on it once I get to eat it. Ok a little ticked at the Tataki salad. Nothing anywhere says it has ginger. I hate it when people eliminate stuff like that from the menu. If you are going to add a garnish, especially if something so pungent, put it on the G- D menu!! I could've opted out of it! I H8 ginger! Can't stand the sight, smell or taste of it. The portion size of ahi tuna looked great and then BAM!!! Ginger overwhelmed it! Seriously considering reducing the 3 stars I gave!"
Ron A.,"Whittier, CA",105,711,214,4.0,2/23/2014,"Came here since we wanted to get away from our usual area of Orange County. We arrived and it was a little crazy waiting to get the hostess attention since everyone around the her were pushy waiting to be added to the waiting list. Eventually she got to us and got my cell number. I got the text that it was our turn to be seated. We only had to wait about 15 minutes. Not bad on a Saturday for lunch. I was actually surprised of this location. The seating is upstairs. What was even better. We sat outside on the balcony. It was awesome! As for the service. It was slow. There were a good number of times we found ourselves just waiting around, but I did not mind too much since we weren't in a rush. As for the food. I ordered the artichoke and crab dip for appetizer. It tasted better than my entree, but the bread was a little hard to bite down on. As for my main entree which was chicken and biscuits, it was really good. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies. Lastly, we finished after with vanilla bean cheesecake. Awesome! I look forward to coming back for more."
Adam L.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,5,,4.0,7/31/2015,The best margarita in town! AmaZing food for everyone. All the food kinds you can imagine! Love this place! But it is too dark and the waiting list sometimes too long..
Jessica P.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",24,63,8,1.0,12/21/2015,"There was hair in our food, it was quite gross as a blonde staring at this dark hair on my plate made me sick to my stomach..."
Rosa T.,"Paramount, CA",124,7,,5.0,4/5/2016,Came here on Sunday night and our waited happened to be the same guy from my first review. Remembered his name this time which is Jason. Excellent customer service once again and totally recommend him! Thank you!
Ebony M.,"Austin, TX",199,316,3,4.0,11/14/2014,"You know, I've actually never had the cheesecake. But the food is outstanding. You can order from the starters menu and get more options for the sane price as a entree. I really love the honey mustard chicken strips. The wait staff is also really nice. I mostly love that they're open late, so you can feast like a beast after your movie lets out."
Luis S.,"Oxnard, CA",19,6,1,3.0,5/24/2015,"Great food and drinks and service overall but the waiting time was too much, 45 minutes waiting for a text and once you get up stairs to get your table it's another 15-20 minutes! Ain't nobody got time for that!"
Aeri K.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,267,49,1.0,8/25/2014,"Came for lunch and made my day so much more annoying. We come upstairs checked in, party of two. We were waiting to get seated. While we were waiting, another party of two comes up like ten mins after we been waiting for our table. They get seated right away. Finally they seat us and take us to a booth where people were already sitting! Obv they didn't like their table so moved to that booth so I get stuck with some shitty small corner table. Seriously I wonder why do I come here. Not like their food or service is ever great."
