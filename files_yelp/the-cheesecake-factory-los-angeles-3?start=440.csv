Leah P.,"Prosper, TX",312,253,695,1.0,11/8/2014,"My Bestie, Marife and I decided to eat here. Wait was an hour which was normal at this location. Before an hour our table was ready.  Bestie ordered chicken tenders and I ordered Sheila salad. Food came. I gave Bestie some of my salad and Bestie gave me some of her chicken. After a few minutes I see a worm crawling on my plate....suddenly lost my appetite.  Called the server, he apologized,  took my plate then the manager came and apologized asked if I wanted something else, I said no. Managers excuse is because their vegetables are organically grown. Really? Does it mean they don't wash the vegetables before they serve it? Come on, lame excuse."
Kat W.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,1,1.0,12/15/2016,"Me, my husband and  four others family members total 6 of us, were there to celebrate family reunion ON SUNDAY DEC. 11, 2016. After over 2 hours of long wait we finally being seated. We were so hungry and can not wait to have our dinner. We ordered 2 appetizers, drinks, beers, margaritas and 6 main courses. One of the appetizers the buffalo wing was so salty, the thai lettuce was ok, out of the six main courses four was owful, 3 ribeyesteaks should be medium rare but came as one was badly dark burned, one was taugh, 2 salmon dishes, one was ok, the other salmon thai glazed salmon was not came in whole, but there was big missing huge piece at the corner like some just took bite of it, which I pointed out to the waiter and he was ignoring me st first but I insisted to be brought back, even though I was hungry, I will not eat something like that. We are talking about gygiene issue here and it was really gross. Finally he took it back but the chef did not make a new dishes, there were new salmon but the rice and vegetable was all cold and I was really loosing my appetite now after long wait and had disgusting with my fish. The other family member was not happy too, not only the ribeyesteaks was not good like the other cheesecake, the angel hair pasta was saugy and really not a pleasant experience for the whole family. I wrote a letter on the online cheesecakewebsite on Monday a day after the dinner took place, to cheesecake corporate office, but still have not heard anything. This is unacceptable and the Cheesecake management should train their restaurant employees to follow a good HYGIENIC MANNER, BECAUSE IT WILL EFFECT YOUR PROSPERITY AND ESPECIALLY CUSTOMER HEALTH."
Janel A.,"Inglewood, CA",0,5,3,4.0,7/11/2015,"I would have given it 5 stars but this time around our server only checked up on us once. It was only to pour water, not to check up on us. Our server didn't even bother to bring us our food and didn't offer another plate even though he knew we were sharing. The food was mediocre this time around but satisfying."
Felicia G.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",173,609,811,4.0,9/1/2013,Was looking for a replacement after Grand Lux was closed. Being that their sister restaurants I've been coming to Cheesecake for their Sunday Brunch. The quality of the food is similar but the options vary just a little. I would say that the menu is a one size fits all. You can really find something for anyone there. Some of my favorites so far are the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and the Fried shrimp. The miso salmon is also very good. Take your pick. The odds of you being dissatisfied are slim to none. Unless your just really that picky . If your looking for a sub for Grand Lux like I was try Cheesecake. RIP Grand Lux.
Nancy B.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",7,159,261,5.0,3/15/2015,We have the chicken pot stickers for the first time. They were amazing. They came in white ginger sauce with sesame seeds and shaved green onions on top. We split the chicken because I did because it is such a large dish.
Vickie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,96,16,4.0,6/22/2016,I like this place .. But sometimes the hostess is very unkind with this attitude like she's  working at Spago's and believe me I've been to Spago's and the service there is Impeccable But back to cheesecake .factoryAside from that . The food is pretty consistent and I love the atmosphere
Frank A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,42,216,5.0,6/14/2015,"Dinner with the wifey after watching San Andreas .I forgot the young lady's name that helped us , but she was very kind and helpful & place is very clean.they also validate the parking ticket ."
Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4468,2212,19024,4.0,1/2/2011,"Not all Cheesecake Factory restaurants are the same.  Thanks to the fake snow, fake tree, and ""real"" Santa on Christmas Eve ... the Grove was packed ... as were the restaurants.  The Cheesecake Factory was the perhaps the busiest. * The Good: Miso Salmon is among the better entree choices because the Salmon is marinated in fresh Miso and then served with thick Miso Sauce, Snow Peas, and White Rice.  This is remarkably consistent and tasty at all the locations where I've tried it. Honorable Mention: A slice of Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake to go.  Packed in a slice-shaped container (including spot for Whipped Cream), I'm a sucker for the layered Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse and Chocolate.    * The Bad: Eager to branch out for something new, I opted for the Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta.  This could be among the oddest favor combinations I've tasted.  First the pasta was way too al dente.  Then the Honey Glazed Chicken didn't match at all with the Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce. Mixed with Asparagus, Peppers, Peas, and Onion this dish is worth skipping.  Luckily the menu is huge. Honorable mention:  The place was busy and the place was committed to serving as many tables as possible.  To achieve this tables for two were placed practically side-by-side.  We were happy to get a table, but hated having to listen to the lonely guy/mom pair on our right and the awkward couple on our left. * The Ugly The Wait.  Is any place worth a 75 minute wait?  We had to wait 25 minutes just to get the ""pager"" so we could know when our 75 min wait was over.  We tried hovering over some tables in the bar area for a while (as were lots of other couples), but finally resigned ourselves to accept our wait fate downstairs amongst the hordes.  No matter how good a place is, enduring such a long wait deflates the experience. Honorable mention:  The disorganized crush of people trying to get to the hostess counter was a mad free-for all.  I feel sorry for the staff having to try and make the best of it each night.  Wouldn't reservations help? When wanting safe and above average food/desserts at the Grove, the Cheesecake Factory is a comfortable choice."
Tiffany T.,"Los Angeles, CA",366,261,111,4.0,12/18/2013,"I give this Cheesecake Factory location 4 stars. Of course a Cheesecake Factory is just that so there is nothing really special, however, the service and the food were both fantastic this evening. The one thing I don't like is the seating situation. If you don't get a booth, you're pretty close to the people next to you. So if you don't like others in your personal bubble and don't mind waiting a few extra minutes, request a booth   When the host/hostess welcomes you into the restaurant! I forgot my server's name(I'm sure it is on my receipt) but he was phenomenal. Just a genuinely nice guy. Not too cheesy and not a rude server who is over it. He was perfect.  I hope this review helps! The Grove is beautiful any time of day anyway. You might as well go to Cheesecake Factory while you're there! :)"
Christine A.,"Granada Hills, CA",289,490,1392,3.0,1/6/2013,"Parking - you should just park in the structure. Don't forget to bring in your ticket for a parking validation. Have the maitre d validate your parking. Wait - Waited 25 minutes to be seated. Came at 5pm on New Years Eve. Esthetic - as all Cheesecake Factories, the place is dimmed lighted. The restaurant dining is on the 2nd floor. Maitre D and waiting is on the 1st floor. It seems small, and was packed, as all other locations are. Food - The boneless buffalo wings were delicious and severed crispy. For the main course, ordered my favorite....meatloaf. However the taste was off. It was saltier than usual. The mashed potatoes and succotash were very good.  Service - I know it was a busy night but the waiter wasn't as attentive as I needed him to. Had to flag him down several times for drink refills. After asking for a to go box, I decided to have another slice of bread. As I was eating, the waiter removes my plate under me which I thought was a bit rude, since he saw that I was still eating. No, this wasn't my meatloaf plate, but the little platter for the bread. The waiter himself, I didn't catch his name was a bit arrogant, not as friendly as other staff in other locations."
Ilusha Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",42,32,18,1.0,3/22/2014,"The epitome of poor service.  Party of 8 sat in a booth. One of the folks at the party was never served dinner. Refills on fountain drink =0 A religious food requirement was ignored and instead of apologising the chef tried to justify.  The waiter was clueless, and most likely to blame for the missing entre. The manager, when called, was not attentive or considerate. Made a big deal about crediting the meals that were not served. The bread was tasty and one specialty meal was brought correctly. Overall an embarrassing affair for this restaurant. :("
Sxholastica Z.,"West Covina, CA",12,19,181,5.0,2/9/2014,I always come to this branch I've been to the one in the grove and it always disappoints me unlike this branch. They dont have RSVP but You gotta make  come to the front desk 45 earlier to RSVP in person so u can get in faster. it's sometimes Bz. They start you off with complimentary bread and butter  Brown Sweet wheat bread and sourdough bread cut diagonally.  They tell you they're name. I remember one was Sean a nice cute guy with glasses and I think the nice asian girl name Clarissa. The servers are always nice and considerate. I've been here 5 times or more and its nice eat indoors if you don't like the wind. Gets windy and cold outdoors so I stay indoors. I always! Always get the firecracker salmon. It's literally fireworks in your mouth. $12 but worth the experience. It's like a egg roll salmons and the sauce it very unique it's not spicy but it has a kick to it that's delectable to your pallet. It comes with cabbages so mix it and turn it into a salad. Excellent sauce.  I always get the Fettuccine Sundried tomatoes pasta. They make their fettuccine pasta thick and the sauce is so hearty creamy. Very satisfying. The plate can feed 2 people If u wanted. All they're plates are huge!  I always get a nice drink like the Strawberry Fruit Smoothie it has a ripe strawberry on top very soothing to your throat. I like it But I always get the strawberry lemonade cuz I love lemonade. I prefer you to try their drinks.  Over all experience I love their food and atmosphere and customer service. Perfect service every time I come here
Tiffani H.,"Denver, CO",136,264,481,5.0,10/28/2015,"This place always delivers on everything. Good and drinks. I have yet to go wrong on an order. The menu is so big and overwhelming I couldn't decide so I asked out waiter what he likes and he suggested a pasta dish with chicken, peas, tomatoes and cream source. It was loaded with calories but absolutely delish!  I love this place."
Kc E.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,10,,1.0,10/5/2014,"1 star for the 30 minute wait turning into a 50 minute debacle. For being seated when the table wasn't cleaned. For having the worst server ever - never refilled our waters, drinks, nothing. He didn't check on us once. Until we asked to speak to manager.  He had other  staff members come by instead. The manager was just as useless. I hate leaving less than 20% -- but for being a restaurant at the Grove, learn what it means to provide CUSTOMER SERVICE  The food was good. But the shitty service makes me never want to come by again. Get it together CF."
Jackie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,164,352,1.0,7/17/2014,"Don't get me wrong-- I'm a Cheesecake Factory fan. They have a menu BOOK so whether you want pasta, fish, steak, chicken, sandwich, salad-- they have it. I wouldn't say their dishes are excellent but it's a good choice when quantity & medium quality is the name of the game. My personal favorite is the avocado egg roll cuz it's served with a side of crack sauce. Entree wise I like the chicken pasta plate (I think it's the Louisiana chicken with mushrooms & bell peppers). Cheesecake wise the raspberry truffle cheesecake is amazing.  That being said, why does this location suck so much? It seems so fancy when you walk in because you enter to see the hostess section & then you have to take a long escalator (or the stairs) to the dining area. But the service is SUCH A FAIL. The servers travel in packs of 2 cuz they're so busy chatting with each other. They forget to bring your much needed cocktails & bread until you remind them 15 minutes after ordering. They tell you they told the kitchen not to add certain ingredients (ahem: cilantro) but your dish will have cilantro. They try to charge you for things you did not order. They take SOO long to process your bill that you start to wonder if you need to ask about it.  Food was whatever but service was so bad this place gets 1 star. Not a fan-- would not revisit. Don't be lazy & just walk to the farmers market to eat!!"
Myra Jaclyn C.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,13,15,5.0,2/9/2016,"Nice day out and decided to stop by cheesecake for a late lunch/early dinner. Sat at the bar area for happy hour. Got a table really quick and the hostess helped me find a table where I can sit with my sleeping daughter in her stroller. This is the first time I was able to come in sit and order within 10 mins. Had the happy hour house salad, mini corn dogs for the LO, skinnylicious chicken pasta and a virgin pina colada"
W R.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,4,2,3.0,7/14/2014,"My family and I arrived at the Cheesecake Factory located in the Grove yesterday (7/13/2014) for our  compensated meal due to an incident that had occurred several weeks prior where our card was charged twice. Thankfully, the Cheesecake Factory HQ was kind enough to apologize for the situation in which we were grateful.  So, when we arrived at the restaurant we already knew that we were going to get some hate from this. Anyway we tried to brush of the glaring, shooting-daggers-at-you looks from the hostesses and just went about our business. Our waitress was friendly at first but I feel like someone told her our meal was comped, and then she was not-so-friendly and was only to be found when it was bill time.  I had a menu in my hand to order a cheesecake later. So, my sister ordered first and then I was in the process of telling her my order when she just grabbed the menu from my hand and walked away. Yeah, we were appalled but we still tipped her well.  I want to point out that, maybe once a month, my family chooses this establishment to dine in and we ALWAYS order a lot. However, we decided to decrease the amount of dishes we usually order since we felt bad. I loved eating at the Cheesecake Factory before but now, I'm not so sure. I'm sure working in the food industry is difficult but you know what, everyone's job/life is difficult in some way and that's not an excuse to DISRESPECT customers."
Christian C.,"Richmond, VA",239,142,197,4.0,12/18/2015,"came here with my friend for lunch - great lunch menu. There was a small wait because it was Sunday and packed but got seated pretty quickly. Our waitress was nice but not as attentive as I usually get but no biggie. Love this location, will return. The only problem was that the food was NOT piping hot like how I normally like it - just warm - I got the pasta with shrimp and sausage. I was going to ask them to reheat it but being 8 months pregnant and hungry, I just ate it as I couldn't wait lol other than that, great time!"
Ryan P.,"Seal Beach, CA",168,1399,21341,5.0,11/8/2013,Life is better with CHEESECAKE! GOD BLESS those wonderful HAPPY CALIFORNIA COWS!  I spent SOOOO MANY years NOT eating yogurt and cheesecake because I thought I was eating spoiled milk!  I know it sounds crazy but it made since in my head at the time!  BUT I have SEEN the LIGHT and have opened my EYES and HEART to CHEESECAKE! I know they sale food but WHO cares about the food!  I should care but I don't!  I go here for the CHEESECAKE just the CHEESECAKE and ONLY the CHEESECAKE!  I will go in a buy and just buy cheesecake and take it home and eat it alone.  I go for dinner and end up just eating the cheesecake because I LOVE it that much!   I have still NOT had them all.  Partly because they enjoy using chocolate...YUCK! But also because some of the cheesecakes are seasonal and I apparently don't go enough to have eaten them all.  But I am working on it! POWER TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!
Kevin Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",310,15,1,5.0,2/5/2016,Lamar is the best waiter. Lamar is the best. Best is Lamar. Lamar needs to be promoted to manager. Please promote Lamar. Lamar is the best waiter in the world.
