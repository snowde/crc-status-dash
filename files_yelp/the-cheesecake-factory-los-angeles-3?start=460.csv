Jane B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,15,16,5.0,4/19/2014,"Food is great. Quite pricey. THE CAKES AND DESSERTS are just...absolute heaven in your mouth. We bought a chocolate and oreo cheesecake from them and it was just yummiest cake i've ever tasted. It was sweet but not too much. You can taste the rich chocolate and the cheescake together. The oreo part of the cake isn't crushed. They're still whole (picture provided).  Oh and their receptionists are nice as well. I don't know about you but for me, the receptionist part of a restaurant is very important. The service is busy but they are attentive and not rude."
John D.,"Peabody, MA",0,30,1,1.0,4/10/2016,"I'm never eating at this Cheesecake Factory ever again. To the older Hispanic waiter with the Red Tie last night, you were the absolute WORST server I've ever had. Never once asked what drinks we wanted and after bringing me the wrong food order, he tries to tell me why he's right and I ordered my food wrong... Ok. He then tells us he's going to leave and someone else is going to take care of us. The next thirty minutes, he's helping the people right next to us. This server was so rude, even when I told him it was my guests birthday. I have never experienced such horrible, rude service at the Cheesecake Factory. If you're a Server, for the love of God just fix your customer's order if YOU got it wrong and get rid of the ego! NEVER stepping foot in there again!"
Nicole B.,"Santa Monica, CA",724,576,391,4.0,11/6/2011,"I enjoy eating at the CF, especially at the Grove. However, there is always a crazy wait. I hate it. You can find seating in the bar after stalking people who are almost done!!  Yayy for red velvet cheesecake!!"
Sara-Fleur S.,"San Francisco, CA",257,208,66,5.0,11/30/2014,This place is amazing ! I only tried the cheesecakes and they were really good. The portions are huge so you can totally share and in that sense it is not pricy at all ! The classic one with the strawberry is awesome !
Chanel L.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",127,38,2,5.0,11/9/2014,Ok just have the red velvet cheesecake because it is amazing and totally worth how ever fat it might make you. Turtle cheesecake is an amazing runner up if you've already had the red velvet. Peach Bellini is also delish. Pizza is always amazing. Turkey burger is never good. Service is always pretty good despite how busy they are. I love to go here with my book and just read and have some dessert. I also love that it's at The Grove so I can go look around or shop afterwards or before.  Really really yummy. They would be totally lost without the cheesecake though.
.Elisa. Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",2358,236,1052,5.0,6/29/2014,"I give this one 5 stars because its more romantic. it is also in a commercial place(the grove), but they have a movie theater at the grove as well. So its great for a date night. movie and a dinner :) it has 2 floors and they have a beautiful balcony. the food is delicious with the same big portions. its very intimate and they take a little longer but the staff is friendlier. I love this cheesecake factory."
Thomas L.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,27,102,4.0,9/4/2014,"I was shopping with K, all of a sudden, we saw this famous Cheesecake Factory. Without any hesitation, we walked in and had a wonderful lunch experience. I ordered the recommended chicken pasta with tropical smoothie and those were great! This place is nothing like that ""cheesecake factory"" in TBBT, but this is a nice restaurant ."
Anna S.,"Rosemead, CA",0,79,4,5.0,1/2/2016,"Aaron was our server last night and he was so nice and extremely attentive. My friends and I agreed that we haven't had service like his in such a long time. The food was amazing as well! The only down fall is because they're so busy, we waited about 2 hours to be seated."
Sarah A.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,34,3,5.0,9/5/2016,As always cheesecake factory did not disappoint. I enjoyed the club sandwich and my kids had pizza and a shrimp sandwich and the eggs rolls. Everything was delicious and service was prompt and courteous.  The best part of the meal was of course the cheesecake!  This time we had the smores and it was one of the best I have ever had!
Maisa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,39,24,4.0,3/1/2015,I've always loved the Cheesecake Factory. Just had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove it was amazing!
Karan S.,"West Hills, CA",2,7,,1.0,2/5/2015,"Extremely rude people! We were a party of 12 people and had called a couple of days in advance to reserve a table for dinner. They did not take any reservations and were not helpful at all with any suggestions.  We were asked to reach and hour and a half before we wanted to reach, so as to get a table. We reached an hour earlier than scheduled and were asked to wait for an hour more. Lady at the front desk was rude! We went upstairs to use the restroom and we see 3 tables totally empty! We asked to be seated there or at least be shown our prospective table, but we were out rightly refused. We simple wanted to smack that lady across the face as she was treating us like some unwanted POS.  We left immediately and walked across the Street to another restaurant. The loss is purely of this place and we will strongly dissuade our friends and family members from visiting this place, where the staff is snobby and arrogant, and treats large groups (the onez who fuel the revenue growth) with disdain! Shame on the management. Get a group of decent people at your restaurant. This is a service industry, where such an attitude will send you spiraling face down in NO time."
A B.,"Los Angeles, CA",103,22,13,5.0,2/2/2016,"Fantastic place and always impeccable service. We love coming here once a month for some seasonal events, as the area is so beautifully decorated. Highly recommended!"
Kristal L.,"Huntington Park, CA",4,17,6,3.0,2/3/2015,"Not what I expected, and the servings are so huge. I didn't even finish my food and I always have a big appetite but this time I was so full. My boy friend and I weren't pleased either. And the bread they serve as an appetizer is so dull. Despite the wait being an hour I really didn't enjoy the food."
Carmen C.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,24,42,5.0,1/31/2016,"i dine here alone a lot yet i always feel comfortable! the servers are always friendly, efficient, and courteous. the food is amazing! the dishes im posting are the chicken di pana and the grilled steak medallions. the grilled steak medallions are my favorite - part of the skinnylicious section yet has a larger serving than expected for a minimum amount of calories AND a small price! such a delicious, cheap, beneficial meal. also the cheesecakes are divine, of course. you can never go wrong by ending your meal w a slice. love this place and will keep coming back."
Chris G.,"Los Angeles, CA",97,155,26,5.0,10/12/2013,"If you're looking for a good happy hour look no further...wait maybe I want to take that back so it isn't so crowded.  Their happy hour appetIzers are good! You get the same portion size but for half the price. Same with their drinks. Where else can you get a good. Long Island for $5? (I'll give you a second) happy hour at the bar gets packed, so plan to get there early for a seat. Couple of TV's. the bar staff are cool as hell. Love Laylani!  Good spot to drop into before a movie, after shopping & when youre breathing!"
Roxanne B.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,79,387,4.0,8/11/2015,"Big fan of this location! I always seem to have the nicest waiters. The food is pretty standard for this chain. Nothing amazing, but consistent. The last time i went was on a Sunday evening, with a 35-40 minute wait. The longest wait time is probably Sunday afternoons after church gets out. I always see tons of elderly people with big church hats crowding around this place during ""brunch"" time."
Alex B.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,42,48,4.0,11/13/2014,Great food. A little pricey. But great! Don't go on friday/weekends nights - suuuuper crowded. Even if you booked a place in advance (or waited over hour like I did) a lot of people inside makes this place kinda cheap dinery place feeling.
Jacob R.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,83,21,3.0,8/13/2015,"I usually like coming here, but I guess it wasn't a good day. I came and they told me 30 minutes. The buzzer never rang. I could've took it home with me forever. When I went back I was next and I didn't like the seating. I felt a bit uncomfortable, and there's a mirror so it's awkward looking at myself and people beside me watching me eat. I really liked the waiter, he was a good guy. Come early if you wanna eat here. I once came here and they told me I had to wait a long time. I decided to watch Ant Man at the Pacific Theaters and the buzzer didn't even ring after that. Definitely make a reservation before coming here. Basically what I'm saying is that you could die and reincarnate and the buzzer still wouldn't  ring"
Zochi F.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,543,867,4.0,8/18/2013,"I've gone here twice within two weeks  First visit, was ok. The front lady didn't want to accommodate my party of 6. Told is it would tale 3 hours to get a table. I don't understand why they can't have two tables together or nearby. It's not rocket science! Second visit, our server, Marisol was the best! So sweet, helpful and attentive! I was impressed with her service. Because of her, I'm ready to come back and just ask for her.  Food is outrageously enormous.  I ordered a lunch size Chinese chicken salad and I really believed they had given me the regular portion.  So you do get what you pay for. Food is generously enormously large. But so good!"
Loraine S.,"Corona, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2014,Do not recommend to go here. As I walked in the hostesses were not paying attention to any guests entering I approached the counter and they were too busy talking to each other.  The wait was suppose to be about an hour hostess asks for a phone number and never repeats it to see if she got it correct.  After an hour and a half of waiting I decided to leave two and a half hours later still no text letting me know my table is ready I will definitely not be attending this place again.
