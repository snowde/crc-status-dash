Miranda W.,"Carson, CA",0,1,2,1.0,2/5/2017,"I have been fan of the Cheesecake Factory for some time now, but this location is simply the worst.  To start of, when our buzzer went off (after an hr long wait), our table was not even ready yet.  4 of us ordered the chicken bellagio, 2 ordered the four cheese pasta, and one ordered a flat bread.  We all received our chicken bellagios and four cheese pastas but we still had to wait for the flat bread.  My chicken bellagio had virtually no pesto sauce.  The noodles looked like they had just been cooked and left plain.  10 minutes passed and we didn't see our waiter once.  We finally had to ask another waiter about the flat bread.  He said that our flat bread had been dropped but whoever dropped it didn't tell our waiter and our waiter went on break.  Ok, really?  This place needs some help in the communication department.  We had to wait another 15 minutes for the flat bread which was finally brought back by our original waiter who apparently finished his break?  This place is a hot mess."
Jane Q.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,11,,1.0,7/5/2014,3 stars for food but the service was so appalling I can only give one star. I would strongly recommend avoiding this place if you want to have a dining experience that won't leave you wishing you'd just stayed in. Rude waiter and even ruder food runner.  I'm sure not everyone has this kind of experience but I'll certainly not be coming back and I would warn everyone against it too.
elina s.,"West Hollywood, CA",1080,4,,5.0,8/20/2015,"I love the Cheesecake Factory at the grove. they have a selection for everyone. even the pickiest diners with their low calorie menu. this place has the best ambience, food and service."
Kevin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,15,8,3.0,12/20/2015,"Ok I understand that there is a lot of people here during peak times but how do you not understand ""5 people plus a baby"" ? There were 3 people at the front desk and they completely ignored what we said and made us wait an extra 30 minutes past the 45 minutes of original wait time. All because they thought we had 5 people but we had 6 and firmly told them this multiple times, great food and servers but lack of service quality and organization in front desk."
Lexi J.,"West Covina, CA",1,10,3,1.0,6/26/2015,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! HAIR IN FOOD! My mother and I went here to eat. Hostess asked us our name so she could write it down since it was a ten minute wait. I began to spell out my name and mid sentence she cut me off and asked me to be seated. We went across the way to kill 10min when we came back she was chatting with a hostess. She seated everyone else who came AFTER us then seated us. We ordered.. my food was given to another table by accident.. Chef came out and apologized said it would be out in a minute.. 15min later I get my plate with a HAIR in the middle. Asked to speak to the manager all she said was ""oo sorry"""
Bita P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",184,230,405,4.0,7/31/2014,"This cheesecake is a great location with a cute balcony seating. Love it for brunch, lunch and dinner. The drinks are great with lots of great choices. There is pages and pages of menu for any taste with large portion of salad and pastas. ... And finally the dessert... If u manage to save room, it is a definite must try. Of course I won't forget their yummy fresh baked warm breads. Hint: get balsamic vinaigrette dressing as bread dip."
Chel R.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",14,706,4505,3.0,7/21/2012,"I grew up in LA.  Hollywood.  Moved to the suburbs after highschool. This is the first time I have been to the Grove.  Yes.  Seriously. Its a tourist thing to do.  Visit.  Take pictures around here. Its crowded which doesn't impress me one bit.  I hate crowds. The restaurant is just like any Cheesecake Factory out in Brea or Redondo Beach.  You wait.  And wait til your buzzer notifies you  that you may be seated.  I hate that.  I really dislike waiting.  Can you tell? Well I do.  So.... Anyway,  its not always the food or where I grub.  Really.  Well NOT  always. Its the company I am with. Today I was with my BFF.  I have known her since i was 10 yrs old. Cheesecake Factory got lucky today.  We ordered plenty.  Why? Idk. Tuna tataki and chinese chicken salad. Pasta Da Vinci Papas Bravas Crab bites Excellent service made up for the 25 minute wait to be seated."
Fanny R.,"Bell Gardens, CA",12,11,4,4.0,6/4/2014,I would have gave it 5 stars but the reason was that their Strawberry Martini was $11.98 that is pretty outrageous.  I ordered Chicken Madeira and my husband ordered a Factory Burrito. Let me tell you that burrito was massive (Monster burrito) and he loved it. he just didn't finish it. **Make sure to ask how much is the booze. lol
L T.,"Inglewood, CA",0,21,2,2.0,7/29/2015,"Last Saturday I went to this particular Cheesecake Factory, because it was between my horse and the venue that I  had just left.  My food was pretty decent, although I was damned near starving. I was really feeling a Hemingway Daiquiri, they don't serve them and what killed the evening was that bartender didn't even attempt to find out what the ingredients were so that he could look it up and make it. Learn something new.  Lazy bastard.  Really POOR customer service."
Bonnie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,45,22,4.0,4/27/2015,"We have been here about 6 or 7 times and I wouldn't slate the place, the place is lovely, well decorated, the staff are lovely, attentive and so forth. You expect a wait, and a longer wait for outdoors. Just accept that as it goes with the popularity of the place. We still like it here and will continue to return but there are some niggles and it's not always 100%....for one, they have an awful noise problem inside, one that I'm not even sure they are aware of. We sat inside on Sunday night and it was awful, we were almost shouting our conversation to each other, the racket caused by staff clattering knives and forks was deafening as was overall staff noise. It reminded me of a school canteen. The music was much lower on the decibel list than the staff and kitchen noises flooding out and even drowned out customer chatter. Not a pleasant noise. Especially not a nice noise To try and sip a nice Malbec in! There is a time issue too as we have twice still been eating starters when hot mains come out? Who wants to sit watching $30 of main courses go cold?....Also, I don't know why they feel that it's a nice idea to leave a gap of 4cm between tables for 2, it was ridiculous, we were a 2 but almost a forced table of 4, which was uncomfortable, but this shouldn't have to be pointed out, lastly the whole bill nonsense coming far earlier than you want it is just rude, annoying, interrupts conversations, puts pressure on the customers to leave and if they have a $40 near full bottle of red sat in front of them it's not nice. I feel sometimes that the real acid test is that the manager goes in the restaurant and sits like a customer and sees and hears and feels what they do, it's a test which I'm sure would always see changes. We received the bill without asking for it with a lot of wine left in our bottle and she brought the bill and said ,no rush sir, but there is, always is, as we continued to talk she came back and picked up the empty wallet, interrupting us again,we apologised saying we hadn't done it yet..... We stopped our conversation yet again at a point we hadn't planned, he ruffled through the wallet.... Just a rude interruption, there is clearly a rush, they hover around, watching for cards going in wallets, you feel uncomfortable, rushed and after paying we put some cash tip under a glass after getting our card back and we were interrupted again with a snatch of the cash and her saying 'I'll get that out of your way sir, .........it wasn't in our way? I can understand it when they need tables, both times there were many spare tables so it's just their practice I suppose. Saying all that, All the food seems to come out well, we especially love the Thai chicken wrap starter using lettuce leaves and triple Chinese style sauces. Most of the startrpers we have tried and we love, the small Greek salad is especially tasty. We really hated a dish of strawberry shortcake last week where a soggy super large biscuit was placed floating in red sugar syrup, served with equally marinated in sugar syrup strawberries with ok ice cream and a huge amount of cream to give it the ridiculous effect of a tower......not nice in so many ways,sickly, ridiculously too large and soggy and sugary."
Kas M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,121,149,3.0,10/16/2014,"The wait wasn't long probably because we went on a Wednesday night around 7pm. We didn't wait longer than 15 minutes. I ordered the chicken enchiladas, they weren't great, they could've been better. My boyfriend wasn't too thrilled about the shrimp scampi, the strawberry lemonade was wayyyyy to sweet. But the ambiance is welcoming."
Tyson A.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,45,15,1.0,6/25/2015,Horrible wait and disorganized had people that checked in after us go ahead . ...finally got to table and were in a row with 5 empty tables that seat 4 just made us more mad ..better off checking out other italian restaurants on beverly blvd  waiter was ok just chg out that front staff or get them trained and orginized cause in this town we are on run and need good service and not be told 15 mins and wait 45 ..
Winston C.,"Milpitas, CA",9,7,,2.0,3/1/2016,"Bought 2 slices of cheesecake that came out to $17.33. I should've checked the price before because I aint a baller..the cheesecake was ok, you really can't mess it up."
Kiersten F.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,37,4,5.0,11/13/2015,"So I've been to many cheesecakes and always love the food but what makes me really want to write this review is our server. Ryan was so friendly and attentive and seemed to go out of his way to make us happy. As a server, I love writing reviews giving deserving people recognition. Ryan is so more than deserving especially considering we heard the table behind us giving him such a hard time. They practically seemed to be yelling at him, and not only did he keep his cool but still tried SO hard to do what he could to make them happy. I really hope this store knows what they've got in this guy. I wish he worked with me!"
Bea D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,2,4.0,7/17/2016,"Just ate here today for my early bday celebration. For appetizer, we got some buffalo wings and We got the factory combination which is steak diane and shrimp scampi as the main course. The buffalo wings took forever before they gave it to us so our server Kelly was very sorry for the very long wait and gave us a comp for that. Not only that, the manager and server Kelly gave us a comp for whatever dessert we would like. I didnt really get mad foe qaiting becuause I understand that they are always packed. But shoutout to KELLY for she was the best server ever. :)"
Mrs. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",811,4,,5.0,8/24/2015,"The wheat bread, pasta, and cheesecake. Nothing more makes Mrs. L more satisfied. I'll gladly use my cheat meal for this joint. -Mrs. L"
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,4.0,10/17/2012,"KAHLUA COFFEE CHEESECAKE. Get it with a glass of milk. LONG ISLAND ICE TEA only $5 before 6. Glad I waited half past the hour before dessert so the long island could take effect first. Really, the simpler the dessert the more delicious. Also, the complimentary bread rules!"
Nicole D.,"Carson, CA",171,60,122,4.0,9/22/2015,BIG MIKE OUR WAITER is so awesome. He gave fantastic customer service. He made my first time visit at this Cheesecake Factory location a happy customer.
Nathan N.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",104,3,,1.0,1/4/2015,"I came to this Cheesecake Factory at 12:20 AM and the door was locked despite the fact that I was told they would seat me up until their closing time which is 12:30 AM. Not only that, but the man at the front behind the door was extraordinarily rude about it.  After a previous visit, I opened my leftovers at home and found macaroni and cheese which no one in my party ordered!"
Celina C.,"Carson, CA",7,27,28,5.0,6/15/2016,love love love the cheesecake factory never disappointed great food and good service I love ordering the cajun chicken littles with a side of ranch!!! despite that i had gone on a friday night we didn't have to wait to long. was attended within 35 minutes which sounds like a lot but it isn't much considering its the cheesecake factory and it is at the grove
