Mychaell O.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,5,1,3.0,1/22/2016,"I wish I could have given more stars bcuz the food was delicious, but our waiter was horrible!! We ordered strawberry lemonade for drinks and not once did he offer any refills which are free by the way.. he didn't check on us once after he brought out our food.. we had to wait till he passed by for the check.. as I was about to ask him for the cheesecake menu he was already bringing us our check.. it would have been nice to have a waiter who was a little more attentive especially bcuz it wasn't even that busy.. if we go again we will be requesting a different waiter"
Kency A.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,7,,5.0,1/21/2016,Went here last night for dinner with my Gf. It's not a five star restaurant but the food is good. We were seated quite quickly since there was no wait. Seems like the best time to go is late evenings during the week. I had the habachi steak which I've never tried before. Great flavor and well cooked. Our waiter was attentive and took care of us. Quick dinning experience overall good impression
Max G.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,55,1,3.0,9/17/2015,"Peh. Been here twice and not really impressed. Nice atmosphere, food is ok, just like other locations. Service is very slow though and not that friendly. Good location, nice outdoors patio hence the extra 2 stars."
Michelle B.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,9,8,5.0,7/2/2015,"I always love coming to The Cheesecake Factory! Their food is delicious and they have such a big menu! Lot's of different types of food and oh, the cheesecakes!! I've been to The Cheesecake Factory a couple of times now but last night was my first time at The Grove. I really like that restaurant and I look forward to going back there:)"
Samantha P.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",2,11,1,4.0,8/24/2013,"This is a good place to go to for casual dinning and if you have special occasion to celebrate. We had chicken & shrimp jambalaya & their special big  chicken burrito both were good. Also, I had 2 sangria's, I would not get them again, the fruit wasn't fresh and it tasted like it was just thrown together...BLAH!  Sangria is suppose to be made over night so all the juices of the fruit & wine have time to marinate together this 100%%% was not! Now the fantastic cheesecake TOASTED MARSHMALLOW SMORES TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW FANTASTICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC"
Eldon H.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",17,41,437,5.0,6/3/2014,"Want to indulge in delicious food? Want to have delicious cocktails? Want to have decadent desserts? This is the place for you. Yes, it's a chain, but still a good place to eat after a movie or just for brunch. I've tried almost all of their cocktails and can't really decide on a favorite. When the server comes to the table, ask him to not bring the sour dough bread and you'll get the most delicious and warm bread you'll ever eat. Sprinkle it with a bit of salt and pepper after buttering it and you'll see why."
Stephanie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,49,3,2.0,9/16/2014,I don't like the food here. Weird taste (both on meal and on dessert). One star back for the tasty bread.
Jessica W.,"Alhambra, CA",2,90,187,3.0,7/23/2013,"It was my first time going to The Grove yesterday with my cousin and a friend. We decided to eat at The Cheesecake Factory for lunch. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes with blueberries and the strawberry fruit smoothie. I thought that the pancakes had too much blueberries in them which made it a bit too sweet. The smoothie was good though. We ordered the ultimate red velvet cake cheesecake to share at the end of our meals. We all thought that it was too sweet so we didn't like it that much. The waiter we had was nice, friendly, and professional."
Rick S.,"Richland, WA",108,26,73,3.0,9/6/2014,Excellent food.  Great quality well prepared.  But is painfully slow on services and food presentation.  Could score higher
Alex A.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,125,318,4.0,9/15/2012,"I can never remember which dishes I've tried here...but the ones I can definitely remember and love are their cobb salad with balsamic dressing, thai lettuce wrap, crabcakes, avocado eggrolls, da vinci pasta, jambalaya pasta, lousiana pasta, and shrimp and chicken gumbo. Also, who can resist their complimentary bread, right?! anyways... cheesecake factory is always a good place to go for Italians and nice atmosphere"
Joyce S.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,167,36,4.0,8/14/2014,"Food was meh. Bf and I decided to get something different than what we usually get, so he got the grilled rib eye steak (medium rare) and I got the tuscan chicken. he enjoyed his steak, but I was a little disappointed :/  The dish had asparagus, capers, tomatoes and this sauce all over, but the chicken itself was very bland...... It wasn't awful, I was just expecting more flavor. However, the complimentary bread was spot on, as always. Erick, our waiter was so nice! He was very attentive, wasn't overbearing, and came at the right times. Service was A++ Wait time of 40 minutes, but got called in 30! it does take a while to get the food though."
V H.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,36,105,3.0,4/28/2014,Food is ok. The music is sooooo depressing. Makes you want to reach for the razorblades~ it's funerial! Service is super slow~ actually inconsistent. Two people left because no one came to their table for half an hour. I guess you have to individually ask for water because they brought my sister one and none for me. Waiter is a nice guy but didn't even notice he served me a dirty mug with a hair in it ~ Someone please change this morose music!
David Y.,"Beverly Hills, CA",67,103,65,5.0,5/10/2015,"The service is great, for some reason anywhere you go on a Rick Caruso property you are just served much better. The waiters and waitresses are extra nice and professional. It's in a great area (at the grove) so you can walk around and have a good time while you wait to get seated (there's usually a 15 minute wait). The food is great for the price and definitely fills you up. I would rate every other cheesecake a 4 but because of the venue and service this ones definitely a 5."
Helena C.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,56,6,3.0,7/28/2015,"Three stars for our first server and the food. My boyfriend and I went to eat lunch their today and we were seated within 10 minutes. Our server came and introduced himself and told us he will be helping us until our server got back from his break. He was awesome!!! I wish we could have had him the whole time. When the regular server came back we were ready to get our check and leave already. We sat for 15 minutes. He first came and waited on a table and took their order, put their order in, cleared the table next to us appetizer plate, went and put the dishes away, then he was walking towards somewhere else without even checking on us! Mind you we didn't have any silverware in our hands since he had been back from his break. My boyfriend had to flag him down. I told my boyfriend I was very annoyed and he told me to just not give him a tip. I'm a strong believer that everyone should be tipped. I left my first no tip today and I don't feel one bit bad about it. I would put the servers name in this review but I'm hoping he sees it and knows I'm talking about him and straightens up his serving."
Sarah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,97,101,1.0,8/7/2014,"Put our name in for a table.  Was told 15 minute wait.  We repeated, ""15?""  After confirming we sat to wait.  30 minutes later we went to check and is told by the host that the wait is FIFTY minutes and we still have 20 minuted to wait.  Okay.  BUH BYE! Been to this location several times since I can walk here.   Service can be slow.  I've tolerated it.   But not anymore.  It's the straw that broke the camels back."
Zoie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",2279,807,1539,3.0,8/8/2012,"Bordering on 3.5 - 4 stars. I feel like I can't exclaim ""I'm a fan!"" because the food wasn't knock my socks off to die for. It was yummy - but I wouldn't scale any cliffs to get at it. I came with my boyfriend and we had the lunch special (turkey sandwich, green salad, and soup of the day) ($11ish), the Shrimp dinner (6 pieces of large shrimp, fries, and cole slaw) ($16ish), a strawberry lemonade ($4.50), and a Guinness ($5.50). We also chowed down on some of that delicious complementary bread they have. Even though the lunch special is supposed to be 'smaller' (a half sandwich) it does come with a full bowl of soup and a nice portion of salad. This alone was tooooooo muchhhhhh foooooood. Honestly, the sandwich and the soup would have been plenty. The soup of the day was a lentil based soup and it was super yummy! The green salad had a nice vinaigrette dressing, however the sandwich was just turkey and a slice of tomato and was easily forgettable.  The shrimp was nice and juicy. The sauce that came with it added a nice kick that was cooled with the tartar sauce. This meal was huge and I think that the boyfriend and I could have been very content just sharing that.  Service was okay. He was friendly and there when needed. Nothing to really write home about.  I should have tried the cheesecake but I always order too much damn food here to ever get around to desert. Next time I'm just going to order the soup and a big fat slab o' cake!"
Mehrnoosh D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,5.0,3/2/2016,I generally am a fan of Cheesecake Factory. I love the location of this place. They have always a delicious food. I came here twice for lunch last week and it was really great. The service was good too. I'm happy yelper for this place and I will come back soon.
Daina M.,"West Hollywood, CA",719,54,159,4.0,6/14/2014,I was there a lot of times and in several locations. Cheesecake factory is a good restaurant with pretty big portions for a person. The only thing is that you have to wait a lot to be seated during the weekend.
Mrs. Stephany L.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",37,30,57,2.0,4/9/2015,I came for a dinner party of 9 my husband myself & my daughter. I asked could they clean up an end table closest to the party we came with. I was told No & to wait a while for a small table from the patio by a manager by the name of Holly a short Caucasian women. I smiled and sat. However I was very very upset with my service and surprised. I come here all of the time I've NEVER had a problem. I love the food and the drinks are amazing but I won't be returning to this location.
