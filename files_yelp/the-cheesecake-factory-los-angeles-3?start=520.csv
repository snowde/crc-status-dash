Julia M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,15,1,1.0,6/14/2015,"The heavy, creamy, fatty food here gave me diarrhea for 3 days straight. I was on the toilet 4 times a day for those 3 days, causing me to develop a hemorrhoid. Never again will I get the Pasta Davinchi. Only come here if you have a stomach and intestines of steel.  The fat content of this food will knock out even a sumo wrestler.  Thanks Cheesecake Factory for the hemorrhoid and extreme pain! Highly appreciated."
Richard L.,"San Diego, CA",55,9,1,4.0,4/13/2015,Came in with a party of 8 and they wanted to seat is in a booth. We weren't really digging that so we asked if we could get an open ended table. We were told if we wanted a table like that we would have to sit at 2 different tables. At that point I decided to go have a look around. As I stroll through the restaurant checking out the scene I see a whole section of tables wide open. So I say to the host hey  can we sit here. Long story short after being told no we can't. They ended up seating us there. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Our whole party of 8 works in the industry and were up visiting from San Diego. We were all impressed and beyond satisfied with the food and drinks as well as the service. Our Server James was a true professional and The Cheesecake factory is lucky to have him. If you come in ask for James you won't be disappointed.
Serhio S.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/3/2015,"I know that everybody loves it, but one thing I would like to highlight - service is very quick. So if you have no time to wait - do not hesitate - you will have your delicious food quickly."
Emma T.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,62,339,5.0,2/9/2014,"OMG I could never say enough good things about this Cheesecake Factory.  The wait is always 45 minutes or more,  however truly worth the wait and we always meet nice people here and the waiters are all friendly, kind and professional.  Treat Yo Self! BTW ORDER THE MANGO CHEESECAKE AND TAKE ONE TO GO, Lol"
Katie H.,"Hoover, AL",1,6,1,1.0,10/5/2014,My water was delivered to me with dried food bits on the inside of the glass and a soapy film on the surface of the water. It was absolutely DISGUSTING and unacceptable. After politely informing the manager I was offered a meager insincere apology. Won't be coming back.
Celtic M.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,156,23,5.0,7/15/2014,"Update: The Cheesecake Factory called me and apologized for our experience and invited us back. Although the woman from the corporate office was a little pushy, the manager from the restaurant was awesome! I guess we just hit them on a bad day because we went back and it was a great experience.  I really appreciate them making the effort to make everything right. Revising my review because of the excellent follow up from them.  Really disappointing visit. I usually love the Cheesecake Factory and this visit was awful. When the bread came out we noticed the napkin on the bottom of the bread was wet and turns out was soaked in coffee. Also the bread had coffee on it too. The waiter brought out new bread.  The waiter didn't refill the drinks and we had to ask multiple times to get ketchup and mayonnaise. The shrimp was not peeled and the food was pretty bad overall.  Since it was our 8 year anniversary it was an incredibly disappointing experience. This is probably the first time I have been disappointed with the food and service for Cheesecake Factory.  I don't think I will come back after this visit as this restaurant is not cheap and I expect better service and food.  I am really surprised."
Tina I.,"Hemet, CA",273,122,387,1.0,12/2/2013,"Ordered a whole cheesecake for my birthday party. Picked it up at 12pm & served it at 8pm, still frozen. They gave me a frozen cheesecake. I asked, when I picked it up, if there were any special instructions but they said no.  It wasn't like an ice cream cake. A frozen cheesecake is like a rock. Very disappointing as my guests could not eat it (though they made an attempt to lick it like a Popsicle.)  Also disappointing as silly me actually thought they made their cheesecakes fresh there.  Wrote a letter to the manager who sent me a generic letter. My name or date wasn't on the letter. There was no explanation. Just a generic letter they print out and mail. No sincerity. And a gift certificate, which was nice. Never doing that again. Whole cheesecakes are expensive! Not only that, I had to take time off of work to pick it up. Would have been cheaper and easier to just get a Trader Joes cheesecake and cover it with strawberries. I was so disappointed."
Amber B.,"East Lansing, MI",139,42,5,3.0,9/1/2015,"The restaurant is in a great location, kept clean and the food was pretty good. The staff was hit or miss. The host was awesome but our waiter wasn't very good and didn't know the prices on a thing and when he did give a price, he gave the wrong one. He hardly ever checked on our table."
Lisa L.,"Torrance, CA",191,235,325,5.0,6/6/2014,"Awesome food. Great happy hour prices too. Service is fast, friendly and always with a smile. Even if you're just there for a drink and an appetizer, the great staff treats you like they're appreciative that you're visiting. They don't brush you aside because you just ordered $15 worth of food and then you're done. Whenever you're at the Grove, most definitely visit. Theirs always room for cheesecake."
Eric H.,"Corona, CA",214,125,37,5.0,8/5/2014,I know this is a chain restaurant but it is my favorite chain restaurants every time I order anything I know I will always like it plus the price point is very good and worth every dollar I always the fool and sometimes even a to go box the service is excellent and the Decour is kind a like a new Egyptian style
Karreno A.,"Los Angeles, CA",723,514,2043,5.0,10/27/2010,"Me Like some Cheesecake!!!  I love going to this place, as every time I receive a phenomenal service and fantastic food.  One of my favorite dishes, the Orange chicken with mashed potatoes, never gets to disappoint me, no matter what time of the day it is.  On top of that.. you add white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake, and you're set for the rest of the the day.  The staff is very friendly and attentive, and they make sure to take each and every one of their customers.  I have thanked the management team for their continuous excellence in customer service."
Susan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,236,988,4.0,1/3/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is Cheesecake Factory --- you know what I mean if you've eaten at one or another location once or twice.  I almost never try to go to the Grove's location because it is always packed! People are always waiting and spilling out of the doors. Unless I'm grabbing a slice of cheesecake to go or slipping in to use the ladies' room, you won't find me there during dinner. My group decided they wanted to dine here at 6pm on a super busy evening. I was delighted to learn they can take your cell phone number and text you when your table is ready! I was excited about this and overcame my grumpiness about possibly having to endure waiting because we were able to walk around the stores while we waited for our table. They gave us an estimate of 30 minutes (and I thought... with all these people waiting here? Yeah right!)... and it was actually about 40 minutes when I got the text. Acceptable! We sat on the outdoor patio which was nice except for when The Grove started pumping the fake snow (aka soap bubbles) and it started drifting onto our food. Foodwise, having previously worked across the street from a Cheesecake Factory, I have the usuals I always order. This particular night, I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad. That thing is like something you can bring to a party to serve 10 people. I'm used to the lunch portion so the dinner portion was just a mountain of deliciousness. I only finished 1/3 of it before being stuffed. Other usual favorites: Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club (without bacon now since I don't eat pork anymore); Cajun Jambalaya with Brown Rice (instead of pasta); Chicken Masala; Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Veracruz; Vietnamese Summer Rolls; Avocado Egg Rolls... Favorite cheesecake: I'm a cheesecake purist so I love the original! On a wild day, I might order the chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. And their chocolate truffle cake is AMAZING if you're in the mood for choco-heaven."
Danny C.,"San Diego, CA",20,27,228,3.0,3/5/2014,This was my first time at this location but I have been to others. The customer service is okay here and so is the food. Nothing to rave about but I have had worse too. Come here if it is convenient or don't have other options.
Natalie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,15,40,2.0,11/13/2013,"GUESS WHAT?  THEY DON'T SELL CAKE @ THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! Why would anyone review The Cheesecake Factory? I mean, do people review McDonalds? Ok... ok, maybe it's not as mainstream as I think it is but let's take a quick look at the bell curve before I make my point: A) Outliers to the left are blurbing one liners because they have been paid/incentivized to opinion-ate in bulk.   B) Masses in the center are either truly pleasantly surprised or remorsefully aggravated. C) Outliers to the right are convinced their opinion matters and suffer from diarrhea-of-the-mouth, and therefore check-in to Yelp even when they visit aunt Sally's restroom.  Don't be offended.  I'm secretly trying to catch up to you.    Currently I'm a B.  With that said I am remorsefully aggravated.  My family and I decided to celebrate my stepfather's birthday at The Cheesecake Factory.  We are busy people.  Picking up a cake for any reason on a Thursday in the midst of our demanding lives isn't something we do.  So The Cheesecake Factory seemed like a no-brainer, right? One would imagine.   I thought my waitress would be impressed when I flashed my baller smile and said, ""We'd like to order an entire cake.  It's his birthday :).""  Turns out, ""Whole cakes are frozen but I'll check with my manager.""  Proceeded by, ""Yeah, we don't do that.""  Hmmmmmm.   So basically what I was subliminally told was:  1.) I can't offer you what you want, but I'm going to double-check and make sure what I've been trained to say is really true because it doesn't even make sense to me.  2.) Yes, we may have an entire display case of all sorts of cakes ready to go but we'd rather let them mesmerize the window gawking dieters than profit off of you.  Only Jesus knows why.  How does this story end?  Drinks thrown at the manger's face?  A vengeful dine and dash? No.  We gracefully ordered 6 variations of cheesecakes and asked the waitress to at least attempt a nice presentation.  Hopefully they'd figure out how to form a pie from six slices. Needless to say--they didn't.  Also needless to say, I'm smart enough to realize that kind of money can buy better service with or without an entire cake."
Cory B.,"San Francisco, CA",37,6,11,1.0,10/7/2014,"Love Cheesecake Factory!!! However watching the staff play around with the manager and hostess when people are waiting to be seated is unacceptable!  There was at least 20 empty tables on a Tuesday at 2:00 and I waited over ten min without being seated while watching the manager talk to the staff about his pen and laughing about stuff that was not work related. I walked out annoyed and ate lunch at La Piazza, where I was seated immediately. Get it together Cheesecake Factory!!!"
Lianne O.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",17,255,59,4.0,6/22/2014,"I've been there a few times and I've always had a good experience. My fam and I never wait long for a table even when they are crazy busy on the weekend. I always have a really good waiter that's attentive. The food we ordered was pretty good. I got the chicken maderia. For $18 I kinda expected it to look different. I don't know the look of it wasn't pleasing. The taste was ok. The mash and asparagus were delicious but something about the mozzarella cooked onto the chicken, wasn't that great. I also didn't like the oil that was on my plate. My food was in a little bit of an oil pond. Bedsides that, my experience is always great and so is the food. The cheesecakes are always sugary and delicious"
Emmanuel E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,,1.0,9/4/2015,"Called in today around 12:30pm to order a couple cheesecakes. It is my grandmothers 97th birthday. With the amount of time given you would think that's ample time for them to get two cheesecakes in a box. I went in 2:30 3:00 to pick them up, when I got home they gave me wrong cheesecakes. Wtf really?? For 90 dollars for TWO cakes they could at least get them right. Went back down there to pick up the right cakes and they didn't even offer an apology or anything. Never coming back ever, EVER again!"
Bethany K.,"Orange County, CA",102,597,106,3.0,8/11/2012,"Came here late after a movie next door and wanted to find somewhere for dessert. +1 for staying open til 12:30 on Friday nights! I hateeeee that Cheesecakes typically don't let you put in reservations, but b/c it was late (10? 11?), we had a really short wait. Not sure why they needed to give us a buzzer to wait 3 minutes, but it was whatevs. The hostess and hosts were pretty lackluster... not sure if it's because it was late at night and they were exhausted, or that's how they usually are, but I was unimpressed by their (lack of) friendliness. But, our actual waitress was friendlier and gave us her $.02 in what to order. We did the Tiramisu Cheesecake and the ... Chocolate Tuxedo? Something like that. They were both good! She mentioned her ""top 10"" so we asked her to tell us what was in it... and I felt like she started making it up after the first few, but she tried :)"
Perla S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",487,4,,3.0,10/28/2015,"Food was good, but service was very slow. A bit overpriced for you ask me. Wouldn't be my first choice."
Mohammed A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/18/2016,Bad management. Expect 1 hour wait if the host tells only 20 minutes wait. Disaster !!!
