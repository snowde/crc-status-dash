Kara P.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,393,36,4.0,4/16/2014,"Food - maybe something is wrong with me, but I like Cheesecake Factory a lot. Maybe it's because all the food is always exactly what I expect it to be...or maybe because it reminds me of my childhood. Not sure. Anyway, my faves include the salmon firecracker rolls with the yummy cabbage slaw, avocado egg rolls, Chinese chicken salad, and of course their strawberry lemonade.  Service - always busy, but attentive.  Final thoughts - it might not be worth the wait on weekends...but you can always try to grab a seat at the bar!"
robert g.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,32,6,1.0,11/9/2015,"I have to tell you I love Cheesecake Factory but this location is terrible. The last three times (literally) I took my friends for dinner, they have put meat into my vegetarian-ordered meal. Since we are on the way to the movies, there is never time to have them remake it. I simply watch my friends eat. Yes, they take it off the bill but what does that matter? I'm hungry! The managers that were there did not know what to do which made the matter even worse. I guess I just don't know how they can be so careless when it comes to their clients' dietary needs. They really blow it at this location! I'd recommend going to a different restaurant at the Grove. PLUS, why don't they share with us that almost every cheesecake has Halal beef gelatin in them?!?!?"
Ryan K.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",0,17,1,3.0,10/20/2015,"The wait was way shorter than anything else at the Grove during lunch time. I got the Cuban Sandwich and I HIGHLY recommend it. The wait staff was very irritating. Assuming our waiter was an out of work actor, I'm sure he's got to get his kicks somehow. Regardless, the food is worthy of the Cheesecake Factory expectations."
Qnarik G.,"Burbank, CA",4,31,2,3.0,9/19/2015,"I do not know guys....i am not a chain restaurant lover, and i go to cheesecake factory only for their herb-salmon...I took my friend for dinner to Grove and we chose the Cheesecake! well the wait is ok 15-20 min...but all cheesecakes SMELL...really they SMELL, you call it romantic darkness, i call it just DARK...thankfully we set outside, i only saw my waiter once when i was putting an order...that was it, food was ok...one of my hated things is ""HAPPY BDAY"" singing...please stop doing that seriously, i do not want to listen to that 3 time in  one hour...some people just do not like it...but also i understand that it is hard to demand more from this type of restaurants..."
Anton N.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",22,128,92,5.0,6/3/2014,Amazing pasta. I ordered chicken ramano with alfredo sauce and omg how delicious and juicy the pasta was. Hands down the best pasta i have tried yet.
Damien B.,"Los Angeles, CA",197,1,,2.0,8/15/2015,I waited way to long for a friends bday. We watched other tables get food before we got the food for the table I really like this place but was really disappointed tonight!
Erika S.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,4,23,5.0,9/6/2015,"My family and I had lunch here yesterday, it was a busy Saturday so we had to wait 25 minutes for a table witch is pretty long when your real hungry but as soon as we met our waiter DAVID the wait was forgotten, he was Amazing!! He took our order immediately was nice and really funny, it's awesome when your waiter is paying such amazing attention to you that you don't even have to ask him for a drink refill because it's already on its way, we have eaten Cheesecake Factory before many times but this time it was different because of David!!!"
Andrew G.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,145,12,2.0,6/28/2015,"The entire weekend staff members are basically out of their minds.  I hope the manager reads this to them.   Showed up on a Saturday, right when they open.  We were probably only the 2nd party to walk into the door... Basically it was empty.    Girl at front desk asks me the usual, ""how many?"", ""inside or outside?"", ""can I get your name?""... Then sends us up the escalator to the 2nd check in desk.  Again keep in mind no one is in the restaurant.  Also note: I asked to be seated outside balcony... More to come on this. Arrive at 2nd check in desk upstairs.  They ask me for my name.  I give it to them.  They check their computer to make sure I'm in the system.  I say ""they"" because it required multiple staff members to figure this out.  They look at the computer, then look back at me... ""andrew?"" (Well duh... Who else would I be? I just said my name... No one else is around... ) Someone new comes to take us to the table... And we follow... Only to arrive at a table inside... Not outside.  We told the staff that we specifically asked to sit outside.  The host looked confused and said they needed to go check at the counter to confirm the table.  (No clue why they can't just sit me at the table I want to sit at because the restaurant is literally empty except for one other party) Finally the host comes back to tell us they don't know what happened and we need to go back to the front counter to resolve the issue.  So, we walk back to the counter and the same staff members were still there.  Shit you not... They asked me for my name again.  I told them again that I specifically asked for a table outside on the balcony.  They confirm with the computer, all smiles, and tell me ""Right this way"".   Shit you not, they literally took me to the same table inside... Again.  So, I laughed, tell the host once again that this is not the table I requested and that I requested a table outside on the balcony.  Again.. Let me remind you that THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT.   So we are instructed to go back to the front desk to clear this up, again.  I know this sounds insane but it is all true, bear with me.   We arrive at the front desk and once again they ask me for my name.  Dear staff, my name is Andrew dammit.  3 people standing at the front desk this whole time and none of them could remember my name.  Anyways, they check the computer to confirm, again.  They still look confused.  So I tell them again, who I am, and that we are a party of 2, and we specifically asked for a table outside.  They seemed to have figured it out now and off we go. Just wait there is actually more.   We finally get outside and they showed me to our table.  This table was near the door, and since the restaurant was empty I saw no harm is asking to take a different table that was right against the middle section of the balcony.  Shit you not... The host literally said ""hold on I need to check to make sure that table is available"" and proceeds to call the front desk.  First of all... As all you Yelpers fully understand by now... The restaurant was f*cking empty lol.  2nd, I've tried making reservations at this location and they have explained to me they do not take reservations and therefore there is no possible way that the table we want is taken.  Without further ado, we get the table we wanted.  Oh, and it was broken.   Great food though.  Really great food."
Cindy S.,"New York, NY",67,55,23,4.0,1/20/2015,"It's the cheesecake factory. Of coarse it's good.  HUGE TIP: If your at the grove and its just two of you, skip the wait and sit yourself down by the bar or the round tables nearby it.  Much quicker!"
Eduardo F.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,13,10,5.0,9/1/2014,"You guys should come to this place,because besides their amazing variety on cheesecakes,they have really good food too.Their menu has so many choices.  All the people who work are vey attentive and nice. My girlfriend and I ordered a chicken and steak plate and it did not took too long to be served on our table. We definitely we are going to keep coming back at this restaurant,because every time that we ado, we enjoy it."
Buck R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,65,10,3.0,8/30/2015,"These guys are busy. The food is marginal, the 850 calorie cheese cake was ok, the service was slow but when the wait staff is running that fast and crazy, you gotta cut some slack. The Shepard pie (gluten free) was ok but needed hot sauce to kick not up otherwise it was just meh. The coffee was ok. If I didn't have a $50 gift card I never would have went"
Sara W.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,42,13,5.0,7/12/2015,"If you're not prepared to wait, don't come here. Because the place is so fantastic it's always packed and you'll always wait. Service is impeccable, there's a bit wIt for the food, but there's a reason for it, it's fresh, and very tasty. My husband and I keep coming here everytime we want great food and always expect to wait, today, Sunday at 4 we didn't have to wait and the place was packed. Highly recommend."
Lorraine I.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,16,,1.0,11/17/2014,"ATTENTION LADIES! if youre eating alone, be prepared to be treated like a second-class citizen. i was told id be on the balcony with a great   view.  when he showed me the table by the back wall with the only view being of peoples butts as they walk by,  i asked about another table that was empty and much more desirable . the restaurant wasnt at all busy, but i got told that because i was alone i couldnt sit there.    inside though they offered  me a booth for six, and when the waiter showed up he said ""so youre only getting dessert?""  HUH???? i came to eat but at that point i realized that as a solo female diner i was not welcome.      i had enough and asked to speak to the manager. he said i could sit anywhere i want. no thanks. i wont be returning.  shame on me for being at the grove and taking the extra few steps to the farmers market.     UPDATE: just read the other reviews. glad i didnt stay. the staff seems to hate people."
Dana R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",178,257,35,1.0,3/29/2015,Terrible service at this location.  Not your typical Cheesecake.   Even the Filipino/Asian manager was bad in handling our situation. They need a lot of training here!!
John S.,"Los Angeles, CA",635,117,186,4.0,10/3/2013,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove is an exception. The food was solid -- nothing too fancy, just like any other Cheesecake Factory -- and the service was adequate. Yet I'm giving this Cheesecake Factory 4 stars mainly because of its location.  Other than the Cheesecake Factory at Redondo Beach, which I have to say is a gorgeous location, the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove is just as spectacular. This restaurant is perfect for any youngsters out there who's looking to take a girl out to a nice place and not have to use up their entire life savings.  Overall this Cheesecake Factory isn't going to blow you away with their food, but if you're looking for a nice night out with your loved ones or friends then The Cheesecake Factory at the Grove should definitely be a strong option. To good eatings!"
Sara N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,116,57,4.0,1/31/2015,"The service is great, the food is wonderful specially the Miso Salmon and the Angel hair pasta with Shrimp....Ummmmm rico!"
Gil C.,"Bakersfield, CA",1,77,193,4.0,1/7/2015,Always a great place to dine was a little crowded .. the parking sucks buts it's la .. lots of store to shop at in the plaza it's located in
Daniel D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",113,3,,2.0,8/11/2015,"I asked for ketchup, the waiter said he'll get me one. Didn't get me one. I just wanted to eat my spam and eggs with some flavor, y'know?  At least I got water, so there's your two stars. And the utensils were pretty dirty."
Arjay J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1142,14,4,1.0,6/16/2013,"The experience was so unsatisfying, I didn't even stay due to poor customer service and racism. I came here on Father's Day expecting seating to be difficult, which it was, but understandable. I was told it would be about a 45 minute wait and accepted what I was told and left with the device that would buzz when a table should be ready I went outside to meet up with my family and let them know how long the wait would be, at which point, plans were to change as waiting wasn't a feasible option. And so, I went back to return the device I was handed, but was cut off by a lady. I didn't mind at the time because I had assumed she would have to wait anyway and I was just trying to return the buzzer. As I stood there, this lady was asking for seating for the same size party as mine and instead of giving her a buzzer to wait, they were immediately able to seat her! I was outraged and furious. Instead going to down the list to buzz someone who's been waiting of the same party size, the chose her instead, a white lady who just walked in. It's very offensive and very RACIST that they'd be given such exclusive service, especially since the waiting system is electronically systematic, leaving very little problem to find someone else who's been waiting to fill in the gap. The food here isn't bad, and for the most part, service is good, but the fact that something like that happened where most of what happens is already automated is unbelievable and could only happen with poor people skills and a lack of basic computing."
Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508,4.0,6/10/2012,"It's probably best to come here earlier than noon. We arrived at 11:45 am for lunch and were sat right away in the patio as requested. There were also plenty of seats inside as well. (As we were leaving, the place was so packed, there was a line outside the door waiting to put your name in). I think it's interesting that they have the check in downstairs and seating all upstairs. Escalators take you up and stairs lead the way down.  Service was good and attentive, he was very patient despite the fact that we were three ladies all together that just wanted to talk, he was always able to politely interrupt our talking to ask us questions and to ask if we wanted to order or if we wanted any refills.  Foodwise, I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. It wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite thing. Could have had some more marinara sauce on the side with it, that part was delicious. They have a skinnylicious menu also for the weight conscious out there. My aunt got a salad that she loved, although it appeared to be side salad sized at a full price.  Chocolate cheese cake was amazing as always. My mom got the regular cheesecake and that was also up to their standard. I love the cheesecake here.  Would definitely dine here again and would try something different. The best part about this place is the location, right in the heart of The Grove."
