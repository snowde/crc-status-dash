Bryden P.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,43,1,3.0,7/8/2015,"I had never been to the cheesecake factory. The waiter was awesome. I am vegan, he informed me of what had dairy in it and what didn't. Over all, the food was nothing special. However, The Whiskey Smash is probably the best whiskey sour I have ever had in my life. Pretty weird actually..."
Kristin C.,"Lancaster, CA",21,16,,4.0,3/18/2016,"I came here for dinner with a group of friends on St. Patty's Day. They seemed really busy but we were seated right away. I was really impressed with how well staffed they were.  It seemed like all the workers helped each other out. Our server was great, even with all the chaos she was so professional and took her time to make sure she got everyone's order right. We had some tough orders, as one of my friends had to make sure everything she got was gluten free and most of us wanted substitutions!  Nice thing is that they have several gluten free options for those with restrictions.  The interior design of the restaurant is impressive. They have a tall escalator to take you to the seating area, and they have booths by glass windows that give you a great view of the Grove. I saw them, but unfortunately we didn't get seated there. The food was tasty, I got the Crispy Shrimp Sandwich which was good. The portions are large as well. The only bad thing was that the lighting was so dark we couldn't really read the menu without using our phone flashlights. Other than that this is a great place for dinner. I guess the low lighting might set the mood for a romantic date."
Abtin M.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/25/2015,Wait was 45 min over what was originally estimated. Great food but they need better ways to give more accurate times.
Charlie B.,"West Hollywood, CA",87,65,18,4.0,2/25/2014,"Cheesecake Factory has amazing food and menu, no matter the locations I've be too. We do go to the Grove location often because it is close but we are always weary of how busy it is. Unless it's off peak hours don't ever expect a short wait. Lately we always just head straight to the bar area to try our luck. So far we've had decent luck and find a high table within 15 mins or so.  The last time I have to admit our server, was nice but he did an awful time of managing his time but most of the time our service is usually pretty good. So int his case I gave it four stars due to consistency and great food. They recently just added a chicken Katsura plate to their menu and it is fantastic, I've ordered twice in a row. If you don't like spicy food, just have them take out the siracha sauce. Can't ever go wrong with avocado egg rolls, my favorite. I also love the chicken Romano."
Yana D.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,4,,1.0,7/24/2015,"The worst location ever! I usually very satisfied with food, drinks and services at Cheesecake factory ( their herb crusted salmon is the best ). But at the Grove it was a disaster!!! 1st of all they forgot about us (system glitch as we were told) and we've been waiting around 1 hour to be seated. Then we've ordered apple martinis with cattle one vodka and I believe the bartender forgot to add any vodka not just the one we've requested. Tataki tuna salad that I usually order at other locations was much smaller and tasted not that good!! Won't go there again!!!"
Anna E.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,100,13,5.0,4/25/2015,Omg i loved this cheesecake! The best one I've ever been too. The interior is gorgeous. The service amazing. Me and my friends were around the area for the Armenian Genocide March. We were starving and were craving burgers so came here and it was amazing. I can't wait to come back.
Michael M.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,17,3,1.0,6/25/2015,The wait is ridiculous! You wait downstairs for the amount they tell you give or take and when you do finally get the text saying your ready to be seated you are sent upstairs to wait some more time. What kind of idiot thought that through. I wasn't the only one getting frustrated over this either.and on top of that there were people that got here after us being seated first. When we finally got showed to our seats the table wasn't even cleared or reset yet. If you want to eat somewhere where you can enjoy your food don't come here or at least not this location
Veronica H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,10,,1.0,10/14/2015,"I've frequented several Cheesecake Factory restaurants from various locations in and out of the state.  Typically, the food and service is good.  However, my family was in town and we were meeting family at the CF at the Grove, where we had never been, since I am fairly new in town.  Beautiful facility.  However, the service was less than average. They took forever to seat us and refused to sit us outside as we requested because as they told us we had a party of seven and it was a fire hazard to connect the tables.  We looked out and saw several tables that were close enough together in the same vicinity that still would have worked, but yet they continued to fight this.  Fortunately, a server came out, after close to 30 minutes of sending us back and forth, and told us it would be okay to sit there. She then actually pulled our tables together.  Another server came out to take our order.  He was nice.  It appeared that everyone ordered their food successfully..except me.  I was feeling under the weather and had a migraine, so I simply ordered a Chicken Caesar salad.  The salad came out soggy like it had been sitting for a while somewhere.  The dressing on it did not taste like a typical Caesar salad dressing.  It was also very bland and quite off putting and there wasn't much on the salad,  The chicken was definitely flavorless.  I eventually told another server who replaced the original guy I placed the order with.  He took it back and brought out another supposedly fresh salad.  At this point, everyone else had finished their food, so I asked for a to-go-box.  Initially, the lettuce appeared to be fresher and crisper than before.  Therefore, I took everything to go before eating again.  However, the chicken was rubbery, hard, and flavorless.  The dressing was lifeless and he only gave me one small container full, so it basically was only enough to cover a few top pieces of lettuce.  Also, the croutons were stale. Wow!!!  $17.99 for this salad?  Very disappointing!!!!  And really....How in the world can any restaurant mess up a simple Caesar salad?"
Sanaz R.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,16,3,5.0,8/17/2015,very good avocado roll. their portion is also very big. good customer service.
Angelica R.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",3,111,38,2.0,1/17/2015,Wow. That is all I can say. I came here with my boyfriend and sister in law and her husband. And we had to wait 1 hour 10mins to be seated after we got seated we had to wait forever for our drinks to come out. Our waitress was the most miserable person I have ever seen. She was rude and it seemed she hates her job. Our appetizers were deli and so was our food. But service was awful and the fact it was so busy I couldn't believe such thing.
Rebecca A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,8,10,1.0,7/18/2015,"I have been here 3 times...the first time it was okay service I guess...but the last 2 times have been horrible! The 2nd time...the waiter kept asking if we were sure of what we were going to order because he kept reminding us that it was a lot of food... DUDE LATINOS EAT A LOT FYI!!! That was kinda annoying...when we asked for the dessert menu he couldn't believe it! He literally mouthed ""oh my gosh!"" But okay...whatever gave it another shot today...there was an hr and 10 min wait cool whatever no hurry...we waited (there were 3 of us) finally after an hr and 15 min i get the text...ok we go in...then upstairs...we check in or whatever...and then another couple show up...then 4 people show up...they get seated first...and we're just standing there like wtf! I finally go ask the lady and she can't find me in the computer...WOW AMAZING! So then they finally seat us...honestly I don't know if I should even recommend this or not...food is delicious! But it's just the service..."
Juan P.,"Whittier, CA",1,14,,3.0,8/8/2015,Food was ok but the seating is way to close it was as if we were sitting with strangers at the table and listening to annoying conversation
Gaby L.,"Compton, CA",26,8,1,5.0,6/12/2015,"Great place to enjoy special occasions! Service was great!! Thanks to our waitress we had an amazing time, so thanks Wendii, F. for making our occasion a great one! She went beyond expected to make sure that our visit here was great ! Food was delicious and even though it was busy our food was ready in less than 20min!!!! If you plan to come here make sure to ask for Wendii to be your waitress, she is great !!!!"
Ashley B.,"San Diego, CA",23,53,2,4.0,8/23/2015,"Probably the nicest cheesecake factory in the area. You might have to wait to get a table sometimes if it's packed, but the food is just as good as all the other cheesecakes, and they have a balcony overlooking the grove. Love this place!"
Yemaya G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,4.0,7/31/2014,"Love the cheesecake factory, I get the four cheese pasta every time and it's literally to die for!  My only drawback is that due to its locations it's a tourist trap and for that reason is usually very boisterous and loud-- still love it though!"
Teresa F.,"Los Angeles, CA",448,7,3,5.0,5/13/2015,Ordered delivery through postmates last night and I couldn't be happier. The meat loaf was a huge portion with mashed potatoes and succotash. Everything tasted amazing! The mac and cheese was very good as well. Top it all off with a magnificent piece of cherry cheesecake. Thank you!
Andy T.,"Sun Valley, CA",35,5,1,4.0,7/26/2015,It was at lunch time took my laddie to eat and we had fun. They were not checking up on us very much to the point I had to ask for the check and then tell them to pick it up. But over all it was nice.
Shawnna J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/26/2014,I love Cheesecake Factory!!! I always decide to go here because they really have anything I crave for!! I usually go for the Miso Salmon and the Avocado Rolll! :-)
Meme M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,7/26/2014,Big fan of the place when you have guests from overseas. That is all they talk about before they arrive here from Switzerland.  The place is busy! Even at 4 in afternoon.. the average wait was about half hour.  We had a nice booth seat for the 5 of us and service was quick. This time we just had the cheesecakes and shakes. No meals. Perhaps next time when we have more time after meetings.
Joseph Y.,"Chatsworth, CA",4999,701,684,2.0,3/23/2013,"Cheesecake Factory's food is excellent, no matter where you go. This is a guarantee.  I usually order the grilled chicken avocado club sandwich with sweet potato fries and it is always made to perfection. My wife orders either the miso salmon or their luao salad and swears by them both. Our favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls that come with some delicious dipping sauce. As for the service at The Grove location. Terrible.There was a party of 8 of us and we were told 105 minute wait for lunch. After 120 minutes we started to get fussy and irritable. Still no table. After 130 minutes, we decided to find out what is going on. Turns out, they were readying tables to sit our party, but someone sat down a couple at a table and to their right was our tables and to their left, our tables. So basically, they sat down this couple that divided the tables that were being held for us. They didn't want to move the couple and instead were waiting for them to eat their orders, deserts etc. Well, that wasn't happening for us. We walked over to the couple and asked if we could move them over so we can get the tables together and they agreed. We explained to the Manager and the people doing the seating that making us wait was a terrible idea, silly at best and could of been resolved 30 minutes ago by asking the couple to just allow us to scoot their table over and let us bring the other tables around them so they can be consolidated. To make us wait a total of 143 minutes what plain crap. No one apologized, comped us anything or tried to make us feel better for such a long wait. Too bad it was my wife's birthday celebration and we wasted almost 2 1/2 hours just waiting for Cheesecake to get our tables ready. When we asked for a cake for my wife's birthday, they couldn't even have the common sense to bring a piece of cake with a candle on it! Common guys. I've never had any problems with any other location, but I think the volume of customers at The Grove along with the small Cheesecake Factory location was a bad combination. Really disappointed."
