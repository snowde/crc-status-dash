Edna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,14,2,2.0,7/20/2015,"The waiters did not really acknowledge us. We went when it was empty, but it took them around 45 minutes to serve us. When i asked for bread or a glass of water they kept forgetting to bring it to us. The service was not good, but the location and view was nice."
Sarah A.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,33,62,3.0,11/30/2014,"Just here for the light lunch, I order small appetiser n meal menu.. My Favorite so far is the chicken and mushroom lettuce wrap..good choice if u wanna watch carbs intake but I'm not on diet so i order crab bites too . The thing about this place is just too crowded n the people who work at the front table seems very depressed and waiting time for the table is kinda annoying because most of the time this place always busy (  during weekend ) so I recommend to make a reservation first."
Yana K.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,49,69,5.0,11/14/2013,Delicious!! This place is amazing! They have a huge menu filled with anything from salads to steak to deserts! No matter how many times I come here I am always satisfied and always come back for more. My absolute favorite is the chicken Tastada salad. I will definitely come back for more!
Bryant C.,"Los Angeles, CA",871,411,1124,5.0,7/3/2012,"This place can have pretty fast service during off-peak hours. During off-peak hours i get seated really quickly. However, weekend nights (Friday-Sunday), they get really busy and waits can take up to an hour for a party of 2.  Also, during those times, waiter service gets really slow as they have to deal with many other tables.  One time, our party of 8 had to wait over an hour to get our food served, which was really ridiculous.  My dad ended up talking to the manger, and he apologized, which I really appreciated. My go-to dishes are--  Appetizers: Spinach and Cheese dip, Avocado Egg Rolls, Sweet Tamale Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts (ask for honey mustard dipping sauce), Stuffed Mushrooms Entrees: Spicy Chipotle chicken pasta, Louisiana Chicken Pasta, Chicken Marsala, Crusted Chicken Romano, Thai Chicken Pasta, Miso Salmon Desserts: Tiramisu You can ask for extra sauce for the pasta entrees, which is really great.   I find that this cheesecake factory makes their dishes more flavorful than the Cheesecake Factory in Palo Alto (which is weird, considering it's a chain restaurant and you would expect them to have the same recipe at each chain). There is happy hour from 4-6pm on weeknights, ONLY if you are seated at the bar.  Happy hour features $5 appetizers and select drinks, which is a bargain!"
Bianca R.,"San Diego, CA",3,10,2,3.0,7/12/2015,When we arrived at the restaurant they told us to wait time would be 15 minutes but we had to wait 35 minutes. When we asked the receptionist how much longer we had to wait we got flat out ignored. When we finally got seated we got a table outside that was very shaky. It felt quite unsafe and uncomfortable to cut our food and eat at this table. Also the glasses to surf the water and seem to be very dirty. The quality of the food was all right
Rex R.,"Culver City, CA",0,6,1,5.0,6/12/2014,"Been here many times, always have had a pleasant experience. They are usually pretty busy all the time but especially Fridays and Saturdays. Wait can be as much as 90 minutes on a Fri or Sat night, but the outdoor shopping area of The Grove provides a lot to do. Plus they'll page you on the beepers when their ready for you. Food is always great, I've tried tons of stuff on the extensive menu, from Chicken Costoletta, to mahi mahi, even the Shepard's Pie is awesome. I always get the Strawberry Lemonade with the sugar crusted rim. Deserts are plentiful and all the Cheesecake are great. Great place for any occasion, big menu satisfies all. Don't forget to validate parking, its murder at the Grove."
A.J. C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,42,1,5.0,3/1/2016,"Tonight, I went to The Cheesecake Factory at The Americana in Glendale, CA and I was shown three poor tables.  Finally, I asked for a booth.  I was told that there would be a 15-minute wait, even though no one else was waiting, and there were dozens of empty tables.  I talked with Ashley, the Manager, who turned matters around instantly.  I was seated properly and promptly, and was told about their newest entrée, Chicken & Lemon Couscous.  After a salad, the chicken was divine.  I was most impressed what a great job that Ashley and Dimas did tonight to ensure the finest in customer service.  They saved the day.  Thank you."
Marvin Abdul Hasib S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1131,687,280,2.0,7/26/2013,"I havent been to Cheesecake factory since they first opened in Pasadena yeeeeeeears ago. But my coworkers had a dept lunch here a few months back, and i had to come. I ordered the meatloaf, with mac n cheese. Soooo the Meatloaf was very bland, and after salting, it was a bit better. The mac n cheese was very cheesy, but it wasnt tasty either.  Ummm... next time im sticking to cheesecake."
Marie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/6/2016,"Quite diappointed after frequenting this restaurant mant times at the grove  kitchen prepared the worst food. There were 3 of us and two sent their food back. Even the replacement food was inadequate and poor. Pizza over cooked and burnt. Replacement was not good actually came back same. My husband ran a restaurant for 20 years and never turns good back, but this pizza was awful. He said he wanted to turn it back again but we were there for 2 hours with all this awful food. The other food was chicken and couscous and the chicken was a hockey puck. Returned chicken was better but sauce was to much butter and separated and again needed to be returned. The manager, Angela offered us a salad, which we just ate ourselves to compensate for the poor food. I really cannot believe we were not compensated for the awful food or inconvenience in our check. You might rethink going to this location. Really disappointed we were celebrating a birthday and 47th wedding anniversary."
Shannon T.,"Bonsall, CA",22,26,21,1.0,5/3/2015,I haven't eaten at Cheesecake Factory in years. Well I was disappointed this time. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad. It was overdressed and very wilted. My husband ordered the broiled Gish tacos. These were really bad. The soft corn tortillas were hard and the fish was tasteless. Our cheesecake was delicious. Service was very slow. Super nice guy just he just seemed to be overwhelmed and struggled with our order.
Alexander S.,"San Diego, CA",126,11,1,5.0,3/21/2016,By FAR the best service I have ever had. Literally. Deqorrie was our server. Great guy!! Definitely will be back.
Jennifer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,4,1.0,4/8/2015,"Had the worst experience at this Cheesecake Factory.  First, we were overwhelmed by the strong smell of patchouli oil that one of the staff was wearing.  It was so bad, my friend told the manager about it.  The manager was apologetic and said she would say something to the employee.   We ordered our food - our waiter was great. Very nice and personable.  He walked away to put in our order. Suddenly, a woman and her young child are rushing towards our table - the woman has a napkin over the girls mouth, and the girl is vomiting into the napkin and on the floor.  A waitress points the woman in the direction of the bathroom and proceeds to cover the vomit on the floor with a few napkins.  Other wait staff did the same thing with the vomit path leading to the bathroom.   My friend and I watched as the wait staff walked over and slipped on these napkins, for almost 10 minutes. Finally, my friend tells one of them that they should probably clean it up properly before someone slips and falls.  Someone brought out a swiffer type dry mop and cleaned it up without soap and water. Not very sanitary for a place that serves food.  We received our food - teriyaki chicken and a turkey burger.  The chicken was ok, but the rice was under cooked and hard.  The turkey burger was bland and dry.  We didn't want to send any food back because at this point, we just wanted to get out of there.  Safe to say, I will not be going back to this location."
Airn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,74,52,4.0,9/1/2013,"If there's ever a time where you want total assurance that you're going to get great food, decent prices, and a superb waitstaff, save yourself the trouble and go to the Cheesecake Factory. The location at the Grove get busy, so plan ahead. Go in and pick up a buzzer before you're starving and by the time you get called, you'll be ready to eat. The buzzer has a fairly long range (from water fountain to the Farmer's Market entrance near Marmalade Cafe), so you can shop/window shop while you wait. Last night I showed up at 9:30 and waited 55 minutes for a table for 2! They don't take reservations so BE PREPARED! The seating can get crowded indoors, so opt to sit outdoors and take in the sights from the balcony.  The waiters are always great. Well versed in the menu, helpful when you're indecisive, never pushy, etc.  TIPS: + Don't order an appetizer unless you aren't getting an entree. They bring out fresh rye and sourdough bread for every table.  + There are lunch portions available for many of the entree's - always ask! + Dessert portions are ALWAYS big enough for two or three. The Lemoncello Cake is my fave but the Strawberry Shortcake is always a winner as well. + There are a couple of televisions above the bar. Last night they showed football and a Jeopardy rerun. :) One thing about this location that gets under my skin: there are only 4 stalls in the ladies room. Yep. That means that while there may be an excess of 70+ women here at any time, there's only room for 4 bums at a time. Madness! lol!"
Pat C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,51,1,3.0,10/4/2013,"Went here for my daughter's birthday dinner.  I am not a cheese cake person, but have always been pleased with the meals here.  I gotta say that the classic burger was good in size and taste.  A bit stingy on the fries, but..... The pasta, turkey club and chicken dish around the tattle were all praised.  But the two cheese cakes for dessert were the bomb.  Delicious and huge. Two serve four easily"
Dave M.,"Wexford, Republic of Ireland",10,35,,2.0,9/24/2013,"I'm a sucker for a pulled pork sandwich and it's funny, I'm not really a fan of pork other than when it's pulled, put in a sandwich and smothered in BBQ sauce. However, I may have problems ordering my beloved pulled pork sandwich if I get flashbacks to this experience. First of all the pork was not pulled, it was cut... badly. I'm not sure how fresh it was but another in our party who had the same thing was unwell for hours after eating it. I myself thought that the fast was a bit ""funny"".  The service was average at best, clearly the servers are over stretched and while friendly when dealing with us they were hard to get a hold of when we needed something... like the bill. We didn't stick around for the cheesecake and it's unlikely that we'll ever return to a cheesecake factory in the future. S"
Patrick B.,"Los Angeles, CA",161,398,4,3.0,1/11/2014,"This place is super popular.  This translates into a really long wait time.  Once you get past that, the menu is certainly an effort, as there are so many choices!!  You can have just about anything you want from fish options to omelets.. and everything in between.  It is a bit stressful trying to decide!!  Once you order, the food is fine... portions are large... you will probably end up taking some food home.  The service was OK as well..  The Cheesecake Factory isn't my first choice... but it does the trick when you are hungry."
Kyle T.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,31,,4.0,7/11/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is always great. One of my favorites.  Come here at least once or twice a week.  Great menu selection, great drinks, cheap prices, and the staff is always upbeat and friendly. It's always busy, so if you want a table you better get there early or you'll be waiting for awhile. One of my favorites so if your in the area check them out!!"
Riley R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,87,45,5.0,7/5/2015,"Great lunch, over the top service from the manager Ernesto. Lunch started out little rough, and there were a couple of issues. Ernesto stepped in, made everything great. So much so, that it isn't worth remembering why lunch started out rough."
Aaron A.,"Downey, CA",17,18,1,1.0,3/28/2015,"Service was horrible. The waiter only stopped by 2 times during our sit down. I ordered bread and it came when my soup was cold... I had to ask the host for a soda refill. When another server brought the dinner, no one bothered to come by and ask if we wanted cheese on our dinner... This website should have negative stars so I could have give it a -5 stars!!! The customer service was simply horrible!!!!"
Chris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/7/2015,"Attn: HQ Team Calabasas Where do I start with this beyond unsatisfactory performance and review?  First, a bit of history.  I have been a cheesecake factory customer for just about the beginning of time. I have spent countless birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasionss with family and friends. This includes multiple locations in Las Vegas (Caesar Shoppes) and Calfornia (The Grove, Americana, Sherman Oaks etc.). Although customer service has rarely been up to par, I have remained a loyal and devoted guest. Up until a recent visit @ their Grove location, I have decided to part ways and take my business to oher eating establishmens that will serve me or any other party as they should ""A guest."" I am not VIP or claim to be more special, but I was not aware I needed to be to receive the fundamental purpose of eating out which is to have an ""Experience"" and a great social gathering with great food amongst love one's and friends. The reviews before me are consistent, and definitely show insight as to how broken processes, operations, and talent management are.  It took 1 hour and 15 minutes to be checked in, 30 minutes after check in to be seated, 20 minutes to get a waiter (rude, bad demeanor), 20 mins to get our drinks, an interval of 45 mins to order,  and I can go on. Beyond that, management requested my wife to move so ""Other guest could be more comfortable!"" Wait... I'm not a guest?  This was by far the worst experience to the point that we didn't finish our meals amd requested the check early. In closing, I feel trends and history are great tools to understand behaviors, and can be utilized to strategically implement efficiency measures. Please take it from a long time customer, there are far more better choices out there that will deliver a consistent experience."
