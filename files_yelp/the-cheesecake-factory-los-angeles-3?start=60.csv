Wendy S.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",22,1,,1.0,12/22/2017,"We were very excited to come and eat at the grove. However, we waited for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. We came in at 5:30 and put ourselves on the list. Only to be told to come back in 30 mins for the buzzer. It is now 8:22 pm and we still haven't gotten seated.!!!!!!!"
Sergio G.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,6,3,2.0,12/8/2017,Had great food  at the bar.. But do to the fact that the front desk host ingnored me when i asked if i had to check in down stairs or up stairs I rate it only 2 stars . And when I asked for her name she ignored me so I had to ask my server for the hosts name (Sonia) great food bad host Sonia needs a better attitude
David A.,"New York, NY",131,2,1,5.0,10/14/2017,Just had dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the grove in Los Angeles California! This place is magical and the our sever Deshawn Wilson Was awesome. The food is always good here wish we had one in Sweden but we don't see you next year !!
Andrew W.,"Los Angeles, CA",252,223,57,4.0,2/24/2017,"They do not take reservations over the phone, only walk-ins. That means you must wait 45min+ to eat here. Review coming soon (45 minutes)"
Tracey T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,32,105,4.0,10/16/2017,"Its been so long since I have stepped foot into Cheesecake Factory. We came here for a birthday celebration. I am a huge fan of eating burgers. When I order the mushroom burger, I assumed it would just be regular size which it was. Half way eating into it I was still hungry, by 3/4 of the way I was already filled up. I managed to finish the burger and had a couple of fries. The burger may look average but theres alot of meat. The food was good, service was okay. Our server was a bit too busy with texting, I stood there for a good couple of minutes waiting on her."
Rhonda D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,2.0,12/10/2017,Food was great but the service was lousy. First time eating at this location and it definitely will be the last.
Sola C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/29/2017,"My favorite chain in America! Yes, they are always packed, yes the workers are always full of things to do and sometimes they can be confused or missing something! So don't go there if you in a rush. But for me there is no problem, the food is delicious!!! Superb!! And everyone treats me very well. Also the prices are very good! 5 stars to them."
Jennifer S.,"Granada Hills, Granada Hills, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2017,I had one of the worst experiences at cheesecake. The host was horrible to me and decided to ignore me completely. It was around 8pm and I asked two times how long is my wait time and she ignored me with no eye contact or anything and just spoke to the person next to me who was already getting helped by someone else and she went back to ignoring me. I had to yell out to her in order for her to help me. I felt as though she was Doing racist act towards me and ignoring me because of my color. This was so wrong and I have never felt so disrespected anywhere else . HORRIBLE HOST SERVICE from this specific person.
Reneè G.,"Ontario, CA",1,29,1,5.0,8/21/2017,"We went at peak hour for dinner time and only waited 30 min which is good for that time of evening . The service was great . The waiter didn't keep us waiting too long and he also didn't rush us. He kept up with refills and bread.  The food was a good price and the proportions were huge! The food was great!!!!We didn't have room for dessert, but had plenty of leftovers that were just as good the next day!!"
Dylan Keville B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,22,53,5.0,10/7/2017,Love the brown bread ooooo I want some right now oooooo brown bread but sometimes they don't have it and I get pissed
Shannon F.,"Montebello, CA",46,46,102,3.0,8/6/2017,"I came here the other day for an early dinner with my friend. They have the futurist seating arrangement, compared to other cheesecakes' with their's offering a balcony/terrace option. We sat outside on the terrace since it was such a nice day! Food is good, but nothing great. Service was okay, but I can tell it was busy, so no complaints.  If you happen to stop by here, request eating on the balcony so you can people watch! :)"
Tiffany W.,"La Puente, CA",0,8,1,3.0,10/11/2017,"I dined here this afternoon, arriving around 1:30. Right when I walked in the door, there was no one around but a woman behind a stand. I assumed she was the hostess so I went up to her but she was occupied looking at something behind her stand, so I politely waited for her to finish. After about a minute she finally looks up at me. She did not offer a greeting or ask if she could help me so at this point I thought that maybe she was not part of the restaurant but only worked in the building. I asked her if there was somewhere I could park my stroller and then moved upstairs via the escalator. At the top of an escalator I notice another stand identical to the one downstairs but this one had some people crowded around so I waited in line to put down my name for a table. When I got to the host, I told him ""table for two please!"" He stared at me blankly and asked if I had already given my name downstairs. I told him I did not then he frowned and said the wait would have to be about 5-10 minutes. I told him this was fine and moved to the side. My 2 year old daughter and I hung around looking at cheesecakes and about 15 min later they called our number. We returned to the host stand and returned the buzzer. The host told us that they were just cleaning off the table and would seat us shortly. I stepped to the side of the stand to wait to be seated. About another 10 minutes pass and I see several other parties called and also asked to stand to the side. I was pretty close to the stand that the host could have just turned around and told me there was some issue but he didnt. I waited another 5 minutes and went up to ask him if there was a problem. He told me that there was some confusion and that they were getting reorganized. The other two parties that were called and asked to wait were ignored. He could have told them both the same but he did not. Another few minutes pass and another hostess arrives to take us to our seats. As we are walking, she looks at my daughter and myself and asks if I would like a kids menu instead. I notice at this point that the male host who took our name down had handed her two standard menus. Since my daughter is only 2 I found this very strange. She went back and got the correct menu and we were finally seated. I ordered the kids spaghetti with meatballs for my kid and the grilled chicken avocado club for myself. The spaghetti was a large portion, more than she could ever eat, but tasted good. My sandwhich was a monster and impossible to eat without making a mess, but was also very tasty. Our server was a little difficult to find because the one who took our order and the one who checked up on us were not the same. I can only assume that the first one went on break and failed to inform us that the server would be changing. Once I figured out who our server was supposed to be it was a more pleasant experience going forward."
J S.,"West Hollywood, CA",10,60,236,1.0,10/15/2017,"We had interactions with five people. Only Demetrie was nice and efficient. Everyone else acted as if we were bothering them. This includes the host that gave me a one word answer, the lady at the bakery who could not figure out what to do, the person who seated us, and the lady who rang our bill up. In fact she gave us so much attitude. I have no idea why only Demetrie was kind and considerate. We will not be returning even though Demetrie was outstanding and the food was good. I don't know what made the last lady give us so much attitude. Whatever the reason, it ruined our experience because it was the last exchange we had."
Paige M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,198,437,4.0,7/14/2017,Celebrated my birthday here! Love the dishes. I'm a huge fan if the Chinese Chicken Salad. We had tiramisu cheesecake!  Love it! Not so sweet but great texture!
Aditya L.,"Abilene, TX",19,4,,1.0,10/15/2017,Food is okay. Wait times are terrible. Not only is the wait long but it's also highly inaccurate. Don't recommend it. Better places in the area
Thalie L.,"Chicago, IL",88,294,310,5.0,1/6/2017,I love the cheesecake factory food and I hate that they are called the cheesecake factory because I thing that the meals are better than the desert. I highly recommend the avocado rolls for the sauce! And also their salmon dish is amazing. I also recommend people to share their cheesecake as it is pretty heavy and very rich! What I enjoyed the most was the balcony with view on the grove. The service was a little bit slow like the one in skokie IL but the waiter was nice!
Blessed W.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,63,17,5.0,9/16/2017,Always loved this restaurant and I really hope will continue love them. Because I always get the service and food that I want. Service is always great and I just like Being in this restaurant. Have been here already more than a few times. And always after I leave I'm thinking about when I should go back again to eat my pastas.  I really love eating Pasta at this place.  Thank you for a such a great service and good.
Mandy E.,"Lahaina, HI",78,56,424,5.0,8/20/2017,"Such a fun place for a gathering but extremely noisy and highly energetic. I was taking a mellow afternoon on my own away from hubby and kids so it was a bit overwhelming with the loud gatherings but I sat back took a breathe, found my gratitude and enjoyed the moment."
Kristina F.,"Culver City, CA",131,4,,1.0,10/24/2017,"Horrible service every time I have eaten here. Never expect to receive bread if you call in your order for pick up! They offer it, you ask for it, they assure you it's in the bag, however it NEVER is! Always check to make sure they have your order correct when picking up your food. They always seem stingy when it comes to their bread and to go orders."
Jessica- ashley B.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",2,13,3,5.0,11/25/2017,I came here to cheesecake Nov 25 2017 for early dinner with my boyfriend. Jordan was amazing she was our waitress.
