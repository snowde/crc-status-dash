Brittany G.,"Longlea, Australia",0,4,2,5.0,4/9/2015,"Absolutely delicious meal! The portion was huge and the price was low, which left me extremely satisfied. The staff were absolutely lovely too. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone! :)"
Shirley D.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",327,259,20,3.0,11/30/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a pretty consistent restaurant. I wish they would narrow down their menu and really work on the flavor and quality of their dishes. Two entrees,  two drinks,  and two appetizers came out to about 90 bucks..pretty hefty for the quality of food you get even though the portions are big. I ordered the cajun pasta but it was just a brickload of pasta w.nothing but olive oil and overseasoned chicken and shrimp thrown on top..supposedly one of their best dishes.I highly disagree. It was a great dissapointment.  The wait here was about an hour and from being here before,  I know the wait is usually that long.  Its an okay place to come when your w.a group and looking to find a chill place where you can be loud. But dont come here if you're looking for affordability."

Lindsay R.,"West Hollywood, CA",31,49,2,4.0,4/2/2015,I got the country french salad and it was descent.  Our server Allison was fantastic and very attentive!  They do have a bunch of stuff to choose from but They do not have a ton of vegetarian options.  It is a good crowd pleaser place to go when you have a group of people with different preferences.
Reuben S.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,8,,5.0,4/26/2015,They showed me great service. They gave me the star treatment and I would recommend anyone to go and eat there. They are friendly and the food there is amazing.
Arturo C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",2,2,1,1.0,8/12/2014,"Went in for a birthday dinner tonight and I wanted a table for 12, I was asked if two tables NEXT to each other was fine, and I agreed. When I got my tables they give me two booths back to back.. I was quick to say that that's not what I was told, I did not request 2 booths, you can't have my party divided. We were told two tables. Their response was ""they are next to each other"". Clearly someone does not know the difference ""behind and next to"", the girl was rude and did not tend to our needs. Also, when people from my party were not at the restaurant, but on their way up, our second booth was empty. Minutes later, after the host gave us a 5 minute ultimatum, they gave away our table to another party without notifying us. We asked several times to speak with a manager but no manage came when requested. It wasn't until a while later, after we noticed someone who looked like a manager walk past our table multiple times, that that person stopped by and tried to explain their rationale behind their actions.  All in all, the food was good. But my party's experience here was unacceptable. The only person who made it a little better was the server."
Choco C.,"El Monte, CA",0,49,107,5.0,3/27/2014,"I hv been to cheesecake factory many times already! This time, I went w my friend n she ordered fried mac&cheese! i never tasted it b4 but its rilli yummy! i would totally recommend it!"
David L.,"Newport Beach, CA",341,87,9,1.0,5/23/2013,"God Bless America! I am glad we live in a country that allows us to speak our minds. I've read a few of these reviews on this place and I have to say they are WRONG... Place is pricey. Food is mediocre. Atmosphere is Noicey. And service is AVERAGE at best. Went to this place with my family and they were so ANTI-BABY (yes you read that right).  The hostess or wanna be manager gave us a hardtime about my son's stroller. They gave us a table that was so bad, I felt like I was sitting in the kitchen. Listen, this is an opinion. I've been to this place a few times (not always by choice) including several other locations; all seem the same. Hey it's your money and I'm not going tell you how to spend it. Enjoy.."
Vahid S.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,31,,4.0,4/15/2015,"I like this place because it has everything on the menu and they make it good and descent.  From a simple burger to tuna salad to salmon dish, they are all very good and reasonably priced.  It is not excellent quality, but for the price your paying, you are getting the best you can.  Recommend it if your around fairfax and want some descent food...."
Carla C.,"Los Angeles, CA",559,131,29,3.0,7/11/2014,"Though I'm a big fan of the cheesecake factory this Is One of my least favorite locations.  Long waits on pretty much an evening and always extremely loud with the majority of the clientele being families. Yes it is at the Grove,  which is nice if catching a movie but don't count on wait times being what they say as you'll more than likely be late to your show.  I prefer to and frequent the Beverly Hills location to avoid long wait times,  excessive noise, and the inconvenience of this location."
Waqas A.,"Glendale, CA",4,7,5,4.0,3/17/2015,"Like the food and restaurant,  only issue is waiting time other than that nice place to have dinner."
Dayae K.,"Los Angeles, CA",182,331,7,3.0,1/26/2011,"Been to cheesecake more than I can count. This time, my boyfriend and I went to the one at The Grove.  Same menu, same very delicious bread, and same decoration as every other cheesecake factory out there. The one nice thing about this restaurant is that it is on the second floor of the grove so on a very nice day, you can sit outside the patio and overlook the whole place. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad.  I expected the salad to be pretty heavy because... well, it's bbq sauce and ranch. But to my surprise, the ranch was very light and was perfect with the crisp salad. I wouldn't say this is the best salad but it was good enough. And, the portions are HUGE so it's always good to share a plate with someone else you know."
Julia F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,5/12/2015,"Came here with my boyfriend last night and I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a while. We really enjoyed it, the Pineapple Moscow Mule was bomb. Unfortunately don't remember our servers name but she was pretty cool and didn't get annoyed with me wanting to substitute beans for chicken in the Thai Lettuce Wraps. It wasn't that busy so obviously everything came rather quickly. Don't get to The Grove very often but we had fun."
Alex L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,47,3,4.0,8/2/2015,The Cheesecake Factory is usually a great choice for lunch or dinner but not worth an hour and a half wait at the Grove. With so many choices in that area that do take reservations make a smarter choice and look for alternatives.
Julie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,586,6,4.0,11/28/2010,"I made a quick trip to the Grove and stopped in just for some desserts to go.  I had to get the limited edition pumpkin cheesecake and the peppermint bark cheesecake along with my favorite carrot cake.  The cheesecake slices aren't real large for $6.95 a slice, but I think they are worth it since they are so rich and taste sooo good.  As I was waiting for my order, I was admiring the many other flavors in the display case.  It would be fun just to try a slice of each of the various unusual/unique flavors that you can't get anywhere else! Since it was early, there wasn't much business and I was the only one at the counter.  The service was efficient and there was a friendly guy holding the door open and greeting people."
Megan J.,"Temecula, CA",243,512,139,4.0,11/2/2013,"This is probably the best Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. The location is great, service was wonderful and food and alcoholic drinks were made just right!! We came here on a Monday afternoon (we were here for DWTS next door and wanted to eat lunch beforehand) and got seated right away. Ordered a Mojito (my fave) and the bartender did a great job! For some reason, a Mojito is a hard drink to make right. But, no worries here!! We ordered the White chocolate raspberry cheesecake to go and it is my fave. So delicious. This is one of the few restaurants in The Grove that is somewhat affordable compared to the other restaurants in the area. Yes, their alcoholic drinks are a little expensive but they are so yum!!"
Big D.,"Ho'olehua, HI",0,34,15,2.0,3/12/2015,"Another one of those bad reviews. The primary reason for my bad experience was the wait to be seated. I gave my name to the hostess and was quoted 15 minutes for two people. So we went upstairs and found a couple seats at the bar for a couple drinks (great bartender). Roughly 25 minutes later, I receive a text indicating that our table was ready and to head over to the hostess booth. We did that and found ourselves standing in a crowded area around the booth with several other different parties waiting. I tell the hostess that I received a text and she tells me to wait a moment. So they began seating some of the other parties but 10 minutes later, I ask again and they tell me to wait (I didn't even mention my name). I'm normally not the one to complain but at least acknowledge me (with eye contact) and make the impression that my inquiries matter. Probably 25 minutes after I received the text, we finally got our table. Our server was great but there was a period where we had to wonder when our order was coming. That and my food kinda seemed like it had been sitting awhile. Other than those things, my usual experience at Cheesecake is pretty good."
Sharon V.,"Carlsbad, CA",2465,1106,473,3.0,10/8/2010,"I rarely ever come to any Cheesecake Factory because the temptation to get an entire cheesecake is just too high and I feel that the food is just mediocre. Bad on both fronts. But on this day, we needed to fill our bellies before we went without food and water for 6 hours for the entire duration of Dancing with the Stars (Standing in line, going through security, seating, etc;).  This was the only joint that we were feeling and luckily there was no wait. We shared the Hot Spinach and Cheese dip that had garlic and artichoke hearts and warm yummy cheese. It was an absolutely comfort food. I don't order this often (for obvious reasons) but man, I'm so glad that we ordered this. It totally hit the spot.  For lunch, I ended up ordering the lunch sized Chinese Chicken Salad but I was amazed when it came out...it was huge. It wasn't the best CCS that I've had but it was pretty good and did the job."
Brianna J.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,134,24,1.0,9/25/2015,"This place is a disgrace to the cheese cake factory franchise .. My food was ice cold , and the waitress could care less... If you don't like working with people why are you a waitress again ? Money and time waisted smdh."
