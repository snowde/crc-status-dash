Misty G.,"Tempe, AZ",64,18,2,5.0,1/18/2015,Can never complain about this place. Love it! Fast service... Great food.... People watching is the best!
Alexander M.,"Las Vegas, NV",403,1023,2304,2.0,10/23/2014,Worse Cheesecake Factory dining experience ever! So of course coming here on a Saturday evening its expected that there will be at least a 30 minute wait! That's fair but what isn't fair is to quote a party 30 mins and have that wait time almost double! Upon arriving we were greeted and had our cell phone numbers taken so they can inform us (party of 2) when our table was ready. Decided to walk around the shops to kill time after 30 mins we checked in to see how much longer was told 10 mins then that turned to 20.. Just a mess. The service was terrible my friend ordered the nachos with beef instead of chicken requesting only meat and the cheese and the rest of the toppings on the SIDE! I ordered the macaroni burger both simple items came out 30 mins later just SLOW! My friends nachos were all wrong the movies probably could've provided better presentation for these nachos and on top of it all the added some sauce when we specifically asked for only meat and cheese! Ugh! So they took it back and brought it back with clearly the meat patty that was brought to our table by accident. I could go on and on but long story short I'll never return to this location! Complete chaos!
Michael F.,"Los Angeles, CA",1715,566,100,3.0,10/2/2012,"Our eldest son chose the Cheesecake Factory for his 16th birthday, and of course we wanted to take him to where he wanted to go. Prior to starting to write this review, I went back to read if I had ever reviewed a Cheesecake Factory before.  I have, and not surprisingly, my thoughts have not changed much.  Almost all of my experiences at various Cheesecake Factories have been virtually identical.  Therefore, most of this review is recycled material, but still relevant: I try to to avoid the Cheesecake factory because I always seem to find them having an extraordinarily long wait for food that I would consider slightly above average.  We waited at this specific Cheesecake factory for about 45 minutes, which was terrible with our active 4 year old and not many available places to sit. The service was OK.  The employees ODed on the schmoozing, and were not all that great at the details. The food was just like every other Cheesecake factory to me; overrated with unfathomably high calorie counts (if something has that many calories it better taste damn good!).  A couple of weeks back when we went here, I ordered the Crispy Chicken Costoletta.  It was pretty good, and came with some tasty mash potatoes and asparagus.  However, they have a pretty similar dish at BJ's that I think tastes much better and is much cheaper as well.   To finish off my meal, I got a slice of the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  It was one of the better cheesecakes I have had here, but it was nothing special.  I honestly believe that the frozen Cheesecake Factory cakes that you can buy at your local supermarket taste better than the ones at the actual restaurant.  Strange, I know.  I just think their desserts are overrated. After another visit to the Cheesecake factory I can say that not much has changed. If I were to rename this place, I would call it ""Overrated with an Atrociously Long Wait""."
Peter C.,"Alhambra, CA",369,599,1118,3.0,3/26/2011,"If you've been to one Cheesecake Factory you've been to them all.  However, on purpose, Mrs C., my mother-in-law and I gingerly ate half of our lunches in order to save room for some cheesecake, and right now they have an off-menu special.  It's a key lime cheesecake baked on coconut vanilla crust, with mango mousse and mango glaze on top.  If that sounds 1% appealing to you, you MUST get it, because it's better than the Kahula cocoa cheesecake, and that one had been my favorite.  Well, up until now, anyway.  They wait at this location at The Grove wasn't long at 12noon on a Saturday, but by 1:30pm the waiting area was packed!  Good food and good service, though."
Michelle G.,"Los Angeles, CA",236,91,250,5.0,10/20/2010,"Cheesecake Factory gets a five star for the great experience I've had with them for the past years. Yes, I am a regular at this restaurant because of their great service, legit food and their toothsome DESSERTS such as the CHEESECAKE! This restaurant gets super crowded every night. WHY? Because there are plenty of tourist people here at The Grove and Farmer's Market is just across the street. Whenever I go to this restaurant, I usually just go straight to the high stool tables near the bar. Yes, I  do sit in front of the bar with two sport tv screens and the desire to buy a drink looking over those YUMMEH alcoholic beverages. Well, I like these tables more because luckily we never wait for the table.  Once you've settled in, a server will immediately give you the menu, talk about their specials for today and ask for your drinks. Then they leave and come back to serve you some warm nicely toasted bread with a side of BUTTER(Ohlala!). After you've eaten your bread, you will definitely feel full from all those bread they have served you. So, I say slow down on the bread and wait for your entree. Plus the entree portion is generously big, that could be shared for two. As for myself, I can never finish a full entree from their menu which is why I only order their snacks or appetizers instead. And through out your experience, the servers and even the managers will check up on you and ask you about your meal. But make sure you have enough room for the DESSERTS, I mean why go to a Cheesecake Factory if you are not going to get CHEESECAKE(*DROOL!)!  My boyfriend and I can honestly say that we have explored almost all of the cheesecake selections. But my all-time favorite and what I'm super addicted to are their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake with a side of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream(MUST TRY) and their 30th Anniversary Cheesecake(SWEETGASM). The Red Velvet Cheesecake is great too but I'm a CHOCOHOLIC, so I gotta have CHOCOLATE on them. hehe. Dang, just thinking about those Cheesecake fus making me crave for a box full of cheesecake. I wish it's my birthday all over again, so I can get a box(as seen on the picture). Now, I gotta hit up a Cheesecake Factory this weekend to satisfy my sweet tooth's desire."
Mark W.,"Westwood, CA",0,13,6,4.0,3/27/2015,Love this place. Great customer service. Food is awesome as always. I love their bang bang chicken. Make sure you add the shrimp to make it delicious. The only issue is there is always a long line so the wait is usually at least 30 min to an hour
C. M.,"Loma Linda, CA",0,207,351,4.0,10/31/2014,We eat here everytime we're at The Grove. We always look forward to the breads! We usually eat before we go shopping which is around as soon as the restaurant opens. I just don't like the fact that we always have to wait for the server and out food even if we were one of the first customers inside.
Maki M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,74,,3.0,5/5/2014,Taste : Just OK. Portion is big. Happy hour food is good deal.  Atmosphere : Spacious family restaurant. Service : Good.
Matt B.,"Bray Park, Australia",1,8,2,5.0,4/12/2015,"Unfortunately no one can be told what the Cheesecake Factory is, you have to see it for yourself."
Irene Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,320,127,4.0,11/30/2012,"A good place to grab a bite before watching a movie at the Grove! We were in a bit of a rush since we only had 45 minutes to eat beforehand. The wait here was only 5 mins at 6:30 pm on a wednesday, not to bad! We were seated upstairs, had JUST missed happy hour (ends at 6:00)... booo... So I find out that they have this new skinny menu now! NICE. Everytime we come here I feel like I'm taking in at least 1000 calories. I ordered the skinny asian salad, and it was huge! And pretty good.  A little low on the dressing but advertised to be under 500 calories so what do you expect. Hubs got the chicken picada, delicious as usually. We were in and out in record time and still enjoyed our meal!"
happy g.,"Hayward, CA",16,70,1,2.0,11/25/2014,Good food but server April F has the attitude that she is not interested to serve you. Thanks as well for the note that it is customary to leave 15 - 20% tip
Lily A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",11,29,,4.0,10/17/2014,"I met 3 of my friends at this Cheesecake location on Saturday at 10:30 at night. The place was packed and the wait for table for 4 people was well over an hour! We ended up sitting at the bar. Even though they were so busy, the service was very good. I had the Mexican tortilla salad. It's on their skinny menu, but the portion was still huge. I definitely recommend it."
Karina M.,"Bakersfield, CA",4,14,21,4.0,2/11/2015,"This was our first time being here and everyone was very polite with us. We ate outside, in which the view was beautiful!  Our waitress was very kind and every time she passed by us, she made sure we were doing good. However, I did not like the fact there are only two stalls in the restroom .. I had to wait in line... it's a pretty big restaurant,  I'd assume there be more. It also seems to get really busy, which causes waiting for us to be seated. But aside from that it was a good experience."
Nova T.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,30,,3.0,10/12/2012,"You know when you see the word ""factory"" in the title of a restaurant, your`e in for an Orwellian nightmare, and this place does not disappoint in that respect. The wait staff ( mostly males) look like they were spawned specifically for the job. They all have the same scripted approach, same arched eyebrows, coiffed hairstyle and swagger to the point you can not tell them apart. That being said, they do try to offer courteous service, and the menu at this factory is pretty extensive, so there is bound to be something there for everyones palate ( with the exception of a couple of surprisingly tasty appetizers don`t expect it to be that much better than a few notches above fast food quality). I have never found their cheesecakes to be anything other than ordinary, some are downright awful- and most are doused in cheap processed whip cream which is a very amateurish ingredient to add to any dessert.(Fortunately for the factory, most people have never tasted real whipped cream) At any rate, Any grievances are quickly rectified by a very fast acting general manager who really does seem to want every patron to leave the place happy and satisfied. I`d give this place 5 stars for that category alone. The prices are fairly reasonable for what you get, too. Although, i`d never dine there for a real meal  because of the zombie carnival like atmosphere and mediocre food, i`ve found It`s worth slipping into this factorys bar area around 5 pm for their 5 dollar Happy Hour menu to grab a quick bite to eat after a matinee at the theaters next door."
Eydan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,18,4,4.0,4/24/2015,the service was very nice we got a text msg that our table was ready the food was great recomended to be seated in te balcony
Sarah E.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,33,13,4.0,3/21/2013,The service here is amazing + you get 2 hrs of parking validated.  I came with a group of friends & were sharing a few entrees.  They messed up our order and forgot to bring out one of the entrees.  Both the waiter and the manager came to our table twice to apologize.  The offered a couple of free appetizers which we declined since we had already ordered plenty of food so they comp'd our dessert :D I've been here a few times and despite looking busy the service is always prompt & cordial.  If you have trouble deciding between one of the many yummy cheesecakes be sure to ask your waiter about their favorite or what's currently one of the most popular - I've never been let down by their recommendation ;)
Hana A.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,275,2,4.0,12/20/2014,Everyone LOVES the Cheesecake factory and I don't know how you couldn't! Yummy! The food is amazing and the cheesecake is super yummy along with the rest of the deserts.  Last time I came I think I had salmon and it was BEYOND perfection.
Sontue B.,"Bellflower, CA",58,136,,2.0,11/29/2014,"I like the Cheesecake Factory but this one gets two stars because our Spicy Chicken was too salty and the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp lacked flavor. I've had both dishes before and they were good before. Also, we went on a busy night so service wasn't great. Our server took our order and we saw him again to get the check. He didn't even offer us cheesecakes. It's the holiday season so you'd think they would tell us about the holiday cheesecakes. We asked to sit at a different table for more space and they gave us a hard time because there were only 2 in our party but another couple was at the exact table size so they allowed us to move. The bread plate at the table was dirty and the new ones they gave us were wet. I've been to this one before with no problems but this time it was pretty bad. I doubt I'll be returning."
Karlo S.,"Long Beach, CA",297,150,813,4.0,10/16/2013,national cheesecake day! good service and value. great variety to choose from in the menu. food is always consistent. amazing cheesecake. there is always room for dessert! ordered the toasted marshmallow s'mores galore cheesecake for national cheesecake day. will come back again and try other things on the menu! check out the picture i posted.
Ravin L.,"Hawthorne, CA",10,70,81,3.0,12/17/2014,"Every Sunday I would be here with my faintly. This is my favorite location, however the wait on a Sunday is crazy long. But hey once you get in you should be fine. Try the pasta jambalaya it's the only thing I order! Bread is yummy, drinks are good as well. If you have room for dessert there are several cheesecakes to choose from. I personally order the apple crumble and it is fantastic. I've also tried the red velvet cheese cake before and it's delicious"
