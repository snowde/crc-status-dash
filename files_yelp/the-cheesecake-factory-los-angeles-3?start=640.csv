Emma T.,"Los Angeles, CA",442,222,1415,5.0,10/9/2013,"You guys are killing me, why on earth did you add the Mango and the Pumpkin Cheese Cakes, aren't you tired of seeing me.  I always buy one of each since they added them, not the same day, however I do not want to run out.  I love this place it is so COOL and you get to people watch at the same time and see some real dope fashions :-) Yes we are going again next week to take an employee to lunch for his Bday, however it is really about ME, GOTTA HAVE MY PUMPKIN FIX, Lol"
Yang Y.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",8,37,1,4.0,4/29/2013,We went there for the happy hour and many appetizers and drinks are only 5 bulks. Great environment with good food. I recommend the vietnamese spring rolls and kale salad. The waiter has recommended the Buffolo Blasts. I found it ok but my husband loves it. And all appetizers are big portorn so dont order too much...
Alexandrea Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",483,118,230,4.0,1/12/2013,I tried their new flat bread for appetizer. Very delicious! Always love their flavored lemonade. I have never had a bad experience with the Cheesecake Factory. And everyone must agree we ALL love their dessert menu!
Samvel A.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,10,3,5.0,7/19/2014,I went to this place with my family . We enjoyed the food and friendly environment .  They have additional menu for kids . Highly recommended place !!!!!
Jeff O.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,11,1,2.0,12/24/2015,"I have always enjoyed the Cheesecake Factory, until recently. I have been to MANY Cheesecake Factory restaurants MANY times (including the grove location.)  Last night our food was not AND service was not up to their usual standard. The service was SLOW. It was 40 minutes from when we ordered to when we received our food.  We ordered appetizers and they arrived AFTER our meals arrived and remember, the meals themselves took 40 minutes. They explained that there was a shift change which I'd allow some give but this was not acceptable. The manager was nice enough and the waiter tried to smooth it over (I even gave him the full 20% tip, since it's Christmas) but, our dinner was just not that enjoyable. Even the food seemed kinda lame. There wasn't enough sauce for my dish and the food just generally didn't seem very fresh. And now the next morning I'm feeling kinda queasy from it all. Next time I visit the Grove, I'll be trying a different restaurant and I certainly am not going out of my way to visit any Cheesecake Factory anytime soon! Ask the saying goes... ""all good things must come to an end..."" seems to now be true for the CF."
Diana S.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",73,248,57,5.0,12/1/2014,"I love love love cheesecake factory, I think this is my favorite restaurant. I have the jambalaya it is good spicy and tasty."
Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2246,2841,1478,5.0,7/4/2010,"My Berkeley friends are going to have my excommunicated for favorably reviewing a chain. A large chain. A successful chain. Oh, the humanity... But my retort... Oh, the red velvet cheesecake. Seriously. Had it as an appetizer. Our mothers weren't watching and that's one of the things you tell yourself you'll do when you're a kid, yes? So be it. Red Velvet Cheesecake? Insane. Seriously, it was just so so good. Also highly recommend the bistro shrimp pasta and the hula chicken salad. Really, the food here is just consistently good, the service as well... and we were outside at The Grove on a 70 degree afternoon. It was just an A+ all around."
JJ K.,"Monterey Park, CA",0,41,,3.0,1/23/2016,"While we ate the bread, we needed more butter and asked a waitress for butter. Her answer was wait a few minutes and never showed up with it. But our regular waiter came after about ten minutes and was great. I had the white chile which was fairly good. My wife has the salmon salad which was also good. Nothing was great except for all the cheese cake. I think I'd rather come here for desert."
Adri R.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,121,105,3.0,7/20/2014,"This is like all other cheesecake factories. Unfortunately,  it's the most crowded restaurant in the grove. Be sure to make reservations before you try to have dinner here. You may find seating for a quick. It's at the bar, so be sure to check it before losing all hope. Do I even need to say...try the cheese cake?"
Elle Y.,"New York, NY",158,115,44,4.0,10/13/2012,"The place was full of people on Saturday night so we sat and ate at the bar. My friend kept annoying the bartender Aaron who politely put up with his constant nagging. Anyways, we had a plate of the factory nachos which, if people still said ""da bomb"", that plate was da cheese bomb!  Unfortunately by the time I was done with the massive plate of nachos and jalapeño war with my friends I had absolutely no room in my stomach for the beet and goat cheese salad.  ......you can never trust a person who doesn't like goat cheese because they're lying. With that said, good times are an always at Cheesecake Factory"
F Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,17,,2.0,12/12/2015,Service was great but food was horrible! The Cajun chicken was bland and lacking spices and salt. Chicken biscuit was tasteless and not worth the price. Only good things were the appetizers we ordered which were the wings and Thai lettuce wrap. Was very disappointed with the food. Expected a lot more from CF.
Matt W.,"West Hollywood, CA",513,46,,3.0,1/28/2015,"I give it 3 stars. The food is always great, but, they do not take reservations and often times it takes forever to get a table. I recommend going here if you have a lot of time to kill and if you don't mind waiting. Sometimes it's best to just take it to go and enjoy the food from the comfort of your own home."
Tati R.,"Los Angeles, CA",398,333,,3.0,6/4/2012,"Dating and the Cheesecake Factory. When a guy takes me here on a first date I think he is boring.  Therefore, no second date. If a guy takes me here after watching a movie, the farmers market is closed and it is already a fourth or fifth date, I feel like I can start putting my guard down.  This is a guy who doesn't have to be creative all the time and is going to be okay with my Grandmas love of chain restaurants.  The only downside is the next step is him farting in front of me. If a guy starts taking me to the Cheesecake Factory on the the regular the relationship is doomed.  We have both given up and it is time to move on, if we keep going we will end up in matching sweatsuits."
Kae B.,"San Diego, CA",8,13,1,2.0,12/28/2014,Horrible service horrible food. My chicken tasted like rubber my mashed potatoes were completely cold. Only silver lining was the manager Angela she made everything a little better very professional and understanding if this was a review of her it would be five stars.
Chandler M.,"Houston, TX",91,283,10,4.0,6/20/2013,"It's Cheesecake Factory! the go-to spot for first dates, birthday parties, and random movie nights.  Huge variety of great food, excellent drinks, reasonable prices, very friendly staff. Just watch out for wait times as it's a universally-liked establishment and being at The Grove means you'll be waiting a bit longer than other locations.  It's still very much worth going to for the second-story balcony where you can people-watch while you devour your cheesecake!"
Kasey Kimberly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/8/2015,"Stay away on the weekends! It was my choice to wait an hour for a table then another 15-20 minutes for a booth. My friend and I both knew what we were ordering. From the time our order was taken it took 1 hour 20 for our food to hit the table! We were offered comp salad or soup at 58 minutes which we turned down. Her food was fine , my  pork chop was over cooked and dry but I wasn't sending it back!they need to hire more cooks to get the food out if they are going to seat that many people. When I lleft I discovered I had to pay $8 for parking because even with validation I wasn't covered. The server was embarrassed and when he came and told us he was taking his dinner break I recommended he eat elsewhere!"
Bryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",78,357,149,5.0,9/22/2010,"This place gets five stars for the awesome location, generous parking, and the fact they didn't ruin my birthday and actually ... made it kinda awesome. Came in with a party of 10 (was kinda iffy because I know Cheescake Factory doesn't take reservations) and was quoted 45 minutes. We were okay with that because there's lots to see and do at The Grove. Left two phone numbers (I knew I'd miss the call so my friend luckily got it), and 15 minutes later, we were seated because of some cancellations. I don't know if I should credit this to the service or to birthday luck but I was happy as hell anyway. Got a nice table, the food was delicious as usual (got the Cajun Jambalaya) but also tried the Chipotle Pasta something, artichoke dip, and some meatloaf/pot roast dish with BOMB MASHED POTATOES. You know the birthday boy had to sample a little bit of everything. Ate two bites of my food to save room for CHEESECAKE. I mean, the place is called CHEESECAKE factory, how can you not get cheesecake? It's like going to KFC and not getting chicken. The Red Velvet Cheesecake is a CONSISTENT WINNER but I also tried the white chocolate raspberry and vanilla cheesecake and they were just as good. You really can't go wrong with their cheesecake selection. Aside from the piece of shrimp I stupidly flung into my eye that made it swell up like Rihanna's (I'm allergic), it was a great night. Don't forget to validate your parking ticket on the way out."
Jonathan S.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",1,12,8,1.0,8/7/2014,First off dont lie to guests and give them a false time. 15 and 50 dont sound alike. I asked him how long twice and he said 15 and 30 mins later he said he said 50... what a liar. Forget you!!!!  I hate places that have poor food service and this just pissed me off big time.. I would rather eat at Burger Kings. ..
Alycia A.,"Chesapeake, VA",73,45,93,5.0,9/13/2014,"Best service ever.  The waitress was very friendly, welcoming, accommodating & attentive! Food was great that went along with the nice view from the top balcony seating outside!"
Juliana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,193,209,5.0,7/31/2013,"Cheesecake factory is a pretty big chain so it's pretty packed on the weekends.  You can always expect the place to be loud and tables to be a little closer than you would like.  There's usually a wait unless you can find a seat at the bar. The menu is huge ranging from pretty much everything.  I usually get the portebello burger which is Delicious but my sister says it's too greasy.   Of course if you come to the cheesecake factory you have to get cheesecake.  I love fresh strawberry and the white chocolate raspberry truffle but really all the cheesecakes are good. If you have time before the movie or want a late night dessert, definitely get a cheesecake."
