Fanon P.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,388,248,4.0,9/14/2010,"Wow I cant believe im just writing a review for this place? Probably thought i was gonna  bash and degrade the place didn't ya? NAH! Any place with cheesecake in the title has to be good right? I mean something there has to effing be!!!!   I really like this place for smallbites and deserts. Id give them a three on the cheesecakes alone, Im not really one to bitch about service... I mean im from the east coast. Philly to be exact. I really dont hope for ""great  customer service""? I demand the shit! lol Their calamari beats out alot of pricey ""Fine dining"" establishments hands down! its def in the top 5 of good calamari in la. Drinks rock too. I just go there and order like every app get alcohol and cheesecake! Do the same and youll probably leave happy."
Helena S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,100,28,5.0,1/22/2015,"This is a good place to eat after shopping at the Grove. The food is always good, and I have never had a problem with it when I go here. Beware, that this place can get really busy and that you might want to put your name in before you start shopping."
Jenny K.,"Torrance, CA",64,35,20,2.0,4/5/2014,"Case was or still is our server tonight,  usually Cheesecake Factory the servers are fast and courteous but our guy was so slow..... I had to ask for the silverware twice. didn't come by I dont expect great service but at least come by to refill the water or ask how is the food.... I know its Saturday night but it took him forever to clear our table.... I won't be coming to this Cheesecake Factory for awhile. .. food was decent but just the time it took us to get our food and everything else was horrible"
Nicole D.,"Bristol, CT",341,1543,221,3.0,8/12/2014,"We came here for National Cheesecake Day, when all cheesecake was 50% off, and apparently the rest of LA had the same idea! The place was beyond packed. We were told the wait would be an hour and a half. Fine. We went to the Farmer's Market and grabbed a drink to kill some time. Instead of giving out buzzers so you know when your table is ready, they took cell phone numbers and said they'd call or text when the table was ready. I had my phone on and out in front of me the whole time. After about an hour and 40 minutes, we still hadn't heard from them so we walked back and they told me that there was a mix-up and they couldn't reach us. I was annoyed because we had been waiting for them and they had just given our table to someone else. But they realized it was their mistake so they did the right thing and gave us the next available table right away. We sat outside on the upstairs patio. You can't really complain about The Cheesecake Factory menu - it has literally anything and everything you could possibly be in the mood for. I love their bread, too. I tried the fish tacos because in all my years of coming here I never had those before. They were pretty good, but just like everything else on the menu - the portions were huge. Service was okay, the food was pretty slow to come out (probably because they were so slammed with a gazillion people that night). I probably will avoid the extra touristy locations from now on, but I still love this place. Who doesn't?!"
Dionne R.,"Las Vegas, NV",15,75,161,4.0,4/6/2013,"Great atmosphere, especially shortly after sunset looking down at the grove & all the lights & people. The food is good too - I come here every time when I'm in LA but that could also be cause I love the grove & the farmers market :)"
Angela R.,"San Pedro, CA",10,96,150,4.0,9/22/2014,The food was great! Our waitress was very good. There was some mess under the table so she had to call a busboy to clean it out and we had to get up from the table. Our wait was only 20 min to get a table.
Luann S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,8,3.0,11/22/2015,"This location at The Grove is very crowded and the wait very long. We got a great table for 2 on the outside patio which was great. I ordered off of the ""skinnylicious"" menu which was a mistake. The Chicken Salad Sandwich was mediocre at best with a very small portion of chicken salad on dry toasted bread. The celery was abundant and very few almonds. Nothing like they described on the menu. It came with a side salad which was lettuce with vinaigrette dressing. I originally ordered the turkey burger but the waiter said the turkey meat was not good and they could not serve it. Ok weird!  They redeemed themselves with the cheesecake though. I ordered the lemon meringue pie cheesecake and it was awesome. I got it to go and had to stop myself from finishing it when I got home. Service was adequate and server friendly. Go for the cheesecake and order an appetizer instead of anything on the skinny menu!"
Graham S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,5.0,1/14/2015,Even when it seems there's a crazy long wait you can get in at the bar in under 15min. Solid food. Servers are always efficient and friendly. What more could you want from this tried and true business? Take your leftovers to the movie next door.
Andrea M.,"Los Angeles, CA",595,478,815,5.0,5/26/2013,"I try to try new things every time I eat out but it's so hard when they have such great selections that you have grown to love. I did try their flat bread for the 1st time and go figure, it was bomb!"
MARGIE I.,"Torrance, CA",911,699,1212,4.0,8/14/2012,"Came out here for lunch with my family a couple of weeks ago and decided to write a review. We were a party of 7, and I realized that there is never a long wait when being seated. I like the ""Honey Wheat Bushman Bread"" that they give you before your meal with butter. We sat outside in the patio area, nice view of the marina. I always order the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp and it is bangin'!"
Brian I.,"Los Angeles, CA",1287,443,1828,4.0,4/2/2010,"My friend and I decided to go to The Cheesecake Factory because she's never been to one before!  We had a good time.  The food was good, but we spent quite a bit!  The Cheesecake Factory is very consistent in terms of quality of food and service throughout all the ones I've been to.  I had a rumor that food is premade somewhere, but an inside source told me that throughout the chains they have a specific and meticulous way to make the food and that is why the food throughout the chains taste about the same.  Well, the cheesecakes are premade though.  They have a ginormous menu and often times I don't know where to begin!  What you can expect from the servers is quality service and they pretty much memorize the menu.  I'm sure they all try many things from the menu and have good suggestions on what's popular and their personal favorites.  To start, my friend and I had the pomegranate drinks--the mojito and and margarita, which was pretty good.  I liked the mojito better.  We started with the crabcake appetizer.  There's about three of them and it's served with mustard and tarter sauce laid on a garnished plate.  My friend likes ordering crabcakes and she said this was pretty good and it's a lot better than the ones we normally have.   I forget what my friend ordered, but I know it's a shrimp pasta.  I haven't had enough of it to tell you what I think, but one bite was good.   I ordered the Char-grilled cutlet steak made with USDA prime sirloin steak, crispy onion rings, steak butter, and fries for $17.95.  It's one of their affordable steaks and I didn't feel like going all out because we ordered a bunch of food anyhow.  I like my beef cooked medium rare and that's what I got and it was good.   For dessert, we could decide on the cheesecake, but the server brought out the BIG menu they have up front so we could see it.  Actually, my friend wanted to get a cheesecake for her family--she decided on a 7 inch original.  We tried a slice of the Red Velvet Cheesecake, which was pretty big  At that point, we were already full and only had a couple of bites.  I was not going to eat the whole thing because that's about 1500 calories!  I took the cheesecake home and ate bites throughout the whole weekend!  It was delicious...the cake was moist, cheesecake was good.  Yum.   In general, The Cheesecake Factory has good food and great presentation and the food is good and it is consistent throughout the other chains I've been to.  I like the ambiance and the decor and the dim lighting is a nice touch.  I like how it's busy and the servers still pay attention to us and make sure we have everything we need.  I like this location because it's at The Grove.  In general, food is overpriced and it doesn't really stand out for me.  I like how they have a small plates and snacks menu if you're not up for spending too much.  I still like it.  I like the cheesecakes at least!"
Woof W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,32,,5.0,1/9/2015,"Busy. Busy. Busy. That can be good or bad news depending how you view it. Make yourself more than enough time as you will probably be waiting for a table, like everyone else.  There is a solution: inform the host that sitting at the Bar is a acceptable option.  My friend and I do it. Great advantages: Fantastic service from the Bartender.  View the vast shelves of liquors. The designs on some of the bottles is artwork.  No need to feel frustrated with that familiar experience patrons dislike: "" where is the waiter/ waitress?""  Bartenders are customer service friendly.  We had no complaints.  Sometimes it is possible to walk in and make for the stairs straight to the bar yourself.  Sometimes the host will say the bar seats are filled.  That restaurant and bakery are busy due to good food and desserts. Repeat business is a good sign it is worth the visit.  Bad side? Waiting during busy hours. At those times it can sound loud with all the surrounding talk.  It is to be expected. Worth repeated visits. Their bakery has take outs. They have a busy line there. Some good choices sell out fast.  Try to call in advance to inquire if it is possible to make reservations.  Additionally, ask when they have off peak hours to make a trip there to eat.  Yummy."
Angie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,3,5.0,7/3/2015,Food is amazing!!!!! Can never complain!!! Great customer service! So many selections of food!
Yawen C.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",35,97,72,3.0,4/1/2011,"I came here for date night with my bf. Dinner, cheesecake, and a movie! The portions are huge, even the starter salads, that we both barely ate half of our meal. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow! The house salad with balsamic vinaigrette is extremely light on the dressing. A health-conscious individual would like this, but my bf definitely didn't. The caesar salad is slightly better. We also really like their breads, which are nice and soft and warm =) I ordered the CHICKEN BELLAGIO and he ordered the SOUTHEAST ASIAN CARAMEL CHICKEN. The bellagio was definitely better. Nice balance between the pasta, chicken, arugula, and prosciutto. However, the dish as a whole felt really dry; would've been nice if there was some kind of sauce. The caramel chicken felt like high-end Panda stir-fry like orange chicken. The carrots, string beans, onions, and mushrooms tasted alright, but the rice was like Uncle Ben's microwavable rice. And cheesecake? DEFINITELY THE RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. OMG SO GOOD IT MAKES ME WANT TO CRY. Only thing missing is a cold glass of milk :)"
Nathan L.,"West Hollywood, CA",101,13,,5.0,1/21/2015,I can't say enough about this restaurant.The food was delicious and the service was fast.The great atmosphere added so much to the experience.Thumbs up!
Paul R.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,41,1,4.0,4/27/2013,"My favorite location of the Cheesecake Factory. Why? I'm not sure, but there's something special about it. The wait can be a pain. I just take the pager and roam nearby to the Apple Store or Barnes and Noble. My absolute favorite dish is the Grilled Shrimp and Bacon Club with French fries. The sauce really gives it a kick. I'm definitely stuffed after eating the two sandwich halves. If you're in the mood for cheesecake, give the Red Velvet a try. It's worthwhile."
Abo J.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/28/2015,"Big delicious meals and nice environment (but noisy). Make sure to make a reservation before you go because it was very crowded. But if you didn't make one... You may still go and try out as I did, and I got a table for 8 people after some waiting."
Ayoung K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,4.0,11/25/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory at The Grove was a very nice and beautiful restaurant to hang out with my friends. Although there was little long waiting time, it didn't matter, because their services and foods were absolutely fantastic!  I had four cheeses pasta that has very creamy sauce with cheddar cheese. After having this dish, I became a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends when they ask me about the restaurant!"
Sandy P.,"Ontario, CA",51,4,,1.0,10/4/2014,Never had such bad service. Our waiter never came to check on us. He never gave us a refill. We waited over 20 min for our check. Watch out if you get a waiter named Demetri.
Angie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,34,8,1.0,4/7/2014,Ugh! I come here very often. Today I ordered off the skinny menu. I guess they wanted to help me lose some weight because my food came with hair in it.
