Toby I.,"Santa Monica, CA",71,382,,4.0,5/8/2013,"This place is consistent in it's cleanliness, friendliness and food quality.   The workers are generally nice and have yet to have a problem there.  The bathrooms are clean, and I go for lunch so it's almost never crowded.  The host that sat us today was kind of odd as he basically treated us like he was doing us a huge favor.. i know weird right!? All in all I'd still come back to this place :)"
Nat T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,4.0,12/14/2015,Cheescake is always cheescake!!!  You can bet on them with quality and standard they have over the country. My family really enjoy coming to Cheesecake no matter anywhere we go in States then we have to visit one of their branch. Make sure you finish up with tons of selection in cheesecake otherwise you are not there yet!!!
Toddy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,1.0,11/14/2015,Waited 2 hours for a table and were given the shittiest table in the place with no opportunity to wait for another. Wow. Just... Wow.
hasmik a.,"Dana Point, CA",0,14,,1.0,11/14/2015,The reason for one star:  waiter was inattentive.   Although not busy at 2 PM other tables were getting serviced except ours and others seated at the edge of balcony. Our bread was given to the next table since theirs was dropped.  Finally got the bread minus butter after cold food arrived.   The food was good but minimal.  Complained to manager who apologized profusely. They took my number because they wanted to talk to me.  No phone call.  I guess they don't care.
Nelina J.,"Torrance, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/11/2015,Service was terrible. A waiter named dimitri?? Literally threw our bread at us and water AFTER LIKE 15 MINUTES and when he brought it he didn't say a word. And he didn't even bring plates for our bread. He didn't introduce himself say hi or anything. And our food was not as good as when we had the same dishes at other Cheesecake Factory locations. It was an overall unpleasant experience.
Sandy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",258,32,32,5.0,8/14/2014,I love the ambiance and the waiter's are attentive to your needs checking up if you need anything else. I enjoy coming here with friends!  always have a great time.
Eirika H.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,247,26,5.0,6/24/2012,"I love this Cheesecake Factory... Although let me tell you...the wait is LONG! Arrived on a Saturday evening around 9pm, and was told the wait was around 1hr. The great thing about this location is you can kill time by shopping, browsing the Apple Store, or reading books at Barnes & Nobles, or anything, really (within the range of the pager). But it's worth it. The portions here were quite large, in fact, larger than the portions provided at several Cheesecake Factory locations in Northern California.  PASTA DA VINCI. Need I say more? The pasta was cooked just right; the sauce wasn't too saucy or light...just perfect! Unfortunately, this ginormous portion of deliciousness filled me to the extent of not being able to eat a cheesecake... oh well, there's always next time! The service is amazing and our temporary waiter (our actual waitress was on break) was so friendly!  We were able to get our parking validated, and didn't have to pay a cent! Score! Free parking in LA! Free parking (with validation), great service, huge portions, and excellent quality food make this location an absolute must!"
Penny O.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,94,,2.0,8/10/2012,"Came here for dessert, i hate having to wait for dessert (or wait for a table period) Grrrrrrrrr  waited for a table for 20 minutes. I didnt like this location at all. Too noisy and not nice ambient. Service wasnt good. Cheesecake was awesome! but i would skip this location next time."
Carlos L.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",42,8,8,3.0,10/11/2014,"Customer service was bad , but the food was good . But I didn't get my bread and butter .."
Karen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,91,20,4.0,7/22/2014,I come here just once in a while and the service is great. The waitress that helped us was amazing although I felt like she was a bit intimidated my boyfriend because she could look at him. She would only talk to me which was kind of funny.. Anyway she was amazing and I felt sorry for her because she was trying to help so many people at the same time. The only down fall was that the table next to us couldn't stop staring at our table. It was very uncomfortable.. Other then that I could say that my waitress was great. That I recall she had cute little orange hair..
Ericka B.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,8,,4.0,8/27/2013,The Cheesecake Factory is always a winner. No matter where I am on vacation I have to stop and dine at Cheesecake Factory. This restaurant is consistently on par. The wheat bread is delicious as usual and I love the bbq chicken salad. Yummy.   I would of given it 5 stars but the bathroom was so dirty we had to tell the management.
Hwang J.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,4,,1.0,6/7/2014,Last year I dine with my family party of 5. Waitress showed a small table next to the kitchen and seat us down. I asked her that the table was too small and wanted to move to the larger table next to the esclater which was empty then. She said the large table is for party of 7 so we can't be moved. But right after then 4 caucasian people were seated at the large table So I asked the waitress they're only 4 she told me that 3more people will come sooner or later. I trusted her and went to my table. We were waiting for the food at the table next to the kitchen. Few minutes later I saw something crawling around the table...it was a ROACH!!!!! I call the manager and tell him that there is A Roach on the table. He grab the roach and take it away. So I went to the counter to complain...then what I saw was there are still 4 people sitting on the large table! The waitress lied to us cause we were ASIANS!!! I was so upset and never go to cheesecake factory at the grove anymore. disgusting roach and horrible experience.  It's been about 6month ago but still get mad when I see the cheese cake factory at the grove
Christa N.,"Irvine, CA",8,8,10,5.0,3/31/2013,i ordered skinnylicious chicken and mushroom wrap. Yummmmm~~~~!! let me eat that again... l price is reasonable!! customer service good! lovely interior...  everything was awesome!!
D S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,95,,2.0,9/26/2014,"Hard to be positive about Cheesecake.  The things that I used to enjoy or at least accept just aren't that acceptable anymore: 1) The bathroom's are very small.  This is ordinarily a small part of a restaurant experience, but consider the following: a large portion of the people at the Grove are families with small children.  Just go ahead and try washing your child's hands at the single sink in the men's room which they can't reach from the ground, so you have to hoist them up onto the counter.   But wait!   The counter is sopping wet.  So you have to spend a few seconds grabbing handfuls of paper towels to dry it off, or your child will have a wet bottom and things will really go downhill.  So you dry it off, only now the line of men waiting for the sink is growing by the minute.   So I madly try to wash my child's hands, but the only way to do this is one hand at a time, which basically doubles the time it takes.  The line grows longer, with silent looks of annoyance.  So you do the best job you can, a little hurried, but whatever, its ok, kids have dirty hands all the time, right? 2) The restaurant aisles are pretty narrow.  You live in constant fear that a waiter carrying 4 plates of steaming pasta is going to spill it all over your child in the high chair. 3) The food isn't that great.  The menu has about 400 items on it - common sense would dictate that no one can cook 400 items well.  So what you end up with are a bunch of pastas, salads, or deep fried items that are all pretty mediocre.  The only positive here is that the portions are large enough to give an elephant a heart attack.  So you'll have leftovers to feed your child the next day while you try and recover from eating at Cheesecake.  When I was younger I used to like this - but now, I really don't need all the extra mediocre calories. The bottom line - there is no reason to dine here, when the Farmer's Market is right around the corner, is cheaper, and just as noisy."
Rachel L.,"Cerritos, CA",44,38,23,4.0,8/31/2014,When my bestie and I need a little pick me up we will go to cheesecake factory and just get two pieces of cheesecake togo. She usually gets the Duce de leche and I get the Coffee coco one! & they are delicious!!! But if we have time we usually go for lunch for the lunch specials and the portions are HUGE!!
Sean T.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,5,1,5.0,9/22/2015,"This place is awesome ,the food is good ,the service is great ,I like the chicken pasta really good.i highly recommended this place to anyone."
Dianna C.,"Torrey Pines, San Diego, CA",70,12,6,1.0,5/18/2015,"This is absolutely the worst cheesecake factory experience I ever had. I thought the grove would be a nice place too but the experience her was dampened, first, by the rude greeter upstairs at the check-in. I ordered Cajun ""littles"" and I need more sauce shortly after 3 strips and no one came to check on us for 20 minutes. We had to scavenge to look for someone walking by. No one was paying attention. Our server could have gave us a quick check-in but he didn't. But I think they are extremely short staffed. And the server stopped by each neighboring table to serve drinks and take over and didn't once look up to see if we might need something. I understand he has his hands tied but management needs to have additional people walking by to check on tables for him or better train their servers. My sister's water cup is empty and no one offered to refill it yet. And my chicken strips are cold for waiting to get someone's attention to get my another dipping sauce. I'M SO ANGRY about it that I'm sitting her writing this review instead of eating the rest of my meal. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! No one has checked in on us even once!! We are still looking around for people so we can even grab the check. Never ever coming back here ever again! TRASH service"
Khanh D.,"Irvine, CA",1122,21,6,4.0,12/15/2012,"I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory.  With that being said, it is Christmas time and because my sister and I wanted to get into the holiday spirit, we decided to have a pre-Christmas dinner with our brothers. Since we lived in Los Angeles, we thought it would be nice to show our brothers The Grove (they are big hermits so they've never been there before nor have they tried The Cheesecake Factory). Although I expected for us to wait in line before getting seated, we actually got our table pretty quickly. The bread was incredible (you can always ask for more), the food was amazing, and our brothers seemed to really enjoy the place. We even ended the night with two cheesecakes and overall, it was a great experience."
Mehdi M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,11,3,2.0,10/11/2014,"We had filet mignon and shrimp scampi. No resent action, greasy shrimp, ... The quality is okay but not worth the money. It is becoming a high end fast food! Not happy :("
Lisa S.,"Long Beach, CA",1309,1836,312,3.0,10/14/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is usually a safe bet with groups since the menu is so varied and diverse.  Everyone is sure to find a dish of interest, even if it's not the best thing they've ever eaten.  I don't think I've ever been enthusiastic about any dish I've ordered at any location. This time I got the cobb salad.  It was underwhelming, but big.  I substituted sharp white cheddar for blue cheese, and I wish I had gotten mozzarella instead.   The spinach artichoke starter was only mediocre.  It wasn't salty enough.  It was cheesy and oozing, but a little oily and lacking flavor. The boyfriend got some fried and breaded chicken cutlets with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  That was delicious.  I think I'll try getting that next time. Unfortunately, everyone was too full to get dessert.  I am in love with their raspberry white truffle cheesecake, and they now have a red velvet cake cheesecake that looks interesting.  Maybe we can share a dish on our next visit, and then share a cake.  :)"
