William S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,3.0,10/4/2015,"The food is ok, but not great. They didn't do ground pepper for the steak. Steak was not bad,. A little bit dark to read the menu without using the flashlight app. The floor was slippery over a good portion of the restaurant."
Jn M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,5,,2.0,8/17/2014,Ok i'm not really stingy when it comes on giving good reviews the food was good but that bloke was an arse.
candace r.,"Los Angeles, CA",332,242,9,4.0,8/11/2012,"It's been awhile since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory and it seemed like the only familiar place to eat at in The Grove. The wait time was ridiculous for 2 so we went upstairs to see if we could get bar seating. As we're waiting for something to open up, a manager looking lady asked us if we were waiting for a bar table and was super nice about it. She then literally asked this couple to leave who apparently had been sitting there for hours. Our waitress kinda made that whole encounter happen but I was super impressed and grateful that a chain like this would do such a nice thing.  I ordered the Cheesecake Factory chardonnay by Mondavi, avacado eggrolls, and the skinnylicious flatbread. The wine was great and nicely priced. The eggrolls are always amazing and I felt like the portions were bigger than what I remembered (a plus fo sho). Surprisingly, I got stuffed from all the food. I couldn't even finish the flatbread which was pretty small.  Our waitress was super chill and accommodating. Very honest type and not trying to push the menu too much like some of the other Cheesecake's. I like that this restaurant has a nice outdoor eating area that overlooks The Grove. I'm sad I've never been able to eat out there because the wait at this location is always so long. I appreciate that a familiar place like this is at The Grove."
Jasmin G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/3/2014,"I love coming to this Cheesecake Factory. On my recent visit which was on Monday Sept. 29 my service was amazing we got a table in less than 10 minutes and our server was amazing he kept checking up on us and he even gave me a small sample of a new cheesecake they were adding to the menu. I got the avocado egg rolls which were delicious, my dad got the chicken teriyaki which he said was a great choice and my cousin got the Alfredo fettuccine pasta which he loves. Overall I love this place."
Selina S.,"Vallejo, CA",15,23,93,5.0,10/3/2014,"Went there on Dec 2012, the first dinner when arrived in LA. With a group of Chinese student from CUC. The best memory."
Matthew H.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,201,64,2.0,3/14/2014,"I love the Cheesecake Factory, but had a poor experience at this location. The waitress was inattentive and brought out the wrong dish than the one ordered. Obviously the person didn't want to wait for a whole new meal to be brought out and was trying to work with her by asking what the price of the wrong dish was and she said a couple of dollars more. When we got the bill it just so happened that the wrong dish was twice as much as the originally ordered dish. Not okay."
Barry P.,"Fullerton, CA",7,53,2,5.0,9/26/2015,"I give them 5 stars because I go there every Thursday and I see them in action. Even when they are super busy, they make an effort to please the customer. I like that. The waiters and greet staff there are superb. They out-do almost any restaurant that is their peer in LA. I love Cheesecake at the Grove. Great place!"
Noah Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/29/2015,"I won't lie. Our squad can be somewhat difficult to please at times but Sarah straight Steph curried every order we placed. I ordered like 2 dozen of those little blue cheeses and she got every one delivered on point. Respect. Sarah, you the real mvp."
Kelly S.,"Lancaster, CA",66,35,1,2.0,1/16/2013,"For the most part, I like this place. It just seems lately everytime I go something makes me hesitant to come back. The food is good, but inconsistent.  Sometimes it's made absolutely amazing and other times you find yourself wishing you had make another decision. Speaking of decisions, they're menu is absurdly large.  Yes, I like options but not 15+ pages worth..  It takes me longer to look through the menu than to eat my dinner. The wait staff as always been good.  No complaints there. The parking consists of a structure outside the grove.  The Cheesecake factory will validate.  I do appreciate that. The tables can be very close together.  Meaning you can often hear the conversation at the table next to you.  Even once had my water knocked over by a large gesture from a man at table near me.   The wait is going to be long if you go there during the peak hours.  Weekends are going to be the worst but they allow you to walk around the grove while you wait. The cheesecake is fantastic!  Can't deny that!"
Reese D.,"East Bridgewater, MA",18,198,164,4.0,9/11/2012,"Found everything we wanted there. Food is pretty standard. Hey, they r a chain. Why the 4*?Took my mum there for a girls night out dinner. Our server- Mercedes made the experience superb. She was super attentive, very polite, and always drop by to check on us. I have never had a server in any other CF locations who can ensure that my iced tea is consistently filled. Thumbs up on that. We even get to sit on the patio overlooking the crowd below. Another plus."
Cam B.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,30,2,1.0,4/20/2012,::FOOD POISONING:: I hate giving bad reviews but I feel like I need to voice my concern... I have eaten at the cheese cake factory many times and have always had a great experience. I have been to the cheese cake factory's in Newport beach and in Irvine. The food has always been good and tasty. I always get the Shepherds Pie.. Its one of my favorite things on the menu... First I'd like to  start my review by saying that the service at this location was sub par. My coke sat on the table empty and was not refilled until my girlfriend and I were about to leave and our waitress only came by twice... Once to take our order and once to deliver the check.. But that's not why I am writing this review. I am writing this review because after eating my meal I immediately became sick.?! I came in hungry and I left physically ill. The food didn't taste off??  but my immediate physical reaction to the food after consumption and my physical symptoms point to food poisoning.. I will be contacting Cheese Cake Factory in the morning to share my concerns as well as the Los Angeles department of public health. I also wanted to contribute to the other reviews  regarding this specific cheese cake location that are food poisoning related.  I am sincerely disappointed and feel physically horrible after having my meal this evening. I have never had an experience like this before but after reading some of the other reviews regarding food poisoning at this specific cheesecake location I felt the need to share to my experience and thoughts..
Shane H.,"Oceanside, CA",71,115,112,4.0,9/16/2012,"Cheesecake review (not restaurant) Holy hell. When it comes to cheesecake they have it down. They should with their name and all, lol. I've tried multiple cheesecakes they offer with different people. My favorite has to be the Reese's one. So much flavor, if I could eat every savory morsel I would (the slices are giant). Whenever I'm hanging out at the Grove with a friend or family we always have to hit up this place after dinner. It's always worth the price, at least to us. P.S. Would it kill them to turn up the lights even like 5%?"
Liz S.,"Honolulu, HI",107,83,64,3.0,11/24/2012,"A friend and I came here on Black Friday. The wait wasn't too bad because it was just the two of us and during the wait we were able to walk around and shop in the surrounding stores. By the time we came back we were told to go upstairs to be seated. That's one thing I did not like about this Cheesecake Factory, the layout. The check-in area is too crowded for the number of people going in and out and having to go upstairs to be seated is odd, but I guess that's the only way to have a restaurant in the space given. Once we got seated our waiter was quick to take our drink orders and even our food order. But once we placed our orders we never saw our waiter again. I ordered a house salad and the spicy ahi tempura roll. My salad came without dressing so I asked for my dressing and I asked for chopsticks for my tempura roll but when I asked it was another waiter. But the good thing about this place was it was very quick at bringing out our food."
Brianne S.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,46,3,5.0,3/20/2012,"I frequent this Cheesecake Factory frequently with a girlfriend of mine, you could consider us regulars here and it seems like each time we pretty much know what to expect.  Good food, great dessert. Every now and then we'll get a table with a horrible view of the bright white building across the way blinding whoever stars at it, (only at lunch time) but generally speaking you can count on a crowd, lots of chatter - so don't come here to have a quiet meal, but also you can count on generally nice servers and decent service. They get busy, so I kind of have to cut them slack if there's a wait or slower service but you can't down a place for doing something right to draw in a crowd all the time.   Their Red Velvet cheesecake is a must."
Cameron S.,"Los Angeles, CA",144,96,5,4.0,3/14/2013,"When I worked at The Grove, I came here practically every day I worked with other co-workers on lunch. It's a easy place to go to, and always an okay choice for quick, moderately priced food. The happy hour is awesome, $5 Long Islands that will knock you on your tooshie, and the appetizer menu is great. Tons of stuff on it, and some even pass as full meals.  I've never had any issues with the waiters of waitresses, which is nice, but I did have a bad experience once with one of the managers who acted like a complete child after our food hadn't arrived in 45 minutes. The guy sitting next to us had ordered the same thing, and got his food after 20 minutes. The manager said that our item was taking a little bit longer because it was a different variation. It wasn't, they forgot the order, it happens, whatever. The guy tried lying to me to make up an excuse, which was annoying and even ruder when he was called on it. The situation was taken care of with his manager, and I was happy with the solution by the time I had left. I see a lot of the managers also seating people and even taking orders at times, which I really like. The atmosphere is nice, but if you're looking for somewhere quick to eat on a weekend, don't even bother. I have seen the wait time at two hours before. The Ahi Carpacio is my favorite item on the menu."
Ben H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",6,54,2,5.0,12/18/2012,"I've been coming to The Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember, and for the past 10 years my family has been coming here to celebrate birthdays. I might even go so far as to say that this is my favorite restaurant.  This visit was no exception. We arrived in the evening with a group of twelve expecting the wait to be 4 hours or something really long, but we were told that the wait time would be 2 hours. To be honest, I expected this to be the case, but Sarah (the manager), John and Yvette (the host and hostess) were super nice and helped us get seated earlier.  I would discuss the service and food, which was great, but the main reason I wanted to post this review was to praise the staff."
Chey P.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,183,98,4.0,3/28/2014,Hot spinache and cheese dip...it's good but I got so full off of the squaw bread and butter. Very good.
Hazel I.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,9,4,4.0,9/4/2014,"This place is the best! Once you enter, the place is really elegant. The stairs, the tables and just the environment itself is absolutely gorgeous. The server is not too shabby. He checked on us a few times, gave us refills, and made sure we are not left out. The only reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of 'first impression'. The host and hostess look a bit irritated which is not a big deal, but still, they should at least try to be happy."
Craig R.,"San Diego, CA",1854,650,141,4.0,11/1/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a safe bet when you have family in town. Good food, appealing atmosphere, reasonable prices and stellar service from Diana. Diana is preggo and still providing great service with a smile."
Leslie I.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",1,2,1,1.0,3/27/2014,"If I can rate the service at this location a zero I'd gladly do so. I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory but our server ""Kevin A"" was just so slow!! Talk about turtle slow! He seemed utterly clueless about the scope of his job. Several people on our section was just as annoyed as we were because he was lingering around and not being attentive to any of us! I'm appalled that a fine establishment like this will hire incompetent servers like him!"
