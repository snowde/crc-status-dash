Sean P.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,,3.0,9/26/2015,Horrible customer service waited 30 min to get a drink and an hour to get our food. Waitress never acknowledged us after we got our food
Fahad A.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,1,1,1.0,9/25/2014,Today is very bad service shy said 2 hour Waiting list and get me the Table aftr 3 hour
Kim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",451,911,481,3.0,7/18/2012,This is a Cheesecake Factory.  Been to one you have been to all of them except the ones that have unique location like the Cheesecake in Redondo Beach.  This one is crowded and you feel like you are stuffed in a small place compared to most Cheesecake Factories where ample space is the norm.  If you are hungry and you want to wait for a long time for the same damn food then go for it.  My choice is to go the Farmer's Market area and have a little culture and pick your own foods and chill outside.
Al A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,69,2,5.0,5/20/2012,"Beware!!!  This location gets busy!!!! Better yet, every other locations I've been to!!! Why?? My theory is their reputation...good food, great service, clean and inviting atmosphere. Obviously, they only hire the best in the business!!!   Try their avocado roll!!! Shepards pie, damn you're a good dish!! Don't forget the cheesecake for dessert!!  And there are tons of choices,  the servers and hosts and bartenders are freaking awesome as always.  It's unlike any other big corporate restaurants out there...Cheesecake factory never disappoints. It isn't so expensive, and I always get what I pay for!!!"
tae k.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",158,806,6,4.0,7/12/2012,"I was not a fan but after trying a taste of the miso salmon and the spicy chicken sandwich, I was forced to reconsider.  Well done."
Daniel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,9,4.0,7/22/2014,This location is a great place and it's even better for brunch...my gf and I visited this location today and I have to say I wasn't surprised with the customer service except with the girl at the front on her phone which I don't really mind but still makes her look unprofessional to other customers...service was great and food was awesome...the only thing that ruined the date that I had with my gf was the customers there...stare much! Completely rude people who think they're upper class but overall this place was great...would give 5 stars but waitress was more focused on my gf than the fact that she was serving two people
Sam D.,"Las Vegas, NV",334,134,31,4.0,12/20/2011,"This cheesecake factory is like any other, as far as food goes (it's all pretty good.)  The service here is great, we had a really sweet server who put up with my one friend's crap so much and had a smile the whole time (she sends things back a lot, changers her mind about her order after it's been put in, wants TONS of attention from staff, you know the type.)  The only issue is sometimes we come here and we end up at any of the other restaurants in the area because the wait is sooooo longgggg.  I don't know if this has changed but we've always been told that they do not take reservations, which is frustrating because you basically have to take a chance at being able to eat here whenever you come.  The set up is great, and there is a nice outdoor patio where you can eat as well."
Lisa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,12,14,2.0,6/29/2014,"As soon as I walked in to the cheesecake factory I already felt descriminated by the hosts (or whoever the girls are that take you to your table).They were looking at me and my bf from head to toe they didnt great us properly as they did to the others. It only got worse the waitress was not polite, as soon as we got our food she kept coming to our table every 15mins asking if she can put the food in a box we kept telling her ""no thank you we are still working on it"" out of no where she placed the bill on the table and said ""whenever your ready"".  The food was not worth the wait the chicken alfredo pasta was dry as fuck it doesn't hav that creamy texture nor taste. It was a really big disappointment because that day we were celebrating our 3yr anniversary with my bf, I was expecting it to be a relaxing and romantic lunch instead it was very displeasing and it made us feel out of place. When I thought all this racias crap was put behind us. I thought it was only this location so I gave cheesecake factory another chance so I went to the ones in Pasadena and americana ordered something different each visit and the same situation happened I felt rushed and descriminated. The only goood thing about this place is the cheesecakes the oreo one is to die for mmmmmmmmm."
Brian D.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,8,2,1.0,6/22/2014,Horrible they told me the wait was gonna be 3 hours and I was alright with that they asked for my phone number so when my table was ready they would text me I waited 4 hours without a text and I'm not a person to complain so I waited patiently and was never called my family was furious so we just left and I made the table reservation around 9pm
Chibi T.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,10,87,4.0,5/31/2014,"Steak Diane and herb crusted salmon. Along with arugula salad. Mmm, mmm!"
Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,4.0,8/4/2012,Herb Crusted Fillet of Salmon Avocado Egg Rolls Those damn mashed potatoes!! Huge portions Great view! Love the wheat bread.
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,148,2,4.0,4/24/2013,"Always have a great time when I go to this location. There is a good variety of food and you can always find something. They usually have good service but when it gets really crowded be aware that you will be ignored at times.  Overall, great place to eat with a very good selection."
Tina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,48,2,5.0,5/24/2014,"I gave this restaurant a five star review for the overall experience that I had in the past years. The service + the decor + the food + the ambiance + cleanness + the price + the location + the access = excellence. I would accredit the success of the restaurant to the manger/owner, who really have kept it up nicely. I especially enjoy going there with my young kid. The staff make sure to accommodate the family with stroller. For the singletons, there is the bar area, where the cool and young hang out. In this busy town, this place continue to provide a decent dining experience at an affordable price for people of all ages.  I recommend it!"
Maryam M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,23,14,5.0,7/8/2012,"I love their Sunday Brunch. It's been a while since I've come by for this, but wow I was delighted today. I LOVE the Eggs Benedict! They added spinach, tomato, and bacon to the mix! The hollandaise sauce was creamy and very flavorful. The hash browns were as dark and crunchy as I ordered them. I didn't feel like a mimosa this morning so I went w something a little stronger. Passion Fruit Mojitos!!! Delicious! I'll probably be back for a redux next week!!  I highly recommend their Sunday Brunch! It's less than $50 for everything before tip."
Alyssa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,1,2.0,6/27/2015,"I haven't had any issues with the service here, employees and food are always great, but I am giving 2 stars because they do not accept reservations and it is absolutely ridiculous to wait an hour and a half for a table every time I come here. Nobody has time for that."
Cecilia S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,,3.0,10/29/2012,"This review is about my first time here. Got there around 10pm and wasn't sure how to ask for a table because the hosts were NOT helpful at all. One of them finally gave me one of those ""beepers"" that flashes and vibrates when your table is ready. We asked him if it would be okay to go to the Barnes and Noble nearby and he said yes. Our wait was 35 minutes. So about 45 long minutes later we made it back to the restaurant. I was STARVING and I asked the host if our table was finally ready. He said that he had called but we didn't show up. Now, either the beeper thing had to be broken or he didn't call because I was so hungry that I didn't let that thing out of my sight and I know that as soon as the thing flashed I would have run over there to get some food.  So after waiting 5 more minutes, we get sent up and again the hosts are not helpful. I tell another male host I got called for my table and he said in a condescending tone ""oh your table CALLED? you WANT a table or you're here for a reservation?"" WHAT?!?! That jerk. It's not my fault I've never been to the place and I'm a little lost. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, the food was REALLY good. I had the fettucine alfredo with chicken. I'm a fatty so a couple more chunks of chicken would have been good, and the servings were huge, big enough for two. I noticed though that the pasta I took home was drenched in oil when I microwaved it.  Drinks were awesome, especially the sour apple martini.  The food is great but I feel like it's way overpriced. I wouldn't consider this place fancy, seeing as people show up dressed in their jeans and hoodies (myself included) but the prices sure are over the top. It's alright, over all."
J T.,"Fontana, CA",4,93,40,1.0,5/11/2014,I called and asked them how much a 11 person wait would be right now. They said I had to come in. I understood but I wanted to get an idea. I personally came in after I valet and they told me 4 hrs. No one is going to wait four hours. THey should of respectfully told us that  over the phone when I called.
Michael D.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",30,87,1,3.0,4/4/2012,"A friend convinced me to go. I don't know how she does it, but every time I go to LA she insists on going to a chain restaurant instead of something local. The food is what you expect from a chain. The service is what you expect. The drinks are what you expect. Why are you even reading this? You know what to expect."
Joyce S.,"Culver City, CA",439,25,10,3.0,11/22/2012,"I love the Cheescake Factory! A lot. Like, A LOT. However, this location always seems to be crowded and busy, which causes a huuuuuge line and the service to take forever. The food? Excellent. I always order the same dish just because I know it's delicious. Four cheese pasta with chicken. Yum.  Is it a little pricey? Not too bad. I'm 16 and pay my own meals and it's around 17 dollars once I split the cost with my friends. That's decent for good food. We ended up waiting 45 minutes to get in, and then around 30 for our food to come. That's why I deducted 2 stars."
Evelyn G.,"Rosemead, CA",0,15,,1.0,3/26/2012,"I'm generally okay when my waiter needs to have someone take over their tables, but not in this case. The replacement waiter had only 3-4 tables on the small patio to take care of. I was with just one friend and she LITERALLY IGNORED US; I was trying to get her attention for a refill and she tended to the table of four the most, maybe because they generate more money or tip...idk. She kept asking the other tables if they were doing ok and failed to even make eye contact with us!!  When we were ready for our check, she gave us the wrong one and TOOK OFF FOR 10-15min!!! We just sat there, waiting...eventually she gave us the correct reciept after we told her. It took a total of 25 minutes just to pay.  BOTTOM LINE: DONT SIT ON THE TABLE OF TWO AT THE PATIO. POOR SERVICE."
