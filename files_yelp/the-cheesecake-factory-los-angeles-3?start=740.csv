Brandon H.,"Fountain Valley, CA",101,14,8,2.0,1/5/2014,"The waiter paid us no attention, put chicken on our pasta when we said no, brought our appetizer with the entree, and never offered us cracked pepper.  The chicken tasted frozen in our pasta with no seasoning."
Francesca B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",7,24,,3.0,8/22/2011,"I suppose you don't come here looking for small portions, or anything healthy, but I was surprised that they did have a few ""small plate"" options for people who aren't looking for a ton of food. I split an order of tamale-style corn cakes with my husband which were very moist and delicious. We also had an order of orange chicken which was crispy and flavorful, but greasy.  As for the service, we were seated pretty quickly (within 10-15 minutes or so) even though it seemed very crowded. Our waited wasn't overly friendly, but efficient. We asked for waters along with our cocktails, but had to ask twice for them. He was so busy, I almost felt bad for asking for anything..  Its probably best to come here during a non-high peak time, as I can see where the wait might get crazy and the service quality would dip down as well."
Shawn M.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",1073,91,32,2.0,12/23/2013,"Been sitting here forever & they still haven't brought me my food! They also waited 15 mins before even asking me if I wanted anything, the bus boy got me service and the best part is it's 11:00am, so it's empty & I'm still waiting!! Def not coming to this Cheesecake Factory again!!"
Xuan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",220,250,229,4.0,7/15/2009,"When you head to the Cheesecake Factory, let's assume their specialty involves cheesecake. So, needless to say that I had no interest in 80% of their menu.  I looked around  at the surrounding tables and saw people feasting on large portions of pastas and salads and sandwiches.  I sat there flabbergasted.  Shouldn't the focus be dessert? I can safely give this place 4 stars because I only sampled their desserts.  I chose the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake with coffee and my boyfriend decided on having the warm apple crisp.  Both desserts were presented to us in ginormous portions and 2 extra plates for sharing. We engorged ourselves in delicious refined sugar.  The cheesecake was fantastic.  The balance between chocolate and coconut was juuuuuust right.  Not too sweet, and yummy enough to make you crave an extra bite even though you already busted a button.   The warm apple crisp was also good, especially since it was served toasty and a la mode.  But for some reason, I wasn't exactly dazzled by it.  I guess it's because the flavors are so traditional and expected.  It's hard to be pleasantly surprised by something that was essentially an apple pie. This is a great place to go for a sweet treat.  Some may think it strange to go to lunch/dinner in one restaurant and then dessert someplace else.  But, I think it's always better to go to an establishment based on their strengths.  If you go to a steakhouse, don't order the chicken.  If you go to the cheesecake factory, don't order the sandwich."
Molly K.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,17,,3.0,3/22/2012,"Two and a half hour wait?!  I love Cheesecake Factory, but every time I have tried to go to this one, the wait has been over an hour long.  The last time I went, we were told the wait would be over two hours, so we left.  I'm sure she was just stressed from the sheer volume of people, but the hostess was not very friendly. On the upside, the food is delicious.  I recommend the red velvet cheesecake and the sweet corn tamale cakes."
Greg A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,19,,3.0,8/23/2015,"*ELEVATOR ISSUE*  This morning my wife and I took our 5-month old child to the Grove for brunch.  We used the elevator from the lobby because we had the baby in a stroller.  When the elevator reached the second floor it abruptly jolted, made a huge bang and dropped about 5-10 inches.  The elevator repeated this sequentially about 7 times.  It then got quiet for a second - I told my wife i thought we were stuck - and then the doors opened.  We were not injured, the baby was not hurt but it was scary (SERIOUSLY).  It frightened me enough that when I got off I couldn't control my laughter mostly because it really scared the crap out of me.  My wife was not amused.  For context: I've had the misfortune of being stuck in an immobilized elevator for about three hours in college and it didn't bother me one bit.  I am not claustrophobic and am generally a calm person.  Whatever this elevator was doing was no-joke scary.  My issue however; is not with the elevator - it is with the nature of which our reporting it was summarily dismissed as if it were not to be taken seriously.  I am no elevator expert but it could be a serious safety concern and it needs to be checked by a licensed elevator service repairman.  My wife reported it to the hostess who seated us.  To be fair, I was laughing becuase I was relieved that I didn't do a Final Destination into the ground floor but I, too, reiterated to the hostess that something was really wrong with the elevator and nobody should be using it until it gets checked.  The hostess was young and may have not fully grasped what we were relaying so we, again, reiterated to her that this was not funny and needed to be addressed.  She immediately acknowledged this and took it more seriously when we insisted we weren't joking and she began to report it to her manager (I think it was the manager) who just dismised her entirely and said something to the effect of, ""yeah I will check it just get these people seated.""  The manager's dismissal was wholly unprofessional for the following reasons:  1.  We were complaining to a hostess of probably 18 years old who was clearly not the person to handle this complaint and when she escalated it to her manager - the woman (a blonde in her mid to late 40's) did not say one word to us.  She was more worried about getting the brunch crowd seated than a potentially serious safety complaint.  At the time there was nobody else waiting.  She had time to address us and chose not to.  2. We had a baby in a stroller on the elevator.   Nobody said, ""hey we are sorry, let us check that out"".  It would have at least been small comfort that the next person wasn't going to get demolished by a broken elevator.  3. The manager could not have cared less and never asked us to specifically describe what happened.  Just usher us on to the table and back to work.  I did see the manager go get on the elevator, I think ride it down and back up.  She got off and that was that.  Never a question about specifically what went wrong, what was she looking for, etc... We sat for the next few minutes discussing how sad it would be if someone got seriously injured on the elevator because nobody was listening.  We relayed the information to the couple who joined us a few minutes later and eventually got on with our meal.  I'd like to make sure whoever reads this understands that my complaint is not with the hostess or the elevator problem itself - but with the casual dismissal that the manager gave in not caring the least about a potential safety issue.  Unless she is some kind of qualified elevator technician - her riding it up and down once hardly counts as checking it for a safety issue.  Please have someone that checks this kind of thing (probably have one that works for the Grove, it's a huge place) look into this ASAP. As an aside - about my dining experience: 1. My coffee was luke-warm when I got the first cup.  Whatever, it tasted fine, I drank it and usually finish a cup of coffee by the time it's reached room temperature anyway.  I do have my doubts as to whether or not it was made this morning.  It's been in a mug or pot overnight and was slightly warmer than tap water.  When it was refilled it was the proper temperature of a fresh cup of coffee.  This it NOT a complaint as I really don't mind, just an observation for Quality Control. 2. When seated my table was greasy with butter streaks.  It's not likely someone already had a meal since this location only opens 25 minutes before we were seated so whoever wiped the table down did not go a good job.  I had to use my napkin to wipe off the butter streaks.  It was clear someone with a seriously dirty table cloth had wiped it off but was still super gross to set my arms in butter streaks.  This was the only uncool part of my actual dining experience. I did not complain to anyone about this and wiped it up myself - also not a huge deal as I am not a little baby. 3.  Our waiter was great.  A young guy, super cool."
Shuai Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,5,,5.0,1/2/2013,"though I've been there for only once, I hear about the restaurant all the time, I was really impressed by the food there, I love it!  Parking is very convenient in the parking structure of The Grove, and luckily we sat outside on the balcony which has great vision and fresh air. The pasta that I ordered was tasty and I like the source, also the cheesecake was really delicious! The atmosphere is kind of romantic and makes you feel really comfortable, a great place for lovers~"
Giselle P.,"Los Angeles, CA",264,109,133,4.0,5/18/2013,"I like the Cheesecake Factory. I have never had a bad experience here. The menu is very extensive so there is something for everybody. The food is great, the drinks amazing, the place is clean and the staff is friendly. Great place to come with the family or with your friends. The only thing I don't like about the Cheesecake Factory is the long wait but since I already know its busy I always give myself time to do a little shopping or just walk around the beautiful Groove enjoying a nice sunny day."
Marvin I.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,21,1.0,12/20/2013,"The worst experience, almost 1 hour and 30 mins waiting to just to get a plate of food. Just to find out they give you some ugly section of the restaurant where people are always walking and bumping into you. The hosts are okay and host in charge of sitting people ignored me when I asked to be switch to another table. Sarcastically, tell me that I looked very hungry and simply walked away. I took off after waiting 30 more minutes just for the person to take my order. Never coming back to this place again!!!"
Jennifer N.,"Long Beach, CA",444,1095,12255,3.0,5/3/2011,"I LOVE Cheesecake Factory, But I HATE this location!!!! The wait is forever (so thank God we can go shopping, but who wants to go shopping when they are hungry :-(   The location is small and the Utensils are filthy! Favorite dishes of mine are the Bistro Shrimp Pasta- YUM! Thai Chicken Pasta! (This can be a hit and missed depending on the chef. I like  mine kind of dry with flavor. Sometimes, it comes a bit too much sauce and washed down. It tastes soggy.) Chinese Chicken Salad is one of the best I've tried so far! :-)"
TheLaborLawGuy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,201,17,3.0,11/15/2013,"I had lunch here the other day and ordered the grilled salmon glazed with BBQ sauce.  It was really good!  This dish was my favorite dish at the Grande Lux Cafe, which sadly  shuttered.  It's not on the menu here, but our waiter gladly urged me to order it anyway explaining the kitchen will recreate it for me.  Although it wasn't 100% the same, the salmon was really good anyway.  My lunch could have been a 5 star experience but it became rather unpleasant when another waiter brought food for us that we didn't order and then asked us 5 times if we were sure. When we told him firmly that we didn't order it, our waiter came over and those two started fighting in front of us totally ruining our lunch."
Karen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,5.0,7/29/2014,"The best place to try a cheese cake. My favorites ones: Mango (It has mango, passion fruit, coconut in the base, lemon pay), Oreo and Banana. Delicious."
Grant H.,"Los Angeles, CA",46,60,8,3.0,5/31/2011,"I'm not sure many really need a review of CF at this point. You know what to expect: decent/good food, gigantic menu/selection, and a 45min wait for a table. But I wanted to give a heads-up to my gluten free people: Your waiter will likely get a manger for you to come by and explain what they can offer you in terms of GF food. The only issue I ran into was that this manager wasn't aware that cooking veggies in pasta water would give a celiac a reaction. I politely informed him of the danger and I didn't end up getting sick from my chicken (without marinade, which has soy sauce) and sauteed  veggies.  (Also, apparently, they'll be rolling out a GF menu at all locations before the end of 2011.)"
Nick S.,"Washington, DC",74,1592,1954,3.0,8/2/2011,"I went here the night Deathly Hallows: Part 2 opened to kill some time before the midnight showing. Since the Cheesecake Factory is open an hour later than most other restaurants in the Grove, it was packed. It took about 50 min to get a table, but the service was very friendly and almost inappropriately quick. Like, too fast for people trying to burn two hours before a movie. Unfortunately, I can only rate the food here as ""meh"". Cheesecake has a huge, diverse menu, but I feel like they never really nail anything perfectly, minus the cheesecake. Everything is just ""good"" or ""ok"". Still, it's cheaper than the other options in the Grove (once the market is closed) and there's bound to be something you like on the menu."
Miryam F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,24,,5.0,6/27/2015,"My parents were visiting from Florida and I brought them here for a late lunch on Father's day.  It took us over an hour to get our table, but once we sat down we had a great lunch.  The food took a fairly lengthy time to get to us, but without us saying a word the server came and told us he let his manager know about the wait and we could order Cheesecake on them.  The food was DELICIOUS with big portions as usual.  Once we were finished, the server presented us with the desert menu and we ordered two slices which never appeared on our bill.  The manager and server were truly doing their best on such a busy day.  I will absolutely go back!"
Jenn M.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,41,370,2.0,6/17/2012,"went here on a weekday after work to have appetizer's and a drink. Fork on my table was dirty. Not wanting to cause a scene or bother a waiter/waitress I replace the fork with the one on the next table. Next thing I know I was getting screamed at by this waitress on another table 'to just giver her the fork.' First of all, you don't scream at a GUEST. Too bad, I didn't get her name. Second, whoever did the table preparation FAILED by not checking the utensils.   Uncalled for and unacceptable."
Skippy G.,"Mokelumne Hill, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/25/2015,"Love this place had a little incident my daughter is allergic to dairy the waiter Dimitri was amazing he was kind and so understanding he did his best, this was not his fault..... just wanted to bring him home with us, he was  that kind, and for the first time I felt like someone who really understood us and actually cared... next time when you go to the Cheesecake Factory ask for Dimitri he will treat you like family. This is my favorite cheese cake factory.. the manager was great the food always top shelf."
Katy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",168,256,12,3.0,4/16/2012,"Not one to visit a Cheesecake Factory, per say.  That is until a few weeks back some friends and myself agreed to meet here.   So we come an there is a huge line of people holding the little beeper thing waiting to be beeped and called to sit.  So we too stand around, not quite in the sam line, but we wait around until we get beeped.   We are seated upstairs on the balcony and everyone orders drinks and we are brought bread basket and everyone eats the bread.   We order food some 30 min later.  We were taking our time with ordering; no one could decide what to eat.   Food comes out about 30 min later.  We are cool with that.  We were too busy chatting.   Servers come to take our plates.  No one is done with food.  So server leaves.   Servers come around again about 20 min later to refill our drinks.  No one wants to let go of their plate.  So we sit and chat some more. An hour passes.  Waiter is leaving for the day.  A new waiter is serving us. He comes to our table every 20 min.  We still don't want to give up our plates.  Finally, about another hour passes.  This waiter wants us out.  Brings us boxes.   We order dessert.  Needless to say, I don't  know why we didn't want to leave but we over stood our welcome.   We took our time eating dessert and paying our bill.  The bill was pretty high, so whats the rush?  Again-What's the rush, Cheesecake Factory? Geesh!"
Gabie R.,"Wilshire Center, Los Angeles, CA",72,12,6,4.0,5/4/2014,Two hour wait is extremely ridiculous. I end up spending more money than expected to just because of the two hour wait! The waiters are so polite and always on top of your orders. The food is always delicious. A little pricey but not too bad. I don't mind going there on a casual movie night.
Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,69,77,3.0,7/29/2013,"This was only about my third or fourth time eating at the Cheesecake Factory, despite having lived ten minutes away for my whole life. As a large national chain restaurant, I feel it's quite overhyped, but it does have its advantages. I tried to organize the pros and cons from my limited Cheesecake experiences: PROS 1. professional and friendly service. excellent, especially for a large corporation chain. they cater to your preferences as best they can; I once asked for a different type of pasta in my dish and they were very open to substitutions/requests.  2. the free unlimited bread. I personally like the white french bread with olive oil and butter (the waiter will give you the olive oil if you ask), but many of my friends prefer the slightly sweeter brown bread.  3. the wide variety of food for a relatively decent price. steaks, pastas, salads, soups, desserts -- there are almost too many options.  CONS 1. can be a long wait. avoid mealtimes and you'll be able to get in within half an hour or so.  2. very dark inside. my eyes always hurt from straining to see my food and the faces of the people I'm speaking with. may make for an intimate setting with a date, but not really apt for large parties or families. 3. the extensive menu does include some faulty dishes; it's a hit or miss type of thing. here are the ones i've tried and still remember: Steak Diane - good beef with a good mushroom sauce, tastes superb cooked medium rare.  Shrimp Scampi - large shrimp with a slight crunch in a citrus, garlic sauce  Chicken lettuce wraps - nothing special, just some chicken and vegetables wrapped in lettuce with a sauce commonly found in Mexican places. my mom really likes them; they're meant to be appetizers, but can serve as a light meal. the lettuce adds a nice refreshing crunch when you're not ordering salad. Spicy chicken chipotle pasta - not spicy at all, actually sort of sweet. the sauce gets cold pretty quickly, and you're left with a clumpy mess of a dish.  Jambalaya pasta - the spices' balance is pretty good, but gets cold and nasty quickly as well. I don't recommend the pasta dishes here.  Original cheesecake - very good; after all, they get their name from this signature dish.  Tiramisu cheesecake - DIDN'T HAVE A GRAHAM CRUST!! i felt cheated. the tiramisu cake part was merely eh, and the cheesecake part wasn't as superb as the original cheesecake. the chocolate mousse/whipped cream on top made the dessert extremely decadent and sweet. I would stick to the basic cheesecake.  Sundae - got a free sundae on my birthday; there was only a spoonful of extremely sweet vanilla ice cream buried under a LOT of whipped cream and sitting on top of black chocolate fudge. it was free, but didn't feel like a big deal.                                               Sides - tried the fries, salad, and mashed potatoes; all are decent. just some of my thoughts on a much reviewed restaurant."
