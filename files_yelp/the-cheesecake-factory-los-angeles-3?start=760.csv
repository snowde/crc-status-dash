Basabdatta R.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,5,,2.0,12/9/2011,"Very bad service. Wait time is too long. Staff is rude and unprofessional. Its almost as if theyr doing you a favour by serving you food, a service im paying them for.Not to mention they are always crazy crowded and the staff seem incapable of handling so many customers at once. This is ok for brunch or carry out (cheesecake) Save your money and go to the cheesecake factory in Glendale in americana."
Rebecca P.,"Seattle, WA",241,761,95,1.0,9/30/2011,"Okay, unless you're getting the cheesecake or have friends who lack taste buds and wish to have dinner, go elsewhere. By all means, you won't get sick or anything, but I would venture elsewhere given the price and quality of the food.  I arrived with a rather large group of semi-family visiting from the areas around Los Angeles, presenting the Grove as a midway meet-up. We all ordered what sounded like wonderful dishes, taking the advice of our server when needed. After a reasonable wait, our dishes came out, a seeming panoply of American gluttony (and steaming goodness). Now, as a large group, one might decrease their expectations of the quality of the food, given that it's difficult to serve big masses. But, given that we were paying for entrees in the upper teens, I expected a bit more than monotony. Specifically, everything somewhat tasted the same. My dish of the chicken madeira ($17.50, recommended by the server as ""the most popular chicken dish"") failed to please. It was extremely salty, and after about three bites, nearly everything tasted the same--my chicken, the potatoes, the asparagus, etc. So, I nibbled off my neighbors' plates to try to cut the monotony and found that their food (lemon herb roasted chicken, $16.95, and four cheese pasta, $13.95) was quite mediocre and homogeneous in flavor as well.  The ambiance, however, was fine. A bit loud, but bustling with energy and surrounded by a fun outdoor area (the Grove). And, as mentioned, the cheesecake is good. Not as amazing as the cheesecake I got growing up from this little hole-in-the-wall in upstate New York, but better than most places on this coast. So, at least they put their money where their mouth, living up to their name--and almost making me bump my rating up to a 2... almost."
Nick L.,"San Gabriel, CA",86,2,,1.0,1/2/2014,Oh! By the way! This is the first time I'm writing Yelp review after using Yelp for so many years! And I'm a waiter myself too! This restaurant's service is no accepted at all!
Errinn B.,"La Mesa, CA",49,88,13,2.0,11/9/2013,"We went there for my fiancée's birthday, and most decent restaurants give/offer something for the birthday guest, well don't expect any niceticites from the money grubby bastards at the cheese cake factory. We had a large party, which no doubt would cover anything for a birthday guest. The only reason this review has two stars is I am in love with the ahi tuna tapa. The waitress was not attentive to our table, and we had to ask passerbys for assistance. Ugh!"
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,156,32,5.0,6/18/2012,"This is one of my favorite cheesecake factories. The food and service are both great. I love sitting on the balcony at night because there is a nice view. It does get a little crowded on friday nights, but I think that's to be expected. I have been during the day, at night, and later in the evening and I always have attentive service and good food.They handled the crowds well and we did not wait any longer than they told us we would. You are given a pager and you can shop a few stores down while you wait. I love their lunch menu.  You can go upstairs to order take out, and their tea is fantastic if you want to get something quick to drink."
Sarah S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,28,6,5.0,4/18/2014,I went here with my 2 month old and my 4 year old before taking pictures with the Easter bunny and it being a Friday had us waiting for a good half hour.  The hostess was really sweet which seems to be getting to be a rare thing.  Brandon was our server and he was great!  We were greeted by him within a minute of being seated and had drinks in no time.  I got the lemon garlic shrimp off the skinny menu and it was so good.  I wanted to compare the nutrition to my usual pick which was more then twice the calories.  Brandon was kind enough to bring me a nutrition menu.  Simple things like a smile can go a long way when you sit down at such a busy restaurant and the food and service were the best I've ever had at any TCF location!
Lucy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,1418,6065,4.0,2/8/2011,"How can I ever turn down Cheesecake Factory?  It's impossible really - there's something for everyone on that ginormous menu, and it's all good.  Plus, their desserts are AWESOME!  The only thing is that the wait is usually an hour or more at all the locations. However not when I came to this location for the first time late on a Monday evening.  We walked in and requested a booth, and one magically opened up for us immediately!  Nice! We both knew that we wanted a ribeye, and STAT because we were starving.  So instead of searching through the book that is their menu, we asked our server for a recommendation when took our drink orders.  She pointed out the ribeye on the menu, and we were SOLD - that was easy! Or so we thought..... A few minutes after we placed our orders, she came back to tell us that they had just sold out of their last ribeye.  Seriously??  On a Monday night?? What we ended up getting was fine, but after anticipating a ribeye, this was somewhat of a booby prize: Filet Mignon - served with steamed broccoli and a couple of onion rings (not strings, as it originally says) it was fine.  But to me, this cut is just not as flavorful due to the lack of marbling.  It did satisfy my need for meat though! Carne Asada Skirt Steak - served with rice, beans, choice of corn or flour tortillas, and sour cream/salsa/guac.  The steak was tender and flavored with a slightly sweet marinade, and my friend liked it a lot.  I ate the sour cream and guac : P. We couldn't resist dessert, so we got: Key Lime Cheesecake - really good, limey tart-sweet cheesecake! Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake - OMG YUM!  A pineapple-y cheesecake layer between layers of Pineapple Upside Down cake - texturally SUPER moist and creamy all together, and separately delicious.  This was a dessert that I could have eaten a barrel full of had my thighs not screamed for mercy!   We had also ordered decafs with dessert, but when they never arrived we asked our server if we were getting any.  She looked at us without so much as a hint of recognition and said, sure - she'd bring some.  By that point, we were done with dessert so we changed our minds an declined as soon as we asked for it.  It still would have been nice to see a flicker of a memory of our order however : /. Cheesecake Factory in general is very good - so yes, I'd come back if seating happened this quickly again.  I just hope they have more ribeyes next time!"
Charlene W.,"West Hollywood, CA",88,82,,2.0,6/8/2012,"My friend took me and a friend  here for our birthdays. I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in a few years. My joke is I never actually get cheesecake because the portions are so huge that there is no room for dessert and today was no exception.   Fried Zucchini was yummy but the zucchini seemed a little undercooked. One friend had ice water but it was way more ice than water so we had to remove the ice and put it on the bread plate and remind whoever was refilling to chill (ha! get it!?! I made a pun) on the ice. I had the chicken enchiladas...they were just ""meh"".  I was drinking soda water with lime and one of the staff just assumed I was drinking Sprite so that was gross when I tasted my watered down Sprite expecting plain soda water. My friend seemed to like her salad (can't remember which one she got) and my other friend liked the samosas. They sang happy birthday to us (which is horrifying to me but my other friend loved it) and gave us a wee little dessert which was unexpected and nice. Spencer was a great server but overall, the experience didn't knock my socks off."
Anton E.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,1153,670,1.0,9/29/2013,"food is so overrated and not worth it ordered the Chicken Milan or something; huge plate came out with 2 large flattened pieces of chicken, breaded and pan fried, a huge mound of steamed broccoli, and i asked for sweet potato fries instead of mashed potatoes. the chicken was bland, lemon was sour, cream was meh broccoli had no seasoning or flavor whatsoever, sweet potato fries were good tho service was lacking too; our first server disappeared, had 3 different servers ask if we ordered drinks, then a 4th to take away our plate...and no this wasn't a group serving thing, this was each server not knowing which table belongs to who 1 star for having good cheesecakes from previous experience"
Jesse S.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,111,31,5.0,3/24/2014,"First time coming to the Cheesecake Factory ever.  So much food to choose from it's incredible. It all looked SO good too. I ended up going with a Chile Relleno Burger which was delicious.  There was a long wait but service was great, food came pretty quickly and our waiter was awesome and constantly keeping track of us. The cheesecake selection is out of this world, I've never seen so many things I want to try  (similarly to the menu!).  Overall it was great. You can't go wrong coming here."
Marlene B.,"Lake Forest, CA",58,17,26,5.0,6/4/2012,You can get anything it seems at this restaurant. The red velvet cheesecake is to die for.
Jeffrey K.,"Los Angeles, CA",91,290,20,2.0,3/14/2012,"I came to Cheesecake Factory for my mom's birthday with my family. After a ridiculous 45 minute wait on a freakin Thursday, we were finally seated.  It took an extremely long time for the waiter to take our order, but it seemed like he tried his best to give us some attention. This place looked very busy. So after a 45 minute wait, we waited 20 minutes for our order to be taken, and then another 25 minutes for our food to come out. So an hour and a half wait to eat. Most of my family and I ordered pasta. I ordered the special jambalaya, which was decent. My fatty side loves all of the meat in it and it was huge. The downside of the pasta was it's lack of spice and flavor. There wasn't as much flavor I'd hoped for in the pasta. Some of the other pastas I tried had the same exact problem. A lot of meat, a lot of pasta, but not much sauce. The appetizers were okay as well. All in all, it was a decent dinner, with a ridiculously long wait. Without the wait, I'd probably give it 3 stars, but the wait was so atrocious especially on a Thursday, that I can not see how people think Cheesecake Factory is worth it for the price and wait. Don't come here unless you're forced. Like I was. Fatty in me loves the serving size, but hated almost everything else."
Logan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,31,,4.0,5/1/2013,The only bad thing I can say about this restaurant is the wait times. Every time I come here is absurdly long even if there are only a few people ahead of us. The food is pretty decent; can't say I'm in love with it though. Decent dining experience though it's not exactly my place to go.
Laia B.,"Barcelona, Spain",2,5,4,4.0,5/25/2014,"I have only one thing to say: their Garlic Noodles (with shiitake mushrooms, tomato, parmesan sauce...) are A M A Z I N G."
Lala L.,"Tarzana, CA",114,74,21,3.0,3/17/2015,"WOW! How hard is it to make mashed potatoes? ? I ordered the herb crusted salmon, mashed potatoes,  and asparagus.  The MP had big chunks of hard potatoes that were not cooked. How could they not feel that when mashing it up? CF is usually pretty consistent with good food. This time i was surprised.  I asked for more. The waitress brought more. These had big chunks too. Not as bad but still not cooked all the way as it should have been. Just a bad batch i guess.. Everything else was good tho"
Brian B.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,274,,4.0,4/28/2014,Huge menu and large portions of good food. Service is always excellent. This is a busy location so plan ahead for a wait. highly recommend!
Goli F.,"Torrance, CA",0,12,1,3.0,6/21/2014,We were there last night and I had shibashi steak food was very good But our problem was with service no waiter to clean the table he was on brake for half hour he brought the food and was gone nobody came to check  On us most of the time we were looking for a waiter to ask for something  For me and family last time cheese cake factory in the grove.
Katherine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,253,66,2.0,4/1/2011,"I prefer quality over quantity, and when it comes to Cheesecake Factory they overwhelmingly prefer the latter.  Even their ""smaller portion"" lunch specials are ridiculously large!  It's a whole trough of mind-numbingly boring, bland food.   One star for corn fritters and good cheesecakes.  One star for friendly-enough service."
LeAnna H.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,161,33,3.0,7/17/2011,"Ok, so usually i avoid Cheescake Fact and other similar chains like the plague. I always seem to be only mildly satisfied with my meal after a 2 hour wait, and then i give into the expensive indulgent cheesecake at the end to cheer myself back up and make up for the weird chicken i had. but, this time was different. this time, it was Happy Hour!  I am a Happy Hour Hora. Their happy hour is from 4-6 and everything was $5 bucks!  Me and my fellow unemployed friend were just in time to start it off! (Isn't it sad and ironic that working people can never really enjoy happy hour hours?).  I digress, the food and drinks were delish. Bar section only. Service was solid.  Drinks: I had the J.W Pink Lemonade and it was GIGANTIC.  I also tried to change it up with the cosmo but it was too late.  My friend had the Long Island and it was strong.  Food: Huge Menu! Fried Calamari (big portion, delish!), Corn Croquettes (goodness, i can't stop thinking about them), wild mushroom pizza (small and just ""ok""), chicken samosas (well flavored with a nice side dip).  The food was on point and the drinks were even sharper. This one experience could actually get me to return willingly to Cheesecake. who knew?!   Total bill: 7-8 drinks (dont judge me, full disclosure for your sake!) 4 apps : $60 bucks. not bad for killing happy hour."
Kat M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,26,37,5.0,4/21/2014,"I had the best pasta here... The server was so sweet and the service was fast. I love coming as much as I can,family restaurant indeed. Of course you can't leave without having a piece of their famous cheesecake... My fave is the banana cheesecake."
