Alex N.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",486,61,,5.0,5/17/2014,They give big portions here but you need to know what to order because sometimes the food comes out soggy and disgusting.  I advise fried foods when coming here and the pasta is really good too.  I never went here as a kid but again the fried food is very good.
Yanfei L.,"University Park, Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,1.0,4/17/2015,"Very bad experience here. When I arrive there , I asked how many hours they can offer for validation. They said 3 hrs,I think that's fine I can wait for 55mins to dining. However, when I left, I go to the machine, I need to pay for $5 (three hour parking). When I ask them, they said the grove offer 1 hour. We offer 1 hour with very bad attitude! I will never dining here again!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Joseph A.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",3,35,,1.0,5/12/2014,I've never left without feeling gross. The deserts are the only thing worth getting.
Orvin C.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/23/2013,The best Cheesecake Factory in LA area in terms of great service and the food! Food is always consistent. I usually order the calamari and in some other locations it comes out a bit over cooked or not as fresh. Then grove location always does it right.
Kirk J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,4.0,6/8/2014,"If you can wait awhile to be seating, the food is yummy :0"
Graham T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,17,,1.0,2/9/2014,"Get ready to wait. And then wait some more. And then wait a little while you're waiting to wait. The manager walks around holding her radio microphone yapping at her overextended staff - they need more help, fewer radios. The front desk told me 30 minutes -- I waited an hour and ten minutes. Food was fine - but it was a 2h30m affair. Never coming to this place again."
Benjamin S.,"Newhall, CA",445,475,35,4.0,2/3/2012,Great food! Awesome service! The waiter creeped me out a bit-kind of eye balled the kid a bit too much (that's where the minus star came from).  But overall an awesome experience...
Tracy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,248,197,4.0,1/31/2012,"Came here on a double-date. Typical as other Cheesecake Factory locations except this one is located in the date-oriented central The Grove. Perhaps this is why the lighting inside was particularly dim I assume. The beeper they gave us works well within the radius they informed us of. We got paged whilst meandering in Barns and Noble. Service was good despite having been seated in a far off corner/nook. I always enjoy their pasta dishes. Had the one with farfalle, garlic cream sauce and chicken. It was delicious. Could only eat half and saved the rest for hubby's lunch for next day. Ordered the hot artichoke and spinach cheese dip as an appetizer per usual for us. This has been the most consistent dish of all the Cheesecake Factories we've been to. Booths were cozy, as they always are as well. My favorite cheesecake is their key-lime pie one.  I would love to return here again for another date-night since I love the Grove."
Min S.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,158,48,4.0,1/28/2012,"I ve been to here on friday early evening.( there was still 25 minuts waiting) Now I clearly see why there is always a long waiting everytime I pass this place. Portions huge, and delicious food that includes thai, Japanes, and chinese( of course American and Mexican cuisine) Our server was really nice and cared whether we liked our food and were enjoying our time there.( We sat at the booth looking towards the bar) we had:  avocado eggroll: hot, and a lot of avocado in there Endive salad: deliciously tossed endive and pecans, blue cheese Mai Tai: huge cocktail.. almost like a glass full with orange juice. full of flavor and enough rum Gin and Tonic: strong enough and so fragrant Louisiana pasta(?): We ordered this after seeing the next table got this. such a huge dish with breaded chicken. Two people can share.  Great experience and we were glad that we didn't go to Morels or Il paci something right under the parking structure."
Iain M.,"Los Angeles, CA",326,23,11,5.0,2/2/2014,You know what you're getting with The Cheesecake Factory and The Grove deliver well enough. No complaints. The Luau Salad is big enough for my girlfriend and I to share and feel full which makes for a great cheap eat at The Grove.
Jewelyn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1753,849,3199,4.0,5/17/2009,"I'm forever a fan and today's visit wasn't that bad. Besides the random guy asking different tables for money... (I know random) my experience was ok.  I waited about 15 mins for a table. BUT it was so cramped... seating is too close. I was pretty much sitting inbetween 2 parties but I felt like we were all together. Service was fast, food was great.  I come here for their frozen ice mango drink! yummm!!!! I like their ahi roll and frozen ice mango drink... that was my choice for today. I also like their pastas, sandwiches, soups, salads. Lots to choose from. So it's good for groups, since there's variety. As for the cheesecake, I'll just stare at it in the window... unless I want to walk out 5 pounds heavier. Parking sucks! Parking in the building was hectic today... the bathrooms here are nice and roomy. Love the enterance of this location... never been to a CF where you go up to the main floor. This is probably the best place to eat at The Grove. The wait and seating arrangment is the only bad thing about CF. Prices is reasonable and their portions are huge. Other then that their food is always yummy, so it's worth the wait. 4 stars from me!"
Yrdyl S.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,18,285,3.0,1/26/2014,"Deal with the wait, every time I come here (not just this loc.) there is no way that you can sit and eat right away.   When it comes to food at least 2 person can share it. Complimentary breads are serve while waiting for your order. Love their STEAK DIANE, CHICKEN MARSALA AND MUSHROOMS, CHICKEN PICCATA and Oreo milkshake"
Juvi G.,"Pomona, CA",432,596,4341,5.0,11/13/2011,"I love coming to eat here with my family. The food is extremely delicious. They have such a diverse menu that I always have trouble choosing. Obviously they specialize in cheesecake, but they also have a large selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, and a little bit of everything in between. And their portions are nothing to scoff at, either. Although they do have healthy menu options, I would be hard pressed to show self-control if I came here and  was on a diet. Other than that, though, I can find nothing wrong with place. And the staff and waiters are also very friendly and attentive. If you've never been here before, (and aren't counting calories), I suggest trying the Kahlua Chocolate Cheesecake. It is decadence on a plate. Or if you're coming here for breakfast or brunch, you cannot go wrong with a Monte Cristo Sandwich. It's the strangest, yet most indulgent sandwich I've ever tasted."
La Trim And Rugs Inc. L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,37,4.0,4/20/2014,Never disappoints.  Great service and food.  Reasonable price for the amount if food.  Don't look at the carbs.  1 meal is enough for 2 days.
James P.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,51,5,2.0,2/9/2015,Our waitress was really bad and made the service unpleasant. The hibachi steak and the pork chop were really chewy. The pork chop was dry and needed to be more tender. They overcooked the pork and you couldn't chew the meat too well. The hibachi steak was okay but the meat could have been more tender. The server was clueless and made our dinner an unpleasant time. Do I have to ask you to get a refill when the cups are in front of you? Its common sense you ask the person if you want a refill. This made me not want to come here ever again.
Michael Y.,"Mid Wilshire, Los Angeles, CA",19,211,3,4.0,2/27/2014,"hmmm  not sure how this place could improve other than the always long wait on the weekends.  I usually get the burgers but the wifey gets shrimp scampi.. the scampi is quite good.  I had the kobe ""style"" beef... it had grilled onions but the sweet taste ruined it for me... i don't like sweet burgers.  nothing beat the cheesecakes though but you have to run 4 hours to burn it off"
Jasmin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,55,,4.0,2/5/2013,"Miso Salmon is my fav. And for desert I love the strawberry shortcake. Its a big biscuit with vanilla icecream in the middle, topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Yummy!!!"
Cori G.,"Irvine, CA",468,235,112,4.0,12/14/2011,"The Grove is very busy tonight, as Katy Perry is here. It wasn't hard to get a table at all. Our service was quick, as we were immediately brought our drinks and bread. The ambiance is nice, though not very private.   The terrific thing (in my opinion) is the ""skinnylicious"" menu. They offer everything from cocktails and appetizers, to entrees. It's full menu as opposed to many places which offer only a few items. I ordered the skinnylicious burger with a green salad.  The burger, ordered medium well, was juicy and flavorful.  It was very filling. I also got a skinny cosmopolitan, which was really... Well... Skinnylicious! :) I highly recommend this cheesecake factory. Even on busy days, it is nice and pretty relaxing."
Lavender R.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,150,4,5.0,9/17/2013,"Great bartender and service all around. Probably the best one Ive been to. Had an amazing Ritz Cocktail, followed by the Pear Martini . The Pear Martini was so amazing, it was the real thing, not artitficial flavoring. Also got the Cheese Quesadilla and it was oh so piping hot and fresh. The avocado rolls were to die for along with the dipping sauce. It was a divine experience. Everything came out promptly. A+ all the way around ."
Christina V.,"Downey, CA",92,25,62,1.0,12/22/2014,"I was very upset yesterday when my family visited the grove cheesecake for the very first time and had the most unwelcoming experience not only by the host but by the same manager. I think her man was anora. You can tell she does not work good under pressure and I used to be manager at a restaurant and it was unacceptable.  The host said the wait would be 45 min to an hour which we thought was reasonable. We had a party of 12. After almost 2hours of waiting we asked the host if our table was ready. They said we still needed a while. We said how long and they told us 3 more hours. We felt like they just wanted us to leave. After speaking to the manager saying we already had been waiting there 2 hours she said their was nothing she could do for us. It was first of all not out fault that the 2 host in the front said it was a 45 to an hour wait. Or else we would have never waited to begin with. The host said she mistakingly meant 4-5 hour wait. Which no one in their right mind would stay. The manager didn't offer us anything or offered us splitting tables. She could care less. We even over heard her saying to the host that she backed them up. In my opinion the customer was right because they were the ones with the mistake. My family was so disappointed at their first time at the grove and first time at Cheesecake Factory that to be honest we felt the manager was a bit racist and unprofessional. I bet 100$ if we were white business men she would have made it possible. It doesn't matter if the restaurant is busy, they need a bit more organization and professionalism."
