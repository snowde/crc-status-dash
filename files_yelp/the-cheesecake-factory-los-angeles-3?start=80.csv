Rakesh G.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,26,20,5.0,7/20/2017,One of the best place to eat after shopping at grove you can go to the Cheesecake Factory full bar amazing service and delicious food. Do not forget to ask about MIKE SMITH best service really good attitude towards the job.
Andres I.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",195,4,,1.0,10/20/2017,"Server alex sucks she has poor choice of words telling me ""I don't care"" all I told her it's my birthday."
Kenia F.,"Carlsbad, CA",63,47,4,4.0,11/21/2017,"Lunch was nice and calm, even though the place was crowded. Had the honey chicken, and orange chicken which were ok. The whole experience was just ok, not impressed. Might go back if it's convenient."
Sandi T.,"Alhambra, CA",42,143,524,2.0,7/9/2016,"I was at The Grove yesterday with one of my friends so we decided to stop by the Cheesecake Factory for lunch because we had a gift card and let me just say it was pretty disappointing compared to the service we have had at other Cheesecake Factory's.  First off I only know what my waiters name was because of our receipt . So our waiter Nicolas wasn't that attentive. It took forever to get anything from him...he wasn't that friendly and never checked on us once we were eating our food. It took close to 15 minutes to get boxes for our food and another 5+ minutes to get the check . The food was good as always but I really wish we would have had another server , I swear I saw other tables with different waiters getting checked on so frequently and with ours it was close to impossible to even track him down for a refill. It was just a little disappointing to say the least ."
Jun y.,"New York, NY",31,23,169,5.0,12/31/2016,"Best ever cheese cake I had in my whole life. I have been told the cheese cake was made with several kinds of cheeses to make the miracles but when I taste it ...it's absolutely surprised me ! You will not miss it! 30mins in line around 3pm is fair to me , I got to see the sum-sung VR show while waiting, and I get a nice 2level seat with street view...fantastic experience. The service is efficient and warming... I have no doubt will come back again Plus as a fan of Big Bang theory you should check it out lols"
Lucy M.,"Glendale, CA",838,20,,1.0,7/24/2017,"I think this is by far the worst service Iv ever had in my life.  Last night me and my boyfriend went around 1030 and placed an order both of us starving. I heard a few other people complaint about the food taking over 30 min mind me the place was empty.  The bartender took our order and we waited approximately 35-40 min.  Finally one of the dishes comes out and mine did not arrive.  The bartender forgot to put my order in, so the manager walks over and says, ""oh he forgot to put your order in Nd the kitchen is closed now, have a great night.""  I sat there with no food, to top that off no accommodation at all while my boyfriend stared at his burger.  They even asked us to leave saying there closing.  I will NEVER go back to this location."
Junior S.,"Culver City, CA",84,81,98,2.0,9/29/2017,"The Wait Is Long Which Is Expected But The Service Is Not Great, They Take Forever To Bring Drinks & The Food Take 30-45 Min Which Is Ok But Is ALWAYS Wrong..... The Management Is Decent Because They're So Apologetic! I Just Wish They Cared About Fixing Our Food More Than Apologizing & Explaining Why Things Were So Bad. (We Still Tipped 15%)"
Meks L.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,94,8,3.0,6/12/2017,"Been here a few times over the years. Always have received prompt, attentive service. Tonight was no different. We started off with Nashville nuggets, just ok. As we were waiting for our main course. They sat a couple at the table next to us. (Tables are super close to eachother ) my complaint ? They had a dog with them. The lady claimed it was a service dog. I understand, service dogs serve a purpose. My complaint is the space was so cramped, that the dog kept stepping on our feet. She was feeding the dog, dog food. So that smell was in the air. And it's just not something I want to smell or deal with while eating a delicious plate of Alfredo with shrimp. It put a curb in our appetite. The couple didn't mind as they drank away. My birthday and I got no dessert."
Gisela S.,"Glendale, CA",48,66,49,5.0,6/24/2017,"June 23,2017 @ 8:00 pm Just got lucky we were seated in less than 20 mins and mind you it was a Saturday night at the grove. Allison C. was our server (I hope) it says on the receipt. She was very attentive and always ask if we were okay. That's more like it good customer service!!! Thank you!!!! Food was awesome!!!!"
Hong Joo P.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,27,7,1.0,6/14/2017,"Probably one of the worst Cheesecake factory' s in la. The service is shit 50 percent of the times, they don't even ask you if you want to be indoors or out. I ordered a steak with ""vegetableS"" medium RARE and got a well done piece of meat with cold mashed potatoes and soggy disgusting green beans. The worst experience ever.  Oh and they didn't give me a steak knife until I had to call for the a1 sauce"
Stephanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,2,1.0,11/28/2017,"This 1 star (wish it could be 0) is for waiter Demeitrie E.  Came in with my mom to have a nice dinner but he ruined it.  Sucks that they hire people with such ugly personalities.  The food this time was not good.  I didn't even eat it.  of course, he didn't care to even ask.  Not a gentleman at all.  Disrespectful and seemed to discriminate because of my race.  Just made the whole experience awful.  Demeitrie! start being polite and treat your customers with respect."
Raumak R.,"Los Angeles, CA",198,138,11,3.0,6/14/2017,What's happened to the quality of cheesecake factory??  I used to love their food.  You always knew you could get a good meal at cheesecake.  I went a few months ago and was extremely disappointed in the quality of food.  The bread came out cold.  Everything we ordered lacked flavor. The service was subpar.  Cheesecake Factory has definitely gone downhill.
Hala Hana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",240,131,720,4.0,5/9/2016,Cheesecake Factory takes me back to acute nostalgia of my middle school days. Always came here on the weekend after school and shared a plate with friends. The same favored dishes are still now. Never had a dish I didn't like. Some more than others. Appetizer  Buffalo blast Thai lettuce wraps  Warm & crab artichoke dip Pasta  Jambalaya pasta  Louisiana chicken pasta  Spicy chicken chipotle pasta  Bistro shrimp pasta  Salad Luau salad Chinese chicken salad  Dessert Original cheesecake with strawberry  Red velvet cheesecake  White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake
Alexander M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",15,67,41,5.0,7/10/2017,"Really the best dessert. When I was told about this place, I did not think that it would be so delicious. In an institution always there is no place. If you want to sit, make a reservation in advance. Try a caramel cheesecake. Good price and quality, the staff is very friendly, everyone is smiling. For this is a big plus."
Mark A.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,11,6,5.0,9/10/2017,"On all visits to this location, we have had incredibly kind and extroverted staff that are superbly attentive and ready to make your meal a good experience. The food of course is excellent and wide spread. Recommending this place highly for any dinner occasion if you have a little extra to spend on it, and maybe have no idea what you want to eat until you read it on a menu. This clears that right up in the best way."
Rosalia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,31,45,5.0,6/17/2017,"* Food.  Delicious. We ordered a lot of dishes , it was cooked perfect. Cheesecakes were fantastic.  * Staff.  Our waiter didn't come to us , because he was busy, and another guy accepted our order and he was nice . We didn't like our waiter, he came to the end of our meal and didn't smile , he was so serious.  Food at the restaurant was prepared fast . And I liked that  they drought: 1) drinks 2) bread whit butter 3) main orders 4) dessert . It's right .  * Atmosphere. Nice. Furniture was so comfortable, but there was no enough light , I understood it's design , but when I have meal I wanna see face of my partners . I liked that they had a lot of tables and it were all  closed and another customers didn't  disturb us .  * Restroom .  It wasn't so clean , but I didn't wait in line . It had all what I needed .       * Conclusion : I wanna visit this Cheesecake Factory again. So delicious. I want on line just 10 minutes. Fantastic and Perfect food."
Nicholas C.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",114,19,1,1.0,5/3/2017,Never again... I just got home and had a strange feeling this while I was eating... I felt something was off with my food... Now my stomach is upset and I feel that I'm about to throw up.. This is not about the service but it's about the food..
April W.,"Dublin, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/20/2017,I had a great time with friends last night.  Dinner was great the wait was long but it was worth it!!!!!!!!!!!i love to sit overseeing the grove lights:) my service was good like always. I Don't know how your host i believe the guy working next to her last night called her (Michelle?) downstairs does it but she knows what she's doing people can be so rude at times when they saw her busy but she did accommodate all of us with all that pressure she was under good job!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lilia G.,"Goleta, CA",102,7,,1.0,12/3/2017,I chose this place to celebrate my birthday. I knew I was going to have a large party (11 people total). I called them days in advance AND the day off at 10am to let them know that a large party was coming for dinner that day. They didn't take reservations and they said to call back closer to the time to get a more accurate wait time. I called an hour and half before 6:30 pm (on my way to the grove) and I told them my party size and they said they couldn't give me an estimated wait time unless I was there in person. Still holding on to hope because I had never been here but love the grove for it's magical ambiance. I arrive to put my name down and they tell me it's a 3 HOUR WAIT! I was expecting at the most an hour and half (like everyone  else was being told). I KNEW this would happen which is why I called SO MANY times in advance to warn them a large party was coming but they didn't do anything to accommodate and make us wait even longer than everyone else... it absolutely spoiled my birthday filling me with both outrage and sadness because my entire party had travelled to get here only to be expected to wait to eat until 9:30pm. It would have been nice to know on any of the previous phone calls that the wait time could be up to 3 HOURS instead of telling me to be there in person AND then turn away my entire party once they arrived. How does that even make sense?!?
Ian J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,3.0,6/19/2017,"We really wanted to like this place more than we did. We have dined there on more than one occasion and they always just seem too busy to give optimal service. The food so far has just been okay, however I won't deny the complimentary bread is delicious. The manager was very helpful when our food came out a little rusty and the servers are never rude but we usually don't see them more than once.  I don't want to completely steer anyone away but Cheesecake Factory if you are reading I would recommend slowing the pace of your seating."
