Ernest D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,13,,4.0,7/30/2013,Go during happy hour which is 3-6. 5 dollar drinks like long island Ice teas and an extensive food menu with items ranging from $5 to $7.  I always enjoy myself and I invite friends quite often.
m p.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,20,128,1.0,2/16/2014,"Ok I order Renee Special n the waiter/waitress always ask what meat do I want. Why was it different from the phone order? The guy said that he never ask, from what I know if you are offering different type of meat on any menu you need to ask the customer right? He finally change it with attitude. Came home n open the box, inside was suppose to be a chicken sandwish instead I found the same piece of turkey chop up n trying to make it look like chicken salad sandwish...Now I have eaten there since The Grove had just open disappointed to say that this will be the last time!!"
Jo S.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",91,6,4,5.0,2/15/2014,"went here and it was packed and crowded because of valentines day. but even with so many rude customers who got tired of waiting, the staff smiled and was very friendly back to them and responded politely. the servers were all busily working and was trying their very best to get everything done in the fastest and most concise way. our server was named Rebecca and she was so amazing from the start! she was very funny, friendly and nice even though she was working on valentines day. she even went out of her way and changed one of our wines because it was my first time trying wine and she wanted me to have a great first time experience with it. she even recommended what movie to watch because her and her boyfriend had recently watched one and they had enjoyed it.  the time there was very relaxing and comfortable because the servers and staff were just on top of their game even though it must have been pretty overwhelming with it being valentines day. it was very professional and i would definitely come back!!"
Ken H.,"La Palma, CA",463,706,725,4.0,10/9/2009,Great Food Variety of Selections Tons of cheesecakes to choose from!!! Tip: Order a combo (Chicken/shrimp/steak/salmon pick 2) and its enough for people to share! so you'll have room for dessert!
Raymond B.,"Calabasas, CA",15,42,4,5.0,12/29/2011,"Simply just the best  Amazing food, great drinks, and good service. If you think of food and can't decide where to go its easy Cheesecake.  Love it"
Orla H.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",59,103,,2.0,3/7/2011,"The two stars above are for the cheesecake and that alone! I guess when you go to a restaurant named for its desserts the rest of the menu is kind of superfluous but inedible?? But I'm getting ahead of myself here... I've only been to the States a handful of times and never experienced this place so I was super excited when some friends brought us. It was extremely busy and the staff were disorganized to say the least. After waiting downstairs we were then called and sent for some more waiting upstairs where the staff gave our table to some one else. After some half hearted apologies we were led to our table and given a menu the size of a book, is there really a need for it to be that long? Not to mention the fact that the lighting is so low I had to squint to read any of it.  Our waitress returned and took our orders, lemon herb roasted chicken for me. All the dishes came out at different times, around 10 mins between first & last. My chicken was dreadful, overcooked and dryer than the desert. The potatoes were delicious at least. I wished I had ordered the chicken marsala which my companion had and I tasted. It was delicious, moist and tender. The difference astounded me, it's the same bird!!  Moving on, our waitress returned and removed the dishes and presented the dessert menu to us with so much enthusiasm I thought her head might explode. Three of us ordered cheesecake, lemon raspberry for me. It was the best dessert I've eaten in a long time, so creamy and packed full of flavour. I also tasted the red velvet, heavenly, and the mango key lime, a little sweet for me.  Our super smiley waitress came back and delivered the bill while we were still eating, a little rude I thought. Ruder still was when she attempted to take it before we'd had a chance to look at it. Very subtle love, next time just say you need the table. I know it's LA but some people appreciate honesty."
Nikki P.,"Orange, CA",171,118,21,3.0,12/12/2011,"This chain of Cheesecake Factory's just may have redeemed the restaurant. I was pleased with my visit. Although, I still do have a few minor complaints. First issue was that it was 11pm and the wait was about 30 minutes, second the seating sucks I literally was right next to two other tables and felt like it was just one big table, and third the restrooms were disgusting; I am not even over exaggerating! I ordered the bang bang chicken which I thought was good. Friend ordered the mac n cheese burger and it tasted like a giant big mac with extra salt!! His dish was disgusting. It was a big salty disaster! The strawberry lemonade was the best that I've had. The latte was yummy after the meal. Mmm... Waiter was very tentative. Although our table sucked, the restaurant appeared to have pretty nice seating for booths. Loud music however, even with that it still didn't drown out the other tables conversations.  I think I'll give this place one more shot. Just because the restaurant was nice and food was good. Ambiance of the restaurant was nice as well."
Phill C.,"Culver - West, CA",34,69,2,4.0,8/11/2014,"Besides the sometimes long wait times, I cant complain about this place. Food is always good, nice waiters and staff. If the food is bad or wrong just tell your waiter, and they will get it taken care of."
Nancy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",880,488,1372,3.0,9/29/2008,"Here with a friend and some visitors from the bay area.  Everyone really like their food, and the cheesecake.  I had the classic burger here, medium rare.  The patty was huge, and quite good with cheese, red onions.  I couldn't even eat more than a third, so I wanted to box it up when we were leaving. The waitress offered to box it, and she picked up my plate and then proceed to stack the other diners plates on top of my plate squashing my burger!  She apologized and offered to bring me a new bun.  I took the plate from her and told her to bring the box to me instead. I should have immediately went to look for the manager, so she could be reprimanded in front of the whole table who witnessed this. She clearly despised her job, my friend remarked that she was a phony, just what I was thinking.  She brought over a box and a new bun, apologizing again.  I enjoyed the food here more than I expected, though 3 stars is good enough for this place. Minus one star due to the ill-mannered waitress."
Sara B.,"Monrovia, CA",283,22,6,5.0,2/1/2014,"Great service and friendly staff. Delicious sangria!! Food is always amazing!!! Favs include chicken piccata, tacos, text next rolls, and all of the seafood plates."
Catherine L.,"Palmdale, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/19/2015,"My family and I decided to eat here for my sisters birthday. We called ahead of time to reserve a table for 12 and when we got there they tried to seat us at two seperate tables, which is completely stupid. When we refused to sit there the waitress got a nasty attitude and got the hostess, she got us a table together which was easy to do the first time so I have no idea what the fuss was about since they automatically charge an 18% tip no matter what crummy service they provide. The food was good but the waitress was horrible plus she and the staff refused to sing happy birthday to my sister but they sang for two other families sitting across from us. I would not recommend this restaurant at all in my opinion the restaurant at The Americana has better service."
Cae C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,3.0,4/13/2014,"Food outstanding!  Service, way below average.   It's been awhile since I've dined here.  I remember the food always being great, and it was great again.  However, on this visit, I took note of how the restaurant took special care to label items on the menu like ""Gluten-Free"", ""Contains Dairy"" or ""Nuts"".  There's even a special, separate, low-cal menu.  For a restaurant like CHEESECAKE FACTORY, which has such an extensive menu anyway, to include extra touches such as these is, well, impressive.  I'm a diner with more than one serious allergy and it's nice to have a well-known choice in my wheelhouse, so thank you Cheesecake Factory!  You even had a piece of cheesecake I could eat.  I'm still smiling. Unfortunately, our server, was aloof when he was taking care of us but mostly not there at all.  He greeted us with, ""I'm going on my break.""  I've worked in the service industry for over twenty years and I understand breaks need to happen and there's never a good time for them; however, his opening line was terrible and the service was worse.  About ten minutes later, we received our water and bread (we were ready to order and he still hadn't gone on his break) but he didn't ask, he just dropped the water and bread and left, not making eye contact.  Finally, another server took our order.  Our food came (and it was amazing thank goodness).  I had to ask for more ketchup from three different people.  Finally, our server brought it to me after he came and went to the table right next to us about four times.  We had to ask for iced tea refills and struggled to actually find someone to ask.  When we finally received more iced tea, we were finished with our meal.  We had to ask for dessert menus and then only my friend received one, I had to ask for one too, again.  When the cheesecake arrived, we had no silverware.  Our server dropped the cheesecake and disappeared for about five minutes saying he would be back with silverware & napkins.  I'm not sure why we needed a new napkin for dessert.  When he returned he presented a mis en place filled with silverware, indicating for us to grab our own silverware, but never actually speaking to us.  Really?  Is that sanitary?!  What if I had the flu?  And I'm digging into the mis en place where ALL the other guests are also grabbing their silverware?  It seemed rather odd to me. One thing I was grateful for regarding our server, he asked if I had a parking ticket to validate.  I did.  And if it weren't for his reminder, I would have forgot.  This one little gesture is how I know our server didn't mean to give bad service.  Maybe he was new, still working out his procedure, his style, I'm not sure.  I don't write reviews often unless I feel someone can learn something.  In this case, I think it might be important to review the basics with some of the younger wait staff.  MAKE EYE CONTACT.  No silverware, no food!  Communicate but don't share information your guest doesn't need to know (find a mature delivery).  Go out!  Be a diner at least once a week, it creates empathy for your guest.  But the most important thing, ASK FOR HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT. I love The Cheesecake Factory.  It's my parent's favorite restaurant.  I send them gift certificates all the time!  I'm not trying to be harsh, just trying to help."
Isabelle P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,7,4.0,4/9/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory is usually hit or miss in some areas, but the one in The Grove is always excellent! My friend & I went for a quick lunch & were seated quickly even though it was busy :) Got a few appetizers & the S'mores cheesecake to share, and it was amazing! We sat in the bar area and even though it was happy hour it wasn't too over crowded. If ever back in the Fairfax area again we'll be going back :)"
Zarina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,1,4.0,4/6/2014,"I was there yesterday , I loved their steak and baked potato . Our server was very nice and friendly."
Sabrina F.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,249,82,4.0,9/25/2013,"We lucked out! The wait was not as long as it usually is on a friday night (out the door) so we finally decided to try this location after all these years.  We waited for a table in the bar area with all our friends.  We were told it would be about 45 min wait,but it was only about 30 mins. The service was friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was clean and romantic.  I will be back to this location again IF the wait isn't too long."
Brian W.,"Seattle, WA",352,73,12,4.0,1/14/2014,"Be sure to call in and make a reservation; it gets extremely busy, especially on the weekends. But it was worth the wait; great food and service. Also a surprisingly thorough wine selection."
Dee C.,"South Jordan, UT",350,381,12,3.0,1/21/2011,Three reasons why Cheesecake is worth going to occasionally: (1) cheesecake - duh (2) their portions are ridiculous. one plate can feed 2 generously. (3) their brown bread whatever it is is delicious! Two reasons not to: (1) mediocre over spiced/salted/marinaded food (2) their 500 pg menu with advertisement is ridiculous and unnecessary.
Rebecca F.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,175,10,4.0,9/15/2011,"Great food, but I am so mad that they don't take reservations. There is always a crazy long wait!! But it's worth it for the fried zucchini, avocado eggrolls and the ROCKY ROAD SPIKED MILKSHAKE!!!"
Jeff M.,"Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, CA",3,6,5,4.0,1/3/2014,"Love it here, one of my favorite places eat. The wait can sometimes be a bit long...but don't fear. You can walk a long the Grove and enjoy window shopping. A lot of high end shops. Also during the holidays the tall Xmas tree is gorgeous to look at. I gave it 4 stars because the one at the marina gets the five because it's by the ocean."
YouGoGlenCoco S.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,98,108,5.0,3/10/2011,I love cheesecake factory. It is a great restaurant for any occasion. Great food & great drinks.. The wait on the weekends can be long. They have like a million and one type of cheesecake if you are in the mood for dessert. :)
