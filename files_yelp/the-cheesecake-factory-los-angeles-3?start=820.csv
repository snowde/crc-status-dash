Julia L.,"San Francisco, CA",793,318,508,5.0,8/2/2010,"5 star because of one awesome server named Rene R.  He was absolutely fabulous!  He was so good, I went home & wrote Corporate to tell them the following: ""I am contacting you to let you know of exceptional service we received tonight at The Cheesecake Factory located at The Grove in Los Angeles, CA.  It's my birthday tomorrow and my cousin, her boyfriend and my mom decided to have dinner with me a day early.  We decided on this location as it was the closest & we love the menu. Rene R was our waiter tonight (Check #0583 - Table #51 - SvrCk #6 @ 19:04 on 8/2/10).  He is one superb employee!  He greeted us with a smile.  Friendly & knowledgeable.  Helpful and attentive.  My mom ordered hot water w/ lemon.  On his own, half way through the meal, he brought another mug of hot water w/ lemon wedges on the side.  We didn't even ask for a refill.  Same for the waters.  Same for the bread.  He was busy but never too busy to keep checking in on us. He recommended the lemon herb roasted chicken for me & it was delicious! Just the way he served us as well as the other tables around us, I turned to my mom & said, he could be a waiter at a 5-star high end restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, we love The Cheesecake Factory.  But the last time I got that kind of service @ any of your locations was...never.  And I've been going to this chain for over 15 years now. If anything, he reminded me of Stu @ Bix in San Francisco.  Or Mrs. Dwyer @ Lawry's Beverly Hills.  I remember servers' names if they impress me with their great service.  If possible, I'll definitely be asking to be seated in his area again. I hope you guys keep Rene for a long time and move him onto the Managerial track.  A lot of your other waiters/waitresses could do with a bit of training of Rene style service! Thank you for hiring him and making my b'day dinner a very pleasant surprise!"" Yeah yeah - so I gushed - but hey!  If management ever needs to check his personnel files, here's one nice customer compliment in his favor, right?"
Kali K.,"Los Angeles, CA",211,158,156,4.0,5/19/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory=Happy times. :-) Does it ever differ? Not really.  This is a plus for the chain. As far as I've seen, there isn't one 'shady' CF & another dripping w/ glitz. They are--to the chain's credit--uniform; service is friendly across the board.  Petit Filet Mignon is well-prepped, & the accompanying french fries are duly soaked in culinary juices. Mmmm. ((stomach growling)) Dessert? Who has room? But it's a MUST.  You just don't go to a place like the CF & not get the obligatory hunk o' cake. It defeats the purpose; you could've gone to a steakhouse if you merely wanted tasty chops.  You came here for the extensive cake menu!  You know... the Reeses Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake, Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake, Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake. (I can't breathe!) Just get your lard-laden buns to the CF, & worry about booking a double appointment w/ your trainer tomorrow. Your midsection won't kill you! (It'll just turn into a cheesecake-muffin top. *Cute* O_O) This place is popular: wait times can be 40-50 minutes. Bring your Nook. ;-)"
Laura G.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,61,9,2.0,10/11/2012,"I was very put off by a rude hostess at this location who gave us serious attitude regarding our party having ""too many strollers"". I just had a baby three months ago and was looking forward to a much needed outing with a few other mom friends. I understand that during busy hours they could pose a fire hazard but at the time we arrived the place was half empty. It was really more the ATTITUDE we got from the hostess regarding their policy. I have spent thousands of dollars dining at CCF over the years. This one experience has seriously left a bad taste in my mouth and I honestly doubt if I will ever go back. There are too many other restaurants that are overly nice and accommodating."
Guillermo M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",152,62,19,2.0,8/20/2013,Nah. Didn't like this place.  Silverware was missing. Drinks took too long to bring. Watered down. We had to ask for the bread and that also took too long to bring. Waiter seemed inattentive.  just didn't like it there and won't be going back.  Food was so so.
Jason P.,"New Orleans, LA",152,8,5,5.0,1/9/2013,"The food was excellent and the service was great! I loved our server, though I forgot her name. I don't have any special menu choices to recommend, because there were so many choices on the menu; just go and experience it :-)."
Angela W.,"Los Angeles, CA",106,57,272,4.0,5/25/2014,"I wasn't a fan of Cheesecake Factory until I dined at this particular location at The Grove. I love their menu because it offers homey favorites and finer dishes for a fair price.  Alongside that, I could order the White Chicken Chili one hundred times, and each time, I can almost guarantee that the chef will prepare and cook the dish precisely the same way. As a chain, Cheesecake Factory relies on this sense of menu familiarity with their patrons. For me, this kind of consistency is key when deciding on regular dining spots, as in, I am confident that everything on the menu tastes just as I expect it to no matter what day of the week. Not only that, the outdoor balcony seating is terrific and the staff is always very accommodating and friendly.  I do sometimes get annoyed by the cover artist music selection and the indoor lighting is sometimes TOO dark to see the plate in front of you. This place is always popular, so if they could develop a reservation system in the future, that may be helpful. Regardless, the food is the main component for me, and for that, I enjoy dining here."
Phoenix A.,"Seattle, WA",921,737,37,4.0,8/12/2008,"Something about Cheesecake Factory activates my short-term memory loss because I can never remember what I have eaten there.  I've always found their food blah and unexciting. But last night I came here for a birthday and decided to try something other than a ho-hum salad or burger.  First, I ordered the Well Mannered Martini, which was a dirty Ketel One martini that was made perfectly. Our party of 15 was already talking about the avocado rolls before we got there so we ended up ordering 3 plates of it.  They turned out to be pretty fucking amazing if you like big tasty chunks of avo. For my main course, I split a bowl of the Thai Chicken Pasta.  It could have used some kick, but I enjoyed it so much that I finally now have a reason to return. We were quoted a 2-hour wait for dinner at 7, but were seated well before that.  Our server took very good care of us and right now I'm wishing I had leftovers."
Kellianne R.,"Alameda, CA",375,156,538,4.0,7/29/2013,I've eaten here so many times! Love the happy hour because i can get avacado rolls! Soo good! And a drink for 10 bucks! It can get really busy here through so I wouldn't come with a big group unless you wanna wait a while. I just go sit at the bar because waiting takes too long.
Mora N.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",169,188,158,4.0,7/2/2013,Good food and service. They validate parking. I wish they opened at 11 on weekdays!
Yerin k.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,,3.0,1/6/2015,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory several times but most of the times I went, I had to wait really lomg to be seated and to be served my food. I once went and they took an hour to bring out a pizza that was cold with stiff cheese and the other orders had not even come out yet!! The table that came after us were already done eating and leaving when we were still waiting for our food... The food wasn't even like AWESOME.. It was okay.. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.."
B B.,"Los Angeles, CA",367,74,23,3.0,10/10/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory.  The menu's too big, the place is too loud and the wait is always too long. I don't eat there unless I have to."
T T.,"Los Angeles, CA",180,383,27,3.0,7/20/2011,"I don't like the food at the Cheesecake Factory.  I like their cheesecake. My friends hold the same sentiment, but I think it was the desperate gurgles of our empty stomachs that compelled us to eat here, instead of looking around for better food & returning to CcF for dessert...  yeah, we should've done that.   But alas, when we left, we were too full to even ruminate the thought of their amazing cheesecake."
Christal Y.,"San Francisco, CA",77,179,63,3.0,4/12/2011,"Don't care for Cheesecake Factory.  When you grow accustomed to unique, home-cooked style food, a place like Cheesecake Factory doesn't cut it anymore. But in comparison to my other Cheesecake Factory experiences... It seems to be a place that's all about how much you get rather than what you get. I got a Chicken Caesar salad that seemed quite bland.  The decor of this place and placement of tables in this place appears to be lacking. It feels more about stuffing people in than letting people relax as we were seated right next to the escalator where people go up. Anytime there's a spot for people who aren't eating to watch you eat... that's a big turn off for any restaurant.  It's not bad enough to qualify as two stars, but it's not great either. Three star mediocrity for me."
Suzanne F.,"Valencia, CA",39,1,,1.0,7/23/2014,"I am not one to write reviews but this poor experience deserves it. I have come many times to this Cheesecake Factory as well as many others and this by far was the worst experience! First it started fine with drinks and bread but then quickly went downhill. The waiter brought out the child's meal first which would've been fine if she was 3 but she's 10. Then we waited at least another 10 minutes before our meal came and no appetizer insight! We asked about the appetizer and our waiter Jesus responded "" I only have 2 hands"" and someone's following me. Which of course there was no one. We asked why they brought the kids meal so far in advance from ours and he said "" I thought that's what you would want"". Hmmm., how about asking?  Then eventually we got our appetizer which was missing  a main ingredient and no spoon which we had to wait for and ask for. It was just all around bad. When we decided to say something to the waiter he was very nonchalant and not all concerned.  We even complained to the manager and all he did was comp the appetizer. Not enough!! Also I so how the waiter catered to the people ordering more like cocktails, dessert and coffee, etc. Still even after we paid the waiter never asked how everything was. That really says at all!! Next time I'm here at the Grove I will be eating somewhere else!!"
Alice Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,188,41,4.0,12/3/2010,"Had dinner here last night with the bf. We came around 7, but there was no wait! It was awesome to just walk in and get seated. The service is great. The decor and ambience standard of any Cheesecake Factory. The food was good too. We started off with the chicken samosas appetizer and bf ordered a Blue Moon while I got the iced green tea. The chicken samosas are good (especially the first bite), but they get too salty after a while. They come with a dipping sauce that was pretty good. I was expecting samosa wrap, but it was more like a wrap on an egg roll. It was still good. The iced green tea is amazing! It's so refreshing with a sprig of mint. It feels so fresh and clean! The bf ordered a chargrilled steak medium rare plus while I got the cajun jambalaya pasta. The steak was delicious. It melted in your mouth. The pasta was good as usual. The pasta was cooked a little more than al dente, but it was good. I liked how it wasn't all dry-- some cheesecakes make this dish a little dry. Instead, the chicken was so moist and the whole dish was not dry at all! So good! Coming back soon!"
Marlon M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,64,7,5.0,8/15/2013,"This my go to spot for my girlfriend and I when we want to have a nice dinner at a restaurant with good food, service, and atmosphere. This place will get packed on Friday Saturday & Sunday evenings so expect a wait. The food here is delicious but somewhat pricy but not overpriced because their plates are pretty big that you'll miss out on their great cheesecakes if you eat your entire plate so make room! Service is great and they validate your parking ticket if you park inside the grove structure. I recommend the lemon-herb roasted chicken or the chicken costaletta... Mmmmmm!"
Debra F.,"Pasadena, CA",29,62,,4.0,8/15/2011,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory a million times but this was my first time at the one at the Grove.  I have to say that the food at CF is pretty consistent and solid. I had the Jambalaya and it was good.  The dish was piping hot with noodles cooked just right with a very thin layer of sauce/seasoning to coat the noodles so they weren't dry.  It was nice and spicy with lots of chicken and shrimp. During the dinner, they dimmed the lights so it got kind of dark which was a little weird  - maybe they were setting the mood for couples ;O)"
Kevin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",179,281,671,4.0,6/5/2011,"Happy hour 4-6pm Monday through Friday review!  Select drinks for $5 and regular menu appetizers are only $5 minus a few like Chinese lettuce wraps. I think portion size for the appetizers are pretty similar to normal ones so it's quite a deal.  There's a ""small bites"" menu that has a lot of selection but they are actually pretty small servings sizes."
Jess A.,"Singapore, Singapore",165,251,76,5.0,6/14/2011,"The grove location is convenient, but hate the long lines here... Anyway, on to the dishes... Chinese chicken salad Fried Mac and cheese with marinara sauce appetizers Crab cake appetizers Miso salmon Chicken Madeira Shrimp scampi orange chicken Crispy beef Chicken Marsala Louisiana chicken pasta Chopped salad White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is my absolute favorite I just tried their key lime cheesecake and it's delicious. I used to eat the carrot cake on Beverly dr, and it's the best carrot cake and frosting I've ever tried. Yums! Oh I used to like their white chocolate raspberry latte but it's not on the menu anymore... I like their food even though it's like chain restaurant. Oh, last time, they forgot our crab cake appetizers and the manager gave it to us for free. So nice right? But then another time, their service was super slow and like practically non existent. Oh and another time I forgot to print out the coupon for free cheesecake for every $30 spent, and the manager came and said it's ok cos I showed him the email on my new iPad haha. So basically, the service is up and down, but the food is good. I wish they would open this franchise in hong kong, cos i'll be moving there soon. And. I mean, they have cpk there, which I would say is this restaurant's competitor, but I understand that rent is super high there. Anyway, yes, love cheesecake factory. Both at the grove and Beverly drive. :) Oh and also, I always get birthday cakes from here for my friends, and myself haha. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake!"
Glenn S.,"Fair Oaks, CA",1005,424,421,4.0,8/12/2013,I've been here before and the food is pretty good but I think the menu is a little overwhelming. The most disappointing thing is they don't make their own cheesecake. It's made at a bakery and distributed to them.
