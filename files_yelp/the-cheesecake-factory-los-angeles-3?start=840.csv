Michael O.,"Los Angeles, CA",138,62,,4.0,10/20/2013,"Because its at The Grove, this Cheesecake Factory is always busy.  You will certainly have a good shot of seeing a celebrity or two as well.  Even though they are busy (and with their expansive menu), the food is always prepared well and the service is great.  Portions are big and you certainly get your monies worth."
John V.,"Burbank, CA",10,112,9,3.0,7/28/2013,Good food HUGE portions!  Service is alright.  Takes forever and a day to get a table since it's at the grove.  Be prepared to wait 45 minutes to an hour for a table.
Glenda C.,"Culver City, CA",120,49,103,5.0,6/17/2011,"One of my fave restaurant of all ---- Good fried calamari, their strawberry lemonade is unbelievable good, nothing can beat it. Food is great, the servers are always professional and very accommodating.  Will always be a fan."
Chivvon M.,"San Diego, CA",51,17,20,5.0,12/27/2012,I had take out and it was just as good as if I had dined in... I had the herb crusted salmon with mashed potatos and broccoli... sounds simple but it was simply delicious!!!
Maria T.,"Studio City, Los Angeles, CA",14,21,115,1.0,9/25/2013,I'm disappointed. Meatloaf was salty!  The cups of hot water for the tea I ordered stank like sewer water!
Chris R.,"Las Vegas, NV",277,248,664,4.0,5/5/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is centrally located inside of The Grove outside shopping experience. The restaurant has a terrace area which they seem to turn tables more quickly than inside, which is a tip if you are in a bit more of a hurry. That's a relative term as there are always a lot of people waiting to eat here. The chairs outside are slightly smaller and not that great for those of us who have skipped a few visits to the gym. They do offer a buzzer, but it only works slightly outside of the door and definitely not at the book store next door. The wait time is fairly accurate, so when they tell you an hour and a half, go for a walk. The biggest difference about this location over others, is that you are escorted up escalators to get to your table. There are no tables on the first floor. There is an elevator in case you need it. The bar is on one end of the restaurant but unfortunately drinks do take extra time to get refilled and delivered. I've been coming to this location over the past eight years plus and each time I have had a different experience. Sometimes, I go for a quick snack down the way at Farmer's Market to deal with the long wait times. Once you've finished with dinner, don't forget to get your parking pass validated."
Kyle C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,3.0,1/30/2014,"The food was fantastic but the service was painfully slow.  We were treated and seated by a friendly hostess, and then left to ponder that kindness for about fifteen minutes.  Our waiter finally stopped swirling through the isle long enough to take our order.  Eventually our delicious food came out and luckily we didn't need anything else, because who would be there to help us?  Ordered our cheesecake to go because we were falling asleep. Fifteen minutes to pay out."
Jane K.,"Alhambra, CA",78,140,51,4.0,9/25/2010,"I would've given this place 5 stars, if they took reservations and the wait weren't that long. For a pretty popular place, I think they should take reservations, so that people wouldn't have to worry about a ridiculous long wait if they were to bring a big group.  As for the food....the only two things I order when I come here is the thai lettuce wraps and pasta da vinci! The thai lettuce wraps are appetizers, but they give you a lot so I eat it as a meal! The vegetables are fresh and I love the sauces that they have! Not exactly sure what the sauces are, but it tastes good :) Pasta da vinci....YUMMY. love mushrooms in my pasta. It's not creamy like some pastas, so you can eat a lot of it! The last time I was there, the pasta was cooked al dente. SO SO GOOD :) I'm craving some right now! The portions are huge, so I can never finish it...so I take it home and it's my lunch for the next day! This Cheesecake Factory is conveniently located at the Grove, so you can walk off all the calories afterward!"
kimmie v.,"Los Angeles, CA",27,35,2,4.0,6/27/2013,This location is extremely busy but the service is still awesome. They are attentive and even have someone helping your main server to make sure drinks are filled and bread is plentiful. The portions here are large and the cheesecake is rich and delicious.
Jenny W.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,50,,5.0,6/24/2013,"5 stars just for its consistency of awesome food, bread, service."
Princess P.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,273,176,4.0,5/18/2013,"Parking at The Grove on the weekend, oi vey!!!  The food is outstanding and the service was excellent!! They were able to accommodate my crazy food request. I wanted a veggie burger but with a combination of other burgers' toppings and no bun, lol!  The veggie burger was made out of black beans, brown rice, beets (which gave it its reddish color) and a few other ingredients.  I added avocado, mushroom, and yes, a slice of bacon!!  It was AMAZING!!!  The cheesecakes are pretty amazing, my favorite being the Kailua Coffee Cheesecake...OH.  MY.  GOD, it is sooo sooo sooo good!!!!!  I liked that the wait wasn't long at all even though it was pretty busy and they will validate your parking downstairs!"
Donna A.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,43,13,3.0,6/20/2011,I'd only go here for their happy hour. $5 appetizers & drinks? Why not! I'm currently obsessed with their spinach and cheese dip. You also can't go wrong with their deep fried mac & cheese.
Diego K.,"Downey, CA",133,121,18,4.0,6/17/2013,People who complain about the wait time are just flat out stupid. This place is always pack. All the cheesecake factory's I have been to always have a long wait time. Obvious the food is good that's why is always packed. The food is really good and people complaining about the prices are just flat out cheap. This place has big portions for pretty good prices. So good that I always take food home and have a lunch for the next day. Good food and great cheesecake. Why complain?
Esteban J.,"Burbank, CA",461,93,115,5.0,10/9/2011,XLT Santa Fe Chicken Salad. I love this Place.
Dawn M.,"Los Angeles, CA",161,61,17,4.0,7/10/2013,"Love the Cheesecake Factory. Staff is always pleasant and friendly. Great menu options. However, I'm a little bombed that they don't accept reservations."
Asia G.,"Northridge, CA",87,29,,4.0,7/10/2011,"I've gone to many different Cheesecake Factories.  This one was certainly more fancy looking with stairs, escalators and elevators taking you to the second floor to where all the tables are. Upon coming inside, my friend and I were greeted with a friendly staff who immediately seated us although there was a wait for those who had a bigger group.  Our waitress was also very friendly, coming over and introducing herself to us, as well as telling us items that were not specifically listed in the menu.  My friend ordered a Jambalaya, which she thought was seafood, but it had chicken in it too...and I ordered the Pecan Crusted Catfish with Mashed Potatoes and and a Corn and Zucchini salad.  This dish was not on the menu and was referred to us by our waitress.  I have to say, it was really really good!!! I enjoyed this dish and so did my friend who ended up sharing with me.   Overall, we had a good time at the restaurant.  Liked how the staff was friendly and the service was up to par.  Definitely come here if you have the craving for something from Cheesecake Factory."
Naya N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,,5.0,8/9/2011,"I haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in probably 10 years, but I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. First of all, it is beautful inside.  The decor is really nice and the staff was quite friendly, even though the place was super busy. I went with 2 other people, and we all tasted each other's dishes. Everything was very good, and served hot.  The waiter was very attentive and accommodating. I recommend going on a weekday if you can, judging by how busy it was on a Thursday afternoon.   BTW, the lunch special was great, and you get so much!! I think it's a good deal for the money."
Janine H.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",1,7,42,4.0,9/17/2013,"When my family goes here, there would be a lot of people on the waiting list which sometimes gives us second thoughts. But one time we went here as a family of 7, we were tabled right away. I liked that. The food is very good and large. Its worth the money!"
Jean H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,15,,5.0,1/8/2015,"I absolutely love the cheesecake with strawberries.  The service at this location is exceptional.  I highly recommend the the broiled artichoke appetizer and for an entree, the delicious Lemon Herb Chicken."
Jordan H.,"San Francisco, CA",1077,264,38,4.0,3/11/2013,"Always a solid fallback. You know what you're getting here, and the service is always professional."
