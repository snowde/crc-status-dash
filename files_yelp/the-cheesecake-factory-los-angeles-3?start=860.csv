Robin F.,"Tucson, AZ",44,15,,4.0,11/2/2013,Great food. Large portions. Friendly staff. Nice decor.  Lots of selections.  The one notable problem is that it do darn noisy.  It is a safe bet if your party has diverse food preferences. The menu is quite diverse.
Lily G.,"South Gate, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/5/2015,"I had heard how good this restaurant was. So I decided to go on Saturday for dinner. And I fell in love with this place,very nice and clean restaurant. The only thing I didn't like was that I had to wait 1hour to be seated because it was full but it was worth it. The dish was really good and what can I say about the cheesecake it was delicious. And the service was good. Once they had a table they send me a text letting me know that it was ready."
Liz C.,"Los Angeles, CA",246,173,52,3.0,3/8/2011,"I think the only reason I come here is to get a reminiscent feeling of the days when I thought Cheesecake was the finest dining experience in all of Los Angeles (HA! Boy, was I wrong!) and I loved eating unhealthy 'cause I just didn't care -_-  Cheesecake is known for their huge portions and you're really paying the price for the ginormous portions here. I'm talking enough to dine-in and eat for lunch the day after, and in some plates, a mid-day snack. Huge.. Nearly everything I've had was delicious and filling. Pizzas are cooked to the perfect crisp and steaks are grilled to desired perfection. But they seem to all have one thing in common and it's how heavy these foods are. The salads give off this feeling too. Seriously, after I walk out of here, I don't feel like going back for another month or two. Service is on some days and then back off most days. One time, the kitchen ran out of fuel (Yeah, I know..) after we'd ordered our dinners and received our drinks. As if that wasn't bad enough, our server made us pay for our drinks, although we explained how ridiculous it was. So ridic. As you can tell, I have major mixed feelings about this here, Cheesecake Factory, at the Grove or anywhere else. It's just somewhere I'd be seen eating once in a long while. Oh, my latest experience was the bistro shrimp pasta. It's delicious, but you know just how bad it is for you when you discover the huge amounts of oil in the pasta sauce at the bottom of the plate. Hidden calories! *Free Wi-fi from the Apple Store available :D"
Jowel G.,"Covina, CA",151,377,987,4.0,3/6/2013,"It was such a great night to come out to have dinner at The Grove.  It's been so cold in L.A. lately that a couple of days of warm sunshine made me crave some rich, tasty food.  And it helps that I had a gift card from the past holiday. Our server Andre was the best - energetic, helpful and friendly.  We started with the tuna tartare.  Love it!  Wish this was all tuna - the avocado was rich and just the right taste.  I wanted to have something light and somehow ended up with chicken piccata over angel hair pasta. Tasty and honestly, this was light without the rich and super creamy sauce.  This meal was enough to have as 2 meals.  This is the only time that I get excited about the next day's lunch leftovers.  The hubs had his usual burger - plain and nothing fancy.  He doesn't complain about the burger but doesn't rave about it either.  I forgot to mention that the sangria is strong, but quite tasty.  As for cheesecake,  had to pass on that tonight, since we were headed to Sprinkles."
Evelyn V.,"Los Angeles, CA",368,289,566,4.0,3/5/2011,"There is nothing better than the Dulce de leche cheesecake!!! that's my favorite cheesecake in the whole wide world! I love their cheesecake, no one makes it better. BTW the location at The Grove is very cool, great ambiance, decor, service and their chicken madeira is my favorite entree. Overall great place but everyone has to try the dulce de leche cheesecake it's just too good!!!"
Marc W.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",123,27,32,5.0,10/26/2013,Fantastic lunch today. Started out with Mac and cheese balls that were so creamy and delicious and had one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. BBQ bacon cheeseburger with fried onion rings cooked medium rare. Tough to get a burger cooked to perfection but this was indeed! Our waiter was extremely accommodating and knowledgable.
GirlOnTheOcean R.,"Cranberry Township, PA",1,101,,1.0,12/9/2012,"NEVER AGAIN! This place has runied the Cheesecake Factory name.. and yes the food is delcious but the service is HORRIBLE and apparently so is management. I went here on a Saturday afteroon with my guy friend and his boyfriend (who I never met before), that were from out of town.... When our waitress came over, I (singular) asked her what the soup of the day was.. she told me, so I (singluar) asked her for a sample.. she came back with the sample of soup and THREE spoons... to share. I was the only one who asked to sample.. so then the two guys picked up the spoons, (mind you... one was coughing and sneezing all day  and im a germ a phob) well, I took a spoon and I picked up the bowl (bcuz the waitress put it in the center of the table). The waitress stood there shocked and seriously looked at me like I was rude.. then she was like.. ""well I guess Ill go get another one""...Long story short... my friends felt offended becuase I wouldnt share, i felt grossed out that she wanted me to share and I felt like I was put in a very ackward situation becuase really.. either way you wanna put it.. friends.. strangers.. etc.. soup is soup and sharing of soup is gross, its like sharing cereal.  So.... having been to MANY cheesecake factories... chicago... boulder, CO... palo alto.. ft. lauderdale.. etc.. I decided to write a letter to management at This particular restaurant.  I wrote a VERY detailed letter and NEVER HEARD BACK. I provided my phone number and my address and I never got a follow up call. And really.. to be honest, I was expecting a call AND a giftcard to come back. What happened to client satisfaction? I had a horrible embarassing experience and it should be made up for.  With that said, and the lack of management involvement, I wont be going back.. and thats too bad becuase I have A LOT of friends who visit me and A LOT of clients to bring out, and usually Cheesecake Factory is the #1 go to spot.. but not anymore, and Ill be telling all my coworkers as well.  Your loss....."
Nikki M.,"Bakersfield, CA",51,297,278,2.0,5/29/2013,"The service was good, but there were still problems. My husband ordered a chicken caesar salad with dressing on the side. It came without dressing and without chicken! He had to wait for them to fix it, so he watched me eat :("
Jackson H.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",7,2,,4.0,12/29/2010,My experience at the cheesecake factory was groovy.  The instant I sat down I was greeted by a beautiful perfectly square napkin which is good because I dislike the normal napkin fold ( i find triangles distracting) I had the privilege to try the smoke house BBQ burger which had wonder full beef (I'm very proud of the cow who produced my burger) along with bacon and a generous helping of onion rings I was stuffed like like a ham... Or turkey which ever you prefer to stuff in your free time. Oh and don't even get me started on the bread whenever I tried to  It squished down which led to me stabbing it repedly and torturing it telepathically.  After that I was thrown out for defacing their bread well let me tell you I will never go back there again!
Robert D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,5,5.0,6/30/2013,"really tasty food in Cheesecake Factory, had a great night with friends, the waiter there can remember everything we ordered without taking any notes, but there were 10 of us. Amazing!"
Melinda B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,9,3.0,10/26/2015,"This is a nice place to go for dinner but they get extremely crowded and don't take reservations. It's a first come first serve bases or at least that's what I was told . I walked in about 5:30pm on a Friday night with a group of 14 and we waited to be seated till 8:30pm. The wait was worth it because the food was good and they did their best to serve us in a timely manner after we were seated but when it came time for desert and the check we could not find a waiter to help us.  I felt like after waiting 3 hours to be seated my service would have been a little better . I still left a decent tip because I know they work hard and it was busy but I feel like they should either hire more people to work the weekends or start taking reservations ! I had to ask about getting water and bread and those are two things we should have had as soon as we sat down ! So if you have a large family I would not advise going here , seems like they can only handle 3-4 at a time !"
Maritza B.,"Downey, CA",0,15,1,4.0,8/11/2013,Good food ......but long wait time dfntly worth it.....red vlvt chscake is the best
Kevin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,99,1,4.0,5/16/2011,"I tried their jambalaya, madeira, king kong cocktail and the anniversary chocolate cheesecake. The food was solid, and so is atmosphere.  The cocktail was win. DELICIOUS simply delicious I wanted to get the ingredients to try and make my own version of it. Their cheesecakes are also very delicious but a bit pricey, but hey... its the cheesecake factory :( Otherwise, its a very solid place."
jeremy g.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,55,15,5.0,1/6/2014,Love eating at this location. The staff is very effective and efficient. Good job!!
Won P.,"Cerritos, CA",607,179,29,5.0,4/2/2010,"Came here with a few friends to grab lunch. this cheesecake factory is located in the grove so there is plenty of parking since u park in the parking garage. on top of that, if u eat here, u get validation (which is good for 2 hrs of parking).  i really like the initial feel of this cheesecake factory because when u enter this cheesecake factory, the host/hostess greets u and then u go up the escalator to go to the desk in which they go ahead and seat u. just the fact that you go up the escalator just makes u feel like a little high class. haha. anywayz, we got the pasta de vinci, the bistro shrimp pasta, this one hamburger (unfortunately i totally forgot the name of the hamburger my friend got) and this new shrimp dish they have on their specials menu here. along with that, we decided to try out their new warm crab and artichoke dish. for starters, the crab and artichoke dish was quite tasty. like when it first comes out, ure kind of like, that's it? because its pretty small but the actual crab in the dish is very good. kinda tastes like a crab salad. and then they give u some crostini bread pieces to eat with the crab dip and the bread pieces are like crisped perfectly. i would definitely say to try this new appetizer.  man i forgot how good the pasta de vinci is here! this is a penne pasta that comes with this light brown wine sauce and it just makes the dish so darn savory. on top of that, it comes with nicely cooked mushrooms and small juicy pieces of chicken. yum! i couldnt try my friends shrimp dish that he got cuz he was sick, but he told me that it was pretty darn tasty. along with that, the bistro shrimp pasta is tasty as well. just a hint for u with that pasta though, ask for some lemon and squeeze it over the pasta and it just makes it taste amazing. lemon just makes seafood taste so good :-) on top of that, the waitress we had was quite friendly as well. its always nice to get good service."
Nicholas C.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,3,,4.0,8/27/2013,"Well, how can you go wrong, Cheesecake, nice atmosphere, good drinks, I am a fan. I actually ran into this spot coming from the theater next door. I wanted to give it a ""look-see"" so I walked in and went to the front counter. The bar area was huge, it was just tempting me, telling me to ""come sit"". I made the mistake sitting because 2 hours later, I was stuffed and barely able to move. The food was great, the service was great. There is a balcony to sit outside and people watch, you may even be able to pick up the sounds of live music coming from the courtyard. Good experience."
Mrs S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,17,7,1.0,7/2/2013,No stars if I could. My husband and I came in with our daughter and the service was absolutely horrible. The staff treated us like we owed them something for being there. The hostess was so rude we left without even being seated. After she told us the wait was ten minutes and we had been there for twenty. I would never go back to this location ever.
Rissa H.,"Chico, CA",40,21,107,2.0,4/15/2012,"First off, I'm a harsh reviewer. Very hard to please and extremely picky. I've never had a problem with the wait but I always just sit at the bar. I'm not a fan of their main dishes. Mine usually are over cooked and bland. Their cheesecake is amazing however and the wine isn't all that bad. Over priced but not bad. I've been trying out their appetizers and the flat breads are great. The bread is always warm and the food comes out quick. Its a good choice for large groups because they do have a huge menu with something for everyone. Especially if your crowd likes chain restaurants. Just be ready to wait an hour for a table."
Nam L.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,7,,5.0,8/19/2013,"I am not a big fan of Cheese Cake, it's too sweet for my taste, but I love their Special Chinese Chicken Salad, Hibachi Steak, and all the appetizers, love love love !!!"
Virginia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,98,43,3.0,1/10/2013,"There is always a long wait and there is no calling ahead to be put on the wait list so if you come for dinner, expect to wait. I've never had an issue with the actual service once we've been seated, the waiters/waitresses have always been really nice but the front staff definitely needs a lesson in customer service..."
