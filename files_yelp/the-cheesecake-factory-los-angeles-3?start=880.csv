Emily G.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,17,,4.0,8/10/2011,"I really enjoy this restaurant. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the staff at the front. They were extremely rude to us last time we were there. The only reason we didnt leave was because it was our anniversary and we always go to the Cheesecake Factory on it. Otherwise, we would have left due to how rude the guy at the front desk was to us. Otherwise, the food is really excellent and the wait staff has always been great!"
Johua K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/8/2013,I just called with few questions. Answered by a gentleman and was hung up during my question. Where did customer service go?  And they want to be considered as quality dine in restaurant?  Tsk tsk tsk on you Cheesecake Factory...
Robert V.,"Seattle, WA",29,13,,3.0,10/1/2010,"Food 3 Stars - Service NO Stars Cheesecake Factory is the Cheesecake Factory.  Their food will always be solid(depending on your taste that is).  But you would think at a location like The Grove, they would have their sh*t together?   SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE 30 minute wait - Fine Five minutes for 1st hostess to seat us - Table not bussed Sent back Five more minutes for 2nd to hostess to seat us - 2nd table not bussed  . . . 20 minutes for us to get the check Contemplating DINE & DASHING  . . . Chickened out :/ . . . 20 more minutes for them to get my card . . . Really?"
Elissa K.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,4,1.0,10/17/2014,"Worst service ever! I didn't even come here to dine-in because my dog was with me (little chihuahua) so I was just going to pick up. I asked twice if I could bring my dog in to order to-go and bounce... The ladies at the door said, ""of-course, yes, totally fine!"" I go up the escalator, order my food and am waiting so I can bounce when a really mean blond manager comes up to me all upset about me bringing the dog in... She gave me crap and was super super mean and so rude about it! And I was like, ""woman, you tell your personnel that dogs aren't allowed!"" They totally gave me wrong info... Ughh. I get it dogs aren't allowed everywhere but don't tell me they are and then when I'm about to leave make a HUGE fuss about it PULEAASE...!"
Josh A.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,25,4,1.0,12/8/2011,"I just got manhandled here. No, really. The server put his hand on my shoulder, squeezed it, ran it across my back-- it was horrendous. The girl I was sitting with (we both work in restaurants) had a great laugh at my obvious (to anyone but MALE SERVER WHO KEPT PUTTING HIS HANDS ON ME) discomfort every time he came to the table, because he kept TOUCHING ME. Note to anyone in the service industry: Don't touch the guests. A glancing quick touch on the elbow to let them know you're walking behind them in a crowd, I understand. Molesting an innocent diner every single time you come to the table??? Holy moly, that was about the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Dude, I'm not your friend, I don't know you, and I don't want your hand on me. Not gently resting on my shoulder while you ask me how my food is, not slowly dragging your hand across my back and letting it come to a rest in the middle of my back when you tell me you'll refill my drink, not to squeeze my arm as you laugh at your own joke. Never. Blech. Ick.  If I'd wanted that I'd have gone to a massage parlor.  Oh, the food was fine.  Sheesh."
Maria A.,"Washington, DC",404,287,7,3.0,12/16/2010,"I've been to this particular location a couple of times... the food is generically the same at every location, so it's kind of hard to mess that up. The service was slightly off this past week, I went for dinner, and the wait was ridiculous. I was told it would be a 30 minute wait (on a tuesday night) but ended up waiting and waiting and waiting. Approached the desk and they said 6 more minutes, and we proceeded to wait for another 15. Once we were shown in, the hostess couldn't find a table for us, so she hurried and cleared a dirty table that had just been vacated. She had us sit while the table was still sticky wet (from the cleaning rag) and there were crumbs all over the seats. Off night for Cheesecake Factory at The Grove?--- Maybe. I still enjoyed my avocado egg rolls and delicious bread. Yum yum."
Sophie B.,"Central LA, CA",1,42,1,4.0,10/10/2014,"Service was pretty good. Restaurant was busy. 30 minute wait, but that's usual here. My burger did have some paper left on the patty which was a bit yuk, but not the end of the world. Delicious fries with my burger and amazing lemon meringue cheesecake :)"
Katrana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,50,,4.0,5/17/2011,"I had to pair my other Cheesecake Factory review with the one that I frequent the most, which is The Grove. Let me get this out of the way and mention the cheesecake. It's good, so, so good. But I would say that about most cheesecakes regardless of the vendor. Still, cheesecake. I typically order the crispy beef which hasn't disappointed me yet. Some of their other stuff can be very hit and miss, such as the Bistro Shrimp Pasta which used to be my go-to dish. I've seen lots of reviews for the miso salmon so I'm definitely going to try that next, which will probably be this weekend.  Unfortunately, the wait here seems more ridiculous than other places so plan accordingly. You can only spend so much time at the equally ridiculously crowded Apple store across the way or you probably get through quite a few books at the Barnes and Noble next door.  The decor, food and service is pretty consistent across all of their stores although we had a less than enjoyable experience at this particular spot when we went for lunch. The silverware was dirty, and so was the coffee. And since I knocked the other place for their parking, The Grove validates for the first hour and CF validates for the first two.  Also, cheesecake."
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1464,987,1073,5.0,1/21/2012,"CHEESECAKE IS LOVE.  The Grove is such an excellent location, and you can also get your parking validated (multiple people can!) , even though you will still pay a nominal fee ~$3.  The weather was so great so we couldn't help but sit outside... ignore the glare.  So wonderful here.  Excellent service.  So polite!  So chill.  Pasta da Vinci is my personal favorite... wonderful mixing of mushrooms, thick sauce ( NOT tomato based or cream based ), tender chicken pieces, and perfectly boiled pasta.  Everyone at our table ordered our favorites (regular favorites) so we enjoyed a very satisfying meal~  Oh my goodness, love the grove, and love cheesecake (not the cake)."
lee z.,"Glendale, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/5/2014,Where to start? The 30 minute wait that ended up being 50 minutes. The server that never checked on us once or refilled our drinks (but managed to spend several minutes flirting with the table next to us). Nightmare experience at this location. This has been a 2 hour ordeal that still hasn't ended.
Bebe K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",14,98,,4.0,5/26/2012,This is the very best Cheesecake ever!!!  Even when it is so crowded you can't move....the time goes fast and they seat you in no time at all.  Ask for Andrew...he is the sweetest and most attentive guy around!!!  I will be back again soon!
Cess C.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,12,,3.0,6/19/2013,I am giving the Cheesecake factory 3 stars because the wait it's way too long. You can't make reservations because this location is always packed! The food is good tho. I do enjoy their drinks! Another bad thing is that it is way too crowded and the tables are so close together. If you are cluster phobic then this is not the place for you. On the bright side the desserts are good!
Crystalle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,45,,3.0,12/20/2012,I like the Grove location. It's nice to be able to sit outside upstairs and enjoy the view. The food at Cheesecake Factory is always just okay to me. I like to order the sweet corn tamale cakes and make a meal out of it. If I'm really hungry I'll order a pasta but they're nothing special. Obviously the cheesecakes here are to die for - the strawberry and kahlua cheesecakes are my faves. It's always busy here but the staff makes sure to be attentive.
B P.,"San Diego, CA",9,16,,2.0,8/11/2010,"My two girlfriends and I went here for dinner last night. Normally CF is pretty solid in terms of their consistency, but this time was a miss for the most part.  The food was alright, but the drinks were horrible. I had the Chicken Caesar Salad. Our server suggested I get the half order and she was right on. It was huge, it was delish and still at a half order, I ended up taking half of it home. My two friends both ordered the Chinese Chicken Salads. Both were unhappy and agreed that the salads were dry and bland; the dressing had no flavor to it, and would NOT recommend. I took a bite and actually agree, the salad was pretty gross.  As for cocktails, order doubles if you wanna get your buzz on, otherwise you might as well save the $12 per drink. Our drinks were completely watered down and it took our server over 20 minutes each time to get our drinks out. I could semi-understand if we ordered a Mojito or something blended, but we ordered your basic 2 ingredient cocktails. STAY AWAY from their Long Island Iced Tea. Licking the floor of an adolescent boys locker room would've tasted better. Most definitely the worst I've had anywhere.  Other than the Chicken Caesar Salad, everything else, including service, was a bust this time."
Kendra S.,"Charleston, SC",7,56,11,4.0,10/31/2009,"I like Cheesecake Factory.. I love this particular one. Everyone knows the quality of the food at The Cheesecake Factory - if you don't, well get on up and get'cha some.. Most everything on the menu is great, and the portion sizes are HUGE. Never waited more than 20 minutes for a table here.  (I think their trick of telling you it'll be 30 minutes, then getting you seated in 15 is fantastic psychology!!)  Their outdoor seating is great, and a little quieter than inside. (They stay busy, and the sound echoes, so you gotta talk pretty loud to hear the people at your table here.) Their beer is ICE cold..  I mean, so cold I imagine they probably have ice crystals all over their tap.  Fat Tire freezing.. yum.  Seriously, it's not usually the place I think of when I want a beer, but they pour perfectly! The staff here has been incredibly wonderful. I've had the wrong dish delivered to me once, and it was corrected almost instantaneously. Hey, when you're as busy as they are, mistakes are bound to happen - it's a matter of how you correct it that makes a difference, and this place just shines."
Eileen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",585,580,2389,4.0,8/31/2010,"i've been to a lot of cheesecake factories and this one is by far, my favorite. i was amazed simply by the fact that it was two stories.... lobby area downstairs and restaurant upstairs.  i went with a couple of friends for happy hour. the menu was pretty extensive with food and libations. i ordered a full sampler dish and it was only $5. the drinks were equally priced... mixed cocktails were $5 and pint sized beers were $4, so i went a little happy with all the food and drinks... we also had the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake... normal priced but so worth it left cheesecake factory a little too full to walk, pretty tipsy, and super happy :)"
J S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,59,,3.0,8/17/2014,"Good food, friendly staff, but long wait to be seated and slow service.  This place is so crowded it's a pain to even get your name on the list."
Tiana H.,"Austin, TX",1021,568,255,5.0,8/30/2012,"Eleanor best manager ever. Whoever hired her, found a gem. I was almost giving up on CF after many, MANY, incidents with my food allergies and always having my order wrong. Then Eleanor came to the rescue. Super nice and even gave me a piece of cheesecake and asked if I was feeling ok."
Josh A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,48,,3.0,6/18/2013,"The location: dazzling, with a fantastic view of The Grove. Convenient but a little pricey after a morning/afternoon of intensive shopping. The food? I remember that the burgers I ordered tasted raw and were disgusting...I refused to touch them after that...the cheesecake good but too thick and rich. :p"
Akira T.,"東京都, Japan",19,31,1,5.0,8/26/2012,The server Paul was nice. Also the food was very delicious. Recommended for any cheesecake lovers...
