T M.,"Fairfax, VA",0,40,60,4.0,8/1/2014,Miso salmon with snow peas and white rice. Different and delicious. My only request would be that wild sockeye salmon was used instead of farm raised. Other than that I would recommend going here.
Cybermunch C.,"South East LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,2.0,4/5/2013,"The menu is way too big, plus i didnt appreciate the ""cheesy"" advertisments in it. Really?  Give me a break. Food was ehh, but cant get past the money hungry adds in the menu while most everything is over priced."
Erica H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",60,42,11,1.0,9/21/2014,"I ordered the to go menu of just cheesecake and pasta they said it would be about 15 minutes, I waited an HOUR! The blonde girl lost my receipt and was trying to ignore me to avoid the problem. Many people came after me and had huge orders and still got it before me. They need to be more organized or don't put your new employees (she seemed new and no clue what she was doing) on the busiest shifts on the weekend."
Tamara T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,13,1,5.0,5/27/2013,"This place is usually very busy but always worth the wait I love the vibe, the food and great service have been going to cheesecake for years and its always been a pleasure.Easy going atmosphere very kid friendly so we can get away with taking our kids here without people staring at us funny : ) great location !!!"
Daniel D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,261,53,4.0,11/10/2012,"so i have to write a review, good place, good food, good location, but horrobly bad when it is packed and the wait is too long and hectik. with no reservations, I dont rely on this place for my dining needs."
Ricardo G.,"Baldwin Park, CA",8,10,18,4.0,7/20/2015,"been here a few times, everything I've tried is good, and everyone is really nice. but the waiting is the only downfall."
Amy M.,"Hemet, CA",951,67,19,5.0,9/20/2012,"Food was excellent, great portions, waitress knowledgeable!  Omg! Carrot Cake Cheesecake!  A must!  Also, had a taste of plain Cheesecake with Hot Fudge! Wow!"
Kai L.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",1131,411,803,2.0,7/14/2009,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, so if you've been to one before, you already know about the food choices and the cold-case of whole cheesecakes available near the front of the restaurant. This one is no different so far as the food selection goes -- you get moderately sized dishes at moderate prices  -- with nothing on the menu being particularly outstanding and worthy of making a specific trip out there. Even the vaunted cheesecakes, supposedly so delicious that the restaurant itself is named for their sake -- aren't anything to write home about. Basically, if you're already at The Grove, tired from shopping (or holding someone else's purse while they try on stuff) and aren't in the mood for something quick and cheap (such as a Wetzel's Pretzel or just eating in the food court in the Farmer's Market), The Cheesecake Factory is an okay choice if you aren't planning a romantic date or don't mind the sound of screaming children and metal and ceramic dinnerware being plonked down onto kitchen counter tops by the staff. Once you get into the restaurant and ride the escalator (yes, an escalator) to the second-floor dining area, you will sort of feel a ""cafeteria"" or ""Hometown Buffet"" type vibe to the place, which, depending on your particular mindset, could be a good or bad thing. Even though you're on the second floor, don't expect any sweeping views of the scenery outside. Yep, blocked! Compared to other Cheesecake Factory locations (such as Sherman Oaks or Beverly Hills), The Grove location has rather middling service that is hit or miss, not that ANY Cheesecake Factory is all that great anyway, though: at The Grove, sometimes your server will be great, sometimes he or she doesn't want to be at work, and their expression and service shows it. Did you finish off your Coke? Yeah, well, expect to wait ten or fifteen minutes for it to get filled up again. If you're planning a more grown-up style outing such as a date or dinner with other grown up friends and would like a more mature atmosphere, Morel's French Steakhouse or Wood Ranch BBQ and Grill (both within the same outdoor mall as Cheesecake Factory) are much better choices.  Ironically, Anne Morton's and Wood Ranch BBQ aren't much more pricey than Cheesecake Factory, and will usually serve you more quickly and more pleasantly -- in a pleasanter (is that a word? No? Well, it stays) atmosphere to boot. Overall, this Cheesecake Factory feels like a factory, where you, the customer, are on an assembly line waiting your turn to get pushed around and annoyed for a while, before finally leaving a bunch of money behind to thank them for the favor."
sebastian r.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,94,,3.0,10/19/2010,So far the service and the reps were COOL BUT THE last time i went some bold headed wanna be thug was like YEA you cant plug in ur laptop and we have no wifi! ...ANYWAY !! if there gonna hire stupid people...this would make it a great way for me NOT TO GO cause i dont like loud places... CONSIDERING ive used the wifi and have taken my laptop many times there but the chick was COOL she was like yea totally COOL let me find you a table were you can do what you need to do.... LOVE THERE carmel cheesecake...!
Janice S.,"Allen, TX",0,11,7,1.0,8/4/2014,"Horrible service!! I received my salad before I had silverware to eat it with! Jessica was my server....monotone voice, only checked on me one time, acted like she didn't want to be here either. Will not patron this location again!"
Lawrence C.,"New York, NY",325,290,5,3.0,8/5/2009,"I don't think the cheesecake factory is the best place to go.  But it's a very good mix of what you need if you are in a group of people with varying tastes.  All the entrees and appetizers are a very good size.  THere's always a wait, no matter what time of day you want to go.  My personal favorite is the chicken madeira. Try all these cheesecakes, they're all very good.  A bit on the pricey side, but the portions are relatively big."
Linda A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/30/2014,"Went last night for dinner.... The service was slow, the nachos had a substitute nacho cheese,  the buffalo wings were dry, even the cheesecake did not have the delicious taste it usually has???  It is time to try another restaurant."
Tori A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,4/19/2013,"I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory before several times and something must be wrong with their washing machine or management is not supervising adaquately or they just don't care but the plate used to eat the courtesy bread was DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY, GREASY AND SMELLY. It looked as if it was wiped down with a dirty towel or with the hand and it smelled like rotten eggs. Do they just use water to rinse these plates??? I can only imagine what the plates with the meals look like. The cup given to me for my tea looked dirty and was scratchy everywhere I didn't finish my tea because I felt disgusted. To top that off, I asked two different people to give me a cleaner plate and sadly enough, I was practically given the same dirty, smelly dish. Scientifically, if a swab was rubbed across these plates, I know for a fact it would show several bacterias present and that's what your eating. I had to put a napkin over my plate to eat my bread. It was disappointing because this could potentially be a health hazard!! This may be a small issue for some but  cleaneliness needs to be a TOP PRIORITY for every restauran regardless of  status. Some people don't have a habit of washing their hands before eating and when they touch these plates, their germs from picking their nose and heaven knows what else they pick and touch, ends up in those half-washed plates!! Gross but TRUE!!!  So Cheesecake from The Grove, PLEASE get it together and find out what's going on with your washing and disinfecting system. You served many people and I know you are super busy. If what's working right now is not working, then figure out how you can change it, get a bigger machine or hire more people to wash dishes PROPERLY. It's going to be a while before I return to eat at your restaurant (not that it will matter or make a difference to you), but others will definitely read this. Good luck!"
Barbara L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,15,,5.0,8/29/2014,So disappointed that with our visit to the Cheesecake Factory in Woodland Hills Ca the menu had changed.  Our favorite appetizer had been removed.  It was the Fire Roasted Chili Rellinos.  They were so yummy and always ordered them twice a week.  It would be great if they would bring them back
Charity J.,"Los Angeles, CA",239,16,3,5.0,8/26/2011,My husband and I love coming here whenever we have a date night to spare.  I love the atmosphere and the food.  The location is convinient and I have never come across a server that was not fantastic.
Stephanie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,129,15,2.0,5/30/2010,"They have great toasted bread!  The rest of the meal was a disappointment though. Got the artichoke dip-- really bland and felt greasy going down. Disappointing but fixable with some salt and lots of water. Got a spicy beef dish which was way too salty.  Like they accidentally put too much on.  It wasn't spicy either. The spicy chicken dish had uncooked rice but the chicken was good. If I wasn't so grossed out by the food, I would have gotten dessert. Nice customer service but even they couldn't savage the place.  I would come back but not to this one.  Everyone is always raving about Cheesecake Factory so I will try some of their other dishes."
Andrew D.,"San Leandro, CA",57,15,149,4.0,9/4/2012,"I eat here all the time. They serve as much bread as you can ask for, a sourdough and a wheat bread as well, and they both taste great. I usually eat so much of it that I barely have enough for their entrees. Today I ordered the Chicken Bellagio which consists of spaghetti noodles with a cream based pesto sauce (but I substituted the sauce for marinara so that it wouldn't be as heavy). It also includes arugula salad with prosciutto and some breaded chicken breast. I order this dish often, but this was the first time I substituted the sauce and it turned out great. The portions are huge, so I took half to go."
mugen k.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,19,1.0,2/4/2015,"you can tell a lot about a company by their website, i think we can all agree on that. go to their website and tell me if you see a photo of a ribeye steak? or a filet minon? people want to see what your food looks like. very limited photos of food you probably dont want to eat. i guess this is their subliminal way of getting you to eat only the foods they bother to take a photo of on their website. and who the hell authorized this way of promoting their company website?  the people want to see everything you have on the menu. what you cant afford to have a professional website where customers to see the food you make?    i would have loved to go to the cheesecake factory but id like to see how my ribeye will look like, among many many other foods they have no photos of on their website..........dont believe me check their website out......"
Lani K.,"San Jose, CA",3,39,8,1.0,3/24/2014,"Every time I come here it literally takes them 15 min to bring us our drinks and that means water or anything else. We even timed it once. Same with checks, the waiters are no where to be found and when we finally hunt them down it will still be another 20 minutes until we are waking out of the door. And this is anytime, not just weekends"
Jenny J.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,126,66,1.0,5/16/2011,Sigh... Hit or miss but usually a miss than a homerun. Today was a very suprising day off and decided to eat a late lunch/early dinner with the bf.  1 star for a quick wait.  -1 for not giving an inside outside choice. As I type the wind is blowing a bit. -2 for not putting our appetizer in. We order wontons before the course and it must've went through one ear out the other and must've been invisible ink he used.  -1 for the disgusting chunks of meat. Isnt cheesesteak suppose to be thinly slices of delish meat covered in melted cheese? Yeah right. Disgusting unseasoned meat just cooked and placed over bread with cheese. Are you serious? as i picked at it i saw a huge slab rolled off...sigh.... -2 WTF There is hair in my disgusting cheesesteak. Are you serious????? .5 for getting the shepards pie right. Only .5 since it tastes a bit off to me. The bf doesnt care but thats cause hes hungry and would eat anything at this point. Oh come on ground beef? Can you guys get any cheaper?  Manager stopped by apologized offered something else. No thank you I will pass forever from this.  This was my first meal of the day and thanks alot cheesecake factory.
