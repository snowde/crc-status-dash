Steph O.,"Culver City, CA",2,33,1,5.0,3/30/2013,"The place was packed, no room to sit, they told us 45 minutes, thank god, we found a great table at the bar section, had an amazing little chicken or chicken littles, it was great, watched a basketball game, how can you go wrong, the waitress was great, everything was perfect, the grooves was PACKED."
Emilie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,5,,4.0,2/24/2013,"I had heard a lot about this restaurant and so I went for the first time and I really loved it!  We were lucky with my girlfriend to eat outside on the terrace. My friend took a hamburger she adored, while I took pasta, it was good too. And for dessert the fresh strawberry cheesecake was absolutely delicious! I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendliness of the servers. It is a very friendly place."
Renee Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,55,17,1.0,5/1/2009,"I used to like eating at this place, but NEVER AGAIN! The wait time is ridiculously TOOOOOOO LONG for the amount of people I come in with. My boyfriend and some friends took me here for my birthday in January (it was on a Sunday also--LAST YEAR 2008). A party of 8, our wait time was 3 freaking hours! We put in our name at 6 and got to sit down around 9, and didn't get our food until close to 10pm! Everyone in my group was angry and talked to the manager because people with a larger party number were seated before us even when they put their names in after us!!! Horrible. Service is extremely slow on a regular weeknight, and service in the weekend: lunch, dinner is even worse! I do not recommend this place or any other Cheesecake Factory here in Los Angeles. SAME THING WITH THE AMERICANA LOCATION (Glendale)!"
Dana N.,"Pasadena, CA",89,13,3,3.0,11/11/2009,"My husband and I grab dinner at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove. I order a Pineapple Mojito and the waiter that night took forever to place our orders! When my Mojito came out I saw something dark and weird on the mint garnish. I thought it was fake and when I looked closer, I saw a huge slug crawling on the mint leaf! Our waiter wasn't coming around, so we got the attention of another waiter and had him take it back. The manager came to apologize and told me that they're produce and herbs all came fresh from the farmer's market. Does that mean they don't wash it? I mean this slug was huge! I don't know how they missed it. They gave me a replacement drink, this time with no slug, but when we got our bill they charged me for the drink! I should have complained, but I was too tired and didn't want to deal with it."
Liana C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,8,4.0,12/5/2013,"Love this location. Service is always good,food is always delicious,and prices are good! Bread and butter is the absolute best! Some of my favorites- Chicken & shrimp gumbo, club sandwhich, avacado egg rolls."
Alex R.,"Fullerton, CA",9,29,36,5.0,5/28/2012,"The best part was not the smash potatoes but the waitress she was help full, friendly and extreamly nice. For this being my first time to the Factory if I could I give 10 STARS **********"
Fred V.,"San Gabriel, CA",178,35,2,4.0,4/21/2012,"Only 4 stars because I like the restaurant, and The Grove, but the wait is probably the worst of any cheesecake factory locations."
Tim H.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,196,116,2.0,5/25/2010,"Wow, I was so surprised, the food here is actually OK. I was expecting tourist fast food, but it was tasty. Now, the food did take a tad more than an hour to get to my table and was missing ingredients, but it was still very good food.  The waiters, apparently you get to have three or four waiters, are OK.  I got my drink after about 25 minutes, but the bread did come after only a 15 minute wait. The first waiter took the drink order, and soon after, the second waiter took the drink order again.  BUT, he also took the food order. Waiter three brought the drink order, after I asked about it three times. Waiter three took the desert order, and waiter four dropped it off. The bill was not horrible, a bit more than it should be - but this is a tourist place, so it is what it is.   The serving size is way WAY more than you need.  I recommend splitting an entree.   I don't think I will be back again, as this dinner took more than 90 minutes, and was a simple two course meal consisting of a tostada salad and a piece of cheesecake. With so many employees, I think that the higher bill pays for the extra staff.  It is nice in this economy to know that some employers hire more than they need.  I only wish I could have received the right food order within 30 minutes of giving it to the waiter. I would pass on this place, unless you have out-of-town visitors coming that just must visit.  If you really need to go, plan to spend a little extra cash, a lot of time, and for the food to be OK. I liked my tostada salad, it was really quiet tasty!  The cheesecake?  Well, I appreciated knowing that one slice was just over 1400 calories, and was lower than many!  OMG! Oh, I forgot to mention.  You get a pager, so you can shop and wait for your turn to be seated.  Then, after that 30 minute wait, you get sent upstairs, where you wait another 15 minutes to be seated.  Time from checking in to getting food, almost two hours.  Uh.....  I just don't understand the appeal? Maybe you could order, go see a movie, and when you get out and have a table ready, with food all set?  That would be the way to go, since the theater is right next door! Enjoy!"
Mona O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,15,,4.0,9/19/2012,"I love this restaurant for the food, and of course their decadent cheesecakes. But this location is particularly beautiful and unique. The wait might be a little long sometimes during the day, but you can make reservations before 6 p.m. It's worth it though...you can always kill some time in the mall until the beeper goes off. The waiters are very friendly, however the service might be a little slow if it is busy.   Try the Hershey's cheesecake, and then they have 45 other kinds of cheesecake! Overall, a great experience with good food and ambiance."
Aisha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,45,2,2.0,4/11/2012,Food standard is cheesecake quality but the wait at the grove is always between 30-60 minutes. I feel that the tables are closer together in this particular cheesecake so it's harder to have a conversation with your own party.
gallardo m.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/27/2012,"The best I'm a fun of The Cheesecake Factory, great food exellente Service and location, i love this place."
Stephanie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,16,,3.0,4/23/2010,"Every time I have been to this Cheesecake Factory there has been a wait. Also I don't know what the deal is but our server also has always gone on break and been replaced. Not a bad thing just weird.  So they do not have a gluten free menu or list allergens on their website. But they are helpful accommodating special diets. I usually get the salmon. I have gotten burgers before protein style. You can usually replace any of the sides. I switched fries for broccoli. (I know, it broke my heart too!)  I love The Grove but I like the Marina Del Rey Cheesecake Factory better.  Sadly if you are gluten free I don't think any of the cheesecakes are. There is a flour-less Godiva but I believe I've read Godiva may cross contaminate so be careful depending on your intolerance."
nacia z.,"San Diego, CA",7,66,1,1.0,6/6/2009,"if you never been a server at a busy cheescake factory like this one...dont complain. Its busy and most people in LA need there ""emotional banks"" filled by other people they and want everything and anything at once. Sorry a server is only one person that has 5 tables at once, so stop complaining. Management sucks. You don't want to know how the food is handled or prepared, or how much butter is in that bistro pasta ( lets just say its a lot more then one whole stick.)  Not a fan.  The restaurant used to be good, almost formal dinning, it is now another fridays"
Alicia R.,"Bell, CA",1,22,7,5.0,5/2/2014,Never disappointed. I love the Sheila's cashew salad! I always take my leftovers. Portions are big. Passion mojito is my favorite! And can't leave without ordering Linda's Fudge Cake to go!
Y C.,"Pasadena, CA",2,66,9,3.0,3/13/2012,"I came here with my 5-yr old daughter twice in the past month.  She liked it very much -- I suspect a major reason was that the long wait for our seats would allow her to play with the iPad for a full hour at the Apple Store nearby.  The food was Ok, but on the bland side.  I had the jambalaya pasta the first time --- it was a major disappointment.  I had been expecting a cajun-flavored dish full of flavor, but it turned out without any flavor --- and the pasta was way overcooked.  I had a steak the second time --- that was Ok, the meat was tender, juicy and cooked to the right doneness.   The service was very good.  The waiter was very friendly."
Marcus B.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,77,6,2.0,1/30/2009,"I guess it must be a sign of my palette, general appreciation for food and restaurant tastes improving under the expert tutelage of Dawson S, because had I written a review of this place before I met her, I would have probably given Cheesecake Factory 5 stars! Now it is nothing more than a place to catch a quick bite at the bar (providing of course you can get a seat at the insanely small said bar) Lets face it, Cheesecake Factory is more of a place for families and tourists, and that is not necessarily a bad thing, but it ain't for me anymore. I find the food ok to good, but the fact that it is so generic has become a turn off for me. So yes, quick drink / bite at the bar - Yes. Full on meal - there are better places, which is nice."
Dawn H.,"Gassville, AR",0,64,4,5.0,10/2/2012,My favorite Cheesecake Factory! ! Service & food are always spot on & the drinks are to die for.
Antonio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,113,5,2.0,9/30/2011,"This is about my fifth time coming to the Cheesecake Factory. The service/food here has always been, ""meh"" on average if service and the quality of food are taken into account and taken as equally important [which is what I believe].  Food: The food itself is hit and miss. Sometimes you'll get great food and other times, you'll get flavorless food. Cashew Chicken usually tends to be flavorful and it is a good dish overall. However, I always ask for Asparagus to be placed in there. That didn't happen this time. The server, pretentiously, stated that anything extra wouldn't work with the dish. Please, I've tried it and it's better with asparagus. Anyway, it was a decent dish in the end. We also ordered Louisiana noodles which had such a subtle taste, that they might as well have been tasteless. Service: Terrible service. I'm in my late teens and I feel that because of this, the server looked down on us. My girlfriend wanted something like fried chicken, so I asked if they had any.   Know what the server responds? ""Well if you're looking for KFC style chicken...."" Really? He said it as if we should not be allowed into the restaurant for being young. That was pretty offensive but I took it. When I first had the guy, I believe his name was William but I am not quite sure....[big guy, about 6'1 and with a heavier rame]... I politely said, ""Excuse me"" to get his attention, considering he was 5 feet away and doing nothing. He does nothing.  ""Excuse me?"" I said again.  He turns around and said, ""Wait!"" and that was that. Overall, bad server. The funny thing is that toward the end, he started being extremely nice to us - gee, I wonder why. Once we gave him the tip (which was 10% for his lackluster service) he didn't even say thank you or have a nice day. In fact, he said nothing and looked down as if we were the ones who short-sided him. Service was quick. Ambiance: It's nice in there, too bad the lights are too dim to be able to see anything. Overall, this deserves two stars. It is  the definition, in my book, of what a two star rating on Yelp is."
Matthew J.,"Palos Verdes, CA",26,274,59,3.0,8/29/2011,My first visit to the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove.  Extremely busy but we skipped the lines and ate in the bar.  The restaurants at the Grove are rather bland.  I would walk a few steps west and eat at the LA Farmers Market.  Tons of little restaurants to chose from.
Toni L.,"Los Angeles, CA",907,873,3488,3.0,9/17/2007,"I can say pretty much the same thing about every Cheesecake Factory in the chain, so I will. 1) Long wait w/ no possibility for a reservation 2) BAD service 3) Fattening food that tastes awesome while you're in the restaurant but might give you indigestion after a few hours pass 4) Leftovers galore 5) Half cheesy (HAHAHA) half art nouveau decor which works in my opinion but I can see how it might not for everyone Some notes about this particular location: The balcony on the second story substitues for the patios that can be found at most CFs and is a wonderful place to eat as the sun goes down. I'm not sure why I'm mentioning this because it's not as if you get a choice in where you'll be seated."
