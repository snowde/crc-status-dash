Julie M.,"Gilbert, AZ",45,192,,3.0,1/11/2010,"Why are all Cheesecake Factories so chaotic and unorganized?  Why can they not get a handle on quoting correct wait times?  That has been my general experience with other Cheesecake Factories, and this one was no different.  We were quoted a 35 minute wait time and ended up waiting over an hour. The real reason to come here is for the cheesecake, but half of the time, I get so full on the bread, appetizer and/or entree that there is no room for dessert.  That's what happened to me this time.  Bummer!  I should wise up and just come in to order cheesecake to go. Our waitress was very friendly, though the only times we saw her were when she took our order and delivered our bill.  Other servers served our food and and refilled our drinks. The food was very good; hence the not having room for dessert dilemma.  I ordered off the specials menu and had the cashew chicken salad. Mixed greens, chicken, cashews tossed in some kind of vinaigrette.  I forget what flavor the vinaigrette was, but it definitely had a bit of an Asian flair to it.   I would highly recommend it. Chaos upon entering the restaurant, misleading wait time quoted, good table service, good food, chain restaurant = 3 stars."
Gee T.,"Montreal, Canada",4,59,,3.0,5/27/2010,"Great drinks, great appetizers. For a nice roly-poly Canadian like myself, just the right place.  THE GROVE, bay-bee. Movie stars and fancy cars.  Beautiful decor in here as well."
Michelle R.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,119,3,3.0,6/27/2009,"Meh. It's a cheesy (no pun intended) chain restaurant where tourists go.  Don't go in with any expectations, and you won't be disappointed. Normally, we would never even go to a place like this. But, after a tiring afternoon of shopping at the Grove, I wanted to pick something up to take home for dinner.  You have to fight the massive crowd of idjits downstairs to get upstairs to the dining room. I made my way to the take out area and placed my order. That part was fine. The bad part? The order took FOREVER and there was nowhere to sit. Nothing. Nada. Not even a counter to lean on. I've got a really bad back. So by the time my order was ready, all I wanted was a good pair of orthopedic shoes, a chenille robe and a goddamned nap! The only good part? The food. My boyfriend had the Pasta Bolognese and I had the Shrimp with Angel Hair.  Both were pretty tasty.  But the cheesecake? MAJOR disappointment. The guy who took my order recommended the Key Lime Cheesecake. Not. Good. Kind of bland. Nothing special. Which was shocking, since the only thing you really expect to be awesome at the friggin' 'Cheesecake Factory'? Is the friggin' cheesecake. I'd probably try this place again. But ONLY if: I've called in the order ahead of time, AND I picked a different type of cheesecake AND I went during an off-peak hour to avoid the retards lined up downstairs. FYI: gave it 3 stars instead of 2, because the pasta was good."
Joanna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,102,,4.0,8/23/2012,This is a great location for the Cheesecake Factory but it can get so ridiculously crowded. I hate waiting downstairs and then being in a huge crowd. It's difficult when you can't make reservations but I like that you can still walk around a few of the nearby shops while waiting.
Ly Thuy M.,"Burbank, CA",20,13,,4.0,8/22/2012,"Pretty easy getting seating if you head to the bar area, otherwise seating takes forever. Food is always consistent. Small plates are the way to go. Just beware, service is always iffy. Sometimes great sometimes snobby waiter having a bad day."
Vincent B.,"Arleta, CA",2,66,4,4.0,4/5/2012,"Well I  cannot really say anything bad , my wife and I were at the Grove we were hungry and there was no wait , we were seated right away and ordered some drinks , Mojitos they were tasty , my wife had the broiled salmon it was cooked perfectly , I had the crab hash with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce , it was great and the eggs were poached perfectly . I would have given them 5 stars but my table sucked the legs were not even I had to put a napkin under the leg to stop that cruise ship feeling , other than that it was a good experience !"
Mona M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",217,156,6,2.0,11/21/2008,"I see fat people. This place would scare M. Night. Story: Years ago when I was working myself through school I bartended at a little joint in Chicago that had a very small kitchen. We made great burgers. The guys from Second City frequented it for the cheap drinks and burgers. But we didn't have bacon. If I had a dollar for every time someone wanted a bacon cheeseburger, I would be a rich woman. I finally got smart and kept a secret stash of bacon in the fridge for the ""valued"" customers. So Oscar Meyer basically put me through school. The Cheescake Factory must have put a million health clubs into business by the look of the patrons. Or cardio surgeons. And the food? Passable. But an hour wait or longer for deep fried fat fried in fat is not my idea of a good time. Also, I am Pavlov's puppy when it comes to cheesecake. But this shit does not ring my bell. Overly processed, chemical tasting. Nothing to sit up and beg for."
Courtney S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/7/2012,"We went to the CF yesterday for lunch and had the most amazing experience thanks to our waiter Rob. He was absolutely wonderful. He was attentive, charming and extremely professional. Will be coming back again very soon..."
Keisha H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,258,170,4.0,10/7/2009,So we went Monday afternoon. Not crowded but a good deal of people for a Monday. But it is the Grove. My Buffalo Blast were a little over cooked which made me sad. I live for those damn things.  She and I shared a Double BBQ Bacon Burger. She was smiling and licking pickle juice from her fingers.  She seemed so pleased as she dipped her fries back and forth from the  ketchup and buffalo sauce. I love to see her smile. She makes working worth it just to spend money on her. I did not have my usual beer. I did not order my cheesecake. I just took in the beautiful mosaic decor and how the sun from the window glistened from her lips. It was another day for the books. I love the CCF.
Shakesha W.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",64,44,74,5.0,3/19/2012,"Can be a bit of a wait for seating, but it was worth it. The service was excellent our waiter Zack was a sweetheart, and catering without being over bearing.  Food was great, atmosphere was lively. I will definitely go again."
Alex B.,"Burbank, CA",0,15,,3.0,9/28/2012,"Waiting time is ridiculous! Food and service are just ok, because after all the wait you get really nervous!"
Spy Kitten S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/23/2011,"I ordered a burger and got food poisoning. The service was friendly, but awkward and slow. :-("
Jaime K.,"Malibu, CA",39,16,,4.0,9/14/2012,"I'm not embarrassed at all to say I love the Cheesecake Factory.  I have been to 2 different locations - WLA and the Grove, and I have loved them both.  My gf who is not an adventurous eater by far was visiting me from out of town and this is where we finally decided to go after a long discussion.  We are both greedy as ever so even though they have gargantuan portions we both ordered an app and an entree and dessert.  I did not say we ate it all I just said we ordered it......lol.  I had the vietnamese summer rolls, the caramel chicken, and the red velvet cheesecake.  She had the boston salad, jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp, and the key lime cheesecake.  We both enjoyed our food. I have to say that it was a great dining experience experience."
Karl M.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,31,,2.0,4/6/2010,"Don't know what my problem is, but I've never felt the pretty much universal love for this place in any of its incarnations.  A couple years ago a client gave me a hundred dollars in gift cards and I STILL haven't used them all up!   There's nothing WRONG with the food, really.  Maybe a bit too much salt in everything?  I can NEVER get enough water when I eat here no matter how attentive the busboy.  I've yet to taste anything that I would rate as special or worth the trip.  Portions are bloody MASSIVE, though - maybe that's what turns everyone on?   Their world-famous cheesecake certainly fills a hole.  A BIG hole.  LOTS of fun variations on the menu, to be sure, but every time I sample one I've found that it ""read"" better than it tasted.  I'm not wild about requiring a knife to cut cheesecake, either.  Could be this sort of thing comes with the territory in a chain such as this one.  Too bad."
Tara M.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,33,1,4.0,4/1/2012,"I should start by saying that I eat here about twice a month. The wait is long, but I don't mind shopping around while I wait for my buzzer to light up. It's kind of a given considering this is The Grove, and a major tourist attraction. The longest I have waited was 1 hour and 15 minutes on a Friday night, at 7pm. I don't think that's so bad, but I dine out frequently and am used to waiting for a bite to eat. The food is always awesome and I don't think I even need to comment on the cheesecake. The reason I subtracted a star is the waiters (not waitresses) are on the creepy side. I don't know what it is about their waiters, but they always seem to stare too long, or linger awkwardly. Be prepared for close dining quarters and big crowds. If that doesn't bother you and you are prepared to laugh off  the creep factor, you will have a delicious meal."
Rachael K.,"Los Angeles, CA",339,314,74,4.0,11/24/2008,"I had eaten at the Cheesecake Factory exactly once in my life prior to Saturday night - and I wasn't impressed. Yeah, they have everything, but if everything is only done in a mediocre way, what's the point??? Fast forward to Saturday and the boy and I have to go pick up catering for a family party. To be honest, when he told me that his dad went with Cheesecake Factory, I was pretty disappointed, but free is free and I wasn't gonna complain. The Grove on a beautiful Saturday night right before the Holidays is a scene. There's no way around it. We managed to find parking and fought our way thru the crowds (there was some sort of holiday show going on which made it even MORE crowded) but once we found our way into the Factory they made sure it was smooooooooth sailing. Once we gave the clerk our name and told them we had a catering order it was Mr. K this and Mr. K that. They were practically falling all over themselves to make us happy. They went thru the contents of each box with us, provided us with help out to the car and the manager made an appearance as well, making sure we had his business card to call him if we ran into any issues. I mean, it was all just a little over the top - in a good way. When we got the food home, I was surprised! It totally didn't suck and to be honest I actually liked the Chicken Madeira alot. It was pretty damn tasty. And the Avocado Eggrolls were pretty good too! Oh and the Pumpkin Cheesecake.... um. yeah.  I don't see myself saying, I really want Cheesecake Factory tonight! But if someone else does, I won't whine or pout. I'll just order the Chicken Madeira and smile!"
dvl ..,"West Hollywood, CA",35,40,5,1.0,5/20/2009,"This establishment is punishing cash paying customers by shorting the coinage and rounding down the change to dollars.  When I asked the server about it, I was told ""it's customary"" for them to round.  The Asst. GM (Robert Hester) couldn't sheepishly talk their way out of it, mumbled that it's not policy (but clearly he's turning a blind eye to it and therefore condoning it), and no one I spoke with asked to see my bill or offered me the change they shorted me. If it were a couple of pennies, I really wouldn't care, but it was $.35, and if they do this enough times in a day the restaurant is reconciling it's books with an additional couple hundred dollars a day of undeclared cash.   The food is not horrible, but remember to pay with plastic if you go here."
Garrett N.,"Reno, NV",8,45,3,3.0,6/5/2011,The only reason I go hear is for the miso salmon which is usually a hit everytime and sometimes I get a piece of cheesecake but everytime I order anything else I'm not a huge fan of it. I will stick to the miso salmon to be happy.
Dick T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,2,4.0,1/27/2009,"A lot of people have complained that the wait for a seat was long, and that is true on Friday Saturday & Sunday when The Grove is the busiest.  But that is what you have to expect when you want to dine at a popular restaurant.  My wife and I were there yesterday; it was a cold Monday night, 7:30 pm.  The place was busy, yet we got a seat in one minute.  The food came quickly, and the service was very nice."
Michelle K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",107,34,128,3.0,6/18/2012,get here early! seems like they always have a wait even for 2 people! ive been here 4 times during lunch hours with just one guest and we always have to wait 10 mins or so for a table.over all their bread and CHEESECAKES are delectable!
