Damnyo L.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,16,3,1.0,6/11/2011,"My shrimp wasn't de-veined on more than just my meal, my date's meal had poopoo shrimp too. When I sent it back, the manager came over and took care of the problem. He said I can get whatever I wanted and it was on him. Then when I ordered, they charged me. When i brought this to his attention he barely wanted to take it of my bill, after he said he was taking care of it. My waiter was loopy. It seemed like he was going through some things in his life. Because he was not mentally with us. It took him at least an hour to bring my newly altered check and for got to bring the coffee we ordered. We talk the manager into covering the whole bill, but he didn't want to. I'm cool on the cheesecake factory. The food is bland. They specialize in cheesecake, that's all I should get from them, if that. its not worth the time, money, and energy to go here."
Evelyn G.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,22,7,3.0,12/22/2011,I love their food and yummy cheesecakes but hate the long lines they always have. Tonight I had the pork chop and mashed potatoes which was really good! It's also way too dark in there and Loud ass music!! And my waitress was really annoying!!!!! Other than that it was good. But have to be there early or expect a long wait.
Seth L.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,9,,5.0,5/27/2012,I've never had a bad meal at Cheese Cake Factory. I just tried the new cheesecake flavor Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake and it's amazing! You have to try it.
Emily K.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",14,20,3,2.0,8/14/2013,"This place is huge. Too bad everything takes forever. My server was friendly, so I gave the rating an extra star. I'm pregnant and was starving, but my bread never came. I asked another server for some bread, and she walked around and never brought me bread. Why did she lie to me?! And I think the quality of food here is overrated and dishes are overpriced. So many better places to eat. Came here out of convenience. My mistake!"
Abe G.,"Manhattan, NY",438,93,7,4.0,7/23/2011,"I have been to cheesecake factories all over the country, and this one continues to be my favorite. Portions are enormous, prices are right, and sitting out on the terrace with a view of the grove and maybe catching a celebrity is a treat for the out-of-towners and locals alike. The cuisine isn't breathtaking by any means, but it really does have a certain homey feel to it that is absent in many other restaurants.  It is also the most aesthetically pleasing Cheesecake Factory that I have been to, with its grand staircase and dual levels.  Highly recommend for a safe, and reasonably priced meal in LA!"
Kaytie C.,"Burbank, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/13/2012,"let me tell you a story of our wonderful visit at the cheesecake factory. We waited for over an hour. when we finally got seated our server took his sweet time serving us and we were in a rush. the worst part about all this was that MY COUSIN ALMOST DIED! my cousin ordered some KIDS PASTA,and it turns out that there was a SHARD OF METAL IN HER PASTA! and our bread was cold. my aunt was, lets just say extremely upset about this. if my cousin swallowed the metal that would have been terrible. point is if you don't like SHARDS OF METAL in your KIDS PASTA or cold bread DON'T EAT HERE!"
Chow-time W.,"South Bay, CA",0,175,1,4.0,10/14/2009,"Was here after a movie at Pacific theatre at a pretty late hour so didn't really order an entree, just had a soup and a small dish. Never really was a big fan of cheesecake factory except for their cheesecake.  Portion is huge as usual, my friends had to packed theirs to go for a 2 or even 3 meal.  This location has some cute waitress and host.  Fast service, staffs are friendly, food are decent. Remember to have your parking ticket validate before you go."
Christina L.,"Hollywood, CA",13,113,155,2.0,11/18/2009,"So, I used to like Cheesecake factory, but lately I feel like it's just overrated.  Menu: It may be pretty diverse, but nothing on the menu (except Crab cake app) has really ever amazed me. I actually usually find that the portions are too large and I end up eating too much and leave with a stomach ache. Wait: The wait is waaaaaay too long.  I can understand having to wait, but what i don't get is when a two-hour wait turns into a 4 hour wait.  Our table was accidentally given away and instead of being honest with us, the host kept telling us 10 more min. over and over again.  When we finally got sat, they explained that there was a mix up. They should've told us as soon as they figured out the mix up instead of making us wait for two more hours.  Since it was a friend's birthday, we were doing our best to not be frustrated.   I would never willingly come here, but I would come if everyone else i was with would come."
Patrick R.,"Stratford, CT",169,551,2103,3.0,2/7/2009,"When it comes to the Cheesecake Factory then I must confess I am partial. I care less about this place; it's to loud, to dark and  everything I ordered of the menu has been a disappointment so far. Today we went and I decided to order the very thing this place is really known of; Cheesecake! I had a White Chocolat Raspberry Latte, which was pretty tasty and a Low Carb Cheesecake with fresh strawberries. I love the Cheesecake, that's one thing for sure. The service was great, we had a pretty cool waiter, but TCCF is not a place I prefer to go when it comes to food."
Leslie R.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",94,16,16,4.0,12/19/2011,"Not feelin' the 4-hr wait though... Great food (chicken bellagio), but the wait was ridiculous... fan of the food, not the wait."
Ashley B.,"South Gate, CA",139,169,13,4.0,12/26/2010,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory numerous times, the architecture of it always throws me off, with the one way escalator to go up and then the stairs to go down, but they do have elevators for those who need it. It's a fairly small Cheesecake Factory compared to other locations, but they do have outdoor seating on the balcony. The wait at this Cheesecake factory is ridiculous! Since it's at the Grove, which means that is ridiculously popular, so lots of people eat here, I've only experienced such a long wait at the Cheesecake Factory in Boston. The wait staff is courteous and always willing to help and whenever they go on break they make sure to tell you who is going to be your server."
Dia P.,"Windsor Hills, CA",33,40,27,4.0,11/4/2009,"hummmm......... What can i say about the cheesecake Factory at the Grove????? hummm..... i can definitely say that it is Crowed when u decide to go at night, really crowed on the weekends, but that is all The bad things i have to say about it. O yea,also their lobby should be bigger, it's chaos trying to get in their on a Saturday night. but other than that, that's it. i love the Cheesecake factory, excellent food and great meals and prices. i recommend for everybody to try. I'm making myself hungry, just thinking about it. haha. but i had my 16th bday their and it was really nice, i had the balcony like all to myself. Also because it was during Christmas time and the grove dishes out fake snowflakes and it's very winter.  :)"
Marian K.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,85,37,5.0,3/25/2011,"AMAZING. It's all extremely saucy and worth the money you pay. The portions are really generous.  I got a cream pasta with chicken (I forget the name...) and it was to die for! The chicken was so juicy.... and there was so much. And the pasta actually tasted like cream pasta and not just some sauce with the overwhelming taste of noodles like other places. I'd definitely come here again, when I have the money :P And the cakes are so... concentrated! I had the Godiva one....I felt like there was atleast 2 chocolate bars in each tiny bite. It was a bit too much for me. But their Tiramisu cake was good. :) Definitely, definitely, recommend. I went with small parties both times so I was seated almost instantly. Ahhh, so good :)"
J M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1016,382,346,3.0,10/20/2010,"Although you have the word Cheesecake right in your name....I never get a slice! Not because I don't want one..but because I am just too dang full whenever I leave your place. The pros:  ** I love their jumbalaya.  I know its not authentic..and its the ""white"" version of the dish but its good none the less and I eat it up to the very last drop. ** I love their brown/wheat bread that they give out to every table.  Who wants that hard crusty white bread when you have that wonderful soft buttery tasting wheat bread. **The service is usually pretty good here.. I have never had a complaint about the staff.  The cons: **The wait time is ridiculous.  If you go on a weekend..prepare to wait more than 1 hour.  If you have a huge group..prepare to wait more than 2 hours. I dont know why they don't do reservations....ugh (Thats why I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars) **Do they really need over 1000 items on the menu!  I swear..sometimes when Im reading the menu...its like im studying for a test.  When it comes time to order..I usually forget what I want and have to flip through 30 pages of ads to find the dish I wanted. All in all...CF is a good place to have a casual lunch/dinner and some drinks!"
Sara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,1,2.0,2/21/2012,"I've probably visited at least 10 Cheesecake Factories across the US. This is  my least favorite. I love the location because I love the Grove but the restaurant is ALWAYS crowded. The people that give you the buzzer seem to be overwhelmed and unorganized. The food is food (nothing exceptional but not bad either). I would recommend sitting in the patio if you go there because it is incredibly loud and dark inside! The waiters vary from awesome to meh. If you are hungry and at the Grove, you will probably end up eating here (hopefully your experience will be better than mine!:))"
Richard C.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,172,8,4.0,10/20/2011,"Took the family here to celebrate my sister's birthday earlier this year. Since it's at the Grove, plan to arrive early because the wait can be anywhere from 1-2 hours. We normally put our name on the list and walk around since there's so many shops and the Farmer's Market you can browse through. The food and service has always been great for us. It's a little hectic with the crowd but if you get a table out on the terrace overlooking the hustle and bustle down below, it's great on a warm night. I've always loved the sun-dried tomato and chicken alfredo or the salmon salad with asparagus and a tangy vinaigrette. Can't forget the cheesecake! They validate parking also."
Sabrina L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,40,2,4.0,6/9/2010,"Great food and service! They take reservations only during the week, which I find interesting and possibly helpful. I hosted a friend's birthday party there, and it was really great how quickly they took all of our orders and brought our food.  The one downside (or upside, depending on how you look at it) is the gigantic menu. Indecisives beware!"
Jamie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,241,,5.0,9/6/2011,"I really like cheesecake factory. It will never get old in my books. I always enjoy coming here and catching up with friends and eating till my hearts content. The free bread is always good. Everything you order here always is good. It is a chain restaurant so it will always be good. Red velvet cheesecake is of course amazing, but needs to be shared with MANY people. The Grove one I really like personally because it is an upstairs dining area and the atmosphere is super cozy."
Surge V.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,11,2,3.0,4/3/2012,"Not big fan of cheesecake factory. Food was bland. I got the Navajo and it was flavorless the only thing I liked was the hummus for the appetizer which I sure is from a jar. Cheesecake factory is good for their dessert like their names says. Service was good but it's too loud in the room to even hear myself. Don't get fooled buy their advertisement! I prefer going to a  privately owned restaurant to pay these prices then go to a ""fancy"" chain restaurant."
David E.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,200,56,3.0,10/6/2009,Food great. Menu diverse. Lil pricey. Easy for a casual dinner to turn into drinks and fun. Awesome and a half desserts. ... I ranked it lower because it's too crowded and the wait is stupid-like-stupid.
