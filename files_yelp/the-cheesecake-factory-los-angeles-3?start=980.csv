Rachael S.,"VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",97,100,45,4.0,8/29/2011,"Its the grove, so of course theres going to be a huge wait to get seated, but, 30 mins isn't that bad. I really do love this place and the menu because most dishes are very tastey, dressy and smothered in fancy stuff for around $10-17 You can actually get a really REALLY  good burger here, with fries for only $10! All the sandwiches and burgers are $10 and come with fries. Theres something for everyone. The cheesecake is obviously lovely soft creamy and delishous. Its all very well priced for an excellent meal and wonderfully lively, busy, fun place especially for a sat night :)"

Tawny A.,"Newport, RI",210,641,231,4.0,5/1/2009,"Cheesecake Factory is simply a standard all over the nation. Everyone likes it, they always have something on the menu that sounds good and they pump people out pretty damn fast, since they always draw a crowd. I really prefer to eat something more one of kind, since i live in such a food mecca....but sometimes the only thing i can think of is Pasta Da Vinci.  Pasta Da Vinci.  Pasta Da Vinci.  Pasta Da Vinci.  Pasta Da Vinci.  Pasta Da Vinci.  be still my heart."
Tajira M.,"Washington, DC",486,286,997,4.0,7/13/2008,"Went here yesterday with the bf for lunch.   Normally, I really like their food, but I made the mistake of trying something I hadn't had before.   I usually stick to the hot dishes, but I decided to try one of their sandwiches, since it was lunch time.  I ordered the Navajo, which is a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado, two kinds of mayo, lettuce, tomato, and red onion on a flatbread.  Served with fries.  I thought it sounded appealing, but it was really bland.  While I would normally shudder at the thought of ketchup on grilled chicken, it was the only way I could get some flavor on there. 3.5 stars."
rosy d.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,1.0,10/28/2012,"Unfortunately there is a scam going on here. I alerted the folks in the reception area as well as the security folks at The Grove, but both gave me the ""I'm sorry this happened to you ma'am"" and didn't really take the information seriously.   I had dinner with my family at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove on 26-Oct-12 and a young lady sitting by herself in the next table came over and asked if we had a iphone charger, then she said that she was waiting for her friend but she was preoccupied because she had ran out of battery on her phone.   My husband (I know, I know, he has a good heart) brought out his phone and offered to dial her friends number for her, but the lady insisted that what she needed was to send an email.  At this point, I got the feeling that something was off, and told the lady that she could go to the receptionist area and get help there, and before I knew it, my husband offered his phone to her.  She held it for what seemed like a couple of minutes, then all of a sudden two young men approached her, said that they were part of the Cheesecake Factory staff and they understood she was looking for her friend and asked her if there was anything they can do about it.  This was weird because they were clearly wearing street clothes and I noticed one of the men had a device (the device was larger than a cell phone) and he was facing that towards my husband.  The men left and quickly after that the lady grabbed her phone and suddenly left, and of course she did not order anything.  This all seemed weird and my husband immediately turned off his phone. I then went to the reception desk and asked to see a manager, waited for 10 minutes and no one came.  I was getting impatient and explained what happened to the receptionist, gave her a description of the three people and what they were wearing.  She was trying to get new guests seated and talk to me at the same time and at one point, she asked me to wait longer.  Another 5-10 minutes went by and as I was waiting, one of the young men came up the escalator, ducked as he was going thru the reception area and I immediately alerted her that one of the young men was still here and that he had just passed by.  I was sure that was him, as he was wearing the same clothes and hair style.  Unfortunately she said that she had to get one of her male co-workers to further look into this. I understand the reason the reception desk worker hesitated, but having me wait for a total of 20 minutes and not being able to alert the manager and report this incident immediately was frustrating to me.  I know this happened to us because we were not cautious enough, and at the same time I don't want this happening to anyone else.  So please be aware that there are three people going around targeting naive guests at this restaurant to try to gain access to their phones and all the information it carries."
Lucy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,1,4.0,3/1/2014,Great service and nice waitors and waitresses. Food is great and have many stores outside to go after. Have been coming here for years and i love it. Definitely recommend
Jayke W.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,16,,1.0,3/27/2011,"This place is just plain awful. Lousy, slow and incompetent servers (one girl who kept getting everything wrong). Then when the food arrived it was overcooked and not well-spiced. It was just not a pleasant experience considering the long wait for a two person table."
Vivian W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,4.0,12/22/2011,My husband and I enjoy having a wide variety of food there. Romantic environment for anniversary dinner. Ususally there is a long wait but you can look around and they buzz you.
Robert S.,"Santa Monica, CA",39,110,107,1.0,9/21/2013,"First off I like there food very much and I take my friend, colleagues, out-of-town guest here all the time and my family. Here's where the problem started I took my family there last night for my youngest son's birthday we placed our order and my wife and I received our food but my two kids did not get theirs we waited 7 minutes for pasta and a hamburger by that time our food was cool there was nowhere to be found so we got the man to come explain to the manager that I like eating my food with my family not to wait a long period time so I asked them to redo our our meal and have it served all at once the first manager had no problem with that but after a couple minutes seconds manager came in and said what's wrong with the food its all nice and hot my wife said to him we like to have all the food at once begin with an attitude my wife said we're leaving the second manager said there was nothing wrong with the food very upsetting that you cant get their act together and serve the food all at once"
solange s.,"Beverly Hills, CA",8,131,23,3.0,1/15/2014,"This was my first visit to this particular Cheesecake Factory in The Grove.  While the food was very good, the service could have used some improvement.  I was with two friends.  We asked our waitress what kind of table water they served.  She told us that it was tap water, not even filtered water, but tap water.  So we decided to get bottled water instead.  Perhaps they do that on purpose, so we'll have to buy our water.  My friend's menu was dirty and covered with food bits, so much so that she had to request a new one and make a trip to the bathroom to wash her hands.  Then, she noticed that her silverware was also not very clean, so that went back, too.  We all ordered from the light eating menu, two of us ordering hamburgers that required ketchup.  There was none on the table.  In fact, there were no condiments at all.  I'm not even sure there was salt and pepper.  We asked the waitress for it, and ten minutes later, she still had not come back with it.  So, we were obliged to ask a waiter for it.  At least,  he got back pretty quickly.  Like I said, the food was good, so no complaints there, I just think that I'd like to eat somewhere clean that knows how to place condiments on the table and that cares enough about their customers to not serve the recycled sewer water that comes from the city taps.  The one in Beverly Hills is much, much better, and the unique restaurants at the Farmers' Market a lot more interesting.  The best part of eating here was spending time with my friends.   I give those ladies five stars."
Leila T.,"Venice, CA",134,191,3,2.0,5/21/2008,"Something happened to me last night, at this particular branch of The Cheesecake Factory, that I thought was un-possible.  I received a bowl of macaroni and cheese that was (...wait for it...) too cheesy.  It was actually a disgusting oily blob of melted cheese.   Now, I like me some cheese.  In fact I consider cheese to be its own food group and it is generally at the base of my personal food pyramid (base is bigger, meaning more portions per day, even though one would think that the top of the food pyramid would be better, it is not, but I digress).  What I do not like is to see my cheese all melted into its component parts and to recognize that the delicious food item that I am consuming is heading straight into the arteries surrounding my heart.   Anyway, back to The Cheesecake Factory.  Their food just isn't really that good.  At some point in my life, when I didn't mind the idea of consuming an entire 1000 calorie slice of cheesecake, I enjoyed their desserts.  Sadly those days have passed.  The fact that their ""diet"" salads only promise to be less than 600 calories should really tip off anyone who wants to remain below 250 pounds that this is a dangerous place.   Also, no happy hour specials at all.  That's just plain bad business practices."
Sadie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,5.0,1/7/2015,"I eat at this location quite a bit but am writing this regarding my 12/27/14 visit with my mom. We were told it would take an hour and a half to two hours to be seated but received a text message about an hour and fifteen minutes later that our table was ready. Took us maybe seven minutes to get there and we were told to wait to be seated. After twenty minutes I complained asking why we were contacted that our table was ready and after hearing from the hostess we took too long to get back, etc. we were seated on the outside patio which was not very good for me and my cold especially given that night was so cold. We ordered the artichokes to start and when we received them they were dry and had no meat. I let the waiter (Jesse) know and he said he would get another one. This is when Patrick, the manager, came to our table and apologized for the artichoke and asked if everything else was okay since it appeared it had been visible to Jesse I wasn't happy from the beginning. Patrick sat down with us, I explained the wait for the table, he apologized, offered to move us inside and was so beyond pleasant that I got over the wait, cold, and artichoke. The artichoke was replaced, it was perfect and both Jessie and Patrick gave us the best attention and service the rest of the night. Patrick stopped by our table again and even offered me a scarf! We enjoyed a delicious dinner and dessert which is what I think is always a guarantee at the Cheesecake Factory and had a very good rest of the evening. When the check came, the artichoke was completely comped even though the replacement was perfect. My mom and I were so impressed by Patrick and his attitude, he's a true reflection of what a manager should be. And Jesse was an amazing waiter! Will definitely continue going back here."
Salim O.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,11,3,5.0,1/5/2012,"every chance I get to go to the ""factory"" (as I like to call it lol ) I usually get some different  kind of Pasta . But today I felt like broadenimg my horizen & taste what the Herb Salmon had to offer. Not only was it delicious , but what made this particular visit that much more enjoyable was that the food was served not to long after I ordered & the service was amazing. With service like that , one can't help but to tip generously. Before I finish I just wanted to add that I truly recommend the iced Mango smoothie to wash down some of that good old classic cheese cake . Until next time , as they say in france or any other french speaking nation , Bon apetite !!!"
M. J G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,11,,3.0,2/11/2012,"Overrated! Just the food.  Quick stop before a movie.The drinks are ok. The service is the original corporate service. Not the severs fault, they have to. Obvi try what they are known for desserts.oh yeah do not get the crab cakes."
Justin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,68,71,3.0,6/17/2011,"This was actually my first time at The Cheesecake Factory. Yeah, I suppose this review might be slightly biased, but sorry. When I went in, the place was bustling with activity. My group and I (approximately 10 people) waited about a little over 5 minutes in line just to get to the front desk. Once at the front desk, they told us we had a 30 minute wait or so to be seated together. It was 20 minutes. So that wasn't too bad.  The inside of the restaurant is actually very dark. Too dark for my liking. You pretty much can't see your food that well...And the place is pretty loud so if you're looking for a quiet dinner, forget it.  Our waiter wasn't too bad. He was a bit late at times and did forget my friend's order (he did make up for it with complimentary cheesecake or soup of the day) but he was okay. One thing I did NOT like about him was his continuous 'probing' if we wanted anything more. I mean it's his job to make sure to check up on us, but I believe it was a tad bit too much. :x Onto the good stuff. Their bread is really good. They have two types: sourdough and wheat. They continuously give you bread/butter in case your mouth gets lonely. :D Yay! We ordered fried calamari and quesadillas for appetizers. I have to say that their appetizers were WAY better than my actual entree. Their batter was really crispy and nice but the calamari inside was so soft (in a good way)! Dipping in the tartar sauce made it like 10x better. Their quesadillas were also super good. Very big and cheesy accompanied with guacamole (chunky just the way I like it ;D ), sour cream, and salsa. The food was just okay. Well, my dish was. I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken pasta, which was bland and I wasn't too fond of it. I took about half of it in a to-go box. The pasta was okay and the sauce tasted funny. My other friends ordered steaks, which were good from what they said. The fries that came with them (sweet potato and regular) were no-nos. Another friend of mine got something ""Thai chicken wrap"" or something like that. It was pretty good considering that over half of the dish lacked carbohydrates/protein. Other than that, I'd rate the food a 3.5 (only my dish though). Onto desserts. Most of my group did not get desserts because we were stuffed. I forgot to mention. The portions are HUGE. No joke. I guess that's one other thing that's good about this place. They also have a cr** load of cheesecake options. You can pretty much imagine a chocolate company/type and add cheesecake to it and they'll have it on their menu. Pretty cool. But then again, it's called ""The Cheesecake Factory"". :D Although my initial experience was not what I expected mostly because of my dish, I believe that going here a 2nd time would be most helpful."
Ahrmon R.,"Vallejo, CA",464,95,41,4.0,4/28/2011,"A great place to eat with family and friends I would highly recommend it due to the setting and atmosphere of the people. Outstanding service, very efficient."
Michelle B.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,28,13,4.0,1/3/2009,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factorys all across the country. Some things are the same, some different. Here's my review of this one (at the Grove). One thing, which astonishingly is the same at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to: Don't go here if you're in a hurry. In fact, if you have any time issues that day at all, don't go here. Go only if you have a good half day to kill and can laze around eating good food. And I'm so serious about that. I can't tell you how many times I raised my own blood pressure when I forgot that about the Cheesecake Factory. If you've waited less than a half hour at any Cheesecake Factory, you are doing amazingly well. Plan on an hour before you even get seated. I'm so serious. At the Grove, they also have the added hassle of not enough seating while you're waiting. So, even before you get to the main seating guy, there's a pre-seating guy outside. You leave your name with him/her, and wait. Then, you go inside, and wait some more. If you're lucky, after about half an hour, maybe you can grab a seat on the one bench they have there. Just about the time your skin is crawling and you are thinking: ""GOD, screw this! The food isn't THAT good..."" they'll call your name, or your buzzer will blink and vibrate, and up the long escalator you'll go. Where you'll be greeted by another seating person. (sigh) And wait. Sigh. Finally, finally, you get to your table. Do yourself a favor, immediately. Order an appetizer with your drink, as soon as the wait person gets there. I recommend the firecracker rolls. You will thank me for this later. You do this  because you have a long wait ahead of you until you see food, or possibly a server again. Plus, the menu is GIGANTIC. It's seriously like twelve pages long. The first two pages are drinks. A couple pages of appetizers. Then six pages of entrees. All of them are amazing. Trust me, I've had a lot of stuff on their menu. This is why you deal with the excruciating, wanna slit your wrists wait. THE FOOD. The food is mind-blowingly astonishingly incredibly awesome. In fact, whenever anyone has said, ""Hey, let's go to the Cheesecake Factory!"" there has never been a time I said No. One of my most frequent choices is the popcorn chicken, served with yummy mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. But there is everything from Thai choices to pizza to pasta to great salads. Incredible food. And I always always always end up taking it home because there is so much of it. Well, that and the fact that you most often want to save room for dessert. Because after all, it is the CHEESECAKE Factory. And when I say they have cheesecake, sweet Lordy, do they have cheesecakes. Pumpkin and chocolate and strawberry and hazelnut and peanut butter whatever flavor you crave. Cheesecakes for the holidays. Cheesecakes that you only dream of. Every cheesecake you can imagine. They are all fantastic. I have actually gone in there a couple times and NOT ordered any cheesecake, and endured the withering glances from the waiters. Because really, you HAVE to have the cheesecake here. There is really no other restaurant that I would endure such a nail-bitingly long wait for, but the Cheesecake Factory redeems itself every single time with their food."
Cyn K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,82,,3.0,7/9/2013,You won't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory.  Their menu is very extensive and you will probably be happy with anything you choose.  And of course their cheesecakes are to die for.  I LOVE their lemonade too!!
Patricia M.,"Kirkland, WA",17,199,86,4.0,5/17/2011,"It's a Cheesecake Factory! When you go here you know what you are gonna get.....there food is always consistent. We really try to avoid chain restaurants but this one is the only one we really enjoy going to. Everything on their menu is delicious. Here are some of our favorites; Caramel Chicken, Cuban sandwich, Renee's Special, Fried Macaroni and Cheese, Thai Chicken Pasta, Red Velvet Cheesecake, Fresh Banana Cream Cheesecake, Chocolate Coconut Cream Cheesecake, Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake, Wild Blueberry and White Chocolate Cheesecake, and our absolute favorite THE WHITE CHOCOLATE CARMEL MACADAMIA NUT CHEESECAKE! Omfg......... This particular location.....we came here for dinner of Mother's Day.....it was insanely crowded.....The wait time was 2  1/2 hours......we waited it out....then were seated on the patio. It was slightly chilly outside but they did have the heater's on. The patio was packed as was the restaurant so it was pretty loud. The service was a little spotty.....like I said it was a busy night.....But overall we had a wonderful dinner."
Ed C.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,256,36,2.0,2/28/2007,"How the AMERICAN IDOL judges might critique The Cheesecake Factory... RANDY: Yo, dawg. I wanted the Jambolaya to be hot, but yo... keepin' it real... it wasn't off da hook or nothin'. I mean, when I was workin' with Mariah I had some of her Jambolaya and that was da bomb... But this one... the paprika was all over the place... there just wasn't consistency... and I had to add Tabasco... it was just a'ight for me... Paula? PAULA: I think I have to agree with Randy... I think the Jambolaya looked very pretty... It was a good-looking plate of rice and chicken and shrimp... and it had such a great aura about it... and it had such a fantastic attitude... SIMON (rolling his eyes): Paula, did you like it? PAULA (shooting him a look):  I... don't... like.... you... (RANDY ""woofs"") SIMON: That's a ""no.""  (PAULA hits his arm)  SIMON: Listen Cheesecake Factory... The Jambolaya was, like, when you go to a second rate all-you-can-eat-buffet or w'o'evah... Some of these other restaurants have set the bar... Maggiano's...  Wood Ranch Barbeque.... They've upped their game... They've set the bar... but you, Cheesecake Factory... you might as well pack your bags, because we're looking for that ""X"" factor and with you, I don't see it... and all those ads in the menu... I mean, is this a restaurant because if I'm paying for a meal at these prices, I don't expect to be bombarded by ads for Palm Trios or w'o'evah... RYAN: But you chose to come to this restaurant... SIMON: Ryan, why don't you just go kiss a boy or w'o'evah... RYAN: Why don't I just kiss you?... PAULA: I need a drink... which I won't drink... because I don't drink... but what the hell?...
