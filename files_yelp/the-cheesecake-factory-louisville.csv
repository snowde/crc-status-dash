Jason C.,"Floyds Knobs, IN",0,158,62,4.0,10/20/2017,Very good chain restaurant.  Menu variety. Good service. Very good food. I had the jambalaya Cajun pasta with chicken. Wife had 3 taco with seared tuna. I'll add the pics. Prices seem a little high but probably comparable to other restaurants of this kind. But the portions are huge. I will have lunch leftover today. Also the Oreo cheesecake is 5 star. We come here about every three months.  Satisfied every time.  Updating review. Ate here last night. One of our favorite chain restaurants. Food and service were very good. See pics. Only thing about chain restaurants is you get some loud people in sometime who think they are at home    Also wine per glass is as much as some of the fancy restaurants. Otherwise this place is always an option for us!
Morgan E.,"Louisville, KY",86,149,61,3.0,11/21/2017,"I've been to the Cheesecake Factory on many different occasions and each time I'm reminded why I rarely go there.  What fun is it to wait nearly an hour to eat over-priced, mediocre food with inconsistent service?  I don't blame the cooks at the Cheesecake Factory.  I think when you have a menu with over a hundred items on it - it's hard to make dishes stand out.  So everything I've ever had on the menu has just been...okay.  I've never ordered anything a second time if that says anything.   At my most recent trip I had the Jamaican chicken and shrimp.  It was fine - but it was barely warm when it came to the table and the rice was hard.  However, I liked the spice on the dish and the marinated pineapple was a nice touch.  Our server - well, she just couldn't be bothered.  It took several minutes for her to approach the table and another ten minutes to get our waters.  She wasn't friendly or engaging.  She didn't smile.  She wasn't necessarily rude, but not exactly a good representative of the company.   Alright, let's talk what is good and the only reason this place gets three stars - and it's the cheesecake.  They have a huge variety of cheesecake ranging from plain Jane, strawberry, vanilla, Oreo, red velvet cake, snickers, Godiva chocolate, and the list goes on and on.  I used to be a huge fan of the holiday cheesecake - pumpkin pecan cheesecake.  However, the last two times I've ordered it - it tasted of bitter, old pecans.  The pecans that you let go rancid and then they had a nasty aftertaste.  Yeah, those.  But I've had red velvet, carrot cake, vanilla bean, Godiva, and raspberry lemon with all good results.   Bottom line - with so many wonderfully amazing restaurants in Louisville, the Cheesecake Factory just can't hang.  I suggest skipping the food because it's simply not worth it.  They have a counter where you can order cheesecake slices to go.  That's your best bet."
Joshua D.,"Louisville, KY",3,16,4,5.0,11/25/2017,"Very nice place to eat and celebrate your birthday, very nice location and dinner was delicious, everyone was friendly and love the mango lime cheesecake, thanks you all."
Vien L.,"Saint Matthews, KY",44,143,328,1.0,4/30/2017,"I'm not too much of a fan of big chain restaurants. I feel they've let me down far too many times at this point. The first was Wolfgang Puck, then TGI Friday's, and now ol' Cheesecake Factory. I hate writing bad reviews. I like having good food.  We started with appetizers and were considering how expensive everything is. Should be good right? For what I'm paying for? Quality and tasty food? It let me down. I had a great time here because I came with fantastic company. But the grub was not up to standard. I can make a much better meal from pantry items on the fly. We started with stuffed mushrooms, and the firecracker salmon. The stuffed mushrooms were decent. No real complaint there I suppose. A bit greasy but tasty nonetheless. Now the firecracker salmon was another story. I have to show you and let you decide. Considering what we expected versus what we received... it was a strong fail. Just by the looks of it. Greasy, disproportional portions and oh so sloppy. I thought our waitress just didn't carry it over straight, so the dish just slid to one side. Then there was the chicken pasta da Vinci. It was just plain pasta noodles with some mushrooms and some chicken. Now this is where I swear I can do better with pantry items. One box of pasta cooked al dente. One can of campbells cream of mushroom and a half can of water. Some fresh whole mushrooms sliced up and sautéed in butter and a bit of salt... And some chicken. Any chicken. Even canned chunk chicken drained and rinsed. Cook it up and serve it. It would be more flavorful than this pasta dish at Cheesecake Factory, and less greasy. It just wasn't very flavorful. And the amount of chicken and mushrooms in my dish was pitiful. For the price, it could've had a garden salad or something thrown in. I feel like I ate unhealthy food, and yet it wasn't rewarding... like a dirty food truck taco would've been a better way to go than this faux fancy place.  There are so many restaurateurs in Louisville at a similar price point. I just don't see the point in spending so much and getting so little in return. Plus, I didn't feel a whole lot of love from our waitress. The cheesecake was good though. One star for that! I won't be back though. I want a good pasta place in Louisville... one that makes the pasta in house. If I was by myself, I might've sent a dish back."
Michelle W.,"Louisville, KY",31,72,136,3.0,9/1/2017,"I've been to this cheesecake factory twice, the first time the food was not impressive at all but the cheesecake was delicious, and the second time the food was amazing and I didn't end up getting dessert. It is the only location I've ever been, but I'm really not crazy about going to such a lovely restaurant in the mall... just my personal preference. I sort of figure if I'm paying those types of prices I would rather have the experience that goes with it, which is hard to do in a mall parking lot. The inside really is quite pretty and since they have such an interesting variety of foods on their menu of definitely be willing to try it again, especially when I'm in the mood for tasty cheesecake."
Kaitlyn C.,"Lyndon, Louisville, KY",20,50,33,2.0,8/15/2017,This location is okay... it's almost funny how they are always out of what we want to order. EVEN ON A TUESDAY NIGHT. The service is great but the food is just meh. We ordered chunky avocado with a 1/4 teaspoon of tuna (TUNA tar tar) for $8 and mushy crab balls for $8 (CRISPY crab bites). The portions and names of the food are hilariously inaccurate. The drinks are great and so is the cheesecake!
Matt T.,"Mt Washington, KY",0,5,,3.0,12/9/2017,Very slow service. There was 4 of us for a simple birthday dinner and we we there over 2 hours. In addition the food did not come out together.  My son's food had to be remade because another server took his to another table. Plus I find it strange that I have to explain how to make an Irish coffee. Really?? Probably won't return unless I'm forced to. That much money I can find better choices. Oh yeah! They were out of her bed chicken so we had to find a substitute which was sub-par.
Tina F.,"Mount Washington, KY",0,6,2,3.0,12/16/2017,"Ordered for two using Grubhub since I was recovering from surgery and could not get out and about.  Ordered the Teriyaki chicken and the Shepherds Pie and two cheesecakes.  The food was lukewarm and the cheesecakes were also warm.  The teriyaki chicken was not what I expected, one large piece of skin on chicken and rice, it was very very dry.  The Shepherds Pie was ordered by my mother. She reviewed it very poorly.  Due to the taste she mainly ate the potatoes.  The cheesecakes were ok.  Later in the evening we both had stomach issues.  Needless to say we will not be doing delivery again."
Angela W.,"Taylorsville, KY",24,10,1,4.0,11/26/2017,My husband and I went for Brunch and the food was wonderful as always. Service was great. We did feel however the drinks from the bar are a little expensive for what you get.
Elise Dixie Jane M.,"Louisville, KY",206,194,755,5.0,6/3/2017,"Let me start by saying this is alongside Bonefish Grill as the only restaurants that aren't corporate I will visit!!!! Everything on their menu makes me drool and has me day dreaming about their food... daily! My personal favorites for appetizers are the avocado egg rolls, FRIED MAC & CHEESE BALLS, buffalo blasts, corn cakes, crab won tons, fried zucchini, sauteed mushrooms, or the crab cakes... you really can't go wrong!!!"
Mark V.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,204,8,2.0,9/5/2017,Not a good experience. Harassed by flies at my table and a dirty water glass. The Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai was not good at all. The saving grace was my Celebration Cheesecake and the waiter. I was not really happy with third place and was pretty shocked at the lack of cleanliness of my table and the before mention items.
Jason H.,"New Albany, IN",65,60,33,3.0,3/14/2017,"Prepare to spend a long time here - not necessarily because service is slow, but their expansive menu takes time to read and digest. My main issue is with so many options how do you choose? In addition, they tend to be hit or miss. The American options are really good, but the Chinese and Mexican options are sub par. My most recent visit was with a large group of about 15. I ordered the Steak Diane and it was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, the sauce added a ton of flavor and the mashed potatoes were really good. In addition, I was able to sample a number of appetizers. The crab dip was not very good. It had a very fishy taste and was pretty bland tasting. No one liked it. The spinach dip had an overwhelmingly taste of spinach, which some people like. I was not a fan. The chicken blast were awesome. Probably the highlight of our lunch. Basically, they take buffalo chicken dip and then they fry it. Served with a delicious buffalo sauce and ranch. Lastly, we had the loaded/stuffed tots. Tater tots stuffed with a loaded baked potato. Also very good (especially with the spicy mayo). Everyone's entree looked good. I can't wait to go back and try the mac and cheese burger. The fish and shrimp tacos both received praise and I would like to try these as well. As noted above, stay away from the burritos and the orange chicken dishes. The main draw is of course dessert. I was able to sample a variety of cheesecake and they were all phenomenal. I don't remember the names, but the salted caramel was good as was the lemon raspberry. Our group also had a Reese's, some kind of chocolate turtle, and a chocolate blonde. One server cared for our group of 15 and she did a great job balancing the group with her other tables. Our drinks were refreshed at the halfway point nearly every time. Empty dishes were promptly removed to make space for the next items All in all, this place is great for dessert, but just OK for lunch and dinner. Prices are a little high for what you get. I would recommend for a date night or some kind of occasion."
Tom L.,"Indianapolis, IN",44,40,15,3.0,2/10/2017,"I suppose it's just not my thing. The decor looks like it was done by a diva, golden girl who was off her meds. I had the Baja tacos which were good yet heavy and served with beans that had been left out for a while. My fiancé had the shrimp scampi and it was just horrible. The whole garlic clove she had to navigate around were burnt and ruined the flavor. The menu was also seven pages long and in no obvious order. All in all I don't understand this place so I'll give it a neutral rating."
Adrienne B.,"Louisville, KY",205,9,,2.0,10/30/2017,"I walked into the Cheesecake Factory excited about the happy hour specials I heard about.  I have eaten there before and thought it was good. I walked in around 4:25pm and sat at the bar.  The bar was unattended but I decided to sit because maybe the bartender was just away for a second.  I sat there for around 5 mins.  At least two restaurant workers walked behind the bar, made their drinks and never acknowledged me.  I sat for another 2-3 mins and no one came out or acknowledged me.  I decided to leave and go to another restaurant.  In the future, there should be someone working at the bar especially during the happy hour time frame that has been marketed to us."
Breonna L.,"Tampa, FL",280,228,155,3.0,1/3/2017,"Ehhhh, I've been to a lot of Cheesecake factories and while this one isn't terrible, its not amazing either. It's literally okay... average... basic. Since I'm swearing off junk food for an entire month, I decided my last fatty meal should be cheesecake factory. So we arrive, parking is ridiculous as St Matthews tends to be during the holidays (no stars knocked off for this). There was a 40 minute wait at cheesecake factory which is normal (again, no stars knocked off for this). They handed us one of those devices that vibrate when your table is ready (I don't know the name!) and we sat down. About 35 minutes later, we hear ""table of Lewis, party of 4"" so we go up there.  We get up there and they say ""ohh.... it must of been 2 parties of Lewis for 4 because someone already came up here. We gave your table to the wrong party""   First of all, whats the point of those vibrating devices if they aren't being used and secondly, the devices have numbers on them. Couldn't of you just checked their number?! Anyway, my mom makes a big fuss so they sit up promptly.  So once we are seated, I ordered the mac n cheese burger and carrot cake. My burger was okay. Honestly, for it to be my last junk food meal of the year... it kinda sucked lol. The burger was so flavorless. I order burgers from cheesecake factory all the time (in other locations) and they always taste great. This burger was missing some seasoning. I feel like anything I eat at this specific cheesecake factory, its never consistent.  Would I come back? Probably... its not horrible. Would I be the one to pick this place out when there are so many better places nearby? Probably No."
Elizabeth C.,"Waddy, KY",20,260,585,4.0,8/26/2016,"Any fan of The Big Bang Theory knows The Cheesecake Factory features prominently in the series... And, things like the enormous size of the establishment's menu are sometimes discussed.  Having never been to one before, when we found one on our recent trip to Kentucky, we just HAD TO go! It was after noon on a Saturday and the place was HOPPING.  We had a rather large party, so it was a bit of a wait for a table, but, to be honest, they told us 15 minutes, and it didn't take more than 5.  This allowed us ample time to drool over their Cheesecake display... which is dangerously extensive!  In addition, and I'm not sure if all Cheesecake Factories look alike, but, the decor in this one was an entertainment in itself.  It seriously looked like it belonged in Vegas! Once seated, they were quick to bring us our drink orders and VERY understanding after we sent them away twice so we could read through the book, and I do mean BOOK, that is their menu.  The jokes are true folks... their menu is crazy.  You can pretty much find anything you might be craving... This too, was my first experience with ordering beverages in Kentucky, which was a 2 fold learning experience...   #1 - They do eveything big here and drinks are no exception.  I'm used to having to practically beg for a tiny glass of water everywhere I go in California, but here... they mean business.  You want water?  You get a GIANT glass!   #2 - Sweet Tea versus Unsweet Tea.  If you order Iced Tea, there's a slight assumption you mean Sweet Tea... If you want what I call Iced Tea... you have to order Unsweet Tea.  Not a big deal, just took my brain a little bit of getting used to.  Also, I had a sip of some sweet tea and damn, do they mean it!  So, if you don't want to drink tea flavored sugar water, you might want to pass!  And, since they make Tea sweet, I don't think they get that people might want to sweeten it themselves because there never seemed to be packets of sugar or sweetener anywhere we went... I never ordered coffee, but maybe they bring you some then? Ok, I digress.  We all ordered something different and I will say, despite service being friendly, and them refilling our ginormous drinks promptly whenever we drank 1/2 the glass, no matter what we ordered, the food took FOREVER.  We were later told that Well Done burgers take a minimum of 20 minutes to cook.  Odd.. but... ok...  Since a number of us ordered burgers, we were the hold up?  Also, true to form, everyone at the table was served, except for my husband, despite him ordering what was arguably the simplest thing at the table... We're not sure why, but this happens to him... a lot!  And, once his food DID arrive they brought it out in stages... which consequently meant he got an extra side dish...  I guess that made up for him having to watch us all eat for 5 minutes? I ordered a Mac & Cheese Burger because I'd had one at a posh joint in Denver and was pretty disappointed.  I was curious if a chain like The Cheesecake Factory could improve on it, and do it cheaper... and boy, did they!  It was arguably the cheesiest burger I've ever had.  I had subbed in a side of Sweet Potato Fries and those were excellent as well.  A friend of ours at the table had never had Sweet Potato fries and I guess the ones at Cheesecake Factory made him a believer, because he's ordering them everywhere now! Everyone seemed to enjoy their choices and we were all stuffed... which was kind of a bummer... I wanted Cheesecake!  Then again... how could you ever choose what kind to try?!?"
Bret H.,"Louisville, KY",0,13,,4.0,11/13/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is usually hit or miss for me and Saturday night was a hit!  I feel they have a really big menu which allows them to do a lot of things okay but nothing great but not this trip.  Me started with the fried macaroni and cheese and it was perfect.  The macaroni and cheese was cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce was light and a nice compliment.  The wife had Parmesan herb chicken and received a huge portion...really too much to eat.  I had the carne Assad's medallions which were wonderfully flavored with a tasty corn side dish.  It came with cilantro rice which tasted like it had been sitting for some time which was a bummer.  We both ordered cheesecake to go (celebration and Godiva) which made for good breakfast yesterday.   Our server, whose name I can't remember, was awesome.  He had several tables but was still attentive and took care of our needs."
Jeff K.,"Louisville, KY",15,15,3,5.0,10/22/2017,This is a very nice place. They have very big portions bigger than I expected. So had To box up half the meal so I could save room for dessert lol  Over all a very good night out for a birthday dinner
Christopher S.,"Louisville, KY",202,565,1397,3.0,8/21/2016,"I really enjoy this place but sometimes I'm frightened of it, to be honest. Basically, this place is 'okay' and in Louisville you need to put a good foot forward with so many independent places.   First, it's super large and loud.  It's usually hard to hear the person you're eating with.  I don't get to eat with other human beings often so I want to also have a conversation with them.  The interior design is garish and distracting.   Their food is okay - it's good but not, ""OMG"" or any conjugation of amazing.  It's what you expect and since it's uniform from sea to shining see I'm pretty sure it comes out of a freezer.   Also, their cheesecake selection is why we come here.  It's a lot of fun.  There are too many choices which is never a bad thing at dessert.  I like the cheesecakes pared with fruit but I've never had a bad one.  I'll keep coming back because loads of people like it but I don't know that I'd pick this on my own."
Cindy H.,"Louisville, KY",76,26,28,4.0,8/3/2017,"Delicious food, good service. Restaurant was mostly clean except for the floor. Looks like it hadn't been swept or mopped in days. The food was delicious though."
Sherri S.,"Charlestown, IN",27,90,261,3.0,6/7/2017,"Only been in just to get cheese cakes for certain occasions, but this time we decided to have dinner here.  Myself and my 2 college kids were out shopping and deiced we finally try them other then take out desserts.  The place is very posh for a Mall restaurant, the menu is GIGANTIC took us almost 20 plus minutes to read through it to decide what we like to eat. The server was nice but seemed annoyed we were taking long time to look over the menu.  Once we did ordered it took over 40 minutes for our meal to come out, it was really good. My daughter enjoyed the catfish, son had teriyaki chicken but thought had bit to much sauce, I had a Pit Beef Sandwich which was good but some the meat was kinda tough to chew but took home to the dog (he enjoyed it) We all got a slice of cheesecake to take home which all enjoyed later that night. I know they are a chain but sometimes less is more, their menu is almost to big to decide what to eat.  Will continue to come for take out cheesecakes but not sure we will come back for meals."
TeQuila C.,"Louisville, KY",60,20,,2.0,9/28/2017,I've only been here 3 times I have yet to see any reason to return. Tonight we were there to celebrate a birthday we waited 45 minutes to get our food. A family came in after us and were served before us. The food was ok service was ok. Besides the long wait the manager did adjust the bill however this will never be on my lists of places for dinner.
Molly H.,"Ona, WV",0,5,6,5.0,9/29/2017,Stopped by the CCF while in Louisville and my grandkids absolutely loved it!  The atmosphere is fun and the restaurant is beautiful!  The best food anywhere and who doesn't love cheesecake !!!
Maria J.,"Columbia, MO",12,84,12,5.0,4/29/2017,"I've been low carbing for about a month. Imagine my surprise that I was able to have a low carb meal AND cheesecake! YES, low carb cheesecake! Which was preceded by lemon & herb roasted chicken, broccoli & green beans. I'm sure I was out of my carb limit for a usual meal. But this was an awesome treat!!"
Kasen M.,"Brownsboro Zorn, Louisville, KY",172,105,2992,5.0,7/30/2016,"I took a group of kids for National Cheesecake Day on July 30. On cheesecake day, the Cheesecake Factory always offers half-price pieces of cheesecake. In order to get the half-price discount, you have to dine in. I always look at this as an opportunityto take a group of kids for a real life ""sit down"" restaurant experience.  The Cheesecake Factory is known to be pricey and I work for a non-profit agency. Each year when I take the kids, I make sure to go during a non-peak time. I know the waiters and waitresses work hard for those really big tips off the typical really big bills. Probably lots of folks take advantage of the more affordable cheesecake deal and do what we did. Every year the servers have always been so nice and accommodating. They told us the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes, but we got our table for 7 in about 10 minutes. Long enough for the kids to catch some Pokemon in the lobby.  We had an amazing waitress. She wasn't upset that we only ordered waters to drink. When we sat down I told her we were going to get a few appetizers and then enjoy some of the cheesecake. She seemed happy to serve us. We ordered two pizzas to share. Each pizza had 8 reasonably size slices. She also was quick to refill our drinks and the bread on the table.  She checked on us several times, never making us feel rushed, just being attended to. When the cheesecake came out the kids eyes grew large and their mouths nearly dropped to the table. They'd never seen pieces of cheesecake so big. Having some older kiddos with me, I asked if we could get five coffees. She was quick to bring them along with creamer. The kids, many of them having never been to a ""fancy restaurant"" before were thoroughly impressed with the real creamer. When the check came it was just under $60 for 2 pizzas and 7 slices of cheesecake. As most people do, I slid my credit card into the book and waited for her to take it away. It wasn't until after I had paid and was calculating the tip that I noticed she didn't charge us for coffee.  I'm not sure if she recognized that we were not the typical group of cheesecake factory consumers, but I thought that was really cool of her to not include that on the bill.  I super want to include her name in the review, but don't want to get her in trouble with her boss. So, I'll just say to the Cheesecake Factory: you have some really great people working for you. She was extremely patient, very kind, and truly made this group of kids first sit down fancy restaurant experience something they will remember for years to come. Plus -- the $20 you saved us on coffee can now be spent on other great experiences for my kids -- so thank you and Happy Cheesecake Day!"
Samantha T.,"Chicago, IL",30,14,18,3.0,1/14/2017,"Have been to this location a handful of times. The food is pretty reliably good, but the cheesecake is the definite draw. The Buffalo blasts and fried Mac n cheese apps are solid, albeit pricey for portions. Good entrees have included: Americana burger, four cheese pasta, chicken carbonara, Cajun chicken littles. The Renee's special was just ok. Good sandwich and soup, but salad is meh. Sandwich portion was tiny for a $13 meal.  The biggest con of TCF for me are the prices. A lot of their entrees and appetizers are really overpriced. Their Cheesecake sizes (depending on flavor) can be vastly different but they all cost $8 per slice.  Most recent visit, got the chicken littles dinner which was $15.50. Got a great portion of chicken, but didn't know until my check that subbing Mac n cheese as a side brought the entree to 18.75! Seriously? Splitting the app, getting this entree and a slice of cheesecake set me back $40 for just my check. For me, TCF is a once in awhile place, not a regular go-to, and that's almost entirely because they are overpriced."
Marlene M.,"Saint Matthews, KY",46,81,278,5.0,8/19/2016,This will be my third time coming to this restaurant and I can say I haven't had a bad experience.   The friendly kind greasing we received from the greater. Seated us and provided was a very welcoming feeling.  Our server Mr Casey (might of spelled name wrong) however today was his first day serving. He did an awesome job!! Provided us with nothing but good service. Checked on us while waiting on our food.  The food was very tasty. My baby enjoyed his salmon and mash potatoes. My salad was as good as it looked!! The cheese cake dessert that we took home did not make it home!!
Whitney B.,"Decatur, GA",59,18,12,4.0,7/31/2017,"Alison R. is the BEST! Attentive and friendly, and knowledgeable about the products. Give this gal a raise!"
Jackie L.,"Louisville, KY",14,50,29,3.0,1/7/2017,"The Cheese cake factories was not what I had expected. The food was not that great.  I wait for 40  minutes just to be serve warm food. However, my waiter was awesome!"
Olivia T.,"Covington, KY",4,11,3,2.0,1/16/2017,The cheesecake was great got it to go because we actually wanted to see what it looked like. Seriously though if the lights were any lower they would be off. But the fact that you can't see the food isn't too much of a problem because it just helps make it easier to forget.
Joni S.,"Louisville, KY",0,1,1,3.0,5/22/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is typically a go-to spot for families since it has such a large menu. This comes in handy when I have so many picky eaters in my family. 3 stars for service, cleanliness and usually decent food. However, the execution of food the last two visits have been subpar. Ordered the Cajun chicken littles.. nothing Cajun about them. It came with corn and mashed potatoes. Corn had the salt the chicken lacked... the potatoes were hardly mashed.. for the amount of $ spent I would expect such a simple dish to have at least 1 part of the meal to be edible."
Alicia B.,"Louisville, KY",66,64,93,5.0,6/4/2016,So there was a 30 minute wait which wasn't bad. Our waitress was so sweet and very a good waitress. We got our drinks and food. Our meal was delicious. After paying I accidentally left my debit card and our waitress was kind enough to turn in it which made the experience that much better. It's hard to find honest people in this world anymore. Will definitely be back!
Carrie M.,"Louisville, KY",0,11,38,4.0,6/19/2017,Menu over all a bit overwhelming. But there are Great small plate menu choices. We were there mid day in the middle of the week. There was no wait and service was excellent. The lemon raspberry cheesecake was amazing suggestion from waitress.
Brian B.,"Louisville, KY",19,83,123,5.0,4/27/2016,Again I've been a regular here for over a year. I can't believe I have not left a review. I usually come at 10pm so my experience isn't the dinner rush! We chill at the bar with Sergio or Jill. They take great care of us as we are here once or twice a week after work. It's Cheesecake Factory so expect a huge menu with everything you could ever want. I actually eat off the 'low calorie' menu. Lots of great options including GF and other health conscious choices. They even have a gluten free cheesecake option! I've always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory. It's a good spot even if it is a chain ;-)
Chris R.,"Louisville, KY",4,6,,3.0,6/17/2017,"Used to be fantastic back in the '00s.  Kinda falling off beat now, though.  If you like getting food that tastes like it came out of a can, this place is for you."
J L.,"Louisville, KY",25,4,2,5.0,2/2/2017,Food and Service is always outstanding been eating here over 7years. My expectations are always exceeded whether I'm dining in or using carry out service!
Jennifer D.,"Atlanta, GA",51,130,372,5.0,2/21/2016,"Oh my lord a date night was needed and the Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint! We started with the avocado, portobello, zucchini fries app and it was SO good! Then I got the buffalo wings which were good and a big portion- but pretty spicy so mind that. My wife got the skinnylicious grilled salmon and said it was delicious- a beautiful plate too. Service was prompt and polite and dessert was amazing as usual."
Kristin S.,"Louisville, KY",131,5,35,5.0,7/31/2017,"I had an amazing dining experience tonight at The Cheesecake Factory. Remarkably it was on the 2nd of 2 days celebrating National Cheesecake Day. Our wait during dinner time was relatively short. Our server, Andrea, was fabulous! She came to the table quickly after we were seated, greeted us, and took our drink orders. Within a few minutes, she brought our drinks and a fresh basket of bread. She asked if we wanted to begin with an appetizer, and when declined, she told us about the nightly specials. She took our orders, after I asked a couple questions and asked for her recommendation between two entrees. She kept our drinks filled during our entire meal, and she interacted with us frequently. I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad and my friend ordered Spicy Cashew Chicken with extra sauce. (This is the dish that I normally order, but I decided to order off of the SkinnyLicious menu to save room for cheesecake.) Both of our entrees were delicious! My friend only ate half of her meal, and Andrea boxed it up. I ate my entire salad. The tuna was fresh, tender, and spicy, and the shallot dressing made for a great finish. After dinner, I debated on which cheesecake to order. I decided to go with the new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake, and my friend ordered the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. My cheesecake had Nutella on top. Mmm. The best part--all cheesecakes were half-price! We both asked for our cheesecakes to be boxed to-go, because we were only planning to eat a few bites before taking the rest home. Both of us were very pleased with our choices. Both of us would recommend our entrees and cheesecakes. Andrea's attentiveness, humor, kindness, and work ethic made our dining experience quite pleasant. Can't wait to return!"
Rachel P.,"Louisville, KY",42,38,251,4.0,1/4/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is one of the few chain restaurants I eat at regularly. They consistently put out delicious and well prepared food which I appreciate. Service is usually really good but it's an extremely busy restaurant so patience is a must during peak business hours. The large portions (perfect for sharing) delicious food and beautiful decor make it worth the extra couple dollars you'll spend here. Don't pass up on the cheesecake but share its really rich and huge slices.
Mikel M.,"Louisville, KY",71,1,,2.0,8/3/2017,I visited the Cheesecake Factory this evening with 4 friends- -- working in the service industry myself- I understand how it can be when it's super busy- however- our service tonight I can not say was the best- we had 1 friend already there waiting for us- when we got to the table she had no drink in front of her- said she had not even been offered one - no water- nothing - the server finally approached our table after the other 4 of us got there.  We all had water- I personally ordered a side salad and chicken taquitos- I had to save room for your amazing cheesecake.  The salad I received was less than appealing- leaves- 2 tomato slices- and 2 cucumber slices--- I was hungry so I ate it anyway- but where's the cheese - the croutons- the onion ? The basics for a house salad? And an establishment as yourself I would expect better.  The taquitos I had- after eating what I could- because the chicken on the ends was absolutely BURNT- not just toasted but burnt!!!! I told our server I couldn't eat it- and he obliged and had it taken off our bill.  1 of my friends were offered a box to take her food- when 2 other of my friends needed a box as well but when he didn't even offer and walked away from the table- they decided they were no longer taking it home.  We ordered cheesecake- and when we asked for a box for one of my other friends- he brought out a box that wouldn't even fit hers-- so I had to ask the manager for the proper box so she could take hers and enjoy it at home...  the other girls also decided they wanted a box for theirs as well- when we asked he said he couldn't keep going behind the counter because of how busy it was.  Well as I said I'm in this industry as well- and when it comes to guests needs- the guest should ALWAYS come 1st.... we were ALL pretty disappointed with our service this evening- if ever we decide to return I just hope that the service won't be compromised due to the amount of business at the time ...
