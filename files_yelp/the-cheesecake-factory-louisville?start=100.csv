Jenene M.,"Joplin, MO",17,36,88,5.0,9/6/2014,"Love the atmosphere and food here.  Fish tacos are my favorite, I even eat the beans and rice, so much flavor!"
Penny H.,"Louisville, KY",0,3,,5.0,11/3/2014,"Great food, excellent cheesecake choices. Always have a good experience when we come here. Usually approximate 45 minute to 1 hour wait for a table."
Sarah W.,"Ypsilanti, MI",99,263,,2.0,8/25/2012,"The food is solid.  If you go, you'll enjoy your food.  But for the love of God, why am I waiting 90 minutes to eat AT THE MALL? It's loud, it's overpriced, and the wait is absurd even though they have been open for ages. This is Louisville people!  You can get the same frozen cheesecake at Liquor Barn.  Or, you could get a fresh, awesome, toe curling dessert at Sweet Surrender or Cake Flour or Homemade Ice Cream and Pie Kitchen or..."
Deb G.,"Urbana, IL",45,9,,5.0,10/22/2014,Food quality and service were both excellent. The desserts were fabulous. I highly recommend the Mac and cheese burger.
Tony R.,"Louisville, KY",223,160,147,4.0,1/28/2014,"Went there for my daughters 22 birthday celebration. Great busy atmosphere and we loved the food. A little pricey, but it was good and for it being in the Mall St Mathews area  guess its justified. Been there and done that and will do it again on another special occasion!"
Steven S.,"Louisville, KY",2,65,,5.0,9/25/2015,"Great staff, great food, wonderful environment...a little pricey though. Would definitely recommend and will return!"
Kathleen W.,"Oakland, CA",417,1556,90,4.0,8/12/2010,"Not bad ... surprisingly! Had dinner here on Wednesday night - and the only time I've gone to the Cheesecake Factory where there hasn't been a 45 min wait.   Our server was very feisty and friendly and reminded me that the Louisville charm comes in all flavors.  I ordered the hibachi steak which was prepared very well ... well seasoned, tender and a good medium rare.   The menu is a book ... and is way too dense with information (even if you don't count the 7 pages of advertisements) ... but would appear to contain some pretty tasty entrees.  All this was made sweeter when paid with a work credit card.  I did regret not getting dessert after working in the mall store till midnight though."
Patricia C.,"Louisville, KY",0,24,9,4.0,5/31/2015,"There is something for everyone here, from super-large portions to Skinnylicious choices. The filling lettuce wraps and a skinny margarita is a choice I often make on days I'm trying to eat lighter. (Hint: try to avoid glancing at the awesome cheesecakes in the dessert counter on your way to your table!). The pretty decor and sunny bar area is a nice spot on a hot summer late afternoon. Get here during happy hour for a lighter bill.  Service is inconsistent, which can be annoying, but the food tends to make up for that in most cases. And the patio is nice too!"
C K.,"Louisville, KY",0,2,,5.0,12/30/2015,"My girlfriend received a gift card for the Cheesecake Factory for Christmas.  Neither of us had heard of this place before or eaten here.  Read the reviews and was concerned with the slow service and take it or leave it comments.  Since she had the gift card we were looking at it from a free meal stand point.  Well, when we went inside we were both very impressed with the décor and they were busy.  Our apprehension from the reviews were soon put to rest!  We were seated immediately, two wait staff were there to get our drinks, water and sweet tea.  I ordered the Grilled Steak Tacos and she ordered the Chicken and Biscuits.  From the time we placed our order to getting our meals was 20 minutes!  Both meals were fantastic!!  The steak used in my tacos was very tasty & tender.  The beans were a black bean and had an amazing smokey taste! The rice was very good too!  My girlfriend's meal was excellent and she couldn't eat it all.  Our waiter checked on us frequently and was very attentive.  We did get a to go box and I had the left overs the next day.  We got cheesecake to go, she got Chris's Outrageous Cheesecake & I got White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia nut.... WOW..so good!"
Sam S.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",0,31,12,5.0,5/19/2015,My fiancé and I have tried a lot of filet mignon and Mac n cheese and we both agree that Cheesecake Factory is our favorite place for both. We also really enjoy the Oreo dream cheesecake. It has a really incredible oreo mousse layer.
Imran Q.,"Chattanooga, TN",18,189,23,1.0,12/31/2011,"This place is so overrated!   In a town where there are so many great places to eat, why would anyone come here?  Why pay this much for run-of-the-mill food?  If you want to eat this type of food find a Chili's or an Applebee's and pay much less. Now, the service was fine, the atmosphere is fine, etc.  The desserts were good - it's the Cheesecake factory, but again, I'm sure you could find a much better spot for good dessert."
Heather P.,"Lexington, KY",1367,1367,6002,4.0,3/21/2013,"My daughter...being a fan of cheese cake and food chains and wants to eat here every time that we are in the area. She claims that they have the best burger that she has ever eaten. They have the largest menu that I've ever seen and I order something different every time that I go. My last experience was ""pecan crusted catfish""...recommended by our phenomenal waiter. Usually I'm not a catfish fan because it often has a wild game taste but decided to venture out and I was glad that I did...it was excellent and not like any fish that I've tasted.  My husband once got the medallion steak and was disappointed, he didn't finish it...probably just so that he could have more cheese cake. Speaking of which...Oreo is my favorite. My only complaints are the usually long waits and scarce parking. One time we did the valet parking and waited over 30 minutes after dinner before someone appeared at the valet stand...so I don't recommend the valet parking and would recommend to go during the week and not during the peak/busiest times."
Kayla W.,"Louisville, KY",0,6,,5.0,6/3/2015,"I've never had a bad experience or a bad meal at this location, or any other one for that matter.  The food is always great and the service is always friendly and quick, once you are seated.  Sometimes the wait is long, but it's worth it if you can wait."
Andy S.,"Fort Myers, FL",131,105,128,3.0,1/22/2011,"Even as I write this I can't believe I'm giving the *Cheesecake Factory* a three star rating.  Even the name *Cheesecake Factory* sounds like a Build a Bear workshop for people with too much money but not enough experience to find a good restaurant.  But I'll be damned... the food is good.  I feel dirty. My wife was given a $50 gift certificate as a Christmas present then my fellow yelper Troy W. said they had the best fish tacos in the city.  I said I'd never go back but here I come, Cheesecake factory. We put our name in and waited for our plastic disc to buzz while we sat at the bar.  Two pints of Sam Adams Boston Lager were ordered.  Turns out Cheesecake Factory charges $5.50 for Sam Adams.  Jesus, daddy and the spook that's a high mark up!  Disc buzzes, on to the dining round. The dining floor is lit like a crack house.   My wife ordered the chicken thai noodles and I ordered the fish tacos.  I snapped a pick of the fish tacos but it's too dark to tell what it is.  The fish tacos are good.  Not the best I've had but I'd eat them again... if they weren't $14.99.  They can be ordered grilled or tempura style.  I went with tempura.  My only real complaint is the avocado on the tacos was almost non existent.  Other than that the breading was perfect without any greasy mouth feel or taste.   My wife's chicken thai noodles were amazing... and they should be for what they cost.  C'mon, man, this is a chain!  We're not eating at Les Halles!  The portions are huge and the food ranges from good to great.  I just can't get over the prices.  For two beers, two entrees, and two pieces of cheese cake, we spent over $70.  If prices were more reasonable I would have no problems returning.  I just don't feel like the cost to quality line up... especially for a chain... a chain at a mall. Oh - the cheesecake that this factory cranks out... just ok.  The key lime cheesecake I got from a Publix grocery in Florida was just as good for half the price."
Jennifer G.,"Signal Hill, CA",38,10,4,4.0,10/16/2011,"I LOVE THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. The food is really good and there is a lot to choose from on the menu, even a really picky person could find something they like. If you are going for dinner I would recommend calling ahead because that wait can get really long. Also, they are a little expensive, but the portion sizes make up for it. Usually I have a great experience, but this last time our waitress, Tabitha, was terrible. She started off great, but once we got our food she completely forgot about us. Didn't come back to see if we need anything and we had to flag her down so we could get the dessert menu and our checks. I  had a lot of food left over and she put it in one of the smallest boxes they had and it was running over. Other than that all the food was great"
R D.,"Atlanta, GA",57,43,13,5.0,5/1/2014,"I'm only here visiting and I decided to get lunch here. The staff is extremely courteous and the food was delicious. I just had the shrimp scampi and herb crusted salmon combo, and I order the Godiva cheesecake to go. Everything was great"
Daniel G.,"Louisville, KY",0,10,1,4.0,4/25/2015,The evening didn't start off well. There was a very long wait and I discovered they had some sort of glitch in their paging system. They arbitrarily placed us back on the list and advised of an additional wait of 15 to 20 minutes. Drinks and an appetizer came to the table quickly as did fresh hot bread. The meal followed just as quickly and was delicious
Rob S.,"Huntington, WV",0,3,2,4.0,8/20/2012,I am always leery of a 20 page menu and a restaurant that tries to be all things to everybody. Cheesecake Factory would be the exception to this rule. I support independent places as much as possible. When I choose a chain it needs to be something special. The Cheesecake Factories have never let me down.
Ronald B.,"Panama City, FL",0,56,4,5.0,12/29/2013,You cannot beat the cheesecake at this place!  10 stars!!  My favorite pasta is the New Orleans Pasta which is spiced just right and served in a portion size that is easy to share.
SD L.,"Cincinnati, OH",11,274,35,3.0,7/24/2010,"Same as Cheesecake Factories everywhere. I just wish the portions were smaller. We had a group and literally everyone ordered lunch portions, and they were still ridiculously huge.  They took good care of our birthday group and made an appropriate fuss over the 80-yr old birthday girl."
