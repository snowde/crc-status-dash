Victoria T.,"Louisville, KY",305,827,31,1.0,7/11/2008,"One might expect that an establishment famous for their desserts would be more receptive to diners who show up just for dessert. Our party (four of us) popped in for dessert before heading to the movies.  We were seated right away by a pleasant hostess. Our waitress, however, was annoyed that we were *only* having dessert.  I imagine that serving us a full dinner along with dessert might have garnered a larger tip.   We'll never know."
Stan W.,"Louisville, KY",0,7,,5.0,11/29/2013,"This is a great place to eat.  The food is absolutely wonderful and I have had many different dishes from steak, Italian, pasta, poultry, etc.  I don't see how anyone can give this place anything less then 3.5 stars. Anyone can have a bad night or a rotten/rude server. I will say with this place popularity they need more sitting in the waiting area or something. Other then that....SAVE ROOM FOR CHEESECAKE!!!"
Sean M.,"Prospect, KY",46,131,3,3.0,6/16/2013,"Start with desert because life is short. Delicious cheesecakes!! The menu is oversized and you should order a refreshment before you start looking. One you select your meal be aware that the portions are ""american sized"" and sail shareable. My kid love the salads"
Klint A.,"Lexington, KY",5,23,,4.0,4/4/2010,"I'm a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory.  It isn't perfect, and it is most certainly overpriced...but it is a good time, and I get consistently great food. Pros:  The menu is vast (literally something for everyone).  The food is good.  The service is friendly.  The cheesecakes are huge and great quality.  Vegetarian friendly.  Great artichokes - I can't get those anywhere else (out) consistently!  Cons:  The menu is vast (a little too much?).  The food is overpriced.  The tables are tooooo close together.  There isn't one in Lexington. Pro Tip:  Ask for a booth, it's worth the wait.  You can eat cheap.  The grilled cheese w/ fries is incredible.  The small plates (tapas) are affordable.  The appetizers are entree sized, just add a side.  Plan to take half of what you order home w/ you for lunch the next day.  If you have a kid with you, ask for free bananas and bread to start."
Mr And Mrs G.,"Dublin, CA",77,224,2787,4.0,10/5/2008,"MR says... what else? enjoy desserts first! MRS says... food would be 3 stars but to consider desserts, hours of operations and service, we're giving this 4stars :) we're a frequent because of cheesecake obviously and we just love it! there are times we get a slice of cheesecake while waiting for our table, we must have tried everything in the menu except the BANG BANG dish i just had a really bad experience with that BANG BANG dish years ago in california and never tried it since anyway what i noticed though is how the appetizers sampler dish varies from time to time. there are times we can nail the sampler by ourselves. serving should actually feed 4 people  maybe eating a slice of cheesecake while waiting for our table is a factor (wink!)"
Erin M.,"Louisville, KY",40,59,16,4.0,9/20/2012,My husband and I went here for our first anniversary. It was very nice. The food was very good. i got the fish and chips. It was a big portion and tasty. Of course we ordered cheesecake. There were so many the choice was overwhelming. I chose the turtle cheesecake. Yummy!
Kristen W.,"Louisville, KY",33,149,27,2.0,11/28/2011,"I went for the first time a week or so ago. The menu is so large it's hard to decide - you know they can't do everything really well. I got a salad and my companion ordered the Navajo sandwich. The chicken on both was very dry and we didn't eat it. Otherwise my salad was good and the service was great.  Sounds like a 3 star review, but the prices knock off a star.  Paying almost $40 after tax + tip for a lunch salad and sandwich just seemed absurd to me. I won't be back on my own dime."
Eve V.,"Prospect, KY",0,28,,4.0,8/1/2011,"Loooooool cheesecake factory.  Ok kids, first off, you must stop laughing to discuss the cheesecake factory. It's hard to do :( the cheesecake factory is the Godzilla  that ate PF Changs, the best parts ( gag) of The Olive Garden, and a J. Alexanders. The Cheesecake Factory stomped all over these places and regurgitated them out in a spewing barrage of fire next to a Victoria's Secret. Plus, cheesecake.  Before moving to Louisville, I had never been to one of these places. After the moving truck had left and I was sobbing amidst 89546 boxes my husband looked at me and said HEY, YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A CHEESECAKE FACTORY LET'S GO TO THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. This from a man who is a regular at Viajante on Picadilly Square.  Ummm, parking is never an issue at TCF. It's got mall parking, plus,valet. The restaurant, Awww shit, we can't even call it a restaurant... It's like a COMPOUND. the compound seats roughly the size of a small country. If the people of Monaco ever decided to go out to eat together they could probably fit in TCF. It's a clean place, with a sort of vaguely Mediterranean feel, and has lots of glass art sort of junk all over. They have GIANT booths that seat like twenty people.  The menu weighs roughly the size of a teenager. BUT THEY SERVE BOOZE, and they have about 100 different wines. The cocktails are pretty boozy too, and big, Both the Mojito and Lemon Drop I've had were actually quite good. And onto the food... I hate recommending TCF. There are hundreds of independently owned restaurants where you can get a better meal for cheaper. everything at TCF is the WORST part of Amerikkkkka, gigantic portions, sugar in EVERYTHING,  TCF is why you're fat, but..but...but.. The food is pretty good. It's not exactly innovative or exciting but it's good. After eating there I actually read a few articles about TCF to like, make myself feel better about not hating it. It turns out TCF is hugely popular with pro athletes due to the portion sizes. NPR had a segment about trying to disparage the food served there and despite terrifying calorie counts they just couldn't. It's consistently voted one if the best "" chain restaurants"" and it's pretty easy to see why. Stand outs for me include The Vietnamese tacos with Asian pork and lots of fresh cilantro, The spicy cashew chicken, and the Chicken and biscuits, which is perfect, trashy, buttery food coma goodness. They also carry something called a "" glamburger"" which I have never tried, but I like to imagine it's a hamburger covered in glitter and rhinestones. the worst part of the meals are the actual cheesecakes, they are just gooey globs of very mild cheesecake usually covered in syrups or stuffed with drugstore candy.  You sort of have to at least try TCF. It's like Disneyworld. You go, you see what all the fuss is about, you never have to go again. But if you do go, get a glamburger and tell me if it comes on a rotating, mirrored platform."
John H.,"Louisville, KY",40,13,,1.0,7/21/2012,"I had lunch there today, thanks to a gift card I received for Xmas. There was a ten minute wait for a table for some reason, even though I could see 10-15 empty tables in a section where they just weren't seating anybody. There wasn't anywhere to sit during this wait, because there were so many other people waiting, so we stood the entire time.  When our food finally arrived 30 minutes after we were seated, our orders were wrong. The food runner set everything down as fast as he could and ran away before we could tell him. He delivered two identical sandwiches, but called one a club and one a blackened chicken. I guess he could only tell the difference because of the side items, which were both NOT the sides we ordered. Five minutes later, our server came to check on us and started to correct our order, That whole process took another ten minutes. The blackened chicken came in two minutes while the sweet potato fries came five minutes after that. So, either the chicken was sitting under a heat lamp the entire time, or it was sitting on another table where someone else touched it and took it apart to realize they had the wrong sandwich. I know they didn't remake it because it came too quick. I know mistakes happen, but if the food runner had spent more than five seconds delivering our food, it could have worked out better.  By the time this was all worked out, we were both so frustrated that we barely ate the bland $12 chicken sandwiches and were ready to leave. The only thing that was faster than the food runner was our server when we asked for our check. She was ready to get us out of there, apparently. I spent 50 minutes of life dealing with this place. I want those 50 minutes back. I will never go back to this place. Ever. You lost me as a customer. Forever."
Matt H.,"Fairmont, WV",7,6,,1.0,7/3/2012,"The food was excellent, but the service was the worst! My sister and I ate at this Cheesecake Factory Saturday June 30th around 9:00. Our waiter never checked on us once. We were never offered refills. My sister got the wrong food, and it was never corrected. Very slow service as well. The waiter spent a lot of time at the table in front of us, and would walk past our table. We were right next to the computer used to enter orders. Avoid this location!"
James C.,"Louisville, KY",0,11,,4.0,6/25/2013,"Prices are steep, but it can be worth it.  Lots of choices on the menu and the food is pretty good.  Nice open atmosphere and friendly staff."
Ka-Lin H.,"Louisville, KY",24,95,8,3.0,2/21/2013,"I love Cheesecake factory. It's one of my favorite chain restaurants. They have huge portions and they are USUALLY consistent. However, this cheesecake factory is the least consistent of them all... and their ingredients are below average. I always get the calamari for appetizer, whether I eat in or take it togo. I have noticed that the portions of the calamari here is WAYYY smaller than all the other cheesecake factories. In addition, the last two times I got the calamari togo, it had a bad fishy/seafood taste. I love seafood, so I can take strong seafood taste. The calamari just tasted like they were in the freezer forever. Disgusting. The shepards pie I got last time was so gross. It had a strong meat taste. I dunno how old the ground beef was. NOT RECOMMENDED. I'm too scared to ever get the shepard's pie here again. I always get the louisiana chicken pasta, it's usually pretty good here. That's probably the only thing that's consistent so I will keep getting the louisiana chicken pasta from here. I've gotten the chinese chicken salad from here, it came without chicken. WHAT THE HECK??? Overall, this cheesecake factory is not as good as the other ones. This is the only one in Kentucky so I'm stuck with going to this one. Oh.. and I live like 2 minutes away so it's pretty convenient to do the curb side order. I just call ahead of time and they take out the food to my car. I do this on really cold or rainy days. hehe."
Pat P.,"Louisville, KY",0,7,,2.0,11/7/2011,"An impressively large menu, but lacking in quality. I try something different every time I find myself at The Cheesecake Factory yet continuously find myself disappointed. The atmosphere is nice and the service is great, but I enjoyed the lettuce wraps and the pumpernickel bread more than my entree."
Luke B.,"Killeen, TX",37,71,58,5.0,3/27/2011,Been there twice and both times the food was amazing! The wait can be a bit long and the price is a bit high but the food makes it well worth it.
Russ T. S.,"Nashville, TN",0,62,,4.0,2/3/2014,It is usually very busy. The menu is like a novel. Their steak is amazing as well as all their desserts. Service can sometimes be a little slow. Their prices are pretty high too.
Tom H.,"Louisville, KY",0,4,1,3.0,11/16/2011,"Service was slow and steak medallions were tough. I wouln't reccomend them. The place was very noisy and obviously geared to the younger crowd, not senior citizens. I guess it would be OK for a lunch but not our cup of tea for dinner."
Jamie S.,"Louisville, KY",2,85,2,2.0,9/8/2012,"I've been here about three times for dinner, always because I was with someone else.  The food is definitely not that great at all, especially for the price!  Last time I got a burger, and it was burnt.  I just don't think it's worth it and the staff is snobby and it's always crowded.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the cheesecake is AHMAZING.  My advice, get dinner elsewhere, and stop in and get some cheesecake to go.  The brownie sundae cheesecake is the best!"
Rebecca O.,"Louisville, KY",46,43,2,4.0,12/28/2008,"I like the atmosphere of the Cheesecake Factory, besides that the tables are too close together, it's a cool looking place.  The cheesecake, heaven on a plate.  Love the salads too, very huge."
Melissa M.,"Louisville/Jefferson County, KY",3,15,,5.0,6/26/2010,"I have been to a couple different locations and it is definitely one of my top 5 favorite restaurants! It honestly doesn't matter what you order, everything is amazingly tasty and come in such huge portions that you can take home lunch for the next day! I would like to recommend, our favorite-the Hawaiian Salad-it's so big that it takes two people to eat it. My husband and I generally go and split meals and leave very full. The menu is very eclectic, so it doesn't matter what kind of food everyone is craving, you will be able to satisfy a large group of people at this one restaurant! And, of course, you can't leave without having the famous cheesecake (which comes in so many flavors that you're sure to find one you like)-even if you just take a slice home for later. These are also plenty big enough to split. We especially like the Key Lime Mango and Godiva Chocolate (be warned that this one is VERY rich!)"
