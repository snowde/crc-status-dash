Rose R.,"Versailles, KY",0,14,,5.0,2/18/2017,Visited the location in the mall and was told strollers weren't allowed but we had a newborn and the car seat wasn't close. Luckily the hostess figured out a solution so I could take my daughters there for their birthdays. Food was good. Service was attentive.
Ellen T.,"Louisville, KY",47,16,5,2.0,1/11/2017,"I was promted to write a review following a number of poor service experiences at this location. Sonia L. was our server this particular evening and pretty much treated my mother and I with minimal respect. She did not let us know any specials, our food took longer than 20 minutes to get to the table. When we asked if she knew the status of our order, she may as well have rolled her eyes. When she told us to have a good evening, it was mumbled and she said it after she turned to her other table. This isnt the only poor service experience Ive had at this location and I wouldnt return if the food wasnt always on point. Hostess staff is always very friendly and accommodating, I just wish the servers had the same respect."
Petrice H.,"Tampa, FL",58,89,338,3.0,7/8/2015,"We had dinner tonight here after a very long day in the office and it was just ok.  I typically can take or leave the Cheesecake Factory so I don't think this review would be any different if I were in my own home town or a different location.  The service was decent. Our server was very nice and checked in is regular. The restaurant was clean and well lit, which I always have a problem with at the Cheesecake Factory because it always seems so dark in there.  I ordered the buffalo wings and the grilled salmon and they were both ok. However the mashed potatoes with my salmon was like warm and had a huge under cooked potatoes in it. The salmon lacked flavor. I had to put salt and pepper on it and the broccoli which was very hard. Obtaining he food was fresh but really not to my liking. The wings were delicious and he even brought me extra ranch dressing.  I give this Cheesecake Factory 3 stars because the food could have been better."
Lisa H.,"Louisville, KY",4,1,1,5.0,2/14/2017,"First time EVER, and the Cheesecake was just simply AMAZING! I had the Cuban sandwich, and was only able to finish half. My boyfriend had the Parmesan crusted chicken, which was also delicious as well as a huge portion. The Reece's peanut butter Cheesecake was the best thing EVER. It is pricey, but well worth it."
Alex M.,"Louisville, KY",116,44,9,5.0,1/25/2017,I love the Cheesecake Factory! They have an excellent staff and great food. The fried macaroni  and cheese was good. I enjoyed the macaroni and cheese burger as well! I love their cheesecake selection. They have the best oreo cheesecake ever! This is a good place to go to celebrate a birthday and or a big event in life. I am grateful that Louisville has one in our city.
Darrell M.,"Louisville, KY",152,10,232,4.0,4/4/2016,"Warning: Not an actual factory.  (I know, I know... too cheesy.  (See what I did there? :-D )) In a nutshell: The broadly eclectic menu means there is something for everyone, no matter how divergent your cuisine craving. Reconciling two different cuisine appetites can be a challenge sometimes and such was the case on Sunday night.  Rejecting his recurring Thai food suggestions and suffering a creative block myself, my dining partner threw out The Cheesecake Factory and it magically seemed to be the perfect choice.  (The gift card I received for my birthday last summer may have been the deciding factor.)   Sunday evening was not a particularly busy time and the 10 minute wait passed by in four.  After being seated in the bar area and taking in the somewhat ostentatious décor anew I noticed something which had escaped me before: the vaguely Egyptian theme most evident in the faces atop the columns. The menu is broadly eclectic and dramatically laid out across more than a dozen laminated, spiral bound pages (complete with ample advertising space!)  On some level, I think the notoriously bulky menu is itself both a literal and figurative marketing device.  Getting through the tome is more manageable if you identify the sections first and then delve into the cuisine which sounds most appetizing.  Unfortunately, there is neither a table of contents nor an index. The service was excellent with the perfect balance of attentiveness and graceful interludes of space.  The food was excellent with a portion size that insured leftovers.  The bar menu included trendy cocktails with cheeky names (The Modern Old Fashioned) alongside a deep wine menu and a surprisingly (refreshingly?) small number of well-chosen beers.  A craving for sweet potato fries prompted me to select the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which I paired with a Bells Two Hearted.  Perhaps not the most elegant of choices, but it was a satisfying combination.  Stuffed after eating just half my sandwich, but not yet so full that I hated myself ... I decided to do the only reasonable thing: order the cheesecake to go.  :-)"
david w.,"Louisville, KY",0,10,5,3.0,3/16/2016,"had the chicken salad sandwich. It was marginal, at best. Very bland, too many chunks of fat and gristle in the meat. The french fries were completely dead.  Service was adequate."
Victoria V.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,17,5,5.0,12/1/2016,"I loved everything about this place. Their food was amazing (they give you a ton of food), the workers were very friendly and everything was pretty clean. They also had a huge menu! It was so hard for me to pick just one thing to order!! 10/10 would recommend."
April W.,"Oceanside, CA",72,293,116,3.0,2/17/2016,"Came here for a nice dinner before heading home.  I was surprised to see that a Cheesecake Factory wasn't packed @6pm. That never has been our experience in Ca. No one greeted us. Matter of fact, we stood there. My whole family decided to go to bathroom. I looked around and saw the restaurant was empty. Figured I could go to the bathroom also. Worst bathroom. The toilets didn't fully flush, no toilet paper. The faucet was falling off the wall. And water all over the sink.  The saving grace to this visit was Rashonda. She was our server. She was quick, friendly & efficient. We loved her.  We love the avocado egg rolls."
Michelle C.,"Louisville, KY",145,133,215,3.0,11/10/2015,"The hubs and I have started a brunch tradition on Sunday's since we're both off of work. We had a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory so this seemed the perfect time to use it. We both got mimosas which were delicious but that was pretty much the only thing that stood out.  I got a monte cristo which is a crispy French toast sandwich that has ham and cheese in it and is served with preserves. It's a super interesting sandwich and the flavors were good. It was just kind of average though, nothing spectacular. You do get a MASSIVE amount of food though. I also got potatoes which were overly salty.  I think we'll stick to trying local places."
Aaron S.,"Louisville, KY",0,7,,1.0,5/5/2016,"Just called to attempt to make a reservation for Mother's Day. I understand having limited reservations, or a limited time to accept reservations. However, rudeness over the phone is neither acceptable nor professional. I love the Cheesecake Factory, but this Mother's Day my family will be going somewhere else."
Shanita B.,"Louisville, KY",120,88,50,5.0,10/2/2015,I love this place they have so much on the menu and today I got the salmon and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes and extra sauce that's what I always get in the Firecracker salmon is so good and the dynamite shrimp always a must today was very fast service very impressive this is a place that I will always go to
Mike C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",10,32,45,5.0,9/9/2014,"If you've ever been here before nothing needs to be said. In case you have not, you owe yourself to try it out.  I have been a loyal patron and big fan of Cheesecake Factory since I first visited the then new location in Marina del Rey, CA back around 1983. It never ever disappoints. The food is outstanding,  portions are over the top huge, and the service is too notch, all at a very reasonable price.  I could literally eat here every day for an entire month, never order the same item twice, and be very satisfied. Some fan favorites are Chicken Costoletta, Orange Chicken, Buffalo Blasts, TexMex Eggrolls, Crispy Mac and Cheese Balls, Sante Fe Salad, Firecracker Salmon...the list goes on and on.  Don't forget to save room for one of the many varieties of their namesake cheesecake! Plan on taking a doggie bag home."
Samantha D.,"Prospect, KY",64,100,116,3.0,12/4/2015,I stopped here for dessert so can't really give a review on food. I liked that we went at 1:30pm on a week day and there wasn't a huge line or wait time. Service was good and quick. I had a strawberry lemonade which was too sweet (and I love sweet things but this one was too much). We also ordered the anniversary cheesecake and I wasn't too impressed. Unfortunately I do not see myself going back.
K S.,"Louisville, KY",0,17,5,4.0,8/1/2016,"We eat here often. Tonight, we started our dinner with stuffed mushrooms and chicken samosas., I ordered the white chicken chili for my main meal. I give this restaurant four stars because I love their cheesecakes."
Kristie T.,"Jeffersonville, IN",186,570,1455,3.0,8/16/2014,"I've been twice, but last night was the first time I actually got the cheesecake.  My daughter and I got a piece to go and three of us shared it.  It was marvelous.  The food though is just okay.  The menu is seriously about 20 pages long it is so big.  I have never seen any other restaurants with that many choices.  I couldn't decide so we just got the buffalo wings.  The smell of the sauce was so strong it burned my nose hairs, but they weren't too spicy to eat.  The blue cheese dip was great and tasted homemade.  The service was not so great.  Our waitress checked on us often in the beginning to see if we wanted to order an actual meal, but after we got our wings it was about 30 minutes before she ever checked on us again.  So, when she finally came, that's why I ordered the cheesecake to go.  We had already been there an hour and a half with just the chicken wings and one beer."
Amanda W.,"Louisville, KY",14,52,32,3.0,6/17/2016,"It was ok. Maybe if I order something different next time, I may have a different opinion.. I don't exactly remember what I ordered but it was some kind of Mexican dish..The black beans were really good though. The spinach and artichoke dip was good as well, for my first time ever eating it."
Jamie M.,"Lexington, KY",99,90,407,4.0,11/4/2015,"Great selection, so many choices. Everything here is fabulous. Great service and you must try the cheesecake."
Kelly Y.,"Louisville, KY",88,290,1046,4.0,8/9/2012,"""No wonder this place is so damn popular.""  I thought to myself as I gobbled down more of the chicken cutlet.   This chicken cutlet from the Chicken Bellagio was so good, I told hubby it is a revelation for someone with a tired, choosy foodie mouth like me.  I never order white meat chicken when dining out cuz 9 out of 10 times it is going to be dry.  Well, I finally met that other 1 out of 10 times with this dish!  At the base is a large serving of capellini pasta flavored with basil; add two of those perfectly tender, flavorful chicken cutlets; add a big slice of prosciutto; then top the whole thing with a small mound of arugula salad.  The peppery bite of the arugula and salty prosciutto perfectly complements the chicken.  One bite of this mix will make you want more and more.  And I really appreciate the care and attention that went into the making of this dish.  They even chopped up the arugula so the diner does not have to wrestle with leaves bigger than their mouths!   We also ordered their Chicken Samosas appetizer.  It was the best version of samosas!  It's probably not authentic since the shell is made of the really thin, crispy skin, but that made it much more appetizer-appropriate.  We loved every bite of it.    Oh, yes, hubby said his Cuban sandwich was awesome as well.   I'm not a huge fan of cheesecakes so I ordered their tiramisu (not the cheesecake version) instead.  Mehhhhh, it was not that impressive.  I don't like it when restaurants mess with perfection such as adding chocolate sauce to this tiramisu.  The ladyfingers could have been more moist; the mascarpone layer tasted more like pudding...dont think I will get it again.  But I'm sure hubby liked his cheesecake, though.  Service was friendly, efficient and perfectly timed.  Our server gave us plenty of time to peruse the extensive menu.  He was always there at the right time for refills."
Becky M.,"Fort Campbell, KY",0,6,1,5.0,7/14/2016,Great service and food. Waitress was outstanding. This is the 2nd time I have came here the portion is well good for the size
