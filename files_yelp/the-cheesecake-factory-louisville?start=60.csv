April H.,"New Baltimore, MI",9,11,,5.0,6/11/2016,"My husband and I really enjoyed our very first visit here! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and awesome food! They have a huge menu! We had an excellent waitress. Lindsey was super! She did her job well. Friendly and funny and took her time to enjoy a short conversation with us!"
Lia L.,"Louisville, KY",0,28,14,4.0,6/26/2016,"The food is awesome here. So much to choose from. I've tried so many different items and loved everything. Surprising their cheesecakes ate not a big deal. I've had better at other placed. Which is weird since their name is cheesecake. Their cheesecakes aren't as creamy as they should be.  Something weird about this place, but it might just be a coincidence. Everytime I go with my black friends they sit us at the table next to the bathroom entrance or the table right next to the server station. This has happened over five times,always those same two table even though theres other open tables. Once when I took my dad there they did the same thing and sat us again next to the server station. But this time I asked to sit somewhere else and she kind of got an attitude with me. She told me to go back up to the front and wait. But it wasn't even a busy time and many empty tables. But we did as she asked and a lady that worked their saw us go back of front and approached us. Not sure if she was a manager, but she asked if all was ok and I told her that we didn't want to sit across the server station. She said no problem we have plenty of tables and quickly sat us.  I would like to say when I go with my white friends they never sit us at those two tables. As I said might be a coincidence.  I will still continue to go. I will not allow waitresses maybe stereotyping me keep me away from cheesecake factory."
Bruce L.,"Union, KY",15,10,6,2.0,9/8/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory has never been a favorite for me but it seems that in the past year the quality of the food (not the cheesecake) and service has slipped considerably. I travel for my profession and have visited the CF in Buffalo NY, Cincinnati OH, and Louisville KY in the past 4 months. All of them had slow, and I mean SLOOOOW, service and Improperly cooked food. If I have my way I will never step back in one again. But alas it seems that people love waiting for 30-45 min for a table to wait another 45 min for their poorly prepared dinners. I suggest you only stop there for dessert and spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere for your meal."
Kevin S.,"Portland, OR",266,234,82,2.0,3/1/2014,"Insane wait time, then I found out they skipped over my group of 6!? Whatever...the food is worth the wait...NOT. Their ""most popular"" entrée is some chicken with mostly mushrooms. Moving on to the cheesecake - just to make this review short and sweet - their portion sizes were reduced by 20% since the last time I came here 6 months prior. The apple streusel cheesecake, although delicious, was mostly just apples with a little bit of actual cheesecake. I'll just call it the Toppings Factory from here on out. The price that's paid to dine here I'd expect the meals to be balanced with complementing ingredients."
Emily P.,"Hardyville, KY",0,10,,1.0,11/8/2016,I was staying  at a nearby hotel and ordered curbside pick it. Ordered at 6:50 and was told that it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Arrived at 7:15 and called to let them know. Called again at 7:35 when no one had arrived and they placed me on hold. It's 7:42 and I was still on hold when they finally brought my food out. Such a disappointment. They didn't acknowledge the wait or attempt to apologize.  Even worse is that my food is lukewarm at best. I sincerely hope the service inside is better than the Curbside Pick Up
Erin K.,"Louisville, KY",118,165,40,3.0,2/9/2015,"I hesitate to review the Cheesecake Factory because, well, it's the Cheesecake Factory.  Nonetheless, here we go: My boyfriend and I came here around 3:15 on a Saturday and there was a 30 minute wait.  No big deal, we just hit the bar and had a beer.  When we were seated we chose the Crab Wontons as our appetizer.  They were good but there was virtually no crab which is a pet peeve of mine!  I ordered the Factory Burger, patties with tomato and onion on a french roll.  It was decent, cooked a little more than my requested medium.  My boyfriend had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger and he enjoyed it.  The best part of the meal was the fries.  They were nice and crispy.  I'm not much on dessert but my boyfriend demolished the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.  All in all, the experience was good and I'm sure I'll be back!"
Frances W.,"Louisville, KY",1,49,58,3.0,3/20/2016,"I ordered the Louisiana pasta dish and when they brought it to me, my noodles where not done. They were gummy and I had to send it back. I really didn't like the dish because the sauce was not what I was expecting for a Louisiana type dish. Also,all of out eating utensils were dirty and the waiter had an attitude about bring new silverwear. Not good for the prices."
Naomi P.,"Louisville, KY",58,17,,4.0,3/26/2016,"Who doesn't love the Cheesecake Factory? Delicious lemon drops and every cheesecake I've had has been perfect. It's a little expensive, though. Huge, huge portions, but all of It so good."
Stephanie C.,"Evansville, IN",1,24,6,4.0,12/14/2014,"Worth the Wait!!! Expect to wait approximately an hour to be seated. Once seated, we were promptly greeted by our server. She brought our drinks and ensured they remained filled. Our appetizer of Buffalo Blasters didn't take long to arrive. It was delicious!!! My husband ordered the Mac & Cheese burger and I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I couldn't even finish half of my entrée. So filling and yummy!! We did have cheesecake, but it was ""to go"" as there was no way we could find room. Will definitely visit this Cheesecake Factory when in Louisville again."
Sandy H.,"Georgetown, IN",80,227,218,3.0,10/12/2013,"Cheesecake alone deserves a gazillion stars. Ha. I loved their caramel turtle cheesecake. It was absolutely delicious. I started my review with the dessert since that was the best thing. And why I have 4 stars.  However, the service and the entree left me feeling a bit empty. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. Hmm, should have stuck with something I was more familiar with. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Cuban food. But, this sandwich. Not good. The pork was dry! I mean inedibly dry. I picked it off and just ate the ham on the sandwich. I will know better next time. Now, the sweet potato fries. Maybe I have a high standard of anything sweet potato seeing as I grew up in the ""Sweet Potato Capital of the World"" but these were rough. They were super dry and super hard. Some had grease seeping from them and crunch while others were to dry to eat. Meh.  The server. Man oh man. You'd think he was afraid of women. There were four of us. Now, we all like to joke with one another and also with others. I don't know if this guy was just stuck up or he is afraid of women. Either way, he was not good at his job at all. We had to stop other servers to ask for ours as he'd seem to disappear for extended periods of times.  I will be going back of course because I do love some of their menu items (they really need to break it down a bit and have a few great things compared to an overwhelmingly huge menu), and of course their amazing cheesecake."
Josh M.,"Louisville, KY",112,10,2,3.0,12/13/2015,"The atmosphere and food here is amazing!  The service not so much.  My wife, son and I wanted to get dinner before we finished our Christmas shopping so we decided to try the Cheesecake Factory.  Now let my be fair it was extremely busy and I don't want to paint an unclear picture.  Due to the malls parking being crazy I went in and put our name on the list and was giving a 20-30 minute wait estimate.  I thought that sounded good and then I returned to the car and we parked.  We had to park on the other side of the mall so when we finally made it back to the Cheesecake Factory I asked if our name had been called, afraid that our pager had been out of range.  They took several minutes to figure out no that it had not.  To make a long story about our wait short we waited at least an hour before I went back to the hostess and explained we'd been told 20-30 minutes and now been waiting much longer than that. She said they would be seating us soon, so I waited 15 more minutes.  Then we were ready to give up.  I walked up this time ready to just return the pager and before I could finish my sentence the three hostess just kinda said put them at table number whatever.  So they walked us past not one but 5 empty tables and sat us at the last one.  Maybe 5 people got up at once I don't know but I do know those tables were clean and ready to be sat and we were leaving but they just quickly put us in one when we were ready to give up.     Then the server did an ok job up until the end.  My son is 18 months so he makes a mess.  Because of this I always leave at least a 25% tip, regardless of the service because at the end of the day he causes more work for them.  I asked for the check as soon as we got our food because at this point the mall closed in a little over an hour and we still needed to shop.  I never saw the server again, no how was everything, no did you need anything else, nothing.       I would give this place one star because of how poor the service was, but I would be cheating the Cheesecake Factory because the food was very good and I forgot to mention the bar tenders were really good.  But the hostesses and at least my server was below average at best.  I get they were busy but give people realistic time frames and don't get your money and run!!!!!!!!"
Eduardo N.,"Louisville, KY",36,42,172,5.0,11/19/2014,"My first time being here and it was excellent! The setting is good for couples and groups. There is plenty of space and the booths are nice. The whole place is fancy. There is even a bar!!. The menu is great, there are literally tons of things in the menu and the prices are somewhat expensive but worth it for the range and quality of food. I give it a solid 5 and I will definitely be coming back to get cheesecake yes sir haha :)"
T M.,"Olympia, WA",1,29,,2.0,1/30/2016,"I've lived all over California, Tennessee, Washington, Missouri.....this Kentucky location is by far the worst!  No exaggeration, I don't think I saw even one server smile....not even one.  The service was so bad, you'd think the servers paid for napkins and drinks out of their own pocket.  I graciously gave the two stars for the cheesecake. =) So disappointed, so not worth the hour drive or $100."
Taylor E.,"Evansville, IN",36,2,,2.0,9/24/2016,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory before and have had great service, but I need to rant about what happened there tonight with my boyfriend... we got there and were waiting for our table and decided to look at the cheesecake selection. While standing there, a drunken customer stumbles over and starts leaning directly in front of me looking at the cakes. I moved out of the way and he proceeded to lean in front of me even further, with the back of his head inches from my face. After a few minutes of him continuing to do this, my boyfriend who is standing behind me finally says to him, ""Excuse you..."" and the man looks over at us and literally yells at the top of his lungs, ""GET OUT OF MY FACE!!!!"" My boyfriend said he was just telling him to watch out because he was about to step on me and the man keeps yelling. We ended up walking away and a worker came over to tell us she saw what happened and she was sorry and she let her manager know. The man was seated before us and nothing was said to him. We were seated and we ordered a calamari appetizer. Our entrees came out but we never got our calamari. I let our server know and she apologized but didn't seem to care. I worked at a sit down restaurant in college and if something like that happened to a customer, they would have been well taken care of and definitely not forgotten about like we were tonight,  and we probably would have given them a discount off their bill since the expected appetizer never arrived. Although the food is great, I was seriously disappointed with their service tonight."
Andy S.,"Memphis, TN",246,554,23,5.0,5/20/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain.  This visit was in Louisville, KY.  I find the restaurants pretty consistent no matter where you are.   Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants.  The cheesecake is really good.  I think their food is really good, too.  The portions are HUGE.  They're often on lists for having the most calories.  It would probably be best to share a meal, but I never have.  I always get my own.  I also always get my own cheesecake.  That's the fat person inside of me trying to get out.   I was lucky enough to have a gift card from my parents.   They had a sign that said ""everyone loves cheesecake.""  The decor is always nice.   I think they have the best brown bread ever.  I don't even like the white bread they serve when I compare it.   I had the house red wine, which was good.  .   My date had the shepherd's pie ,which he seemed to enjoy.     I had the burger with blue cheese and bacon.  I also had a side salad instead of fries but with blue cheese dressing.  Normally, I use minimal dressing, but this one was so good, I tore it up.   The burger was loaded with the bacon and blue cheese.  Super yum.   Garrett had the key lime pie cheesecake.   I had the most ratchetly delicious cheesecake.  Oreo!  The oreos were baked inside.  Super good and super fat.   I wish we had one in Memphis.  :)"
Janell M.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",0,50,,5.0,2/7/2016,The extensive menu and great service keep me coming back. There is always something new and exciting to try. The servers here go through heavy training so you can count on good service. You must get cheesecake here! Unfortunately you can't make a reservation so there could be a bit of a wait.
Noah N.,"Louisville, KY",0,16,5,1.0,3/6/2016,"Tried it 4 times, never liked it and never will I've took a Togo order that was placed 30min before pickup waited for 20min to get it. Spend 120$ for a meal for 4 with 3 salads. Nothing tasted good except the bread. Might as well go to Olive Garden, cheaper and better"
Irene F.,"Louisville, KY",0,5,3,4.0,2/29/2016,"While in Louisville with the swim team for a big swim meet, we went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner. It has been a tradition for the past two years. The service has always been good and the food is delicious. This year is different. I got my usual, a hamburger on a gluten free bun with lettuce, but I got tomato, onion, pickles, and mayonnaise on it. I'm pretty sure I said none of that stuff. I got it anyway. I picked off the vegetables except the lettuce and mayonnaise. Here's the thing, I don't like mayonnaise. I didn't want to be the one scraping it off of the bun with my cloth napkin, so I ate what I had. Later on, we had to wait forever to get cheesecake to go and our checks. We didn't get into our hometown until 11:30 because of how the service was just so slow. There should have been more employees working on a Saturday night, so service can be faster."
Tessa B.,"Pewee Valley, KY",0,8,,4.0,7/29/2016,"My husband and I celebrated my birthday here a few days ago. We had awesome service and food. We had the Spinach and Artichoke Dip which was delicious - must try! My husband had the mushroom burger which was huge and yummy. I had the Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. My only complaint is that there were 4 pieces of shrimp and like 15 pieces of chicken. For shrimp being the speciality of the dish, I had REALLY hoped for more shrimp. We had been given gift cards, so it was an enjoyable first experience."
Carbfriendly T.,"Louisville, KY",6,43,48,4.0,8/15/2014,The only thing that keeps this place from 5 stars is the spotty service. Our male server was inattentive at first. Then he was okay for a while and then he disappeared for a while... Our party of 3 order the chicken quesadilla as an app. It was light and crispy and cheesy and excellent.. We also ordered the stuff tortillas the chicken teriyaki and the pork chop. everything was excellent.  The cheesecakes were downright sinful. Our server apparently came to the end of the shift and his replacement was more attentive in  10 minutes than he was in an hour and half
