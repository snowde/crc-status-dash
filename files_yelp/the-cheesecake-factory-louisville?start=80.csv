Cameron F.,"Saint Matthews, KY",75,2,,1.0,1/2/2016,Wow I have never been to a place that has ran out of food before. Especially a restaurant like the cheesecake factory I am very disappointed.
Tj P.,"Louisville, KY",181,275,604,3.0,5/24/2012,"I have pondered on what to write for this momentous anniversary, my 100th review. And I've gone back and forth in regard to which spot I would choose to review, if I would dig from the 2-year vault or simply go with something more recent. So, I decided to basically straddle the fence and review a place I've been twice, recently and some time ago. However, this review will be mostly based on my latest visit. It's rare that I get a relative in town, even rarer that I have the opportunity to join them for a moment or two when they are here. Thankfully, with my new work schedule, I was available to do both. Meeting my aunt while she was in town for a conference was a nice way to spend a part of my evening, no matter the venue, but the Cheesecake Factory made for a pleasant backdrop. Spacious and beautifully appointed, the Cheesecake Factory is perfect for large casual groups or intimate couples. On this occasion, my aunt and I were joined by several of her co-workers. Most were from much smaller areas of Kentucky and the chance to see a little bit of the ""big city"", and enjoy some ""fine dining"" was likely part of the draw to eat here. Personally, I prefer smaller, local restaurants but the Factory was probably better suited to accommodate the group.  Because the group was moderately large and each of us were on separate bills, it did take some time for dinner to arrive. Dinner portions are huge. You pay for the size though and I wouldn't call it gourmet. Like much of the Cheesecake Factory, the food suffers from a bit of puffery, making things appear more than average. Sadly, average is what it is. The fish tacos I had were dry and bland, the chicken pasta my aunt had was swimming in olive oil. The thing about it is you don't come here for dinner, you truly come for dessert. Unfortunately, you may come away disappointed in that regard too. While the cheesecake is fantastically delicious, this is the one area where the portions are small for what you pay. All in all, while the restaurant experience was somewhat lacking, I came away enjoying the moment and the time spent with my aunt. In my book, that's a win."
Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16,4.0,3/24/2012,"I don't like cheesecake. When the GF found this out about me, she gave me this look like I had just drowned a puppy while giggling like a school girl. But we got past that. We came here because she wanted breakfast, I wanted decidedly NOT breakfast, and we needed to eat near Trader Joe's. It worked. I ordered a burger, medium rare. And it actually came out medium rare. It was amazing. The fries were some of the best fries I've ever had. The GF's breakfast was also cooked to perfection.  Service was amazing. Glasses were never empty, food came quickly, and our waitress was really nice and funny.  I really had no intention of rating it this highly, but the experience was just so good that I had to. I would still prefer to check out a local restaurant, but I did not regret my time here in the slightest. Good place to come when out at the mall. On a side note, has anyone else noticed that those orange things look like the Eye of Sauron from LoTR? I had to take a picture..."
Molly A.,"Louisville, KY",57,8,4,3.0,9/15/2015,My husband and I both ate from the skinny menu and I'm a first timer.  I was disappointed.  My shrimp was over cooked and pasta was dry and sticky. I ate most of my meal before the server came back by to check with us and by then I felt it was to late to say anything. I'll probably come back for a drink and dessert but we both felt similar dinners at Chili's was better!
Chris C.,"Louisville, KY",2,6,1,3.0,10/7/2015,"Food was good, not exceptional.  I had plans for a great, hearty meal but after waiting so long for service I settled on a salad and my friend had appetizers. Nothing else to say, food was ok and service was terrible."
Kelly S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",38,185,184,5.0,1/12/2012,"This Thanksgiving I took a little trip with my nephew from Detroit to Louisville, KY to Nashville, TN and back. On the way back we stopped for a bite to eat at The Cheesecake Factory. My 15 yr old nephew had never eaten at The Cheesecake Factory so I thought I'd let him experience the food/cheesecake. We decided to order 4 appetizers and afterwards he ordered a slice of strawberry cheesecake. Everything was awesome from the service, decor, coffee, food and cheesecake. The Chicken Pot Stickers, Chicken Sliders and Sweet Corn Fritters make me want to drive all the way back for more! The parking experience at this mall can be a pain so I was happy to utilize the valet parking outside of The Cheesecake Factory. The tasty little corn fritters were crispy, light, with just right amount of corn inside. Simply delicious! Also, the plain cheesecake with strawberry's on top was out of this world delicious. Smooth, thick, perfect taste and texture!"
Tracy T.,"Louisville, KY",0,2,,1.0,8/16/2015,Had lunch here today and spent $70 between 2 people. When we got there the place was almost empty but it took an hour to get our food - bowl of chili and a hamburger. The $7 screwdrivers kept showing up promptly though.  Won't be back.
Leah M.,"Shelbyville, KY",0,14,,4.0,3/1/2015,"We waited for around thirty minutes and were sat at a huge corner table. There was only two + one child in a high chair so it was a little odd. I'm not complaining though- too much room is better than too little. The service was wonderful as usual. Everyone was nice, attentive, and inviting. The food was delicious- especially the ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake."" So yummy! It's kind of pricey.. Especially for lunch, but worth the splurge."
Shana K.,"Louisville, KY",232,425,509,4.0,5/20/2012,We stopped in for dinner on a weeknight to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday.  We were seated in a booth after a very short wait.  I ordered the four cheese pasta with chicken and he ordered the crusted chicken romano.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious.  We finished with the Godiva chocolate cheesecake.   My boyfriend is not a foodie and doensn't usually get excited about food but he loved the cheesecake (good thing since it was his birthday!).  The service however was a bit slow.  We had the ask the waitress each time we wanted our drinks refilled.  That wouldn't be a major issue if their prices were significantly lower but at almost $60 for the meal the service should have been impecible.
Victoria M.,"Saint Louis, MO",12,5,,4.0,8/23/2014,"Husband and I had lunch here and the food is great. We live an hour away so this isn't a regular treat for us. We had the tex mex egg roll and shared the everything pizza. Both were incredibly delicious. The pizza was huge, neither of us went away hungry. We did not have cheesecake there since we were going to walk around the mall. Our sever was great. The staff was very nice. We went back to purchase a cheesecake to take home. I ordered a whole cheese cake and a slice to go. It was insanely busy when we came back (4:00) the staff at the cheesecake counter were very nice. I did have to wait longer than I thought I would for the cheesecake. It was worth it though."
Joe D.,"Louisville, KY",89,201,195,3.0,12/27/2013,"What can you say...consistent as the sun rising??? Yes, CFs food is always good especially the cheesecake. Tonight we decided to order appetizers and were not disappointed. Plates are large so be careful about ordering a lot of food if you are not hungry. Chicken lettuce wraps were tasty and served with carrots, cucumbers, noodles, cilantro and bean spouts. They offer three sauces, a thai cilantro sauce, peanut sauce and tangy tempura sauce. All were tasty additions to the boston bibb lettuce that was used to wrap it all up. Potstickers were okay but not great. The soy sauce was a bit salty for my taste. An arugula salad with raisons, nuts and slivers of parmesan in a lemon olive oil dressing was light and delish. You cannot pass up the cheesecake so we had the tuxedo and peanut cup renditions they offer. There are so many choices it takes a while to figure which one to order. My friends from Junior's Restaurant in Brooklyn were shouting at me for eating such a deviation from good old NY cheesecake but when in Rome... CF is always good and you can always expect good service and adequate food. Get here early to avoid the wait and then go see a movie at the new movie theatre!"
Keshia S.,"St Matthews, KY",37,62,37,4.0,11/16/2013,"Great service, wonderful happy hour, yummy food"
Bob S.,"New Albany, IN",7,17,,3.0,9/10/2014,"what can you say that those before have posted.  my wife and I joined our bfs for an early  diner.  I had the combo of  steak diane & herbed salmon which was cooked as ordered and was delicious.  excellent choice!  my wife got fish & chips which were just adequate.  next time she will go back the great club sandwich. the only, and I mean  only,  issue were  the fruit flies/gnats which were a real pain.  I do not mean one or two but a whole gang who really wanted our food.   if we had not driven so far for diner I probably would have gone elsewhere.  this should not be acceptable for a restaurant of this quality."
Jim G.,"Louisville, KY",2,10,2,2.0,2/20/2013,"Being an old senior citizen, it is hard to try new things. Grandson gave my wife & I a gift card for Christmas. The Louisville Mall looks like Christmas on a Saturday. Cars are backed up on the X-press way exiting onto Shelbyville Rd. Remember, 90% of the people are working, and few thousand Ford employees just got $8K  bonus. All that might explain the 40 minute wait. No chairs of any kind for old seniors to sit and wait. F.  Finally seated, and a waiter is going to impress me with his ability to remember what I ordered without writing it down. That always scares me. True to form, order was wrong. Another F. Didn't bring the salad until they noticed it was missing after the main meal was served. It included the wrong dressing. Had Blue Cheese, which I detest. My wife tasted it and said it was delicious. Couple 18 inches away in a long line of bench backed seating tables offered us some beans that you sucked out of the shell. Hey, this is KY, I had never heard of them,. They were great. Meals finally arrived, our waiter RENEE (The Mentalist) or something I could not understand, was ""On Break"" and a nice fellow was serving us. They brought the bread that was suppose to be as an appetizer with the meal. Overall food was very good. The grilled onions on my burger were great. French Fries way above average for Louisville; but leave salt off next time. My wife enjoyed here food too and the portions were such that we took  a doggie Bag home. Tried the ""famous Cheese cake. One step above Whipped Jell-O in a box. Save your money for something in the mall. The ambience of the place in noisey and you think your at a Casino in Vegas. I  would give the place another try on a weekday and see how it goes. Hope we get another gift card. Jim & Betty PCIM"
Troy W.,"Louisville, KY",4,323,700,4.0,1/3/2011,"One of my favorite chain restaurants. I love this place.  An individual can spend $15 (probably a drink an entree only) or easily spend $60. I once heard someone complain that this place is expensive. Yes, it can be... if you let it. A 20 spot will almost always take care of business for me. Sometimes I spend a little more. Bring an extra $10 to cover a slice of cheesecake.  Good:  The Mediterranean-style (I think) interior and decor does a great job of taking me to another place (Though I am, I don't feel like I'm at the mall on a busy commercial street.).  I swear I think the menu is thicker than a King James Bible. It's crazy thick with sooooo many ways to please the taste buddies. Like breakfast? Well, I do, and they have a whole page with nothing but omelets served all day. They also have some of the best fish tacos that I've ever had.  Like booths? Well they have 'em. They are big and over-sized. They even have a few round table booths. (Note: regular tables make up most of the seating in this place.)  Bad:  If you do not have the luxury of eating at a booth and are seated at a regular table... be warned... they are practically on top of each other. It is tight. Once at a table, I found it impossible to not watch a guy eating lettuce wraps who was about three feet from my face. I had to make an extra effort to talk to my friends who seemed further away than the lettuce wrap guy.  It gets crowded easy. What do you expect?... it's a popular place. When there is a crowd, it is standing room only (there are only a couple of small benches. The pages they hand out when reach into the mall enough to find a few more benches... but this is still very limited even when the mall is open.  Overall... I love it. When I feel like some excellent, chain-style grub, and I know I'll be in the neighborhood (the land between the malls!), I try to work in a visit."
Karen P.,"Austin, IN",70,7,8,3.0,8/8/2015,"I visited this restaurant this evening with a party of 7.  I was given a ""buzzer"" and told my wait would be 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 mins.  I left the restaurant briefly and returned to a bench just outside the restaurant and waited until I was 50 minutes into that 1 hr - 1 hr 15 mins and I went inside and stood and waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, waited, and waited some more.  They were calling names from time to time in spite of the fact that we were given a ""buzzer"".  When we approached the hostess table we were told that our names were just called.  In fact, there is no way that this could have occurred.  We were finally seated approx. 1 hour and 45 mins later.  We promptly had water at our place settings and bread waiting on the table.  The waitress did promptly take our order and we were fed very quickly!  Unsure who was working the kitchen, but they made up time with their mad skills.  The manager came by our table and he was very nice.  He offered dessert on The Cheesecake Factory, which tremendously soothed my anger.  I had Chicken Marsala, which was perfect, as it is each and every time. NI believe we had an untrained hostess on a terribly busy night."
Tonnie B.,"Frankfort, KY",0,1,,2.0,1/30/2016,"First visit here . Food very good and hoclean and nice atmosphere. Only complaint not really crowed ,but waited way to long for food."
Kellyo O.,"Prospect, KY",201,512,1121,5.0,7/5/2013,"Yes, I know it is a chain but obviously they do it right or they wouldn't have been able to become a chain. Right? Yup! Hubby and I stopped here after eating an anniversary meal at a fancy restaurant and even having desert (that wasn't very good). I loved our waiter, he sang, he danced, he was as kind as could be! Definitely ended our night on a high note! I have yet to be very disappointed with this restaurant. Oh and this time since we just came for cheesecake we sat at a high top in the bar area and it was great. Nice and relaxed."
Karen W.,"Princeton, IN",0,2,,2.0,1/9/2016,"Well this was our second visit, most of the food was good but, some of the food was very poor . I ordered appetizers it was the wrong one so they took it back then it came the same time as my meal, I then found 2 big chunks in my potatoes and asked to speak to the manager , They brought me a new bowl of potatoes  and found another big chunk potato. At this time the manager showed up and I told him about all of this . Got my bill the only thing they took off was appetizer . I feel that my meal should have  been free . I feel like it is ran woth very poor mangament."
Virgil G.,"Louisville, KY",3,16,21,5.0,7/3/2013,"My favorite is the ""Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake"". Their food is really great also!"
