Juv L.,"México, D.F., Mexico",4,41,97,5.0,10/30/2016,"Wow. The brunch here is EVERYTHING! I had fried chicken and waffles with eggs Benedict. They were perfect in every sense. The hollandaise sauce was light and tasty, the eggs were perfectly cooked. So much food. This just became my favorite brunch place. We need one in la roma, closer to home."
Mauricio R.,"México, D.F., Mexico",0,35,7,4.0,3/21/2017,"The service and the food are good. Nothing out of the ordinary. We've noticed they change their menu quite a bit and they have removed dishes that my family and I thought were delicious and they have kept dishes that we don't necessarily think are great.  Also, when you come make sure you come prepared to wait a while to be seated and for your food to arrive. The waiters are generally very disorganized and they tend to take longer than they should to bring you your food. All in all the food is good and normally our experience in the Cheesecake factory has been positive."
Mauricio R.,"Spring, TX",0,26,6,4.0,3/12/2016,The food is good. I've been here a few times already and the quality of the food is always great. What gets points taken off is their service. The service here is always pretty crappy. Slow and distracted. If you come here you are going to be satisfied with the food but annoyed with the service so make sure you come in starving and with plenty of patience.
