Cleda W.,"Madison, WI",549,137,109,4.0,11/25/2017,"Chain that mostly in larger cities. We are lucky to have one in Madison. For this particular location, it's mostly a hit with a few misses. Each time, the food is fantastic. The service is okay. Depends on the day and the server. Food: So many options. Too many options. Great for picky eaters because they will find something. I recommend the chicken samosas and fried zucchini for apps. These are my go-to apps. The calamari was too greasy and over breaded (so much that the breading was not cooked all the way for some of the pieces). I love their pastas. The burgers are massive. Fries are always hot. Portions are large. I always have enough to have two extra meals the next day. Some of my favorites include the Cajun Chicken Littles. Tip: sub out the corn succotash for their Mac & Cheese. Do it. The bread to share for the table is free. Some times it's warm and some times it's not.  Ambiance: it's low lit. There are a lot of tables. Bar looks nice High tops -- look uncomfortable. I recommend a booth because their chairs are not that comfortable. All weekends are crowded. There will always be a wait. Go a bit early so you can grab a pager and get on the list. Service: Ok. This is where it's a miss sometimes. I understand that it gets busy. The last server I had was great in the beginning, but then it went a bit downhill. I asked for a glass of ice and it never came. Refills on drinks were not automatic. We had to ask each time for different people. Plates were never cleared unless they were boxed. This day, it was not busy so I am not sure what happened. Overall --- good place for a group of people, a first date or a place to bring the kids. Lots of friendly smiles. Oh, of course-- the cheesecake is great. Linda's Fudge Cake. Try it. I am not a sweets person, but this cake might convert me."
Amy G.,"Oregon, WI",30,46,69,3.0,10/15/2017,"We decided on The Cheesecake Factory for our latest date night.  When we arrived it was obviously busy and was told it would be a 30 minute wait, which was fine as we wanted to do a little shopping anyways.  The wait was closer to 45 minutes so by the time we got seated, we were starving.  We waited another 10 minutes or so for our server to take our order.  We ordered our drinks (JW's Pink Lemonade for me, and a Modern Old Fashioned for my husband) as well as an appetizer (Chicken Taquitos). The Taquitos were good, almost an exact twin to the Firecracker Chicken Wraps at Longhorn.  My drink was super delicious, but if I had known it was going to be $10.50 (their prices aren't on their menu for cocktails), I probably would have ordered something else.  We ordered our meals (Chicken and Biscuits for me, and Thai Coconut Lime Chicken for my husband) and they arrived promptly.  One of my biscuits was very overdone, borderline burnt, but otherwise my meal was good, and my husband enjoyed his as well. We were in and out in about 45 minutes, which is pretty good for a very busy Friday night.  The bill was a shocker though; I had no idea the drinks were that expensive (about $43 of the bill was just drinks), nor was I wanting to spend nearly $100 on dinner that night.  If the service was amazing and the food was spot on, then I could see it warranting that price."
Janice J.,"Madison, WI",11,71,17,4.0,8/28/2017,"I wouldn't have chose to eat here as we prefer to stay away from corporate but this is where Grandma wanted to go - and who can deny Grandma? =)  We got here around 4:30p on a Friday and the place was empty.  Our server quickly greeted us and took our drink order.  I was so overwhelmed with the menu, and I noticed there were duplicates between the regular menu and the specialty menus which didn't help.  I'm a big fan of small menus that you do really well versus the large menu that you do mediocre.  All four of us ordered something different, tho, and it was all amazing.  The bread that came before the menu was tasty too - with a few different options. I got the bang bang chicken and shrimp with brown rice and my fiance got the jambalaya.  He somehow managed to finish most of his while I ended up taking 3/4 of mine home.  It was just as good leftover and it fed both of us lunch the next day.  All four of us also took a piece of cheesecake home.  I hope that no one eats the entire piece in one sitting....it took me 4 different times to finish it (which is JUST fine).   I always hear how big their portion sizes are and how terrible (for you) the food is.  I don't feel like this is a place to come if you're watching what you eat, plain and simple.  If you're on a diet, just stay away.  This place is a treat, not a regular eating spot.  Their ""skinnylicious"" menu is a joke - don't let the clever words fool you.  Pot pie should never be on a ""skinny"" menu! Our server was decent - nothing fantastic - but he did his job.  The place was immaculately clean, well decorated and a bit on the noisy side.  We will likely take a piece of cheesecake to go but doubt we'll ever return for a meal."
Suzanne X.,"Madison, WI",323,105,506,4.0,7/30/2017,"Maybe 3.5 to be nice, rounding up since I already rated it 3 for our previous experience. However, given our waitress was accommodating and nice, we'll be a little more generous in our rating.  We came back, this time it was to celebrate a friend's last day in Madison (goodbye, farewell, definitely come back to visit!) and another friend's belated birthday, so we had a large crowd of 15.  Friends arrived around 7:30PM and waited patiently till 8:15 before we were finally seated (it was the double seat tables in the back by the kitchen grouped together into two larger separate tables - we went ahead and just combined the separation, the reasoning was since it was a curved seating, it didn't fully align but having it separate seemed more awkward).  Given our large party, the waitress took down our drink orders and then came back shortly after for our food order. In a little while, all the food arrived in what seemed like a shorter period of time than when we were waiting for food the other day.  The food itself was just okay. Again still overpriced for the quality of food we received, but nonetheless, edible and delicious especially if you're starving. We didn't finish our meals till 9:30PM, given how long it took to seat us and then a few friends orders cheesecakes and other desserts. For our belated friend's birthday, they even provided a free fudge dessert (she ended up not eating it since she already ordered tiramisu cake but another friend happily gobbled it up).  When it came to the bill, the two friends meals that we were out to celebrate were split onto the remaining bills. However, one item was only split onto two bills, waitress was nice enough to have this as a separate bill and allowed us to chip in to pay for it separately. Overall, it was a pleasant experience."
Tina L.,"Madison, WI",120,54,111,3.0,7/7/2017,"It is undeniable that this is a popular and trendy chain of restaurant. The design is the same every where. Customer service has been great for me so far. The food: Warning! Huge portion!! I always have to take half if not even more ham half packed to go and have food coma later. I would say you will definitely get the money worth with the portion even though it is a little bit more pricey. They offer a wide variety of cuisine and food but everything is average. If only they focused on one cuisine and made it really good.  The cheesecake: Very big as well! And they have the most variety I have ever seen. 90% of the cheesecake that I tried here have been very good. It is, though, very chocolaty, creamy, fatty, cheesy, etc. In short, you get a tons of rich flavor in one bite.  Side note but I really love the brown bread they have before the entree. And good news is it is free so of course I always order more of that :P"
Lauren H.,"Madison, WI",98,193,184,4.0,7/28/2017,"I had not eaten at a Cheesecake Factory in a good 10 years, and I've spent those years thinking the Cheesecake Factory is just a typical chain with mediocre food and a large variety of cheesecake. I was pleasantly surprised with my recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory. Pros/cons of my experience at this Cheesecake Factory: Pros: -Our server named Caleb was friendly, professional and attentive. -My salmon dish was wonderful. The salmon tasted fresh, and the dill cream sauce was excellent. The sauce ratio was perfect since it lasted the whole meal as I was able to eat every bite of my salmon, broccoli and potatoes with the sauce and still had a little extra when I was finished eating. (Well, I'm someone who could simply drink dill cream sauce ...) -The cheesecake (we tried tiramisu and chocolate chip cookie dough) was heavenly. Cons: -The mushrooms with my salmon dish weren't cooked very much, and they were sort of bland. They seemed raw in texture. -While the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake was great, the actual cookie dough chunks in the cake had an off flavor like processed cookie dough. I know the flavor of from-scratch cookie dough, and this was not it. -Why are the calories for each slice of cheesecake typed on the menu?! I'll definitely return."
David H.,"Sun Prairie, WI",19,481,270,3.0,10/15/2017,Mixed feelings about the chain. Fancy seating and lighting. I've been here a few times and its been hit and miss. The menu is massive! If you cant find something you want here you should just give up. If I could rate it a 3 1/2 I would. I had the Steak Diane last time and it was just ok. I can make it better at home. The cheesecake each time has been amazing! Each time it was a wait which isn't the most fun thing. Plenty of seating just not enough staff.
Stephanie W.,"Madison, WI",28,172,41,4.0,5/22/2017,"I absolutely love the cheesecake factory and I love their location. All of their food and especially the bakery are amazing. I wish I could give their store 5 stars but unfortunately I have had not such good experience with calling in for take out food. I've tried it twice, one time I gave up after 20min being on hold and literally being transferred from one staff to another. The other time, finally after 15min I was able to place my other and pick it up. They need to improve their way of calling in their orders. Putting an order in in the store itself, and picking up is not a problem, but something is not working on the telephone end. I like the ability of rapid pick up on the curb side of the restaurant. This place has a great location, and the ability to seat people inside, in the mall and outside. Their decor reminds me a Las Vegas casino - anything can happen. Don't forgot to leave room for dessert as their portions are quite large."
Thomas T.,"Cross Plains, WI",24,278,16,3.0,1/31/2017,"Where to start?  Walking in, it had the feel of a Vegas casino.  I know that sounds strange, but hear me out.  It's large, open, and feels fancy with browns and golds throughout the dining area.  But what really got me was the smell.  It had the aura of a piped-in perfume, much like some Las Vegas casinos and their reception areas.  I'm not complaining - it was nice, but not what I expected. We sat down as a group of 8.  Plenty of room - it wasn't busy at all (11:45am on a Monday).  As we all know by now, the menu is extensive.  Knowing this ahead of time, I was browsing online to narrow down my choices so I was ready at game time.  I went with the pit beef dip sandwich that came with fries.  I had heard about the gigantic portions, so I figured for the $14.50 I would eat half of it for lunch and save the other half for dinner.  When it arrived, I was a little disappointed to see it was ""normal sized"".  It was delicious - no doubt.  I'd eat this again (and again and again).  The portion of fries was also reasonable.  Frankly, it was a great portion for lunch, but the price was steep for what I got. Everyone else seemed pretty happy with their food - ranging from jambalaya to white chili to a chicken parm sandwich.  As we all got our food and started to eat, we noticed one in our party had no food.  After a minute, a manager (SUPER nice and very attentive) came by to apologize for the meal not being ready - it was done, but not done properly, so they were making it again.  Great - I love that they have standards!  The manager also was quick to say there would be no charge for that meal.  When it came out, we all thought it looked great. I'm not a big cheesecake fan.  I love cheese.  I really love cake.  But let's keep them separate, please.  So I miss out on that draw with this place. All in all, I'd eat here again, but I'd rather do it with a BOGO coupon or something that dials in my perceived value.  Or if work was buying or something.  If I was out with people and they said ""hey, let's grab lunch somewhere"", I would suggest something else (financial decision).  The food is really good, but lots of places offer that. If the prices are more reasonable, I bump this to 4 stars."
Emily D.,"Madison, WI",78,136,19,3.0,10/4/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory, aka 'Ole Trusty. You don't come here for their culinary prowess or ambiance. You come here for the giant portion sizes,1000+ calorie slices of cheesecake and wear stretchy pants and flip flops without judgement. The menu is outrageously huge, so even your adult sister with the palate of a 5 year old will find something that they will not complain (too much) about. So glad to have this, not really a factory, factory, in town."
Erin B.,"Madison, WI",12,92,83,4.0,7/18/2017,"I'm definitely torn between 3 and 4 stars. But since it was better than I thought it was going to be, I'll round up. It was my first visit since usually over the top chain restaurants aren't my thing. But, lo and behold, I found myself there with a friend the other night. I felt like I walked through a narnia door of West Towne Mall into a Vegas casino restaurant. It's a huge place, and was pretty busy on a Friday night. But we got a table right away. The menu was extremely aggravating. It was too large - too many pages and too many sections. And fine, yes it's good to list calories so everyone knows how much they're going to eat, the calories in everything there was appalling. I mean, it didn't stop me, but still appalling. The only way to get a meal under 1000 kcal is to order from the Skinnylicious menu. Yes, that's what's it's called. Is this place especially built for pre-bachelorette party dinners? Grrr. One last complaint, our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, but way too overbearing. She must have stopped by our table 20 times just to check on us. If you're wondering if I gave them four stars by mistake, hang in there. We had cocktails that were amazing and our food was fantastic. I loved my Asian pear martini and the miso salmon was delicious. The Korean cauliflower was ok,but it had too much breading. Wine/beer list was ok. And yes, the cheesecake was good. Not best thing I've ever eaten good, but yummy. Service was overall very good. Everything was served in such large quantities that we had a lot of leftovers. I won't rush back, but I'll be much less dubious when friends tell me how much they like the Cheesecake Factory."
Carolyn S.,"Madison, WI",16,60,145,3.0,12/29/2016,"I've been here twice within the past year. Once for dinner and once for lunch. First off, let me say, that the decor is very nice and ""fancy"" for being a restaurant located inside the mall. With that being said, it is a nicely dim lit atmosphere compared to the lively brightly lit shopping you may have done previously, perfect for sitting down to a relaxing meal. The ambiance earned 2 stars from me.  As for the food, I'm ambivalent. The menu is quite extensive, and as good as that may seem, I think if it were shorter, they could focus and perfect the offerings. They offer complimentary bread loaves (a sourdough and a sweeter dark loaf) with pads of butter. Hope you've got strong teeth. The sourdough especially was more than crusty. I think I tore the roof of my mouth on that sucker.  My first meal there was in the evening. I had the Steak Diane. Medallions of tender steak in a mushroom wine sauce, served alongside mashed potatoes. While I did enjoy it for the most part, I was also aware of how calorie dense it tasted.   The 2nd meal I had was at lunch time. I ordered the beet arugula salad with goat cheese. It tasted pretty good. I've had better at other restaurants though. The spines of the arugula were a bit on the tough side. However, I am grateful that a restaurant IN the mall offers fresh greens and vegetables as an option, if you don't want to eat heavy. (you can find it on the ""skinnylicious menu"" or in the ""small plates & snacks"" section of the menu.). We also split an order of the flatbread with sausage, ricotta and kale. I loved it. Probably my favorite thing I've had in this restaurant, and I don't even like sausage!  Okay, now for the main event, the cheesecake! Ummm, for a $7 slice of cheesecake, I'm expecting to be impressed. Wow. (That's an unenthusiastic ""wow"" by the way). Both times I was too full, and took my cheesecake home for later. It's fluffy cheesecake, not the dense, 'resistance against your fork when you cut in for a bite' type of cheesecake that makes you aware that there's actually, ya know....cream cheese in there. If you love the whipped type cheesecake desserts, then you'll probably love it. Plus, there are so many flavor choices to choose from.  So, to sum this up, I would visit again, if I've been shopping this mall and am weary and hungry. I would visit this restaurant if family or friends want to meet up there, but I would not single this place out as a restaurant to visit because I keep thinking about the food.  Prices are elevated for the quality of food you'll be receiving."
Alexandra S.,"Appleton, WI",9,61,86,5.0,2/20/2017,While my friend and I were in Madison doing some shopping we had a craving for cheesecake. What better place to go other then the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake and my friend ordered chocolate hazelnut crunch cheesecake. Both were excellent. Whenever I am near a Cheesecake Factory I always stop and get one to go.
Betty N.,"Hanover Park, IL",0,4,3,2.0,8/13/2017,"Definitely a case of the restaurant franchise and quality problem.  Our waitress seemed overworked, tired and unfriendly.  Not only did my silverware come with dried food on it, so did my boyfriend's. I've attached pictures of the dirtiest ones- be sure to check them before using them. Food was bland, overpriced- you are paying for the ambience and interior decoration than for the food, some of the ahi tuna slices were shredded and simply layered underneath other ones to hide it, was not fresh, very corporate-franchise. I doubt they have a real chef in the kitchen.  They could've at least made the plating attractive. Not the worst restaurant experience, but I'll not bother to come back."
Kristine N.,"Madison, WI",2,16,36,4.0,11/23/2016,"My sister and I come all the time for Sunday brunch and I am a fan. One thing I enjoy about Cheesecake Factory is their complimentary bread basket, including a sweet, wheat bread and a crispy sourdough. The warm bread is a great started before our meal.  Our usual order is the Bruleed French Toast ( $10.50) and the Spinach and Mushroom Omelette ($11.95). The French Toast is huge and so good! The outside is crisp, whereas, the inside is light and fluffy. It comes with one strawberry on top (why not more strawberries?!?!?), with great syrup.  The omelette is fluffy, stuffed with excellent sautéed mushroom and spinach. The omelet also comes with toast and country-style fries. The omelet is served all day, whereas the french toast is only served on the brunch menu (from 10:00am- 2:00pm).  I also love their cheesecake. I have tried the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake, Fresh Strawberry, and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake ($7.95/slice). You can't go wrong with any flavor!  Cheesecake Factory is usually a go-to for dinner, but I prefer their Sunday Brunch menu. Definitely try the brunch here and don't forget to grab a slice of cheesecake on your way out!"
Elisa D.,"Houston, TX",1,27,5,4.0,7/30/2017,"We came here for the National Cheesecake Day celebration expecting madness, and madness it was.  After a 30 minute wait for a table, we finally were seated and greeted by Jackie, who turned out to be a fabulous server even though she was extremely busy the entire time we were there. Cheesecake was half-price, so my mother and I ordered a slice of the vanilla bean cheesecake and a slice of the cheesecake they were debuting, the celebration cheesecake. Dad, for some reason still unknown to us, ordered a salad.  While we waited for our cheesecake, dad munched away on his cobb salad which he very much enjoyed and would absolutely order again. The kitchen was moving a lot faster than the cheesecake area which is understandable, but coordination could have been better so that my dad wasn't finished with his food by the time ours arrived 20 minutes after his.  The vanilla bean cheesecake okay. I've had some really excellent vanilla bean desserts, but this was just so overpowering that the vanilla bean flavor had me tapping out before the sheer richness of the cheesecake. What was worth the hour long wait was the celebration cheesecake. 1.5 to 2 times the size of their normal cheesecake slices, and just as good. The cake portion was perfectly cooked and not soggy at all, the strawberry layer popped without overpowering the rest of the dessert, and the sprinkles and funfetti were just downright fun. Hopefully they keep this one around!"
Milly C.,"Oregon, WI",3,31,1,4.0,9/23/2017,The Cheesecake Factory is one of my FAVORITE restaurants in the Madison Area. They have a great menu and amazing cheesecake. The only thing that sucks is service is either hit or miss
Nick D.,"Madison, WI",22,22,4,5.0,10/1/2017,"Amazing food, great presentation, great service.. the only thing is that it's gets loud as the place gets filled up. I've had probably half of the things on the menu and everything is amazing!"
Vilay W.,"Windsor, WI",55,195,339,3.0,3/28/2017,"This place was super busy! Kind of wish it wasn't part of the mall. It has potential to be a nice romantic spot or a more quiet intimate spot for a dinner. The tables are so small, the place seems cramped. There were so many people breaking dishes and dropping things on accident because of the tables, or lack there of, I mean... the tables are pretty small... Sheesh! But this place has potential!!! The food was pretty good! Their Caesar salad was okay... I was pretty spoiled with Rare's Caesar salad."
Stacey L.,"Madison, WI",1585,966,1661,3.0,1/14/2016,"Ah, so torn. I'm probably closer to a 3.5, but the insane calorie count convinced me to round down instead of up. While I enjoyed my meal, I don't know if I could again knowing how awful it was for me.  While running errands on the westside my gent decided he wanted to try The Cheesecake Factory because he hadn't eaten and wanted, in his words, ""something heavy that will sit in [his] stomach for awhile."" We made our way to the packed mall and were told it'd be a 50 minute wait. That's about what we expected so we took our pager and wandered the mall for a bit.  Somehow we managed to avoid many of the service issues that many reviewers seem to be encountering, but our server is also one of the better ones I've had in awhile at any establishment - shouts to Brianna J. if anyone from CF reads this. Our food all arrived in a reasonable amount of time, we (mostly) got what we ordered, and we were out in about an hour.  For a starter we had the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Meatballs. Not something I probably would have ordered myself, but I gave them a try and they were delicious. The bleu cheese dipping sauce was a bit ridiculous - the chunks of bleu cheese were so large that three of them took up the whole serving cup. I guess that's maybe better than undetectable amounts of cheese?  Shortly before the meatballs arrived we were also given a bread basket - the bread was soft and warm and sadly taken away when a bus boy cleared our other plates. Our server brought us another basket, though, which we stuffed in our to-go boxes later.  For entrees the BF got Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and I had the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club. I was bummed to find out that they don't offer the Navajo Chicken Sandwich but this was fairly close in ingredients minus the bread choice. I ordered it with cheddar instead of Swiss, and when it arrived our server asked me if it had the correct cheese. I poked around and couldn't see where it was in the monster sandwich and then we determined there was no cheese at all. Brianna was kind and apologetic and offered to take it back to the kitchen and I said that it wasn't a big deal - it's more that I don't like Swiss than that I wanted the cheddar.  The sandwich itself was really, really good. Flavorful, perfectly toasted, fresh veggies, crispy bacon. It's a towering beast - it was about four inches in height and required a good deal of smushing to get a solid bite. No complaints, though - I made three meals of the sandwich with the fries that accompanied it and the bread.  The unfortunate thing is that the sandwich comes in at 1400 calories. I don't know what they do to it - grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado on bread shouldn't be that bad for you. There's a similar sandwich at Panera where the only major difference is that it's turkey instead of chicken that is 500 calories. Even if they used two full tablespoons of butter to grill the bread it wouldn't nearly triple the calorie count. If the fries were included that'd make slightly more sense, but they're listed separately on the nutrition chart so I kind of think not. Woof. Both of us were stuffed so we opted out of ordering dessert (also...$8 for cheesecake that I imagine is mass-produced somewhere is a bit steep), but the selections in the case looked good.  The food and service on our visit was good. The price and calorie count, not so much. We'll most likely be back at some point, but if we'd have had poor service I probably wouldn't feel the need to return."
Fan W.,"Madison, WI",2,14,9,2.0,9/25/2016,"The shrimp with angel hair was just like home-made paste by cooking with vegan pasta sauce. The flavor in sauce and in noodles are not well combined.  The low carb cheesecake was using Splenda to replace regular sugar, while the Splenda has wired aftertaste.  And everything is really OVERPRICED!!!!!"
Chy R.,"Madison, WI",954,474,1486,3.0,11/30/2015,"5:00 pm Our party of 4 arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, located across from Sephora at West Town Mall. Was handed a buzzer and told the wait time was around 30 min.  5:15 pm Pleasantly surprised to feel the buzzer going off. We walked back and waited as instructed on the side of the hostess desk to be seated. We were greeted by our hostess and proceeded to follow her to the exterior dining patio area only to see the table bestowed on us was not cleared off and therefore not ready. We marched back to where the hostesses converge and given another buzzer on a cusp promise of a short wait. 5:20 pm We were herded to our real table now, conveniently 10 feet from the hostess beehive and in front of the Cheesecake counter area of the restaurant. 5:25 pm Our server appears along with another gentleman whom I cannot distinguish between a manager or a server-in-training. We were given menus and drink orders (three waters and an ice tea) taken. 5:30 pm Our drinks appear and we are asked if we would like their complimentary bread basket. We are agreeable. Our group ordered the Clam chowder soup of the day as well as the mini corn dogs to start. 5:45 pm Our orders are jotted and bread basket are served. We received two baskets of a crusty sourdough and a soft dark bread, which tasted like a honey wheat brown bread, this was the star in our group.  5:55 pm We asked for refills for both the drinks and bread. Our soup and mini corn dogs arrive. The corn dogs was one-length hot dog at one time, cut into four sections, dipped in cornmeal batter and fried to perfection. Strangely this was served with mustard and it took another couple of minutes to try to flag a waitstaff (not ours) down for ketchup. The chowder was delicious, meaty pieces of clam and potatoes in a thick, creamy base. 6:25 pm As we waited with baited breath, a woman in a black blazer comes to our table to reassure us that she saw our food and it will arrive ""within a couple of minutes"". 6:40 pm Three of the four entrees grace our table. We are given a promise that the fourth entree, Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi would be arriving shortly. Alas! The fourth arrives three minutes later. The Chipotle Chicken Pasta was strangely sweet, it had an aftertaste of chipotle, but was otherwise not spicy as the menu indicated. There were sufficient amount of chicken, that was again strangely soft, almost too tender. Two people ordered the Steak Diane, one as the meal and one as a combination with shrimp scampi. This was a standout in our group. Succulent, flavorful, medallions of Angus beef steak were bathed in black peppercorns and a rich mushroom wine sauce. It was perfectly smothered in caramelized onions and baby portobello and shiitake mushrooms. Both arrived with mashed baby lusciously lumpy red potatoes. The shrimp scampi were not what we had in mind, as lightly sauté minimalist. Instead these were almost breaded and pan fried. I am not complaining, but again, just strange as expectations from the menu described as sautéed did not meet reality.  Another solid dish was their Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo. It came with Andouille sausage, juicy chunks of tomato, diced peppers, onions, and garlic, topped with a generous portion of white rice. I am having a hard time reconciling with the chicken, it's again a little too rubbery for me. I did appreciate the medium sized peeled and deveined shrimp.  7:15 pm We asked for a to-go box and the cheesecake menu (the variety is over a pages long). Since we were familiar with the pace of service, we asked for the bill as well. 7:20 pm The bill and boxes arrive, but no cheesecake menu. In hindsight, we could have just grabbed one ourselves, being seated so close to the hostess podium. However, in our mode of glutton, we simply could not be motivated to do so. 7:25 pm We flagged another waitress and she handed us a menu. I wonder if she saw the disparity in our eyes, as we metaphorically clung to her. We decided on the Sea Salt Caramel ($7.95).  7:30 pm Again, we are seated in front of the pre-made, cheesecake variety display. We were once again told that our cheesecake is coming while nothing appeared in front of us. 7:35 pm The cheesecake makes its appearance like an overzealous celebrity. It's what you dreamed of seeing, you have great expectations of this individual, you clearly overpaid for the privilege of experiencing this event live, but it disappoints you and even annoy you a bit by arriving late and have the appearance of their bad, ugly, meme. The cheesecake was the frozen version of what you can get at Sam's, but on steroids, if steroids were a layer of condensed cake underneath the cheesecake.  As you can see it took well over 2 hours for the entire dinner.There were no adjustments to our bill for the tardy service nor any acknowledgement of the room temp Steak Diane, all in all, it was $104 for four people before tip.  We came, we conquered, and the hype defeated us."
Julie S.,"Cottage Grove, WI",10,9,4,2.0,2/12/2017,"I had cheesecake before and it is delicious! However dining here today for the first time was not so great. We watched several tables get their food before us even though we arrived before them. When our food did arrive, I asked the waitress what was the holdup. She admitted that she had forgot to put our order in.  Egads!  We had already been waiting 45 minutes during a not so particularly busy time. When are bill came, I expected to see a small discount or similar due to her error that she admitted to. But no. The food was fine for the most part, a little on the pricey side for what it was. I just don't see what all the excitement is about of this place."
Alan K.,"Madison, WI",89,107,360,4.0,6/24/2016,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory location. I typically try hard to avoid restaurants in shopping malls. But today, I figured life is short so wanted to give it a go to expand my horizons.  We enjoyed it pretty well.  This location is in West Town Mall. It faces the parking lot so there is plenty of parking and big signs to identify and where to enter the restaurant.  I was surprised at how beautiful the restaurant is. It is upscale'ish with white linens but casual. They have outdoor seating, a very nice bar area and a variety of different types of tables. We were greeted and seated promptly by our hostess and our waitress followed close behind. We were there for lunch and the menu given to us was  large and extensive.  Nice! Another nice touch was a basket of warm sourdough and whole wheat bread which came out with our drink order.  Being my first visit, and still being on a quest for the best burger in town, I had to order their standard cheeseburger and fries as a litmus test.  Dining partner had a Cuban sandwich. Frankly, I was not expecting much figuring everything must come out of the back of a Sysco truck. But I was pleasantly surprised. My burger seem to be hand formed, was cooked to my requested medium doneness, and served on a sourdough baguette with grilled onions and tomato.  The beef could have been seasoned more but it did taste fresh. The onions were cooked perfectly and the sourdough bread toasted just right. The fries were very good as well.  All told, it was pretty good.   I am told that the Cuban sandwich was also very good, with the pickle within it being of particular mention.  For the prices, our entrées were smaller than would be expected.  We had to try a piece of cheesecake. As expected, their cheesecake selection is extensive. We went with the banana cream cheesecake which was also very good. (Note - - they have a bakery area where you can purchase baked goods to go).  A nicely sliced banana garnished the cheesecake. I was impressed that the banana was perfectly sliced and perfectly ripe. Neither over nor underripe.  I give them credit for that attention to detail. Good for them! It is appreciated.  Our lunch entrées were about $13 each.  Little high for a burger and sandwich here in Madison. Although the food quality was strong, I'm not convinced it was quite proportionate to the cost per Madison standards. For our entrées, one slice of cheesecake and one soft drink, our bill was about $40, before tax and tip. The space is beautiful, clean, with friendly and helpful staff.  For me, a nice place to bring my mom or grandma for lunch or if I was from out of town and needed a safe and solid bet for good food in a relaxed but upscale'ish setting.  As mentioned, I don't expect much from restaurants in shopping malls. But today I was pleasantly surprised and I'm indeed  better for it.  Now that I'm on a roll, on to The Red Lobster (ahem)!   For what it is, a strong Yelp four stars. See you there!"
Junie K.,"Madison, WI",26,15,8,5.0,3/29/2017,The service was wonderful on a recent busy Sat. We went a little before lunch and brunch on a Sun. It was the best crab cake I have had in a very long. Superb!
Kris D.,"Madison, WI",48,85,117,4.0,6/12/2016,"For me, The Cheesecake Factory works.  I like the big menu though I tend to stick to a few favorites.  The food is always impressive and delicious.  Yes, it is a little pricey and corporate is probably raking in a tidy sum, but I generally love eating out and the high prices just means I won't be here quite as much, but I will make the pilgrimage a few times a year. People talk about the high calorie entrees, but the ""Skinny-licious"" menu solves all this.  I usually order off of that menu to either save room for dessert or because I'm watching my calories and I have never been disappointed.  Everything I've ordered off that menu is excellent  and I can't believe I'm eating a low-cal meal. Also enjoy the bread basket -- the darker bread (rye/pumpernickel?) rocks.  The standard bread is good, but not as much as the other in my opinion. I'm sure it's no surprise to anyone that the cheesecake selection is impressive.  When we do treat ourselves, one slice for the two of us is all we need.  Yummy!"
John G.,"Madison, WI",27,139,75,2.0,4/22/2016,"Hmm, I've heard really good things about this chain from people I trust, but I am not buying what they're selling.  I went to the Bayshore Mall Milwaukee location and now this new one in Madison, and experiences were pretty similar. I'll be straight-forward, this restaurant just seems like an overpriced mess of dishes with little to no direction on the overall experience.  Walking in, they clearly had way too many employees, as most of them were standing around talking to each other or walking right by tables that needed attention but for some reason weren't getting it. Thankfully our personal server was extremely friendly and also quite helpful (I believe his name was Jeremiah).  My Dad and I had no idea what to order as we paged through their Tom Clancy sized novel of a menu, but he had 4-5 recommendations that all sounded up our alley and answered questions as they came.  I settled on the Teriyaki Chicken for a whopping $17.  It was tasty and the portion size was agreeably large.  I think for that amount of money I'd rather be wowed a bit, but I can't complain too much because I did still enjoy the dish.  Complimentary bread was also noice, and overall made up for the bizarro-land atmosphere inside and equally crazy menu. I think this might be the spot to go for large groups where you have potentially picky eaters, as there's no way someone will go hungry, but I'd be hard pressed to find another excuse.  Maybe I'm being too harsh as the food is reasonable (and was so in Milwaukee too) but I'd like to see them do something with the open space and show a bit more attentiveness to the tables as a whole (again, not our server but in general).  It's early in the going for them though, so time will tell. . ."
Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",308,1266,1214,4.0,3/10/2016,"I have always been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory. The sheer variety- I love. So many things to choose from and so many good things.  The lovely host that seated us came out with a little snack for our toddler. I thought that was so nice and thoughtful. Maybe they do that all the time. Either way, nice touch. Food ordered: Kids pizza- pretty good size for kids size Chinese Chicken Salad- yum! Huge and tasted great. One of my favorite salads. Shrimp Bang Bang ( or something like that) pasta. Service was excellent. Kind of surprised at the low ratings. No wait which was nice compared to the one closer to our home which always has a wait no matter the time."
David B.,"Oak Creek, WI",29,154,5,5.0,4/5/2017,"First timer! What a great restaurant, food and service was perfect. I had the Pit Beef Dip, just excellent. Of course I had to try the cheesecake, not bad at all. What a great experience"
Ri M.,"Madison, WI",6,61,100,4.0,7/5/2016,"I have been many times at the Cheesecake Factory and what can I say? I would come back anytime babeee ;) I have tried many dishes and they all have been tasty, well seasoned and had satisfied my dear tummy.  Portions tend to be large and in case you are not that hungry, you can always get something from their lunch menu (served until 5:00pm) and they have a nice variety of dishes.  My favorite ones, tan taaann: * The old fashioned burger, nicely charred and very tasty! * Shrimp with Angel hair (I switch it for Penne pasta, personal preference) great fresh taste with lots of crushed tomatoes, lemon, garlic and a touch of basil and thyme.  * The grilled Salmon is always flaky and delicious! One of my top favorites :) it comes with mashed potatoes and broccoli but you can have other sides upon request. I like the mashed potatoes, carrots and green beans, I think the broccoli is very bland.  I also discovered a cocktail that I shouldn't have asked for! The reason? I fell in love with it but it's expensive, $10.50 :( it's called Ruby red crush (Vodka, lime, grapefruit juice, St Germain), it was a little bit strong, but so delicate made, I could taste every single ingredient and so perfect for summertime!  Service has always been good and I appreciate that. For me, the Cheesecake Factory is part of the the restaurant list that my boyfriend and I like to visit, yes, you guessed right, the one we always fight for because it's hard to choose from! Even though we all know the Queen of the house it's the one who says the last word ;)"
Tara Z.,"Madison, WI",6,18,13,3.0,5/8/2016,"We went here with a large group for my brother-in-law's birthday. We arrived around 1:30 & left around 4. I walked in the hostess desk had just cleared of customers and the one hostess did not ask what I needed, I was ignored. Two groups came through the mall entrance and she spoke with them. A woman customer behind me asked if I had been helped and I replied no. A minute later another hostess arrived and offered to help me, then a third hostess arrived and seemed puzzled. It appeared no one but us was waiting, after 50 or more minutes of waiting we were seated. Drink orders were taken promptly, alcohol arrived first, water took 5 minutes, soda, coffee, and tea arrived 20 minutes after sitting. Tables were small 2-4 top tables.  The server did not ask of we were ready to order, she rushed off. There was a lot of waiting. The portions were very large.  The Childrens Mac and cheese should have included a smaller portion of noodles & a large side of veggies. It needed less salt, no parmesan cheese, and no cheese chunks inside the noodles. This child whose favorite order is Mac could not stomach the mac. (Win for mom, got to share some delicious salmon, rice, and broccoli) The kids mini corn dogs arrived with 3 corn dogs and an adult portion of extra salty fries. The corn dogs dos not classify as mini they were shorter and fatter but the same amount of food as one normal corn dog. The dog inside was greasy, and disgusting but 2 of the 3 were eaten by the child who ordered. My sister and I both selected salmon from the lunch menu, priced about $15. My sister chose the herb crusted, accompanied by mashed potatoes and 4 sprigs of asparagus. The salmon which looked like a patty was on a mountain of mashed potatoes. She enjoyed the salmon, the rest was okay. My grilled salmon lunch portion had an accompaniment of mashed potatoes and broccoli. The potatoes could be traded out for brown rice, the veggies could be replaced for an up-charge. The platter it arrived on was full, half or more of rice 4-6 servings of rice. Less than a full serving of broccoli unlike the asparagus I received more than 4 flowerettes. And a good size, well seasoned salmon steak. I enjoyed the cooked broccoli and brown rice. For information purposes  it was not seasoned at all. My brother-in-law orders the Philly cheese steak & fries finishing half.  My father ordered the Cobb salad which should be equal portions of different toppings. It was a shredded lettuce salad with some tomato, some cheese, a few scraps of meat, and a chunk of avocado. They state tossed but they do not state the ingredient portions aren't equal. -not a Cobb salad. My uncle ordered the jambalaya which was in a very large dish as well. The flavors were great, a bit of a bite to it. My one complaint is that I didn't expect it to have oil in it. Everything in the dish was covered with an oily film. The lemon drop Martini was addictive  The regular coffee was good, I wouldn't visit for the coffee though. The decaf coffee was quite bitter, it's flavor was a bit unpleasant. I could only drink the water after eating, it had an aroma of chlorine and tasted odd. Some flavors were spot on, portions were odd, ingredients were odd. Salmon & mashed potatoes for lunch. 4 sprigs of asparagus. Jambalaya in oil. Cobb salad 90% shredded lettuce. Kids mac loaded in cheddar, parmesan, and added salt with no veggie. 3 giant kids ""mini"" corn dogs with an adult sized fry no veggie option. Half a plate of rice.   We requested one Childrens Hot fudge sundae which was, not brought out, then after the bill was given we had a sad kiddo, requested it again as the bill was being paid, when it arrived it was enough for 2-3 children. Loaded with whipped cream. Lots of waiting. Food was placed in front of the wrong people (by people helping our server) The server was well informed of the menu and options and pleasant. More pleasant than the 3 hostesses.  **Three stars because if I were eating anything but my meal I would have been disappointed. But my food was good and the server was pleasant and able to answer my questions. This helped me receive something satisfying for my taste.**"
Tim C.,"Madison, WI",0,30,9,4.0,6/29/2017,"Okay let's get on my tinsy winsy soap box for a moment.  My guess as to some of the low star reviews for the CheeseCake Factory at the WestTowne Mall in Madison, Wis. is related to trained labor or shortages of same.  In 2017 almost all service jobs in this city have help wanted signs out and this for a while.   Also I'd have to say if there is turn over at any restaurant almost anywhere in USA that compensation is directly associated as the main factor. IMO.  If you have seen my other reviews I've mentioned the compensation methods of USA wait staffs everywhere is the target reason for turnover.  Even restaurants get what they pay for.  Okay, off soap box now.   - - - - - - - - - - Begin review - - - - - - - - -  As the Shopping Mall era keeps setting into the sunset in lieu of the big online phenomena, I could make a case that restaurants like the Cheesecake factory are evolving into the new anchor stores, I mean the others all seem to be singing Anchors Aweigh.  So if an old guy like me will go to a mall for the Cheesecake Factory it's got to be a good reason.  Duhhh.  Even though our Factory here in Madison seems more marketed to women, I don't mind a bit, I can coffee and chit chat too, even order off the ' Skinnylicious ' menu, speaking of menus I also don't mind the main menu being a Book!, It's called selection.  (If you think I'm overdoing the dead mall syndrome, check out Dan Bell and his Youtube series ' Dead Mall Series ', yes people, it's a thing.)  - - - - - - - - - - - So, my fav dish was the Thai Salmon with rice (extra butter, Hey! this is Wis. and the place is called ' CheeseCake --- ', so don't go there!) tasty sauce and nicely done veggies of the Asian style flavors, Oh, just--love--that--dish!  Unfortunately our CCFactory has discontinued that particular salmon dish, (almost always ordered that dish) but there are several others with similar fixins and making your own construction is allowed, and, will mention here, if things go wrong, you tell them about it and it should or will be fixed NOW.    So this allowed me to order special salads which I also have enjoyed.  The coffee is okay, not great but not bad either, seems restaurants have trouble keeping great coffee on request, so this is another plus for CCF.  Need I mention the desserts or complete takeout desserts since usually can't stuff any more in the pie hole by end of entré time.  So the CCF being right in a mall can also be handy for any kind of other errands nearby.  Confession: When we travel across country we keep running into Starbucks and Cheesecake factories, just seems to keep happening.  I blame it on the internet.   Others seem unimpressed (millennials?) with this cheesecake factory, I'll blame that on the general lowered expectations of younger generations who don't know what to make of excess when they see it.  Having choices and enjoying same is a real adventure, but considering the future picture of USA, I can see them being depressed and unable to enjoy a restaurant style that is disappearing quickly in this newer age.  To me the Cheesecake Factory is a blast from the past to be enjoyed, and for a mall, a destination."
Lifan Y.,"Madison, WI",2,12,32,4.0,6/6/2017,"I give it 4 stars not due to its delicious foods (actually, they are just so-so, especially for its free bread) but it is the place where the man I love becomes my boyfriend. We ate together, shared interesting stories in the past and spent a very good night there. We ordered Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta, Filet Mignon, Clam Chowder Soup and 100% Fresh Orange Juice. This place witnessed a very important moment in my life."
Mag F.,"Winter Park, FL",0,4,8,5.0,12/29/2016,"I went there yesterday with my boyfriend. It was nice except the wait time. The bread is good, my boyfriend order chicken and I order angel hair with garlic cream sauce.  And I had red velvet cheese cake. I like the experience"
Tyler W.,"Stevens Point, WI",117,37,30,5.0,6/30/2016,"This was my first time going to a Cheesecake Factory, and I was impressed! I was just by myself, but I ordered the hot spinach and cheese dip as my appetizer and it was enough to feed 2 people. I had the fresh Grilled Salmon for my entree, that came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. This dish was equally as delicious. For dessert I, of course had cheesecake, which is obviously a signature menu item for the Cheesecake Factory, and one of my personal favorite desserts. I ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme cheesecake, is wow! was this delicious! I love cheese cake, and Oreos, and this was great! All of the dishes where well priced, and she sizes of the dishes were huge, and definitely enough to feed two people. I ended up taking some leftovers from each dish home with me. My waitress, Heidi was nice, and was there when I needed her. When it was time or me to go, she put my leftovers in take-home containers and presented my with my bill. I certainly enjoyed coming here to eat, and will dine here again!"
Joshua J.,"Panama City Beach, FL",34,244,259,2.0,2/20/2016,"Probably not going there again. Prices are high but the food is hit or miss and there is always a wait.  The veggie burger I got was probably one of the best I've had and considering I'm a vegetarian - that is a high priority. The appetizer with the deep fried vegetable variety was quite good! I never thought deep fried avocado could be so good. Unfortunately the next time I visited, they happened to not have Veggie burgers. On the fly I picked an Omelette and was fairly bored despite it having usual goto ingredients. Honestly, missing such a severe ingredient was a real let down considering the wait to get in and seated."
Cameron M.,"Madison, WI",4,24,1,1.0,6/3/2017,"Ugh.  Why?  When Madison is full of so many great restaurants, why are you here to lure and disappoint, Cheesecake Factory?"
Jae M.,"Madison, WI",45,164,119,4.0,3/11/2016,"I was really happy finding out that they were opening a Cheesecake Factory in Madison. Being from CA, having this built made me feel super nostalgic. I've been to the Milwaukee location but too far for a casual last minute dinner decision.  Anyway, been at this location a few times, but our most memorable visit was a few nights ago when we celebrated my husband's and father-in-law's birthdays.  Dana was our server. She started off a little MIA (had to ask other servers for water refills and straws) but as the night went on, she was more attentive. My husband ordered the shepherd's pie and to all our surprise, it looked really greasy. He ordered his usual BBQ smokehouse burger cooked to perfection and was much happier with his choice.  Out of nowhere, the manager (Quinn) came by to ask us how we were doing and to make sure my husband was satisfied with his meal. His words were: ""I wanted to make sure you leave happy."" The gesture was much appreciated and very genuine. We definitely appreciated the service and the acknowledgement of our dissatisfaction."
Gemma B.,"Fitchburg, WI",48,63,23,3.0,7/25/2016,"I'd like to start off by saying this location is far better than the location in Schaumburg.  So that's out of the way. Their menu is huge. Ridiculously so. That has its ups and downs. It takes you a bit to decide on what you actually want to order, but there's probably something for everyone with a wide range of selection. Normally on a huge menu, quality suffers, but I don't really feel like that's an issue here. The issue is getting orders right. That being said, it would be nice if they'd pick a genre and stick with it.  The items on the menu are super caloric and they are a bit overpriced. I exclusively order from the Skinnylicious menu at this point, but it's been hit or miss. I love love love their Ahi Tartare. I've tried other items off of that menu with mixed results. I find some of the dishes, while low in calories, have a super high sodium content. I do recommend that tartare though. It's fresh and awesome.  The problem areas with this restaurant tend to be the staff and the kitchen. The staff is always super friendly, but they're also very busy so service can suffer there. I've also had issues with making special requests, and the server getting it wrong. (I'm not pretentious, I have an allergy). When the servers aren't overwhelmed and making mistakes because of it, the kitchen picks up that mantle. As much as I love that tartare it has come out differently every time I've ordered it. It's got very few things involved on it, so you'd think replicating iy roughly the same each time would be easy.  I'd love to talk about the cheesecake, but it's really hard for me to find any that doesn't have nuts in it. The two times I have ordered any, there was some confusion about it having nuts or not. So I'm not the person to ask about that.  Overall, it's not a bad place, but it's also not great. It makes a good lunch date spot to save on cost."
Rob L.,"Chicago, IL",39,7,,1.0,2/2/2017,"My family and I LOVE this chain.  We have visited many locations and were very excited when we found out that Madison would be opening one.  We have gone about 3-4 times since it's opened and have been so disappointed each time. The food is not good...you would think that since it is a chain the food should taste exactly the same at each restaurant.  Every time we have visited this location the food has been bland and just ""off"".  Another reason I am only leaving one star is that the customer service (or lack there of) has been awful.  Even when the restaurant is empty the service has been slow.  The worst experience that we had when eating here was when we came in for an early dinner (5pm) and didn't receive our food until almost 6!  The place was empty so there was absolutely no reason that the food should have been that delayed.  On top of that, our waitress forgot to put in one item from our order.  We complained to the manager and he offered NO apology...simply gave a fake smile and nodded.  Perhaps he wasn't paying attention because he was too busy socializing with the gals up front so he couldn't be bothered to hear us out. We will not be returning to this location as the service is awful, food is mediocre (at best), and management obviously does not care..."
