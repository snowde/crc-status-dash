Laura H.,"Cottage Grove, WI",2,12,,1.0,12/8/2015,"Giving 1 star because it won't let me give less! Arrived here Tuesday  at 430pm. 2 adults and a 5 year old.  Our server started out friendly, then everything went downhill. She took our order, brought some bread. We had to ask 3 times to get my daughter's drink. The food came out and an expediter tried to give my daughter salmon, I told her that we ordered grilled chicken for the chilc. So she shoved the plate at me again and said, OH yes, this is the chicken.  I looked at it and said, no, it isn't,  that is salmon. You were right the first time, but it is still not what we ordered. Another person sat my steak in front of me and a dish of mashed potatoes.  They took my daughters food back to try again. My husbands food came with a 3rd person about 5 minutes later. My potatoes were cold, steak was close to the doneness that I had ordered. The server took the potatoes to get fresh. Then they returned with my daughters plate, which now had a 1x2 inch piece of grilled chicken that was about 1/4 inch thick and had clearly been cut from another piece. So we had ordered grilled chicken, broccoli and fries. She got chicken, broccoli and carrots. Veggies were ice cold. Eventually my potatoes came back hot on top and cold inside.  Both hubby and I had ordered the ribs eyes but we're not given knives to cut it with. Hubby's fries were cold as well.  Server said she was sorry and would get a manager. After 10 minutes waiting on manager to come, hubby got up to find one.... Jeremy, a manager, came back to the table with him and we explained the debacle that had been our meal so far. He asked us what we wanted him to do!!! He said he would take off the kids meal and some other things to make it right. When the bill came, he had comped the children's meal and nothing else.  They can forget us ever returning to this place.  I did not expect the entire meal to be comped but good lord, this place is a mess."
Rosa A.,"Madison, WI",1,9,,2.0,3/2/2016,"So I FINALLY got to eat here.... We were on the Westside of town and so we decided to drop in... We had a late lunch earlier so we weren't extremely hungry. We went on a Sunday at 615- so right after mall closed. There were no available seats inside so we sat in the exterior seating which is in the mall. Our service was ridiculous. Took forever for everything and it wasn't even that basin our section. I ordered a drink (typhoon) it was mostly juice and cute fruit. I was surprised to see it was $10.50 when the bill got there. My husband and son both ordered a slice of cheesecake. Then my other son ordered kids pasta.... I ordered the buffalo chicken blasts- they were good, once I finally got the ranch I asked for instead of blue cheese when I ordered it. The bill was over $50, so id say it was definitely steep. Our service was a 3.5 on a scale 1-10.... Yea not great."
Jesse D.,"Madison, WI",4,1,,1.0,12/20/2015,The food was good but not enough to overcome the painfully slow service. It took an hour and forty-five minutes at the table to finish the meal. The server spent time chatting with other servers while we waited for the check. The manager did not apologize when we brought this to his attention.
Dan J.,"Madison, WI",5,21,1,4.0,3/16/2016,"What's not to love about this place? I mean seriously, it's a factory that produces cheesecake! We love it!!"
Kyara M.,"Austin, TX",53,143,151,3.0,1/17/2016,"Visited a close friend and her husband for dinner on a Tuesday. Service and food was MUCH improved from the first time. Bit turned off at the fact that ginger ale was $3, however. Seems very steep for a Pepsi product in a chain restaurant. They are improving which is good! The verdict is still out on this CCF."
Sarah M.,"Madison, WI",29,77,42,5.0,12/14/2015,"I have gone here twice with my girlfriend, the first time we went was on a Wednesday night around 9:30pm it seemed busy but we were seated right away, we went again last Saturday around 1:30pm and there was a 40 minute wait but they give you a buzzer so you can walk around the mall, that was really nice.. The wait didn't seem that long since we were able to window shop! (Did you know they still make tamagotchi!? They sell them at Hot topic!) OK back to the review! The service both times were great! The drinks are great! The food is fabulous.. We always get the factory combinations and have had the chicken madeira, steak diane, and the herb crusted salmon.. all of which were amazing! Our favorite is the steak diane, we get it medium-rare and it's so tender it almost melts in your mouth! This will definitely be our go to place for dates."
Kevin B.,"Spring Green, WI",5,1,,2.0,12/20/2015,"Sitting here 45 minutes waiting on a burger and a beef sandwich for my wife. So glad was not really hungry. Food well prepared but getting it is the biggest joke. Plenty of wait staff. Then to hear dishes and glasses crashing to the ground not once but twice. Makes one wonder ""why did I come here""? So think for service and timely food it needs only 2 stars."
Jeff W.,"Ankeny, IA",0,27,,3.0,2/11/2016,"Great food, bad service. Very slow to get food and both entrees were wrong after 40 minutes. Manager did nothing to correct the situation. If we go back it will just be for take-out cheesecake."
Sandy R.,"Madison, WI",0,10,,3.0,3/15/2016,It's The Cheesecake Factory. Good food. Almost too many options. Great staff.  A tad overpriced. But the Penny factor is enough for me.
Elise M.,"SC, SC",13,22,12,1.0,1/6/2016,If I could give less than 1 star I would.  The first attempt at a meal tasted like cardboard with slop and soggy mushrooms on it...it was supposed to be chicken picatta.  Attempt #2. Steak tacos that while barely edible came with a side of crunchy Green rice- that was not edible.  Both attempts took FOREVER.  Service completely SUCKED.  Manager was polite but not effective in speeding replacement meal along.  So after nearly 2 hours I will just grab a McDonald's and call it a night.  #No Good. #Don'T bother. #SaveYourselfTheHassel
Tracie H.,"Columbus, WI",0,10,,2.0,1/9/2016,95 minute wait...they don't take reservations on Saturday nights. Food is typical to the chain.  Another location I went to was a much better experience. Best advice get food to go unless you have a lot to shop.for in the mall
Joseph M.,"Janesville, WI",108,1,,1.0,5/31/2016,"To Whom It May Concern: On a day trip to Madison, my family and I decided to give your restaurant a chance.  Upon walking in from a day of shopping, we noticed the ambiance, wonderful lighting, seating area, comfortable temperature, and what appeared to be the start of a great experience.  The experience we foresaw, was not what we received with the quality of the food/drinks.  We began by ordering a signature $10.50 Mimosa and a Summer Shandy to enjoy on a hot spring Memorial Day.  Memorial, the experience was, but for the wrong reasons.  The drink my fiance ordered was disturbingly nauseating right from the beginning.  We quickly flagged down someone of the staff (not our waitress) and explained that the taste was unappetizing and quickly requested a white wine beverage, which we were immediately deterred from getting.  In turn, (our non server) mentioned there was too much Almond Syrup in the previous concoction.  My fiance agreed to try it again.  To her dismay, the beverage still had a funky taste to it, which was disheartening.  Upon leaving a full beverage behind after we were told that it would be removed from our bill, it was not.  Also, I had ordered fish tacos for my meal.  The fish was requested grilled.  Other than the ends and bottom portions of the fish being charred beyond my teethes ability to chew, I too, could not finish my meal.  My daughters Chicken Quesadilla was perfect and edible.  My fiances chicken tacos were mediocre, there was an abundance of cilantro on the rice, which made it difficult for her to eat.  As we decided to get ready to leave, my fiance decided to order some cheesecake and a piece of chocolate cake, as we sat right next to the desert bar, we simply couldn't resist.  Upon leaving we were faced with our final straw at the ""Cheesecake Factory"".  We found a brown (not blonde as my fiance's) hair intertwined in the chocolate cake.  This is my fiances second visit to a Cheesecake Factory and it was my first and our last visit. With a whopping $80 bill, I made sure to tip our server (who was not around for most of the serving) $12.00 to ensure she was at least taken care of for her troubles.   Thank you,"
Terri W.,"Seward, NE",0,34,,3.0,12/30/2015,"We usually go to the Cheesecake Factory in Omaha Nebraska so this review is in comparison to that location.  The luau salad was good, the fried fish dinner was bland needed some seasoning. The fries have little or no salt and needed some seasoning.' Our server was excellent. This location has not been open very long, so perhaps Quality will get better over time The long wait was not worth it for this location."
Jenny J.,"Madison, WI",13,4,7,5.0,1/13/2016,I will definitely go back to the Cheesecake Factory . The service was great and the food was even better. My boyfriend got the meatloaf and he said it was the best meatloaf he has ever eaten and I got the three cheese pasta and that was amazing. It was really worth the money!
Apro R.,"Madison, WI",0,5,,4.0,2/1/2016,"The food was delicious and served quickly, which was a big deal since the restaurant was packed! It's a lively atmosphere with dim lighting but definitely a fun place to celebrate with friends. Our waitress was especially helpful when she recommended we order our cheesecake during the meal since the high demand for cake was causing a 20 minute delay. Plan to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour since reservations cannot be made. It would be wonderful if the restaurant would text customers when their table is ready since the buzzers don't work outside the restaurant and some people prefer to shop in the mall while waiting."
Melanie H.,"Madison, WI",0,4,,1.0,7/29/2016,Dissapointing. Food took way too long. Server could care less if we were there or not. Food alopped on the plate. Not a usual experience with this Chain. Madison Cheesecake needs to step it up.
R S.,"Madison, WI",1,2,,3.0,2/9/2016,"Great food but slow service.. As other Cheesecake Factory locations, this one was super busy too."
Katherine G.,"Milton, WI",12,36,20,3.0,1/28/2016,"The hostesses  at this location were absolutely terrible, but our fantastic server made up for it. She was very energetic and was on top of topping of beverages and such. Their serving sizes are ridiculous,  so if you don't like leftovers, order the lunch portion. I was also disappointed that a Virgin Strawberry Daiquiri was the same price as an alcoholic one, but oh well."
Megan J.,"Chicago, IL",5,2,,2.0,1/1/2016,"Wait was shorter than expected but service was disappointing. Salad entree was served missing ingredients, ordered cheesecake to go and they gave me the wrong one (but I paid for the more expensive one) and they never brought plastic forks requested."
Emily B.,"Fitchburg, WI",56,1,,2.0,12/17/2015,"I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo, but when my plate arrived the pasta and sauce were lukewarm and the pasta was clumped together. It was clear that it was not freshly made. I asked the waiter to re-make it, which they did."
