Stephanie C.,"Madison, WI",0,12,,2.0,1/3/2016,"I'm sorry to echo what other reviewers are saying about the initial quality of this Cheesecake Factory. We had an early dinner (3:00pm) on a Sunday. The hostess was bossy, clicking her long nails on the counter to tell us where to stand while we waited to be seated. The server was friendly, but forgot to give us a napkin and the service was so slow. The food was fine but they need to iron out their act."
Mike M.,"Sun Prairie, WI",0,6,,1.0,11/29/2015,"Poorly trained staff, rude management. An hour and half later thank god Chick-Fil-et is across the street."
Dan G.,"Baraboo, WI",0,4,,2.0,2/16/2016,"This place can't seem to put it together. Despite many positive experiences around the country at other locations this one can't put it together. This was my 3rd try here. The first two ended up with conversations with the manager. This experience started with a long wait to be acknowledged, bread delivered with no plates or utensils, substitutions on entrees were noted but missed. No attention to detail at all but our waitress seemed to have loads of time to talk with coworkers at a nearby work station. Food was good as usual but I have now given up on this place. Too many good choices in Madison."
Chris B.,"McFarland, WI",0,3,,4.0,7/7/2016,We visited the Cheesecake Factory for the first time today for lunch.  Our food was excellent and very generous portions.  The cost was slightly higher than some other similar restaurants but the taste of the food and portion size made up for it.  The service was excellent although the preparers of the food seemed slow.
Nhia E.,"Madison, WI",435,3,,5.0,12/17/2015,I absolutely love this place! The food is great! Their cheesecake is delicious and mouth watering. The staff is amazing! My favorite part of this place along with mine and my husbands experience is a waiter name Adam Cooley! He is a great catch! I can tell he really enjoys what he does and was so on point with everything. Adam made our experience the best experience ever since it was my husbands first time at any cheesecake factory. Adam took the best care of us and we will come more to see him.
Ben G.,"Middleton, WI",0,4,,1.0,1/31/2016,"An overpriced meal from chef Mike (Microwave). We had a the fried cheese, and stuffed mushroom appetizers. Then a club sandwich and french dip for entrees. And we each snagged a piece of cheesecake togo (Strawberry and dulce de leche). Positives:  - My wife enjoyed her Strawberry cheesecake  - We wound up being two people at a booth meant for six. Was kinda nice having a bit more personal space, considering how crowded and busy the place was. Negatives:  - Bit of a wait to get seated (25-30 min), but it was busy so I can't fault them for that. However I had a follow-up question after talking to the hostess and she decided to talk to a waiter about his day for 15 minutes instead of turn her head and help answer my question. Luckily a waitress came by and helped me out.  - The place was packed and the seating is done in such a way that made me feel like I was one sardine in a can. The big booth we got seated in helped out, but it was unfortunately right next to a server station, so the traffic right outside my booth was fast and plenty. Getting seated and leaving that spot made me feel like a cyclist in L.A. traffic.  - The appetizers were microwave meals. The mushrooms were a rubbery, bland, solid mass. The fried cheese was bland and the marinara dipping sauce was watery soup.  - The club was a bland stack covered in miracle whip.  - The french dip came with a shot glass amount of dip and the beef was about as low grade as you could get. Tearing threw the fat and sinew with my teeth turned my meal into a challenge.  - The fries had no seasoning and came to us about 15 minutes after our entrees got there.  - My dulce de leche cheesecake was a bit of a sad, bland mess as well. If you think about it, when you boast over 250 menu items, how would you expect a chef to be able to keep fresh, quality ingredients for every one of those around, as well as be able to hone and refine every one of those dishes? I believe you can't, which worsens an experience that their layout already makes dismal. I'm looking forward to avoiding this place like the plague in the future."
Lindsay R.,"Monroe, WI",0,1,,5.0,3/7/2016,I went by myself after a long day of shopping ...  Service was excellent.  Dana was my server so friendly and cheerful and took time to ask about my day.  Good music playing.  I had Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls and the bistro shrimp pasta.  Both VERY yummy.  I had the lemon cello torte for dessert... Oh my lil slice of heaven.  I'll be back thanks Cheesecake Factory for great first experience!
Robin v.,"Madison, WI",0,5,,4.0,4/10/2016,Say what you want... Yes it is a chain restaurant. But everything I have had here has been perfectly cooked. When you come here you know they will not miss the mark. I think the service has been a bit hit or miss. It has been both excellent and atrocious.
Sara F.,"Madison, WI",0,9,,3.0,5/27/2016,"The food is pretty good, but also expensive.  The menu feels like reading a book- I know options are great, but there are just way to many!  We ordered cheesecake once, but found it to be very sweet- this is probably just a person preference, but I don't like my cheesecake to be super sweet.  All in all an okay place to eat."
Michael K.,"Madison, WI",0,1,,1.0,12/7/2015,"I've sat here for over 2 hours watching table after table being sat while they ignore our group. We may be a larger party but I've watched whole sections of tables that were perfect for us, be filled by couples who arrived long after we did. We called early, we arrived early and nothing changed. This is the worst service. I'm appalled."
Deborah C.,"Madison, WI",26,16,10,1.0,12/21/2015,"We rolled up to the Cheesecake Factory at around noon. They were running at about 40 minutes wait for a table, but my family and I were lucky enough to snag bar seating. I sat down and ordered a Bloody Mary and a plate of nachos for an appetizer. When my Bloody Mary arrived, it looked (and tasted) like watered down tomato juice with a solitary celery stalk waving hello. Barely any spices were added and I almost wondered if they forgot a little something something. Strike 1. The nachos were decent. Nothing special, but passable bar food nonetheless. For my meal I ordered the ""shepherd's pie"" (though with ground beef instead of lamb it was more of a cottage pie). Lunch came out almost on top of the appetizers. Strike 2. Oh well, no biggie really. Initially, the meal looked promising with red potato skins in the mashed potatoes, julienned carrots, and parsley. Unfortunately, I was in for a nasty surprise. It turns out when the Cheesecake Factory says ""ground beef"", they really mean ""huge chunks of crumbled up hamburger patty"". I also have  a sneaking suspicion that they save the hamburger patties they really screwed up for the dubious honor of being covered with gravy and hidden in mashed potatoes. The patty used in my meal was blackened and crispy on the bottom. They tell you that activated charcoal is great for detoxification. Well, based on the hunk of carbon I just snacked on, I should be rid of any toxins I've come into contact with for the last ten years. Not delicious. Hey batter batter. He swings, he misses. Steee-rike 3 and I'm outta here."
Dara D.,"Waunakee, WI",0,4,1,1.0,11/17/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory in Madison Wi.... stay clear. I happen to love the franchise but tonight I had the worst, most racist experience ever. I've always thought Cheesecake Factory was a family restaurant, which is why I didn't hesitate to bring my daughter in this evening with friends and family to celebrate her 10th Birthday. Well, where do I start?! We were seated by a party of 3 that complained from the time we sat down, rolling their eyes saying rude shit about kids, never asking to be moved. Mind you, we're in a family restaurant with a party of 10. I hear the rude ass waitress apologizing to the party while pointing, whispering and making faces at the kids. Next the manager comes over and proceeds to comp their entire meal. So as he's walking away, we say ""excuse me, the is a family restaurant right?"" The music is blaring and the voice level is average... he says of course we are, or waitstaff just should have done a better job at putting them in a more private area. A private area in a public restaurant?! How so? So I ask, will our meals be comped as well for us being seated by a very rude, racist party that constantly gave our children dirty looks and whispered loud enough that they too were uncomfortable? Of course not... so again, why are they being comped for choosing to go to a public restaurant and dining amongst the public? Our waitress dropped our drinks... were we accommodated in any way? So I'm still looking for the answer, is this a family restaurant?!  We're here spending hundreds of dollars and being treated like we marched past the whites only sign. Never will I ever patronize this place again. I will be contacting regional managers, CEO's and whomever else. I also intend on speaking with my attorney tomorrow. I'm disgusted and anyone with a family should take their money elsewhere and I intend on making everyone that I know"
Pamela L.,"Mount Horeb, WI",0,7,1,2.0,4/26/2016,"My husband and I had lunch there on a Wednesday after the lunch crowd was gone.  The interior decor is very ""Vega"" and generally attractive.  The food, not so much.  It is true that you eat first with your eyes and the Cobb Salad they served was not a vision to behold.  When it came to the table for my husband, my first thought was that it looked like someone had thrown up on the plate.  There was a huge mound of green, wet, limp lettuce strips in the middle (including other ingredients) with julienne cut eggs (more like dried out spears) forming a moat around the bottom of the mound.  They forgot the bacon which was just as well since the server said they were ""bacon bits.""  I have had a lot of Cobb Salads and this was without a question the poorest example of one I had seen or tasted.  Sorry to come down so hard but it was a lot of money for not very good product.  The server was nice but there is a definite push to get you to buy desserts."
Rachel Z.,"Madison, WI",0,9,4,1.0,10/20/2016,horrible service.  it is a Thursday afternoon before dinner rush we got sat. no one came to greet us at our table. we went to the host stand to ask if we could have a waiter. the waiter finally came and said I don't know why they sat you here if we don't have a server in this section. she blamed it on everyone one else. then it took forever to get waters n a drink. then we ordered food. we waited about 35 min for our waiter to come to us and say what did you guys order again. it's not in my computer... so she takes our order again and we wait another 20 min. let me tell u the restaurant was not that busy. we got our food n it was horrible. we always get the same thing so we know what to expect.  won't be back.
T W.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,18,2,3.0,3/12/2016,"It's an overpriced chain restaurant. Sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The portions were ridiculously huge and overpriced for the quality of ingredients."
Gail H.,"Middleton, WI",0,33,,2.0,6/25/2016,"The restaurant decor is pretty, but if the restaurant was full you would hear every cup and plate clank together, could be very loud. Fortunately the day I was there the restaurant wasn't very busy. The menu is large but many of the dishes are some sort of chicken dish. We ordered the crab cake appetizer which was melt in your mouth great. My husband ordered one glass of lemonade $5.00-- really? We ordered fish and fries - the fish was a little dry, no ketchup was brought to the table and we had to flag down the waitress. We also ordered the chicken burrito, it was just OK. It needed more spices and the guacamole appeared as though it had been sitting out. The free bread was very good, the Key Lime cheesecake was also very good. We felt there are better restaurants in town for the price we paid. The waitress didn't bring us  change  when we paid the bill so we rolled the amount into her tip.  Will not eat lunch or dinner here again, but will return for cheesecake and coffee."
Norma F.,"Waterloo, WI",0,4,,1.0,5/12/2016,"We went there because I wanted some really good fried catfish.  Having lived in southern Missouri before moving to Wisconsin over a year ago, I have been looking for a good catfish dinner.  When I saw ""Southern Fried Catfish, Farm Raised, Lightly Breaded and Fried Crisp"", listed on The Cheesecake Factory's menu, I couldn't wait to go try it.  Well, I can tell you it is nothing at all like real Southern Fried Catfish - I'd give it a 1 compared to real Southern Fried Catfish a 10.  It was in 3 chunk pieces and not lightly breaded, but heavy corn meal fried dark brown, and the fish wasn't done in the middle, because it didn't ""flake"" when you tried to cut it.  I actually took most of it home to finish cooking it properly because I didn't want to eat fish that was not fully cooked (fried), and we never send food back to be fixed, because of what might happen to it back in the kitchen. The mashed potatoes were good, but the green beans were almost raw and the corn was pretty dry. This meal was definitely not worth $17.95.  And, please don't think their ""Southern Fried Catfish"" is anything like the real thing because it isn't.  I guess you have to go south to get the really good, pond raised, catfish, sliced in long pieces, lightly breaded and fried to a light golden brown - it is so good!"
