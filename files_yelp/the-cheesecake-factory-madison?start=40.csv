Michelle D.,"Madison, WI",85,257,133,4.0,2/12/2016,"So I waited until the hoopla of the opening wore off before even considering a visit to the Cheesecake Factory.  Even on a cold Tuesday night in February, there was a twenty minute wait for dining in the pretty and dim dining room at 5:30 pm.  But there was immediate seating in the Indoor Patio.  My guest and I were fine with that so we were shown to a table pretty quickly.  The chairs were comfortable and it was kinda fun to people watch in the Mall. So both my guest and I knew Cheesecake was on our minds so we each got appetizer.  She ordered the Cuban rolls.  Very good flavor with the mustard sauce on the side.  I had the Ahi tartare.  The fish was very fresh and the sesame dressing was incredible.  I would have called it a Poke versus a Tartare but I loved it no matter what it was called. My guest ordered the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel and I ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme.  Yeah!  Both slices of cheesecake were out of this world.  It would be easy to just come for the dessert alone. we were given very good service from the host to the server to the food delivery servers.  The calories and price will keep this place as a periodically treat.  But a treat I will look forward to."
Food L.,"Madison, WI",0,19,4,1.0,12/9/2015,"First a score of 1 is pretty shitty and I don't just give it to any establishment.  Extremely disappointed.  Have been to many different locations especially in California and always had an exceptional experience especially loved Redondo Beach.. So was so excited to learn they were coming to Madison.  Was waiting to dine next week with friends and family for a celebration but really couldn't wait any longer for cheesecake so I just popped in to grab some cheesecake to go on my way to work. Five people at the cheesecake counter, 3 packaging and 2 cashiers. I look at the case take my pick and see there's a whole refrigerator with sliced up pieces ready to be served. So, much to my surprise it took literally 20 mins to package two slices of over priced cheesecake and put whipped cream on the side.  No it was not busy it was 330pm on a Wednesday. I seen people waiting to be seated with plenty of seats open, it looked disorganized and I walked away with a really bad feeling of the place.  What's worse is not the wait time but the ridiculous size of my $8 slice of cheesecake. I paid $16+ for two slices of mini cheesecake. See picture attached. I recall my other experiences and just receiving this big slice of cheesecake that makes you feel like you got your bang for your buck. This feeling was I got was more along the lines of ripped off and now I'm running late for work.  I have no plans to return at this time to this particular location. I think I've seen and experienced all I need to.  What I really want is a refund so I can take that to buy a cheesecake for the same price at Target that won't have me feeling like I just got jipped for my time and money."
Janet M.,"Madison, WI",0,10,,4.0,5/13/2017,Crazy busy & loud! The food is amazing. Menu is a bit overwhelming for a first time customer. Cheesecake is to die for.
Jody M.,"Madison, WI",15,156,16,3.0,8/29/2016,"We opted to sit at the bar since there were a couple of parties waiting to be seated. It was a busy Saturday night and loud in the cavernous room. We ordered a hamburger and two slices of cheesecake. It took a long time to get our cheesecakes. The bartender said the bakery was behind on orders. In the end, we got the cheesecakes to-go but were a treat to eat at home. Service at the bar was good and attentive.There's outdoor seating, in front of the mall, or in the mall across from Sephora."
Jason R.,"Madison, WI",0,3,2,1.0,2/26/2017,"Having lived in California almost exclusively I was so excited to find there was  a Cheesecake Factory in Madison having enjoyed the locations in Pasadena and Brentwood for years. Our first trip there wasn't bad...Not up to the quality of the Cali locations but pretty good.  Our second experience was a disaster. I ended up with food poisoning(my diagnosis not a doctor's, to be fair but I know that's what it was). I had a bacon cheeseburger and ordered it medium well. After my fourth bite my wife said, ""your burger looks raw!"" I looked and I saw a lot of pink. I will admit it tasted decent and I ate most of it mainly because I was starving and I knew how slow the service was so I'd probably wait 30 minutes or so for or a new one. My HUGE mistake! I ended up in the Sears bathroom feeling like Mike Tyson hit me in the gut about an hour later. I later became faint and ran a fever of 102. My wife tried to get me to go to the ER but I knew they'd only give me an IV of fluids and charcoal pills. So I proceeded to sweat it out, drenching our sheets and bed in sweat and spending every 30 minutes or so in our bathrooms for the next 18 hours. One more thing...And this was really bad...There was a mom and kid sitting at the bar eating Arby's(no joke). The mom ordered a drink and they proceeded to gobble up their fast food at the bar. I told our waiter that I worked in bars and restaurants in LA during college and that I had literally never seen that before and that it looked classless and was a joke that no one seemed to care. He said the manager had been told and had no problem with it. WTF? Almost every review on here from people who have eaten at other Cheesecake locations says this one is terrible in comparison. Things happen...I got sick and it could happen anywhere and I chose to continue eating a raw burger so it's partially my fault but the lack of caring of staff and management in allowing people to eat fast food at their bar is appalling. My next email or phone call is going to be to the corporate office Monday to tell them that this location is a disgrace to their brand name."
Jillian C.,"Oregon, WI",3,7,,3.0,5/13/2016,"See update at end. This is a BAD review.  I don't like doing this but the customer service we just received (or lack thereof) from the Manager, Steve Shirvinski, was abysmal. We just came back from dining at The Cheesecake Factory.  This was only the second time I've eaten there.  The first time we were there was when they first opened.  The food and service were spectacular.  We were so impressed, I ended up buying over $200 in gift cards as Christmas gifts. One of the deals with the gift cards was that they came with a card that was good for a free piece of cheesecake.  I had really been looking forward to that slice and was saving it for a special occasion.  Tonight we were celebrating a big event, so it was finally the right time to use the card.  Unfortunately, I hadn't noticed the card expired 3/31. I knew there probably wasn't much chance that I'd be able to talk them into honoring the card at this late date but I wanted to give it a try.  I asked to speak to the manager so I could plead my case.  I was shocked when the waitress came back to the table to tell me THE MANAGER REFUSED TO EVEN SPEAK TO ME.  I pointed out to the waitress that this was really poor customer service on his part but all she could do was shrug her shoulders and apologize.  The manager shouldn't have put her in that position.  I felt sorry for her.  It  could have affected her tip (it didn't.) I don't know why the manager couldn't be bothered to talk to me.  I wouldn't have been mad if he'd still said the card had been expired too long if he'd at least heard me out.  His refusal to even talk to me is what has enraged me. So, guess what Steve Shirvinski, next Christmas there will be NO gift cards purchased from The Cheesecake Factory.  They will be purchased from your competitors.  Oh, and the next time I have something special to celebrate?  I'll be doing it some place else.  When people ask me for recommendations, I'll make a point of telling them NOT to go to your establishment. You've permanently lost a customer, just because you couldn't be bothered to give that little bit of customer service and hear me out. Update: I got a call at 9:30 this morning (the day after our dinner and my post) from Steve Shirvinski.  He apologized for our experience and said he was never made aware that I asked to speak to him.  He said he had recently honored some free slice coupons for another customer and that he wouldn't have refused to speak to me about the issue.  He plans to send me a written apology and a $25 gift certificate.  I've changed my review from 1 star to 3.  I'll give them another chance."
Tenny D.,"Madison, WI",6,97,165,3.0,12/24/2015,This is my first visit to this location of the cheese cake factory. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of skinilicious selections. The food was not out of the ordinary. But the deserts were exceptional. Service was extraordinary as well. Staff was courteous and prompt. I will visit again just for the red velvet cheesecake.
C R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,137,51,1.0,1/27/2017,"I came here once for Cheesecake, and the wait times were too long. There was no place to sit, it was overly crowded, and the Cheesecake wasn't that great.  I don't recommend this place."
Margie H.,"Madison, WI",69,45,29,1.0,7/12/2016,"We've given this place 3 tries - the last was so bad that we'll never go back. 2 drinks and a spinach dip was $36! (The drinks weren't high end nor were the prices listed).  The service was the worst I've had in a long time. There were maybe 4 other tables in the whole restaurant (3 pm) and we hardly saw her. She was not the only server working. Our water glasses were empty and never offered refills and our dirty plates sat until I finally asked her to clear. I am a server as well and tip generously if I receive good service but this was a 10% tip kind of server bc she was horrible.  On a good note, the two previous times we did have the red velvet cheesecake and it was delicious."
Eric S.,"Madison, WI",53,23,,1.0,4/13/2016,"The decor is enough to put you off your meal - the ceiling something like a 1920 musical theater, the rest of it looks like a trapper-keeper from '84 just sort of exploded all over. The chairs are like wicker outside furniture. Tables were small, close together. Sound carried, loud, but very friendly staff.  The menu (physical) actually had ads for clothing in it. The menu items were all WILDLY unhealthy - but titled things like ""Ultra-Lean Low Fat Fried Lard: Ultra-lean lard on Focaccia with pesto and cilantro, with a side of low fat chili-cheese-chocolate fries. Mix it up with Fat-burning stout beer and whipped cream.""  I swear to bog, the words fat-free and low-fat were in every item description.  Who is their target audience? Rich fat women? Ugh. Never going pack there. Certainly don't go on any psychedelics. Or do. Maybe that would help."
Danielle K.,"Madison, WI",61,89,15,4.0,3/31/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is not fast food nor fast casual. Complaining about a wait should not result in deductions! Friends, there are plenty of empty restaurants around if you want immediate seating!  Everything about Madison's Cheesecake Factory was on point and comparable to long established locations - except for the hostess and hostess stand. There needs to be immediate attention here because the hostess doesn't look up. Telling people to stand to the side for 40 minutes probably hundreds of times per shift seems ridiculous and could be why she is so surly. Post some signs or get some sort of dividers or something. If you can get past the discombobulated mess that is the first piece of the experience, it gets better. Server (Briana, I think) was prompt, thorough, energetic, and friendly. She knew about the menu. That's a pro who can answer as to what's on the plate but not listed in the menu. That helped me. When my Asian dish came out it was better looking than any other Asian dish I've had. Yes, the rice was a little heavy and fresh pineapple a little light but that's not the end of the world. As you know if you've ever been to TCF before, portions are huge. You're getting two servings whatever the dish is! Cakes and pies are huge, pretty, and tasty!  TCF Madison doesn't disappoint in the food. We will be back but hope some changes are made to the hostess/holding area."
Louis L.,"Madison, WI",111,1,1,1.0,10/23/2016,"Found a piece of plastic （巨大一块塑料）, a twist tie type item (see picture #130), in my mashed potatoes. I had taken about 5 bites of my food at this point, and I told my waiter. Unfortunately, both the manager and waiter were not very sympathetic or accommodating, and I didn't even get a real apology. My entree was taken off the bill, as it should have been, but the manager said they would only give me either a piece of cheesecake, or a half order of my entree, which was the Chicken Madeira. 就给我半份作补偿也太坑了吧，看得见的是一块塑料，谁知道还有什么看不见的都混在吃的东西里面......I am a big eater, so I left the Cheesecake Factory hungry still. It was already gross that a large twist tie had been melting in my mashed potatoes the entire time they were being cooked (the manager explained it had come from the bag of potatoes), and I wish the Cheesecake Factory had done a better job of making it right. I used to come here all the time, but because of the poor customer service, I will not be coming back anytime soon.就冲着这个服务态度我还是劝大家不要去吃了吧，本来他们的菜品就没什么特色，服务又这么差，根本没必要花那么多钱去吃塑料........."
Sravya D.,"Austin, TX",111,5,,1.0,3/27/2016,"This is the worst experience I had at a cheesecake factory till date. We wanted to buy a cake with only 8 pieces and they said we had to buy 12 pieces in order to be arranged as whole cake that can be cut. So we ordered six red velvet and six chocolate tower cake. When we finally got it, they were put in two separate boxes. The whole reason we bought 12 pieces in the first place was so it could be arranged as a cake. The guy that handed us the order was extremely rude when we asked him why they were put in two separate boxes.  The service at this cheesecake factory needs to get on par with what the brand is known for."
Christine P.,"Madison, WI",15,26,,1.0,2/19/2016,"Summary: A 90 minute wait for subpar food and service and an injured child.  I had never been to a Cheesecake Factory before. I had heard it was good, so we decided to check it out. The wait time on Friday evening was 90 minutes. This is understandable. What is not is watching tables be vacated and then seeing them sit dirty for 15 or more minutes before being flipped. On a busy night, that should be done within minutes.  We were seated in their 'outside the restaurant but inside the mall area' without being given a choice of where we'd like to sit (in or out). We had our 2 1/2 year old son with us and put his order for corndogs and fruit in right away. In the meantime, I had water,my husband ordered a mocha, and our son had chocolate milk. Our drinks took about 15 minutes to get to the table, as did the basket of bread. The waitress dropped off the drinks and the mocha was lukewarm, not hot. It took so long for us to get our drinks, that when the waitress finally dropped them off and took our order, my son's food was done and delivered to the table. This is important if you have children: do NOT get the corndogs, or if you do, remove the sticks before you let them have them. The sticks they use have pointy, sharp ends inside the hot dog. My son bit into his hot dog and ended up cutting the inside of his mouth. We didn't realize the extent of his injuries until we were home and he started crying while brushing his teeth. (My husband waited 15 minutes on the phone for a manager before he hung up and called back and demanded to speak to one).  Another aspect of the kid's meal we didn't like is how they did the fruit for the side. It was chopped up into teeny tiny pieces. Many little kids are picky eaters and won't eat something unless they can see what it is, which is why my son wouldn't eat it even though he loves all the fruits that were in the side. I would prefer larger chunks that are still manageable.  As for the adult food. I had the Skinnylicious Turkey and Avocado sandwich with a side salad and my husband ordered the gumbo. I expected a warm sandwich, and instead I received cold turkey, on a very cold bun, with cold bacon. My husband said his chicken and shrimp was overcooked. I tried a bite and the gumbo itself was pretty bland.  At the end of our meal, we had all our dirty dishes stacked at the end of our table for a good 10 minutes before our waitress came to check on us. This was pretty thematic throughout the meal. Our waitress was pretty scarce. We wanted some cheesecake, but since there was no wait staff around, my husband went to the wait station and grabbed a menu for us to review. When our server returned, it took 15 minutes to get 1 slice of cheesecake to go. Let's be clear, this is a pre-sliced cake that's been sitting on a plate in a display case. It should not take that long to put a slice in a to go container. We had our bill paid and were sitting and just waiting for our cheesecake to go.  The service was abysmal. Our waitress looked like half her section was in our 'outdoor' area and half indoors. This meant that she wasn't around much. Not once did a bus boy or other server stop by while we were waiting to check on us or clear our dirty plates. We did not see a manager during our entire time there.  TL;DR - skip the hype. The food is not worth the wait or the price. Check your kids food order if you do decide to risk it to ensure no dangerous, pointy items hiding in there.  The cheesecake was decent. So maybe call in an order for cheesecake to go, stop in and pick it up, and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home. Trust me, the service will be quicker and friendlier that way."
Eric V.,"Sun Prairie, WI",0,3,,5.0,1/11/2017,"Been here twice, first time I had the Mac & Cheese Burger which tasted like a giant salt ball that left me thirsty for hours on end afterwards.  Quite disappointment.  We received a gift card to go again, this time I had the White Chicken Chili which advertised a ""Generous"" amount of chili. Upon getting the dinner it was actually quite the small amount of chili especially with the price of $14.  Pretty disappointment for the amount of food and the cost, went home had some more food.  More of a personal preference, but I don't really enjoy cilantro, which I think was in the salsa they added to the chili.  Can't say I'm a fan of the salsa it in, it ruined the texture of the food.  Can't say that I will ever want to go back.  The wait staff was very friendly and that's the only reason I'm not giving it a 1 star.   Update: Went back and tried it again, had the Southwest Chicken panini (I have a hard time remembering the name) and it was really good.  Really enjoyed myself this time.  Wait staff, again was very friendly. Thanks!"
Derian W.,"Verona, WI",32,9,,3.0,5/8/2016,They have decent food but as for the cheesecake I'll have to stick with more or so the new York style. All the varieties are great and I'm a huge cheesecake fan but cheesecake factory cheesecakes are a bit under my taste.  The menu is also a bit over board for me. Like 10plus pages is just a bit to much. So overwhelming. All high price as well. Good place but a bit much for a place no exactly labeled as high end restaurant.
Christine L.,"Madison, WI",43,159,90,2.0,1/25/2016,"We came here as a large party of 10 at 1pm on a weekday and the wait was 1 hour! And they don't take reservations.  I ordered their appetizer of chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. I was not impressed. It was bland, one note, and had none of the lightness that I had hoped in ordering a lettuce wrap. Instead, it came on a bed of rice noodle puffs and with lettuce that was hardly conducive to actual wrapping. The lettuce was stalky and would have been better if I was eating it with a dip. Big leafy lettuce for lettuce wraps, please, like the kind that Vietnamese restaurants know to provide with their egg rolls. Moreover, the chicken and mushroom filling for my wrap looked brown and unappetizing. A bit of color would've made it more appealing, like some red bell peppers or green onions.  Plus the chicken was dry.  The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their food though a couple of others also commented that some of their dishes were bland. Many of us ordered cheesecakes to go, but it took FOREVER. We even asked our waitress whether we should put in our to go orders as we put in our dine in order, and she said that we could do it at the end when we're ready for the check. So we did that, but then waited another good 30 minutes after paying the check for our to go orders to come out. It's no wonder the wait is so long to get seated here. Also, because we all ordered different kinds of cheesecakes, they brought it out to us but didn't label them or tell us what they were. It took some deduction on our part to figure which ones went with whom.   The one bright spot was the key lime cheesecake I took home. Perfectly tart yet rich and buttery on the tongue. It was decadent. I savored each bite and wished I had also ordered the salted caramel cheesecake.  It seems that people were very excited about Cheesecake Factory showing up in Madison, so maybe the wait will die down after a few months and they will figure out to make the service more efficient. Personally, I would not come back."
Amelia S.,"Williamsburg, OH",0,17,7,5.0,3/18/2016,The food was delicious and prepared super quickly. When some of our orders were accidentally dropped by a server the manager came over and paid for all the dishes dropped.  It's family friendly and very clean.  We will definitely be back!!!
Tanya V.,"Madison, WI",0,42,,2.0,12/3/2016,"Went to this location for the first time last night.  It seems like they still have some bugs to work out with being a new location, as this is definitely one of my least favorite Cheesecake Factory locations. Food is good, however, both my food and my husband's food were cold.  I had the chicken soft tacos, which have good flavor.  They describe them as spicy, however, I didn't detect any spiciness to them.  Rice was overcooked and hard.  My husband had the Cheesesteak and his was cold as well.  We were in a hurry since we had to get somewhere, so we didn't say anything and ate our food.  We ordered a piece of cheesecake to go and we waited for 15 minutes before we finally just left.  How does it take 15 minutes to get a piece of cheesecake to go?  I tried flagging the other waitstaff down to check on my cheesecake and not one person glanced my way. Our server didn't seem to be enjoying her job and only checked on us once right when we got our food.  After that, it took about 20 minutes for her to stop back again.   Will not be going to this location again."
Pat F.,"Madison, WI",35,29,,5.0,11/2/2016,"Today was such a great visit!  I immediately got a table for my party of 3 and our waiter was attentive but not intrusive.  We had some menu questions answered respectfully and accurately.  We had 4 appetizers and 2 sandwiches, all prepared with our requested modifications.  I have a new attitude toward them and admit my first visit at this location might have been too soon after they opened."
