Michelle F.,"Madison, WI",59,186,41,1.0,12/22/2015,"Like several reviewers here, I have been to Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other locations, enjoyed my various experiences, and was excited to see one land in Madtown.  But...oh, boy... The place was hopping at noon on the Monday before Christmas--admittedly one of the busiest times we could have possibly chosen. Lucky for me, my party was already seated in the bar when I arrived. The decor seemed swanky and modestly cool, but the first thing that struck me as I sat down was that the bar tables are far too small for a party of four to comfortably sit and eat lunch (amazingly, though, no disasters with water glasses or plates happened during our meal). The noise level was really quite uncomfortable. My party had ordered nachos as an appetizer, which gave me some time to peruse the menu and order. Quite a bit more time, it turned out, than I needed. 35 minutes later, the nachos arrived, followed shortly after (5 minutes) by our entrees. Our waitress, to her credit, was clearly annoyed that the food had arrived as it did.  Back to my order. It was foggy and miserable outside, so I was in the mood for comfort food. I am a sucker for Shepherd's Pie, which I ordered despite the misnomer: SHEPherds herd what? SHEEP. Like, uh, lamb. (C'mon man, ground beef makes it COTTAGE pie! But, whatever.) When the entree arrived, it looked fine, albeit with an entire parsley sprig plopped unceremoniously on top (I tore off some leaves and shredded them over the dish).  But my first bite revealed the insidious truth: hiding out beneath the copious mashed potatoes and gravy was...not ground beef. Not in the traditional sense. You see, my dish appeared to be a subterfuge for hamburger patties that had not made the cut at the grill (it didn't take much for my imagination to slide to the slimy bottom of that slippery slope--GAAAACK!). Many of the huge chunks of torn-up patty were burnt on one side or both, and all of them were quite bland. (Which made me wonder about the quality of the hamburgers--but I'll leave that for some other hapless patron to review!) A few vegetables had been tossed in and the mix was slathered in gravy, then cleverly hidden under fluffy mounds of cheesy mashed potatoes. After a few bites of this vile concoction, I ate enough of the mashed potatoes to fill me up--as in, the part that was not in contact with the slop--and left the rest. There were no questions from the waitress when she took my almost entirely slop-filled plate. It didn't matter, because I would not have ordered anything else: I was too grossed out. The very idea of re-purposed food makes me gag. So...to recap. Long wait. Loud. Slow service. Expensive. Truly sub-par food.  Sounds like a job for Kitchen Nightmares. Need I say that I won't be back?"
Shayn L.,"Poynette, WI",75,161,301,2.0,11/14/2016,"We've came here now several times to eat and everytime we leave dissapointed.  Today before we even orderd 2 of the 4 sets of silverware had old food stuck to it and were not even clean or polished for a higher end style resturant.  The waitress did not seemed very surprised when we showed her. That shows me management is not over looking small details. In a place like this no excuses.  Strike 1!  2 of the last 3 visits we waited a very long time to recieve our food, only to get wrong items or not impressive food.  The one time they felt so bad, because they were out of the appitizer we orderd after waiting for it and then ot never coming. Then I got the wrong meal they ended up buying our entire dinner.  I did not complain or ask for that, but they felt so bad for ruining our dinner.  Strike 2!  So now today we actually had good service, a very interesting Thia Wrap appitizer with 3 great sauces.  Good start!  However our sandwich and salad were horrible.  We orderd the Cuban sandwich and a salad.  The Cuban sandwich was very dry and over cooked.  The bread was way over toasted almost to a point were it was crunchy. It needed a little mustard or a sauce to help out the dry overcooked meat. Then the salad was so bitter tasting I personally could not eat it.  I believe this place has a reputation of being fine dining paired with a large selection of fancy cheesecakes.  I just cant bring myself to like this place. I will not go to a place just for dessert. They are a very nice, classy joint, but always are a letdown on the food.  For the price I feel I should never feel like the food was no good.  We decided today that it will be our last visit.  Consistantly bad in our visits.  STRIKE 3!  Your out."
JS L.,"Madison, WI",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2016,"This location is terrible: from service and appearance to menu and food, there is honestly nothing that garners a ""star"" on this review. Unfortunately Yelp doesn't give me that option.  Sounds harsh, I know. So let me break this down and hopefully someone would care enough to read the reviews and strive for improvement.  Let's start with the host station; you know, the first impression of any business. Well, in this case we get a snotty girl who just doesn't give a f*ck. As if we have inconvenienced her to ask for a seat. Also she has this habit of setting off the wait list buzzer before anyone is ready to take us to our table. How perplexing...  When we've finally managed to reach a table, we were extremely concerned by the bits of left over food stuck on all the silverwares. I assumed all the tables were set by actual human beings so I was a bit insulted by the level of dirtiness on my table. I mean, would THEY eat off of those greasy plates and forks??  On to the menu now: the menu is a novel. You can basically find every dish imaginable, from japanese to thai to mexican to irish to italian to american and beyond! And what's up with all the ads on ever page?? Note: allow for extra time when dining at CCF because the servers won't come back to take your order for at least 30 min. after you're seated, and trust me you'll need that much time to look through the plethora of choices offered.  As for the food, lol.... First of all don't bother ordering anything for your kids on the kids menu; they're all watered down with milk. The soupiness and blandness of my daughter's mac n cheese made any kraft instant boxes look gourmet. Then came the gigantic entrees that would feed an entire third-world country village. Big portions are nice, but what's the sense in stuffing my face with raw pasta, salt, and grease? Paired with previous left over food bits stuck on my forks? No thank you. Mind you, prices per entree averages at $19. So there. I will take my $100 and put it in any local restaurant that takes pride in their menu and cares about my patronage."
Jack and Kissy I.,"Madison, WI",14,73,1,4.0,1/20/2016,"I cannot believe the whiny reviews. The menu is to0 thin? Really? It takes 10 minutes to get through it all. It's too pricey for what you get? You get enough food to make a whole second meal in leftovers! If you give one star because you had to wait, then go across the street to Denny's where you'll be happier and probably better suited for you anyways. All the food is really good. The prices are more than reasonable for the quantity and quality, and the cheesecake is awesome. Just a fun place. Obviously they are working with a new staff. The wait is long because people are going there! Whiners, go someplace that is empty and enjoy that food that nobody is standing in line for. Arghhhh!"
Brian J.,"Sun Prairie, WI",34,108,199,3.0,1/31/2016,"The Cheesecake factory has been open for a couple of months now so you would think that they would have it together by now. I know it was a Saturday night but every single thing arrived very slowly, food was just warm ,Steak Diane was good though! By the time our cheesecake arrived it was to go time. Don't need to come back."
Michael B.,"Madison, WI",466,18,3,5.0,12/7/2015,"I arrived at 6:30ish on a Monday night a week after they opened. I was greeted immediately and said it would be 15 to 20 minutes. 10 minutes later I was seated and my waiter was very helpful with suggestions. The menu is HUGE. I ordered a cucumber lemonade. It was wonderful. The waiter suggested the ahi tuna carpaccio rather than the crab cakes for the starter. It was fresh and came drizzled with Aioli and fresh avocado. I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was delicious and was a HUGE portion. I took home half of my dinner and had them pack up a slice of salted caramel cheesecake, which I am enjoying as I am writing this! A very welcome addition to Madison's restaurant scene. Unlike another recently reviewed chain restaurant that opened in Hilldale. Are you listening, Cafe' Hollander???"
Jacob M.,"Madison, WI",7,56,32,5.0,1/23/2016,"I really enjoy this place. My wife has taken me a few times when she lived in CA and we've driven to the one in Milwaukee. She was excited when this location opened and I think she should be. We went here on a Friday night for dinner with two other couples. It was not surprisingly jam packed. We came at 6pm and we were told it was a 2-hour wait, but we were seated in one hour. Pretty impressive. The atmosphere is pretty loud, which is perfectly fine for our group since we love a good laugh and have tons of energy.  Our server was Joe. He was above average and answered any questions and concerns we had, especially with our orders. Big points. He gave us enough attention and refilled water without 'being in the way.' Our food was delicious. My wife ordered their special, which was salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli in a lemon cream sauce with mushrooms. I ordered their BBQ burger which I've previously enjoyed in the past. I asked for it to be cooked medium and it was more medium-rare, but better than well-done like other establishments. No complaints, really. Everyone else enjoyed their meals: jambalaya, miso salmon, some other burger, and another chicken dish.  The cheesecakes were the cherry on top. My wife and I shared a Snickers cheesecake. Our slice seemed smaller than everyone else's, but Joe explained it well enough that certain cheesecakes are made differently, etc. For instance, the Dream Extreme (oreo cheesecake) is pretty massive, but a big part of it is the chocolate cake piece. I had a taste of the Tiramisu cheesecake: my wife loved it, I could care less for it. It was too strong in my opinion. Our friend loved her vanilla bean cheesecake.  With their 400 page menu and delicious desserts, we're planning to come back here again and explore their food some more."
Brian C.,"Madison, WI",41,198,17,2.0,12/20/2015,"The granddaddy of big box food. Tasty? yes. Inventive? not really. Oil and butter as substitutes for inventive, creative food? Most likely. Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable. The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full ""skinnylicious"" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options. But at the end of the day, their menu seems to rely a bit to heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor."
Kristi S.,"Belleville, WI",28,33,72,5.0,11/25/2015,So full. So amazing. Would write more but I'm too busy continually stuffing my face. Second day of opening and the only thing that went wrong was that my side salad came with my meal. Not gonna complain about that!!
Henry Z.,"Madison, WI",336,89,8,4.0,11/27/2015,"Going to the Cheesecake factory was a walk down memory lane. I remember back in high school when I was so excited to go here. I thought I was so fancy bringing girls here after a movie, where the ceilings were so tall, the walls decorated with classy moulding, and stone flooring where the click of heels can be heard as crisp as a bell. High school me thought that this was the Waldorf. Now that I've lived a bit, I know how silly it seems to be so impressed with the Cheesecake Factory, but coming ""back"" here after so many years gave a helpful heap of nostalgia in a time of the year of thinking back. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant with the same corporate structure (I think) of others like the Olive Garden or Applebee's. The food has stayed impressively uniform across time and space, and even the architecture and decor are carefully curated to produce the same ambiance across all of their restaurants. The food is a cross-section of presentable but comfortably familiar American foods, such as shrimp scampi or steak Diane, as well as delightful Asian fusion items like Thai spring rolls that are scattered within the menu to liven up the palate of their extensive menu. And, as the name of the restaurant might suggest, there is cheesecake and plenty of it. First, my order: a crab and artichoke dip for appetizer; chicken marsala (chicken in a mushroom and Marsala wine sauce) and pasta (I asked for angel hair instead of the default farfalle*); and a Godiva three-chocolate cheesecake. A lot of food, that's for sure. The food is not bad. Sure, it's nothing to be blown away by, since it's a chain restaurant and not run by a celebrity chef. The crab in the dip was probably canned or frozen and lacked the oceanic umami typical of fresh crab. The chicken was pretty tender, the pasta not overcooked, and the mushrooms well-seasoned and the main source of savory in this dish. A small part of me suspects that the sauce was premade because it feels thickened artificially, but it could just be the quirk of the chef to prefer their Marsala sauce with a slicker and thicker consistency than what I'm used to.  I guess in hindsight this shouldn't really be a surprise, but the cheesecake ended up being the highlight of the evening. It is composed of three forms of chocolate cake layered on top of each other. On the bottom is a flowerless chocolate cake. In the middle is a traditional cheesecake of chocolate flavor and composition. The top layer is chocolate mousse. All of the chocolate are from Godiva, and you also get a hearty slice with two large clouds of whipped cream (I'm pretty sure canned though) on the side. I was particularly happy with the cheesecake because 1) I haven't had chocolate in a very long time, and this reminded me of how delicious chocolate is; and 2) it's not too sweet, which I was afraid of going in. There were tons and tons of other options, so I can really only vouch for one very specific choice among the cornucopia of cheesecake options available. For me, if this meal were served to me without any hint of what restaurant it was from, I'd be less impressed with the food itself. But for me, and I hope for many others, the Cheesecake Factory is delightfully innocent. In other chain restaurants, there are always promotions and deals that make you aware of how commercial the entire endeavor is, and then when enough food for four people are put in front of one person, your eyes glaze over and you're focused less on tasting and more on eating. I don't want to feel like a deal hunter on Black Friday, out hunting for the highest calorie count with the lowest dollars. The Cheesecake Factory, with their menu of familiar food items culminating in a winning dessert, brings in the mind of this reviewer the comfort of familiarity and pleasure of being disarmingly charming. And it's not expensive! This three-course meal came out to $40. The Cheesecake Factory is meant to be accessible to everybody, and without feeling exploitative. Here I am just reminded of decent food and a fun and cheerful experience. *I strongly dislike farfalle because it's never cooked evenly given its uneven thickness. The edges are mushy while the ""knot"" stays doughy and uncooked. I feel that too few people notice this, so consider this a PSA against farfalle."
Ashley M.,"Madison, WI",19,14,29,2.0,1/17/2016,"If I were only reviewing the cheesecake it'd be 5 stars, no hesitation.  Sadly this buisness serves more than just cheesecake. Way too much more. I love having a variety of choices. I hate having to read a novella just to see what my options are. It's pretty obvious that they've spread themselves too thin menu-wise. The food isn't awful but it isn't good either (especially considering the prices). The wait always seems to be forever for seating. Then you have another forever wait for the food. Save yourself the trouble, eat your main course elsewhere. Come here for dessert, the drinks aren't bad so indulge with the cheesecake!"
Maggie P.,"Madison, WI",0,1,,2.0,5/14/2017,"Living in Chicago, I used to go to the Cheesecake Factory all the time so I know what a quality experience here is. Decided to give the one in Madison a try. Took 20 min to get drinks. They came out wrong. Took another 15 min to get the correct ones. Ordered two filet mignons medium and they both came out WELL done. If I'm going to pay 30$ for a steak I want it cooked right. Unfortunately we didn't have another 30 min to send our food back. When we got the check we saw the incorrect drinks had been added on.. Awful experience. Poor customer service."
Tom B.,"Verona, WI",3,37,2,3.0,1/20/2016,"I've been to more than one Cheesecake Factory over the years.  I've always thought of this chain as being heavy on hype, but short on delivering the goods. It has been a few years since my last encounter though, and naturally I was interested when they opened up at West Towne.  So I paid a visit today with the family, quietly hoping for a more memorable experience than I had in the past. The restaurant presents itself well.  I like the curvy aisles and the booth-heavy seating.  Let's face it, everyone wants a booth, and nobody wants to feel like they are being placed on a grid.  The use of low light and warm color tones makes for a comfy environment.  Unfortunately the place is a madhouse right now, but I can see it rounding into form after the opening rush quiets down. Once I started leafing through the menu, my memory of past visits started to return.  The thing is huge.  Pages of small plates, appetizers, pizzas, sandwiches, every kind of specialty you can imagine.  Asian inspired dishes.  South Western inspired.  Italian inspired.  Just a flood of choices.  Where's the cheesecake?  Oh, it's there.  Lost somewhere among all the other stuff. It's meant to be impressive, this overwhelming barrage of choices.  And, sure, it is.  But it's also hard to pick one thing from a list of...everything.  I felt like I might get lost and forget what looked good 3 pages back. Now for the specifics.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich with a bowl of mushroom cream soup instead of fries.  Naturally it came with fries, but no big deal.  Our waitress quickly brought the soup and left the fries too.  The sandwich was long on bread and short on the rest.  Oh, it wasn't terrible.  Just average.  I would have preferred more ""Cuban"" and less ""sandwich"" though.  I didn't care for the soup, and found myself munching on the fries instead. My wife ordered angel hair pasta with shrimp.  It was a little dry so she asked for more sauce.  Again, not bad but definitely not good, either.  Her martini didn't fill the glass, although she reported that it tasted fine. We had crab dip as an appetizer and enjoyed it.  I'd say that was the highlight of our meal. Even more impressive than the huge menu would be if they delivered it all with quality. But the reality is, they fall a little short.  They have 100 choices or more, but nothing really stands out. There's no focus, and that drags everything down.  Even worse, the restaurant is famous for its cheesecake. And it is probably the best thing you can get, but it's buried under the weight of all the other mediocre food. To wrap this up, I'd like to recommend The Cheesecake Factory but I can't quite get there.  It's always looked fantastic from the outside, but once you get inside the reality doesn't match the aesthetic."
Maya C.,"Madison, WI",0,1,4,3.0,4/29/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a place to indulge high calorie meals in a ""luxury"" Midwestern setting. The Cheesecake Factory in West Towne is slightly on the tacky side--with seating in the mall hallway and hostesses with tons of makeup, the restaurant is more of a casual dining place than a fancy, upscale restaurant. The atmosphere is not inviting: parties waiting to be seated are crowed around the entry space; the place is chaotic.          However, once I was seated after the usual 30-40 minute wait, my waiter was very friendly and the food came right away. All of the dishes are savory and rich, and the portion size is massive. I would recommend splitting an entree and a slice of the legendary cheesecake with a friend; you will have more than enough food. The only downside is the price: in my opinion, twenty dollars for a pasta dish is a bit too expensive. Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is a great place to try if you are starving, as I guarantee you will not be leaving hungry. However, I wasn't a fan of the fake luxury decor, nor the high-priced entrees."
Zhuoran L.,"Jersey City, NJ",80,9,41,4.0,12/6/2015,"Ordered the steak diane and shrimp scampi followed by Tiramisu cheesecake for desert. My friends told me that it is not as good as other cheesecake factory but I think they are just as good. Maybe don't go there during rush hours because it still takes 40 minutes to get a table at 1:40. Otherwise, delicious！"
Angie M.,"Madison, WI",58,22,4,5.0,7/24/2016,"I've been waiting for the west side location to open up and finally visited. From the two hostess' to my server, it was a very friendly staff! I, for the life of me can't remember my server's name but he was great! He offered my baby a cut up banana to keep him happy and bread, while waiting for my takeout, which was last minute. He didn't have to but it really is the little things that made my, short, experience good."
Dave D.,"Middleton, WI",7,10,,2.0,9/16/2016,"Food was pretty good.   Wait staff was very friendly BUT they seem to be spread very thin.   It took 25 minutes to get our second glass of wine.. we gave the order to three different servers.   Our plates sat on the table for a good 15 minutes after we were done before they were removed.  Finally a guy named Collin came over and took care of us.   Brought me a glass of wine, my wife decided to pass ( lost sale).   Waiting right now to see a cheesecake menu... waiting ..... waiting....  now two different servers brought us each a menu... strange...As I said the food was pretty good for a chain.   They need to get their service act together. We probably will not be back.  Too many good choices in the area."
Midwest G.,"Madison, WI",9,70,,2.0,5/30/2016,"The west side of Madison.  For this denizen of the Isthmus, that phrase conjures the idea of the apex of a normative soulless mainstream culture, where corporate restaurant franchises dictate protocol with the same pathological assurance as certain politicians.  Enter the edifice of the Cheesecake Factory, whose menu is mostly as calorically indulgent as the decor is bereft of any regional identification.  To cut to the chase, I had a small Greek salad bathed in some kind of lemon oil dressing with room temperature chicken.  I was happy to be back in familiar and comforting environs later that day."
Jodi R.,"Madison, WI",11,3,,1.0,3/24/2017,"Drove 45 minutes one way on Sunday, March 5th for brunch, only to find the restaurant was closed for some unexplained reason. Sign on the door said they hoped to be open later in the afternoon. Nothing on the website or Facebook page indicated they would not be open. Such a disappointment and waste of time (and money!). Probably won't make the drive again any time soon. In this day and age, your website and social media should reflect current hours of operation."
Amy S.,"Sun Prairie, WI",27,10,2,3.0,2/3/2016,"We've experienced Cheesecake Factory in Milwaukee so knew going in what to expect. Large chain feel, extra large portions, etc. Hubby and I stopped in for lunch on a whim when we were out shopping at West Towne. Shared the Chicken salad sandwich and fries. Each table also gets bread and butter. Sandwich was good, fries were fresh/hot. We left satisfied, and skipped the dessert."
