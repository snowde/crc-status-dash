Abbi S.,"Madison, WI",0,30,1,3.0,2/27/2016,The food is a little too expensive for what it is. It's nothing really special.  One time I went there the server was amazing the other time not so much. The second time we sat there for 15 minutes before being helped. The guy brought us bread but dropped it off and left so quickly I was unable to tell him we had no plates or silverware. Had to ask another lady cause our server wasn't anywhere near us for the following 20 minutes.  The cheesecake is great though!
Water B.,"Madison, WI",0,9,,4.0,8/9/2016,"We were a little worried after reading some reviews , but.... Went in at about 7pm on a Tuesday. Got a seat for our party of two right away. Unfortunately waited ...25 min with no water or a greet from our server. A waitress from a different section finally noticed and came to see if our server had been there yet. After knowing we have not been serviced at all , she helped us right away!  After a while the manager came over and apologized for the wait. He did a great job and was there to make our experience right. He put our food on rush and personally delivered our appetizers :) The egg roll sampler is tasty! Lots of variety and different sauces to compliment. The entrees were good. Can't wait to try our cheesecake! It looks delicious!! We will most definitely be back for snacks and maybe dessert! Nice atmosphere"
Ken C.,"Brazil, IN",1,49,2,2.0,8/28/2016,"I've had good meals at Cheesecake Factory in other locations. This was expensive and unimpressive. i got a  small steak and piece of salmon abd a bit of mash.  Food was good as was the service.  I just know I  could have had better for $36 per person, elsewhere."
Andrea K.,"Middleton, WI",0,5,,5.0,3/12/2017,We have had excellent service & food here!! Derek our waiter this past Saturday was just amazing he was so personable & checked up on us perfectly even when they had an hour wait.  Food is soo incredible we have loved everything & have been there about 5 times since it opened. Keep up the great work everyone!!
Rachel K.,"Roscoe, IL",0,22,2,1.0,6/17/2016,"Orange chicken came out literally ice cold. We were so disgusted after taking a bite that we had to leave. Our server was also a jerk, and not very attentive...was more interested in hitting on his coworker (we were right next to the waiter station so it was impossible not to notice). Don't come here for anything other than cheesecake...and get it to-go."
Amit I.,"Madison, WI",9,110,28,3.0,2/10/2016,As always in my reviews: if the service is not perfect - everything else is less important! We come for dressers. Why hot chocolate orders needs to take 20 min? Especially when the regular coffee and the cake arrives right away? The cake and the hot chocolate was VERY good but I cannot give more than 3 stars due to my disappointment with the service
kelly m.,"Madison, WI",48,5,,2.0,3/6/2017,Every time I try this place it is so disappointing. Even a burger and fries was not all that good. Deserts are sub par. If you want good desert and cheese cake I recommend Hubards in Middleton
Jennifer K.,"WI, WI",0,3,,1.0,12/16/2016,"Had the most appalling service at the Madison, Wisconsin Cheesecake Factory bar this evening. My friend and I stopped in for a few cocktails and some appetizers between 7:30-8:00pm while our sons were at a Build-A-Bear birthday party in the mall--John C. was our server. There was a huge snowstorm going on outside, so the place was dead--we had the entire bar to ourselves. There was no friendly smile or hello as we sat down--John greeted us with, ""What can I get you?"" before we'd even taken our coats off or put our packages and purses down. We didn't know what we were thirsty for, so we asked for suggestions. He reluctantly offered a few, which we took. While the drinks were good, the glasses were loaded with ice...and even with that being the case, mine was still a good half inch from being a full glass. I decided not to complain, but I was finished in literally 6-8 sips. When he asked if I wanted another, I said yes, but requested that he didn't put any more ice in the glass. This time, it came back with a good inch of liquid missing. When I questioned him about it, he pointed out there was less ice this time, and when I replied that the last drink even with all the ice wasn't full, he became surly and outright rude, telling me I ""just needed to trust he was making the drink right."" When I tried to explain I wasn't questioning the WAY he made the drink but rather HOW MUCH was in the glass each time, he proceeded to interrupt me and talk over me, not letting me finish a sentence. His poor attitude put a serious damper on our evening. My friend had ordered us some appetizers, and rather than stay, we opted to have them boxed up to go as soon as they were delivered. The bill came, and John did nothing to compensate us for his short-change on my drinks. We left upset and, frankly, feeling unfulfilled--we'd so been looking forward to a relaxing hour without the kids with some terrific food and cocktails, but honestly John C.'s lack of customer service and unfriendly demeanor really ruined it for us. We ADORE the Cheesecake Factory, having been to this and many of its other locations over the years, but this type of treatment left a very sour taste in my mouth--if I do end up returning to this location, I'll never sit at the bar again, and will closely monitor all drinks coming from there to ensure the glasses are full. Considering the price of their whiskey smashes, they should be!"
Sandy S.,"Madison, WI",0,25,,2.0,2/5/2017,"I have gone to the Cheesecake Factory in Milwaukee for years and loved it so I was very excited when one opened in Madison. I went once a year ago and was very disappointed in the skinnylicious menu. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad and it was very blah...not like the higher calorie one. Half way thru I noticed that I hadn't tasted any chicken so I called the waiter over. They brought back a dish of chicken with apologies but didn't take off the price of the meal or even discount it. I complained on the corporate page but again didn't get a call, email...nothing. Now, a year later I finally went back and ordered the skinnylicious chicken enchiladas. They were very bland and tasteless and the chicken was very chewy. The waitress never even asked how our food was. Probably would be a good idea to drop this part of the menu as you do it poorly..... I doubt I'll go back...... By the way, my husbands hamburger was excellent he said."
McKenna V.,"Madison, WI",0,4,,4.0,6/27/2016,Cheesecake Factory is a great place to eat but the service is a little slower. The people are very nice there. It is very fancy but you don't need to dress up and that's what I like about. It  is kind of expensive but that's okay because the food is great. there whenever I eat the cheesecake it's like eating a little piece of heaven. It is a great restaurant to go to.
John P.,"Saugatuck, MI",4,17,12,4.0,6/29/2016,Great service.  Avacado egg rolls bere fantastic.  I just eat the insides...pure avacado heaven.  Chicken picatta was very good with plenty of big freshly sliced and sauted mushrooms.  Love the dark bread in the basket too.  I'm stuffed!  No cheesecake tonight.
Alexander R.,"Amstelveen, The Netherlands",1,5,,4.0,4/18/2016,"Today I had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and it was great. Tasty, spicy and well flavored. We didn't need to wait for a seat and the ambiance was cosy. The big problem where the pictures of mouth watering cheesecakes. Tempting but we skipped. The sandwich alone gave me a full stomach."
Shreenidhi B.,"Culver City, CA",5,7,,1.0,3/21/2016,Doesn't seem like any other THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Service is very bad. Unlike other cheesecake factories they don't serve the bread initially. That was surprising.! The standards are too low. Hope the franchisee takes a note about it.!
Sue B.,"Sussex, WI",0,15,3,1.0,3/17/2016,"Service seems to be getting better. But, the hostess told me a one hour wait unless I sat at the bar. When I resisted, a table was found. Remember, cheesecake factory, take care of your single guests."
Hannah W.,"Cottage Grove, WI",1,19,3,4.0,11/16/2016,"There's a lot of negative reviews on this place but I personally like it. I've never been disappointed with the food, staff, or service. As many yelpers has said, prices may be a bit higher but that's because the portions are huge. Will come back for sure!"
Landon S.,"Oswego, IL",0,2,,5.0,7/3/2016,"First time there, the fact that just about everything is handmade in the kitchen is really nice for me and for people who have allergies and stuff, i got spaghetti  and meatballs. It was almost better than olive garden! It just needed a little more sauce but i mean it was way cheaper than olive garden, and you got more for your money! Plus nobody else has like a bajillion flavors of cheesecake. Oh btw get the s'mores its like a mouth bomb of flavorfulness"
Megan -.,"Madison, WI",0,12,,3.0,10/12/2016,"Great menu, but very slow service. The drink service is especially slow, even at the bar itself. I think they overextend themselves and aren't always able to keep up with the demand that having such a varied menu requires."
Troy B.,"Madison, WI",0,20,,1.0,4/10/2016,"Bad service, filthy tables and undercooked food. The staff was frantic in a near-empty restaurant and they seemed perturbed when we complained about our disgusting uncleaned table. They eventually moved us to a booth and changed our server to one who was less distracted. I could see our old table from our new one and the staff proceeded to refold our handled napkins and left everything the way it was for the next unwitting customer. Our plates were dirty on the new table and the food we received was not worth the hassle."
Mark C.,"Madison, WI",6,7,,5.0,3/11/2016,"Granted it was the grand opening, but the service was amazing and the food...three words...OH...MY...GAWD...run, don't walk, to this place for dinner!"
Andrew L.,"Middleton, WI",0,4,5,1.0,1/16/2016,"If you have a spare four hours, have lots of patience, and don't mind spending a lot of money for average food, this might be your go to chain restaurant. We wanted to make a reservation for Thursday night (1-14-16), for ten. We were told that company policy didn't allow reservations, even for large groups. My wife asked how long it would likely take if we showed up at 6:00. She estimated 45 minutes. My daughter arrived at 6:00 and put in a reservation for ten and was told it would be around 7:15. (75 minutes rather then 45). No big deal. We go to the bar and 7:30 rolls around. I wander through the restaurant and notice that they are severely limited on large tables and that none of the large tables are close to being done. We talk to the manager and he estimates it will be another 5 minutes. What did the manager see that I didn't? A little bit before 8 we get buzzed, get our group together including an elderly person with a walker, and are informed that the table is not ready but that he wants to give us an update. He puts the blame on customers who are taking too long to leave (we later learn it is really due to really slow service). The manager orders us two complimentary appetizers at the bar where we have already spent over $150. A single crown royal on the rocks runs $10, and the menu includes no prices for drinks. We finally getter seated at 8:15. This is an hour after we were told the table would be ready and two hours and fifteen minutes after we arrived. This better be good. Our waitress was pleasant and expressed an understanding of our long wait but then proceeded to do nothing to make up for the poor service. Honestly, I have never seen a restaurant do a worse job of turning tables. There was almost always 5-6 tables that were not cleared, or were empty. The manager told me he was aware of this issue. Our orders didn't get taken until 8:30,  and our food didn't arrive until 9:00. I ordered the steak tacos. The black beans were stone cold, the rice and tacos were barely warm. At this point I had talked to the manager twice and was simply starving. I should have sent it back but didn't. The cheesecake we ordered was average at best and took for ever to arrive. My son ordered a slice that they were out of. Long story short? We got out of there at nearly 10:00. It's not the customers that are causing tables to be occupied for 90 minutes. I thought maybe something besides the two appetizers would be comped. They were not. No apology from anyone when we left. Our food bill and tip was over $270 plus a bar tab of over $150. So....we spent about $42 a person for a four hour miserable experience. Any restaurant that knew what they were doing, would have given us a small gift card to give them a second chance on a better night.  It amazes me that this place is this busy. I have been to the Chesecake factory in in Chicago and don't recall these problems. I suspect that after the novelty wears off, that people will go to the many other restaurants in Dane County. While waiting for our table, I shared my observations with the manager and asked him if he had read any of the negative reviews on-line. He said that he had and that corporate was also well aware of the problems. You will notice that management doesn't appear to respond to any reviews on-line. More importantly, they do nothing to correct the problems. We were celebrating three birthdays, but what we will remember is the service that sucked at the Cheesecake Factory."
