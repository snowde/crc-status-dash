Caroline S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,19,75,4.0,1/4/2018,"I am always a fan of their chinese chicken salad and other dishes here and not to forget the mega calories cheesecakes...  I like this particular branch because you can eat with a view, a perfect pair for a nice meal. Service is always consistently good and waiter is always attentive. As far as parking goes, only valet is available. If you come before 4.30 pm then it will cost you $4. And afterwards, it will be $6.75."
G G.,"Menifee, CA",92,24,6,1.0,1/7/2018,"Pretty diappointing. Drove over 70 miles for a girls night out for my birthdat... Very crowded, very loud. Kitchen noise is ridiculous. Jesse was our server... made me feel rushed and uncomfortable. I felt like a nuisance. Ordered a veggie burger, no cheese, and side salad. My friend ordered meatloaf and ceasar salad. No bread was ever served. Jesse brought out her meal. I waited. He came to the table and asked if I had an allergy. He said they put cheese on the last veggie burger. He called a manager. After a ridiculously long wait she appears with a veggie burger and fries. No salad? Why not bring the salad while I'm waiting and where did the burger come from?  Amanda, the manager, said they just made another one. Had to ask for my salad. Comped a slice of cheesecake. Did I mention I'm lactose intolerant? Hubby will enjoy the treat. Not coming back here."
Tom D.,"Detroit, MI",1,5,,2.0,1/7/2018,"I eat at this Cheesecake Factory like 3-5 times/ month. When I get carryout, my order is consistently wrong. Literally every time I order carryout, I have missing sides, food is prepared badly/ burnt, or something is prepared directly opposite of what I requested (e.g. extra onions, when I requested none).  It's kinda a running joke I have with myself now. I order something and don't even check before I leave...partially because I think ""there's no way they're gonna get it wrong AGAIN THIS time"" and partially because I like to live on the wild side. The shit is always wrong.  The food is always good though, and I never have a problem with my food when I dine in...so there's that."
Patty S.,"Los Angeles, CA",212,271,1630,4.0,12/18/2017,"I have noticed an improvement in service and food over the last few times I've been here - so its time for an update on my review.  My most recent visit was with the youth group from our church to have a Christmas dinner.  Although the wait was the usual (30-40 min) on a Friday 6pm evening - the wait was pleasant - as we sat on the patio by the firepits having our drinks and exchange Christmas gifts.  Note: there is not drink service at the fire-pit sitting area - however customers are welcome to come to the bar area and order drinks/appetizers and take them out.   We got our table within the advised time inside and it was delightful.  Food appeared fresh and well presented and drinks were re-filled without us having to hunt-down our server.  At the end we order several cheesecakes to share and it was all delivered to us in a maner that it enhanced our dinning experienced... an extra plate for every cheesecake slide - so each person would have their own plate.  Brilliant!!! I appreciated this so much... it was not the usual from the past where there is one plate and 10000 forks.   I am happy to see that the customer service standard has improved for this is a place I have sort of ""grown-up"" with."
Kim K.,"Burbank, CA",145,573,3279,2.0,12/29/2017,"Wow! How very very disappointing!   We walked in and were greeted right away. We asked for a seat inside by the window if possible. The hostess said it would be just a few minutes. When she walked us to the table the view was of two closed umbrellas and other random stuff shoved in the far back corner of the restaurant.  So we asked if we could just sit pretty much anywhere else. She said to sit down and she would double check about another table. So we did. It really seemed like she forgot about us but about 5 minutes passed and she came back and sat us a few tables over (not next to the window but certainly a better view and feel).  Just after that they sat a lone guy at the table we opted out of.  The server came by... HIS TABLE, brought water and their signature bread. Still, we sat.  Then his specialty drink came. A large group sat next to us.  Still, we sat.  The other guy got his food.  The people next to us were served their food.  Still, we sat. Finally had to disturb a waitress taking yet another order across from us, and asked if she was our waitress.. And that we have been sitting here and don't even have water. She apologized, found a piece of paper to jot down our order and took off. Finally some guy came by to greet us.  Really?... Like 20 minutes later.?! We gave him our order but told him we gave it also to the girl at the order station (pointing in her direction), but before we could ask for bread and water, he went over to her.  So we don't know if she's coming back, or he's coming back, or... Hell who knows!   My friend finally got up and walked over to yet  another waiter and asked for a basket of pumpernickel bread. He said they were out, and my friend said, um no you're not..go find some. She came back to our table and a few minutes later miraculously, they found our bread... as well as some water . FINALLY! Soon after our mushrooms and avocado rolls came out. Really were never checked on again. Not that we were going to order any more after all the chaos we went  through just to get this! Our waiter came by once more to drop the bill and luckily we had cash so we didn't have to wait any longer to get out of this place! You all really dropped the ball! You should be ashamed! Only reason I'm giving a 2 star is because our food was actually good. Too bad the service was crap!"
Yuri C.,"Inglewood, CA",425,1358,1045,4.0,12/28/2017,"There are gazillion food options at the Cheesecake Factory as the menu is like a novel, and the long cheese cake list never disappoints.  It's no hipster place, and it's not somewhere I go to anymore, but there is some nostalgia, and could be one of the only places you can satisfy a big group of hungry people. Parking was only valet, and the price was $6.50z I enjoyed my shrimp and beef combo. The mashed potatoes is always too much so I opted for French fries.  The portion was not too massive so I was able to finish it! As for the Cheese cake, definitely recommend the Red Velvet."
Amanda A.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,78,73,3.0,11/24/2017,"This is definitely one of Cheesecake Factory's prettier locations, at least if you decide to sit outside on their big patio (overlooking water!). The food is usually good, not distinguishly better or worse than any of their other locations. However, the reason for three stars is because of my home deliveries from this location.  One time I ordered avocado rolls and they arrived looking kind of bad. The avocado looked like it had been sitting out for hours, was a brownish color and it didn't taste good. I've ordered the avocado rolls many times at location and they've been a pretty green color so I know they aren't supposed to look like that. The second time I ordered cheesecake and it had a long strand of hair sticking out from the bottom of the box and the cheesecake :( So the home deliveries definitely need to see some improvement in the future, in my opinion."
Martis D.,"Calhoun, GA",15,20,43,5.0,12/23/2017,Not a long wait  Fast service  Nice waiter  Delicious food  Knowledgeable waiter Don't have to wait long for coffee Cheesecake delicious
Susan U.,"Los Angeles, CA",501,782,1965,5.0,9/18/2017,"Countless deliveries. Just for cheesecake. Well it's Cheesecake Factory so for sweet cravings,this is the best place!  So one time I went to check the place since it's just around the corner to pick up a birthday cheesecake. Busy,busy and busy. (It's Saturday) The Valet is convenient but we parked in the designated pick up parking spot. Yes to that. It's right by the Marina and what a rewarding view! It's good for big parties. The bar area isn't as huge as I expected and amazingly,not busy at that time. Nothing was going in there. Outside seatings were congested as usual.  The guy who helped me was kind and courteous. Had to be very patient since it was a 10 minute wait for the pre ordered 10"" HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE CC.  Worth it! Ignore the bad reviews. Go enjoy your food and chill!"

Mario Z.,"Rowland Heights, CA",144,11,,1.0,1/1/2018,Devante is rudest host I've ever encountered.  I've been to other cheesecake factories and none of them are as filthy as this one.
Rebecca S.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,106,158,3.0,10/5/2017,Beautiful location on the marina. Valet parking. Outdoor/indoor seating. Playground out front for kids.  Usually a wait.  Kind of expensive considering the food is hit or miss depending on how busy they are.  Calamari is not crispy....ever. Obviously the cheesecake is HEAVENLY! Oreo and banana are unbelievable.  The bar service is slow and sloppy/dirty. The glasses never look clean to me.  The table service can be really good depending on which server you get. I think if they had a few good hands-on managers they could whip this place into 5 stars.
Brittany S.,"Hawthorne, CA",13,115,51,1.0,1/8/2018,"I'm ready to cry at how poor the service is tonight. Me and my boyfriend came here on a Wednesday night. Pretty slow and not busy at all. ""Great"" we think. We are seated immediately but they place us at a table with a very bright light when the entire restaurant has intimate settings... like literally the light is shining on me like I'm about to put on a performance. Then after 6 minutes, our server finally comes to us and asks us what we would like to order. SHE DOESNT ASK US IF WE WANT ANYTHING TO DRINK SO MY BOYFRIEND ASKS HER IF WE CAN HAVE SOME WATER. I then notice we don't have bread so I ask her if we can have some bread as well. She says yes. She doesn't come back to us after she gets us our water but our bread still isn't there. It's been about 12 minutes and at this point I get up and go to the front and ask them what's the hold up on bread because that's what cheesecake is known for. The man at the front tells me there's a delay on bread and all the tables don't have them but should be out shortly but I can tell a manager if I want.. I chose not to. I got back to my seat and I'm visible upset so I ask if we can move to a table where it's not so bright. GUESS WHAT!! Our server comes up to my boyfriend and I asks ""so I need to know. Who said something about the bread not being here? How long did it take exactly because this is my name on the line"" I tell her it took 10-11 minutes and she lets me know the kitchen is backed up. That's fine hunty, but that's not how you approach anybody. The entire night was stale and I don't think my server was professional or prompt until she realized she may or may not get a tip. She was a middle aged black woman, natural hair, and slightly shorts didn't get her name but that's okay because I told my boyfriend let's never visit this location again. Service was lacking and in top of that, my food was nasty. The nachos were delicious and my boyfriend liked his food but maybe it was just my luck but my eggplant Parmesan was a no."
Mat U.,"San Francisco, CA",76,7,1,5.0,1/9/2018,"I love the food here. Their tiramisu cheesecake is amazing and out of the world. Chicken tenders and chicken wings are great. Tried quite a few dishes here and till date their food stands out as an amazing. The wait for a table is horrible however, it's worth it."
Lianne K.,"Simi Valley, CA",181,765,4289,2.0,8/3/2017,"Five stars for our waiter.  He was great and took good care of us.  There stars for the mango cheesecake.  It was too sweet and had an odd texture.  Didn't have that toothsome body that you normally expect. 2.5 stars for the funky layout and decor of this location.  We had to go up several steps, adjacent to the kitchen to get to the odd dining room space. Felt a bit like being in a cave. And for the big finish - 0 stars for the parking lot.  $6.50 for parking?!  Is this Manhattan?  It's the freaking Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Rey, for goodness sakes. We self parked and still had to pay that outrageous amount.  Found it offensive. Am sure the patio is great, looking out at the marina, but indoors wasn't that wonderful.  Not planning to rush back."
Tess F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,37,,1.0,1/7/2018,"!!MANAGER WAS NOT RECEPTIVE AT ALL - VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!! We were seated after waiting for almost an hour. When we got to our table, it was still not ready, had food scraps and was wet - yikes! While we were standing to have it cleaned, the waitress, Summer, dropped a couple of metal bread containers and they almost hit my feet.  Summer just walked away - no apologies - didn't even ask if I was alright. She was so rude and did not care! Talked to the manager about the incident and he was not receptive at all!  Just like Summer, I felt that he didn't care at all. On the way out, I told the manager that I was going to share my review on Yelp.  He just looked at me and walked away.  I appreciate that someone responds to the negative review but they do such a poor job not taking care of the issue when it's presented to them at the restaurant.  Very poor customer service - will never go back to this location again!"
James W.,"Venice, CA",64,396,19,4.0,10/18/2017,"Something for everybody should be their theme. The Cheesecake Factory Marina Del Rey has always been one of their best locations. Located in the Marina, there is a large valet only parking lot and the dining room and area is very large. You wouldn't really think about this because often times this location is just packed wall to wall. The menu is long and eclectic. The variety of dishes are substantial. Old school favorites such as the Cajun Jambalaya to the Chicken Madeira still exist. Even my favorite default of the Herb Roasted Chicken is still tasty good. Cheese cake/dessert selections are just what they are known for, and a good bar rounds off their fanfare. What keeps me coming back is their consistency and overall great service. My only complaint is that some of their taste isn't as bold anymore, and portion sizes are shrunken inversely to inflation. Great thing though, you can order food at the bar if you can't wait for a dining table."
Emilio M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1350,467,1264,4.0,5/4/2017,"I was a 5 star fan of The Cheesecake Factory up until this last visit. The loss of a star may sound silly but it meant something to me. So here we go... First the good stuff. What I still love about this TCF is the location. Close to home and if you're visiting from out of town its a special treat because its close to Mothers Beach (a great place to paddle board BTW) and theres a playground close by for the kids to goof around in. The service is as outstanding as ever. Our server was super friendly and accommodating to our every request even though it was super busy. Well played. The food is always great! If you're gonna take a break from a diet plan it may as well be wrecked here. Most meal are over 1000 calories (even some of the salads)  and that doesn't include the cheesecake. I had the Bacon BBQ burger with fries. A burger served up with more bacon than anyone needs and a pile of onion rings on top! A must try!  There is a 'Low Calorie' menu as well but whats the point? One goes to TCF to enjoy life with friends and family. Then came dessert. Where my heart sank. After scanning the dessert menu up and down several times over, I asked the server where the apple cinnamon cheesecake was? ""Oooooh sorry sir, thats been removed from the menu."" . I must have been the only shmuck ordering it? So yeah...for this reviewer the loss of the only dessert that mattered to me being taken out costs The Cheesecake Factory a star. Oh well. La vida sigue I suppose. Misc:  Expect to wait at least 20-45 minutes. We opted for 1st available and were seated outside within a reasonable amount of time. The patio has plenty of heaters plus a better view of the bay and sail boats. Valet parking or a long walk from the public lot. The lot is metered I think? Overall:  The Cheesecake Factory still remains a great place to get a great meal and lighten up your wallet. But for the price one gets a memorable experience. Yeah I'm bummed that the one cake I was craving is gone but I'll get over it. Still plenty of options. Please tip your server accordingly. Cheers."
Marcus R.,"San Francisco, CA",59,4,,1.0,12/16/2017,"I spent my morning trying to have a good time with my friend but I spent my energy trying to find my waiter that never came back to me with my order, to bring water, to get my desert and I just couldn't find him. The others waiters was always walking around but my guy probably was playing his phon somewhere. So sad. Unfortunately I forgot his name."
LovelyM Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",553,26,,3.0,1/4/2018,"The food as amazing especially the cheesecake but the overall service was terrible. We waiting two hours to be seated and upon completing our meal had to wait an additional hour just to pay. Server kept passing by saying I'll be right back, we don't have change so it's going to take me a minute, sorry I'll be right back. It should not take an hour to leave a restaurant."
Mike P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,12,5,2.0,11/4/2017,Let me start off by saying the Cheesecake Factory is awesome but not this location. I would suggest you googling The Cheesecake Factory in Redondo Beach is worth taking a 25-minute ride down there because once you get there you will need Lee be seated because that place is three times bigger than the Marina Del Rey location and you have a better Ambiance still overlooking the harbor. The reason why is because first of all parking there is tight in the valet service is horrible. The reason why it's horrible is because the valet service should know how full the restaurant is since it's a small restaurant because the management or the stuff that the restaurant should be communicating back to the valet attendants letting them know how full the restaurant is because this is one of the smallest Cheesecake Factories they have. The management there is very nonchalant along with most of the workers just because they work at the Cheesecake Factory they have lost touch of reality in the field of customer service. So why wait in a long line that's going to take you about 30 or 35 minutes till we see it and a compact area when you can spend the 25 and 30 minutes go down go down the coast and be out of more comfortable vibrant Cheesecake Factory and spend your money in the place where you feel way more comfortable and at ease and definitely the waiters or servers there are way more professional and friendly hl
Esther L.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,230,173,1.0,8/27/2017,"This location just really can't be helped. Every time is always awful. We sat down at the bar area to avoid the wait, and it took them 10 minutes to clear the table. It took another 10 minutes to flag our waiter down. Then it took 10 minutes to get our waters and order. Then it took 45 minutes to get our food. Our waiter even said our ticket was the longest standing one in the kitchen. Everyone around us sat down after us and got their food well before us. Our food? The Louisiana chicken pasta had no sauce; it was literally buttered noodles. The ""special"" cheese and bacon dippers were a sad panini (see pictures). The chicken sliders were really plain tasting. The only good thing was the mac and cheese. This place is just this bad every time we come. I will be taking the longer drive to go to another location if I want to go to cheesecake factory again."
Kimberly A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/29/2017,"We had to wait 45 minutes for an outside table, but it worth the wait. The views of the Marina are beautiful and the food was fresh and delicious."
Diana V.,"CA, CA",17,26,76,4.0,11/10/2017,"The scenic view is just amazing, especially during the sunset on a summer night. Space is a bit limited so you're literally squeezing in through everyone just to get to your table. Depending on the day of the week, it's usually a 20-30 minute wait before you get seated, then after it's about another 5-10 minutes until they take your order and another 20-30minute wait until you get fully served. They only take valet parking. I think that it's $6...? Don't remember. Food is great! No complaints about that. This review is based on my experience at this restaurant for Sunday brunch. We were the first ones to get seated right after they had finished serving all of the morning/ breakfast customers....that might had been the reason why they took so long on serving us our food. (Returning Customer)"
Martin T.,"Baywood-Los Osos, CA",30,127,131,3.0,7/9/2017,"This was our second visit to this particular location in the last month. Our first meal was on Fathers Day, the staff and kitchen performed perfectly. It seems (generally speaking) that really busy restaurants do great when they are really busy. Service is faster, more urgent. The kitchen is hall'in ass so they don't get backed up. And yet when the pace is a bit slower the entire process slows down, the servers are MIA for ages it seems. The back of the house lacking the need for speed seems to casually process orders. I believe the slower pace provides an opportunity to get distracted, have some horse play, and the I'm in no hurry today syndrome takes affect. So while we enjoyed both of our meal experiences in the last month, understand that your not in charge of the place. The best you can do is try  to relax, enjoy the meal, and go with the flow.   Foodguy-martin"
robin s.,"Culver City, CA",18,80,39,5.0,8/6/2017,The one thing I can always guarantee is I'm going to have a great Chinese chicken salad and good company at this location but today we had exceptional service by Solange. And it was a lovely day on the patio beating the Heat
Robert G.,"Culver City, CA",19,39,36,5.0,9/27/2017,"As usual with my reviews I'm going to have to put a strong emphasis on our server. The ambience is always good here at this restaurant and the food almost always delivers. But as most of you who read these reviews know all too well, if your server is not Top Notch, the ambience and food will fall by the wayside. On this particular occasion, Mr. Vernon S was our CSA, or customer service All Star."
Virginia V.,"North Hollywood, CA",54,18,,1.0,10/10/2017,"Had a terrible experience at the Cheesecake Marina del rey location this last Sunday late afternoon.  An intoxicated lady at the bar was unruly and harassing my girlfriend and I.  No wonder the bar had 2 open seats at peak hour.  We politely tried to ignore her but she was out of control.  The staff and managment did nothing to control her or remove her.  We were left to deal with this over poured patron.  IT WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE.  I complained to both bartenders (whose profusely apologized) , hostess and supervisor without her looking not to aggravate the situation.  They still did nothing.  Luckily she finally wandered off....THANK GOD!   Then to add, it took forever for our food to arrive.  The overall experience was not right and I did not expect this from an established food chain that usually offers a nice and polite environment. Lastly, when the bill came, they did not offer any compensation for the inconvenice.  I asked if they could please at least comp the appetizer considering.  The manager comes over and wants to tell me she can't control people in the restaurant THAT SHE MANAGES.  She felt that this was not the restaurant's responsilbility to handle.  Mind you, she had not appeared once during the whole incident. Disappointing CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!"
Jerry J.,"Hawthorne, CA",131,16,,2.0,10/12/2017,"Only reason Im not giving this place a one is because I dont wanna be disrespectful and the food is actually pretty good.  My ENTIRE problem with this place is the staff... Recently went here again after sharing another bad experience I had (see previous post). I swear to God I cannot remember the black waiter's name (something exotic and fruity sounding) but when I do I will update this post; HORRIBLE.  First off for a Sunday wait was not bad. We were seated in like 10 mins...That was the shortest wait we had all evening. It took about 15 mins before we had ANY contact with any staff. A nice white gentleman (Jeff, I believe but not sure) came by, apologized and finally took our drink order. We also noticed 3 OTHER COUPLES who looked as irritated as we did being that were all seated after us and were still waiting. Didnt help either that ""Jeff"" mentioned that our server was working a double as if I cared or that was a logical excuse as to where our actual waiter was. First rule of business you are taught is to never say you are short-staffed, you dont know or you cant help. But here is where things just took a wrong turn: After 30 mins our original waiter STILL didnt show up! So ""Jeff"" finally took our order. Most restaurants, within 30 mins you could already sat, ordered and be halfway through a meal. When our waiter FINALLY came over, he spent at least 7 mins talking to all the other tables. Im sorry but this might get racial but im honest about my reviews so I tell it like it is.. All the other couples were white lol true BUT I noticed the engagement was completely different once he came to our table. His exact words were, ""Y'all need anything else"". Now by this point im pissed and puzzled.....You finally come over after being gone over 30+ mins and not only do you NOt introduce yourself but you address us as if we did something to you?! Took everything inside of me not to grab this idiot and toss him into that nice lake from the view we had...He ended up only coming by once more. He even had his co-worker bring us the check... Talk about feeling discriminated by your own kind. I'll say this in closing: If this Cheesecake Factory does not take the time to address their staff they will eventually close. I guarantee it..."
Julien G.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",3,58,16,3.0,12/14/2017,They messed up my order but otherwise it was ok. Its the kind of restaurant you only go once a year. Service is so so and the spot is very noisy. Will probably never go back to this location.
Victoria S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",11,63,58,5.0,6/28/2017,"I love this spot! My family and I come here often. Service is always great! We love the patio. Lots of umbrellas, patio lighting, a great view of the Marina & beach. As always Cheesecake does not fail with the menu! Overall, I highly recommend. TIP: the only offer valet parking so a little cash for tip is recommended. They do validate parking. Also, it gets busy! Esp during summer. So you may prepare for a little wait. (I find myself at the bar of needed:) or a walk on the beach...the view is amazing!"
ken k.,"Venice, CA",7,441,4,4.0,12/3/2017,The happy hour is is one of the best! This review is for HH only. Regular menu is good too with a great view of the marina.
Dara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,385,46,1.0,9/4/2017,"Where do I even begin with this review. At this point, this is all comical. SO I had a poor dining experience at The Grove location, as a chance to win me back they sent me a $15 gift card to dine a second time. So tonight's dinner was part compliments of The Cheesecake Factory and this experience was even worse than the first one. I don't want another gift card, I really just don't have the energy to deal with mediocre food AND mediocre service.  We waited 30 minutes for a table, our server takes awhile to bring us water and bread and we ordered right away because we knew it would just be crazy. I order a salad, he orders an appetizer and burger. The appetizer comes out in a good speed but an hour plus goes by and we're like where is our food.... We then get notified that the order got messed up. On top of this, we asked multiple times for new silverwear since ours were DIRTY!!!! He did not bring it, I asked another server who brought it asap. The table next to us also had dirty silverware. That is DISGUSTING, I ate with plastic utensils, I have never in my life done this at a restaurant. My friend asked for ketchup with his burger, never got it. Literally everything that could go wrong went wrong minus finding glass or hair in our food. What a nightmare. It was so bad that I spoke with the manager letting her know what a horrible experience this was. She was apologetic and offered us a slice of cheesecake which we took her up on but jesus, 100% will not return."
Danielle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",410,9,2,1.0,1/3/2018,"I work in the service industry A. So I know a little bit about seating and proper ways to run the restaurant not only to keep customers happy but to ensure the restaurant makes the most money they can on a given night. I go to the Cheesecake Factory ALL the time but leave it to my 21st birthday dinner to have it plummet. When I called they said I couldn't make a reservation after 5 o clock so they said to show up 30 minutes prior and should only be up to a 30 minute wait. When I got there, there was a HUGE wait but the entire restaurant was completely empty! I was told a 2 hour wait! When I spoke to the manager I got some bullshit excuse that they have a policy that's states 80% of the restaurant they keep unoccupied until a specific time? BUT YOU DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS AND HAVE HUGE PARTIES WAITING FOR NO REASON AND YOURE LOSING MONEY? Makes a lot of sense. A party of 9 probably would've spent $500 and they lost out to what keep a table reserved for a party of 2? Tragic and won't be returning."
Erika D.,"Long Beach, CA",79,78,106,4.0,6/9/2017,"Of all the locations ive been to this is the one ive frequent the most. I like this location. Ive never had to wait to long to be seated. Outside seating next to the water is so beautiful. Seating inside is so romantically dimly lit. I order the samething every visit, Spicy Jamacian Shrimp & a slice of red velvet cheesecake.

Ryan R.,"Duarte, CA",82,43,22,4.0,5/9/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. I've been to tons of them and this is one of the best ones for a view. It looks nothing like a traditional Cheesecake Factory, not even close. The only reason why I dropped a star was because of all my Cheesecake Factory visits, this location was a little off on the food. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but being that I'm a connoisseur of the Cheesecake Factory menu, I noticed a difference.  The bread was a little hard and my sandwich wasn't exactly right. I got the chicken and avocado club (one of the best sandwiches ever) but the toast on it was a little past the normal golden brown. The chicken was off a bit also. All that being said. I would return to this location because of the view. It's amazing"
Denise V.,"Fox Hills, Culver City, CA",2,45,11,5.0,11/13/2017,"I had one of the best dining experiences here. Last night I took my daughter for a belated birthday dinner and I thought I would have to wait like 40 mins or more because it was packed. To my surprise we only waited less that two minutes and got a lovely a seat outside with heater. The food server, John M, was outstanding. He gave me and my family excellent service. It may our whole experience awesome and special for my daughter bday. The food even did not take long to come to the table. I have come to this place many times and always was good service but last night I felt the food server went above and beyond to give us the best quality of service."
Anthone O.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,68,63,4.0,4/30/2017,"Parking is a nightmare here. one of the guys doing the valet parking had the nerve to ask me for a tip. I gave him a tip ""don't forget your umbrella when it rains""... I will never go here on a weekend if I don't have to. it's always crowded. the last time I went we waited for an hour. it was my aunt's birthday so I couldn't leave. they don't take reservations on Friday, Saturday, or sunday. the food is good. the service is great hence the 4 stars. you cant go wrong with Louisiana chicken pasta. their lemonade is way too sweet."
