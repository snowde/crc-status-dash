Rachel H.,"Plano, TX",0,5,,5.0,3/19/2017,"My grandmother loves this location of the Cheesecake Factory! We come every Sunday for brunch. She loves the lemon ricotta pancakes, and my husband loves their omelettes. We ask for Cheyenne when we visit because she's so friendly and attentive! She remembers our orders and gets everything out quickly. The staff works very hard so even though the restaurant is busy, it never feels like service suffers for it. Between the awesome atmosphere and the view of the marina, this place is the best brunch spot!"
Gina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",293,36,1,2.0,8/3/2017,"At least this time the order was correct. The male answering and checking out take out orders however was very impolite. Twice, I said thank you. Not once did it occur to him that HE should be the one thanking me for being a customer. I waited at the pick up counter for 5 minutes with 3 different people behind the register who all saw me standing there and never once approached me. The customer service has most definitely gone downhill over the years. Extremely disappointing."
Nick B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/28/2017,Not worth the 1 hour and 45 minute wait. Rude hostess. Straight out the wrong place to be on a cold Friday night.
Ana S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,31,28,3.0,5/24/2016,"3 stars because we had to wait OVER an hour when initially we were told it be a 10-15minute wait.  Our server was great and despite it being busy, he was attentive to our needs and kept checking back.  The food was okay. Not the best I've had for a cheesecake, kind of disappointed to be honest, but we really only came here for the view. Great at anytime, but keep in mind the wait you may need to endure to enjoy it.  Parking is valet only. 3.50 until lunch and $5 after I think is what it was.  For this trip and it being our first time here we definitely were disappointed with the food and wait, but loved our waiter and view. It was a hit and miss."
Laurie F.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1,39,4,2.0,8/3/2017,"For many, many years we have loved this place.  My niece's family, who now live in Colorado, always want to go when they visit.  My grand nieces pick for her 14th birthday.  Jen was our server Sunday, July 30. We told her we were celebrating the girls birthday when she greeted us.   I asked if we could order cheesecake with dinner so we did not have to wait for it.  She did not know how to do this without it coming right away :-/  We waited and waited after finishing dinner to order.  My niece had pulled her aside to remind her it was the little girls birthday.  Yep - she forgot.  Cheesecake finally came and WE sang to her without any help from the staff.   All around us people were being sung to with 4-6 servers joining in.  It was really sad.  The child was really sad!  Jen came when we were half way thru our cheesecake with a little cup of whipped cream, a teaspoon of ice cream and chocolate sauce wiped in the cup (that tasted horribly burnt) and ONE other person to sing to my niece.  Too little and too late.  We will find other places to go for our celebrations due to this."
Gigi G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,5,,4.0,2/13/2017,"Love this place. Food is great, location is awesome, staff is great and even the prices are great. But the only reason i'm only giving them 4 stars is because they don't take reservations. Many times I have tried to have my birthday dinner there BUT we have to go and usually wait over an hour just to get a table. I think they should be able to accommodate for a party of over 10 with a reservation without to wait an hour."
Erineo G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1213,10,9,5.0,7/1/2016,"I am always satisfied when I come to this Cheesecake Factory, I came with a party of 10 and they sat us down right away on a Monday afternoon. The view is great from outside and the food delicious. I recommend the meatballs and avocado rolls for appetizers. All their pastas are delicious as well. Make sure to save room for dessert!"
George B.,"Culver City, CA",580,21,,5.0,7/20/2017,Food is always good. Service also. I come here a lot and they know me and my son and are always friendly and welcoming
Nina S.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,181,306,5.0,7/26/2015,Best Cheesecake Factory location!! I highly recommend getting their an hour earlier as it's always packed but super worth it. You get the bay view and once it gets dark outside the lights turn on in the patio. Took my mother here for her bday and got shrimp scampi and steak for her with the peach vodka drink. I got the lettuce chicken wrap and dynamite shrimp. The avocado egg rolls  are the best. Always get the bread in the beginning with their ranch dressing. Their ranch dressing has garlic- so so GOOOOOD!
Heather H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/30/2017,"My party is now entering the 5th hour of Cheesecake Factory. We signed up at 6:45 pm for a party of 15. We were told the wait would be an hour 15 to an hour 45...we weren't seated till 9:35 pm. We were told multiple times by different staff members that our table would be ready. As soon as we got seated a waiter poured 2 pitchers of ice water on our mom. While saying ""don't worry, it's just ice water!"" We got sat in a small corner where we had no elbow room, we waited 20 minutes to get high chairs.  We had to ask multiple times to get water & bread refills. We did get complimentary appetizers. But our waitress was quite unenthusiastic. We got a back up waiter while she went on lunch & he was a million time better. Very understanding & attentive. Food was great, service was ridiculous.  We couldn't split the bill, so our sister & her fussy baby couldn't leave. We got a tiny ice cream scoop for the bday girl & didn't bring the cheesecake menu after we asked 3 times.  It's 11:55 pm & were now trying to figure out the bill so we can leave. Oh we still have to pay $7 for vallet..."
Sheri H.,"Walnut, CA",0,10,,2.0,7/9/2017,"Ambience on the patio is always pleasant.  Food fair. Service terrible.  Sat at the table with menus and no water for at least 20 min. Had 3 different wait staff, none of whom were attentive. Never had water refilled. Nobody checked on us.  Had to ask for the bill.  Lots of other choices for food in this area."
Guido K.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,176,,4.0,10/4/2015,"My friends and workshop attendants all love it - so we go there now and then, even though I am personally favoring more individual places. But when going to The Cheesecake Factory, we do the 30min ride (even though there are a few much closer to our home) and sit outside at the beautiful marina and enjoy the sunset. Good place, good food - a huge menu. So better than OK, but far off from a ""must go to"". But if you go, leave room for the carrot cake. That's a must - and one piece server four. Easy."
Niki P.,"Los Angeles, CA",189,51,32,5.0,5/27/2016,"This is by far the best Cheesecake Factory, due to the great atmosphere along the marina. Food is always solid and service is very attentive. Very consistent and never a long wait. If you are already a fan of this restaurant chain then make it to this one. You won't be disappointed!"
Dayz A.,"Carson, CA",0,15,6,3.0,12/14/2016,View was beautiful! But the service was extremelyyyy slow! 3 stars because I witnessed a cute proposal happen on the table next to us.
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2372,8712,3.0,3/24/2015,"I generally think food at Cheesecake Factory is good (well depending on what you order), although I have had some items that were pretty disappointing. But anyways, I came to this Cheesecake Factory on a Tuesday for lunch with my husband.  Not being familiar with Marina Del Rey or this location, we were surprised to see that we had to pay for parking (bummer to that and wished this restaurant would provide free parking since we are spending money at this business). But anyways, after we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and seated at a table (with a nice outside view of the water). After looking over the menu, we got: Shrimp with Angel Hair- The portion of this entree was rather large and plenty for 2 people to share. The noodles were cooked a little to long, as they were a little bit on the soft (almost mushy) side. The shrimp itself tasted good but wished there were more of it. The creamy sauce itself was good, but oily (typical of restaurant fare).  Renee's Special- this lunch special comes with you choice of half a sandwich of either chicken almond salad or turkey. I opted for turkey and asked for it to be served on mustard instead of mayonnaise. This lunch special also comes with a cup of soup and a side of salad, which is quite a bit of food. The soup I had was tomato bisque and it was really nice and creamy and also served warm. But because the salad was served on the same plate as the soup and sandwich, a good part of it was already wilted by the time it got to my table. The turkey sandwich itself was pretty standard.  Service was just average. Our water glasses were refilled only once during our visit. We were checked on twice during our visit.  Overall, there isn't really anything special or unique about this visit, compared to our dining experiences at other Cheesecake Factory locations. Really the only reason you would want to come to Cheesecake Factory is for the cheesecake and their other desserts on the menu are pretty good as well."
Johnathan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,8,1,1.0,10/23/2016,"Service is horrible the waitress tried to argue with me over what I did and not did not order then she cut me off and try to correct my order but with an attitude i don't want you handling my food now. Then I asked to speak to the manager his name was Jonathan he was no help either he didn't even try to fix the problem I was with two other people i felt that he could have discounted the meal or something. Then near the end when my friends were done eating she went to them individually and asked them did they want desert totally skipping over me. Even though I know what I ordered, regardless she should have said I'm sorry, so what do you want I wasn't feeling the atmosphere soon as I walked in the door when they say us near the kitchen I would like to eat in peace don't go to the one in Marina try Redondo or somewhere else. I felt like my mother having to argue like that"
Alex J.,"Huntington Beach, CA",93,94,63,5.0,1/25/2017,The Cheesecake Factory never disappoints! Great location and beautiful decor. I love how you have a great view of the promenade from the outdoor seating area. Staff is also lovely and know the menu really well. Will be coming back to this location in the future!
Alexis G.,"Lawndale, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/16/2017,"Before I give this review I want it to be known that I am a server part time and my family has ran a very successful restaurant business for over 50 years. I tend to be very understanding to restaurant service as I do have a well understanding with the dynamics of it. However, this location in Marina Del Rey has the absolute WORST service I've experienced. The last visit I had here was on January 22nd, 2017 for a birthday brunch with my four friends. The one pro was that we were sat immediately. Our drinks took about 30 minutes to get to us and I received the wrong drink twice. Maybe there was a tad of miscommunication as we had about 4 different servers helping us out with no introduction to the next. We didn't mind at first, but by the second to third server, with the food still not out, it was frustrating. When the food finally touched our table, again, my order was wrong and when I mentioned it to the server THEN that was helping us out (not the one who took the order) he snapped at me. Like I mentioned, I do not like to make a fuss, but this was ridiculous. I know what's appropriate when it comes to customer service. The last server to help us ( didn't catch her name) was negligent to us but not the rest of her tables. I brought up to the manager about the service and he was dismissive. All he did was take off the drink off the bill THAT I didn't order. No apology either. If I could give this review no stars, I would. I hope this gets to the district manager and he/she improves it for the future customers of this location because I will not be back."
Patricia P.,"Bakersfield, CA",13,8,16,4.0,12/27/2016,The service was great!  Thank you Andy. The Filet Mignon was perfect. The only reason why I don't rate it as a five star is because of the vallet parking. Why would you force me to use the vallet parking? Maybe I just don't understand.
Beydi H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,2,1.0,6/28/2017,"Negative stars for sure! This service was the WORST i've ever experienced at any restaurant. It all started from the beginning, my party and I arrived at 7:40 p.m for my sister-in-laws pre-birthday celebration. They advices us it will be an hour wait, so we waited, and waited and waited. It was 9:15 p.m and we were still outside waiting, we eventually got tired of waiting so we went in and asked what was taking so long and the waiter apologize and took us in. Made it seemed like they had available tables already without even calling us. Anyways, our waiter sat us down (pretty nice lady btw) took our drinks order. Then moved forward into taking our orders at around 9:30 p.m. We got appetizers and ordered our food as well so it wouldn't take much time. And from then, everything went down the drain. We literally got our food 1 hour after!!!!! UNBELIEVABLE! & to top it off my sister-in-law & cousin ordered the Filet Mignon (medium well) and when they got their food it was the nastiest steak i've ever seen in my life. Super dry and with no taste. WAY over cooked. We asked for them to re do it, and they said it will only take about 7 to 9 minutes, we didn't receive those plates until 20 minutes after! Overall this was the worst experienced ever!! -NEVER coming back here again."
