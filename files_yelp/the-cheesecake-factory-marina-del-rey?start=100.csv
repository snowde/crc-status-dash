Anca T.,"Indio, CA",0,4,,3.0,5/24/2017,"Every time we go we have to wait 30-40 minutes! So this time after waiting 45 minutes to be seated we waited another 30 minutes to be served!! The servers were overwhelmed and exhausted. The table had dirty silverware, the bread( we were told) not ready, and everybody on the edge! I saw the cooks, the servers sweeting and NOT happy! It was like a zoo!  Executives, find a way not to overwork your people!! Maybe take reservations or find a way to have a more relaxing time for everybody including your staff!  After many time going there I give up!"
Jamila H.,"Venice, CA",1,14,7,2.0,6/10/2016,"Came in with a party of 10 for graduation this afternoon. Ordered the hot wings which were good, but the celery had dirt on it. (The photo is posted on this page.) Actual dirt I wiped off with the napkin . My server Mario was awesome. When I told him the deal, he sent the expo/manager over, who is named Mark or Matt, not sure. He told me that the celery and limes they have been getting from their supplier are ""bruised"" and it's only cosmetic. Bruises don't feel gritty and can't be wiped off with a napkin. Don't insult my intelligence with your BS Mark/Matt.  It was super busy, full of large parties for graduation, but Mario kept things moving smoothly. Very polite and attentive service. Mark/Matt and his LIES about that unsanitary food ruined it for me."
Teresa W.,"North Hollywood, CA",1,13,14,1.0,3/27/2017,"I generally love The Cheesecake Factory and it is disheartening to have to leave a less than stellar review but bias aside I have to be honest. So here we go...   To give background, I called a month prior to make reservations considering the size of our party. I was told that no advanced reservations could be made for Saturdays and we would have to put our name in upon arrival and wait. Fine, no gripes there.  This past Saturday (March 25, 2017) I hosted a large group dinner (27 people) at this location. The first person in our party arrived at 5pm and put our name in. I arrived at 5:15pm and spoke with my friend to inquire about the wait. She told me she was quoted 1 - 1 1/2 hrs at the most 2 hours. We agreed to wait. And we did so patiently. At 7pm we still had not been called and there were multiple large groups of 12 that came after us but were being seated.  The person who originally put our name went to the hostess to inquire. She was told that because the size of the group was the reason for the hold up. In response, the person who put our name in requested that the group be broken up so we could eat since 2 hours had already passed. Ten minutes later they sat 10 people from our group and a few minutes later they seated 9 people at two different tables leaving a remainder of 8 people. Keep in mind this is AFTER the ""at most 2 hours"" quoted time.  It was about 7:30pm when I witnessed a group of 12 people who arrived after my group (I know because as I stated earlier we had been waiting for 2 hours) being called to be seated. At this point I am now angered. How is it that we are STILL waiting with a remainder of 8 people yet 12 who came after are being seated. I walk to the hostess and first thanked her for ""attempting to be accommodating"" and specifically said, ""You do not need to wait for a table for the remaining 8 you can split us according to whatever is the next available. At this point we would just like to eat."" She called over Manuel and I told him the same thing. He said no problem. I understand.  He indicated there was another table of 12 about to leave and we could have that one.  I said thank you, however we do not need to specifically wait on that table. We would like what is next available whatever number that is. He said ok.  Fifteen minutes later, the hostess calls the next table (not us) a group for 6. I immediately asked how is it that another group that was not here before us is being seated. I just requested to take the next available table. The hostess calls Manuel. I pose the same question to him. He tells me ""I don't understand how it works.""  I refreshed his memory on the conversation he and I just had and instead of accommodating he brings Jonathan over to speak to me. I again explain the scenario. And expressed my distaste in service.  I told him we had been disrespectful to no one, had waited patiently and at this point were being straight up lied to.  After this conversation Jonathan seated our remaining 8. The time is now 8:15 pm (I know because I looked at my watch).  As my party was seated I spoke to Jonathan who I believe was the highest manager available at the time. I again thanked him for attempting to be accommodating and seat us all together and also reiterated why I was upset. He tried to explain his side by saying other patrons were quoted times and they needed to be seated accordingly. I refreshed his memory that we were already an hour over the time quoted to us AND that Manuel (another manager) had just told us we would have the next available table yet tried to give it to a different party.  Overall I could not believe this experience. We had 27 people who were dining in your restaurant about to spend at least $700 or more and you push us to the side. Jonathan didn't even want to give a courtesy appetizer. I mean for goodness sake we waited 3 hours!! People were walking by saying ""you guys are still waiting, wow!""  Marina del Rey location please get it together. This is NOT the way you treat customers. And please spare the ""we are sorry you had this experience please give us another chance"" response that I have seen posted in response to others. DO something to mend the situation. Empty words are an insult."
Patrice R.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,140,101,3.0,7/20/2016,"I don't know what happened with the avocado egg rolls but I'd stay away from those if you can. I'm a vegetarian so I thought maybe they were cooked in oil which was used to fry other items and contaminated. However, my coworker also felt sick and she eats meat so either we had a bad batch or they were simply bad somehow. Nonetheless, we were a big party/event of 65+ we sat on the patio which was wonderful with a view of the marina. For an entrée I ordered the Chinese salad w/out chicken. It was satisfactory nothing extravagant, but not bad. We also had sweet potato fries which were good. Overall, I'd say the food quality is a 2 to 2.5 for vegetarians as options are limited. My coworkers enjoyed their food though so I'm going to give it a 3 rating. If not for anything else the cheesecake is always remarkable so the view plus the cheesecake earns 3 stars."
Deshawn E.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,4,,3.0,5/8/2017,"Crazy wait times. Got cold fries... but the server was awesome. Without the server I would be much more disappointed.  Anyways, the food is good and tasty but I don't know if I can return to this place, it's way too crowded and chaotic."
Linda L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1,20,40,3.0,4/2/2017,"They should have gender neutural bathrooms as there are very small ones with just two stalls, food and service ok"
Ann A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,3/31/2017,"Tasty food and desserts, big portions, great service, low calories menu available, reasonable price. Both self and valet parking are available. One of my favorite spots! Tip: Sit outside for an amazing view of Marina Del Rey. Even when it's cold outside patio heaters will make you feel comfortable."
GeeGee S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,20,4,2.0,7/23/2017,I've been to a lot of cheesecake factories and I love their food usually. This location is a pretty big exception. The service is absolutely horrendous.  Take out is awful- it will come soggy and the takeout person basically threw my food at me.  The eat in is super cluttered and the service is bad.  It's very sad because this is my local cheesecake and i wish it was better !
Ingrid C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",125,3,1,5.0,9/4/2017,I absolutely love coming to this particular Cheesecake. Fast and friendly service. And the food is amazing! I always come with my husband and son and they make my son number one priority by giving him his food first so it can cool down and always asking if we need a booster seat or extra bread for him.
Mary Anne W.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,66,26,3.0,7/13/2017,Beautiful view super busy and I don't like the not bringing water to the table which isn't their fault its California law (darn drought) Chad our sever was fantastic he was super attentive and even checked on my service poodle despite he having a full station. The food was good I got the Sheila salad they forgot the chicken which I also didn't realize until I was paying. Chad was really apologetic and brought it out super fast boxed up. We resisted the cheesecake somehow
Harout H.,"Carlsbad, CA",13,63,108,1.0,7/9/2017,This was the worst experiences my family and I have had so far at this location. I would not even give one star if I had an option. I mean all Cheesecake service sucks and the food is whatever. This visit was horrible my brother had a cheeseburger and the meat had plastic film in it. We spoke to the manager and he didn't even care his words where we use plastic to wrap the meat and stuff like this happens. I was shocked and we returned the meal we didn't even finish the meal and paid and left. This place sucks
Matthew T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,46,10,5.0,7/30/2017,Location location. Great date night venue looking out over the marina. I will say the cocktails absolutely sucked. Guy had no idea what he was doing so I would say stick to beer and wine. But the food was good and the outdoor patio is great.
Tim M.,"El Paso, TX",17,19,5,4.0,8/17/2017,Cheesecake Factory NEVER fails!  The food is always plentiful and so good. This particular location is right on the beach-incredible views and setting. The employees were friendly as you would expect from CF. The one thing I didn't like was the valet parking.  It's the only option based on location but the valet told us it was free.  When we came out they said it was not.  No big deal but would have appreciated a straight answer at the beginning.
Quisha H.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",452,528,935,4.0,9/25/2015,My favorite Cheesecake Factory location even with the mandatory valet parking. I come here every couple of months and the service is always great and have yet to have a dish I didn't like. Also the patio views are spectacular on a sunny day even though you may have to wait a little longer. Really the only downside is that they don't take reservations so definitely not the place to come during peak hours but otherwise great. If you're watching what you eat their Skinnylicous menu is also pretty bomb and allows you to go out with family and friends and order something other than chicken and vegetables :)
Siranus K.,"Glendale, CA",15,3,,1.0,4/5/2017,We had a bad experience at past Sunday we were there with a group of friends I ate Cajun chicken litters taste wasn't right my husband ate bafullo chicken blast we come home he couldn't hold in more he throw up he wasn't feeling on the way we are coming home  My kids love cheesecake we go all the location but this time it wasn't great
Gagik K.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,13,144,1.0,8/8/2017,"It's very bad service. I'm ordered launch,his tell me I need what 10-15 minutes.but I'm wait 45 minutes.they do not cook delicious, but everything looks good ! There are no napkins on the tables..."
Omid S.,"Encino, CA",188,65,95,2.0,10/19/2016,"Service at this location keeps getting worse every time we come for dinner. We waited longer for our food than it took to eat this last time we went.  Manager even saw us from across the way that we were getting restless after 20mins of waiting, came by apologized about the delay and said it would be out shortly.... 15mins later we were served. We expected something for the wait, discount, free cheesecake, something for not  making a big scene as others who had arrived after us got their food well before we did.... got nothing.  Will be thinking twice before coming to this location in the future.  Customer service DEFINITELY needs to be addressed at this Cheesecake location!"
Maru L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,2,1.0,8/7/2017,Rushed service for my experience. Great food and environment but our waiter dint ask if I was done eating and literally took the plate while I was still eating...sadly I dint like the way I was served...
Lorine M.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,19,3,3.0,8/6/2017,"I love to come to this restaurant because of the view but the wait is so crazy. I just don't understand why is it that they always close the entire downstairs section, when they have so many people waiting, I wish the can keep the downstairs open and hire more employees to service the people, and you can't make reservations. There Mangment need to look into this!!! Because it's sad that I see people leave all the time."
Alan B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5,143,153,4.0,8/30/2015,"Living in the South Bay, we hadn't been to this location since my daughter worked there while attending USC in the 90's. That said,  we arrived at 6 as did our friends, to a very crowded waiting room! Just as the one in Redondo is at times and our wait last night was 50 minutes. Getting to our table is when we all got comfortable and really started to enjoy the evening.  Our waitress did an outstanding job! She happened to be very pregnant, think she mentioned 29 weeks, anyway our drinks came quickly followed by ordering dinner which also came quick enough, within 20-25 minutes. My Pork Chop was delicious as was my wife's steak Diane. Our friends enjoyed the Rib Eye, Chicken Marsala & the Vegan Salad, all very good. After 21/2 hours our evening came to an end with our stomach's full and a great night out with old friends. Btw, as we were leaving, now close to 9:30 the wait was even longer then what we experienced, however knowing what we did, no one waiting would be disappointed!!"
