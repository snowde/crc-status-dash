Christian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,23,,1.0,10/22/2016,"This has been a place of choice for my family and I throughout the years, but it managed to disappoint me all around. First we were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait. After an hour we asked the host again if we could get an estimated time to get a table and she responded with a terrible attitude. Food wasn't terrible, but not worth the $100 we ended up paying. Mostly bland and tasteless. The highlight of our meal was the bread. Not worth the wait. We weren't even in the mood for desert.  We told our waitress how horrible our experience had been and told us she would ask for the manager. The Manager didn't even have the guts to face us. The waitress told us there was nothing they could do.  We have been coming here for years but I will never return. Too bad."
Kimmy H.,"Culver City, CA",402,207,2461,3.0,8/22/2015,"The firecracker salmon roll portions are inconsistent every time we go back the firecracker salmon rolls are smaller and sometimes larger.... The Buffalo blast hardly had any chicken in them, I think we came on a bad night normally these items are really good. And the proportions are substantial. Enjoy!"
Kay T.,"Los Angeles, CA",262,167,40,4.0,6/25/2016,Why would you go to any other cheesecake factory? Sometimes you're searching for that new up and coming hole in the wall gem. But let's be real. That can get soooooooooo effing tiring. And the disappointments! Sometimes you just want to go to a chain where you know everything is standardized.  I really wish they didn't take away my sun-dried tomato chicken fettuccine.  Got the arugula fig flat bread. Pretty filling!  Their portions are huge. I'm pretty sure my friends chicken parmesan sandwich had three chicken breasts. That's insane.  Best part is the view. Other than that it's pretty standard cheesecake factory experience. I've never been to a cheesecake factory with such a nice marina view. I like it better that the SF one in Union square. Sit on the patio. Soak it in!
Dennis C.,"Los Angeles, CA",172,477,23,4.0,11/18/2016,The food is amazing. Needs more variety and perhaps an overhaul in some categories. I very much like sitting outside I feel like this location along with the one near redondo are the best because of the views. What I dont like about this location? The valet service is a ripoff. I can park my own car and frankly get it out on my own. The valet service failed in so many ways on my visit here. The wait is also a factor that seemed to turn away people. Its long and the waiting area is very cramped. The decor is nice. Service by the staff is great and friendly. Food was quick and very delicious.
Marina M.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,4,1,1.0,8/8/2017,"I normally don't like to leave negative reviews but I had the worst experience here.  On July 29th a group of friends and family decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for a birthday dinner. It was a Saturday so I get it, there is a wait etc. we got to the Cheesecake Factory at around 6:40 and we're told it would be about an hour to an hour and 40 mins which we said was ok. Closer to 8pm we asked and the first person we asked said they were signing the for bill, 20mins later we asked again they said the same table was finishing dessert !?! But I thought they were finishing up with the bill. Then closer to 9 we were told they were opening gifts and if we wanted we can split the group and sit in separate tables! We came as a group for a birthday!! Once we got seated almost 3 hours later, the waiter spilled ice water on my friends mother she was yelling and they just said sorry. Manager looked and said ok I'll give you guys free calamari. They didn't bother to ask if she was ok if she needed anything didn't even turn on the outside heater. Our waitress was horrible didn't ask if we needed anything we had to repeat ourselves. Then remind her who ordered what. Who ever replaced her during her break was amazing we wanted him to stay. But sadly he was only covering for her but in that short break he was able to lift up our spirits with his positive vibes. We had to end the night early but they were giving us a hard time cause we needed to spilt the bill and they didn't want to do it more than 3 ways. I'm glad I was able to leave closer to 10:40, sadly the rest of the group stayed till nearly midnight.  I will never go back to this location."
Hector V.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,5,,1.0,10/28/2017,Terrible service!!! Food was cold. Really angry that I had to pay for the bad food and service. Never going to a Cheesecake Factory again
Ann R.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",9,3,6,5.0,7/16/2017,I went there with family for dinner. The foods are  good and service is the best. Their staffs are friendly and eager to help each other. They trained all staffs very well indeed. I really like this place and can't wait to come back again and again.
jIM B.,"Northridge, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/17/2017,"The food and service were as expected.  In our case, we enjoy the Cheesecake Factory, and this was no different.  Why 2 stars.  We've been going to this location for many years, and the parking process was:  If you have a handicapped placard, and if there is a space available, there is no charge.  If the valet has to park the car, there is (now $6.50--a bit outrageous, I'd say).  I understand that, and I accept it.  This last time, the valet had to park my car.  Why?  They had parked a new Porsche in the handicapped space.  When I asked about it, I was told, ""He's only in there for a minute.""  I asked why he didn't park in the pick-up spot, and got no response.  I complained that I would have to pay, when there really was a spot available.  I was told that everyone now pays.  OK.  When we were done, and left, there was now a new Bentley parked there with no placard &/or disabled license plate.  I told the attendant to move the car, or I would call the police.  He did, but glared at me the entire time. Please don't go to this location that has such lack of concern for the disabled and handicapped"
Erika M.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"Had the worst experience here ever! I went in yesterday I was sat at 5:50pm, happy hour ended at 6. No one greeted me until 6:10pm. One server put in my order (and got it all wrong) but wasn't my server in the end. I didn't know they had even switched. The new server rushes past and slams 2 lemonades on the table, no napkins, water or bread at 6:25pm. However we had ordered an ice tea and a margarita. The manager came and we told him, he apologized and made the comment that he had 2 capable servers and had no idea why they weren't on it. We ordered sliders no onions, pasta with extra sauce and stuffed mushrooms. My pasta came out before the bread with NO SAUCE (all the sauce on the side) by itself. No sliders and my appetizers no where in sight. The manager again apologized and took my plate back. The mushrooms arrived cold-warm and the sliders had tons of onions. At this point I was over it. My pasta was brought out correct and by this time it had been an hour of dealing with issues. When the appetizers arrived we had to ask for bread and utensils. When I asked for the check they charged me full price for everything. Happy hour items full price even though the first server said he would get us the HH price since we had to wait so long to order. Long story short after all this.. the manager gave me $1.00 off for our inconvenience. WTF! ONE DOLLAR! Worst manager (STEVEN), servers, staff.. ever!"
Chris J.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,21,,2.0,10/18/2017,"I just had a salad here for lunch - it was supposed to be a beet salad with cheese & nuts. I got a plateful of salad out of a bag, two nuts, two small pieces of cheese and two pieces of beet. It was the worst I have had anywhere!"
Londie L.,"Long Beach, CA",11,53,151,5.0,12/22/2016,This is by far my favorite cheesecake factory!! Yes since it is a chain the food menu is the same but... the staff is so great and that view!! I just love it..
Tiffany G.,"Lawndale, CA",125,56,80,5.0,6/15/2017,"Came here last week for my little cousins graduation and I have to say it really was a great place to celebrate something special like that. Unfortunately we did wait over two hours for a party of ten but it could be because everyone was going there for graduations and there were a lot of big parties that night. They did allow us to wait in their outdoor patio and order drinks and appetizers. Already frustrated with our wait time, we came in upset from being so hungry. Iman, however, made our visit more than pleasant. He was very enthusiastic and made us feel so much better about everything. He was definitely an excellent example of great customer service even as we were walking out the door to leave. Made the environment way more welcoming than the girls at the front. Iman really is all about his guests and that is very much appreciated."
Rebecca S.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,14,,1.0,10/4/2016,I called in to make a reservation on a Saturday (gave the date of the party) I was informed to call back. They only make reservations two weeks in advance. When I called back to make the reservation. They informed me that they do not take reservations on the weekend. I was told to come in 2-3 hours before the event and put my name on the list.  Clearly some miscommunication with their staff members and the managers who both had contradictory statements.
CheRon R.,"Inglewood, CA",233,5,,1.0,6/15/2017,They took a 3 hour to get my food and my family was really upset. The food was horrible. l was not happy with that. Our appetizer's came out after our main dishes. Some of our appetizer's were missing and not fully cooked. I wouldn't give them a star if I had a option. The manager kept making excuses and they said they only had one chef for night. That is not my problem.
Sofia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,26,23,1.0,9/14/2016,"This review is for the service and how we were treated at our visit.  We love to go here and always did it at special occasions with my friend that was visiting town. So after not have being here for about a year we decided to have one last night out here before she returned home from her vacation. We were a party of 7 and already when ordering a table the girl looking for a table was being rude in her attitude. It was a Tuesday night around 8.30 and not too crowded.  The service was NOT in any ways okay. We ordered simple drinks, water, wine and beer. Nothing hard or time consuming. The 3 waters came out, we waited. Appetizers came out before ANY drinks at all and we probably waited 20-30 minutes for a lemonade, 2 wine and 1 beer. Oh and yes they forgot the coke zero. The red wine was too warm assuming they had just ignored carrying out the drinks in time. We didn't get any of the dark breads and when we asked the waiter said ""no they hferklgmösgmnls"" and he left. No one could hear or understand what he said and he didn't even care about the fact that we had waited probably 40 minutes for the bread at all. I don't eat the white bread because I don't like it and we were never bought any dark bread even after asking. So, I was STARVING, annoyed by the fact that the service had been so bad and just cranky.  Oh food finally, we thought. we got 3 of the meals and waited politely for everyone to get their meals. You would think they would bring out everything at the same time right? Nope! Same as the drinks something came, something had to be waited for, and of course.... One meal had been screwed up so she got a small bowl of veggies but not her tacos and had to wait for her food even longer while everyone else had gotten their foods.  Yes, desert time. Not everyone could order cheesecake so we need up only ordering 3 of them. Waited another 20 minutes for 3 cheesecakes to be boxed up and the check.  Did i mention that not once did any of the 3 waiters approaching our table ask if we were okay, apologizing for all the mistakes and waits we had experienced and all they said was ""Thank you for understanding and being patient."" NO we did not understand WHAT was taking so long and no we were NOT patient we were all hungry and cranky.  Will probably NOT go back here again, at least not to the Marina location."
Candy L.,"Fairfax, CA",1,4,23,5.0,1/15/2017,"Amazing dinner by the beach with my bf. Love our main course, absolutely delicious! Oh and the Oreo cheesecake we get...the best way to end my 2 weeks trip in CA!"
Kit L.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,83,20,3.0,6/18/2017,"The parking is insane even though we have valet. We ordered lunch plate and they were huge!  The meatloaf is great,  we love it. Beautiful place to have your meal by the beach if we can get through the parking."
Glen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,68,,1.0,7/13/2017,"Hmmm!  3 Stars!  Now I know why. My family went there for dinner and was served a meal that was over cooked. We brought it up to the waitress and she did nothing!  Then they switched waitress' and the next waitress was terrific. She brought over the manager and we discussed the issue and the manager was not very apologetic and had an attitude. He did not remove the meal from our check but after a while offered us a $10 dollar credit. What a jerk!  My family will not be eating there anymore. You know how the saying goes...  a problem is the fastest way to inform 10 people how bad your restaurant is. So, for a few bucks, this guy just lost our business.  Dumb!!!"
Angela H.,"Kiama Downs, Australia",0,9,5,5.0,10/21/2017,Love the Cheesecake Factory! Went for dinner- was a beautiful night! So much food!! I had Cheesecake for dinner- and that was enough. My partner had the pasta- it was so big we could have shared it with the 4 of us! Service was so incredibly friendly- I wish we got her name as she was so nice I would love to compliment her personally!
K S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,348,,4.0,10/9/2017,"The chain holds up better than most any chain... My lunch today was sensational and made all the better by Brandon, the professional server who is friendly, affable and enjoys smiling.... The menu is extensive and everything tastes fresh... Brandon it's a real asset to the company...(I have absolutely zero connections to this organization... Just a local customer)"
