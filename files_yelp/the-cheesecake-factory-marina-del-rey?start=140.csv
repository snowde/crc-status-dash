Amit L.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,189,52,5.0,5/9/2016,"What is there not to like about Cheesecake Factory? Every time I come here I feel a sense of joy and the urge to indulge in everything off their menu!  I love it's location. There's something about dining by the harbor that makes everything that much grander.  This spot is always packed. Sometimes you have to rub elbows with each other just to wait for a table.  The staff is super nice...very polite and courteous. My party and I waited 10 minutes to be seated. We were seated in the patio, giving us a priceless view of Mother's Beach.  The amount of items on the menu here are endless! Out of a zillon things, I ordered the Fried Shrimp Sandwich. The flavor from the sriracha aoli gave the sandwich a nice spicy kick. The shrimp was absolutely crispy and buttery. It was very delicious!  The cheesecakes are TO DIE FOR! I have almost tried every cheesecake here (and lived to write this review...lol.) I can say there is no better cheesecakes made out there (and sold at any restaurants or stores) that could be any better than what the Cheesecake Factory offers...unless you are in NYC. Than the Cheesecake quality turns up a notch or two!  Above all else, This location is a very clean, busy, and friendly establishment. I recommend this spot for any occasion. I believe you should experience a sunset dinner on the patio here in the summertime at least once in your lifetime. You will never regret any part of your experience. 5 stars all around!"
Tomica B.,"Powder Springs, GA",7,21,,3.0,6/23/2017,"Ate outside and the view was very nice. It was a breezy day, and there were plenty of heaters to make our meal comfy. Service was good, and my Kale and quinoa salad with shrimp was really good. The grilled cheese on the kids menu was really good too."
Dro E.,"Glendale, CA",0,24,2,4.0,7/6/2017,"I always go to the cheescake located in glendale,CA, and I had never been to this location; however, because of the view, i decided to come all the way from glendale to Marina del Rey. Let me start off with letting everyone know how aggressive staff of valet pariking are. The very first moment we turned into the parking the valet prking guy started screaming ""its $6.5 its SIXANAHALF DOLLA, YOU NEED TO PAY ITS NOT FREE PARKING."" first of all these guys need to chill out, even though $6.50 for a self parking is a lot, im not as much as upset that i am for their rude screaming and asking for money. We definitely wasnt gonna park and run away if we knew it wasnt free. Maybe this location need to train those rude workers and let them know that they arent catching people who are trying to climb and jump over the America-Mexico Great WALL! I wouldnt say the hostess was the best, either, she didnt even say hi and waited 'till i ask her if she works here and could maybe help us,perhaps!!!! The waiter was nice and made good suggestions on the manu. Food was pretty good especially the burger. The heaters in patio were just for one side of the table so one of us shud sacrifice himself for the other. One could enjoy the view and the other experience the ICE AGE.  But the price we paid over all for the parking and  food was definitely worth it. Will be coming back soon."
Isabel G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,40,5,5.0,6/19/2017,Been to many other cheesecake factory's the service never disappoints specially this one they just go out of their way . It was a very special occasion for us  and they treated us with such .
Suzy K.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",79,49,12,4.0,5/10/2017,Came her with a group of 10 for a birthday party during the week. We waited 30 minutes which was ok since they have a nice lounge area by the fire. We sat outside and it was really pretty. Service and food were good. The only con was that the smell of the water was so bad (it would come and go)...it smelled like rotten eggs.
S. M.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,4,,1.0,7/2/2017,"1 of 2... I have NEVER written a review about a restaurant in my life, but I truly felt compelled to do so today. The first time I visited this Cheesecake Factory, was last month, for my daughter's birthday. For the most part, the experience was good, so I decided to bring my husband back today for his birthday. And, I must say that this was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. My family, friends and I have no desire to ever return there again. I'll start from the beginning. I called the restaurant around 1:30pm, and asked if I could make a reservation. I was told that they do not accept reservations on the weekends. ""Okay. How long is the wait?"" I ask. ""There is no wait right now,"" was the reply. With that, my party of 9 left church, en route to the restaurant. When we arrive, no more than 25 minutes later, the wait is now 1 hour. Wait. What?!? As anyone who has ever visited this restaurant knows, making the choice to leave or stay becomes a tough decision, because you have to valet your car. Or cars, in our case. Three of the people in my party have trouble getting around, so we decide to wait it out. And boy did we wait and wait. (SIDE BAR: During our ""wait time,"" I went to the women's restroom to discover that it only has two stalls; both of which were dirty. The stall that became available when it was finally my turn, was the size of an airplane restroom and is situated next to the lone sink. So, if someone is washing their hands, the stall could not be accessed freely. So, I waited again.) Once I made it out, two people in my party had inquired about what could be taking so long to get a table. Our hour had come and gone. We waited another 15 minutes. Someone must have finally felt sorry for us, because we were digging through our purses and bags for trail mix and mints. We were lead to our table through an endless maze of foot traffic. Things were looking up, we thought. We sat down and quickly placed our drink orders with the waitress. I asked for apps for the entire group, so that we could have something to nibble on while we decided on our orders. My party was so excited when the drinks started coming out, we were finally getting the ball rolling. I was deep in conversation, as our drinks (which mostly consisted of lemonades, soft drinks and water), were being placed in front of us. Until suddenly: WOOSH! My head, back and bottom were shocked by what seemed like the coldest feeling imaginable. The drink server had dropped his entire tray on me. My head, back and bottom were soaked. I gasped in horror. Everyone at my table was mortified for me. Servers, waitresses and managers rushed to me with napkins and towels, desperately trying to gauge my response. The server apologized repeatedly. Long story short, I held it together, and the manager offered me free dry cleaning. Okay. We continued on. Get bread. Order food. Fresh/new drinks. Then suddenly my friend tells the group in horror: ""I think I just drank chipped glass."" What?!? She had ordered a strawberry milkshake. She informed our waitress and another manager came over to us. It was determined that yes, her drink had glass in it. Again I say, What?!? What is going on? I'm thinking, we need to get out of here. We need to just leave. Can this get any worse? Again, my party wanted to forge ahead. It's my husband's birthday. We're hungry. We're already two hours in and my friend says she feels fine. Okay, we'll stay. We wait and wait. Finally the apps come out. Yes! We're starving. We quickly devour them. Drink refills. Still no entrees. We wait and wait. And then finally, the food slowly starts to come out. My husband and I get our food first and the group, almost in unison says: ""Please don't wait for us!"" And, thank God we didn't. It would be another 15 minutes before the last person in our party gets their food. Everyone is finally eating, which is uneventful for the most part. My food was good/fine. But, do you remember my friend with the milkshake? She has to send her food back, because her meat was under cooked. Really under cooked. She taps out. She wants nothing else. At this point, she's just waiting for the rest of us to finish. We finish up. Sing Happy Birthday, and it's time to pay the check. My friend's milkshake and food are comp'd. Me, on the other hand, am fully charged for my meal. Really? While I'm still sitting here soaking wet? From my head to me feet? AND, I just discovered that my purse, which was sitting on the floor, is also soaked inside and out? Maybe I'm foolish for thinking my meal was going to automatically be comp'd after what happened to me. At any rate, the waitress talks to the manager, and gets my meal is comp'd. To be continued..."
MaryJ N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,31,160,2.0,6/10/2017,"The absolute worst experience I had at this place in Marina Del Rey.  Not saying it's like this all the time but it was like this today 6.10.17  The server took forever , left us waiting.   The food was incorrect, cold and the mashed potatoes came with a whole potatoes.  There was water under the table and we know only because when my cousin kicked me out was wetok.  We srnt a drink back 3 times.   The manager was understanding and the new server was bomb.   That's why they got 2 stars. They adjusted the check and still added someone else's drinks to our check.  One Bathroom stall out of order and it's only 2 stalls.  SMH..."
Lisa B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,2,5.0,6/21/2017,"good service good food and a big shoutout  to the person that turned my wallet in. I got home and realized I lost it and ,cheesecake  factory said someone found it and turned it in.thank god"
Monica T.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,32,37,4.0,5/7/2017,"There was a 45 minute wait but we sat at the bar bc we were in a time crunch to catch a movie. Our server was attentive and had a great attitude! It was pleasant to have good customer service when it's a busy time of day. I ordered the fried mac and cheese balls and they have been tastier at other CF. Always love the brown bread at any Cheesecake Factory I go to, especially when it's fresh baked!!"
Beyza B.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,8,19,1.0,7/3/2017,"Unfortunately my last time at Cheesecake Factory was a terrible experience. First of all I have to say that this place's location has a really good view and I have always loved the light decoration they did. However, service was terrible! I went there with my family and family friends to celebrate birthdays of two people in the group. So we were 11 people. And our waiter whose name is Ronald did a terrible job.  - We asked drinks to come with foods but we were about to finish the meal when he brought them. And there were only 3 drinks so it shouldn't have taken that much of time - We asked for ranch sauce or mayo but he never brought it - He brought appetizers too late. We had to asked them twice after he brought main courses  - He didn't take empty glasses on the table. He should have taken them before taking our dessert order. When he brought cheesecakes, the table was a mess! - We were there for birthday celebration for two people and I know that normally waiters sing happy birthday when they bring the cake however, singing didn't happen and this guy didn't even bother to light up the candles! - He put all the coffees on one side of the table he didn't bother to serve them person by person and for this reason, we mixed up which one is decaf which one is a normal coffee - My 3 year-old nephew broke a glass and he didn't clean it up! Glass particles were there and one of us could get hurt especially my nephew! - At the end of the dinner, when one of us gave voice to our complaints, he refused all of the complaints and was very rude.  After awhile, he came back and spoke with the kindest guy in the group and apologized to him. He couldn't even apologize to the person who told him about the complaints!"
Kristin S.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",95,26,22,4.0,5/4/2017,Elias our server is fantastic. His kNowledge of the menu and his charismatic way of working the table did not go unnoticed! Thank you Cheese cake for a wonderful lunch! The tuna tartar of the skinny small plates was perfect!
De'Mar S.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,24,3,3.0,9/19/2016,"Came here for my birthday. The food, the atmosphere was great. This was my first time at the C.Factory so I was excited. It would have been perfect experience if it wasn't for my server not on top of his job. Waited for our drinks twice for longer than what we should have. He even said himself that he was in another situation that pulled him away from us for some time. Ha!  I would go a second time no doubt, just not with the same server."
edgar t.,"Diamond Bar, CA",9,15,10,2.0,10/2/2016,"So I was there Wednesday night on September 21st.  Some relatives had came over to visit. Because it was last minute (and because usually we enjoy The Cheese Cake Factory at another location), we decided to try out this location since it was the the closest location at the time.  Let me start by saying that it was a big party-seventeen of us to be exact. So I understood that when we got there, we were going to have to wait. I didn't mind at all that we waited 2.5 hours to get seated. At first it was like every other Cheesecake Factory; They sat us down and our waiter was nice and patient. Our food was served at a timely manner as well. Towards the end though when my father wanted a refill a coffee, he was told that there wasn't anymore coffee.  The manager came and specifically let us know that gratuity was not included in the check and asked us to take care of the waiter. I found that a little bit rude, but yet I still took care of him due to our party size.  And then as we were leaving, I wanted a piece of cheesecake to take home. There were two workers there next to the dessert display and I felt no amount of courtesy as I was standing there waiting there for a couple minutes; waiting for them to offer to help me.  I heard them complain about the other guests (very unprofessional) and one of them looked at me and I told them ""I would like to purchase a cheesecake please"" and they said,"" Sorry we're closed"" and returned to their gossiping. Then I noticed the manager walking behind me. I told him I would like to purchase a cheesecake (keep in mind this is the same manager that a couple minutes ago had no problem taking the expensive paid bill of 17 people that I just handed him). His response was ""Sorry that section is closed"".  Very disappointed. Where's the customer service? Being that I own a business of my own, it is a rule that as long as a customer is there, we make sure that he is taken care of. I wanted to complain, but this was the manager! I couldn't believe it.  As far as the food, just go to another Cheesecake Factory location, because the service from this one will leave a bad taste in your mouth."
Tucker B.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,14,6,1.0,5/1/2017,"This use to be my go to place for dinner and special occasions. I started going to the grove. However, my recent trip here was regrettable. I should of known better than to chance a special occasion.. I was not impressed by the service. Our first waiter was not attentive, she had a horrible attitude and did not come check on the table for a long period of time. When she did come check in the table, she snatched items off the table. When I requested another waiter, the manager was very accommodating, but the service was still lacking. The food took very long to come out, while other patrons were being serviced, we were left waiting. When I was ready for the check I had to ask more than three times, which took about 30 minutes."
Arilee B.,"Inglewood, CA",35,40,14,3.0,5/1/2017,"Poor service.....slow with attending to the guest and following up fir refills. Food and appetizers took too long to come out. Had to wait too long check to come. Manager John did attempt to make it better , but improvement wasn't still lacking. Otherwise, good was good, but it did take long to come out"
Matt P.,"Anaheim, CA",3,12,,1.0,4/23/2017,"Worst dining experience I have ever had.  We had a party of 8 and they quoted us 1 hour. They called our buzzer right at one hour and told us it was an accident that they called us.  After 2 full hours of waiting we decided to take tables in the bar area. We finally got some food ordered, food came for everyone except for 2 people. It took over 15 minutes for the rest of the food to come out, once it came out, both of the orders were completely wrong!  10 or so minutes later, they brought them back out and yet again, one of the two were STILL wrong!"
Sonte W.,"La Habra, CA",13,4,1,2.0,8/18/2016,"I was so excited to go to the factory for my 40 th birthday. Not my first time. I have been going to this location for 20 years. I ordered take out do to me not feeling like dining in. Which took a hour. So I order Jambalaya with rice. Which now they charge extra for rice. Then I order zucchini appetizer and red velvet cheesecake. Well the jambalaya had pasta, the zucchini was hard and barely edible! So my husband took it back. They scooped the 5 shrimp and. 5 pieces of chicken of the pasta and put it on a bed of rice really! My husband took it back again. Manager gave refund for jambalaya and piece of cheesecake for free. I felt like more effort should be put into food being excellent. I appreciate the refund but eould have loved to have my meal! This will be my last time at this location! Reason for two stars is chessecake is fabulous!"
Alison M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/24/2017,"Rude host on staff. Won't be coming back as the restaurant was unaccommodating to our family. Usually love this chain, but this place was a severe disappointment."
Igor K.,"Inglewood, CA",0,5,,4.0,6/2/2017,I want there few  times now and i like happy hour with good deals . Mai tai is Great and Fried mac n cheese usually very good and of couse cheese cakes are the best
Mario P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,3,5.0,8/19/2016,Awesome experience! As we walked inside  cheese cake factory my friend I had the awesome experience to be greeted by Joe the restaurant manager! He is amazing! Extremely nice and with great customer service! Gorgeous smile! Super handsome! He sat us right away in table . The food was well served and the food had a great taste! My pasta was Delicious. To make the experience even better Joe took the time to pass by our table real quick to see how we were doing. I wish every restaurant had more managers like Joe! I highly recommend this cheese cake location to everyone.
