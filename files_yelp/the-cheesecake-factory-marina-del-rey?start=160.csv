Margo J.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,53,9,4.0,10/14/2016,Went to the Cheesecake Factory at the Marina recently.  Haven't been there in years. Decided to try the Spaghetti.  The best spaghetti I've had in years! It was reminiscent of the Olde Spaghetti Factory in Hollywood. (my favorite spaghetti) Everything about it was great. The meatballs were humongous and so tasty and the sauce and spaghetti were great. My friend had the chicken and biscuits and loved it. The service was great. I tried the banana cream cheesecake and was by far the best cheesecake I've ever had. I will no longer be a stranger.
Tanisha B.,"Culver City, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/9/2017,"Today, I visited the Marina location to celebrate my daughter graduating. The restaurant was busy with many other families celebrating as well. We had a party of five, however, ""Anthony"" at check-in provided quick service and was very courteous, professional and accommodating. I observed him greet all the guest with a welcoming smile! Anthony thank you for making our experience an AWESOME one today!"

Garrett F.,"Uptown, Denver, CO",1,9,,5.0,6/4/2017,"Yes, it it's a cheesecake factory, yes the food and service is exactly like every other cheesecake factory.  What makes this place great is the beach side seating. When you get there, don't even go in the front door, walk down towards the beach to the entry for the patio restaurant, there's usually no wait and you feel like you are literally eating on the beach!"
Maggie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,5,5.0,5/15/2017,Came in to eat with my parents and brother the day after Mother's Day. Vanessa our waitress was very nice and attentive . The food was delicious as expected. This place is one of my favorite spots in Marina Del Rey. I got proposed here! Thank you Vanessa for your great customer service.
Linda Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",18,335,510,4.0,2/11/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I really do. Whether it's the avocado eggrolls or the warm bread on the table, it's always a good time. Well. Usually.  Cheesecake Factory? You have broken my heart by removing the Thai Chicken Pasta from the menu. I know it's been more than a year since that item was removed from the menu, but it still breaks my heart every time I go in to one of the CF restaurants and can't have my absolutely favorite menu item ever. I mean, it was on the menu for years. YEARS. Why did it have to go? But I digress. My friends and I had a very nice brunch at this location recently. Great weather. Sat out on the patio. (You really should reconsider those chairs, though. We of the boo-tay clan have a difficult time getting comfortable in those wicker-thigh-busters you call chairs.) Sure, we had to adjust and readjust the umbrellas to avoid retinal damage and skin cancer, but it was worth it. Oh, so worth it. Our server (whose name I have forgotten .. sorry) was really nice and incredibly friendly. Just the right amount. Not overly-fakey-fakey, not aloof. The food was good. (except for the whole lack-of-thai-chicken-and-pasta fiasco) The cocktails were AMAZEBALLS. And the view? Perfection. Who doesn't want to enjoy fresh air, fresh food, boozy drinks, and a view of people doing yoga on paddle boards?"
Meg F.,"Glendale, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/23/2017,My previous visits here were ok however we had a bad experience this time. We ordered mild guacamole which was tasteless. I was looking forward to my food but there was a hair stuck to my pasta!! very disgusting!!! They offered an exchange and I ordered a Togo salad instead. Our waiter Mario was ok but he didn't compensate us for their crappy food he just waived the hairy pasta. On top of it Restrooms were very dirty and very small. Had to wait in line for 15 minutes with a 4 year old. Never coming back here again!!!
Matt E.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,2,2.0,9/1/2017,"We've been here many times. Pretty good food, great location. However this time, they ""misplaced"" our order and it took 45 minutes to get our drinks and an hour to get the food.  Hungry kids waiting an hour for food is no fun."
S. C.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,56,22,1.0,4/3/2017,"Yesterday was the worst experience we had at the Marina dl Rey location.  Sad to say 2 of us couldn't keep our food down because the meat of the sliders had an odd taste and my friends cajun chicken wasn't cooked. Our daughter had the chicken sliders and felt nauseas after the first slider as well. Our 4th friend who had the cajun chicken had to send it  back after the first one she felt sick too. We had nachos to start with, which was all tortilla chips and barely any cheese. The best was the lemon drop and the bread. We were looking forward for a nice meal and to end it with some dessert. No dessert but vomiting and a lots of sour stomaches! Will I go back? Not until they start getting a descent chef and better service!"
Jen H.,"Austin, TX",6,19,1,1.0,6/20/2016,After waiting an hour to be seated we ordered appetizers and drinks .  After about 40 min another server came out and said our server had gone on break and they wanted to know what we ordered. We reordered our appetizers and informed them that no one had taken our entree order.  Another 20 min and our 2 appetizers appeared . We started eating and realized one was wrong. We notified a server who immediately took away the wrong food instead of just letting us eat it while the correct one was made . An hour and a half later our entrees showed up.  Our second server said she notified management but no one came to apologize or offer a complimentary dessert or anything.  Worst experience
marvi j.,"Inglewood, CA",0,11,,5.0,8/28/2017,"I placed a large order over the phone for 10 people, all with special requests. When I arrived Saturday around 5pm, Alicia was just starting her shift. She greeted me with a smile, and repeated everything I ordered over the phone. She assisted me by walking me out to my car, and even went as far as help me put everything securely. Most importantly,she gave me extra bread and butter. I appreciate her professionalism and great attitude."
Loree K.,"Los Angeles, CA",267,129,276,1.0,7/17/2017,"Never. Ever. Ever Again. As a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory as a no-brainer go to (virtually anywhere) I feel extremely disappointed in my experience over the past weekend at this particular location. First and foremost, I am very aware of the long wait times at all cheesecakes and this review has nothing to do with the initial wait time. As this location is a beachfront location we decided to sit in the beachfront portion which is partially separated from the main portion. After about 45 minutes of waiting, we were seated. I went to the women's bathroom and it was a one stall bathroom which was filthy. We notified the restaurant. After being seated our waiter came to take the order. I had to repeat myself several times because he didn't want to write anything down on paper. Also, he acted very odd when we asked for simple requests. Our first request was a bread basket. It took us 55 minutes and asking two waiters maybe 7 times to get the bread basket. Second, I ordered a glass of wine. My wine came in a dirty glass. Since our waiter was long gone my mother decided to take my glass back to the bar to get it changed. After swapping the cup, the bartender told her to tell the waiter and that they should bring another glass on the house. We put in our order and after the 55 minutes when we got our bread we got a notification from the waiter that one of the items we ordered is sold out (which was just grilled artichokes btw). Ok great, tell us after an hour. I opened my napkin and silverware to find that my fork had a very disgusting unidentified something on it. I called another waiter and complained since ours was nowhere to be found. He then made a face himself and took the fork and promised me plastic silverware for me and my family (which never came). The food came all wrong, my aunts margarita had pickled jalapeños on it, and everything tasted not as good as it usually tastes. The waiter brought me another glass of wine after my father had to explain to him that it was dirty and explained to him that the bartender said that it should be replaced. Literally no common courtesy to replace it without an explanation. The waiter was the most odd waiter I have ever had. None of the waiters were communicating with each other either. When we asked for anything it took so long to get it that we just wanted to get out of there. They never cleaned the table they barely wanted to bring us anything we asked for. I felt as if the waiter thought it was a chore. At the end, we got our check and the waiter had TRIPLE charged my wine, which was dirty in the first place, after he brought me a second one. Anyway, we complained to the manager about the check and I started to vent about how its just been an extremely terrible experience. He apologized and told me I should have told him earlier. To end this review, I would like to say that due to the lack of cleanliness that I witnessed in those few hours I would never recommend that anyone I know go here until they fix these issues. As far as customer service goes, the staff definitely needs some help with that. Never at any other cheesecake factory (and I have been to a lot) have I experienced anything like this."
Ashley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,10,2,1.0,4/11/2017,"I have never had a bad experience here but today everything was horrible.  The bread was cold, my food wasn't cooked and the waiter Chris was the worst.  I am so disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Susie M.,"Newbury Park, CA",104,6,1,2.0,5/15/2017,Unfortunately I hate to put this down as 2 stars but the service here seems to be getting from bad to worse than ever!! Waited 15 minutes before we even got water then we order receive food from another server our waitress finally check on us 1 hour later... that was after we chase down manager for more water & tea! So... food always good but expect to have crappy service! Maybe they need to hire help??
Sebastian K.,"Martinez, CA",67,6,1,1.0,4/24/2017,"My bill was $130 & I still tipped them 18% because the food was delicious... Beautiful atmosphere but the service was disappointing.. our appetizers came out at the same time our entrees.. sure it happens and I forgive them but the thing that keeps bothering me, even 2 days after, is that one food runner's comment that I'll never forget. ( As the appetizers and entrees come out and he's holding them ) & we said something like this is disappointing because our entrees are pretty big so we'd like to take some time to digest our appetizers before we grub on the entrees. THIS GUY SAYS........ "" oh would you like me to pack your appetizers to go and just leave you guys your entrees now?? "" ......... LOL are you kidding me? Sadly I'm never coming there again because of his comment. Such a shame."
Glenn A.,"Venice, CA",112,54,11,4.0,9/4/2016,Cheesecake Factory at Marina Del Rey is one of our go to spots. It's at Mother's beach so if you have a little one you can expend energy at the playground there. Food is always going to be good at Cheesecake. But what I was surprised with is that their Ribeye steak was actually pretty good! Service is great. Had a little issue with my daughter's fries and the manager came to us and made sure we were okay. Plus you can't beat the view!
Richard O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/23/2017,"I must say I'm not surprised to see so many 2 star reviews. My experience was so bad that I am taking the time out of my afternoon to create a yelp account to let others know about the service at the cheesecake factory's location in Marina. I was served an undercooked dish. I understand that they are busy but this is putting the health of the customers at risk and it is unacceptable. The management is clearly lacking and I do believe that they would be better off without Justin, he is really making this place go downhill. I hope they look at all the bad reviews they are receiving and clean up shop and make some much needed changes."
Michele B.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,108,143,1.0,1/18/2017,"Unbelievable! I was with a party of 7, being 3 kids, and 2 of the 4 adults traveling back overseas to their homes, so I wanted to take them out and treat them for dinner at a bay view by the marina. 2:40min later we still haven't being sited because they were putting all parties of 2 in front of us on the patio and the downstairs for some annoying reason that no one knows was closed. My guests couldn't wait anymore since they need to finish packing and go to the airport and left.. I couldn't leave bc it wouldn't be fair with my little ones who was so excited to eat over there and have waited so long already. So upsetting that I called the manager and told him to stop calling parties of 2 and put 3 tables of 2 together and accommodate us. He said:""sounds much easier than what it is"". Seriously? That's the best you can say after 2:40min wait??? Which I was told that would be only 40min????? There is no other restaurant that I repugne than this one... mistreated, terrible wait time, food is super blah, and drinks are almost virgens. Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!"
Jocelyn C.,"Burien, WA",0,9,1,1.0,4/16/2017,"I always depended on Cheesecake Factory restaurants for their excellent service and quality/generous portions of food, but was left very disappointed after our Sunday Easter brunch. Took an hour to get our food and one of the orders was wrong. Our server didn't even check on us while we waited for a food to arrive. When our food came, it was barely warm. Our server told us she notified the manager but after 20 min, we had to ask another server to contact the manager and the manager told us he was just notified the minute prior.. in other words our original server lied to us. She couldn't even bring us hot sauce in a timely manner. Very disappointing that this restaurant chain is becoming subpar and more similar to a Denny's. Save your time and money for another restaurant, we're done here."
