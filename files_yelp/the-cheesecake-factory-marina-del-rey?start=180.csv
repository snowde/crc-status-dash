Amy S.,"Venice, CA",317,697,35,4.0,12/28/2015,"OMG so much food! I highly recommend splitting main dishes as the portions are ginormous! Seated quickly, we had drink orders taken and waters delivered to our table by a very friendly server.  Food was delivered in a timely manner and everything was super yummy. The nachos had a good helping of everything on them and the avocado eggrolls were deliciously crispy on the outside and full of avocado on the inside. I had the herb crusted salmon lunch special. The salmon was very tasty and cooked to perfection. The mashed potatoes were seasoned very well and the asparagus was tasty too. We squished in dessert and ordered the chocolate anniversary cheese cake, the lemon cheesecake, and the apple pie. The cheesecakes had a rich and creamy flavor and the apple pie was delicious! Will defo stop in here again!"
Perry M.,"Tacoma, WA",49,7,4,5.0,10/9/2016,"We were pleasantly surprised after reading several negative reviews about the Marina del Rey location. Yes, it's crowded - so plan on coming early and waiting. The view of the beach is worth the wait.  Our server, Erin, was terrific. Not only was she attentive and helpful - she was funny and entertaining. The food was good - big portions and tasty - but it was the exceptional service made our experience that much better."
Ali B.,"San Dimas, CA",81,76,262,1.0,6/7/2016,I got food poisoned at this place. I had the chicken Alfredo at 9 pm and had to wake up at around 1 and got to emergency after vomiting a few times. I am very disappointed... I kept all the documents I need to take them to small claims court. Because my wife had the same problem I am going to act on it. She woke around 1:30 AM and felt the same way... suddenly she fainted and hit her head on the stove and wall :-( pretty scary. I called 911 but after she came back to life ! I asked them not to come and went to emergency room. Please be aware and at least take caution if you ever decided to try this place.
Johny P.,"Culver City, CA",79,10,,5.0,4/4/2017,"Sat in the bar for a chill meal with my wife, and couldn't have had a better server than Brendan. Great service, and just a pleasure to have him serve us. Food was delish: Asian chicken lettuce tacos, tossed green salad, and the surprise of the meal... chicken samosa's. Just what we needed tonight."
Chavonne L.,"Houston, TX",38,15,1,1.0,4/23/2017,"We are in town from Houston so I am not sure if the recipes are different so plz don't take this as negative but ... These are favorites that we always order so I can be critical...... 1. The buffalo blast was gross. Instead of a buffalo sauce inside the fried chips it was a cheese sauce no buffalo.   2. The calamari was half fried.   3. My daughter didn't eat her pasta, didn't like it.  4. Margarita tasted like a fruit drink --------Came back next night to try again ********Great Job ****Super packed again the Host was amazing he was there the night before and I mean a crowed of 50 ppl both nights and he never once lost his cool was alway professional he was GREAT!! 5. A jam pack place with 2 restroom stalls so u have a line at the door and a line at the bathroom and every time the men's door opened it reaked!!!!!!!!  6. Pasta horrible you cldnt tell the difference between the chicken and pasta it was like blah in your mouth the waitress said they possibly forgot to add salt to water.  7. Spinach dip chips was stale.  8. Why did my original cheesecake taste like the one at Jacknbox!!!! I LOVE  this place but I wasted a total of $200 combined. Very disappointed   Positive. The Host, daughters Oreo cheesecake, the server who relieved our server of a mandatory break. Chavonne"
Britney S.,"Sepulveda, CA",43,17,8,5.0,7/23/2016,"Sade is the best! It's our first time here but Sade made it an awesome experience!!  And that's considering that we were stuck behind an asshole who loves the sound of his own voice- he's not only loud but has managed to voice his opinion on every controversial topic in the media without ever letting anyone else in his party speak. Despite that obnoxious, egotistical man...Sade got the overall experience 5 stars."
Nicki C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,9,,5.0,4/14/2017,"I lost my cell phone@ Mothers Beach this evening. I tried to locate it with my IPhone tracker via my IPad. I was not able to connect to internet.

CHEESECAKE FACTORY MARINA DEL REY -IS MY ALL-TIME FAV RESTAURANT M Luckily after an hour of search I went into Cheesecake Factory, & asked for my cell phone.

Angela B.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,144,95,1.0,11/16/2016,"WOW! The worst experience ever!!! My family and I brought my brother here for his birthday dinner...I wish I never recommended this place because the whole thing was a disaster! I understand that many people were at the location especially since it was a Saturday night but to have an experience like we did was VERY uncalled for. We waited an hour and half when we were told that the wait would be only 45 minutes. After waiting for an hour and half we finally get to our seats. Our server greets us a good 15 mins after we have been sitting, no menus, no water, no one walking up to 10 people sitting at a table looking at each other. Then finally she greeted us and gave us menus. She took our drink orders and left. We waited for another 20 mins just to get our drinks and bread which we asked for numerous times....We finally got our waters minus the other drinks and two tiny trays of two piece breads in them for 10 people who have already been waiting at the table for over 45 minutes. We had ordered appetizers with our drinks which she recommended a platter and when we asked if we were ever going to get the platter she said oh they didn't tell you we ran out...(why would anyone else tells us anything when you are the server and barely you even come around!) We then tell her its fine if we can please have some more bread since we wont be getting any appetizers. She says right away and we do not see her for another 15 mins...In the meantime we ask others and they said yes we are making some we ran out and you should have some soon. Ya rightttt we got some I just don't understand how you can run out of food when you are a multi chain restaurant which I have been coming to for years! I wish the only wrong thing was the lack of food and service. But then of course like the whole night we are waiting for our entrees with empty glasses, impatient children, rude service and a ruined birthday celebration. My sister had gone up to the manager letting him know what we were going through. He then comes to our empty table and was asking how we were I then began to tell him that this is uncalled for and a waste of time for all of us! He clearly did not want to hear how unsatisfied we were because when I was talking to him very nicely for someone who has been going through this terrible night at his managing location he then rolls his eyes at me. I told him ""I'm sorry that my annoyance is getting to you that you have to roll your eyes but you have to understand that we have been on this table with 10 people and no service!""  I was fused and no longer wanted my brother's birthday to be further ruined I dismissed him from our table and just advised him all we want is our food which got to us cold and to leave. They did not comp even an iced tea for the WORST service I have ever witnessed!!! If you don't have any food you should be closed or aware of that issue! I will never recommend any one to attend this restaurant."
Mary L.,"Los Angeles, CA",409,6,4,1.0,11/28/2016,"The worst restaurant I've ever been to! Both times I've ever been here, both just terrible experiences!  My boyfriend and I recently moved to the area and we were checking out different spots to go out to eat and the first time we came here, they forgot about us, but the waiter did alright to make up for it, he was super pissed and swore at someone - unprofessional but whatever... and I just thought they were having an off night. The second time my boyfriend and I came here, which was tonight, we brought my mother (she couldn't read the menu because it's so freaking dark)... Theres a fine line between setting the mood and playing hide and seek.  Anyways, they completely forgot about us AGAIN! I went to the hostess and she just gave me some ridiculous excuse and still no one came to greet us, 15 mins passed and that's when we got up and left. This is a Monday night, it was dead!  And the people next to us were sending their food back because it wasn't cooked all the way.  No thanks! I would rather go to a freaking in and out burger over this place any day.  Negative stars."
P'Angeleno L.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,137,249,4.0,7/13/2016,"Avocado egg rolls a must.  Trust me.  They are amazing.   I'm usually all about the Shrimp Scampi.   Theirs is uniquely theirs, a signature dishes with prawns standing proud with a crunchy exterior in a wonderful sauce, that has whole pieces of roasted garlic.   Served with a mound of angel hair pasta, it's delish.  Ask for extra sauce.  You didn't come to Cheesecake Factory to pay homage to your diet.   But if you did...  The chopped salad on their skinnylicous menu is really, really good.   I skipped the vinaigrette they paired it with and asked for their cilantro dressing on the side.  WOW.  Really good together.  I would do that again any day.  Diet or no."
Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",271,647,3103,2.0,8/26/2015,"I would say I have been to roughly 20 CCF restaurants throughout the USA and this was one of the worst ones I have been too.  Our waiter was short with us and generally inattentive, he never came back to ask us how are meals were or if we needed refills.  He handed me a takeout box and didn't box my food, not a big deal but I don't think that is standard practice at CCF. We were really annoyed about the valet parking charge, of course the prices aren't posted when you drive in to the lot. CCF is not high end, but it's not cheap either, so I do expect better.  I think the service and experience at this location was a major let down. The location of this restaurant is nice, but between the crappy service and the parking charge we are unlikely to be back."
Michelle L.,"Calabasas, CA",324,3,,1.0,11/29/2016,THE WORST CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!!! Had the most awful experience not by a server but from upper management. Do not come here if you want your appetizer before your meal or pleasant people to be serving you.
Hope B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,,4.0,3/28/2017,"This restaurant is a good ""go-to"" place when you have a group with different tastes. They have an extensive menu that will please everyone. I love the location,right on the bay with views of the Marina. It's very popular so I do recommend reservations at busy times.The cheesecake is excellent so do try it when you go."
Luisa F.,"Hawthorne, CA",4,1,,3.0,8/3/2017,"Came to this location for a Birthday dinner, I've been to the Redondo location plenty of times. The food was amazing as always . But the service was not on point , he took for ever to take our drink order and out food even longer. A table in from of us got seated before us and got there food before us . We ask for the check it took even longer then getting our food . I don't think ill be going back to this location."
John R.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1668,341,491,3.0,4/26/2016,Decent cheesecake chain. I do not like the mandatory valet parking but I guess it comes with the small parking lot. Usually there is not to long of a wait if you want to sit outside. Like most Cheesecakes they are pretty full so depending on the waiter it isn't a bad place. I give 3 stars because of the other restaurants surrounding it there are definitely better choices.
G C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,2,1.0,3/24/2017,I ordered the Caesar salad with chicken and bacon to go. I didn't get the bacon....  but I paid for it.  Few weeks ago there was a worm on my plate. That's how they served my lunch.  This place is getting out of control. The front desk greeter who seats you has a huge attitude with no smile on her face. Maybe this is not the place to work for your tips....
LA Slug V.,"Los Angeles, CA",37,88,139,1.0,7/26/2015,"Don't order the pork sandwich, I got food poisoning.  I came in the next day and spoke with the manager that I got sick off their food they wouldn't comp my meal.  I came in sick, with my receipt and said I got sick. I was told I have to wait a week before I get an undisclosed response from corporate office or some excuse like that. My group came in around 4pm and the place was packed.  We didn't have to wait too long for our table but we did have to wait a while before we got our food.  The waitress was helpful but they don't take responsibility for the food quality.  I won't recommend this place to anyone."
Shavon B.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",0,21,1,2.0,2/6/2017,Super irritated today is Super Bowl and I ordered some food for the game. I called using the Curbside Pick up. When I got there and called the number on the parking sign no one picked answered the phone. I then called the main line and they said they would send someone out. I waited about 6 minutes and no still came out. I then called again and they said they would let someone know again. About 5 minutes past and still my food was still not out. There were people that came after me who went it to get their food and left before me. I wasnt dressed appropriately to get out of the car or else I would have. After about also 15 minutes they finally brought my order out. The food was ok. I got Avocado on my salad and they just left it on the side without mixing it in with the rest of the salad like the cheesecake factory in Redondo Beach does. The food didnt seem to live up to Cheesecake Factory's usual standards.
Jeppe G.,"Marstal, Denmark",1,6,3,4.0,8/17/2017,Take a seat outside when you go to this cheesecake factory. The terrace has heaters and a nice view. The food is always on point and the prices are good.
Christina T.,"Marina del Rey, CA",207,12,4,4.0,3/19/2017,"Darwon, won me over by chipping in 25 cents for my to go dinner when Nancy didn't seem to care. Thank you Darwon for your generosity. It makes me happy to know that people are good and you are a fine example of a human being. So grateful..."
