Viridiana S.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,26,18,5.0,5/21/2016,"I had a great experience visiting the restaurant today. We came to celebrate my mom's birthday. We came on a Saturday afternoon (party of 5.) we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was quick and very, very nice. Our food didn't take long to arrive, even though it was a busy day. The food quality was excellent. The server brought dessert with candles, and, she gathered other servers to sing happy birthday to my mom. We couldn't be happier with their level of service."
Evan P.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,13,,3.0,1/12/2017,"I went with a friend for dinner. It was incredibly and uncomfortably dark inside. They seated us and we waited for 10+ minutes without the waiter coming by. We told a busser (politely) and rather than taking our drink order or giving us bread, he said ""they're coming."" We waited a few minutes longer and went to Islands.  I've been here for brunch before and usually have had a good experience which is why I will give them three stars but this was definitely a zero star experience."
Robin L.,"Trondheim, Norway",0,2,,4.0,1/12/2017,"Great food and service. Amazing view if you sit outside. The valet parking however, is a joke. $6 to wait for the valet when it would be more efficient to park our car ourself."
Emi D.,"Hawthorne, CA",32,1,,1.0,7/16/2016,"I'm really not the type to write Yelp reviews but after my visit to this restaurant today, I felt the need to write one.  We went to Cheesecake Factory today to have a nice lunch, something we never do because my husband always works Saturdays.  We get there and we asked to be seated outside, so far everything was good.  We were seated and after that NO ONE came to our table, after 10 minutes a waitress came and put bread on our table, not even a hi from her.  I asked for water and waited for like 5-7 minutes but at that time we decided to get up and leave.  What bother me the most was that other families came in after us and were served and we couldn't even get a cup of tap water.  Never going there again."
Brooklyn K.,"Woodland Hills, CA",87,34,28,4.0,8/30/2015,"Who doesn't love Cheesecake Factory? What I liked about this one in particular was the location though.  Be prepared to valet when you arrive as there's no self-parking. However, it's priced reasonably at only $4.50.  Went with a few girlfriends on a Saturday night and surprisingly got seated right away in the bar section. Our table was overlooking the water. Downfall was we came at night so we couldn't thoroughly enjoy the view. No biggie though, just gives us an excuse to come back for brunch!  If you eat seafood I recommend the miso salmon. It was probably one of the best cooked salmon dishes I've ever tasted. Very juicy and not overcooked.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the icky restrooms!"
Jenn K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",123,256,35,4.0,2/23/2016,"Same as any other Cheesecake Factorys out there.. MAJOR TIP to all my MDR locals... Get it to go! This place is swarming with tourists and hotel guests so it is quite the headache, especially for dinner.  Despite the chaos, service is always good and everyone is friendly enough. Quite dangerous living 2 streets down from here but I'm a sucker for them cheesecakes."
Sherry T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,39,,3.0,1/9/2017,"Not great, but....the view is good if you sit outside.  I don't get why they made me pay $4 to park my car. I hate that.  The food was okay, nothing special. The service was actually very attentive."
Ty C.,"Carson, CA",29,62,90,4.0,5/28/2016,"Have always been a fan the this restaurant chain, probably because I have a tremendous sweet tooth. I make to try a different cheesecake just about every time. This time I went with the Dulce de leche, and I had to wash it down with a well mannered martini. What I don't like is how they basically force you into using their valet service, and now they charge extra for the bleu cheese stuffed olives in the martini."
Karl H.,"Atherton, United Kingdom",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2017,"OK were to start. Had to ask 3 times for my beer, they only had to take the top off a bottle. Ordered 3 entrees. 2 came out. Third came after speaking to a manager but the others had eaten their entree and then the appertizer appeared. Poor show from what's normally a reliable chain"
Jason C.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,97,51,5.0,10/16/2016,"A bit loud in here but for good reason. This place rocks and is busy. With a 15 page menu and gluten free options there is a dish for everyone here. Service is second to none, these guys and girls know how to treat you like royalty."
Priscilla J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,2,,1.0,12/18/2016,"Allow me to start by saying that this is my first horrible experience at cheesecake factory. Normally, service there is great and the food and customer service is above average....but when I tell you yesterday was TERRIBLE it was absoulutely UNBEARABLE. My husband and I arrived to the bar ( where we always sit in order to get FASTER service with food and drinks) for cocktails and food. After waiting for about 40 minutes for bread, one entree and crab bites the bartender informed me that the runner forgot to bring our food....EVEN THE BREAD..... in the mean time... table after table and every other bar patron recieved our food. So after a couple cocktails and no food later I told the bartender that we could just leave if we are not going to be served any food. So he was very friendly about it and got the manager. The manager Amanda came out and assured us that the food would be there right away and was not !! It took another 20 minutes... and the order was wrong !!!! ugggh fast forward..... when she brought out the food again I asked her if it was safe for me to order anything else or would it take another hour.....she reassured me it would come out right away. IT DID NOT ......after another 40 minutes or so I saw Amanda casually pass by the bar and I stopped in asked her ....where are the chicken sliders? To her suprise she asked ...they didnt bring them yet? I told her no...then she went in the back and in about 10 minutes later she brought them out. LMAO.... when I tell you they ruined our entire experience...it would be an under statement. So then, in the end they took the 7 dollar chicken sliders and 7 dollar crab bites off and we paid 20 bucks for our pasta and 61 bucks for our drinks. I also tipped both off the bartenders 5 dollars a piece because they made pretty good drinks. Oh then she had the nerve to ask my husband and I if we were going to pay the bill... AFTER we had already paid !!!!!!!!! TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Service 2/10 Food: 7 1/2/10 Valet 10/10 Bartenders 8/10"
Peter S.,"Culver City, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/9/2017,Ridiculous. This place is a bus stop. Nasty dirty and gross.
Jennifer D.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,23,7,4.0,3/3/2016,"I haven't been here for a while.  Endive salad was better than I remember.  I was craving the cheesy garlic bread, but ended up getting a new menu item that is similar but with meatballs.  It was very tasty.  Brice was a great server, and the runners are also very nice!  You can park in the lot off of Panay Way and bypass Valet all together.  I went during the week around 3P so service was very fast."
CRISTINA V.,"Panorama City, CA",0,9,1,1.0,6/17/2017,Always triple check your to go order they always miss out something specially when they're fully booked.
Deanna L.,"Manhattan, NY",10,154,28,4.0,7/19/2015,"We came for family dinner while staying at Marina del Rey and had the best time. Our server Tim - was absolutely the nicest. The view of the beach is great. The food was delicious, santa fe salad fresh and flavorful, summer rolls crunchy and light, avocado rolls - one of the all-time favs, not the healthiest option but very nice. Tuna tartar - a small portion but very good.  Loved it, especially the beach and the view of the marina. Great experience. We will definitely be back. It has something for everyone and its impossible not to enjoy in such a picturesque setting."
Narek M.,"Burbank, CA",130,4,,5.0,9/10/2016,I'd like to say I got outstanding service from Cameron. ( the blonde haired gentleman) and the whole Cheesecake Factory crew. Amazing people and amazing service. It's not that my food tasted great or my cup was always refilled but the true genuine care for giving their best skills and expertise in running a restaurant. I would definitely recommend everyone to come and experience fine dining by the Marina del ray boat docks and amazing service. Thanks and Cameron if your boss or you see this.. Youre the Man!!!
Jade P.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,158,217,1.0,1/25/2015,"I come here all the time as a matter of fact this is one of my favorite restaurants. The service is usually great as well as the food but today the woman's bathroom is extra nasty. Yes today is Sunday, and it is busy, but so is every other Cheesecake Factory in America but there's no excuse for this unsanitary filth.  The bathroom was nasty when I arrived, over a hour later on my way out the door I stopped back by the restroom and now the trash an is heaping over... Aren't they supposed to be checked every hour, at least? Aren't there people for this specifically?  I hate to bust out one of my favorite place but this is unacceptable! I'm very disappointed Cheesecake Factory!"
Celina V.,"Los Angeles, CA",95,76,246,1.0,1/25/2015,"Where do I begin- For starters, the service was horrible! The hostess was unorganized and unpresentable; I expect a friendly-welcoming greeting when I approach a host stand, not a frowned face.  Our server Sebastian was flat out terrible! He was rude, patronizing, and unfriendly. He took 15 minutes just to bring out our drinks and 45 minutes to bring our appetizer (burnt nachos btw) and barely came to check on us. He seemed not too happy and had a frown the entire time, and not to mention, his response after my girlfriend complained about the burnt nachos came off as snooty, very unacceptable. Out of the many Cheescake Factories I have dined in, I will say that I have never had a bad experience up until now. This location needs major improvement starting with free parking and hiring new competent-friendly servers.  Cheesecake Factory has left me jaded, seriously; the food and service were such a disappointment. The location is nice and all but there are plenty of other restaurants on the marina that offer better service and quality food. I will not be returning!"
Amber S.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,5,10,5.0,3/27/2016,"I went there for my bff's birthday party and ordered the ""Herb crusted fillet of salmon"", which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was amazing!!!! The only downfall was that I wish I had ordered two plates, so I could've taken one home. ;-)"
Cause I'm Happy M.,"Culver City, CA",0,15,,4.0,5/30/2017,"I love this place, but I was so pissed during the Memorial Day weekend.  The restroom should not be a place where kids change out of their swimsuits The restroom is tiny. Sand everywhere. Water on the floor. I slipped and fell. Thank God I am a Choreographer and I broke my fall so I wouldn't get hurt but my elbow is still soar. Please do better in this area. Thank youl"
