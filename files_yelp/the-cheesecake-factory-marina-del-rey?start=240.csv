Kenneth R.,"Los Angeles, CA",188,24,13,5.0,11/12/2016,"So this Cheesecake factory has managed to squeeze it's way back into my heart lol (prior review). Liz was our server for a short moment, but due to my brief interaction with her I officially declare this my favorite Cheesecake Factory."
D L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,,5.0,6/16/2017,"Went there for my wedding rehearsal dinner and the service and food was excellent.  We had about 40 people in our party and everyone was pleased.  The staff did and excellent job and the food and drinks were delicious.  So much cheesecake!  I never thought I would have too much cheesecake, but that's a great problem to have.  Excellent event and environment for a very special occasion."
Raul R.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",6,129,10,1.0,1/8/2016,"Worst take out experience at this location. Their staff at their pick up -take out station have a strange attitude.  Make sure you don't ask - even if nicely - where is your order after 40 minutes , when they said it will only take 15, and they have half of your order getting cold at the counter.  You won't even get the manager to reason about that issue."
Con H.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,18,,5.0,5/27/2017,We had lunch there yesterday sitting in the patio.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  It was a great experience!
Scott L.,"Alameda, CA",39,423,42,3.0,6/13/2015,"One of the smallest CC Factorys that we have ever been to.  Top-notch service from the Valets to the Hostesses to the WaitStaff and Management,  Went on a busy Friday night around 6:30pm after UCLA graduation and waited around 20 minutes for a table for 5.  Not bad wait time! Seated and started immediately with drinks and appetizers.  Our Waitperson Emily was fantastic as she congratulated the Graduate and took our orders quickly.  She has a bubbly, energetic personality that suited this special occasion.  Great job watching over us and decorating the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake (new flavor) at the end of our meal. There is no need to describe the menu as it is just BIG just like the portions.  We had 4 doggy bags since we could not finish after two appetizers, famous CC bread, and drinks. Great location at the end of a cove and great service..as expected from a chain where you can rely on the quality and service."
James A.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",36,13,23,1.0,1/3/2016,Over rated underserved - horrible service unable to serve food you provide - this truly unlike cheese cake
Ingrid M.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,15,52,5.0,12/6/2016,"I've been here numerous times but never tried the factory nachos. Enough to share with the table. Had a lemon drop and must say it's one of the best I've had. A definate must try is the chipotle chicken pasta. It has smokey savory flavor, with the addition of peas, sweet peppers and asparagus. Ask for extra sauce and some parm to top it off. The best. To finish a nice slice of red velvet cheesecake."
George D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/20/2017,"Terrible location run by a bunch of crybabies. I came here with my girlfriend to celebrate getting my new car, and it was a disaster. My girlfriend's meal came out 30 minutes before mine, and she was finished eating by the time mine came out. Then when my food finally did come out, i told the waitress that i didn't want the meal if it wasn't going to be comped, and she yelled at me for interrupting her (which i didn't) and turned around and walked away with my meal. Then the manager came out and started defending her, and when I asked for the whole meal to be comped because of what a bad experience and waste of time it was he said i was ""asking for too much"" and that i was ""killing him"". Needless to say, I will not be back."
Pamela C.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",19,34,12,1.0,7/15/2016,"Been there twice since moving to Marina del Rey. Both experiences have included bad attitude hostesses, slow service, meat cooked incorrectly, and less than engaging wait staff. On last visit, manager did take the cheeseburger off of our bill since we waited so long and it was not cooked as ordered. Downside is I had to track down the manager and ask for the meal to be removed from my bill. The view from the outdoor patio is beautiful. I will not be giving them another try."
Al L.,"Portland, OR",10,218,1,3.0,9/18/2016,"Can something so ubiquitous in America also simultaneously be a tourist trap? It appears so. This Cheesecake Factory is right off the beach at Marina Del Rey, making it a prime location for out-of-towners and Angelenos alike to dine on predictable food while ooohing and ahhing at a water view. This one has been here for awhile, and it shows. Decor is a bit drab. The staff, though friendly, can be slow, and the food is exactly what you expect from Cheesecake Factory--decent in a formulaic way without being excellent. It's a formula that works, because whenever I'm visiting LA, 1/3 of the time I somehow end up here with friends or family. So it's spot-on three stars from my book. Valet parking only. Wait time 1-2hrs on weekends."
Jim B.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,62,16,2.0,3/23/2015,"Came for a special birthday meal, but left disappointed.: ordered 2 sandwiches and salmon, so we were confused why it took 45 min with an almost empty house. When the meal finally arrived we had incredibly overcooked salmon, and one of sandwiches had dry, under seasoned chicken and missing condiments because of menu description inaccuracies. Of course, the bill was bound to arrive messed up ..."
Ben H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",17,7,,2.0,8/24/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is a cluster. Service is hot and cold, food is very inconsistent. If it weren't convenient because of its location I would not recommend it."
Cindi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",56,21,1,3.0,8/14/2016,"""We are judged by the company we keep"". Although this has been my favorite CF, they seem to have the idea that using Quality Parking is going to be good for business. Parking here is valet only. I've watched it go from $3.50 to $4.50 and now $6.00!  Maybe that will work on tourists but locals know better places to go where the don't have to be robbed by parking companies.  I'm surprised that Cheesecake Factory allows this and was surprised at the increase as I was just recently here and was really surprised by the $6.00.  The. Attendants laughed and seemed to Think it's a joke but if Cheesecake Factory doesn't do something to stop this parking price gauging, they will lose business.  I'll never park there again. Next time it would probably be $8-$10."
Binh T.,"San Gabriel, CA",375,652,2076,3.0,9/12/2013,"This location is beautiful! The restaurant is located right in the marina front. Seating inside and out, both for the most part can see the water and yachts. Of course, because we're in the city of expensive people, they charge for valet parking which is your only option as well.  For lunch on the weekdays, if you are on a rush, it may not be a good idea. During the weekdays, they are typically short on staff so service is not speedy. On the weekends, the staff is plentiful but expect a 1-2 hour wait. Since my first time dining at Cheesecake, I have been a huge fan of their pasta selection. But now that I've grown older and become more fonder of other foods, my new favorite is the Miso Salmon.  They have a lunch special in their main menu (Miso Salmon is included) which is a steal for~$12. Portions are very generous and I was stuffed halfway into my entrée. I can only imagine how big the dinner size is. I also pair my lunch with their delicious strawberry lemonade. Sometimes sour and sometimes sweet, but I keep ordering it.  As for the main course, I love love the blueberry swirl cheesecake. Always a good meal each time :)"
Yvonne N.,"Inglewood, CA",0,6,3,1.0,5/25/2017,Worst service ever!!! Good food however the  bend waiting to pay my bill for 45 mins if not longer . Unbelievable!! On top of everything they can't except any gift cards or credit cards  system went down...still waiting to pay my bill ..got here at 6:40 now 9 pm .. try to speak to the manager walked right past me spoke with another manager he was unhelpful all he could say is I'm sorry.....
Michael H.,"Marina del Rey, CA",806,133,127,3.0,6/7/2016,"The food is always consistently good. If I come alone , I seat at the bar. Tonight the service was lousy. The two people attending the bar did not care at all to serve me. Yikes. No good. I'm disappointed."
Spritz H.,"Brentwood Bay, Canada",1,53,28,2.0,5/23/2016,"Disappointing service - menu is great, food was great, service sucked. Enjoyed the outdoor seating although our elbows could have touch the next table. I order cheesecake while my daughter ordered yam fries. We requested them come together - this didn't happen. My cheesecake came when she was done her fries and we were unable to flag our waiter.  Perhaps another server could have made this visit one where we returned as we were staying in the area for 2 weeks.  Perhaps I will check this restaurant out in the future - or not."
Corinne R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",48,31,51,4.0,9/18/2016,It's a Cheesecake Factory so you know what you are getting into food wise. An extensive menu with healthy to not so healthy options. Kids Mac n Cheese was a favorite with the kids. Not directly related to the restaurant but a definite bonus is the kids big playground just outside on the beach. It was probably the first time ever I was disappointed the wait was only 5 minutes.
Kimberly C.,"Torrance, CA",310,395,2270,4.0,9/23/2013,"I came here to celebrate my birthday with my family last night and we were all pretty happy with our experience. The views from inside and outside the restaurant are spectacular, being right off the marina. However, we weren't pleased that parking was only valet and we were basically yanked out of our car by pushy valet staff. In my personal opinion, I believe valet parking should be more of a choice and not a MUST. But, I'll just let that go. We arrived at 5pm and were seated at about 5:20pm - so overall, not too long of a wait, especially for a Sunday night. Our waitress was extremely friendly but forgot about us when a party of twenty was seated next to us. Our waitress took our drink orders and didn't return until we needed boxes and a check. (Probably would've given five stars, if the service was a little better.) But aside from the service, the food was outstanding. Everyone loved their dishes - myself especially. I ordered the mushroom burger (and I know, Cheesecake Factory isn't normally where you would order a burger, but it was my birthday, so whatever) and it was DELICIOUS. I highly highly highly recommend it. Despite the average service, I would absolutely come here again."
Meagan L.,"Carson, CA",148,15,17,5.0,2/21/2015,"Went to the Cheesecake Factory w/ my boyfriend for a late date night after I got off work and it was sooo well worth it! This location is my favorite. I was so shocked that on a Thursday night it would be so busy and crowded but who can blame them, They're food and service is great. From the valet service to being seated in 15 mins. I ordered my favorite crab wantons, A Mai Tai and my boyf. ordered his signature Jack & coke. I ordered my favorite dish the shrimp with garlic noodles and he ordered this Jamaican dish.... I could not stop picking at his plate is was delicious! I was so full from eating his I took my food to go to enjoy it the next day at work!  I recommend This location, Cheesecake Factory to anyone who loves food and great drinks! Any dish you want I promise they have it from burgers salads seafood you name it and they have wonderful prices!!!"
