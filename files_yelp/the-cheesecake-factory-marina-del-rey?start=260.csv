Cherryl M.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",782,109,135,3.0,12/24/2015,"I've  eaten a few times since I love up the street. I will say they've come a long way & the service  has improved. They still need a few more healthy options  but they actually have a spot on burger & the Vietnamese  style spring are better than most Vietnamese restaurants.  Portions are good! As a Chef I'd say they need to scale down the menu, have a more organized service."

Nikki T.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",6,67,24,2.0,3/12/2016,"So, I arrived at 4:14 & was told it would be a 40 minute wait. It's now 5:11 I'm being told to wait another 15 minutes for them to clean table. I'm no genius, but, I'm an expert on service. Before I'm able to eat I'm annoyed. I get that it's Saturday. A very busy time. I expect you to be honest with me. I have 2 guest with me both are pregnant. Very pregnant.  After waiting an hour, we ask the hostess how much longer? She responds "" I just got here so, maybe another 14 mins"".  So after waiting 1 hour & 15 minutes. We are finally seated. The food was average, I ordered the salmon. The service of the waiter was excellent.  Don't know if I'll be back."
Meg M.,"Manhattan, NY",45,2,,5.0,11/4/2016,"Blake was our server. Honestly he was such a genuine and lovely person to all the tables around us I had to leave a review. It's rare in a ""corporate""'restaurant to find such a loyal employee. Someone who cares to do their best. I really hope Cheesecake recognizes they have   An incredible employee! We love the Marina Del Rey Cheesecake. Chill. Fun. And a great relaxing place to go!"
Niklas V.,"Nob Hill, San Francisco, CA",1,1,,5.0,5/5/2017,"Amazing service . Always checkin you out if you need anything. Good prices, good food. Aaamaazzing cheescakes"
Sydney T.,"Lawndale, CA",196,23,12,4.0,9/30/2016,Came here the other night with my boyfriend. We ordered delicious avocado egg roll appetizer and yummy mango smoothies. We had the best customer service with our waiter IMAN he was helpful and SO happy! Only down fall was we wanted to sit outside but seats were too close together so we had to ask to be moved inside.
Wagner L.,"Culver City, CA",4,2,,1.0,6/16/2016,"I just came here to order my food, and the guy ""Mike""  was so rude and aggressive with me. Probably i will never come back again."
Noelle T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,5/2/2017,"STAY AWAY!!!! I had the worst customer service experience today at this restaurant! I waited over 30 minutes for my salad and after politely asking for my check, a female food runner came with the salad and when I told her that it had taken too long and that I was leaving, she ran to two colleagues of hers and shouted ""who wants a salad!!?"" And proceeded to snicker and laugh. Little did she know that I could hear every word she said. Bottom line is the staff is poorly trained and you shouldn't give them your business. Never coming back here again."
Amy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/30/2017,"This is the best location by far. The view is incredible and you can play on the beach while you are waiting for a table. Also, the tables outside are lovely and there is a beautiful view. Service is on point. Food is always perfect. We always go for the avocado eggrolls to start. One of my favorites is the jambalaya pasta which is spicy and so good!"
Michael M.,"VAN NUYS, CA",75,9,,2.0,3/25/2016,"I love Cheese Cake Factory. Except when you order one thing and get another. The last time I was at this location, about a year ago, I ordered Ahi Carpaccio. The fish that came out was a white fish, probably albacore, not red Ahi. At the time I was suspicious but not sure. When I was at a different Cheese Cake factory and ordered Ahi Carpaccio the fish came out red as Ahi should be. The server told me that Ahi is always red and that if it wasn't it was a different fish. So I'm eating at this location as I'm writing this. Brought this to the attention to the manager, Teresa. She did not offer to correct the last mishap saying  that it was a year ago and that she would not accommodate in any way. Horrible customer service. Also the pasta that came with our Chicken Piccata today was super salty. Even though I love this location for being right next to the Marina, this place does not have their act together. Oh yeah, I totally forgot that last time our server spilled a beverage on me. Even though she apologized they did not offer any discount or complimentary desert. I didn't ask for anything last time, but still..."
Bubbly B.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,31,4,1.0,12/26/2016,"Highly disappointed this time around. We did a to go and bill came out to almost $100 but they missed each entree by one thing or another. I understand it was a holiday weekend so busy but really, if your quality goes under than what's the point?!? To boot, I was told it'd be 20-25mins for order to be ready at curbside, didn't get done till 40mins... At the least the time estimate shud be accurate! Will reconsider on future to go orders :-/"
Jade H.,"Venice, CA",71,6,8,2.0,10/25/2016,"Such a disappointment. Everyone working there seems very nice and welcoming, but sadly it didn't make up for the exhaustingly slow service and average food. There seems to be a lack of communication between management as I was told to come early to set up for my child's birthday, only to be told we couldn't have the area we were told to turn up early for. I ordered a simple scrambled egg with tomato and avocado which took almost an hour to arrive. They apologized and took it off the bill which was thoughtful, but as I said, although everyone was nice it just didn't make up for an over all disappointing experience on what was supposed be a special occasion. We will not be returning."
Brian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,743,176,2.0,11/24/2014,I lived within view of this restaurant for 3 years and never went (not an accident).  It was only for a coworkers bday that I finally made the trip over here.   The beach side location is actually pretty nice... the food on the other hand is nothing special.. unless of course if it is judged on calorie counts. This diner did not appreciate the server jokingly trying to remove the nutritional guide I was using to help select my meal. Sorry... I don't want to eat a 1900 calorie lunch!  I actually had to get up and grab the guide back from another table. In the end I went for a burger... which was not bad... but also wasn't memorable in any way.  The sweet potato fries were not bad.  My coworkers got cheesecakes for deserts.. I skipped.
Jack G.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,11,,1.0,7/17/2016,I have been coming to this location for over 30 years. The last few times I noticed the quality and service is getting worse. But I tried to stay faithful. Yesterday was the worst and I said nome coming to this joint. I took my family for my anniversary dinner. After waiting hour and half we where finally seated. I wouldn't wait this long but we were told half our in the beginning. I ordered my usual shrimp scampi. It was a ps. Over cooked and terrible. Rest of my family had something to complain also. The woman's bathroom was out of service for one of the stalls. Overall the restaurant and even the beachfront has gone low class. Filthy and nasty all over. Time to find a better location.
Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",3715,733,1722,4.0,12/10/2014,Had lunch here. Enjoyed the not so healthy Cajun Chicken Littles with fries instead of the mashed potatoes that come with the dish. Thankful that the chicken was moist. Jeffrey was our waiter. He did a good job. We always appreciate our drink refills without having to ask.
Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",809,834,461,4.0,10/7/2015,"We ran in before a 2:30PM appointment, at around 1:50pm on Wednesday 10/7/15. We wanted a quick drink, ordered the margarita, and an app, ordered the tuna tartare.  The bartender was a gentleman and super courteous. The tuna was DELICIOUS, and I normally do not like the food at Cheesecake Factories. This was good."
Sylvia K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",401,385,330,4.0,10/15/2014,"Came here for brunch with 8 girls on a Sunday... as expected, it was super busy and they said it would be 45min wait but luckily we were seated in about 20 minutes.. and on the patio no less with a great view of the pier! Our waiter aaas ready to take our drink order as we got seated and my Bloody Mary was mighty tasty, I must say!  Their menu is MASSIVE!  SO many choice and options to suit any palette or dietary needs... from salads to seafood.. steak and sandwiches.. gumbo and pasta... AND their portions are HUGE!  My friend and I shared the chinese chicken salad and then each of us got a separate entree:  me, BBG pizza - her, ahi tartare appetizer. Our waiter was good and attentive, but towards the end we ended up waiting for our cheesecake desserts an unusually long time and our waiter was no where to be found.  When they did arrive they were absolutely decadent... we shared the Oreo Chessecake and Red Velvet Cheesecake.  I'll definitely be back... sooner than later. :)"
Angelika K.,"North Hollywood, CA",0,37,96,1.0,7/25/2016,I'm a big fan of cheesecake factory because they have so many different options but this place really sucked. The food was horrible. So we ordered a burrito which came with no guacamole and when we asked the server she said umm were out of guacamole... Then the fries who can mess up fries? They were cold and soggy. I ordered the bbq chicken salad which they brought out and it was missing the onion rings on top my favorite part. They waiter said i'm going to bring your inion rings soon. So after 15 min of no onion rings i go to the bathroom on my way back I saw the waiter grab some onion rings with his bare hands from a bigger plate of rings and take it to our table... Is that even sanitary? I think not. If this wasn't bad enough my mom ordered the luau salad. The waitress came and said um sorry we dont have the wontons that go in this salad so we said its fine since all the rest of the food was out.. Later the manager came and said that he was making them fry fresh wontons and the salad wouldn't be charged. Overall it was a horrible experience. My hubby got a club sandwich (im sure your wondering how that could've been messed up right?) the bread was burned. I honestly don't know if it was an off day but to mess up all 4 meals seems a little weird to me..
Michelle N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,5,5.0,9/18/2016,Phillip was AWESOME. I'm glad the switched our waiters. If it was left up to the initial server I would not be giving 5 stars. Phillip is a great asset to your team he was pleasant and upbeat and had a smile the entire time! !
Shante M.,"Harbor City, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/6/2016,"My husband took me here yesterday for my birthday. I was really excited as I've never been here before and I've always wanted to go. When we got there they asked us how many people were in our party which it was only the two of us. They told us to stand by this plant to wait to be seated. It took a few minutes and a someone came to assist us. They gave us the option of indoor or outdoor. I'm glad we chose outdoor because it was very beautiful outside. That's where the good stops. So as we were being seated my husband informed her that it was my birthday. She told us where to sit, and gave us our menus. Another lady comes by and asked us what we will be having. We weren't ready yet so she gave us a few minutes which felt like maybe 60 seconds. She seemed very impatient. So after her second time around we gave her our drink and appetizer order. She carded me and that's when I got my happy birthday. After that we didn't see her for about ten minutes or more. She didn't bring our drinks or our appetizers. Another man came and brought us our drinks and we still waited for our appetizers. She then reappeared when a group of guys were seated next to us. They told her that it was one of the guys birthday and she told him happy birthday they proceeded to order and she left and still didn't come back to check on us. After some more time went by she came back and asked for the rest of our order which at this time we've spent most of our time just waiting for her to resurface so she can take the rest of our order. We order two entrees and a dessert. She then disappeared again, came back and took more of the groups order. We finally received our appetizers from someone else. At this point I'm becoming a little agitated because after all I've never been here and it's my birthday and I expected a better experience. I was still willing to sit it out but the last straw for me was that a few servers came to that group singing happy birthday and gave them a cake with a candle. A group that came after us. Not only that then all of their food started coming out. So then she tells them that she was going on break and if they needed more help that the back up server can assist them. She comes over to us and she says I'm going on a mandatory break during that time no one will be taking my place I will be back after my break. Goes to the next table and repeats what she said to the first table. I was in such shock so when the replacement server came out with the rest of our food I asked for a manager. He came over immediately and I explained to him that I don't understand how that group got their birthday song and cake before I did. And he said he knows it my birthday it comes after the food which clearly it doesn't because that group got theirs before their food started pouring out. I told him that I didn't want anything more than what we have eaten and drank and that I wanted the check. He tried his hardest to keep us there. He kept insisting that we stay and that he would serve us and they already made our food which at that point I don't care that the food was already made. I don't appreciate waiting on a server with an attitude for an hour on a Monday when they weren't even that busy. The type of service she gave us deserves negative stars. Management needs to retrain her or fire her because what people don't realize is that you are the face of your company so what u put out to your customers will ultimately determine how the visit goes. So even though this place had a great scenery and some awesome sliders the service was horrible and the management was very pushy about us staying even though I told him no well over six times. What I can credit him for is the fact that he gave me a complimentary cheesecake to go. So good job on that, but it doesn't change the fact that my birthday dinner was ruined. I most definitely won't be returning to this location hopefully other locations are a lot more customer focused."
