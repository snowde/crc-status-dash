Harry M.,"Playa del Rey, CA",2,5,,3.0,9/19/2015,"when at the cheesecake factory, get a cheese cake! the other stuff on the menu is nothing to write home about. Very nice location though, right on Mothers beach, next to the docks.  Outside seating is recommended, lovely views and breeze from the ocean."
Mary J. M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",22,201,128,5.0,1/2/2016,"We seriously had the best server we've ever had here for lunch. His name was Elias, and He was attentive, knowledgable, helpful with my nut allergies, on top of all our needs, had great suggestions, and fast, personable service. We will defiantly be back because of this server! What an awesome day! Thank you!"
Annie J.,"Anaheim, CA",3,11,1,1.0,2/22/2017,"Ordered meatloaf for lunch and it's really burnt, have to return it, no more meatloaf for me starting today. Bad experience with it anywhere I go. Manager and server really nice and apologetic so everything is ok. Had mashed potato which is really good. Happy tummy. Replaced my food and looks good, but can't eat anymore ,lost appetite already."
Lucian C.,"Tucson, AZ",88,4,,2.0,6/30/2016,"SLOOOOOOOOW service. Everything took forever. Not good. Yelp is telling me to write more, so I'm just writing. Trump is toxic, and he's the candidate the GOP deserves"
john j.,"Concord, CA",7,88,37,5.0,10/3/2015,"Celebrating my daughters 18th birthday with the NorCal family. A great place for families: tons of choices and excellent food coupled with an exceptional service staff. My daughter loved her birthday dinner and the entire table love Brandon, our waiter par excellence!  He was very attentive, engaging and made our table feel special. We can't wait to celebrate many more events here as our daughter finishes her 4 years at Loyola Marymount. Many thanks to the Brandon and the entire Cheesecake staff for making her birthday extra special!"
Jatinder K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/25/2016,This restaurant is really good for a nice lake side meal. I love sitting outside with the heaters on. The food I pretty good but the time it takes to sit place and receive food is terrible. Takes almost an hour of waiting and then order to be placed. The deserts you can never go wrong with. They literally save this restaurant.
Michael A.,"Studio City, CA",1,8,13,1.0,6/25/2016,"The only reason I am giving this place a one star, is because there is no way to give it zero stars, or minus stars.  The service was horrendous and slow.  It took them almost an hour to serve our initial round of drinks which were watered down and tasteless.  The female shift manager with painted eyebrows was incredibly rude, and spoke in a very arrogant, rude, derogatory, nasty tone.  She has no comprehension of customer service.  She behaved antagonistically when questioned, and was on a complete power trip. Cheesecake has lost its way.  Customer service is non-existent at this location.  I would rather starve to death instead of eating a single crumb of bread or drinking a single drop of water at this place."
Austin M.,"Marina del Rey, CA",228,37,4,2.0,9/1/2015,"I write this review with a heavy heart as I have always considered Cheesecake Factory to be my comfort food haven. I wish I could have 2 different ratings for this place. 1. In restaurant dining (4.5 - 5 stars): Service is solid, portions are massive, bread is plentiful, ambiance is spot on. The location seems to get extremely crowded, but hey it's a popular chain on the Marina. 2. Take Out (0 - 1 stars): Up to one star based purely on the fact that the food was edible. I made the mistake of ordering take out this weekend and the list of complaints in quite expansive. to name a few - All of our meals seemed to be undercooked - Asked for extra pumpernickel bread - Got NO BREAD WHATSOEVER! - When called to confront about the bread was hung up on Take out was just lacking the TLC that I have grown to expect from such a well established chain.  If you are in the mood for Cheesecake Factory, I would highly suggest steering clear of take out and enjoying your meal at the restaurant."
Judy J.,"Santa Rosa Beach, FL",153,65,98,1.0,8/11/2015,Such a shame. Great location at the Marina. Most mediocre service I have experienced in 2015. You pull up and are forced to pay valet.then you wait and they seat you at the worst table overlooking tents.. Is this even a table? Ugh. Ask to move. Waitress acts like we are super high maintenance. Pleasant.
Alan R.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,129,1,1.0,8/7/2016,Wow terrible terrible service I can't even write words to describe how poor the service was. We ordered appetizers and our main course came first cold disgusting old pasta. Manager came to apologize and said sorry for the inconvenience and that was there customer service. Wow don't ware your time or money waiting 1 hour to sit down and have this kind of service and disgusting cold food to deal with.
Ruby K.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,151,143,3.0,7/17/2014,"I want to give them only 1 star, but the food we ordered was good and our server was very nice.  The bad review was for the long wait we had to deal with when we were waiting for our table and our food. It was my sister-in-law's birthday so the whole family went out for dinner (Party of 11; 3 of them are kids). It was only a Wednesday night and yet we were told that it was a 1 hr wait for an outdoor patio table. Ok, 1 hr seemed long but doable so we waited. And waited... And waited. Then my husband said, ""Oh wait. That couple leaving...Didn't we wait when they waited?"" We then realized we waited for 2 friggin hrs! So we went inside just hungry and tired of waiting, and they claimed they still didn't have a table ready for us. Since we already invested so much time in waiting, we stayed but had to call the head manager. After we spoke to the manager all of a sudden a table was ready for us. But they were very apologetic to us and our waiter apologized to us profusely as well. The food also took awhile to arrive as well. We were a large party, however, the restaurant was emptying out since it was getting late. Aside from the long wait of waiting for out table and food, everything was great. Thankfully! The restaurant provided complimentary pie and cocktail for the birthday girl, cocktails were yummy (Mojito/Margarita), the food was great (shrimp pasta/mac n cheese burger), and our waiter was on point. I wish I had a better experience, but it still won't stop me again from dining here."
Tom N.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,12,1,2.0,5/30/2016,"Food is always good here; service is always terrible. I feel bad, They under staff; and I see the waiters running around everywhere but they just can't keep up."
Susan A.,"Easton, PA",5,172,28,1.0,7/23/2016,Well we were craving cheesecake tonite and walked over from our hotel and it was CLOSED for structural maintenance! On a Saturday night!
Kimberly B.,"Alhambra, CA",682,554,2647,4.0,7/1/2014,"My  sister had her birthday dinner here and we enjoyed it very much.  The kids played in the sand with the swings and bars while we waited for our table to be set up.  Our view of the beach was so calming.  The heat lamp was on; so with the liquor and the heat, we were torched.  Our dinners and drinks were absolutely  pleasant. One minor complaint, everything took forever... our drinks, our refills, our food, our bread and butter.  I was annoyed a one moment but I drank my vodka and chilled out.   It's a lovely place, I wouldn't mind coming back.   Make sure you get a table outside on the patio, worth your while."
L B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,4,5.0,2/15/2016,"we came here last minute VDAY date. We're not big on having full sit down dinner. Drinks & appetizers are fine for the honey & I. The place was packed, 2-2 1/2 hour wait. So, thankfully we snuck in at the bar, and were able to get seats within 20 mins.  We love Cheesecake Factory their food is always good & consistent. My review is really for the bar staff, Thank You-smiling, taking orders & having a great attitude, made it a fun date night!"
Brenda L.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/11/2017,I really wanted to give them no stars but that is not possible I waited one hour to be seated when they said 20 minutes then the host said they had been calling my name when the buzzer didn't even buzz she should have just called me a liar great costumer service obviously isn't a requirement to work here then we were seated I waited one more hour for our food and my steak is over cooked and they forgot my sides the waitress didn't come to our table at all I had to call a near waiter by the end of my experience I'm just over it I know it's not a steak place but seriously it was really bad service no apology from the host no apology from the waitress the manager came to the table but at this point I just wanted to leave but I didn't want to ruin the rest of my parties time never going back I've been here so many times sometimes I just went for the cheesecake but they don't care for long time costumers.
J M.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/1/2016,Service Is horrible!  If i can give them zero star I'll do.  I won't be back.
Ile B.,"Venice, CA",14,47,62,1.0,6/28/2015,"I have 2 small kids and my husband works a lot. I have high expections when we dine out alone. I've been to this location, countless times-which was actually my favorite CCF until today. Where do I start?!   1. They sat us behind  the most rude classless family ever. They had 3 kids  around 9-10 all 3 running around  the table yelling bumping into my seat climbing the patrician - the entire time 2.  Next to them sat a herd of yackle. They were so loud I COULDN'T  hear myself.  3. The guy who cleaned the table next to us, hit me in the face with  his dirty towel, as he swung it under his arm.  He did not bother say sorry.  4. The waiter NEVER BROUGHT bread. He didn't  offer any either. 5. There were flies buzzing about  6. The chicken tasted like the frozen kind I keep in my refrigerator. The shrimp was mushy ( Jamaican black pepper chicken and shrimp) Ive been ordering the exact same item for  12-15 years. Creature of habit. 7. Our waiter may have been new. He left a lot to be desired-  when it comes to customer service. We never got our receipt and to top it off, I had to ask him for my husbands credit card because he forgot it at the cashier area.  I told my husband that I would NEVER EVER GO BACK TO THIS CCF EVER!!! NEVER!!!!  THIS EXPERIENCE  WAS THE WORST EVER! THIS LOCATION IS NO LONGER A PLACE FOR ME TO ENJOY A DATE WITH MY HUSBAND. --"
