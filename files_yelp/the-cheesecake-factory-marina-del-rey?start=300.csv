Sonja J.,"Lakewood, CA",39,13,3,1.0,8/28/2016,Warning... do not order the chicken fettuccine it was horrible... Not only was it horrible but the manager hesitated to accommodate us.. we went there to celebrate my niece birthday with a party of 12 and five or six people order the fettuccine and have the same result ..It came out salty and watery. And what makes it worse we had to wait 2 hours just to get seated to have this nasty taste in my mouth
Chanel O.,"Los Angeles, CA",531,117,217,4.0,6/25/2014,"This was the first time that I've been to The Cheesecake Factory on the mainland.  I've been to the one in Hawaii a few times and have always felt overwhelmed by the menu.  It is huge! This time, I was craving carbonara the other night so my boyfriend suggested coming here because he loves The Cheesecake Factory.   The Marina del Rey location was the closest to my apartment.  Driving in, there is only valet, which costs $4.50 during dinner.  There seemed to be a lot of people outside, so we asked the valet if it was a busy night.  He told us not really and that the wait seemed to be only about 10 minutes, but when we walked inside the hostess told us about 30 minutes. x.x  We decided to wait because we had our mind set on pasta.   The hostess was not very friendly, which was kind of a turn off for my first impression of the restaurant.  Also, the bathroom was pretty dirty for such a pretty restaurant.  There was trash everywhere and the ground was wet.  It didn't seem like anyone came in to clean the restroom often.   We decided to wait at the bar and grab a few drinks at the bar before dinner.  He had a classic mojito and I had the pink lemonade cocktail, as suggested by the bartender. They were both delicious! Mind did not even taste like alcohol, but you could tell they were both strong.  We ended up getting seated in about 15 minutes so we had to take our drinks with us to the table.  We sat outside on the patio and it was so beautiful! You are right on the water under a cascade of beautiful lights.  Since it's summer, the weather was perfect and we asked our server to lower the heat lamps above us.  The setting was perfect.   To start the meal, the freshly baked bread was hot and delicious.  The wheat and honey bread was fantastic.  We also had an order of calamari for our appetizer.  It was crispy and came with marinara sauce and some type of creamy sauce.  For our entrees, we ordered the chicken carbonara and the cajun jambalaya pasta.  They were both tasty.  The jambalaya pasta wasn't too spicy and came with both chicken and shrimp.  The carbonara was the perfect consistency; not too heavy.  To finish our meal, we ordered the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake.  There were oreos baked in the cheesecake and it was layered with some type of fudge cake and some type of milky icing.  It was topped with a giant oreo cookie! I normally do not care for cheesecake, but this one had a good amount of chocolate to make me happy ^.^"
Robin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",228,70,132,4.0,6/2/2014,"I especially like this Cheesecake Factory location in Marina del Rey because of the outdoor patio seating and the view of the water/boats. I came here late afternoon with a meetup group after we went kayaking. The menu is definitely extensive so it's hard to choose what to get. I ordered the avocado spring rolls and was happy with my selection. They were very filling and they came with a light mint chutney sauce. Great selection of drinks as well.  We parked right by the marina. Pretty sure it was $2 an hour or maybe $1 an hour but the parking lot is just a block away from the restaurant. Definitely come here for a nice outdoor lunch, great views for sure! Oh and free bread for the win!!"
J B.,"Tarzana, CA",0,25,,1.0,2/4/2017,"So the Cheapskate Factory responds to my review about my Mom's 90th birthday experience and asks me to contact them so they can speak to me directly about our experience.  Being the fair minded guy that I am, I actually honor their request.  And, of course, they never call me back.  I guess I should have told the Cheapskate Factory to call me collect..."
Ramin M.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",120,39,41,5.0,7/26/2015,"Although we hade a bad initial experience,  this place always delivers. To get over the bad experience, while waiting for our table (30 min for outdoor seating), I asked the waiter for two glasses of water. She declined my request and refered me to our waiter. I asked a random waiter for two glasses of water and she too was reluctant to help. What happened to customer service? In any case, management were eager to help got us water quickly. Thank you.  I have been to this CF before and I love the place because of its water view. The food is delicious as always and usually the waiters are attentive as well.  Parking is valet parking only and they charge $4.50."
Adam P.,"VENICE, CA",211,5,,1.0,5/24/2016,"Everytime I come for a pick up order here, I'm greeted by the same two miserable employees. One is a heavy set Hispanic female and the other is an older black male. They both clearly hate their job. News flash, if you hate your job, get a new one!!! Always tempted to speak to management but I don't like getting people in trouble. I'd rather just post a bad review."
Norrin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,10,1,5.0,1/12/2016,This location is by far the best since its location. The scene is what makes it for me overlooking the water of the marina and boats.  This place has so many items to choice from its hard not to find something that you'll love and not to mention all of the different kinds of cheesecake to finish it off.
Steven J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,2/13/2017,"The location clearly means a wait.  We arrived were told an hour.  Okay.  We've been warned.  As we approach an hour, I inquire to our status.  Answer:  we are ready and will buzz your pager right now.  Another half an hour passes and I go back up.  The hostess has  an attitude and says sorry we should have never told you the table was ready.  We wait another 20 minutes.  I go back up.  Clearly she is overwhelmed.  There is no manager around.  The seating is out of control.  Finally we get seated.  Again we wait for a waiter to come by and start our dining experience.  Finally we get a waiter.  He says hi and disappears for another 10-15 minutes.  Comes back for drink orders.  We get half.  I have to ask another waiter to accommodate.  This cycle continues through the whole meal. Orders messed up, half the food coming out.  We all wait while the other half show up.   What adds insult to injury is an overall attitude like ""hey look around, we are so busy and have such a great location that we don't really care whether you look to come back."" This is not my first visit to this location.  It will take a lot to not be my last. Be careful about planning anything special that involves this restaurant.  Disappointment is just around the corner!"
Nicholas P.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,27,6,1.0,4/27/2015,"Went there today and was seated quickly. After 8 minutes no one had approached us to ask if we wanted a drink or bread. Three tables that had been seated after us were given drinks and bread. The final straw was when a waiter put bread on a large table for a large group that was not even seated yet. We left, and as we were leaving the hostess asked why we were leaving. We told her and she asked if we wanted to speak to the manager. We said yes but after yet another 6 minutes of waiting he did not show up either. Disgraceful, disgusting and absolutely not what one would expect from the Cheesecake Factory."
priscilla p.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/11/2016,"Be careful when your bill comes  they over charged me. I was there for a brunch with 3 other friends. First the waitress(Brooke H) forgot to place my order and then when the bill came we all split the bill in four. The next day I checked my bank account and they charged me the full amount. Because I'm pregnant and I started not feeling well I signed the bill and didn't noticed that I was signing the full amount.. I asked the waitress just to put the remain balance in my card.. I called the manager the next day, but she just told me that she couldn't  do anything about it. I told her that I have witness but she was very rude and hung up.. I will never ever go to this place again.."
Silva W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/6/2017,came here last night wow great view nice staff ...
Kurtis S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",24,16,12,2.0,6/24/2016,So I'm here with my partner and family. The food was sub par to say the least. The waitress looked like she just woke up from a deep sleep. It took over a hour to get our food and when we got it well it was bad. I ordered the orange chicken and the sauce was like jello literally. The food was cold the drinks were totally bad n man what happened to the good cheesecake factory. Service was bad food was bad and I felt like I got rapped because of course i can't just walk out.
Paola R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,17,6,3.0,8/17/2015,"I went with my friend and we sat on the outside dining area, the view is so beautiful. I got a tropical smothie and pizza with a salad. Everything was really good but the only problem was the waiter. She was nice but she would take forever and she even forgot about us. We ended up asking another waiter to help us but overall it was good :)"
Marko C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1637,1167,4120,3.0,6/24/2012,"Three stars for the Cheesecake Factory Marina Del Rey.   We arrived with a party of 6 at 4:45 on a Sunday and there were tons of people waiting at the door.  We were told that it was a 30-40 minute wait if we sat inside, and it was a 10-15 minute wait if we were willing to sit outside in the sun.  Brandon C. was our waiter and he did a wonderful job at helping out our table.  Fortunate for us, we had two (very) senior people at our table and he was super patient with them!  Thanks! For drinks, I had a lemondrop martini.  The drink tasted like a very concentrated lemonaid, but boy did it kick a punch!   It came in a sugared rim glass and a lemon twist.   Very clean and refreshing!  Grade:  B For my main meal, I decided to order a tapas sampling from their ""skinny menu"".  The first dish was an arugula salad.  YUM!  The dish was baby arugula served with freshly sliced parm cheese, and toasted almonds and yellow rasins.  The dressing was a citrus and olive oil sauce and it was simply delicious!  Grade:  A- My second tapas sampling was the beet & goat cheese salad.  This dish was red beets cubed, tossed with granny smith apple chunks, and served with arugula salad and toasted pecans.  The salad had a lot of potential, but somehow it missed the mark for me.  Perhaps it was because the beets were dull (didn't taste like freshly cooked beets, nor did they taste like canned beets).   Nothing popped out at me while eating the salad.  Grade:  B- My third tapas sampling was the artichoke heart and krab dip.  There was a dip made up of artichoke hearts, krab pieces, and cream sauce.  Served with about 6-7 slices of French bread toastinis.   This dish missed the mark for me.  In fact, it took 2 bites of the dish and decided to throw the rest away.  It lacked flavor, and it tasted like it was slopped together.  Wasn't worth the stomach space.  Grade:  D- For my dessert, I orderd the red velvet cheesecake!  OMG DELICIOUS!   This was the highlight of my meal!  This was two layers of red velvet cake, with a middle of cheesecake, and topped with a rich cream cheese topping.   This was perhaps the best cheesecake that I've eaten at this restaurant chain!   The serving was huge and it was fun to eat!  Grade:  A-. What I liked best about the dining experience was that the menu was HUGE!  There was like 20 pages of a menu - varying from American, to Asian, to a bit of creole in the dish choices.  There is always something for everyone to eat here - and this was reflected in the very diverse clintele eating here! Food Grade:  B Service Grade:  B+     Thanks Brandon C.  Worth the Money Grade:  B Overall Impression Grade:  B"
Steve S.,"Las Vegas, NV",24,41,11,1.0,4/14/2015,Only Reason...I give this a one star is because the parking is Horrible and Valet service is RUDE. Valet actually hit our car with a car he was parking and said we were parked in Valet area which it wasn't because he stated they use that lot for over flow so technically we were in the right. He said nothing about hitting our car and just ran away. Luckily he didn't do any damage to our car so I just left. Don't trust your cars with Valet. Management needs to do something maybe find another Valet company. Parking lot isn't big enough for the restaurant volume. Cheesecake is great but not worth the headache trying to get your car parked or worried that its going to be damaged. Find another Cheese Cake Factory near by.
Alberto A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",75,20,,3.0,1/12/2017,"I love this location, but at night, I waited 30 minutes for service and no server showed up......very angry!!!!!!!!!!"
Lin F.,"Holladay, UT",299,520,989,5.0,4/8/2014,"Right by a playground so kiddo can exhaust the rest of their energy. Valet for a fee. This location with patio, harbor view, and playground meets all family criteria. Loud enough for a small child and big enough for wiggle room. Service excellent, food portions large enough to share, drinks made with a light pour since it's a family restaurant. Servers look fresh in white. Food-- soup and sandwhich; carrot cake; death by chocolate cake; fish and chips; PRAWNS fried platter. Amazing!"
Larry L.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,123,6,5.0,2/14/2016,Have to give this place 5 stars. Not just for the great customer service but also for the amazing food and scenery like no other. Thank David and Cheese Cake Factory.
Annabelle H.,"Santa Monica, CA",40,76,9,4.0,12/11/2015,"Ok, I know I'm talking about Cheesecake Factory and it could be the same food everywhere but this location is immaculate as a factory of cheesecake. 2 private terraces with fire pits and ocean views. To this day they make one of my favorite of all times cheesecake ""Wild Blueberry White Chocolate"" umm um. And I mean come on we can say Cheesecake Factory is over commercialized and unhealthy food but when we do that we are taking something for granted. Do you really want to lose an restaurant that sells 80 types of cheesecake!?"
John W.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,116,13,4.0,7/20/2015,"The good: customer service was solid, our server Mark was attentive and friendly, Louisiana chx pasta was delicious. The bad: surprisingly the cherry cheesecake was subpar. Last time I had Oreo which was really good. The ugly: valet attendants were lazy and unfriendly. We had to search them out to give them our ticket."
