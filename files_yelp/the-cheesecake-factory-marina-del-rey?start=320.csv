Liborio C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,8,5.0,1/21/2017,Had no wait time on a friday evening for party of 2. The window seats are nice for something to look at. Get alot of food for the price.
Haley Y.,"Northeast Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/16/2017,WOULD GIVE 0 STARS IF I COULD me and my family went here on a Sunday night and ended up spend 4 hours there not because we wanted to but because the survive was TERRIBLE  the wait was 2 hours so we decide to go to the bar to order appetizers after waiting an hour for anyone to even talk to us they made a lame excuse that they thought we were just waiting for a table when we said we were going to order drinks and appetizers finally we got seated and the service down there was terrible we waited 30 minutes to order and an hour and 15 for our food to come out. My mother ordered salmon that was terribly dry there were limited lights so we could not even  see our food and when we asked to turn the heat lamp on they told us it was broken after complaining to the manager and finding out the the HEAT LAMP DID WORK BUT NO ONE BOTHERED TO TURN IT ON my mothers went to the bathroom and over heard the waiter BRAGGING to the bartender about how he treated customers badly after talking to two managers extensively they did not even bother to compensate any of our meal  would not go back ever again very disappointed.
Sarah M.,"Van Nuys, CA",6,6,,2.0,7/15/2015,"Great view and locaton are the only reasons I'm not giving this one star.  From the moment I sit down, the silverware and plates are dirty.  The food smells.  I have to fight tiny flies for my space and even saw a bug crawling on the table.  Gross. If you have to eat here, sit outside."
Bryant P.,"Culver City, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/15/2017,Dinner was amazing last night. Our waiter made the evening comfortable and funny. His name was Duan (sorry if I misspelled it). I will definitely go back. He was super attentive. Plus the wait for our table was shorten than what the hostess told us.
Brittany T.,"Oak Park, CA",2,50,11,3.0,10/1/2015,"Great location and wonderful food, however the service was terrible. I am a frequent visitor here and was very dissapointed in our visit.  To start off, the hostess did not even acknowledge that we were waiting to put our name in for a table. The resturant was empty... We were finally seated in a corner table under a tree. I felt very claustrophobic and the host was very rude about moving us to a booth...  I was unhappy so I made my way to the bar area where it was much more open. After a few minutes... we finally got a server and he was a very nice young man. He was very attentive and made our dining experience wonderful! If it wasn't for him I don't think I would be coming back to this location."
Jen L.,"Culver City, CA",27,24,,5.0,9/22/2016,I eat here all the time--great selection and food. Plus they have a fantastic gluten free menu including burgers with gluten free buns. They also have a pretty solid gluten free pasta--not the best I've had but good. Great salads they can make gluten free and even a sugar free cheesecake!
Brian M.,"Pasadena, CA",1,14,5,3.0,7/16/2016,"I personally love the bread at cheesecake, and their avocado egg rolls are to die for, but this time I went out of my safe zone and ordered the California chicken club. Such a disappointment. Barely any chicken, chicken was cold cuts, not actual grilled chicken breast, and the whole sandwich was swimming in mayo. Always sticking to my egg rolls, bread and pasta combo from now on."
Koko L.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/10/2017,"By far my favorite location to dine!  The food is as good as ever, and the best part is the romantic dining option on the outdoor balcony."
Yoly G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",2,14,10,3.0,11/25/2014,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factory's in Orange County, LA County, and the Inland Empire, but this one was my least favorite!  When I walked in the hostess was very rude and didn't even ask how big the party was, even though we were the only people waiting. Then he just led us to a table he didn't even ask if we wanted to be seated outside.  As we got our waitress she was ok, but she only came to our table twice: for our drinks and when we ordered. We ordered avocado rolls which were really good and the chicken manidera was ok. Considering that the mashed potatoes were really soggy. All in all my experience here was really bad."
Karen L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",312,677,87,4.0,7/6/2015,I love the outside patio. The menu is smaller than the encyclopedia inside but still pretty big! There is a great view of Mother's Beach and there are heaters outside so it stays warm. I had the Chicken Caesar Salad. The salad is huge but needs more chicken! My husband had the steak and fries. His was delicious. It's a great place to people watch too!
shan k.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,10,6,1.0,6/19/2016,"Worst place ever!!!!!! They said our table would be ready in 20 minutes... we ended up waiting and hour and our table still wasn't ready. I had to take my kids to McDonald's to eat since they were so hungry.... and get this, I couldn't even get a table in triple the time that was promised and rather than apologizing.... they made me pay for Valet... never again!"
AD R.,"Los Angeles, CA",146,12,1,4.0,3/7/2015,"I love the food!  However, the seating is too claustrophobic.  The tables are literally a foot apart from each other.  I can perfectly hear the conversation of the table next to us even if they whispered.  Of course, it just so happened the most annoying lady was seated next to us talking about subjects that were not Cheesecake Factory appropriate. Spaghetti & Meatballs is my favorite, I have them add crushed red chili peppers."
Anna R.,"Fort Worth, TX",308,9,,1.0,7/8/2016,"It took way longer to be seated than they'd said and it was right by the kitchen. My order was wrong and it took them a long time to bring me the correct order. My friends had to wait on me for so long that by the time we could finally order cheesecake, our other friends were already headed out to bars. My entree in general was pretty bland and some of my other friends felt the same way about their pasta. I would've gone straight for the cheesecake had I known."
Nicholas G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/4/2017,"Guest services responded to my complaint and sent a $35 gift card to make up for the bad experience. In my mind, the right thing to do. Wish all companies handled this like this."
Don W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",223,236,1279,5.0,7/2/2015,"I've loved this place since the first time I was hear in the late 80s. The beachside seating has an amazing view and ambiance that can't be beat. This is one of the few MDR restaurants that has stood the test of time. The only downside is they don't take reservations at all, so during busy times the wait can be significant. I'm also not a fan of forced valet parking. Even if you choose to park the car yourself, you still have to pay the valet fee.  The menu is fantastic, with something for everyone. The portions are huge, so be ready to leave with a takeout bag. I love the breakfast section of the menu for Sunday brunch. If you're like me, you'll find a favorite menu item and get it every time. For dinner I love the Chicken Madiera.  On special occasions, I'll save room for cheesecake. There are so many options, the hardest part is choosing which to get. The service here is very good as well."
Paula M.,"Culver City, CA",431,13,8,5.0,7/13/2015,Best cheesecake i ever been to.  Good service and the best of all is the view of the marina. Awesome outside patio with firepits.  I always get food to go to eat at the beach too and it's always ready when they said it will be.
Elizabeth L.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,137,,3.0,5/19/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is a chain--there is nothing new under the sun here.  The menu is large. The food is  good but over priced. This particular one in the Marina is always crowded-- The service is acceptable. The restaurant is loud. If you are on vacation go elsewhere. You will have more fun. But if you want a crowded place that is loud, with okay service, okay food (they do have a lot to choose from) and over priced fare, enjoy."
Julie K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",988,590,41,4.0,7/19/2015,"There where 5 of us yesterday... Rainy day.. We came at 3pm ... Waited only 15 min, we where told 45... They do not take reservations, which I think is silly...(I think you guys should take reservations for over 4 people)    We had the fried  Calamari, my mom had the sliders, dad had a turkey burger as did my uncle, Aunt ordered the chopped salad, I ordered the parmasan chicken sandwich. Great waiter... Young, looks 15, but amazing A+. I love when my neighborhood restaurant is amazing and my picky family is happy.."
Ivett C.,"Culver City, CA",0,2,,4.0,11/11/2015,I would have given this location 5 stars but they should really give customers the option to park their own car (specially if its 10pm on a Tuesday and the parking lot is empty) I don't like the idea of paying for valet parking when I'm the one parking my own car either.  The restaurant's staff was very attentive and accommodating. The food was good overall. This location is def smaller than the others but the view makes up for the restaurants size. (Maybe that's why it gets super crowded most of the time) I'm just glad thay we went on a slow night and that we got to enjoy the outside view.
Charles M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,162,15,3.0,4/24/2016,"Back in the day this was the place to go.  Being from LA, I've been to this Cheesecake Factory to celebrate someone's birthday quite a few times.  So recently I decided to take someone here for their b-day. 1.  First of all they don't take reservations.  I think management does this on purpose so if they are fully booked, people might go elsewhere... instead patrons' only option is to get there and put there name down and depending on how busy it is, just wait.  Read the other reviews.  This stinks for big groups.  Granted the staff working there are pretty good. (If you really want to eat at a Cheesecake Factory, the Santa Monica one said they did take reservations during weekdays at their non-peak hours.) 2.  Eating outside.  If it's near dinner time it might seem like a good idea to eat outside.  Especially when we were offered seating immediately on their patio.  I sat with the sun in my face and tried to move the umbrellas over to get some shade but that didn't help much.   Then when the sun set it got windy and cold.  We did ask them to turn on the heat lamp so that helped.   3.  The view here is pretty nice.  This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory. 4.  Prices on their menu.  I noticed on their menu, for some reason they don't list prices on most of their drinks (other than wine) and their cheesecake.  We ordered the Salted Caramel cheesecake and it was 7.95. 5.  The food here has never been that amazing or memorable but it's definitely above average.  The portion sizes are decent and it seems like everyone is taking leftovers home. On my most recent  visit we did order a salad, the Spicy Cashew Chicken and their steak and salmon combo.  The salad was good, the steak and salmon were fine as well but the Spicy Cashew Chicken has issues. I think they rushed the order and they didn't cook off the alcohol from the sauce. (I know when I follow a recipe for teriyaki sauce they use either a sake or mirin but when I tried the Spicy Cashew Chicken the alcohol flavor was way too much.) I ended up eating my friend's dish and most of the break. (The bread is pretty darn good... I'm pretty sure they're extra sugar in the warm wheat bread. 6.  Cheesecake.  If you don't thoroughly enjoy the meal (like we did) be sure to get some cheesecake.  We had the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and that was pretty amazing. That pretty much saved the night and we left happy.   So if you decide to visit a Cheesecake Factory, make sure you leave room for dessert. 7.  Valet Parking.  I think the sign said Mon-Thu for Lunch - $3.50, and any other time is $5. I went in late April 2016 so it might change. If you do decide to go to the Cheesecake at Marina Del Ray, keep in mind the food isn't the best, you'll likely wait, but the desserts and the view alone is worth a visit."
