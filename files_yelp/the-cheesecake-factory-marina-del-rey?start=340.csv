Michelle S.,"Ontario, CA",257,229,253,2.0,2/26/2014,"I don't know. It's Cheesecake Factory. You know what that means to me? Slightly more upscale TGIFridays. However, something about this location tries to make this Cheesecake Factory seem like you're dining at the freaking Ivy. It's so full of pretension, I wouldn't be surprised if the valet attendants judge you by the kind of vehicle you drive.  Oh, Valet! Why in the world is it necessary to valet your car for an establishment that contains an open and large lot? I learned how to park a very long time ago and I certainly don't mind taking the few extra minutes to make it happen vs paying someone else to do it. Having the option is one thing, but forcing everyone to valet is quite another. I guess it all boils down to the view, which, don't get me wrong, is pretty damn awesome if you're able to sit some place where you can actually appreciate it. And even then, you'll be so starved from waiting over an hour to be seated that your eyes will probably be fixated on the delicious bread basket.  Service here is fine. Food is fine. The menu is VAST and will probably take you about 20 minutes to get through. I like variety and options, though, so I'm not complaining too much. To me, Cheesecake Factories are best in malls. You almost always have an insane wait, so having it located in a mall makes killing time before the meal a breeze. While the view here is amazing, it is probably the only amazing thing you'll be experiencing during your visit. That and the amazing amount of calories you just consumed in one slice of that thawed out cheesecake. Don't get me wrong, Cheesecake Factory serves its purpose, but this location in particular, tries entirely too hard.  Next."
Anna G.,"Chatsworth, CA",388,464,253,3.0,3/28/2015,"So I decided to pull a Ferris Bueller last Tuesday and ditched work to spend the day with my best friends from out of town. One of our stops was Cheesecake Factory as we decided to pregame before dinner. I stuck to our plan and ordered light to save room for our real dinner but they decided to go on the heavier route reassuring me that they would still have room for dinner. Just a lil tidbit on our friendship..it revolves around food. Since our UCLA days we've been major foodies and made it our mission to eat. We plan our days around food and manage to out-eat everyone around us...including our 200+ pound boyfriends.  We stopped by a little after 5 which sucked since we missed their lunch menu but I was planning on ordering off their small plates menu so I didn't care too much. We were able to get seated right away and found a great spot outside, I can't really say much about their food because it's a chain restaurant and every Cheesecake has the same menu. This particular location has a great view which is just an added bonus to their already affordable prices and generous portions. I have recently been hooked on their Asian lettuce tacos and that did it for me as far as pre-dinner went. We ordered the avocado rolls for appetizers and the food tasted right, as I would expect it to.  I was not thrilled about having to valet and pay $5/$6 to have someone park my car a few feet away from the restaurant but it makes sense to charge since it is a beach. If the parking was free then everyone would park there. I don't really have complaints about my experience but the one thing that I can mention is that my friend and I were almost done with our food before my other friend received hers. I had the tacos, Jeannette had pasta, and Fatima's fried chicken(off the menu apparently) didn't make it to the table till I was pretty much done with my meal. Hey..at least I was able to get a piece of her chicken lol. If you're in the area and you feel like eating, grab yourself a Peach Belini and enjoy the views here!!"
Ann N.,"Honolulu, HI",50,327,853,4.0,7/14/2014,"Good food but takes a while. I've been here several times and it is always busy so don't come if you're starving.  Had the special of the day which was a Thai sweet salmon with a coconut sauce. It was good and filling. Ordered table side guacamole but was already made when it was brought out. It was still good  even though we ordered it medium, it was mild. A steak ordered medium rare came out just right.  They only have valet parking. $3.50 for lunch and $4.50 for dinner."
Carl B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/29/2016,"I LOVE This Place!! the menu is like a book, several pages of selections. The food, in my opinion, is always pleasing, the service is always friendly and prompt, the atmosphere is great, especially if you decide to take a stroll along Mother's Beach after you dine. We went there a few days ago for my 64th Birthday, and as always, I loved it. I could go on, but writing this review is making me hungry...."
Ginger C.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,34,1,2.0,11/9/2016,"Long wait even though there were plenty open tables.  Food? MEH, SLOW service.  Conserving electricity, are we? so dark, couldn't see what I was eating.   Valet $6+TIP why? parking lot is right there."
Yael G.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/26/2016,"All my family got stomach pain and nausea from eating  at this location. especially my kids. at other occasion we ordered vegetarian pizza and received it with pepperoni. we ask for a change, and then got the same pizza without the pepperoni, that was removed from the pizza."
Samantha T.,"Essex, MA",4,29,24,3.0,5/26/2015,"I usually love Cheesecake Factory; however, this was a much different experience than I was use to. All the food was good, standard Cheesecake Factory food. However, the noise level was a bit much. It's so loud and crowded inside that it's hard to have a conversation. Also, the service was really bad. At one point we had two waiters, and our main one was rather inattentive. I don't like when waiters are always present, but this guy was never around!! Our first waiter was also very bad- my dad asked what they had on tap, and rather than listing beers, the waiter listed sodas. Overall, it's a cool location but the service, noise, and crowdedness made it probably the worst Cheesecake Factory I've been to."
Jason M.,"Venice, CA",1,12,,1.0,12/20/2016,I've ordered from here for delivery about a dozen times.  The food here is just not very good compared to other cheesecake factory branches.  Fish is overcooked and dry.  Pasta is undercooked.  Rice is super dry.  They randomly decide to not give you any side dishes.  Would not recommend going to this one.
Ti M.,"Jacksonville, FL",741,628,125,4.0,12/16/2013,"Umm..I'm a fan of BIG food.  That is why I love this place.  I told my husband recently that the food seems to have gotten much better over the years.  We attribute it to butter.  They use real butter and lots of it in everything! I always have great service, they have a cheap happy hour, and the food is consistent with all the locations I have hit in Socal.  Oh and kid friendly.  I have 3!  That is super important otherwise I would never eat out...lol! Take aways: 1. BUTTER 2. BIG 3. Kid friendly :) By the way, I am writing this review while a newborn is sleeping on me...I'm amazing..."
Joan K.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,89,20,1.0,1/10/2015,"I was here on Monday for my 1 year anniversary and it surely did not meet my expectations.  I've gone to several cheesecake factories because the food is standard and of course, I love the cheesecake but this specific location needs lots of improvement when it comes to service.   Typically, I expect to wait 30 or more minutes to be seated.  It is usually a given and in this case, it was true.  However, usually after you are seated, service tends to shine.  This time around, once we were seated, it took over ten minutes to see a server.   By the time our server Tim arrived, I ended up ordering drinks and food at once.  We even had to request eating utensils because the table was not set properly.  Tim seemed really annoyed when I placed our order for food, drinks, utensils and bread at the same time.  After some time passed, we finally got some bread delivered but no utensils or drinks.  By the time I got utensils, the bread was cold.  I would have requested a new batch of bread if I knew i would not have to wait long.  I eventually got my utensils and drink just before my food was served.   When my food finally arrived, the server never bothered to return and ask us how our food tasted.  By the time someone came over, it was the manager who had noticed I barely touched my food.  I was already annoyed by the lack of service that I lost my appetite.  This was probably the first time I even chose to leave without cheesecake.  I just wanted to leave."
Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",164,30,75,3.0,6/1/2015,"Not bad, after 36 years of living in the area I got to the Cheesecake Factory for the first time. There is a lot of hype on this place. It's decent food that is seemingly over priced. My sone had the grilled pork chop for $20 at lunch. I had the plain $10 Cesar Salad, was good I mean how can you mess up a Cesar right?  Service was outstanding, people were really busing their  A$$. We had been seated next to the kitchen though, pretty noisy with dishes banging but what are you going to do? The worst part about the place, aside from the crowd and wait is the restaurant set up. You have to walk through the kitchen/serving area to get to the seats. Then if you have to goto the restroom you travel back through that area. All in all the experience was ok, the food was decent but well over priced. The service was amazing. The location could be great if you sit outside. I don't care for the crowds and the layout is just bad."
Eric B.,"Santa Monica, CA",18,292,,4.0,5/24/2014,"The food here is the same as at every Cheesecake Factory on earth: well-executed, semi-upscale for the masses.  Delicious, and huge portions -- they're not shy with the butter, either, which means if you're on a diet, you must share any main course with a friend. The real selling point at this joint is the view.  AMAZING outdoor deck with great views of the marina.  Really lovely. That said... $5 for valet parking mandatory in a mostly empty lot.  That's kinda milking it, no?"
Joseph G.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,6,19,5.0,9/7/2015,"For people who likes sweet and only a bit of alcohol on their drink this is it the"" FLYING GORILLA"" chocolate banana milkshake/dark chocolate and banana liqueurs. W/an appetizer portobello,avocado,&zucchini fries. W/a main course hibachi steak."
Steve S.,"Inglewood, CA",56,12,28,1.0,1/17/2015,This place is terrible the wait is always ridiculous staff is unprofessional instead of helping customers they huddle around each other like caddle in a herd!  The only reason I come back is because I have vouchers to use that's it other than that this place can kiss my azz!
Julie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",201,586,6,3.0,12/22/2013,"Last year, I was very disappointed because I missed out on the seasonal peppermint bark cheesecake.  Well, this year I managed to get a slice before the season was over/it was all sold out.  However, I'm disappointed that I missed the seasonal pumpkin pecan cheesecake!  You mean I have to wait another year?!  I settled for a slice of key lime cheesecake.  Their version is very tart. I tried the southern fried catfish with mashed potatoes, corn, and green beans.  The catfish was very dark in color, but inside it was cooked just right, not dry.  The portions of the sides seemed a bit modest.  I remember when Cheesecake Factory portions were known to be rather huge...Not anymore.  The catfish was adequate with three pieces, but the sides did seem skimpy. Service was efficient, prompt, and friendly."
Francois P.,"Monrovia, CA",3,13,,2.0,4/15/2015,"All I can think about our diner at the Cheesecake Factory is that it was an average experience all-in-all. Nothing went particularly bad, but seating, decor, service and food were just average. I found both my main meal and dessert to be tasteless and disappointing. The cheesecake especially was a let-down. It did not taste anything specific but sugar."
Danelle W.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,12,8,2.0,3/11/2016,"After a long day of shopping my family and I came to the cheesecake factory to have dinner. An early birthday celebration for my son at one f our favorite dine in restaurants. Upon walking in we were greeted by the host. With a warm smile. I asked her if we could sit at the empty both in the bar section. Which we did. Being that we can in around 4:30pm the dinner crowd wasn't fully in affect. I thought this would be the perfect dine in time. Being that we just attended CF on valentines day (need I say more) as we sat down we waited to be acknowledged several waitress and waiters saw us made eye contact but failed to greet us, let alone take our drink orders. This frustrated me, our son was fresh out of school and very hungry. When the waitress Courtney finally came over. She was very sweet, seemed knowledgeable about products, but not attentive whatsoever! I believe she has the potential to be a great server but today wasn't her day. The food was great but the service wasn't so.... :-("
Melanie A.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,7,2,5.0,6/21/2016,I thought i should write a review on here after coming to this location for the first time. I must say it is my favorite location out of the ones i've been to already. Customer service was great i wish i remembered our waiters name! Beautiful location and make sure to SIT OUTSIDE if you enjoy nice views :)
Cecilia D.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/15/2016,"Food is reasonably priced for the portion size, and really tasty. Double espresso was not worth the order - stick to regular coffee for your caffeine fix. Mojito cocktail was one of the best I've tried but came at a price! Service was good and the vibe is great for a casual night out."
Rachel Q.,"Monterey Park, CA",879,1307,1913,3.0,12/3/2013,"This place has an awesome view of the Marina, the only thing I do not like is the forced valet and they don't let you pay first, so unless you have exact change - $3.50, you usually end up giving them a five dollar bill as a forced tip.  I don't mind valet if they actually take your car farther away but when you are perfectly capable of parking yourself, what's the point? Brown bread is always yummy, service with a smile. I also like that they have a ""skinny"" menu. Overall this is a pretty good Cheesecake Factory, minus the parking!"
