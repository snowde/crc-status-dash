Ingrid G.,"Marina del Rey, CA",18,122,47,5.0,5/18/2015,"Living within walking distance I'm a regular at the Cheesecake Factory. Every time I've been here there's been no problem with seating and usually a quick wait (even if it's jammed) if you're coming with a lot of people you need to make a reservation/arrive early or prepare to wait a long time. I always order the vegetable salad with chicken off the skinnylicious menu (how L.A of me) however it's soooo good, and always fills me up even when i don't finish. I have tried so many different varieties of food on the menu and everything is good (especially the molasses bread they give you ughh) One issue might be the service sometimes is slow but give them a break, it gets really busy! In conclusion I love you ccf and always will"
Rob C.,"Los Angeles, CA",93,284,8,1.0,1/6/2015,"how can you go wrong w/ Cheesecake Factory??  cold food practically dropped on your table.  whenever there is a large group that is seated either right before your group or simultaneously, you're in for some spotty service/food.  (there was a group of 40 that came in right before our group of 3.) my orange chicken came out cold.  it looked extremely sad; dried out veggies, dehydrated rice.  half of the sauce was now a dried out stain across my plate.  took a couple bites and asked the waiter to take it back.  our waiter was actually a good guy and tried to make things right but the large dunce who originally brought out my dish, slid one end of my dish across the table, plowing through my utensils and then dropped the other end of the dish.  i felt like i was in a holding cell being served slop by the prison guard.  really man?  A+ for service. the other thing was the restuarant was freezing.  everyone had on their coats at 12 noon."
Dori N.,"Beverly Hills, CA",45,25,14,5.0,8/7/2015,This is the best place to come for lunch with the family. We had lettuce wraps on the light menu and it was delicious and filling. The kids had Mac and cheese and chicken nuggets. The Mac and cheese the kids didn't like. After we went outside which is the best part there was a great yard which I posted pictures right in front the beach. Would definitely come here again!!
Margaret M.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,30,12,4.0,4/1/2016,The Cheesecake Factory is literally just a fancy diner with ridiculously large portions. The food is perfectly fine if you want something quick (takeout) and don't feel like going to a fancy restaurant. They have a cute little spot with fire pits but it's not always open. They also have a pretty good brunch menu but there is usually a long wait.
Doreen M.,"Los Angeles, CA",834,1303,17617,3.0,1/6/2014,"This is the first time I came to this location.  I got the breakfast and didn't realize the portions were so big.  It tasted good.  The breakfast potatoes are not scalloped like the waitress said, they were fried and they were regular breakfast potatoes.  The outdoor seating is 3 levels and narrow so the view is not spectacular.  The outdoor architecture of the space is poorly designed and doesn't maximize the beach front view sadly.  The heaters outdoors seemed to have no middle temperature.  It's either too hot or not enough heat.  I only go to Cheesecake Factory once a year ish as it tries to cater to everyone that it caters to no one and  I'm not much of sweet tooth.  I would come back since it's a pretty consistent experience since it's a chain and it's pretty good, if I got a really nice seat at this location I'd be much happier."
Mariana B.,"Santa Monica, CA",14,14,14,4.0,8/30/2015,"Love it!!! A LOT!!! But the plates are too big and i think the waiter/weitress should warn us. The cheesecake: Amazing!!! I ate at home, since I couldn eat anything else after dinner. XD"
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,4.0,7/16/2012,"Happy Hour 4-6 pm Monday thru Friday.  Closer to the sea, better the Cheesecake. For me, the Redondo Beach is the best Factory location (your life shouldn't end until you're there for a pink sunset). This Marina del Rey spot is my second favorite of Factory locations, if you're lucky you can grab a seat overlooking the basin. Happy Hour at bar area only, but plenty of seaboats in view. Chicken Pot Stickers, TexMex Egg Rolls, Vietnamese Tacos, Dynamite Shrimp Tempura-style, and Ahi Tartare our happy hour faves.  Hold on, my woman is in the bathroom, higher than the Empire State. Wait... that's me, after I've had my Tiramisu Cheesecake. She's going to have to carry me home... tonight. Note: You can't get out of paying for valet here. You would have to park elsewhere quite a distance away for free parking."
Tracy F.,"Chattanooga, TN",71,35,261,5.0,3/9/2016,"I will admit that I rarely dine  at a Cheesecake Factory. But... I go in almost every one I get near. The strawberry martini is one of my favorite drinks. I have had this drink in Las Vegas, Birmingham, Nashville, Atlanta.  It is always the same. They have this one figured out. It is a vodka based martini.  The strawberries are muddled. They shake the drink and then strain out the strawberry seeds. The glass has a sugared rim with a strawberry on the side. It is tasty, sweet and packs a kick. While we were in Marina Del Ray we stopped in to have a drink on the recommendation of a local. The outdoor options were wonderful. We were sitting right on the edge of the harbor. There was a nice breeze and the sky was such a beautiful color. Our server was engaging. He chatted with us every time he came around to check on us. The cheesecakes that were brought out looked amazing. I wish now I had ordered one."
David M.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,73,23,3.0,6/1/2016,"Good happy hour food, great place to avoid traffic during rush...nice locations. Close to home and life is grand"
Aj H.,"Glassell Park, Los Angeles, CA",1,9,1,1.0,7/18/2015,Pro: Great view... Good customer service.  Con: Dirty plates... Found a hair in my food.
Geraldine A.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,25,,1.0,11/2/2014,"WORST!!! If I could have given them ZERO stars, I would. Been there twice now and each time the service was horrible.  The first time, the waiter took 30 minutes to bring us our food. My girlfriend ordered eggs, bacon and toast. When the meal arrived, it was missing the bacon and the eggs were cold. The waiter said, ""The manager will bring your bacon out."" The manager never showed up. We ordered coffee---that took ages to arrive, too. When it did, the waiter neglected to bring cream or sugar. The coffee got cold while we were waiting for him to bring us cream. He never did. The people at the table next to us waited, and waited and waited and waited for their food, but it never arrived either! The second time, we went on a Friday night. It was crowded. The employees behind the ""to-go"" order counter were excellent--efficient, thorough, friendly. Got us our food in good time. Remembered to pack every item. They were fine. But the valet parking service---HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. Slow as molasses. Lazy, inept workers. We waited for our car for 35 minutes. Plenty of valets available, but they all seemed to be moving slow, standing around, dawdling, not doing their job. Inexcusable on a busy Friday night. It put everybody in a foul mood.  NEVER coming here again. I suggest you don't either. Unless you like waiting around and getting frustrated and having your night ruined."
Ghoncheh E.,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, CA",350,35,8,4.0,3/13/2016,"Came here for a friends birthday. We were a party of 9. Love the food. Great service. Unfortunately the hostess at the front was a bit rude. I understand it's her job to lie and give extreme wait times so we leave, but when I walk over and ask how much longer and you tell us 1 more hour and our buzzer goes off 5 minutes later, it's a bit disappointing."
Vanessa B.,"Sawtelle, Los Angeles, CA",125,138,55,3.0,1/8/2015,"In general, I'm pretty indifferent to the Cheesecake Factory chain and rarely eat here since 1) the portions are entirely way too big for one single person (my 1 entree here served as two dinners and one lunch) and 2) it's pretty pricey for a meal.   My roommates and I came here the other night because one of them received a gift card to the Cheesecake Factory and treated us out to dinner.   For drinks: we ordered Moscow Mules - I had the Pineapple one and they had a regular Moscow Mule.  If you like sweet drinks, then I would definitely recommend the Pineapple Moscow Mule.  The drinks were strong enough without it being too ""alcoholic"" tasting because of the sweetness of the pineapple.   For appetizers: we ordered the Pretzel Chicken which were delicious! They were pretzel-breaded chicken on skewers and came with two different dipping sauces - unsure what exactly what kind they were but both tasted like different kinds of honey mustard and had good flavors For dinner: I had the Pasta Da Vinci - penne pasta with chicken, mushroom and onion in a Madeira Sauce. I thought the pasta was a little too oily for my taste and the proportions were not well balanced - there was very little chicken, mushroom and onion compared to the overwhelming amount of penne pasta.  In addition, my pasta was not consistent - in the sea of penne pasta, i found 1 spaghetti noodle, 1 macaroni elbow and 1 farfalle pasta.  Don't get me wrong, it didnt bother me at all and I ate them gladly but as a critical perspective of the restaurant, I think that seeing how this is a farily nice chain restaurant, there are certain standards that should be met and upheld.  This just seems like there is no quality control in the kitchen.  For dessert: I had the Smore's cheesecake, which I took to go since I was already so full - tried some the next day and it was excellent! I love all kinds of cheesecake though and especially chocolate so my opinion may be biased.   Service: I thought it was passable - our waitress did the bare minimum - got our orders correct, but she didn't ask in the middle of our entree how we were doing or if the food was ok.   Parking: it's Valet only and at night it costs $4.50 which I think is kind of a rip off  but then again it's Marina Del Rey so it was expected.  However, the valet attendant was driving with not the most extreme care with my car - when he was driving to pull up, he ran into a orange cone and it dragged in the front of my car for about a few feet before he realized what was wrong.  Even though there was no damage to the car, I was pretty pissed because I'm paying for a service that I don't need since I'm capable of parking my own car and also entrusting my car in the hands of someone else, which they failed to do so with care.   Probably won't come back here again because there's other good restaurants worth while eating at but the view outside was nice since it looked out of the Marina."
Tiffany W.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",11,25,38,3.0,5/21/2015,"Very busy location can be a bad thing. From the start, the valet costs $4.50, and not knowing my options, I begrudgingly checked in my car. I learn now there is a self park lot nearby. The hostess is tucked in past the bar and dessert counter which can be confusing for a first time diner in a congested lobby. Beautiful location for patio dining overlooking the marina. Staff provided excellent, friendly service. Chicken Madiera with potatoes is listed as a favorite, and it was good. It was not worth the 17.95 price though.  As expected, the peanut butter cheesecake I brought home was amazing."
Alfonso C.,"Baldwin Park, CA",213,15,2,1.0,3/16/2016,Seriously waited an hour to get appetizers. Drink was done wrong.. Apparently a blue moon is needed for an old fashioned? Worst service ever.
Mike W.,"Glendora, CA",0,9,5,3.0,5/11/2016,"We were there on Sunday with a party of 5 and hostest was seating us for a party of 4 which didnt make sense. So although we enjoyed a very nice dinner we wasnt exactly satisfied with the service, being the hostest was not very pleasant."
Diana W.,"San Francisco, CA",73,413,48,4.0,10/6/2013,"We stopped in today to take some church friends to lunch here...it's a friendly and happening location. Food is consistent to the chain.  Service is friendly.  Definitely an asset to the chain, for sure!   It has indoor seating, typical CF styling, comfy and open.  Indoor windows look out on the marina.  It also has a really nice patio that has a beautiful view of the marina...most people wait to sit outside here.  We didn't, since the couple we brought was elderly...indoor was less bright for them. TIP: If you visit, the parking is ONLY valet.  It is $5- cash per car.  (it seems well organized) The cheesecakes and cakes looked awesome as usual, but I was too full to try one :( Pumpkin and Pumpkin Pecan are both there now!  Enjoy!"
Anthony M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,4.0,5/8/2016,This is one of my favorite location for cheesecakes! The view is excellent here! The service is average Cheesecake Factory service:) what I like here the most is how conveniently it's located in the heart of Marina Del Ray:) I recommend going this location!
Maria A.,"Cerritos, CA",30,12,15,3.0,4/17/2016,Wow I honestly would had loved to give this place a 5 star just because it's so beautiful! But wow this place is so small! Everyone is friendly and food was great! But never come in on a busy night! We Waited maybe like an hour plus food it was an hour and half and there was no space to wait. You can literally wait in the kitchen it's just right in front of you and waiters are just walking there. Very hectic!
Jason B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,,1.0,10/12/2016,"The service here is a hit or miss. The waiters/waitresses seem to not really care for customer service 100% other than the general greetings. This place has become more of a production line of food than a place to go on an special occasion. Food is not bad but we were waiting 20 minutes for our food after appetizers, to the point we were ready to jet out. Used to love Cheesecake Factory but now it's more like an iHop now."
