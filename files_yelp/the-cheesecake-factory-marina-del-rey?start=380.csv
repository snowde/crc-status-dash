Sherry C.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,29,72,4.0,5/20/2014,"I give 5 stars for service, there are some lovely ppl working there  I give 4.5 stars for the view if you sit outside, don't sit inside though it is really noisy and dark, you pay for the ambience so it not worth the price  I give 3.8 star for the food and the cheese cake, the food is okay, not really exciting or delicious, the food is okay.  A piña colada is $9.5, most the dishes are over $15 , cheese cake is $7.5, for a lunch for two cost us over $80 so it's a bit pricy, but the overall experience seems matches the cost, we will go back I think."
Robert A.,"Inglewood, CA",22,72,151,4.0,4/11/2015,Food was good and freshly made.  I had the sausage and shrimp pasta and if was delicious. I took half home for lunch the next day and it was just as good.  We also had the chicken nachos appetizer and it was good and filling.  Nice selection of food and let's not even talk about the cheesecake.
irol c.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,3,2.0,12/28/2015,Very disappointed this time and over 30 minutes waiting for our dessert after ordering' tad ridiculous but our server Nica (?) was adorable!
Marsha B.,"Bloomington, IN",137,20,12,1.0,12/11/2015,"So we're at the Cheesecake Factory this man allowed his two kids to toss toys and play at my table! I did not say anything until the kid's toy was almost in my drink and they had to touch me to retrieve the toy. I then asked the father to have his children play closer to his table. He said ok sorry ""come here before you catch something."" I asked like what? Manners? Degrees? I have both! I'm upset that I had to say something in the first place! I asked for a manager, who was extremely nice and was just as upset! I thought he handled the situation with integrity and sensitive. Others walked over to our table after we had been relocated to the other side of the patio to apologize and acknowledge the severity of his comment and actions. It was very dishearten."
Fiona S.,"Marin County, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/24/2016,"Waited 40 minutes for an appetizer, entree, and dessert to go. Staff did not give us the time of day when we inquired about the wait time nor did they offer any compensation when originally telling us the wait time was 15-20 minutes. I have not been previously satisfied with the service here in the past but this was the worst service by far."
Faisal B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",1,16,,2.0,9/20/2016,Good quality wasn't that great. It had a nice view but the food wasn't really appealing. Their chicken tasted frozen and didn't have texture. The vie was amazing though
Chris S.,"Philadelphia, PA",169,234,106,2.0,1/2/2015,South Bay Location is better. Parking. No choice but valet parking at 4.50 during visit. Overcrowded versus Redondo as well. GF got your favorite dish (Jambalaya Pasta w/chicken and shrimp) Tasted better at Redondo location.  The white chicken chili was ok. Was loaded with an abundance of scallions and green onions that overpowered the remainder of the dish. My main entree was my go-to. Chicken Romano. Cheesecake's version of Chicken Parm. Thankfully they did not mess this up.
Hey T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,15,5.0,9/9/2014,"Folks complain about wait time and leave 3 stars? come-on, what can TCF do about wait lines? Because many people go there to eat? Write your name to list, go down to outdoor deck to have a drink and enjoy your moment. Food, service, location, price everything is great, I am loving TCF - Marina Del Rey !! Most people dont know about their outdoor deck-waiting area, ask for it!"
Mali N.,"Yokosuka, Japan",65,17,74,4.0,9/23/2014,"Love, love, love The Cheesecake Factory. It's a must any time I fly in from Japan. I do think the portions can be a little smaller. Other than that, very satisfied customer."
John F.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,4/8/2016,Very great quality and staff was super attentavie will be back again. Their steak tacos were great
Tina M.,"Tustin, CA",35,59,,3.0,3/5/2016,"Came here last night, because I was staying at the hotel right next door and was craving some cheesecake.  The drink and cheesecake were standard Cheesecake Factory quality, but the service was lacking.  We came a little over a hour before closing and sat in the bar area.  It took a while for a server to come to our table...server was nice, but we probably would've ordered a few more drinks if he would've checked up on us more...at least when our drinks were out."
Mandana B.,"Long Beach, CA",179,245,418,4.0,6/26/2013,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory! I also like the Redondo Beach location, but the Marina Del Rey location is by far better location. It's best to go here on a warm summer night and sit in the outdoor patio area. it feels like you are on vacation! I'm a fan of their mini menu that they serve for the outdoor seating because most everything on the menu is a ""small bite""  This is a must see location if you are a Cheesecake Factory fan. I've always received great service here.   PRO's - Location  - Food - Staff CON's  - Valet parking - Wait time"
M. P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,44,,5.0,2/14/2016,"We had dinner here tonight, and were so impressed with the efficiency of the staff. Such a busy night (Valentine's Day) and the food was still excellent, served quickly, delicious, and hot. Our server, Antonio, was one of the best servers we've had EVER. Personable, professional, and really made our special time enjoyable."
Eitan A.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,14,,3.0,9/25/2016,"The place is nice, the portions are very big. Huge cake selections can be attractive to those who like cakes. While one can find some vegan options, I would not highly recommend for vegans..."
Bernie L.,"Redlands, CA",1411,94,193,5.0,9/19/2014,"Superb Service! Except the Valet who wasn't too friendly.... At the end of my stay, the valet again pulled my car up to another couple. Clearly he was a moron with his own preconceived notions. However this place is so good I still give it 5 stars! The cooking is ALWAYS Great! And the personnel inside the establishment are Super Super Nice, courteous, and efficient! It is a well run ship, except for the barnacle asshole valets in the parking lot...no tip for them..."
Görkem Ü.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,36,13,4.0,2/10/2015,"Best location so far in L.A, been 10 times already. Patio has great view (day-time beach, night-time moon). There is a public parking right behind better than waiting valet. Be prepared for line. Service were awesome."
Erika M.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",217,338,591,4.0,8/21/2014,Great selection of food as with any Cheesecake Factory. You have the option of seating inside or outside. The establishment itself is pretty large and I have never had a problem while here; the wait staff is nice and the food is served quickly and always very good.
Tricia M.,"Seal Beach, CA",201,454,985,5.0,8/29/2014,"Why don't I go to Cheesecake Factory more often? Is it a thing to only eat here for nice events and dates and whatnot? They need to make a Cheesecake Factory to-go. That might be impossible with the extensive menu, but... I just wanna have a slice of cheesecake delivered to me. Despite the chain's reputation for having high-caloric, fat-filled, carb-loaded dishes, they do have a good amount of healthy options. The Thai chicken lettuce wraps were huge (although there could be more chicken...) and the chopped veggie salad was just okay. And if you're going to a factory of cheesecake, it becomes a duty to have a slice. I tried the macadamia nut caramel cheesecake, something I wouldn't normally get, but it was really good! The crust is sticky sweet, and the crunchy macadamia nuts balance out that thick, oozy caramel. They split the cheesecake in half for us... but, I think I prefer sharing the slice on one plate. That way, I can either eat it all.. or just a bite.. depending if I like it or not. I mean, because its more romantic to have it one plate obviously. Hahh."
Zack L.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,4,,1.0,11/14/2015,"I called to make reservations for my girlfriends birthday, so I could treat her to a nice dinner. Not only was I told that reservations are not able to be made on the weekends, but was also told that she is not allowed to disclose typically how long one would wait on a weekend. ""I am not allowed to disclose that"". Seriously? What a joke. Worked in the restaurant business and customer service jobs for years. Talk about lack of transparency. I've never eaten here and will continue not to. The lady on the phone was rude, snobbish and I encourage others to not support such attitudes."
Riri K.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,15,,1.0,9/6/2015,"It was such an embarrassment, they don't know how to manage their own restaurant. We got a gift card and one of the waiters lost it so we asked what to do, the manager said its fine just keep the receipt with you for next time. We want there a few weeks later with a guest & tried to use the gift card, and they said that's been used obviously not by us. But the manger didn't care and embarrassed us in front of our friend and more importantly lost a regular customers due to her lack of good judgment. I still can't believe what happened. Never going back there again"
