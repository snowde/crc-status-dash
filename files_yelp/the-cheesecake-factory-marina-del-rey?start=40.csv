Maurice T.,"Los Angeles, CA",307,193,260,5.0,8/4/2016,"Let me start by saying this could have been a different review but ONE person changed it. DOMINIC, young African American with dreads did a phenomenal job with us. After being seated and not being waited on for over 30 minutes Dominic came over and asked if anyone had helped us, we told him no. He started asking what we wanted and he would get it started. I told him it was ok and he wouldn't have it. He took our order and got us our drinks very promptly. After we had our drinks our actual waiter came by and asked if we were ready to order, I politely told him not from him especially after 46 minutes at the table. I asked Dominic to continue to take care of us which he did and he did a great job apologizing at every opportunity. I told him the fact he was watching our table and others means he has a eye for customer service!  I saw others around us being served and am not sure what happened with our server but it is what it is. But Dominic did the most kind hearted thing and didn't throw his coworker under the bus and showed he would take one for the team by engaging us and helping us through the problem. Not sure if the staff or management actually read this but this gentleman needs to be praised for having the employees, and companies back by working that much harder. Grey job!"
Shannon C.,"Albuquerque, NM",801,647,1222,1.0,1/24/2017,"NO! I had a VERY STRANGE experience here. The wait was normal (45 minutes or so on a weekend) and 4 of us were seated on the patio. 20 minutes later with no server, I asked a busboy who our server was supposed to be. His personal conversation with another busboy couldn't be interrupted. I went inside to the hostess desk and she said she'll send a waiter out. The waiter arrived and we ordered a bottle of wine. 20 minutes later he drops off the bottle of wine, unopened, and without glasses, and leaves. We flag down another waiter for glasses, a request he doesn't understand because at this point he thinks we brought our own bottle. We have this second waiter just take the unopened bottle of wine away. Original waiter returns and 3 out of 4 of us order before he wanders off after asking my mother how she wants her side salad cooked. He was completely non-verbal beyond this bizarre question. I was actually wondering if he was having a medical emergency. 3 entrees arrive extraordinarily quickly (like 6 minutes after ordering!), dropped off by the manager. He asked how our evening was going, to which I replied ""Kinda the worst!"" I explain to him that 1. we waited forever at our table and had to ask multiple times for a waiter, 2. we didn't receive water or a bread basket like the tables around us (who had different waiters), 3. that a bottle of wine was dropped off without being opened and without glasses (to which he said ""what bottle?"" and looks around), and that 4. one of us was skipped during ordering. The manager goes to the hostess area, comes back and informs us that we've only been there ""50 minutes."" Completely irrelevant, and also a lie. I show him 1 hour 9 minutes on my timer. He never apologizes, but mutters about how maybe all the glasses were dirty and they need to do dishes. At this point he realized that I don't have food, and nobody has drinks, and insists, condescendingly, ""Honey, let me bring you some food. I don't want you to starve."" I left and had great cocktails & dinner at Settebello Pizzeria. (Note: This review is from December 2015 and was hanging out in my drafts. I still feel the story's worth telling, even though it's a bit late.)"
Tina E.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,41,15,4.0,11/20/2017,Haven't been to a cheesecake in a while. Decided to come for happy hour had  a great waiter Blake. He was on point fast and very considerate.  Great job cheesecake for hiring some cool people
Rachel O.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,30,2,5.0,11/16/2017,"Wow. Their Sunday brunch just became Saturday too. If you want amazing pancakes, great coffee, lovely view, and a refreshing morning after the Marina Del Rey Farmer's Market, come here. It's a great spot. The patio is lovely all times of day, and super romantic at night. Also, after a few brunches, I decided to have my son's birthday party at this location due to the kid's park at mothers beach, just steps away. And Mark, the manager, and Christina were fantastic to deal with. I did spend money on their food for the event, but they went above and beyond to make sure it was nice. Thank you for your amazing brunch and your lovely people, Cheesecake Factory MDR! No wonder the lines are so long to get in!"
Day K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,2,5.0,7/2/2017,"I have this thing for this particular Cheese Cake Factory. The location location location is absolutely fantastic. I always sit outside where you get a fantastic view of the marina. The cool breeze and the lights of the buildings in the distance make for a beautiful sight. I've been coming here once a week for the past two months after a long hiatus. I've never had bad service and the food has always been extremely consistent.  I'll usually order one of two chicken dishes, the chicken costoletta or the parmesan herb crusted chicken. Both dishes are served with mash potatoes and asparagus. Portions are pretty big so I'll usually eat two thirds of it."
Bruce H.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",1,107,345,3.0,4/21/2017,"I would do 3.5 stars if I could but, it's a Cheese Cake Factory so it's has the same plates as all the rest but what's special about this one is the ambience.   How many Cheese Cake Factory's sit on the water with a marina view?  On a perfect sunny  spring southern California day, you can't beat it.  All I wanted to do was drink bloody Mary's and melt into my chair but I had my kids with me so..... Great place to hang with the family, you have mothers beach in front of you and surrounded by bike paths."
Mairena S.,"Los Angeles, CA",80,5,3,5.0,8/19/2017,"I love cheesecake factory one of my favorite places .. but tonight was a really good experience servers was great. Also thanks to Cheyenne for a great customer service,,  food was delicious,, drinks don't make me talk they wore on point ..  Bday lady"
Sierra P.,"Rialto, CA",70,3,,1.0,12/18/2017,Everytime I visit this location I encounter a rude counter server by the name of Marion. He has a terrible attitude and is extremely unapproachable. I've seen multiple reviews mentioning his awful service and yet nothing seems to be done about it. I won't be returning.
Fannie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,17,5.0,3/8/2017,"My all time favorite restaurant! The service is always great and the servers are always very attentive.  My favorite dish here is the spicy chicken chipotle pasta, and sometimes I get it over rice (so amazing). Everything here is amazing, from the appetizers, entrees to the amazing cheesecakes! Can never go wrong going to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory!"
Pasta K.,"Morrisville, NC",22,10,1,1.0,12/27/2017,"Ordered 5 items for delivery through door dash.  Get a call from door dash 30 minutes later telling me they were out of one of the chicken dishes I ordered and I needed to replace the order for the one dish (all other items had been ordered). I went thru door dash again and ordered another chicken dish.  1 hour later I only receive the one chicken dish.  The original order had been completely canceled.  The cheese cake factory should have called me directly to figure out what I wanted to replace the order with.  They have a tablet with all of my information from door dash.   I called and spoke to the manager at tcf and he just put the blame on door dash.    First of all, it's your fault for having a menu item on their website that is unavailable.  Second, your food must come from frozen bags or else you would have been able to create the original chicken dish.  Very poor management and execution.  The one chicken dish that finally arrived was ice cold and in one word just sucked."
Alejandra O.,"Hawthorne, CA",118,9,,1.0,10/29/2017,"Whoever the heavy set hispanic lady wearing a dress is on 10/29/17 8pm-ish was rude. My friend & I went to go give her our names for a table& we we got to her she didn't even look at us she just continued laughing & talking to other workers. When she finally decided she was done talking, we decided we were done being there & left the restaurant. Bad service!!!!!!!!!!"
Ahtziri A.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/16/2017,The worst customer service ever!! the food was awful dry and cold I sat down outside and it was the worst experience ever the outside heaters they literally have them so hi that I couldn't even  enjoy my meal the entire time the heat was burning my shoulders and back I ask the server several times to lower the heat and someone else complain so they put it right back it was an awful awful experience  Never going back
Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,379,201,5.0,6/22/2017,"My wife, granddaughter, and I were meeting my adult daughter for lunch at Cheesecake. We were seated for about 10 minutes when I got a call from my daughter that she was in a car accident on the way to meet us. Our server immediately insisted that we leave and not worry about paying for anything that he had served. . In addition he brought us a to-go cup filled with ice water for my granddaughter. Now that is what I call outstanding customer service. I will definitely return to the Cheesecake Factory for a full meal."
Angelo V.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,2,8,1.0,10/19/2017,This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a Cheesecake Factory. If I could leave zero stars I would. This would probably explain why there was no wait time. Myself and two others ordered our food and all three dishes came out improperly served. Both spicy cashew chicken plates were extremely salty it was inedible. The medium well cheeseburger that I got came rare! It was so disgusting I lost my appetite. 20 min later after getting my burger the french fries come out. Seriously? I didn't order my burger as an appetizer and my fries as my entree... geez. Extremely disappointed and sadly my friends and I were looking forward to this evening. We will not be back. To top it off my drink wasn't even good. So I couldn't even buzz my way though this horrific experience.
Sandi T.,"Inglewood, CA",148,36,6,2.0,10/9/2017,Currently Here For Lunch and At The Bar It's a Big Pit Bull and the owner is claiming it's a service dog. I asked the manager was that a service dog because the dog lacked the service dog tag or vest and he said he spoke with her and she said yes. She did NOT provide any documentation (paperwork etc...) all service dogs in the state of California MUST have some type of sign so it is known to be a service dog. This dog is barking and begging for food come on this dog is NOT a service dog lol it's really pissing me off. The bar area reeks of dog and it's disgusting. I wish I could leave but I have to get back to work.
Brendan T.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,20,,2.0,8/20/2017,"For a place called the cheesecake factory a person would expect some kind of moderately factory esc precision in the timely delivery of cheesecake goodness to mouths. we ordered cheesecake to go, paid and got our drinks. We then proceeded to wait by the to go counter for at least 20 minutes for 2 slices of cheesecake to be placed in plastic containers. This gave me time to observe the operation and why it is going wrong and become rather unimpressed. There was a single person slicing and plating all of the orders in a busy restaurant that specialises in cheesecake.  This poor fellow had to do each order and traverse behind a long counter for no apparent reason walking around the other staff in this narrow space to set the orders  in place for the servers. We even saw him have to leave and go to a store room for supplies. Has someone running this place with an analytical mind has ever stood in this operation and watched what was going on? Maybe it would not be an insane idea to make this big enough for the staff to work and have more people there so the customers could get their food? Its just hard to watch. We were here sitting down once before for cheesecake and the wait was bad then too. The good: nice patio and pretty building. Cheesecake is good if over sweetened. The bad: Inadequate washroom facilities. Valet only parking. The ugly: You will wait a loong time for no apparent reason."
Lisa M.,"Henderson, NV",144,125,13,2.0,10/21/2017,"SUPER POOR SERVICE. From the first moment we walked in, I was greeted by a lazy hostess who asked if I wanted to sit inside or outside. When I said outside she happily said to get out quickly because there is no wait and I needed to go out with my party. We went to the outside area and I told the girl we needed a table for 4 adults and 3 kids. She then proceeded to rudely cut me off and left TO LOOK FOR A TABLE.. yes - the hostess left us there while she was walking around the place checking for a table. Then, some short Asian dude (looked like a manager) came and said there were no more tables and the place was packed. I explained we were just told to come out there to be seated right away and he was like no. Then, the hostess came back and told him there were no tables but tried coming up with a solution but the dude said no and said we could sit in the lounge area or leave. I asked how long it would be and the answer was ""long"". We decided to do the lounge as we were all there already. We sat at a table and asked the waiter to turn in the little heater but guess what: not working. We are something quickly and left. If we didn't have three hungry toddlers we would have left right away. While Cheesecake Factory is in general three stars (foodwise) this place was subpar because of management and service."
Patty R.,"Los Osos, CA",125,101,17,5.0,7/6/2017,"We came here for Father's Day. Yeah, may have been crazy on a busy day..but Mother's Day is worse! I had gone to the Fresno location a month before and fell in love with the chicken and waffles eggs benedict so knowing the Marina location near my childhood home in Venice was still there, I convinced everyone we HAD to go there! With 4of us wait was not bad. CF is usually busy, so I was not going to complain about a long wait. They told us 40 minutes..I think the wait was maybe 30. We sat outside and ordered a drink..didn't even get a sip in before they paged us. I ordered the chicken and waffles again. This was same as in Fresno. Nice crispy waffles, with crispy, tender boneless chicken pieces with poached egg on top. The maple butter was nice on the side. The crispy potatoes maybe twice fried..but they had a nice crisp crunchy texture. Usually side breakfast potatoes can be undercooked, chewy, overcooked, etc..these were nice! We ended with a shared slice of lemoncello cake that was nice and light.  All in all a great meal sitting outside on a nice day overlooking the beach!"
Aleco A.,"Bothell, WA",0,2,1,2.0,11/13/2017,"Well, let's just get started by saying that it was 43 minutes to get our drinks. The view is nice and really peaceful, but with that being said I wouldn't come here unless you only are coming for the view. I asked for a Rare Steak and it came back medium. The alcohol is full of ice and when I asked for a soda, it also came back packed with ice. Also the pasta is really soupy and lacks taste. Parking is $6.50 and the vallet guy was a douchebag. Overall I'd say, just stay away from this overpriced place. You are only paying for the view and parking, the food is TERRIBLE."
Mehmet Ali B.,"Maltepe, Turkey",0,11,5,5.0,4/16/2017,"Good atmosphere, delicious foods and deserts... Hot coffee, fine deserts in the cold night."
