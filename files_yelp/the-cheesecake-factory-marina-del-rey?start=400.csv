Bruce S.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",27,33,,5.0,2/19/2015,"We went there for lunch during the week around noon. Even though it was busy, we were able to be seated right away. We had a table outside so we were able to relax and look at the boats while we had lunch. We had not been here for quite a while and I have no idea why. It was fantastic.  We both ordered off the Skinnylicious menu. For lower (not low) cal menu items they were really tasty. I had the lettuce tacos and we split the shrimp rolls.  As good as the food and the environment was, the service was the best thing about our lunch. Our server Jeffrey G was great. He had a great attitude, made suggestions from the menu, always smiling, and was right there with iced tea refills. We couldn't have been happier with the service."
Al C.,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,2.0,2/26/2016,"Service was terrible! Went for dinner with my parents, my wife, son and daughter.  Was initially told the wait would be 10-15 minutes, ended up waiting 30 minutes.  After sitting for some time we eventually grabbed our waiter to order. Then waited for the food to arrive, and waited, and waited! Eventually my fathers meal arrived at the same time as my daughter's. Approximately 10 minutes later my Mothers food arrived, then another 8-10 minutes later my wife's arrived, and 3-5 minutes after that my son's arrived, no sign of mine, or any apology or excuse. Eventually after my family had finished eating their meals, my filet mignon arrived, without the fries and onion rings that were ordered with it, so I asked the escaping waiter where the rest of my meal was, he explained it was on it way. Again, I waited, and waited eventually, about 10 minutes the fries and onion rings appeared but of course by now the steak was cold, do I asked the waiter to reheat it and to bring the steak knife that I asked for 3 times previously, only to be told...... ""Sorry, we don't have any clean steak knives, they have all been used and we are waiting for them to be washed up!!!"" My steak came back 3-5 minutes later nice and hot but of course by now the fries and onion rings were cold. I simply eat the steak, which rated good and left the fries. My Father was so upset, he called the manager over and explained that in 60 years of working in the catering industry he had never experienced such bad service and insisted the manager remove the steak from the bill, the manager did so and tried defending the bad service by saying it's not usually this bad, ""we're just so busy, look around, they don't seem unhappy!"" We paid the bill and left, and will not return."
Meg C.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,,1.0,9/1/2015,"Wow. Just awful service. Over an hour for our food. My daughters salmon was burnt. My sons hotdogs were legit stinky, like rancid stinky. The waiter just kept forgetting to do everything we asked for. More water, ketchup, anything, he just would plum forget. Also, the waiter dropped some mini corn dogs on my daughter. Like Fresh out of the fryer, scolding hot, corn dogs. He cleared away food from the table without asking, just started piling plates and we couldn't stop him before it was too late. Just a terrible experience overall. Which is too bad because we just moved across the street from this place and would have likely been here a lot, but nope, not making that mistake again."
Corina R.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",59,345,202,4.0,12/8/2014,"Oh my, what can you say about the cheesecake factory except their menu is about 20 pages long. They serve everything and it is all pretty good. I especially enjoy their salads.  this service is always amazing and prompt. And of course you cannot leave there without a piece of cheesecake. Even if you take it to go it is well worth it. The Godiva chocolate is my favorite"
Lauren M.,"San Francisco, CA",515,314,15,4.0,6/24/2013,"Totally my guilty pleasure. I still don't understand how they have such a giant menu that spans all food genres and ethnicities...there can only be one answer- frozen and pre-prepared food. I'm going to look the other way. Everything that comes out of the kitchen I would eat, everything. Spinach and cheese dip? Yum. Buffalo chicken blasts? Get in my belly. Thai lettuce wraps? Come to me.  Tristan HAD to have the Godiva Chocolate Brownie Ice Cream Sundae...which he's been talking about for weeks now, so we went for some light appetizers to prep for our main course of dessert. I started with the Avocado Eggrolls, which is one of my favorite dishes anywhere and are so good and so popular I don't think I need to even explain, and he had the Thai Lettuce Wraps. I wanted the Strawberry Shortcake but they were out :( so I had the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake while he had his sundae.  This location is ALWAYS packed, even though it is astonishingly huge and overlooks the beautiful marina. We snagged a hightop table in the bar area so didn't have to wait, but even at 8:45 pm on a Sunday, the place was teeming with people and there was a 30 minute wait for a table. Valet is $4.50."
Ana M.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,27,42,3.0,10/18/2014,Good overall food with a huge menu. The setting is nice especially if you're sitting outside. The food portions are really big too. The grilled artichoke is very tasty and I do recommend. Good for groups and really it's all about the cheesecake.
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,6/2/2014,"Expectations always met; great patio; great drinks; great big portions.  You can't beat it.  You know what you're going to get.  (PS.  As Yelp'ers, we like a little mystery and tend to go to boutique places) * Bread & Butter: It's free!  Amazing and usually warm, a dark bread (like squaw) and a baguette.  More please!?! * Large menu / large food: Pages and pages of selections, and always leftovers.  Each plate is 2-3 portions.  My favs: Chinese Chicken Salad, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Famous Factory Meatloaf, Chicken and Biscuits, Orange Chicken, Chicken Marsala and Mushrooms.  Ultimate favorite?  Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp. * Great appetizers: Try the Parmesan-Garlic Cheese Bread, Avocado Eggrolls, Tex Mex Eggrolls, Ahi Carpaccio, and the Fried Calamari.  I nearly like the apps more than the food. * Cheesecake: galore!  My favs are: Carrot Cake Cheesecake, White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake , Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake, Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake, but my absolute fav, Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel Cheesecake.  (note: I repeated the word ""Cheesecake"", because I can't get enough of it.  Cheesecake!) =========================== What makes this location unique? =========================== * Wonderful patio: The best patio of the whole chain!  Big, really big, overlooking a beach and part of the marina. * Service: always nice, always well-trained.  Maybe a little hard to flag down because they cover a wide area, especially if on the patio (walking to/fro), and are busy. * Valet parking: optional, but you may want it or drive around looking for awhile. * The wait: Always, and expect at least 45 mins. It's worth it."
Laura D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1368,948,3941,4.0,11/20/2010,"Sometimes you just gotta get takeout.  Had Joey in the car with me so called ahead and ordered, parked in the curbside service spots, walked Joey for 5 minutes, then called in and they brought out my order. Whatever you order from CF is enough for at least two meals.  I got the chicken caesar salad and the chicken madeira, which is the restaurant's most popular dish. This time the caesar salad was so good I ate it all!  It was covered in dressing which I usually don't like, but it was so tasty and had so much parmesan cheese, it was irresistible. I tasted the chicken madeira, which as usual was pretty heavy on the sauce and cheese, so I just drain it a little.  Took a few bites, put a few bites on top of Joey's dog food, and froze the rest. If you go early, when they open at 11.30, you can get in and out pretty fast. Otherwise, it's one of those places that's almost always mobbed.  And why not -- so many choices, and you can smell the sea air and watch the pretty people while you're there. A cool place in my hood."
Utah F.,"Mapleton, UT",2,111,4,4.0,7/19/2016,"marina del Ray , 1 block away from the Marriott  -goat cheese beet appetizer- 9 -buffalo chicken tenders- 9- yummy weird mix with bufolo dipping sauce -dynamite shrimp-7 not like of changs. dipping sauce not marinated."
Ami T.,"Torrance, CA",153,306,75,4.0,5/12/2013,"This is my favorite cheesecake factory. The outside patio seating is really nice, it's a great place to take out of town guests to. Always good service. Convenient valet parking. Wide variety of food. And they are open till pretty late on weekends.  When you hear the name cheesecake factory, you think of gigantic, 2000 calories plate of food. Well, not so much anymore. On my recent visit, I saw that they have a new ""skinnylicious"" menu which has many healthy options (all the salads are under 590 calories). Lots of vegetarian options as well. I tried the Endive and Roasted Pear salad, and it was quite good.  Thanks to the skinnylicious menu, cheesecake factory does not have to be once-in-a-while-over-indulgence kinda place."
Ivy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,157,310,4.0,5/31/2013,"Decided to take the family out to dinner just coz I wanted to be spoiled and not cook that night LOL After celebrating a cousin's birthday at the Cheesecake Factory at the Grove, I wanted to try one closer to home and chose the Marina Del Rey location. Not only was the food ten times better here, but the view outside was amazing and when the sun set we were kept warm from the cool ocean breeze with heat lamps. The service was well paced and right on cue (despite us taking forever to order lol)  For the appetizer, we had the avocado egg rolls and for dinner the Jamaican black pepper shrimp plate (complete with rice, black beans, planktons and mango salsa). I love meals with a little kick to it. And that shrimp was ballin'!!   If I weren't so stuffed (or driving), I would have ordered the Georgia Peach Bellini (A must have, I found out about at the Grove location).   I really enjoyed my visit here and hope to come back for another round of Jamaican shrimp and a Peach Bellini :)"
J C.,"Carson, CA",133,114,8,4.0,8/23/2014,"We came and apparently their electricity went out and just came back on, said there would be at least a 30  minute wait. Obviously there were people ahead of us; we took our chances and decided to stay.. 10 minutes later we got seated.  Love their food, great service."
Aaron G.,"Inglewood, CA",0,7,5,4.0,4/16/2015,"Went last night to dinner with my fiance, the view outside is perfect. Valet was okay, but food it wasnt nothing really that special. Her ceasar salad needed more flavor, and well im sure it wasnt there specialty plate, however i would have thought they had amazing top notch food. But i can be wrong. At the end they are a cheesecake specialty you can say, and theyre cheesecake is just great."
Dennise B.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/27/2016,"We haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in years. We used to come to this one because the patio seating was so nice, but this experience was a nightmare. The seating staff was unorganized and couldn't figure out how to seat anyone. We asked for outside and were seated inside. We heard another customer complain that they asked for inside and were taken out to the patio. The food was mediocre. The atmosphere was terrible. We felt like cattle being herded and it was extremely noisy. An awful experience. With so many great restaurants near, don't waste your time here."
Mark N.,"West Hills, CA",173,823,4625,3.0,9/7/2011,"In general, Cheesecake Factory is pretty good for meeting a group of people.  This is about the only time I will frequent the restaurant. Pros: Large menu - something for everyone, large portions, cheesecake. Cons: No reservations, large menu - can never decide, service is average at best. This particular location is nice.  It overlooks the water and the patio is great when there is a slight breeze. I usually get the jambalaya pasta or the meatloaf.  This particular time I tried the chopped steak.  It was pretty good.  We were seated quickly, but the service was lacking.  It took about 15 minutes to get drinks and another 10 minutes on top of that to get bread.  After finally ordering, our foods comes about 50 minutes after we sat down.  We had other things to do, so we took our cheesecake to go."
Aidan M.,"Montgomery, TX",10,196,22,4.0,10/15/2014,"I am deducting the star because they undercooked my wife's pasta. It didn't even look cooked. The manager was very apologetic, offered something else to eat and applied a full refund of the item. On the positive side my family and I ordered potato tots, fried Mac and cheese (unbelievably good!), salmon, chicken tenders (most tender I have ever tasted!!) and filet mignon (cooked perfectly). The apple streusel cheese cake was good too.  The customer service was great and I will be back."
Tara L.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,15,54,4.0,8/24/2014,"I like the cheesecake factory. I had got the fish tacos(4 soft shells) the shells were fragile hard to eat h with your hands without breaking. So I just used a fork. It was Shah kind of spicy which I liked. The fish tacos cane with rice and beans  but ,I substituted the rice and beans for sweet potato fries. I had got a strawberry lemonade. I didn't like it though tasted like there was soap in it or something. But I do like the raspberry one that one if pretty good"
Sandy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",258,32,32,5.0,8/14/2014,"The manager was really nice and let us in even though it was 5 minutes till closing. my date was not the nicest that night and the manager still gave us great service. I really enjoyed the stores Cheesecake,  milk, and mojito!"
Char L.,"Vacaville, CA",270,25,10,4.0,10/13/2015,I've been here several times but never noticed the playground. The $5.00 Happy Hour was perfect. The Ahi Tartare was so good I was excited when I saw it on the menu.  Crab artichoke warm dip was really good.
Diana T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",407,328,1450,3.0,6/9/2014,The only thing about this place that is horrible is the wait time. I've never been here without having to wait a minimum of 45 min to 1 hr. Granted we always come in a group of 5 or more. The best thing to do is to grab a table at the bar area. The outdoor seating is nice but not always worth the wait. Of course my plan is to always get a skinnylicious salad in order to make sure you have an 800 calorie slice of 30th anniversary cheesecake. Why else would you visit right? :)
