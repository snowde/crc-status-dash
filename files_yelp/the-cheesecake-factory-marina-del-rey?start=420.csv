Sarah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,657,656,4.0,8/5/2011,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. The food is delicious, and they sure have a variety. It can get pretty busy, but I m yself have never had to wait that long. I love that they have patio seating overlooking the water. The heat lamps ensure you stay warm even on a chilly night.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Once you order, food comes fairly quickly. The appetizers are amazing. They have a sashimi platter that's really good.. and of course the avocado eggrolls and artichoke dip are BOMBLICIOUS..  I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I do love their hot chocolate and cheesecake. My favorite is the pumpkin cheesecake (seasonal, I believe) and the strawberry cheesecake.. YUM!  They also have a nice bar and delicious mixed drinks. Kinda pricy I guess but worth it sometimes for a nice date or outing with friends :)"
Andrew M.,"Ocala, FL",2,4,,4.0,8/12/2014,The service was slow as stated in previous reviews. It's worth the wait. We had the filet mignon and it was larger then we thought. The broccoli in garlic sauce was to die for. James Taylor played whistfully in the background. Cheesecake was great. Come on down!!
Jess C.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,530,17,4.0,3/23/2013,"I actually like this Cheesecake Factory because of the outdoor seating overlooking the water.  They have freaking CABANAS!!!  It's real foofy for a CF.  The menu outside is the ""Cafe Menu"" so options are more limited, which means they only serve 150 things instead of the 600 on the full menu.  You won't go hungry.  Sometimes I come here to get a quick drink near closing because it's quiet. Parking is the crap part.  It's valet and there is no street parking on Via Marina.  You can try for a meter closer to Washington or nearby street, but there's not much happening.   Also this place is confusing.  They have about 6 different ways to enter, and they make you do a runaround to get to the host stand.  Just ask where to go and they'll get you sorted."
Alex P.,"Tarzana, CA",9,113,137,5.0,1/15/2015,I love this Cheesecake Factory location. If you sit outside you have a very nice view of the bay. The food it's always perfect and the servers are very friendly.
Melanie G.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,6,,4.0,2/12/2015,"Living across the street from the Cheesecake Factory is pretty a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because it has anything you could ever feel like eating at a high quality and reasonable prices, plus they are open late, they have a bar, and they have curbside pickup. It's a curse because having an amazing variety of cheesecake that close to me is just not good for my health.  Objectively, this place is great other than that it is always busy, they don't take reservations and you have to valet park ( which kind of seems like a nightmare but I always walk, so to be fair I can't talk smack).  My favorite food items are the oreo cheescake, the chicken littles, and the crab dip, but everything is good."
Rommel A.,"Bakersfield, CA",240,135,513,5.0,6/9/2013,great service. You are defaulted to use VALET if you park at the place. I had a chicken Medeira and my friend had the mushroom burger. Food was perfect and delicious. No dessert as we were stuffed! Would definitely go back again!
Elizabeth S.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,24,1,1.0,5/12/2015,"We go here pretty regularly as its my moms favorite restaurant. I like it normally. However we just called to see if we could reserve a table for tonight as my mom and dad want to go there for their silver wedding anniversary. I'm aware that they don't usually take reservations, but when I started explaining that it was a special occasion they hung up on me!! So annoyed, we go to this place all the time and they couldn't even be bothered to listen to me for a minute."
Dennis H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",74,11,2,4.0,12/13/2014,"You and your friends/family can't decide where to go? Come here, they have everything for everybody. That's what I love. And everything is delicious.  Service was great by servers, but hosts may look annoyed. Their the first point of contact, they should be more welcoming and friendly. I would give them 3.5 stars, but they remind you when they bring the check that the tip is not included. Who says that? But the food is good, so I bumped it up."
Aria F.,"Royal Oak, MI",28,285,21,5.0,8/9/2013,"We came here to celebrate my grandmothers birthday. The wait was only 30 minutes in a Friday which was pretty good.  We had a wonderful waitress. Her name was Heavenee and she was extremely polite and professional. She really took care of us and was able to accommodate our special requests for food substitutions. She brought a cheesecake for my grandmother with candles and all.  Overall the Cheesecake Factory was a great experience as always, the food is tasty, the portions are huge and the price is fair. I recommend the Miso salmon, Asian pear martini and dulce de leche cheesecake to finish it off.  I definitely recommend this location because it has a lot of balcony and patio space which has a great view of the docks. It's a perfect spot for a date or just a night out with friends."
Steve O.,"Inglewood, CA",0,24,2,1.0,6/27/2015,Just called 2 minutes ago. Your guy answering the phone needs to be less rude. Maybe you should pay him more so he can care about his job or fire him whatever works i guess
Sharmen T.,"Inglewood, CA",22,15,,4.0,12/26/2014,"This is a great place to dine with a date, celebrate a birthday or enjoy the view while dinning alone.  I've done each numerous times here! It get's very busy here (as do all Cheesecake Factories), but it is worth the wait.    The food is good, the vibe is right and did I mention the killer view!"
Angela W.,"Long Beach, CA",138,33,17,4.0,6/30/2015,How can you go wrong with this place!! Definitely one of my favorite spots. The Shrimp Scampi is my favorite. The Firecracker Salmon Rolls & Crab Wontons are the best appetizers!  My #1 drink....Lemon Drop Martini! Great food & service...I'm always coming back!
Koala B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,1,3.0,2/4/2016,"Food and service was ok. But mandatory valet parking and we were never told they charge for it? An unpleasant surprise as we leave. They are not even double parking, we could've parked the car ourselves much more efficiently and not waited in the cold."
Jaffee L.,"Chicago, IL",0,2,2,1.0,8/20/2015,"Is there a way I can rated this -5 stars? Living in the Marina for the past few years I've been to the Cheesecake Factory more than a handful of times. It's always busy which is fine, we were willing to wait. We were quoted 30 mins, ending up waiting up waiting an hour and a half.  The hostess got In my friends face clapping and snapping when we asked were we were in line. We finally were seated...We were not even brought water to out table for 20 minutes after sitting. When a waiter finally came over we ordered apps, they never came and when we ordered our meal it took another 40 minutes to come.  I am patient and understanding. I have worked in customer service my whole adult life but the way that the manager approached us after we voiced our concerns was absurd. He didn't apologize or offer to comp any part of our meal. MY GIRLFRIENDS AND I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK. I hope this review serves as an example to the management what customer service looks like."
Judy B.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/4/2016,"will never go back - a party of 4   had a late lunch arriving at 1pm - we were seated quickly - orders taken  - an hour later no food - an hour and a half later - food came - please understand our orders were simple - a salad, burger etc. nothing that took an hour plus to make. My husband talked with the manager - who seem in another world - could have cared less - no apology  or  reason - just a bad day for the staff- needless to say be aware of long wait times and very poor service.- food was just ok nothing special - parking -$4,00"
Kristin M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,38,6,4.0,11/2/2015,"Food is good here at this location like always. Wait can be long and it's only Valet parking here.  Service is usually good here too.  The one thing I do not like about this location and heed warning to anyone to comes to the Cheesecake Factory is that this restaurant is super small and very cramped. Almost claustrophobic. I feel bad for the wait service staff because when you're taken to your seats you have to walk through the kitchen area where there the cooks and also the wait staff picking up their food to go drop it off at their tables. I don't know why they don't move locations. There aren't enough tables at this location either so it gets super busy, and crowded than I think the others and sometimes the waits can be overly long."
Mike H.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,70,,4.0,6/12/2015,"Excellent food as always, but the wait can be very long sometimes.   Edit: Someone asked what I got so here is an update: We started off with the fried mac and cheese. Then we also shared a nachos (friend got it as a meal but we had some) and I had the Louisiana chicken pasta."
Randy P.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/26/2015,"After the horrible service at Cheesecake Factory on Father's Day, I'm making a list of all the restaurants that I've visited since who ""served its guests properly""  The simple act of coming over to the table in a timely manner, taking my drink order, then bringing the drink (and bread) over to the table. So far the list is four consecutive restaurants easily passed the test. Daily Grill, The Firehouse, Jinky's, and Louise's. I don't care how good the food happens to be, if the service sucks, it's a bad experience. We pay a fortune to eat out these days, we expect top notch service."
Jessica H.,"Naugatuck, CT",20,20,12,5.0,11/22/2015,"We came here around 9:30pm last night and it was great.   We were sat at a small table in the corner, outside, with a gorgeous, nighttime view of the ocean.  Our food tasted delicious, and came out rather quickly.   Our server told us she'd bring us bread when it was done cooking- and she did.   She was attentive and funny and we very much enjoyed her.   I can't remember her name, but she was tall, blonde, and very nice :).  I don't live in this area, but I will definitely be back when I am visiting."
Kenneth J.,"Inglewood, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/1/2016,"I'm giving two stars strictly because the food is consistently good , however the service here is horrendous . I've been a Cheesecake Factory fan for almost 10 years so I hold them to high standard . I placed an order for pickup and my order was incorrect . I also specifically asked for wheat bread and only got white . I called back to let them know and was hung up on TWICE. After getting out and going to the counter I noticed the employees and manager were having conversation and never took notice to me until I had to waive for attention . They fixed my pasta and then I had to wait for them to bake a new loaf of wheat bread . This is the second time I've had issues like this , for the price of food , service should be satisfactory , however at this location it isn't !"
