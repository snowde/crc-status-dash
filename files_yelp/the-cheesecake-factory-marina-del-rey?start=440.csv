M R.,"Culver City, CA",11,140,50,1.0,3/29/2014,"Once a restaurant just concentrates on numbers and forgets the details it turns into a disgusting experience for guests that know better, unsanitary conditions, dirty silver ware , plates, glasses, bland unseasoned food and wait staff hosts and bussers that just have become complacent and don't care as the next idiot is waiting in line to fill the seat. Managers that instead of managing are cleaning tables! Use to be one our favorite spots as the location is  beautiful Oh well. Bread that we were served clearly tasted like servers over powering perfume ( that means the server that handles money and who knows what else actually cut the bread with her bear hands ). These things should be discussed at the next corporate meeting at Cheesecake Factory instead of coming up with another chapter in the book they call Menu that cannot be executed properly."
Mary N.,"San Diego, CA",150,8,,1.0,7/31/2015,The man working the takeout register was RUDE AF. You dont have any say whether I should get a receipt or not. He had really snide remarks. Totally killed my mood. Just overall bad customer service.
Erica W.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,"On vacation from Houston, TX and decided to hit up Cheesecake Factory. My son, wanted steak so we ordered the Hibachi Steak. Waitress was great, drinks and appetizers came out in a reasonable amount of time.  My daughter and I both had the Cajun Pasta, good, but a little more oil pooled at the bottom for our taste but I scooped it out.  We're on vacay so the patience meter is extended a little more than the norm. My son, who was the hungriest of us all had to wait on his dinner for about 10 minutes longer. His order was supposed to be everything minus mushrooms and  sub fries for mashed potatoes. What came out was hibachi jerky, VERY dry with sauce on the side laid on top of sprouts and mushrooms, no asparagus and the requested fries never came. Didn't see the waitress for about 7 minutes after the food came so I could let her know we were missing 60% of the order and that it wasn't prepared as requested. She finally brought the fries 15 minutes after the plate was given and my son had started eating on the beef jerky because he was HUNGRY after a full day at the beach.  She said she would  get the manager to come over when I asked for the vegetable that never came (did I mention I never requested a manager). When he finally showed up (to a table that was packing and leaving and I had to wave him over to us) his response was (insert sarcastic laughter) "" whoa looks like he ate it, couldn't have been that dry""! I hadn't even explained yet what happened. I started to tell him that we had been waiting so long he started to eat the ancient meat and the fries had just arrived but he interrupted me and asked my son what his favorite cake was. In true kid fashion he said chocolate so the manager was like ""ok I'll send chocolate cake"" AND WALKED AWAY! No apologies, and didn't even take into consideration that this kid is still hungry! WTF! I never asked for a refund and he didn't even offer to remake it! All I wanted was for my son to actually eat dinner! So, after paying the bill, I went to Subway to feed him because he was still hungry. Oh yeah, the manager never gave me his name otherwise I would use it here. I'll just call him the tall fair skin Jerk, which is fitting because my son was served $18 beef jerky with no sides. Thanks Marina Del Rey Cheesecake Factory for the impeccable service and consideration. Subway did the job and we actually got what we wanted for way cheaper. Oh and by the way, the chocolate cake sucked too."
Ben K.,"Palm Springs, CA",162,13,4,3.0,12/6/2015,Came here with a friend. Sat down quickly but service was slow took 20 min just to order drinks food was good though service was an issue
Andre C.,"Hawthorne, CA",3,12,49,5.0,10/9/2014,Extensive menu. Consistently good food and service. This location has a great view of the marina too. Lovely at night
Patrick F.,"Los Angeles, CA",482,278,20,3.0,5/7/2014,"It's got a great view. There's the review. Oh, and of course that famous 25 page menu. The food isn't great, far from it. Nor are the drinks, even though their sangria rings in at a hefty $12 a glass. But if you're in the Marina and want a view, it's probably the best bet to satisfy all parties in your group given the crazy menu. Me, I'd spend a few more bucks for Paiche, or grab something from Mendocino Farms and make a picnic out of it at the tucked away beach right next to this joint, but that's my preference."
Mario D.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,28,43,4.0,8/7/2015,My family and I (group of 10) came here to celebrate my sister's birthday and the food was very delicious. We all dug in when the appetizer bread was brought to our table and the actually entrees were excellent. Waitress was great when taking our orders but the only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars was the 2 hour wait after we were told it was only going to be an hour max. Great service and the view was spectacular. (Since we got outdoor seating)
Daniel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,2.0,7/19/2016,"Our waitress was horrible, I believe that I saw her twice throughout my entire meal, not to mention she also got mine, as well as my friends order wrong. I love going to Cheesecake Factory, but this one experience is making me want to stop going there. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the food is very good, but the service is TERRIBLE!"
Anne M.,"West Covina, CA",222,45,147,3.0,9/16/2015,pro: beautiful view cob: super slow service but again its saturday night
Duke G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",32,26,9,1.0,5/16/2015,I tried to go here for dinner but when I pulled into the lot I was informed that if I wanted to eat here I would have to pay for valet parking. UNACCEPTABLE!!!! Either you should advertise this fact or have alternative parking!!!
Melody S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,122,,5.0,6/1/2014,"We had a super brunch today, sitting outside and basking in the ambiance.   Our server, Mark L., made sure we had everything to keep us happy.  Our food was great.  Sometimes brunch is the most fun meal to share and we just had a grand time."
Steven L.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,16,,1.0,7/13/2016,"Normally we love this establishment, but we came to this particular one a couple of weeks ago and the service was terrible. The waiter was actually a nice guy, but his service was bad. Never brought drink refills, didn't split the check the way we asked, didn't bring out side dressing until asking multiple times. To top it off the chicken tenders tasted like rubber."
Barbara L.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,41,7,1.0,4/4/2015,Horrible experience ordering take out. Called in 25 minutes ahead and my food was still not ready. Plus paying for my food took forever!! Something funky with the register or a mix up in receipts? Who knows! The cashier did not apologize or explain anything to me. Just left me waiting there. Definitely seemed to stressed out to care. Food is not worth the wait for me.
Karl B.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,38,2,4.0,1/8/2016,"Just had really good food at Cheesecake Factory.  Their portions are very generous and if you have a table on the deck, it overlooks Mother's Beach.  Nice view, good food, the waiter was very good.  How could you go wrong?  Love the Thai chicken lettuce cups!  Really tasty."
Maytee M.,"México, D.F., Mexico",40,11,1,1.0,6/22/2016,Beyond upset with this place.... the service was horrible. The waitress was rude. We ended up having an additional person join our party and the waitress did not offer to take a drink or food order. I came here twice and both times I have been completely disappointed with the service.
Joe I.,"Signal Hill, CA",148,250,320,3.0,7/19/2015,I normally don't really care for Cheese factory but a good place to go if your out with friends and can't come up with a place to eat. This location is always packed weekend get even crazier. Overall deserts are great.
Melody B.,"Napa, CA",1,70,204,5.0,6/20/2014,Awesome service by Ronald S.! Friendly and I love the marina view! Best one so far I've experienced! I wish we had a view of some water element back up in North Bay...
Alex G.,"Venice, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/8/2016,They need to get rid of Grace who works at the hostess station and answers the phone. Rude and an attitude that's not warranted given that we're talking about the Cheesecake Factory.
Jane C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",47,4,,3.0,6/28/2015,"Overpriced, always crowded, typical chain restaurant. In LA you gave too many choices to come here, get treated rudely and pay too much for your meal."
Bridget B.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,38,,4.0,6/3/2016,"We really enjoy the food and service here.  The prices are reasonable too.  Would give 5 stars if they took reservations after 6 p.m. Also, the restaurant is too dark inside, the lighting needs to be a little brighter.  During our time there last night, I observed numerous patrons using the flashlights on their cellphones in order to read the menu."
