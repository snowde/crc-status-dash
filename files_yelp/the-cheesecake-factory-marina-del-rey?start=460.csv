sharyn l.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,,5.0,5/12/2015,"I want to thank Patrick for being the kindest, friendliest and most attentive waiter ever and making my birthday dinner great! From the moment we were seated he was extremely attentive, friendly and helpful, even making suggestions from the menu for us on what to order. Our food came right away and everything was perfect. He even made the extra effort to check on us throughout our meal even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  That's a big deal to me,  waiters just don't seem to do that anymore. Thanks for everything Patrick!"
Anthony V.,"Orlando, FL",234,51,1,3.0,6/16/2015,"The food was good but our order was incorrect and not properly prepared. The server was a nice guy but he did not bring out the food at the same time as everyone else's at the table and messed up several orders. As well as messing up the food, the drinks took 10 minutes to reach our table...and they were beers... Not recommended for someone who is a stickler on service for the food was pretty good and not expensive."
Elias S.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,13,,5.0,7/14/2015,First off let me start off by saying my waitress savannah  was so amazing so out going friendly and on point with EVERYTHING!!!! Was very impressed if my restaurant wasn't so far from here I would steal her away thank you great food great view .... Would definitely come here again and would for sure sit in the bar area where savannah section is .
Elaine V.,"Temecula, CA",14,51,105,4.0,5/3/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory but this one I haven't been able to come to until now! It's a Sunday which is automatically going to be busy which I knew considering I am a server as well. I waited 35 min to sit out side on their gorgeous patio, just got off work so I'm super tired. I sat down ordered my drink got up to use the restroom and come back someone is in my seat. The host was seating them after me saying that was my seat a little frustrating but good thing I have patience! I took matters in my own hand and found a manager, Amanda she did an amazing job taking care of the problem. She handled it in a very professional way and made it happen! I'm happy & still love Cheesecake Factory! ;)"
T. R.,"Marina del Rey, CA",21,11,2,4.0,5/8/2014,"Sure, it's a chain restaurant, but the waterfront location can't be beat!  There are so few options in LA to enjoy the coast, so being able to relax outside next to fire pits, steps from the sand and chill under palm trees while watching boats go by is a treat all by itself.   Now if they'd just get rid of the ads inside the menu..."
E B.,"Falun, Sweden",0,3,1,5.0,9/17/2013,"Amazing keeper. Didnt recognize the name. A dark eyed man about 35-40 age , short hair. Best ever! Amazing food, Will return soon"
Reggie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",122,17,23,5.0,5/4/2014,This place was great wait wasn't long at all and food hit the spot great place to come if your planning on going to the beach but it was really nice
Natalia R.,"Venice, CA",26,322,224,4.0,6/14/2012,"Arrived on a Sunday night and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Our server, Cory M., was fast and super nice. I got the chairbroiled steak with fries and it was delicious. For desert we split a slice of godiva chocolate cake and the raspberry cheesecake. Both were great, especially the raspberry cheesecake. The crust had cookies or chocolates inside. Divine! The only thing that didn't please me (or made any sense) was that the waiter included his 18% gratuity in the bill when there were only five of us. On the menu I read that they included the gratuity only for parties of 6 or more.  Valet parking was $4,50."
Arnie C.,"Santa Maria, CA",69,4,2,4.0,11/5/2015,"The valet parking situation was interesting, never been to a CKF that had that! Overall great service. The place was super busy but we were still able to be seated very quickly. Food was great as usual and our server, Cheyenne, was awesome! She made a recommendation on a peanut butter cheesecake that was her favorite and it did not dissapoint!"
Dylan D.,"Culver City, CA",0,7,2,1.0,1/13/2014,"Someone wrote a 6 dollar tip on my bill and I caught it on my way out. The manager made the correction right and all was well. I don't know who did it but it was definitely not me. The tip line had 6 on top of it when the manager showed me. Make sure you check your online bill after ever transaction here. Who ever thought they could get away with it means they are brave enough to try or have done it before. It's only at this location and I have no other troubles at the other CCF. Service was good and everyone was really nice. The manager was nice enough to give my money back. Sadly, that is the last time I am going here. I've only been to this location 3 times. And this is the first time someone try to get more money out of me. BEWARE SOMEONE WROTE A 6 DOLLAR TIP on my bill.  I am sad I have to go far away for my cheesecake."
Jose C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",20,4,8,4.0,7/1/2015,Nice place I love the view the waitress was very friendly I didn't knw wat to order and he helped alot....I love their red velvet cheesecake the food is alright
Lewis Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",296,189,4422,5.0,3/8/2012,"I have to first start off by saying this is the BEST CHEESECAKE FACTORY I've been to by far. From the delectable foods and ambrosial ambiance to the delightful decor  and surprisingly speedy service, this location cannot be rivaled.  The main purpose for going to this location was to catch it to have dinner before the sunset! Apparently that didn't quite work since I live in Southern LA area and it being LA traffic was a major factor.. I didn't quite make it on time and got there when the sun was already in! Either way I still go to enjoy the perfect weather and breeze this place offers. Upon arrival the inside looked quite small so the hostess offered the ""Beach Front"" which I had no idea what it was, thought the patio was where we were going to be seated, I was wrong, this place is actually closer to the water and from what I heard she said its ""NEW"". I was amazed how everything look well set up... you have fire pits, cabanas, lounge etc. It was just amazing how everything looked, you wouldn't think it was Cheesecake Factory... and that is why I say.. THIS IS THE BEST ONE I'VE BEEN TO! Another thing you have to keep in mind if you want to dine in the Beach Front.. they only offer the Top 100 dishes on their menu. Now on to the service!.. Service was GREAT and our waiters name was IAN. I asked what drinks he recommends and which will have a better acquiring taste! He was on top of things very polite and never once did he disappear after he took our order (which usually happens at most places.) I assume at times waiters know who looks like a ""BIG TIPPER"" so they tend to cater more to those people. But that was not the case here because I sure don't look like or dress the part of a BIG TIPPER, but in this case I did not mind putting down a 15% from a $133 bill. I never put that much down as a tip, but felt like he really deserved it! Now on to the food!.. Since I was outside and its only TOP 100 dishes, to me they all sound good. Dishes I got to try were: Fried Macaroni & Cheese Balls: (10/10) WOW!!.. ORGASMIC!!.. I shed a couple of tears after trying this. Soooo cheesy and the taste was just incredible. With the first bite I really didn't wanna share the rest, wanted all 4 of them for myself! Chicken Alfredo: (10/10) This is definitely on my TOP 3 Alfredo List!.. One good thing that gave it a plus and out-shined the others was the BIG chunks of chicken that come with this dish!.. enough said.. THIS PLATE IS A MUST!   Crispy Chicken Costoletta: (10/10) I'm a picky eater so when I saw asparagus I just glanced over on to the next item.. but here comes IAN to the rescue again and recommended this dish. So took his word and I was really amazed. It was 3 thin sliced breast and lightly breaded which makes it better (too breading makes certain items not worthy) and for the side dish was mashed potatoes!... and what makes these potatoes better than others?.. RED POTATOES & CHUNK BITES!!.. So it's not all that mushy (hope that's a word!) Reese's Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake Cheesecake: (10/10) GRAND FINALE was this... ORGASMIC!!!... TWICE!!.. It was just an amazing day with food and the scenery and to top it of with this dessert! MOST DEFINITELY I WILL BECOME A REGULAR HERE!!  =D"
Lindsey L.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,49,27,4.0,3/11/2015,Awesome view here! Did not know there was a location in Marina. Very crowded location. Waited about 40 minutes to get seated on the weekend. The wait for food tacked on another 25 minutes. Waiting for our waiter to bring the check added another 10 mins. This is definitely a tourist attraction so expect a long dinner. I don't necessarily come here for the food but more for their cheesecake. Love their banana cream and Godiva cheesecakes!!
Brittney F.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,22,2,5.0,9/6/2015,"Great view! Inside and out. Eric is phenomenal xx what a lovely server. Recommended the Thai wrap and a perfect choice for a light, refreshing and filling lunch. The blueberry mojito is outstanding! Thank you so much xx"
Victoria S.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,96,140,4.0,5/6/2014,"Can I give a 3.5-star-evaluation ? Their service is always something impressive just like my business professor who had a business relationship with Cheesecake Factory said, they always value their customer as most important thing. The food is good, I ordered a shrimp pasta. Although they forgot that I asked for linguini, that's fine. The thing I dislike about is just like my friend said ""all old people with coupon"", felt like I was at Texas, noisy kids and typical birthday place...they really need to improve their restroom though, only one sink to wash hands and the paper towel was all over the place. People said that you'll know how this place is after you saw the restroom. Exactly!! Well, service and food, thumb up! Environment, thumb down!"
Anna H.,"Ripon, CA",0,5,1,3.0,12/28/2015,I wish there was 2 1/2 stars. My Grandmother loves Salad. She saw her salad and it was wilted. Very Disappointed this restaurant is supposed to be nice.
Bethany P.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,56,58,3.0,7/7/2015,"Arriving into the Cheesecake Factory the valet seemed very eager to take our money before we even parked. My dad assured him we were going to park first then pay. BTW parking is like $5. We were seated in a booth area and our waitress came over. She seemed really stressed and seemed like she was having a terrible day. My mom has a food allergy to mushrooms and we ordered a pizza and 20 mins later the pizza arrives by a different waitress covered in mushrooms! Whether it was the waitress or one of the chefs who didn't get the order correct it wasn't a big issue we just asked the woman who gave us the pizza to please remake it. Our original waitress came back and this time she seemed like she had real attitude when my mother asked to please make sure they didn't just pick the mushrooms off and then bring it back out (sorry these things happen....). Instead of seeming sympathetic she sort of got aggressive and kept saying something like ""we all know"" already when my mom asked why the pizza had mushrooms on it. Then she condescendingly at the end of one of her remarks called my mother ""honey"" or ""hon"". And so it began.... Food: My parents ordered the Mediterranean Salmon which came with potatoes and artichokes and tomatoes. They said their food was very good. From what I saw it looked good and the portions were huge! I ordered the SKINNYLICIOUS® Fresh Vegetable Salad. I noticed it said pomegranate dressing which seemed new to me so I tried it. I love pomegranates and I know how they taste so when my salad came out it looked good and I had a couple bites but knew something was off. Every bite I took the dressing tasted like car motor oil. Of course I've never tasted car oil but it had that weird aroma too it. idk how to describe and when you would try to wash it down with some water it would burn. I'm usually not too picky but at this point we agreed it would be better to request for a new one since I was ready to puke. After a while the manager came out and was super nice! He is the reason why I am adding on another star. He apologized to my mom and gave us a complementary corn soup which was super delicious. He was very humble and attentive unlike the waitress who was agitated at that point. The new salad that they gave me was great and I got balsamic vinaigrette on the side I recommend that or at least taste test whatever the hell they put on the salad. Overall this salad tasted amazing and fresh the second time around! After some time the waitress came back and asked how the salad was and I told her it tasted way better. Of course at this point everyone in my family was tense and I just wanted to go home. Since it was my mom's birthday we ordered 3 cheesecakes. 2 raspberry lemon ones and one chocolate one. That experience went smoothly at least there was some moment of positivity with all the chaos. The cheesecake was great too! We didn't finish all our food so our waitress came back and was struggling bagging everything and later when we got home the corn soup was spilled all over the bag....Also good luck getting water in this place...I had to track down like 3 men to fill up the glasses of water. They were super chill though and service was fast on that.  I just want to thank the manager so much for stepping in and helping resolve the conflicts. I've worked in food before and understand the frustration with people, orders, and tension but man what a buzzkill to someone's birthday -_- Thank god we had a $75 gift card here because the food came out to about $100 not including tip and for the experience it was not worth it! I hope some of that tip makes it way to the manager he was awesome! I wish I knew his name."
Persila N.,"Irvine, CA",670,396,594,4.0,4/1/2014,"If it wasn't for the wait, this rating would be a 5.  This is by far my favorite Cheesecake Factory location.  The view over the Marina is spectacular.  They have outdoor seating on the patio overlooking the water, a lounge area with fire pits, and heat lamps sprinkled all over.  If you prefer to sit inside, they have a decently sized dining room there as well and also have a bar in case you want to grab a bite to eat or a drink before you start your dinner.  Most people choose to do valet parking here because parking can be difficult or a hassle to find in the area.  On a Friday or Saturday night for a party of 4, the wait time was around 40-45 mins around 7:30pm.  They do not take reservations but they try to accommodate large parties.  Although I have never really ate anything bad here, I would suggest going for the Factory Burrito Grande if you want a burrito (it is ridiculously large).  As for good appetizers, I like the Tex Mex Eggrolls or the Avocado eggrolls (these are well known).  Their BBQ chicken pizza is also good, as well as their Chicken salad sandwich, Navajo sandwich, Chicken Piccata, Chicken Bellagio, etc.  If you are trying to be healthy, then they have rolled out a new menu called ""Skinnylicious"" that has many tasty options that are under 600 calories each (some under 500).  I recommend the Skinnylicious Lemon Garlic shrimp (a decent portion that has a great flavor served with angel hair pasta) , as well as the Skinnylicious Salmon that comes with vegetables.  The menu can be quite overwhelming actually, but do not fret.  It is hard to choose something bad.  And if you haven't already, definitely try a slice of their cheesecake.  I might be a plain-jane, but I can't get enough of their Strawberry Cheesecake.  Delicious!"
Julie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,12,,5.0,9/29/2014,"This review is for their Buffalo Burger.  All I can say is A-W-E-S-O-M-E! The CF menu is always overwhelming to me because there are so many items to choose from.  But on my last visit, I chose correct!  So good. My husband and I enjoy the outdoor patio area.  Very nice on a bright sunny L.A. day. And, our server was magnificent."
Nina P.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,4,1,1.0,11/5/2015,We are locals. We ordered eggs Benedict and The English muffin was black and burned and the taste of the food was affected. We Took a bottle of champagne with us and pay the corkage fee of $10 when we called the waiter and he called the manager he apologized but did not offer anything not even to cover the champagne corkage. We are not going back way. Black English muffins on eggs Benedict and just an apology really?
