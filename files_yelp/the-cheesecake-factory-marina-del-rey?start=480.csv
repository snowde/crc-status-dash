Jose H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,2.0,5/19/2016,"First off this place was a train reck. The parking lot is your worst nightmare. On top if your lucky to get valet to take you, you have about 30 people PLUS waiting outside the restaurant which makes you feel it's much harder to breath in. The wait time was 40 minutes to an hour for a table! lol Luckily my girlfriend and I ordered over the phone as I was heading over there from Covina, California I was out on hold for literally 20 min before they took my order! I understand it's busy and I do not hold that against them but I would have at least liked to have been told I was gonna be on hold for more that 15 minutes. Long story short, the place is just to crowded and full of people that make it look like a dmv waiting in line. I wouldn't recommend this location only cause of all that chaos. Other than that the host and staff were nice and friendly even though I'm sure she was stressed out from all the people waiting."
Jeffrey D.,"Pasadena, CA",163,5,11,5.0,2/18/2014,This location Stays busy if the main restaurant is busy go to the bottom restaurant its still part of the Cheese Cake Factory it just has less item on the menu.
Marco D.,"Malibu, CA",480,345,193,3.0,10/14/2012,"Dined there with a group of 4.  The wait sucks ass, I don't know what it is about a food chain restaurant that makes people want to run to it. 45 minutes for a table was a bit much, thank god that our hostess was kind enough to honor our request for first available booth.  The service was phenomenal, our waiter was amazingly kind and helpful. Bad note on the bartender for not knowing how to make a Jack Rose but it's ok. Our booth was facing a window that overlooks the Marina which would be great but the moon wasn't out so it was a big dark nothing.  As far as the food goes, the menu is one giant encyclopedia of everything. I understand that as a chain they have to keep their options open to appeal to as many people as possible but come on, you don't put the chicken tacos next to the Fillet Mignon.  I had the Cobb salad and my group had New Orleans Shrimp (ok) and two Petites steaks (not good at all). My salad was good but not worth the 16 dollars. Then again you don't come here for the salad so up to you.  This place is safe but that is all, don't expect to be surprised or to walk out with a smile in your face. Bring the picky out of town guest here when you can't get reservations at your favorite French restaurant and you don't mind making them wait."
Ashley H.,"Castaic, CA",2,29,,1.0,2/25/2015,"This review is only based on the check in process. The people working at the front are so rude, you ask a question and get attitude back. We called for a reservation and was told first come first serve and hung up on us. We then checked in and were given a pager but no one gave us a time. When I went back to check in, we were told 1.5 hours and they seemed to want nothing to do with us. So many people have come out and we have been sitting here for 45 minutes so far. Will not be coming to this location ever again nor will we recommend this place to anyone. Parking is valet only which is 4.50 and that is your only choice for parking. I am 8 months pregnant and they didn't even offer me a chair to sit down on for the 1.5 hour wait, I had a seat outside where I was chilly."
Joebella B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,32,5,2.0,3/7/2015,Food was OK but the service was unacceptable! Our waiter sucked! If Ein is going to be your hostess make sure you sit next to a fair skinned person to get some service after he takes your order.. If not you will have to wave down someone and hope that they don't forget you too..
D J.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,1,1.0,1/26/2016,I love the Cheesecake Factory but NOT this location. I came into town for business but won't make an effort to come here again. I was seated rather quickly but where I was sitting there was gum underneath the table that got all over my slacks !!  my waiter took forever to bring out bread and a busser came out with my drink and my appetizer. The waiter saw that I had gum all over my pants and saw me trying to get it out and told me he was going to get his manager she took a while to get there and was so insincere about it telling me she will pay for the dry cleaning but I told her I was out of town and she just said sorry and walked away... the waiter came back and was a lot more sincere in his apology I ended up getting buffalo blasts which were extremely greasy I ended up eating two of them and asked for my check because I was so upset.
Elle V.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,50,11,4.0,3/23/2014,"They don't take reservations so come ready to wait. It's worth it though. The food, service and ambiance was all as I expected to experience at a Cheesecake Factory. It was enjoyable and I would go back the next time I'm craving cheesecake. ;)"
Victoria L.,"Los Angeles, CA",104,60,4,2.0,3/30/2015,"food is always great at this chain, however, this location has horrible bathroom standards for Females, only two stalls. This location capacity is 300, wouldn't your think to have at least 10 stalls, I mean the lines were wrapped around the entrance near the kitchen, totally tacky and embarrassing. I was on a date and he had to wait for me for over 20 mins, it's ashame and I will not come back to this location."
Mirranda S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/6/2016,"This review is based on their waiting system. We checked in at 5:30pm and they said it would be an hour wait. An hour and 10 minutes later, I checked in to see how much longer it would be, and they said they had assigned us a table and the people at that table hadn't finished yet and they couldn't tell us how much longer. An hour and 45 minutes later, we still hadn't been called, and the host gave us the same spiel, and said there was nothing they could do because they had assigned us a table. People who came after us were able to be seated before us because of this protocol. Ridiculous! We left, and I will never go back to this location."
Judith K.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,14,,1.0,2/11/2015,"I had lunch here today with 2 friends.  I could not believe how rundown this place appears.  We sat outside. The tables were so close together that we could hear all of the discussions taking place at the table next to us.  The food was common place, nothing exciting.  Plus we each had to pay $3.50 for parking.  The parking attendants were not able to locate our cars, we had to walk to our cars.  And just across the street you can park for free! It was a rip-off!  I guess the joke is on us!  We won't go back....."
Tammy L.,"Arcadia, CA",191,187,322,5.0,5/19/2014,"It's cheesecake factory how can you not love it? The honey and I came here for a Valentines day dinner. I got the usual Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp and my boyfriend got the Jambalaya shrimp; both were absolutely delicious! Our waitress was super friendly and very quick on refilling our drinks and bread :] Also, if you want an extra touch of romance ask for outside seating that overlooks the water front. Trust you won't regret it!"
Linda E.,"Culver City, CA",16,77,20,1.0,12/21/2015,"Beware!! For having such a great location, this is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have went to. I came here with my family a little over a week ago. We waited about 25 mins just for a server to come and get our drink order. After 25 mins the server came and said they were between shifts and he would come back to get our order.  We were a party of 7. We all order a dish and my bother-in-law got the chicken parmesan. HE GOT FOOD POISONING!!  After a few hours, he was throwing up non-stop. I called the the restaurant to let them know. After waiting a while on the phone to talk to the manager, she told me no one ever gets sick from their food and he probably has the stomach flu. I was surprised that the manager is also a doctor at Cheesecake. Impressive! She was rude and said she would follow-up with me. She NEVER did. I wanted to write this review before I contact corporate with my complaint."
Monica B.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,49,13,5.0,5/19/2014,"Came in the other day for a well needed friends reunion, we had excellent service and delicious food. I usually go to the one in Sherman oaks, but this one is by far my favorite location because of the waterfront deck and beach like cabanas.. If you're on a date or family outing this is the place to stop in for dinner. Try the banana cheesecake it's the best!"
Yasy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",297,192,171,5.0,1/4/2015,"I don't think there's any restaurant that is more consistent with quality, taste and service. Cheesecake Factory is always my go to place and I love this location because of the view of the marina. The bread in the beginning with ranch and balsamic vinaigrette dips are my favorite! And I can't even explain how happy I am that they now have a low calorie menu with so many options. Delicious!"
Allison D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,7,2,4.0,8/18/2015,"The salad that I got was surprisingly really good. The pizza was a bit salty but it was still good. The service was not really good though. We spent more time waiting to get out food/the bill and the dessert than we did while eating. The waitress completely forgot about us. I would love to go back because the food was good, but based on the service I got, It sort of put me off from returning to the restaurant. I would perhaps go to a different Cheesecake Factory."
Dan C.,"Charlestown, IN",14,10,6,5.0,7/20/2015,Excellent all around! Great host and wait staff. Very busy location but food came pretty quickly. All of it was delicious and way more than we could eat. Tiramisu and chocolate tower truffle dessert was amazing. DEFINITELY get the avocado egg roll appetizer.
Markeyshia J.,"Paramount, CA",0,12,2,5.0,11/15/2013,Erin was a sweetheart. She gave great recommendations. The Jamaican Pepper Shrimp... YUM!!!! Now its cheesecake time :-)  Thanks again Heather for suggesting the patio. We've enjoyed the view
Cindy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,153,21,4.0,12/26/2013,"Came here for xmas ever dinner with my boyfriend and his son. our food was really good. i ordered garlic noodles with shrimp. very testy my stepson got sliders they were pretty yum,, and my boyfriend got Jamaican black pepper shrimp. all our food was good, only issue was we ordered an appetizer and it didn't come till after the food did    :(  cheesecakes we got to go they were awesome as always."
Brandie B.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,26,1,4.0,9/23/2015,A BIG shout-out to our server Mike Smith. Absolute perfection!! Thank you. Wish this ENTIRE establishment was more like you.
Sharr K.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",3730,612,6071,4.0,8/10/2011,Not really a Cheesecake fan....but the location here is excellent (especially if you sit outside on the patio). What you'll see is part of the ocean (Marina Mother's Beach) and watch the sunset.  I did enjoy myself the last time I came here. The white sangrias are amazing! They only valet here....I don't think you can park yourself.
