Asdik U.,"Glendale, CA",5,4,,1.0,7/18/2016,"YES, I was having a great day before I walked into the Cheesecake Factory!!!! On Sunday July 17, 2016, my girlfriend , her mother and I went to the Cheesecke Factory. We were there at 7:15. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait for seating, however, we didn`t sit till an hour later. We were understanding because it was a Sunday night and that is one of their busiest days. My girlfriends mother uses a walker and when we were escorted to our CORNER, we asked if we could sit 2 spots away from us where the seats were available to acomodate the 3 of us. ( Please be aware that she has a fold away walker and not a wheelchair.) The person said no, we need to sit at the corner. At this point, the 3 of us felt we were discriminated especially because nobody sat at the other table for another 10 minutes later. So it was available. Yes, the table was clean and ready for customers to sit, we checked. After sitting at the table which was really cramped up, we felt very uncomfortable. Example, there were unopened unbrella posts and round umbrella basses which were disallowing my girlfriend to sit comfortably. I asked for the manager, he pulled the table back a few inches. This really did not solve the issue. The right thing to do was to , even if we needed to wait a few moments, was to change tables. Manager did not do his job. After UNCOMFORTABLY sitting, we ordered food and instead of trying to make us feel better the manager brought out bread and 3 little packets of butter. THAT IS JUST GREAT, WE ALL GOT 1 EACH. SO GENEROUS!!!!!!  Anyhow, moving right along, I go to Cheesecake Factory in other locations and always get the eggplant parm and all waitresses and waiters till now ask me if I want cheese on it. My waiter did not and this was not an issue for me at all. The issue here is, instead of making things better it got worse. I asked him for the grated cheese and he said he`ll get it. I turned over to my girlfried and said to her ""I BET YOU HE`LL EITHER FORGET OR BRING IT WHEN I`M DONE WITH MY FOOD"". Guess what.... I WON THE BET!!!! When I was down to my 1/4 piece of eggplant out of the 5 or 6 pieces they give you, he showed up. I looked at him and i said ""TELL ME YOUR JOKING""!!!!!! Anyway, I will never go back again, ruined my night. By the way, he forgot my cheese....and I forgot his tip !!!!          .HORRIBLE SERVICE   Make sure Cory is not your waiter and Jonathan is good for nothing!!!!!!!!"
Maria T.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,88,10,3.0,11/10/2014,"PROS:  Great view of the marina (Marina Del Rey location) from outside patio dining.  Cheesecakes are the BEST!  On my bucket list is to try every cheesecake on the menu.  Staff are typically friendly.  CONS:  Mandatory valet parking (fee + tip).  Long waits especially weekends and evenings.  Overpriced meals.  BOTTOM LINE:  Been coming to Cheesecake Factories for years, but it has to be a yearning or craving for their cheesecakes.  Otherwise, like any other chain restaurant."
Christine R.,"Long Beach, CA",0,85,,4.0,9/12/2015,This is my favorite location! On the Marina. So romantic at sunset although it can be loud at times ;) be sure to get reservations on the railing ;)
Rick J.,"Surprise, AZ",0,3,,3.0,9/10/2015,Great food but unorganized serving meal missed my brothers mayo he had to wait to get it. I ordered stake to be added to my salad not very much stake. Missed giving us our cheese on our pasta. Price was right for four people. Great singing yes singing for my wife s birthday.
Irene V.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,26,8,5.0,10/25/2014,Decent wait time..excellent friendly service..and delicious food. Definitely will be back again!!!!!!
Alice M.,"Mar Vista, CA",584,404,1028,4.0,8/26/2011,"I used to think if you've been to one Cheesecake Factory, you've been to them all. Not so with the ""bistro"" side of this location! Luckily, we were tipped off by the hostess, who told us there was a much shorter wait, if any, at their adjoining bistro. The bistro looks nothing like a Cheesecake Factory. It looks like you rented a private cabana by the sea and happened to have a huge craving for cheesecake. We were seated in a cozy corner spot, right next to a fire pit and with a great view of yachts in the harbor. Awesome date spot for a summer evening! We were in the mood for a ""tapas""-style dinner, so we ordered a bunch of small plates to share: fried calamari, crabcake bites, crab & artichoke dip, and margherita flatbread pizza. The fried calamari were crispy but could definitely benefit from a nice marinara sauce instead of the cocktail sauce it came with. The crabcake bites were just as delicious as I remembered! (For whatever reason, I've always been fond of crabcakes at Cheesecake Factory.) The dip was a little greasy and salty... not my favorite. The margherita pizza was impressive. The basil was fresh and the flatbread was just the right balance of crispy and fluffy. Since we were at Cheesecake Factory and we inadvertently went on National Cheesecake Day no less, we had to get some cheesecake for dessert. Much to my dismay, they were out of Oreo, but the banana creme cheesecake was a wonderful substitute. MM went for the more classic strawberry topped cheesecake and I couldn't help but steal a bite. The service was great and the ambiance was unlike any chain restaurant I've ever dined at. For that, I'm definitely a fan!"
Ron B.,"San Gabriel, CA",1,86,53,1.0,11/2/2014,"Feel like sardines in a can, as this place has as many tables as can be set, and inadequate privacy and space between tables!  BAD Salmon, old, soft texture- sign of bad fish thus dated. Horrid! $20 for this- fish farmed salmon?  Poor Parking with Valet, charging $4.50- looking at these guys - I wonder if they have drivers licenses?  Dirty Restroom, inadequate size for number of customers. Urine over floor. Sinks filthy!! Inadequate waiting area, for people to wait for table. THUS people are bunched all together, and no room to safely (by law also) to enter and exit!!  THUS- ISLE space seems a night mare for health/ safety standards, as no room to move, or exit Is chaos, attempting to enter or exit, due to employees, customers, people hanging waiting, is a nightmare. Loud noisy disjointed near front entrance. What needs to be said? A lousy over priced chain restaurant, with so-so quality food, without much seasoning  flavor or freshness!  Maybe dinner does not include soup or salad, and this is a give away, as it is not a BISTRO! Basket of bread  & is really gluten laden, and poor quality bread! There is nothing relaxing, enjoyable, or attractive going to this over rated place. Food leaves much to be desired. Not 140 degrees when arrives at table as required! Per my digital therm tester. ALSO there are 65 1 star reviews for this location!  Least some people write honest reviews.  Now lets see if YELP posts this as 104 reviews not posted, by YELP censors."
Stevie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,63,5,4.0,5/13/2014,"I usually avoid chain restaurants but due to the unique location of this branch, I tend to go there once on a while. Patio sitting is highly recommended. Also it was a smart desicion on their side to lounch a carb conscious menu and serve lighter dishes."
James B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/26/2014,"The cheese cake factory is a classic. No matter what you order you'll have amazing meal. This location was extraordinary in their service. We are that wired couple that takes their one year old daughter out to eat with us. The server was so nice, he brought out a special dish of chopped up fruit for our daughter to snack on while we waited for our food. Great service! The atmosphere is really chill here, even though it was busy,it wasn't loud. The food came quickly after we ordered. I honestly have no complaints about this cheesecake factory, and I would recommend it to all of my friends and family."
Nathan M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,12,1,2.0,4/17/2016,"I'm not exactly sure why I am even giving this two stars, maybe from prior experiences?  Well... There was an hour wait, which I guess would be normal for a Sunday night but I have never waited more than about 20 minutes here, ever!  So it's my birthday and Mother in Law wanted to take me out, so I suggested the usual Cheesecake Factory as I do every year!  So after the horrendous wait, we get seated and told the ""specials"" from the server filling in for the normal server.  I order the salmon special and my husband and mom order their meals.  About ten minutes in and the lights dimmed so much we are all amused at the fact that we can barely see each other and the table next to us is passing around a cell phone with their flashlight on to read the menu.  I'm now told from the normal server that she is so sorry but they are out of salmon!  So I ask to see the menu again and quickly decide on a pasta from the heading because at this point I can't read what is under it due to the lighting.... I ask her what is a good past with a white sauce that I can take out the meat?  So I decide on Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic... And please hold the chicken. Totally put on pressure to pick something else quickly. Now I don't eat meat but I do eat fish, so I ask to hold the chicken.  I get my meal and start eating.  What am I chewing on cause I can't see my food? I put my flashlight on and it's covered in pancetta.  Apparently in small print there's pancetta.  I waive down the server and she apologizes that she did not think to ask if pancetta would be okay when I asked to hold the chicken.  (Assuming someone would be vegetarian when asking to hold meat).  So okay my fault, she takes it back to be remade without meat.  I get my new meal. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME! Covered in meat again! The server apologizes over and over and sends for another meal. By this time my husband and mom are finished eating and waiting on me.  We have now been there about two and a half hours.  I've picked at the bread and spinach dip enough that I'm now full.  So we ask for boxes and a check.  Come to find.... We were charged for my meal!  Seriously?  I'm so disappointed in my ""birthday"" experience that no one even feels like challenging the check.  But really... Your going to charge me for that!?! Well Happy Birthday to me I guess.  Can't get that day back!"
Cherry D.,"Los Angeles, CA",242,332,88,4.0,7/16/2013,"Good food, nice waitstaff but SHADY valet! I like this location because it's right on the water with plenty of outdoor seating and umbrellas!  The staff at this location is super nice and attentive and the food good.  I took away one star because of the shady parking attendant.  My friend paid for both of our parking .. I SAW her give him the money, said in front of me & the valet she was paying for my parking and after she left he said she hadn't paid him.  I reminded her that she gave him $20 and I saw him give her change but he insisted I pay him anyway.  I decided I didn't want to fight over about $4 dollars and just paid him but that's really shady!  I bet he cleans up at night when people aren't paying attention and have had a few drinks!  Don't trust the valet at this location since he'll cheat you to your face!"
Aurora N.,"Santa Monica, CA",37,9,1,5.0,3/13/2015,"This is like one of my favorite places to go have dinner with my husband, service it's great, food it's amazing. And service it's defenetly good. I would recommend this place to friends. One of my favorite waiter is mike, he's the greatest."
Katia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/13/2015,"I had a gift certificate to come eat here and I was putting it off because I just wasn't that excited to go... But I was so happily surprised! Food was really good. Service was top notch and sitting outside on the patio watching a sunset was such a great way to unwind. Since it's so good, it's pretty popular though so long wait and no reservations on weekends."
Clinton W.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",79,24,23,1.0,11/15/2014,"Had to pay $4.50 in parking just to find out it was a 40 minute wait. Thank you Cheesecake Factory, and thank you valet for telling me it was a short wait."
Char J.,"Long Beach, CA",6,67,2,3.0,3/19/2014,"If you only knew how much I crave Cheese Cake Factory, you would think I'd give it a 5 star rating but...not.   Once upon a time it was a pleasure to dine here but I just don't feel that way anymore.  Outside dining seating has been reduced to cafeteria style setups and you are literally sitting with strangers that cannot hold a intimate conversation unless you speak in alien code.  I can actually smell what's on the other guest plates and hear them chew and swallow.  (I don't know you like that)  I am so sick of valeting my car.  If I'm going pay for something, I'd rather it be park and ride not someone else to park my car where I am very well capable of parking my car.  Sometimes we go late and when dinner is done it should be time to go not time to wait again for my car.  It's really not as convenient as they may assume it to be.  The consideration that we take into account is, can we stand the wait.  Which is usually 25-60min. on average.  Do I really feel like dealing with the crowded reception booth that everyone stands around like they have the winning lotto.   The food is good and I absolutely come here solely for some outside dining and the Cajun Jambalaya which I find to be a grand cheat meal.  The flavors in it are awesome. I came here for my birthday once and the waiter just brought out this tiny sample cup of ice cream...that's it but another table got a birthday song and a slice of cheesecake.  : - O The wait staff are a crap shoot.  Some people are great at what they do and some just need  a job (I get it).  I tip accordingly so, when your service surprises me, I surprise you but when I'm asking myself questions like, ""did that just happen"", I'm checking off.  I have a problem with people that lack people skills, working in the service industry.  Even though I come here for the food and the ambiance there are some things that get in the way of that fulfilling experience of dining out. I gave two stars for the ambiance alone.  Some days its nice to spend a couple hours on the bike path and then head over to CCF afterward. The bar seating is a bit crowded but not overwhelming and the TVs are kind of high on the wall and there is no sound when watching the game.  Not ideal but if you find yourself there, it's doable if you don't want to miss a particular game.   Biggest Con:  That tiny ass bathroom that always need a tiding up.  Two stalls? TH Sometimes I just hold it.   The last few times we have ordered our food to go on our way there because they expect a tip if you order from your car and they bring it out.  Naaaay, I can walk in a pay, no problem.  They always forget your condiments even when you ask for them in advance like, bread no butter and sometimes utensil.  They'll double check your food order but it's up to you to make sure you have the extras you requested. Overall: I will still come here from time to time but 9-10 it will be for take out on a cheat day.  They are not the worst"
Catita B.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,50,4,5.0,7/1/2015,"I love this place!! We come here all the time and the food is amazing. We were there just a couple of weeks ago and had a slight problem, but I let management know and they not only took care of it they were so gracious and helpful. They even sent me a letter in the mail thanking me for my feedback. Wow! I loved it before, but now even more!!"
Lucy Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,1418,6065,4.0,5/6/2011,"Coming from Venice Boardwalk and making my way along the marina, this Cheesecake Factory location was the perfect stop along the way back home to WLA this afternoon! The super easy ($3.50) valet and immediate patio seating with a view of the marina and the beach was exactly what I was looking for to show off the weather and view of the area to an out-o-towner.  It totally felt like vacation to me sitting out there! Server Mark made me happy by letting me tweak the menu item I wanted: Guacamole & Chips ($9.95) - sans chips, with carrots and celery instead, made with no salt and no tomatoes.  Chunky, fresh, yummy, and just what I ordered! My friend took my advice about the awesome desserts and got: Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake ($7.75) - and of COURSE I tried it!  The crust was like brownie, and the AMAZING chocolatey cheesecake was TO DIE FOR.  Smothered with the fresh whipped cream that I love, this was really hard for this carb-avoider to resist.  Damn that was good! I'll remember to come back here even when I'm not with an out-o-towner.  It was just too lovely there to forget!"
Jay T.,"Irvine, CA",132,382,56,5.0,3/10/2012,"This was hands down the nicest Cheesecake Factory I've been to. I haven't made it to the original in Beverly Hills, but this one definitely tops the one at the Grove. Waterfront location, right on the Marina, especially if you go to the ""Beachfront"" section. The great view makes up for the lack of the full menu. I came here with my gf on a Fri night, so the place was pretty crowded. I don't know how long it would have taken to get seated inside, but the wait for the outdoor ""Beachfront"" was about 5 minutes. This area is pretty big, and it seemed a bit understaffed as the waiters were all quite harried, but that didn't result in a negative experience. They were all extremely courteous, down to filling the water glass as soon as it was empty (if not before). As far as I can tell, everything on the menu is pretty great. The items that cost more than $12 end up actually being cheaper because there's too much food and you can take half home for another meal. And you can always have as much complimentary bread as you want. Go for the wheat, it's great. The sourdough isn't bad, but it pales in comparison. The main downside of this location is the mandatory valet parking in the lot in front of the restaurant. Being the cheap suburbanite I am, I decided to just park on Washington (the meters are free after 6) and walk the couple of blocks over instead."
Stephen H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",23,26,2,3.0,5/1/2015,"The food here is always good but the service always sucks. Every time my girlfriend and I come here, we get stuck at a tiny 2 top table against the wall somewhere. They always forget our drinks but when we finally get our food, we almost always forget about the bad."
Eric F.,"Chino Hills, CA",105,90,19,4.0,12/16/2013,Alcohol - yes. Full bar.  Mediocre bet selection. Not much to write home about.  Food - not bad. Pretty consistent every time.  Probably like the pasta dishes best. Good sized apps.  This location is closest to my work.  Has a good view of the marina so +1 for that. Pretty much know what you are on for if you go to any cheesecake which is probably the goal.
