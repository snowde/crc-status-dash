blah b.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/30/2014,"$3.50 for parking, $4.50 on weekends! The stink of rotting seaweeds while dining. Tasteless, overpriced food with huge calories, and $11 for cocktails. Never again."
Jason H.,"Los Angeles, CA",245,211,11,1.0,7/25/2011,"Really Long wait. Rude Staff. Ive had better food on an Airplane Waited an hour and  45 minutes to be sat, about 20minutes to have someone take my order. 30 minutes for food to come out. it was cold. Got my drinks after my food. Everything was terrible. Complained to the Manager who did nothing, he didnt seem to care at all. He was more of a jerk than the waitress. Ill never come here again. Oh and did I mention... they dont take reservations? ???"
Stephanie K.,"Pasadena, CA",103,19,15,5.0,4/26/2015,Food is always good! But Moe the waiter who wasn't even our waiter is sooo amazing so thoughtful makes sure your happy no matter what I'll be back because of him!
Sharon G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,3,1.0,7/23/2013,SLOWEST SERVICE IN THE WORLD OR AT LEAST OUT WAITRESS WAS the people next to us finished their food before we even got our entrees It took them 45 min to get out my hot wings And the people next to us got seated 10 mins after we did  The time is ticking and I still don't have my food....
Cami C.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",8,22,7,1.0,8/31/2014,After 25minutes they took us to one table that was being used and the clients were just at the restroom.  You go back to the the front and you are not priority on their list and they give you another eta for more 10minutes. We left without eat and had to pay for parking. Although I love Cheesecake Factory I am not come back to this one!
Diamond R.,"Torrance, CA",5,43,20,5.0,7/9/2013,"Here today at our favorite place in the Marina.  Its super packed but we manage to get a table in the bar area, yaayyyyyyy. So our server for today is Greg: First impression of our waiter seems like a cool guy very chill.  We had to wait awhile to get our drinks since he was servicing a lot of tables but he did bring out the bread immediately.  When the drinks came there was something in the hubbie's drink that didnt belong and Greg had no problem getting that taken care of immediately.  Believe me I was watching him to see any indication of an attitude.  Anyway i ordered the chicken piccata and sub the rice for mashed potatoes w/ sauteed spinach on the side.  This dish deserves a 5 star rating, oh my.  The lemon sauce is delicious over the mashed potatoes.  The hubbie ordered the Grande Burrito w/ steak and chicken.  He gives this two thumbs up due to the portion size and taste.   FOOD: 5 STARS Overall service from our waiter: He started off with a 5 but then drop to a 4 because he didnt ask me how my food was or if I need anything.  Although, he asked my hubbie a question about his food just not me (sad face).   I used to be a waitress so following through and making sure everything is AWESOME is THE top priority.  Now that I own my own business, I make sure everyone gets the best of me at all times. We also ordered the Red Velvet and Banana Cheesecake.  Super delicious so another 5 STAR REVIEW. LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE."
Cynthia A.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",17,64,4,2.0,2/28/2015,Feels like this chain is losing its appeal. The service was horrible and they didn't seem to be very attentive. The place is very small and forget about the bathroom ugh disgusting both genders. The woman's restroom is tiny and dirty. How can a big restaurant like theirs that is super busy have such a small and dirty restaurant should be a health violation. The food isn't like it used to be seems like they put half the effort.
Billy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",126,85,10,5.0,9/24/2014,5 stars are purely for our sever - BRENDAN. nicest guy ever. Also lemon meringue cheesecake is Amazing. Beautiful setting and location. Only valet parking available or pay next door - no free parking.
Ja'me L.,"Inglewood, CA",69,99,1,3.0,10/22/2013,"This used to be my favorite Cheesecake Factory out of all of the locations until I started going to the grove which was closer to my old place. Anyways, the service is great and I am in love with the happy hour! If you want to come and eat at somewhere that has a nice appetizer and drink menu for a good price with your girls, this place is great. It's also good for dinner in general. Because the menu has so much variety, it's a great place for a first date because there is something for every taste bud."
Sara M.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/7/2016,I love this place... feels like perfect evening every time I get here for dinner :)
Michelle D.,"Torrance, CA",1,18,1,3.0,5/18/2015,the food here is so-so. It's a bit pricy and falls into the realm of mediocre tastes expected with most chain restaurants. I did receive excellent service though and one highlight is their home-made ranch dressing made daily. Best ranch I've ever had but my buffalo strips were just ok.
Glendy J.,"West Hollywood, CA",5,3,,5.0,5/18/2015,"We came here on Mother's Day and had such a lovely time thanks to our sweet waitress, Nicolette. She was so attentive and friendly. Couldn't have asked for a better waitress on that special day. Thanks Nicolette for making my first mothers day a great experience. That tiramisu cheesecake you recommended was delicious!  Definitely coming back here again!  :)"
Anna C.,"Glendale, CA",27,65,1,4.0,2/17/2014,"You come here for the amazing view during dinner... especially if you're sitting outside.  Its amazing been here a couple times. It's the cheesecake factory that you know & its pretty much the same everywhere.  Which I actually like, what makes this place special is the scenery & water. I had a good experience each time I've visited this cheesecake factory.  Of course I'm sure the company I was with had alot to do with the romantic atmosphere!  Service is great, the s'more cheesecake is like a heavenly explosion of chocolate and melted marshmellows in your mouth! Omg its amaballs!  And who doesn't love the bread here yum!  Will definitely return for another romantic date night with my ."
Christy Q.,"Chicago, IL",77,226,23,1.0,5/12/2011,"I've been to cheeseake factory a million times, both here at home in Chicago and travelling elsewhere. So when my co-workers and I found ourselves in California, looking for something quick and easy for dinner- something we could rely on being good- no surprises- we chose Cheesecake Factory. FAIL! The issue was service!  No one ordered anything strange. One girl got an individual pizza, one got chicken tacos, I got fish tacos and someone had a salad. Nothing too complex. When the food was ready, the server brought 2 plates out to our table and then walked away. Now, me (fish tacos) and my friend (chicken tacos) sat waiting for our food.  And we sat. And waited. And waited. And waited. And waited.  Now lucky for our server we were all chatting and gabbing and enjoying one another's company. However when a good 10 minutes had passed and still no food, we started to get a tad cranky.  Someone (a manager of some sort?) stopped by our table to inqure as to what we were waiting on. We told him an order of chicken tacos, and an order of fish tacos. He said he'd go get our food for us- even looked in the direction of the kitchen and told us our food was ready and he saw the server getting it now.  LIAR.  Another 5 mintues later the server brought our food. If you are keeping track, it's been 15 minutes since our friends got their entrees. They were pretty much finishing up their meals. The server apologized and he said he'd go grab the manager. The manager came by and apologized. That's it.  When we all ordered a slice of cheesecake for dessert and got the bill we were SHOCKED that they didn't do anything to make up for their error. There was no free slice of cheesecake, no measley $5 gift card for our troubles, not even a discount on the bill. Nothing. We still tipped the waiter well- it wasn't his fault. But the fact that they think that is acceptable is really telling.  I will never return to any cheesecake factory again. The place is so over- priced, especially for a crappy chain restaurant. And for such trashy service, any moron could figure out how to remedy the situation. Maybe that's why they work at Cheesecake factory. It probably didn't help their cause that the 4 of us are in sales and would never treat a customer that way."
Cheryce S.,"Lakewood, CA",130,11,4,2.0,11/23/2015,5 stars for the waiter he was great! I came and visit this location with my family for my little cousin birthday on 11/15/15. Of course it was slow to get a table but it worth for a 4 star restaurant . What I have a problem with there bugs on the table where forks and spoons are on. I have newborn what if the bugs crawl on him we tell the manager she said sorry that's it who doesn't want to do nothing. So I have to pay for food I don't even want to eat! I didn't get no offer to come back or I'm sorry food on us please come back. I spend too much money! I have been another location who the manager treat me great because they was hair in my food. I go home and throw food away have to clean my baby bag out we even got video the roach crawling nasty!!! I contact the company I hadn't even got a call that's bad taste in my mouth. I travel far to eat there when I could of went to new location in Cerritos !  Make sure your table is clean I would ask for new folks I hope I didn't eat any bugs eggs
Kiho H.,"Emeryville, CA",9,8,,5.0,5/2/2015,Awesome beachside view. Cozy and warm outside seats.  I love the Fried Calamari and Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo.
Colette N.,"El Segundo, CA",15,50,12,1.0,8/4/2014,We won't be back! We have been coming here for years and all our family functions! They stuck 5 of us at a table for 4. Really? We asked to be seated at a bigger table but No! Our ginger headed no personality waitress sucked! She was rude and mean!  We were shocked! Food was okay I guess! But we won't be back. CF you have gone down hill!!! Going to C&O's!
Emma T.,"Los Angeles, CA",442,222,1415,5.0,8/18/2014,"I love this location because it is at the beach one of my FAV PLACES any beach, there's something about the ocean that calms me. This is my FAV beach spot, not to mention I am Crazy for Cheesecake and no one I mean no one does Cheesecake like the Cheesecake Factory. Their menu is full of Delightful choices of tasty dishes. I wish there was one within walking distance to my house,  I take that back, I would weight 200 pounds, Lol I am and have been addicted to these places,  we go there to eat and also have attended many different types of events at different locations including this one There are so many good things to say about this place.  Valet parking,  friendly,  Happy staff offering some of the Best Customer Service in town. When I say that the customer service and the food is good you can believe me. Number one I am a caterer and have been since age 7  and I mystery shop to make sure that big businesses are spot on with customers.  I know how to look for problems and grade on cleaniness, friedliness, professionalism and products.  That is why I always say Excellent Customer Service is a must-have,  I like good food as well, however fresh food is a must and Cheesecake Factory has all of what it takes to be rated 5 STARS!!!!"
Elise B.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",333,49,,3.0,11/20/2015,Live in the area and frequent this restaurant . Usually get the Bbq chicken salad and dressing on the side . Last night had the ahi tartar for the first time . Got deathly sick worst stomach pains and couldn't move . Don't think it was fresh ! Will never get that again . Called the manager and didn't even offer to try and compensate . Disappointed !
Zachary P.,"Mooresville, NC",0,1,,1.0,12/22/2015,"Food was decent but horrendously overpriced. We were placed underneath an air vent blowing freezing air the entire time. The waiter came by the table only once outside of taking our order and giving us the check. I was not given a refill the entire two hours we spent waiting for our food. The restaurant forgot part if our order but since the waiter was absent for the entire duration of our meal, there was nobody to tell about this. When the check finally rolled around, we were able to tell the waiter that they forgot part of our meal. He tried to weasel out of it and say that he could bring it back out to us, but by that time we were all finished eating and had no desire to stay any longer in the frigid conditions that we were placed in. He refused to remove the part that he forgot from the check and had to call his manager, whom which offered a measly piece of cheesecake as compensation. When we got the piece of cheesecake it was visually tampered with (i.e. somebody licked it), but by this time we just decided to cut our losses and leave that place."
