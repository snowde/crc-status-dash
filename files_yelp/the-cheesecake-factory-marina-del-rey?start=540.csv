Tricia H.,"Detroit, MI",451,435,34,3.0,5/9/2013,Love the cheesecake - duh. But the portion sizes - really?   The food is good - but the guilt of ordering a plate bigger than your head is not appealing.   Especially when traveling and ya can't quite take the carry out with you.  What a waste.    This CF has a great view of the marina with a nice outdoor deck.
Jennifer K.,"Pasadena, CA",13,28,,3.0,4/20/2015,Long wait to get a table and service. Weekends are packed especially with out of towners. Not surprised. They have one of the nicest view of the Marina. That's about the most pleasant part of my experience eating here. Waited about 40 min for a table and 20 minutes to order food. Wow that's already an hour!  Food is so so. They definitely have some good cheesecake though. Banana cream is delicious! Only valet parking at this restaurant.
Itsme N.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,94,86,3.0,10/19/2013,"I used to live across the street from this wonderfully consistent chain and found it to be my go-to spot for when I needed a break from the monotony of consulting work. There is always a huge crowd in the lobby area.  People LOVE this place right?!!!  We were seated immediately but that was when it got fun. If you know this place then allow me to guide you to the inside dining area, where there is this two-top table pushed up against the wall and positioned about 12 inches from a real table, a 4-top.  This table setting seems like an after thought, as if the manager said lets up our sales and squeeze a table into this space.  We asked to be seated elsewhere, to not be made to feel like a step child that  is amongst the favorite children people.  We were seated at the other side of the inside dining area.  And there we sat.   And sat.  And sat.  And sat.  The servers walked by us.  Every single one of them.  And you know how many people walk by the homeless and don't make eye contact?  Don't acknowledge their presence?  Yep, that was us.   Then finally Brittaney/Elizabeth, I can't remember who, gently walked up to our table and whispered if we had been helped.  No.  And she did.  Yay!  We were enjoying our complimentary bread, again, yay and then the appetizer of Spinach Dip came out.  Cold.  It's okay if it's a cold app but when there's cheese involved, the app should be served warm, very warm.  But we endured because as a step child we didn't want to get too loud. Then, dum-dum-dum!  The manager walks up and politely asks if we could move because we were seated at a reserved table.  There was no reserved sign but whatever. We moved to the booth a few feet away and enjoyed our meal.  I had the Jambalaya and it was great but honestly I got full with the app and bread. As usual it's the CCF.  They're gonna serve the same stuff, the same way, every time.  And that's ok.  It's comfort food.  And besides, the company was quite wonderful, so what was there to complain about??? OH WELL, THERE'S ONE THING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.  The guy at the pick-up/dessert counter could've been a bit happier.  Come on dude, I just paid $24+ for three slices of cheesecake, ON TOP of a $30+ bill."
Rosa C.,"Wilmington, CA",0,3,4,5.0,5/28/2014,Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. The setting was perfect because it had an outdoor view even though we were inside. The service was great and the food exceeded my expectations. The price was worth it. I choose the red velvet cheesecake for desert and it was delicious. You do have to pay for valet parking but it was less than $5 so it was okay it just made the place seem elegant.
Jenny R.,"Culver City, CA",37,6,8,1.0,11/9/2015,"Horrible service to order items. The person in charge of the orders is rude, arrogant and does not have any sense of customer service! He thinks as if he owns the place.....and doesn't even show a smile ....i don't even know how they even have this guy working at such a popular restaurant....bad customer service and you have to pay valet parking or else or park by the liquor store hoping they don't tow your car....i don't ever want to return horrible experience. Its so sad because i love CCF but id rather go to the one in the grove rather then this impolite place!"
Sean C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,14,2,4.0,12/7/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is consistently the best restaurant I have ever patronized. The only reason I do not give this and other locations 5 stars is because of the fact that you have to pay to park on they're lots.
Dillon R.,"Fullerton, CA",83,9,5,5.0,11/19/2014,I feel terrible! Me and my girlfriend had a great waitress who fulfilled all our needs. I realized I miscounted and left less than a 50 cent tip when I thought I left 20%. I felt so bad to put are nice waitress through that. I even said keep the change when she took the forty something cents. God was I embarrassed. I realized the mistake walking out and rushed to give her a 30% tip because her service was great and I felt so dumb! If the sweet waitress reads this I apologize for the mistake again!
Layla I.,"Covina, CA",0,5,3,5.0,4/7/2014,Long wait but worth it I got steak Diana BOMB  great service loved waitrer                 Returning customer
Kate K.,"Houston, TX",27,150,90,1.0,12/2/2012,"Went here for a quick bite, got seated fairly quick but then sat for about half an hour watching every table around us get served.  No one stopped at the table even with water.  The lady who sat us even walked past a few times!  The table next to us got their check, left, and the table was cleared with another family seated there with water, bread, and appetizers in half the time we were sitting there.   Horrible service, it was very disappointing."
Debbie D.,"Goleta, CA",23,3,,1.0,11/8/2015,"Spoke to a less than accommodating, somewhat rude, hostess today. Unfortunately they don't take reservations as the site says and they will only take your name if you are there in person. Call ahead seating or the ability to make a reservation would be appreciated."
Dawn K.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,,2.0,5/11/2015,"I visited the one in Marina Del Rey a few weeks ago. The food was great but the ladies room was unkempt. I advised management who seem not to care because after an hour it still was not clean. Guess I won't be visiting this location again. So I posted this review on their Facebook page and received a message from ""The Cheesecake Factory"" requesting my contact information so they could ""follow up with me."" I submitted the information via their contact form and ""someone"" was going to be contacting me. To date, I have not heard anything. I believe that was done to ""save face"" on Facebook. I will not be visiting this or any other location anytime soon."
Quin S.,"Inglewood, CA",70,19,34,2.0,1/17/2015,Do not come on the weekends! The service sucks! The food is undercooked and beware of the first bite of your popcorn shrimp that was fried with a piece of the plastic bag it came in. Ugh! Management get it together por favor.
Glen M.,"El Segundo, CA",63,312,577,4.0,10/23/2013,"Always, always busy. Usually very large portions but you do pay a bit for it. Most locations have a great view as well. Food is consistently good but usually not great. Services is usually very good, sometimes great. Great for groups, eat in the bar area if going solo, a bit noisy for a romantic dinner. Enjoy!"
Ryan P.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",62,163,185,4.0,5/1/2013,I personally believe that it's impossible to have a bad meal at any Cheesecake Factory. So when you go to this location...SIT OUTSIDE!!!!! Nothing wrong with enjoying a lovely day/evening embracing the beauty of Marina Del Rey. It's picture perfect.
Jen D.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,5,,1.0,6/13/2015,Worse worse worse restaurant experience first of all my family n I spent about 15 mins watching the waiters go back and forth without anyone approaching us or our table to assist us! This place is horrible the manager had a huge shit face and was not welcoming at all! This place is too busy with no one that knows how to handle their  job last time going
Efren S.,"Inglewood, CA",69,7,,5.0,2/26/2016,the factory burrito burger is sooo big and delicious with steak instead of chicken
Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4468,2212,19024,5.0,9/6/2010,"The Marina del Rey Cheesecake Factory is by far my favorite location of this restaurant chain.  Just about everyone has enjoyed the Factory's high-calorie, high-taste cheesecakes and huge menu selection.  Most may not know this, but CF was the first true ""date"" (in Pasadena) my wife and I shared (she picked it because it seemed the best ""American"" place) so it has a little extra meaning for us.   The menu was recently updated. Today for lunch, we tried one new item and one tried-n-true dish.   The Farmhouse Burger is new. I guess it replaced the old Ranch House Burger (an old fave). The good news is that the Farmhouse one is $2 cheaper, very unique, and also very good.  It's an Angus Beef patty covered with Grilled Smoked Pork Belly, Cheddar Cheese, White Onions, Iceberg Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo, and a Fried Egg.  That's right: Grilled Pork Belly and a Fried Egg?!?!   The egg is a runny Sunny-side Up that oozes all over the burger once you begin to eat it.  Because of the egg, this burger won't be for everyone, but it sure was an amazing combination of flavors in one very messy burger.  The burger comes with fries, but for $1 extra we upgraded to the delicious Sweet Potato Fries.  My only recommendation for this burger would be to upgrade the lettuce as it seemed to add nothing.  Romaine or possibly spinach would be better.  But I digress.  For me, the Farmhouse Burger is another win for Cheesecake Factory.  Check out the picture uploaded with this review to see it. My wife went with her favorite CF dish:  Miso Salmon with Snow Peas and White Rice.  Even the lunch special at $7 off was almost too big to eat.  It's a classic sweet teriyaki-ish sauce on the grilled salmon that brings  back memories of happy summer days in Tokyo. For an appetizer, we tried something new (for us) that isn't quite new at all:  Stuffed Mushrooms.  They were tasty, however, seemed a little overcooked by about 30-45 seconds leaving a slightly charred taste on the tender mushrooms.  They are stuffed with Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic, and Herbs served with a Wine Sauce.  The mixture of cheese and wine sauce was loved by my wife who enjoyed dipping the sourdough bread in it. Service was great as the hostess seated us quickly and then moved us from our original seat to a better one on the upper outdoor balcony with a great view of Mother's Beach when we requested some shade under an umbrella. Our waiter was a bit slow at first because the place is seriously busy, but he warmed up to us as the meal progressed and even gave us two To-Go Cups of our drinks: Passion Fruit Iced Tea and an Arnold Palmer. The Arnold Palmer is served in a regular tea glass rimmed with sugar (like Margarita salt, but sweet). It is a nice (and very sweet) touch. Valet parking is always $5, so we took the Water Bus over from Fisherman's Village for $1 each way and enjoyed the ride through the Marina. If you want to avoid valet, there is a lot nearby that offers self-pay spots. In addition to the previously mentioned food, my recommendations for any Cheesecake Factory remain the same:  Buffalo Blasts, Avocado Eggrolls, BLT Salad, Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, and the Grilled Chicken and Avocado Club. Finally, we got a slice of cheesecake to go.  It was a dilemma choosing between the 1200-calorie Red Velvet or the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream. We went the Tuxedo route with layers of Fudge Cake, Chocolate Cheesecake, Vanilla Mousse, and Chocolate. Of course, it was delicious. With its nice view, full bar, great selection of tasty specialties, and stellar service, the Cheesecake Factory of Marina del Rey stands out as an excellent dining option if you can afford the wait."
Ray Z.,"Marina del Rey, CA",5,32,,4.0,1/6/2016,Service has almost always been exceptional. The food is generally solid. I do however feel that the wait can be a little long when they're busy but that says something about the business. I am a repeat customer and I would recommend the Marina Del Rey location to any Cheesecake Factory lover.
David B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/6/2014,The service was slow The fries were lukewarm  The service was slow The food was not worth going back for The service was slow Not what I have appreciated about CF in past I guess I won't rush back Oh did I say the service was slow!
Sameh A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,21,13,5.0,2/24/2015,"One of my favorite restaurant ever. I just love to go there use their patio to watch the sunset while eating the most delicious food ever. I love that place and I always go there for any of my special events. Great service, servers, and managers. Can't wait to go back"
