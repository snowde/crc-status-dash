Kathy Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",719,123,662,3.0,6/25/2014,"Had to heckle for bread a couple times, same great taste as other locations, 10-minute wait time on a Saturday evening, not much else to explore in case of a longer wait, cool view, friendly servers, not really a fan of Valet parking in areas where it's highly unnecessary... That would sum up my experience. Let's just say, I think I'd rather take the extra ten minutes to drive to the Beverly location."
Arya S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",360,116,10,5.0,11/20/2012,"Not a fan of chain restaurant, but when I feel guilty, I look no further. Forget about Houston's and all other places--CF is good to everyone, despite their atrocious decor.  5-star, impeccable service was well-executed by our server, Michael! Very attentive and crystal-clear!  Again, I don't do chain restaurants, but when necessary, I only go here."
Chris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,131,6,4.0,10/4/2013,"probably the best cheesecake location in LA. I pretty much come here for the night view of the harbor. It can be very romantic when you sit at the patio.  I always order Louisiana chicken pasta, hibachi steak, or Chicken Bellagio. And thai lettuce wrap. They are very delicious and all the other dishes are well above average. I came to this location more than 10 times and planning to come again soon!"
Rebekah T.,"Los Angeles, CA",286,181,14,4.0,4/1/2013,"I'm a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory overall.  The view from this location is fantastic and the food is always dependable.  However, the mandatory (and not FREE) valet parking and rude employees need to go.   I've been to this location a number of times and almost every single time the hostess staff are extremely snobby and put off.  The waiters at least mask being happy but seriously, with so many people out of work you would think they could be a bit choosier about the personalities of who they hire. This location gets 5 stars for food and location but 1 star for service."
Sara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,1,1.0,10/13/2012,"Horrible. I've been to this cheesecake factory many times before and always sit in the downstairs patio area. I've never had a problem until tonight. It's a Saturday night and my family and I invited some of our friends to come here for dinner. We were greeted by the hostess and given a table for 6. Great. Loved the seats. She says ""give us a few moments to clean the table."" Fine. ONE minute later we return to go to our seats and lo' and behold, the seats are rearranged. Umm...we ask her what happened, she apologizes and attempts to change it back. Great. Then the ""manager"" named Steven comes and stops her saying these tables can't be rearranged. WHAT??? We were just given the table a minute ago, what do you mean it can't be rearranged?! Of course, Mr. Manager gets frustrated and starts giving us a harder time. Our guests arrive to a scene where we are arguing with Steven. Because we didn't want to cause a bigger scene in front of our guests, we say fine give us another table. He says sure, the folks over then are almost done and I will seat you there. Great. ONE HOUR passes. Nothing. No seats. No food. No drinks. I go up to the manager while our guests were talking. (I rarely get mad) I reached my boiling point with him. He finally seats us. Seats sucked as much as the first ones. Ugh. At this point, we are starving. Screw the messed up seats. The waitress comes. An HOUR later our food arrives. Then they bring hot cups to pour the beers into. Umm beer cups hot?!?! Waitress ""oh sorry they just came out of the wash."" Wonderful. Worst dinner experience of my life."
Ashley Ta'Nique ..,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,36,10,5.0,10/8/2013,This is probably one of my favorite cheesecake factory locations. Every time I visit I sit outside on the terrace...BEAUTIFUL! Good food and drinks with great company is always a good combo! Food and service is always on point!
Nana A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",155,188,251,3.0,9/16/2014,"This cheese cake factory is in a great location in Marina Del Rey.  Beautiful views and very scenic.  The only down fall is there is no public or street parking, so you must valet and it is so busy there is always a very very long wait."
Elizabeth R.,"Bakersfield, CA",68,59,61,3.0,3/24/2013,"Never thought I'd give The Cheesecake Factory a less than 5 star review, but here we are. When my sister and I were leaving Venice Beach with my niece and little brother in tow, we decided to stop by Cheese Factory because we don't have one near us, so we figured, ""Eh, it's on our way home, why not?"" When we got there, we were super hungry, tired from walking around, and looking forward to just sitting, relaxing and having super good food. When we got there, it was valet parking. I've never experienced valet parking at all-let alone at a Cheesecake Factory, although I'm aware it's fancy enough to merit one. Whatever, we're hungry, it's only $5, we pay it.  We get inside, the person taking names and handing out those little buzzers that go off to let you know you can get seated isn't very attentive. In fact, it looks like she doesn't want to be there. She's more concerned with primping. There's another girl standing right next to her who is kind enough to ask us how many in our party, and that triggers the other girl behind the computer to ask my name, tells me it will be a 30 minute wait, and hand me a buzzer. Why they need two girls up front to split that task is beyond me, but at least one of them was pleasant. We finally get seated and our server is so nice! She's on task about giving us refills, asking us if we need anything else, etc. So that was one good part about our meal. I ordered the chicken marsala, and my sister ordered the lemon herb chicken to share with my niece. My little brother ordered the kid's pizza. I've had the chicken marsala at at the Irvine location, and I very much preferred Irvine's. It was juicier, more flavorful and the pasta was al dente. The pasta at the Marina Del Rey locaiton was bowtie, and pretty darn undercooked. Not even al dente. More like, it was 2 minutes away from being al dente.  Unfortunately did not have any cheesecake with our meal because we didn't have any room (the portions are HUGE) and we didn't want to trek back in the car with perishables. It's a shame, their red velvet is amazing and now I'm craving a slice!"
Tina M.,"Los Angeles, CA",150,173,111,4.0,11/21/2012,"Very nice. We went last night (tue) to get some cheesecakes to celebrate my birthday.  It was very quiet and not crowded but it was a tue at 10pm so I am not surprised.  The choices were endless as always, however I chose the Pumpkin/Pecan cheesecake because it's seasonal from Oct-Nov.  I loved it.  I would encourage anyone who has a sweet tooth like me to try it.  It has all the best, pumpkin, yes, cheesecake yes, and butter pecan!  OMG  the best so far (in my opinion). I am happy to be able to give a review on the actual dessert this time."
Margot S.,"Northeast Washington, Washington, DC",212,26,2,5.0,1/29/2015,"Super friendly, quick staff! I live right near by and whenever I go, just me, I can be in and out in 30 min, regardless of how busy (assuming you're willing to eat at the bar). Definitely recommend."
La R.,"Marina del Rey, CA",7,10,8,4.0,11/16/2014,"It's Cheesecake Factory not STK, so you have to know the difference before you come here! But for what Cheesecake Factory is and stands for, it was a very pleasant experience! Our waiter tonight was Steve, awesome guy! Made our dinner very pleasant and fun. His recommendations were on point and his attitude was extremely welcoming and sweet. Thank you"
erin w.,"Chicago, IL",6,9,2,1.0,6/26/2016,"Last night was probably the most horrific experience that I have ever had at this restaurant. After getting done enjoying my dinner and getting ready to leave I was in a panic when I discovered that my purse was missing. I literally placed it hanging on my chair while sitting there enjoying my dinner. I did not leave the table once and yet my purse was still snachted from me. The only people walking by our table was the staff members. Our server was as helpful as she could be. I was extremely upset that this could happen. Fortunately, I was able to use the track my iPhone app on my boyfriends phone. Which showed that it was in the restaurant.  I was walking around the restaurant for about an hour and half. When I stated to one of the managers that it was located in the restaurant he was very uninterested.  I also asked if there was a higher manager then him which he informed there wasn't. That wasn't the truth at all I found out shortly later. I requested the manager to call the local police authority which he did not. This mangager was refusing to be helpful in this whole situation.  Then the general manager Steven came over to talk to us he was more then helpful. He actually walked around for about 30 mins with us trying to track my phone that was located in my missing purse. And what do you know all of sudden it was turned in. I couldn't believe it. I was happy when my server found it and brought it back to me. But after all that someone finally turned it in. But of course all the cash that was in my purse was gone. I had about $60-70 cash in it. I can't help but think an employee finally decided to turn it after they took the cash out. I really think one of the employees at the restaurant actually stole my purse and took the cash. They must have gotten nervous when I asked for the police to be contacted. I can't believe after such an awful experience that my dinner was not refunded. I am completely appalled by this whole situation. I can no longer continue to be a paying patron here. I feel completely taken advantage of after being ripped off by an employee. The whole situation was just a shady experience. I was a regular customer that would attend here at least twice a month. I will no longer continue to do business with the restaurant. I have never felt more taken advantage of. I would have liked to watch the security camera myself. Ladies I recommend that if you go here hold on to your purses  the staff members have some sticky fingers."
Chase C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,4,4.0,3/6/2015,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory in Los Angeles. The staff are usally friendly, and the happy hour is always nice. The Valet attendants always try to pressure you into valet parking (Valet and self parking is the same price). But I usually self park, so I don't have to tip. Service is always nice. Only once have I been there, and the service and food was bad."
Clayton C.,"Dallas, TX",21,158,17,3.0,7/29/2014,"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't like The Cheesecake Factory, and we only went because we had a $50 gift card and two gift cards for a free slice of cheesecake each.  It turned out at the end of the night that we only had $17 left on the gift card, and the free cheesecakes expired in 2012.  Oops. The food is good.  It's not splendid, and I can't imagine it's healthy, but it's good.  The bread is delicious.  The service was good.  I just felt terrible at the end of the night that I was spending $80 (plus tip) on fairly plain food, and then walked outside to pay $4.50 (plus tip) in a mandatory valet lot. We ordered a lot of food (thinking at the time that we had a lot of free money to spend. Oops.).  Here's what we had: - Ahi tuna tartare (pretty good, but pretty small for $6.95) - Chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps (nothing special, and as with all lettuce wrap dishes ever, too much lettuce, not enough filling) - Steak salad (probably has a better name, but that's what it is - should have guessed that it would be swimming in dressing) - Lemon garlic shrimp (the shrimp were big, but the best thing my wife can say is ""there was nothing wrong with it"", which means that she can make it better) - Farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic (the best dish of the night - quite tasty, but still probably fairly unhealthy) - Kahlua cheesecake (I've never seen it offered anywhere else, so it's definitely unique, but I'd love to have more flavor) - White chocolate raspberry cheesecake (they didn't have the chocolate raspberry, which was literally the only thing we were looking forward to - this one is an ok back-up, but just ok) So yeah, it's a lot of food.  Don't worry, we didn't eat it all in one sitting.  But in my mind, despite the good service, and the ok food, it's way too expensive for just ok food, especially in the food mecca that is Los Angeles.  And please, please, if valet is mandatory, don't make it $4.50. If you want better food, nicer ambiance, free parking, and to still have marina views, I'd suggest Sapori on the other side of the marina."
Princess P.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,273,176,4.0,7/28/2013,"I love this place.  This location is better than the Grove!! Valet parking is $3.50 for lunch. Even though it is ALWAYS busy the wait wasn't long and I love that they have the new Skinnylicious menu with healthier/less fattening options! Even with the Skinnylicious menu, you can never go wrong with choosing the Kahlua cheesecake, omg!!"
Tiffany M.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",23,9,3,5.0,7/18/2014,"Myron who takes the call-in orders is precise and quick! Several times ordering to-go at this location and each time my order has been wrong, so I'm thankful that they have someone like Myron who has now taken over the reins! Nothing worse than getting home and seeing that your order is  completely wrong so now with Myron I have had no worries :))"
Olivia S.,"Portland, OR",222,142,240,4.0,8/2/2010,"I'm a fan.  The menu is so big.  The dishes are big.  The cheesecake is making me big and I still love it. If you come to this Cheesecake Factory, you must sit outside by Mother's Beach.  I took my mom who doesn't really like most American restaurants here and even she liked it.   It is easy to find something delicious on the menu every time.  I like the beef ribs, a spicy cajun dish, and steak.  I didn't like the avocado wonton appetizer. Parking is $5 and the wait is too long.  If I didn't have to wait then I would give them 5 stars."
Tarek A.,"Fountain Valley, CA",119,8,5,4.0,7/4/2014,"Went here for the Fourth of July..wait was long but service was great, especially our server Eman. Nice view of fireworks too!"
E V.,"New York, NY",0,14,35,5.0,2/28/2015,Great food!  Great view! Our waiter Iman was the sweetest!  Thanks for the amazing service.
André N.,"Stockholm, Sweden",2,30,,5.0,10/15/2013,"WOW! awesome food and really good waiter! You get big portions and free refills on the soft drinks. Really good and definitely worth a visit!  We went there on a friday night without booking anything so we had to wait for 25min, although after 15 our table was ready"
