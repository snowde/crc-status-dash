Karina N.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,39,19,2.0,11/25/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory but recently this location has sucked on service. Came for my birthday and the waitress was just too busy for me and testy. Visited another location in San Diego 3 weeks ago and that location was excellent all around. I'm ok with not coming here again.
Chris K.,"Rio Rancho, NM",29,31,10,1.0,4/10/2014,Came here to spend some gift cards and ended up paying for SELF parking as if me paying for food was not enough love the food but go to another location.
Ashton K.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,43,5,1.0,9/24/2012,"Worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. Management is a disgrace. The manager DOES NOT know how to take care of his customers when he knows they are in the wrong. Instead he tells his customers they are crazy for being upset. The hostess after quoted my party 30 mins I went up to tell her it had been an hour and she said ""No it's only been 50 mins"".  I don't recommend eating here."
Carolyn R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,35,,4.0,2/21/2013,"I love this place. I came here on sunday to celebrate a birthday. Sadly I forgot to make a reservation, and I was told my party of 6 would have an hour wait, well it turned out to only be about a 20 min wait, which wasn't bad. Another party took our table and we were quickly given another one.  Why the 4 stars? our waitress, showed some attitude when we told her we would like to get seperate checks, and got upset when she got our checks wrong, Also they forgot to return one of my party's change back, and to make it all worse they didn't even sing ""Happy Birthday"" to the party girl! we loved our food, just the service was horrid. I'll give this place another chance, maybe our waitress was having a bad day, I understand it happens. I just hope it doesn't happen again. :)"
John T.,"Torrance, CA",105,118,83,3.0,11/20/2013,"Ehh. Pros: Food was good, waiters are nice. Cons: WAIT TIME.. waited 1 hour! and valet parking is a must. I would still go here, but I don't think I would enjoy it. Nor would my wallet."
Kasson H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,,1.0,1/31/2016,"Wow I cannot start without saying this place is gone down hill, I ordered a cheeseburger and the waiter asked me when I was done if I wanted to pay for more drinks than I had purchased I was alone ???? So then he figured that out and tried to give me a discount on a drink I never ordered still confused about the fact that I was alone so wow the service is crazy and good luck getting out if there without paying for 2 peoples drinks"
Miko L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/13/2015,"Horrible service! Figured out that I had to pay $4.50 for parking when it wasn't even vallet, had to park it myself then they came up to me asking for money. Stood inside the restaurant for 10min no waiters paid us any attention to be seated. Our waiter came back twice saying he'll be back. Served our bread with no water. Didn't get to order after 20 min. Appetizer came with the meal which cancels out the part for it to be an APPETIZER. Came at 11:10pm didn't get to leave until 1am."
Brittany L.,"Marina del Rey, CA",51,234,20,1.0,4/22/2014,"Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever!! Stay away from this location- horrible service, bugs in the food, rude staff, just to name a few."
Carlos F.,"Inglewood, CA",3,12,5,5.0,12/12/2014,"I love this place and will definitely recommended to all my friend  they have the best pastas, and the mojitos are the best   the atmosphere is really good last time I sat at the patio and it was the best but ether inside or outside is the same good service.    The menu is smaller if you sit outside .."
Sophia H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,4,1.0,4/26/2014,"Booooo to this place!I went to enjoy dinner and didn't even get in. The Valet was so rude I could believe it. I didn't bring cash, which I know I should always have cash for valet in LA, but I didn't. So I asked him where I could park because I didn't have cash. He said and I quote, ""not here"" I told him I understood it was valet and asked where I could get cash, and he said he didn't know but I couldn't Parkin the lot without cash.  I a gain told him I understood parking wasn't free and he told me he didn't know where I could get cash.  It's ridiculous to me that a restaurant loses possibly $75-$100 tab bc they only have valet parking with attendants  who are such jerks that aren't capable if telling me if they have an ATM inside so I can pay them. Get it together!"
Anton N.,"Encino, Los Angeles, CA",22,128,92,5.0,6/26/2014,Just like any other cheesecake. But with a few cool things. Like an ocean view terrace. Perfect for a sunset dinner. They are quick to sit you and the staff is freindly. One of my favorite cheesecake factories in LA.
Tanishia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,186,917,4.0,5/15/2013,Only came here for dessert Cheesecake covered with Strawbwerries Yuuuumstersssss whew enjoy....
Elvia C.,"Crenshaw, Los Angeles, CA",2,4,,1.0,3/21/2014,Wow I have never in my life experienced service or lack there of this horrible. We have our drinks. That is all. We have been waiting for at least 20 minutes for someone to take our oder. I don't want to say that the staff here is racist but really what other conclusion can I come to at this point for absolutely no service. I can't comment on the food because well at this pace I don't think I'll ever get to try it.
Jonny W.,"Culver City, CA",28,33,13,5.0,1/14/2013,"Great Service, Great Food, and Great Atmosphere!  Always at least a 30 minute wait for Dinner and they do not take reservations. Sit outside on the heated patio if you have a chance, the View is incredible, especially at night! Great for a Date or any other occasion. Waiters are very friendly, attentive, and helpful. And of Course, the Cheese Cake is delicious. My favorite is Pistachio."
mike s.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,49,9,5.0,6/14/2014,"My wife and I have gone to this location for years . My wife loves the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake there, We go for Sunday brunch. The last time we went , the country potatoes were way over cooked and not eatable. I did a followup with corp. I was contacted by Greg , the manager there. He apologized for the situation. Greg made a bad situation right and took care of the customer in the end  and we will be going back."
Alexander N.,"PLAYA DEL REY, CA",1,143,75,4.0,1/5/2013,"Been there thrice so far. Service was good both times and first time was saturday evening! Staff is very friendly and smiley.  Food is good with a HUGE choice, you will never grow bored here. They also have low calorie menu (big plus for me) and low carb cheesecake. Also place is real value for money. All in all good view, atmosphere, food, service and prices. Edit:Last visit they also added a leaflet with calorie listing of all their offerings. This is awesome and I wish more restaurants did this!"
Kayley Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,11,,3.0,2/26/2015,"I went to this location on my first night in Los Angeles. A friend took me to Marina del Rey Cheesecake Factory because of the view. I found the waitstaff to be friendly, but the place was a bit crowded. The view of the marina was charming, with that sweet California weather. It's nice for a glass of wine and a light meal. They also have a variety of hearty dishes for the hungrier folks. Cheesecake was... Awesome."
Linda V.,"SYLMAR, CA",1,15,,5.0,12/7/2013,"It was early on the saturday after Thanksgiving and not crowded yet.     the waiter couldn't have been nicer and very attentive.  I got the chinese chick salad.  should have asked for dressing on the side, my mistake. But it wasn't too heavy and very delicious.  My bro got the gumbo and it was awesome.   Gumbo enough for two!!  lots to take home.  I like to sit at the bar.  There are 4 cozy booths and not noisy in there.  Great ambiance, service, food so it get s 5 stars from me."
Taylor L.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,28,34,1.0,3/18/2014,They really need to check their take out orders to guest. They missed components to dishes and don't repeat the order. This is unacceptable!'
Maged N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",36,13,13,1.0,3/30/2014,The service by the host was amazing upon our arrival. Shortly after the waitress service is below zero. She may been new our the store was running with non effective management. One waitress was helping over 20 tables at the same time due to late hours shift. They were short staff not sure if they were cutting hours or worries about over time. We order the food before 3 tables and never got our food. Sure a manager came when we asked for the check without eating our main course due to lack of timing. The manager by the name of Mark came and apologized and started scripting. This place use to always be my favorite. I can assure u that we will never go there again. Service was beyond not effective.
