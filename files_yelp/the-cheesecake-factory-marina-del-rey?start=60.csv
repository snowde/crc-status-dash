Sean D.,"Culver City, CA",525,1,1,1.0,8/28/2017,"I have never done a review because I hate to be petty but this was unacceptable.. I ordered a take out pasta to eat at home. midway through my meal i scooped up a WOODEN SANDWICH PICK and almost put it in my mouth. Luckily i was looking or else i could have hurt myself. I felt disgusted and threw the meal away, i dont even know if it was used or not but that ruined my day.. to top it off it was my b day meal that i wanted. Do not recommend after that"
Christine H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,3.0,12/20/2017,"Be careful when splitting the bill. They list gratuity options for you, but it based on the TOTAL bill not the split portion. It says that, but people don't always pay attention (a mistake I made today). In my opinion, that's pretty sneaky. Most places show only based on the split portion. Otherwise, things were fine."
Erma P.,"Bellflower, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/30/2017,Do not deserve a star. So the one star is because Yelp does not allow me to comment without a star. Worst service of all CF I've been. It's a shame because they are in a prime location.
Elizabeth V.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,112,87,5.0,5/13/2017,Fast and friendly service. Delicious food. Had the rib eye steak such a huge portion and amazing flavor. Their kids menu is very generous with their portion sizes so you will definitely have left overs! My daughters fave is the spaghetti and giant meatball. Beautiful views on the outdoor deck and gas heaters to keep u warm.
Christopher L.,"San Francisco, CA",504,291,715,3.0,1/2/2017,"The service here was pretty good, the food was pretty standard. The food took a while to come out. Not much to say, because most people know what The Cheesecake Factory is. It's a pretty big chain and I guess they're most well known for having a large selection of cheesecakes. The cheesecakes were better than the actual meals. I would like to note that their menu is massive though. We had a large group so we made reservations and were seated right away. To park here you have to use valet and it costs $6 I think?"
Alyssa G.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,22,,1.0,9/25/2017,"We love the Cheesecake Factory as a chain, but this location was the worst we've ever encountered. After waiting past quoted time, they sat us *no joke* in a dark corner with burnt out lights, and a locked door next to us pretending to be a wall, which was very likely against fire code. I have very good eyesight and I could not see my plate or utensils. We were so upset about the willingness to seat anyone at this table, we would have walked out if we weren't utilizing our gift cards for our hotel stay up the street. The service was bad, and food was average."
Max Z.,"Encino, CA",41,15,4,1.0,9/5/2017,"After about 1 hour of waiting my wife's burger arrived with long black hair on the bun. Another 45 min passed, manager with funny mustache came in but not to apologize but to tell that it takes 30 for replacement burger. Another 15 passed another manager came in , he did apologize but also kept on me telling me that replacement takes 40 min to cook. I am not sure how they cooking them, it shouldn't take 40 to refire a burger. 60 min passed new burger arrived finally, but we didn't want anymore , it was on the house, who cares about $13.99 , evening was ruined. Thank you Cheesecake Factory!!"
Molly S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,27,14,2.0,6/18/2017,"Didn't have the best experience here, such a shame. Our server Chloe was wonderful, and none of this is her fault. Came here on a busy Tuesday night (???) They were out of everything. No salmon, no fish of any kind, no BREAD. The list of things she couldn't serve us was a small scroll. It was ridiculous. Apparently they missed a shipment so... that sucked for everyone involved.  I ordered an eggplant parmesan. The eggplant was raw in the middle. It was served with an angel hair with pesto which I thought was odd considering it's traditionally served with spaghetti marinara... you know, because there is already marinara sauce on the eggplant. Paid full price for everything. Oh well."
Yeşim A.,"Glendale, CA",16,1,,5.0,10/23/2017,Stuff is amazing! So positive they just made my day specially Iman is a great guy and know how to communicate with people its so cool! Thanks for good service
Kerri H.,"Torrance, CA",1489,638,2719,5.0,3/3/2016,"Well, it's cheesecake factory so it deserves five stars no matter what. I enjoyed the white sangria, which I have never tried before. The bartender convinced me to try the red sangria which was even better. Just ate a couple appetizers but they did not disappoint. The view is incredible and there's plenty of outdoor seating. The service is great and they really try to get you in as soon as possible. Unfortunately they were out of wheat bread which is one of the highlights of eating at cheesecake factory. That just means I have to go back... Highly recommend!"
Janis Rebecca A.,"Torrance, CA",432,33,53,3.0,9/16/2016,"Stuck between 3 or 4 stars!  I came here with a party of 7 recently late afternoon this past Thursday.  Even if the service was a bit slow (we waited quite a while for our food) our server was awesome. He was attentive to our needs and had a great attitude.  I ordered the Vegan Cobb Salad with a side of sweet potato sides to share, it was filling and delicious! The ingredients tasted very fresh to my surprise and came with hearty vegetables and grains such as beets, asparagus, avocado, quinoa and more. I topped it off with the balsamic dressing but there are plenty more vegan dressings to choose from. Honestly this is something I can easily make at home and not worth $12, but the company was well worth it!  One bad thing.. while our server was great, there was a lady server who brought out some of our dishes who was incredibly rude. The order for my friends pasta was incorrect and my friend asked her if she will be charged more. The server wasn't giving her a clear yes or no answer so I stepped in and casually and clearly asked her (because the wrong order included an extra ingredient that she didn't order) and she snapped back at me saying that she's trying to communicate that out with my friend. Our whole table was speechless and later I saw one of the male servers scolding her, he was also at the table serving and his face looked very angry when she snapped back at me. I didn't complain to the servers about her but my friends were very angry, maybe more shocked than angry because my tone and words were not offensive at all. Not a huge deal but.. maybe she was having a bad day! *shrugs"
Lauren C.,"Studio City, CA",303,22,1,5.0,6/18/2017,"Regina was wonderful!!! I'm giving this a 5 star rating because of her. She's what made this experience tolerable.  We were under quoted on the wait. When our buzzer went off, we had to wait for another few minutes while the hostesses sifted through their stack of tickets and then our table wasn't set, so we had to wait while the hostess set our table. Overall, I think they could improve with the host/ FOH area.  Another kind server, David, ran us over some bread, even though we were not in his section and I appreciate that so much.  Once again- Regina and David were so helpful!!! Thank you!!!!"
Chloe P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",16,30,20,3.0,6/25/2017,"Went for my birthday about 2 days ago .  I loved the fact that it has outdoor seating and you have a pretty beach view , but they should maybe space out the tables a little more it was so crowded !  Our waitress was really nice but it seemed she was handling too many tables and didn't check back with us to see if we needed anything .  We ordered our burgers and they were brought out without fries . We were told they'd be out soon , they never came . We were practically done so I asked about our fries and she was kinda confused ... Lol  A manager came to talk to us and offered us  two free slices of cheesecake ( plus our missing fries to-go ) for the inconvenience . It was a sweet gesture and I was surprised that they actually came to apologize . I mean it was my birthday , and If I'm paying for $15 burger I need my fries ! Lol  I guess I will be returning :)!"
Kyle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,56,6,3.0,5/21/2017,"We have been to the Cheesecake Factory several times for Brunch in the past couple of months. This time we were there to celebrate my Fiancee and I's engagement with our parents who were meeting for the first time.  First of all the food is always great! I particularly enjoy the Eggs Benedict. The yolk is runny (very important) and the English Muffin was well toasted. My Fiancee had the Chilaquiles and she loved them. Crispy tortilla strips and a medium level of spice. We got there right at 10am when they open for Brunch. $6 valet!!! $6 and I watched the guy park the car in the 3rd spot 20 yards from where I was standing. Wow. Our next issue came when we sat outside. We had 7 people in our group and we were walked right out to the patio. They placed a few tables together and moved a few umbrellas and asked us to sit. The seating on one side of the table was sooooo cramped that even my Fiancee (5'2"", 110lbs) had to squeeze in to sit. There were so many umbrellas on the patio that we couldn't move the seats out far enough to sit properly. Now I am not suggesting having less umbrellas, they are totally needed, but the guy who set up the tables didn't even stick around to make sure that his setup was done well. After we fixed the seating ourselves, we looked around for the menus that the waiter was carrying before he set the tables up. We found them stacked on top of the bussing station which was conveniently located on the opposite side of our table. The whole meal we heard crashing and clanging of plates and silverware. Not enjoyable.  Next time I know not to sit in that section of the patio. All in all the experience was OK. Next time I come here I will write another review and I hope for it to be better."
Avi K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",169,94,20,5.0,5/16/2017,Love the location! friendly staff and absolutely beautiful ambiance. food is always great as well.
Kev W.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,30,,1.0,4/16/2017,"Great food, service good and the view overlooking the marina was fantastic.  One star is for the very aggressive valet parking attendants. Charging expensive rates and didn't even park my car, just wanted money for being there.  Pretty unfortunate that this let us down, but there are plenty more around, this was just a trial location for us."
Michael K.,"Burbank, CA",1,9,,1.0,10/1/2017,dirty silverware no service we ask For dressing for salad  didn't show up till we finish so the bread.one server show me where to tip. tip for  what service I didn't get.
Stephen D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,27,1.0,6/17/2017,Ordered food through DoorDash and had a horrible experience with both. Our food was over 30 minutes late and came cold. Disgusting! And the presentation was terrible. They didn't even put the requested bread and utensils in the bag.
Michael-Anthony T.,"Santa Ana, CA",41,233,13,4.0,10/20/2016,"This location is annoying because you either have to pay for parking on one side or get valet in front of the restaurant.  Other then the annoying parking, The Cheesecake Factory will always be the same everywhere you go.  The outdoor seating gives it that extra star making this location a solid 4 star. The outdoor seating is great and gives a good view of the beach."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,1/25/2017,"Enormous menu, way too many options, you get bored with the menu, way too much reading and way too overwhelming. Service was rushed, they are way too busy to offer great service. Prices are a bit high for the quality that you get, don't expect great meats, best to stick to the basic dishes. You can tell the food is mass produced and while it is a bit better than some of your run of the mill chain restaurants, it's not a place I would chose to return to."
