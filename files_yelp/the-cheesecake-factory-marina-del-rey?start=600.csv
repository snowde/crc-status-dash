gene a.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,4.0,2/9/2013,"Our group had lunch today, 2-9-13 at noon. It was pretty busy, servers running all over the place. The layout is sort of weird, you have to walk thru the food pick up area. Very congested at that point, but somehow it adds to the experience. The food is ""Cheesecake Factory"", interesting selections, prepared and presented very good, not great, but very good. The reason for me writing this review is because of our server, GINA, that remembered serving our group in December. I ordered ""same as the last time"" and she said ""Jambalaya, right"". nailed it. Made our visit very special. Ask for Gina if you do lunch on Saturdays, you will enjoy your visit as much as we did."
Sazia M.,"Culver City, CA",2,5,1,4.0,11/21/2014,"Their avocado egg rolls are a must!!! This location is best for a Sunday brunch or a birthday dinner over the weekend, just be sure to make reservations before hand because it does get a bit crowded due to the view."
Nargiss M.,"Winnetka, CA",89,34,7,3.0,4/21/2014,It's just like any other Cheesecake Factory with mediocre food. The view off the patio deserves 5 stars but they literally cram tables together. Both times I had gone there it was myself and another friend but it felt like a party of 4 since we were literally sitting adjacent to a table with two other people. They have plenty of space outside but the downstairs is completely empty. They need to give each party some privacy.
Natalie A.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,20,2,1.0,5/23/2015,"I took my guest to this restaurant , we were seated right away! It took the waiter at least 10 minutes to get to our table. I ordered avocado rolls for our appetizer and 2 drinks. After 7 minutes he came back with the drinks and we ordered our main dish, mine was garlic noodles and I specifically told the waiter NO OIL and NO Butter ! then he left. We waited at least for 30 minutes and no appetizer and no food!!! I called the waiter and asked about the appetizer and he goes OMG ! he had forgotten to put in the order for avocado rolls !!! so he ran back to the kitchen and came back telling us we had to wait 7 minutes more! I was upset and embarrassed in front of my guest. that was the first problem, the second problem is that they bring my garlic noodle and there is oil and butter dripping from it and there was a Ton of oil at the bottom of the pasta dish!!! I called the waiter and told him I had ordered NO OIL so he calls the manager who's name was Mark, he comes and tries to convince me that the oil is not oil and its chicken broth like I am stupid!!! I said this is oil and you must change it so he takes the food and comes back in 2 minutes and tells me that they took out the oil but it was still so so oily , I told him I wasn't stupid and asked him to make a new one without oil. so with an angry tone of voice he goes : OK. He comes back after 10 minutes with a new dish, anyhow we waisted a lot of time there and it was so upsetting. finally the waiter brings the bill and tells me they took care of my dish and I won't have to pay! so I look at the bill and see that my dish is charged twice and taken out once !!!!!!!! ????? They really think everyone is dumb ! I called the waiter and he goes oh sorry let me tell the manager so he leaves and comes back in 5 minutes telling me that they didn't charge me for the new one but I have to play for one! I was so furious and my guest was so upset that I said lat me just pay and get the hell out of this horrible place. Their food is so expensive and you still don't get what you order and you still have to pay. Cheesecake Factory marina del rey is a horrible place and I don't recommend it to anybody."
Ish S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/8/2014,"Came here yesterday and it is much better than the Cheesecake Factory in Huntington Beach. Love eating at the patio, great food, and the waiters are wonderful. Yes it's a little pricey, but it's worth the nice experience. It's also very romantic. No draft beer, but there's still good bottled beer. Overall a great experience with great heating lamps."
Jackie P.,"Culver City, CA",11,19,10,1.0,3/10/2014,"We've been going to this Cheesecake Factory for years. Mainly for the signature drink, The Ritz. Beautiful day, off work early and headed start to the Marina. Â Got a nice table,waiter comes over, we order 2 Ritz!! Then BAM! Waiter says no more Ritz WTH!! That was it. we just walked out. It was the best drink. We won't go back, until the THE RITZ is back!!!"
Rey L.,"El Segundo, CA",120,851,1991,5.0,7/24/2012,"weird. i didn't realize i hadn't reviewed this place yet. go figure. eaten here 1,041 times before and i guess i never thought to review. this is our favorite CF. it used to be down the street from our old house. parking is valet only, but, not too bad at $3.50 for lunch and $4.50 for dinner. table seating is quick and painless, even if you want to sit outside. we've never had to wait more than 10mins even on a busy summer sunday afternoon to get patio seats. staff have always been pleasant and food has always been consistently good. obviously, we've got our faves. granted they're mass produced made to order food, it's still delicious. my picks are the asian beef strip thing, the basic burger and the chicken salad. i love their lunch specials that come with soup/salad combos. this particular spot is right next to a man-made beach, ironically called Mother's Beach. lots and lots of kiddies enjoy this little stretch of sand and water located just at the edge of the boats. there is also a kids play area with slides, swings and jungle gym stuff just a few feet from the water. it's a great view from the seats at CF and a great way to work off some of that complimentary bread you didn't have to finish. :) we just recently discovered the beachside patio seating. easier access to the beach, but, with a limited menu. and by limited, i mean only their top 100 items are on this menu. snap. great spot to come out to on a summer day. we'll keep coming back."
Skit B.,"San Jacinto, CA",21,6,,3.0,8/30/2013,Good place if you know what to get. im a fan of their lettce wraps especially the peanut sauce which is just truly amazing.  they have good pasta and i like the free bread they serve. you can ask your server for free olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip the bread into.... so good.  the cheesecakes are pretty good. especially the red velvet flavor. be sure to check the calorie count though. some of them are As high as thousands of calories per slice.
V. E. D.,"Malibu, CA",50,52,,2.0,5/23/2015,Long story short.. came here for graduation lunch..the Hostesses were short and rude..our waitress was spot on and gave great friendly service for a party of 25..my Daughter had the Salmon and as we were leaving became violently ill.. I mentioned it to the Manager on duty and she was nice and took my name and number to check on her.. which she did not do. After I got my car from the Valet and while my sister waited for her car another lady waiting for her car told her she got very ill after her meal and the manager comped her lunch.. she had fish as well.. Don't get fish here!
Bethany K.,"Orange County, CA",102,597,106,4.0,1/12/2013,"My husband LOVE LOVE LOVES the Cheesecake Factory... probably partially because of the whole NBA-players-love-it phenomenon (Google it!).  You probably already know about the gigantic menu and often good service, huge portions, etc, so I'll just get to it. LOGISTICS *We used to go to the Brentwood location... until it closed. *SOB* *Unavoidable valet parking for $5... I was super tempted to drive around to find an alternative, but whatevs. It was cold. *Curbside to go is a great option! Review the hugeo menu online, call in your fav, you don't get to eat as much bread (which could be a good thing...) and you just call when you get there and they bring it out for you with the bill. They run in to ring up your card (who uses cash nowadays?) and off you go! No wait, designated parking spots, and you also get to avoid the $5 parking... win win. *I've never known a Cheesecake Factory to not have an annoyingly long wait during anything remotely close to ""peak hours."" Dinner at 9pm on a Friday, thankfully, is not considered ""peak hours"" :) *Have not yet enjoyed the view----I guess that's why people suck up the $5!  FOOD *I would rather get half as much food... but it is what it is. Share items, if you can agree on what to order (ha) or ask for a To Go box early so you don't accidentally-I-mean-uh eat everything! *Thank you, fellow reviewers, for mentioning the Avocado Egg Rolls ($10)--they were GREAT. You get 6 decent sized eggrolls (or I guess it's technically 3, cut into halves) with a BOMB sauce. I think they're vegetarian... but didn't ask. *One of my FAVORITE hidden gems: KALE SALAD! It's on the ""Small Plates and Snacks"" page -- not on the Salad... or Side Salad... or Entree Salad sections. Kale salad. $5.95 (!) and a decent size--with the bread and an appetizer or dessert or bites of other people's food, it's definitely enough for an entree. I think it has... apples... and almonds? and... other yummy things. Simple, but tasty... and honestly, the Cheesecake Factory is not known for it's *simplicity* lol. The dressing (which is delish) is not vegan but it's a pepper-y buttermilk and I remember it (pre-vegan days) being delish! HIDDEN GEM. *Some of my other favorites (pre-vegan): Miso Salmon (loved this so much I obsessively Google'd for the recipe and tried replicating at home more than once), Garlic Noodles, and the Strawberry Shortcake dessert! I'm not the biggest fan of cheesecake (irony of ironies) but LOVE their Strawberry Shortcake... biscuitybready shortcake, vanilla ice cream, and lots of strawberries. *bliss* Anyway, we'll obviously be at the Cheesecake Factory more than I could hope or ask for, but it's consistent and the selection is great so it is what it is. I would give it 3 stars for the stupid $5 parking and how they're so obviously contributing to part of why Americans over-eat (lol semi-serious) but whatever--it is what it is! And so much of what they have is good."
Ed F.,"Venice, CA",0,60,,5.0,11/26/2014,"Eat on the patio or drink cocktails by the fire-pit overlooking the marina. -It's like you're in the South of France!! Great outdoor atmosphere and lighting, huge menu and friendly staff. Surprisingly romantic (patio) - this cheesecake Factory is a WINNER!!!"
Travis I.,"Culver City, CA",1102,473,2443,5.0,3/3/2010,"- Huge Menu ((Like, epically large. Jerry's Famous Deli on crack.)) - Friendly waitstaff. - Equal-opportunity bread service. ((Brown and white chillin' in the same basket... I like that.)) - Lotsa sneaky places to park off-site, so you don't have to let some dude park your car and charge you for it.  - Nice patio overlooking the little inland beach. ((Heat lamps included, for those nippley nights.)) - Booze city. - And yes, as I'm easy to please: FREE REFILLS. Some restaurants are SUCH pricks about this, and I don't get it. If a restaurant charges over $10 for a dish of food, the sodas should come rolling out. If I can score free refills at McDonalds for $1.39, then I shouldn't have to deal with shelling out $5 per coke at a place that's already taking my $12 for a plate of chicken tenders. Â ((deep breath)) Okay... settling down. Kind of a pet peeve. This spot in particular, next to the Marina's endless lines of boats, has always served up the fantastic eats. A little pricey at first glance and then you get your order... and holy sh!t, the portions are gar-gantuan. Worry not. Your entree is enough to satiate you; you needn't order an appetizer, if the budget's tight. That being said, another way to go is to order a couple of appetizers instead of ordering an entree. This is both cost-effective and provides you with some variety, instead of leftovers.  It's truly rare that I find myself at a restaurant in which I'm stumped, as far as menu options. The entire Cheesecake Factory menu is appealing. It's a gift... It's a curse. Because you want EVERYTHING, it sometimes makes it hard to order, but at the same time, at least everything is good. My poor friend had to deal with my indecision during recent visit; how do you decide which ONE to get when seventy five different things are beckoning.  The bottom line: It's all about taste preferences. This is like a TGIF that learned to turn up the quality and diversity of their food a few notches. Yet another restaurant at which you don't have to ask, ""What's good?"" The answer is: ""What SOUNDS good? Because everything is good, so if it sounds good, it IS good.""  In my humble opinion, don't waste your time with conventional fare, here. ((I'm being a hypocrite, as I order things like Cesar salads here, all the time)) But be a better person than me! Order some crazy stuff. Ideas? Why sure... **APPS - Fried Mac-n-Cheese balls - Calamari (Thanks to Tara C. and Trishy B. for the suggestion) - Avocado Eggrolls - Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll **ENTREES - Stuffed Chicken Tortillas - Spicy Crispy Beef ((Yes, Chinese.. And it's one of my FAVES!)) - Chicken Romano ((Pounded Chix breast crusted with parm cheese)) - Shockingly, the Teriyaki Chicken. ((Don't hate me, fellow hapas)) - Chicken Parmesan Sandwich BIGGEST TRIP: Alcoholic Milkshakes. Oh yeah. I've had 'em. Order an extra shot of your favorite booze on the side; the shakes can be a bit weak as far as booze per volume goes.  They seem to have a new variety of pizzas that I've yet to try... Can anyone say, ""Time for a CF DYL Event!"" ?? 5 big fat stars. Beware of waits, but then again, in LA, we're used to that at too many restaurants."
Sonya S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/30/2014,I have eaten at The Cheesecake Factory for many years and for the most part my experiences are usually pretty good. Well it just so happens that there was an issue this particular visit with our order and we had to speak with a manager. When I tell you that great customer service goes a long way!! The manager Chris made everything that went wrong absolutely right... We ended up sorta happy we had a problem in the 1st place just because we got to meet the most nicest manager anyone could ever meet! Thanks again Chris you are so awesome!
Eddie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,23,1,5.0,12/11/2012,"If you want a girl to fall for you and I mean FALL bring her on a date to Cheesecake Factory in marina del ray, ca right on the beach! First dates are a must here! I brought my girl here on her birthday right in front of the beach we had a table and I took her to the front of the ocean and I shouldn't go on you get the picture after a few drinks life is beautiful. I gave her Birthday present to her right at the beach front. And yea you know the rest.  The Cheesecake Factory's menu and food is always amazing no mater where u are but I must say a must have appetizer is the avocado egg rolls. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for having such an amazing location on the beach."
Lala B.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,13,,1.0,2/28/2014,"My last experience was HORRIBLE. It started when I got a delinquent notice for parking ticket. Apparently the Valet staff parked my car in unauthorized place and I got a ticket for $63 in the mail ... huh, expensive for an OK restaurant, on the top of that I paid $5 to them to park my car, get the ticket and then dump the original. Very nice experience! For sure I am not going back to a place that force me to valet my car to a company that its staff are not responsible!  ***************STAY AWAY FROM THEM!*****************"
Brian S.,"Winnetka, CA",0,583,137,4.0,1/31/2011,"As with all of the other Cheesecake Factory locations that I've visited, this one put in an admirable performance. Food was good and service was solid. Wait time for an indoor table was not too long (30 minutes). Portions are mostly big and I'd guess that 80% or more of the diners were taking doggy bags with them. Plus, the food is good enough to actually eat it the next day!  I'm a real picky patron and will comment in the negative on two things. First, I detest being forced to valet park and pay $5. The reason I say that is because the fixed price is $4.50 but the valet had no intention of giving change.  I also wish they would get under control is the way their ""car hop"" waiters exit the building. I like their appearance and the way they were speedy in delivering to the waiting customers, but each one of them SMASHED the exit bar on the door... which was unlocked and there was no need to even push the exit bar to open the door. It is a very loud and disturbing noise to keep hearing for the people waiting for a table or sitting in the bar.  Other than that, it is a crowded and noisy dining room, but one that gives a real sense of fun and being a ""happening place"".  Next time I'll have to save room for some cheesecake... but I say that every time and it only happens at lunch!"
Fonsy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,3,5.0,5/11/2014,Waited 2 hours to be seated but it's Mother's Day and it was expected. We were finally seated at the dreadful corner table #76 Â and it was terrible. It was a four person table which they made for five. One of the chairs was in the aisle. We requested to speak to the manager and she reseated us even during such a chaotic day. A Huge thanks to manager Jennifer for making sure we were happy. We (5) were fully accommodated and the food was served astonishingly quick. Our server Aaron was awesome and very attentive. Thanks!
Elizabeth C.,"Studio City, CA",140,14,13,5.0,5/26/2014,Great atmosphere good vibes over looking the boats n water great food and great service
Paul G.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,30,5,1.0,1/26/2014,What a disappointed night out. Â Came here on Sunday night out. ..place wasn't as busy as normally is...yet we decided to stay by the bar...it was a total mistake. The server took forever to come and even take drinks...Once again very few tables. We have seeing him taking care of another table that ordered a bottle of wine and he totally was all over them. Finally he came to take care of us...we ordered after 25 mins waiting. ..we were hungry and thirsty of course. Â Then he came back to said they didn't have only favorite thing I normally order! What the hell...be nice a least and learned to be caring to your work! I am a local and it gets me upset to know they changed this people so often that they don't care.
M M.,"Norwalk, CA",2,18,6,5.0,6/29/2014,My first time ever!! This location is beautiful service was friendly food....Aaaamazing!
