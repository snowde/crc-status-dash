Jenny C.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,56,16,2.0,4/22/2015,"Horrible experience ordering takeout on Wednesday night. First I called in about 30 minutes ahead to make sure that my takeout would be ready for pick up. Pulled into the lot and parked at an empty stall. Immediately an attendant told me that I could not park there and I had to either valet or park in another lot farther down. I don't think so! There is no way I am parking that far to just to walk in and pick up my takeout! When I explained to him I was picking up, he said, ""You have 10 minutes."" When I arrived at the pick up counter, my order was not ready. I waited for 20 minutes while he tries to locate my receipt. He assisted other customers as he waited for his manager to assist. Mind you, he did not bother to tell me this. He just started assisting other customers. When is manager arrived, his manager said ""So what do you want me to do about it?"" The guy at the register continued to assist other customers in line. He just ignored me and did not apologize for the wait or anything. He just looked frustrated. Even the customers in line noticed me waiting on the side and asked the if I had been helped. The employee replied, ""Yes, yes I am helping her."" Really? How can you when you're helping other people? This location is the worst experience I've had a Cheesecake Factory location."
Anita W.,"Los Angeles, CA",331,369,887,3.0,1/12/2011,"$2.50 for parking during lunch. $4.50 for parking during dinner. Self park or Valet. Either way you gotta shell out the $$. Ridiculous.  I've lived in Marina del Rey for 2 years now and I've never actually been to this CF location despite the fact I do enjoy me the large CF menu options and cheesecakey goodness. My friends who just moved to MDR thought we should try it out so I headed over. Quick little drive from my place and I thought to myself ""How awesome! So close - I can get my CF fix anytime I want...wait what's this. Oh valet...I have to pay? How much? Ok can I self-park? I can...but I still have to pay...wth.""  Immediate loss of 1 star. You walk in and it looks rather small at first but after walking through a little maze of tables you get to a larger back area. There is a nice outdoor seating area with cabanas but it was far too cold and dark to enjoy that.  Our waitress was adorable and sweet - we couldn't have asked for a more smiley, attentive waitress. Prompt taking of drinks and bread delivery. But then there was the wait for food. I didn't mind it as I was enjoying good conversation but seriously...my patience was being tried.  Minus another star.  Eventually the food came. It was standard good CF food. Nothing excitingly crazy but what I wanted. We paid the bill, paid the valet (honestly, it irks me to no end that my meal was $10.95 and valet cost almost 50% of that) and I decided if I ever have any CF craving again I'll either do curbside or do my waistline and frugal self a favor and not go."
Travis R.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",21,57,,3.0,5/28/2012,"1) Waits aren't as long as the line looks. 2) Good food/ good service. 3) Numerous seating options, inside and out."
Kati G.,"Lancaster, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/24/2016,The service is horrible we waited a half an hour just to see anyone to speak to you and then they were totally rude. Also I guess they had never heard of an air-conditioner.  It's 100° outside and 200 in here. I have not even received my food yet but I'm sure that'll be another four hours from now!! Also I am still waiting for my beverage (water). So far that's taken 45 minutes.  Despicable. Update I just got my food even worse than I thought it was going to be. Our waitress literally cannot get anything right. I asked her for a side of maynoisse when I got my burger she came back an hour later after I had already eaten it.  could you be any more disrespectful. Then my friend asked her for another  thing of bread and instead she brought out 2 more mayonnaise sides. Last but not least we ordered a dessert which I don't know why because obviously t they can't do shit right and guess what... She messed that up too!!we heard the table behind us also complained to the manager and got a free meal The moral of the story is if I could give here less than a -4 stars I would.
Buddah L.,"Santa Ana, CA",197,36,37,2.0,7/19/2014,So It's a Saturday at 130. and My friend and I decided to come to the Cheesecake Factory. when we get here the wait is reasonable 20-30 mins and it's nice. the waiter is good the hostess are good. that's where the two stars comes in. but I need to say that we sat down at about 2pm and didn't get our food for 50 mins!! a family of 4 sat down and finished before we got our food. AND when we did get our food our steaks were entirely too well done and the food was COLD?! seriously I had to send it back and get it re done. never will I come back to this Cheesecake Factory again.
Kim W.,"Hanover, MA",0,17,9,4.0,6/1/2014,"First time eating at The Cheesecake Factory.  Yummy food, large portions and beautiful view of the boats in the water.  I didn't even get to the cheesecake I was so full =(  Loved the valet parking and the staff were very friendly!"
Rebecca P.,"Seattle, WA",241,761,95,3.0,10/23/2012,"After reading all the reviews for this place and factoring in my general feel for TCF based on past experiences and my bias against chains in general, I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, valet parking sucks, but I found parking for a weekday lunch just two blocks away and sauntered over. Sitting out on the patio overlooking a somewhat surreal vision of a beach... a few blocks from the Pacific, we ordered from a patient, upbeat server. Soon, she brought our meals--my friend's Pasta Da Vinci (basically a version of Marsala, 2.5-3 stars) and my Santa Fe Chicken Salad (4 stars, even if not the traditional flavor I have come to expect from places like Bread and Porridge in Santa Monica). We followed up with what the Factory does best--cheesecake. Now, my piece seemed significantly smaller than my friends, but it was still a little bit of heaven in its seasonal pumpkiny goodness. But, OMG, I had a bite of her chocolate one--I think the Godiva--and it was AMAZING. I'd go back just for that... sitting on the surreal beach.  Bottom line: Sometimes chains don't suck as much as you think. Try the salad. Get the chocolate cheesecake. And, then run 6 miles. :)"
S M.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,55,25,5.0,10/17/2014,"Best food! You can never go wrong with CCF. I wish they hadn't closed their Brentwood location. All the CCF restaurants are great. They are very busy, but worth the wait!"
Andrea M.,"Los Angeles, CA",595,478,815,5.0,8/13/2012,"Haven't been in years but boy have they renovated their outside lower patio! Went on a nice sunny day and had drinks with appetizers, the ambiance and weather coupled with the cocktails! What more could you ask for??? I will def return, looks like the night life is great too, heat lamps and fire pits with comfy couches, oh yeah"
Elizabeth R.,"Newport Beach, CA",2,21,2,4.0,9/10/2015,"I love the food at Cheesecake Factory, but the service at this particular one is consistently slow."
Sochil F.,"Lennox, CA",1,13,8,2.0,7/26/2015,I should of read the reviews before coming to this location. I've been to other Cheesecake Factory's and never had such a bad experience as today. First off just like others mentioned this place was jam packed it was Saturday and we found out later there was an event nearby. We were surprised when they said there wouldn't be a wait but we soon realized it was because they were giving us a small table off the side with heavy traffic. The seats were so close together felt like we were part of a big party rather than dinner for two. Our server was slow taking our order our drinks took long he couldn't get my husband a second beer before he finished the rest of his food. He said he'd get a manager to find out what was happening at bar we never heard back. We didn't even order dessert at our table because we knew it would take too long we figured we'd order and pay for it at the dessert station before we left which was another chaos people standing around everywhere waiters squeezing through people bumping you no space to stand without having to move for someone else to get by. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the food was good and the cheesecake was delicious but next time I know to stay away from this location.
Andrea C.,"Santa Monica, CA",76,8,,1.0,1/3/2015,"Do not come here if you have a big party since they don't take reservations and the wait is super long. We had a party of 8 people and waited over 75 minutes for a table. The waiter took a long time to get us bread and throughout the night, we could not get anyone to serve us drinks for quite a while. We were starving but the appetizers came after the entrees did. The pastas we were ordered were pretty bland. We came to celebrate 2 birthdays. They usually offer complimentary ice-cream sundaes to you if you have a birthday, but if you want the free sundae, DO NOT buy a cheesecake for dessert. We bought 4 cheesecakes and were not offered the sundaes because we bought the cheesecakes. However, their policy is, if you don't buy a cheesecake, then they will give you the free sundae. Very odd logic to me, since, if we had known this ahead of time, we would not have bought the cheesecakes. Customers should be rewarded for buying their cheesecakes, not for NOT buying them. When the cheesecakes arrived, we also didn't have any knives for a long time and had to use our forks to cut them. The cheesecakes were not particularly good and just tasted greasy. It was a terrible night and ruined my birthday. I would highly recommend NOT coming here."
Polina R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,3,5.0,9/12/2013,Some of the best service I have received at Cheesecake was at this location.  The fact that it is by a beach does attract a lot of tourists to the area and the service decreases with the amount of people present. The ambiance is exceptional since the outdoor seating area provides a nice view. Do recommend this location because of the gorgeous marina beach view !
Nicole S.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,152,22,5.0,12/27/2012,"Favorite place on earth! Good food, awesome cheesecake :), and THIS location is the best one ever."
Jesstine G.,"West Los Angeles, CA",230,249,333,4.0,11/21/2009,"This is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location.  I like sitting on the patio overlooking the marina, even on a cold night (they have heat lamps).  And it's open relatively late!   I'm not too happy about paying for valet, and the menu is a bit pricey.  the bill usually amounts to ~$100 for two pp (inc drinks, appetizer, entrees, dessert).  But I guess it's worth it because I'm a regular.  If you haven't already, try the spinach dip... it's a must-have for me.  Also, the herb-crusted salmon (minus the lemon sauce, imo) is delicious. Great location for a beachside afternoon or local late-night option.   ps.  Ask for Ursula.  She's our favorite!  Sweet girl and great service."
Anthony T.,"Burbank, CA",1,19,1,1.0,2/4/2014,"I went to dinner with my wife. After we ordered the food, i specified that i wanted angel hair pasta instead of regular pasta. The food came with regular pasta. After telling the waitress , she took it back to bring the correct one. It took them 15-20 minutes to come back with the correct order, when my wife was already done eating. I just had two bites and didn't enjoy my dinner at all since my wife was sitting and waiting for me. After all the manager just offered a free cheesecake instead of complimentary dinner , which would have been correct for an upscaled restaurant!"
Richard B.,"Laguna Hills, CA",148,829,3,3.0,10/21/2012,"It is all about the patio, a perfect spot to have a chill lunch.  CCF always has an expansive menu, so it is hard not to find something you will love.  I am hooked on the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  I also think their brown bread is the bomb."
Donovan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,3,,4.0,8/19/2013,"Favorite cheesecake location hands down.  The view is just breathtaking, especially during the sunset. Brought my date here, and just as expected, she loved it. I got my usual smoke house bbq burger and she got a shrimp with angel hair. Her shrimp pasta was ok, little dry for me but she enjoyed it. Service was pretty good considering how packed it was on a Saturday night.   We ended the night with something oreo cheesecake, which melted in my mouth. Go try that cheesecake guys. you won't regret it. Overall, good service, good food, good beer and wine, good desert, good view, and good company.   =]    minus 1 star for the valet.. little too pricey, but it is in marina del rey..."
Pam S.,"Upland, CA",589,656,482,3.0,4/29/2010,"Went to this location 2 nights in a row :) Of course we sat outside as I have mentioned before Thomas Jefferson ALWAYS prefers to sit outside... no matter that his Pammy is FREEZIN HER ARSE OFF!! (mumbling to self must be that Swedish blood of his =/ So as I was saying we went on Monday night had a rather nice dinner our standard Chicken thai Lettuce Wraps which are always the BOMB those 3 sauces are yummy. I had a Irish Nut (humph! trying to warm my brown arse up!) Thomas Jefferson had a wonderful concoction called ""The Blackjack"" as TJ nickname is ""Midnight"" we thought this apro pos :) it was good. This place is about 200 yards away from the front door of the Marina Del Rey Marriott so if you stay at the hotel and do not wish to partake of the hotell restaurant seek what is tried and true. Nice view of the Marina and they have plenty of heaters outside.  On the second night the service SUCKED! I ordered the Wild Mushroom soup which was okay and TJ got the Eggplant Sandwich which turned out to be delicious but BLOODY HELL we waited for (what felt like) a half an hour outside in the misting dew while I counted no more than 10 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. Okay and why was there like 20 servers on that night.... it was late after 9:00pm hmmm something that my food & beverage manager/mind wonders about from time to time. Anyhoo when our server returned to us we just told her to wrap it up and we'd take it home... no need to continue to freeze AND be hungry LOL ps. The manager did come over to see explain that the Eggplant takes longer to grill as it is freshly cut and made (sigh) you know as a former food server I can honestly say I was more on the side of TMI for my guests because it would probably effect my tip otherwise...

Geoff M.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",79,344,946,4.0,10/10/2012,"I cant believe I have only been here once!  Although it has the name of the Cheesecake Factory and it might give the impression of being desert heavy, it has one of the largest most diverse menus I have ever seen!  The freaking menu was humongous!  I ordered a Cajun pasta and it was wonderful!  It goes without saying that with the cheesecake was outstanding as well. The location was also very nice being right on the marina del rey harbor."
