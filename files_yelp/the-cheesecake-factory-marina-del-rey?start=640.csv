Nadia L.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",0,37,,2.0,7/14/2012,The waiters were very friendly and helpful. The place itself not too bad. The reason for 2 stars - the poor quality of food for too much money. To name one example: I dont understand how a restaurant can charge $19 (not incl tax or tip) for some farm raised salmon coming with conventional grown veggies. I feel robbed. And there is not one organic option on the menu. We left without eating... Not our kind of place.
Jon H.,"Boca Raton, FL",6,30,8,4.0,7/20/2012,"I see many people posting about the mediocre food. Get over it people. It is Cheesecake Factory. It's a glorified TGIFs... and a small step up from Olive Garden... but also everyone knows this when going there. My food was decent and the service was great. I had a member of my party have too much spice on his steak. Our server, Lindsey, was very accommodating in having the kitchen re-cook one and having the sauce on the side. Great service, Lindsey... Good food, Cheesecake Factory... PS - I hate the fact that I ""have"" to valet my car. I can park in your parking lot by myself."
Shelly J.,"Los Angeles, CA",680,398,105,4.0,11/7/2011,"Their salads are never the healthy options. Go ahead, order it. You'll see what I mean. But you don't go to Cheesecake to eat healthy stuff. You go to indulge *HEART White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake was BOMB! If you like the sweet stuff like I do (and it's realllyyyy sweet) then this is a great pick! Oh, and their patio was really nicely toasty! LOVED that. I hate being cold and was worried about having to stick it out out on the patio (because we had a large group that didn't want to wait longer for inside seating). But no worries! All their heaters are gona keep you warm :)"
Patty O.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,416,,1.0,2/5/2014,"I have eaten here before and enjoyed the ambiance (great view) and the food. There's a huge selection of food & drink so you're bound to find something you will like. I'm basing this rating on a recent phone call to the restaurant. I called to make a reservation for 12 people for lunch on a Friday. After taking all my information, the woman said she had to confirm with the manager that it was ok to take the reservation. So then she comes back to me and said the manager said that they only take group lunch reservations from Mon-Thurs. I know that my same work group has eaten with a reservation for that many people on a Friday so this must be a new policy. Her alternative solution was to come a half an hour early and wait for a table. Well, the whole point of not waiting when you have a big party like that is why we make a reservation. This is a very large restaurant that can easily accommodate parties of 12 without problem. But it's their loss, we will take our business and money to the many other locations who would be happy to have a party of 12 for lunch on a Friday."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,4.0,3/31/2010,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Marina Del Rey by the Catch Club.  Whether you sit inside or outside, it's always a great experience.  In the summer, we always sit outside since it overlooks the water.  The staff are professional and friendly.  The food keeps up the great standards of Cheesecake Factory.  From the drinks to the meals to the deserts, they are all excellent! Been here so much that I've had everything on the menu over time and everything is excellent. Now you wonder why I gave it 4 stars.... They don't allow you to park your own car (forced validation) and since there is no parking around, you have no other choice. The bathroom only has too stalls and it's not clean (always a line). It's a great place for dates and families."
Luu N.,"Culver City, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/3/2015,"The worst restaurant I have ever been. While we enjoyed our desert, the restaurant manager came over and asked us when will we leave.  regardless how sugar coating his language is, he was clear that he wanted us to leave.  No restaurant should ask their guests to leave. It was the most rude, poor hospitality and with utmost contempt to guests.  Not to mention the food was sort of okay."
Mallory R.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,44,1,4.0,1/5/2012,"Whenever I come to The Cheesecake Factory, I usually leave happy due to their good service and good food - WITH ONE EXCEPTION. Recently, I went to The Cheesecake Factory with five other people. Our waitress was named Patricia K. It seemed like she was annoyed with us the whole time she was serving us. She probably didn't make any effort because of the automatic 18 percent gratuity.  She asked if I wanted her to pack my food to go, except I couldn't answer because I was still in the middle of eating when she rudely took my plate away without even waiting for my response. I wish I could have gone to the manager and asked for an adjustment on the tip because she certainly did not deserve 20 bucks."
Alisa A.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,23,,1.0,9/7/2011,"THIS PLACE IS GROSS. READ THIS. THEY MADE 2 BIG MISTAKES WITH MY ORDER!!!!!!!! Wish I can give them a zero. Food: I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Im allergic to peanuts so I said no peanuts on anything. BIG MISTAKE #1: They had peanuts sprinkled all over my plate and it took them another 20 minutes to get my correct order. Eh happened before but I was not happy. Drink: I ordered white wine. What I got was not white wine. BIG MISTAKE #2: YOU WILL LOVE THIS!!!  The server brought this fingerprinted wine glass with something that looks a little muddier than white wine. I asked the waiter what it was and he swears that its white wine.  He obviously does not know what he's talking about.  I brought the glass to the bar and asked the bartender WHAT IS THIS! He looked to the corner of the bar and said ""Sh*t, thats the cup of left over drinks at dinner tables used as a measure to show how much wine we should pour. Your waiter must have grabbed it by mistake."""
Flower ..,"Los Angeles, CA",1,27,39,5.0,7/7/2014,"I always come to this Cheesecake Factory ,it's always pack. I love the view also the playground on the beach. I always have a good time people are nice!  Only thing is the parking ....I hate it other than that my favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurant :)"
Amy A.,"Chandler, AZ",5,26,4,2.0,1/19/2014,"I ALMOST got to eat at The Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Rey this evening, until I found out I would have to pay to park in your own parking lot (valet parking only--we could park ourselves but would still have to pay the same fee). Not Cool. We decided to dine somewhere that we didn't feel like they were trying to squeeze an extra five bucks out of each group to pass through their door. Having eaten at other locations, I know that the food is exceptional, and was looking forward to a nice dining experience, but it was not going to happen this time. I am baffled as to why there was about forty people waiting outside to be seated, when they already had to pay to get in to the parking lot."
Holly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,119,10,4.0,7/4/2014,I usually avoid this location on weekends but was seated right away on a Tuesday night. The food was adequate and my Mojito was quite good. I gave four stars because our server was excellent.  That combined with the view makes it four stars for sure.
Nicole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,1,4.0,10/27/2015,"I love this restaurant and its location. Never had a bad experience and the food is always great. Not a big fan of the valet parking, but I can overlook that since the cheesecake is ""oh, so delicious!"""
Steven H.,"Fairview, OR",13,76,62,5.0,7/3/2014,"I absolutely love this place. Everytime we go here the staff are extremely friendly and attentive. I wish I could eat here all the time. Plus the patio seating is right on the beach, can't get a better view!"
Kyle O.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",90,286,217,3.0,4/12/2014,Great view and it's consistent food as a chain. Outside they have way too many heaters so unless you are really freezing sit inside in the winter or spring because it is warmer outside.  Service is usually pretty bad as we always see be waiters and the hostesses are usually snappy and rude. They should be used to high volumes of people not happy about 45 minute waits for okay food.
Esfandiar B.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,80,120,1.0,11/16/2013,"This Cheesecake Factory experience was so poor and disappointing that I don't think I will ever come back to this location. Especially after trying to give a friendly feedback to Quinn, the manager on duty. However, instead of hearing out what I had to say he just mentioned that they get an ""A"" rating and they are fine... It won't be too long for either Quinn to be fired or this location to be shut down. Too bad!"
Lori T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,4,,2.0,8/23/2015,I wonder why you cannot find prices on their online menu. Picked up food to go - seemed high $ but I'll never know for sure if I got ripped off or not. Wish they would have included the dipping sauce with the Vietnamese Spring Rolls!  The sauce makes these rolls.
Erin L.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",24,20,24,4.0,9/17/2012,"Love the friendly staff here. Really make me feel good when I come in, and when I get takeout. You can since the ""smile"" over the phone:) Great food too!"
Barry B.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,20,,4.0,5/4/2012,"Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite chain restaurants, because i like everything i've tried from their menu.  I also like the ambiance and beach view.  Plus it's close by me. :) I've tried a few items from the menu, but my all time favorite is the ""Miso Salmon"" and this review is for that.  I love seafood and i normally get fried shrimp or crab legs when i go have seafood at restaurants known for their seafood.  Of course Cheesecake Factory doesn't sell crab legs. :(  So therefore I decided to try the Miso Salmon here on a visit a while back and i'm now addicted to it....and can't seem to bring myself to move on to something else on the menu.  The miso glaze gives the salmon a nice semi-sweet taste, but definitely not over bearing.  I would actually recommend this dish to anyone who wants to give seafood a try, and not worry about it tasting fishy. Oh....and if you like Carrot cake, you have to try it here.  Other than the Palm restaurant, i would rate their Carrot cake as my favorite.  My least favorite thing about this location is the tight parking spots the valet guys have to fit your car into."
Ashlyn C.,"Hauppauge, NY",0,43,3,3.0,6/29/2014,"I usually only go to CF when I'm invited (aka, it has never been my first choice.) I've been to ones back home (NY) but this one was different - the view. The food is not much to boast about. I usually get a salad (chicken on the side) and eat the nice bread. There's only valet parking. Make sure you know which turn to take to get to the restaurant or you'll be stuck in the Venice Beach traffic."
Felipe G.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,37,3,4.0,5/22/2014,"Has great beach side seating.. be ready to pay 4.50 valet for dinner time. However, one of the better Cheesecake Factory's around. Sits right next to the Marina, and if you are lucky you can really enjoy it on a nice summer afternoon. Service was excellent. We had the Bellagio Pesto Pasta.. our first time trying that dish out and we walked out happy! We also had the Avocado Rolls.. can never go wrong with those."
