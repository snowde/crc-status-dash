Ashley M.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",585,200,29,4.0,1/26/2012,"I like the Cheese Cake Factory, and this location is very nice with the outdoor seating and gorgeous view of the Marina. Their drinks are GOOD! I had the Bikini Martini and my oh my, it was tasty ;) The food is also good and prepared relatively fast. Of course I have to mention the cheesecake *Banana creme is delicious*  I'm so lucky to live literally 5 minutes away from this place, I'll come back all the time ;)"
'Presence A.,"Santa Monica, CA",654,28,2,4.0,12/5/2013,"Being a organictarian most of the time, I don't eat here that often and I haven't tried any of the dishes that contain meat, but I love the artichoke, both the skinny and the regular one, the side asparagus (which I ask to be made soft, not crunchy) & the skinny Belgian Endive salad with goat cheese (instead of blue cheese). The view is lovely outside, overlooking the Marina and the servers are almost all super-friendly and attentive. I like coming here. I prefer to pay for parking in the public lot just North of the restaurant. Especially since valley parking is a bit on the pricey side and I like the walk along the beach to the restaurant."
Maria L.,"Los Angeles, CA",532,143,21,2.0,7/30/2009,"I came here with my daughter for dinner on a Friday night. The place was very nicely decorated and the host and waitress were both very polite.  Our calamari was good, kind of a small portion but still tasty enough to let that slide. When our meal came I told my daughter to only eat half so we could leave room for dessert. I ordered the Chicken Madeira and ate mostly my mashed potatoes and had 2 bites of  my chicken (this is key info, trust me). We shared the Godiva Chocolate cheesecake and it was sooooooooo good and the Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake Cheesecake  to go. After a good meal with my favorite person we headed out with our to go bags at hand. The mandatory valet parking is $4.00 which I really wasn't too keen on. Once home I could hear the left overs calling me so I figured what the hell, I'm not one to argue with leftovers. As I went to cut into my chicken I came to the horrible discovery that my chicken was raw, yes it was RAW!!!! I could not believe it, I wanted to throw up! how could this happen? WTF?!! I immediately called the manager and explained to him what happened, he said he could not believe it as that dish was one of their signature dishes. I offered to send him a picture, but he said it was not necessary. I received a $20.00 gift card to cover the cost of the dish and an apology letter a few days after, but I am sad to say That I will only use it for cheesecake, i don't think I could eat their food again. If I were rating only the cheesecake I would give this place a five, but because of what happened with my chicken I cannot give it any more than a two rating."
Jeff G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,32,,5.0,4/12/2016,"This is one of The Cheesecake Factory's original locations, and it runs like a well-oiled machine. I visit about once every 1-2 weeks and usually get my food ""to-go"". I get take out from various restaurants most every night of the week, so I am somewhat of an authority on restaurant take-out. The Cheesecake Factory MDR hands-down runs the best take-out operation I have seen anywhere. No matter how busy the restaurant is, and no matter what I order, they food is always ready on time. They can turn out almost anything in 15 minutes or less. So many restaurants completely drop the ball on take-out when they are busy, but not The Cheesecake Factory. The food is also well-packaged, and I have never had a problem with order accuracy. They also have four or five dedicated take-out parking spaces which makes it super-easy to get in and out. I wish more restaurants had take-out operations that rivaled that of The Cheesecake Factory MRD."
Reviewer O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,111,24,1.0,9/13/2013,"Defiantly wont be going to this Cheesecake Factory again.  Parking/Valet: Their lot is so small and there are always lines to get it. Wait time to get a spot can vary up to 2 hours! The valet staff can be a little reckless when driving/parking cars.  Restrooms: Are disgusting! There are puddles on the floor or at the very least a quarter inch of water on the floor, along with some toilet paper and other miscellaneous things.  Food: The portions are really big so one plate will feed 2-4 people. I don't know if I would try anything off the menu, its just not the tastiest food. Note: The menu is a book with way too many options and at least 5 pages. The cheesecake is delicious! Manager: Rude and very disorganized. Overall: I don't plan on coming back to this location and would only do pick up service for the cheesecake."
Vahida K.,"Glendale, CA",54,142,37,4.0,8/6/2012,"LOCATION: Love it! Right on the beach.  Outside seating is so nice (if you end up on a couch seating facing the beach).  Shady and beautiful. GLAMBURGER - OLD FASHIONED HAMBURGER:  Had lunch and wanted a nice burger.  Tasted great - but it is exactly what the name says - ol' fashioned burger.   PINA COLADA:  Totally hit the spot! DOWNSIDE: Very disappointed that the women's bathroom did not have a changing table for babies.  I had to walk around to find a spot on the beach to change my daughter's diaper.  There's obviously plenty of room in the big bathroom, so not sure why they don't have it installed.  What's ironic is the restaurant is right across from the children's playground!!"
Colleen L.,"West Los Angeles, CA",565,601,1889,4.0,8/30/2011,"Tonight's date offered me the choice of Cheesecake Factory or 3rd St. Promenade. The outside patio, recently remodeled warranted a visit.  We sat outside on the lower patio where there were fire pits and tiki torches. The ambience was romantic. We conversed with the reflective view of the water, kept warm by the patio heaters and enjoyed the nice summer evening. He ordered a pear martini which he said was ""potent"". Multiple times he offered me a drink or two.  I declined and had an appetizer plus grilled shishoto peppers. It came with a dipping sauce, perhaps it was ponzu? In the past shishoto peppers at Japanese restaurants before have lit my mouth on fire. For some reason, these were so mild, I could barely detect any spice at all which was unusual.  We mutually parted ways. Not one to valet park, I was relieved to find that my parking was free. I had entered on Panay Way near the Marina Fitness sign on the building. The gate was up when I came in, the meter was not lit up, appeared to be out of order and no one in attendance. Not sure what's happened to the City Of L.A.'s parking lots in MDR, however it worked to my benefit tonight."
Kevin G.,"Dresden, Germany",10,85,,2.0,9/12/2012,"We have been here in July 2012. We really like the Cheesecake Factory and the one in San Francisco was great. But this one here was a bit disappointing. Not the food, the service. The food was great, as always. But the service was so rude! One of us was still eating the main course and she started to ask us for dessert. We told her that we will wait until all are done with the food. 2 minutes later she started again and was telling us which great cheesecakes they have today. My girlfriend was still not ready yet with her food and was really pissed. We told the service that we still wanna wait for her. We all needed a little break because of all the food. 2 minutes later she asked us again.  That is really annoying. If we tell you to wait, so wait, dammit! We told her that we were really disappointed and she started to be rude and told us to order dessert or to pay. So we paid. Fuck off! Was really a great birthday for my girlfriend... Not!"
Ben K.,"Downtown Oakland, Oakland, CA",1,34,3,4.0,10/11/2012,"Food was good, and the outdoor seating is nice too. I've eaten in and had takeout, since I live down the street, both times the food was ready fairly quickly. It can get really busy here, and they pack the tables in tight. Sit outside for a bit more personal space. $5 unavoidable valet parking"
Eric L.,"Monterey Park, CA",92,285,,2.0,7/11/2012,"Good - Wait staff is usually pretty nice. - Some nice views of the water. - Pineapple upside down cheesecake is good. - Breakfast is served all day long. Bad - Expensive prices for mediocre food. - Parking lot is valet only ($4.50 for dinner). - Huge menu with like 200 items. - There's ALWAYS a wait. If you have a large party, good luck. I honestly don't know why people love this place so much....."
Imran N.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,105,14,5.0,2/13/2014,Feeling good? Satisfy your cravings(and not savings) here! Not only you get BOMBASTIC(yes its an actual word) food but also atmosphere for the perfect intimate setting(even if you are single and have no hope you will find it here ;)). I get the Factory Burrito and for dessert Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. Get ready to pull out $20 dollar bills because you ain't going home with them :D
Barry W.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4150,909,1718,4.0,6/14/2009,"*** great spot to take kids, on a sunny day, at lunch ... *** i never realized it until today but there is a playground located adjacent to here, in the sandy beach, on the marina.  there's even table seating outdoors that overlooks this entire area ... the boy loved that ... swings, monkey bars and wading in sea water. the boy shared lunch w/ me then played for an hour. of course i ate my usual meal (below), then added a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of joe ... $20 total. (an add'l $5 for valet)  oh, i'd call this a sweet deal. *** an hour to read a mag in peace, priceless! ***"
Leng L.,"Chino, CA",3,12,24,2.0,8/2/2013,"I love cheesecake factory and this review is solely on the service at this location. The food taste good but service was not good. Our server came to introduce himself and didn't even bother asking us if we wanted something to drink. He wasn't even the one who brought out our food. Nor did he ever come check to see if we needed anything else, no drink refills even had to ask for our bill..never asked us if we wanted cheesecake or dessert either. So we paid and ordered cheesecake to go and the guy that helped us there wasn't nice either. I truly expected better service at cheesecake factory."
Kii F.,"Los Angeles, CA",231,7,2,1.0,8/13/2013,"I am giving this place one star solely due to the valet and I believe the restaurant should do something about them!  I went here last night on a date with my boyfriend and, as usual, we had to valet. I have no problem using a valet and I think it is quite convenient. The valet at the Cheesecake Factory in Manhattan Beach is much more pleasant BTW. After dinner, we both realized we did not have cash. The valet does not take credit cards... this is one of my problems. It is 2013 and accommodating for credit cards is not far-fetched at all. Also, if this is the case, the restaurant should at least have an ATM on hand. However, the valet does not take credit cards and there is no ATM on site. Here is where the valet worker started with his attitude. We simply asked what the option is when people have no cash and he starts yelling about there being an ATM across the street at a liquor store.  After a bit of back and forth trying to figure out where this store was (it was next door around the restaurant), my boyfriend started walking over to the store. I handed over my ticket and after a few seconds I found a $5 bill in my purse. So I figured he would bring the car before the boyfriend would make it to the store anyway and I could pay him and leave. I am waiting alone in the cold at night in a shirt with no sleeves. The man goes over to where the keys are kept and I figure he's getting the car. All this time passes by and still... no car. Even if I was waiting for him to return with cash, they could have brought the car over for me to sit in to the side as I have seen them do before. I ask one of the other attendants where my car is and he just says ""I don't know"" quickly and now takes another two sets of keys from a man that walked out of the restaurant. Their cars come. Mine is still not here. The boyfriend comes back from the store and asks where is the car? I still don't know either. I walk over to them and before I even say anything, the initial man yells ""I am getting it!"" This was so rude and disrespectful. In my attempt to keep my cool, I just shrug it off and say ""well your tip is gone."" My car was finally brought out and now I have to wait behind these other two cars with people who also don't have cash. So I am there for a longer period of time as my car is blocked on both sides. We had such an enjoyable experience in the restaurant with a WONDERFUL waiter and great food. It's unfortunate that the valet is quite the opposite. I will not be returning to this restaurant because of the valet!"
Claudette P.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,6,1,1.0,7/24/2011,"A group of 10 of us went to this location after a memorial service for someone who had committed suicide.  It was an emotional day for all, but we were good sports about waiting 1 hour with a pager for our table.  After the hour, we asked if a table would be available soon and were told it would be another half hour.  45 minutes later we asked again and were told it would be another HOUR.  We waited nearly 2 hours for our table, with a very tired 4 year old in our midst, and got nothing but attitude, anger and annoyance from the hostesses and manager when we asked how much longer the wait would be.  When we told them we were leaving because we were tired and starving, they basically said they couldn't possibly care less, and shrugged their shoulders.  To top it off, we still had to pay $4.50 for the valet.   I will never, ever eat at the Cheesecake Factory again.  Their policy of not taking reservations is rude and demeaning, and I'm going to tell my friends to boycott them as well."
Lola S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,136,7,1.0,5/16/2015,"WILL NOT BE COMING BACK. First you have to PAY to park in the lot, okay whatever , it's stupid but it's like $4.50 or whatever, I'll pay. Then I sit down, the server was SO rude from the beginning. (And I NEVER complain about service). She asked me if she could get anything for me and I asked for sauce for my dry chicken. She half rolled her eyes at me and told me it would take five minutes to make. I said, ""I don't mind"" and she said ""well it's going to take a while so you'll have to wait,"" In a rude manner. WHATTT???? Even my friend saw the situation and thought it was rude. We didn't say anything. 10 minutes pass and no sauce. I ask her again. She says ""she's busy and she will get to it."" No sauce, another 10 minutes, I ask again and she says it's coming out. I KID YOU NOT. My friend was there she saw the whole thing as well. Okay, the manager comes over and asks our table if we need anything. I ask for the sauce, told him I never got it after asking multiple times. He says he will personally get it. 10 minutes pass. No sauce. By this point I'm laughing, so shocked the manager can't even care. I ask a random sweet server for the manager and about my sauce. She goes to THE MANAGER and asks for sauce, he tells her to go back to me and say he forgot and he's getting the sauce. He didn't even come over and apologize, by this time I gave up and was leaving. I didn't even get to eat my food because it was dry and no sauce. As I'm walking away the random server I pulled aside earlier who was nice, came as I was walking away with the sauce.  If it was just my first time at Cheesecake Factory, whatever, but this is my THIRD TIME and EVERY time I've had horrible service. (Once was on my bday and the server made me cry.) Wow. Done."
Heidi P.,"Asheville, NC",7,21,1,4.0,8/16/2011,"New Menu!! Just today they started offering this 'skinnylicious' menu. It has a bunch of small plates, salads and entrees that are from the regular menu, but have some things missing from them that give the dish too much fat, calories or salt. I have the pear and endive chicken salad and it tasted the same as the regular one. I asked the difference and the waiter kindly replied that the dressing was a new recipe. My friend had the Asian chicken salad and the dressing was also a new recipe, but where most of the calories left were in the Wonton crispies. They are not included in the 'skinnylicious' menu option. If you can stay away from eating the free bread, slice of cheesecake and only order from this new menu, you can easily be on a diet and have a lunch with the girls at Cheesecake Factory and not feel guilty."
Slade B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,30,22,3.0,10/18/2013,"Picked up a friend for dinner who recently moved to the area to be closer to his work at LAX. Upon arrival, we were forced to valet park, $4.50 charge. The attendant said self park or valet, you still have to pay the fee. Ripoff.  The dining room was a little crowded so, we decided to self seat in the bar area. Our server arrived promptly to take our drink order and asked about an appetizer before we even opened our menus. I love quick service but, we felt rushed.  We passed on a appetizer because my bud is doing the whole P90X thing so, he's watching his food intake. We ordered our entrees and they arrived quickly. Before we even took our first bite, the server was there like flies on dung, asking how everything turned out. I really didn't have an answer for her, being that my fork was still wrapped in my napkin. I had the orange chicken with brown rice. The chicken alone was delicious. The rice was dry, I had to ask for soy sauce to rehydrate it. Which was a task to get because the server walked passed us about 4 times before I finally grabbed her eye. My bud had the turkey and avocado sandwich, not a crumb was left on his plate so, I'm assuming he liked it. Our server didn't hover, which I appreciate but, after she dropped the check, she was never seen again. I had to walk up to the bar top to have her run our payments. So our experience was meh. Nothing to write home about. With the $4.50+ tip parking charge, I will probably visit other Cheesecake Factory locations that have self parking."
Eshe S.,"Sacramento, CA",14,81,16,4.0,3/2/2014,"Can't comment of the taste or quality of the food, there's wasn't anything I could eat there due to my strict diet. But I can definitely tell you, you'll get your money's worth as far as the proportions go. The plates and the amount of food is massive."
Jonah H.,"Santa Monica, CA",98,77,13,3.0,11/13/2011,"Nice people, fun location, boring but decent food. Here is my problem: the drinks are the weakest you've ever had except for at a luau in hawaii. I got a blackberry martini that tasted like juice. I sent it back and they charged for an extra shot. Altogether it was about $18 for that drink. No thanks. I'm updating this a year later by adding a star. Waiters are very nice. I'm ordering beer now."
