Francis G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",27,62,78,3.0,11/7/2014,"So my friend and I decided we wanted to try this particular restaurant. We sat outside to be able to view the marina and it was real nice. However we weren't too pleased about how crowded the seats and tables are. So many tables practically making it seem instead a party of 2 its a party of 4! You can't have a private conversation. All night I could  hear the couple next to us talk about her friend and her this and that and don't get me started on our waiter. Was it because he was new or nervous or not focused, he forgot to bring our wine and never bothered to ask us if everything was fine or if we would like another glass. We had to ask the guy who brought out our food. Never even asked if we needed anything else. I was so close in not giving him a tip. Zero stars for him. The food however is awesome! I tried the Jamaican black pepper shrimp, it was to die for..alot of flavor with just the right amount of spice...4 stars for the food.."
Sarah M.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/8/2013,"Just tried to put in a carry out order, was put on hold 5 minutes the first time, then again for 4, if I wanted to wait that long I would come in and sit down. I just moved next door and get carry out often. Good job cheesecake, my first and now only attempt to order here."
Lenny H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,13,,1.0,7/27/2013,"I'm a big fan Cheesecake factory but I recently ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken.  It's a stir fry dish served over rice.  Absolutely terrible.  It was just chicken fried with way way too much hoisin sauce.  To top things off, the rice wasn't cooked all the way through.   I should have sent it back, but I didn't want to embarrass the group I was with.  At least the service was excellent.  Don't order the Spicy Cashew Chicken."
Justin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",90,130,401,5.0,7/30/2009,"Happy National Cheesecake Day!! So 5/5 because it was seriously a fantastic meal all around. We got there around 8pm on Thursday Evening and were immediately seated (even though there was quite a crowd, and we were only a party of 2) Within seconds of being seated our waiter came to take our drink orders. We got a Pomegranate Mojito, and a Long Island Ice Tea (top shelf only $1 more). We also got a plate of bread to hold us over until we decided on what to eat. After much thought and consideration (from the gigantic menu) I went with the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with fries and coleslaw, which i had Mashed Potatoes substituted in for (which were just the way i love it, chunky with skins, and red potatoes), and she got Chicken Avocado Club Sandwich. The bbq pulled pork was perfect, tender and thick and the bbq sauce was good. The chicken avocado was HUGE and very tasty. We initially only came for the half price cheesecake so we only ate half our meals and boxed the rest to go. Next came the cheesecake... ohhh the cheesecake... the best part of any meal! We planned on getting 4 slices but unfortunately were only allowed to get 1 per person (sad face). We got the Red Velvet Cheesecake and the Andy's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. The Red Velvet came with slices of red velvet cake between their original cheesecake and cream cheese frosting with white chocolate shavings on the edge. Delicious. The Peanut Butter cheesecake was an orgasm in my mouth. Original Cheesecake swirled with caramel and peanut butter, with pieces of butterfinger and reeses peanut butter cups in layers and peanut butter frosting on top. Orgasmic indeed. Both came with a side of Whipped Cream as well. Our food was out within minutes of us ordering, the cheesecake shortly after, our waiter was very nice and checked up on us often to make sure we were pleased and was very quick with boxing our left overs. Total meal came to just under $60. Overall the only downfall to the entire meal was that Valet Parking was mandatory and that we could only get 1 piece of cheesecake per person, but the experience and food was so good that it doesn't affect our 5/5 star decision. A wonderful evening."
Jewelyn T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1753,849,3199,4.0,5/17/2009,"I probably came to this location atleast 5 times this year since it's close to me. Of course the food is great, well atleast everything I ordered so far. Pastas, sandwiches, soups, salads. Love their anniversary cheesecake... BLUEBERRY! The indoor/outdoor seating overlooking the marina is lovely. cute fireplace. The wait here hasn't been that bad, for the most part, I usually get seated right away. Customer service is a hit or miss. Sometimes its great and sometimes they just seem to forget about you. If you're not sitting in a booth, then you're sitting close to other customers... which sucks.... because you can hear them fighting about which dessert to get. This one lady was fighting with her husband because she wanted the key lime cheesecake and he wanted a chocolate cake. LOL. crack me up. What I don't like about this location is the ""Valet only"". They don't have regular drive and park. So you have to deal w the valet guys and sometimes it's irritating...  Also one time I ordered a pasta dish and they didn't listen to my request and I got something else, so I made them redo my order which sucks when you're hungry. 4 stars for me! love their iced mango drink... I get it everytime!"
Keith S.,"Valencia, CA",2,11,6,4.0,5/29/2012,"Had dinner with family, prior to an international flight at LAX. Made Jizelle our waitress aware of our pending flight.  Wow!  Quick service.  Also had  told manager that were celebrating 2 birthdays.  She  brought a dessert glass each with a birthday song.  Out in 45 minutes. Going to LAX, I was surprised how close it was. GPS bypass the freeway and got us to LAX in no time."
Nicole D.,"Culver City, CA",9,38,4,5.0,3/15/2012,"Easy to love, especially on a sunny Friday afternoon in March. Came here for lunch two weeks in a row and sat out on the patio. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was tranquil, and the food was delicious. I had some flatbread and a skinnylicious Asian Chicken Salad and my beau's mom had the Herb Crusted Salmon Salad. Yum! It ain't cheap, but the portions are large and the ingredients are of high quality. I've eaten here on many occasions and definitely recommend it!"
Penny and Art R.,"Marina del Rey, CA",5,27,2,1.0,8/27/2014,I've been a huge fan & still am except for one thing....their Fish Tacos are horrible! The tacos have so much moisture in them that when you pick them up the single tortilla falls to pieces. This is the SECOND TIME I've ordered them & we told & showed our waiter what happened.  I can understand a flub once in a while BUT a restaurant of this caliber continually delivering something this bad is shocking!!! Whats happening Cheesecake??
Pamala B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",52,9,5,2.0,7/6/2012,"I am very dissatisfied with the service me and my group of friends experienced on our visit. Me and 3 friends went to lunch on Saturday, 6/23/12. Our waiter, Mika, was very kind and pleasant, however, he was also a bit forgetful. He took his break, and introduced our new server, Matt. The only problem is that Matt only took our order for drinks, not our food. We ended up waiting for Mika to come back from his 30 min break to order our food. THEN, as we watch other tables, who arrived after we did, get their food before we did, the food finally arrives another 30 mins later.   The food was great, with the exception of one of my girlfriends. She ordered salad and chicken wings...the problem was that the chicken wings were still RAW in the middle. We asked for the manager, and a gentleman came to our table. I did not get his name unfortunately, but he attempted to tell her that it was a blood vessel that popped during their ""double cooking"" process.   As a mom, and a cook, you know that the blood would be burgundy if the blood vessel popped during the frying, not RED! Thank goodness, he took it off the bill, but we were dissatisfied all together that instead of accepting responsibility, he made it seem as if the chicken was supposed to be that way.  The friend who recomended that we visit this establishment, said that she had pristine service before, so we were all baffled at the mistreatment we received on our visit.   On the plus side, the scenery  and location is breathtaking, but I regret my visit and would not recommend ANYONE to visit this restaurant....if you expect great service."
Tammy M.,"South Bay, CA",399,28,28,1.0,7/9/2013,"Been going here for over 25 years and the service and food keeps getting worse and worse. My fiance and I went the other day and we had 4 different servers waiting on us, the smell at the table was horrific, we had a hair on my fiance's food, they forgot our sodas about 4 times, my salad was made wrong... i could go on and on. I even worked here for 5 years, back in 1993 and it was so much better back then. I live down the street and love to be able to walk here and love the views and outside seating, however the food and service has gone so downhill. When we complained to the manger he offered us cheesecake, after telling him my allergy to Dairy, he insisted still on giving me cheesecake....really? Unbelievable.... needless to say we were very disappointed with the service and disgusted by the food after finding that hair."
Bruce C.,"Santa Maria, CA",1,26,,5.0,6/8/2014,Great place.  Love the CF anyway and this location did not disappoint.  Sat at the bar and had drinks/food and it was awesome.  Bar staff was super friendly.  Just a great night out
Vivian S.,"Venice, CA",1,19,2,1.0,2/8/2016,"Went there yesterday for my daughter's birthday ~ we have always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory. However, we were so disappointed on this visit ~ we were seated quickly and I requested a high chair for my grand daughter, asked for child's menus and told the gentleman that it was my daughter's birthday, 10 minutes later, nothing. No high chair, menus nor had a waitress come to take our drink order. People seated after us had already given their drink orders and one table already had their high chair ~ the situation got worse, 2 meals came out while we waited another 10 minutes for the other 2. It was only after my daughter ordered cheesecake did 2 servers sing her Happy birthday ~ while there had been another table that had a group of 5 servers sing to the birthday person. I felt completely discriminated and disregarded ~ I have never been made to feel this way at any establishment and will NEVER set foot in a Cheesecake Factory restaurant again. To make matters worse yet, 2 of us are suffering from upset stomach aches since..."
Aaron M.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,48,1,1.0,7/24/2014,"There are a couple uncomfortable things you can do when you work in a restaurant that will make not only a bad, but akward experience for a customer. Employees fighting, people that man the phones taking personal calls in front of customers etc. I found out another one last night when My GF and I went to this place around 930 for dinner. It was busy so they quoted a half hour wait but did say there was open seating at the bar...we saw two people get up so we figured if there was a full menu it would do. We sat down and their were two bartenders working, one stocky guy with a beard that was going a mile a minute and a young looking asian girl who was barely doing anything. Took about 10 mins to be acknowledged and then got our drinks placed next to the previous customers dirty plates (asked if he could clear it for us and was met with the response of ""will get to that in one second""). After we got our food we might as well have been invisible, needed a couple of things (tobasco, salt and pepper) and had to ask one of the waiters walking by, he looked annoyed and shouted at the bartender to come over and help us. The thing that made it akward was we kept noticing the girl bartender talking to two other patrons for most of our visit and ignoring pretty much everyone and everything else. We didn't put two and two together till she started EATING off the peoples plate and other employees kept stopping by and saying hi to them. It was then obvious that these were other employees on there off time and the bartender was better served eating with them and talking about how she had gone here and there the night before then making sure we had condiments for our food. This went on for literally the entire hour we were eating, my GF kept looking at me in shock like ""they are really carrying on and we can't even get our card run so we can leave"". Some places do not allow employees to fraternize at work in their off hours, I never agreed with that but there is a fine line where professionalism is lost because you want to BS with your co worker...this is not good practice in the restaurant business. The food was very good, but we got the basic apps and a piece of cheescake (kind of hard to F%$k that up). One star for the food but the rest was as bad as I've seen in a while, unfortunately will probably go back because they do serve food late...will just make sure to sit in the dining room this time."
Steve M.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,173,29,4.0,8/7/2011,"Cheesecake factory is hype on the food, but most definitively not on the cheesecake  Snicker cheesecake puts you in a coma, a good coma... the staff here is always helpfull and ready to make our dinners enjoyable...when tryin new items i ask for honest opinions and they have yet to send me down a path i regret... honestly, one of the most humblest CCF ive ever been too..."
Grant E.,"Saint Louis, MO",4,19,,1.0,6/6/2013,"What a terrible experience.  First off you have to Valet your car and pay for it, in their own lot.  If you self park it is the same price. We went for a friend's birthday and the only good thing was the company.  It was packed on a Wednesday night which was fine.  It all started to go sideways when the hostess sat us and then proceeded to take a fresh, full drink of my friend.  The hostess apologized and offered to replace it but the waiter said he would have to buy another.  It was a Diet Coke for Christ Sakes! Half of the 8 of us did not like our food.  My Carleton (sp?) salad was super bland and the apples in it were tasteless and soggy.   My date had her chicken overcooked and the burrito of my friend was tasteless.  He felt it needed salsa and some flavorings.   When time for dessert came we took the menus and we were all hoping for something better than dinner.  But our waiter never came back to take our dessert and coffee order.  Really?  We waited for 25 minutes and finally asked another waiter to bring our check.   Then our waiter never came to take our money.  After 30 minutes (thank goodness we entertained ourselves talking) I finally had to take the check and my credit card up to the hostess station and told her to run my credit card.   Now we don't mind paying 18% gratuity  because we were a large party but please, at least work for it and offer to take our dessert and coffee order.  That alone would have added another $100 to our bill and another $18.00 in his pocket."
Toma C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1042,4186,5.0,5/5/2013,"SIt outside!!  This is one of my favorite Cheesecake factory.  Even though this is a chain rest.  I love this place. The outside dining is perfect, the wait can be long on the weekends.  My favorites here are the Shrimp Bistro pasta, The belagio chicken and the sweet corn tamales...  Of course all the cheeesecakes,and the tiirmisu too!"
GG M.,"Los Angeles, CA",83,684,140,3.0,4/2/2012,"The warner center and grove location both have better tasting food and menu IMO. But, pussy-whipped into bringing in-laws here. Orders: Nacho appetizer=gigantic, but not enough salsa, or even close. If they paid a bit more attention to this dish it would be great. Chips are crisp and hot, cheese could be better distributed across nachos. Chicken Bellagio=ridiculous amounts of sodium. Basil pasta underneath so salty that youre better off skipping that part, heavy salty buttery cream sauce. If I was 1/2 my age no prob, but hard to digest for a 37 year old. Chicken lightly breaded and tasted good. They put 2 slices of prosciutto, I'll eat that with anything! And top it with aragula, kinda gets owned by the cream sauce and heat of the plate. Fried shrimp and fries=you order this your asking for it, wivey had it and it vas very ""Gordon's fish"" like. Cole slaw was gross and tasted raw/unwashed/like dirt/you get da picture. Pizzas=decent, good cheese, toppings, crust.  Service=changed 3 servers by the time we decided on a right table, but good overall. Very ho-hum place. You eat one meal here at 1pm and you dont need to worry about food before, during, or after, anytime until you wake up the next morning with garlic dragon breath, no matter how many times you brush/rinse/floss. Benihana, which isnt at all gourmet food these days, still abetter option IMO, but no view."
Lori R.,"San Pedro, CA",123,20,,2.0,3/1/2013,"It pains me to write this review. My husband and I had our first date here 16 years ago and try to get back every year or so on that anniversary. We've always loved the food, although every time we go they've removed another item we like from the menu. There is now only one item left of our favorites. Because there always such a long wait for a table, we arrived mid-afternoon, hoping they would be less crouded. It was. We walked right in, only to find the hostess station un-manned. We waited a few minutes but no one showed up. We looked to the bakery immediately behind us hoping to ask for help there, but it was un-manned as well. After about 10 minutes someone showed up and we were seated. As the hostess sat us down, she explained that we might have a longer than normal wait, as the waitress was busy. I looked around the dining room and realized that all the patrons were seated together in one section. This made me wonder if they were short staffed. A great way to start our anniversary meal. Service was indeed slow. While ordering, I asked about one dish - herb encrusted salmon. Our waitress described it to me and I ordered it. When it came, it was far from the menu description or what the server told me. I didn't want to make my husband wait so I didn't send it back, but it was disappointing. Then, with our cheesecake, I wanted a cappachino. I asked our server if it was strong or whether I should add a shot of espresso to make it that way. She assured me it was very strong and only Italian men needed the extra shot. The coffee arrived so weak it looked like a few spoonfuls of coffee added to a glass of milk. Worse, it was barely lukewarm. I tried to get her attention before she walked away, but could not. It took quite awhile to get the attention of ANY server. We waited quite awhile for the replacement coffee, which wasn't much better. I didn't send it back, because we were waiting to eat our dessert. Even though they knew I was unhappy with the coffee twice, they did not offer to take it off our bill.  They have some good items on the menu, but the poor service just isn't worth it any more. As we got it the car, my husband looked to me and said, ""I guess we'll have to find another place to celebrate this anniversary starting next year."""
Kristi O.,"Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",7,26,14,5.0,2/13/2014,Walked from the mariott with my family for dinner. Immediately seated on the deck. There were heaters and prompt service. We shared a great appetizer and then our entrees. They were fresh and tasty. This is a great location overlooking the marina. It was a great evening. Highly recommend
Trang H.,"Marina del Rey, CA",32,156,133,3.0,1/4/2014,"The view can't be beat. Not crazy about the valet parking. Food is standard CF fare. I would opt for the outdoor seating if available and the weather is right. Takeout option is quick and easy, but be sure to park in the To Go area."
