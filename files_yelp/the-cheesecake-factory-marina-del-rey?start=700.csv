Diana C.,"Culver City, CA",133,36,,5.0,7/25/2011,"I suppose you can call me somewhat of a Cheesecake Factory connoisseur. I have been coming here for years and I love it! It was actually my new year's resolution one year to try every single cheesecake they had and what do you know, it was the only new year's resolution I have ever kept! My favorite cheesecake, white chocolate caramel latte, was actually gotten rid of, so my new favorites are pumpkin pecan, red velvet, or the tuxedo. You really can't go wrong with any cheesecake though, or any of their other cakes. (I love the Chocolate Truffle Cake the most) The food there rarely lets me down too. I've had most of their appetizers and my top picks are the fried macncheese balls, the avocado rolls, the spinach and cheese dip, the buffalo blasts, or the firecracker salmon rolls. Out of their pastas, I love the four-cheese pasta, the carbonara, or the farfalle with chicken and garlic. Their salads are amazing too, I usually never order salads when I go out because I never feel like its really that satisfying, but at the cheesecake factory, they are tasty enough as a meal and definitely fill me up, especially the BBQ chicken or the luau salad. Their burgers are always a solid choice too. The only things I've gotten there that I wouldnt get again are the fish and chips, which I thought were bland, and the belgium waffle, which was just like any other belgium waffle.  Anddd of course, I can't forget about the amazing bread they start you off with! Lets just say its a struggle for me to not fill up on the bread :P I love how the taste (and portions) of the dishes are the same at every Cheesecake factory. It never fails me. The only downside is that I'm practically holding my stomach in pain and can barely stand up after a meal here. And I'm probably swiping a few days off my life with all the calories i'm inhaling... oh well! Its definitely worth it!!! =]"
Mel G.,"Tucson, AZ",131,1891,,4.0,9/24/2011,"What can I say -- I love the Cheesecake Factory.  In particular, I really love the location of this one.  It's perched right on the marina, and is beautiful.  Going here for lunchtime is fantastic -- usually no wait, and plenty of outdoor seating.  Dinner time seems to be much more crowded here, with good reason -- it's a fantastic place to go.  Gotta try the peach bellinis. :-)"
Kellie F.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,180,100,4.0,6/29/2011,"Well, what can I say about the Cheesecake Factory... Portions are very generous (enough to usually split a meal), and the food it good. Not amazing. But good. Service has also always been very decent.  But at this location, it's not really about the food - it's about the outside patio. The patio is a lovely spot to have lunch. Beautiful view of the marina, and when you're sitting outside, it doesn't feel like you are dining at a large chain restaurant.  On colder days they have heaters, and on the hotter days, they have umbrellas, so the temperature is usually pretty great. Seating is a little tight (they really use up all the space possible) so be ready to squeeze around tables. Take your mom here for lunch and buy her one of those adult pink lemonades. Then after lunch stroll around the little beach area to walk off that huge meal you just ate. Makes for a great little Sunday afternoon."
Jon N.,"Valparaiso, IN",372,207,2,3.0,11/14/2011,"Here's the deal with the Cheesecake Factory... this is true not just of the Marina restaurant but also the ones in Brea or Pasadena as well. There are some items on the menu that I really like! Some of my favorites are the Pasta Jambalaya, Memphis Burger, and the Chicken Madeira. With places like the Cheesecake Factory, once you find something you like I guess you keep ordering it. I'm sorry but some things on the menu don't sound good at all. Like all chains they keep weeding out those items that don't sell.  Our favorite cheesecake quickly became our least favorite cheesecake once they changed the recipe. We used to order the carmel cheesecake all the time until they changed it for some reason. Now we order the red velvet cheesecake. Simply to die for. Literally to die for because it's so full of calories and other stuff that clogs arteries and cuts down on life span. We have to split it. Oh well, that's the price one has to pay if one wants to splurge a bit.  I usually find the atmosphere and the service pretty good. I will always return... just not as frequent as I used to and most always with a gift card that someone has given us."
Julia K.,"Arcadia, CA",7,32,53,4.0,7/17/2013,"I usually don't write reviews in general, especially for chain restaurants but this one impressed me. It has a nice view of the water and the food was good. We started with the tropical margarita and the avocado eggroll appetizer per waitress' request. That was probably the best part of the meal. I got the herb crusted salmon which like a typical salmon dish and my date got a filet mignon (it was ok also). We ended the night with tiramisu cake (not the cheesecake) and that was really creamy and delicious. There is also a walkway from the cheesecake factory parking lot if you want to walk with your date after eating."
Anthony B.,"Temple City, CA",29,171,197,2.0,2/29/2012,"It's the cheesiest Note: worst coffee ever. Burnt tasting with a gritty texture, but then again they aren't known for their coffee.  Food was on par with other Cheesecake restaurants that I've visited."
Nancy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,24,,2.0,9/23/2013,"Carry-out service stinks.  The food is way less well prepared than when you eat there, which is at best just a cut above mediocre anyway - with a few exceptions that are well done.  But if you order those same dishes to-go, they clearly don't put any energy into them.  They also forget to give you dressings and sauces that go along with the food.   Dining out on the patio is redeeming, but mostly because of the location on the Marina."
Caesar M.,"Lynwood, CA",8,18,15,4.0,2/8/2011,"Dude, why is there valet parking.... YOU HAVE PLENTY OF PARKING. I literally knew where my car was and the parking was not packed. I don't know about you, but I am very picky about who gets to drive my car. Anyways... Food is always awesome. Had the cajun shrimp pasta and the original cheesecake.  Very nice atmosphere. Highly recommended. But can get a little pricey. But it is worth it."
Rawhide W.,"Austin, TX",496,627,1599,3.0,10/29/2011,"What can i say.... It's the Cheesecake Factory....COMMERCIAL food. However, the Sante Fe Chicken salad is/was my favorite. The consistency varies by location. It can be hit or miss. Menu is large with all the high calorie fattening dishes. LOUD and always packed with a full bar. I actually heard one woman make the following statement. ""there's too much artichoke in the artichoke dip""  ROFL..... I really thought she was kidding but she wasn't. Cheesecake's are great."
Julie R.,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",90,102,68,5.0,8/18/2011,"Hosted a friend's bridal shower here and...WOW!  I just need to extend my gratitude once again for the amazing job the manager Quinn and his staff provided for us, especially Steve!   They truly made this a memorable event.  Everyone had a great time and everything ended very smoothly.  The professionalism and kindness is incomparable!  I did hear about this man that had made some complaints about the noise.  Actually it was interesting many strangers at the valet said they were happy we had such a great time, but that man was upset.  It's unfortunate that people have to be negative like that, especially when his wife clearly wanted to join our party and never asked to be moved with a couple of other parties happening around at the same time.  It's already a loud restaurant.  I think he just wanted something to complain about...what a lame-o."
celeste j.,"Sun Valley, CA",26,12,,2.0,8/30/2011,"While admittedly the food at the Cheesecake Factory is amazing, the service & consideration is below par.  We went for my birthday on Sunday. Our 30-45 min wait was over 1 hour. Our buzzer didn't go off, they claimed to have come outside & called us, but during the hour I was outside the door, no staff EVER poked their head out.  Once we were finally seated, the hostess & the server both offered bread, which neither ever brought. They did get the kid's food order in & out quickly, but the Mac & Cheese was as hot as lava & they were starving given the long wait.  The coup de gras, was a bird pooping in my hair as we were wrapping up. Admittedly that's not the Cheesecake Factory's fault, but I think it speaks to our experience."
Johanna A.,"Bell, CA",64,83,18,5.0,8/14/2013,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this cheesecake factory, the location is perfect and very relaxing for a friends day out, night out or an evening date :). I love the staff here ive never experienced bad service, they are all very helpful, always a smile on their face. The food is delicious of course, excellent selection, plus i love the fact that they often edit their menu options, adding new delicious entrees and desserts, and omitting the not-so good ones. Order the tuna tartare and beet salad both really good!"
Raffi G.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,106,13,4.0,2/8/2014,"Had so much food there, took left overs home. Huge menu, a lot of choices for every taste. Great service. Amazing quality of food. It was a good experience as every other time. Thank you"
Mike D.,"North Hollywood, CA",221,87,47,1.0,11/24/2010,"I don't even like cheesecake, but since I was already here for a friend's birthday I figured ""when in Rome..."" The first cheesecake I wanted was sold out. And the second. And the third. And the fourth. I literally ended up with a piece of chocolate cake. How stupid! And it wasn't even good. Garbage, don't go here."
Vanessa C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,4.0,9/2/2014,"The food here is great!!!! I absolutely loved my chicken pasta dish and our strawberry cheesecake desert. The cheesecake here is always to die for. Our poor waiter looked a little stressed out, overworked and very hot but overall it was great experience. I loved being able to take a walk on the Marina beach after. The atmosphere is incomparable and hard to beat."
michelle h.,"Oakland, CA",30,202,180,4.0,10/11/2011,"Good food like always, good service. For some reason, the caesar salad I ordered was so so so good!! Lol it was like the best I ever ate! maybe i was too hungry? but it was oh soo yummy"
R S.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,67,55,5.0,3/3/2014,"Since Killer Shrimp didn't work out, I went to this place and BRAVO! Excellent fast service. Excellent food! Thank you, Mike for saving my birthday & being so friendly!"
Josh C.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/7/2015,"Service was Phenomenal!!!! We had a great time and the food was just crazy good. We live by Torrance, Ca and this one beats the one in Redondo by far. The food is amazing, the scenery is beautiful to be on the marina. Every time where are out here we always stop by!"
Emma J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,4.0,2/12/2012,"I love the plain cheesecake here with strawberries on top.  There are tons of innovative flavors, but the classic is definitely the best.  My other favorite dish is the hot spinach artichoke dip - it is practically a meal in itself. This is a really nice location with lots of seating overlooking the marina.  I would probably come here just for the atmosphere and view even if I didn't love the food. Parking is a bit annoying - you have the option of valet parking or self-parking for the same price, but the lot is crowded and you park in the same place as the valeted cars so it is weird to self-park."
Kathy W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",213,545,113,4.0,6/20/2011,"Gorgeous day for a lazy, late Sunday lunch.  Despite the restaurant being full, we were seated immediately on the patio.  Our server, Steven, was very personable and attentive.  We both enjoyed our meals (pan-seared salmon, Thai chicken pasta) and the passionfruit infused unsweetened tea.  Loved the view of the marina; wish we could have lingered longer...."
