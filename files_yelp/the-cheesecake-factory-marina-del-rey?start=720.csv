ED D.,"Rockwell, AR",113,241,115,4.0,10/21/2013,This place is busy. They always have good portions of food and the drinks are par. The outdoor seating is amazing.
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,4.0,8/15/2011,Came here to have lunch with my cousins and we were seated promptly outside facing the beach. It was such a wonderful day and view!  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that was delicious and flavorful. Service was a little spotty as our server looked like he was over his head with tables. I'm only taking a star away due to the valet parking. It's bad enough that you are forced to do it but worse when they charge for it.
Claire M.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,85,14,2.0,8/24/2011,"I'm really not a fan of this particular Cheesecake Factory. I mean don't get me wrong, the waitstaff was really nice, the outside area was nice and not too noisy. But the food was really poor in my opinion. My father and I had two different pastas, I had the Alfredo and he had some Cajun pasta dish. The Alfredo was very bland and the Cajun pasta had way too much spice. My mom ordered the catfish and was okay with it.  The only reason I would come back here is for the waitstaff but they seriously are nice, however it is kind of a long wait for the food."
Tiffany J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,31,46,5.0,8/27/2015,"This location is AMAZING!! We went for a kid-free date night and I couldn't have asked for better. It was busy but we only ended up waiting 20 minutes for an outdoor table and we got to walk on the sand while we waited. We were seated on the top deck right on the edge with an amazing view of the marina!! They had the patio heaters on which felt amazing, the waitress we had was great, food was amazing, and lights and ambiance was phenomenal. Very romantic dinner at our favorite restaurants. Don't think I would ever want to go to a different location after visiting this one. The only thing I could say about this restaurant is that they put the tables a little too close together which is annoying because you end up having to listen to the entire conversation of the table next to you. We actually requested to move from our original table because the people next to us were talking very loudly and in a foreign language and it was beyond bugging me but the restaurant moved us without issue and we got a much better table."
Tristan C.,"Beaverton, OR",14,15,,4.0,4/7/2013,"It's hard to do wrong at the Cheesecake Factory. Honestly, the menu is a book, so if you don't like something, you can always order something else next time. That said, the service is what makes or breaks a location, and the service at this location is amazing, at least when you have Delisa (spelling?) as a server.  We shared servings of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (at Delisa's recommendation, but only available during Sunday brunch) and the California Omelet. Both were delicious, but the pancakes were fluffy, and almost creamy. I know that's weird for a pancake, but it gave a nice tangy flavor along with fluff - amazing.  The omelette, while yummy, was relatively basic. The real star of that dish was the potatoes we got on the side. I know that sounds silly, but they were perfect. Another yummy thing we has was their espresso, which was well made and sweet. One thing that could VASTLY improve this location is their mandatory valet. You shouldn't HAVE to use valet at a Cheesecake Factory. This adds about $5 dollars (cost plus expected tip) to your total."
Bob J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,2,1.0,5/10/2014,"This place can not get even zero star , service is awful , beautiful view and patio but the table are so close to each other that you think you are sitting in air plane , you have to beg them to turn the heather , the food is not fresh that it used tobe  , I am not going back for sure  , I think  we should not support the big businesses any more because they are so big now that they don't care about their customer."
Brock S.,"Malibu, CA",3,30,5,4.0,11/29/2011,"I should disclose that I love every Cheesecake Factory in the world. It's my #1 chain all-American restaurant, so this review is biased. That said, the seating indoors here sucks, unless you can get a stand alone booth. The patios, on the other hand, are awesome. If you're a tourist, want a nice view of the Marina, and know there's something on the menu you'll like, I suggest checking it out. The lower section is really nice, but the menu down there is limited so I don't go down there very often as they don't have the Cajun Chicken Little's on that menu (best chicken tenders in the world, don't argue). Parking? Completely sucks. You shouldn't have to $5 valet at the CCF. We usually walk to our car and hand the valet the ticket since it's faster to do that then stand and wait for them to walk twenty feet to grab your car for you. SIlly. Park in the lot across from it and you can save $4 plus get your car faster."
Jean J.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,158,706,3.0,6/18/2011,"Ah.... EVERYONE's date spot. Incredible view... and consistent food. The bar area is a bit small but that's fine. The wait time can be an hour depending on what time you go -- especially during the peak times (Friday night, weekends, etc.) You have the option to sit inside or out (I recommend outside in the evenings because it can get rather loud inside.)"
Wellington H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,43,,4.0,9/20/2013,"Great location, food and service. It is my go to place to bring family from out of town. As this is a chain, you won't get anything too edgy, but that's a good thing when you have picky eaters. The menu is massive and there's bound to be something for everyone."
harold b.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,66,4,4.0,7/6/2013,This spot is still my fav go-to spot! There is no street parking only valet.  Try the bloody mary!!
Roberto L.,"Los Angeles, CA",35,6,11,3.0,10/27/2013,"The key lime cheesecake is the best dessert I have tried in a while, that's what keep me coming back to this restaurant.  Last time I was there I went for dinner, I arrived around 10 minutes before closing down and they were out of bread.  This was quite surprising because if they keep letting people in 5 or 10 minutes before closing down they should offer a full dinner.  I mean, this is the CCF I expected the same service, despite the time or the day.  I had chicken romano and it was quite good - like usual but again the bread issue ruined the dinner."
Crystal M.,"Montebello, CA",2,14,,4.0,11/9/2014,"My experience at this Cheesecake Factory was so great that I had to write my first yelp! It started off really awful because I was misinformed on how long it would take our party of 30 to be seated for my fiancé's birthday dinner (I tried making reservations earlier in the week but they don't take reservations on weekends). I had been told that if I got there at 530p ahead of the party, that we could be seated at 7p when the rest of the party was to arrive.  When I got there around 550p I was told differently. The manager, Chris, came over to me and explained the situation. Even though he couldn't change the amount of time it would take to be seated inside the restaurant (2 hours from the moment the whole party had arrived! Since guest were to arrive at 7, that meant 9p!) he did offer a solution. He was able to open up a space on the water called the beachfront seating. He lit up the firepit, opened the side curtains of a big booth, and turned on the heat lamps to make the area more inviting as it was currently not being used due to the season (fall is upon us). When the guests arrived at 7p everyone was pleasantly surprised with the pretty view on the water. We didn't have a waiter and had to order our food at the bar or to go (which we then took outside to eat) but everyone had somewhere to sit and food to eat. Chris was very attentive throughout the night making sure we were taken care of. The manager also came out himself and sang the birthday boy happy birthday!"
Arleen P.,"Los Angeles, CA",232,99,17,4.0,5/31/2011,"Although this place is often uncomfortably crowded and can be a pain in the booty, I still come back....Although I'm pretty sure my fam is over it. Anyway, I'm a cheesecake lover, and although the menu has a great variety of food (some may say too much variety), I've been stuck on the Louisiana Chicken Pasta for a few years now.   And when it comes to the cheesecake?  Don't get me started.  I'm pretty sure you can't make a bad decision here, although you will have your favorites.  The Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple, Vanilla Bean, Dulce De Leche, and Cookie Dough cheesecakes are amongst my fave.  They have plenty of cocktails as well.  Their mojitos are pretty delicious, particularly the pomegranate one.  There's a Cheesecake Factory all over the place, and while a little pricey, it's still delish.   If you are coming here with a group, DEFINITELY come early and be prepared to WAIT.  They don't take reservations.  Normally at lunch time, it will be easier to  get a table.  There's my lil tip."
Angelo V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/26/2012,"This place is super! If you haven't visited, you are missing out. here's some free cash to try it out. "
Frank D.,"South Pasadena, CA",14,111,1,4.0,6/13/2011,"What a view!!! Sit outside to see the Marina. Wow.  Service is also good and staff is more than friendly. This is why this is my favorite restaurant chain, food is good and quality is excellent. Just get in a cardio session before you come so you don't feel guilty."
Caitlyn C.,"Avalon, CA",38,5,7,4.0,8/23/2011,"I had the Nutty Marshmallow spiked milkshake. It was AWESOME with little chunks of marshmallows in it. Both of our pasta dishes were tasty too - Jambalaya and Louisiana Chicken. Kandace was our server and was awesome too.  Valet parking is mandatory and cost us $4.50 for an hour. Not too bad for valet parking, but we did have to wait a bit for our car at the end of the night - probably 10 to 15 mins as there were a lot of people waiting in front of us."
Shauna R.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,155,37,2.0,12/18/2010,"One of the few cheesecakes I go to ONLY if people are visiting and only one in a 15 mile radius.  Otherwise, I stay away from this place at all cost.  Not sure where to start but I'l give it a try. 1) Why is it valet parking is like 5 bucks and I don't think there is validation or it matters....yet when the parking lot is empty and you can practically park yourself, you still are stuck paying the valet to park your car.  LAME. 2) Moving on into the restaurant, the layout is just horrible.  The entrance that is and then when the weather is nice, the tables are squished together to get as many people into that place as possible.  3) Service: The servers are not the brightest tool in the shade.  Many are rude and pushy.  More short with the customers if they take too long to decide on their order.   4) Air conditioner is always pitched up no matter what season it is.  Just because it is socal, why is it always feel like it's about 60 degrees in there?   5) I ordered a simple salad and even that came wrong and I waited another 45 minutes for them to bring me the right order.  The rest of the dining party was waiting for me to finish.  Ridiculous I tell you.  Also, many of the servers were unprofessional talking about how much tip they were getting from the customers as they walked out (and we walked to our table)....whatever happened to appropriate dining etiquette and serving etiquette?  The managers need to do some serious training at that location. If you're close and craving to eat at cheesecake, don't go to this one.  Find a different one to eat at."
Judy L.,"San Diego, CA",10,126,,1.0,7/26/2012,"I hate this Cheesecake Factory. Hate it. And usually, it takes very little to satisfy me, so this location just sucks. I'm not deluding myself, this is a CHEESECAKE factory. Where there be a Westfield Mall, there shall be one! ... So I'm not expecting 5 star dining or anything, just my usual standard fare. The first thing --- Valet parking ONLY. Wtf? What if I want to park the car myself? It also takes longer to get my car through valet than just walking out the door onto the lot. The fact that you have to pay $4.50 for the service as well is just a slap in the face. Sure, maybe for many in this area, $4.50 is chump change but I just hate that is was mandatory! It was $4.50 for dinner, from what I read, lunch valet is cheaper. We went on a Sunday evening. We were driving back from San Pedro and we were starving! Our options were the Redondo Beach location or this one, else wait for the long drive back to Thousand Oaks and eat there (we couldn't wait). We asked for a table for two inside, were told 30mins, took a pager but found a table at the bar and as we were sitting, our pager buzzed. Huh? Why tell us 30mins? It didn't matter either way because we were fine with the bar table but we had sat and then had to get up and wait 5mins to be seated again. Our server and service were minimal. We weren't dressed to impress, that's for sure, since we were on Catalina Island for most part of the day. I wonder if that was why? We got what we needed I guess ... just took a little bit of a wait. I ALWAYS order a side of sweet potato fries for an appetizer (sometimes as my meal, but shhhh). I always order it right away, because a kid at heart is an impatient one. We also ordered the factory burrito to share, sans the chicken. We did ask for extra wheat bread and got that while we waited a long time for the fries. And when it finally came, it was half the portion size that we normally get at any of the cheesecake factories we normally attend. I was kind of dismayed, I waited all day for these! Oh well. But not only that, it was missing the usual spicy garlic aoili or whatever they call it. I've been there enough times to know that it's not a thing where only one restaurant serves it a certain way ... so we asked for it and the server (another) basically was like ""no, we have a garlic aoili but it does not go with that"" and we were like uhhh ... can we have it? Didn't taste exactly like it though so we were disappointed. I know that people probably don't order that side as often but he was basically saying it like ""uh no you're wrong"" and I don't like that :( especially when it's about my unhealthy obsession (in more ways than one) with the sweet potato fries. Our factory burrito was worse ... Usually it's huge! This one was tiny and it was lacking that sauce it normally comes with, in which it definitely needed as well! Inside there is just white rice and vegetables and so there's no liquid and without that sauce it's kind of difficult to eat. I wasn't too happy about that ... We'd had a long day and so it was just a disappointing meal! It was my birthday and so I did get a birthday Sundae but asked them not to sing when they came up to the table. I was not feeling it. But it was really sweet that one of the waiters was like ""but we're already here!"" but whispered behind his band ""happy birthday!"" quietly. So that was good.  Overall my experience sucked. Service could have been better. I just wanted yummy fries :("
Weezie R.,"Culver City, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/17/2012,"The view is always beautiful at this location and there's a nearby playground for kids to go to which is always good when stir crazy kids need to leave the restaurant.  Food is pretty good too. But everytime we've gone for a family Sunday brunch, I'm always dissappointed.  Either there is a really long wait to get a table or it takes a really long time to get food  served to our table.  The whole process always seems incredibly disorganized when wait staff that didn't take your order attempts to deliver food to your table.   This last time, a server screwed up our order two times, and instead of trying to fix the problem, got angry with me and ""informed"" me of what I had ordered.  She was incredibly rude and made a bit of scene. Most of the people at my table felt sorry for me and with one joking that I had gotten assalted.  I've been eating out in LA for the past 30 years and this is hands down the worst service from a server that I have ever had.    Although she checked with our table several times after and tried engaging in small talk, the damage done by her extremely unprofessional and almost hostile attitude was beyond repair."
Vince V.,"Carlsbad, CA",200,496,89,4.0,6/5/2010,"Why are there so many haters on this Cheesecake Factory? I remember when this one opened nearly 10 years ago, when I lived on Manchester. (Remember the doughnut shop?!)  The food/drinks/happyhour: excellent.  You can stroll out after dinner/drinks with a friend....haha Valet parking is mandatory, but $5 inc. tip is cheap.  Strange situation: Friend pulls up her 2010 Lexus GS350 to valet, about 2 hours later, we pick up the car, and valet says there's no power steering.  ? Very strange, no one is implying anything, but it happened. Just sayen'."
