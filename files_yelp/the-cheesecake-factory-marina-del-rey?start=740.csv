Chandler M.,"Houston, TX",91,283,10,5.0,4/28/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is my family's de facto spot for any occasion thats celebration-worthy. Everything I've ever had on the constantly-changing menu has been good, from my personal favorite the Chicken Costoletta down to the BBQ ribs, various pizzas, and all the appetizers. The Cajun Jambalaya is amazing, as are the burgers.  The lemonades they offer are staggeringly sharp if you aren't careful; I've had to get a separate glass of water to dilute my raspberry lemonade. very thick and uses natural flavors (not minute maid!). The alcoholic drinks are perfectly balanced 95% of the time.  The scenery of this place; it's outlook over the marina and a small beach you can walk down after lunch or dinner in the mild Los Angeles weather...it's just fantastic.  I don't even need to get into the desserts to give this place a 5-star rating."
Kimmy M.,"Venice, CA",8,13,,5.0,11/9/2013,"favorites: ask for all brown bread and skip the white sweet corn tamale cakes, avocado egg rolls, spinach and cheese dip apps fettucine with sundried tomatoes (i lose the chicken) RED VELVET CHEESECAKE and HOT CHOCOLATE one can never go wrong at the cheesecake factory. the marina del rey location is beautiful and the staff are wonderful. it can get crazy busy so either go early or get your order to go."

R H.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,32,1,5.0,9/8/2013,"Okay ... so I've been going to Cheesecake Factory for many years now ... and quite frequently too ... once every 2 to 3 weeks ... so you can see I am a fan.  Never bothered to write a review in all these years.  So what prompted me to write this review, you might ask ... well, it was the blunder they made with my last dine-in order.  Blunder? ... and still 5 stars? well, yes ... I think they deserve it. My wife and I went for a dinner last week.  Everything from waiting to seating to order-taking to appetizer service was going well ... till our entrees arrived.  Chicken Bellagio  is originally served with prosciutto.  I don't eat pork so I specifically asked for NO prosciutto.  In fact, although I have Cheesecake Factory's gigantic menu pretty much all memorized, and although I know what menu items have pork and cooking alcohol in them, as a matter of habit, I always mention my waiter that I don't eat pork and can't have any alcohol, so if I order an item that contains either pork or alcohol, please caution me.  That night was no exception. When the dish was served, there was this big slice of prosciutto on top.  When I mentioned that I ordered it without prosciutto, the girl who brought out the food took it right back and told me that they will quickly prepare it again.  Seconds later our waiter was there apologizing and a minute later the manager was at our table side apologizing and offering chowder while I waited for the dish to be prepared again, not knowing that we had already ordered chowder earlier (and it was delicious). Now I can see all this when a customer is visibly upset or loud, but I was neither upset nor did I complain loudly.  I was, for some reason, simply in too good a mood to let anything this small ruin it. I have always enjoyed their food, which I must mention, is always plentiful, and I have always admired their excellent service ... and I look forward to being their customer for a long time. They didn't comp me for the dish.  They didn't comp the dessert either (a slice of tiramisu cheesecake) that my wife and I shared, which I find slightly surprising.  But they still get 5 stars from me for both food and service. PS: I am disappointed on closure of their Brentwood location.  I never dined there but picked up food from there as take-out almost on a weekly basis."
Mark P.,"Temecula, CA",17,271,11,4.0,5/5/2011,"Great location overlooking the harbor.  It has a lot of outside seating, but both times I ate there I sat inside. Service was good.  On my first visit we had a large group and they handled us smoothly.  Within the same week I took my family in and the service was again solid...even with a new waiter.  They had a little trouble getting folks seated once they called us, but we ended up with a seat but all was good. Food was good.  It seems they are all consistant.  Don't get the Buffalo Chicken appetizer, it had no meat and a lot of fried dough.  Quality is always excellent. Great location, especially when you are staying at the Marriott."
Candice D.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,37,5,1.0,4/30/2010,"Went here for lunch, knowing full well I should have kept driving down the street to Cafe Del Rey...but did I listen to myself? No, of course not.  First off, valet is $3.50---miss me with that. Secondly, I gave this place another chance, even though I always have bad luck all of there locations. I ordered from the bar, and I should have known cuz dude had no idea what I was talkin about. All I asked for was a lunch size Cobb Salad, I didn't want it tossed (for some reason they like to toss their Cobb salads which is just stupid anyway), and dressing on the side. Not too difficult?  Obviously it was, because minutes later he came back and asked if I wanted dressing on 1 half and the other half dry???? WTF was he talking about? I just want dressing on the side. So, he comes back with my food.  1. The salad was tossed. 2. He brought me 2!!!! I had to walk out on that one. Cuz he blew my mind. It's not that difficult. A Cobb Salad with dressing on the side...easy. I ended up leaving and going to Cafe Del Rey where I always have a nice time. PS...I had a flash back of why I knew I needed to request that the salad need not be tossed. I ordered one before and it was horrid, ice berg lettuce, not mixed greens like the menu says, the chicken is damn near raw and un-seasoned. They mix everything together, even the dressing, it looks like someone mixed the salad, ate it, and they transferred it to semi clean plate.  If you haven't picked up on it yet, I F'ing hate this place with a passion."
Miguel G.,"Sylmar, CA",6,94,,3.0,5/26/2013,"Nice view when dining outside !!! Good drinks and I love their chicken cashew. Not to fond that its valet parking only. Its a nightmare to get out of there on a busy day, but compared to other location I like this one the best."
Donna K.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,29,4,2.0,7/5/2014,"Very busy place, loads of seating, but only two stalls in the ladies room (with a long waiting line).  Our waitress was more concerned with the birthday party at the next table.  I had the Pear and Bleu Cheese Flatbread.  Three pieces of pear on the entire thing, and only on three of the five pieces of pizza.  Waitress didn't ask if we wanted drink refills, I had to ask for more iced tea.  No offer of a glass of water.  Don't think I'll come back to this one!"
Sean M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,11,,4.0,10/16/2011,"This is the most picturesque Cheesecake Factory I've been to. It sits right next to Mother's Beach (a few feet from the sand) and overlooks one of the fingers of the Marina. The outdoor seating is very nice, with a large terraced patio with umbrellas, and gas lamps for the evening. There is also a newly-remodeled and classy-looking patio at the lower level with fire pits and comfortable lounge furniture. Since this is a chain, the food is the same as that at other locations. I particularly like several of the appetizers, which can be full meals in and of themselves, such as the Avocado Eggrolls, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes and the Fried Mac 'n Cheese (although they are two days worth of calories and fat). The menu is of course the size of a catalog and there are plenty of options for just about everyone. Most dishes are enormous and in my opinion, flavorful and well-prepared. In terms of drinks, they have a good selection of bar favorites, and their flavored lemonades are also great. The real winner here is of course the cheesecake, every flavor I've tried has been incredibly delicious and worth the 7 or 8 dollars (still hurts to pay the bill sometimes). My favorite is the Godiva cheesecake, followed by the Tiramisu. My wife loves the Key Lime and the Original. Service is usually good, with the occasional exception. The wait times can be long during the peak hours (but you can take a stroll down the Marina).  Valet parking is not optional and they seem to increase the fee every year."
BF S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,119,43,1.0,5/5/2012,"Very disappointing. The food was virtually flavorless, the waiter was friendly but really slow. The CF in the south bay puts this one to shame."
Denise P.,"Westminster, CA",0,20,,3.0,6/13/2011,"I always order their chicken wraps/appetizer as a meal.  Sooo good. Stay away from their hamburgers though.  Unless they've changed it, it was a massage patty on a long french roll and not much else.  So unappitizing.   Foods pretty good overall. . hit and miss."
Teague V.,"Marina del Rey, CA",523,14,47,5.0,2/28/2010,"My girlfriend works at the Cheesecake Factory, which puts me in a position that I feel I can help explain a lot of the weird or annoying things that can go on there The valet: Yes, it is ""forced"" valet, but only in the sense that you have to pay. If you want to park your car yourself all you have to do is insist that you park your own car. Just make sure you hand your keys to the valet before you go inside. Big deal right?And the reason the valet is required to charge you to park your car even if you do it yourself or if it isn't busy is because the lots that the valet uses are owned by the city. The city charges not only you, but also the valet company and the staff of the CCF to park there. It sucks but that's just how it is. The crowd: According to my girlfriend, the busiest times are weekends, weeknights after 6 or 7 PM, anytime during summer, and holidays.  Their reservation times are kind of weird (only certain times for certain days of the week), but if you have a large party of say, 10 or more, they say it's best to send a couple people from your party before the rest of your party arrives, so that they can get you guys on the list without everyone having to wait. Worst comes to worst, if the wait is too long, you can always order food to go.My girlfriend is a cashier and she tells me that the usual quote time for to-go orders is 15-20 minutes (which is a hell of a lot faster than waiting 1 hr + just to be seated!). And when you order to-go, you still get a great view.There is a playground and seats on the beach you can take your food down to that is much more secluded than the seats inside the restaurant. The seating arrangement: We all agree that the seats are really close together and can get kind of annoying.On certain nights when the restaurant isn't too crazy busy (like if it's night time and everyone wants to sit inside because they're cold) you might be pleasantly surprised to find that the patio is usually warmer than the dining room. They keep the heaters all over the patio cranked up to eleven.  Also, about whole cheesecake orders: Order your cheesecake at least 2 hours in advance if you want it to be ready to eat by the time you stop by to pick it up.They keep their whole cheesecakes in a freezer until someone orders one, so if you walk in expecting to get a 10"" Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake all ready to serve in five minutes, don't hold your breath. And as for the sometimes sub-par service: I know by the time you actually sit down and are ready to order you probably had to deal with all kinds of things(a line for the valet, a line to get in the door, waiting for your pager to buzz, etc.),but try to keep in mind that while you are experiencing all of this crazyness, so is the staff, and they have to keep it together while balancing all of their orders and special requests, tracking down a manager, and being stopped for something by someone every time they walk by.  (The CCF is known as a hard restaurant to work at because of the stress involved.) Now of course that does NOT excuse poor service.You went out because you wanted to have an experience and it may not matter to you what the staff may be going through. In this case, just remember that you ARE having an experience, so enjoy it. You've got great food, a great view, and some great company. If you rush the experience you went out for, what was the point? Let's say you're waiting to be seated and it's going to be a while. You can talk to the person/people you came with, look at the cheesecakes, even ask the bakers for some recommendations.The point is to relax and enjoy the entire experience and look at the glass half full. So that being said, my girlfriend and I have made a list of some of our favorite items and also popular items: APPETIZERS: Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls Avocado Egg Rolls Buffalo Strips Tex Mex Egg Rolls Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes Thai Lettuce Wraps ENTREES: Miso Salmon Louisiana Chicken Pasta Cajun Jambalaya Pasta Chicken Madeira Chicken Bellagio Pasta Da Vinci APPETIZER AND ENTREE SALADS: Ceasar Salad Chinese Chicken Salad BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad Seared Tuna Tataki Salad DESSERTS: Original Cheesecake Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple Cheesecake Tiramisu Cheesecake Stephanie's Ultimate Red Velvet Cake Cheesecake Keylime Cheesecake White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cheesecake Lemoncello Cream Torte Dulce de Leche Cheesecake Linda's Fudge Cake Strawberry Shortcake One final note: Don't go to the CCF if you're on a diet. They're known for large portions, sweet drinks, and CHEESECAKE. None of which compute to LOW CALORIE COUNT. Also the calories listed on the cheesecakes are per slice. For example if the calories were per cake, you would divide the cheesecake calories(the Red Velvet cheesecake for instance-1,556)by 12 slices and that comes to about 129 calories per slice - in your dreams! You wouldn't believe how many people can't do the math. Thx 4 reading!"
Kevin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,24,,4.0,7/24/2013,"Love this place. The restaurant has a beautiful outdoor patio looking out at the water and a little beach, quite beautiful especially during sunset time. Food is always great to me at any Cheesecake Factory and it applies here. However, service is always so slow. It takes 30-45 mins for your order to come. That's my only complaint, but they always balance it out by giving you a reliable appetizer of bread and butter before your order comes!"
Len B.,"Calabasas, CA",5,35,,1.0,3/19/2014,"Today I visited the Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey and after being told a table would be available in 5 mins was only seated 35 minutes later. I ordered calamari which was excellent as a starter, but was told that the entrees were ready before I managed to even halfway finish the calamari. They brought the wrong salad, and had the audacity to charge for it. We had chicken Marsala and unfortunately the chicken was tougher than shoe leather! We also ordered a hamburger and although we asked for it to be well done, it came out cremated and dry. I have eaten here on several occasions but never had such a bad meal as we had today. I will never return to this restaurant again."
Wendy S.,"Agoura Hills, CA",80,54,9,4.0,10/20/2012,Visited during layover at LAX.  The catfish special was delicious and the staff (Jody +) were terrific!  I live 40 miles from this location yet always find my way back.  Keep up the great service and good food!
Leidy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,96,1,4.0,4/6/2011,"I love the location of this place it has such a nice view of the marina. Went there for lunch with the hubby as an appetizer we had the nachos those alone were enough for a meal for the both of us! We decided to share the lemon herb chicken I loved it the hubby didn't like it all.  The waitress was super friendly, she was on top of what we needed and she even addressed my hubby by his name which was a first for us.  I didn't try the cheesecake because I'm a bigger chocolate cake lover. We got a slice of the fudge cake which was amazing!!! I was having an ecstasy moment that's how much I love chocolate! This is a real nice place to have an intimate lunch either sitting outside or inside. I would so go again."
Dru G.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,70,,5.0,2/8/2011,"I love some of the food at Cheesecake Factory and the cheesecake even more. This has got to be the one with the best service I've been to with Brentwood being the worst. If you're a fan of cheesecake or Cheesecake Factory, give this location a try."
Scott T.,"South Pasadena, CA",237,681,285,4.0,12/30/2010,"You know when you ask your server about something on the menu and you can tell you hit on something they totally love?  Like they even sound a little excited talking about it?  That's what happened when I mentioned that I was thinking of getting the Farmhouse Cheeseburger to our server.  I don't remember everything she said, but I picked out the words ""new on the menu,"" ""big"" and ""gooey.""  It was all of that and more.  I mean, the thing was topped with pork belly and a fried egg.  It was enormous.  Yolk spilled out when I pulled the bun on.  I had to fold my napkin the opposite way afterwards, it was such a mess.  Oh and then I chased that down with a banana cheesecake.  Yeah, i think I moved one step closer to heart disease tonight.  At least I did so deliberately."
JT ..,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,11,,4.0,6/18/2013,"Nice ambiance, great service, great food, beautiful views of the marina from the patio. Also did not have to wait long for valet on a busy Saturday.  Pleased!"
C P.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,93,,4.0,1/3/2015,"Keep a low cal , lite season entrée and I cannot wait for you to open local in SM Place!  :- )"
