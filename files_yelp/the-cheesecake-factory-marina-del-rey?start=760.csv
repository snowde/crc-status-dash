Jennifer B.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/15/2013,"Didn't even get in the door :-(    Pulled in on about 9pm on a sunday night, and right into a space by the road.   we are at the door and a guy in a valet jacket came screaming at us like we should have known that it was valet only.  I asked him to see the sign and he said it was ""over there""  we went to walk ""over there"" and there wad not a sign.  He continued to scream at my date and I that we needed to move.     So as far as I was concerned I pulled into a restaurant and into a regular parking space and for that got screamed at by an employee of the place I was trying to give my business to.    Great move guys! So at this point I had the choice to raise a scene and ruin the night, or maybe get towed or just walk away.  So I walked away, ate somewhere else and posted this on yelp.   kthxbye."
M M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,14,,3.0,4/22/2012,i hate the wait there  the view is nice the food is pretty ok not the best  the wait is ridiculously long
A. D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/29/2012,"Recently, I was at the Marina del Rey location eating my meal, when a roach scurried along the wall right next to me. Let's just say, I lost my appetite.  The kind waiter was very apologetic and offered to wrap my food up for me. She was very sweet (not her fault), but I was not interested in taking my food home at that point.  Not sure what their ""current restaurant grade"" is, but they are clearly not a clean establishment if roaches are now dining with everyone else...gross!!"
Anastacia P.,"Irvine, CA",14,59,7,5.0,1/29/2013,"This was the first Cheesecake I ever went to as a kid in the 80's. The 2nd cheesecake factory to ever open. As one of the original restaurants this one is still my favorite. Looking out onto the Marina. If you like avocado, try the appetizer avocado rolls with pesto sauce. They are to die for. Calamari yum, Cheesecake always superb. The menu is big. Great place. Great for first dates, birthdays, familys, anniversarys. Outside the rift of ocean air makes for a peaceful brunch anyday."
Petete L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,48,,2.0,8/29/2010,"A couple times I got sick dinning in this place. Big plates, food not good. There is better chains for the same money with better food."
Katrana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,50,,2.0,5/17/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I enjoy the selection and consistency of their food at all of their locations, and cheesecake. I think for the price, quantity and quality, it's tough to beat, especially cheesecake. I tend to order the same dishes when returning to a restaurant and for CF, its the crispy beef. And have I mentioned the cheesecake yet?  I'm knocking this particular location because I have a weird hang-up with parking. If I'm coming to spend money at your establishment, at least spot me a parking spot. I know a lot of places charge to park but not at most places around the marina. Even the cheesecake didn't help."
Ashley B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",3,15,2,3.0,8/18/2014,"My parents were in town and wanted to go here.  Of course, we didn't make a reservation.  Our bad.  But we had no idea it would be a near 2 hour wait!  That wasn't the real problem though.  It was the rude hostesses that talked to my parents like they were 5 year olds.  When my mom asked ""how long is the wait now?"", she gave us her best self-aggrandizing attitude and replied ""well, I told you it was an hour and a half a half hour ago, so what do you think?""  And then she walked away.  Lady, it's not our fault you hate your life.  It's your job to approach customers with kindness and sympathy.  Beyond that, when we sat at the bar to get some drinks and appetizers while we were waiting it took a good 20 minutes before anyone even approached us so we could order.  I would comment on the food but I have no memory of it...couldn't have been great."
Hamed S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/3/2014,Very nice location.  Right on water. The food is really good. Price very reasonable. This is one of the first Cheescakes. It gets very busy in the summer being close to water
Abby O.,"Los Angeles, CA",44,168,31,3.0,1/15/2011,"When I went here in early 2009, I thought it was a little lame that you had no choice but to have valet service, but I suppose it is Marina Del Rey.  The service was good, but nothing fantastic. I am aware it is a chain.  If you're a vegetarian, the avocado rolls are ALL VEGETARIAN! Which is hard to find! And they're SUPERB. Also, the garlic noodles are mind-blowing, considering they're from Cheesecake Factory. Also, the outdoor seating was beautiful and quaint."
Lauren S.,"Pleasanton, CA",5,13,,3.0,4/13/2013,The Cheesecake factory is a great place to have great food however not at this location.  The food was not well-prepared and the service teams needs additional training.  The valet parking is mandatory ($.3.50 for Lunch and $4.50 for Dinner).  The view to the marina is beautiful especially on a beautiful day in April.  There is a playground very close the the parking lot right on the beach.
J H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/28/2014,"Went to dinner with friends last Friday evening.  Waited over an hour after ordering and the no food ever arrived.  The waitress informed us that they have a new computer system that failed to submit our order.  When the food finally did arrive, the order was wrong and my food tasted like it was frozen rather than fresh and had been warmed up in a microwave.  I have never had this experience at other Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Needless to say, will never come back!"
Elma V.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,23,1,2.0,4/21/2014,"Asked if we could have the summer rolls without cilantro since my husband doesn't like the taste, was told they're premade - fair enough! Ordered something else but when my husband's plate arrived everything was full of cilantro (it wasn't mentioned as being an ingredient on the menu which is also fair enough, but since the server knew he didn't want it, he should have acted accordingly.) Sent it back and it took so long to be replaced that I was done eating by the time his plate arrived. Kinda ruined the meal for us. No apology was forthcoming."
Brian L T.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,124,93,4.0,12/31/2010,"I love this Cheesecake Factory. I've been here twice already, and am definitely a fan. Not only is the food, wine selection, and staff great, but the view is absolutely phenomenal too. If it isn't too cold/hot, try your best to sit at the outside patio overlooking the Marina. It is gorgeous. That delectable combination of good cuisine, wine, and the stunning backdrop is to die for.  The only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars is the lack of reservation options and the mandatory valet parking, which costs a rather ridiculous $5 considering that there are ample parking spaces in the lot. I guess that's the premium you pay for the view. Totally worth it though."
Sid Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,16,3,3.0,8/11/2013,Cheesecake Factory in the marina was always one of my favorite spots to go to but during our last visit my opinion about this place changed.  The host was unprofessional and our waiter was missing after he took our drink order.   He was more attentive to the bigger party next to us which basically shows poor customer service skills training .  Hopefully next time we go there things will be more customer oriented.
Jessica M.,"Philadelphia, PA",6,28,5,2.0,5/26/2013,This location is way to packed and valet is mandatory for $4.50. The lighting is dim but after a certain hour they dim it again and we could barely see our food! Also this location seems to be really busy. We went on a Sunday night and there were so many people. Otherwise i usually enjoy Cheesecake factory.
Rick R.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,142,7,5.0,12/15/2009,"This is by far my favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurant in the United States.  Excellent Staff. Super friendly and proactive.  Excellent Food  Sublime view of the marina from the restaurant.  Fantastic decor and atmosphere.  These people make fantastic salads and appetizers. I don't really like their pasta, but everything else they serve is pretty good.  My all time favorite cheese cake is the Dulce De Leche cheesecake. You gotta try it!"
Deandra Y.,"Menifee, CA",5,27,1,1.0,1/28/2012,My husband and I went for lunch I was excited at the new skinny menu becasue the calorie intake is much lower. I ordered the grilled turkey burger my husband ordered the white chicken chili. I was so disappointed when the burger came out it clearly was not turkey and both the waitress and manager tried to convince me it was. In all my years I have never seen a Brown turkey burger made from white meat.  I left hungrier than when I came. Thoroughly disappointed.
S A.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,87,,3.0,5/30/2012,"Listen it's all good here. On a warm afternoon/evening, sit outside on the patio and enjoy the view of the marina. it's a nice place to for a simple romantic dinner. The food is good, as good as any other cheesecake factory. As for parking, I opt for the public parking lot right next door to the restaurant valet area. The valets will just park your car in the same lot."
Michelle S.,"TARZANA, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/14/2013,I was here last Tuesday. Breathtaking view from the outside patio. Great food too. I loved the avocado rolls and the pineapple upside down cake. Can't wait to go back soon!
Mike W.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,61,4,4.0,8/16/2012,"I HATE writing reviews normally on 'chain's, but this particular Cheesecake Factory rocks! It's usually busy (which for some reason I like because alot of attractive women dine here), has fantastic 'chain' food, and very good service. Did I mention the attractive crowd this place brings? To top it off, if your lucky enough to sit outside on the deck you can see a gorgeous view of the Marina. The effect works better at night. If your in the Marina Del Rey-Venice area and want something familiar but good try this place out! If your a single guy eating here, make sure not to stare too much at the beautiful women flocking this place."
