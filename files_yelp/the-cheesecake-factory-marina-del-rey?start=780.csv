Paris S.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",28,4,1,4.0,8/10/2012,"Not bad, big portions and a great veiw:)"
Amanda A.,"Culver City, CA",3,30,,5.0,5/24/2010,"This is the best location out of all locations, because you get a view of the Harbour and can walk outside and dine on the patio overlooking the beach.  My kids love this beach, with it's playground and calm water, after a good meal it's a real treat!  Service is always excellent here, and the food is always good."
Erica R.,"Oxnard, CA",15,95,1,4.0,9/13/2010,"Cheesecake Factory offers a variety of over 100 different food items and several beverages, everything from smoothies and soda to wine and mixed drinks.  My only problem with going here is deciding what I want to eat. This particular location has a fantastic view of the Marina, which is why I was excited to go in the first place.  I have to say that the customer service is touch and go, everything ranging from rude waiters to eccentric waiters to helpful waiters.  Last time I went, the bread came out with the main course, but I guess I'm happy it came out at all.  The view is well worth every penny, and the drinks (okay, alcoholic mixed drinks) are superb albeit quite expensive. This location is by far my favorite, although The Cheesecake Factory in general is a favorite :-)"
Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",238,40,1,2.0,12/27/2010,"I agree  with a yelper on here .... really 5 bucks per parking... I parked it myself and I still had to pay the valet guy to park my own car ... The soup was cold , but i had a good hot chocolate .... the view of the water was nice ... SERVICE Was okay ... I dont know about the rest of the food was to afraid to ask for a salad"
Susanne W.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",25,30,,5.0,3/13/2013,"Fabulous service and delicious food! At the risk of boring everyone, I still have to say it.  The Cheesecake Factory delivers consistently good food and service.  I try to frequent independently owned restaurants, but yesterday I had a truly delicious meal, excellent value for money, with great service.  Try the Steak Dianne and shrimp combo.  Try getting it somewhere else for the same price.  Not possible!"
Don R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,61,,3.0,5/27/2013,I love the location of this restaurant. Unfortunately I've lost my love for this restaurant. The lunch and dinner selections stopped drawing me back for meals years ago. The last few deserts I've brought home don't seem to have that same kick they had years ago. Maybe I'm just getting old.
Cassandra M.,"Torrance, CA",7,48,,3.0,5/24/2014,"I went her for my birthday and I was already a bit flustered because we had to wait 25 minutes. It was my first time at one of these locals so I wasn't expecting much. It was very full inside and outside. Maybe it was packed because I went on a Saturday, I don't know. Anyway, we were seated outside in the worst seat possible. My partner demanded we sit somewhere else since we weren't happy with the place they seated us. So we were seated somewhere else. The lady who accommodated us somewhere else was very chill about it just like they should be. Anyway, the waiter who seated us prior brought us stale bread. The bread was cold and very hard but after we were seated in the other table the bread was warm and soft. I guess it all depends on the waiter you get. I ordered the Fillet Mignon and it wasn't the best. It was mediocre at best. It had some fat and it wasn't as tender as I would have liked it. Overall, I don't see what the hype about this place is. This place is not upscale like most people say. I guess some of us are just used to better.."
Gerald W.,"Burbank, CA",21,157,23,2.0,9/30/2012,"Food was not okay, I cannot say the same for the service.  The waiters seemed preoccupied with how their weekend was going(based on the conversation I heard.  Also I'm not sure if there was anything else that could have been done in the situation but someone s baby kept crying the whole time and it really ruins your meal when you have to listen to a screaming baby the whole time..... can't say I won't come back, but I'll definitely look elsewhere first next time"
Judye R.,"Wildomar, CA",45,122,1,4.0,8/3/2012,The Cheesecake Factory in MDR was a great location for our small high school reunion (20+) people.  The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  The view was simply beautiful.  It made for a wonderful get-together.
Jin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",279,1042,1684,4.0,3/17/2007,"This place is crowded, but so are other Cheesecake Factory locations so who cares?  When you go, you're in for it right? I think this place is actually the nicest location when it comes to the view.  It's actually pretty.  Since when was Cheesecake Factory pretty?    GO IN THE SUMMERTIME DONT GO IN THE WINTER That way you'll be happy and excited to get seated outside."
T C.,"Alameda, CA",106,186,411,3.0,8/8/2010,"Your usual consistent Cheesecake Factory, but set in MDR overlooking the marina.  Major bummer: paying for parking."
G M.,"Hell, MI",6,73,6,3.0,9/2/2012,"So I love restaurants with a view. This is one of them. I like the food.  It is a typical Cheesecake Factory so you know what to expect as far as food is concerned.  Now, service can be up and down. I usually like to sit as close to the water as possible and will usually ask if I can do so. This is one of the few places where the hostesses have refused to sit me where I ask when the tables are empty. At most restaurants, if the table is empty they will accommodate you. Luckily, the couple of times that this has happened, the wait staff have allowed me to move.  They have a lot of outdoor seating and  I love that about this place."
Zach R.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,78,2,3.0,12/5/2011,The cheesecake factory is everything that is wrong with america.  Gluttony to the nth degree.  With hundreds of choices on there menu there is only one vegetarian  choice that doesn't require asking for the normal dish without chicken.  The food is always good but not great.  I will certainly be eating here again but I think of it as a mediocre chain restaurant and nothing more.
Sara W.,"Broomfield, CO",14,83,3,4.0,12/27/2011,"This is probably the best hapyp hour in the Marina.... and I eat healthy and calorie conscious food! They have a small bites sections w/ choices such a bean hummus dip, small little pizzas (SO good). C.F. , known for high calorie dishes, actually has a lot of choices.  SO friendly, and if there EVER is a problem, they are on point to fix it. The GM, Brent, really stands behind his restaurant and staff. Try it for Happy Hour. but don't take my table. :) Bobby is the best. In sucha  big city it's nice to have a place where you can say, ""I'll have the usual."" And they know what you want!"
Michelle C.,"Orange, CA",196,57,34,5.0,6/20/2012,My favorite place to eat in Marina Del Rey... The food is always perfect and the servers are attentive and great :)  The MISO SALMON is to die for. The view of the water and marina is so relaxing to eat outside
Steven M.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,36,,4.0,7/16/2010,Easy easy easy....  Laid back and casual. fun when I bring the kids. They can play out front in the sand while we wait to be seated or after or Sunday brunch. On nice days sit outside and enjoy the great views! Good sized portions and drinks are good. The cheese cake is the BEST! We try a new once each time and share one for the table. They are large.
Matt C.,"Southborough, MA",3,12,,5.0,12/8/2012,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, it's all good! Visited this location while visiting my brother and his family. Great service and food! Can't go wrong!"
Ana K.,"Tujunga, CA",2,10,,5.0,7/30/2014,"Lets start out by saying that had the service at the location not been beyond excellent, I would have given it 4 stars for the ridiculously long wait. The ambiance at this cheesecake factory is great which is why I chose to celebrate my 20th birthday here with a couple of girl-friends. We got there at about 6:30 but we were not actually seated until 8:30. I know that cheesecake does not take reservations but the least they can do is put heating lamps outside for the people waiting for their seat. Even during summer nights, given the location, it get chilly after 7:00pm. Now the reason why I decided to overlook the long and cold wait is because of the excellent service. The first waiter was amazing and patient while 6 indecisive girls took their sweet time ordering. He accommodated all our requests and adjustments to our meals. Afterwards, we asked if we can close that tab at that table and move near the fire pits for desert. When we got there we realized that the waiter serving near the fire pits needed to leave as his shift was over and they would no longer be serving in that area. However, after we explained to him that it was my birthday, he was willing to stay and serve us even if it meant working when he didn't have to. Excellent service and ambiance, wish the wait time was a bit less."
Erich H.,"Northeast, Denver, CO",0,3,,1.0,2/5/2013,"I called made a reservation for my client giving them all of my credit card information, and also got a confirmation fax back. When my client showed up today they were told they can not use my card. Today is my clients birthday and i was trying to surprise her. I am extremely disappointed."
Sanaz M.,"Boca Raton, FL",65,361,71,3.0,7/24/2012,Great location but not so great food. The portions are HUGE. I ordered the Thai pasta and its was alright. We also ordered the Orange chicken which was too sweet. Not impressed at all. Our server was super nice and attentive. I am not a fan of the mandatory valet parking. Come on!!!! It's Cheesecake Factory not Neiman and Marcus even if its in Marina Del Rey. Only reason I keep returning to this particular spot is because of the view. Good place to go if you have visitors from out of town.
