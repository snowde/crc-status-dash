Gabrielle W.,"Brooklyn, NY",996,24,3,5.0,9/17/2017,"I'm not mad at this Cheesecake Factory at all! Great view, good service and consistent food. Love it!"
Nichola B.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,52,25,4.0,3/15/2017,Went for happy hour with my friend and ordered a mojito and summer rolls. The mojito knocked my socks off and was only $6. The summer rolls we're good and great for splitting with a friend or with whoever. Eat and drink here and you will most likely leave satisfied.
Natalie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/5/2017,"If you dine at this particular restaurant, please dine on the patio the view is spectacular. Our server was the real MVP, she really took care of us and made our dining experience a pleasant one.  The food was top notch and of course the cheesecake was to die for. I will most definitely be dining here in the near future..... Awesome experience overall."
Wendy L.,"Culver City, CA",0,47,17,2.0,5/15/2017,"My family of 3 went on Mother's Day for an early dinner (5pm).   There was immediate seating on the lower level, which should have been our first clue.   We elected to sit there and were told about the numerous items on the kids' menu that would not be available.    Ok, we were willing to work with that.  We ask that they immediately start a quesadilla for our 6 year old and ask for a few minutes to consider our grown-up order.   We peruse the condensed menu and hubby wants salmon, which is on the condensed menu.  We build appetizers and my dish around his anticipated salmon dish.  Waiter comes back and tells us they are out of salmon.    Why wasn't this told to us with all of the other warnings about what they couldn't serve to us (spaghetti with meatballs, chicken fingers, corn dogs) when we were seated?      We readjust and now we decide to get the Thai lettuce wraps and pot stickers (which are also on the condensed menu).     15 minutes later, after our lettuce wrap order has been entered, we are told that they can't accommodate pot stickers downstairs.   Seriously??????  How did you not know this when we ordered?    We're told the lettuce wraps will be out any minute.   About 10 minutes later, the lettuce wraps come out and the chicken is literally COLD and completely dry.   This is a dish we've had dozens of times and it was never like this.   Just bad.   To make it worse, my son's plan cheese quesadilla STILL hasn't been brought out more than 30 minutes from when we ordered it.  They apologized but what good does that do at that point?   Not so much as an offer of a minor discount or accommodation for one error after another. I expected service to be  slower than usual on Mother's Day.   But I never expected this level of bad.   I would have been better off at McDonald's for my mother's day dinner!"
David F.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,44,9,1.0,3/12/2017,"Generally this place is a great place to come on a Sunday afternoon Unfortunately not today We gave our orders for drinks (adult and kids). Adults got their drinks, kids drinks were still not out 15 min later We ordered food, one of the orders was not put in So everyone ate and when the order came out it was the wrong one So disappointing"
Vanessa B.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",2,22,11,3.0,5/2/2017,"I was here for a family members dinner and we are all in a great mood, having a good time, we place our orders and with time our plates start coming over.  Everyone got their plates EXCEPT the birthday boy, we ask a waiter and his excuse was ""he ordered steak well done so it's taking a little longer"" even though 2 other people had ordered steak and already received theirs. So that was our red flag they forgot his order. Shortly, a blonde female manager comes over apologizing for their mistake, reassuring they were working on the steak now And ended by offering a free PIECE of cheesecake. I was beyond offended at that moment, everyone at the table was pretty much done, it was his birthday, your forgot his entire plate and all you could do was a piece of cake?  We were ready to say forget his food, give us boxes for the left overs and we are leaving. But I didn't want to ruin his night so instead I got up and went to speak to a different manager. A male standing near the check in podium and I explained everything to him as he apologized profusely. Now I know they messed up big time, everyone's plates were literally being picked up as the birthday boy finally got his plate but I'm still giving 3 stars instead of 1 for the amazing manager who went out of his way to take care of the birthday boys dish even though he wasn't the one helping us to begin with. I very much appreciate when management takes responsibility and makes sure a guest is well taken care of after a mistake like that. It wasn't a petty piece of cheesecake. I wish I had remembered his name but I thank him for making it a little better.  I will be continue eating at this Cheesecake Factory so long as this doesn't happen again."
H. R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/26/2017,"I absolutely love a girls afternoon lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Rey. Their lunch specials are awesome and the view is relaxing. However, part of the reason it's a favorite is the great attitude of the servers, but this past Saturday we had a bad experience with the bartender! I even had to speak to a manager.  Ultimately, the situation left a bad taste in all of our mouths! I don't even know the outcome, the manager didn't follow-up with us. We paid the bill and left. I love the Cheesecake Factory Marina Del Rey but please don't slack on the customer service!!"
David R.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,8,,3.0,9/23/2017,"This place is a hit or miss for me. I come here with a friend once in a while when were in the area and to be honest I usually don't want to come here. I feel suffocated and crowded everytime I come. There are so many families and children everywhere it just gives me anxiety. The servers here are a hit or miss too. There are some that know the menu and can tell you what's going on and there are some that are so blehhh about it that I feel like I can't bother them anymore. Mind you I've worked for the company and I know that my customer service was always up to par. It get's 3 stars because the food is good sometimes. It has made me sick before. Maybe someday I'll be happy coming here, but until then it's a place I have to go to because my friend likes the patio. It's like going to the dentist's office no bueno."
Zee Z.,"Glendale, CA",1,9,,1.0,9/14/2017,Worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to I got scammed from the valet to the food I'm sorry but the chef for this place needs work. just a good View that's all highly recommend not coming here!!!
PatrickJ T.,"Bakersfield, CA",193,2912,14296,4.0,1/3/2017,"One of the first Cheesecake Factory locations I ever visited.  Have only had good experiences here.  Efficient staff, clean restaurant, and good food.  Of course, the cheesecakes are amazing!  If they weren't so expensive, then I would purchase slices to go. There are a couple of things which differentiate this branch.  Beautiful location in Marina Del Rey by the ocean!!  Valet parking only.   Wish there was a Cheesecake Factory in my hometown!"
Robb P.,"Los Angeles, CA",123,23,42,3.0,5/2/2017,I took my team here for a group dinner last Wednesday. It's great for accommodating big groups and lovely restaurant on the marina.  The staff are very very friendly and accommodating and obviously well trained. Food is very average and it's a shame because with the ambience and staff it really could be taken up a notch.  Pre made meals I'm not a fan of. I understand the central kitchen concept as it adds to to consistency. Food is bland or over drenched in sauces and flavors.  Would be back but not in a hurry
Christi I.,"Beverly Hills, CA",37,129,255,5.0,7/19/2016,"I really like this Cheesecake Factory. They have award winning waiters like the phenomenal Elias and the strawberry lemonade is amazing! We went yesterday and I wasn't sure what to get. Our server Nicky suggested the steak tacos. I did not realize I had been sleeping on this delightful dish. Cilantro infused rice with black beans and four delectable semi crunchy tacos stuffed with thick, juicy pieces of steak. I mean stuffed!!!! It was garnished with salsa, guacamole and pickled onions and other stuff that tastes oh, so good! I couldn't even finish it all! Nicky was also accommodating enough to let me sample their housemate Sangria. Wow...it was tasty! Delicious notes of cinnamon and fruit throughout. I would've ordered a glass of I wasn't driving. Will get it next time.  After our amazing lunch, we grabbed the black out cake and strawberry cheesecake to go. The blackout cake was decadent. Dark chocolate, fudge, dense and moist...like...the ultimate chocolate make everything better cake. Again, I didn't finish all of my cake. I gave it to my daughter who feverishly inhaled it. It was a huge slice of cake.  We walked out to the beach and dipped out toes in the warm water afterwards. It is five dollars for valet (I was able to self park because I arrived before lunch crowd and it is cheap compared to other beachside parking lots) It was a pleasant way to end a fabulous lunch. This is definitely a place to go for whatever you fancy. They can accommodate and everyone is very attentive. My glass of strawberry lemonade never got empty because they were so on top of things. I even took the time to thank them via the online feedback from my receipt and got myself 5 bucks to use again...please trust...it will be used on my return trip.  Ever wanna contemplate life, cheer someone up or stabilize your mood and fill your belly with delicious food...go and eat on the deck and just be. They will take care of all the rest."
Treshaune D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,6,1,1.0,10/16/2017,"My experience was horrible. First when we were seated it took our server Ron over 30 minutes to take our order. However,  we watch him attend to the two tables on either side of us. Within the 30 minutes it took him to get to us we asked for bread to hold us over. He seemed to be very irritated by our request. My friend expressed to him that she was not happy with her drink and if he could ask the bartender if it could be stronger. He said that he would. He returned to our table 2 times with no response to her questions. She then asked he said that no it could be, and left the drink on the table. The third time he returned she then asked if he could return the drink as she was not satisfied. The next time he came to our table (which was over an hour of us being there) he was clearing the table and spilled 2 full cups of water on the table which spilled all over 1 of my friends and her phone, it spilled on half of my other friend, and spilled a third on myself. We were very shocked as this has never happened and wanted to complain. But our other friend said we have not received our food and to not cause a scene as he might tamper with our food. We assisted with him with getting the water off the table and asked him to please remover the wet bread, silverware, and wet napkins off the table. He did not! We asked for more napkins as we used ours to help him with the water. He came back with the small paper bar napkins ( yet another slap in Our faces). Our good then came to the table. Two out of the 3 plates were cold. We asked him and napkins, and the food being cold and he said, ""you are asking for too many thing at once and I'm getting nervous. When I get nervous I start spilling things like water on people"" and he then laughed. That was it and we asked for the check. We asked if he could split the check and he then said, "" that would take too long, he had other tables to attend too"". I then asked for the manager. I had never experienced such terrible customer service before. I explained all of what happened to the manager. He then stated he would have to get the senior manager of 16 years as this was above his level that he could handle. Steven the senior manager came over and listen to what happened. He stated he would comp the two means that were could as we didn't eat them and give us a free cheesecake. He then asked to pack up our meals and disappeared. When he returned with our food he wished us a good night and told us he would send the first manager over to handle our checks. Once our checks came nothing was comped. We only received free cheesecake. This is truly unacceptable! This experience has made me not ever want to come to this establishment again! I have lost trust in the company's ability to give proper customer service and in the management as well! Shame on you cheesecake factory."
Zaur R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,24,2.0,9/11/2017,"Great place , worth your money however this Cheesecake Factory extremely understaffed and you will be waiting a long time even for your drinks I am not even mentioning about your appetizers. If you don't want to wait for your drinks for 20 - 30 minutes don't go to this cheesecake factory ."
Antoinette B.,"Playa del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",92,114,52,4.0,7/7/2016,"Cheesecake Factory food is always g r E a t. As for this location, seemed smaller then the ones I'm familiar with but it was good. I wouldn't say anything about this one particular 'wowed' me, but good. Only thing I wasn't a big fan of is the outside seating is so close together. I was here with my gf and felt like I was double dating with the strangers next to us because it is such tight close quarters."
Marie C.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",24,5,1,5.0,11/29/2017,Love this location. They have such a lovely view of the dock boats by the beach. Food is great and drinks were great.
Sam S.,"Kaohsiung, Taiwan",23,2,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"Don't do valet parking inside. Food and service is ok, but the valet guys are awful. I already told them my car was on E-brake, he said he knew then started throttle without releasing my E-brake, you dumb ass, and they treated my and my mates' cars so rude during parking our cars. Jesus, please fire these rude people or I would never go to Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Rey. They will ruin all the efforts that other staff building inside this restaurant."
Paul K.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,148,8,2.0,8/22/2017,"This is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to.  In fact it is the only one that hasn't been even close to really good.  I suppose we should have figured that out when there was no wait to be seated at 6 PM on a Saturday.  Our first server took a long time to take care of our table. We probably waited 40 minutes for food.  They were out of the brown bread we liked, and of course once we were finished, it seemed all they had was fresh brown bread.   Our nachos, which is something we usually love, were burnt and had minimal toppings and cheese.  What is really pathetic is that we asked for more cheese.  We didn't even finish them.  Not everything was bad.  When the first server went on break, the second one was very efficient.  Our other two appetizers were decent, and the bread was good, albeit not brown. The cheesecake, was of course, very good.  That being said, I'll just go to the one in the Grove or by Disneyland like usual.  Much, much better locations."
Kelly P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,10,1.0,8/2/2017,"Of the many years I have visited several other Cheesecake Factory establishments, this was the first time I visited this location and let me tell you, it was also the last. I was there a couple days ago, looking forward to having some Cheesecake with my family and as I approach the take out counter, I was greeted by the most rude cashier with the worst attitude (Maryon). The first thing he asked was ""you getting Cheesecake?"" I said yes, and went ahead and let him know what I wanted. I didn't even want to ask any questions to avoid being yelled at. Once he handed me the cheesecakes, I asked him if the receipt was in the bag. After looking around the counter, he found my receipt and threw it in the bag and under his breath he said ""it is now"" and that was it. The total didn't seem right so instead of even bothering to ask this man anything, I decided to call the establishment while I was still in the parking lot. And after speaking to manager (Amanda) it seemed that there had been some miscommunication as far as the rules they had for the deal they had on the cheesecakes for that day (half off). But instead of her apologizing for the error, and the fact that her horrible staff member had the worst attitude and wasn't approachable, she went ahead practically defended him by saying that I should have read the sign. I decided to contact corporate where they were very apologetic for both their employees actions. The price was the last thing I cared about. It was the simple fact that they have the worst people running this place. Horrible customer service. After going through some of the other reviews, I found a few other people who mentioned this same old African American man with the worst attitude. I'm sure many people have complained and clearly nothing has been done about it. Shame on you Cheesecake Factory."
Jacklyn G.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,32,13,1.0,11/24/2017,"As a party of 10, we arrived Wednesday night, roughly at 630p. I'm not sure the time frame we were quoted as I was apart of the second car for our party that arrived later. We waited for over an hour to be seated while basically everyone that walked passed us, where all seated right away. It was very busy, so we waited.  While waiting, my niece was sitting on the furthest bench to the parking lot outside, also in the spot of the bench closest to the parking lot, and in a white Lexus, valet almost hit her while backing it up directly in front of the restaurant! She didn't move, but it wasn't until her Dad tapped on the window did the car stop moving. Not exaggerating, the car was 4-5 inches from her. Possibly closer.  While waiting, my husband ordered a glass of wine & a beer at the bar, which took very long to receive.  Finally we're seated. Summer was our server. After 5 or so minutes, she approaches us to tell us that she'll be with us in a moment. She comes back where we're all ready to order, waters for everyone except 3 kids drinks, and we ordered our food at that time as well. Bread hits the table- breads get devoured since there were lots of hungry people at the table- my daughter was crying that she was thirsty, I waited and waited and waited for our drinks, finally I got up and walked to the server station to get a water for my child.. a few moments later, water finally arrives. The food took a very, verrryy long time. The waters were never refilled even though we requested it, one child didn't receive her juice until we were all finished eating, and we were never checked on during the course of our meal either. No additional alcohol or dessert was ordered because we were sure we wouldn't get it anywhere near on time. By the time we saw Summer again, we needed boxes and our check and one person needed to place a to go order. ""What do you want?"", Summer asked him. Straight to the point and not in the friendly way.  Overall our server seemed overwhelmed & frustrated, which is totally fine, as long as you're able to keep it positive, explain that things are taking a few extra moments, and keep in touch with your guests. Instead we were totally ignored and spent a lot of money, really, for less than mediocre service.  1 star goes to the ONE gentleman wearing a purple button down, most likely a FOH Manager, who was genuinely friendly when he brought out our food and smiled and greeted us when we walked past him to our table."
