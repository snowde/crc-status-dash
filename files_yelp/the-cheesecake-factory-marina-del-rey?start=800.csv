Craig R.,"San Diego, CA",1854,650,141,1.0,5/12/2009,"Ok, I have literary visited this restaurant at least 15 times since high school. I obviously came back for a reason. For a chain restaurant the food is good and they have large portions. At this particular location summer evening dining is awesome. Yes, yes, yes there are many pretty faces as well. Anyway, my point being I was a fan of this location. That was until my last 2 dining experiences.  Anyone who knows me knows I'm very laid-back, easy-going and friendly. For whatever reason, my last two times at CF our waitresses treated us like scum. It was like they were disappointed to deal with my table. What? We all looked happy, affluent and easy to approach. But noooooo. Each time, the two different waitresses were rude and would not acknowledge us. I hate to do it and never had to but damn do I have to throw out the ""Race Card?"" Was it because both times my group was Hispanic and Black? I have never experienced that ""feeling"" in all my travels around the globe. Needless to say, I reported my experience (both times) to management and walked out before ordering. Twice. I gave this place a chance and I experienced the same problem.  That said I hope that negative vibe is gone and if you go, may you have a better experience. Food: Good, large portions, wide variety Eye Candy: Excellent Parking: SUCKS Wait for table: SUCKS Service: SUCKS BALLS Management: SUCKS"
Eris B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,75,3,4.0,5/31/2014,"OK, it's Cheesecake Factory.  You know why you're going there, right?  So, if you're going to go to a CCF, then this one is a nice one to go to because: it's right on the water and the patio is huge and there is a public lot right next to the restaurant that's cheap and easier to get in and out of.  The last time I was there, a man had a hissy fit as he was dropping off his car for lunch.  Not a great way to start a meal."
Kaitlyn S.,"Boston, MA",4,24,,5.0,1/2/2013,"Obsessed! I know the Cheesecake Factory is a chain but this has got to be the best one I've gone too. There's a large selection of just about everything anyone would want and everything I've experienced is really good. Just save room for some cheesecake afterwards. Also, the view of the marina is absolutely beautiful."
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",176,206,97,3.0,1/18/2012,Went here the other day for happy hour with some friends. All the fried food you can eat for $5 each dish. At least it seemed like all fried dishes. My stomach likes although my arteries may disagree. Four or Five drinks also for $5 each as well. I'll take the Long Island to get straight to the point thank you. I will be partaking again in the future.
John C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,40,,3.0,8/7/2012,yah know what cheesecake factory? You need to work on your spaghetti. It is by the far the most bland spaghetti I've ever tasted. Please Cheesecake factory I want a nice tasty spaghetti sauce. Your Caesar though was quite tasty. But work on your marinara sauce or else.
Bruce C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,22,1,5.0,7/27/2012,"OK, it is Cheese Cake Factory a chain restaurant featuring large portions, WAY BETTER than most CHAINS. To all those that complain about too much food, go somewhere else, please!!!! Because the portions are now getting human sized :( Always consistently good, plus the patio has a view of the marina. If you don't like looking at boats, don't go to a restaurant in the marina, simple. Valet parking sucks 100% of the time anywhere for any reason, I hate it and I live in a building with valet parking. But parking isn't what a restaurant is for, eating is what a restaurant is for, I love the Thai lettuce wraps, almost every salad is a hit, the hibachi beef and salmon are favorites. I have noticed that all the CCF are getting smaller slices of cheesecake and that is not making me happy as I usually split one with my wife."
Angela C.,"Orange County, CA",227,1627,693,4.0,10/3/2007,"This Cheesecake Factory was very accommodating.  There was a wait for lunch, but we got seated pretty quickly, maybe because we chose outdoor/patio seating.  The patio here overlooks the gorgeous Marina Del Rey harbor.  With the sun shining and the wind blowing, it probably made the food taste better. In all the Cheesecakes I've ever gone to, I have never had one bad thing at this place.  This upscale American food chain is as consistent as it can get.  Their best dish is the Miso Salmon - hands down! I love their chicken wraps too... !"
Janice B.,"Reno, NV",0,18,5,5.0,11/16/2012,We had a table for two on the patio for lunch and enjoyed our visit so much!  Ordered two appetizers and green mint tea.  Our server was upbeat and took such good care of us we will return!  It is so nice to have good food and a server with a smile.  Thanks Andrew!
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2735,19385,3.0,6/18/2009,"I'm not the biggest fan of Cheesecake Factory.  It had its heyday in the late 90s/early 00s.  I remember first coming to the Marina del Rey location back in the early 00s, and not much has changed since.  The portions are still enormous so you are better off just getting an entree.  The Cheesecake Factory menu is vast with so many varieties.  I've ventured out several times, but I think you may be better served to just stick with dishes you like (because there are a lot of mediocre and even worse-than-mediocre dishes on the menu).  In terms of dessert, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but they have a few styles that aren't that bad.  The non-cheesecake dessert options are very average. I've also been here for brunch.  The food was just okay at brunch time. In terms of this location, the service is kind of inconsistent.  The place gets incredibly busy, and some servers can handle it better than others.  The atmosphere at the Marina Del Rey location is great.  The indoor dining is nice, and the outdoor dining next to the water is also good.  One of the more interesting things about this location are the people who frequent it--you will see a lot of middle-aged men (or older) with some very young women (try and guess wife or daughter?). The food at Cheesecake Factory really depends on what you order.  Some of it is better than others.  I recently had the miso salmon here, and it was pretty good.  If you know what's good, you should have (at the very least) a decent meal.  If you don't, all bets are off.  On the whole, a grade of 2.5 stars is probably fair.  Parking is valet."
James S.,"Surprise, AZ",31,17,15,5.0,6/18/2012,"It's Friday night, a slight chill coming from the Marina. Michael Buble playing on the speakers, heat lamps and tiki torches alight outside. The atmosphere on the patio is very calming and enjoyable. I ordered the flat iron steak which was simply delectable. As an avid user of A1 steak sauce, I didn't have to think twice about putting it to the side for this one. The experience tonight was pleasing, and our server was great. Escape the noisy inside and cozy up on the patio near the heat lamps. A+ for Cheesecake Factory, job well done."
Mallika I.,"Manhattan, NY",22,147,,5.0,2/8/2012,Awesome views - you can see all the private boats there. Food is fantastic - but the portions are pretty big. We went there reallllly late but the server was very accomodating and cute as well - he did space out occasionally and apologized profusely for it but i dont mind at all - people are bound to get tired at 12.30 freaking a.m.! Will definitely return the next time I'm in the area!
Ags P.,"Chino, CA",215,254,113,3.0,12/17/2008,"I get that everywhere in LA, you're paying for parking, or getting a ticket for parking no matter where you go.  I get that.  However, it's freakin' Cheesecake Factory!   Ummmm, hello, all other Cheesecake Factory's...parking is free.  Uuuuugh, but because it's in the marina...and because every other snooty place in the marina has valet...so must the Cheesecake Factory.  Booo!    To me, the Cheesecake Factory isn't fancy, like all the other places around it.  I'm not impressed.  However, my guilty pleasure is their cream of chicken something soup.   That...and the brown bread.  YUM!    Alright alright...and like all others have mentioned...the breathtaking view of the marina from the window.  *sigh*  It's pretty freakin' nice."
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",6,9,,1.0,12/13/2010,"In celebration of  my Aunt's birthday, about 15 people got together to begin our night at The Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Rey.  My cousin stopped off at one of her favorite bakery's to grab cupcakes for the birthday girl before joining the party. As we were packing up to head to our next destination a bus boy squeezes through the crowd and begins to rigorously clean the tables we had just gotten up from. My cousin says to the bus boy politely as she puts on her sweater ""don't touch that, I'll get it."" He acted as if he didn't hear her. She said again, ""sir, don't touch that, I'm going to get it."" He ignored her once more and yanks the bag the cupcakes were resting in. The next thing I hear is my cousin shriek ""OH NO!""  As you can imagine, all 12 cupcakes were turned upside down making them less than presentable for my Aunt. She immediately called for a manager (Audrianna). After explaining the story to Audrianna, her response was ANYTHING BUT sympathetic. She said ""I'm sorry, that your cupcakes were ruined, but you left the table unattended."" WE DIDN'T. She said, ""I'm sorry, but I'm sure he didn't mean to do that on purpose."" No one is saying that he meant to ruin the cupcakes on purpose (although when a customer tells your employee TWICE not to touch their personal belongings and they disregard your wishes, you have to wonder) but that does not take away the fact that your employee ruined them and we need to have something to present to our Birthday girl.  Audrianna's remedy? We had two options: She could take the cupcakes and clean them up and put whip cream on them; or ONE slice of cheesecake. WHIP CREAM (No icing huh?) ON A CUPCAKE OR ONE SLICE OF CHEESECAKE? 12 cupcakes were ruined.   We asked to speak to another manager. She said there was no one else on duty. We asked if there was someone we could call. She said no. We were going in circles with this woman for about 20 minutes before she offered us a small round cheesecake. Again, What kind of offer is that? Finally, she realized that we were not going to accept being treated that way and she offered a medium cheesecake. The bus boy (who never apologized), Audriana and her lack of customer service did a GREAT disservice not only to paying customers but to the entire organization. She should NOT be the face of Cheescake Factory."
Qiana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",198,61,35,3.0,12/16/2011,"Miso Salmon with brown rice. Not much can go wrong here....sat in bar and their was a semi-birthday party going on, with lots of kids in the BAR area.  Seemed weird, I wish the staff would have suggested a table for the large party."
Judy F.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",4,42,,1.0,12/12/2010,"The first table we were seated at was against the wall in a corner, which I was fine with, I don't mind a wall, it usually means it'll be a quiet location.  The problem arose when every stupid server decided to use the 6 inch clearance between my husbands chair and the next table as a walkway.  They were carrying shit over his head and constantly bumping him even when he tried to protest they just kept going right through.  Yeah, I got pissed.  Why the hell would your staff be stupid enough to go THROUGH your customers?  You've got to know that people don't enjoy constantly getting ass or crotch in their face while they have a meal.  Either there shouldn't be a table at that location or your staff are idiots, I""m betting on both.  To their credit they moved us immediately when I informed our waiter we were ready to leave if we weren't moved, and the rest of service was fine. It only gets 1 star because there was nothing redeeming about this place.  Even when we were moved the tables were awfully crowded together.  Food was just ok.  Our appetizer was great but everything else was pretty low quality.  Huge portions don't make up for stale tastless rice, frozen fries, and cole slaw with more dressing than vege.  It was just unappealing mass produced heart attacks on a plate dripping in fat and sodium filled sauces.  For that price point there are plenty of better tasting and less crowded restaurants to go to."
Rob B.,"Marina del Rey, CA",3,41,1,5.0,8/13/2011,"You know, how can you really go wrong with the Factory.  I mean their menu has everything and they cook it well.   The most important part of the meal is the cheescake,  I am a fan of the Banana cream pie!!!!!   WOW WOW WOW, this stuff is the best.   Light, airey and creamy.  If you are a banana fan then get a slice you wont regret it!"
Diane D.,"Culver City, CA",1,17,,1.0,8/29/2014,"WORST SERVICE EVER!  We arrived at this restaurant at 6:50 PM on a Thursday evening, a party of five, to celebrate a birthday. We asked for patio seating and were told it would be a 30-minute wait.  They gave us one of their buzzer light-up devices and we took a table in the bar, about 15 feet away from the front desk. We waited 10 minutes for a waiter to take our drink order, and when he did, he acted as though it was the last place on earth he wanted to be.  We paid the check and waited to be called for a table. And waited. And waited.  A full hour later we approached the desk and were told that our device was defective and that they had called out the name of our party several times. Remember, we were only about 15 feet away. And there were five of us. Not one of us heard the page. I approached a manger who was all loosey goosey about it. ""Oh yeah well, we're waiting for a party to leave so you can sit.""  I went back to the bar and another manager came out and apologized profusely. He said they had paged us FIVE MINUTES AFTER WE ARRIVE!  So in theory, we could have just about been done eating our dinner by the time they finally addressed our problem.  We were then seated at a lovely table on the patio.  The food was good but the birthday spirit had deflated by then. And to top it off, they never offered anything for our trouble, such as a free hors d'oeuvre or a coupon for a subsequent visit.  NOTHING!  So we are done with this place."
Jordan M.,"Chicago, IL",123,39,,4.0,1/25/2009,"I'm giving four stars because of our server, Ian.  Without him, it probably would've been three. The food here was definitely good.  I got the Mesa Chicken, which I loved, and my boyfriend got the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp.  The downside was that the shrimp were supposed to be fairly spicy on their own, and he asked for the chef to make it extra spicy.  It ended up coming out completely lacking ANY spice.  We let our server, Ian, know that, and he went into the kitchen and asked the chef to make a serving of the sauce extra spicy, which he brought out in a bowl for us.  That was awesome, and it made the dish perfect.  We got the artichoke as an appetizer and it was alright; the sauces that came with it, though, were phenomenal.  I would order it again just for the sauces. All in all, I'd say it was a decent dining experience.  Yeah, there's a valet there, but who cares.  It's less than five bucks.  Get over it, people.  That parking lot isn't the biggest and if you had to self-park, you'd be bitching that there's no valet. Oh, one last note: if it's warm enough out, try and sit outside, especially at night.  There is a very nice ambience with the string lights overhead and the beach right there.  There are also space heaters that make it just as warm and cozy as if you were inside. Good stuff."
Gerard I.,"Pasadena, CA",501,806,351,4.0,11/7/2008,"I made a vow, a few years ago about the Cheesecake Factory restaurant chain. I'll never actively go to one of these restaurants to eat a meal, I don't give a fuck if I'm starving.  Living in Pasadena, I'm used to seeing the one located in Old Town, and the lemmings actually waiting 45 minutes to be seated. F-That.  Let's not get it twisted, either. 4 stars for the cakes.  I mentioned before, in my Jerry's Deli review"" that their cheesecake rules. Well, so does the Marina's (Cheesecake Factory) location. We went at night, and if you're not careful walking on the pier, it can look (or feel) like you're about to fall into the water. I was probably drunk, so that may have had something to do with.  It was crowded, but we ordered in advance, and took our cheesecake slices to go. I did notice, if you get a good enough seat, you'll sit right next to the water. Neat.  That's all I got."
Kristin K.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,326,13,2.0,6/1/2009,"Just like Jewelyn T, I come here a few times a year because I live close. Most of the time, it's because I've done something really incredible, like play tennis for 6 hours or had a photo shoot all day or something that would take all my energy out of me. Do I go to a spa? Do I got to a yoga class? Nope! I feed my face with All-American portions at the Cheesecake Factory (or Todai... you can read all about that in my review).  First off, mandatory valet parking is a necessary evil but it's also pretty annoying when you go at lunch on a weekday at a time when it is NOT busy and you watch the guy park your car 10 yards from you and then expects $4.50 to walk back and get it for you. I understand the need for mandatory valet at a place so busy like that but at some point it becomes ridiculous. When I go to the cheesecake factory, especially this one, I feel like cattle being herded around (maybe also because I'm going to be the size of one by the time I leave). Service is decent about 35% of the time. The rest of the time it's slow, my food has come out cold a few times, they can't cook a steak right (hey, if you're going to have a filet on the menu and ask me how I want it prepared, learn how to cook it!) and they've calculated the bill wrong or given us the wrong one and then take 30 minutes to fix it. I was going to give it 3-stars since it is OK and I seem to go back there, but the last few times I've gone is has been below average. I truly have experienced better. If you are looking for Cheesecake Factory portions, and even very similar menu items including the cheesecake, try Grand Luxe at the Beverly Center. They're part of the same company but with a more diverse menu."
