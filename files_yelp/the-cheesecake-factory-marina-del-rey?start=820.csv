Andrew Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",312,317,679,3.0,3/21/2011,"The food is ... well ... nothing to brag about. Of the locations I've been, this is my preferred. Wait has never been crazy. Tons of parking (valet). Great patio for those warm summer evenings. If craving a sugary sweet, the strawberry lemonade is fitting in a heat wave."
Lily P.,"Spokane, WA",63,329,53,4.0,5/17/2009,"Well this place gets so crowded and the property so small that you have to valet park. We were surprisingly seated right away, it was Cinco de mayo so I anticipate that everyone was at a Mexican restaurant instead. It was pretty full though and there were a lot of birthdays as the staff sang happy birthday 5 times during our dinner. Courses were better than usual, around the table we had: jambalaya, salad, flatiron steak and fries and I ordered off of their new mini appetizer menu which totally reminded me of what you would get at a tapas restaurant.  Appetizers I got were a spicy sausage with sun dried tomato and mashed potatoes - the sausage patties, though tasty, seemed incredibly undercooked so I only had a couple of bites then moved them around my plate so no one would try to convince me to return them - DH gave me a wonderful phobia of returning food since restaurant folk like to do nasty things to your food.  I also got parmesan stuffed dates wrapped in bacon which was good but would have been great if it were hot. Finished off with some coffee and their 30th anniversary cheesecake, which is my favorite.  Hostess took away a chair from our table though while someone was in the bathroom and didn't even ask and gave it to another table. Seriously, what's wrong with people?  Why are common sense things so difficult sometimes - hello service industry?  Oh, right - high school."

Brian D.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,29,1,5.0,3/8/2012,"Great food, service, and atmosphere. The Mai Tais were good, but not as good as Tony P's."
Mot Y.,"San Francisco, CA",275,675,101,1.0,10/20/2010,"This is utter crap and this location is dirty.  Why do so many people like this place?  The food is not good and they need to wipe the menus more often.  I came here with a few out of town guests and it was a pretty bad experience.  No one gives a crap about your needs.  Ughhh!  Big portions, but not the best quality."
ray j.,"Playa Del Rey, CA",77,22,,5.0,9/6/2010,"I have been to the Cheesecake Factory in the Marina more times than I can remember.  Before I got married, it was the ideal spot to impress a date with their delicious dinners, and to die for desserts.  The stunning view of the marina, and romantic outdoor atmosphere usually sealed the deal no matter how cynical my date was. Now that I'm married the CF is the perfect spot for date night or family night.  There are plenty of dishes that delight my young daughter, and my wife and I.  You can count on the service to range from good to excellent, and the desserts are still as mouth watering as ever.  Try the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer, and the chinese chicken salad for something light.  Their Kunf Pao chicken pasta is delicious if you crave some spice, and their steaks are never a disappointment.  The tiramisu is delicious, although you receive a tiny piece of it with mounds of whipped cream, and their cheesecake is, of course, a show stopper. Whether you go with a large group of friends, or with your significant other, the Cheesecake Factory in the Marina won't disappoint.  Just remember to bring a few dollars in cash for the valet!"
Robert B.,"Los Angeles, CA",166,74,,3.0,2/22/2011,"Of all of the cheesecake places this is one of my favorites I love dinning on the marina looking at all the boats-- love the large menu something for everyone, can't go wrong here  always a winner and a crowd pleaser.....large menu selection located in the marina with a great view of yatchs...............something or everyone all ages all genders.................love the cheesecake or sure.............."
Meenoy K.,"Venice, CA",19,10,6,3.0,10/1/2009,"I lunch with the ladies of Venice Beach on wednesdays at different local eateries and yesterday was a pleasant experience at the Cheesecake Factory.  It's always wonderful to eat overlooking the yachts and ships, and our hostess and waiters mades sure that we had a great view by making sure to move the tents and canopies.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas and lemondade (which was quite sweet but didn't stop me from refilling!) and the portions were large and filling, in fact there was too much food to eat and I doggy bagged half of the food for later.  I also noticed that my other five companions had leftovers also.  Here are my ratings: Service:  4 stars Taste:     3 stars Location: 4 stars Price:     3 stars Overall we all had a nice time :-)"
Truth M.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,70,54,5.0,12/17/2010,Took my BREATH AWAY!!!! The view was amazing and the service was nice!!!FOOD IS OVER PRICED BUT GOOD!! beach front property!!! 5 feet away from the beach!!!!
Val B.,"Honolulu, HI",12,129,3,4.0,10/7/2011,"Probably one of my most memorable visits to a Cheesecake Factory ever!   Although it was quite busy, the hostess offered my friends and I a seat at the bar and some appetizers for the 20 minutes before our outdoor table was ready.  It was too beautiful a day at 60 degrees to pass up such a gorgeous view of the marina, people running, and biking.  The service was impeccable, the food was scrumptious, and the company was excellent.  I've returned once since my original visit and will go back again when I'm in town.  I hold off on my local Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki so I can savor my next visit to the Marina del Rey location."
Patrick K.,"Torrance, CA",1,32,2,1.0,1/7/2011,"Worst Cheesecake factory ever!  Always overcrowded, way too loud, and the service is spotty at best.  I come to cheesecake because they're usualy consistently good wherever you go, but this one just isn't up to par."
Andee T.,"Venice, CA",92,89,2,4.0,8/2/2011,All the times I've gone there Ive always had a great experience.  I've only been to this one.  I love how it overlooks the sand and they have heaters outside.  My cocktail was a little on the strong side but that shouldn't be a complaint.  Just ask your server for more juice.  Drink your juice Shelby.
Chris B.,"Los Angeles, CA",330,238,34,4.0,5/6/2011,Not my favorite CF locale.  The harbor beach is depressing and kinda gross.  The food was just as good as all other locations.
Ashley B.,"South Gate, CA",139,169,13,5.0,12/16/2010,"Of all the Cheesecake Factories I've been too, this is definitely my favorite, mostly because the view is amazing, especially at night! It sits on the Harbor and just looks so beautiful when all the lights reflect off the water. The waiters are nice and the place is definitely lit for the romantic ambience and sitting outside is always a nice option, and I think it's one of the few Cheesecake Factories, with outdoor seating, I know the one in Brentwood does too, but it lacks the view that this one has."
Maureen M.,"Azusa, CA",191,219,224,4.0,7/11/2009,"I think everyone either likes the Cheesecake Factory or they don't.  I like it because the menu is so extensive that there is bound to be something for everyone; even the pickiest eaters can find something. My favorite Cheesecake Factory restaurant so far though is the one in Marina del Rey, CA.  I love to go there and sit out on the patio.  The view is wonderful.  Pair it with the great food and it makes any day an amazing day."
Amanda C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/7/2014,"i went over there quite few times and last week was my last time, never go back , it looks they are so busy and they don't care any more about their customer , yes the location is nice with a great view but the table are so small and  close to each other that the waiter was standing in top of our head to get the order from the table next to us and serving their food passing  our face , our server looks he is not happy no smile at all , their food and their service  is not good as it used to be , so why should i waist my money ? yes they are just considering to make more money and they are such a big company that they don't care about their customer , zero star"
Big L.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,242,397,4.0,8/27/2013,sit outside! get a buncha small plates.
Theodore W.,"Clawson, MI",19,78,,4.0,8/26/2008,"Finally got to eat at a Cheesecake Factory. Being from Detroit, which is by far the largest metro area in America without one (even though the family that founded it is from Detroit and had a cheesecake bakery here), I had to try it. The $28.95 Appetizer Combo was spectacular, especially if you have a party of four or more (or want to eat it with just dessert). Everything on it was delicious and quickly finished off.  They have Fresca!!! As a diet pop drinker, it is so cool when a restaurant has more than Diet Coke. Cheeseburger in Paradise is the only other chain I know of that has Fresca on tap. The entrees were very good. I had the hibachi steak which was nicely done, with wasabi mashed potatoes and fried asparagus...... Was so stuffed, could not eat any cheesecake....Will come back again though!"
Sherri B.,"Las Vegas, NV",466,347,72,4.0,7/14/2008,"As time goes on, i have noticed that this place keeps getting more and more crowded.  Be prepared to wait.   Funny thing is, i don't particularly like cheesecake.   However, they have the largest menu of any restaurant i know of (except for Jerry's Deli).  So Im sure you'll find something you like.  All the food I have ever ordered has been great.  No matter what. On my last visit i decided to try something new.  I ordered a delish Hawaiian Salad.  What a treat.  Of course, I had to wash down the salad with a piece of chocolate cake (a la mode, of course) - yummy yummy in the tummy. I heart Cheesecake Factory . . .i don't care how ghetto fabulous the peeps are."
Jennifer E.,"Long Beach, CA",0,7,1,5.0,11/20/2011,"Yum!  Their new 'Skinnylicious' menu rocks... Our server was friendly and funny and very attentive.  Definitely recommend to anyone wanting some quality food, good service & fun ambiance."
