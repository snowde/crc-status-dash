Denise N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,1.0,5/14/2014,"If I could give a negative rating I would give it -4. I've been going to this place for 10 years now and have never had such horrible service, dirty food, and just overall dissatisfaction with this place. Our entrees were bland. The neighbors dog didn't even want the doggie bag I brought home and he eats everything.  Our server was a bit absent minded but we all have off days so I was willing to cut him some slack. However when they brought the second cocktail I ordered which came with a strawberry there was a finger nail in the strawberry. Which the server didn't even catch and I had to flag him down to show him this disgusting sight which made us both not want to finish our meals. The server informed Mark the manager who came over to our table and was so insincere that is was a wonder he even bothered to come over to the table at all. If your don't care that your customers get served finger nails than it might be time to find a new job. The best he said he could do for serving us a finger nail in our food was to comp us that drink. Seriously that's the best you can do for  serving us dirty food which turned our stomachs! I won't ever be going back nor will I ever recommend or buy any more gift cards for family and friends for this place."
Annie k.,"Burbank, CA",0,11,,5.0,3/19/2012,Five stars why mhmm?..... I love this place they have probably the best food i have ever tryed yum!

FOOD is great check this place out u will love it.
mary k.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,5.0,3/9/2012,OK so I realize we all love cheese cake factory but this location in particular is the one to go to for all my West LA peeps.  I've been here several times and the food/drinks always live up to the high cheese cake factory standards.  BUT what sets this location apart from all the other is I have never waiting more than 20 minutes to sit the and the view of the marina is literally a million dollar view. Even if its a little chilly out the heat lamps keep the outside deck very comfortable.
karen l.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,13,,5.0,2/16/2011,"**self-parking is around the corner (make sure you buy your ticket at the  kiosk because parking enforcement comes around). don't pay for valet!! (they're rude anyways and don't need my $$!) i have been to the cheesecake factory many times and love it every time! (especially the godiva cheesecake. yum yum!) i went in with my girlfriends the other nite and had an exceptional time! our server made our nite! he definitely knows his stuff and does it with such ease! he was funny, entertaining and his eyes were nice to look at too! :) If you want a good server, ask for ""T"" (Tremaine) **and DON'T FORGET TO TIP YOUR SERVERS!!!! I can't stress this enough! tip AT LEAST 20%. servers work hard and live off their tips.  I can't believe some people complain to the managers about having to tip or leave less than $5. i think this is very rude!  be patient if your order isn't ready. i've worked in restaurants before and always make sure to take care of my server."
Lindsay N.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2014,"It takes a lot to disappoint me and this was the worst dining experience I have ever had! I asked for patio seating got stuck right next to the door where all the servers come in and out. Ordered our food and drinks, appetizers came out fairly quickly and that is where it stopped. Almost 2 identical meals ordered mine came out on its own .. About 10 minutes went by no meal for my husband.. He goes to restroom and waitress comes over and says they gave his meal to the wrong table! Said they were remaking his meal and that a manager would be by to speak to my husband when he got back to the table ... That never happened no one apologized that I was eating and he had no meal after about an hour his meal came which was steak Diane which is NOT supposed to be spicy! I think they dumped the whole bottle of pepper in it! He is now home getting sick and the waitress knowing his meal was out much later than mine came over and said let me clear these plates away for you! Did not even ask If he was finished! Horrible horrible service and I will never go back! Shame on you Cheesecake! No apology no money taken off bill and to top it off it was my Birthday! We got the check as fast as we could paid the valet and left!"
Robyn B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",5,23,3,3.0,8/14/2013,"I had spent about a week planning my boyfriend's birthday. He really wanted to come to this specific Cheesecake Factory even though there is one closer to us. I reserved the table and everything was great...until our waiter came to our table. Not that I'm a huge stickler for the small stuff but you know the yummy bread they bring out? It was sooooo cold!! But it's ok. We figured it was slow anyways. Then the waiter seemed like he had a perpetual attitude with our table. There were 11 of us and he was obviously going to get tipped well...I didn't see what his deal was. It took him 20 minutes to refill our waters. He couldn't figure out how to split the check in a timely fashion (we had another reservation we had to make on time) and again, stemmed to be upset with our table. Plus.... You HAVE to have your car in valet and pay for it...when I could have parked it myself?! Ugh! I probably won't come back to this one."
Rebecca C.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,51,47,5.0,7/3/2011,"Love the chinese chicken salad at cheesecake factory. The bread and butter is by far the best part of the dining experience (plus the cheesecake I take to-go). It can get busy, so I would avoid this place on holidays, etc"
Kristopher V.,"Venice, CA",128,349,149,3.0,3/3/2011,I don't care for the food at all. I do enjoy going to this particular location with friends to sit outdoors and drink green iced tea.
Doug G.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",17,126,7,2.0,8/11/2013,"I live in Marina del Rey and want to like the Cheesecake Factory but every time I go the food is bland and a big disappointment.  The one exception is the Cheesecake, which is exceptional.  The outside dining area is also a big draw given outdoor dining in and around LA is nearly non-existent."
Jennifer N.,"Long Beach, CA",444,1095,12255,2.0,5/5/2010,"How could a Cheesecake Factory be only a 2 stars??!! I've been here a few times and every time I decide to give this location another try, I get disappointed... on the CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  I've even done a third party Mystery Secret Shopping/dinning at this location before for corporate @ this location always sends assignments out, because I'm sure reviews from the Mystery diners are not that great either!  I'm not too thrilled on this location to begin with. The Location is hard to locate and even a GPS gets confused.. lol  It's a smaller Cheesecake restaurant, But it seems like the setting of the restaurant just didn't seem right. The Kitchen is in the front left side of the restaurant and located between the entrance of the restaurant between a very small and tight pathway and the hostess table where customers checks in. People walking and stopping in between this short walkway bumping heads and feet.  The Kitchen's counter top is where the chefs put the plates of food out for the waiters to serve. It is on a low level, reachable counter. With customers and employees walking in and out, I can just imagine the dusts and germs flying all over the food. When we were walking out of the restaurant, I witnessed this guy sneezing. Didn't cover his mouth and a plate of salad is left there on the counter where his saliva probably flew into the salad. :-( GROSS!!  Here goes our journey..  Pulled into the parking lot and parked by the the cleaners. The valet guy comes over and screamed, That's pay parking! I said excuse me sir? he said, ""Paid Parkin, I said.""  I gave him the $3.50 he asked for and he didn't give me a ticket. I asked for a ticket and he said no need. How the heck do you charge me for Valet parking and don't put a ticket on my car. What if another valet driver don't see the ticket and get my car towed??? There was another car that pulled in. Obviously he had a complaint too because We were both waiting on the Manager to come talk to us.  We spoke to the manager and she apologized behalf of the valet service and just explained that each location and city has their own parking policies. Fine, I respected that. So then she went out right away to tell the Valet service guy!! .. Uh, wait a minute, should I leave, what if they do damaged to my car out of anger.. sigh...  (You see, the Redound Beach location where I go to most of the time has a small parking spaces for handicap parkings, take outs and a few limited regular parking spots for people who doesn't want to pay for valet parking. Marina Del Rey has those parking spots too, but they choose to charge their customers for the parking. )  While being served, Our server wasn't too thrilled about the fact we wanted refills on their bread. Well, sometimes, I go there for their delicious bread, but not like we didn't order any main dishes. We did!!  The water with lemon the waiter served us, 2 out of 5 cups tasted funny.. There was a goat cheese like after taste in my water!! My Mother said the same thing about her cup of water. We called the waiter and nicely asked him if he can exchange the water for us. I even showed him the greasy residue that was left on our cups. He said sure and walked off like we bothered him. NO Sorry?.. NO, explanations?.. NO excuse us for not washing our cups clean enough!! We were NOT difficult customers and even try not to bother him too much. He wasn't as friendly as I expected it to be, because I have high expectations of friendliness customer service from them. Well consider me spoiled by the other Cheesecake Factory locations. If something like this would happened, a manager would of showed up at our table with the waiter and apologized behalf of their business.  What do you expect when you go to Cheesecake Factory?? Great food and Beyond Great friendly Customer service, because that is what they are known for and that is what I usually get when I go to their other locations.  Sadly to say, I will never return to this location again... EVER!"
Ryan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,4,,4.0,2/2/2012,"They have the best chinese chicken salad. whenever i come to the cheesecake factory, I get this because the dressing is so tangy. Once I get something I like I keep ordering it. Also I really like this location, because unlike other Cheesecake factories, this one isnt a total zoo. Crowded, but not overwhelming."
Terrilyn B.,"Rockwall, TX",4,11,,5.0,7/28/2011,"I'm from Texas and go to the Cheesecake Factory every now and then there. This one blows the ones I've been to out of the water. Its beautiful, sits on the water and eating outside on a nice afternoon is amazing. The food is great much better than at any other Cheesecake Factory I've been to and the service is even better. If you're looking for a great night out; here is where you want to be."
Celinda A.,"Long Beach, CA",250,142,398,4.0,9/4/2010,This cheesecake factory has thee best view. It's right next to the marina. Always busy too.
Rosario C.,"Santa Monica, CA",17,45,40,5.0,4/8/2011,"I LOVE this place! Drinks, food and cheesecake are amazing! After going to Vegas I couldn't find a strawberry daiquiri as good as I had there, Cheesecake came super close and that sealed the deal for me! Not to mention their delicious Georgia Peach! A MUST try!"
Lad D.,"Chelsea, MA",26,22,6,2.0,5/15/2011,"So I meet up with good friends for Sunday brunch. They order 'real' food and I order a salad. Surprisingly, their food comes out first and is beginning to get cold as I wait for my salad. Eventually it comes out, ten minutes later. The manager comps the salad. As I'm down to my last bite, I notice there is something coarse and somewhat crunchy. I pull the object out of my mouth and it's a piece of spiraled green plastic with some sharp edges. Of course I call for the manager. A different one comes out and gives the perfunctory apology and the ""if there's anything that I can do"" line. To top off the experience, Xavier (3 years old) didn't get his ice cream sundae as we were eating our comped cheesecakes.I was more surprised than disappointed with this Cheesecake Factory"
Kathie B.,"Cheviot Hills, CA",4,6,,4.0,12/13/2009,"What I like most is the abundance of choices on the menu. It's been an easy place to visit with family and friends since there's several styles of food to choose from. I've had ribs (loved them), orange chicken (I order this most often), and quite a few salads (saves room for cheesecake). If you're not needing to impress anyone and have concerns about the valet service, there's a large county parking lot within walking distance by Mothers Beach. Parking there is about 6 bucks. On warm summer days this place can be extremely packed and waiting is likely on nice summer evenings (especially weekends). There is food service in the bar (if you're not wanting to wait for a dining area table) and service there has been fine every time we've opted for it. Save room for desert (or plan to bring some home), it's what the Cheesecake Factory is famous for."
Dana L.,"Los Angeles, CA",184,121,164,4.0,4/13/2008,"Who serves pad thai with regular wheat spaghetti noodles? A while back they served it with rice noodles, but I guess they made the change so they wouldn't have to make a separate pasta base -- with all the stuff on their menu it seems they can be overwhelmed at times. Having said that, I'm giving them 4 stars just for their sweet corn tamale cakes and miso salmon. YUM! These two items alone are worth the long wait and loud atmosphere."
Tiffany G.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,27,10,5.0,8/18/2008,"LOOOVE LOOOOOVE LLLOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEE this restaurant!! Not only is the cheescake factory without a doubt my favorite restaurant (and there are tons of reasons why), but the location is great! Its sits on the sandy front of the marina del rey harbor, with a nice jungle gym for the kids to play on while you wait for your table (or after dinner). Yes, expect to wait, especially on weekend nights. But just enjoy the scenery and the crowd, and in no time you will be sitting down to enjoy the best food ever. The food is amazing, the selection is huge, and the portions are even bigger! And for how much food you get for your buck, the prices are VERY reasonable! The drinks are good, The service is always very friendly, the pre-meal bread is yummy, and all the appetizers are delicious. Actually, I have never eaten anything at the cheesecake that hasn't been up to standard. LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!!"
Paula D.,"Flagstaff, AZ",129,463,209,4.0,2/20/2011,"The bill arrived and I think my BFF said ""I think we drank our weight in champagne"" cause I was a bit tipsy and the lounge was loud. We arrived to a packed factory thinking, ""Everybody and their mama is out today in this rain."" We ordered the spinach dip, jumbalaya shrimp, and ahi tuna carpaccio. Along with lots of bubbly. Next time we should just order the big bottle. My only complaint was my first drink order which was the raspberry martini. Now I know when to expect the alcohol to hit me and my glass was half empty and nothing, nada, zilch. It might as well be blended grape juice. I told the waiter who offered me a different drink and I switched to the champagne. Lovely rainy Saturday."
Sara C.,"Bellevue, WA",246,362,89,4.0,4/11/2011,"What can't you love about this place!  The menu has such a huge selection and can please all tastes.  Great drinks, great desserts and the food in general is great.  Every neighborhood needs a Cheesecake Factory."
