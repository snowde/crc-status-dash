Dana P.,"North Hills, CA",65,299,28,2.0,2/3/2009,"I am a HUGE fan of Cheesecake Factory, but I have to shun this location. First, I do not like forced valet, but whatever.  I can deal with that. Ambience is nice.  It's right on the water, which is nice, but can get really cold if it's not sunny out. The last couple of times I have been to this particular location, I have been disappointed.   Had a completely incompetent server.  He didn't know what ""top shelf"" meant, and that alarmed me.  Not a big deal, my mom's boyfriend just todl him that the bartender would know.  He insisted that we explain what top shelf meant.  LoL.   Theeeeeeeen...he forgot one of our appetizers, and when I brought it up to him, he told me that I didn't order it or that I ordered it from someone else.  I had 3 others with me who can attest to the fact that I DID order two appetizers. He was pretty much MIA throughout our dining experience, not that I wanted to interact with him much after our rocky start. My other experience was coming here for brunch.  We were seated in a booth in a corner.  I happened to look up at the wall and there were tiny fruit flies all over the wall.  GROSS.  Appetite pretty much lost at that point. This used to be a really good location, but I just can't bring myself to go back. I'll stick with the Brentwood location if I am on this side of the hill.  In the valley, I'd go with the Sherman Oaks or Woodland Hills location."

Brittany N.,"Bozeman, MT",206,374,61,4.0,5/17/2010,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory--they have tons of delicious options and everything I've had has been delicious! The location of this Cheesecake Factory is as good as it gets. It's right in the marina and has a large outdoor patio with lights and heating lamps. It is absolutely beautiful at night. The hostess that sat us was very sweet and was informing me of the future changes at the restaurant (a new menu at the outdoor section of the restaurant). The only reason for four stars instead of five was because our server was not very good. She was not very friendly and she was more preoccupied with reading a text message from a friend's phone who was also sitting near us than actually being a waitress. We all have our days, and I understand that, but it was a bit annoying!"
Maria H.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,18,,3.0,3/25/2009,"I think overall is OK, best thing sitting outside looking at the Marina. Nothing fancy, I just go to pig out on dessert, a cheese cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce, and that's it!! Not the best cheesecake I tried, not the worst. We always go pretty late so the sitting is not a problem, the service was always good. But I can understand the people complaining about long waits because earlier is madness, full of cars and people even waiting outside. Never tried anything else but cheesecake so I do not really know how the meals are. Comparing with the other Cheese cake Factory I went on The Groove, this is better in my opinion, better sitting and better service."
Smivey ..,"Playa del Rey, CA",135,69,26,1.0,10/7/2006,"This has got to be the most overrated restaurant in L.A. I've been here only once and it was for a work event. In other words, I had no say in the matter.  When I arrived, I was a little shocked to see a red ""C"" displayed in the front window. To some, a red ""C"" means it's still OK to eat there. To me, it means ""We don't give a shit."" In any case, like I said, I had no say in the matter.  And what's with those menus? I'm an old fashioned guy.  I think that if you're going to charge so much money for mediocre food, you should be able to provide a menu that doesn't have advertising in it. Lose the ads, Cheesecake Factory. It's tacky.  That said, they do give you a lot of food here. More food than I would care to consume in one sitting. But that's what makes it such a good value, right? Uh, no. It's still overpriced. And definitely not worth waiting over an hour for.  The Cheesecake Factory sucks."
Nicole B.,"San Pedro, CA",105,14,3,1.0,4/10/2014,"We go to Cheesecake Factory quite often. We like to try different ones around the area and they have all been amazing, except this one . First we sat outside since it was a nice evening , just two of us , kind of ruined when they split our table and had another two top literally right next to us. We had no privacy and feel we couldn't talk to eachother. Second , we order the rib eyes at every Cheesecake Factory . Always med rare and always comes out perfect. Not today! Mine was more med well to well done (wayyyy over cooked for a rib eye) , now I work as a server and I know it's not the servers fault , but it is when you constantly check on the two top next to is and not us to see if our steaks came out okay. I usually like a1 with my mashed potatoes she never came back for me to ask. We are nice enough to not complain but we sat there with our well done steaks and empty drinks ( we wanted more drinks $ ) and she only came by to ask us if we wanted boxes. Never got an ask if the steaks were okay or if we wanted more drinks. Unacceptable service here. We will just stick to the one in redondo beach. Thanks anyways marina del Rey will never come back to this one."
Cheris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",89,17,1,4.0,6/13/2011,I love the Cheesecake factory. This one is really crowded and the parking lot is valet only. Not super easy to get too and when there is a wait it is really jammed up. On the brighter side it has a great patio.
Sai D.,"Carson, CA",5,47,50,4.0,7/14/2010,We always get great service whenever my friends (or coworkers) and I come here. I like their menu since there's ALWAYS a lot of things to choose from and they also have daily specials that the waitstaff tells you as you get seated. Dining outside is always a plus since weather and view are both nice. I like their spicy peanut dressing on the house salad and the pineapple upside down cheesecake is heavenly :)
Karen K.,"Los Angeles, CA",263,181,25,4.0,9/12/2007,"This is the Cheesecake Factory with the best view in LA. What's better than enjoying a nice dinner outside with a marina view? The food is standard Cheesecake Factory. Service is good and fast.  The only downside (and why I'm subtracting one star) is the valet. I hate valet because we have to pay. My husband hates valet because he hates anybody else touching his car. However there's no way out of valet since there's nowhere else to park. So 4 stars for you, Cheesecake!"
Tommy E.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,15,,2.0,12/5/2013,"Food here is standard, nothing too outstanding. The line is long and when you finally get seated the tables are so jam packed together you're about 8 inches from strangers and that makes it a very uncomfortable arrangement.  After ordering a steak and salad, the steak arrived first and did not recive my bar drink till I was done eating. I'd pass on this place."
Gail H.,"Eugene, OR",309,66,20,4.0,11/11/2006,"Why does everyone give this restaurant such a bad rap?  Granted, they shouldn't put ads in their menu, and there is usually a long line of hungry tourists ahead of you, but you do get good-sized portions of a variety of  tasty food for a fair price.     I went with a friend for lunch today and - surprisingly - had no wait at all.  It was another gorgeous day in paradise, so we were seated on the patio.  I hadn't been here for some time, but  I already knew what I wanted.  You know how when you find something you love, you just can't wait to get back and order it again??  Well, that's how I feel about the Fried Chicken Salad that CCF *used* to have.  Bummer.   After perusing their extensive new menu,  I selected the Barbecued Ranch Chicken Salad and I enjoyed it, but it didn't compare to the salad I planned to eat.   Two other favorites:  Avocado Egg rolls and Thai Lettuce Wraps.  I sometimes order either one of these as an entree.  Outstanding!!   Marina del Rey location has a great view of Mother's Beach and they've recently replaced all of their patio glass window panes dividing the restaurant from the beach.  Much nicer!  You can actually see through the panes now.  The old Plexiglas panes were so scratched and dull that it was unattractive. Of course, their desserts are famous, delicious and decadent.  I don't usually indulge in the sweets after dinner.  No room...their meals fill me up.   You must valet park, unless you have a friend who lives in the neighborhood.  Lucky me...I just walk there.  :)"
Richard R.,"Oakland, CA",609,214,4258,4.0,7/26/2007,"It's always crowded, but the food is good..They have improved the seating , which has helped...went there recently when I was down for in LA.  And yes, is it over hyped, of course, but the food is still good. If you are going to go, make sure that you are ready for a wait...and just don't stress about it...you don't come here for fast food, you come here to people watch and to be watched..no really, you come for some decent tasty food that they duplicate at all of their restaurants.... Enjoy...and nothing beats plain cheese cake with whip cream....i know, I'm simple."
Vincent I.,"Los Angeles, CA",49,95,1,3.0,6/6/2012,"dinner with the family here last night. party of 8. went at 6.30 pm on a tuesday night, crowded for sure, the menue items are priced right to get the customers in. unfortunately we were seated in the back of the room, against the wait station. i am sure its because we were a large group, but the staff constantly gathered here and we could hardly hear ourselves talk. constant traffic into the little staff room and bumpung, unintentional against the chairs. one basket of bread was dropped off for a table of 8, had to ask for more and waited a bit. the food we ordered came, entrees were as described on the menue. shepard pie was a really good choice, some of the pasta dishes were great , the 4 cheese pasta was a good portion, but a large glop of cheese stuck the noodles to the bottom of the plate, the soup salad, sandwich entree was a good presentation. we tried to order a regular soup for my wife who's diet is a bit restricted, not an option. the soups we were offered all had spice, cream, chili. no plain chicken or beef soup. we opted for a side order of pasta with butter. the side was 10.00? we had margaritas, m=ine was watery, bland tasteless, if there was booze it missed the glass, not worth 10.50. overall everyone was just ok with the experience. basic service, took a while to get the table bussed of the bread plates and dirty dishes. we will return, we always give you guys more chances, as we have had better experiences."
Lendy L.,"Denver, CO",136,333,83,3.0,10/26/2010,"A 3.5 star to be more exact.  Food at Cheese Cake factory is always tasty and good. I've never had any bad experience with the various restaurants I've been to.  Food is always flavorful, rich and yummy.  Plates are huge as always and can be shared by two people who have moderate appetites.  I've always had appetizers as my meals and the yummy various lemonade flavors!  This particular Cheese Cake was the nicer restaurants I've been to because it faces the marina which gives a serene romantic vibe.  I would attend again with friends or family.  Valet is $4.50 and there really isn't anywhere else to park.  That is the only downside to this Cheesecake factory."
David G.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,26,,5.0,1/1/2011,"When you go a cheesecake factory you pretty much know what you're going to get, so it's really all about the service. We came here twice recently and it was fantastic service both times. Minimal wait times as well. We were staying at a local hotel and parking seemed to be an issue with the restaurant, but you could park in the public lot down the street and walk along the beach to get to the cheesecake really easily."
Chris L.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,38,,3.0,5/20/2008,"If you're visiting the Marina area, it'd be a shame to waste your money here. There are overwhelming numbers of solid places in the Marina -- look around.  It's what you'd expect. Certainly over-priced, but you're kind of paying for the name and the atmosphere.  If you get sucked into a group outing to the place -- which is likely, then get a big salad -- they do good salads. Other than that, the food is just average."
Emma L.,"San Diego, CA",0,42,8,4.0,12/5/2010,"I don't typically write reviews for chain restaurants but I really had to for this one. I've gone to several Cheesecake Factories in several cities but this one stands out. This restaurant by far had the friendliest employees! When we were leaving the restaurant, nearly every single worker from cooks to the bakery staff, greeted us on our way out! What a fun way to leave a restaurant? The food is good, of course. I came for brunch and the French Toast Napolean ($10.95) was delicious. It consists of 3 fat pieces of French toast with tons of strawberries in between and candied pecans!! I was pretty hungover so I wasn't able to finish it but I had some later in the evening and it was even better? I guess its one of those things that are better a little cold.. haha My bf ordered the Chicken Marcel Blanc. You get 2 large pieces of flattened, crispy chicken breast, huge serving of mashed potatoes, and some broccoli. Good deal for $12.95.  Strawberry Lemonade is sort of a rip-off at $4.50 since most of the glass consists of ice. Its free re-fills but still, $4.50? We had 3 glasses of it total but take out the ice and it still wouldn't have been one full glass. Red Robin's Strawberry Lemonade is way better too.  Their bread is delicious too. I don't know how but the waitress just knew we wanted only the wheat bread so we just had baskets of amazing wheat bread. The patio has a great view of the dock too. Definitely a pleasure to sit outside!  The only downside is that our waiter was sort of whatever so our service was a bit slow. All the other employees I spoke with were ridiculously nice and incredibly friendly though. Everyone from the bakery, the server who brought our meal, etc so I wouldn't put the bad service as a deal breaker since everyone else was so nice. My waiter probably was just having a bad day? Definitely worth a visit."
Shannon M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,22,,4.0,10/8/2011,"I love Cheesecake Factory, and this one is stunning! On the water and delicious. It can be romantic or fun or family friendly! The perfect place to satisfy everyone's craving..... The only problem? With its HUge menu ut's just so hard to choose!!"
Ebony B.,"Hawthorne, CA",50,15,2,3.0,4/26/2011,Food is good. Servings are large prices are ok. Senary makes it worth it!!! Cheescake is THE BEST!!!
Andrea I.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,35,2,2.0,8/10/2007,"What the eff. Why does it take so long to eat here? It seems like such a corporate-type place, so you would think that they might kind of understand my need to be back in my office within, oh, I dunno, say 2.5 hours? Why does a meal at the Cheesecake Factory always turn into a 3 hour affair?  I hate how they have ads in their menu. I hate how their menu is longer than most magazines. I hate how there's so much mediocre food on their menu that it takes my companions 12 hours to decide what they want. The food there is actually pretty reliable. It doesn't taste bad. It's enough for two meals (although I usually don't want to eat it twice.) I like the chicken piccatta and the bang-bang chicken and shrimp-- if only for the name. It's a decent standby, but I'd usually rather eat.... well... anywhere else."
