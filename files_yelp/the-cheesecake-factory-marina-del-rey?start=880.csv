Rim B.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,103,,2.0,6/27/2011,"First I want to say this review does not reflect the actual cheesecakes - they are usually pretty good.  But the food here is a joke.  Their menu is so large and unfocused that they can't seem to get one thing right.  Hey, guys - if your menu is longer than Lord of the Rings, you've got serious problems!  Add to that inconsistency and mounds of salt, and you have a really expensive preamble to a pretty decent dessert experience."
Kelly S.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,64,1,2.0,5/7/2008,"I've been here a few times, but only now am I beginning to realize that the Cheesecake Factory is very overpriced. The food is good, sure. It's even manufacturedly exotic at times. But it's not great. My $40 bill for a Cesar salad, half of some crappy calamari, and a glass of wine demands better quality. And at the end of the day, the Factory is just a dolled chain with a menu similar to CPK and P.F. Changs. They are all owned by the same company, after all. I'm tired of the Cheesecake Factory allowing people to think themselves cultured."
Sara B.,"Venice, CA",1,5,,5.0,6/27/2011,"I've been there for my husband birthday and I was impressed for sugar free cheesecake and the ambience. Can't believe, it's amazing. I'd go there once a week, if I could......loved it"
Keisha H.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,258,170,4.0,1/17/2010,"I hope that if I have to die eating in a restaurant it will be at the Factory...lol SO food was great.  Server was nice as hell. Gave us free soup. Food was delish. BUT HERE IT IS. What the hell with the Ghetto ASS Hostess at this location. I rarely go to this one cuz honestly as *Mad Niggerish* as I am this one is rather Ghetto. LOL!!! Lets just break her down. Chewing gum and looking hoodfantastic. She had a silky pinkish head wrap on cuz she had a short hair cut and you could tell she needed a touch up.( CUT AND PERM)  The naps was falling out the back!! Then you know they have to wear all black. She had on a black blouse and black Dickie Shorts! For real with the Dickie logo for all the world to see!!! She had on those black ballet looking shoes that I hate. Cuz they look so cheap and lazy. My lady has some. I try to hide them shits every chance I get!!! I was just totally thrown by that. LOL!!! I am just saying the host is the first person you see and she did not represent what CCF is to me. I love that place, so many great memories!!  There were other suspect patrons in there like this skinny ass white couple who complained about everything they received. QUIT FUCKING NAGGING AND EAT AND MAYBE YOU WOULD GAIN SOME WEIGHT!!!! No man should be able to cross his legs like that....LOL!!!! Anyway I will stop. I know I will be back, Shit its the Factory!!!!"
Cleo M.,"Oakland, CA",109,144,5,3.0,2/19/2007,"Went here for my birthday. We tried to avoid eating outside because it was cold and looked rainy but with a party of 15, atleast a hour wait and a reservation not honored we couldn't avoid it. I got the shrimp skillet pasta; I don't know the exact name but it's in white sauce with lemon something flavors. Service was great; I enjoyed my food but I think had a little more fun swinging at the playground on the pier. Ladies if you have to use the bathrooms it's a long wait with two stalls plus they have a bathroom on the bottom by the firepit but its is  hideous and disgusting - I thought it was a horror movie."
Liz K.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,187,12,5.0,6/25/2010,"During my last visit to The Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey I received some of the most amazing customer service of my life. This place can be a mad house during the dinner rush, but its usually well worth the hassle. The staff definitely goes out of their way to make your experience positive and pleasurable.  After being told that the wait for a table was an hour and a half we were directed to the downstairs beach side patio, where we could order drinks while we waited. This waiting patio is a GENIUS idea! No one likes to sit in the cramped lobby of a restaurant next to 30 other families awkwardly waiting to be seated. This patio was not crowded at all, was right near the water with beautiful views of the boats in the marina, and being able to order cocktails definitely makes the time go by faster. The cocktails at Cheesecake are some of the best Ive ever tasted, my favorites being The Ritz or the Peach Bellini. It's super easy to rack up a significant bill before you even get to eat dinner.  Once we were seated we asked for extra bread due to the number of people in our party, a request which the waiter quickly fulfilled, bringing us enough of that delicious brown bread for a lifetime. MMMM brown bread = so good! We all ordered our entrees and continued sipping on our beverages and munching on bread until the food arrived. I ordered the Chicken Medallions, which, in my opinion, is one of the healthier options they have (they feature A LOT of pasta and carb loaded dishes). The waiter either heard me wrong or wrote down the wrong thing, so I received the Chicken Madeira instead, which is delicious in its own right, but just not what I had ordered. I informed him of the problem and he apologized and quickly ran to the kitchen to correct the mistake. Upon returning he offered me a salad or soup on the house while I waited for the correct dish to be prepared. I asked for baby greens with balsamic, which was totally yummy and distracted me from the fact that all my friends were eating their food while I was still waiting for mine. Then TWO different managers came by our table to apologize some more, and they offered to buy me another Ritz martini on the house as well. I have never experienced such amazing customer service in my life! My food was ready in a reasonable amount of time, especially considering the snafu, and I got a free salad and drink out of the deal. I couldnt really ask for anything more. Thank you to Anthony, our lovely waiter, and to the management of Cheesecake Factory Marina Del Rey for going out of their way to ensure I had a good experience."
Paul A.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1329,162,35,4.0,6/17/2008,"Now I live close so I have been here a bunch. The outside  appearance is beautiful. You can look out or sit outside with a very nice marina water view and they have heat lamps for the girls.  The inside appearance is good, but a bit loud. For the price it's awesome, large portions. ;-) The wait service was excellent and very friendly.   The food was very good, now this isn't a high class place but again for the price you can't beat it. Now Linda's Fudge Cake with Ice Cream is my favorites. If I had to pick a negative the bathrooms were not the cleanest.  ;-("
Gail L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,52,1,3.0,8/17/2010,"Ate there Sunday night, and it had been several years since I've been to any of their restaurants.   My overall response   ""meh"" The menu, as always was huge.  Maybe because I'm eating differently (aka healthier), but the menu choices didn't seem as appealing as they had in the past.  I finally decided on the chicken marsala, which was good.  Unfortunately, my husband did not like his fish and chips - so much so that he didn't even want to get it wrapped to take home.   Frankly, the service was just not up to par.  Our server, Justin, was friendly enough, but he didn't come back to our table often enough to check how things were going.  One of my dining partners just wanted a refill on a coke, but was unable to get it. The vanilla bean cheesecake was very good.  Was definitely the best part of the meal. Overall, I think that my food tastes have changed, because the visit just didn't have the delicious excitement that it had in the past. Too bad."
Allison L.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,174,1,2.0,11/7/2006,"This is a chain restaurant - so you should know what you're getting yourself into going in. The only benefit about the Marina location is that it is on the water, which is nice, but can get chilly at night and I have never been sat anywhere inside where you can actually view the water. This place is ALWAYS packed, the parking lot is LITERALLY a parking lot, even as you're trying to leave, and as far as I can tell, you HAVE to valet, even though you could easily park your car yourself. Expect a wait here, no matter what. As has been said, the food is mediocre. Any place that gives you a choice of ANYTHING (Mexican, Italian, American, Asian) is clearly unfocused and anything you order comes out as such. I have only dinned here because I was with a group of friends and the only reason I had a decent time was because of the company I was with. Oh, and they make decent drinks and duh, the cheesecake is really good (the only thing they really seem to have a handle on)."
Avital C.,"Los Angeles, CA",77,118,8,5.0,9/30/2011,Great location & nice outdoor patio.. Parking is valet or self park for the same price lol wtf. Great service! Kept the drinks coming! :)
Jason S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",51,26,,4.0,6/17/2010,I've been to many different Cheesecake Factory's and think this is one of the nicest. The place is large and usually packed with attractive people. Call ahead to make reservations so you could have dinner on the patio that overlooks the harbour and watch the sunset. Even though the bar area is very social and designed to give easy access to ordering food and drinks the bartenders are clueless so I recommend just ordering everything from your waitress. If you are a fan of chocolate be sure to try the Oreo Cheesecake.
Annie P.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,163,,2.0,11/2/2009,"I like the Cheesecake Factory, and this one is pretty cool.  It is the original, and it is huge and on the Marina.   I just cannot believe they charge for valet.  It's almost insulting.  If there were not parking near by, readily available, that would be one thing.  But there is a huge lot.  And generally a long line to get your car.  I will not be returning to this location again.  And sadly this is the only location near me, so it seems I will not be returning to Cheesecake again."
Jennifer H.,"San Francisco, CA",296,525,4,4.0,6/26/2007,"We all know that C.F. has something to satisfy any ones hunger, but ask to be seaten outside, order the crispy beef, and one (or two) of their delicious cocktails and call it a day! P.S.  Their strawberry and raspberry lemonades are refreshing and sweet!"
Kai R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,627,,4.0,6/18/2012,"Location, location, location.  It had been a while since I've been to the CF in MDR since they opened one in Pasadena.  The location here right on the beach makes this one special.  Have lunch, then let the kids play at the beach-front playground or dip their toes in the ocean.  Tip - there is a secondary section right on the beach which has a limited menu (most of the good items), is more relaxed, and not as cramped as upstairs."
andrew g.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,47,,3.0,7/11/2010,"The entrees are not always great (fish and chips especially not so good). The cheesecake is. The staff have always been friendly, fast, and attentive."
Sarah H.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,10,,4.0,9/1/2010,I love it here! Their hot spinach dip starter and 4 cheese pasta main course is 2 die for! If it wasnt so fatty I would eat here everyday!
Sherea V.,"Cerritos, CA",22,12,,5.0,8/31/2010,"I love this place! I love this location! My waiter was very good. I has the  Steak Diane with Shrimp and mashed potatoes. I also had to top it off with my favorite 'Vanilla Bean Cheesecake"". Thanks Cheryl for treating me to a marvelous lunch!"
Arthur F.,"Paris, France",3,235,,1.0,3/18/2011,"Been going to this place before it opened. Used to be a steak place in the last century. Cheesecake was and probably still is a good value. However. mnagement ability has degenerated  badly and sadly. Took a table on the patio on a chilly evening. The heat lamp was not on and when I requested it be turned on a bus boy said it was broken. When I requested that another be brought the robot seating us said they couldn't move them. I've had them moved many times. A few minutes later I asked another bus boy and he turned it on. The we ordered 2 gin martinis. What arrived tasted like s--t. When I mentioned it to the server she was shocked but did nothing. I called for a manager who came over and tolerated us and replaced the martinis saying a ""dirty martini"" was ordered. I never heard of a dirty martini. When the bill arrived there were six (6) martinis on it and 2 martini credits. When I pointed this out  to our ""server"" she said WOW after being forced to look at the tab. There was never any apology of any kind. Really poor service and management. A complaint to Cheesecake never brought a reply. No matter the food; this kind of treatment leaves one with a bad taste, sort of like the martinis."
Erika C.,"North Hollywood, CA",81,94,1,3.0,7/13/2009,"came out here for dinner the other night, expecting to be waiting an hour or so just like at all the other cheesecake factory's out there. but we were VERY pleasantly surprised to be seated only 15 mins after arriving.  this was even out on the patio overlooking the marina.  this was my first time out to this Cheesecake in Marina Del Rey, as usual the food was good and the menu extensive, but the view definitely made the meal more enjoyable.  i am definitely putting this place in front of all the other cheesecake's out there. definitely worth the drive, hopefully the 15 min wait isn't a fluke and we get the same service second time around."
Mike W.,"Orange County, CA",415,592,56,4.0,2/8/2010,this place is pretty nice - it's located on the harbor with this man made beach so props on ambiance.  the service is fine - we had this long haired skinny fella and he was very attentive and always spot on with water and bread. the food is ok... my friend liked her chicken piccata but my dish sorta tasted like it was left under the heap lamp a tad bit too long... it had that dry chewy taste. all in all a good place to grab a bite.
