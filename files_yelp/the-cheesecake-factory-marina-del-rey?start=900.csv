Billie R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,3.0,10/17/2010,"Never has a waitress been so rude to me. Thank God for Yelp, where I can openly describe my retched experience. I love Cheesecake and I am a frequent customer. Most of the servers are lovely. However, I encountered a terrible woman last time I was here. Her name is Sarah and if you wind up in her section, ask to be moved! Otherwise, I have few complaints. The food is, and will probably always be good."
Dth S.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,997,1,4.0,4/14/2012,"definitely dine outside if you're at this particular cheesecake factory! other than that, it's the same as all the other cheescake factories! except the pretty&fruity cocktails seem to taste better at this location! maybe it's outdoors sea breeze.....??"
Jackie J.,"Santa Clara, CA",73,182,18,3.0,1/4/2010,"I was visiting Marina Del Rey with a friend and we decided to eat at CCF. We asked to sit outdoors because the scenery was beautiful! Hands down! The best view ever at a CCF. But the back patio was so cramped...I was sitting real close to the person next to us that I can hear their conversation and couldn't hear my friend who was sitting right across from me. Then so many people would have to pass by our table and accidentally bump it. I enjoyed our food, but I've had better experience."
Robert L.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,105,139,3.0,1/22/2010,"This is one of the better franchise among all other Cheesecake Factories. Expected decent food with large portions, cozy decor. Try to reserve an outdoor table during any (sunny) summer afternoon, and you will enjoy this meal even better."
Jonathan C.,"San Francisco, CA",273,93,2,3.0,7/9/2007,"I've been to many different Cheesecake Factories in both Atlanta, Austin, and San Jose. This place has to be the most unappealing of them all from an ambiance perspective. The waitress(s), they were nice. Turned down the outside heating so we could enjoy the cool marina sea breeze.  I noticed the place closed at 1 AM on Friday night. Quite late. I was a bit unhappy with the Mojitos. I ordered one for my bro so he could try it. He had a few sips and I finished mines and his without much of a buzz. Food delivery was a tad slow, but once it got here, it was good. The waitress came back plenty of time to check if everything is okay. Definitely happy with that.  If you are dead hungry, Cheesecake will serve you big portions that'll definitely fill yer up so eat up!"
Railey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,116,,3.0,7/3/2012,Came here for my birthday was rather disappointed. We got the cabana with ocean view on a non busy Tuesday which was nice. The cabana area only has the express menu which was very small. Some of the favorite items on the regular menu was not on the express menu. The kitchen close early too on a Tuesday night. We have a vegan in our group so our server accommodate by serving him kids meal in larger potion.Also I thought they would have complimentary dessert for birthday or something but none what so ever.
Robert B.,"Saint Paul, MN",76,28,9,5.0,7/25/2009,"Great menu, great environment and they even have a fire pit. Plus you can walk the beach after dinner. The only drawback is sometimes the wait can be pretty lengthy!"
Allison G.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,223,19,5.0,5/25/2007,This has to be the most popular location for this chain. It's a bummer that Cheesecake does not take reservations at all!!! The wait *weekend forget about it* can be a total nightmare sometimes. If I am in a rush I'll set in the bar area.  Each and every single time the food is always good. Basic comfort food with a California twist. Can not go wrong with this place for lunch/brunch or dinner for two peep's to a group of peep's! Awesome staff service at this location!!! Parking is a private lot/valet. Hula salad is my favorite!!!!
Melissa h.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",36,8,,5.0,7/25/2012,"Had my daughter's Sweet 16 there this past Friday night. It went off like a dream. Set menu, menu printed with my daughter's name and menu choices before we arrived. Zero wait time, sat outside. Customer service perfection. Asked to speak to the manager before we left just to tell him how great the whole thing was and share our appreciation!!! 25 very happy people. Thank you!!"
Michele W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,7/16/2012,"Great food but terrible service. I've been to the happy hour before and loved it. Went back for a second time and waited 24 minutes for no one to do anything. The host was nice enough and tried to bring bread over when we were leaving. When I waited another 10 minutes for a manager who never came after being paged, I decided to tell one of the other incompetent workers. A woman overheard and said it happens all the time there. So if you like waiting forever, this is your place."
Alexis R.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",167,171,3,4.0,4/21/2009,"came here last sunday after a day of fun in the sun, and we were starving!!!  We went around 5 pm and the place was packed.  It was just the two if us and the wait was 30-45 min.  We were going to suck it up and wait when we saw two chairs calling out to us at the bar.  We went to the bar and ordered our food from the menu and it came out so quickly.  The service was good, especially for how busy the bartenders were.  The food was very good, i dont know if it was because i was so hungry at the time or if it is really the case but I think this cheescake tasted better then the other cheesecakes I have been to.  The atmosphere was beautiful, they have stained glass lights coming down from the ceiling and they are beautiful, a little piece of art at every turn."
Daniel A.,"Valencia, CA",56,14,2,3.0,5/11/2009,"The food was decent, the service was excellent.  My only complaint is the  mandatory Valet parking.  It took forever, and when we were done eating there was a line of people waiting for their cars.  I opted to just grab my keys and walk to my car.  Overall a decent dinner."
Alexandria H.,"Playa Del Rey, CA",132,11,,3.0,12/1/2009,"I went here and the wait was over 45 minutes long. I had my stomach tumbling and turning, when the waiter finally brought me my water I was relieved when the BIG BREAD basket arrived. We gobbled it all up in 10 minutes. I ordered the spinach dip and house salad. I must say i don't like the table arrangement. I feel like I am eating on top of the next person and can hear the conversations all around me."
Sue Z.,"Playa del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",474,451,120,4.0,3/19/2009,"i only order two things here. since the portions here are MASSIVE. it's more then enough food for two people. thai lettuce wrap and avocado egg rolls.  the thai lettuce wrap-  butter lettuce for optimum wrapping. : )  warm, grilled chicken strips. bean sprouts (my fav) sliced carrots, pickled cucumber, and some noodles! and their ginger sauce is a perfect topper to this wrap!  avocado egg rolls: it's heaven.  i love avocados. and i love egg rolls.  the avocados come out warm, with just the right amount of crispiness outside. they have a peanut based sauce you can dip it in. drool. i ordered the peach bellini which was excellent. the bf ordered the Flying Gorilla. beware. it's probably 500 calories+, and it just tastes like a badly made milk shake, with not enough booze in it!  overall, the food is pretty consistent, and you can't go wrong with the fresh baked bread they bring out in the beginning of the meal. it always ruins my appetite! but hey, i'm not complaining. : )"
Nick K.,"Seattle, WA",662,257,188,4.0,4/12/2009,"The joint is always kickin', and there's always a long wait... and they should... the food is really tasty (and lots of variety), and the service is always top notch.  I just wish they had a better lot (how about an option to park without having to pay or valet?).  But you really can't beat the location... by the water, there are no tables with bad views in the whole place.  I've been going here for over a decade, and I plan to keep going in the future."
PRETTY D.,"Fremont, CA",9,47,1,4.0,2/24/2008,"Beautiful...Romantic..set overlooking the marina, this place is really perfect for a candlelight dinner by the sea...Food is good, nothing extraordinary, service is decent, its all about the ambience.  Make reservations if you don't want to wait. They have ample of parking; provide valet service."
MIKE B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",27,38,,5.0,11/8/2009,"Me and my family really love this chain.  It really does not get any better than this restaurant for quality and variety.  I usually tell diners to choose only from 2 or 3 items on the menu of most restaurants to avoid disappointment, but CCF is an exception to my rule. I have eaten countless dishes on their menu and been pleasantly surprised with the wonderful meals each time. However, I would be shortchanging new diners if I did not mention what I love most on their menu which includes: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta-unbelievable Crusted Chicken Romano-again YUM Cajun Chicken Littles-Best chicken fingers on the planet BBQ Ribs-OMG great! Renee's Special-Soup,Salad,Sandwich-have it on Saturday with the Chicken soup(Sat Only) and your soul will thank you. Pizza-great Steaks-surprisingly great! You can't go wrong with the great food, huge portions, and the beautiful space you are eating within. The service is usually really good too, however I have had a few bums as servers.  The good thing is the manager has comped us completely on those occasions. This place is a real winner, eat there as much as possible, we do!"
Mike M.,"San Fernando, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/18/2012,"Everything is great about this place. Service, food, atmosphere.  Highly recommended"
Dormand L.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,159,15,3.0,12/11/2008,The best things going for this restaurant is the view of the marina and of course the cheesecake.  The Pasta Da Vinci lunch special was OK and just the right portion size for me. Other than that there's not much more which stand out.  The restaurant is located in an older building so it could use a facelift.
john l.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,32,,2.0,3/1/2009,"Went here for lunch on a late Saturday afternoon, and though the food was spot on, the service was totally a nightmare. From the moment they tried to seat us to paying the bill, I could not understand how this place could let themselves slip so badly. Though there were plenty of tables, the host inevitably wanted to seat us right near the wait/busboy station. Big buckets of dirty dishes and the order terminal do not make a good time. When we asked for a table not so close to the bus station, the host simply said, ""Fine. Sit where you want."" Our waitress was a loon. Somehow we got the one waitress who was assigned to at least 3 different sections of the restaurant. She was all over the room, yet never managed to get us water, bring us menus, nor refill our drinks. We waited a painfully long time and she was just not a good waitress. The other wait staff really do not care. If you are not their customer, they will not even look at you. One waiter constantly checked the payment folders for his tip and when we asked him for help, he told us flatly, that ""it was not his station."" Go tot the one at the Grove or the Beverly Hills location. Their service is solid. This location had scattered, lackadaisical and totally unmotivated service staff EVER!!!"
