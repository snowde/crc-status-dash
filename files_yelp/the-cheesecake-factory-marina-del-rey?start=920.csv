Sandra S.,"San Clemente, CA",13,37,,5.0,5/12/2010,"We visited on Sat. lunch on Mother's Day weekend.  Robert was our waiter, and he is a pro!  Used to work at Gladstones, and was very attentive to us.  The view outside was delightful!  The food as great as always.  If you go - make sure you ask for Robert!"
Lisa H.,"Burbank, CA",8,7,,4.0,12/7/2010,"I really haven't been to many Cheesecake factories in the past, I always saw them as over priced and over rated and nothing special. Tonight they changed my mind, or at least the Cheesecake factory in Marina Del Rey did. It's been very hard to restaurants that are understanding and willing to help people with food allergies. We told the waiter about my allergy to gluten and he went to the chef with our questions. He not only came back with answers but he also came back with suggestions of other gluten free menu items. The chef was willing to open up a fryer just fro me so that I could have gluten free sweet potato fries. To me that was awesome, the chef knew about gluten allergies and was willing to make exceptions and accommodate my request. Definitely worth four stars. The burger (wrapped in lettuce) and sweet potato fries were excellent. For once I felt good about asking questions and making special requests."
May M.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,93,,4.0,1/7/2009,I love Cheesecake's teriyaki chicken and crab cake; both are a must try.
Charles T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/24/2010,"My family and I probably had one of the nicest dinners together at this restaurant. We were looking for a restaurant for New Years Eve (Yes, this review is almost 3 months overdue) and typed in Cheesecake factory in the GPS. My family from Europe thought it was some cheap diner from its name, and was told we had to wait for around 40 minutes. Got there, and they let us know that the patio was free and we could grab a table there and then. We went outside and it was absolutely beautiful, the terraced patios really added to the ambiance of the meal, had no clue why people wanted to sit inside! I'm all about the experience being just as important as the food, and I was dumbfounded to see where we would be dining. Clear skies, beautiful moon, great food, great service, lovely company just made this one of the nicest dinner's we've had as a family. If you're around the LA area, definitely check this branch out, and try the red velvet cheesecake. That really topped off a meal we thought couldn't get any better.  -C"
christyna c.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1,23,,1.0,8/2/2008,"So after waiting a few minutes to be greeted by the Hostess, I asked for a table for 2, and was rudely told that here would be a 15 minute wait, oh did mention the restaurant was EMPTY.  After seating ourselves in the bar, we waited another 10 minuets to be acknowledged.  At that point i was done, asked for a manager, was told they were in all in a  meeting, then told the waitress I needed my parking validated b/c i wanted to leave and eat elsewhere, her response that we could just leave!   So that's just what i did, After calling the restaurant a few moments later to speak to a manager,  I was given half ass apology and not even invite to return.  Never going back to this place."
Mr N.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/2/2010,Valet parking is a major ripoff.  It is right in a parking lot with plenty of spaces. Not as if it is a busy street.  Won't go back for that reason.  It isn't the 5 bucks but the disrespect for customer it shows.
Rich N.,"Temecula, CA",14,19,,5.0,8/7/2011,"Its the cheese cake factory, so I don't feel the need to rate the food as I'm sure its been rated countless Times by others.However I feel I must comment on the awesome outdoor patio featured at this location.At night, the water view of the harbor is highlighted by numerous torches for lighting.Great service great drinks, great experience"
Coffee E.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,23,,2.0,4/15/2007,"What can I say that haven't been covered? Everyone loves to hate CF and for good reason. Yet, we all go there at least a couple times a year to attend someone's birthday, a business meeting, someone's shower or we just plain got out-voted by our dining companions. Service is always horrible - there's really no incentive to be better when the line is always up around the block at any given weekend nights. Do not try to go here during any type of celebratory days (holidays, graduations, 4th of July, etc) at any cost. I'm serious. The MDR location has a good amount of outdoor seatings by the water. Great to hang out and catch up with a friend during a weekday lunch, don't try that during weekends as they'll rush you. Valet only in this location."
Rabia K.,"Toronto, Canada",7,59,,4.0,5/3/2011,The best Cajun Jambalaya Pasta I've ever had! I go there time and again for the same dish and of course the Godiva Chocolate Cheescake is to die for and a perfect end to the meal! I do recommend sharing the pasta if you aren't big eaters; the entrees are huge! ALWAYS expect to wait at least 20 mins before you get seated (usually more).
Masa H.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/12/2011,ohh shit I didn't make it on time to my reservation and I didn't get priority on the next table
fran d.,"Long Beach, CA",456,513,66,4.0,9/12/2007,"this is one of my old stomping grounds. there is lots of fond memories. each night after school my classmates and i would drive here and wait out for a table at the bar. by the time the vibrator box called us up, we'd have three or four drinks in us and be ready to enjoy our meal. frankly, i think that's the best way to experience cheesecake factory. it's not really a romantic dinner kind of place. too crowded. the food isn't all that great to brave bringing over a date and wowing him or her for your know how of excellent culinary establishments. the menus are rather tacky what with the ads placed in them. from a business marketing stand point that's awesome, but from a customer stand point, it's plain old tacky. now if there were better ads or interesting stories in them, the menus would make for cool reading. the cheesecakes do kick ass but i am rather partial to cheesecakes. this place really means nothing to the lactose intolerant. i highly recommend you call ahead and make a reservation. it can get crowded not unlike a beijin whorehouse on a saturday night."
Jeremy S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",21,31,,3.0,1/16/2008,"Of course, the food is stellar when it doesn't get screwed up...(most frequent here than any other I've been to). The service has been rotten every time I go to this location. I don't know if they give the servers more tables than others, but I always end up waiting forever here, 20 minutes last time to just get water, then another 15 to order our stuff, including drinks! The patio is pretty cool with the fire pit and overlooking mother's beach (strechmark beach)...actually, overlooks the playground where you can generally see the conglomerate of strollers and kids shreiking, but only until sunset usually. They try to give you the impression you can only valet park, but if you turn left down panay way and  take the first parking lot entrance on the left just before the gym, you can access the public parking lot and park the same place they would have!"
A. P.,"Venice, CA",6,226,26,1.0,7/31/2006,"This is truly one of the worst places I've been to. A friend made me go try it - and there was a rusty nail in my food. Seriously! The waiter and manager were very nice about the whole thing, but still. Beyond that nightmare, I can't figure out why anyone would hit these places of excessively sized portions of blah food. Has America really devolved to this level? Really people, learn about food, treat your body better and reach beyond something with 'cheesecake' in the name - that should be an alarm right off the bat."
Kalikala A.,"Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, CA",8,75,51,1.0,2/15/2010,"These bitches tried to kill me!!! First of all, they sat my boyfriend and I all the way in the back by the kitchen after waiting 15 mins for a seat. The servers kept bumping into me going to and from the kitchen which annoyed the hell out of me since they knew good and dam well they were bumping me and didn't even do as much as look back to give a ""oops sorry about that expression"". Instead of leaving like I should have, I ordered the Jambalaya. My boyfriend was eating out of my plate while I had to take a phone call and I noticed that the shrimp sitting in the Jambalaya were grey. My boyfriend was like, babe your food is cold. I immediately called the manager over and blessed his ass out. I made him call the server who brought that crap out to me to apologize. My boyfriends food was fine and the manager expected me to pay for his. I told him I wasn't paying for crap and collected my purse and my man and stormed out advising all the patrons not to order the Jambalaya as it had raw shellfish in it. I called and reported them to the health department the very next day. I received a report from them advising that they got a very negative report and 4 of their meals were being held under the proper temperature. I'll never go back. They totally suck!"
Scott S.,"Norwalk, CA",78,28,,1.0,3/21/2010,"Too bad for the this chain. I have eaten at others in the past and enjoyed my experience. Went there for dinner last night with the family. First of all, this restaurant was really loud, making it almost too difficult to talk to one another at our small table. Next, the service was really odd. The meals were brought out by different people, and each plate at different times, and none of the servers knew which table to go to. This appeared to not just be an isolated event as I watched this occur over and over all evening... Servers milling around with food going from table to table until they found their intended guests... Really strange. The food seemed marginal, not exciting. I had the fish tacos, my wife a steak, and my son the factory burger. For desert, I had the velvet cheese cake, and my son had a hot fudge sunday. Again... The deserts toured table to table before finding us. There was about a10-15 minute gap between the cheese cake and the sunday arriving... Sorry CCF of Marina Del Rey, but I don't think we will be back."
Glen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,102,,5.0,8/18/2008,"This one if by far my favorite of all Cheesecake Factory's.   Everything I have to say about this restaurant aside from the parking is excellent.   The service is great and everyone who works there is friendly and helpful.  The drinks are fantastic as are the bartenders.   The seats are a little close together but being single, my friend and I go here expecting that.   If you're looking for privacy don't go here then complain about it later.    The menu here is literally a book.  There's a fantastic variety, maybe too much so that it makes it hard to decide.  The appetizers are great and the main courses are great.  The food portions are large.  To think before they used to be gigantic but even now it's a lot of food for the money.   If you decide to have a lunch or dinner on the outdoor patio overlooking the tiny beach it makes a very nice visual.   There are heat lamps too on an evening that's a little on the chilly side.       Dessert, did somebody say dessert?   If you have room.   All types of cheesecake and if you're not a cheesecake fan they have other very good desserts.    This is one of the few places I would give a 5 out of 5.   The price isn't that expensive either.    Back to the parking.  If you don't mind valet then it's okay.  I don't like to valet my car because then I have to lock up my loose change and my sunglasses and I usually have some things in my truck that I have to clear out prior to eating here or remember to take the alarm off the key ring in which case I worry they didn't lock the car."
Mary F.,"Marina del Rey, CA",5,10,,4.0,8/6/2009,"Food is great. Cheesecake even better. The view is amazing at the Marina del Rey location if you sit outside. View of the yachts and the serene marina. Service is good and speedy. However, portions could feed a family of 20. You leave feeling mightly bloated if you finish everything on your plate. I recommend only eating a quarter of the food or half and doggy bagging the rest."
Alex d.,"Santa Monica, CA",81,77,3,3.0,4/25/2007,"Nothing here is human scale. The food is all bigger than your head and you have no chance in hell of finishing it. It's like someone is still getting a kick out of seeing your face when the truck backs up and drops your entree off at your table. ""I see you've barely made a dent in that... would you like a to go box? How about some dessert?"""
Kristine K.,"El Segundo, CA",5,24,,4.0,12/7/2007,"I don't know why but, I like their salads and absurdly large portions.  I hate lines - order take out."
Laura M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,4.0,6/24/2011,"Another kid fave.  My kids love the food, the play area and the beach that is accessed directly from the restaurant.  They love the kids menu and I love the kid menu prices!  It is loud, so I don't feel bad when my kids make noise.  The service is good.  The restaurant is really pretty good overall for chain.  You must valet which I hate and they don't take reservations so you can be in for a long wait at times.  We will visit again."
