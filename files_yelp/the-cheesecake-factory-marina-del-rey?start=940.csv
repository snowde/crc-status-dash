Jeff P.,"Melville, NY",182,841,193,3.0,11/6/2007,"If you get an outdoor table, at night, this may be the only Cheesecake Factory that is actually worth the wait."
Carrie C.,"Los Angeles, CA",269,606,990,4.0,7/4/2010,"Four stars for the view, not for the food...If there's a Cheesecake Factory to go to, it's this one.  Not as pretty or new, but it has a huge outside patio, with plenty of umbrellas if you don't want to be in the sun and you can look at the marina or people watch...I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory with a view.  Food is as expected.  Waitress was super nice and attentive.  I decided to try something new and ordered the portobello mushroom on a bun.  It was ok, not as tasty as the one from the Veggie Grill...not even close.  The bun was huge, and it enveloped the mushroom.  Too much thick rings of red onions that I couldn't even taste the mushroom so I had to pull it out.  They try to make it look big, but that definitely does not compensate for the lack of taste.  I also ordered a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake....mmmm though packed with calories, its' always a delicious treat after a meal....or anytime. haha...my friend ordered the chocolate fudge cake...oh man.  That is a complete sin.  1600 calories, a person needs to split that into 8 sittings.  I helped her finish it. :)"
Linda C.,"Buena Park, CA",64,124,61,5.0,6/21/2010,"so let me tell ya I am a super duper big fan of the CCF, everything I've had here has been delish & i have never been disappointed here, the view is lovely I brought my friend this past weekend to celebrate a her new home, We had the Avocado rolls, the buffalo boneless wings & I had Georgia peach & a lemon drop , & she had 2 Cadillac margaritas, I had the seared ahi tuna salad & she had the chicken pasta, all our items were scrumptious & the drinks were strong just the way we like them, Our server was very attentive, kept coming to our table to check if we needed anything. we didn't have to wait long it was a little bit past lunch hour & we asked for a table on the patio, parking is VALET but its not expensive like $4-5, it was a beautiful day, oh & of course dessert to go :red velvet Cheesecake:: yummy.."
Vicki C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,12,,5.0,11/6/2008,"Truly one of the best ""chain"" restaurants out there, Cheesecake has been my favorite place for a  fancy lunch or a romantic dinner for a long time. The service is typically top notch and the variety of foods on the menu gives you so much to choose from, you can have almost any different type of food, or just your fav every time (I love the steak Diane and Shimp Scampi - yumm!).  I really like the Marina del Rey location because the view from the patio is beautiful. Check it out!"
Christina M.,"Culver City, CA",0,24,,4.0,8/7/2008,"Because the patio overlooks the Marina, the ambience is great, especially if you go at night.  The patio is heated which is nice b/c it always gets a little chilly with the ocean breeze.  The wait staff is nice and attentive, however DO NOT sit at the bar area!  Every time I have sat there, the drinks take FOREVER and the service is horrible.  One time a friend even had his drink spilled on him...by the waiter!!  Overall, you can't beat the huge menu selection and all the food is pretty good."
SONI A.,"Northridge, CA",10,15,3,4.0,9/6/2010,"Usually I wouldn't be writing a review for Cheesecake Factory just because it is a chain, but this location in the Marina is special.  I was there one evening and the hostess said I could go to their lounge which was outdoors - seating in on a first come first serve basis.  I figured I'd check it out while waiting for my guest.  I was sooo shocked.  They have this separate entrance that leads to cabanas, fire pits, tikki torches - all level with the marina.  It's beautiful.  The menu is condensed so you don't feel over-bombarded with options, and it makes for a very lovely evening on a summer night.  I highly recommend going for an evening to unwind."
mark b.,"Santa Monica, CA",27,103,7,3.0,5/5/2008,"I'm giving the Cheesecake Factory three stars because overall, the place is just mediocre.  Now, they do have some of the best desserts anywhere, so I would rate it at least four starts.  Of course, the place is always packed, so if you do what I do, walk in, order you a Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, and then eat that sucker on the way back to the car, this place is heaven and deserves five stars!"
Debbie A.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,51,,2.0,10/30/2009,"like all cheesecake factories this one has dependable food, good atmosphere, huge portions, and is the place to go for a dependable meal where you know exactly what you are going to get.  of course, their cheesecake is awesome. the reason y i rated this place so low was bcuz of the manager quinne.  This guy was the biggest idiot in the world.  he did not know how to handle customers at all and when there was a complaint he would just stand there like an idiot and just say...""i dont know what to tell you""."
Mike F.,"Irvine, CA",396,599,48,4.0,6/15/2007,"Cheesecake factory is awesome to begin with but add a beautiful ocean harbor, a killer patio area and some great company on a summer night?!?!?! ITS ON. This place kicks ass as far as all of the CF's Ive been to. The only thing I dont like is the packed (cant help it) crowd and the long lines. Bar in the front is cool but is also madly packed. I usually end up ordering the same Jambalaya pasta and on occasion a Snickers cheesecake....yummmm (is it 5:00 yet?). Parking is a madhouse with the crowd but if you have patience, this place is the one to go if youre a CF fan like I am."
Tony T.,"Orange County, CA",103,521,87,4.0,1/19/2007,"Expect a LONG wait as it's always crowded.  The food is dependable and I've always enjoyed their pasta dishes.  I've gone several times through the years, opting for an outdoor table during the summers as it's cool and beautiful outside and great for a date, but be warned that it's a loud place so again the outdoor setting is more conducive for intimate, get to know each other time versus sitting inside.  They have good, friendly staff that are knowledgeable and helpful.  And of course there is the cheesecake.  That itself is yummy! I even order their pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving as that is yummy! It's SO worth it! Parking is limited, but they have valet to take care of that! A great place to eat in the marina so expect a wait!"
Charles M.,"San Pablo, CA",0,10,,4.0,9/20/2010,"The food is Ok. Steak is over priced... However, I give it FOUR stars because of the atmosphere. You can sit outside, which is would recommend on any sunny. This is the reason to eat there... There are some pigeon that walk aorund under the tables and adds to eating outside. They don't interfer with you while your eating;)"
Adam L.,"Los Angeles, CA",47,3,5,4.0,4/23/2008,"The beef ribs are fantastic! We sat out on the porch in the evening, it was a little cold, but there were heaters. I recommend bringing a jacket, at least for the next few weeks. I'm new to the area, so I'm not sure when it starts being warm at night. I imagine by the water, it's usually a bit chilly. I thought the service was pretty good."
Jimmy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,50,,4.0,9/8/2007,"We've all tried Cheesecake Factory before but I just like this one a little better than the other locations with the patio outdoor. It's a nice place to come for lunch, have a few cocktails, overlooking the Marina."
Joseph G.,"Long Beach, CA",5,54,,4.0,1/14/2008,Delicious Pesto.  Some of the best Ive ever had.  It was awesome.  Id give it 5 stars but the service was kind of slow.
Deborah H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,12/30/2009,"We went to this location for lunch...and the food was great,we ordered the avacado eggrolls.and tuna sushimi...YUMMY!...and our waitress.was excellent.(Paris)also we had the lemon rasberry cheescake...my daughter did not like the fried chickentenders from the kids menu..but all of the adults loved the food,drinks and deserts!!!"
five s.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,112,20,3.0,9/8/2009,"Mauh ha ha! I discovered the avocado eggrolls at this location while sitting outside overlooking the bay. Def a chain place and not something I normally do, but it was fun:)"
Senna H.,"New Orleans, LA",204,293,17,4.0,2/15/2008,"i was craving a burger so i got one of the ""special"" burgers  it was great i ordered some chicken tenders for my son and they portions were massive!  i prefer the menu at grand luxe cafe"
Mary S.,"Cheviot Hills, CA",0,68,1,3.0,8/23/2008,"This place definately puts the factory in cheesecake factory.  everything feels very corporate here- from the menu to the service.  its in an absolutely beautiful location-day or night- as it directly overlooks the marina but overall the food is dreadfully average, as was the service.  it is probably pretty good if you have a group of people and cant decide on a specific type of food, because at least you get a really good variety on the menu.  otherwise, eh."
Patrick S.,"Torrance, CA",1546,415,1722,3.0,2/19/2008,"ya know,, for some reason this place reminds me how good the other ""cakes"" are. the first time i went here with my now wife, we waited for 2+hours and then just as we got seated the manager came out to tell us the ovens broke and they had no hot food. but after that every time i go here its just a let down,, until we eat. this location is always PACKED !!!  we always wait at least 1-2 hours, but the thing that kills me is, the bar here is real small, but they have this downstairs bar area that has a fire pit. it nice, but we never ever get any service out there. way under staffed. in fact we were sitting around this fire pit with about 10 others and they all said the same thing, ""does anyone work here?"" , everyone had to go get their own drinks. But the weird part is they have a bar downstairs, its just empty, not staffed or stocked. so the entire place has to wait for this one small bar to serve them. i know its a problem because when we got our table and ordered drinks and food, our food came before our drinks.  but other than that the food was good, and the out side seating is nice at night or day. You will get the same great food you get at any cheesecake factory. my suggestion would be to go to another location, you will be better off."
Miss J.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,,2.0,6/22/2008,"I was visiting Marina Del Rey with a friend. We asked to sit outdoors because the scenery was beautiful! But the back patio was so cramped and we didn't have fantastic service that night. I enjoyed our food, but I've had better experience."
