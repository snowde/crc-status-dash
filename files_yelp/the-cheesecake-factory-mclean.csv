MAtthew R.,"Fairfax, VA",122,14,1,5.0,12/20/2017,"This is was one of the best experiences I have ever had at ANY Cheesecake Factory!!!  Even during the busy Christmas season we were able to be seated immediately. My friend and I were greeted by the kindest waitress, Carla L.  She took no time in getting our drinks to us and our food was ready within 10 minutes of ordering.  When I tell you my Salmon was to die for, it was, to be crude, a foodgasm.  I have no complaint about anything other than the faint lighting in the restaurant.  Otherwise my drink was delicious, food was superb, and I'd even go so far as to give great reviews to my coworkers and friends!  Keep up the good work!!!"
Justin C.,"Washington, DC",60,271,,2.0,12/18/2017,"Had reservation for party of 12 at 630.  Arrived at 610 and they told us they wouldn't be able to seat us until 730. 730 rolls around, we don't get seated until like 8pm.  We didn't receive menus until like 815pm. Didn't order until like 845pm. Food comes out relatively quickly around 910pm but it's obvious the food is cold. My Louisiana Chicken Pasta tasted weird and the sauce was already starting to congeal so it had that saran wrap look to the sauce around the plate. We didn't even get dessert and ended up leaving around 10:15am so essentially I spent 4 hours at Cheesecake for a subpar meal.  I usually have a fantastic experience at Cheesecake but I will not be going back to this location.  I will say that the waiter really tried his best and was very kind so hats off to him, as I'm sure most, if not all, of the issues were unrelated to him."
Sharnitta R.,"Fort Washington, MD",144,95,95,3.0,11/2/2017,"I have frequent this Cheesecake Factory on many occasions and haven't ran into bad customer service as of yet . I arrived with a party of 3 on 10-25-17.  The elevators that take you directly inside the cheesecake were down so we had to walk through the mall just to get inside which was a disappointment. Anyways when we made our way to the hostess desk we were greeted right away and was seated in a short time. The waiter came within 10 min and she was super nice and showed plenty of enthusiasm. My only issue with this place is that they can never get it right with the temperature. Inside is always super cold and that should be monitored better when it's already super cold outside making it quite difficult to enjoy your meal. We started  with appetizers that consisted of fried calamari and buffalo chicken strips with the buffalo sauce on the side. The appetizers came out hot and pretty quick. There was no complaints on these items. Both were very good. Next the main meals, we ordered the kids cheese pizza, shrimp jambalaya and the chicken madeira. All of these was super good as well. Overall our experience was great and would recommend."
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,4.0,1/6/2018,"We visited the Cheesecake Factory at the Tysons Corner mall (Tysons II) in April 2017 and enjoyed the food well enough.  Was it my favorite experience at Cheesecake Factory? No.  But the service was good and the food was decent.  Between us, we ordered the ahi tuna salad and the burger.  We weren't too hungry because we had eaten lunch fairly close to the time we visited this restaurant, but it was a great snack to tide us over until dinner.  This Cheesecake Factory is located within the Tysons II mall, which is the more upscale of the two malls. We didn't need a reservation when we visited at around 4/5pm on a Saturday afternoon, but they were still quite busy.  I would definitely visit again, though Tysons Corner is a bit far from where we live and I don't have too many occasions to visit the Tysons II mall."
Eli R.,"Washington, DC",133,61,35,5.0,9/24/2017,"Great customer service here. I told the host that I was running short on time as my party would be going to a show after the birthday dinner. Everything came out quickly.  Macaroni and cheese balls, chicken costelleta, Jamaican Shrimp, smores cheesecake etc... all good."
Emily M.,"McLean, VA",65,83,100,4.0,10/24/2017,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants but service here is pretty hit or miss. I think the menu is far too large, and therefore all items aren't outstanding. However, if you stick to the specialities you should have a nice meal. My favorite entrees are the crispy chicken costoletta and chicken Madeira. The avocado egg rolls appetizer is also incredible. The few times that I have ordered something different I have regretted it, unfortunately.  On our last visit, our server was incredible and we were well taken care of. Andrew had noticed that one person was low carb and started making recommendations on how to make the best substitutions for his diet. It's a small thing but it means a lot! The cheesecake is usually the star of the meal and the reason we eat here. You can't go wrong with dulce de leche cheesecake, it's simply amazing."
Gary F.,"Alexandria, VA",1,3,,5.0,1/6/2018,"The orange chicken is great. It's a simple dish, that I find completely satisfying. I wished it had more pea pods and carrots.  The cheese cakes are always amazing. We typically order 1 for two people.  The service here is usually really good."
Christina P.,"Washington, DC",427,59,134,4.0,7/19/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory at Tysons Galleria is a crowd favorite. Having grew up in the Tysons area, the restaurants at the Galleria were popular for large family or group gatherings. My most recent trip to Cheesecake Factory was with my family (a party of 10) and the experience was good as usual. I'm giving Cheesecake Factory a 4/5 stars in this one because the food here is good but it's nothing particularly special. If you've frequented this restaurant you would know that Cheesecake Factory serves very large portions. I often opt for the ""skinny"" menu as I can hardly ever finish a regular sized plate. The main attraction of course though is the wide array of cheesecake options that you can enjoy! A personal favorite of mine is the Godiva chocolate cheesecake which is definitely large and rich enough to split between two!  Overall Cheesecake Factory is a great option if you're in the Tysons area looking for family size portions, great cheesecake, and excellent service!"
Joann M.,"Reston, VA",133,124,574,2.0,9/29/2017,Warning warning warning... while I love the food usually (keep reading)... service folks have been great... it's FRIGID in here... I think I see icebergs... I did see a very galant gentleman give his suit coat to his dining companion....  Being this cold just ruins all the positives of our lunch....  Great lunch here... ooh oh... just sent my salad back as it's the wrong dressing... no prob they will fix... yeah clam chowder... ohhh it's barely warm... I need hot soup in me... so off that goes... hubbies comment can't keep it hot cause to cold in here... fixed but seriously.... Let's enjoy... nooooo... hubby is like WTF!  Salt streaming out of the shaker... appears one if the holes is HUGE... luckily he caught what was happening before a issue but very strange....  Our server has been super sweet... not her fault for what the kitchen sends out... she did discuss with GM who s here that shakers need to be checked... I doubt I'm staying for my fav Cheesecake.... tooo cold!!!!! Don't forget your parka!
Donna R.,"Warren, NJ",465,419,4083,5.0,9/11/2017,"I was visiting family in Vienna,VA. and we decided to come to Tyson's Corner Mall, to go shopping and have lunch.  I chose the Cheesecake Factory for lunch  because In the past I frequented the one in Boca Raton,Fl many times and loved it. What's not to like about the Cheesecake Factory?  It's not your typical chain.  From the minute I walked in, I saw a warm and cheery dining room and adjacent bar with high hats which is a great place to sit when the restaurant is packed.  You can just walk in and if open just sit instead of waiting for a table.  The staff is extremely professional and well trained. I knew it was mid afternoon so I was able to get seated right away.  My server was Jerry and he was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items. I started with their Tropical Ice Tea ( passion fruit) it's so delicious I didn't even need to add sugar.  If you ever come to the Cheesecake Factory , the menu is overwhelming. There are so many choices to choose from.  They have lunch specials, and one of my favorites is The Renee- One half of a Fresh Turkey Sandwich or Chicken-Almond Salad Sandwich, a Cup of Soup and a Small Green Salad or you can get a Small Caesar Salad for a $1.00 extra. This time I decided to order their Fish Tacos. 4 Soft Corn Tortillas Filled with   Grilled Fish, Avocado, Tomato, Chipotle Sauce, Marinated Onions and Cilantro. Served with Rice and Beans. My fish was tender, there was definitely a nice little bite of heat which gave great flavor to my dish along with the marinated onions and fresh cilantro. My avocado was soft and creamy so I didn't need sour cream .The portion size was great and it came with a side of rice and black beans which I combined.  My aunt had an omelette she was able to choose 4 fillings. Hers was Spinach, onions, mushrooms and goat cheese . They didn't have feta. It came with breakfast paprika  potatoes, and whole wheat toast. My aunt was very happy her omelette was cooked perfectly. I normally get their Apple Pie Cheesecake, which I'm not sure if it's seasonal. I also get the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  Cheesecake. This  time I was too full to order dessert.. I gave them 5 stars because the food is consistently good. The service was really good and professional  The restaurant itself is spotless  They have an extensive menu , gluten free items and vegetarian items.along with low carb Cheesecake. I know that doesn't seem right.  They make their own flavored ice teas and lemonades. And of course all those amazing varieties of cheesecakes.... If your in the area this is also a good place to cone for a business lunch.  Just come early or later in the day to avoid the crowds."
General W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,61,38,3.0,12/17/2017,"Came here for dinner.  I ordered the New York Steak and my friend ordered the Diane steak. Which one is better?  The new York Steak. It was more flavorful and moist. The Diane steak is also a good choice, a little dry but good.  For desert we had the snicker cheesecake.  It was delicious. It tasted like the snicker ice cream bar. Yummy!!!"
Bianca B.,"Fairfax, VA",145,54,78,3.0,11/12/2017,I love coming to cheesecake and I have been to both Tyson's and fair oaks locations multiple times. Yesterday I came to Tyson's for dinner and although the food was as good as always there was a hair in the butter that they give you with the bread. We did tell our server about it and he was very apologetic and gave us new butter which was nice but I didn't want to eat it after what had happened.
Dee M.,"Arlington, VA",309,281,2037,2.0,7/19/2017,"Just your average Cheesecake Factory. Cheesecake was good but customer service was poor. When we were greeted by the front desk or whatever, my friend and I were told we could go ahead and seat ourselves. A few minutes after finding a booth, a waitress comes by and borderline scolds us for sitting there because a waiter supposedly had to seat us there himself (or herself). She had a nasty and panicked attitude about it."
Alice J.,"Arlington, VA",19,323,1281,3.0,3/11/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory is located in Tyson II (Tyson Galleria, the high-end newer extension of the Tyson Mall). The wait time was 40 minutes on a Saturday night (7:30 pm). We were given a beeper. We couldn't leave the restaurant to take a stroll in the mall, because the range of the beeper is limited.  They don't take reservations. That's a disappointment.  The entrance to the restaurant was not welcoming because it was noisy and overflowing with people waiting to be seated. Further, the lighting was too dim.  When we were finally seated, the service was OK. The place was a bit noisy so we even had trouble being heard when placing our order. The dishes were good, and the key lime cheesecake especially great. After all it's their namesake. Their crispy pineapple chicken and shrimp was tasty (sweet and slightly spicy). The portion of rice was huge though. A friend had their broccoli steak which is great. I had never heard of that dish before. The crab cake (as an entree) was simple but good.  The lighting in the dining area was too dim. This is probably because we were tucked away in a corner (in a booth). I do love their booth seating. But the lighting is too dim for a convivial group dinner. The dim lighting may work for romantic dinners (just two people face to face)."
Jerry E.,"Honolulu, HI",11,273,1166,4.0,2/5/2017,"Great services and fine foods; pancakes are their specialty. They are, in my opinion, much superior to IHOP. Their complimentary bread also very tasty. Had a first pizza with them and was very pleased. Will have to drop by once in a while to sample my favorite dishes."
Aarti B.,"McLean, VA",153,341,2001,4.0,4/24/2017,"Taken with a grain of salt that most of the food is fried and soaked in butter without any real flavor like most chain restaurants, Cheesecake is great for some warm comfort food and scoring some happy hour deals (Mon - Fri 4-6pm). There is an impressive selection of appetizers, sides, and a few drinks with generous portion sizes (they are the same as dinner portions!).  The avocado egg rolls are fried and stuffed with large chunks of avocado with tamarind cashew sauce. It was a hearty meal, I was stuffed after eating 4 of the 6 rolls. I ordered a salad to compensate for the egg rolls, which was good. The mojito was okay, I didn't finish it.  The service was the best part of the meal. The staff is attentive, friendly, and prompt with food.  Cheesecake is a great place to indulge in happy hour comfort food. If you are looking to get dinner at a similar American cuisine restaurant that can accommodate large groups, I recommend Founding Farmer's next to the mall or Earl's and Gordon Biersch in Tyson's 1."
Ashley E.,"Denton, MD",3,4,,5.0,10/21/2017,"My boyfriend and I are in the area for a short vacation, and both got in town pretty late last night. Neither of us had eaten since the afternoon, and were both SO HUNGRY. You have no idea how excited we were when we saw there was a CCF nearby.  Service was amazing, our waiter was genuinely fun and honestly made our day. Everything we ate was perfect, the atmosphere was awesome, and we loved it, 100%."
Rhonda W.,"Germantown, MD",13,138,396,5.0,9/21/2017,"They never disappoint! I love getting the appetizers as a meal. I get a variety and I get full! Service is always great. The choices are plentiful. I can always find something delicious to eat. My favorite are the avocado egg rolls, chicken samosas, and fried macaroni and cheese."
Vina K.,"Reston, VA",0,10,1,1.0,12/9/2017,"I stopped by this location to pick up a Salted Caramel Cheesecake to go. A few bites in I pulled out a LONG strand of hair that was baked in the cheesecake!!!! I called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager Ana, who said she can't refund me if I didn't have the receipt number. The cashier did not give me a receipt, so I asked her to look up the transition by time stamp/name/or amount. She said she will try and see what she can do and offered a new slice of cheesecake. At this point, I was so disgusted...pulling a long strand of hair out of my mouth just made my stomach turn."
Danya K.,"Fairfax, VA",7,3,17,5.0,10/20/2017,This is one of my favorite meals ! The mac and cheese burger cooked medium well with sweet potato fries. I always order this!
Neha G.,"Fairfax, VA",84,31,25,5.0,12/6/2017,I absolutely love their cheesecakes. I have been to this location several times and and the food is always on point. Great location and great service. They have a big menu with lots of options.
Faith P.,"Washington, DC",291,52,8,4.0,8/28/2017,"Tara was my server, she is absolutely the best. She was attentive and her personality showed through her customer service. She asked about me and my friend's day, etc.. My friend was not feeling too good due his hangover. But I ordered the Teriyaki chicken and my friend ordered the Alfredo pasta with shrimp. Both were extremely good. We kind of left early he couldn't touch his food. But for the short time with me being here was a pleasure having Tara as my server."
Patricia R.,"Austin, TX",0,10,18,4.0,12/28/2017,This place is good menu can be overwhelming. look at it prior to know what you want. Best place for a low carb cheesecake
Iulia G.,"Fairfax, VA",178,260,2007,3.0,1/21/2017,"Haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in forever, but when a friend chooses it for his birthday, I can't say no :) We were there pretty early on a Thursday (around 5:45 - 6 pm), so they were pretty empty and getting a table was easy.  Our waiter arrived shortly and was quite friendly, but it seemed like he was more preoccupied with a bigger party sitting next to us. Oh well! We ordered the Hibachi Steak and the Pasta Carbonara. My steak was delicious, even though fatty in places. It came with asparagus tempura and what were supposed to be wasabi mashed potatoes. Not sure why they call it that way, since I did not taste any wasabi. It was just basic mashed potatoes and super dry at that. The asparagus was alright.  My friend was really happy with his pasta. The tiny bits of bacon were just icing on the cake :) Of course the good thing is their portions are huge.  For dessert, we got their Godiva chocolate cheesecake to share. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, but since this was chocolate, I had no problem helping my friend finish it hahaha. It was rich and delicious.  Overall not a bad dinner, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
Derek Y.,"New York, NY",90,212,481,4.0,8/6/2016,"Stopped by The Cheesecake Factory for a late night dessert. This location, like most Cheesecake Factories I've been to, was pretty clean. At 9pm it was still pretty packed, so business must be good. I've never seen an empty Cheesecake Factory! We couldn't resist the tiramisu cheesecake, and it was even better because we had a $5 off coupon. The total came out to about $3.50, so there's no beating that. We also had a kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake (as well as another $5 coupon!). Out of the two, I certainly enjoyed the tiramisu more. I have a bias, however, because I already happen to love tiramisu. It was light and fluffy and not too sweet. The kahlua cocoa coffee cheesecake would've been more enjoyable if it were more coffee than cocoa. The chocolate/fudge flavor was too much for my liking, and it would've been tastier if it were 70/30 coffee/cocoa. That's up to each individual's liking, though, so no stars deducted for that. Good value overall because of the two $5 coupons. $8.50 for a slice is a bit too much for my taste, so I probably wouldn't get future slices without coupons."
Røxiie H.,"Washington, DC",0,7,,1.0,10/9/2017,"I just walked out of this location with my husband and daughter because we sat, unaddressed by a waiter, for at least 15 minutes. 3 different waiters walked by, 2 made eye contact but said nothing. It's late, my family is hungry, if you don't want to wait on certain tables, don't apply for a waitress position. I'm so sick of restaurants giving subpar service based on a consumers appearance.  We're in VA, don't act like it doesn't happen. None of the waiters were African American. Do better!"
Sarah S.,"Roanoke, VA",0,116,101,5.0,7/21/2017,"What a delicious meal and great evening!  I love the Cheesecake Factory and we came for dinner. The service was great. We had to wait, but after that...we were well taken care of. It was pretty dark inside the restaurant, but it made for a great atmosphere. The buffalo  blasts are an absolute must.  They are delicious with blue cheese. So, was the banana cheesecake.....I could've eaten more!  The limoncello is a must try also. And the bread!! It's always great. I definitely recommend the restaurant and this location. Parking was difficult but that's it!"
Barbara L.,"Sterling, VA",19,210,457,1.0,6/27/2017,"Never again and we love the location at Dulles Town Center but Tyson's will never see our money again. Guess we'll stick to DTC. (I was visiting hubby at work and he wanted to go here.) We walk in and the entry way is FREEZING. I mean ARTIC freezing. Should have been a red flag.  We were seated quickly and far in the back which is a-okay with us. Unfortunately, we were seated under some air conditioning vents with the freezing air blowing directly on top of our heads and after a few minutes, the cold kicks in. So, me being me, asked our lovely waitress if they could 're-direct' the air that was hitting us because it was super cold or have the thermostat adjusted? She went and checked and she came back and said ""management said if they turned it down, then they'd get complaints on it being too hot"".  Wow. Our money really doesn't matter to them, eh?  Didn't even suggest moving us to another table. (I just thought of that. lol) Instead, you never saw two people eat so quickly to get the heck out of a restaurant. We had planned on more drinks and dessert but at least we saved some calories. Anyway, after that, we only saw our waitress walking by us with no acknowledgement whatsoever. Not even a glance our way. We never got our drinks refilled or anything. I had to wave her down to get our check. You can bet your sweet buns that I had the credit card to hand to her before she sat that check down and disappeared on us again. Never a thank you for tolerating the cold temperatures, thanks for visiting, move to another table, nothing. Nada. Zip. Zero. Nuttin'.  Oh wait. There's more. I ordered the chopped salad and boy was it chopped! Yes. I know. Cut me some slack as I know what 'chopped' means. :-) However, I was expecting a bit more than 4 bite sized pieces of chicken and 3 pieces of avocado in the salad which was mostly lettuce with a few specks of red tomatoes in it. Sigh.  I'll stick with Dulles Town Center where they're friendlier and more customer service oriented. Mwah."
J E.,"Stafford, VA",0,635,1556,3.0,12/13/2016,"As a family of three, we went for lunch on a Saturday, but got there right before the lunch rush.  We were quickly sat without a wait, which was nice.  But after being sat, we still waited several minutes before the server came over.  We continued to have delays in service throughout, with the worse delay being waiting more than 20 minutes for our entrées to arrive. The appetizer was nice, the samosas were full of flavor!  The entrées, once they arrived were amazing!  Definitely full of flavor and perfectly prepared! We've been to this particular CF several times over the years and it's always the grandest of any of them, beautiful and nice & clean.  But the service has always been lackluster, almost as if they get enough business and feel that they'll continue to be successful regardless of the service they provide.  That coupled with so many who come here that are satisfied with mediocre service and keep returning.  With so many options in the area, can't say we'll risk it again as service is just as important as the food and menu."
Pejman G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,2,,2.0,11/11/2017,Horrible.... drinks took 20 min to make (she said the bar ran out of alcohol to me and made another excuse to the table behind us). Food took 30 min to come out; cold of course. Ooh and the water glass had a green mildew leaf stuck inside of it. I peaked it off and said please just don't bring water. It's hard to believe tysons mall has this kind of service and food.
Alex S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,34,3,1.0,5/4/2017,"I've regularly dined at the Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California, and those locations have great food and terrific servers who are professional and courteous. However, I was shocked at the rude service at the Tysons Corner location. A waitress named Linda R was unpleasant and downright rude to my best friend. She didn't smile once, had an annoyed unpleasant expression on her face, and rolled her eyes with maximum snark and disapproval when my friend politely asked if we could have our leftovers boxed up to take home. Based on her unprofessional behavior, I left her no tip because she didn't deserve one -- she ruined our dinner and made it an unhappy time. The food itself was poorly prepared, because I ordered my usual favorite dish, the Factory Nachos, and some tortilla chips were overly baked and a nearly burnt dark brown, with not enough sour cream, salsa or guacamole. The lighting in the restaurant is way too dim, as if they're trying to hide unsanitary and poorly cleaned conditions. Before we left the restaurant, we visited the pastry section where customers can buy cheesecake desserts to take home. After she saw that we didn't leave her a tip, Linda marched over to the pastry area and gave us a dirty look, as if she was trying to chase us out with intimidation. I discreetly asked another employee if I could speak to her manager, and I described to him the terrible experience we had due to Linda's incompetent, hostile behavior. I told him that I didn't want to get her in trouble, but maybe someone could gently remind her that it is her job to be courteous and polite to customers. He dismissively said he was sorry for our ordeal, but brushed it off and walked away unconcerned, and didn't try to make it right. I'd highly advise avoiding the Tysons location of the Cheesecake Factory, and diners should instead consider Maggiano's Italian restaurant next door that is run very professionally with outstanding servers."
B. M.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",1,28,40,4.0,8/26/2017,"Food and service is always good at this location... I always have to ask for bread which can be a blower depending on my mood... but I'm realizing nothing is ever perfect. Ordered my usual Cajun Chicken Littles I've been getting this since I was a little boy it's always been a nice size portion, leftovers are a guarantee."
Tristen A.,"Arlington, VA",286,51,26,5.0,12/22/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory will forever blow my mind. They have the most expansive menu I have EVER seen in a restaurant, and they make everything so well! I have had a few extremely different things from their menu.... I have had fish tacos, coconut shrimp, a salad off of the Skinnylicious menu, and more. I have never been disappointed, and the portions are so large that I always have plenty to bring home as a meal for the next day! I also love the Skinnylicious menu in general... it's so great of them to have all of the low-calorie options in one place. My most recent visit here was when I got the fish tacos. They were SO good. The fish was perfectly crisped, the guacamole on top was portioned properly, the side of rice wasn't too overpowered with the taste of lime.  The only complaint I had this time is that we had to ask for them to bring our bread - that is one of my favorite parts and something I highly look forward to."
Jes S.,"Toronto, Canada",86,113,235,4.0,5/1/2016,"I'm actually surprised that this location has only 3 stars. As a Canadian, whenever I see Cheesecake Factory, I'm instantly drawn to it, and want to indulge so badly. I came for a late dinner to this location and got the chicken Madeira. It was really good, and such a huge portion I could not finish! Even their steaks come in 14 oz.  For cheesecake we got the 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake. It also came in a large portion so I would recommend sharing. Definitely recommend this one if you love a chocolate overload."
K C.,"Annandale, VA",0,2,1,1.0,12/16/2017,The hostesses and waitresses were rude! The food/ service takes forever and it is sooooo bland! Wow! Just the worst experience ever! Never ever going back!
Jen R.,"Fairfax, VA",537,47,82,3.0,6/26/2017,"My boyfriend and I are Cheesecake Factory lovers. We went on a late Saturday night around 8:45pm. We walked in and the floors were a bit slippery and The temperature seemed to be a bit low. We got seated fairly quickly. We sat in a nice small booth, which felt cozy and romantic.  As an appetizer we got the edamame-delicious. We asked our waiter for only one basket of the wheat bread and we got that quickly. We normally order salads from the skinnylicious menu. This visit was no different, I got the factory chopper salad and he got the Mexican tortilla salad. Everything tasted great. However, I was not blown away by the service. It was a late night and our food took a long time to come out. The appetizer and main meal came out minutes a part. When we finally got our food, we didn't see our waiter for a long time. I ran out of water, which is a problem because I added Tabasco hot sauce to my salad. Service can improve and same with the slippery floors. Later, I noticed a family taking turns taking pictures and their was a group of wait staff just laughing and not paying attention to their clients, so I got up and took the family photo for the family. I know that's not part of food service, but it would have been nice if they were aware and could have offered. It's those little things that can go a long way! However, food was tastey as expected."
Joe M.,"Houston, TX",0,17,4,1.0,12/9/2017,15 minutes before a server comes over to acknowledge us.  Really?  Very disappointed.  No wonder this place only has 3 stars.   They need to find a GM who can fix this.  My relatives from out of town are Cheesecake Factory fans.....I would spend my money elsewhere after this experience.
Connie Y.,"Rockville, MD",254,97,1425,3.0,8/14/2016,"I believe we had a new waitress because the service was minimal, but on the upside she was really nice. We never got refills and had to ask for napkins and their complimentary bread.  Regardless, the three stars are for the food. My family started off with buffalo wings and fried calamari. While the calamari was crispy and tasty, the buffalo wings were tiny and over fried. I had a wing with only one bite, and at a price of $12.50 for 10 wings and wilting celery sticks, this was a disappointment. Then our entrees came, and I became even more disappointed! I had ordered the bistro shrimp pasta, one of my go-to dishes, only to discover there was no cream sauce added. I had to wait for them to bring out sauce only to have them bring out a tomato sauce! By the time I received my lemon-garlic cream sauce, everyone else was near finished with their meals. I did have my entree comped, so that was a pleasant surprise, but still. My mother's Cajun jambalaya shrimp pasta was delicious and flavorful as usual, with plenty of shrimp and soft noodles. Also be prepared to get their Bang Bang chicken and shrimp curry. It's an unappetizing bowl of rice sitting in a puddle of curry and meat chunks. I'm sure it tasted good though, since my uncle finished it.  For the desserts, we ordered the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake and the Chocolate Mousse. Both were too airy and not creamy enough. Whether it was the warm temperature of the cheesecakes or overwhelming amount of whip cream sprayed on top, we weren't pleased with their signature dessert! We've had better quality from the frozen section at Costco where they sell Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes!   Fortunately, we've had better service and food at The Cheesecake Factory, so I still plan to return in the future, but I sure hope they improve!"

Robert S.,"Washington, DC",2,8,,1.0,12/28/2017,"My wife and I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory several times, mostly at the Mclean location and usually with positive results. On Christmas Eve Day we decided to have brunch and arrived as they opened. My menu choice this time was chicken marsala and to say it was terrible is an insult to all things terrible. It had absolutely no taste or even a hint of flavor or seasoning. Usually when ordering this dish the standard way it is served is with a generous portion of sauce to go along with the chicken and pasta. Mine was dryer than the Sahara and I had to ask our server for some (not additional) sauce for my meal. It took about 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table as they had to prepare it from scratch. It really made no difference at all to the quality of my meal nor did it satisfy me at all. I made a comment to my wife that it was like I tried to make chicken marsala which would be amazing as I cannot cook nor do I even attempt but my wife is a very accomplished cook and baker. To make matters worse our server never returned our debit card we gave her to pay. My wife noticed two days later and had to drive 20 minutes each way to retrieve it. What is normally a very enjoyable experience at TCF on this day was a complete disappointment."
