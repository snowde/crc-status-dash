Mary S.,"Falls Church, VA",10,90,6,3.0,7/13/2015,"Hmm... I've been going here for years....quality has been decreasing or my palate has become more refined...the food doesn't taste as good as it used to. Also, the last time I went, I got 3 slices of cheesecake, 2 to take home and the slices were so small, I stuck two in one of the cheesecake boxes. It was a lot of whipped cream dressing or design, but the size of cheesecake was really small. Sad, I love dessert..."
Mike H.,"Vienna, VA",137,3,,4.0,6/23/2016,"I love this place!  friendly service, great food and serving sizes and good prices.  the service was a little slow because our server was new  but I can understand as I was in the restaurant business for years.  highly recommend this location!"
Liv P.,"McLean, VA",3,23,47,1.0,2/23/2015,"Huge fan of cheesecakes here- Called in today to place an order for 10inch strawberry cheesecake- I was running around all day so I was expecting my cheesecake to be READY when I get there. A guy name Danny was helping me and he asked me what kind of cheesecake I ordered. I said it and he goes I have to wait 4min. I asked him is it not ready- He talks back to me ""we don't make cheesecakes until the customer shows up, lots of times they don't show up and we have to waste them"" ......What? Really? Why the hell did you even take my order through the phone at the first place? If I knew it wasn't gonna be ready when I get there, I would've came earlier because I was running late. I was literally standing there for 15min for the cheesecake to be ready. I glanced over it and they were running out of strawberries so they used the tiniest left over strawberries and I was so mad. When the other guy was making it, he was giggling and chatting with the girl employee rather than making my cheesecake asap. So unprofessional. Employees need some improvements with the manners and professionalism."
Ouarda W.,"Ashburn, VA",0,2,,2.0,8/15/2015,"Very disappointing.  My steak medallions were way over cooked and sloppy mash potatoes and veggies.  Also my pinot grigio tasted way buttery I think it tasted more like Chardonnay. .. I don't understand why the same dish would taste differently in another Cheesecake factory location.  The one I had in the dulles location was spot on...anyway lesson learned, never come back to this location..."
Amanda G.,"Alexandria, VA",6,6,,1.0,1/13/2014,"I used to come to the Cheesecake factory a lot, but after this past visit, I will not eat at this location again. My mother, boyfriend, and I came here after a long day at Tysons II. We saw that the restaurant was not too busy so we figured it would be another good experience here; but it wasn't. First, our appetizers came out before our drinks. Second, it took well over 25 minutes to get a refill. Third, it took about an hour for the food to come out, may I remind you the restaurant was not busy. Four, when the food came out, it was not all together and was missing multiple side items and parts of the entree. Five, my food came out 15 minutes after my moms and boyfriends. I had ordered pasta and when I got to it, it was cold. Lastly, my boyfriend's catfish was not fully cooked and was raw on the inside.   I ended up going to the hostess stand to let the manager know about our experience and of course he did not have much to say. He disappeared for a while and when he finally came to our table he did not do much to resolve the issues. We ended up calling the corporate number and never got the chance to speak to someone nor got a call back.  I will definitely never eat at this location again."
Konark K.,"Herndon, VA",41,49,14,3.0,6/26/2015,Food & Service was good. This place is open till 1pm on weekends so best place to good food.
Teresa B.,"Pasadena, CA",440,304,466,5.0,9/1/2013,"I know what to expect when opting to eat at a ""chain"" restaurant, and this location totally met my expectations. No matter where I am travelling, from coast-to-coast, I am always happy with my experience at a Cheesecake Factory. The first thing I do is check the cheesecake options on display. Not that I always order a piece, yet I am comforted to know that I can have their lo-carb version at any location. Whether it be in Pasadena or Glendale, in California. Or at White Plains, NY, and even at a recent visit to my new neighborhood location in NOVA (Northern Virginia), I am always hooked on ordering the same thing. I generally plan my experience to be on a Sunday, mid-afternoon. I always order their Mushroom Burger. A ""Great Glamburger® Challenge Winner! With lots of Sauteed Mushrooms, Onions and Mayo, Covered with Melted Swiss and Fontina Cheese"".  I order it without a bun, and with a salad. And since it's around brunch time, I also order a side of two eggs, over medium. In any location, it's never been a problem to fulfill my request, and I savor every bite. At this location, my Boo tried their version of a California Cheesesteak: Thinly Sliced Grilled Steak Covered with Sautéed Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers and Cheese on Our Toasted Sourdough Loaf. Served with French Fries. He loved it! Thank you Cheesesteak Factory for always being a destination that I crave."
J A.,"Fairfax, VA",0,34,7,1.0,6/4/2016,Long story short they need a new chef... I have been to different locations and they one is the worst by far in taste and the food was cold but the location is excellent.
Jane H.,"Centreville, VA",137,21,3,1.0,7/14/2015,This is one of my favorite places to eat at and I had my birthday here last December and just wanted to say that when we reserved here for about 15 friends at a certain time we had to wait for our table for over 30min. because the server had said they were waiting on the people that was there before us unbelievable!! I will never come to this location after that...wouldn't it make more sense and more polite if we reserved a certain time and ask those people kindly that they have someone reserved for this table after them? Awesome food but very horrible service for your reservations here.
Connor B.,"Annandale, VA",0,3,,1.0,5/17/2016,I ordered a medium rare steak it was charred on the outside and gray in the middle. Would not go back
Lindsey H.,"Burke, VA",24,24,21,1.0,2/7/2015,"Our server was ricky. My parents arrived 20 minutes before my fiance and I. They already had drinks when we arrived but they were empty. So I figured the staff would see new people at the table and stop by. It took 20 minutes for them to come to the table. I ordered a soda and a cocktail, the cocktail which I waited another 20 minutes for, having to flag down and remind the server, which by this point we had almost received our food. I'm a light drinker and appreciate drinking my cocktail throughout the whole dining experience, not having to chug it all at once to get it in before I leave. I expect it get within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering. He didnt even ask if there was anything else he could get us, refills, bread, nothing, so inefficient .  While ordering food, my mother asked a question about the style of sauce a pasta dish came with- instead of finishing the order and finding out after, then coming back to confirm- the server turned his back and walked away from the table!  My fiance WANTED to order a chicken sandwich but wanted his sauce on the side, the waiter acted like he was stupid, pressing him to order something else that HE HIMSELF thought he should order, finally my fiance gave in and ordered the chicken littles to avoid further argument and frustrations. Maybe suggest something but don't force a change of mind on a customer.  My pasta alfredo- A watered down, broken/split (oil separated from milk product) supposed ""parmesan"" sauce/liquid which tasted of raw garlic, burning on my lips. There is no place for raw garlic in a fully cooked dish. When he delivered the food he came back with parmesan to grate, after that we didnt seem him ever again. He didn't come to ask if everything was ok or anything. It was almost like he would do anything to be away from the table, to get away as fast as possible. My family- including my fiance was satisfied with their meals.  My fiance asked for a box so the waiter brought 4 boxes. I didnt want to take anything home, as I was incredibly dissatisfied with my meal, which the waiter didn't know because he didnt care to ask. The waiter didnt just joke with me about leaving my plate but literally paused and told me ""how could you waste food like that? I would never leave that much food on the table. You can't just leave that, it's such a waste.""  Im sorry, im the one paying, and I paid for food that I didnt like. Maybe, if I barely ate anything, you should: ask if it's ok, if I enjoyed my meal, why I didn't enjoy it, what can I do to make it better.  But no I got a lecture on my wasteful ways.  How dare you force your views on a customer, how dare you force a customer to do something they don't want to. This led to my dad taking it home for my brother to shut him the hell up.  This is also what led me to write the review. I will not be told by my server that I have to take food home. All in all he was extremely unattentive and extremely rude when actually taking orders.  4 of us sat in a booth big enough for 2 people and the lights dimmed so we could barely read the dessert menu. The portions are way too big- which all of this I know isnt the service staffs fault. It just contributed to my irritation.  I had just finished a $2500 dinner/faschnact celebration service with one other cook in the kitchen at the establishment I work at, it went fantastically and I thought I was going to finish off the night with a great dinner and my parents who live hours away, only come to visit once a year if I'm lucky.  The only good things about the meal were the red raspberry cocktail, the bread, and the cheesecake. The service was awful.  Im sorry to leave such a harsh review. But I am extremely dissapointed."
Ayad A.,"San Diego, CA",25,8,,1.0,11/10/2014,"The cheesecake factory is well known to have outstanding customer service, delicious food and an overall great experience (it must be a California thing, people in the DC area don't get enough sunlight). I guess I had high expectations for a simple salad; definitely won't make that mistake again. So this is what happened!  A Greek salad is comprised with Romaine, onions, olives, bell peppers, cucumber, tomatoes and feta cheese. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, black pepper, pour the dressing, toss and serve (sounds easy enough) So I ordered a salad; all I wanted was Romain lettuce, feta cheese, grilled chicken breast and some salad dressing. Nothing too complex like ordering smoked halibut, filet mignon or even tuna tartare. Just a simple Greek salad!.... Where do I begin this review? Let's start off with the waiter shall we?  One; she didn't greet us when we sat down on the table, Two; I asked what's the specialty today? she couldn't recommend a Single dish on the menu, Three; (The restaurant usually serves warm wheat and white bread as a starter /appetizer so customers wouldn't get hungry while waiting for the main dish).... We were served hard cold bread, Four; 25 minutes later! she finally brings out our soft drinks, Five; coming from the Arctic kitchen she then brings out the food to the table. That's when everything went downhill from there. First off the chicken in my salad was raw and there was no feta cheese or salad dressing. My friend who was visiting DC from California; her nachos were frozen like our waiters attitude!.... Not once did the waiter come back to check in on us.  After all this frustration I asked to see the manager! (This should be interesting!) I expressed to the manager on duty that our service and food were both unacceptable. She replied stating ""I do apologize sir for any inconvenience that has occurred tonight is completely my fault"" (i'm glad there's an adult working here who realized this wasn't acceptable). She did apologize and recognized how disrespectful and rude our waiter was and offered to replace my meal only (not including my friends dish) and add a complementary cheesecake slice. I refused and replied ""you need to understand the situation, it's not about getting a free meal it's about managing your staff and serving your customers needs at best"". ""Is this not in Tysons Galleria? I receive better customer service at Harris Teeter's salad bar"". ""This is the Cheesecake Factory! your level of customer service is poorly represented and needs to change before you lose more and more customers in the future"". 15 minutes pass-by nothing happens? So we decided stand up from our table and simply walk away."
Dale J.,"Capitol Heights, MD",84,97,52,4.0,4/15/2014,They still got it good. 4/15 visit for Tax day lunch as I got a return. I still go for the crab cake sandwich. It is huge and much bigger than I remember 2 years ago. The size is something like a double cheeseburger at a restaurant it contained lumps of crab meat in the middle surrounded by backfin...no problem its a sandwich. Lightly seasoned and lightly fried and I tell you its very heavy for a crab cake sandwich. Im full.
Sofia L.,"Herndon, VA",45,43,39,5.0,1/5/2014,"Can't say much for the dining service but they have surprisingly -great- bar service for a chain restaurant. Our bartender (of whom I regretfully did not catch the name of) was a dream come true: attentive, hilarious and super accommodating. You know it's going to be a great time when your bartender tells you they can do and make anything for your sipping pleasure. As far as the food goes, the Ahi Carpaccio hits the spot every time and is consistently delicious. Only downside is how short the happy hour is. :("
Tracy B.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",5,6,1,4.0,7/31/2015,I went here for lunch before a concert. The place was pretty empty so the service was quick and friendly. The wait staff was very attentive. I would definitely go back. The food was good. I had the mushroom soup which I love but hardly ever get because they only serve it on Wednesday's. It was half price cheesecake day but I didn't take advantage of this deal. Maybe next time
Kerri M.,"Johnstown, PA",3,146,,5.0,6/30/2015,"This is our second Cheesecake Factory and I still really like it!  This location has it's own entrance with an elevator to take you to the second floor which is where the restaurant is located, no need to enter the mall area and take the escalator up.  When you enter via the elevator, you are greeted by the bakery and then a little walk away is the reception area to seat you.  We were seated right away on a Sunday at 5:00 PM.  The waiter was very nice and attentive.  We had the dynamic shrimp (it's a small plate but it's just right sized) and I had the miso salmon (YUM!) and my hubby had the meatloaf.  It was not the traditional type with the heavy gravy which I think he was looking for but he like the succotash that it came with.  I ordered the banana cheesecake to go."
Donalda C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,11,2,1.0,5/17/2015,"Here for a conference and I'm limited to mall options.  I ordered spinach dip, and when I bit into a chip, I realized it was rancid. RANCID, as in completely disgustingly nasty tasting and the chips had a stench that was unbelievably sour. -- Once I forgot some corn chips in my desk at work for about a year, and when I opened them, they smelled exactly the same as these. The bartender first said, ""they make them fresh every day!"" But then smelled them and agreed and got me new ones --- that process took 15 minutes --- and at the end of the meal, they actually CHARGED me for the spinach dip!  The Tyson's Galleria must've fallen on very hard times!  Did you guys really need to charge me for rotten food?  Unreal."
Leah D.,"Falls Church, VA",130,5,2,1.0,4/12/2016,"I went out to eat at this Cheesecake Factory and look what came with my order a LADYBUG.  I was so close to eating the ladybug, the manager was notified and all they did was take the salad away, remove it from the bill and offered for us to BUY another item from an even more limited menu because they  could  no longer offer the full happy hour selection (we initially ordered before 6 pm from the happy hour menu and the bug was found after 6 pm when our food was brought out). So even a manager couldn't assist with adjusting the price enlight of what happened??? Guess bugs are just business as usual at this made it worst was there was no formal apology for what I experienced. It was dismissed like this happens all of the time, because it comes directly from the farm (don't you inspect and rinse you food) . That is not a good excuse for a bug being in my food, if I did not inspect my food then I was eating it I would have eaten a ladybug with my salad. Which is unacceptable, and yes things happen but I did not appreciate the way the manager and waitress handled the situation like it was no big deal. Please customers inspect your food before you eat here."
Gerre I.,"Fort Washington, MD",0,3,,1.0,8/22/2015,"Where to start.. Ordered drinks 2 alcoholic and 3 sodas, and crabcake appetizer. The appetizer took 20 minutes to come out. Asked for mustard sauce to go with it that took another 10 minutes. Food arrived and batter on kids corn dog was still uncooked in places, my fettuccine Alfredo was dry and noodles stuck together, shrimp platter only had about 10 fries. In all service was extremely slow, food was disappointing. I will not be returning to this location. Would give 0 stars if I could."
Shell B.,"Bowie, MD",0,18,,1.0,4/11/2016,"The worse.  Overrated.  People just like to say I am at CF.  I really would like to meet the head chef if they have one.  Fridays is better than this crap.  It is always freezing in there i assume so people dont linger.  The waiter even warned us it is draft where she is about to seat us. WTF.  Why seat us there then?  The meatloaf, endless bland chicken entrees and overcooked severely charred burgers leave a lot to be desired.  Stick with their salads, cheesecake and appetizers.  Dont eat any of the entrees.  U have been warned and avoid the Tysons location."
