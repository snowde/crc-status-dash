Rabia D.,"Waldorf, MD",0,2,,2.0,5/29/2017,"The service was awful. It took forever to get bread and even just waters. The waitress seemed frustrated and invited the manager to help us & even the manager had an attitude. They were extremely impatient with us and had no type of respect. Even after we expressed our frustration and anger, the waitress continued to have an attitude. I am not here for it & will not he returning!!!"
Big Hoss H.,"Arlington, VA",0,13,,1.0,11/26/2016,"Very poor dining experience at this particular cheesecake and I will not return to another.  We were seated at a table of 6 at 12:37. They didn't take our order for food until 1:10 (yes - 33 minutes). It was embarrassing for everyone at the  table.  Then they brought the food (5 dishes) and forgot the sixth for the next 10 minutes. We were planning to wait, but it just became too long.  I assumed they would recognize this and adjust the check accordingly - they did not. 2 hour lunch and no effort to apologize.  Bottom line - don't eat at the Cheesecake Factory Tysons corner."
Z J.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,4,,2.0,12/10/2016,Went to Cheesecake on a Thursday night. It was busy but it did not seem overwhelming. We sat in a booth and we had to wait 20 minutes for service.  Someone in our party actually got up to tell the front desk we were not being served.   Cheesecake used to have exemplary service but now it is not the same.  I would prefer to spend my money on local restaurants where your visit is appreciated.
Jacqueline R.,"Germantown, MD",6,19,,4.0,12/8/2016,"Went here on a Saturday to celebrate multiple birthdays with two friends.  We had wonderful service, even tho we arrived at different times. The food was good - fresh and served hot.  Waiter gave us plenty of time to visit and eat, but checked in to make sure we had everything we needed.  Ordered our dessert take out, which worked great.  All staff was friendly and courteous."
Paula K.,"Alexandria, VA",64,6,1,1.0,11/17/2016,"Up front, I didn't go to this location, I didn't have to. The experience I had over the phone made me never want to visit this location! The person who answered the phone informed me that they don't take reservations on Saturday. No big deal. But to make me feel like a large party is an inconvenience, maybe we could get together another night, and tell me that tables ""should"" be saved for smaller parties on busy nights is ridiculous. And when I asked for an estimate of how long of a wait we could expect, I was told, I have no idea it varies week to week. To the girl who answered; I'm so sorry to have inconvenienced you. I'll stick to Potomac Mills, thanks for saving me the gas."
Nadine F.,"Brussels, Belgium",347,1076,5,3.0,2/22/2015,"This location entirely met my expectations for Cheesecake Factory.  We received a gift card recently, so we've been here a couple of times in the past few weeks.  Service has always been good and reasonably fast. The food is exactly what you expect from a Cheesecake Factory.  They have hundreds (or is it actually in the thousands?) of menu items, and all are just OK.  The cheesecake just isn't worth the calories for me at this particular location, when there's the delicious Danielle's Desserts making higher quality, fresher items on the same floor of the same mall.  And if you're going for flavor and quality of food, there are definitely better restaurants inside the mall (all of them).   However, if you want to feed many people on a budget or have leftovers to eat for lunch for several days, Cheesecake Factory is a good option.  Their entrees contain what should be between two and five servings for a reasonable human being.   I appreciate that since the last time I was here, which was fine to ten years ago, they've added a skinny menu, and the veggie burger was bland, but not terrible.  We also got a piece of cheesecake to go, and it tasted like it had been previously frozen and hadn't been thawed all the way, so I probably won't be getting any cheesecake here again as I try to use up my gift card.   The happy hour specials are solid, so that would be my main reason to return."
Sergey V.,"Minato, Japan",8,53,14,2.0,8/7/2016,"I always loved to come here over the years. For some reason the service has really gone down hill at this cheesecake over my last few visits. The food is the same as the other Cheesecake Factories, but the service is awful.  THE GOOD: cheesecake, nutrition info in plain site for skinnylicious menuLots of menu items with decent variety. Kids menus. THE BAD: hostesses are rude - no eye contact, very short and impolite. We counted 12 empty tables while we waited 20 minutes for a table, we were overcharged $8. Kids drinks are included in kids meals. My 5 year old daughter ordered apple juice. They were out and offered her orange juice when the bill came I noticed an extra $8 for the drink. Will not return to this one."
Isidora K.,"Virginia Beach, VA",13,12,3,1.0,5/3/2017,I think this might be the worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to. What a disaster!!!!!
L V.,"Washington, DC",0,19,4,1.0,8/10/2016,"When we arrived we gave the hostess the name on the reservation and she could not find it because it was not noted under the correct name. We were told that there was no table ready for us. After waiting for twenty minutes they brought us to a groups of tiny tables in the bar section that had been pushed together, instead of seating us in the dining room. After we placed our orders, we waited for awhile. The waiter only brought entrees for two of the people in our group. The rest of us sat there for another half hour waiting for our meals.  I ordered one of the simplest entrees to prepare, fettuccini Alfredo. The waiter brought a large plate of over cooked pasta. When I tasted it it was literally a mouthful of flour. It took a long time for the waiter to return to our section, and he was ignoring us. When he finally came to our table I told him that the Alfredo sauce was missing from my dish. He did not take the dish and he left the area again.  After another long wait we motioned to the waiter. I told him once again that the dish needed the sauce. Again he left without taking the dish. After another long wait we asked another waiter for the Alfedo sauce. By now everyone else had eaten their entree. Our waiter finally appeared with a very small container of a basic white sauce, not Alfedo sauce, which contains cheese.  There was another long wait to hail the waiter. This time I picked the dish up and handed it to him and said to bring it back to the kitchen for Alfredo sauce. When the dish came out it had the same tasteless basic white sauce with no cheese in it, not Alfedo sauce. By now everyone else was well into their desserts, and I gave up on dinner. This is the first adverse experience I have had at this chain, and I am surprised at how this restaurant has gone downhill at this location. The staff's poor attitude toward the customers will absolutely keep me out of this location from now on. There are so many great restaurants to enjoy nearby!"
Melissa R.,"Woodbridge, VA",32,21,34,3.0,2/3/2016,"I went for happy hour which is 4-6pm. There were a wide variety of drinks and food options ranging from $5.50-$6.95. I shared the chicken sliders, nachos and Cuban rolls with my husband and we both had mojitos. The 3 chicken sliders came with mayo and another sauce on the side and were tasty. The nachos were topped with cheese, guac, tomato sand peppers were nothing to write home about. Left a weird burnt type aftertaste. The Cuban rolls were our favorite albeit greasy.  Mojitos needed a little more sugar and rum. The bartender was nice and attentive. We had more enough food and even took a box to go."
Maryam R.,"Great Falls, VA",0,4,,1.0,5/20/2017,Just went there for lunch. My kids chicken tenders had no meat on them. It took forever for them to bring our food. My Louisiana Chicken Pasta had no sauce on it. Horrible service. Server and manager were not even apologetic about it. Won't be going back.
Yolanda B.,"Stafford, VA",0,3,,1.0,8/11/2016,"8/11/2016 Don't consider Cheesecake Factory for after work events/celebrations! Especially if you have 8 or more people. Was just informed by Manager Barry Suber he is working so they won't take large parties for happy hour anymore!!!  After waiting over an hour to get our food, some folks longer,  he NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED FOR THE WAIT OR INCONVENIENCE!  Instead he blamed the server and the party size on his inadequacy as a manager.   As a manager I expected him to CARE, see that his employee needed help and to assist or resolve the issue. He never once offered anything- a cheesecake to share or anything. He simply had an attitude and acted as though we were a problem for him.  If there is a CHEESECAKE UNIVERSITY- not sure how he passed!  Rethink your visit!"
Ging C.,"Louisiana swamps, LA",0,63,,2.0,7/24/2016,"Sometimes the servers seem a little...unconcerned about their customers.  My order of 3 menu items today had 2 not quite right/missing sauce.  I'm also not a fan of how close I have to sit to strangers.  Remove a table, slow down and get orders more correct."
Jesse S.,"Little Elm, TX",108,782,26,1.0,1/2/2015,"Came to this location at 5pm with a party of 9. Our waiter didn't take our order for 30 minutes. After waiting another 30 minutes, our kids' meals and salads came. One kid's meal was totally wrong, one was missing the side dish, and a salad had the wrong dressing. After another half hour, our entrees were served. One entree was missing a substitution, one entree had the wrong side dish, and one entree had overcooked/stale rice that was inedible.  Just to summarize, out of 9 items that were ordered, 2 were correct and 7 were wrong, and the wait time to get our incorrect entrees was 1.5 hours. I had to send my entree back and instead of remaking it, they removed the incorrect item and gave it back to me. It was served completely cold.  I found the restaurant manager and notified him of all the problems we had encountered during our visit. Neither the manager nor the server apologized for the poor service, the service did not improve after I complained, and we were not given any credit or discount off our check or offered a free desert or anything like that.  We were at the restaurant a total of 2.5 hours due to the slowness of getting our check and getting our credit cards back. I attempted several times on 1/2/2015 to contact Ajay, the restaurant general manager, but was not able to contact him. I was first told he would be in in the morning, so I called at 9:30am. I was told to try back in an hour. At 10:30am, I was told to try back around 11:30am. I called again at 11:40am and was told he's still not there and to try back later. Nobody seemed to know when the general manager would be present. I called again at 1pm and was told he's busy and would have to call me back. I find the service we experienced to be offensive and unforgivable. I also find it disturbing that the manager made no attempt to rectify the situation. Although I almost never do this, I left a $0 tip, since our waiter clearly could care less about doing his job correctly. I think there is a serious lack of proper management at this location and I doubt I will ever return."
Justine S.,"Annandale, VA",336,299,536,3.0,12/22/2014,"I am not a fan of restaurant chains, but if it's the desire of the masses to dine here (this time my family), then why not! What makes this place great is that it's good for groups, their menus are extensive, and the portions are ever so generous for the price. They also have a skinny menu! (But it's not that much of a health conscious difference.)  However, in my opinion the quality of their food is just OK. I've had plenty of dishes from here from pastas, salads, cheesecakes (obviously their staple), etc. I'm unsure if they use frozen products, but something is always off for me. I want to love this place, but I always end up having an average experience. This time around I ordered the herb-crusted salmon salad- my salmon was cooked pretty well but it, along with my vegetables (not talking about the lettuce)-- was pretty much tasteless.  In addition, they are located inside the mall so it can get pretty busy and the wait for seating and/or food is always unpredictable especially because they don't take reservations!  I will continue to come here only at the bidding of a friend."
Logan G.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2,93,14,4.0,9/2/2016,"Being a big fan of Cheesecake Factories, I was a bit disappointed by this one. The food was what you'd expect, but the service was nothing more than average, which is usually exceptional at other locations."
Mimi E.,"Springfield, VA",50,11,,1.0,7/1/2016,"My coworkers and I ordered for lunch (carryout). Had to wait in line for about 15 minutes just to pick up our food. It wasn't the employees fault (he was rushing like crazy) they were very busy and looked pretty understaffed. The bill came to 80+ for a burger, three lunch pasta dishes and a meatball appetizer. The food was awful. The burger was decent but way over cooked. The pasta dishes were super bland and over cooked and the shrimp smelled like it was bad. The two Cajun pastas the guys ended up adding ketchup and Montreal steak seasoning too so it wasn't as bad. I threw out the shrimp alfredo it was sauce-less and bland. Also so over cooked it was gummy and the shrimp was tough and had a bad smell to it. The meatball appetizer was excellent and that is what I ate for my meal. For the amount of money this cost we will absolutely never order from here again."
Mike S.,"Dundalk, MD",3,135,50,2.0,7/30/2016,We really just stopped for a couple of appetizers while shopping. The crispy Cuban rolls were really good. My wife got the meatballs with ricotta. The meatballs were a bit tough and dry but the sauce was fairly good. We had great service. The place is LOUD and just not very comfortable.
Vandad C.,"Fairfax, VA",106,202,163,3.0,1/10/2015,"It's a cheesecake factory. You probably know what it's like. The menu isn't particularly interesting even though it's the size of an encyclopedia. Service is always terribly slow at this location. Do not go for work-hour lunches here, you will be stuck forever.  Getting cheesecake to go at the counter by the elevator is the only redeeming quality of this place."
Jenn D.,"McLean, VA",146,53,,3.0,8/15/2016,I used to work for CCF back in CT and it was phenomenal. Service and food were always on point. This particular CCF is very disappointing. Food is mediocre and I've only had great service one time I've been there out of many. However I'll keep going because I love their menu. Oh well!
