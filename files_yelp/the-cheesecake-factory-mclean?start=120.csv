Soheil S.,"Olney, MD",12,5,1,1.0,3/31/2017,"Personally, I would never go back to this Cheesecake factory again.. I spent over $100 on food and drink last night for two people. I think, I deserve to be in peace for 2 hours but the waitress are so pushy trying to take away your plates and food even though they can obviously see your plates are half full.  We had to remind them several times them to leave us alone... this is not a place I want to go back to again"
Mansoor S.,"Elk Grove, CA",2,50,23,1.0,5/29/2016,"This is my third time here, and the servers have a really bad attitude, no refills, no smiles nothing. Bathrooms are also very dirty"
Mohammad Sajjad H.,"Washington, DC",43,73,48,4.0,8/2/2016,"Tried the fish n chips, combo steak and shrimp, buffalo winggs and a chicken dish. Fish was good. Steak was nice too. Buffalo wings were the best. Topped it off with a strawberry cheesecake. Nice experience overall"
Nia S.,"Woodbridge, VA",1,11,14,2.0,3/26/2016,"WARNING: REAL & HONEST REVIEW(CONTINUE TO READ AT YOUR OWN RISK) Went shopping around the tysons corner area today and decided to stop and have lunch at the cheesecake factory. I must say i had an overall weird experience. My waiter was very unusual and creepy acting. He was attentive to every table he was serving except for ours. I had to get his attention numerous times for drink refills and a check, even though he was very assisting to the other tables. He was somewhat nice but his actions were rude. I'm starting to think his lack of assistance had something to do with my mother and I. Not sure what we did, but it felt personal :/ I shouldnt have to feel that way leaving any establishment.  I usually like cheesecake factory food, but at this one, it was not so great. I ordered simple and got a pepperoni pizza with a side of fries. My mother ordered some sort of tamale. My pizza was poorly made and cheese wasnt covered on a part of it. Also my fries were partially burnt. HOW CAN YOU MESS UP FRENCH FRIES? My mothers tamale had a very foul odor. Almost a  ""musk"" kind of smell. We had went to another cheesecake factory over at potomac mills a couple weeks back and it had absolutely no foul odor. We did not order any dessert because of the much time wasted while the waiter was getting the check. Wish i could tell you his name but he didnt even tell us...  The cheesecake factory has terrible wait times. Plus it was a saturday evening so i was expecting to be sitting and waiting for a table for atleast half an hour. But to my surprise, we were seated immediately. Hardly anyone was there and practically some areas were empty. (WHICH IS WHY I DONT KNOW WHY THE WAITER SUCKED) A couple that had just been seated a few tables back yelled at my waiter and was very frustrated for no one assisting them. They had been sitting there for quite some time now, and i could see their faces starting to frown. At the same time, waiters a few feet behind them were slacking and having side conversations and giggling while they could have helped that couple. Overall, the staff needs to be more attentive.  I will try my best to avoid coming back to this crusty beat down over priced establishment again. Please do the same. I know many more clean cheesecake factories that will actually NOTICE you are there(Potomac Mills one isnt so bad) I will not be surprised when this establishment gains a bad reputation. The waiters there just dont care.. I will be more than happy to take my hard earned money and spend it at a mcdoanlds that knows how to properly run a restaurant than this place. EDIT: My waiters name was Rahul! His deep voice is very prominant(You'll know when its him) I see other yelpers have had bad experiences with him too. I suggest you request another waiter if you receive him. No shade to Rahul, but if youre reading this...YOU SUCK!"
Des B.,"Hyattsville, MD",3,9,4,1.0,1/21/2017,"They deserve zero stars! Customer Service was terrible, didn't even stay. I actually had to call corporate. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time here."
Wing K.,"Vienna, VA",17,109,39,4.0,11/13/2015,"Went on an early Tuesday evening. Interesting to go to the Cheesecake factory after hearing about it in my life whether its from the Big Bang Theory or elsewhere. In any case, TBBT is inaccurate on the depiction of the Cheesecake factory.  It was a party of 8. For appetizers we had nachos, summer rolls, and wontons. The nachos were ok albeit I've had better. The wontons also ok. The summer rolls very subpar. Whoever had the idea to put shrimp and noodles in a spring roll wrapper to create this particular summer roll is clearly an idiot.  My party had crab cakes, steak, pasta, and some other items. For the most part, everybody liked their entrees. I had a crusted salmon kale salad. It was very good. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the kale was sliced well. The dressing was also good. Overall, entrees were good. Everybody got cheesecake to go. I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee cheesecake. It was good, but could have certainly had a stronger coffee or kahlua taste to it. The sweetness of the chocolate overwhelmed the other two flavors. Nevertheless I enjoyed it.  Would probably go to the Cheesecake factory again. Its semi-affordable for the area and a decent value. Service was good, my water was refilled. The margaritas were good apparently."
Ash C.,"Washington, DC",534,294,490,3.0,6/26/2014,"What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Cheesecake Factory? Yeah you got it right; CALORIES!!! Oh is that not what you were thinking?!  TCF is one of the unhealthiest restaurants in America and even though I am not the healthiest person on earth, I try to stay away from waist-blasters like TCF. That doesn't mean I don't love the delicious array of cheesecakes lined up in the front. Whoever had that idea was def a marketing genius! How convenient: Name the restaurant Cheesecake factory and line up cheesecakes in the front so no one goes out once they decide to step in. Thus is the reason I dont enter this forbidden place much because I know once I do, I would have to grab a bite of that sinful cheesecake and order a 2000 calorie laden humongous dish."
Avery K.,"McLean, VA",0,2,,2.0,8/28/2016,"Since this is a very large chain restaurant, you pretty much get the big idea about it by going to one location. Though I obviously haven't been to every single Cheesecake Factory location, this one particularly stands out to me in a negative way. I have been a few times for certain dinners / lunches over the course of this year and have found myself disappointed more and more following each visit. Every single time, the service was slow, staff was rude, and food arrived cold. If you're thinking about going to a restaurant in the Galleria, just go to Maggiano's or Legal Sea Foods."
Melody M.,"McLean, VA",0,32,64,4.0,12/26/2014,"I come here often, considering the location is convenient for me since it's in the Tysons Galleria aka the upscale mall of McLean. There's no doubt they call it 'Cheesecake Factory' as the cheesecake is SUPERB! I'm not kidding..I don't see how NY cheesecake is that much better. In fact, the oreo dream extreme cheesecake here is out of this world!!! Rich fudgy milk chocolate frosting, creamy original cheesecake, THE BEST OREO MOUSSE, and chocolate cake into one. If this doesn't describe heaven, I don't know what does. I've also had the pumpkin cheesecake which is excellent! Rich but not overpowering.  The bread they bring you here is to die for! Sometimes the servers are a bit slow to bring the bread, but don't be shy and get your bread! It's too good in fact whenever I'm here I ask for an extra basket. :) The basket comes with brown and white bread, and the brown is my fave. It's like a sweeter bread, I always ask for more!! Onto the food, I've only had the pizza which is actually pretty good. I know people would probably think pizza from here is mediocre, but it's actually good. The crab cake appetizer is AMAZING!! You have to try this. They come with 6 mini crab cake bites, which are perfectly fried and steaming hot. No joke, I think they're better than the crab cakes at The Palm. Now I only wish they had this as an entree...they probably do. The only downside is that they usually give you a table in the dark, so I have to always request to change it. Sometimes the staff aren't too nice about that and make you wait a bit longer. Once you get a good table though, the atmosphere is pretty cool and makes you feel like you are at a fancier restaurant than you actually are."
CW L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,102,,1.0,10/22/2016,"I went to the bakery to get some cheesecake to go. As I was leaving I turned a corner and a server bumped into me with a tomato dish. I was covered in food and the server instead of apologizing said that I should not have come out of that corner. When I spoke to the manager instead of apologizing he said that if the stains in my jeans and sweatshirt did not come out I should submit a bill to him and he would pay for the dry cleaning. I would not waste any more of my time submitting a bill, although the jeans were $200 dollar jeans and the evening ruined.  The situation was handled poorly by the customer service staff. I will never return to this restaurant and will urge friends and co-workers to do the same."
Jc K.,"Fairfax, VA",0,10,,5.0,1/8/2017,"Come here on regular... came here for dinner on Friday night. Eddie, the server, was the best! He was so nice & sweet. He's by far the best server experience. Eddie made sure our meal & drinks were up to expectations & ensured we left on a full, happy tummy. :)"
Takil B.,"Fairfax, VA",3,18,7,4.0,1/5/2016,Great place. Fresh grilled salmon is the best. And the french baguette! They are almost always very crowded and that does reflect on the service.  Go non-peak hours for fast and friendly service.
Susu J.,"Washington, DC",42,43,42,5.0,6/6/2016,"My favorite dish there is avocado rolls and the chicken Madeira is always great, my favorite sweet is red velvet cheesecake, sometimes the service is too slow but can't complain as the place is always full."
Gibb S.,"Warrenton, VA",0,22,,4.0,1/13/2017,"This is a staple restaurant for us due to its proximity to the office in McLean. However, it has proved to be very consistent with service and quality of food. Very recommended!"
Davis V.,"Bethesda, MD",0,17,,1.0,12/29/2015,"Went for birthday party.  Ordered Cheesecake (not sure which one but one that has strawberries in).  I bite once, it tasted bitter and vinegar.  Cheesecake was spoiled long ago.  Multiple other dishes were too salty or not seasoned properly. Best dishes ever I had in my life."
Kevin K.,"Alexandria, VA",4,56,36,5.0,6/15/2016,"Came here for my gf's birthday and the environment is very up scale. The waiter was very helpful and food was very good, i would recommend to anyone."
Shida M.,"Alexandria, VA",14,47,7,1.0,2/13/2016,"The food was really bland, no flavor or actual sauce in any of our pasta dishes. The $10+ alcoholic beverages our table ordered barely had any alcohol in it, very weak drinks so it was the most expensive  $100 we spent on soda water ever. Will not be returning."
Marquita P.,"McLean, VA",12,58,82,5.0,6/25/2015,"Good food, fast service and a friendly staff. It was busy but the kitchen got our food out fast and hot! The spaghetti and meatballs were good (kids) and the Greek Salad had plenty of fresh yumminess going on! We will be back!"
Mary C.,"Washington, DC",45,358,63,3.0,4/26/2014,"So sorry but this visit will be my last.  Why?  No nutritional information.  I cook a lot and watch calories a bit, and I do try to watch carbs.  So basically protein and veggies are my mainstay.  I decided on the chicken shrimp sausage gumbo.  Very tasty and came with a huge mountain of white rice.  I parceled out the amount of rice my carbs allowance allows and enjoyed it.   I looked for a smaller desert and finally settled on a dish of chocolate ice cream.  Good quality ice cream.  Whipped cream was too dense and a bit greasy.  I didn't order it with whipped cream and I don't recall the menu mentioning whipped cream, but there it was.   Spouse had salmon miso and tiramisu.  Again, nicely prepped and prettily presented.   Noise level outrageous and not suitable for hubby who forgot his hearing aid.  Wait staff knows their stuff and is prompt without being over-bearingly close.   I thought the holding of the chair was a nice touch. Chairs had no place to hang a purse; table was too crowded and if you put it on your lap, it kept falling through the sides of the chairs.   They seems to handle crowds well. Bar was crowded and person next to us was raving about the bartender.   They are way behind the times in providing healthier alternatives -- my gumbo had a whopping 2700 calories -- it could easily be made for 700 without sacrificing flavor or quality.  Maybe I should have read the skinny menu more closely, but all it appeared to have was salads and burgers."
David D.,"Washington, DC",30,9,,1.0,12/15/2015,"Were there 2 days ago. Before I was in other C.F. restaurants. I thought that this one in McLean will be same good quality. NO WAY. Personnel is so ""busy"". I don't know even are they really busy, or just kicking order to each other. As a result we were waiting almost 25 min to get the meal. Then again and again. Waiting for extra orders. Same story. Waiting for bill. Same story. Completely different from other locations. Management need to pay strong attention to the personnel. No more visit to this location. Low level customer service and poor attention to customer's need. 1 star. Not recommend"
