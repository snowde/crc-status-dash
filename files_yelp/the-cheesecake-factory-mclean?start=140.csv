Sara W.,"Alexandria, VA",94,219,166,2.0,2/24/2015,"While the atmosphere and the cheesecake were great, the food (where it counts) was sub-par. Fries were cold and soggy, sandwich was meh - even the martini wasn't the one we ordered. So, as for a full dinner experience this location gets two stars for me and we'll try somewhere else in the area next time. That is, unless we're just looking for cheesecake! We got the s'mores and Oreo cheesecakes, s'mores was the better way to go between the two if you can't decide. Who doesn't love marshmallow sauce?"
Robert L.,"Newark, DE",2,34,3,2.0,12/20/2015,"Ordered a curbside burger with no cheese, arrived to find cheese on the burger. I asked for another one with no cheese, they brought it back out to me again with cheese after waiting another 15 minutes. They offered nothing for such poor service. I will not be back."
Jodie R.,"Vienna, VA",47,58,104,3.0,6/11/2015,"** 3.5 stars ** The Cheesecake Factory is always a great place to go if you have a big group or celebrating a birthday. They accommodate for groups very well.  I came to eat around 7PM with a group of 17 people (HUGEE I know -- it was for a birthday celebration and the birthday boy chose this place). The menu has more than 250 items (crazy right @__@), so it has great variety; however, for an indecisive person like me -- it's a struggle choosing something *sobs* We ended up waiting about 30-40 minutes for food (but probably because we had such a big group). I ended up eating the Tuscan Chicken, and also mooched off the Four Cheese Pasta my friends got. The food was good, but nothing too special. The Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake is AMAZING though. It may have been too sweet for some of my friends, but anything with oreos is just godly *^* Our waitress was great, I loved her attitude and she was really nice to all of us. I can't imagine having to serve 17 people or even more... The Cheesecake Factory is also great because they're more then willing to make modifications to your food. For example; you can ask for them to prepare your meal without added salt, have the dish come with another pair of sides, etc. Also, they give HUGE proportions so you're definitely getting your money's worth! Other than that, I wouldn't really come here if not for a big occasion with a group or if a friend wanted to go."
Theresa K.,"Springfield, VA",17,96,138,1.0,1/25/2015,"I don't know why we came back to this restaurant but we had to use a gift card that my bf had. We hoped that maybe we were too harsh the last time and perhaps we would be pleasantly surprised. Wrong. Our waitress seems in a rush and kind of annoyed that we only ordered one entree and two small plates. Sorry that we can't finish the supersize portions that are served at your restaurant? We ordered their lettuce wraps, Greek faro salad, and their Louisiana pasta. The lettuce wraps were okay as well as the salad. The pasta was dry and although it did have a nice spicy kick to it, we started to feel queasy after we ate and I think the greasiness of their dish upset our stomachs. Not sorry to say that we won't be returning here!! We tried to give it another chance but it just didn't cut it."
Jenny K.,"Alexandria, VA",0,8,,1.0,11/30/2016,"Don't EVER come to this location!!! I was there today 11-30-16 at 2:00pm josh the sever there at the bar was so rude and disgusting. My coworkers and I will never come to this establishment ever! A pond arriving there we were not greeted no menus were giving to us, he told us that we were rude because we were saying hello and asking for menus after (waiting 5 mins) I don't understand if you hate your job that much why do you work there? I don't care that you were the only person  (he clearly mention this to us that he was the only one at this section)at this section if staffing issues is YOUR concern you ADDRESS that with your manager. And pointing at a customer is disrespectful and embarrassing. My coworker had tears in her eyes because she was so shocked and embarrassed by the way she was treated. After calling the manager grace I am reassured that nothing will happen this place is terrible!!!! And I will be writing to corporate!!!"
A A.,"Springfield, VA",3,93,1,2.0,10/1/2016,"We went with a group of six people for lunch on Saturday. This was my first time visiting the Tysons location. Unfortunately, the experience was not very pleasant. We had to wait over 25 minutes just to get water and bread. Our food took more than 45 minutes and when we ordered cheesecake, it took almost 15 minutes. The worst part is, that it wasn't even crowded, perhaps only 75% full. But the thing that really irritated us, was when we ordered coffee, the mug was dirty (there were coffee stains on the holder and mug) and the coffee was ice cold. When we asked the server why he bought us such cold coffee, he said that he knew it 'seemed' cold. If he knew it was cold, he shouldn't have brought it to the table. Ridiculous! He went on to warm the coffee and returned with the same mug! I later refused to drink from the mug. He was kind enough not to charge us for the coffee, but we were so extremely disappointed."
Wafaa S.,"Fairfax, VA",14,28,1,1.0,12/26/2015,I wish I could say we had the worst service on a friend's babyshower but we had NO SERVICE period-Carla has no clue what service is and doesn't need to be in this kind of work- thank God for David who kept helping us though he wasn't our server
Justin J.,"Alexandria, VA",41,1,,5.0,11/26/2016,"Best service I ever had. Our waiter ""Felix"" was the man let me tell you. He made us feel comfortable, and was very act8ve with our 17 month old son. I was very impressed with the Cheesecake Factory's Service. Will be back very soon! Thank You!"
Brittany M.,"Austin, TX",84,454,131,5.0,10/8/2013,"As terrible as it is for my wallet and my waistline, I love me some Cheesecake Factory. I've been to this one a handful of times over the past few years and have never had a bad experience. We usually fail to make reservations and have a bit of a wait, but beyond that, the specialty drinks (I usually try for a skinny to offset my cheesecake a bit,) the food (ahi tuna salad!,) and the cheesecake (from oreo to dulce de leche to red velvet and beyond) are just to die for.  We also have a habit of going in to pick up a slice for a special occasion, so if you're interested in doing that and are ordering more than one slice, you're really better off ordering an entire cheesecake due to the pricing structure. Gain a few pounds, lose a few dollars, eat here, YUM."
Mary K.,"Leesburg, VA",0,6,2,1.0,9/5/2015,"My husband picked up cheesecake on Tuesday, 9/1.  After dinner at home I was sharing my Red Velvet piece with my toddler.  He took a bite which had a clear piece of plastic in it.  Thank goodness he did not swallow this.  I'm very disappointed that I contacted the location and have yet to receive a response."
Valencia W.,"Annandale, VA",102,782,8,4.0,3/12/2015,I feel like once you've been to one cheesecake factory you've been to all of them. It's clean and the service I've had has been great. I would return.
Evan B.,"McLean, VA",111,20,1,3.0,3/15/2016,"Food is typical of a Cheesecake Factory. As far as I'm concerned, they're all pretty similar. The service is usually very good here. the bartenders are especially friendly."
Sharcoal E.,"Vienna, VA",23,23,35,3.0,4/17/2014,"My favorite is the pasta da vinci...its made with penne pasta,madeira sauce,mushrooms,and carmelized onions. The taste is flavorful compared to any other dishes and its not typical. So it is a must have when you go to cheesecake factory. It wont disappoint you. The rest of the pasta entrees are just typical that you can get in other restaurant. For a salad, try the Luau Salad. Its fund and colorful. It has a layer of a crunchy sheet and the salad dressing is on the vinegerette/sweet balsamic side. It has chicken and lots of colorful veggie salad. I also like thr crunchy cuban rolls if you like a meaty appetizer...they also have crunchy avocado rolls if your on the vegetarian side. For the complimentary bread, go for the honey wheat. I like their chocolate cake with coconut :)"
Maria M.,"Laurel, MD",37,23,9,3.0,3/7/2016,I was there on 3/5/16 in the evening and there was no wait time and service was good. I got Chicken Madeira  (not sure that's how you spell it) but it wasn't as tasteful as I've had before. It was bland but decent. Also had salted caramel cheesecake and that was a winner.
Jim P.,"Alexandria, VA",1,25,5,4.0,9/30/2016,"This restaurant always seems to deliver pretty well, and this evening was no exception. Our waiter (Monte G.) was very attentive and never left us waiting for anything. If I could get that type of service elsewhere around this area, I'd be one happy diner. Keep up the good work Monte."
Nicole Z.,"Manassas, VA",3,7,1,5.0,1/19/2016,Food was wonderful! Long Island Ice Tea was great! Service was fantastic!
Dinah W.,"Alexandria, VA",165,98,262,1.0,9/25/2015,"The above rating is based on waiter service. The restaurant and food is a solid 4 star rating. This particular Cheesecake Factory is located at Tysons Corner mall in McLean Virginia. Parking spaces we're not very limiting and they offer valet service at this particular mall. I've found it to be a little bit too overpriced because you have to pay the cost of the valet + tip. In my opinion this is a complete waste of money if you are capable of walking from the parking lot to the mall. There wasn't a long wait and I was able to be seated immediately. A little while later, our waiter came by and dropped off the menus and whisked away without asking if we needed anything to drink. He returned about ten minutes later and proceeded to ask what we'd like to drink. He took 15 minutes to return with the drinks and the Sierra Mist was extremely flat and distasteful. He took our drinks back, returned 10 minutes later, and left once more to tend to another table. It took a while before he came back to our table to take our order. When he finally made it, he took our menus and asked if we'd like refills. When he did, we asked if we could get bread for the table as well. It didn't take him as long this time around, but when he returned with the drinks, he was in such a frenzy, he spilled drink on me while refilling my cup. He didn't offer paper towel or additional napkin. He just took off to take care of another table at the far end. When our food finally came, one of my friend's meal wasn't the correct order. The food did not  belong to another table either, so we had to wait some more. After we were done eating, he came by pretty quickly with the check and returned our cards back to us in far less time it took for him to actually serve the table. He still got a tip of course, but after this experience, I don't believe we will ever return to this location for dine-in."
Cameron H.,"Sterling, VA",4,918,1,4.0,9/6/2016,"Came here for lunch yesterday, service at the bar was amazing. Their lunch and skinny menus are also very good!"
Mariah S.,"Washington, DC",69,316,620,4.0,1/21/2015,"Did a take out of chicken lettuce wraps and a slice of cake. Funny how the cake cost more than the wraps but whatever! I love the wraps, the filling of chicken, shitake mushrooms, and crispy rice noodles is savory and mouthwatering. I order this every time I dine here. It can be an entree but really enough for one somewhat hungry person. After placing my order, it took 15-20 minutes thus 4 stars since it took so long for an appetizer item."
Susie H.,"Tacoma, WA",18,12,2,1.0,6/21/2016,"I'm pretty disappointed in this location. Surprisingly this location is not even busy for the dinner hour, should have been a sign it wasn't going to be a good experience. Our server took 15 mins to greet us and take our order. The bread was so stale and hard. My sons root beer was so watered down that it was a caramel color rather than the normal brown color. It's 30 mins in and we have yet to receive our food. The cheesecake chain I know is on top of customer service and provides food that is hot and fresh, not this location, however."
