Preet M.,"Clarksburg, MD",1153,103,60,4.0,1/20/2015,"Service: I came here today for lunch as a part of a 35 person party. Our waitress, Karen was awesome. She took care of us and even let all of us split the bill between our group. We asked her what was easiest for her but she made sure to tell us whichever payment method we wished to use was ok with her. Food did take kind of long to come out but I mean we went with 35 people. Although I don't know if that means service would be slow on a packed Saturday night as well. In Either case, today was impressive. Food: I got the Smokehouse and was very satisfied. Cooked well and had the right amount of fries, sauces, condiments, ETC. Food at this restaurant is pretty standard across the board so I'm not going to bore everyone with the same summary I always use. Environment: This location has a few more windows so it wasn't as dark and intimate as the Montgomery Mall location. Tons of stained glass and artwork everywhere making the room almost glow when daylight is present."
Valentina D.,"Fairfax, VA",245,340,72,4.0,12/31/2013,"I used to work in a building attached to the Cheesecake Factory, so I came here for a lot of work lunches and late night dinners.  Nowadays, I only go for group meals where someone is making the restaurant choice.  It's not because I'm sick of Cheesecake Factory or because the food is bad (it's not!), but because the food is literally drowning in butter.  True story - I met someone who worked in Cheesecake Factory's kitchen, and he said he put about a stick of butter in each dish.  I have 2 favorite dishes here - the Pasta da Vinci (1524 calories) and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp (1383 calories).  Feeling Italian tonight?  Get the Pasta da Vinci.  It's drowning in a delicious creamy mushroom sauce that reminds me of Maggiano's Rigatoni D.  Feeling like Asian tonight?  Get the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - white rice surrounded by a lake of a creamy coconut sauce with bits of chicken, shrimp, and veggies.  But the real test begins when you finish half of your meal - about 700 calories - because that's when you should be stopping and saving the rest for tomorrow's lunch. Now for dessert.  My favorite cheesecakes are the peppermint bark (900 calories) and pumpkin (740 calories) cheesecakes.  But share the dish or you won't be hungry tomorrow for breakfast...or lunch.  (Yes, it's happened to me!)"
Charry L.,"Arlington, VA",4,172,177,1.0,3/14/2015,Don't go here on Saturdays... the wait was horrible.  All of the diners on our side with the same waitress were angry. The manager finally had to come out and help her out. It's one thing when the service is slow but what really ruins your experience is when the waiter/waitress is on a bad moon. Our waitress was on a baaaaaad mood and was so slow!!! She was totally out of it.   The food thankfully came out hot and delicious but bad service totally ruined it.
Gaelle M.,"Fort Washington, MD",1,6,1,1.0,9/22/2015,This location doesn't even deserve any stars... the management there is discriminatory and rude...they've really ruined my perception of what cheesecake Factory is and after getting sick from eating there I won't be going back...be ware!
Lauren L.,"Purcellville, VA",165,27,9,1.0,10/12/2015,"I have been here several times - the waiters are SUPER slow, the food is usually dry, and it takes forever to get the check. Usually I love Cheesecake Factory, but the service here is not great at all."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  We like eating here when staying at the Ritz that adjoins Tyson's Galleria. It's especially nice that it is open late! The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Mischita H.,"Orlando, FL",173,612,1346,3.0,8/11/2013,"After not being able to really decide on a place for dinner yesterday, we settled on this place. I often forget that there are so many choices on the menu...really not that good having too many choices for me when I don't know what I want. At any rate, we chose to sit at the bar rather than wait in line for a table.  Our service was pretty good.  In an effort to try something new, I tried the chicken samosas (appetizer) and grilled fish tacos which came with a side of rice and cheesy black beans. The samosas were very good.  My only complaint with the food is that I didn't like the softness of the soft corn tortillas - when I picked up the taco, it fell apart from the bottom. So not cool having to eat your tacos with a fork. Although, I strongly prefer crunchy corn tortillas, overall the taste was good and I would try them again (or other tacos)  ONLY IF I can get crunchy tortillas. My only complaint with the venu is that I thought the temperature was way too cool. By the time my food arrived, I was so cold that I just wanted to pack it up and go home. And, of course, I couldn't depart with out ordering a slice of the delish red velvet cheesecake to go!"
Patty S.,"Washington, DC",0,5,,1.0,8/16/2016,"Brought my children along with their cousins here for lunch after a movie.  All was good, the server was nice and attentive and the food seemed fine until something that looked like a chicken bone showed up in my nephew's spaghetti and meatballs.  He pulled it out of his mouth and was baffled.  He brought it to my attention and in turn I showed the server who took it to the manager.  The manager apologized but couldn't tell us what it was or how it got into a kid's meal.  The manager took the meal off the check but I have to say I am still disgusted and outraged that something like this can happen to a meal that a child is eating.  This tells me quality control does not exist here and I will not return."
Joy B.,"Rockville, MD",170,338,3373,4.0,7/6/2014,"I love cheesecake. It is soft,sweet,creamy and delicious. There is an endless variety to chose from. So,how is it you say that I left without ordering dessert?  Maybe, it was the three pieces of warm,brown,sweet bread that they deliver piping hot to your table?  Or could it be the yummy ahi tuna salad with creamy avocado, ripe,farm fresh tomatoes and tangy dressing?  The tuna was cooked rare as I had ordered. The tuna had been edged in a border of spice that added to the flavor. My friend ordered the salmon with barbecue sauce and rice. It must be good, because there was not a drop left on his plate. It looked fresh and pink. Kudos to our waitress who was quick to fill up our ice tea glasses. She also navigated my friend's order, who is uber picky. He requested no onions, no parsley,and a double order of rice. She got it all done quickly and correctly. The servers were pleasant and good. The food was fabulous. So, yes, I will be back and I will leave room for dessert!"
Stuart W.,"Damascus, MD",2,86,,3.0,10/26/2014,"We love the food at cheesecake factory and so decided to try this one while we were in the area. First of all we noted that it was one of the darkest restaurants we'd ever been in. Our server on this occasion was very slow and hilariously kept saying ""enjoy your time"" when walking away. We could have finished our meal probably 10-15 minutes sooner if he hadn't of kept disappearing. I had a vanilla milkshake to drink and I have to say it was near perfection. I think the best milkshake I've ever had. I had the buffalo burger which was delicious, I just wish there were a few more fries to accompany it. My wife, as always, had the marsala, which is enough for 2 meals and I'm told was delicious. We shared a piece of the s'mores cheesecake for dessert and could only manage half of it each before giving up! As always, the cheesecake was excellent. I can never fault the food, but on this occasion because of the service and how dark the restaurant is I cannot rate the location above 3/5."
Cletus V.,"Sparks, NV",14,293,2,4.0,3/18/2016,Pretty nice Happy Hour! Very good signature cocktails - their alcohol-lemonade drink was very good! Margarita was very strong but good. The nachos were such a large portion - very tasty!
Krystle M.,"Germantown, MD",0,22,,4.0,2/27/2016,Always great food for a great price! Steak Dianne is my favorite meal here. Service is good and parking is convenient. Nice environment. Wait time is always long but we went recently at 10 pm and actually no wait time at all if you would like a really late dinner.
Simply C.,"Fairfax, VA",0,46,74,4.0,4/11/2015,Love Cheese Cake Factory...my favorite is the Kale Salad and the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp or Cobb Salad.   My #1 Cheese cake is the mango key lime or key lime.  The problem is when I feel I have to lose weight...I can't eat there for sure I leave the place with at least 1000 calories. If you are not on a diet...go ahead and be merry!
Paul D.,"Sterling, VA",105,259,148,4.0,1/1/2016,At the Cheesecake Factory the decor is great updated fresh they always have a large menu you get large portions we enjoyed the chicken and biscuits usually always consistently good we also like the House fresh passion iced tea
Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",385,337,279,4.0,9/28/2012,"I'm updating my review to add an extra star for fantastic customer service.  The last two times I've visited the Cheesecake Factory, I have been greeted, seated, and served promptly, politely, and with a cheerful energy that says ""I know my menu and really want to be here serving you right now"".  I have found this a rarity in quick-turn mall-located restaurants, especially in this area.      This is a chain restaurant, plain and simple. Although the decor is quite generic, the roof high to carry the din of 50 other conversations and kitchen noises, and you always must brave crowds and pay ""mall prices"" for the cuisine, Cheesecake Factory-- especially THIS one-- has become one of my favorite chain restaurants not only for a quick nosh for myself after a hair appointment or between a Stuart Weitzman and Karen MIllen marathon, but also to take groups of people.      I don't know if I have just been lucky, but the past few times I've visited this location I have recieved above par customer service-- suggestions to complement the wine or food, news about the rookie barrista's talent making great lattes, the server's anticipation of needs before they become salient to the customer... all kinds of unexpected but appreciated little touches. I felt compelled to compliment the server's energy and competence to the manager on my last visit, as she exceeded my expectations and made a ""catching up with friends"" lunch seamless and even more enjoyable. I have been in and out in 40 minutes, or stayed and chattted with friends for 2 or more hours with no pressure to leave.    I usually stick to my favorite, fresh 'Go To' items on the menu, which are the ahi carpaccio and the thai chicken lettuce wraps. Many items are seasonal, but these two have fresh natural ingredients which cannot be frozen or made too far in advance. A widely-ranged menu is great for a diverse group of people, but you can't do everything perfectly executed in 20 minutes without sacrificing freshness.  For this reason, I recommend salads, pastas with fresh veggies, or other of the same ilk... read the ingredients to see what appeals to you and contains items that can't be frozen or preserved for days if this matters to you. My favorite cheesecake is the red velvet cake layered with cheesecake and topped with a creamy frosting and shaved bits of white chocolate-- although it is so rich I can only take a couple bites, and even then I have to have coffee to accompany the sweet rich concoction-- or a great cappuccino or latte made by that great new barista. :-)"
Melanie A.,"North Arlington, NJ",21,13,27,4.0,2/21/2016,"We had a bit of a wait for our food, but everything was great.    Our waitress was very nice and attentive.  Food was good.  I had the mushroom burger, perfectly cooked medium well.  This Cheesecake Factory was one of the better ones I've eaten in."
Kathy L.,"Arlington County, VA",0,4,,1.0,8/21/2016,"Service and management, including Steve the manageer on duty were very unresponsive.  Waited for almost an hour before the food came out.  No one cared to look into the problem and get back to us.  The place was not even that busy."
Erin N.,"Arlington, VA",76,5,4,2.0,2/27/2016,The appetizers were pretty good but when it came to the main course I was very disappointed. I had to send back my steak 2 times and it still was not cooked right. The food also took a really long time to arrive.
Christine O.,"Alexandria, VA",347,114,786,2.0,9/22/2012,"Typical chain restaurant... most of their food is frozen and just reheated in the back. How else would they be able to make a ton full of dishes in a matter of minutes? And I'm talking about a ton of dishes -- the menu has a bunch of variety. Used to go here all the time until my order of hibachi steak and mashed potatoes came out on a hot plate and the touch of the potatoes on the dish was hot, but was frozen/cold when bitten!! That's when you know -- FROZEN FOOD. The only thing very good here is the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and possibly their bread if it arrives warm and soft. Other than that, get food elsewhere!"
Victoria C.,"Devon, PA",1,9,,4.0,11/30/2014,"I was here 2-3 weeks ago for a business lunch and had a very pleasant time.  The sitting area in the restaurant were quiet spacious and allowed a lot of personal and private space around each table. This is especially good if you want to discuss personal things and would prefer that the entire restaurant didn't know that you want a lot of pastries.  Our server was also very pleasant and took our orders, brought our drinks, and our dishes in a quick and efficient manner.  Experience was good and pleasant, but not extraordinary (hence, 4 stars and not 5). Will return again."
