Megan C.,"Herndon, VA",532,659,554,3.0,4/16/2014,"As many of my fellow Yelpers have pointed out, we're typically not wild about mega-conglomerate chain restaurants, although one could also argue that a chain like The Cheesecake Factory, especially this particular outpost inside swanky Tyson's Galleria, does have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" when it comes to how it wears its big chain badge. Still, I feel 'A-OK' about The Cheesecake Factory and it's 800-page menu, its vague/non-existent disclosure of ingredients/nutritional info, etc., but again, I think it's important that a mega-chain review focus on the specific location as opposed to the chain itself. For that reason, I felt the service was adequate at this location. Food was delivered promptly and efficiently. Food was delivered mostly as ordered; salad had to be sent back due to inclusion of some things I had asked to do without. Friend's cheesecake to-go box was a strange debacle, as she wanted to box it herself, but server tried to insist he take it away to box it. The atmosphere can be loud and waits can be long, typical of most Cheesecake Factory outposts. Access from outside or inside Tyson's Galleria is convenient; it's on the 3rd floor of the mall or from the upper street level of the parking lot.  Great place to meet people if you're looking for a quick generic-enough-to-please-all-palates choice and Tyson's is your meeting spot."
Va Beach M.,"Naples, FL",3,166,,3.0,11/24/2014,"It's ok. That's it. It's just ok. Yes, the cheesecake is delicious, out of this world, excellent.  There was supposed to be chicken in my Chinese chicken salad. There was supposed to be almonds in my salad. There was supposed to be orange. It was chopped lettuce and rice noodles. Well, at least not fattening."
Alexander B.,"Pacific Grove, CA",0,20,13,1.0,7/3/2016,"So, in general Cheesecake Factory has gone down hill a lot over time. The food went from real good to solidly mediocre. The service at this location is usually good, however it is clear that this is getting worse. They are polite, so I really don't blame the wait staff. But overall, operations are slow, unchecked, and sloppy.  We have not gone to this location for awhile, but decided to give it a go. Appetizer, entree, and two slices of cheesecake at $50+ with tax and tip (no drinks, or extras). It's not inexpensive.  Avocado egg rolls came out soggy and just a sprinkle of the rice straws. Presentation looked sad.  Bang Bang chicken and shrimp would be better called 'rice mountain' with 4 pieces of shrimp and sporadic chicken pieces smothered in the sauce. Also, poorly presented.  They are always busy here so I don't imagine they are paying a lot of attention to the reviews, but in case they start to loose activity and decide to consider some opportunities for feedback, maybe they will come across this and others on Yelp and seriously consider re-upping their game. I would choose a fast food burger at Shake Shack or just about any other restaurant in Tyson's over this next time we want to head out.  Got me this time, but lost money from me in the future. I'll monitor reviews and look for signs of life before trying again."
Ali T.,"San Jose, CA",4,32,9,1.0,8/30/2015,Worse place for large groups. Had reservation for 20 people and they refused to sit us until everyone was here. Held up over 10 of us with small kids and eventually told us we have to wait longer when everyone showed up
Tonya B.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,20,39,4.0,12/18/2015,I actually really loved this one food was better than the one in bethesda even the drinks were good
James J.,"McLean, VA",83,41,1,2.0,11/6/2015,"Service was really slow even though we came at 830. The steak medallions that we ordered were dry and underseasoned. However, the tuna carpaccio was amazing and so were the mushrooms. So the appetizers were much better than the entrees."
Scott T.,"Pflugerville, TX",69,205,4,1.0,7/26/2015,"Over cooked steak, our waiter took 15 minutes to do anything. Really disappointing for 100 bucks"
Jarvis W.,"Waldorf, MD",0,1,,1.0,8/1/2015,Epic failure!!! The worse CHEESECAKE factory!!  Horrible waiter to match the flavorless food.
D G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,19,1,2.0,11/28/2016,"I went to this location yesterday to celebrate my friend's birthday.  As I was treating, I wanted it to be a fabulous experience.  That was not the case......started off with dirty silverware at the table.  We reached over and took some from the table beside us, told the server and she never took the dirty silverware off our table nor did she replace the other table.  We then receive water with cups that had dirty food particles in them followed by new cups that were full of crack which grow bacteria or could cut someone's lip by the way.  Bread came to us hard as a rock and if I didn't know better, I'd say it was yesterday's bread.  We asked for new bread and eventually were told it would be 8 minutes....shortly after our entrees came and 30 minutes later we were told the bread was still baking. My coffee cup had food particles in it also.  Overall, it was not a good experience nor one that I want to have when I am treating someone else to dinner. I remember when CF used to have 2 hour waits, but now I can see why they seem virtually empty.  My favorite part was when we spoke to the manger and he said he would give us a free slice of cheesecake instead of taking a few other things off the bill. Followed by.....us receiving the bill with his comments about what we had complained about to him....dirty cups, dirty silverware and hard bread.  This is probably not something we should have seen. Needless to say, our days of frequenting this CF are over."
Gaz W.,"Hampstead, NH",1,16,10,4.0,1/16/2016,always had great meals and service here. I've never gone during busy times so I can't speak to that. Amazing cheesecake.
Izzy H.,"Washington D.C., DC",67,103,47,2.0,6/30/2015,"I just had a shrimp and angel hair pasta skinnylicious entree from this site. While the pasta was well cooked and seasoned, the shrimp was excessively sandy. I have rinsed my mouth and if I continue to chew I still have sand in my mouth. That's gross."
Tim R.,"Tysons Corner, Mclean, VA",1,48,,3.0,7/11/2014,"If you like fat and gristle, I recommend the Pit Beef Dip... BLEH!!!! By far, the WORST sandwich I've ever had at a restaurant. My stomach hurts despite spitting over half of it out. My salad and red blend was fine, but the main course killed it for me.  Also, when the hell did TCF become like a TGIF atmosphere? The staff was so loud, felt like I was back in my high school cafeteria.  Would have been 1 star had I not had better experiences in previous visits."
Tim M.,"Vienna, VA",0,8,,1.0,12/28/2015,"Went there earlier tonight for our daughter's 21st bday with cousins, aunts and uncles. Food for all 10 of us was good, but... 1. We ordered 6 drinks -- our two beers came right away; four other drinks (ordered when we sat down) came halfway through the meal. Why even order a drink if it comes that late? 2. My food -- Baja chicken tacos came mid-way through everyone else's meal.  Someone (not our waitress) came twice, apologized and said they would make it up to us yet when the bill came it was for full price (oh, they did ""throw in"" a bday ice cream sundae). I paid the full bill and tip, but as we were leaving asked to talk to the manager. Really disappointed with his response. A simply I'm sorry. When I expressed my concern even more, he still didn't do a thing. Really? I don't need the money, but it would have been nice for someone to recognize that they'd really screwed up. Guess that's not in their playbook! I'm just one person but definitely will NOT go back to Cheesecake Factory again. There are two many options available at Tyson's to waste my money and be treated so poorly. Shame on me for not looking at the recent reviews. A lot of 1 and 2 star reviews in December. Clearly, this was not a one-time event with us. Looks like a lot of others have had similar experiences with delays and management who doesn't seem to care about their customers!"
Melissa B.,"McLean, VA",389,62,77,4.0,3/3/2015,"Anytime I am craving a burger, this is my go to spot since cheesecake is one of the few places who have gluten-free hamburger buns. The service at this location is good, and even on peak nights I have never waited more than 10 to 15 minutes for a table. While the food is not super special, I find cheesecake is a great place to go when you have a large group of people, since they offers so many varieties of food. Parking here is a little bit of a pain because it is in a mall and by one of the main entrances- The parking lots in this area tend to be very full"
Tom C.,"Washington, DC",324,51,10,3.0,11/13/2012,"I enjoy having group lunches here, but I don't always enjoy the food. Most entrees are $10-20 with generous servings. So far I have not tried any standout dishes. If I had to recommend something, try the pumpkin pecan pie.. it's really good.  Bang bang chicken & shrimp is alright. Don't get the shepherd's pie (pile of mush), chicken piccata (too plain), or the New Orleans Shrimp (tastes like frozen gumbo) The service here is great. The waiters are friendly and speed of delivery is fairly quick (20 or so minutes for a large group)."
Gahee L.,"New York, NY",251,100,94,4.0,8/6/2014,"I learned during yesterday's lunch at this Cheesecake Factory that you don't have to walk out feeling 10lbs heavier.  At my friend's suggestions, we ordered the smallest portions of the following: Ahi tuna tartare salad, Shrimp and chicken gumbo with brown rice, and the Thai lettuce wrap.  The Ahi tuna salad was tiny, but delicious. Loved the soft avocados and tuna pieces that melted in my mouth. The soy sauce at the bottom was sweet but not too sweet. The shrimp and chicken gumbo with brown rice was quite good too! The chicken was a bit weird because the meat kind of looked like McDonalds chicken nuggets (meaning, not like chicken), but other than that, I loved the spices in this dish. A hint of spicy with a hint of sweetness. The Thai lettuce wrap, which came on a huge plate, was refreshing in comparison to the sauce-slathered gumbo. The lettuce was fresh, as were the mung bean sprouts. The three sauces (that you could add to your wrap to your choosing) perfected the dish. These three dishes were more than enough for my party of two. Know, as I did yesterday, that you don't absolutely have to get the calorie and cholesterol packed dishes here. There actually are healthier, but still tasty, options."
Cornelius B.,"Merrifield, Fairfax, VA",452,24,8,1.0,2/27/2015,"I went to this restaurant on 02/27/2015 for dinner for the first time with a friend the service was wonderful Our waiter was great he was the best thing out of the experience However I noticed a light-skinned African American man pick his nose while serving food I also had a roach crawl across my table while eating my food while getting ready to leave I decided to stop at the hostess table to complain and she was apologetic and told me she would "" tell"" her manager well, I was not satisfied with that answer so I immediately called the manager on duty I believe his name was Adam he was apologizing and told me that he had exterminators to come out three times a week to "" fix "" the problem I did complain to corporate and I also ask for a refund"
Lawrence C.,"Hagerstown, MD",2,20,,4.0,10/25/2015,"Love, Love, Love how big their menu is.  I understand to some it's too much.  However in my family of three were one person craves say american, the next Italian, the next Asian you can find it on this menu. The food is always good.  The staff friendly.  Place is clean.  Love coming here."
Julia J.,"Morrisville, PA",1,6,2,5.0,10/24/2015,"Such amazing food & drinks! The cheesecake is to die for!!! The lettuce wrapped appetizer and the fried avocado with special sauce is definitely something to try. If you love cheesecake, this is your place to go!"
Hu K.,"Zürich, Switzerland",338,1251,2819,4.0,5/10/2010,"Do you like brunch? Can you eat a lot? You need more than just one kind? Cheesecake factory is my new place for brunch-comfort-food. 1. Giant waffle for $6.95.  2. French toast: 6 slices of thick toast. Get this if you love french toast.  3. Lemon ricotta pancake: big stack of 3 pancake. Lemony light pancake but I had better ricotta pancake.. so I would just get regular pancake. ** For all above carbo-dishes, just ask chantilly cream. They go very well with cream. They don't charge:) 4. Chicken hash: again big portion and good flavor but not wow-special. I will return soon for more:)"
