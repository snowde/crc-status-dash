Payal P.,"Arlington, VA",10,120,42,2.0,4/5/2015,Not a fan of the food here. Lots of options that you don't even know what to order. Got the Spicy jambalaya pasta with chicken instead of shrimp and it was just way too oily. The only thing great about this place is their honey-oat bread (dipped in ranch) and the cheesecakes.

John N.,"Rockville, MD",166,170,22,2.0,6/18/2013,"Going to Cheesecake Factory and not getting Cheesecake is just sacrilegious.  It's like going to a strip club blindfolded only to find out that they only have one legged strippers with crack yellow teeth and overgrown pubic hair.  Then you WOULD want to be blindfolded and find the quickest way out of there possible.  That was the extent of our experience at this place. Between the slow service, absent minded server, incomplete order, and the indifferent attitude towards our complaints, led us to forgo our dessert and leave with our experience unsatisfied....much like leaving a strip club unsatisfied.  Come to think of it, you always leave a strip club unsatisfied. Anyways I digress.   This is not rocket science.  The ability to multi-task is a prerequisite for employment at any restaurant.  Not only was multi-tasking not a part of this servers repertoire, empathy for his mistakes were nowhere to be found.  Some food was overcooked, others were missing requested modifications, drinks were made with incorrect garnishes, and the 20 minutes it took for our server to check on us after we had completed our meal is unacceptable. On top of all of this, the complaint to management was additionally lack luster.  Yes, we received an apology, but the effort stopped there to ease our dissatisfaction.   Im going to chalk this up to being an isolated incident.  It's not like I'm never going to go back to cheesecake.  But just done expect much from this particular establishment in terms of stellar customer service.  You might actually get better customer experience from the one legged stripper with crack yellow teeth and overgrown pubic hair.......cause you know that she needs your money!!"
Pamela D.,"Washington, DC",12,8,,1.0,12/27/2015,"I go to restaurants like TCF because there ""should"" be no surprises.  Our ""home"" TCF is Annapolis and well, the difference between the McLean Store and Annapolis Store was drastic.  First, let me make it clear, the issue was with the food and not our server.  We started with their fried calamari appetizer and a skinny chopped salad.  The first order of calamari was so small that we ordered a second.  The second order was double the portion of first plate of calamari. And the lettuce that was served with the salad was extremely wilted and had brown spots. That should have been our first warning that there were issues with the kitchen.  We all ordered ""standards"" from the menu ... burger with mac n cheese ... Bang Bang Chicken Shrimp and the Cheese Steak sandwich.  Of the three entrees only the Bang Bang entree met TCF's standards.  The Cheese Steak was barely filed with meat which was overcooked and the cheese nonexistent.  The burger with mac n cheese arrived about 15 minutes later.  While the burger was cooked to order the mac n cheese topping was cold. When food is this poor, you go to the Manager.  That was the biggest surprise, she was not at all interested in our food experience.  TCF needs to do a serious review of their McLean store."
P M.,"London, United Kingdom",5,36,2,1.0,4/16/2014,"I've been to various locations of this chain restaurant all over the country and never have I had such a poor experience. Service is horrid, slow, unprofessional, and did I mention slow? Our waitress had 3 tables and still managed to not take our orders for the first 25 minutes, forgot our (cold) bread basket for another 15 minutes after that, and kept complaining to us about management. Like, seriously, we're here for dinner, not free therapy. After we told her THREE  times to make sure our food was warm, she disappeared for a long time and then brought out our cold pasta and frozen chicken and a soggy burger. No joke. When we called for the manager, he came by and argued with me that my food wasn't cold (he didn't even touch it) and said the chicken was perfectly cooked and he could bring out a thermometer to test  it. Have you ever?? When the food is cold, fix the bloody meal - don't argue with the customer whose waited 1.25 hours for an undercooked meal! We finally got fed up and told him to take the food away, which he did and never returned! We went to walk out and he stopped to ""explain"" how the food  was fine - again - and instead I asked for his name (Amos Machadu) to complain to the corporate offices, and he looked like he could care less. The guest relations rep at the corporate office was nice enough and offered a gift certificate, but they can't make up for a ruined family outing due to lousy management and disgusting food. If you value your health and don't want to get some food-borne bacteria, do not eat here! I see others have had similar experience at this restaurant and it's still going on. Good on the General Manager, right? Not!"
Koreanita X.,"Fairfax, VA",2,82,3,5.0,5/14/2014,"Love their cheesecake and salad portions!! It's the same as any other CF. This is my go-to place if I crave a big salad, rewarded by a generous slice of cheesecake. Also service at this location was great, hence 5 stars as far as CFs go."
Clarence J.,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",60,1219,82,3.0,2/1/2014,"Sooooooo much food...but somehow all of it (that I've tried, anyway) very good!  Yes, it's a chain, and one that covers a massively wide assortment of food, but the taste and atmosphere entertain me and I keep returning for more than just the amazing cheesecake.  There are plenty of restaurants that do some of the individual menu items/styles better, but I thoroughly enjoy The Cheesecake Factory as a place where I can go for just about anything and get consistent quality and a decent amount (in a severe understatement) of food for what I pay, and where the service has always been good.  I usually wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory for a nice quiet meal (unless you can get outside seating or go in the narrow window between lunch and dinner), but the Tysons Corner restaurant is relatively calm and quiet most of the time.  And as with all of them, the dark wood, black leather cushions, and deep red, orange, and brass (?) decoration -- as well as the myriad booths -- keeps the feeling warm and intimate despite the size of the restaurant. The caveat to all this is my wish that they would stop getting rid of the cheesecakes I like best. So far the cappucino white chocolate and the white chocolate caramel latte cheesecakes have both gone the way of the dodo, and it's a complete travesty.  Sigh...  It's too bad they've got another 20 or so types or I'd really be annoyed."
cherry h.,"Washington, DC",136,69,21,1.0,2/20/2015,"Worst service!!  Left upset and Ajay Bhatia the manager, didn't even try to talk to me or even apologize for the inconvenience."
Hien P.,"Herndon, VA",235,47,3,5.0,7/11/2013,"My friends and I decided to stop by to grab  dinner and drinks. Our server was very attentive and the food took no more than 15 minutes to come to the table.  Pros: a wide range of menu items for everyone's liking, ambiance is terrific, service was on point, and a very clean facility. Cons: the amount of food we got could feed three humans!!! We ordered way too much!  I would recommend to visit if you are in the area! The building also twinkles at night :)"
Elham A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,4,4.0,5/27/2014,Big portion and good quality. I had meatloaf which was one of the best meatloaf I've ever had.
MJ L.,"Springfield, VA",0,17,,2.0,1/1/2016,"Slow service (30 min to get bread), can barely see food. Had to use flashlight on phone to read menu. Dishes weren't clean. Waiter didn't know what unsweet tea was and tried to say the salad I ordered comes dry. Need better wait staff who know the menu"
K. R.,"Reston, VA",1,25,1,3.0,3/18/2014,"I used to come for the 20-something page menu, and of course the cheesecake. Now, I come because it's someone's birthday or because I want a 1200 calorie piece of cheesecake (which is maybe once a year).  I can't say that I'm as fond of the menu or the service as I used to be. The menu is borderline gluttonous with a number of entrees as calorific as stuff you'd see on The Biggest Loser.  Since when do you need a 2500+ calorie meal, come on.  The menu is endless, they want to have something for everyone. The only upside to that is that they have variety of gluten free and vegetarian options.  The downside is that they don't have a stand out dish or style that makes you want to come back.  Most recently I went with a group of people and the service was slow, the waiter was forgetful throughout the meal and the food came out up to 20 mins apart. My caesar salad came out 15 mins after burgers and pizza!  The only saving grace is the waiter was at least very knowledgable about the menu and answered all questions well."
Amy J.,"West Babylon, NY",40,5,,2.0,4/2/2016,"I'm visiting the area for the weekend and I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory before. This one is located inside the Tysons Galleria which is a very upscale shopping mall attached to the Ritz Carlton. I was very optimistic based on the location and appearance at first glance. I stopped in with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated right away. As soon as he sat down in the booth, his hand landed in what appeared to be melted cheesecake that was on the seat. Our silverware was set on the bare table and one of the spoons had what looked like caramel on it and there was also some in the middle of the table. They obviously didn't clean it after the previous guests and also didn't bother removing the dirty silverware and apparently expected us to eat with it and not notice. I was very turned off and considered leaving right then. Instead, when our server came over to greet us we asked for clean utensils and to have the table wiped. He was very apologetic and took care of it. We ordered a mojito and an old fashioned, the roadhouse sliders and meatballs with ricotta and garlic bread. Our server, Andrew, asked if we would like bread for the table and I said yes. Things were looking up. Andrew brought us some water while we were waiting for our cocktails (which was very thoughtful because the drinks were taking forever) and some bread and butter. The drinks took a good 10 minutes to arrive but when they did they looked fantastic and they were delicious and worth the wait. We took a few bites of the bread when we noticed a long dark hair in it. At this point I was done. When Andrew passed by again, we showed him the hair and I told him we wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. And that is what we did. I work in a restaurant myself so I understand that things happen sometimes. But this place didn't even try. Andrew and the drinks get a thumbs up but everything else blew."
David L.,"Waco, TX",223,869,119,3.0,5/22/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory is a at once one-of-a-kind and ubiquitous. There is no place like it, and yet, there are over 150 places like it. It is almost inseparable from the American mall experience, and it is in this sense a standard-bearer for the American mono-culture.  It is at once quotidian and surprisingly absurd. Their menu, for instance, boasts over 26 pages and upwards of 200 items. Among these pages, which are interspersed with product advertisements, you will find dishes from all over the world. In just a couple of pages you're liable to find English fish and chips, Cajun Jambalaya, Mexican tacos, Italian chicken Parmesan, an Asian orange chicken, your mother's meatloaf, and everything in between. They especially like fusion items like Tex-Mex egg rolls or Vietnamese tacos that run roughshod over traditional cuisine. The 'factory' is the American melting pot in microcosm, fusing, dissolving, and bastardizing custom, tradition, and culture. Admittedly, everything comes out tasting just fine, but I still feel a little soulless eating my multinational meal.   They have also incorporated the American maxim that bigger is better. Their utter disregard for portion control is at once admirable and laughable. I admire their freedom from the sometimes obsessive American concern for health, but I disapprove of their swinging the pendulum over to the equally American penchant for gluttony. These dishes can easily feed three people. If I wanted to eat it at home, I would have ordered takeout. And why would I want to eat this food at home, away from their fittingly opulent but totally unplaceable aesthetic? Their golden fabrics, dark woods, and modern lighting are characteristic of anywhere and nowhere. Beneath this patina of luxury, you sense the newness and kitsch that comprises their corporate aesthetic. You are surrounded by abundance, and yet it's not really excellence. The surfeit of food, drink, and cheesecake fills me to overflowing, but still leaves me feeling somewhat empty inside."
Dominique F.,"Dusseldorf, Germany",269,972,138,3.0,5/18/2011,"Another chain in a mall. Came with my friend and her family on mother's day, and we had to wait for an hour to be seated. Thank God, it was a beautiful day, and they had space to seat us in the patio.  Service was a bit on the slower side as you'd prolly imagine, but they switched servers on us midway through the lunch, and I have to admit the second one was much better. As usual there are plenty of choices and you're bound to find food that you enjoy. Thank God for the lunch portions; I can never understand how people can finish the dinner portion in one seating. PS: I was wearing heals that day, and I seriously thought I was going to die walking from the front door to the bathroom. The floor was soo soo soo slippery and I felt like I was skating my way through the restaurant :D  i was so scared of falling down and showing everyone my panties that I decided to use the restroom in the mall to wash my hands after the meal :D"
Brandy B.,"Hershey, PA",6,110,,5.0,12/11/2013,"Standard cheesecake factory.  A little smaller than the ones that I am used to frequenting, but nothing to complain about.  I love their chocolate tuxedo cheesecake.  It's the BEST!!  Peppermint bark is VERY good too...."
Macky N.,"Washington, DC",1,35,5,2.0,2/1/2016,"Let me start off by saying that this review is mostly about the service. I came to dine with my girlfriend and her sister.  Okay, so we'll start with the good. The cheesecake was great. Especially the banana, which actually tasted awesome. The food was pretty good. I got the garlic pasta, which was good. My girlfriend got the jambalaya, which tasted nothing like jambalaya, and although it says spicy, we ended up putting in a ton of Sriracha when we got home.  Then came our waiter.  Ricky R, from what it says on our receipt.  We had no bread to start. He came by when we weren't ready, I began to request which appetiser to start us off, he interrupted me to interject and ask what my girlfriend's sister wanted first. Okay, I'm all for ladys first, but I was trying to get us started with an appetiser because they still couldn't decide what they wanted. We ordered drinks, and I had finished mine before the appetiser came out, but it wasn't taken away until after the dinner. Asked for bread which came out after the appetiser. He proceeds to spend the rest of the meal not speaking to me at all, but to my girlfriend, until he brings out the check. At which time, I open it to see that he put a line next to the 20%, and a ""THANKS"" right beside it? I'm sorry, but where was the service that you provided me that was so great that you felt entitled enough to presume you were getting a 20% tip? I'm going to follow this up with the fact that my girlfriend works in the service industry as well, so whenever we go out, we tip at least 20%. More of the person was great, and genuine, but the least we will tip is 15% of the person was just awful and didn't care at all.  I know it seems like I'm getting worked up over nothing, and I've had a lot of bad service before due to the fact that I seem a bit younger, but the part that really bothers me is that he had the audacity to insinuate that I was required to give him a higher percentage tip when we started off the meal with him interrupting me, which he never even acknowledged. Then, he clearly didn't pay attention to our table since we had no bread to start, it took the whole bloody meal for my empty drink to be taken away, and when we asked for the dessert menu, he came back with two which he presented to my girlfriend and her sister. I ended up tipping over 20% because the food was not when it came out, and if I weren't in the equation, my girlfriend and her sister got pretty good service. Ricky R, if you are ever my waiter again and you pull the same stunt with the tip, you will get nothing out of pure principle."
Uncle L.,"McLean, VA",0,27,,2.0,2/22/2015,"Terrible service all the way around.   The hostesses at the front couldn't make eye contact or smile and treated us like herd animals.  Finally got seated, there was a problem with one order (chicken and pasta came out with no chicken).  We sent it back. At this point the service was ""acceptably bad"" but then deteriorated into ""horrible"". The manager came by.  We explained the order had been sent back.  It had been about 10 minutes (my 11 year old son sitting next to me starving and waiting).  He said he just saw it enter the kitchen and it would be at least 10 more minutes before we got more food (ended up being closer to 15, total 25 minutes).  Not sure why it took our waiter 10 minutes to carry a plate back to the kitchen.  We complained that this was too long and he got defensive saying that he never sends out food that is not freshly cooked etc.  Never made eye contact, never apologized.  He left and we felt worse than before he showed up. He did comp us for that dish. The kids started to melt down, so we finally took the rest of the food to go.  We ordered a piece of ""plain classic"" cheesecake to take with us. After 10 more minutes the waiter came by to tell us that they were out of this.  Think of that, the Cheesecake Factory, out of cheesecake.  But, he said, we could order the cheesecake with strawberry sauce, with the sauce on the side, and that was the same cheesecake as the plain cheesecake.  Good thing he made us wait 10 minutes to tell us that.  We ordered, and finally 10-15 minutes later (total time about 2.5 hours) we got out of there. No eye contact, no apology, no human emotion whatsoever. The food, overall, is pretty good, and so are the drinks, so I give them 2 stars.  But probably the worst service you're going to get anywhere in the DC area."
Mattie C.,"Arlington, VA",95,895,91,3.0,12/8/2013,"Most people have been to a Cheesecake factory, so there isn't much to say that isn't already known, such as, that the cheesecakes here are great!  As for the Tysons II Mall, my family used to go here a lot because I was an extremely picky eater growing up.  If you are at the mall with kids and everyone wants something different, well, this is your only option.  I enjoy their salmon dish, shrimp scampi, they have decent fajitas, and if you see a good-sounding salad on their menu but are hungry, don't be afraid to get it.  The salads are HUGE.  I've actually had to take a portion of salad home before because they are so big, that never happens.   I think Cheesecake Factory is overpriced for what it is.  But guess what, this is the Tysons II Mall and EVERYTHING is overpriced.  I would go here over Maggianos, Legal Seafoods, or Lebanese Taverna.  Daily Grill is unfortunately closed.  And if you are here for lunch, I would choose this over the food court here.  Usually if everyone in the family has diverse tastes, you go to the food court.  Do NOT do that here, the food court is outrageously overpriced and Cheesecake Factory is a better deal in terms of volume/taste of the food for the money.  If you are here and don't care about cost and are with a group without picky children eaters in it, I would go to Wildfire - that is the best restaurant in the mall. If you choose Cheesecake Factory, also prepare to wait if it is on a Friday or Saturday night.  Sometimes even Thursday.  It is a popular place."
Courtney S.,"Vienna, VA",123,30,11,4.0,8/24/2013,"I love the Cheesecake Factory. They have a HUGE menu including a ""skinnylicious"" section for those watching their calories. I always order from that menu and everything is really good especially the shrimp tacos. Service is on point and the place is run like a well oiled machine. Last time I was there my friends steak Diane took longer than usual and a manager came to our table without prompting and told us dessert was on the house. Score!  Cons: I have no willpower over their cheesecake. Also pricey for a chain restaurant in the mall (IMO). And, it's in a mall. So parking is annoying."
