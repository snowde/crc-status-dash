Mark B.,"South Burlington, VT",117,112,1,3.0,10/28/2013,"In terms of chain restaurants, this is one of the better ones. The food is pretty consistent across locations, and is certainly better than Olive Garden and other choices. For the quantity of what they offer in choices, they make whatever you order off the menu, so clearly it's not mass produced in the midwest and flown in frozen packages to the restaurant.  I tend to favor Evelyn's Favorite pasta, and it turns out well. Sometimes I'll opt for something different, but each time the food was good. The breads are fresh as well, and the service in the Tyson's Galleria location is very good. Went recently and didn't have to wait for a table, and the service was just the right amount of attentive. The cheesecake is the signature item of course, and there are plenty to choose from. While not the absolute best I've ever eaten, it ranks high and I would recommend it."
Mona M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,10,,1.0,7/1/2013,"I love CCF, but I'm sorry, this branch is completely horrific. I have been there at least 3 times and this branch's food tastes like oily expired Ruby Tuesday food. From the bread and butter to the entre. I ordered sliders, which first, did not look appealing at ALL, and then ordered the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta which also wasn't flattering. Looked microwaved. The french bread was old. the appetizer was alright. It was a friend sushi dish (forgot the name). My experience was really bad. Another time I went there, I had ordered the chicken belalggio and WHAT a nightmare. And to top it off...there were mosquitoes that would NOT go away from around our food. Come onnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. DONT eat at this branch."
Kristi J.,"Herndon, VA",47,48,35,5.0,12/11/2011,"Cheesecake Factory has been around for a while. I was surprised that there wasn't more than 1 review, but I will chalk it up to the fact that they've been around for so long, certainly most people know what they're getting into when they decide to go. For those of you that are reading this and aren't familiar with the restaurant, they have an extensive menu, and all the portions are huge. Most of the menu items are also pretty bad for you, but that's mostly due to the size. It's definitely a good place to come and split a meal. They have recently added a ""skinny"" menu, where everything featured on the menu is less than 590 calories. I like restaurants that do this, at least you know what you're getting yourself into. That being said, I've never had a bad meal here. I would say that all the dishes are above average (and above average size, but leftovers are good).  Although, you don't really come to the Cheesecake Factory because you want a healthy meal, you come for the Cheesecake, which NEVER disappoints. I particularly like their featured Cheesecakes. Every few months they come out with a new featured cheesecake. Some of the more notable ones in my opinion were the Pistachio Chocolate Chip and the Red Velvet Cheesecake. If neither of those sound good to you, I recommend the Dutch Apple Caramel Strussel or the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, which are a bit lighter. If neither of those tempt your pallet, don't worry, they have 37 different flavors to chose from, so I'm sure you can find something. I was VERY impressed with their latest feature this year which was the Peppermint Bark Cheesecake. Pretty fantastic, but I'm a sucker for peppermint bark.  You can also buy their Cheesecake by the slice or the whole cake to go. They're great for parties and get-togethers."
Anne C.,"Tysons, VA",475,658,11,3.0,12/18/2012,"I typically am not a fan of cheesecake factory at all, but one aspect I do enjoy of cheesecake is their happy hour from 4-6. Great deals, decent food and as usual, awesome portions. Get their texmex egg rolls, fried chicken sliders and tuna tartare. Service today was fabulous. Drinks (the cosmo and mojitos) are typically strong there, but today was extremely weak and tasted like sugary juice. Our waiter was very helpful and worked to get that fixed. Overall, a decent happy hour spot if you are in the area and want to stick it out awhile in mclean to avoid traffic!"
Faith C.,"San Diego, CA",58,251,49,4.0,7/3/2014,"I tried the Spaghettini, Fresh Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Oven-Roasted Tomatoes and Parmesan in a delicious Garlic Sauce, with Chicken (no on the mushrooms for me) the other day using a gift card.  I was surprised at the large size and ate every bit of it.  Good choices on the wines and sitting at the bar was comfy. Brad (I think his name) was working as the bartender and he was professional and well-versed on the menu.  I'll try another dish soon."
Snailman J.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,17,4,1.0,1/2/2015,"Worst service.. Lost hostess and confused server. Manager MIA and unresponsive with a do not care attitude. Nachos were pathetic, oily, unseasoned!! Missed my daughter's Mac and cheese for the longest period of time. I don't think I'm coming back to this location."
Dennis W.,"Ashburn, VA",5,4,,1.0,1/18/2015,"Myself and two others attempted to eat here today but service was very slow. We waited 45 minutes for salads and some of the produce in them looked like they had been sitting out quite a while. I heard another server in frustration say"" I hate this crap"". Didn't see a Manager after letting our server know of issues. I don't think that we will eat at that location again."
Robert R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",65,606,38,2.0,7/11/2011,"Used to like this place.  The food was ok at best.  service was solid and we were seated right away, which is unusual but it was a monday. I got the chicken and biscuits and it wasnt even remotely what i expected.  It was more like chicken and crackers.  the biscuits seemed to be more like hardtack in the military than what anyone would reasonably consider a biscuit. Service gets 4 stars.  Server was very responsive and helpful.  Something has gone awry with the food, but I can't quite my finger on it.  Its not bad per se, but its also not memorable.   There are several other restaurants in the Galleria that will get my business.  Just not worth the effort for the hype."
Purpose T.,"Hillside, NJ",1159,301,100,5.0,10/24/2014,"Wonderful location conveniently located in walking distance/direct across the street from the beautiful hotel I was staying in. Although it seemed packed to capacity (as always), there was no wait for the 4 of us for a nice Saturday evening dinner. The service was good. Our waitress was attentive. The bread was fresh and abundant. Everything was good!!"
John Iver S.,"Fairfax, VA",9,33,96,4.0,11/8/2014,"I know that Cheesecake Factory generates polarizing reviews. Their menu selection is very extensive that your decision-making abilities are thoroughly challenged. The good thing is, if you know what you want, you don't have to worry about what to order. But if you come extremely famished, it is an absolute nightmare just looking at all the possible choices. Nevertheless, most of their food selections are very palatable. I also love to always look up and appreciate the art-laden ceilings - they definitely boost my appetite further."
Lulu T.,"Falls Church, VA",39,198,341,3.0,12/28/2010,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory chain restaurant.  The menu and portion sizes are HUGE.  I'm glad they now offer half portion sizes for lunch. The salads are huge and tasty.  Beware of the salad dressing that will add tons of fat to your ""want to be healthy"" salad.  Ask them to put the dressing on the side otherwise it comes drenched in dressing. The Jamaican black pepper shrimp is delicious.  It comes with plantains and rice. Jambalaya Chicken and Shrimp is also another favorite. Brunch here is dangerous!  Everything is good and oh so bad for you.  Especially the Monte Cristo, deep fried deliciousness. The Reese Cup cheesecake is the new favorite.  It's chocolatey and peanut buttery goodness. For some strange reason, this location has very slippery and greasy floors.  Wear shoes with rubber soles or be prepared to wipe out!  I've seen plenty of people entering and exiting the restaurant slipping."
Brian W.,"Charlottesville, VA",2,78,1,4.0,7/18/2016,"My wife and I stopped here on a trip down from NJ to central VA because there aren't any Cheesecake Factory's...Factories...? around where we live in VA, but we really love this place, or at least The Cheescake Factory in general. We had a long road trip before getting here, so maybe it made us appreciate the food more than we would've otherwise - I'm just saying that because a lot of the other reviewers seem to think the food isn't that great, but we really enjoyed it. It is pretty dark as some others have said, but not so dark as it would cause any type of inconvenience. I got a burger and my wife got some type of Asian salad. She loved hers probably more than I did mine, but i was very pleased as well. The cheescake, although I can't quite remember which one we got, was fantastic, as you'd expect from this place. The portions are ridiculous as well, in a good way. Nothing worse than going out to eat and then walking away hungry, and that absolutely won't be the case here. I'd definitely recommend it."
Jeniffer S.,"Manassas, VA",7,33,12,5.0,12/20/2014,Excellent food and service. I got the four cheese pasta and my husband got the garlic pasta. We both loved the food!
James T.,"Annandale, VA",81,37,19,3.0,9/19/2014,"Come here only for their cheesecakes. The food isn't all that great. Honestly the only reason why I gave this place a 3 star was because of the cheesecakes. Without it, it would've been a 1 star. First off, our waiter forgot to put in an order for our appetizers. For entrees we had the shrimp scampi with steak diane and the chicken maderia with steak diane. The steak on both dishes was really sweet, I was kinda hoping for something a bit more savory. The chicken tasted like what you would get on an airplane and the shrimp was pretty good. The only bright side from our night was the cheesecakes. We had the vanilla bean and  chocolate tuxedo cream cheesecake. The vanilla bean cheesecake tasted like a vanilla milkshake which was surprisingly good. And the chocolate tuxedo was the bomb, an absolute must get if you come here. Overall I would come back, but only for their cheesecakes."
Sarina M.,"Alexandria, VA",1,11,,2.0,7/30/2014,It was my friend's birthday and of course it was a group of us..we had to wait for a good hour to get water!
Lara G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,13,2,5.0,7/2/2015,"After a negative experience with our group of 15 at a nearby restaurant, we came here without a reservation somewhat bracing ourselves for a long wait and/or general grumpiness at having to accommodate our large group.    Not so!   Cheesecake Factory welcomed us with open arms, allowed us to split our check up, served us delicious food quickly and cheerfully, and in general treated us with the respect a customer should be treated.    We've been to Cheesecake Factory for special occasions several times before and also had good experiences, but this sealed the deal for us....Cheesecake Factory has earned our loyalty!"
Daniel T.,"Arlington, VA",360,237,344,3.0,8/25/2014,"Everyone knows this place has HUGE menus.  They have a low calorie section for those who count calories...not me. Service was decent the past 2 times I've been. Nothing special, just another large American chain.  Good place to stop by for lunch if you work in the area."
Nathan S.,"Guam, Guam",0,3,129,5.0,1/20/2014,"This review is for TheCheesecakeFactory in Tysons Galleria(Zone B,Level 3).I believe that TheCheesecakeFactory was moved from 1796 International Dr,McLean,VA to 2001 International Drive McLean,VA 22102(Tysons Galleria).If this is common knowledge than I apologize since I am new to the   sure to check if you are calling to order,make reservations,or simply getting directions.  Overall,our server ALEM T.took great care of us,the food was delicious&,the price was very decent.The look of the place was very nice&CLEAN,&the staff was very pleasant.We will definitely be going back to TheCheesecakeFactory in Tysons Galleria,&we will be sure to ask for ALEM.Please be sure to ask for ALEM if you make TheCheesecakeFactory(Tysons Galleria)your next stop,you won't regret it&the food is just extra icing on the cake,the cheesecake that is. For my full review please continue reading below. ------------  We were in Virginia for a work/ vacation trip&wanted to find somewhere to eat.We called TheCheesecakeFactory ahead of time to ask if they accepted reservations which they only did for larger parties.We choose TheCheesecakeFactory at Tysons Galleria because we had already been to Tysons Corner the previous day&wanted to go&see the new Tysons,Tysons Galleria.We gave our taxi driver the address for the Cheese Cake Factory&ended up getting little lost,until we spotted the Neiman Marcus Dept.store sign after Tysons Corner.  We entered from curb side took the elevator&first thing we saw the dessert bar that displayed all 32 flavors of their Cheesecake specialties.We were not greeted at all probably by how late we had arrived it was 10:15pm&they closed at 11:00pm that evening.  We managed to find the hostess&thought that we were with another party until I asked ""a table for 2,please"".She escorted us to a booth near the bar&provided us with our menu&we asked her when last call was to order food,she responded with ""we close at 11 o'clock"".She did not portray a warm or friendly manner,but maybe she was just having a bad week(it was Monday).She then proceeded to remove the extra table settings(smart thinking).I think she might have said our serve will be with us shortly,but I could not recall truthfully.  I do remember ALEM greeting us as he made his way from the kitchen with another tables left overs.He said that he was our server&would be with us soon,which I can clearly recall.We had some time to look at our lengthy menu.We had time to take in the ambiance of the   looked classy almost high end which did not coincide with the very affordable pricing of our food.The design of the restaurant entrance seemed like that hotel lobby,with a fully stocked bar,&semi open kitchen only viewable if you are walking by but not from eye level while seated.We saw one of their appetizers(Avocado eggrolls)on display at their curb side entrance,&decided to order that along with their Portabella Mushroom Avocado&Zucchini Fries.ALEM greeted us&asked if we would like to start out with anything to drink,we ordered our appetizers first&could decide what to drink,we asked him what was popular on the menu because this was our first time.He suggested that he put in our appetizers&2 waters first so that he would have more time to go over the menu with us.He came back with our water&then went over the menu with us.He pointed out the drink selection referencing the page numbers for the drinks&the food orders.He pointed out some specialties like the ChickenMadeira,CajunJambalayaPasta which he was able to describe in detail.He also remarked that we could not leave without first trying on of their signature cheesecakes ""anyone of their 32 flavors"".  We decided to order the ChickenMadeira&Steak Diane&their CajunJambalayaPasta.He took our order&said he was going to check on our appetizers which should be out soon.He brought out our Avocado eggrolls,then later our Portabella Mushroom Avocado&Zucchini Fries.I liked the Fries We at them&the Avocado rolls were by far tastier than the Fries.ALEM came out a little later to tell us that our main course was ready early because it took a while for our appetizers to be prepared.He asked if it would be alright to bring that out now,I said it's fine since it was already 10:45pm.We received of main courses we were surprised by the large portions in comparison to the price($$).We really liked the Steak Diane; I liked the ChickenMadeira,&enjoyed the flavor&SPICE in the CajunJambalayaPasta.  We ordered the FreshBananaCreamCheesecake&the GodivaChocolateCheesecake.He brought us our desserts after he asked if we were ready for dessert since we only had a little bit of time to eat our main courses.We knew that we would be taking everything back to our hotel anyways.Dessert was delicious.   When our meal ended Alem chatted a little.He also recommended places nearby&asked us to stop by  -go boxes were Green.We had a great time most of the staff was friendly&2 different managers/ supervisors checked on us."
Luke L.,"Washington, DC",143,161,139,5.0,2/10/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is becoming a great American staple. It has an incredible variety of food, it is located just far enough out of the way (top floor of Tyson's Mall) that it is never quiet, and it isn't super loud. The sangria and the spicy chicken pasta were fantastic, but you certainly can't top the chocolate mouse cheesecake!"
Donald P.,"Washington, DC",273,1298,1430,5.0,6/29/2010,"I don't know what it is, but for some reason I HATE the idea of coming here. it's almost always on the bottom of my list. Some 10 years ago when I first heard about the Cheesecake Factory, I just thought it was another overpriced place for food snobs that like to pay a fortune and nibble on a few pieces of lettuce...probably because some of my friends were exactly that and ""raved"" about this place. Anyway to make a long story short, the few times I've been to The Cheesecake Factory at various locations, I've always been very impressed with the food, the price, and now...the decor. I can't believe we haven't tried this location earlier. When we stepped in, it almost felt like I was walking into a casino or something. Everything just felt ornate and very high end...which isn't surprising since it's at Tysons II, but compared to our longtime favorite -- Maggiano's -- it's the difference between night and day. Maggiano's has an older rustic ambiance, whereas Cheesecake Factory feels modern, trendy, hip. I guess the only other thing this place was lacking was the slot machines. Anyway the other reason I seem for forget is that their menu is very extensive. I guess their strategy is to appeal to EVERYONE so there's no reason not to go. For a chain restaurant, very few places come to mind that would compare. The eating experience here is just top notch. And the fact that this place is baby friendly makes it that much easier for us to go to...although the baby changing station was not very clean. Oh and the free valet is always appreciated."
