Heliya A.,"McLean, VA",1,7,4,4.0,6/11/2014,The Davinci Pasta and Avocado egg rolls are to die for!  Wish the restaurant was not that noisy. Make sure to make reservations if you are going with a large group.
Jon F.,"Nokesville, VA",76,16,12,2.0,5/22/2014,"The food at cheesecake is alway spectacular and a great reason to come here, when it comes to handling bigger groups, definitely an opportunity, took 20 min to get our waters which were brought out 2 at a time, 20 min after that our original drink orders were brought out, a group of 20 + people require a little more help than 2 guys doing their best and who also had other tables ???  Groups of 20+ = big bill especially when bottles of wine are being ordered, let's step up our game next time!"
Sarah F.,"Fairfax, VA",57,32,7,1.0,10/22/2015,"We had a really disappointing experience at the Tyson's location tonight. For starters, the restaurant was absolutely freezing, and we were sat directly behind a server station where servers found it appropriate to discuss tips and customers directly in front of us. Further, the other server in our station was laughing, shouting, and clapping so loudly you would have thought he was at a standup comedy show. Our server, on the other hand, seemed half awake, and dropped the ball on several items. We specifically asked for a soup entree to split, followed by another entree to split. We were then served one bowl of soup (with no soup spoons). We waited several minutes to ask our server for an extra bowl and soup spoons, but she was nowhere to be found, so we gave up and attempted to share it across the table with our teaspoons. Several waitstaff passed us clearly looking like we needed something, and nobody checked in. Then, our second entree arrived (orange chicken, also on a single plate rather than split as requested) and when our server finally brought us an extra plate, it was completely filthy and covered in what appeared to be crusted over olive oil. The chicken was beyond disappointing, and my husband almost swallowed a hunk of bone in on of the pieces. We told the server and pointed out the bone, but she didn't offer to bring a replacement entree, nor did a manager come by. Of all the times to at LEAST do a table touch, that would have been it. The only saving grace for the meal was the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake, which was very good. Honestly, a decent meal with good service should not be that difficult. I don't think we'll come back to this location."
Addy C.,"Atlanta, GA",1046,877,4291,4.0,3/22/2010,"Yes, I'm reviewing Cheesecake Factory. I don't care if there are Yelpers are out there who are thinking why's this girl rating a chain restaurant. I think their food is still Yelp-worthy, and I love their cheesecake.  Actually the reason we picked this place is b/c we wanted our friend who recently had a baby choose the place - she picked Cheesecake Factory not only b/c she loves the food but b/c the place is noisy, and as new moms know, they feel more comfortable taking their babies (or young ones) to a noisy restaurant. Plus Tyson's Corner is a great central location as a couple of us were coming from Maryland, and the other two from Virginia. This place is also great for groups with varied tastes - their menu is HUGE. It's also great for big & small eaters - the portions are HUGE so big eaters can leave satisfied, and small eaters (& frugal eaters like me) have enough food to make two meals :) Great time to go is before 5pm b/c they have lunch specials - and portions are still HUGE. I got the ""Pasta Da Vinci"" for $10.95 b/c it was our server's favorite, and shortly thereafter found out it was one of my friend's favorites, too. This dish has penne pasta w/ sauteed chicken and mushrooms & onions in Madeira wine sauce. It was a little on the sweet side but I love sweet so it was perfect for me. Other dishes I tasted were the ""Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta"" (loved this too - I love cream sauce, and I'd get this next time), ""Four Cheeese Pasta"" (pretty good), ""Sweet Corn Tamale"" (good for sharing), and ""Fried Calamari"" (good but didn't care for the ""cocktail sauce"" as their choice for dipping sauce).  For dessert, got the special promo ""Red Velvet Cheesecake"" - no description needed, except for this cheesecake only, $.25 goes toward the ""Feeding America"" organization. Why just $.25 and why just the Red Velvet ... seems like they could've applied their generosity more but who am I to judge. A slice of cheesecake is a little pricey at $7.50 but easily shared among 4 people.  Overall 3.5 stars rounded to 4 b/c of great service, great variety of menu selections, generous portions, reasonable prices, convenient location. Restaurant located at the mall so plenty of free parking in front."
Mohammed K.,"Washington, DC",60,119,27,2.0,6/5/2012,"I always forget not to go there for the food,I should only go there for the dessert thats it, the name should give me a reminder for next time. We were a table of four and we had two mistakes with our order one was a salad that shouldnt have had chicken and it came with the chicken still in it. the second mistake was that my mother asked for brown rice and the salmon dish came with white rice. Finally the burger I ate still had the uncooked meat smell in it and by the time i got home i had stomach problems. BUT the dessert the cakes and the cheesecakes are flawless and always good to come here for them."
Glenn C.,"Reston, VA",54,118,3,2.0,4/4/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is a perfect example of a jack of all trades and a master of none. I've never left here saying ""man, I can't wait to come back."" The menu is the size of a book, offering literally every type of cuisine I can think for. There's pasta, pizza, proteins of all kinds, soups, salads, tacos, curry, asian-inspired dishes, nachos, wings, noodles, and even more that I cannot honestly remember. Then of course there are the cheesecakes, which come in what must be 500 different flavors. When a restaurant tries to include anything you could possibly be in the mood for, they insure that it won't be expertly prepared. How can any kitchen possibly master so many dishes from so many different branches of the culinary art? The answer is they can't, and that inability shows itself when it arrives at your table. Of course, their big claim to fame are their cheesecakes. I'm not saying that they're terrible, but for a restaurant to name itself after one signature dish, it had better be perfect, or as close to it as possible. Alas, yet again the Factory lets itself down. True cheesecake, the kind you'll find in a real New York delicatessen, doesn't come in dozens of different flavors, and it's also nowhere near the consistency you'll find here. Cheesecake should be firm yet creamy, and the crust shouldn't factor in nearly as much as Cheesecake Factory makes it. The last time I visited, I had a flank steak that was overcooked and nowhere near as tender as it should have been- and we're talking about flank steak here, not filet. I don't blame the chefs getting it wrong. Combining the size of the menu with how cavernously large the dining room is, they must be under constant attack from 5:30 until close. It always makes me scratch my head how people will wait an hour or more for a table here when there are dozens of far superior restaurants within a mile radius. Save yourself a wait and a uninteresting dinner, and choose any one of those better eateries."
Fred E.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,12,4,1.0,12/14/2014,"What a Sham?    This Cheesecake Factory is cutting corners.  The burger is shrinking, has been cut back, and not sure what the ingredients are anymore, i.e.; in rubbery bits and hard parts chopped in.  This is terrible ! We also had the Grande Burrito, and sadly it also shrank, we received a half of what it used to be.   Then they pour tomato sauce on top, and inside instead of the rice and cilantro sauce it was tomato sauce inside.  We were charged $15 for Mini Burritos and $13 for the not so beefy hamburger. The Cheesecake ingredients had dropped dramatically, instead of fresh cream they are using vegetable oil, vegetable shortening.  We got sick of them and their Carrot Cake crumbles although frozen.  Not Acceptable for the prices charged. This location definitely needs a total revamp.   Think management has made it stale, cutting back.    CanNot recommend it any longer as a valid CCF location."
Nick S.,"Washington, DC",74,1592,1954,4.0,1/13/2013,"The Cheesecake Factory is the ultimate democratic option when you're meeting a group of friends or family. While it may not wow your socks off, there's going to be something for everyone on the menu. For lunch, the Renee's Special is actually a pretty great deal for $11. You get a half sandwich, cup of soup and a small salad, which is a normal salad. This is Cheesecake Factory, after all. The chicken walnut salad sandwich was quite good, with thick, toasted and buttered bread and a shocking amount of flavor. The cream of chicken soup had thick chunks of white meat chicken and plenty of fresh vegetables. The salad was simple, just spinach leaves and vinaigrette, but it served as a proper side. Surprisingly, there's no vegan cheesecake on their dessert menu. I have a cousin who's lactose intolerant, and he was forced to watch (cruelly) as we all devoured original and banana cheesecakes. (banana, so good - who knew?)"
Ryan M.,"Leesburg, VA",0,457,201,4.0,7/11/2012,"This Cheesecake Factory is in a bit of an odd location on the top floor of Tysons Galleria.  It never seems to be too crowded, which is odd (and doesn't bode well) for a Cheesecake Factory. Been a couple times.  Everything as you'd expect from Cheesecake (except the strange lack of crowd, though also lack of an hour wait). Order 1: Fish tacos, cod, grilled.  Delicious, but horribly messy. Whatever kind of tortillas they use fall apart before the plate is in front of you.  Don't order on a date or business meeting. Order 2: Turkey/avocado/bacon sandwich.  Delicious.  Great, lighter option."
Vivian L.,"Potomac, MD",12,31,16,4.0,1/6/2013,"This could be a total fluke, but my experience for brunch today at this Cheesecake Factory was super pleasant. Who knew that Cheesecake Factory has a brunch menu?  I certainly didn't.  I also haven't been to a Cheesecake Factory in over five years.  Today's experience may change this. I also noticed that Cheesecake Factory now has a 'skinnylicious menu.'  Though I didn't order from it, it's good to know that they are thinking of our waistlines.   To start things off, the server was great and very attentive.  Refills on drinks were automatic and right on time.  The wait for the food was minimal.  It could also be that it was 11:30 AM and the place was barely filled (probably because no one knows that they serve brunch). We ordered the lemon-ricotta pancakes, which were absolutely DEEE-LICIOUS!  Reminded me of the delicious lemon-ricotta pancakes I had at BLD in Los Angeles (which was featured on Food Network's 'Best Thing I Ever Ate').  I would definitely come back for brunch to eat these again. Also ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad...I know, I know fish and pancakes don't go that well together.  But, the salad dressing was on point.  The avocado it came out with was miserable-looking but I let it go because hey, it's winter on the East Coast...I'm sure it's hard to get good looking avocados at this time.  The salad overall tasted good but was very overprice at almost $17. We tipped the server well---service here was great!  Overall, I'm a fan...of just this location."
Robinson L.,"Sterling, VA",444,10,,2.0,12/5/2014,Why is the lighting in this restaurant so dark? Also it took like 45 minutes to get our bread and drinks. The food was good but really expensive. Also even though we had reservations it still took them an additional 30 minutes for them to seat us.
Doris L.,"Suitland, MD",2,34,131,5.0,7/27/2014,There are lot of choices on the menu. Great location nice ambience.  The drinks were made well and complemented our menu selection. I like that the waitstaff wears white.  We shared the red velvet cheesecake it was very moist.
Phillip B.,"Hyattsville, MD",0,1,,4.0,8/19/2013,"Cheesecake factory hamburger The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was classic, The server was patient and very attentive and the food was not too terribly expensive. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. When I was in North Carolina on the Outer Banks there was an establishment that claimed to have the best burgers on the beach. But what I found was that it was not so and the place that had the best burgers on the beach was Sonic. Be that as it may, there is a secret to having a flavorful hamburger with cheese on it. It is not in the cheese as some may think. Not wanting to run the risk of revealing secrets, I must tell you that the cheesecake factory has come as close to, if not reaching that secret blend which makes the taste of a cheeseburger with bacon, the ultimate in exquisite cuisine,  fixings notwithstanding."
Daniel L.,"Arlington, VA",0,3,1,5.0,10/20/2015,"Its hard to go wrong with cheesecake factory in general with the number of options and the amount of food they give you. But I think the weekday lunch manager Anthony is really what makes this place great. Had a group order to go for work, Anthony handled it personally to ensure everything was right, everything turned out delicious, and when he found out it was my coworker's birthday, he gave us a free slice of banana cream cheesecake!"
Mark S.,"Fairfax, VA",184,681,73,2.0,3/29/2012,"Came here about a month or two ago for my wife's cousin's birthday. The host staff was rude to my wife, but nice to me (maybe because they were females?). anyways, I had asked if it was okay to walk around and how far the pagers/beepers would go.. the hostess told me I could walk around anywhere in the mall (1 hour long wait), but the pager/beeper only works just outside of the restaurant. She said once I'm done walking around to just check back with them to see if the pager is still activated. We all walked around, we went back and my wife went to ask them. They basically were just saying ""your table isn't ready yet!"".. when my wife obviously knows that, but she wanted to make sure the pager works since we walked outside the area and the hostress said it might get deactivated. my wife's other cousin knew one of the managers and spoke to him. luckily he got us seating (no thanks to the crappy hostesses). we all sat down to eat.. 10 of us squished at a table that holds maybe 6 people comfortably.  The food was in large quantities as Cheesecake is known for. However the quality of the food was just mediocre. Well the food was OK, but the atmosphere brought it down. Cheesecake is loud and obnoxious.. and it might help to turn up the lights a little bit. Very dim inside the restaurant. Our waiter was slow with our food/check and didn't know anything about the drinks. Of course since we had 10 people.. gratuity was automatically added to the check.. even though we didn't think he earned the full amount.  In the end, wouldn't go back here again. now I remember why I never eat at chain restaurants."
J S.,"Alexandria, VA",46,15,1,2.0,1/1/2014,"Listen, We all have our bad days and at chain restaurants there tends to be more to bite off than you can chew, between the encyclopedia of every pop culture food ever sold at any and all other chain restaurants, to the same broken record brightly colored cocktails from the early 90's to the same old same blind eyed service from an employee who definitely is more concerned about leaving with money, than being there to do the job first and foremost. I wasn't even going to write this thing because I don't want to trash restaurants on here, particularly chains which is very much a ""you know what you're getting into when you come here"" thing.  But a bunch of basic steps in the world of service were completely ignored here.  A birthday group of 9 shows up at 5 and leaves after 8:30 and not because their casually hanging out just enjoying the decor and the coffee?  That's INSANE. Took three trips from this guy to get full drink orders.  He missed out on his chance to sell dessert because he randomly rang in only two people's orders and then just dissapeared.  He took leftoever food away from the table to box it himself in some hidden corner of the restaurant, carrying dirty plates from fellow table members over top of this food to be brought home and even proceeded to go to another table with it to answer a random person's question, with my food just leaning in on their table where there food is?  Come on. The worst offense was the check though.  Not establishing at the beginning that there were going to be seperate checks, this guy brings us the check, tells us to number 1, 2, 3, 4 on each order so they know how to seperate it and then write who's card is who's for each number!  Comes back what mustve been a seriously legitimate ten minutes later (felt like 20) and presented us with the seperated checks to make sure they were done right....then went away again to physically ring up the check?  Come on now man....this guy was gone for ANOTHER 10 minutes.  Nice kid, but flighty as all get out without a lick of ability to multitask - Granted he was busy, but his mistakes started early on.  When my sister in law told him she couldn't decide between a shot of patron or a margarita, he sat there and waited for her response.  She then said - You know what, put the patron IN the margarita, everyone laughed and with her drink only (three mojito's and sodas and stuff were ordered at this point as well) comes by with a shot of patron.....and then tells her that the margarita is coming shortly........???????  Oh, not a maragarita pure per say, but one without tequila for her to add her own as .... she desired?????  Or something that made no damn sense lol.  Birthday girl, we ask the guy if there are cheesecakes that are key lime....he says yes - Someone then goes - wait wait wait, anything with coconut?  The waiter says, there's a Khalua Coconut (we flip cause Khalua is the birthday girls favorite liqueur and she's a freak for coconut so double whammy) - waiter says great - comes back with a slice of key lime cheese cake with a candle in it......What the hell kind of mess????? My wife and I order a chicken caesar salad to split....never split, no extra plate until everybody else's food came out which was all seperate and crazy, apparently spinach was being waited on for someone's crab cake dish and this caused mayhem.  Finally get the plate, split the caesar salad - expected that generic garlicy, cheesey, creamy chicken flavor you get from all caesar salads....which for the most part we did get...until I get slapped by a sweetness, definitely like a terriyaki sauce.....investigate the plate further and underneath the salad, is a healthy dollop of terriyaki sauce.  Not only interesting because that's not something you find in a traditional caesar salad, but odd too because no one at the table had anything terriyaki so it wasn't spill from another plate.  Which means I was served a caesar salad that definitely was either dirty and not washed previously, or was plated with terriyaki and then just disregarded to swap that platte out and put a caesar salad on top of it anyway???????  When presented to the server, he apologizes about it, brings out a new one after everyone else finishes their meal.  no manager follow up, had to not only pay for both this salad and the dessert we ordered, but we also had to pay for the birthday girl cheesecake, you know, the one we didn't request! Place is a huge mess man, it's not just the server, it's the management of how service is conducted and it goes as far as back to the kitchen, cause that plate error, no expiditor on a line would've been able to see, that was the mistake of the whoever was responsible at the salad station, the manager should've been made aware of the problems to offer further assistance at the table and the server should've pre labled every seat so he could've swiftly saved us from that last hour playing this seperation game / follow up check order.  Just awful."
Minna S.,"Seattle, WA",74,72,141,5.0,5/23/2014,I always go for happy hour (4-6pm) and it is the best deal ever! Most of their happy hour options are around $5. Their chicken sliders and tamales are the best!
Rob H.,"Columbus, OH",29,3,1,1.0,11/11/2011,"So, I wanted a pork chop.  I got raw pork. They took it back and brought me a new one, which was not only raw inside, but was burned on the outside. The manager said he would have the kitchen manager fix it. Third time, the only positive note was that it wasn't raw, it was the same piece of meat from the second attempt, burnt black. I gave up. On the positive side, hey didn't charge me for the meal I didn't eat, and they gave me a free piece of cheesecake. On the downside, I spent an hour watching my friend eat, didn't have any dinner of my own. The manager was very nice, and removed the entre from my bill and even comped a piece of cheesecake for both of us, but all in all, it was a horrid experience. If the 'kitchen manager' will serve something obviously burned, it doesn't bode well for the rest of the experience."
Nicole L.,"Washington, DC",1056,1561,92,3.0,5/21/2010,"For the first time I actually ate at this restaurant. We ordered a few light snack - the crab balls, chicken croquettes and the cheese pizza. They tasted greasy and heavy - everything tasted heavy here. What can I say? It's franchastic! The only thing I liked was this: Flying Gorrilla Fresh Banana, Chocolate, Ice Cream Creme de Cacao and Banana Liqueur. Super awesome milkshake like drink with alcohol! Can't go wrong with banana and chocolate."
C Q.,"Montgomery Village, MD",0,283,3,3.0,9/16/2012,"Service was good. The bread and butter were not as good as the ones served at the Great American Restaurants (such as Sweet Water Tavern), they were not bad. We order two burgers and Alfredo.  The burgers and fries were not too bad.  Alfredo sauce was a little too salty.   We took most of the alfredo home and there was about 5 tablespoon of oil sitting in the container the next day. We had a pleasant evening.  We might come here again for appetizer and dessert.  We will be ok if to join others to eat here.  But I don't think we will have the urge to visit again on our own."
