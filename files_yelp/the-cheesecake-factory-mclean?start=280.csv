Lissa B.,"Washington, DC",24,473,2884,5.0,6/8/2010,"I have been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years.  I love the huge portions (which have actually decreased in size--not a bad thing since the portions used to be ridiculous!) and an appetizer is enough to fill me up!  I have tried many, many items on their menu and I believe fully that the best thing on the menu is the ""Avocado Eggrolls.""  Seriously, if you haven't tried them, order them next time you go!  It sounds bizarre, but they are amazing.  The sauce that comes with them is incredible and if I am with a group of friends, we order one sauce for each of us or we fight!  It also comes with these fried white rice noodle things which also taste good dipped in the sauce and are fun to munch on.  :)"
Terry G.,"Pensacola, FL",187,147,91,4.0,5/17/2012,"The take-out cheesecake is fantastic, though for about $8 the portion could be bigger.  If you're in a rush and just need a cheesecake fix, go in, look at the big selection of slickes to-go, and take home a slice of heaven."
A. B.,"Dallas, TX",1,89,,5.0,7/20/2015,Great service. We were waited on upon arrival. We were able to choose a great location near a window. The food was great. A wonderful experience. Waitress was prompt with our orders. This restaurant manager knows how to train his or her employees right. I appreciated the diversity in staff. I've visited here on many occasions. Never a disappointment.
Emily W.,"Washington, DC",63,82,19,1.0,8/5/2011,"Good ""skinny"" mojito, made with Splenda.   Everything else on their menu will also make you skinny because you will literally die of starvation while you wait for these overworked teenagers to get their sh*t together and bring your food to someone else's table where their screaming kids will eat it as you lose consciousness and are pronounced DOA before you can even hit the Tyson's Anthropologie and get that awesome dress that's a little overpriced but you buy it anyway.  Yeah. I'm not coming back here. PS: I've been here 2 times, and it was the same experience on both occasions. If you absolutely have to eat at this mall, go to Maggiano's and sit at the bar to eat."
Lady H.,"Washington, DC",0,56,81,3.0,8/16/2015,"delicious food and great drinks. bar service ( carolyn ) was not very attentive  no water , no ask for drinks when I walk in,  I would preferred to go to the fair oaks one instead of tysons one"
Seungri C.,"Allen, TX",11,78,7,3.0,11/2/2011,"Everyone in my family loves this restaurant, but I do not. Service is so-so, and I can't blame them too much since we go there during their peak hours...but still, do something about it. (Hint: Check up  on your customers to see if they want a refill.) Their food could be better (don't douse it in butter) and they should really take a look at their portion size, because OMG, I cannot eat a dish that looks like it could feed 5-6 people! Cheesecakes...uhm...too fatty but they are dang sweet. My favourite is the keylime pie one."
Adam P.,"Waynesboro, PA",1,38,30,5.0,4/6/2014,"This place is great, there is nothing to dislike food was hot, fast and very tasty. Try the Kobe burger it was the best burger I've ever had. The blueberry mohito was the best I've ever had we will deff be back"
Yu-min L.,"Lakeview, Chicago, IL",27,5,20,3.0,8/19/2012,"The restaurant decoration is elaborate and reminded me of Willie Wonker and the chocolate factory... Maybe it's because of all the cheesecakes options. The oven-fresh wheat bread is a good pre-appetizer. The menu is large and contains mostly meat-based dishes. I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta. The quantity was huge and mostly pasta. I did not make a dent to my plate though I had my fill. The taste is heavier than what I usually have it and I would personally like to have more vegetable in the pasta instead of having them sprinkle here and there on my pasta. The waitress was humorous and quite attentive for the first half of the service. She kept my friend waiting for a very long time on refilling his diet coke, which I was surprised about since I was told that the waiters in the States will do their best to prevent the customer's glasses go empty."
Brian W.,"Fort Washington, MD",1,12,37,5.0,4/12/2014,This is my favorite chain restaurant! The menu has basically everything and is always delicious! Customer service is awesome here as well!
Amir Matin S.,"Rockville, MD",47,104,39,3.0,1/11/2014,"Generally like the menu here, although it's ridiculously big. You're hard pressed to find a bad dish. Service isn't the best at this location, but I'll eat here now & then."
Jon K.,"Alexandria, VA",244,257,7,4.0,6/6/2011,"OK, I like this place but try not to go too often. They have some great meals. The McLean location is inside Tysons Galleria which is a pretty nice mall. Also, I have to say I like this location the best of all the locations I have been too because it has a nice wide open spread out bar area. I find that the portion sizes here are enormous and it's pretty damn nice food. Here are some of the items I often order: Stuffed Chicken Tortillas (dee-lish, but totally huge) Factory Burrito Grande (double yum) Pasta with Meat Sauce (yummilicious) Had the cuban sandwich here once, didn't like it. Probably because it's not a true Cuban sandwich. Here are some of the cheesecakes I have tried (not a bad one in the bunch): Fresh Banana Cream (Fantastic) Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple (My favorite) Vanilla Bean (Very nice) Caramel Pecan Turtle (Excellent) I might add that the staff has always been very accommodating in this location. I always feel like I need to work out for the next few weeks after coming to the Cheesecake Factory. While they have great food, I have seen how much calories some of their food has in an article I read online once (-1 star for being unhealthy). Highly recommended for a once in a while treat..."

Duaa E.,"Sterling, VA",0,1,,1.0,6/10/2013,"I'm a frequent diner at The Cheesecake Factory and never experienced this type of customer service. Today was the worst customer service experience. I ordered a salad without bacon and it was brought out to my table WITH bacon THREE times. After the second time, the manager said he would make the salad himself without bacon. It came out the third time WITH bacon so he obviously didn't make it. He didn't even come out to apologize. I left the restaurant hungry without eating the salad. I won't be returning here."
Paul Y.,"Vienna, VA",414,50,20,3.0,10/30/2013,The food is very decent and enjoyable.  Would recommend it if you are here with a bunch of friends for dinner and willing to spend a few extra bucks for their cheesecakes.  My first time here and it was enjoyable.
Dmitry D.,"Long Island, NY",56,426,550,1.0,6/11/2011,"I usually love the food at cheesecake factory, but this is by far the worst cheesecake factory I have ever eaten at. It was so bad, we had to send both of our dinners back."
Mike B.,"Salem, OR",40,198,43,4.0,12/2/2010,"I honestly thought The Cheesecake Factory was a fictional place because I had only heard of it on The Big Bang Theory television show.  I was extremely surprised to find it was a real place upon my recent visit to the Washington DC area. My dining companions and I arrived about 7:30 in the evening and there was no line and no waiting even though the restaurant was packed. We were seated at a table near the front, and our drink order was taken immediately.  When the drinks came we ordered our appetizers (spinach dip), when the appetizer arrived we were ready to order. My dining companions ordered a Burger and Fettuccine Alfredo respectively.  I opted for their Shepard's Pie.  All the meals were well prepared, tasty and hot upon arrival. The portions were generous and we all had a little left over. Our server was engaging and friendly.  She was a pleasure to have wait on us. Price point for this location was extremely reasonable for the portions and service."
Vishal S.,"Rockville, MD",300,1068,131,5.0,9/16/2008,"I am a BIG fan of Cheesecake Factory. This is one of the best chain restaurants in USA. I have experienced the same good service level at all the locations I have visited. Food portions are huge so if you are okay with sharing - you can get away with 1 appetizer and 2 main dishes among 3 adult men. Dont forget the dessert tho! My latest trip to Cheesecake Factory in Tysons 2 mall was last night. We had Sweet Corn tamale cakes for appetizers - an absolutely must have dish @ Cheesecake factory. This was followed by Spicy Chipotle Chicken pasta (me) and Chicken Madeira (my date). I would have been okay with just one Entre but my date thought we would come across as being cheap if we ordered only one entre.  I had only a fourth of my huge (but tasty) dish and got the rest to go -  Had to save the best for last - the Cheesecake. I generally get the Godiva Cheesecake but wanted to be different and ordered the 30th Anniversary special Cheesecake. It was okay not up to the Godiva Cheesecake, so the next time I will be loyal to my regular cheesecake. The Bad @ Cheesecake - Food is heavy and I'm sure not the most healthy place to eat at. Other downside is the wait - expecially for parties over 4 the wait can be over 1 hour. But it is definitely worth it for an occasional eat."

Marcus P.,"Washington D.C., DC",68,126,6,3.0,7/16/2011,"It's easy to pick on The Cheesecake Factory; it's monolithic, it's ostentatious...it's downright garish. But unlike 16 years ago (when I loathed this place for being an accesory to the manslaughter of ""real"" restaurants), today I find the grandiose overwork of that Roman-y motiff refreshing, actually. It's familiar and safe and very luxurious compared to the indy-boutiquey-trendy D.C. spots I've been hitting lately.  First of all, on a Saturday afternoon, three of us were seated in a booth that could easily accommodate, let's say, Ashanti and her crew NOW--surely. Our waiter, Robert, was excellent...almost creepily so. Not nearly as modelesque as some of those trendy D.C. restaurants' waiters, but disarmingly charming, well versed, well rehearsed. My table mate admitted: I'd give him some if I were into white guys like that. I think we all were impressed...but I digress.  I ordered a staple: Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. After nearly two decades of dining here I've tried just about everything on the jy-normous menu and know most of it to be mostly moderate fare with the occasional, ""Wow! Taste this..."" moments sprinkled here and there. My mates ordered the Louisiana Pasta and the Seared Salmon. The dishes were huge and spicy and pretty damn good, we had to admit. Yes it was a sadistic amount of food; yes it tasted somewhat mass-produced and recently refreshed with sauces, spice, a sprig of pasley and a squeeze of lemon. Let me ask you something: you ever pay $50 for a meal that looked like it was prepared for a oompa-loompa? Colorful; interesting; small. I revel in the fact of knowing I'll have leftovers later tonight...I even ordered another basket of that delicious wheat bread at the end of the meal. And the total for such opulence: $67...amazing, trust me.   Back in the day I hated The Cheesecake Factory for the pretentious bore I thought it was; today I enjoy it as an inevitable way of ending a ""pamper me"" day of material waste and gluttony at my local mall."
Salma M.,"Clarksburg, MD",5,59,23,3.0,3/11/2013,Avocado egg roles and strawberry lemonade! Yum lots of different food and very big portion so if you go there for dinner you know you have left over lunch for the next day!
