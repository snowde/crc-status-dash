M G.,"Northern, VA",3,91,2,1.0,8/24/2012,"I think this place is ridiculous because they spam you with ads while you're trying to decide what you want to order.  Don't I already pay you enough money to eat here?  It's not like they're so cheap they need ads.  The restaurant's service wasn't great, and the food was mediocre.  They mostly only have chicken, which was difficult for us to deal with because of poultry and fish allergies.  The menu seems diverse, but when you have allergies, and the entire menu is consists mostly of chicken, it's just not a great match.  It seems that this place is known for giving you cheap food over quality food.  There are a ton of pasta/rice/chicken dishes and very few steak/pork/shrimp dishes.  It just felt too commercialized, which is bad considering I'd be just fine hitting up Coastal Flats.  Overall, I'd rather go to Cafe Deluxe, which is cheaper and better - I'd avoid this place all together."
V H.,"McLean, VA",23,88,66,2.0,10/28/2014,"I usually looove the cheesecake factory. Great food, drinks, and deserts. This is my first time visiting the Tysons corner restaurant. I was very disappointed. The waiter had a terrible time keeping our drinks full. He never once refilled my water. Thankfully my date ordered a coke and water. I drank his water after drinking mine. Our appetizers came out fine, after that it was complete disaster. We were waiting for twenty minutes for the main courses to come. The manager came by (not out waiter) to apologize that our meal world be a few more minutes. She never gave us a reason. We didn't ask. We thanked her and waited another 10 minutes. When out food did arrive, my date ordered a steak, medium. This was no where near medium. Extremely undercooked. We did not complain. Asked for a to go box, and petey the pit bull had a wonderful steak dinner on us! Sad to say, I will not be going back to this Tysons chain ever again."

Princess A.,"Falls Church City, Falls Church, VA",25,149,1,2.0,11/4/2014,"Usually, I really enjoy this place, but not recently. Over the Weekend, I went out with my Family to have a meal. Wasn't impressed this time, actually disappointed this time. A cheese pizza was ordered, and my sister said it made her stomach hurt. Also ordered fish tacos(includes beans and rice) Which was alright, but not that hot. (Could tell they waited for all the dishes to come out, because the tacos weren't as hot, as i would prefer.) I ordered a chicken dish with a cream sauce and tomatoes. Sounded good,  as i was trying to pick a pasta dish that didn't have cheese in it, as I'm allergic. The dish came nice and hot, but covered in cheese. (I didn't know when I ordered it, otherwise wouldn't have gotten it.) The waitress came over and said there's no cheese in that dish, well obviously there was, you could smell and see it. But she was nice enough to take it back and off the final check. I ordered white chicken chili, which usually I LOVE. But this time it was just awful. Was not chili, as the taste was very brothy(like soup). Tasted like they didn't have enough chili, so to do things quickly, they poured over chicken and rice soup over it( which is what it tasted like)I'm not a soup person, or do i like both/soupy things. Yuck, absolutely disgusting. Ate some, but was totally grossed out. Payed, and ended up going to Baja fresh near our house. Overall, won't be back anytime soon. And If i decide to try this place again, I will order other items, but it won't be for a while."
Geoff O.,"Alexandria, VA",49,197,2,4.0,3/22/2011,"It's the Cheesecake Factory. In Tysons. Yay? Rah? No surprises here. Staff were nice enough to put us somewhere a bit quieter. I was actually very please with our waitress. My mom can't have gluten, and though CF lacks a dedicated gluten-free menu, the server actually took the time to find some unofficial gluten-free list from the kitchen, which greatly aided my mom in deciding what to get. That was a classy move and I really appreciated it. Beyond that, CF food is the same everywhere, but it's good. People knock it because it's a pseudo-swanky chain, but I do think the quality of the food tends to be pretty spot-on.  Besides, have you HAD fried macaroni and cheese? Holy joygasm."
Meghan S.,"Alexandria, VA",71,224,45,5.0,2/27/2013,I come here at least once a month. Always great service. I typically sit in the bar area since it's first come first serve. This location has better service than the one in Clarendon.
Yelpowitz E.,"McLean, VA",17,160,26,4.0,3/3/2011,"Service is good --well, in every location servers have to memorize and recite the specials of the day so fast that you can only get the first and the last words of the tale,-- but other than that, service is good.  Bread is awesome food is delicious... I have many favorites: chicken madeira, orange chicken, avocado egg rolls, pasta, etc.  I don't usually eat their cheesecake. It's too fattening!"
Chunnu B.,"Fairfax Station, VA",242,399,809,4.0,6/17/2010,"Lots of delicious food and good service, that's all I need. I kid you not about the ""lots of delicious food"" part either, portions here are huge. CF used to be super hyped up and rightfully so, especially this location in the Galleria. I've never once had a problem here unlike another nearby CF location in another mall where something always got screwed up (*cough*fairoaks*cough*.) Great for any meal of the day. I've come for lunch and dinner but I hear their brunch is pretty flippin fantastic too. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their forever long menu either, everything is good and dessert is of course the best part - a nice long list of cheesecakes. Their pumpkin cheesecake is what I wait for every fall but on their year round menu, go with the Turtle or Vanilla. Come to think of it, even their specialty desserts are really good too (Carrot cake!!) The fact that this place is open late makes it even better. If it's just you and 2 friends, 5 friends, or even 15 friends this place does a great job at accommodating different group sizes. I've gone a few times with large groups and the people working here do well. Just make sure to call ahead, this place does not do reservations, and it gets pretty packed on Friday and Saturday nights."
Tricia L.,"Germantown, MD",9,6,2,1.0,6/16/2013,"Where to start?... Hmm well I can confidently say that I had one of the worst dining experiences tonight at this Cheesecake Factory. We arrived at Cheesecake around 8:45 and surprisingly there was no wait (after all it was a Saturday night). We had to make a 10:50 movie so this was perfect!  Our server was Tareq who greeted us fairly quickly after we were seated. We started by ordering waters and received them shortly after. Good start right? Let me emphasize START because everything went downhill from here. My one guest ordered a Dirty Ketle martini with blue cheese olives, I ordered a passion fruit mojito and my other guest ordered an old fashion. Our drinks took some time to get delivered and when we received them we were not impressed. My mojito looked and tasted good but really didn't have any liquor in it. Don't get me wrong, I am by no means an alcoholic but if i wanted juice it sure as hell wouldn't have costed $10... My one guest might as well just have ordered olive juice.....Sounds gross right? Right, his martini was awful and as crazy as it sounds really didn't taste like it had liquor in it either...weird considering 98% of a martini is supposed to be liquor. Oh yes and I forgot to mention the fact that he didn't get his blue cheese olives.  Whatever, anyways he got his olives and drank his liquor infused olive juice so we weren't ""those people."" Who are those people you ask; those people are the ones who constantly complain when they go out to eat for no reason other than to get shit for free. There is however a time and place for this obnoxious behavior and tonight was one of them. Now on to the food order. My one guest ordered the coulette steak MEDIUM RARE, my other guest ordered shrimp jumbalaya with extra sauce on the side and I ordered the chicken tortilla salad. Food came out and the steak was on the verge of well done (Ew), my salad had maybe 5 small slithers of chicken in it and the extra sauce for the shrimp dish was nonexistent. Funny considering our server was also non existent for a good 20 minutes. Long enough for my guest to get out of his seat and have to ask a bus boy for the extra sauce. It came out and then 5 minutes later so did Tareq. He asked how everything was at that moment......really? It's a little too late don't you think? Yeah so that was that. At the end of the meal I informed Tareq how overcooked the steak was and made it known that we were looking for him but he was not around. He expressed concern for .5 seconds and then walked away to get the dessert menu. At this point I was so fed up with everything that I declined cheesecake; this was one of the only reasons I wanted to go to cheesecake in the first place. Sooo to say I was pissed is an understatement....we paid our bill and tipped just under 18% because being a server myself I understand the whole $3.00 a hour issue. Let it be known though that he deserved way less than this. I then asked to speak to a manager when as my server I think Tareq should have taken the initiative to get them involved from the beginning. I told the manager, Jeremy what happened and explained the inattentiveness of Tareq and lack of urgency in his staff. Jeremy was nice and said everything a manager should say including ""when you come back I will take care of you."" This was a nice gesture but I live over an hour away from this location and the last thing I want is to have another awful experience. However, I feel as though he could have handled a guest complaint a little differently, it was as if it were of no real concern at that moment. Moral of the story is for the first time in a long time I was dissatisfied with over 90% of my dining experience at a chain restaurant. I hope this issue is addressed ASAP.  Thanks for reading!"
Jack F.,"Dallas, TX",559,1045,799,3.0,1/31/2010,"Strategy:  At restaurant factories like the Cheesecake Factory you need to be prepared and you need to know how to plan your menu.  First, arrive early to bet the lunchtime/dinnertime rush.  You don't want to be stuck waiting for an hour for mediocre food.  Second, be mindful of portion sizes.  A single entree is enough to feed a table of 3 or 4 people.  If you truly want variety, order the Factory Appetizer Favorites for $29.00  (Serves Four or More! A Combination of Our Favorite Appetizers including: Avocado Eggrolls, Spinach and Cheese Dip, Pot Stickers, Shrimp Summer Rolls, Quesadilla, Corn Cakes, Buffalo Blasts® and Calamari.)  No joke, they bring out four plates of food.  Since most of these dishes are vegetarian, order a set of mini-burgers to get your fill.  As for the cheesecake?  One slice is plenty for the entire table.  Anymore and you'd be in a food coma.  Of course, my favorite part about the Cheesecake Factory?  You bank on their mistakes.  Our chicken fried steak sliders came out 25 minutes after ordering.  The manager eventually came by and offered everyone a free slice of cheesecake.  This kind gesture won't bump up my review but it's enough to keep me happy and willing to return again.  What's the price of my patience?  Apparently a slice of cheesecake.  [Last Visit: January 31, 2010]"
Neesha S.,"Boulder, CO",0,23,,2.0,11/30/2014,"I've been to many Cheesecake Factory franchises and to this one before. I have Celiac's and always order the corn tamales and gf Evelyn's favorite pasta. Generally I would give the Cheesecake Factory 5 stars, but it seems that the Tysons franchise has some new untrained folks in the kitchen. My pasta dish had a piece of glutenous pasta mixed in it and then the manager took it and said they'd give me a new plate. Well, the new plate wound up also having glutenous pasta mixed in! Both times I didn't realize there was glutenous pasta until I'd already started eating...... I paid for that the next day!"
Fawaz B.,"McLean, VA",0,5,3,1.0,10/18/2014,"My 7 year old Just found a bug in her salad and no one bothered to say sorry. Service is not about smiling and singing happy birthday, it's much more than this but they don't have it in this restaurant. I am very disappointed in he service and attitude"
Parvez K.,"Herndon, VA",233,95,165,4.0,12/8/2010,"Definitely one of the premier restaurant chains in the area.  If you have not been here, you must try it! The food is prepared well, the desserts are out of this world, and the full waiter service is (almost) always professional.  My only gripe this time around was that it took a bit for the maitre'd to seat us, and our server made us wait for several minutes in between checks.  We were left wondering several times if she had forgotten about us. Other than that, a great experience as usual.  You must try!"
Abbey S.,"Washington, DC",266,21,11,1.0,1/9/2010,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!  The food was fine, the problem was the horrible service.  Mind you, I have been a server before, so I feel I am very understanding when it comes to servers and I have a lot of tolerance for  bad service. . . .you never know when someone is just having a bad day.  This experience, however, was definitely an exception to the rule.. ..  1. We were told we would have a 15 minute wait.  It turned into 30 minutes and people coming in after us were being sat. 2. Sat down at our table and we had to ask for our waiter.  He came over and we said, ""How are you?"", he said ""Busy"", took our drink orders and walked away. 3. We were in the restaurant at the end of the lunch rush, approx. 1:30pm.  I would say the restaurant was 1/2 full.  Our server finally took our orders 15 minutes after dropping off our drinks.  We then waited another 40 minutes to get our food! 4. Not only did we wait 40 minutes to get our food, only 3 meals were served out of our party of 4!  Our server never came back over to check on us to even notice that we didn't have one of our meals at our table.  We finally had to go ask for the manager. . . . 5.  The manager took another 10 minutes to come over to the table and then bumbled his way through excuses instead of just saying he was sorry.  After 10 minutes of listening to his only concern being that ""we want you to eat, can I get a meal for you"" of which at this point, the rest of us were done with our meals.  The missing meal was not our concern at this point in our lunch.  He FINALLY ended up saying that he would take care of the meal.  We weren't sure if he was just taking care of the meal that didn't come out or our whole meal but we figured we would know  when our server came back with the check or said the meal was on him. 6. NO ONE EVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE AFTER THAT!!!    We waited another 10 minutes, asked for our server again to see if we had a bill and he never came back to our table!!!  We ended up just walking out of the restaurant. I recommend that if you go to this restaurant, that you do not go during a busy time and if you have a problem, avoid management, as they will not make the situation any better for you.  GOOD LUCK IF YOU DINE HERE!  The food is good, but you might not get your meal!"
Frank K.,"Culpeper, VA",37,17,2,1.0,3/28/2012,"I have been to this cheesecake factory 5 times in the past 6 months and the service was horrible all 5 times. This last time was the worst ever, it took more than 1 hour to receive my entree to get the chicken alfredo. When I did receive my plate, it wasn't hot (luke warm), the chicken was dry, and the pasta was overcooked. Very disappointed."
Jen T.,"Destin, FL",15,88,169,3.0,6/22/2014,"Cheesecake Factory brings me back to my teenage years when my sister and I would eat at the Chevy Chase location at least once a week. We loved the big salad and the pasta. We always end with sharing a dessert- I'm not a fan of cheesecakes so I preferred the mocha chocolate crunch cake. 20+ years later, I think the quality and the hype has definitely declined. BF and I met my mom at the Galleria Cheesecake Factory for Saturday lunch. Drinks (just two Cokes and 3 waters) took over 10 minutes. A little annoyed since I was thirsty. Their bread ( sourdough and a dark oat wheat?) is still delicious. We ate the entire basket in 10 minutes. I ordered the grilled chicken this tostada salad from their lightened menu (Skinnylicious ), mom had the lunch miso salmon, and BF got the chicken Alfredo (dinner  portion so that he could the the rest home for leftovers). We were surprised that his dinner portion was not usual of Cheesecake Factory humungous notoriety. He gift his pasta first and 3 minutes later the rest of our meals came to the table. Not a big deal but it's usually not preferred to gave our entrees not to arrive at the same time. My salad was good but I had a hard time finding the chicken which only had a few chunks underneath the mound of shredded romaine lettuce. My mom's salmon looked good atop brown rice and creamy miso sauce on the bottom. We wish their menu was not a book since it just complicates decision making and the restaurant chain has a difficult time to perfect the quality of each dish."
Jen M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",3,44,72,4.0,10/21/2012,"I came here for my friends 16th birthday dinner! Everything was fantastic! I got the hibachi steak and mash potatoes. My other friends got salmon, a sandwich and steak. The mashed potatoes were amazing!!  We really wanted to ask them if we can get a bucket of just the potatoes lol. Only thing was that WE HAD TO PAY FOR OUR OWN DAMN CHEESECAKE:) oh well. IT WAS STILL AMAZING!"
John D.,"Fairfax Station, VA",391,423,46,4.0,10/19/2010,"I get their Navajo for lunch, and add bacon. I mean, it's chicken, avocado, and bacon essentially wrapped in donut bread. What's not to like? Their service is usually decent, but you can wait 30 minutes for your order during lunch. I've only had one bad experience here, where a waitress totally forgot about us. No bread, no water refills, and a horrible attitude. Management resolved the issue promptly, but it was embarrassing for a business lunch. Other than that it's been good."
Lily R.,"McLean, VA",205,14,14,5.0,2/21/2014,I love the Tyson's Corner Cheesecake Factory hey have amazing customer service ... They are also very attentive with all their guest and have AMAZING avocado egg rolls
vanessa g.,"Washington, DC",54,201,75,1.0,12/6/2011,"Ugh, I am a cheesecake factory fan but not of this location. I have been here 3 times & every time the service is horrendous & the food is either poor quality or cold by the time i receive it. I ordered a salad & the spinach leaves were starting to rot at the egdes, can you say contaminated food? Nothing on that salad appeared fresh so i sent it away. The Teriyaki pops were sludged in what was a poor excuse for Teriyaki sauce and the chicken was rubbery & chewy, obviously microwaved.  The service was so slow (the restaurant wasn't packed either), I could have butchered the chicken, defeathered it and cooked it with all the fixins faster than this place could bring the meal. No apologies, no explanations, just downright horrible service. I don't ever 'not tip', but the second time I did. The cheesecake I ordered was partly frozen in the center, I was ready to just call it quits, i'm never coming back here again. The one is Dulles is way better."
