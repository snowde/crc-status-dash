J. K. M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,20,,1.0,1/23/2012,"Horrid food POISONING...lasted three very long days. We believe it was from the 'home made' new england clam chowder. When we called to complain the next day the management gave the impression of doing their due diligence but did not accept responsibility or comp the meal and then tried to place it back on us...that it must have been some other place the two of us ate at earlier that day, of which there is none. UNACCEPTABLE."
Fenny L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",731,1062,490,4.0,8/13/2009,"So we all know how much I absolutely hate meglo-congolmerate chain restaurants - even vaguely upscale chains that serve delicious chocolate raspberry cheesecake...so at best, Cheesecake Factory can only hope for 3 stars.  But then...they did the one thing guaranteed to get an extra star, and a huge 30% tip. They carded me.   OK, if you're a guy...or is still in your early 20's, you have no idea why this is a big deal.  But let's just say that the last time I was carded, everyone was worried about the Y2K bug. So imagine having a tragically sucky day at work...then dragging your butt to Cheesecake Factory for a networking function.  You head to the bar and wonder if it would make a bad impression on your industry peers if you asked the bartender to just stick a straw into that bottle of Johnny Walker Black...when the bartender asks to see your ID.  In complete seriousness...and with a little suspicion in his eyes as if he's wise to your fake ID ways. YES!  Suddenly, the skies opened up, the sun came out, and I was again my fun, energetic, semi-witty self.  HURRAH! For anyone who has not eaten at Cheesecake Factory before, the food is decent.  It's not exceptionally good (they tend to over-season the meat dishes, and drown their salads in dressing), but it's not bad either.  The food is decent, and the portions are *HUGE*.  One great thing about evil-chain restaurants is that if you've been to one, you can basically expect the same quality of food everywhere and CF is habitually solid.  I must admit that there is a certain amount of comfort in having that type of predictability.  Also, while I've had better cheesecake at many other places, I do adore the large slices and the nice wide variety in flavors. So in a nutshell, it's a Cheesecake Factory like all other Cheesecake Factories...but they have a suspicious bar-staff that makes for a GREAT pick-me-up when you're feeling blue and low and not quite as young and peppy as you once were.  Heh."
Stephanie G.,"Arlington, VA",3,29,1,1.0,9/14/2012,I have learned from past experiences to avoid any cheesecake factory restaurant. On this occasion I went against my better judgement and went to this location with a friend for lunch. Things that went wrong: -The cobb salad I ordered was basically a huge pile of lettuce with a quarter of an avocado and some small crumbles of bacon -The waiter gave my friend the wrong drink refill -The waiter gave my friend the wrong order (he ordered fish tacos and received fish and chips) -15 minutes later the waiter brought the correct order. The fish tacos were AWFUL. The fish was disguising. The fish I bit into was grey and hard. -The waiter charged me for the dinner salad when I ordered the lunch salad (he corrected the charge after I pointed it out to him) -He didn't give us any sort of discount for messing up the order and extending our lunch by an extra half hour. There are so many better places to eat at Tysons Galleria. Don't waste your time/money here.
David C.,"Austin, TX",0,65,1,4.0,8/14/2012,Love this place! Had the Mediterranean mahi mahi but switched out for lightly seared tuna instead.  Sooo... tasty!!  This place remains great year after year!
Meow- H.,"Herndon, VA",0,2,,3.0,10/1/2014,"We went to this cheesefactory on my birthday, I ordered Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta and Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad, the salad was just OK and pasta was too greasy; my husband's Louisiana Chicken was even worse, greasy and salty. Price is good with big potion of food, however it is not very healthy eating."
Harry R.,"Falls Church, VA",51,115,,3.0,10/2/2010,"Never thought I would ever say it, but ""great meal at the Cheescake Factory."" Arrived and the line was 30-deep to the hostess.  Ended up finding two at the bar to avoid the cue.  Best call ever. The three behind the bar turned in great service.  Like having friendly staff at your table the whole meal, but instead of staring at you waiting to pull an empty plate, they have stuff to do.  TV with the end of the Tech v. NCState game above my head, and a great black tea on ice to start things off. Apps came quick and had taste.  Beets & goat cheese with arugula looked like a large garden, and the crab & artichoke dip was better than I expected. Grilled fish tacos were clean and with the addition of mango salsa were actually quite tasty.  The Thai chicken wraps were nice and the portion size was big enough to keep me away from popcorn at the movie. Not that I'm angling to get back, but if I find myself stepping off the elevator again, I am just walking right past the hostess and to the bar."
Andy D.,"Annandale, VA",0,5,,4.0,4/18/2011,"The service is pretty good and carry out does take a little longer than usual( depending on the day that your going). I usually do carry out but once in a while I would pop in with a few friends for dinner. Overall my experience with this Cheesecake factory is always a positive one. However I do see people complain a lot while waiting at the pick up area just so they can get a free slice (or another) of cheesecake, which I think is ridiculous and dumb. So give it a try and you won't be disappointment."
Nina S.,"Atlanta, GA",6,69,16,4.0,7/28/2012,"Good atmosphere and fun food, bothy my husband and I enjoy it each time."
J. S.,"Capitol Heights, MD",2,2,,5.0,7/31/2014,"Food was great, service was great as I stopped through to wait traffic out. Happy Hour was pretty inexpensive in my opinion. I wasn't going to post how well my visit was so I sent an email on the website just to let them know how my experience went. I got a call back from one of the mgrs to express how happy he was for the feedback and appreciated my patronage. That's what pushed me to write this review. Karissa, thank you for the great service. I will return with my wife so she can enjoy the same great experience I had."
J P A.,"Annandale, VA",41,10,3,2.0,2/18/2011,"First off let me start by saying that this place used to be one of my favorite places to go out to eat. However, over the past few years it just keeps getting worst and worst! I kept going back and hoping that it'll finally get back to where they started but it never happened.  The last time I was there (November 2010) I was so disappointed in my diner entree and even more in my wife's Salmon entree! The Salmon tasted as if it was a frozen piece of Salmon that they cooked in the microwave and served it to you! No seasoning what so ever, no taste, no flavor and very dry!  Their appetizers are hit or miss as well. You just never know how the food will come out! Even the bread has been horrible the last couple of times I've been there.  The positive is their Cheesecake, it's about the only thing worth buying and eating from there. Now I only do cheesecake carryout from them."
Kevin L.,"Alexandria, VA",18,19,,4.0,10/14/2013,The worst thing about this place is never the price of admission its how long you have to wait in line on top of that add that up with order preparation the staff though they're terribly busy usually are cool another plus the food is top notch here the cheesecake is so good its almost sexually erupting to your tastebuds I'm pretty sure we all know what food pornography tastes and feels like I recommend the oreo or red velvet cheesecake
Chris N.,"Fairfax, VA",0,34,,3.0,11/14/2011,"Lunch on a Saturday... wasn't expecting too much. I would not say it was all too busy, either. We were seated promptly, the waiter(s) were patient with us as our party was waiting on others to arrive. Orders came in promptly...all seemed good. But... why was it so hard to get a refill to my coffee? No joke...they must have had a dozen employees swarming the place (waiters and supervisors...or whoever they are), and I had to ask three of them ""Can I get a refill?"" They all answer ""yes"" but never follow up. I catch their attention repeatedly in some cases, pointing to my coffee mug, and they sort of hand signal an apology and say they'll be right with me. Finally, after 20 mins of flagging down employees, the original waiter comes up and asks, ""How are you guys doing? Can I get you a refill for your coffee?"" Ummm....yes, like 20 mins ago. More apologies followed and finally get my refill.  Other than that....just a run of the mill restaurant experience; nothing impressive or bad. I won't hold that ""can't get a refill"" incident against them too much... things like that happen everywhere. But for a restaurant that considers itself above standards compared to average family restaurant chains, something like that should not have happened."
Nicole R.,"Sebastian, FL",155,148,7,3.0,6/18/2009,"My mom took my sister and I here yesterday for lunch. Cheesecake Factory is always fine - service is always fine, food is always fine, but I feel like it's one of those places where I always look forward to going, then am not as impressed when I leave. This time, I had the Giant Burrito.  I don't know what it's called but it's Giant, so that's what I'm going to call it.  It comes on an oval plate... and the thing itself is about a foot long (not kidding) smothered in this yummy sauce (I have no godly idea what it was) and pico de gallo.  It came with a side dish of sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole (the guac was really good). Inside, it had chicken, onions, rice, peppers, and I don't know what else; but I asked for no beans (can't stand em).   It was good.  Definitely nowhere near El Paso-caliber burritos, but for not being a Mexican place, it was definitely decent.  Where it lacked in flavor, it compensated with sheer size... ha! In the past, I've gotten the lettuce wraps (they're an appetizer but they make a great meal) and they're great.  I've also gotten the Thai Chicken Pasta which is always satisfying and really good.  Last time boyfriend went, he got the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp - but when I saw it at the restaurant yesterday (someone at the next table got it), it didn't look that impressive... almost icky-looking, so I went with the Burrito and I think I'm glad. My gripe about Cheesecake Factory:  The menu is a freakin' novel.  What am I supposed to do with 150 pages of drinks, appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts?!  It's so overwhelming that I usually stick to the same few things and don't venture because that menu stresses me out! Overall, service is decent, food is good, and you're probably not going to get better cheesecake anywhere around here... so, I'd go back. PS - The Burrito was overpriced at $14... they're $9.99 at El Paso and 100x better."
Cheryl B.,"Round Hill, VA",119,241,188,2.0,2/27/2009,"My apologies to those readers who love this place but its not on my list of favs....it was a convenient meeting place for a business lunch today.  The menu is just too over the top...you can do great food without a 15 page book of selections.  You cannot convince me however that everything is done fresh...for I fear #10 cans and frozen items are totally involved! I ran late...that darn lengthy drive from Western Loudoun County.  So my party had settled in with tea, water, diet coke and an order of artichoke spinach dip/chips.  It was ok, but seriously not home made. We ordered the chicken enchiladas and crispy chicken dish that was a dead ringer for sesame chicken.  I swear the serving of rice was moulded in a soup bowl so had to be at least a 1+ cup serving.  More doesn't equal better. The tastes overall were acceptable, but the black beans were dried out and the cilantro rice was not flavorful as I expected.   We didn't bother with dessert.   For me Cheesecake Factory is above the trough-food quality of an all you can eat buffet, but the mechanics behind it feels strangely synergistic around that type of delivery.  I say offer fewer options to allow for more attention to quality.  The service today was spot on, which is a hit or miss most of the time.   My joy today was that the meeting was outstanding!!!"
L F.,"Fairfax, VA",15,84,8,4.0,7/21/2009,"People are not exaggerating when they say the portions are huge! It took a while to figure out what we wanted because the menu can be dizzying (I don't mind that they have so much selection, though. More for me to try!). It's pretty noisy too, children shrieking and whatnot (the one next to us got a hold of a spoon and banged out some music for a while...lol) so don't go there if you're sensitive to that kind of stuff. I got The Navajo, which was grilled chicken with avocado, lettuce, and tomato on fry bread. I had already gotten a bit full off the yummy bread and butter so I barely ate a fourth of my sandwich. The boyfriend got the Ribeye and it was delicious! Tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection. It was huge but it should be, for $30, right? I have to admit my sandwich was a little bland, so I won't order it again. But our server was great, and I actually liked the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple we got to go, and I'm not even a fan of peanut butter. From reading the reviews, it looks like I should try the Louisiana Chicken Pasta next. I can't wait to go back."
Brenda D.,"Arlington, VA",156,222,163,3.0,11/13/2011,"Come here if you have a big appetite. You will never leave here hungry because the portions are just humongous! The food itself is alright, although I would not recommend getting any Chinese dishes. Their cheesecakes are a little expensive, $7-8 for one slice but it is big enough to share between 2-3 people. My personal favorite is the white chocolate raspberry truffle...yum!"
Alicia R.,"Vienna, VA",35,158,3,4.0,3/23/2009,"This place is awesome. Who are these cats hatin'?  Lots of selection, if that's hard for you head for the hills. Turn back now. I personally love a huge menu because that's more food for me to try.  I love the 4 cheese pasta and ESPECIALLY the Louisiana Chicken. Spicy and amazing. Huge portions here.  The prices really aren't bad. It's not a place to hit up every day but it's not that expensive especially if you go for lunch. You get a huge portion of high quality ingredients for 10-14 bucks. Really? That's awful? Come on.  The food is healthy if you want it to be or full of rich cream if you're like me and go to the gym to eat more. :P  The cheesecake here is off the chain. If you don't speak tween that means it's absolutely delicious and very rich. Big too! Point being, this place is delicious, just kinda loud. They also do not take reservations UNLESS! Your party is over 8? or was it 14? Something like that."
L O.,"Avon, OH",1,91,5,3.0,5/30/2013,"We usually dine at the Cheesecake Factory in Sterling, and are a fan.  We dined at this Cheesecake Factory this past weekend, and to our surprise dishes that we've ordered previously at Sterling were very different at this location, and I hate to say not as good.  I can't say it was terrible, just not as good as the Sterling location.  Parking can be a pain too."
Greg S.,"Burke, VA",10,43,2,4.0,8/11/2009,"I seriously do not know what other reviewers found wrong with the place. I personally never reduce or increase ratings based on my waiter's behavior. You are there for the food, and that is what you are paying for.  I am a foodie, so it is very difficult to impress me.  Yes, their portions are outrageous. I think it is a great waste of food, really. Please Cheesecake Factory, do not contribute to our obesity problem here in the US of A. Yes, their menus are outrageous. It is difficult to navigate. You do not need a million entries on the menu.  Yet, their food is consistent in their quality and taste - it is pretty good. I cannot attest to all of their menu, but what we did try was very good. Avocado rolls - yum Endive, Pecan and Blue Cheese salad - great Burgers - great Spicy Cashew Chicken - yum Chicken Madeira - yum Carbonara Pasta - good Pasta Bolognese - good, of course I make it better :-) Their cheesecakes are the freshest and most amazing cheesecakes I have ever had. They must be, for the place is called Cheesecake Factory! Of course, this is a chain, but this particular location always was consistent in the food quality."
Leanna A.,"Falls Church, VA",2,50,,4.0,2/5/2014,"It is beautiful inside, somehwat congested and there is not a lot of room to move around but it is one of the prettier Cheescake factories for sure. The food is consistently good. I always know what to expect when I come here. The servers are always great and quick. The portions are HUGE! I have never been able to finish my food here. The prices are reasonable considering there are two meals in one portion."
