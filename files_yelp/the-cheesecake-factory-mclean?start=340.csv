Diana N.,"NY, NY",73,646,,2.0,2/7/2009,"I have never been a fan of Cheesecake Factory...and our waiter didn't do a very good job either... To start it off...he assumed my coworkers and I were underage (we're between 22-28 years of age) and so the drinks he offered us consisted of coke and iced tea.  Hahah.  Fine.  We get that a lot.   We ordered various dishes and the food was eh-okay.  Nothing spectacular, and the portions are HUGE.  A big waste of food.  I've decided that I don't like any places that have oversized portions.  The only one from our group who enjoyed his meal was my coworker who ordered breakfast for dinner.   At the end, we decided to share one piece of cheesecake - something with peanut butter and chocolate.  It was not that great.  I wasn't impressed.   The only thing I like is the bread."
Tiff B.,"Herndon, VA",59,68,12,3.0,12/20/2011,"Great service and quick to remedy issues with orders (i.e., missing bacon on a sandwich, missing side of ranch, etc.).  Had the Navajo sandwich and must say I wasn't impressed despite all the rave reviews.  It was too much of a one note flavor for me and needed more of a kick (either with a chipotle-mayo or some type of tang).  Adam's Peanut Butter Cup cheesecake was great (as always), but wish they would bring back the Honey Vanilla Chai Tea Latte.  I loved that drink!"
Natalie B.,"Falls Church, VA",8,16,,5.0,3/30/2014,Love the place. Food is good. The cheese cake is yummy.
Amanda B.,"Carmel, IN",15,208,,4.0,1/12/2009,"I have been to this restaurant at least ten times and I have never been disappointed. Their menu is extensive and they will honor substitution requests. Great for picky eaters! Wait staff has always been very friendly, but service is not always lightning fast. Considering how busy this place always is, you cannot really expect the waiter to be at your beck and call.  Personally, I love their sliders and nachos appetizer. The cheesecake, of course, is always delicious. The bartenders in the bar are heavy pourers and that is always appreciated as well.  It can be loud in this place and the wait can be long for a table, but it is well worth it each and every time."
Alexandra M.,"Charlotte, NC",41,266,11,4.0,12/4/2008,"like i have said in previous reviews, i am not one to review about chain restaurants or the like unless i must warn the publics or tell them to come. i am a fan of the cheesecake factory in general, but i think this has to be my favorite location. i hate going on weekends or early afternoon because i dont usually think its THAT worth the wait, but then i sit down, take one look at the menu and remember that it is. however, the day that they finally take reservations i will be completely ecstatic. i dont know if its me, but the service usually always seems to be lacking no matter if youre at the cheesecake factory in dulles, providence, fairoaks, or tysons (the 4 that i have been to). well, we went just the other day for a late lunch around 4. our waitress was one of the nicest people, she was very attentive and let us be when we needed to be and was just very personable. probably the BIGGEST problem with the cheesecake factory is the seating. i dont know/cant remember if they have the chair/table/long bench seating at this location but at the other 3 locations there has been numerous occasions where i am sitting so close to the other person i become tempted to ask them what they bought at the mall or what perfume they are wearing. REQUEST A BOOTH, every time. we even lied and said we were a party of 3 one time in hopes that we didnt have to sit in those God-awful chairs. my boyfriend and i usually try to order something different everytime we go.  this specific time they had the BAR MENU/SMALL PLATES. genius. it is genius.  i dont remember seeing one plate on the bar menu that was over $5. we order the small plate of potstickers (4 for $2.95) and the small chopped salad (a staple). in addition we ordered the buffalo blasts, if you go, get them, they are an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth.  we also tried the japanese vegetable and blue cheese pizza. we have never had their pizza and we were definitely surprised. we NEVER come to the cheescake factory and not get cheesecake. i dont care if im on a diet or not (which i usually 'try' to be but who am i kidding?) we got the peanut butter ripple to go. i figure its not as bad if we split it...right? some of my favorite dishes: -chopped salad -chicken madeira -fried mac & cheese (app) -buffalo blasts (app) -sesame chicken -factory nachos (app BUT HUGE and definitely enough for dinner) my favorite cheesecake is the banana as well as the apple pie cheesecake. the greatest thing about the cheesecake factory is you always leave full and have food for a midnight munchie or two."
John K.,"Rockville, MD",242,658,133,3.0,9/4/2008,"Cheesecake Factory has decent food.  Although the menu can be daunting, most of the meals I see the waiters carry are big portions and  ""look"" pretty appetizing. I recommend the Louisiana Bow Tie Chicken Pasta or the Thai Lettuce Wraps. Sometimes the wait is too much for an over-hyped chain.  But what can you do?  People love their cheesecake (but I don't)."
Sorina T.,"Falls Church, VA",3,19,,3.0,12/28/2008,"I love their Louisiana Chicken Pasta! I used to work in Tysons Galleria, and my co-worker went and ordered that pasta and I had a bite of it & i fell in love. I'm a really picky eater, and this was a really tasty pasta! It became one of my favorite dishes that I like to order here!  Their service is pretty decent. It kind of depends on who your server is. I think that when my friends and I went there for a birthday, we had the best server. She was very nice & helpful. But when we (the same group of friends) went for a christmas dinner, this guy was our server and his attitude was just kind of bad. He was giving us a hard time and we were just asking for cream for the coffee or to order drinks.  Overall their food is delicious! Service I believe depends on the person that is serving you."
Cameron B.,"Washington, DC",1,54,2,1.0,1/6/2011,"Hour long wait, and hair in the pasta.  'nuff said."
Sean L.,"McLean, VA",15,49,85,4.0,10/31/2011,"Good as usual, like the new cheese cake flavor!"
Be Z.,"Houston, TX",2,46,,1.0,7/3/2011,"overpriced, very mediocre food.  Go to TGIFs, it's a lot less than you'll pay here, but same food. Terrible service, so dark you can hardly read the menu, much less see what you're eating."
Bryant Z.,"McLean, VA",27,65,29,4.0,8/3/2008,"If you dig through my other reviews, you'll see a trend: I love burgers. So I got this location's ""Tons of Fun"" burger (as I do with their other locations if I don't get their [perpetual] fish of the day). I wasn't surprised when this burger wasn't well done. However, the lighting in the restaurant, as with all of TCF's other locations, was dark and rather serene. I had to crack out my LED torch to confirm what my taste buds had suspected: The burger was rare. So I sent it back. Our European transfer-student-of-a-waitress was very sweet and promptly took the meal back. Literally within less than a minute's time, the location's manager came to me and profusely apologized for the error, followed by asking what I would like them to do to make up for the mistake. I insisted that they do what's most convenient for them, which would have been to finish cooking the burger (as it is at other locations). Instead, they brought a brand new burger, added a full dish of fries to what I had left (half of the original dish), and gave me a free dessert! Something tells me if a bunch of you try this on purpose, they won't do it again, so please don't spoil it for those of us who actually do have to recover from a misconfigured order. Yes, I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to the other people reading this review; I'm talking *directly* to you. Don't assume that others will listen to me, thus leaving you free to copy what I did, because that's not how it works. You need to listen: don't rip customer service off. It ruins the restaurant for everyone. Anyway, I'd give them a two had it not been for the exemplary customer service. 4 from me."
Thao N.,"Fairfax, VA",107,66,102,3.0,6/27/2008,"I never know what to get here at Cheesecake Factory since I'm not a fan of what they have like pastas and stuff. Recently, I have found one dish that I will stick to getting every time, and that would be the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad (I uploaded it to the gallery above)! It is just delightful! It's the closest to sushi you could get at Cheesecake Factory. The tuna is perfectly seasoned and the wasabi vinaigrette just completes the whole dish. It's also probably one of the healthier dishes here! Definitely, try it! The service at this location is pretty bizarre. I mean, the waiter was nice and very prompt, but confused the heck out of me! So I placed my order for the salad and a few moment later the manager came back to my table to tell me that the tuna is not ready yet and won't be prepared for another 20 minutes but I didn't mind because I was there already so might as well wait. A few moments later another manager came back to tell me that they don't have tuna at all that day, and gave me the menu to look at again...so I was like, okay nevermind I don't want anything because I don't like anything else there.  A few moments later again that same manager came back and said that they do have tuna and it won't be ready for another 10 minutes...okay I hoped that that would be the final time they come to deliver bad news.......So then it came out, about 10 minutes later, and it was delicious! Worth the wait and all. When the bill came, they didn't charge me the salad because it took them so long to make it!!  All in all, good salad and good but confusing service (at least for that day)."
Amin A.,"Rockville, MD",1,17,,2.0,10/1/2013,"I've generally had good experiences here, but the last time I visited I came in a medium sized group for a birthday brunch. The service was a bit slow but the food was still as good as it always have been. The only real downside was when we asked for something for the birthday boy. You usually get ice cream or some treat, right? They sprayed whipped cream on a small plate, threw a few sprinkles on it and brought it out. It's certainly not the most important part of the meal but it was a disappointing way to conclude a birthday celebration, especially when the restaurant specializes in a certain dessert."
Alexandar I.,"Fairfax, VA",2,48,,3.0,7/18/2011,"It's a cheesecake factory. We all know what it is, we all know the menu is a Novel, we know the proportions could feed an entire family. Went here for lunch with about 12 other coworkers. Avocado Egg rolls are something you MUST try if you are here. I had the grilled Mahi Mahi with brown rice and broccoli which was great. The Mahi Mahi was perfectly seasoned and grilled, it was a bit dry but I honestly had no problem with it. After all, fish is not the juiciest meat. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 is because the service was terribly slow. Now given it was busy and we had a large group, a lunch should not take two hours. The restaurant should know that because of their location (office buildings around), lunch time will get busy during the week and need to plan accordingly. But overall, not a bad experience."
Shannon R.,"Reston, VA",5,18,1,5.0,11/6/2010,"I've been here twice in the last week and loved it both times, service is excellent, appetizers and entrees were all delicious and the 3 cheesecakes I had were heven. Absolutely recommend this location to anyone!"
Ateet A.,"Arlington, VA",249,133,19,3.0,3/23/2011,"This should be truly a three and a half stars. Service was amazing, probably the best service in a very long time. We had ordered the infamous Tex Mex egg rolls for apps and they were good. I ordered the Cajun jambalaya and she ordered the tuna Tataki salad. The pasta was good but there was a bunch of pasta that was still in a ball and hadn't broken up yet which is not good but otherwise it had nice flavor. The tuna Tataki salad was tasty as well. Tried the reeses cheesecake and it was delicious! So happy that I listened to the waiter! Great experience"
Kristy C.,"Fairfax, VA",39,4,,1.0,9/4/2011,"To me, the taste of food at the Cheesecake Factory is inconsistent. There are times when it is extremely salty and there are times when it taste okay. But I've never had a meal at the cheesecake factory and thought it was REALLY GOOD. It was, at best, slightly above average. My mom, grandma, aunt, cousin and my sister (six of us) went to have dinner.  We had a large lunch so we ordered five dishes and shared. We had the Luau Salad, Chicken Madeira, Herb Crusted Salmon (from their ""skinny"" selection), Da Vinci Pasta and Fettuccine with Sundried Tomatoes. Out of all the dishes we ordered, my favorite was the chicken madeira. But I think it's pretty hard to screw up a dish with broiled chicken and cheese, asparagus and mashed potatoes. The herb crusted salmon tasted no different from what i make it home and the two pastas were slightly overcooked. The worst part was that not all of our dishes came out at the same time.  My sister (who ordered the fettuccine)'s dish came out later and at that point the rest of us were almost done with our entrees. All in all, i don't think the cheesecake factory has the best food nor the best atmosphere (i think it's too loud). But i know I'd probably go back because it is an easy pick after a long day at Tyson's!"
Jane B.,"Arlington, VA",1,11,,4.0,3/6/2012,"I have been to this location at Tysons a few times. The last time i went here was in September 2011 with my mom and my friend. We went because my friend turned 30 years old and we wanted to have a nice meal. We also had Cheesecake for dessert. Overall, all 3 of us enjoyed our meal and cheesecake. :-)"
Rissa C.,"Alexandria, VA",39,69,,2.0,6/2/2010,"Im really sick of Cheesecake Factory thats all I have to say. Oh, they give u so much food and it just makes me lose my appetite."
Kimberly K.,"Alexandria, VA",11,6,8,5.0,9/16/2010,"Cheesecake Factory is my very favorite restaurant. I come here when I ""really"" want good food. I always get the Miso Salmon. When we go in couples groups, oddly enough, most of our party also orders the Miso Salmon. My recommendation, their food is great, portions sizes are excellent- if you love salmon, you CAN'T go wrong with the Miso Salmon."
