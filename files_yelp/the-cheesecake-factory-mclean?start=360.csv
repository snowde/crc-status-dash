Luisita S.,"Frederick, MD",6,56,,1.0,7/5/2011,"I used to love Cheesecake Factory but there is something seriously wrong with the one at Tysons. I got there late, around 10 but they do stay open to 11.  Waitress was rude and actually rolled her eyes when I had a question.   Food was awful.  Quality has gone downhill big time.  My seared ahi appetizer had a thick hard crust and seemed stale like it was sitting around.  Don't get the fried artichokes--it's covered in a think mozzarella stick breading.  It was like something you could buy at Sam's Club. Atmosphere was unpleasant--very dark with LOUD Beyonce-type thumping music.   Finally to top it off the waitress came to the table at 11 and told us that they were closing and we needed to pay our bill. I was shocked--TCF used to be the best chain restaurant.  Now I'd put it at the bottom."
Victor G.,"Pierson, FL",5,243,91,4.0,4/20/2013,I took my wife here for our fourth wedding anniversary and I am very glad that I did. First off you get free valet parking which is a plus because you can not find parking for anything in this area especially at the malls. Well anyways the reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because the location is poorly advertised and I had to search for it. But anyways onto the actual restaurant. When we showed up we were able to be seated right away which I was surprised with because every one I have ever been to has been at least a 45 min wait. But anyways our server was pretty nice and very attentive and did not give us any problems with the fact that i drink so much soda that she had to refill all the time. The food was very fresh and came out quickly with no issues. We ordered the avocado rolls which were AMAZING and then I ordered a Shepard  pie which was sooooo good. For desert we had the carrot cake Cheesecake because our wedding cake was cheesecake and this one was amazing! I was also very happy with the price overall because in the DC area I always plan to pay alot and for our dinner it was relatively cheap. I will be back to this one!
Mr H.,"Vienna, VA",1,33,3,3.0,6/18/2011,Standard chain restaurant. Enormous portions. Good value for the dollar.
Jack S.,"Washington, DC",5,165,,2.0,2/24/2011,"It's difficult for a self-proclaimed food snob to review a chain like this.  It isn't real food, it's crud.  Tastes fine... but that's what a bunch of artificial colors and preservatives make food taste like.  If you like chains, you'll like this place."
myung k.,"Annandale, VA",47,43,9,3.0,5/14/2008,"I've been visiting this restaurant every once in a while ever since I was in high school. Usually with my family. First of all, that bread they give you in the beginning is pretty damn good! I like how the restaurant is set up to look like. It's nice to see the cooks/chefs preparing the food (although you need to be tall enough to see what they're actually doing). The restuarant is set up pretty dark, along with a bar section on the inside. Usually always busy so you'll probably have to wait. The food itself is pretty good. The Thai pasta was surprisingly delightful. I thought it would be some watered down, sweet dish but it was actually good. The BBQ rib meat literally melts off the bone, another good dish.  funny thing is I barely ever get the cheesecake here.  This is a nice restaurant, come for some decent ambience/food/good time"
Beth G.,"McLean, VA",0,44,7,4.0,4/29/2011,The lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious. I had the portobello burger last time and it was one of the better ones I've had at restaurants (Lucille's is still the best).
Aaron E.,"McLean, VA",53,98,,1.0,11/30/2005,"Maybe I could rate the damn place, but their lines are so long I never get in. Maybe one day I will eat here.  Message to Cheesecake Factory: I Hate You Cheesecake Factory. Take reservations."
Rob C.,"Ashburn, VA",75,41,7,2.0,8/2/2006,"Their cheesecake saves it from a one-star review. Their massive selection of cheesecakes which are quite good are the only saving grace for this crowded, overrated restaurant. Their menu is overchoice and everything tastes manufactured and the same even though their ethnic food choices range from asian-italian-mexican-american. The service is slow because they over-seat and then can't keep up in the kitchen. Finally try getting a table on any weeknight or weekend. Impossible. They need to find a better way to get ppl seated or soon the masses will realize that it's not worth waiting 90 minutes for a piece of cheesecake because the food itself tastes like crap."
John L.,"Austin, TX",34,104,9,2.0,7/20/2008,"We use to go here all the time down in Boca Raton, FL and always had a good meal.  My wife always get the miso salmon over rice so since we were shopping, we decided to have lunch.  Although my wife asked for the salmon with just the miso sauce and not the cream sauce, our waiter misunderstood and put the cream sauce all over the rice.  So we asked for just the rice and it was so undercooked that it felt like bird seed. My burger was huge but had no flavor and I should say any good flavor for a burger.  Barely ate half of it. Guess I'll have to stick with the one down in FL."
Tigeristic T.,"Denver, CO",18,30,,3.0,2/23/2010,"I'd give this place a lower rating if I went for more than just a cheesecake. The service was pretty crappy, there were new life forms in my water and ofcourse it's cheesecake factory. Now I take the blame for actually resorting to this place, shoulvd've planned better...the tiramisa cheesecake was delicious though, the only save for the night. The elevator entrance was pretty cool though...okay, now I'm reaching...."
Jon L.,"Springfield, VA",0,1,,5.0,7/15/2013,"I have to say everything here at The Cheesecake Factory in Tyson's Galleria amazing and wonderful to the great service, staff, restaurant design, as well amazing food. So much food that I'd to take some home plus the cheesecake too. You won't regret coming here and come enjoy this phenomenal restaurant chain."
Eileen O.,"Alexandria, VA",24,187,,3.0,9/8/2007,"When going, I suggest planning to have happy hour followed by dinner - this solves the waiting in line problem. The mojitos at this location are amazing - and I'm pretty picky about my mojitos. When you go on a Friday night, there is one poor bartender who muddles the mint and sugar all night long. But it's worth the $8. The food isn't exceptional, but will last at lease 3 meals."
M M.,"Herndon, VA",0,30,1,2.0,8/3/2007,"Wow, they're slow and bad. For a restaurant of its size, there are surprisingly few tables.  The waits, outside of weekend nights, to be seated have cooled off a bit as they have built so many restaurants around here. However, once you sit down things go no more smoothly.  They have gotten my order completely wrong three times in a row.  Once they left the poached eggs out of the crab hash, and the dish looked like a big bowl of cold string crab and semi-cooked onions.  I can sorta understand the bad wait staff, but they have a mismanaged kitchen.  The basic attraction here must be the ridiculous portion sizes, because the food just doesn't cut it. If you need 2000 calories (fact!), stop by the takeout counter for a single slice of cheesecake, otherwise go to any other restaurant first."
Sharif N.,"Washington, DC",53,154,,4.0,7/12/2010,"I m a big fan of the cheescake factory although I have been going to it for over 12 years now.  The first one in this AREA was opened in the Bethesda/Rockville area.  The food is still really good, and my favorite dish is the Cajun Jambalya Pasta and the Green Chile Burger!!  Appetizers are great, try the Thai Lettuce wraps or the Tex Mex eggrolls. For desert you cant go wrong with any of the cheescakes, my favorite is the: Godiva® Chocolate Cheesecake"
Cory L.,"Reston, VA",3,147,5,1.0,8/5/2010,"This is one of the few chain establishments I like going to.  Dont get me wrong, lots of hits..lots of misses.....however, over the past two years, ive been a fan of their Kobe burger and my wife the fan of the Cobb salad.  I always order the Kobe burger.  Ive not had a problem with it before, until yesterday.  My in-law was in town and I took the family there after some shopping. I ordered two Kobe burgers for myself and my inlaw.  Both burgers came out BURNT.  Im not talking some black here and there..im talking BLACK all the way around, andnot thin surface im taliking meteorite dense.  I attempted to remove the blackness from the bun....after I did that, I was ready to eat until my inlaw removed the toppings and there it was..a DARK hard surface of Cancerous surface sponge.  It ws disgusting.  I asked the waiter to remove both of them, asked why I said cause its burnt.  He said ok and took them away.  The server didint apologize (he seemed new, maybe nervbous).  MInutes later the Manager comes and apologizes, didint offer to cover the remainder of our food (lemondae, and one Cobb salad) after ruining our dinner (hard when you have a baby).  He asked if they could make us another one 9never reassured me tho)....im sure the guy in the kitchen would be thrilled to get another crack at the people who returned his/her food lol.  This is the FIRST time ive ever returned my food to the kitchen in the 36 yrs of my life.  Im very pattient and udnerstanding t a fault..thats how badly burnt the patty was.   You would think I would be reassured that it wont happen again..or that I would be asked how they can mitigate teh sitaution..I was just told to order another one and they will get that to me like they would any other order lol.  Not cool! (oh, and even the Cobb Salad was real bad, we notice this trend at this Cheesecake, the Dulles Town Center and Fairoaks seem consistent)."
Christina M.,"Boston, MA",9,45,2,3.0,5/5/2010,"This one is just like all the other ones I've been to, nothing spectacular."
Jassy M.,"Washington, DC",3,18,1,2.0,6/21/2009,"It was okay to say its in such a high end neighborhood. The waiter we had was really slow, he messed up 1 of the orders and he dropped the water. He forgot alot of stuff we asked for. I'm guessing it was to early for him are something because we attended the Sunday brunch.  Over all it was okay i've been to better ones..also some guy, guessing he was a cook are something, was a little dirty looking..that was a huge turn off.  The pineapple upside down cheesecake was to die for...I gotta give them that but i guess you can get that at all of them...lol"
Wes F.,"Potomac, MD",0,37,,4.0,6/23/2010,"The Cheesecake Factory is a great dining experience.  They have one of the largest menus I have every seen that hits upon several different cultures and flavors making every trip a unique experience (depending on what you get of course)... not to mention that the portions are overly generous.  Over the years I've ordered quite a few different things and I've never been disappointed.  Not only do they have a wide variety of options, but they are all well prepared.  They also have an overly nice and formal staff which has a high standard of customer service.  I've never had a complaint."
A B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,206,3,2.0,8/6/2009,"I can totally pass on this place. Went here tonight for a birthday dinner. Didn't want to eat too much or spend a lot of loot so I opted for an appetizer of the factory nachos. The plate was HUGE. And I'm a big believer in refried beans on my nachos, and those didn't exist. These nachos felt like they were missing something. The guacamole was really good, but everything else was just ""meh"". I should have asked for extra jalapenos. My mother said the same thing...the waiter asked if she could handle the chilis in her quesadilla and she said sure. She ended up not being able to taste them at all and was stealing jalapenos from my nachos for her quesadilla. Needless to say this place caters to the watered-down American chain restaurant standard as far as real food that doesn't involve sugar is concerned. I ended up skipping dessert because I had too many nachos. No cheesecake for me. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their dessert though. I definitely don't need to come back.  Oh, and yes, it takes like half an hour to go through the menu and find what you want. Partly because it's so long, partly because it's so darn dark inside of that place. I have 20/20 vision and was surprised at being able to read the menu."
Andy P.,"Vienna, VA",2,39,,2.0,12/27/2008,"I pretty much feel like I have to rate this place because I've been here either because I've had a giftcard or been dragged here so many times and have tried probably half of their huge menu. Frankly I kind of wonder why it's so popular. The Cheesecake really is a 5 but everything else is about a 2. Maybe I should bump up the rating since they do emphasize the best thing they have, but if they're going to function as a full service restaurant they should be rated that way. I won't waste time with a dish-by-dish. Basically they've got a huge menu that has a touch of just about everything that's popular -- burgers here, some pasta there, Chinese over there, some Mexican and BBQ tossed in, and so on. Whatever you get, you can be assured that it won't be baaad (pause), but it won't be really great either, it will certainly come in a huge, overpriced portion that you have no chance of eating by yourself. It's almost as though they feel like they have to justify their absurd prices by doubling or tripling their portions. That's particularly annoying since they're in mall and so if you're there, you're likely to have plans that don't include running home to throw your doggie bag in the fridge. Anyway, complaints aside, I have a few recommendations. 1) Just come for the cheesecake. It's kinda steep but it is very good, and Tyson's has lots of places to eat. 2) Come with enough people that you can split a couple appetizers and entres and share-- the tables aren't really laid out for that sort of thing, but the appetizers are pretty good and you'll still get plenty of food without having to overpay for a so-so meal. 3) As for actual dishes, my favorite so far is the shepard's pie, and they've got a couple salads that are pretty good. Their pastas are my least favorite bc they skimp on the meat. Service is decently standardized. It's never terrible but it's never great either. Not surprisingly they're slow at busy times, and they sometimes get flustered if you ask for anything out of the ordinary -- pretty standard for a large chain."
