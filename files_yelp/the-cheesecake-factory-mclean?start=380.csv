Danielle K.,"Washington, DC",58,157,2,2.0,6/25/2009,"i've always felt cheesecake factory was pretty mediocre, and just very overrated for what it is.  i first visited the Arlington location for my 21st birthday nearly four years ago, and walked away thinking, ""really?  this is what everyone raves about?  i've certainly had better.""  i've been back since once, and when my boyfriend's family decided to celebrate a birthday there, i figured third times a charm, right? i called ahead to attempt to make a reservation for ten people at 8pm on a wednesday evening.  i was told they don't take reservations, but would leave a note for the hostess.  of course, when we got there, there was no note, but they were able to slide tables together to accomodate our party. we ordered 2 plates of the avocado egg rolls in a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce and 1 plate of the spinach artichoke dip for appetizers.  the egg rolls were very good, but the spinach artichoke dip had barely any taste and had definitely been frozen at some point in time; not fresh.  they also give you bread and butter while you wait, but neither taste fresh at all. after waiting nearly 45 minutes from placing our food orders, a member of our party got up to complain about the long wait.  a manager came to our table and offered to buy each person a dessert of our choosing.  after waiting another 10 minutes, the waitress came back and explained that ours was ""a very large order.""  yes, it was ten entrees, but we had no substitutions and it really should not take a full hour to make ten entrees on a wednesday evening.   i had the four cheese pasta, which was good - but it's also something i could have made at home for $2 or so instead of ordering for $15.  it is a massive portion, and served me well for dinner that night as well as lunch the next day.  i also had a bite of the spicy chicken sandwich, which was pretty good.  one member of the party ordered the louisana chicken pasta, and seemed very pleased with it.  the rest were fish dishes which no body seemed excited about. to round it out, we did each order our desserts.  i had peanut butter cookie dough cheesecake, and really - my mom makes much better cheesecake.  also tried a bite of the 30th anniversary cake (which the waiter said they sell ""like nobody's business"").  it seemed too rich to me.   i don't think i'll be back soon - there are just too many other good restaurants in the area that exceed my expectations."
Phil P.,"Fairfax, VA",5,35,18,5.0,3/14/2010,God I love this plce they have amazing pasta and steaks and there mexican there has yet to be a dish I did not like from this plce
Global A.,"Washington, DC",1,30,,1.0,4/29/2011,Food is awfully bland. The tacos tasted like plastic and the pasta was watery with no flavor at all. It was so disappointing that we did not even order desserts. Service is friendly and orders were delivered promptly. Used to be it was a combination of good service and excellent food that drew me to visit this restaurant but not any more.
Mark D.,"Washington, DC",35,74,3,2.0,8/3/2007,"I've never been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, I think their menu is schizophrenic.  You'll have Chinese food on one page and Italian or Irish on another.  The problem is they don't do any of them really well so it all just ends up bad.  The only thing they have going for them is the cheesecake which is pretty good but overpriced."
Jay A.,"Washington, DC",29,67,65,4.0,4/30/2007,"Looking at other fellow yelper's reviews, I can't help but wonder why the cheesecake factory has been consistently terrible to yelpers. I for one, however, love this place.  Their price is right. I do agree though, that their menu is entirely too extensive. I usually have to hog the menu for about 15 minutes if not longer. I've been to this place about 10 times and I always try to get a different appetizers and entrees, and I liked most of them in exception of few. There are definitely hit-and-misses, but their food is decent. Service.. there is only one time I can think of that  I had a bad experience. My server was extremely busy and he was running around like a chicken with its head cut off. He forgot my appetizer and failed to refill my glasses on time. But what the hay, everyone has a bad day. Their wait staffs are friendly (I do have a friend working there) but they can definitely improve on their hosting staff. These young girls are busy in their own conversations, sometimes they forget to greet or seat customers standing right in front of them. So why 4 stars? I think this place is fun, price is right, and the food is (Not by any means exceptional) good. I do believe this is a good quality corporate restaurant."
Brett C.,"Vienna, VA",0,4,,4.0,4/26/2011,I love their cheesecake. They have good lunch menu with reasonable price. The portions are large.
Shawna G.,"Germantown, MD",16,49,,1.0,1/9/2007,"This location ONLY.... terrible terrible terrible!  I love the Cheesecake factory in Rockville, always had great service and food, but this location in Tysons 2 always has horrid service and even worse food that takes FOREVER to arrive.  They will even serve up your drink in a broken glass with glass shards still in it!  Nice!  Run, don't walk away from this restaurant!!!"
Steve Y.,"Burke, VA",12,61,7,2.0,10/24/2007,"Used to loved Cheesecake Factory in Marina Del Ray and Redondo Beach in LA, Fashion Valley in San Diego, and Downtown in Chicago due to nice View and food, but the one at Tyson's Galleria is disappointing. As usual the place is crowded, but server was not that much polite, and dish we order did not cooked correctly. At that moment did not feel like tipping waiter. And because of location they did not got any view to kicking back at the restaurant and enjoy meal and view at the same time."
Terri D.,"Potomac Falls, VA",0,2,,5.0,4/21/2010,"Went for dinner but ended up having happy hour. The waiter told us we could have the appetizers for half price since it was happy hour, the portions would be the same. My husband and I each had 1 margarita and shared 3 appetizers. Food was fresh and tasty. Only $25! Wow, Can't wait to go back."
Mochi K.,"Arlington, VA",31,129,31,3.0,8/18/2006,This seems to be the designated team lunch restaurant because we can walk there (conveniently in tysons II.) I always get the Kobi Beef Burger...1/3 times it was cooked to perfection. I've never had their cheesecake.
Jim L.,"Alexandria, VA",1,9,,1.0,12/19/2006,"This review is not to rate an overall dining experience with this restaurant.  I may do a review in the future as I've eaten at this location and other locations several times, and all the experiences have been very positive. This review is over how an unfortunate incident was handled by the shift manager.   My dinner companion and I decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory for some appetizers and dessert to pick up our spirits after a bad experience with our Thai dinner.  I've tried about half of their selection of cheesecakes before, and they've all been outstanding.  I'm a big cheesecake fan, so I have lots to compare a cheesecake experience to.  But that's getting off point here. We arrived at about 9pm and were seated immediately.  Seating during the prime dinner hour is usually a very long wait.   And like the other reviews pointed out, the service is slow.  This is why one should always be in good company.  It makes the wait go by faster. We ordered the Spicy Ahi Tempura Rolls, Firecracker Salmon Rolls, and Lemoncello Cream Torte and Paradise Tropical Iced Tea to drink.    I know I've said this review isn't about the food, but just a brief note.  The Spicy Ahi Rolls according to the description is supposed to be raw tuna.  It came completely cooked and a bit dry.  The presentation was great and the sauce was very good.  The Firecracker Salmon Rolls was spot on perfect.  The salmon was tender and fatty.  And that  sweet hot chili sauce was just great. Ok, the reason for the 1 star.  The iced tea came in a glass with a big chip in the rim the size of a nickel.  In the dim lighting, we didn't notice it at first.  But then my dinner companion sucked up a shard of glass in the iced tea which made us painfully away of the chip!!  No one was injured or cut, but the thought of drinking glass shards in ones iced tea is offensive.  And we wonder how many bits of glass was drank without notice before this! After waiting about 10 minutes for our waiter to walk by, he showed up, and we made him aware of the problem.  He took the drink away and said he'd get the manager.  After about another 10 minutes, the manager comes to our table and asked us what the problem was!!!  She asked us WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS!  I have no doubt the waiter told her what the problem was.  And if you're the manager of restaurant, your job is now one of spin control and public relations.  Feigning ignorance of the situation is not your best first course of action. So we promptly told her that the problem is that we don't like drinking shards of glass with our iced tea.  She asked if anyone was hurt, and we told her everyone seems physically well, no blood gushing on the table or anything.  This seems to be the extent of her concern.  There was not a hint of embarrassment or contrition over her staff just serving a patron a beverage with a BROKEN PIECE OF GLASS in it.  She asked if that was all.  And we said we'd at least like the drink that was taken away to be replaced (hopefully without the extra glass this time).   She asked if there was anything else.  At this point, my dinner companion in sarcastic tone told her please make sure that no one else gets served beverages with broken glass in it.  It's almost surreal to hear a conversation like that outside of a TV sitcom.  At this point, the manager finally seemed to get the point that we're a bit unsatisfied with the service.  She said that glass had been thrown away and that she would take care of this on the bill.  When the bill came back, she had removed the cheaper of the two appetizers.  Nice.  Very classy. Anyway, for those of you yelpers out there, inspect your glasses closely before you drink. BTW:  This is the first time I did not order a piece of cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe the universe is trying to tell me something. Full Disclosure:  I'm not a paid marketer for yelp, or paid in anyway with any businesses mentioned in this review.  I'm just a foodie."
Shy J.,"Woodbridge, VA",12,77,4,4.0,10/24/2007,"I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes the service is slow.  The food is the delicious.  My favorite dish here is chicken thai pasta.  It's got pasta, peanuts, yummy sauce and bean sprouts sprinkled on top! Yummm :) My bros have been ordering this dish for the last 5 yrs..lol yea it's that good! I however, have tried a lot items on the menu, another that is real good is chicken manderia...Yummmy!  They also started happy hour a few months ago, which is cool, appetizers are half off and the drinks are moderately priced! I think the happy hour is 4-6."
Ken S.,"Arlington, VA",4,132,,3.0,9/30/2007,"The worst part about this place is you need to get there EARLY if you don't want to wait to be seated.   The menu is voluminous so there is something for everyone.  Portions are generous.   It's not inexpensive but I have eaten at many places where the food was either not as good or less quantity for the same price.   The cheesecakes of course are great, but usually have had enough to eat before dessert is offered!"
