Dave H.,"Falls Church, VA",0,125,3,4.0,9/6/2016,"It's been a long time since my partner and I have visited a Cheesecake Factory and the reason that changed tonight was because of their new CakePay app and support for Apple Pay. I heard from a friend how great the experience was using the app and had to see for myself.  Service and food were very good. I've always found Cheesecake Factory to be pretty consistent in both of those areas. I tend not to go there much because the portions are just too large.  After we were seated I checked in on the CakePay app and it generated a four digit code that I gave to the server. A few minuets after he took our order the items showed up in the app.  We shared the the Crispy Chicken Costoletta and it was tasty. Liked the mashed potatoes that came with it and the asparagus was okay.  Love the size of the glasses which meant it was easy for the waiter to keep up with my ice tea consumption.  Had the Pumpkin Cheesecake to finish off the meal. Another tasty dessert.  All of the items showed up in the app very quickly after being ordered and I hit the pay button, was offered an option to split the bill and add a gratuity and swipe to pay with Apple Pay.  The app presented an option to provide feedback which consisted of a star rating and a yes/no on whether I would use the system again (YES). I got an email receipt a few minutes later and the waiter came over to thank us and say we were good to go.  Based on this experience with the app I'll be dining more often at the Cheesecake Factory."
Jingizban K.,"Manhattan, NY",51,239,120,5.0,10/1/2016,"It's been a while since I be been to a Cheesecake Factory or any big chain/franchise restaurant since I live in the big apple  this was an extremely nice, clean and good CF, everyone was extremely friendly from the hostess to the waiter.  Service was quick, and very friendly. I had a pepper steak and came really tasty and to the right temperature. Overall a very good experience."
Timothy T.,"Springfield, VA",442,79,60,3.0,8/2/2016,"3.5*** The service was great! Our waiter was knowledgeable on the food and the cheesecakes and answered our questions very well. One person in our group had  allergies and our waiter recommended what foods to avoid. Although we went on National Cheesecake Day, which granted us %50 off of all cheesecakes, but that did not really help the case. The food is why I rated The Cheesecake Factory a 3.5/5. The portions are amazing, but the quality is ""ehhhhh"". Like I said in my other reviews, it's more about paying for the experience rather than the food. In addition, the Cheesecake that I got (chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake) didn't even taste like cheesecake or have any cheesecake flavors. Good for groups and if you're hungry because they will give you large portions, but do not have high expectations on the quality of the food."
Susan H.,"Reston, VA",451,633,1111,3.0,10/15/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory was the first one we went to.  When it opened, it was crazy busy for a long time so we waited until the hype died down.  We had high expectations after hearing how good the food was and the cheesecakes were the best.  I'll give them that---their cheesecakes are great!  The food...well...it's not outstanding. We hadn't been to a Cheesecake factory in years.  This past Sunday we were at the Galleria and decided to go as it is one of the cheapest places to have dinner in the mall.   We were there around 5 p.m. and the place was doing a brisk business.  Once seated, our server was prompt getting to our table.  We gave our drink orders.  I had a mixed drink, I think the name was JW's lemonade.  It turned out to be a decent well made drink with good flavor.  My husband had a Coors Light. I had my eye on the 1/2 sandwich and soup menu item.  That is, until I found out that there is only 1 soup available and it changes daily.  The soup of the day was chicken soup with artichokes and mushrooms, so I gave it a pass.  I ended up ordering the chicken salad sandwich which consists of:  ""housemade with roasted almonds, lettuce, tomato and mayo on grilled brioche bread"".  For a side, I chose fries.   My husband ordered a turkey club sandwich only to have our server come back to our table to tell us that the restaurant was out of turkey.  Seriously?  It sounds like the culinary manager isn't on top of things.  So, he ordered an old fashioned burger which consists of:  ""charbroiled on a toasted brioche bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and mayo""  For his side, he chose carrots. The chicken salad sandwich was huge!  I guess no one makes normal sized sandwiches anymore!  It didn't hold together well and was rather messy to eat.  The almonds, while sparsely present, did add a nice crunch.  One half of the sandwich oddly had a spicy taste that shouldn't have been there.  The fries were dry and flavorless. My husband said his burger was good.  It was cooked as he ordered and he did enjoy it saying he liked the charbroiled flavor. We didn't get any cheesecake.  However, in the past when we've gone to the Cheesecake factory, we have ordered some to go.  Every time we've had some, we've never been disappointed. I suppose that we will go again sometime.  One thing I've never liked about them---their menu is like a book.  So, it's best to decide beforehand if you want a main course meal, a sandwich, burger or flatbread, etc.  as it will be easier to narrow it down. Before the tip, dinner cost $42 + change."
Declan F.,"Fort Thomas, KY",0,2,1,5.0,9/8/2017,"I hade the best conversation with my waiter (Danny), he was very open-and cool with- my ""memes"". Nice place, food was good, and ""you got games on yo phone?"""
Justin H.,"Jacksonville, FL",259,29,24,1.0,12/30/2016,"By far the worst customer experience I've ever received at a Cheesecake Factory. It seriously took 20 minutes before our server even came to the table and another 15 minutes before we even got our drinks...  Overall food quality was great. We had the avocado egg rolls and the Chicken Piccata. Our server was a nice guy when we did see him, just not attentive.  I should have read all of the yelp reviews about poor customer service before coming."
Diamond B.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,13,7,2.0,3/19/2017,"Worst Cheesecake Factory in the DMV!!  Our food was cold with barely any sauce, we got the jambalaya pasta and the chipotle pasta..typically very saucy at other locations. Our bread was burnt, and the long islands were very weak!  Our server was the only good thing about our visit, Alex was excellent!  Never visiting this location again...my suggestion for anyone wanting to visit is to just drive the 15-20 to the Montgomery mall location instead!!"
Frank K.,"Washington, DC",120,209,173,2.0,6/1/2017,"I feel like this location is greasier than others for some reason. Came in for lunch with some higher-ups (their suggestion) and nothing anyone got was particularly good. The salmon I got was overly dry which was pretty disappointing. My coworker had a fun strategy of ordering appetizers instead of entrees, which doesn't sound like a bad idea since you'd get more variety that way. Overall, I don't think I'll be returning unless I absolutely have to."
TheLasVegasGentleman ..,"Las Vegas, NV",18,117,210,4.0,1/11/2017,"This location is great!  If you want the steadfast quality and consistency of the Cheesecake factory this location rocks!  The Sunday Brunch is one of my favorites, and the elevators out front go directly to the restaurant."
Christyna k.,"Annandale, VA",1,2,,2.0,7/30/2017,"I haven't been back to Cheesecake Factory in 8 years. I was expecting amazing quality and great presentation and generous portions.  Our server was great but whoever is cooking needs to get fired. I ordered gluten free shrimp pasta. I would say the pasta was perfectly cooked but the over all dish was under seasoned and my shrimp was over cooked bleh. We also ordered ahi tuna salad, but the presentation was poorly executed and the amount of salad and Ahi tunA was served was bare minimum. I felt like they didn't have enough of anything in the kitchen on how it was served on my plate. For a dish that is $20 I would expect it to be full of color and generous amount of salad and tuna. The presentation of it was poorly executed. My great memory of Cheesecake Factory being one of the best American restaurant has come to an end."
Ray T.,"Springfield, VA",0,17,3,1.0,10/29/2016,"Probably the worst service. No bread, no refills on drinks, and rarely saw the waiter.   Took 30 minutes to get an order in. And person delivering it had an attitude when we asked for plates to share food."
Shawn F.,"Potomac, MD",0,3,,1.0,9/4/2017,The Food quality is terrible and food service is very slow. The ingredients they use to prepare their dishes are cheap and their food has become too greasy compared to previous years I have attended. The only positive thing I can say is their staff are relatively friendly and their food portion is generous.
Amal B.,"Potomac West, Alexandria, VA",4,3,,1.0,7/10/2017,"This is the worst place where you can eat .the only good thing was the server she was so nice. But the manager she was the most rude person you can meet in your life. I order southwest chicken sandwich and it's not my first time because usually I go to the one in Potomac mills it's always perfect, but in this location it was so bad and I been waiting for more than 30min when the manager she come she said I can have a nother one I said no because I been waiting for a long time so just take it, I wasn't waiting for nothing from her but she said I can have a cheese cake so I said ok thank you that's nice .when my check come they charge me for the sandwich. And they give it to me to go . Are you serious I don't want nothing all what she say I didn't hear you .......... don't go to this location because in the same time 3 tables complained."
Stacie F.,"Springfield, VA",0,13,,4.0,9/22/2016,"I have tried to not get in the habit of  writing reviews for big chain restaurants  however I felt compelled to to write one for this particular location in Tysons Corner. They do offer a a lot of options on the menu, and most of it is your typical all-American comfort food.    The portions are not that bad!  This time around I had the Baja Chicken Sandwich.  My friend had the crab cake entree and Rotini Alfredo.  I have to say that every time that I've I have never tried any food there that wasn't good.  Also the service has always been right on cue!  Compared with other Cheesecake Factories and Burger King's in, I think this place is slightly more busy  One reason why I come here is the location close to work, and the fact that it's the very close to the metro. Being able to walk to Cheesecake from work is a huge plus, and I'm sure I'll be here again."
Nicole N.,"Washington, DC",0,23,3,5.0,7/9/2017,Foods are high quality comparing to the price. I come here often. Breads are yummy especially the brown one. It is a good family get together as well as friends. Went there again on 7/15. Jonathan N. is our server. He is the best. Made our lunch best experience.
Jasmine A.,"Alexandria, VA",153,81,571,3.0,8/2/2016,"Came here for a late lunch with my cousins.  The selection from their menu is HUGE which can be a problem when you are indecisive. I stick with my go to which is the Cajun jambalaya pasta.  I was thinking I can't go wrong with fresh pasta, shrimp and chicken in a Cajun sauce.  Except I was wrong because it wasn't that great.  The dish was watery tasting and didn't have enough of a Cajun flavor.  My pasta was overcooked and borderline mushy.  The shrimp and chicken were okay.  I just remembered that this used to be one of the best dishes I ever had but now it is not that good. We also got the egg roll platter which was pretty good, all different kinds of egg rolls.  The avocado one was really good. My cousin order the bang bang chicken and shrimp and it was disappointing.  I think the chef changed the recipe because from what I remembered it was a red coconut curry sauce filled with veggies.  This time it was yellow with shredded zucchini and carrots. There was not enough curry sauce for the amount of rice given.  The zucchini and carrots were not necessary in the dish if you were going to shred the veggies. At least cut it in bite size to make the dish more appealing.  We also got the bistro shrimp pasta and Louisiana chicken pasta. These two pasta dishes were definitely better than the other dishes we ordered.  The bistro shrimp pasta had crispy breaded shrimp with arugula in a creamy garlic sauce.  The Louisiana pasta had a nice spicy sauce which tasted better than my jambalaya pasta.  Next time, I will try something different."
Ravens Fan N.,"Fairfax County, VA",1,57,6,1.0,5/27/2017,"My family ate at the Tysons Corner restaurant around 4:30pm on 5/26/17. Our server was Carla. The first thing I told Carla was that my 7-year-old daughter has a dairy allergy. She confidently told us that the kids' spaghetti and meatball did not contain dairy. So that's what we ordered. After my daughter had almost finished her plate, she felt sick. I spoke with the manager and asked what ingredients the meatball contained. Parmesan cheese. My daughter felt sick for 6 hours until she finally vomited the pasta. Thanks Carla. You made my daughter sick. (I had already given her Benadryl once she said she was sick). At the beginning of our meal, we had asked for the bread that does not contain dairy. Carla's facial expression showed us that our request was more of a bother. When she came back with sourdough bread, she said ""this bread contains the least amount of dairy."" Least amount? Really? A food allergy is a food allergy, whether a person is exposed to a little or a lot. This just showed us what little knowledge this employee had of food allergies. Thank goodness my daughter did not go into anaphylaxis. Cheesecake Factory needs to step up the training of their employees and teach them the seriousness of food allergies. Someone could die. No joke. Just to add, this was not our first time eating at Cheesecake Factory. My daughter had no problems before. So disappointing."
Melvin B.,"College Park, MD",0,11,3,2.0,6/23/2017,"Service is not good. Food is average. Ordered appetizer and it did not arrive until after main course. Had the Pineapple Mojito and the Passion Fruit Margarita, both were great.  I had the Jambalaya over brown rice. Wife had the California Avocado Salad. Paid an extra $6 for shrimp. She got 4. 4 small shrimp. Son had a burger which he liked.  Because of the appetizer incident this place gets 2 stars."
Melinda M.,"Waldorf, MD",2,59,,4.0,5/3/2017,"I have visited this location a few times. Not the best location or atmosphere, and the service is mediocre but I always enjoy my meals, which is the most important part."
Rich S.,"Washington, DC",0,31,1,2.0,3/1/2017,"My kids love the place, too industrial for me. I had a light Cobb salad. Zero taste. Light=no taste. Got it. The apps were good though I can't remember what they were from last week so it tells you they probably really weren't that good. Ok, the chocolate, chocolate cheese cake we shared weighing in at a whopping 1500 calories was delicious. My two fork fulls left me wanting more. Lesson learned, maybe cheesecake is what you should order at the Cheesecake Factory. Duh!!"
