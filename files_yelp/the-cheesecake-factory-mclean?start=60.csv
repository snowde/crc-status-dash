Melanie B.,"Chantilly, VA",54,4,,3.0,8/11/2017,"Service was good, food was okay. But PLEASE management, turn up the thermostat! It was probably 63 degrees inside. It was SO cold. I know that it's summer time and your servers get hot, but please do something about how cold it is. Maybe provide washed blankets for customers."
Julia V.,"Washington, DC",0,9,,5.0,12/11/2016,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory, my husband and were recommended the fried macaroni cheese balls and the fettuccini. Our service was great,   I highly recommend this location. Thank you Tara!!"
Katrina S.,"Springfield, VA",0,2,2,1.0,7/31/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory food but I will NEVER be returning to this location unless I'm forced to. Our dinner started out with extremely slow service. We were seated immediately but waited 15 minutes for a server to even greet us. I'm used to being offered bread as soon as the waiter greets us but we were offered none so we asked for some. No biggie, except for the fact that it took another 10-15 minutes to get our bread. Our server wasn't even the one who brought it out. We asked for more bread when we ran out but he didn't bring it by the time we got our entrees so we didn't bother asking again.  Now this is the kicker, when I received my meal (shrimp scampi and steak Diane combo) my portion was TINY. LIKE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL. I thought Cheesecake Factory was known for huge portion sizes? I had even asked the general size of a steak Diane when I ordered and the estimate he showed me was way bigger than what I got. My friend had also gotten a steak Diane combo and her portion was about twice the size of mine.  I'm not much for confrontation but I asked my friends if I should tell the waiter and they said yes. We tried to flag him down but he was literally nowhere to be found. We proceeded to stand up in our booth and try to flag down any other waiter but no one even looked at us, no joke. We decided to put the steak aside until we could find him and ask him about it. By the time he actually came by our table we were finished with everything except the steak. I pointed out the portion difference as politely as I possibly could because I didn't want him to think I was blaming him (it's not like the waiter controls how the food is cooked). He said he could see what I was saying and what I would like to do. I told him a few more pieces of steak would be perfect, just enough so mine and my friends portion sizes were even. He said he would go and try to get me some (which I appreciated) and left to the kitchen.  When he came back he finally gave us the bread we were waiting for (took him long enough) then told me the most bullshit excuse ever. He said ""what had happened was they weighed the portions but I'll bring you out some more anyways"". Now this pissed me off. At the very least they could apologize then bring me the extra steak but no, instead they acted as if I was seeing things and nothing was wrong. I asked my friends if our portions looked even close to the same weight and they said absolutely not it was an obvious lie. This alone made my dinner the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER. I can't stand for companies who blame their customers for problems and make lame excuses to save their asses. I got my extra pieces of steak in the end but I was already annoyed. If you want slow service and to be ripped off with extremely small portion sizes then blamed for it, come here. If not go to the Potomac mills location or fair oaks, they have some of the best costumer service ever. I don't know why tysons is so lacking."
Lynn M.,"Houston, TX",0,10,1,5.0,12/8/2016,"We go here fairly often and are never disappointed.  The service is wonderful and friendly, the atmosphere is warm, and the tables are clean. I always have trouble with their tome of a menu, so many options, but recently I've fallen in love with the fried spicy chicken sandwich, minus the spice, plus some blue cheese.  The only thing I do recommend is ordering cheesecake AT YOUR TABLE. I made the mistake of waiting until we were leaving to order it from the to-go cheesecake counter at the front, and I must have waited half an hour for a guy to take a slice of cheesecake out of the fridge and put it into a box: when I was the only one there. A process that should take two minutes, tops!"
Jasmine B.,"Leesburg, VA",0,10,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Went in for dinner the dishes that were on the table were dirty but they were replaced as we sat down so definitely no sweat as of yet. As my family and I proceeded with dinner that evening, every cup every fork and every plate was dirty, when we addressed the server with our concerns he eventually stated ""someone forgot to run the dishwasher today."" The manager came by and said ""sorry"" and didn't offer any type of incentive or discount or anything, being that I was in Tyson's! Cheesecake Factory a restaurant that's attached to a mall that has all high end stores inside, I wasn't anticipating chunks of unidentifiable items in my drink and dirty plates and then to conclude receive terrible service. There's plenty of restaurants in the Tyson's area definitely will not be going back! SN: my worst experiences always happen in franchised restaurants!"
Jermaine D.,"Alexandria, VA",44,6,3,1.0,5/23/2017,"What made this experience so bad was our waiter, not attentive, I've been to this particular restaurant before and the service was soo much better than the service Luis provided. What could have made our experience better? Try slowing down and listening to your clients questions and then answering based on what they asked you not what you think because your doing your job out of routine."
Chris W.,"Leesburg, VA",0,20,3,1.0,8/6/2016,"Horrible service. Management doesn't care. See the photo with hair in my chicken. Complained to the manager on duty and all he said was ""sorry, it happens sometimes I'll talk to my staff"" NEVER EATING AT THIS LOCATION AGAIN. It sucks because I work right next to the restaurant and always refer my clients to go there ...until this happened."
Sana S.,"Sterling, VA",199,169,315,1.0,10/29/2015,"Went there for a birthday lunch with 5 of my coworkers. We were seated promptly, but it all went downhill from there.  Our server Rahul, was very forgetful. I had to ask at least 3 times for bread and each time he reacted as if he had never heard me say it before. After about 15 minutes he finally brought us our bread and water, which he had to make multiple trips for. Not sure what the delay was, the restaurant was not packed at all and the other servers around us seemed to be more responsive to their tables.  It took another 20 minutes before the drinks we ordered arrived. Then, we sat for 40 minutes waiting for our food to come, I had to go up to the hostess and ask for a manager because the wait time was just ridiculous.  The manager appologized stating that one of the orders, a burger was overcooked. Regardless I don't understand how that would result in 40 minutes. We watched parties who had arrived after us eat and leave before us, that's how slow the service was for our table. Finally the food came out, but not even all of it. Two plates at a time with about 10 minutes in between. All of our entrees were freezing cold and had clearly been sitting under the heat lamps as they were slightly warm on the surface. We refused to eat our meals. The mananger came over and was extremely flustered. He had no idea how to handle the situation and at one point walked away while I was speaking to him. Not only that, but he reiterated and became frustrated that we were complaining since he had told us about the burger needing to be recooked. He later offered to remake our meals, but after an hour and half wasted, we just had zero patience or desire to eat there anymore. He stated he would take all of the food off our bill and that we were only responsible for the drinks. Took another 15 minutes for the check to come and for the server to process it, we were so frustrated that we almost walked out.  Upon leaving, the server offered us a slice of cheescake. I politely refused. A complimentary slice of cheescake does not make up for the 2 hours wasted.  Thanks Cheescake Factory for your extremely poor service and managment. I wish I had gotten the managers name, but I have no idea how he can run a restaurant, I have never experienced such poor managment skills, or honestly lack there of. Also, thanks for not only ruining my birthday lunch, but lunch hour for 5 of my coworkers. All of us went back to the office after wasting 2 hours and were still hungry."
N C.,"Marlton, NJ",5,103,5,2.0,6/14/2016,"Food is on par with other Cheesecake Factory locations, but the servers are some of the worst. Very loud ambiance, as usual/expected. I've gotten nothing but spotty or surly service here. We don't want cheesecake for dessert or to-go after our meal? Our server got mad at us and stormed off to get the check. Meanwhile, I was admiring the next table's ultra-professional server. With an attitude like that, I'd rather just buy the cheesecake directly from the cake window.  The service at the cake display window is top notch. At least that made up for the food service.  Also, the ThyssenKrupp hydraulic elevators are pretty nice to experience, and convenient (and snazzy, i guess) to get to the restaurant from the main level.  At their cheesecake slice prices, though, I'd consider other dessert options within the mall. Update: I tried the Salted Caramel cheesecake, per recommendation. It's definitely the best one of their seemingly endless selection. The other ones just seem to be either sugar bombs, other flavors than cheesecake, etc. From now on I won't even bother testing my blood sugar with any other potential flops."
Mona R.,"Merrifield, VA",48,20,4,3.0,1/19/2017,So I give this place a 3 star mainly for the atmosphere. We usually go here for dinners and the lights are so dim that you can't see half of your party if you are going with a  large group. I mentioned this to our waiter at different visits at this location and i was told its  their policy to keep the lights dim for dinner.  Other that this the service is good and i usually get same dish ( I think it's called the thai salmon) and it's pretty awesome! you must also try their avocado egg rolls/wraps
Julie K.,"Springfield, VA",2,24,5,2.0,3/26/2017,"I wouldn't recommend this Cheesecake Factory for a large group especially if it's a birthday. We went in at 8:30 last night Saturday night, 15 of us. And we waited around an hour and half I believe. But we weren't bothered by that at all we understood that it was busy and it's hard to find a large table like that at that time. Also the hosts was extremely nice she kept us updated on our table, and we really appreciated that. So after we got our table our server came by I didn't see him greet anyone just started taking drinks orders. He looked tired and had a long day and he looked busy. So he got the drinks order took about 15 minutes to get us waters he got drinks for half the table and left the other half until he remembered. He wasn't very attentive barely came to check up on us I got frustrated a little and told him we are ready to order now. So he took our orders and left. My friend tried to call on him while he's walking by and asked him ""excuse me sir can I get"" and the server replied ""yeah yeah"" and kept walking away he didn't even stop to ask what he wanted and didn't even let him finish what he wanted. My friend wanted more bread, he brought out the bread after a while, didn't even ask if we needed butter and ran off. The drinks from the bar took around 30 minutes to come out. By the time we got our food everyone was starving. I got the chicken Riesling that was on the speciality it was amazing. But the disappointing part was our server didn't come around and check if we wanted parmesan cheese and did ask how our food was, I know one person on the table didn't like their pasta much.  So my friend kept calling on him saying ""hey sir can we please get some Parmesan cheese"" my friend asked him twice because of how he never came to our table but to just take orders. So the server reply okay with a little attitude and while he was walking away he shook his head at us! Like seriously!! I wasn't sure who's serving whom at that moment. I had 3 years serving experience and never seen such a rude server! I would've not wrote this review if he didn't shake his head at us, because I understand how tough the job can be. If he was at least nice and smiling more often and saying sorry for the delays we would've totally understood. I would've spoken to a manager and made it a big deal but it was my friends birthday so I kept quite just didn't want any distractions from her time. It was getting frustrating because we waited so long to get a table and half of us were starving and it just wasn't worth the wait. But I loved my dish and would recommend you getting it if you like pasta."
Bob T.,"Arlington, VA",90,224,259,1.0,9/26/2015,"It has been a long time since I ate at a Cheesecake Factory.  Thanks to this meal it will be longer still before I try again. There were four of us, three adults and my 7-year old daughter.  None of us walked away having enjoyed anything we ordered. The food is still dished out in portions so generous as to border on the absurd.  However, the flavors and presentation were anywhere from bland to yucky.  For example, my bacon bacon cheeseburger (not a typo, it has two different kinds of bacon) tasted just OK.  I finished it and would not order it again.  My desert, a Warm Apple Crisp, was a gummy mess.  Nothing about it was the least bit crispy.  The only thing differentiating the apples, ""crisps"", and ice cream was the temperature.  I could only stomach a few bites and would never consider ordering it again.   The thing that pushed the meal over the edge, plummeting towards atrociousness, was my daughter's dessert.  She wanted the 7-layer chocolate cake, and I couldn't see plopping something that huge in front of a child.  So, I asked the waiter to serve her half and put the rest in a box.  He brought it to our table as the entire slice in a box.   When I asked him about it, he said serving the cake as an entire slice was a presentation issue and the kitchen staff refused to cut it in half as I requested.  When I spoke to the manager, he said the same thing. Between the (at best) mediocre food and a host of other service issues the meal already stank.  This last thing, refusing a perfectly reasonable request, was just icing on what turned out to be an overly-sweetened and otherwise flavorless piece of cake. I also noticed something a bit underhanded.  If you split the check and don't stop to think you will be overtipping... big time.  Their credit card slips come with three pre-calculated tip amounts to save the effort of calculating the tip.  The problem is if you ask them to split the charge between credit cards, the calculated tips provided are still against the original total.  For example, my credit card slip was for $53 and the ""Suggested Gratuity"" of 20% was listed at $21.20."
Melissa C.,"Ashburn, VA",1,30,23,3.0,9/16/2016,"Service was decent for 10pm on a Friday. Portabello, Avocado, and Zuchinni fries were delicious as usual. My go-to Chicken Madeira was bland compared to other locations. The mashed potatoes were barely mashed with chunks of whole potato still in there. Pumpkin cheesecake and pumpkin pecan cheesecake is back and amazing as ever!"
Claudia M.,"Woodbridge, VA",67,2,1,1.0,4/20/2017,50m to get my curb side order that is ridiculous the food was cold and i believe they forgot about it until i call to see where my food was. They said it just came out and they will be right down. Nope the fries were cold and the cheese was hard like as it was sitting there until i call.
Gianna S.,"Vienna, VA",302,8,4,5.0,3/14/2017,"Cecilia was our server and she was amazing! The service was great, she recommended Evelyn's favorite pasta for me because I don't eat meat and I got it with a garlic cream sauce instead of what it normally comes with and it was amazing. My boyfriend got the salmon and he said his food was really good too."
Hellen B.,"Falls Church, VA",0,1,,2.0,4/18/2017,"The only reason why I will give this review two stars is because the food was actually decent. For the service..I wish I could say the same.  We came to eat at The Cheesecake Factory for a coworker's birthday and left with a bitter taste in our mouths. One of our coworkers ordered a Luau salad and was given a completely different salad. We asked our waitress (Yadira?) why this salad is different and she said that they don't have the Luau salad and so she ordered one based on what she thinks our coworker would like. No apologies or anything and she just kept insisting we keep the salad we chose. After we asked for a new salad, she looked upset, but ended up giving us what we asked for. We then asked for her to bring out a cheesecake for a surprise birthday treat and she said that she got us. She came later with a dinky shot glass of whipped cream with a candle. I asked her what happened to the cheesecake and she said that this is what they usually give for birthdays. However, we ASKED for a cheesecake from the very beginning. She laughed and said how funny the shot glass looks and just walked away. Incredible. Btw she called one of our male coworkers ma'am 3 times for some reason even one time after we mentioned that to her that he is a male. Also, when we left she charged us for the original salad then double charged on accident and then charged us the correct amount making one credit card have three big dinners' worth out of their account until the refunds came back.  Overall, food was decent, service was horrible and a simple sorry should have been given."
Sonam D.,"Falls Church, VA",0,24,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Unfortunately we had a horrible experience here tonight. My family has been coming here for years, but after tonight we will not be back. Out of the party of 9 people, not one person liked their food. First they bring out the wrong food to us then we get our correct orders, the first cut in the chicken was undercooked and still pink. Practically raw. Then all the bread they served was tough and stale. It was like ripping meat. Bread should never be like that. And all the food tasted the same. We all ordered completely different dishes, yet everything tasted the same. Like the same sauce was being used for the pasta and rice dishes.  In all, quality here has gone way below average. I don't know what they changed or did, but it's almost inedible to eat food here."
George S.,"McLean, VA",34,76,20,4.0,9/7/2016,Quick service with lots of options.  Everything from Burgers to Asian to Italian.  Save room for the cheesecake.  Next two months they have the pumpkin pecan cheesecake.  Yeah.
Melanie M.,"Annapolis, MD",0,7,12,5.0,10/6/2016,"Amazing lunch!!! Justin was our waiter and really knocked the food from a 4 to a 5!!! He was attentive, responsive and great recommendation on food and drinks! We had the house Pinot... So good and started with bread and edamame! Went on to great salads for lunch and topped it with 2 desserts for me and Twins Bd!! Apple cobbler... Awesome! Seriously! Thank you for a very memorable shopping  lunch/ shopping trip with Mom!!! Love it!"
Beth N.,"Alexandria, VA",0,25,,1.0,6/26/2016,"My friends keep dragging me back out of habit, I guess. But it's not my 1st choice ever. In fact last night's meal was so bad that I have to add to the already bad and mediocre reviews. First the food quality is crap. My caesar salad was nothing more than a pile of shredded iceberg lettuce with some grated cheese on top. The dressing they gave was like thousand island or kechup and mayo. The burger was okay, although slightly overcooked and the bun was so soggy I could not eat it. In the past I likes the grilled salmon, not the glazed Thai version though. At least the service was okay, not great but okay. The place is always so dark that I have to use my phone light to see the menu. Next time my friends want to go there I'm cutting out, this place just sucks."
