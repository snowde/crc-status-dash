G I.,"Vienna, VA",0,12,2,1.0,9/12/2016,Horrible steak Diane and salmon combo - $21 - for supposed half and ounce (three pieces of steak.!!!) did the guy eat a piece on the way over to delivering it??!! Not worth the price. Worst birthday dinner ever.
Natalie V.,"Washington, DC",16,226,6,1.0,5/2/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory and will eat there whenever I can, but never again at this one. The food at giant chains like this tends to be consistent, so what distinguishes each location is service.  Service on a Monday night was absolutely inexcusable. The restaurant was maybe 20% full, but it still took forever for our waiter to acknowledge us after we were seated. After he took our order, we barely saw him.  Both of us were starving and blew through the bread basket quickly. At every single other Cheesecake Factory location, we've always been asked if we want more bread. Here, I pushed the empty bread basket so it was hanging off the edge of our booth. Numerous waitstaff members walked by, looked at it, one even bumped into it, yet nobody asked us if we would care for a refill.  When our food arrived, our waiter put it on the table, glanced at the empty bread basket and walked away without another word. Way to go."
Kristy V.,"College Park, MD",8,57,112,2.0,1/17/2016,"Any Cheesecake Factory chain that I've been to is known for the terrible wait time. So I tried to make a reservation to avoid that - happened anyways. Welp I tried. Even with a reservation we waited about 45 minutes for a table on a Tuesday night.  The food is okay. I don't expect too much from a chain restaurant. Their portions are huge so at least you get your money's worth. Except for $8-10 cheesecake slices, that will never be worth it. Chicken Bellagio is always a win for me however everyone else at my table couldn't even eat half their meal. It was either salt smothered, cold, or raw. One was even salty AND cold, tsk.  Our waiter came by enough that I got 1 whole refill and a check at the end. My table wanted nothing to do with their food but the staff wouldn't look at us long enough to flag someone down to get a new entree. So... We all ended up splitting my one plate of Chicken Bellagio.   For a restaurant that themes themselves around pricey cheesecakes, fix your other food or just stick to cheesecakes; not to mention your lackluster staff because I don't see any reason why I would ever return.  2 stars because without my one good entree we would've starved for another hour."
Prisilma S.,"Woodbridge, VA",114,10,11,5.0,1/31/2017,"the best evening by far in a long time. my date & i were on our 2nd date, it was amazing!  our waiter was incredible. shout out to Matt! he right away got drinks & was super funny. also accommodating, pushed together tables so we didnt feel squished. really was a good time, definitely because of his service to us!"
Umair M.,"Falls Church, VA",22,138,314,4.0,6/27/2016,"Just like any other cheesecake franchise. Sometimes the food is really good and sometimes it's average. I have been going to this location for last many years and continue to do so. Items I have tried the most are ribeye steaks, bang bang chicken n shrimps, chicken avocado club (most fav.) crispy calamari, grilled salmon with Shrimps, and perhaps all possible types of cheesecakes. Nothing unique here but nothing that is really bad so still a very much go to place."
Siyani T.,"Clinton, MD",0,1,1,1.0,9/28/2016,I've been to this restaurant on multiple occasions and have never us an issue but this last visit will ensure I never step foot in this place again. I came for happy hour one afternoon and the bartender was friendly and attentive. I received my drinks and waited for my appetizers when my wontons arrived I was horrified and disgusted to find a roach floating in the dipping sauce. Out of all the disgusting things that can happen when you are about to eat. I immediately sent all the food back and said I would just finish my drinks. The disappointing part of this was the response by the manager who came over to apologize and immediately placed the blame on their pest control partnership and replied that the restaurant itself does not take responsibility the pest control company would reach out to me. This is not acceptable to me as she not once acknowledged that her waiter brought the food out to me without looking over it to ensure quality. The roach was not hidden under lettuce or anything it was literally belly up back stroking in the wonton sauce. I'm appalled. I shouldn't know about your agreements or guarantees with your pest company that's not my business and its your responsibility on behalf of the customer. Not theirs. Never thought this would be an issue at this location.  IMG_4204.JPG
Gloria Y.,"Waldorf, MD",1,3,1,1.0,2/27/2017,Rude wait staff meet with incompetent management if that is the dining experience you had hoped to enjoy you have found your spot!!  If you ever have the pleasure of meeting the absurdly rude Gabrielle (who must be clinically unbalanced) you would have had a nice evening. Chalk it up with a management team that condones & supports the behavior. Customer service classes were skipped at this Cheesecake Factory!! #wontgetmy$$$
Christine D.,"McLean, VA",35,69,75,3.0,1/23/2017,This is a classic staple! Pretty much anything you get here will be good! It had all meals here breakfast lunch dessert and everything was good! I especially love the happy hours such a good deal! A good go to place for a lot of people because they have so much of a variety!
Carol P.,"Kensington, MD",0,4,,1.0,7/31/2017,"Very disappointing. I would have sent my meal back, except that a friend was taking me out so I didn't want to cause a fuss. I have not been to this chain in a long time, but I remember it as being big portions and very good pastas. I ordered the Neapolitan pasta, which on the menu sounded great - bacon, pepperoni, meatballs, peppers, garlic, etc. in tomato sauce over a parmesan cream pasta. What I got tasted like it had been scraped off the bottom of a pan where it had been burnt. There were no meatballs, I couldn't even tell what some of the things were int it, and there was no sauce, just a congealed paste. There was very little sauce (which may be a good thing) covering a lot of spaghetti. It was the beginning of lunch,  hardly anyone was there, so it wasn't due to an overcrowded kitchen. Never again - too many other good choices."
Greg P.,"Waldorf, MD",1,44,3,2.0,12/17/2016,Nice place but we won't be back. Deafening loud music. I've heard quieter subways. It seems the managers would realize that while enjoying good food having to yell across the table to talk is unacceptable.
Sungmin S.,"Richmond, VA",47,297,193,3.0,8/24/2015,"What is the best way to review a chain restaurant anyway? Cheesecake factory at this location is convenient because it's located in Tysons II in case you get hungry in the middle of your shopping spree. I drop by here often for lunch while shopping with my parents, as they have a wide-ranged menu where everyone can find something for themselves. Most of their food is mediocre at best in my personal opinion, but their new ""superfood"" salad section seems very promising and I do enjoy some of their pastas (louisiana, angel hair with shrimp, jambalaya) as I don't eat pasta at home often. The only thing is that even though it never seems very busy during weekday lunch time, it takes forever for us to get decent service. Better attention from the staff during day time would be nice!"
Thelma M.,"Falls Church, VA",1,3,,1.0,1/16/2017,I first wanna start off by saying how horrible my service was. I use to work in the restaurant business as a server myself.! But this server had no experience or didn't know what he was doing.  I always come to this restaurant and never had a problem. But unfortunately yesterday I came with a group of close friends to celebrate the arrival of my baby girl. We all had a bad experience we wanted to walk out because we waited for water and our drinks for about 20-25 minutes. Later our appetizers came late then our other appetizer came 20 mins later. We had to tell our server that we didn't get our appetizer. He not once bother to check up on us. Don't know what he was doing but horrible service. Afterwards we waited an hour and a half for our food. Our food order was not hard at all. It was ridiculous that he did not even bother to check on the food. Then my friends again ordered 2 mojitos and once again it took another 20/25 minutes to come out. We were so upset we didn't even wanna order cheesecake because that was going to take another 30 minutes.! I honestly felt bad for him because he lacked in training I still tipped him but not the amount he deserved. Regardless he knew he messed up and did not do a good job he didn't even offer a discount on our bill. This will be the last time I come to this restaurant. If I had the option to give no stars at all I would.!!!!!
J A.,"Washington, DC",3,36,5,1.0,10/10/2016,"Terrible meals call for terrible reviews, right? Cheesecake is usually spot on with their food but today was way off. All of the food was over cooked and very tasteless/bland. We also had other ingredients that popped up in our appetizer that wasn't supposed to be there because they apparently cooked it in the same water as the pasta. Then why would carrots and misc seasoning show up in additional to pasta bits on our plate?? And why are they re-using the same, floury water to cook my appetizer? Even after sending it back and getting a 'fresh' batch, it still remained. Our pasta was also wayyyy overcooked and the chicken was so 'tender' that it would have been fine for someone with no teeth. What a waste of a meal..."
David N.,"Reston, VA",0,13,,1.0,7/7/2017,"I got an ""Asian Chicken Salad"". There wasn't much about it that was Asian, and it had very little chicken. I spent the whole meal hunting around in the pile of lettuce for tiny bits of protein. Definitely substandard."
My S.,"Burke, VA",108,193,350,3.0,5/6/2016,"Huge portions but 60% of the food is below average. It is always dark in here (as with other locations) and while it isnt amazing food, it can get crowded. The cheesecake is good but I find it is very sweet. Favorite has got to be the Godiva chocolate cheesecake. It is rich and super dark and so so good. My other favorite is the red velvet but I am not sure if it is as good as it used to be. Texmex eggrolls are good, chicken Bellagio is satisfying and huge, the southwest chicken sandwich is good, the mango smoothie is delicious sugar in a cup (borderline very sweet but I love mango), Thai chicken lettuce wraps are fresh tasting and fun to eat. Calamari here is actually one of the better ones I've had. Their bread basket is one of my favorites because the wheat bread is slightly sweet and is really good with butter when it is hot."
Ihita K.,"Silver Spring, MD",203,309,501,3.0,4/15/2015,"Having a workplace located next to Tysons Galleria means your lunch options are relegated to like a total of 5 places in the mall .. bah humbug. Cheesecake Factory is one of them, and having the ability to seat large parties, I've had more corporate lunches and dinners at this establishment than my nonchainliking self would prefer. That being said, I have a mild obsession with Louisiana Chicken Pasta (w/ extra mushrooms, always) .. it just never fails me. Simple bow tie pasta with parmesan crusted chicken served with mushrooms, peppers and nnions in a ""spicy"" ""New Orleans"" sauce. The quotes are due to the fact that while delicious, and addictive, it is never actually spicy so I always ask for crushed red peppers, and as a frequent visitor and lover of Nola .. I can promise you that there's nothing authentic about this sauce. But it's still good I promise! If you happen to in the mall during the day time and don't find yourself with a job to hurry back to, try out their happy hour from 3:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Or if you happen to work in the area and your job causes you to want to imbibe early in the day, it works for that too .. not that I'm speaking from experience or anything. 0:)"
Lynn S.,"Alexandria, VA",151,817,268,4.0,3/9/2014,"Yes, this is part of a chain, but the food here is consistently good and extraordinarily fresh. No dish was incredibly memorable, but with a huge menu, there are enough choices to please anyone. It offers an excellent family dining experience (ask for a large booth). If you are lucky enough to get Masa as your server, things will go smoothly. Salads that include chicken mean fresh chicken, not dried out cubes. Our beet salad, ranch barbecue and cobb salads were good. TIP: Lunch size is a generous meal.  We also ordered the fried calamari appetizer--fresh but bland without the hot sauce, just like the equally fresh Thai wrap appetizer served with 3 dipping sauces. This restaurant manages to put out good (not gourmet) food efficiently. The dining areas are softly illuminated and relaxing. Their famous cheesecake offerings are extensive, generously sliced, so leave room for dessert even if you decide to share."
Bahar N.,"Fairfax, VA",56,1,,1.0,12/9/2016,"Love the food, hate the service. It seems like this is the only location that does not know how to provide good customer service. Went for my lunch break with my coworker and sat down at the bar area. After 20 mins Mila the waitress approached us and ordered us in a very rude manner to not sit there and go get a table with the hostess. Needless to say we didn't eat there."
L H.,"McLean, VA",0,46,21,4.0,6/10/2017,"We have been to the Cheesecake Factory on several occasions mainly in the evening but this time was in the afternoon on a Saturday. The food was typical and pretty standard, you come for the cheesecake not the food let's face it. As for the staff, they may have been recovering from a hangover, late night shift, or just hate their job. Bottom line, great cheesecake."
Trivedi I.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,2,,3.0,12/7/2016,The deserts are awesome and it's always a yummy place to land in when in stress.. I'm loving it
