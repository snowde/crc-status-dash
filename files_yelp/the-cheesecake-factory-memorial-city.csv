Amisha A.,"Houston, TX",7,30,22,4.0,12/17/2017,"Came here last night with a group of friends! Our waitress, Christie M., was awesome! She was very knowledgeable, patient, and friendly! We ordered stuffed mushrooms and fried mac and cheese for appetizers.  So. Good.  I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. It was cooked to perfection! It wasn't over cooked and the fillet flaked off perfectly. The lemon dill sauce was creamy and paired well with the asparagus and mash potatoes.  Overall, I think Cheesecake is a great chain... especially when you are craving all kinds of comfort food. All of our plates came out hot and was as expected. To note, their portions are huge (you can probably share one entree among two people). They have plenty of options to choose from on the menu (plenty is an understatement!)."
Nav E.,"Northwest Houston, Houston, TX",149,31,55,1.0,12/2/2017,Disappointed   I love this place because there is a dish for every pallet the menue is extensive so if you are with a group of people there is always something for everyone. I usually come to the Memorial city location at east 3 times a week and everyone is usually great.  Today we had such an awful experience a Freind in my group ordered a steak and requested it med well and chatted she got a very rare steak .. poorly seasoned and could not eat it. She did not want to send it back but the waiter insisted so he had the manager come over and he apologized and placed a new order  Ten minutes later the Chef comes to our tables and argues with my Freind about the way it was prepared Needles to say my Freind was humiliated and mortified . This chef was lecturing her we all were shocked  requests the check paid and left without eating our dinner  NEVER AGAIN WILL I MY CLIENTS FRIENDS IR FAMILY WILL EAT AT THAT LOCATION I fail to understand why this cook ‍ had to make such a big production over it  We came to eat not to be lectured ...
Monique T.,"Houston, TX",29,12,34,1.0,12/2/2017,Rude chefs rude staff  I came here with a friend who ordered a steak and it was not cooked as ordered  The manager was nice but the chef came out to argue about what a Pittsburgh style is OMG Why argue  Used to come here 5 times a week  Never again
Shameika H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",444,88,120,5.0,1/10/2018,"This location is my favorite location for the Cheesecake Factory in the Houston area due to the service. If I'm craving my Chicken Parm Pizza, I come on in. When coming in, I request Michelle. She does such a phenomenal job with balancing all her tables. She always makes sure that my glass is full and never empty. As always, when in the Houston area I will be returning to this location for my chicken parm pizza, and the service!"
Elisa M.,"Houston, TX",50,58,107,4.0,12/13/2017,Love coming here since they have so many options to choose from. The menu literally had something for everyone and they have lunch specials even on the weekends which is nice. I haven't gotten the chance to try the cheesecake since the food portions are so big and I end up too full for dessert. But definitely need to come and try dessert since it is the Cheesecake Factory.haha.
Kurt K.,"Houston, TX",4,111,4,4.0,11/14/2017,"I can't help. I have to say it was worth four stars. After been the first time with the Cheesecake Factory in Boston with good experience. I had to try this one close to our home. We were seated straight away, a waitress was shortly with us after it and our drinks came pretty quickly. Than we ordered the food, which I expected tasty, but wait. The bread came a few minutes after we ordered and when we had finished it the main course came right on time. Even faster than in Boston. Oh , nearly forgot, we had some delicious starter as well. So definitely go for the food. The service was good as well. So that our waitress was only really friendly when we left it cost her some better tip. But it's her choice. Nothing to do with the Cheesecake Factory. So despite most of the reviews, we had a good time here and as I said. The 4 starts are well earned."
Saba E.,"Houston, TX",590,578,143,4.0,6/22/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is where we had our first date, so we always try to return to one on that anniversary.  We no longer reside in the city where we had our first day, but lucky for us, TCF is a chain.  Last year we dined at the Galleria TCF for our anniversary, but since the weather was so nice this time, we thought we'd dine at a TCF with an outdoor eating area. This place was perfect. The atmosphere was both serene and romantic.  We shared a bottle of LaMarca and each had amazingly large entrees. I had some steak and asparagus with mashed potatoes; my husband had some meaty pasta dish.   Of course, we ended the night with cheesecake - we opted for an Nutella one. And, as usual - - we couldn't finish it.  Until next year, TCF. . ."
Joseph R.,"Katy, TX",960,2,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Worst service ever! They were out of both things I ordered and we got there at 545 pm in order to make a 7 pm Rockets game! Birthday party all food came out different times and my sweetheart finally got her chicken salad sandwich at past 7 pm over 1 hour later! Waiter forgot the order and then lied and said kitchen was backed up. No waters! Drinks not refilled! Food not good , late for game! Terrible waiter and management! I would not go again if I had a big party or in a hurry imo! Joe"
Tommy S.,"Houston, TX",35,205,182,2.0,2/21/2017,"This was my second visit at the Cheesecake Factory at Memorial City Mall. It was somewhat of a downer compared to the last time that I visited when it was first opened. Ambiance: the place was nicely decorated, but it was little dark at dinner time. Still it was not a big deal.  Service: It was a midweek night so it wasn't too crowded. Our party got seated right away. Our waiter came by, introduced himself, took our drinks order and starters, promised to come back with our breads right away then disappeared for 10 minutes.  We saw him again right around the time our appetizers came out. He came back with our breads, took our entree orders then came back again after we received our main course to ask whether everything was ok.   We had our interaction with our waiter again when I ordered desserts for our table and let him know that we were celebrating my friend's birthday. He somewhat redeemed himself a little when my friend's Cheesecake came out with a candle and a bit of decoration. Food: We ordered fried calamari which was decent and another appetizer that escaped my mind at the moment. I think both items were good. My wife ordered shrimp scampi pasta. She felt the pasta was a little dry and was lacking enough sauce. My birthday friend concurred and let our waiter know. He informed his manager and offered to give us take home orders to make up for the subpar dish. We didn't partake on his offer as we just wanted to let the restaurant know plus we had eaten more than half off the plates already due to hunger. My jambalaya pasta was alright but the pasta was a bit hard perhaps due to it being a tad undercooked. Still the dish was edible. I left about half the plate due to its large portion. The cheesecakes were as good as they were. We got chocolate cheesecake and the NY style. Both were great This visit to the Cheesecake Factory was somewhat disappointing. The service was not up to par. The food in general was below the Cheesecake Factory standard. I used to love the main course here as it was served in a big portion.  I always looked forward to eating the leftover for lunch the next day, but not this time.  Initially I was going to give an average rating of 3-star. After writing this review, I realized that my dining experience here was worse than I thought. The final rating was then adjusted to a 2-star."
Vicky L.,"Houston, TX",134,503,3491,1.0,1/28/2017,"This location has been one of the worst Cheesecake Factory locations I've ever been to. Not only is this smaller and more crowded, the service is disappointing and food is mediocre.  Is being seated almost immediately and then not meeting your server until ten minutes later fine with you? Is finally meeting your server and placing your orders for drinks and entrees, then receiving your tea and coffee another 15 minutes later also okay with you? Well if you answered yes to those questions then this would be your perfect lunch/dinner/date/happy hour option. My party of 5 had begun to wonder if our server had forgotten about us or if she was extremely busy or just inefficient. Whatever the case was, it was clearly unacceptable. Our coffees were brought out in a clear mug, no dish. It was lukewarm at best and had a soapy dishwater after taste, bleh. We had a difficult time flagging down our server to ask for a replacement. After waiting an hour, and 2 coffee refills later, our entrees were still nowhere to be found. We had to speak with management about the service and he was apologetic. Our entrees then came shortly after and while we all finished our meals (starving mode by then), it was not good enough to say that we'd come back.  Overall a bad experience and I do not recommend dining at this location, unless you answered yes to the two questions I posed above."
Jorge A.,"Katy, TX",46,1,,2.0,11/25/2017,"Massive portions just about 3 minutes or so after our orders went in.... microwave much? The cheesecakes slices were delicious but the food and service were awful. I never really care much for reviews but I don't think we enjoyed our experience. Waitress couldn't care less, borderline unprofessional."
Roni G.,"Houston, TX",19,147,217,3.0,7/30/2017,"I did dread to come here because my first experience wasn't too great. It took FOREVER to get us seated and I did expect worst because the cheesecakes were half off but to my surprise we got in pretty quickly (10-15 minutes on a Sunday). When I got my slice of cheesecake, it looked sad (melted and small) but it was pretty filling. One slice can be split between two people I'd say, especially if you're already getting an entree; the food is pretty heavy.  I usually like to go in the mornings for cake and coffee (=^ェ^=)"
Jesse W.,"Dallas, TX",55,182,189,3.0,2/18/2017,"So the cheesecake factory has always been consistent on service and food. Odd I have never yelped it, but now is the time. Tool my gf for a late valentine's flat date. The bad this time: The service today was extremely poor in the beginning, 32 minutes to get our entrees ordered. Which was 18 minutes after we got our apps. Delievered by someone elae. Our server disappeared after taking our app and drink ordered. Funny how I know? I took pictures of the outdoor seating, drinks, everything, check it out. Never got the servers name, never told us, never cared after Scott stepped in  The good: First off, Scott the manager got on top of our server. After speaking up to the host after not seeing our server for 20 minutes. Great management, Now the food,  Fried zucchini, so tasty, and a great appetizer to have. Long Island ice tea, fantastic, mixed well and not too strong. Jambalaya, tasty, delicious with a small kick of spice, chicken and shrimp in jambalaya was cooked well. Finally a mousse cheesecake, which was nice to share. I'm not the b8ggest fan of their cheesecake, but my gf raves about it. Overall, could've been a giant mess visiting, but the atmosphere, food, and management helped save this review from a poor review."
Lara L.,"Houston, TX",93,86,241,2.0,10/23/2017,"While I usually visit the location in the Woodlands, I sometimes come this locations when I'm in the area. I LOVE Cheesecake Factory but this particular location, it seems as if the wait staff hates their job and doesn't want to be there. The recent time I went, bread was not brought until after we ordered which seems to be the norm here. Not sure, but at other locations, I usually receive the bread right after we order drinks. We had to ask another waitress for refills and more bread. Also, I'm not sure what the deal is, but every time I've come here, it seems as if they cannot get the food of people at the same table to come out together. I had a pizza and salad that came out together which I would have preferred my salad first. But it was almost 6 minutes before my mom received her chicken salad sandwich and salad. How was a pizza ready before a sandwich? After ordering dessert, we paid and ate our dessert and the waitress never came back to see if wanted to take any of our leftovers to go. I had wanted to take the rest of the cheesecake but unfortunately we had to leave the rest of our dessert behind being that the waitress never bothered to come back. Tip: Be sure to ask for easy dressing on the salad or get it on the side. They tend to over do it on the dressing."
Vicky B.,"Round Rock, TX",511,63,108,4.0,12/13/2016,I've been to this location many times but this was the first time I've had such a great waiter and great service!  I came with 2 friends just for cheesecake and so we decided to sit at the high tables near by the bar area and our waiter Ryan H. came by after 10 minutes to get our orders for drinks first. My friend and I ordered hot tea and other friend ordered a sprite. The sprite was brought to us and 2 cups of hot tea but our choice of teas came later and Ryan owned up to taking a long time because of so much going on (there were 3 birthdays and they pulled him to sing happy birthday with the group while he was getting our teas). He didn't charge us for the tea which was so nice!  He brought us a fresh basket of bread and butter and our cheesecakes later which were delicious as always! I didn't finish my cheesecake so I had him box my cheesecake for me and he even gave me whip cream! (not usually included probably because it melts so easily) but I really loved the service and how nice he was! I'd recommend Ryan H. as a waiter for any group party or if you're ever just wanting a great waiter!
Yasser H.,"Houston, TX",931,241,355,3.0,11/7/2016,"Upon arriving at CCF, there were only valet parking spots available, so had to park further away in the target parking lot.  This parking lot is extremely busy as it is part of the memorial city mall plaza. Surprisingly, there was barely a 2-4 minute wait and we were seated. The place was somewhat packed but CCF is fairly big from inside. They have a wide selection of menus with different cuisine choices, and this time around, I was feeling Mexican.   For appetizer, the guacamole n chips. This was not your traditional guacamole that's pasty, but more chunky in texture and a whole lotta tomatoes. I'm not used to having chunky bits of avocados in my guacamole. It was more like a guacamole salad. For main course, chicken fajita tacos with black beans.  Just average tasting meat and beans. I can't really brag about it. The price doesn't justify the quality of food. I was not craving cheesecake for dessert. Overall, just a so so experience. BTW, had to wait an extra 30 mins in restaurant extra, because it was pouring rain outside, and cars were parked further away."
Ann L.,"Houston, TX",578,290,1425,4.0,12/16/2016,"Located by Memorial Mall. Parking on some night can be hard to find especially during the holidays. They do offer valet parking but you can just find yourself parking. Good thing we were seated right away as it wasn't too crowded and we only had 4 people.  We were waiting for the bread to come out since it was complimentary. After a while, we had to ask the waiter for it. It's unlimited refill and it was quite a long wait for the food so we indulged in two trays of bread. The brown bread was pretty good with a sweet taste and the white bread was just your usual bread.  Strawberry daiquiri: About $9. Mixed with rum. It was tasty and a good size with a fresh strawberry on top.  Chicken Chipotle pasta: About $16. The plate was huge and it took two people to finish it. Make sure you mix it together. The sauce was just right.  White chocolate raspberry cheesecake: 7inch. If you want a whole cake then they said it's takes about an hour and a half to thaw out because it's frozen but we still try to eat it anyway."
Arden S.,"Cypress, TX",1,2,,1.0,12/15/2017,Worst service ever!!!! They lost my order and never came to check on our table never got our drinks refilled.  NEver coming back!!!!!!
Athenapex C.,"Houston, TX",41,671,574,2.0,5/29/2017,So I tried to place a take out order And was placed on hold for almost 10 minutes and I thought they forgot me so I called back and was again put On hold for 8 or so minutes and was About to hang up as in total I had Almost Waited 20 Minutes to place a to go order when somebody picked Up.  I spoke with Slyvanna who is apparently one of the manager Because I asked to speak with one and after I told her I had been on hold 20 minutes She just said she was Sorry.  Should have said sorry from the get go.  She told me the food would be ready in 20 minutes which ironically is the same Time it took me to be on hold...this is the first time I have had ever had poor service at a Cheesecake Factory.  Sadly experience has taken away from the food.
Alan H.,"Houston, TX",9,9,4,3.0,5/23/2017,"Its been quite a long time since my last visit, in all sincerity still makes me feel it's overpriced!  Service is their biggest flaw.  Table was dirty and they never took the time to clean after we were done with our meal.. it's just lack of service management need to go around the place to make sure tables look right not like a low profile taqueria.  Server was more interested in getting the tab closed than keeping up with a clean presentable table.  Houston do have better places for sure, specially at this price point."
Pocahantis V.,"Cypress, TX",106,33,13,4.0,9/22/2017,"Love this spot, service a little slow. Got seated quick for a Friday. Sat on the Patio and watched the Friday night movie from the mall, although kids were noisy it was a relaxing atmosphere. The fried macaroni, and egg roll platter hit the spot, topped with a Mai Tai (extra strong). Just what I needed to end a looong tensed week."
Lance S.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2017,Service is bad   Seems they give you a reasonable estimate of wait time just to string you along. 20-25 min seems like a reasonable time to wait but in actuality it's more of an hour wait. But since you've invested 40 minutes of your life what's another 20?  Right?  LOL Setting realistic expectations should be part of the service of a good restaurant.
Asra W.,"Stafford, TX",0,2,4,4.0,10/4/2017,"Cheese cake factory has always been one of my fav restaurants. The food is amazing, the ambiance is relaxing and the service has been great. I wanted to try the oreo cheesecake but was so full from dinner. The portions are pretty big! Will definitely come back again!"
Ahmad Y.,"Houston, TX",1,6,2,1.0,7/31/2017,"Horrible experience. Will never come back here again. The rice in my burrito wasn't even cooked. I felt like I was eating a lunch sandwich. It took them 20 minutes to get our drink, another 20 minutes for the food.  Rude staff. They did nothing about it."
Bernie A.,"Bryan, TX",0,5,2,2.0,11/25/2017,Not very good or expeditious service. Silverware wasn't at table and had to request some after waiting for some period of time. When silverware arrived many utensils were dirty and we had to ask for replacements.   Asked for a waitress change and service improved significantly.  Tipped our new waitress our standard 20% for her excellent service.
Emmanuel A.,"Houston, TX",1,24,6,1.0,8/4/2017,"I have to say, this cheese cake factory is getting worse year by year. We sat out in the patio. The serve lead us to our table and boy the table looked crappy!!! Just imagine you are spending over $12 for each plate and then you are seated in an I cleaned table??? Just a disgrace and terrible, I mean WTF!!! This will be my last!"
Kathy P.,"Nottingham Country, Katy, TX",42,1,,2.0,12/28/2017,"There was a 50 minute wait (which turned into 90 minutes) when we arrived (no reservations were accepted), so we waited in the bar. The bartenders were terrific - honest and efficient, and were the best part of our experience here. As a party of seven we were eventually seated in a booth that uncomfortably sat six. After a significant wait, the food was finally served semi-warm. The waitress asked us to pass hot plates down the booth without the aid of pot holders or other hand protection. We also helped to pass full glasses of water. The food was okay, but definitely not worth the price, the service was sub par, and the restaurant was so noisy we had to raise our voices to be heard at the table. We will not be returning to this restaurant."
Akram H.,"Westside, Houston, TX",1,22,,1.0,7/8/2017,Stopped by to pickup a slice of chocolate fudge cake.  They put it a container which is too small so when you open the container the whole upper layer of chocolate fudge peels off and sticks to the top of the container. Very disappointing considering you pay $9 for a slice of cake.
Paula J.,"South Central Houston, Houston, TX",1,8,6,2.0,10/2/2017,"Horrible service. I came with my family for lunch on my grandma's birthday and we were told there would be a wait of 30 minutes. The one tiny bench available for you to sit while waiting was full of people so after an hour and 15 minutes pass by and my grandma is beyond tired of standing I ask the manager why we still have not been paged for a table, only to have him YELL to me and my family that we could have already been seated and ordering if we weren't wasting time complaining about it. I asked him why they didn't page us if there was already a table ready and available and again he tells us its because we would not shut up. He was super rude and not at all professional and the reason why I'm giving this two starts instead of zero is because our waitress was very helpful and kind."
Vee R.,"Houston, TX",0,14,5,4.0,8/7/2017,"Ordered the tiramisu cheesecake and the cappuccino. Love the cheesecake. The atmosphere was ok. Crowded as always. Sat at the bar, the lady who assisted us very friendly ."
Keandra K.,"Katy, TX",0,18,35,4.0,8/26/2017,A few hiccups but everything turned out well . Couldn't order our favorites due to short staff and bad weather.
Brian D.,"Houston, TX",394,41,143,4.0,1/17/2017,"Great Service at this location when I went! Water was consistently refilled, we were checked on multiple times, and the food was great! I mean----$6 appetizers? And they are like the size of entrees! It's unreal!  We had the buffalo blasts, avocado egg rolls, chicken sliders and potstickers! All of them were delicious and we had all our condiments there at the table without even asking!  I also had a margarita and it was pretty good! Not the best one I've tried but would definitely have it again. I love happy hours and this location and establishment is sure on my list!"
Andy G.,"Cypress, TX",159,26,39,1.0,10/18/2017,Should have known what to expect from the last 2 times we were here..they don't deserve their stars..
Nancy H.,"Richmond, TX",0,6,,5.0,12/21/2017,I would think reviews be higher.  Food is good.  large portions we can share. Service is quick.  Been here a bunch of times. Consistent food every time we been.
Malia R.,"Dallas, TX",498,673,1405,3.0,4/23/2016,"This is your standard Cheesecake Factory location.  I don't know about you, but with Cheesecake Factory.. I don't think I could ever really hate it.  Tons of options, decent pricing considering the portion sizes, and there seems to be a location everywhere.  This location is located in a mall.. not sure the mall name as I'm not local to Houston.  Seemed like a smaller mall though.  Also a hospital was attached, and a Target around the corner.  Parking was pretty nuts.  And we went during lunch time.  Our server, Melissa was pretty nice, attentive.. until of course she sat on our table during a convo with us.. SERIOUSLY? Yes, she really did do that. Weirddd. Also, on a side note.. it's located pretty close to the American Girl store, so they give you little doll seats that clip onto the table so your doll can join you for the meal.  Pretty cute, was the highlight of my daughters lunch.   Other than that, there's not much else to point out.. food is what you'd expect at any other location."
Marc C.,"Webster, TX",79,3,3,1.0,10/27/2017,"As a person who never leaves reviews, (which I probably should more often as I dine in so many amazing restaurants around houston) I was disappointed enough to spend the time to write this one. I am very familiar with quality food and service as I work in one of Houston's top 5 restaurants and love the restaurant industry. Here, the food was disappointing and the service was even worse. My girlfriend made our 6-top reservation for her bestfriend's birthday. I was excited to eat here as I hadn't been in years. Our service wasn't bad too start as our server got to us in a timely fashion and took drink orders. We then moved on to ordering food. I let my server know that I have an onion allergy and would like my burger WITHOUT onions. Our dishes came out, and the first thing I notice in my open burger were onions coming off the side. The server just dropped the plates and ran off. I was able to wave him down after about 3 minutes and tell him. He then took my plate and brought me a new one (which I believe they just pulled the onions off of the same burger) but it's okay. 3 out of the 6 of us ordered burgers with sides of French fries. All 3 of our orders of fries were not only stale, but as you got to the center of them, were literally frozen cold. I'm guessing they use frozen fries which is not a huge problem, but at the very least cook them all the way through. We weren't able to tell our server immediately because he wasn't back for another 15-20 minutes. Once he finally made it back, we told him about the frozen fries. He proceeded to ask if we wanted a replacement or just a different side. Our plates were completely finished (other than the fries that had barely been touched), why would we just want to finally get a fresh side? We told him it was too late as we had already finished our plates. He just started taking our plates to throw away the remainder.  It only gets worse from here.... Before he walks off with the plates, we then told him it was (my girlfriend's bestfriend's) birthday. He says ""oh cool"" and continues clearing plates. He looks at her and asks ""do you want a cheesecake or some type of dessert?"" She says yes that'd be great. He brings her a cheesecake with a candle and sings happy birthday blah blah blah. Immediately after singing, he asks us who's tab is he charging the cheesecake to. Confused, my girlfriend looks up and says just to just add it to ours.  Now I know separate checks can be confusing, but we told him from the beginning to separate the tabs by table (it was the three couples). After some waiting, he finally brings the checks which are literally messed up in every aspect possible. I then asked for a manager to come get it situated and to let them know about everything that had happened during the meal. The manager even took about 20 minutes to come. During that time, the server came back and took the checks to fix them. I know managers can get busy, so not a huge deal. At this time, we're waiting for our fixed checks to come back. I tell the manager about our ENTIRE experience and she says ""Next time you just need to get us involved earlier so we can make sure after the first mess up that you're being taken care of.""  I wasn't aware that if I go out to eat at The Cheesecake Factory, I have to request to be taken care of by a manager just to get a decent meal with decent service. If the staff was trained properly at this establishment, maybe this wouldn't be necessary. Even then, the manager didn't even apologize for our experience. She just turned it around and said that WE needed to get them involved earlier. How pathetic. There will not be a next time. I will never dine at this establishment again. Possibly the worst experience I've ever had at one dinner."
Shekira R.,"Houston, TX",97,7,,1.0,6/25/2017,"Came here (Memorial City location) for lunch and the service was horrible. It took 10-15 mins just to bring waters back to the table and another 10 mins to come back and take our orders and 40 mins for the food to come out! The waiter wasn't friendly at all and when he did eventually come back to our table after the above mentioned times, he rushed us. Pretty sure we never even got his name or a welcome.  To top off this experience, as I'm transferring the rest of my pasta (I didn't eat very much of it - curse of waiting too long to eat and filling up on juice and water) to my to go plate, I see a bug at the bottom. It was under the food: sauce and once moved it crawled around and he plate. I showed the waiter, he took the plate to he manager. The manager came, said ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience, I'll have them look into it"". That's it?!? What are they looking into? Hopefully cleaning their dirty kitchen!  Terrible experience!"
Trey'Vonn G.,"San Francisco, CA",125,15,3,4.0,6/19/2017,"Service was a little off today, (must have been a bad day), but other than that everything else was amazing. We ordered a couple appetizers that were delicious. Not to mention I just found out they have brunch on Sunday's so I'll definitively will have to check it out. I left there far full and satisfied :)"
Kari R.,"Juneau, AK",0,19,11,5.0,10/17/2017,"Kari was very personable. The food was amazing. I had the boom boom chicken and shrimp. So much food and the flavors were incredible! Daughter had the blackened shrimp scampi, lots of food and flavor. Hubby had a steak and mashed potatoes that he was very pleased with. I had a blood orange martini that was good but too sweet for my personal preference. We sat outside and had a lovely time!"
Jeremy T.,"Houston, TX",273,1417,1081,3.0,5/3/2016,"I have been to this location numerous times since I'm in the area a lot.  I usually only come for drinks, apps and dessert though since I hate dining at chains.  I like the egg roll sampler app, just about any of the cheesecakes, and their cocktails are decent but never strong enough.  Their happy hour ends by 6pm, so I usually can never make it on time for that. Service is hit or miss for the most part.  I try to sit in the bar for better service since Im closer to the items I want the most and they have servers in that area as well, but that never seems to help."
