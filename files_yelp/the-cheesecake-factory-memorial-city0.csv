Sean H.,"Katy, TX",0,12,,3.0,8/11/2016,Im a big fan of this place however there were a few kinks in my experience. We were seated quickly but our drinks took a while. My beer had a dead fly floating in it. Given the wait I removed the fly rather than complaining which in hindsight was a mistake. The food was ok but the fly incident had soured the meal. I'll be back but this visit was a fail.
C D.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",0,38,1,2.0,11/19/2015,"Service is horrible at this place. You are put on hold for like 20 mins just to place an order and if you complain about it your told it's not their fault they only have 1 person working.  Once you place your order and was told to come in 30 mins. You get there and wait another 30 mins. And to top it off you don't get any bread because the my ran out and if you want some you have to wait another 20 mins for some.  We ordered the Jamaican black pepper shrimp and Chinese chicken salad.  Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp- was ok, seasoning is very inconsistent. They use to make it better. Shrimps are getting smaller.  Chinese chicken salad- was so good this is the only reason why I gave 2 stars. Portion sizes are huge. Definitely will fill you up."
T P.,"Houston, TX",7,15,15,1.0,2/29/2016,"The food is pretty good at this place, but the dishes ,glasses  and all the flatware on the table looked filthy.   I ordered a sandwich so i wouldnt have to use the fork. Wash your dishes better..."
Lori G.,"Houston, TX",1,27,58,4.0,12/11/2014,"My experience here was very good. The food and our server was very nice and on top of everything. Though we had very simple things here it was awesome. We sat outside and enjoyed a nice and quite dinner. I enjoyed myself and would come back. Great and nice workers here and very clean, which is a plus for me."
Sean M.,"Nederland, TX",0,6,,1.0,7/3/2016,"The worst.  We are a party of 4.  Walk in after being told on the phone there would be no wait and no need to make reservation.  Low and behold, a 20 minute wait after showing up 10 minutes later (not busy at all and many open tables, why the wait?).  The hostess did not crack a smile once and seemed utterly annoyed to be alive.  We get seated in the back at a table with a mosquito infestation.  Waiter arrives and takes our drink order.  Brings them back with 2 incorrect drinks (non-alcoholic).  We order appetizer of crab wontons at 8:45pm.  9:15pm no appetizer and ask the waiter to check.  He comes back and refills my drink with the wrong thing again and no mention of the appetizers.  15 more minutes pass and we go speak to a manager (now 45 minutes since we placed our appetizer order).  We cancel our appetizer with the manager just as it shows up and refuse it.  Manager could not tell us how much longer it would be for main courses to arrive, but acted devastated we canceled our appetizer.  We told him we really don't want to wait any longer for our food since he can't tell us how much longer it would be since we have already been at the restaurant for over an hour with NO FOOD (except for 3 cold slices of bread that was never refilled).  Decide to leave.  Manager drops head and sighs deeply in disappointment.  He apologizes.  Only offered to comp our appetizer, but by that point we didn't feel like getting stung by any more mosquitoes and drink the wrong drink while waiting for who knows how long for entrees.  A shame because we've had great service here before.  Oh well, guess we came on a bad night."
JP S.,"Concord, CA",14,19,13,5.0,10/22/2014,"I have been a loyal customer of Cheesecake Factory and this past weekend reminded me why. I tried their factory nachos and their buffalo burger...it was great. My favorite dish is the miso salmon, best salmon dish I've had in a restaurant chain. I've most things from the regular menu and their brunch menu and you will not be disappointed ever! Oh and if you ever have room for dessert (I recommend you share a plate or ask for the lunch portion) try one their cheesecakes of course. The carrot cake is great too!"
Redskull D.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/27/2014,"My first time trying this place out. DISAPPOINTED!!!!!, silverwear was dirty I ask the server to give me another set and it was dirty as well. If silverwear are dirty just imagine the glasses and plates. Wow, The General manager came by and just gave me excuses,  he blame that to the person that clean and polish their silverwear.!! That just tells me that no manager takes a minute to check if thier stuff are clean.. Won't never go to a cheese factory ever again."
Jennifer S.,"Fort Worth, TX",66,129,157,2.0,3/19/2014,"While the atmosphere and service was decent here- my tomato and chicken pasta was abysmal. The tomato sauce- advertised as creamy and rice in Tuscan spices- was more like tomato water. It ran through my noodles and pooled at the bottom of my bowl. And it was weird spicy... Almost too spicy to eat. There wasn't very much chicken, but it really seems like thin slices of chicken breasts that had been boiled and then had the tomato water poured over it. The noodles themselves were okay... there were way too many of them, and they didn't have any flavor but at least they were cooked al dente.  For almost a $15 entree, this was super disappointing."
Yas C.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,7/17/2016,What the hell is wrong with your to-go service?!! I've been waiting for over 40min for a pick-up that should take 15min (that's what they told me)! And it's not the first time that I had to wait for a simple to-go order! The last time I talked to the manager bc I waited 20 min just to have a cheesecake! A cheesecake that was ready and sitting on the counter! But nobody cares to give the order to the customer!!! And the manager only apologized and promised to watch it next time. This time our food was ready at the kitchen and wasn't given until I had to ask a random server to go check on it in the kitchen. The chain of communication is badly broken for their to-go orders!
Sophie G.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,2.0,7/17/2016,The service was so bad there our waitress was not attentive had to flag several waiters to get service. Repeatedly asked our waitress for silverware. Appetizers and Dishes all came at the same time.
J M.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,2.0,6/5/2016,Unaccomodating to people with disabilities. Manager is a jerk! Made a 93 year old get up from a table and climb up on a bar stool. Unprofessional behavior!
Khanh T.,"Houston, TX",95,8,9,1.0,5/31/2015,"This was the second time I have been here the first time was great. Last night I had arrived and was greeted sat down to notice the bread had mold in it, so I ask the waitress if it was herbs in it she replied and ran off didn't even bother to help me until I waited until she came back. The place wasn't even busy terrible service. So we get the food which came out 10 minutes no issue. Get home to experience stomach aches. Thanks not coming back again"
Mishal H.,"Sugar Land, TX",26,33,36,2.0,2/27/2014,"Everything was going well until my boyfriend and i ordered water as our drinks. My water was half sprite and half water, i know this because it contained a minimal amount of bubbles and my boyfriend and i could clearly taste the sprite. The disgusting part was that I ORDERED WATER. Did my server just use an old glass of someone else's beverage that he presumed was water and refill it? Because i also noticed greasy finger smudges.... i hadn't had food yet so those weren't mine.   When we informed the server, all he said was ""my bad"". My next glass of water smelt like fish. Maybe i just became sensitive because i was traumatised by the sprite water. Our food was good, my fish and chips were bland. Boyfriend enjoyed his pizza. If i ever come back, it'll be for the cheese cake."
Brian S.,"Houston, TX",0,22,4,4.0,8/21/2015,"We eat here all the time as we live nearby. We avoid busy evenings. I have lived in two different states and every cheesecake factory I have been to in both states gets really busy especially on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings. So the people that complain about this location being busy must not have been to a cheesecake factory that many times. Maybe they should try an olive garden and sit outside on the curb with the other 30 people waiting for a table.  The service is mostly good. However, from time to time we have had a weird waiter who didnt seem to like his/her job. The food quality is mostly consistent. The managers are always present to resolve any issues and seem to be very hands on.  They also have Gluten Free options which is very convenient.  Although there are many choices in restaurants in this area, we enjoy keeping this location as one of the restaurants that we eat at regularly."
Michelle D.,"Glendale, WI",157,394,61,2.0,2/26/2014,"Meh. Came here for a work lunch - I did not pick the place. I was happy to see they had implemented a low cal menu, but you'll see how that turned out... Pros: Service - we had a large group and no one ever waited long for drink refills or food. Guacamole - got the medium spice level and it was solid. The chips were soaked in grease though.  Cons: Entree - got the pear and endive salad and it was awful. The portion was huge, but there was no point in it being that big because whatever was in the dressing was inedible! This may sound weird, but I couldn't tell what it was that was making it so harsh on the palette...I think it was salt but someone said they tasted raw celery or onion. It was just overwhelming. I had a few bites because I was hungry then I put my fork down because the whole thing was just soaked in this dressing. That's what I get for ordering off of the light menu I guess. Luckily for them I don't normally come here so it's not like they lost a regular customer. Just remember to get dressing on the side if you get a salad."
Fred G.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,4,2,1.0,6/25/2016,Let me first start with I travel a lot!!!! And I frequent the Cheesecake Factory  often! My go to is the jambalaya!!! So that what I got this time and it was the worst I have ever had the noodles were had a fun slimy texture to them!!! But the cheesecake was still on point!!!
Mike S.,"Lahaina, HI",0,4,,3.0,6/15/2015,Great food.  Poor service.  As usual!  You can definitely find better service for the price you pay elsewhere.
Jane D.,"Spring, TX",2,8,,3.0,5/16/2015,"I have been to 3 other locations in Houston alone, and this one is subpar. Service is slow and the food is only average.  For their high prices, I expected the level of other Cheesecake Factory restaurants and did not get it here. Refills are difficult to get,  food takes forever to arrive even when they are slow, and ambiance is lacking. Plan ahead and go to another location if you can!"
Jess C.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2015,I went yesterday and boy was it bad. I asked for an appetizer idk how long it took but it took a long time to come 2 bad part i had to tell my waiter better yet remind him about it.only to be told oh...yeah...its coming and i saw him put it in after.Another thing and i know they sometimes do it.But the waitress from another table had to come and ask if i wanted a refill.which was ok but our waiter kept avoiding pur   usually the type that wont make eye contact when talking but last night i did. again waiter kept looking away it was very rude of him.then i wasnt feeling good from the time it took to get our drinks to our appetizer so by the time my plate came i just had a small bit and asked for it to go.only to realize at home half of my food was not even on the box.  I always tell people to go here since the few 2 or 3 times ive gone have been pleasant.but might be thinking bout that one with this new experience.
Kelsey K.,"Sugar Land, TX",21,5,,2.0,3/19/2015,"It's been a long time since I've been to a Cheesecake Factory, and I don't think I'll bother coming back here any time soon. The two hostesses completely ignored my friend and I when we first walked in and stood right in front of their counter.  It took a manager to finally point to us before one of the ladies decided she wanted to help us.  The wait time was about 5 min which isn't too bad for 9:00 PM on a Thursday night.  The silverware and plates they brought were dirty and had baked on food. We placed our drink orders (2 waters) which took 15 min for us to get because the waitress said she was ""waiting on water glasses."" The food left a lot to be desired and was incredibly mediocre. As a college student, I have to be prudent with where I spend my money and I would not recommend coming here to spend an average of $15 on a meal that can only be described as edible."
