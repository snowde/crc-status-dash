Diane T.,"Houston, TX",21,22,40,1.0,12/20/2016,We walked in at 11:15 am. It is now 12:21 pm and we still don't have our food. There was hardly anyone here when we walked in so I'm not sure what the problem is. Our server has been apologetic but geez.....I don't think I'll be back.
Lauren F.,"Houston, TX",58,72,12,1.0,1/16/2017,"Not too thrilled with my pick up order... Food seemed cold by the time I picked it up, despite saying I wanted the order to go in later, since I wouldn't be there in the estimated 20 minutes it took to make. Ordered the zucchini fries, and it didn't seem like a whole lot for the price and I didn't even get any bread, which the girl on the phone said I would get with the order. Probably won't be back to this location anytime soon."
Kim J.,"Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands",0,6,,1.0,8/13/2017,"Horrible.  The people that work here do not care about the product or the reputation that Cheesecake Factory has built.   MANAGEMENT: you have a serious training opportunity.  Here's our experience, which started when I called in advance to try to reserve a table for 5 that was wheelchair accessible.  The girl that answered the phone said, let me check and proceeded to place me on hold for over 20 minutes...she never came back to the call (I ended up hanging up after 25 minutes of hold music.). When we arrived, the hostess did not care what kind of table we had tried to reserve.  They told me take this booth or you'll have to wait for maybe 35 minutes.  There were several empty tables throughout.  We took the offered booth that was of course right next to the kitchen where the employees were slamming dishes around without any regard to the paying customers within a few feet.  There is a way to unload dirty dishes that does not include throwing them into a bin.  We waiting for 10 min before we even saw our server.  Another 5 once he came to get ice tea and waters.  We placed our order and the server read it back to us.  I ordered a veggie burger, when he read back turkey burger, I corrected him and he acknowledged he heard.  I had to ask numerous times for bread and when it came, only 3 packages of butter for 5 people.  Food shows up, guess what?!  A turkey burger was put in front of me.  I informed the guy that I had ordered a veggie burger.  He went back to kitchen with the turkey burger.  Our server came back and realized his mistake...our table was just about done eating when my under cooked, soggy veggie burger showed up.  The server tried to correct it by talking too much and trying to clear dishes while we were still eating.  I asked for a box, as everyone was done eating.  A box never came.  No apologies, no ""hey let us get your dessert"", nothing.   I don't think we would have accepted it, but just the gesture would have been nice.  On our way out we stopped to get a couple of slices of cheesecake to go.  After standing at the counter waiting to be acknowledged, we were finally able to get cheesecake to go.  The lady boxed it, put it on the counter and walked away.  We waited another 5 minutes for someone to ring us up (which only happened after we asked 2 employees at the dessert counter to pay.). We simply want service where the employees care about the business.  Not here.  We won't be back."
Michelle S.,"Westside, Houston, TX",9,1,,1.0,8/18/2017,I dined there with family and friends and I got sick with the dish I ate so I contacted the manager during the day (Scott) and he told me sorry about the bad experience that he would tell the night manager and that whenever you're in the area to come to dine come and get a slice of cheesecake on him well I went to go dine there today with my friend Angela and I mention about the slice of cheesecake on him he didn't honor it he says well we sent you a $25 gift card so that should be enough. I felt very insulted because that was not what he had initially told me come get a slice of cheesecake on him plus we're going to send you something in the mail when I got there he reneged on his deal so he's going to lose two customers because of a $8.95 slice of cheesecake so sad. I guess he has selective memory
Gerard Y.,"San Francisco, CA",215,1086,390,4.0,9/15/2015,"My parents' were in town and they had gift cards for this place so I decided to check it out since I love cheesecake. It wasn't too busy on a weekend evening. I ordered a bacon bacon cheeseburger which I had cooked to medium and it was good. I wish I ordered something smaller though to save room for more cheesecake. I ordered a slice of Godiva cheesecake and it was so creamy and good. Our waiter, forgot his name, was friendly and always checked on us."
Ric B.,"Harlingen, TX",7,1,1,2.0,8/10/2016,"The service was good they just took forever to get the food to us, and even longer to get the check."
Ariel D.,"Houston, TX",0,48,17,2.0,1/7/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory location is well below the standards of the chain and subpar compared to other restaurants. We went on a slow Friday night and the restaurant wasn't clean at all. The floors were sticky, the tables weren't in good condition, and when we got ready to leave a baby roach started crawling up the booth where my friends were sitting. The women's bathrooms were deplorable with used feminine hygiene products out in the open and blood in the toilets unflushed. Clearly no one was tending to the restrooms.  Our waitress was fun but her mouth was too big. She looked at my friend who is of middle eastern decent and asked him if he was okay with the pork in the dish we ordered. I think she thought she was being helpful but that was a unwarranted and presumptuously racist comment. He had not specified that he had any dietary restrictions.  There was lots of confusion with our order apparently as several people came by asking what we had ordered. This was quite ridiculous because we only ordered two or three things. And the food and drinks came out slowly. Again, there weren't many people there. I tried to bring the issues to the manager's attention but he behaved as though couldn't care less. I wouldn't recommend this location at all."
Kimberly N.,"Katy, TX",99,33,,5.0,7/1/2017,"Wonderful experience!!! I took 9 girls out for dinner, they all ate off the children's menu and my bill was so affordable. My waitress was awesome. The girls had a wonderful time and the food was great!!! Won't ever stop visiting this location"
Mimi S.,"Fulshear, TX",53,19,,2.0,12/31/2016,"Good food service is TERRIBLE! We love the Cheesecake Factory but since we moved to Houston, we have been gravely disappointed in the consistent level of less than ""average"" service. My recommendation, get your food to go."
Crystal N.,"Houston, TX",0,8,3,3.0,8/1/2016,"The wait was about 45 minutes, as expected especially when cheesecake was half off! Im not sure what our servers name was while ordering/eating, she didn't introduce herself. Staff is very busy so they aren't as attentive, so you're trying to get their attention more than they try to pay yours.  We ordered the buffalo blast and two cheesecake, mango and white chocolate w/ caramel. Our accompanying friends ordered a buffalo blast as well along with a steak and fried macaroni app. Our food came out first (even the cheese cake). Buffalo blast was yummy, this is an app BUT they're so big it can be an entree for two. Spicy and yummy (chicken mixed with buffalo sauce with a fried wrap around it served with buffalo sauce and blue cheese). Fried Mac was never brought out, and once our friends medium well steak came it was the beginning to an end. Steak was BLOODY red, very rare, we made our server aware and she got a new one but my friend got it to go due to loss of appetite (that happens when you wait so long for food and when you get it it's not what you expect). So he also ordered two cheesecakes to go. Everything was brought out BUT the steak and the server almost let us go home without it had we not double checked.  I could see following tables were having trouble reaching their servers as well, maybe introducing themselves to their guest would be easier rather than guest having to wait on their servers. I figured out our servers name from the ticket and from there I could address her. Would be 5 stars for food but 3 is for service. Cheesecake was delicious!"
Adrian F.,"Houston, TX",158,66,201,5.0,6/16/2016,"The service was great. The waiters and waitresses are always on point with their customer service skills, they take note and pay attention to their tables. When our water/teas were low, they topped them off. When the bread started to disappear, they refilled the basket.  Ordered the santa fe chicken salad, simply because I really like the cilantro dressing it comes with. Also had the avocado eggrolls and calamari. The portions are big, but you can also ask for a lunch portion if you want.  For dessert, had the traditional strawberry cheesecake...mmmmm. You cant leave cheesecake factory without a cheesecake. Simply delicious.."
Veronica E.,"Houston, TX",24,5,9,5.0,7/16/2015,7/15/15 Celebrated a friends birthday there. Very pleasant atomasphere.  Staff was friendly & our waiter was great and polite. Would recommend coming here to this location.
Stephanie C.,"Boston, MA",206,206,526,3.0,8/28/2015,"Went here for dinner with my mom, since we had a gift card. To be honest, the only thing I really like about CF is the cheesecake, but their massive entree menu always gives me reason to believe that I'll find a diamond in the rough.  This time, I put my bet on the fish tacos, which I ordered fried. I envisioned a light, crunchy, and flavorful snack, but I should have known better. My enormous platter came loaded with four fish tacos, each tucked to the brim with a large and greasy battered fish nugget on a bed of mayo-saturated veggies. The taco shells consisted of two soft corn shells each, which I understand for the purpose structural integrity. However, all of this amounted to an overwhelming amount of subpar food for me. The tacos really could have used some crunchier veggies and maybe a tangy dipping sauce like salsa to brighten them up. Also, there was guac in the tacos, but so little that they might as well have left it out. The dish came with unexciting sides of black beans and dry, hard herbed rice. My mom ordered the Chicken Madeira, which really fared no better. We could only each finish half of our meal, and even at that point were close to exploding.  The cheesecake was the saving grace of the meal, as expected. I got an Oreo extreme dream cheesecake, and yes, it was as dense and uber rich as it sounds, but it was well worth it. Awesome choice if you love chocolate! And I'm not afraid to admit that my favorite part is always the whipped cream.  The service was aight. The waiters were busy as usual, but tended to us in good time and were polite.  If you're looking to have dinner here, I suggest the glam burgers or something off the skinnylicious menu, as otherwise the food is not really worth the calories. Otherwise, just forgo the entree and cut straight to the real reason this place exists: the glorious cheesecake.  Tl;dr: Portions are huge, food is greasy, but cheesecake is solid."
Mike V.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,1.0,12/8/2016,"Stay away! Terrible. Terrible service, made a reservation for my daughter and 17 friends. They showed up and were told that the restaurant had cancelled the reservation. Very rude, unfriendly staff. We to State Fare, which was fantastic.  Stay away!"
No C.,"Marina del Rey, CA",1,94,68,4.0,6/5/2016,"I have been here many times and i am almost always impressed. I feel like they give you large portions, so its worth the cost. My favorites entrees are the stuffed chicken tortillas, chicken Marsala, and chicken and biscuts. I recently went and got an omelette which was high and delicious."
Alexandria B.,"Houston, TX",194,50,134,1.0,8/20/2016,Waited for a table for a large party for over an hour so I called and was told that the wait would be an additional 30-45 minutes. Management never once approached our group to let us know what the status was. No one offered us water or anything. It's hot as H-E-double-hockey sticks in here and I'm soooo irritated at the customer service. Luckily I'm here for a friend's celebration dinner or else I woulda been walked out.
Juan G.,"Northwest Houston, Houston, TX",262,2,,1.0,1/4/2017,This is probably the smallest slice of cheesecake I have ever seen. Lost a customer forever.
Derek C.,"Houston, TX",84,53,31,1.0,11/12/2016,Horrible experience. Stay away from this place if your young and black. People were sat after our table and somehow got served before us (I guess because they were white). We Sat at our table for over 45 mins and didn't even get a piece of bread. Very disappointed in this place. This place ruined the whole date night. My girlfriend is a doctor so her off days are very limited and we wasted over 2hrs total at this Cheesecake Factory from difficulty in parking to waiting for a seat to being served which never happened. I will never come back to this place.
Vanessa T.,"Houston, TX",0,11,14,3.0,11/16/2016,The service was okay  the view is awesome. The food was good if they don't give me and my boyfriend diarrhea  this is gross but CCF wash your hands before touch the food please!!!
Glennisha F.,"Houston, TX",96,19,4,1.0,11/12/2016,"Would give 0 stars if I could. Finding parking was horrible. Then once we got in we were seated fairly quickly considering how busy it was however we sat and waited for over 45 mins and didn't even receive a piece of bread. On top of that multiple tables that were sat after us received their meals before we even got bread. The experience completely ruined my boyfriend and I's date night, as we wasted so much time sitting and waiting and never received any food. I understand it may have been a busy night but this was completely unacceptable."
