Sarah P.,"Houston, TX",106,183,229,4.0,1/16/2015,"First time at this location was a memorable one: I had the cheesecake for the first time ... I'm crazy.  Lemon Garlic Shrimp from the Skinny Menu (4/5) Very good, but of course, since it was off the skinny menu, it was small. Four stars bc my friend ordered the same thing from the skinny menu and almost got triple the amount of food that I got. Not a fan of inconsistency.  Tiramisu Cheesecake (10/5) !!!!!!!!!! OHMYGAWD!!!!! Desserts from God himself ... Wowowowow  I'd give this place 5 star rating if I was judging based on cheesecake, but the service was a little poor."
Rosa B.,"Westside, Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,6/8/2017,"Our worst experience in a Restaurant! We visited the Cheesecake Factory at Memorial Mall on Sunday May 28. We arrived around 6:45pm and requested a table for three. They told us the waiting time will be 30 minutes, so we decided to wait at the bar. We made the order and waited and waited...Our drinks were prepared 1 hour later, when we finally got the table. At this point we declined them.  The server at the restaurant didn't provided a good service either. The bread came with melted butter, because according to her they were frozen..?! She wasn't polite, and commented that it was a graduation weekend, so we were supposed to be understanding of their delay and bad service-- or incompetence--Everything was a disaster: the menus at the table ere sticky, the meal options description was terrible, and lastly the manager was impolite when my husband complained about his salty meal. We used to visit this place years ago, and seems the old staff is not longer there... It was very disappointed to have such a bad experience this time. I don't think we will return."
Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,4.0,11/6/2013,"I should have looooooong reviewed TCF!  I go here at least 3/4x a month.  We go here on our own, we come for team lunches...I'm no stranger to this place. I love many things about TCF; the atmosphere; especially the patio on a chill day!  The service has never failed me and the cheesecake damn sho never fails.  The food sometimes does, the salmon and shrimp scampi combo really failed me but that's later. As far as the apps, I've tried the avocado egg rolls and the fried cheese.  I wouldn't bother with either; over priced, not worth it and most importantly, not all that good. My go to dish is always the lemon herb roasted chicken: half a chicken + carrots + mashed potatoes.  All delicious but if you're not a lemony person, I wouldn't get this. I've tried the salads; the lunch portions are huge, you honestly can share them $5pp....cheap lunch.  They can be rather bland though :( womp womp the bbq chicken really wasn't on point; the cobb is decent but ask for extra dressing. I've had a few other OK dishes; shrimp platter, chicken maderia...legit no major complaints but then comes the salmon and shrimp scampi which was surprisingly bland for $20! This food made me uber sick...I'm talking running to the bathroom multiple times sick.  It was not pretty in the least! If that was my first time going, I would have never returned to this place no matter what but I can guarantee I'm not ordering any seafood from here again!!!!!!!!! The wheat bread is the only one I eat....swoons and drools! Now the most important reason for coming, the actual cheesecake. Kahlua cocoa coffee is my ultimate favorite; can't nothing or no other flavor beat it.  The strawberry is legit; the blueberry (why would anyone order this but the nut jobs I work with did and it was just ok), the oreo dream is good and the smore's is up there close second to the kahlua...effin delicious as well.  Both of those are entirely too rich; no point eating in one sitting! Speaking of bathrooms; they really should invest in some hand napkins! I hate those put your hands in here and I'll blow the water off devices.  I don't touch bathroom doors; who is still doing that in 2013! TCF needs to get with it...bump that paper conservation bullshiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!"
Lina M.,"Omaha, NE",1,2,,2.0,4/14/2017,"Where can I start? The minute we sat we got a waitress asking if we have been helped yet and then brought us the menu and our drinks. She literally disappeared for the next 15 minutes and no one came to take our order. We actually had to signal another waiter so they can take our food order. A third waiter came with our appetizers but didn't know what table they belonged to, so I watched him ask two tables if they ordered the plate before a forth waiter told him it belonged to our table. The food finally came extremely salty, dry and the chicken was almost burned. I should also mention that the actual menus weren't taken from our tables and sat there for the entire duration we were there, until the fifth waiter came to pick them up with along with the check. Oh and while I was singing the receipt, the third waiter came back with a plate belonging to the table next to ours thinking we ordered it, and I literally had to show him which table the food belonged to. The complementary bread never came either."
Deep S.,"Houston, TX",1,52,9,4.0,9/27/2016,Been to Cheesecake Factory so many times... I usually always get the bang bang chicken and shrimp which is always good. I tried the mac and cheese burger definitely a miss... its not what you would expect. It sounds great but when you actually get it it's a disappointment. Cheesecakes are always great I had the pecan turtle cheesecake. You can't go wrong with desserts here. The avocado egg rolls are really good. My husband loves their lettuce wraps.
Melanie H.,"Houston, TX",243,452,600,5.0,1/13/2015,"It's The Cheesecake Factory! What could go wrong? If I were one of those people who could eat whatever they wanted and never gain weight, I would eat at The Cheesecake Factory at least once a week. Their food is loaded with fat, cheese, and sugar and it's DELICIOUS! Alas, I am not one of those aforementioned naturally skinny people, so the Skinny Menu allows me to feel somewhat better about myself before I devour a massive, gluttonous, whipped cream covered piece of cheesecake.  Seriously though, the Skinny Menu has lots of delicious options and seems like a good balance when you know you're going to indulge in dessert.  Or every once in a while, just give in and have a decadent entree AND dessert (you can for sure have leftovers of both - portions are HUGE).  The complimentary brown bread is also worth the calories (skip the white bread).  And for the massive portions, I feel as though the prices are right. And the staff are always so nice. Parking here can be a PAIN, but that's because it's part of the mall. Mmmmmmmm, I love The Cheesecake Factory."
Kim N.,"Houston, TX",0,17,21,3.0,6/15/2015,My go to item is their cashew chicken salad.  I don't know if they modify or change their recipe but today it look and taste totally different.  The lettuce was shredded into such small pieces that it losts it crunch.   Service was good and appetizer bread they give is always  good (especially the chocolate? color one).  It was 30 min wait for our table and another 35 minutes for our food (we arived at 7pm).  Usually food come out fast but not with this visit.  Its a hit or miss.  Parking sucks.  Be prepare to park far or drive around few minutes.  They do have valet.
Temperance G.,"Houston, TX",32,41,6,5.0,9/12/2016,"This was first time every going. Datenight was extremely beautiful and it was so unexpected and such a big suprise. We went to Studio Movie Grill, then we came to have dinner here. It has a nice ambiance and the staff was great. After we ate our dinner we order the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cheesecake and the funniest thing happened. So when the dessert arrived Jeremy asked me to come sit next to him and the manager that brought us dessert says, ""nice that's how you do it"". I died of laughter. Any ways great place to dine at for a date or with friends or even if you are treating yourself. Will go again."
Kathy W.,"Houston, TX",17,2,,2.0,4/8/2017,"Our family normally loves The Cheesecake Factory, but today was a fail.  It started well; we were seated promptly and hostess was very nice.  Once seated though, it all changed.  It took quite some time to be greeted once seated, and our waiter's breath was so bad that all 4 of us had to turn our heads.  We ordered and proceeded to wait over 45 minutes with no update.  We were finally able to flag down the waiter to ask about our food.  The manager showed up to tell us that our order had not been sent to the kitchen, but she had now put it in as a rush.  She also offered free dessert.  By the time our food arrived, it was well over an hour since we had ordered.  The food was tasty and well presented.  When we were done eating, we then waited for quite some time without even being checked on.  We had to again flag down another waiter and ask for service.  We ordered dessert, but the dirty dishes still were not cleared away.  Even when dessert came, we had to ask that the dirty dishes be taken away from the meal.  What in the world??  2 free desserts and 25% off our meal was definitely worth the hassle today."
Juan M.,"El Paso, TX",4,45,59,4.0,12/21/2015,"Great service, great taste, amazing portions. My daughter ordered a pasta and she didn't even finish half of it. Although, the place is way to dark my wife almost tripped. The cheesecake was huge and delicious. We are definitely coming back"
Kernita B.,"Humble, TX",18,25,27,3.0,10/18/2015,"I've visited this location many times. Today service was awful. I waited 20 minutes before anyone realized I wasn't  part of the decor and I actually wanted a meal. No fuss, because I was waiting on my husband to join me. We ordered drinks...mine came out on time and his took another 30 minutes to arrive. We stayed seated for an hour and 15 minutes and probably spent 25 minutes actually eating. Great food....poor service."
Frank G.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,5.0,4/21/2017,"Great place, wait staff was 1st class, food was excellent and there are lots of choices. Cheesecake always the best."
Donna L.,"Houston, TX",1,17,2,2.0,9/23/2015,"I need to start off by saying that CF has always been my solid go-to restaurant. Hungry but not sure what I want? CF's huge menu would satisfy any craving from super sweet to savory. In general, all their franchises serve pretty good food - not great but pretty consistent.  Here was the problem with tonight's visit. Went with a friend, had grilled artichokes, avocado salad, miso salmon, decaf coffee and 30th anniversary chocolate cheesecake.  All the food was OK. We were not offered bread but then again, I could have just asked for it. Then came the bill.... I couldn't help but notice a glaring tipping guide highlighted in bright orange. For me, this was very odd. Out of everything, my server felt the need to highlight the tipping guide. I don't know why she felt the need to do this so I kindly asked for a manager. I asked the manager if it was customary for waiters to highlight the bills. She said yes. I asked which particular parts are typically highlighted. She said the tipping guide! Then she went on to explain to me that since Obama got rid of the mandatory service charges of parties over 6, they started to highlight the tipping guide. I didn't quite understand the reasoning or explanation but verified that all the servers typically highlight it for everyone regardless of party size. There is no way to see if she's telling the truth but I'd like to know if other yelpers have seen this before. Perhaps I'm just making a big deal over nothing? Here's what really gets me. My server highlighted the tipping guide on all 3 copies of my bill. It didn't sit well with me and left a very bad taste in my mouth. There are not many times where I feel openly discriminated, but in this case, I felt like I was given a tipping lesson and for what reason? I thanked the manager for verifying that this is the restaurant's normal practice. The waiter came back and very abruptly said ""I'm sorry if I offended you"". I said ""no, you shouldn't be sorry. Your manager just confirmed that your restaurant does this with all the tables. I just don't really understand why"". She said that it saves the customer time from having to pull out their phone and calculate the tip. I told her even if she didn't highlight it, it is very obvious on the bill.  All in all, if everyone is treated like this, I think CF should rethink their policies. It's just not professional and really lacks class. I know it's not a 5 star restaurant but does it need to be this way?"
Jordan H.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,2.0,4/14/2017,"Sadly, I will not be returning with children. We were the second people to walk in at 11am when they opened today (Friday morning). We had five adults and three children. They sat us quickly, brought bread after about 10 min and had us order drinks. After about 20 min we ordered. We ordered 4 adult meals (my husband and I shared) and three kids meals, plus a ""small plate"". After we'd been there an hour, the 3 kids meals and small plate arrived. Our four adult meals didn't arrive for another 35 min! The kids were done and over it! We were at the restaurant for over two hours. They told us it took so long because I ordered the fish tacos and because I asked for two tempura and two grilled (rather than all cooked the same).... really?! They said they don't normally do that, even though that's how I order it every time I go. In addition, we went into the bathroom to use the two metal changing tables and one was extremely dangerous. My friend dropped a diaper and pushed it up to grab it and the metal bed slammed her in the face. Her nose immediately swelled and the restaurant brought her ice. Thank God it wasn't one of the babies! Again, we will not be bringing children here again."
Christopher J.,"Lake Terrace, New Orleans, LA",109,690,237,4.0,12/30/2014,"I had a work meeting in Houston (BLEH) and was staying at the Westin across the street.  I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory, and they love it on Big Bang Theory, so I figured what the heck!?  My SO was with me (I turned the trip into a vacation following the meeting) so we walked on over after deciding we didn't want to venture too far. I had the Thai Lettuce Wraps to start.  THEY GIVE YOU SO MUCH!!!  And the plate is build-your-own.  So they just give you a ton of Satay Chicken Strips, Carrots, Bean Sprouts, Coconut Curry Noodles, and Lettuce Leaves with three Sauces - Peanut, Sweet Red Chili and Tamarind-Cashew.  It's soooo goood.  I love that I cold pick and choose what to put in my wraps. I then had the Chicken Madeira and Steak Diane combination, which came with Mashed Potatoes.  It was just the right amount of each, and it tasted pretty darn good.  However, the steak was a little overdone for my liking. For dessert, I had the Lemoncello Creme Torte - Layers of Vanilla Cake and Lemon Mascarpone Cream Topped with Streusel and Served with Strawberries and Whipped Cream.  I know, I didn't get cheesecake.  But this sounded delicious!  And it was.  I'm a sucker for lemon and this sucked me right in. For a chain restaurant, this Cheesecake Factory did not disappoint."
Brandi B.,"Houston, TX",143,80,201,3.0,10/12/2015,Always packed so prepare yourself! They offer valet for a fee and depending on when you go its probably your best bet cause the malls parking lot is over crowded always. I've had some good food and bad food from here but what keeps me coming back is the cheesecake!! Love their cheesecake. I like the red velvet but the Oreo is by far my favorite.
Brian M.,"Montgomery, TX",0,12,,1.0,12/11/2015,"Service was good, but the food was terrible.  Both of our chicken dishes tasted fishy.  My chicken and biscuits plate was a mess, with grease instead of gravy and burnt, dry biscuits.  I usually love that dish.  It was clear both dishes sat under a heat lamp, the plates were hot but the food was luke warm with a thick film on the sauces. Terrible quality on the food, bad taste, and disgusting appearance (greasy with a thick film). Never going back to this location."
Beto A.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,3,,2.0,2/21/2016,This is the worst Cheesecake Factory ever!!! Tip # 1 ask if the have any ground turkey because they don't tell until you order a skinny turkey burger.  Tip # 2 ask for complimentary sourdough bread because waitress doesn't  just bring it to you. Tip # 3 make sure you bring your own toilet paper Becau every stall in women's bathroom was out. Tip # 4 Its worth the drive to the one in Sugar Land.
Matt R.,"New Orleans, LA",521,512,289,2.0,7/26/2014,"I like Cheesecake Factory... but not so much this one in Memorial City.  I went with my wife and two kids for a Saturday night dinner. We arrived at the mall and, of course, could't find a parking spot after driving around for 15 minutes. So, we ended up paying $10 for valet... that's right, $10.  After finally making it into the restaurant, we should have just left at that point... it was sweltering hot in there, which we found out later was due to the fact that the restaurant's main A/C unit was broken. But, we were looking forward to some CF food all week, so we stuck it out. The hostess told us the wait would be about 20-30 minutes. It was over an hour... waiting in the sweltering heat.  As we were waiting to be seated, I couldn't help but look around... and I was not real keen on the crowd that was in the restaurant. There were people there in wife-beaters and flip flops... just seemed trashy.  I will say that the wait staff was excellent... the bartender that waited on us for the hour before we were finally seated was pleasant and the waiter we had was very attentive and nice.  The food was ok, and really just not as good as I've had at other locations. For the main course, I had the chicken chipotle pasta. It was pretty tasty, but lacking in a few areas... the asparagus, for instance, was clearly undercooked. I had to eat around it and then found myself wishing that they had made it correctly becuase the dish lacked without it.  We were so uncomfortable, we ended the dinner abruptly and skipped out on the cheesecake... I doubt we will ever return to this location.  BOTTOM LINE: Not the best Cheesecake Factory... I would drive out to the Woodlands or to the Galleria locations before returning to this one."
Taylor W.,"Houston, TX",11,16,42,2.0,7/29/2015,"I heard half priced cheesecake and I got excited, BUT the trip out to Memorial City definitely wasn't worth saving $4 on cheesecake.  When we arrived the place was packed, which is too be expected at 7:30 dinner time. We waited 30 minutes for a table for 2 and when our table ready buzzer went off, we waited an additional 10 minutes for the hostesses to seat other tables and finally get to our ticket. The waitress was pretty nice. She mentioned her name but not loud or clear enough for me to remember. Her service was fair. Check on our table as much as needed. She only forgot one item and that's when I requested additional bread for the table. I had to remind her, but it quickly arrived shortly after. We sat next to the bar area at a small table along the mirrored back seating. One of my biggest pet peeves at restaurant is having the tables too close together! I could hear the entire conversation being held at the table next to us and I could have enjoyed my dinner a little bit more if I didn't have to listen to who the young lady was dating and why.  The food was very mediocre. I've had the Buffalo Blast a few times at the Galleria location and had my heart set on getting those, but of course after I order the waitress comes back with disheartening news that they were out. I settled for the chicken parmesan sandwich and I would have been happier with a spicy chicken sandwich form Chickfila. It was unseasoned and came with almost nothing on it. I was so disappointed. The only thing I enjoyed was the wheat table bread.  I ordered my half priced cheesecake togo and learned a valuable lesson, every deal isn't always worth it."
