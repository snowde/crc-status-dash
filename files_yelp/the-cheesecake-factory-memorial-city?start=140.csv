Tam M.,"Missouri City, TX",358,583,613,1.0,7/4/2014,"Whoa what a wait to sit down at this place! My friend asked her guests to attend a birthday dinner here with reservations at 8PM. I rushed from my side of town to get to the restaurant exactly at eight because I know how it feels to wait for dinner guests when you're hungry.  However, we did not get a table until 9.  Why such the delay???? Because CF does not take reservations!  I was highly surprised by this since Grand Lux Cafe in the Galleria takes reservations and they are a sister company of The Cheesecake Factory. From what my friend told me, she knew about there being no reservations, but she arrived early to request a table and she was told that getting a table inside the restaurant  would demand at least a TWO HOUR WAIT! Must be a joke--not even feasible. Instead they told her they could get a table for her on the patio--it just needed to be cleaned up. I guess the cleaning supplies was stolen by the Tooth Fairy because we still were not seated until 9. and guess where we ended up being seated? Inside. By the bar. They finally used their heads and pushed some bar tables together to accommodate our group. Only problem with bar tables are the high as a kite bar seats. I felt like a pregnant woman in her final trimester trying sit in the chair and scoot it up close enough to sit at the table comfortably. It was a struggle!!!  At this point, I was pretty much over the desire to dine at CF. I had perused the menu before I came to save time, but nothing really enticed my taste buds. After the wait, all I needed was a glass of water and complimentary bread and butter to make it to my next destination.  Seriously, CF needs to consider some sort of reservation system. We came on a Friday night, which is going to be busy. However, their sister company Grand Lux, has a steady flow of patrons and allows them to reserve seating--giving them 15 minutes grace before releasing the table. They're not losing business with a reservation system. CF could use the same protocol to give patrons a chance to dine at their establishment as well. Until then, I believe I'll pass on dining at Cheesecake Factory for awhile."
Grace Q.,"Houston, TX",30,7,1,1.0,1/20/2017,"This is the second time that I have ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes through doordash from the Cheesecake Factory at Memorial City. I love the sweet corn tamale cakes and if you've ever had one yourself when you see the picture you will understand what is wrong with my order. Basically I received three corn pancakes. No sauce, no avocados, no salsa, nothing! Just Three Horn cakes for $11! I've been going to Cheesecake Factory for a very long time that very rarely do I ever go to the location at Memorial City due to the fact that food is never consistent and in particular because of the bad service and poor management. I don't know how something like this ever gets out the front door. Now that I've been using doordash I thought I would attempt to have Cheesecake Factory delivered to my house but this is twice now that the same item is completely wrong!!! I would call to get my money back but it's just not worth it. I've learned my lesson and I won't be returning."
Jacqueline C.,"Houston, TX",448,2,1,2.0,7/6/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is usually my go-to restaurant for lunch, yet my boyfriend and I decided to have a late date night last Sunday.  We've had many good experiences at the Cheesecake Factory, many at this location. Unfortunately for us, they were having a very off night. Considering it was 4th of July weekend, I could understand why they were short staffed, but many things that happened throughout our dinner where not up to the usual standards. What really angers me, we spend $100+ on food and drinks here. And when I go up to the cheesecake display to order one to go, the cashier denied me and told me that she could not ring me up because it was past 11pm. It was 11:04?! There were many people still in the restaurant eating and ordering cheesecakes! The only reason I'm not giving this a one star is due to our waiter. He gave us great service even though they were having many problems in the kitchen, from our appetizers not having any sauces on them, to us not having any silverware for a good portion of the dinner, drinks taking 45+ mins, chicken over cooked on both our meals, to now me being denied a piece of cheesecake. This is the last time I'm coming to this location. Unbelievably bad management."
Rachelle F.,"Houston, TX",233,540,372,5.0,7/15/2014,"Great experience at this location. All of the staff were super friendly. They played excellent music and brought out our food promptly and beautifully displayed. Refills were consistent and the food was hot. My only complaint about this location is that parking can be limited on weekends. But they offer valet for $10 to help during the times you don't want to trouble yourself with finding a spot. Oh, and try the Smore's Cheesecake. Super Good!"
Joel H.,"Allen, TX",16,227,31,2.0,5/16/2016,The shine has wore off The Cheesecake Factory.  This has become a hit or miss restaurant that mostly misses the mark.  Service is painfully slow.  The food has dropped in quality over the years.  This location was dirty.  Food wiped from the tables into the seats/floors.
Tara J.,"Houston, TX",3,14,1,1.0,5/16/2016,"If I could I wouldn't even give this location stars. I've been to this location twice and both times the service sucked! I don't know where you guys are getting these employees from but please give them back! I literally waited 25 mins after my food arrived for the waiter to come back and ask me if everything was ok. NO THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE!!! But since I didn't want to be the typical black woman and cause a scene in public I tried to come up with ways to make the food better BUT I NEVER GOT ANY DAMN SERVICE, and the worse part was I was in my military uniform! You would think that deserves just a little bit of respect but I was wrong in this place! NEVER EVER AGAIN!"
Yesenia A.,"Houston, TX",58,27,8,4.0,7/23/2015,"I am surprised to see a 3/5 star rating for this place. Since I would recommend it to all my friends. Here is why: Perk #1: You have a group of friends debating what to eat. Well debate no more, their menu caters to everyone's taste. They have an extensive menu filled with good tasting food. Nothing magnificent but by no means bad. Perk #2: People say you ""can't have your cake and eat it too"". At this place you can, because you will find yourself wanting to order more than one cheesecake. So eat your cheesecake because you will probably end up ordering seconds to take home. My favorites so far are their red velvet cake, Chris' outrageous, and snickers cheesecake. OMG! you will not be disappointed I guarantee it with a 5 year warranty.  Perk #3: Their bread and butter! I love their brown bread! If it is your first time here be careful or you might end up filling up just eating it. That good? YES! Perk #4: good place for couples as it has a romantic feel to the place. But how romantic on a scale of 1-5? Solid 3.  Perk #5: Memorial City Mall is right next door to walk the food off. Believe me their portions are not small unless you are ordering from their skinny menu."
Manny B.,"Katy, TX",98,56,7,2.0,8/21/2015,"This place is just what you expect. Mediocre food and slow service. My wife really liked the Thai Lettuce Wraps. The waitress recommend the salted caramel cheesecake, and it was not that good. I  sure my review surprises no one who has eaten here."
Theresa N.,"Georgetown, TX",50,423,44,3.0,4/18/2014,"I wavered between two and three stars.  The food was very good, as always.  I had a farro salad, it's a small bites plate.  I knew I would be getting and sharing a cheesecake so why waste calories on a nourishing dish when I can squander the calories on a three lb. slice of cheesecake??? We sat at the bar.  It took a long time for someone to come over. There were so many waitstaff wandering around, looking busy but really they appeared to be just walking to or from someplace, not really DOING anything.   Our waiter was okay, the food was good and fresh. My brother got a hamburger that he said it was the best one he has ever had.  He then had a snickers cheesecake which was downright sinful. Our waiter left and another waiter took over. He was okay, he forgot a few things and the wait time was long for an extra plate, and he didn't hand it to us, he just  said, I brought you an extra plate.  And stood there.  Then came the bathrooms.  They were filthy. My sister came back from an attempt and refused to use the facilities.  She said there was urine all over every seat.  I had to take a look for myself. I went in and there sure enough were droplets of something on the seats.  There was toilet paper on the floor of one stall and both rolls of TP were empty.  This was about 4 PM - how this went unchecked all afternoon is beyond me.  I decided to take a picture and yelp this, but right then, the toiled burbled and shot up about 8"" like Old Faithful.  I stood there looking, and it happened again. That's what I think the water droplets were on the toilet seats...toilet water. This place needs a plumber to look at their system.  It appears their ventilation or something is way, way off.   There was food on the floor as we were leaving. We saw it before we stood up and the waitstaff didn't see it (or didn't want to) and they were walking thru it.  We pointed it out and our waiter wiped it up.  It looked pretty greasy, whatever it was and I was concerned for someone whose footing may not be sure.   Anyway, the food was pretty good, fresh, yummy and as ordered.  It was the cleanliness of the bathrooms that was such a turn off and the waitstaff didn't seem to give a darn about much.  But, lo, the cheesecake calleth."
LaTisha B.,"Houston, TX",0,3,7,1.0,7/30/2016,Worst service ever overrated it took 35 mins to get one basket of bread for 4 people 3 over 200lbs food took over an hour...we asked for extra sauce upon ordering it was brought to us 25 minutes after the entree have been delivered...and desserts we another 30 minutes our visit was 3 hour and valet came and brought me the keys to the car and said he was about to go and needed his money it was 9:30
Naz S.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,1/26/2017,"Worst service ever!  After being there for 15 mins, no one came and took our drink order, nor did they provide us with a small plate for the bread and butter.  Finally we grabbed a waiter, he said he wasn't our waiter but took our order.  They brought my enter and brought my friends entree 20 mins after( it was only tacos) . Worst service, I had to tell to restaurant manager to bring his food, and he had to warm up my pasta since it was cold because I was waiting on my friends food to arrive.  Management and staff need some much needed training on Customer service."
Woody L.,"Houston, TX",1,26,11,1.0,6/18/2016,"To begin with, parking around Memorial City mall is a joke. If you can't find a spot, be prepared to shell out $12 for valet. Once we got it inside, there was  a short wait for our party of 6.  A waiter came by and dropped off menus without greeting or taking drink orders. Finally took our drink orders, and they all came out separately from different servers. Ever hear of a bar tray? Menu is a joke.  Just a hodgepodge of what some marketing bean counter in some office dreamt up. Silverware was covered with dried food. Disgusting. If I wasn't with a party, I would have gotten up and left.  Food was below average, overpriced, corporate garbage. Disgraceful."
Mrld A.,"Houston, TX",1,44,5,5.0,12/15/2016,"Jason was the perfect waiter! I'm a picky eater and he was able to answer all of my questions and bring out food in a timely manner. He brought things to the table before we had a chance to ask for them, which was Awesome. Genuine customer service at its finest. Even the table behind us commented on the service at this location. The rest of the staff greeted and thanked us as we left! Kudos to this location!"
Judy S.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2016,"I've been to Cheesecake Factory location throuout the years and this location is indeed the worst for food quality. I opted for curbside. I was put on hold for 15 minutes to order and I hung up and called to place my order finally. I ordered the avocado crispy egg rolls. They were over fried and dried up. My club sandwich was soggy, no toasted bread and probably 1 piece of bacon on the entire sandwich, it was crumbled and spread around.   Steak Diane was medium instead of rare.  Being take out I didn't feel like returning to complain.  Food was supposed to be ready at 6:30 but came out at 6:50.  Never again"
Yanna N.,"Houston, TX",243,108,811,1.0,4/10/2015,"I despise dishonest people with a passion. And sorry Cheesecake Factory, but ya'll be hiring some dishonest people. It pains me to write this review because this was my first visit in a very long time. Maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of 2000 calorie dishes. But anyway back to why I am writing this review.  I knew that one of these days, saving my receipts would pay off and today it has. After checking my CC statement, I realized that my server went ahead and inserted a larger tip than what I initially left him. Don't get me wrong, the service was great in the beginning but really lacked at the end of the meal. Maybe it's cause we didn't order dessert and ordered water?? Again, think about the calories sheesh!!! Nonetheless, I left him a 20% tip. Reasonable right? Well apparently that amount was not good enough for him, so he took the liberty of adding a couple of more dollars. Yes it's only a few more dollars but wtf this is so wrong of you! If I wanted to tip you 25-30% I would!! I don't recall this ever happening to me, not even when I am piss drunk at a bar. Can you believe that?  When it comes down to it at the end of the day, it's not about the money, IT'S ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE."
Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699,3.0,5/14/2012,"Okay...one question comes to mind about this place...what is up with all the flies in the building?!?  Thankfully, the flies stayed on the windows and on the glass that separates the kitchen area from the dining area, but that is still pretty bad.  I may have given this place 4 stars if I did not see so many frickin' flies! I went on Mother's Day, so you know that a considerable wait was going to happen.  No problem there.  The menu is quite extensive with a lot of variety, so no problem there at all.  Given that the establishment was so packed, I expected some mistakes to happen, and our server got about 90% of our order correct, so no problems there.  of course, the decor in the place is really nice, so no problems there. Food...portion sizes are plentiful, so no problems there.  Taste of the food...well...what is this?  Wait, a chain restaurant that actually uses seasoning, definitely not a problem there!  Very tasty dishes, and after you scour through many options, that can be overwhelming for fence straddlers, you can rest assured that the descriptions of the dishes are true to form.   I would have to mention that considering that they are known for cheesecake, I would like for this place to do one of two things.  Either they should make the slices of cheesecake bigger, or lower the cost of the cheesecake.  Better yet, they need to offer a sampler platter where you can get between 5 - 10 2"" squares of cheesecake so you can try a huge variety of them every time you visit the place. I could definitely go into the specifics of my dishes that I ordered, but that seems pointless.  Know these things: 1.  The decor of the place is nice. 2.  The staff is attentive and professional. 3.  There is a huge variety of options, EVEN WHEN ORDERING APPETIZERS!  What do I mean by that you may be thinking.  You have an appetizer section, then you have a subsection of appetizers, which is a mini-section of the appetizers...like a sampler's special or plate!  Check the on-line menu to see what I mean. 4.  The portion size of entrees is definitely plentiful.  The pricing of the food items are workable...not cheap food, but no where near expensive food. 5.  You will find a cheese cake that you like...PERIOD!  Great variety of flavors available. Do yourself a favor and try this place out."
D T.,"Lake Charles, LA",67,320,656,4.0,9/28/2014,"Busy, busy Saturday night. We waited for a table in less time than they said, about 15 minutes, not bad. Beautiful place! A little too dark for me, but very nice. We had crab dip appetizer  & it was fabulous! Caesar salad was fresh & great, but way to big. The small was too big in a 14"" bowl full! Baked potato soup was  great! I had a small Greek salad that was loaded with veggies & olives & feta cheese & was great. . Pretzel chicken bites were so good. My friend ordered a B&B, they put ice in it??She sent it back. All the food was very fresh & great. The menu is way to big, like a book & takes too long to read. The service was a bit slow. We were there over 2 1/2 hours. But we realized how busy they were. We ordered 4 slices of cheesecake to go. Chocolate, Peanut butter, Deluche & chocolate chip. All the cheesecake we enjoyed. We will return."
Luis I.,"Houston, TX",0,9,2,3.0,7/2/2015,I absolutely love everything about this cheesecake except for 2 things.  1. The lighting. I understand the whole romantic deal but it's absolutely too dark to even see your food let alone have a kids in there.  2. The floors are always slippery. I have to take baby steps just so I don't slip while walking. I ask the lady y it was slippery and she said that's how the whole place is. *not a great response. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Other than the 2 things listed I love this place. Food is great. Cheesecake variety is awesome.
David O.,"Houston, TX",0,36,,2.0,1/9/2017,The food is fine (nothing special) but the service--well it just might be the worst service you can get anywhere in America.  Wait stuff is rough around the edges with rare exception and doesn't seem to understand they're there to serve you.  The hosts will seat you and then it's anybody's guess when the server will show up.  Life is too short to subject yourself to the slow tort
MK O.,"Spring, TX",2,24,11,3.0,6/2/2015,"Our server was awesome and her name is Nikita.  The calamari used to be good but is was soggy, the batter is falling off. --because of this i'll give it a three  However, The bacon bacon burger is the bomb diggity!!!!!"
