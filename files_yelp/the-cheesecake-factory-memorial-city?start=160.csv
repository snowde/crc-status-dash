Kimber S.,"Richmond, TX",0,12,,4.0,1/6/2017,Just finished lunch here. This place seems to be always busy.  Food was good and service was ok. They did take a while to come out with our to go order  hence the 4star. Think waiter forgot but remembered since we keep sitting there. Everything else was fine.
Jo S.,"Houston, TX",0,18,,1.0,6/4/2016,First time going here and it was a huge mistake. The wait was 2 hours long which is ok we chose to wait. But then once we were seated it took forever to get drinks and even longer for bread. We asked the waitress about 20 times for it and she finally came out with it. It was 8 of us and they only gave 6 of us our meal. The other 2 had to wait 10 mins. That is inexcusable!!! I spoke to the GM and he didn't even apologize. We will never go back to this restaurant again. Waste of money. Horrible service and the food is overrated.
Christian R.,"Houston, TX",1,3,,1.0,6/3/2016,"The food is always good here! Me and the girlfriend come here once a week, if it's for lunch or dinner. Great few dishes I always get. However the reason for the 1 star, is the past 4 trips we have had the worst service I have ever had. It was not busy, our waitress had 1 table plus us. I believe it's is there training. They are very lazy forgetful people. I had to ask for our drinks, alcohol and water multiple times, and then finally got them as tables that were sat after us got appetizers.  Great food bad service"
Matt B.,"Houston, TX",9,9,,1.0,5/8/2016,"Maybe they were having a off night, but on mothers day? Came in at 930 with my moms and family for late night snacks. I ordered the steak diane with shrimp scampi, maybe 2 oz of overcooked meat, 3 pieces of shrimp that were overcooked as well. Horrible...  my food came out 10 mins after everyones elses... subed out my mashed potatoes for mac n cheese that the server recommend that never made it to the table.. once they realized it, they sent out this microwaved cheese water with cruchy/rubber noodle, cold un melted cheese... dont come in later than 930, kitchen and staff seem egar to leave and half ass the their job"
Jimmy S.,"Richmond, TX",69,90,5,1.0,4/18/2015,"I have tried the cheesecake factory in the galleria, up north and sugar land area but here at the memorial area is the worst.  Got here at 12p for lunch, we ordered our food at 1220ish and didn't get our food till after 1p.  I ordered the orange chicken - and the rice was dried and hard - the chicken was cold  The waiter said he was going to bring a manager and never came.  We will never come back."
Peter C.,"Katy, TX",30,74,61,4.0,3/31/2016,"This one is located near Memorial City mall, actually sharing parking. There is valet parking available if you prefer. To start .. the restaurant architecture is quite appealing giving you a very welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. It has a very nice bar and a desert to go area with deserts on display (of course featuring cheesecakes). We were seated within ten minutes in a back alcoved area by a window. Server was prompt with menus that were frankly too extensive of a selection but good choices including a ""skinny"" menu under 500 cal selections. I had the classic burger with a side salad. It was huge! Cooked well - my only complaint was the grilled onion slice had an outside ""ring"" that was very rubbery. Taste was excellent including the salad- loved the ranch dressing. Of course had the cherry cheesecake and it was the bomb. A little pricey - three folks for $94 including tip. But i have to say I enjoyed my visit and will return again!!"
Janine B.,"Houston, TX",372,778,1621,4.0,1/4/2015,"My only regret was that I had no room for Cheesecake ! LOL. I sat in the bar alone & got excellent service. I went during the Christmas shopping season, so parking was a nightmare. I was glad to finally get to my seat for some refreshing Strawberry Lemonade, that stuff is so bad for me, but I look forward to the occasional treat. Then they brought out that crack that is otherwise known as the bread basket. I don't know what they put on that brown loaf with oats on top, but it is highly addictive !! I ordered  a salad for my Entrée & the server suggested the Crab Bites for my appetizer & that was a really good choice. They were full of flavor & I would definitely order them again. My salad was fresh & the lunch portion was still a very good size portion."
Rachel O.,"Houston, TX",54,15,,5.0,6/21/2015,"We just enjoyed a Sunday breakfast at Memorial city cheesecake factory. It exceeded my expectations. The restaurant was comfortable and not too crowded and we were able to actually hear each other converse, which is always a bonus. The waitstaff was exceptional and the breakfast items we ordered were super tasty. Thank you to our waitress, V, for her charm and good service this morning.  I suspect this location is well-managed bc everyone seemed happy to work there and knew what they were doing.  I sure appreciate that too!!! I think i found my new favorite Sunday breakfast place!"
Vic C.,"Katy, TX",65,198,222,4.0,6/25/2015,"So i tried something different this time, I ordered off of the skinny menu (dont laugh at me) and got a pizza, which honestly it is small, but it was actually very delicious. It was the pear pizza. Also I ordered the cheese stick appetizer, they come in about 6 or so pieces, they were yummy as well. And I love the chocolate bread."
Ellen B.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2016,"I joined yelp so that I could review our trip to the Cheesecake Factory today. Not our first trip. Five of us arrived at 1:20, we were (finally) seated at 2. Four of the five of us ordered alcohol drinks; TWO of them arrived at 2:30. By now my daughter is watching the bar, sees our other two drinks sitting there. She watches as a young man walks over, pulls the straw out on one drink......LICKS IT, puts it back IN the drink and then serves it. Needless to say, we sent that one back. Did not ""tell"" or complain; the out of towners wanted to eat there and I was afraid they might do something (else) to the food if we told them what happened.  The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. We spent over $150 and Cheesecake Factory lost our business....and I will be telling everyone about it.  This made me so sad."
Haniya B.,"Cypress, TX",0,1,,5.0,3/15/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory! The locations are few and hard to find. The only one I have been to is the one in memorial city. Everything is great about this restaurant, the ambience, the decor, the food.. Some of my faves here: The brown bread(makes me love this place even more) Firecracker Salmon Fettuccini Alfredo  Herb Crusted Salmon (absolutely amazing) Luau salad And finally the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake...yummmm! Need I say more? This place definately deserves a higher rating. DO give this place a try.."
Nancy H.,"Katy, TX",2,24,8,2.0,12/18/2015,"Brought my grandkids to have some lunch. I enjoyed the lettuce wraps as always and they enjoyed a pepperoni pizza. I understand it's the month of December however $15 for valet parking in order to be able to go and spend my money inside this restaurant is not acceptable, in fact I am pretty disappointed about this issue. That would definitely stop me from coming here again"
Caleb W.,"Cypress, TX",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2016,"Oh boy where to start. Waitress (tamoiah or something similar) came by once in the whole meal to drop off a refill which was the only one that I received during the whole meal, the other person at the table had an empty glass the whole time. Didn't take our order, didn't offer refills, never once came to check if we needed anymore bread or anything typically offered, didn't even ask if the food was alright then dropped off the check as she was walking by. Talked to the manager (Jason) and he did absolutely nothing other than asked us what we wanted him to do. After explaining the whole nights problems that started right after we sat down, he only offered some dessert. Won't be returning for a long time, talking to management was a definite disappointment."
Dona C.,"Houston, TX",5,2,,2.0,6/5/2017,"Just picked up a to go order, requested steak medallions with mashed potatoes. Not sure what I got, the steak was over cooked, four very small pieces, I would say bite size,therefore 4 bites total,  mashed potatoes amounted to 1/2 cup at best with some tomatoes, pieces of asparagus.This for $17.50 Not at all what I was expecting for my sons birthday. The salmon spinach egg rolls, were a total of two. Another not what I thought. The kids meals were the best however, so bottom line go for the kids meals! However the cheesecakes are excellent. Also must always check it before you go, which I did not do. I called and spoke to the manager and was told this was the skinnylicious menu item(steak medallions) and I said I never indicated that menu. But he mentioned the Steak Diane, which I could go and pick up for the additional price and I said no thank you. Just a warning, best not to get the steaks!"
Michele X.,"Houston, TX",29,13,10,2.0,1/4/2015,"I absolutely love The Cheesecake Factory! This location was very busy on a Saturday evening, which is expected. The wait for me (which was a party of 5) was an hour wait. We waited at the bar, where I had two of their mojitos (the pineapple and berry mojitos) which was absolutely delicious!  Our waiter was very nice. He always made sure we had our drinks. Their was a delay on our last drink order, which was understandable due to a heavy volume at the bar (only 3 bartenders tending). I ordered the filet mignon medium rare, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Filet mignon came out perfect!! Couldn't complain too much about the service. Might want to try another location, this location is pretty cramped."
Zul A.,"Zug, Switzerland",0,43,54,4.0,1/9/2016,"we went there on a Friday night with no reservation - so we expected a waiting line. although packed we (party of two) got our table within 15min.  service was excellent, the two classic burger delicious and cooked exactly the way we wanted it. including the very chocolate rich dessert (godiva chocolate cake) and two beers we walked out for less than 50usd.   very much worth your money.  recommendable."
Jeffy C.,"Katy, TX",0,2,1,1.0,4/20/2016,"Worse attitude I have ever experienced!! The server is called ADAN S They forced you to give them tips, if you don't they will chase you out and force you to give them tips! Rude  Don't go or you will regret !!!  Don't even want to give one star !"
Tim J.,"Houston, TX",40,535,1053,2.0,12/7/2013,"It might be a pretty empty lunch weekend lunch gathering, or the lack of emotions in the air. And it's certainly not the food that would attract a gathering. Normally I like the Cheescake factory, tons of appetizer to fight over, and a slice of heaven as the reprise. Yet the meal at this location is just not up to the standard.  The greasy, batter encroached shrimp had the texture of a year old corndog. Then it was paired with a fish that needed all the gravy absorbed to force down. Only item that was not too bad is the steamed asparagus.  This is a for sure no revisit."
Jamie L.,"Katy, TX",447,211,579,4.0,12/20/2013,"I was under the impression I had already reviewed this place but I guess not. It was a great idea to place a Cheesecake Factory at this location. It's a very attractive spot in Memorial City. On my first visit of this location, I was impressed with them having a separate waiting area where you can order  appetizers while waiting on your table. I think that was a great addition to the restaurant. In addition to the location, I also love how the restaurant looks on the inside. It makes you feel like you're actually going to a nice place without having to drive downtown or across town. The service was decent. I would like to suggest that the waiter needs to confirm rules and menu before saying YES.  Strike #1- I ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp jambalaya. I asked if it came with garlic bread. He said yes. Then he came back and told me no....he offered another type of bread but I wasn't interested. Strike #2- I told him it was my wife's bday and I asked if they do anything special like a song or dance for Bdays. He replied, I will see what we can which caused me to assume there will be some form of acknowledgement. Well NOTHING was mentioned after that.  I am just not one to force good service in an environment where my food preparation is involved.  Outside of that everything else was great, including the extensive menu.  I wish I was adventurous enough to try everything on the menu...GO shop around at the mall and hit up the Cheesecake Factory for a great meal!"
Amy Y.,"Spring Branch, Houston, TX",34,6,9,1.0,5/9/2016,"Just had the worst experience at this restaurant. We went here with a group of 9 people for a birthday dinner. The waiter was amazing the whole time but the kitchen staff was terribly slow and the food was horrible!!! It took 45 minutes after we placed our order to receive all of our food. The sandwiches were dry, the bread was rock hard, the fries were old and one of the sandwiches had a HAIR in it!!! Gross!! The pasta dishes ordered were the only good thing on the table but not even that great. Not worth $20 a plate!! This will be the last time I go here."
