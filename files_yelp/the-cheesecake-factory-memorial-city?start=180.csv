Mika C.,"Katy, TX",0,8,3,4.0,11/5/2016,"We went to celebrate my husbands birthday last night and the Cheesecake Factory was where he wanted to go. We Arrived a little after 5 and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. The Hostess wasn't the friendliest but our server Chris made up for her lack of friendliness & customer service!Chris was friendly, engaging, & attentive to his tables! My husband had a great night & loved being sung to for his birthday"
Maria C.,"Katy, TX",94,2,,1.0,4/30/2016,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I wish I could give it 0 stars . Waited 2 hours for a party of 12, we were seated and 30 minutes later did not even get drinks. Needless to say, we left!!!! Horrible and rude hostesses. Never ever coming back"
Jarrett W.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/3/2016,"GARBAGE got sat at a dirty table, never got bread, waited 20 minuets for my appetizer (while the table next to me got all their food). Found a bean in my Mac n cheese bites, which got removed without a word. Finally got my food but not a refill. Eventually had to ASK for a manager and the check. Super not what's cooking. Lowkey I've never had such bad service like ever"
Darlene C.,"Katy, TX",113,61,1,3.0,1/11/2015,"I hadn't been to this location in a couple of years because every time I stopped by, there seemed to be a hundred people waiting for a table. But, I got a gift card for Christmas, so I decided to come here with my boyfriend for an early Saturday dinner. We arrived around 5pm and there were 19 parties ahead of us. Our wait was 30 minutes, which wasn't so bad since a party of 6 that came after us we did was told their wait would be two hours. Our server's name was Christie and she was very sweet, courteous, and made us feel right at home. But the food, on the other hand, didn't really impress me. I had the Skinnylicious Turkey Burger with a salad and some vinaigrette dressing. On a scale of 1-10, I'd say about a 6. I had a spoonful of my boyfriend's Skinnylicious Chicken Pasta with Basil and it was okay. The sauce was pretty good and had a fresh basil taste. The bill for the two of us was $25, but we didn't order drinks, just water, and we didn't get dessert either. I was told they do have reservations during the week, so I may be back again soon, when it's not as busy. Another tip - be sure to listen CLOSELY if your name is called for a table (they were out of pagers when I arrived). I almost missed my table because I couldn't hear what the hostess was saying through all the clatter of plates and people talking around me. The hostess should definitely use a microphone to tackle this problem. Great service from our server, food is all right."
Esteban D.,"Houston, TX",5,26,2,3.0,1/24/2015,"The experience was nothing less then great! the valet was a great touch since we went in Xmas week and the parking was unbelievable I decided to park which took me 40 minutes to realize... Get the valet its only $10 trust me in a hectic weekend just cough it up lol.  It was definitely not family friendly or 5 and under children due to limited waiting area. we went on Xmas week and it was Cold and people had children waiting for a table with small children by the front door. Sad to see this kids freezing for a table with parents. Again not knocking the restaurant but if you know not just adults are coming to diner get a better place for kids too if that is where the franchise is heading to family.  It was very sophisticated location on the Memorial Mall, but not family friendly. If on a date, or meeting other adults it is a great place!!!! The location seem to be to congested for my taste but that's just my little too cents.  The Staff, AWESOME!  We were helped with the menu since this was my first experience with the restaurant. The waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and when I asked for a recommendation he did a great job.   The meal was exquisite, and the price was ..well lets just say you get what you pay for and we got a lot lol. At the end of the day I give this location a B+ if not just for what I saw with the kids waiting on the cold every single time someone opened the front doors. It was a great experience we will be going back soon."
Susan M.,"Houston, TX",73,38,91,3.0,8/1/2015,Overhyped. While we enjoyed ambiance of the place the food was not mind blowing. PF Changs has better lettuce wraps and the calamari was accurately reported by another reviewer as not crispy enough but more soggy. Crab bites were just that a tiny bite sized burnt round thing. For the price there are other better places.
Patricia Z.,"Houston, TX",301,212,125,2.0,4/21/2013,"I have never sat at a restaurant bar where I had to request every.single.thing. and where all 4 people behind the bar are always making drinks for the tables without a designated BARTENDER.  This place seriously needs a visit from Jon Taffer. Sat down and wasn't acknowledged for at least 3-5 minutes with NO ONE on either side of me. Bar was pretty much empty and my friend was in the restroom. There were about 4 people behind bar. Finally had to shuffle a bit in my seat to relieve myself from my apparent cloak of invisibility. Water? Asked for it. Drink menu? Asked if I could order. Bread? Asked for it again. Small plates to actually spread the butter on? Had to request again. Actual entree? Yep. You guessed it- had to ask THEM if I could order something.  Seriously.  Total waste. Usually the bar is a fun place at which to sit but not here. Even my Stuffed Chicken Tortillas didn't taste like they used to. The cheesecake was great as always though, I recommend just getting that to go and saving 50 bucks."
Shurani L.,"Vaughan, MS",17,42,3,3.0,11/2/2014,"I went to The Cheesecake Factory for a work lunch. Parking at The Cheesecake Factory is just like driving in Houston traffic anytime of the day: a hot mess. I came during the lunch hour. I had to park so far away from the restaurant that I actually worked off the lunch calories before I made it back to my car (or so it seemed.) I ordered the Renee Special which is the chicken salad sandwich, soup and a house salad. I ordered water  to drink. The clam chowder was creamy and delicious. It had an ample amount of clams, diced potatoes and onions in a rich, creamy broth. The chicken salad comes sliced in wedges of grilled, buttered toast, with some sort of sour, blue cheese type dressing. The chicken salad had a strange, almost sour flavor that overpowered my taste buds. It just didn't taste good. The house salad was well, just a salad. The greens and tomatoes were incredibly fresh, however. I didn't care for the bread that comes out first. The bread is served in an unlined, wire rack. When the bread comes, it's just the bread, the rack, and the table surface. LOL. The first batch of bread served was cold as ice. The bread was not that flavorful and too chewy. The  second batch of bread was warm but still not tasty enough of me to give it a great rating. We had a great waitress. It took a while for the food to be served, maybe 20 minutes. Overall, The Cheesecake Factory is overpriced for the quality of food that it serves. It was my first time coming there, and I was not impressed. Maybe I'll come back for the soup and the cheesecake, and just stay away from the main courses. I don't want to take any more chances paying that much money for entrées."
Kate L.,"Houston, TX",1,3,1,2.0,9/7/2014,"I try to stay away from this location for the following reasons:  - It's difficult to find parking because it's right beside Target at Memorial City Mall. Don't even think about going during the weekends.  - The service is terrible. Every time my family and I go, they sit us somewhere and forget about us. It usually takes 15 mins or more to get our drink order and then waiting for our entrees is a disaster.  I've only had ONE experience where our server gave us excellent service. Other than that, they couldn't care less.  The food isn't reason enough for me to return either."
Michelle H.,"Houston, TX",525,662,674,4.0,11/25/2013,What is there not to like about The Cheesecake Factory? The food is always good and the portions are huge! Service is always great and the atmosphere is perfect for any occasions (I've even broken up with a guy here before). A few of my favorites... The brown bread -- always get the brown bread! Firecracker Salmon (appetizer) Herb Crusted Filet of Salmon Louisiana Chicken Pasta Chicken Madeira  Tira-Misu Cake I'm getting hungry. Who wants to join me for dinner? ;)
Amanda K.,"Katy, TX",8,10,4,3.0,3/22/2016,"My husband and I went for our anniversary and was seated on the patio, which was quiet.  We have never been there before and let our server know.  Our server did not give any recommendations or guide us through the menu, we hardly received refills and our server did not check if our food came out good. The food was thankfully amazing, but service was less than average. For the price of the food and the long wait, management should train their server better and at least walk the dining area and check on things for themselves. However, we will be giving The Cheesecake factory another chance, because their food was great! ."
Chelsea B.,"Katy, TX",2,37,26,5.0,4/10/2015,"Red Velvet Cheesecake - 10/10 - always a favorite of mine! 30th Anniversary Cheesecake - 8/10 Blueberry Mojito - 10/10 - very crisp and clean taste, yummmm!"
Curtis P.,"Houston, TX",1,3,1,1.0,4/10/2016,4/10/2016.  We've eaten at Sugarland location regularly. Great service. How ever Memorial Mall location short cry compared to Burger king. Service was none existence. Restraint was not busy at first when we got there just before the Sunday crowd. They showed us a little table and I looked around and saw 4 larger tables empty and asked if we could have one of those seat and she said she would check and gave a timer and said it would be 10 min. 25min later and 7 families seated they didn't acknowledge at all so we left and ate at Lupe tortillas with was hands down with service and food. I would highly recommend going some were but Memorial Cheese cake factory. I guess the manager is an amateur. Go back to burger king.
Mario P.,"Katy, TX",72,164,370,4.0,5/11/2013,"Came here for Brunch, ordered the breakfast Monte Cristo sandwich and sweat tea. Debra was our waitress, and I was glad that she was Excellent service and great attitude. She kept the drinks filled and checked by often. The monte Cristo can easily serve 2 adults, it's huge ( as is most of the portions here ). The flavor was just sinful, I know I gained 5 pounds during this meal, and I really should watch what I eat, but wow that was awesome. The rest of the comments from my crew varied from very good to great ( French toast garnered that sentiment from my daughter ). Hey I get that it's a chain, but they've got great food. On this visit the service was great, the waits can be tough, but in most of H town and the surrounding areas, good places have waits . Though on this visit the wait was less than 2 minutes. I look forward to my next visit, but I need to lose a few pounds first."
Michelle S.,"Houston, TX",0,9,2,4.0,9/11/2016,We have been coming to this location since it opened.  Food and drinks are always great.  The servers are slow though.  It's crazy but this is one of the best places to get filet mignon!  Always great.
Alex W.,"Houston, TX",1,40,1,3.0,8/17/2016,Food was good. Service was ok. Overall experience Ok.  Visited around 3 in the afternoon. Party of 2 adults we had to wait for tiny booth while full sized ones were available as restaurant was less than half full. Be aware of this as it makes table space very cramped. Hostess obviously has her own agenda.
Danielle B.,"Houston, TX",0,9,,1.0,8/24/2016,"Never coming back here again.  Each time I've gone to this location, the service gets worse and worse.  The last time I picked up a take out order, they left out half of the order, and didn't even apologize for the mistake.  And the last time I dined in and ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich, it took over 30 minutes before the food was brought out.  This was in the middle of the day, when the restaurant was completely dead, so I know the wait couldn't have been from the kitchen being backed up with orders.  There was no cheese on the sandwich, so when I asked them to fix it, they brought out the same sandwich with slices of cheese straight out of the fridge on it, without even caring to melt it.  I've been to other locations, where the sandwich always has melted cheese on it, so I know how they normally prepare it, and this was clearly not it.  When I told the waiter, I was treated like it was my fault for simply wanting the food the way it is supposed to be prepared.  I've given this location many chances, but I will not make that mistake again, because I always walk away dissatisfied."
N S.,"Fairfax, VA",15,6,7,5.0,8/8/2015,"What a great experience! The wait for the table of 8 was very short. Being it was 12pm on a Saturday, it was a great first impression. The hostess and waiter were extremely friendly and attentive. The guacamole and vegan Cobb salad were delicious! I was pleasantly surprised to find something that great to eat here and will start frequenting The Cheesecake Factory now that I know they have a few options for vegans!"
Krystal T.,"Austin, TX",1,3,,1.0,2/16/2016,"I was NOT impressed at all. The only thing that made my night was the Pineapple Mojito and I'm not even much of a drinker. I was served a dirty glass THREE times. Finally, because I was so thirsty, I accepted a less dirty glass. The glasses were completely covered in grit, which I assumed was food particles. It was very hard to miss so it makes me feel that the staff just didn't care. I finally got my less dirty glass after my food had arrived and after we had finished our appetizer. The food was just okay. If you've ever worked at a restaurant, you'll know what I'm talking about. Our waitress was one of those that would get other people to do her work and then she'd collect the tip. She was slow and didn't seem to want to work, maybe we just got her when she was exhausted or whatever. Also, we expected that since we took our dessert to-go that she throws in a fork and napkins."
Ridhi A.,"Katy, TX",7,17,,2.0,12/26/2015,"Went here on a saturday night and got the edamame and avocado egg rolls the edamame was burnt, how do you screw up edamame??? the eggrolls were great as always i got the cashew chicken and it was way to soy saucy lol and salty i was really disappointed. a friend got the veggie burger and enjoyed it then for dessert i though i'd be different and try the rasberry/lemon cheescake it was way to sweet fresh but too sweet all in all a bad experience. Our waiter was really nice but it was crowded so it took some time to bring the check ect.."
