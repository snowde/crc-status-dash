Robert J.,"Mont Belvieu, TX",2,47,22,4.0,8/27/2015,Well what can I say. The cheesecake are the best. The spaghetti is awesome as well as the other entrees. A bit loud but that's ok. Great atmosphere
Katrina A.,"Houston, TX",4,2,2,5.0,11/16/2014,"I got the crispy chicken costoletta, which was chicken with lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was absolutely amazing! I also got the pumpkin cheesecake, it wasnt the best i ever had but it was good. Our waiter was the sweetest guy ever. Overall it was a great experience."
Albert S.,"Houston, TX",3,37,21,4.0,8/25/2014,"Great cheesecake. I love the key lime pie, the prices are high $28 for 7 inch pie but everyonce in a while it takes the craving away. The service is a bit slow and parking can be a headache. Other than that not bad at all."
Dulcie V.,"Houston, TX",5,4,,1.0,3/8/2015,"Terrible service. I've had better service in village shacks in India. Waited 40 minutes after being seated before being asked if we had been helped as yet. Guy was apologetic, and asked two different waiters to serve us. Nope. Finally got one waiter. We ordered coffee... And got 2 half cups coffee in To-Go cups.  A hostess then came up and said in passing that she would get us a waiter. No apology for making us wait, just a harried comment, as if that would even be a substitute for placating! If I hadn't had terrible service the last time I came here, I would have chalked it up as one off day. Unacceptable, and I expected much better from a company that prides themselves on service."
Juan E.,"Hollis, Queens, NY",0,4,,3.0,4/22/2015,3 stars for this location because even though most Cheesecake Factory locations are a great experience our first time here was pretty bad. We were sitting for 20 minutes before we were even greeted by anyone. According to the waitress there was a mixup with the tables so I didn't care much anyway since we had kids with us that were yelling so we were pretty noticeable.  We already knew what we wanted so we put the orders in and waited for our bread and water. Our fried calamari came out with a kid's pizza to begin. The entrees came out in time and my wife's hibachi steak was great but my Mac burger was overcooked but it was not bad since I was starving. The waitress was going to get a 20% tip regardless because I always tip well and she was very nice to my wife.  By the end of the meal I was stuffed and ordered an Oreo cheesecake and enjoyed it. We weren't that upset at the end about that long wait we had experienced.
Patrick D.,"Houston, TX",23,60,3,3.0,2/16/2015,"First time at this location and in fairness it was the day before Valentines Day so it was probably more hectic than usual. I was told it would be a 3 1/2 hour wait for a party of 10 ppl. Some of my party left and 8 of us stuck around because it never takes that long. We got to our make shift booth and it was too small so we had to sit tight for another table to open up. Mind you this was my daughters 13th birthday. We were finally moved to another table that was much better. They were slow on our food, drinks (two were not good and bitter) and getting us to a nicer table. And there were no concessions as if a customer is supposed to be subjected to this type of service at the Memorial City location. The Galleria Mall never has these problems and I have yet to experience this type of service."
Tracy S.,"Spring, TX",41,9,4,2.0,2/9/2015,"I was so disappointed in my meal. That doesn't happen often at Cheesecake Factory. I typically go to the location at The Woodlands Mall. Decided to try one closer to home. The crusted chicken romano was dry, the pasta had almost no sauce and the service was horrible. I would've complained about the food and had it remade if the sever ever bothered to check back."
Chi C.,"Katy, TX",0,17,,1.0,8/22/2015,"Had a to go order. Sweltering inside the waiting area! The hostesses are literally sweating and fanning themselves. You know it's bad if people are choosing to stand outside in 90 degree heat and drizzling rain than wait inside! Oh there are only two benches! I asked the manager if there was anywhere else to sit. Instead of pulling out some chairs he only pointed out they only have the two benches. I guess I'll be going back to the First Colony location, at least they have AC!!!! Do better Cheesecake Factory Memorial City!!!!"
Gaby M.,"Nantes, France",57,130,266,4.0,3/19/2014,"The service is not bad, but it all depends on the day and I guess who helps you. I had super accommodating servers that go above and beyond and server that are OK.. but overall their is consistency. My favorite dish was taken out of the menu .. Spaghetti a la Marinara, however they have so many other delicious options to choose from, the ribeye never disappoints me and neither does the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake!"
Sean S.,"Fontana, CA",10,54,27,5.0,12/16/2013,"I haven't been to a CF in a very long time. After this visit, I should patronize the one near my home.  This location was very busy but the bar took care of the wait by supplying excellent service and some interesting beer choices. The Lambic Raspberry was excellent and several in my group got one after sampling mine. Even had La Fin Du Monde.  I ordered the Luisiana Chicken Pasta. 4.5 star, the pasta was cooked on point, firm but tender and the parmesan crusted chicken was light, tasty, and not greasy or oily. The sauce was excellent with nice tangy bite. Was looking for bread afterward to mop it up. Very large portion size.  The pasta dish was large enough to forgo the need for an appetizer. I split the key lime cheesecake with a friend. Excellent, painfully tart and very good. The whipped cream tasted fresh made. It was busy and kind of noisy, but if you are with an engaging group, not an issue.  Excellent execution on the food, great choices in beer, live and active atmosphere. As 5-star says ""As Good As It Gets"""
Melissa G.,"Katy, TX",104,646,82,3.0,8/24/2011,"It's The Cheesecake Factory, but dirtier.  The tables, silverware, and glassware were not very clean (very spotty).  This is always a disappointment with me. I can say that this is just like any other Cheesecake Factory food-wise and I've honestly never been impressed with their entrees or appetizers.  There's a reason it's called The Cheesecake Factory and that is probably the only thing I think they do well: cheesecake.  The tuxedo cheesecake I got ""to go"" was just as good as at any other of these restaurants. If you love any other location of this restaurants,  then you will love this one.  If you feel they are overrated for anything other than dessert, then you probably get yours to go like I do and don't worry about the mediocre entree choices."
Crystal H.,"Houston, TX",54,296,204,4.0,5/1/2012,"Yes their menu is tacky, yes parking is a pain, and it's always busy here but those are just things that need to be taken with a grain of salt when going to  this popular chain restaurant.  I love their Lunch Specials. I always order the Pasta Da Vinci it's my absolute favorite pasta in this area. The pasta is always cooked Al Dente, the sauce is always creamy and full of flavor with a smooth finish and there's plenty of chicken and mushroom pieces with a slather or caramelized onions right on top. My friend had ordered the Goat Cheese & Pear Flatbread but instead ate half of my pasta! It's that good.  We went on a Sunday @ around 2:30pm so it's still pretty busy but we got sat right away. (The smaller your party the less of a wait). Our server was just okay. He had a small section but brought out our food on time and processed our checks timely. The only thing I would have to say is he didn't bring out any of that delicious pumpernickel bread until I had to ask for it. I like sopping up my Da Vinci sauce with it!  Overall I had a great experience and my expectations were met. Ambiance is beautiful, noise level is pretty high, and it still amazed me how their uniforms can stay so white!  *My receipt printed out with a survey for a $10 e-gift card. One in every few receipts get this so I was very excited! :]"
Kimberly H.,"Houston, TX",3,31,1,1.0,10/10/2014,"I was seated promptly. My waiter asked if I was waiting for someone. When I said no, he rolled his eyes and removed the other place setting. I ordered the Pit Beef Dip - it was over 50% fat and gristle and completely disgusting. The waiter was dancing attendance on the other groups in the section, but refused to meet my eye when I tried to get his attention. I was starving and decided eat my salad. The waiter swept picked up the plate, announced he would get my check, and left before I could swallow and tell him I had a complaint about the food. I ended up paying and leaving, because I was so angry I did not trust myself to keep a civil tongue. I will be telling everyone I know to avoid this location like the plague."
Bryn M.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,1.0,4/11/2016,"Oh dear!!!!  Been twice in the last 6 weeks.  Food is really good!  Especially the deserts ... But no matter how good the food, the service just simply sucks!!  Poor management, disorganized waiters who always seem totally demoralized.  The eating out experience is as much about the relaxation and the overall experience as it is about the food.  It just could not be worse in this respect.. Such a shame!"
John S.,"Streetman, TX",0,56,,1.0,3/17/2016,"Terrible Experience! I was invited back by the manager (Ryan & Michael) and was deceived. I was informed that my meal would be taken care of. I had to pay for the bad service I received on my first experience and then deceived on my second experience. I would not recommend any ""The Cheesecake Factory,"" especially this one in Memorial City. I will never go back."
Jenn N.,"Houston, TX",1091,159,229,2.0,8/12/2015,"Um no. Really good food and the ambiance is very much like Disneyland. Nothing wrong with a family oriented environment except a screaming 10-month old baby and a 2 year old in the bar area.  The foot traffic was super slow when we arrived. Our server was Bianca and I was utterly disappointed. The service was so bad, other servers had to help us from drinks and food not arriving, to asking her to remove dishes from the table since it was so cluttered and the table was small. It took almost 30 minutes to get the bill and then my friend and I decided to split the bill. The server only came back with one credit card - mine! She put the entire total on my bill and ""lost"" my friend's credit card.  A manager, Mike, came over and apologized. He offered us a piece of cheesecake as we were on the floor looking for the credit card. We were all over the bar area looking for my friend's credit card and the manager tried to convince us to stay and have cheesecake/more food.  Finally, 20 minutes later, my friend's credit card suddenly appeared out of nowhere and the server said she ""dropped"" the card somewhere. The manager then ""corrected"" the bill and this morning, I woke up with four random authorizations from their establishment on my credit card with different amounts not matching up to my receipt.  Hopefully the authorizations go away in the next day or two or I will have to cancel my credit card.  My friend was freaked out because her credit card was missing and wondered what happened to it the 20 mins it disappeared? Either way, the service was really bad but I give it a two star because the food was really good."
Owais E.,"Houston, TX",3,9,,3.0,11/28/2014,"It was OK. I had the Jamaican Shrimp, which was pretty good, but the quality could have been better. I don't go here much, but I bet other dishes are pretty good. Pretty pricy, but the red velvet cheese cake was awesome!"
Diego V.,"Missouri City, TX",13,31,2,4.0,3/17/2015,"I had a nice lunch date, food was good at a reasonable price. Cheesecakes are always the best I've ever had and the staff was friendly. It a great lunch place!!"
Gigi L.,"Houston, TX",248,121,261,4.0,1/21/2014,"Love love love love Cheesecake Factory. Always satisfied every time I dine here or at any other location. First off there menu has lots of variety. I absolutely recommend ordering different items on the menu every visit just because everything is tasty. Fried calamari, fried Macaroni and cheese balls, tex mex eggrolls are some of my favorite Appetizers. I enjoy their pastas, chicken, and seafood dishes a lot. Burgers are eh ok not the best. The thing I like the most is the skinny menu. Try their Tuscan chicken or mahi mahi & shrimp Veracruz - was tasty, the right portions, lite, and filled you up but not an overwhelming way.  Kid friendly and YES always get some cheesecake!"
Diana S.,"Washington, DC",181,136,86,3.0,10/17/2011,I've come to this location a couple times. TCF is known to be a bit salty; their pastas are especially not that wonderful. Service is normal. This location is convenient for Med Center employees; its right across the skywalk.
