Benjamin W.,"Houston, TX",168,54,201,4.0,7/18/2011,"For my birthday this year, I ate with my family at the Cheesecake Factory (Memorial Mall location). It wasn't too crowded; the wait was only about 10 minutes. There is an awesome patio area outside where we sat and waited for our table. Once seated, we were greeted by out server. He was a young guy, very polite and helpful. For my appetizer, I chose the Ahi tuna Carpaccio. This is an amazing dish that punches your taste buds with powerful flavors. I must warn though, it is rather pricey for such a small, thin cut of tuna. I still stand by my recommendation, however, because it has amazing flavor. The thin slice of Ahi tuna comes covered in a wasabi pesto, garnished with creamy avocado and togarashi aioli (whatever that is.)  For my main course, I decided on the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. This is a complex dish with far too many ingredients to list here. The chicken and shrimp is packed inside a delicious curry sauce with coconut milk. There is also a peanut sauce. It comes garnished with flaked coconut, dried parsley, peanuts, and green onions. If you're a fan of chicken curries or Thai food, you might enjoy this one. The Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp was zesty AND sweet. There was a large portion of chicken and shrimp as well and it was very filling. There is only one bit negative feedback that I would like to announce. At one point during our meal, a random server dropped off a plate of hummus and bread to our table which we did not order. It was there for about 10 min until we mentioned that it did not belong to us. The plate was picked up and walked back into the kitchen and within seconds, the same sever walked up and served a hummus plate to the table next to us. It seemed as though he served them the same dish that had sat on our table that whole time. Maybe they had a new dish ready, but that was pretty damn fast. They should have been brought a fresh plate, but I wasn't in the kitchen to see what happened. All BS aside, I enjoyed my meal and the service was excellent. I feel obligated to give a high rating because this establishment seems perfect and I have no real reason for complaint, however, I will remove 1 point for the hummus plate issue. Otherwise, it was great food, great service, and a wonderful birthday dinner. I have posted pictures of both meals discussed above, check them out!"
Deanna J.,"Houston, TX",70,169,31,3.0,12/2/2013,"This location is close to my home, so I've been here quite a bit.  90% of the time, I get a seat in the bar area because I want to get a seat quick... plus that's where the sports are.  I have yet to be disappointed in the food or service.  There are 2 young men who work the bar area who are very friendly, funny, and give good service.  I wish I remember their names.  Parking can be atrocious but that's to be expected since it's shared with the Memorial City Mall.   My favorite dishes:  the buffalo blasts, firecracker salmon, stuffed mushrooms, chicken piccata, and Louisiana chicken pasta. My favorite cheesecakes:  red velvet and white chocolate caramel macadamia nut."
Amy B.,"Dallas, TX",322,672,474,4.0,10/10/2013,"This was your standard Cheesecake Factory location. Good service and good food can be expected. I sat at the bar to grab a quick dinner, and the bartender was a gentleman. I ordered the sausage and ricotta flatbread (which was amazing), along with a small plate of greek salad. The vinaigrette was super tasty. I was in and out within 40 min (probably helped that I ordered easy dishes to prepare). I like eating at this location because I can walk off any unwanted calories at the attached mall."
Lard Belly E.,"Anchorage, AK",111,883,2591,4.0,11/18/2013,Came in for lunch and sat at the bar. Nice bartender. I ordered a cup of soup that was a healthy portion. I ordered the skinnylicious asian chicken tacos. Decent food and fast service. I would recommend.
Jessica M.,"Cypress, TX",94,248,94,4.0,11/3/2013,Perfect location but parking is horrible since it's connected to the mall.  Waited about 45 minutes on a Sunday afternoon for three people. Once seated we ordered pretty quickly since we had Time to review the menu before hand. Ordered off the small plate menu and got the following: Beet and goat cheese so delish and fresh Pear and blue cheese flat bread again tasty and fresh perfect combo for the right taste Greek salad something or another which was fresh and flavorful Tuna tartare was so mouth watering I could have ate three or four After we weren't too stuffed for a pecan pumpkin cheesecake. Hands to the food gods this thang was so fulfilling. Perfect in every way. I wanted to cradle this little baby and sing it a song.  Also needed a serious pick me up so I made sure to get a caramel macchiato with two shots of espresso. Hello. How. You. Doin?!   Meal was memorable and service was on point.
Kiki A.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/28/2016,Worst server ever! He refused to change my drink order and made everything we asked for seemed like an inconvenience. I will NEVER return to this restaurant again and deter anyone I know from ever coming here.
Melody S.,"Northside/Northline, Houston, TX",0,12,3,1.0,1/28/2016,"Food was okay. Not worth the amount we paid. My daughter couldn't even force down the kids spaghetti, the husband couldn't eat even half of his Jamaican black pepper shrimp, and while my food was okay.. There was a roach leg in my tropical tea. Will not be returning."
Lily W.,"San Diego, CA",190,222,112,4.0,8/6/2013,"I normally really dislike reviewing chain restaurants but this was a pretty decent experience. I like the cheesecake factory to an extent. I'm a fan of the Chicken Madiera and am tempted to at some point try the shrimp garlic noodles. On that note, the food here is on par with most of the other Cheesecake factories that I've been to. It's a place you go to just have a baseline expectation; this isn't going to be your foodie dream.  The cheesecake here is obviously quite good (hence the name). Please note that the portions are HUGE so order accordingly; I recommend sharing.  The staff at this location is really friendly and quite prompt but parking can be difficult because of it's location essentially in Memorial City Mall."
Christian L.,"Katy, TX",2,18,,3.0,8/11/2014,"Very good food selection. Silverware not always speckless. Waitresses not always ""into the job"" (forgot things I asked for, like lemon for my water, or to replace my fork) but the food is very good and abundant, and for the price it is still a good choice to eat out of home."
Stephanie K.,"Houston, TX",128,208,83,4.0,7/13/2013,"I always dread coming here cause parking sucks, it's loud and crowded, and everything is pretty expensive.  Nevertheless, I've never had a bad dish here. Portions are gargantuan. The pasta is always cooked perfectly. Salads are HUGE but drenched with dressing (I recommend ordering the dressing on the side).  Their cheesecakes are good but super rich. Share these with someone!"
Debby C.,"Katy, TX",0,22,,5.0,1/31/2016,"Late lunch on the Patio-I've been going to the CF for many years & the food is always great--the wait staff is always professional sometimes I would get the feeling that they were in a big rush-everything was always ok with that -until today when Abraham N was our server-He was so very professional & very personable!!!  A nice smile, great attitude. Thank you Abraham !!!!"
DeeJay F.,"Grand Prairie, TX",4,22,3,3.0,4/15/2014,Had good service but the pizza was very soggy. The outdoor area was heated and had a good ambiance. Wish the food was better.
Nadia V.,"Houston, TX",183,152,372,4.0,9/3/2012,"A word of caution - you are reading the review of a gal who would drive three hours (from the  East Carolina Coast to Raleigh) just for a slice of cheesecake (okay, and some shopping as well).  I've always been a fan of this place, especially when I could eat whatever I wanted and not have to worry about fitting into my clothes.  I was on a several year hiatus from this place just because I couldn't resist the temptation of their desserts. I mean, come on. It's cheesecake --- any way you like it! When this location opened up, I decided that I had to start revisiting because they are closer. I was SO happy to find that they have new options which include healthier selections. Their Skinny Menu is wonderful! The Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($6) and Ahi Tuna Tartar are two of my faves.  Service is always spot-on. Even though the parking stinks, we never seem to have a long wait.  Now that I dine with kids, a Kid's Menu is more important than anything else. They have more than just mac & cheese on their menu. That makes me happy. Also, $1 ice cream with the option of chocolate, vanilla, or coffee flavored. Enough said. I knocked one star because I'm bitter that they no longer make my favorite cheesecake: Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. That makes me wanna cry just a little bit, even though there are TONS of other cheesecakes to choose from.  When you are looking for something - but not sure what - this is the place. With a menu the size of a phone book, you are bound to find something that will make your tummy happy."
Jazlyn A.,"Austin, TX",32,5,5,2.0,11/23/2012,"I'm not denying the food is delicious ,but in my opinion the one in the galleria taste so much better. I'm not sure how but I order  the same thing almost every time, and after eating at the memorial one I just wasn't as satisfied. Also , since it's still fairly new the service is also better at the galleria."
Roger K.,"Deer Park, TX",44,20,10,5.0,9/13/2014,Enjoyed a great lunch prior to a business meeting. The fish and chips were very tasty and fresh. The service was great and the food was delivered very fast. I will go back again for dinner and have some cheesecake.
Brad D.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/19/2015,"Took dinner party out to eat. 2 couples wanted menu items with turkey. Waitress stayed they were out, without a reasonable explanation. Called for manager and he was not very sincere or apologetic. Tried to ""humor"" his way out of my concern. I didn't think it was very amusing. You might want to train your wait staff to inform tables immediately when they are seated of any kitchen outages, instead of waiting for the dinner party to go through the process of finally picking their menu choice, to then be told their out. Service is declining. Also, the  $15 valet fee is a poor association."
Cynthia F.,"Houston, TX",98,156,91,3.0,12/5/2012,It is a the Cheesecake Factory and it is good.  Easy place to meet for lunch with friends or family.  Huge menu which can be overwhelming.  The salads are good and the lunch menu has lots of choices.  Not my first choice but I will return when we need a place to go at the mall.  The worst part about it is the parking especially during the holiday season.  But I suppose that is to be expected.
Luis A.,"Houston, TX",5,14,3,4.0,10/19/2014,It's always a wait to sit down but the food is usually worth it. It is a chain so you expect a certain experience. Still it's not bad.
Marvin O.,"Houston, TX",36,192,910,3.0,1/10/2013,It was cool. Typical Friday night craziness. We waited about 45 mins to be seated. Server was ok. I wasn't tripping because it was busy.
Annie S.,"Houston, TX",3,24,5,2.0,4/2/2015,"First and most importantly, the service sucks big time...... I can't even think clearly about the food because of the terrible service. If you are going to visit here, my suggestion is to have your entire order ready for the first opportunity you see a waiter. Seriously!!!!!! You may not see them again.  I hate bad service and no, I don't expect speedy Gonzalez, so this is beyond just slow.  Heck, the bad food places are quicker than this giant.  If you're hungry, eat somewhere else."
