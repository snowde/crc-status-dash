James P.,"Richmond, TX",26,141,2,1.0,2/14/2012,I have visited this location several times in the last couple of years and left vowing to never return again.  The Cheesecake Factory does cheesecake well!  Most of the food that I have had there was fair as well. I have NEVER had good service at The Cheesecake Factory! The service has disappointed me every visit. It seems like they hire the rejects from fast food establishments or worse......
DD S.,"Huntsville, TX",3,49,89,4.0,7/7/2014,"Not a bad location. Typical Cheesecake Factory expectations as far as food goes. It's good but not anything amazing. Been here a few times already, parking can be tough to find sometime depending on day and time. Avoid holiday weekends....parking and wait can be absurd. Other than that everything else is great with the location. Waiter/waitresses have all been good."
Char'Dae B.,"Houston, TX",24,41,23,4.0,1/17/2014,My sister and I ate here for a long over due sisters lunch out...I loved the atmosphere the minute I walked in but what I didn't like was the 10 minute wait quote that turned into almost 30! The plates looked so good though that we didn't want to walk out and eat anywhere else ugh so tummies growling we endured the wait. We were later seated and ordered appetizers her the flat bread and myself the spinach dip.  The flat bread was great the spinach and cheese dip I've had better.  The strawberry lemonade drink was OFF THE CHAIN!!!! I mean I loved it and so did my sister.  We ordered our meals I had the Cajun jambalaya pasta it was good but needed more salt they got the spice down packed but needed more to bring it out. My sister had a pizza which looked great but she did not enjoy it. The pasta is very spicy I did almost die when I realized the waiter took my cup to refill my drink after gobbling down a few large bites of chicken lmao my sister had so much fun watching me suffer might I add!  Overall the service was great on all ends from the minute we walked in until we left out which takes this review from 3 stars to 4. For dessert i had the original cheesecake and my sister the Oreo OMG HEAVEN!! I definitely will be coming back don't know about my twin lol.
Roland B.,"Houston, TX",1,5,,4.0,8/9/2014,"Great variety and good service.  You usually have to endure a wait, but it's usually short.  I recommend the beets w/ goat cheese salad and sweet corn tamale cakes."
Melinda S.,"Austin, TX",1,26,5,3.0,7/30/2015,"Went last night after we checked into The Westin.  Party of 3..my husband,  my daughter, and myself.  There was a large crowd waiting so I assumed the wait would be long.  Walking up to hostess stand I was NOT greeted by a sour puss faced hostess. After standing there waiting for this pissy nongreeting hostess to acknowledge my presence,       She barely looked up and asked how many in my party.  I tell her 3 and she asks for a name. I very politely ask her how long the wait is...she very rudely says 30 min.  As I am standing there I witness her speak to another customer in a completely rude manner.  I'm shocked that this is the individual The Cheesecake Factory puts in front of house to be the ""greeter"" of their customers.   We ended up waiting about 20 min before our buzzer went off.. I brought the pager back up to the stand only to be rudely told to move to the right to wait to be seated.   After 10 min we were finally seated outside. The rest of the evening went very smoothly.  Our server, Larry, was on the ball and the food was great. I could have easily given this 5 stars but the hostess was absolutely terrible."
Marcus B.,"Katy, TX",50,28,5,4.0,6/21/2014,"Very good service, very good food. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the weather, even had dessert."
Tabitha F.,"Houston, TX",0,15,,1.0,1/11/2015,"Worst To Go service ever!  I've tried ordering to go because there is never any parking and it is crowded.  I've  concluded after 2-3 attempts that To Go is not an option either.  The wait on a weekend evening is well over an hour, you have to park illegally at the curb to go in to the counter, and you're not guaranteed to get what you order.  Twice now, I've ordered something and then shown up to be told that they didn't have what I ordered so my order was on hold pending confirmation.  So frustrating!  I recommend going to a different location unless you can walk to this one and have plenty of time to wait for the food to arrive."
Kristin B.,"Houston, TX",262,7,17,3.0,7/11/2014,"I find the menu closer to the Great American novel than a typical restaurant menu, but once you close your eyes & make a choice, the food arrives quickly. My hibachi steak was cooked just right. The asparagus tempura was crispy & fresh, and the wasabi potatoes were flavorful."
Ron W.,"Cypress, TX",1,5,,2.0,1/27/2014,"The food was consistent with this chain from other locations.  Service and attitude from the staff were outstanding, but it all fell apart at the end when nobody (out of five waiters) could figure out how to split a check.  It took THIRTY FIVE minutes to get our check after initial request.  Today's point of sale (POS) systems are very simple with ""drag & drop"" features for splitting checks.  How does restaurant management fail to recognize that turning tables faster increases the revenue per hour per table?  Irritated customers will not return for future business, and will instead seek other restaurants that are more efficient and respectful of a customer's time. TRAIN your staff on how to use the point of sale system!"
Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",14,83,31,3.0,6/13/2013,"Recently I was shopping in Memorial Mall and decided I wanted some lunch.  The question was, what did I want?  I definitely didn't want food court, I wasn't in the mood for Panera Bread, or California Pizza Kitchen, and Beck's Prime was more then I wanted to spend.  So by process of elimination I ended up at Cheesecake Factory. Now that's not necessarily a bad thing to me because I've usually gotten pretty good food at Cheesecake Factory.  I've always thought it was overpriced, but not outrageously so, and I've always been content when I left the table. I was seated shortly after my arrival at a mini booth near the door and given the menu, which is actually a book.  I'm not kidding, it's a real book, and it is an extensive one at that.  I thought about getting the mini sliders, or even the chicken mini sliders from the appetizer menu (lamenting that there was no sampler plate all the while) but I finally noticed the Cuban in the sandwich section.  I love a good Cuban, and it was a simple task to tell the waiter to make sure they left the mayo off my sandwich.  Who puts mayo on a Cuban?  Seriously?    Happily they complied with my request and my sandwich came mayo free a short time later.  Portion quantity was just fine.  There were plenty of fries that were hot and fresh cut, and the sandwich was big enough for me to take half home and eat half at the table.  And it was a well made sandwich.  The bread was perfect, it came freshly made and the meat and cheese were all pressed together nicely.  My meal also include freshly made brown bread to nibble on while waiting for me entree to come out.  The service was very polite, prompt and attentive without being intrusive. So why am I only giving 3 stars?  I know this is going to sound a little ditzy but the roast pork wasn't processed enough.  They literally cut a slice of roast pork loin to put on this sandwich, and while that sounds really great, it also ended up containing a fair amount of fat in the meat.  If you've read my other reviews you know what a problem that is for me.  In this case it didn't ruin the meal for me but I do wish they would have culled some of the fat out of the meat before putting it on my sandwich.  The other reason I'm going with 3 stars is that Cheesecake Factory IS overpriced.  I went in knowing that and was prepared for it but it still rankled me when the bill comes.   I mean honestly paying over $15 for a sandwich and fries while drinking water is a bit much in my opinion.  God forbid I had added the strawberry lemonade they make (which is awesomely good but upsets my acid reflux), or a slice of cheesecake (which is also awesomely good no matter what flavor you get, but also awesomely bad for you and expensive too).  If I had done that I would have ended up spending $25 on lunch for one and I just can't justify that. In the end I really want to love The Cheesecake Factory, but I can only afford to like it as a casual acquaintance who occasionally wows me and occasionally disappoints me.  Love requires more consistency at these prices."
Gayathri I.,"Houston, TX",96,213,30,3.0,9/20/2011,"Well, it's the Cheesecake factory--home of the 2000+ calories entrees. It is a chain, it is family friendly and somewhat reliable in churning out barely above average food that will likely clog up your arteries.  BUT I take my veggie burgers seriously because that's one of the one foods that I can reliably get in most places. Check out their new in-house veggie burger from the skinny menu (their skinny menu=less than 700 calories. No, that is not a joke). No, not the boca black bean burger but a bean+beets+ really veggies patty burger. It is really, really good. Far better tasting than even Ruggles."
Taylor H.,"Canyon, TX",1,12,1,1.0,6/10/2015,Went here for my birthday dinner and our waitress was SUPER dirty.. She was picking at scabs on her face WHILE delivering food. Here's the worst part... She came to our table to take our orders and one of her sores on her face started OOZING blood and it got ALL over the floor and almost on my dress.. Worst part was they didn't even give our meals discounted or anything.. Worst experience ever..
Mady N.,"Missouri City, TX",0,10,,1.0,6/8/2014,"WORST SERVICE EVER !!! Attempted to celebrate my mom and brothers' birthday this Saturday at Cheesecake, but it turned into a birthday to try to forget. First off, we waited over 2 1/2 hours to be seated. Next, our waiter comes and his sole purpose is to first see how we are paying on the ticket...No bread, no drinks. Finally he takes drink orders, returns and asks about appetizers. He only takes an appetizer order from two people at the table and then leaves to ring it up. The rest of us are sitting there just waiting. My husband waves at him to return so that others can order appetizers too. At this point, we are all wondering what is wrong here. So he takes appetizer orders, and we don't see him again for some time until he comes back with another young waitress. She looks confused and new and she says she is going to help with dinner orders. Mind you, we are still waiting on BREAD after an over two hour wait to be seated. But everybody is still calm. The young lady begins taking orders, but the male waiter never returns. We see him helping other tables! Finally he comes back to our table with bread, this is probably 30 mins into us sitting down, and we never see him again. The new waitress is left to wait on us, and she was clearly overwhelmed with a 10 top table. She takes our orders, but during our long wait, no one refills our drinks, asks if we need anything or comes to our table. We had to stop a bus boy to ask for water and finally when the waitress did return, she refilled one side of the table's drinks and not the other! I just could not believe the service we were receiving, seeing that I am a frequent Cheesecake visitor (sugarland/galleria locations) and I have always received great service at those two locations. So finally the food comes out, and they are missing my plate and my brother's father in law's plate. No condiments for the people who had food and still no drink refills. At this point,we are just over it. My whole family finishes their food and our food never comes out!!! The waitress tells us a manager will be over, but one never comes. My family is literally packed up and ready to leave before a manager approaches.  She has a dry apology and asks us if we want free dessert or soup. My husband was like, No, they would like their food orders. She didn't even offer our meals free at first until my husband spoke up for us. She said they stopped the order, but magically she came back with our food packed up and ready to go in less than 10 mins. So either the food was just back their sitting or they just gave us someone else's food. Who knew at this point. I was just ready to leave. We had been there since 2:30 and it was now 7pm!!! To add insult to injury, it took the waitress another 30 mins to ring us out and they messed up some of the payments. What a birthday to remember. This was the worst dining experience I have ever been through and the worst part was when they sung happy birthday to my mom and brother, they did it with only 2 wait staff. Really? It was pitiful and I felt so bad for my brother because he picked this location. I could tell he was hurt and embarrassed and it was his birthday to enjoy."
Denise M.,"Katy, TX",0,12,,4.0,7/13/2012,"Excellent & service- Cheesecake very good, food is well portioned and tasty.  Only complaints: Its extremely too dark inside to read the menu the waiter was helpful & knowledgeable, but I prefer to be able to see what's what all is available on the menu- lighting made me uncomfortable. Its kinda loud as well, we were near the kitchen/ wait staff was rowdy there.  Cannot always afford to dine here  since it's pricey. I am handicapped and usally it has been OK for parking, although  it appears that regular parking spots are hard to find at this location."
Jennifer H.,"Houston, TX",110,82,9,3.0,4/14/2011,"Well we finally woke up early enough on the weekend to go to breakfast before 2pm so we hit up the new Cheesecake in Memorial City. Very nice decor, nothing less that what you would accept from them, and the little outdoor patio area is very nice on a perfect weather day. I was thinking they offered there brunch menu on Sat. and Sun., but turns out they only have it on Sunday, so I'm there on the wrong day. I did order an omlet my way, which was very tasty, there portions on everything are extremely large so I couldn't even finish everything on my plate. Baby had been craving some Shepherd's Pie and thought he would give theirs a try, needless to say, it did not hit the spot. Of course there version wasn't quite what he had in mind. We did end up getting some cheesecake to go, I got the vanilla bean and he had the gigantic carrot cake, the desserts were awesome as usual. Will definetely go again, with different choices, preferably on a Sunday for the brunch."
Kristin H.,"Houston, TX",348,207,103,3.0,2/18/2011,"Dammit! I wanted the FTR on this one.  I went this past Sunday and they didn't have the business listed yet, so I couldn't check in. I went at 3:00PM on a Sunday and even then, there was an hour wait on a table. So my party of seven decided that they wanted to sit around and wait for an hour rather than go and wander the mall for that hour. We sat outside in the beautiful weather for about 30 minutes while I stared longingly at the covered patio/lounge are that was virtually empty. I finally got fed up with sitting on the hard bench (back problems) and marched up to the hostess to ask her if we could sit in the lounge area while we waited. I ran back outside as fast as I could in my heels to announce that yes, we could indeed sit in the lounge area. I then plopped down onto thick cushioned seats with much enthusiasm as my party followed. We were then approached by a server who informed us that we could order drinks, appetizers and desserts on the lounge and our hungry tummies decided that it was a very good idea to sit at the lounge after all. I ordered fried calamari and a glass of St. Arnolds Lawn Mower and a friend ordered Buffalo Blasts. The calamari was your usual calamari. The buffalo blast was not what I expected at all. It was deep fried cheese (the menu says there is chicken in there too but I didn't taste/feel any) with buffalo sauce and blue cheese on the side. I happened to enjoy it very much. And maybe it tasted so good because it was freshly tapped, but dang that glass of St. Arnolds was the single best glass of Lawn Mower I've ever had! You have to close and pay before you move from lounge to reserved table, and timing seemed too good to be true. Right when our tickets were signed, we were notified that our table was free and we could have a seat inside. I wish I could tell you that everything was smooth sailing from there but it wasn't. Our server was crap! He seemed generally confused and took or drink orders out of order (started on corners, and then got the people in the middle). We have a very small child in our group who needs a child cup with a little plastic lid and a straw. Our server on the lounge didn't seem to have a problem making that accommodation without being asked. He came back a few minutes later with everyone's order but mine and the little girl's. Seeing everyone's drink order in, she got happy and wanted her juice, and then she began to cry because he didn't have it for her. He finally brought me my coffee and her juice, but he brought her an adult glass. We sent him back for a kiddie cup. Service after that was generally pretty slow. it was two hours before we could finally get out of the door. I never give a crappy tip, but this guy was about to get one. And then, would you believe it? We were hit with an 18% gratuity charge. I didn't want to pay a penny of it!  The general consensus of the table was that the food wasn't so great (aside from the lettuce wrap). I ordered fish tacos. Very pretty, but bland and tasteless. I tried to squeeze some lime juice in to try and liven up the flavor a bit, but the lime crumbled into pulp and didn't produce any juice. I ask for more and they all produced the same results. The only saving grace? Cheesecake. I ordered the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cake Cheesecake and the Pineapple Upside Down Cake Cheesecake and threw them in the freezer to wait there for the next time I got to see a friend.  The Reese's was very heavy and rich. The flavor was fantastic, but I can't imagine having all of it by myself. The Pineapple Upside Down on the other hand? Mmm! Light and fluffy layers of cake slathered with pineapple sauce and a layer of cheesecake! I almost ate the whole thing by myself... but felt guilty because my friend did finish his and that would just make me look like a glutton."
Paula M.,"Katy, TX",0,37,,1.0,2/15/2016,"I have never dined at this location before but always had a good experience at the Galleria Mall location.  The only complaint there is slow service.  Here on the other hand, my experience was terrible.  Grant you, on a ""holiday"" weekend the wait was only 30 mins. on a Saturday and the waitress worked hard at accommodating us and the next table VERY CLOSE to us.  All she had to do was turn to the left and take their order then turn to the right and get ours.  This is not the setting for a romantic Valentine's dinner!  I felt like we were sitting at the same table with the one next to ours.  Also, it was too crowded, loud and we couldn't carry on a private conversation without yelling at one another. To top it all off; the silverware, plates and glasses had food particles all over them.  They were filthy!! I notified the staff and with apology they brought me a new glass, again dirty.  Our appetizer came out, again on a dirty dish.  I again asked the staff, please touch this and tell me if this is the way the plate is supposed to be.  He did, and stated ""No, I don't think so.""  ""Do you want me to get you another?""  Yum, NO...and bring back another dirty plate?  I suggested that their dish washer was not getting the job done and food particles were getting all over the dishes.  I just asked, since we are already here and I have invested my time thus far can you make sure my dinner is on a clean plate?  The food was good but because it started out as such a disaster we opted to take our cheesecake to-go so we could enjoy the rest of our evening at home, in private."
Monique J.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,5.0,5/3/2015,"Our experience at Cheesecake Factory was terrible, the food was over cooked (burned to be exact). It's so sad when u pay for over priced food and u leave wanting to eat again. Just saying they really need to step it up... Also, nothing is worse than when u get to restaurant  and their out of everything."
JP W.,"Houston, TX",18,86,8,4.0,3/16/2011,You really can't go wrong at this place. The menu's have such a huge selection one can really choose anything to eat from. And it's all pretty good.  Only problem as to why I have not given it 5 stars is that about 75% of the time the waiters are usually all out of breath and sweating. Like they are forced to sprint uphill in double sweatpants before they come to the table every time*. *think Pappasito's waiters/waitresses for reference.
Don C.,"Jersey Village, TX",124,547,278,3.0,10/13/2013,two pieces of cheesecake and a coffee $20-  I could go for half the size and half the price along with half the wait.
