Ann S.,"San Diego, CA",28,141,26,3.0,12/1/2013,"It's a Cheesecake Factory. You wait for a table, menu is about 50 pages long, portions are gigantic and the food is consistently mediocre. Our server was friendly, food came fast. Bathroom was clean."
Kimberly N.,"Houston, TX",11,29,5,5.0,7/26/2011,So I had the best buffalo chicken sandwich of my life here!!!! It was perfection! Then to top it off had the red velvet cheesecake. I know its a chain and it might change from location to location but the cheesecake factory in memorial is amazeballs!!!!!! Watch out for parking though. Its in the mall so on weekends and evenings parking is a nightmare
Benji D.,"Houston, TX",134,10,,2.0,9/8/2012,"I was warned prior to coming to this location about the atrocious service, but being the kind of person who would rather have an experience for myself I decided to come out and check out the Memorial Location .. and I was blown away by how accurate the warnings were. I am certain a horde of dead people would move with more purpose than the waiters. With so many waiters just standing around I am confused why our server seemed completely frazzled. We had to ask for pretty much everything you would expect as a restaurant: bread, plate, refills, all of it. Next, when we asked why there was such a delay in service as oppose to simply 'Let me get a manager', or something of the sort, she rambled excuse after excuse for the poor service. Now, for some of the good; the food was delicious. Everything everyone ordered was cooked right and tasted great, even if it took a good while for it all to come out. The cheesecake, of course, was perfect, even if it too took ages to come out. Our waitress just didn't seem really attentive.  Cheesecake Factory has always been good food, but when the food is side by side with abhorred service I would definitely not waste coming here again. If you are craving Cheesecake Factory then make the extra trip to the Galleria area, or if you don't mind having to tell your server how to do their job proper, and simply don't want to worry about leaving a tip, then I would say take the gamble with the Memorial location."
Natalie G.,"Houston, TX",13,62,27,4.0,9/19/2013,I fell in love with the cheesecake factory when one of my friends convinced me to meet her here some time a go.  I tend to go here for birthday celebrations. I never have to wait too long to get seated and the customer service s always spectacular.  Yes the proces are on the high side but I am willing to pay for the money when it comes to birthday lunches.
Nena M.,"Katy, TX",137,57,7,3.0,7/15/2013,Nothing spectacular to say about this location.  They were out of sangria (sad face!) but the pineapple mojito wasn't bad.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at this location vs. another one but the service was good and they didn't kick us out even though we realized we were there 15 min after closing.  Oops :)
Inez M.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",0,22,1,1.0,11/8/2012,"Tonite's experience at Cheese Cake Factory/Memorial City:   Two appetizers consisting of 4 tiny spicy crunch appetizers $7.50 + Tasteless, I mean Tasteless! popcorn shrimp $10.95 (we could've had an entire meal for $10.95!) and 2 slices cheesecake $7.50 each (ok, price for cheesecake somewhat within reason)  = Total $35.  And the service was absolutely horrible; very slow, had to stick my head out to find our waiter who was laughing it up with co-workers.    He got a 98-cents tip, the change from the $36 I left."
Alicia E.,"Houston, TX",1,10,2,1.0,5/30/2012,"I took my mother to lunch a couple of months ago at the Cheesecake Factory at Memorial City Mall.  It was our first time at this location.  Our food tasted ok - nothing worth ordering again.  While we were waiting for the check, I began to feel sick to my stomach and had to run to the bathroom.  Long story short, after many trips to the toilet for both me and my mom, I called them to complain.  I spoke to a manager, Stephanie, and was told that their corporate office handled these issues.  So she took my name, number, receipt number, and told us someone would get back with us.  That never happened.  Later in the day, I called again and was given the number to their guest relations department in California.  The only issue is that they close at 4pm! Finally, one week later, my call was returned.  They apologized for the quality issue and told me that they were going to send me a gift card in the amount I spent (they do not give refunds).  Of course, I never received anything in the mail. If you do go to the Cheesecake Factory, I hope your experience is a good one.  Their lack of customer service and inability to handle issues locally will keep me from ever going there again."
Andrew H.,"Spring, TX",41,180,12,3.0,3/27/2013,"Hey it's a little bit of everything done decently. Nothing great, nothing bad."
James S.,"Houston, TX",16,114,35,1.0,12/12/2012,Hostess station is unable to quote an accurate wait time so we waited an hour after being told 15 min. Poor logistics management.
Alan H.,"Meyerland, Houston, TX",3,49,1,3.0,9/23/2012,"We took our daughter here for her 13th Birthday as she is crazy about cheese cake.  The atmosphere was nice, it was clean and had nice big booths, the fresh bread and butter were great and the cheese cake although a bit pricey was very good.  A couple of negatives..... The cheesecake was really good, but not so impressed with the entrees; average.  We noticed quite a few flies which always takes a bit away from the appetite.  We also noticed that all the wait staff were dressed in all white, which is fine, however, many of them looked dirty (especially our waitress) & it was early afternoon so couldn't have been open for long. Manager needs to supervise wait staff a bit better to ensure that they are washing/bleaching there uniforms.  Will likely go back some day, but only for the cheesecake."
Linda C.,"Midtown, Houston, TX",498,39,52,2.0,7/14/2012,"One waiter, did.not get food right. Husband was completely finished with his lunch when I got mine. Terrible service. This was the Memorial City  location."
Brandon L.,"Memorial, Houston, TX",0,7,1,4.0,10/16/2013,"I'm new to the big city, and I had heard about the Cheesecake Factory from coworkers, so I decided to try it out. It was a bit pricey, but the food and the service was worth it. They had a great selection of beer, which is a huge plus for me. I decided to order the locally brewed Saint Arnold and the Chicken Bellagio. The service was outstanding. The meal came hot and fresh, I didn't have to wait long for drinks from the bar, and the server came right when I needed him. Maybe it's just the transition to the ""big city"", but I know I'll be going back there often!"
Wendy R.,"Houston, TX",0,8,,1.0,5/14/2014,"Horrible service, hateful manager, and dirty environment.  Galleria location is so much better."
Richard W.,"Austin, TX",0,38,,2.0,1/30/2012,"I have been to several Cheesecake locations, woodlands, galleria, memorial, etc. This location does not seem to rate as well IMO. The wait time is long, the service is subpar, and I have not been impressed with their food here. I have given this place 3 chances, and I think the 3rd was my last attempt. I will go back to the Galleria or Woodlands if I ever want to go back."
Tommy H.,"Houston, TX",205,19,28,1.0,2/14/2012,first off i started with stuffed mushrooms. they were quite good. then i had the spinich dip.... was very bland... then i had the pan seared tuna tataki salad.... was 16.99 i believe and the tuna came out white on the outside... brown on the inside... then pink in the center.... something tells me it wasn't very fresh :). i returned it and they were nice enough to not make me pay for it thank god.... then i had the jambalaya pasta..... was bland and not spicy at all...the shrimp was wayyyyy overcooked.... but the chicken was on point ...... :/ if you are going to call it jambalaya it should taste like authentic creole food :/..... the red velvet  cheesecake was good though :/
J C.,"Houston, TX",0,33,,1.0,2/10/2014,"Absolutely a terrible visit!   I took my wife for her birthday to this restaurant (her choice, not mine) as well as her aunt, sister and sister's daughter.  We had such a terrible, terrible visit and I would not advise going to this restaurant until you see continually improving reviews. To start, the wait was almost unimaginable.  The hostess told us 20-35 minutes and we ended up waiting 50 minutes for a table.  When we walked around there were several tables open.  Likewise, we told the hostess we wanted first available and then when I checked with the hostess she had us down for inside-only which was the primary cause for the long wait (her mistake).  When we were seated, we waited at least 5-7 minutes before a server came along.  He said he was not our sever but was going to help us in the meantime.  However, we were never served by someone else so I guess he was the only server for our table.  When the appetizers came 30 minutes after being ordered the server forgot the bread plates so our appetizers got cold.  We had to continually ask him for silverware, plates and sugar for tea.  After about 10 minutes of him not returning with sugar I said ""sir!"" and his response was ""I got you.""  I've never had a server speak so rudely infront of guests.  Once our needs were somewhat met, he never returned.   When the dinner arrived we were missing one entree for 10 minutes.  When it arrived the bread was completely soggy so my sister-in-law asked for new bread.  She waited another 15 minutes while they replaced the entire sandwich.... All she wanted was new bread.   The floor outside was greasy and disgusting.  Likewise, the bathrooms were absolutely terrible.  My sister-in-law didn't even let her daughter walk in the bathroom and when she had to go again later in the evening she asked her daughter if she could wait so they didn't have to go into the digusting bathrooms again.  On her way back, she almost slipped in the walkway due to the wet floors.  Mind you, she is pregnant and was holding her 3 year old daughter. Overall, this was the worst restaurant visit I have had in Houston, ever.  If it wasn't for it being my wife's birthday as well as having a hungry child we would have immediately walked out.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone until management fixes the tremendous amounts of problems."
Dusty D.,"Cypress, TX",37,37,71,1.0,8/14/2011,"We've been to The Cheesecake Factory a few times, both this location and the one in the Galleria area.  We've never had a bad experience (until now), just average.  Their food is alright, after all their gimmick is their cheesecake selection, not their food.  Anyway, my family and I decided to go here last night to celebrate a birthday and two graduations.  From the moment we arrived the night went downhill.  They don't take reservations, which I have always thought is a mistake, but we knew that going in.  We had a large party and were told the wait would be about an hour to an hour and a half.  It seemed a bit excessive, especially at 5:30 pm but we decided to wait.  Luckily the wait was only about 35 minutes.  The first big problem occurred as soon as we were seated.  They had us spread out over several tables, we decided to push them together so we could dine together, as intended.  Upon seeing this our server stated that we had made his job more difficult by pushing the tables together, funny I thought we were there for our benefit, not his.  After taking our drink and appetizer orders it took about 20 minutes for him to return for our entree orders.  In this time we were still awaiting our drinks from the bar.  After 2 reminders he finally did bring them (with no apology for the tardiness).  We ordered our food and did not see him again until the food was served, about 25 minutes later, again a bit long.  One of our meals, a steak, was cooked the wrong way so it was sent back.  We waited another 20 minutes for the replacement steak to be delivered, after rarely seeing the waiter and reminding him about the steak once.  It finally came, as everyone else was nearing the end of their dining.  This time the steak seemed to be cooked correctly but had been cut open (butterfly style) and flipped over.  Odd, since this is not a way we have ever seen a steak cooked nor was it the way the first (incorrect) steak was delivered.  Upon inquiring about this the server didn't seem to know anything about it so we requested a manager.  The manager explained that this is how the kitchen staff are told to cook steaks to help cook them quickly (since it was sent back but ironically did not come out quickly at all) he also agreed with us that it was not any way a steak should ever be cooked, but that was how they did things here.  Hmmm??? Long story short we went back and forth with the manager regarding the experience and what could/should be done.  He offered us a free cheesecake for our troubles.  This seemed alright since that is what they are known for and this would, cost-wise, be an acceptable resolution.  However, instead of this we were given a $25 gift card and begged to return.  That's it.  We paid full-price for our entire meal despite the fact it took over 2 hours, we had horrible service, a mouthy waiter with an extreme attitude problem, and a meal that was poorly cooked and served twice.  The one bright spot was the fact that the girl who helped our table was extremely nice and apologetic for our problems, even though none were her fault.  She just got stuck with a crappy co-worker.  We told the manager that she should get the full tip rather than split it with the waiter.  We also requested the gratuity be removed from our bill since he didn't deserve any kind of tip.  This at least they did.   We will not be visiting this restaurant again.  Their food is average, nothing special.  The cheesecake is great but not worth the service and experience we suffered."
Katrena O.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,3,,2.0,12/23/2013,"I just visited today this Cheesecake Factory. How is it if you call a cab no one knows at the hostess check in who the cab is for??? As a result, the cab came, and LEFT!!!!Hmmm... Hostess get it together here together, please!!! We requested our cab at the bar. If your intoxicated, please have another plan!!!! So annoyed!!! We had to wait another 30-45 min for another cab!!!!!!!!"
Tien T.,"Houston, TX",166,106,210,4.0,3/18/2012,"cheeeesecake! that automatically gives this place 3 stars. come on. its cheese. in cake form! this location has treated me well. the staff is friendly and helpful. my one go to dish has always been the pasta di vinci, which is borderline amazing. my two baby cousins absolutely love it. the chicken alfredo with sundried tomatoes is also a good go-to for you carb/pasta lovers. the only issue ive had with this place is the parking. sometimes it gets WAY too crowded and i end up having to park by the target and walking on over. i guess its good exercise after cheesecake, but really? talk about hiking!  overall good place, they have a nice patio to be out on during the fall time (i dont recommend being outside ever anywhere in houston during the summer)"
Travis B.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,1.0,8/18/2013,Front staff and management is sub par. We called in to check to see what the wait time was and was told there was no wait and to come in. Upon on arrival 5 min later and after valet parking our car we were then told the wait time was 45 min. Management failed to take responsibility. Very disappointed.
