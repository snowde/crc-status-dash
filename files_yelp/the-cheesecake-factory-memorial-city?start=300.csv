Suemy K.,"Houston, TX",116,139,63,3.0,8/11/2011,"I usually do not like franchises but I have to admit that Cheesecake's food does not disappoint.  For the sake of convenience and price, it is worth it.  The sangria is surprisingly good and their new skinnylicious (yes, i know!) menu offers cheaper entress.  There are several items under $10 and the portions are large.  You can order several items with friends and have a variety of options to eat.  Another pro: they are open late!"
Anthony S.,"Houston, TX",35,59,2,3.0,1/15/2012,Good chain. Good food. Large portions. Worth going to if nearby and hungry.
J T.,"Simpsonville, SC",0,14,,5.0,5/16/2012,"Great decor. There was a bit of a wait but a manager offered us bar area seating with no wait - same great service. Our waiter was very spot on with everything. Professional, personable, and genuine. The food was amazing! Everything was seasoned to perfection - just a burst of flavor in every bite. Even our daughter loved her food - including her fries. Will definitely return! I do agree with a previous reviewer and wish they would offer a cheesecake sampler plate with small pieces of your choice of a few different types. That seems to be the ONLY thing missing on their massive menu."
Fun Times Ahead B.,"Houston, TX",0,40,,1.0,5/22/2013,"Don't waste your money or your time, be it in the restaurant or takeout  - horrible service, either way.  Cheesecake is about the only thing they don't mess up.  What's with the management here?  Even spoke to them regarding a takeout order and ""the manager was going to investigate it and get back to me""...well four days later and still nothing."
Hope L.,"Houston, TX",0,146,,4.0,6/26/2013,"love the large portions, hate how loud it is. all cheesecake factories are designed with A LOT of smooth surfaces which means the sound bounces like crazy. i suppose the idea is that if it's loud, people will think the restaurant is busy and booming and popular. i personally hate that. i'd like to have a conversation without having to yell or strain to hear. that said, i get take out here pretty regularly. the portions are huge enough to share with another person and still have some left over.  try- firecracker salmon rolls, chicken marsala pasta, louisiana chicken pasta, 30th anniversary cheesecake avoid- appetizer crab cakes (try the crab cake sandwich- it is much better)"
L A.,"Houston, TX",0,30,,3.0,3/15/2011,"We have been trying to visit this location, but the mall parking situation has been bad until now.  It was a sunny, but nice day and we asked to eat outside.  The hostess was very attentive and found us a spot under an umbrella, but just as we sat down the server moved it away.  We told him we were shown that spot just for the shade, but he said other people wanted it and took it away.  That was not acceptable to us, so I told him we would find another table rather than be served by him.  Hostess was again gracious and we choose a place inside.  Now to the food - I had the lunch soup and small sandwich combo, partner had the cobb salad.  Both were delicious.  Our server this time was attentive and nice.  Overall a good place for lunch, but not top rated due to that outside server's attitude.  If I had been a manager there, he would have been fired."
Sucre M.,"Houston, TX",0,18,,4.0,1/18/2014,I love this place!  The food is great and the happy hour specials are awesome.  The only drawback to happy hour is that it ends at 6 and not 7 with the heavy traffic in Houston and the drinks are weak.  This location has a nice patio area too.
Kathleen P.,"Rice Military, Houston, TX",0,3,,5.0,1/31/2014,Our waitress Nikita was so great! We really enjoyed our dinner and she was very accommodating when we asked to share two entrees and even brought one out early to serve as an appetizer!
Taraneh A.,"Chicago, IL",4,41,,4.0,6/8/2011,"friendly staff. easy to park. cheesecake is amazing.  menu is overwhelming. plates are large, anything can be shared.  quick service while at the bar. lunch hour comes with a wait."
Elizabeth M.,"Houston, TX",1,52,,1.0,4/15/2012,"First things first.  We sat at the bar (our choice, there was plenty of seating elsewhere).  We ordered crab cakes, which were absolutely some of the best I've ever had.  My drink was pretty good (I had a couple of Mojitos and my husband had some beer). The service was the absolute worst I've had in a long, long, time.  It wasn't that the bartenders were unfriendly - they weren't - they seemed like nice kids, just clueless. After our initial order for the appetizer and drinks, they forgot we were there.  And this was with the restaurant and bar half empty.  We had to ask for water, we had to ask for silverware, we had to ask the bartender for another drink order.    Our third (and final) drink order I literally had to flag down our bartender with my napkin!  Like waving it over my head so he could see it.  The other bartender stopped him to tell him I was trying to flag him down (can u believe??!!)  I ordered a coffee and a beer for my husband.  When he eventually brought the beer, I asked him for the check and the unbelievable happened - he started to pay attention to us; I got the distinct impression he was very interested in getting a good tip because he really talked us up.  We got the check and proceeded to pay at the register on the way out (oh, he charged us for the coffee which we never got).  I did purchase a slice of their very delicious upside down cheesecake to-go at the dessert bar on the way out - final insult - it was about 1/4 of the size of the slices they serve at the restaurant - and $8.00 at that (sigh) - at this point I didn't even care anymore, I just wanted out of there.  I will NEVER go back to that location.  What a sad excuse for a customer-service establishment."
Melissa S.,"Houston, TX",91,14,,2.0,5/17/2012,"When I first entered this place,I was like ""Whoa this place is bright!"" The lighting from the windows were discouraging. Unlike the Galleria area,this place was too bright for me. Its already bad enough wearing white working in a restaurant and it gets really dirty,but as a customer I would prefer to not see how dirty you are. With all the lighting that is in that restaurant I could see it all,how dirty their clothes and shoes were. Customer service was okay,I wouldn't say the were the best,just ""okay."" Our drinks were empty for quite some time before the waiter realized that we needed more. I wouldn't go back to this location,I would prefer the Woodlands or Galleria one over this one. It seemed like they hire anyone who walk thru the door because the staff seemed untrained. Weren't friendly,seemed like they hated their job. Unlike the other location where we were greeted with smiles and friendly faces."
Mike M.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,5.0,3/22/2013,"I was waited on by a very pretty waitress named Laura. She was very attentive and helpful throughout the meal. The food was good, but the service was some of the best I've ever had. Would definitely come here again."
n l.,"Spring, TX",0,27,24,1.0,9/1/2011,"I have visited several Cheesecake Factory location in Houston.  Tonight dining was the most worst and terrible experience I ever encountered with the service I received from our waitress.  At first, she had an attitude with us.  I was fine...maybe she had a rough date or very busy serving big table.  I'm in service field as well so I understand how rough it can be someday.  When I asked would you mind to bring out more wheat bread, she didn't even bother to look at my face and respond ""NO NO NO"".  I was like?????What was wrong with her?  Then it took her super long time to take our order.  Then she disappeared for a long time.  Then showed up and asked to clean our table when we were still working on our food.  We told her that she needs to improve on her service skills and not very please with her service today.  I responded quickly ""She's in this business for long time and she also took care a large party right before us"".  After all of that, she put down the tab on our table.  After several minutes (maybe 5 minutes max.), she came back and asked if we were ready to pay.  OKAY...I was like where were you when I needed to order the food?????  Overall, she was very rude, lack of professionalism, did not understand or know how to define the word ""SERVICE = TIPS"".  Cheesecake Factory needs to re-train their staffs again especially this particular waitress.  Whatever we tried to give her a feedback or recommendation to improve on her service skills in the future, she quickly back talk with an EXCUSES.  I will not return this place anymore.  Very DISAPPOINTED AND DISSATISFIED with the service I received today plus food is average so I would not want to waste my time and money to return to a place that can't even provide an appropriate service.  I rather visit McDonald's after what I been through tonight."
Jannette A.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,4.0,7/29/2011,A group of friends and I decided to get together for a bite and drinks there for the first time and we just loved it! Great service great food and most of all very delicious CHEESECAKE.
bentley s.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,4.0,10/15/2011,"I like the food at this Cheesecake factory location a lot more than others I've been to. I especially like getting steak and there's a jambalaya noodle dish.  Food is good, and I always get cheesecake for desert. One slice is so big and filling, so I usually split it with 2 or three other people! I like the godiva chocolate, red velvet, and strawberry cheesecake..these are all really good!!"
