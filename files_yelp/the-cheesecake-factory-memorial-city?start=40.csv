Stefany B.,"Westside, Houston, TX",56,3,,3.0,10/29/2017,"I've been here a lot of times and the food is delicious, but I have to agree with some other customers, the service is no good, sometimes the staff treats you like you are bothering them just for being in there! That includes someone who I think is the manager, a blonde guy (not sure). But overall the cheesecakes are amazing, if they improve the staff I might give the restaurant a 5 star next time I go!  Today I visited The Cheesecake Factory at Memorial City Mall and the experience was AWFUL at first I seat outside and the heater was so high I felt I was in hell, sad because the weather was amazing... I gently asked the staff if they could turn it down a little bit but the answer was NO! Then they send me inside and had to wait again for a new table. Once we were seated the staff didn't even asked me if I wanted water for about 15-20 minutes, I had to ask the waitress if she could please take my order. When the food came they didn't bring my sides and my daughters so we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. Finally when I asked for the check, they charged me for my daughters side (which was usually included on the meal) but apparently now they don't include it and the waitress didn't even warn me about it.... at the end, at least they removed the side charge. If I could just review the waitress NICOLE I'll give her -1 stars but since it's the first time this happens I'll just reduce my rating of the restaurant to 3 stars!!! So sad this happened and no one even apologize for it, very bad customer service !!!!"
Emely A.,"Richmond, TX",578,65,68,3.0,5/31/2017,This particular Cheesecake Factory is pretty slow on service guys. It was just me and one other person and we waited for maybe ten minutes for a waiter to even show up and ask us what drinks we wanted. I also feel like the timing of the appetizer/entree was way off. It all got there at the same time and granted it isnt the waiters fault necesarily but still I did notice he had a few tables and didnt make it to kitchen to drop off our initial order for the appetizer in time. He was real cool though and perhaps he was new so that could explain the slower service. This location really needs to hire better hostesses thats for sure. The girls working here are uninviting and unwelcoming. I had to say HI loudly in order to get these girls to stop their conversation and acknowledge me. That was totally awkward for me to have to do and unnecessary period. The parking is always normally a nightmare here so be prepared to valet or have shitty parking.  For food choices I always recommend the eggrolls for an appetizer and any noodle dish is usually pretty good. Chicken madeira is also a tasty entree.
MC F.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,44,66,4.0,4/11/2017,"Here's a great tip when dining with a group: GO SOMEWHERE THAT HAS A HUGE MENU. And here's another tip: if that place happens to offer 35 different kinds of cheesecake, you are an INSTANT hero ;) I brought my nieces and nephews here for dinner before catching a movie at the Cinemark around the corner. The kids had a great time collectively choosing appetizers in addition to their entrees; however, while most of what we had was very good, there were some misses... Appetizers: Fried Calamari was very crispy and seasoned well. Accompanying sauces (marinara and tarter) were great compliments. Cheesecake Factory always does a great job with this app. Fried zucchini was just ""ok,"" and was heavy on the breading. Chicken lettuce wraps were terrific... fresh, crisp, savory, and very flavorful. Entrees: Our table had 5 different burgers and a pasta dish. Burger standouts were the Mac and Cheese Burger (she ooooohed and ahhhhed while eating it,) the Mushroom Burger, and my house fave, the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. The others (Old Fashioned and The Factory) were simply, ""meh"" according to the two who ordered them. The one pasta eater said that her Bistro Shrimp Pasta was ""pretty good,"" but she would definitely order something different next time. Dessert: 6 different cheesecakes were ordered, and all 6 received glowing reviews!"
Maggie F.,"Lawton, OK",0,56,33,1.0,4/7/2017,"Group of 9 were seated. On Thursday April 6th.  We had a wonderful waiter who was very friendly and nice. He took our order no problem.  Chicken nachos, shrimp scampi, two kids spaghetti, and kids pizza and chicken teriyaki. Chicken nachos were on point, sooo very good. The shrimp scampi was tiny and had very little portion to it. (My brother was still hungry after he ate it all). The kids spaghetti were plentiful and had lots to share. The kids pizza was burnt and had to be sent back (was recooked and was fine the second time). The chicken teriyaki was a HUGE portion. Lots of food but was very good.  We ordered cheesecake (of course) Hershey's, Tiramisu, Hazelnut and callow carb with strawberries. We left happy.  Four hours later, about 1-2 am... 6 out of 9 of us got food poisoning. Our whole Friday was ruined as no one wanted to eat or do anything since being up late throwing up their ""lovely"" meals. Not sure what happened.. but Â eat are your own risk."
Rose L.,"Houston, TX",104,392,410,3.0,9/17/2017,"The food is a hit or miss but the service is always terrible. I like to come here because of the extensive menu. Over the course of time I've been here, I've had the steak Diane, pasta da Vinci, dynamite shrimp, southern fried chicken sliders, stuffed mushrooms, honey truffle chicken, meatloaf, pasta carbonara, fried calamari pasta with shrimp and sausage, farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic, bistro shrimp pasta, spinach cheese dip, nachos, miso salmon, mac and cheese burger, fried mac and cheese and the cheesecake were all ok, however having the name ""Cheesecake Factory, the cheese cake didn't wow me much. It was actually not good. I remember last time it being so good but this time it wasn't (oreo cheesecake). I also love the bread they bring you out first before your food(brown bread) yum! Food is decent price, not too expensive, but the service is horrible which gears me towards the no side of coming back. I've had to ask for silverware MULTIPLE times, ordered a couple steaks and no steak knives, no refill, didn't clean table up, had a table of 10 people and brought out only 6 loafs of bread. Really I'm just over it. Not to mention I came at 2pm and waited until 3 for a table and didn't get my food until 4:30 and spent overall 3 hrs here and it wasn't that packed. Yeah it was busy but it wasn't crazy so there's no excuse for a slow turtle waiter that seems to be hung over"
LeScotcia S.,"Houston, TX",326,85,707,2.0,8/31/2016,Where do I begin first.. This won't be a long winded review bc there isn't much to say except don't order the meatloaf and go to the sister location Grand Lux better choices for lunch dinner or brunch and the staff are exceptionally great*  There's one dish which is the firecracker salmon that consist of a portion size of 4 rolls for $12 so on that note I'll pass.. Service is mediocre and the prices are inflated for decent size portions of food but horrible flavor and consistency that hasn't changed over the course if years* If I had to say something good about this place it would be the lemonade.. I'm not a fan of Lemonade but it comes as a choice with My cub kids meal and it was dee-lish*
Mike C.,"Katy, TX",0,9,,4.0,10/17/2017,"I love coming over here during the week because it's not as full but the food is good and the place is really nice as well, their cocktails and obviously the cheesecake are really good too."
Austin F.,"Humble, TX",1,16,3,1.0,3/7/2017,"So I like Cheesecake Factory..usually..not this location though. We got Buffalo Blast, Tex Mex Egg rolls and Fries. It took about 10 minutes to finally get recognized that we haven't been served. Got our drinks about 10 minutes AFTER placing the drinks. Bread took another 5 minutes after our water. So 25 minutes in, we had bread and water. We placed our order and waited another 15 minutes and eventually got to eat. Food looked good, but looks can be deceiving. The Egg Rolls smelt rotten and tasted rotten, so we talked to the manager and he took care of it. I hate to say it, but I got a horrible vibe from the moment I walked in...maybe because I was white...sucks to say but the employees seemed to look and treat me differently unlike other tables.  If this location was the only food available, I'd rather starve then have to go back.. ONLY PLUS TO THIS LOCATION WAS THE MANAGER."
Eddie F.,"Miami Beach, FL",46,116,206,3.0,3/6/2017,"Good foods there actually it was much better than I thought. Ordered ribeye, filet and all that and I was not expecting much of steak cooking and quality but they were really good to perfection (ordered as medium rare...). It always come across to Front of the house service area. Unfortunately the server was not as good as food. No attention, became suddenly lot friendly once she found we ordered higher price items compared to her initial greeting (you know exactly what I mean).. thus sorry 3 stars but will be back for sure!"
Whitney A.,"Houston, TX",1,42,2,4.0,3/5/2017,"I know, I know Cheesecake Factory is a chain. But they still have the best and widest selection of cheesecake that I've experienced up to this point. And, their expansive dinner menu can accommodate almost anyone! Sorry foodies!  I've only been to this Cheesecake Factory four times. And can only clearly recall three, thanks alcohol! The first time I ordered and took it Togo: Hershey's chocolate cheesecake 4/5 The second time I ordered and ate on patio: App- Avocado egg rolls 4/5, absolute delish and would get again, but I wish they were crispier. Main 1- Filet mignon 4.5/5, how is it so good? Main 2- Chicken Madeira+Steak Dianne 3/5, Meh. Drinks- Passion tea 5/5, Long Island 3.5/5, Classic Mojito 4/5 Dessert- Classic with Strawberry cheesecake 4.8/5 Service- 3.5/5 The third time I ordered and ate on patio: App- Eggroll Sampler 4/5 Main 1- Kobe burger 4.7/5 OMG YUM Main 2- Honey Truffle Chicken 1.1/5, where is the truffle? Where is the sauce? This tastes like dry hospital food. I literally cannot believe I paid for this. Drinks- Passion tea 5/5, Long Island 2.5/5, too much coke; Pineapple mojito 3.5/5, good but a little too sweet for my taste. Dessert- Classic with Â cheesecake  Service- 4.5/5 Im surprised by some reviews, maybe the service is better on the patio?  All in all I will go back, and sit on the patio! I wish 3.5 was an option because the ""Honey Truffle"" Chicken is absolutely ridiculous. But I'll give a four because four of the dishes I tried were almost perfect."
Austin W.,"Tyler, TX",0,1,,2.0,8/19/2017,"They do not take reservations, and cannot handle large parties. DO NOT try and have get togethers here, only feasible for small groups/families. Food is great, but experience was lacking."
Joujou N.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,178,399,1.0,4/7/2017,"Noo, Noo, Nooo, & Noooo. The cheesecake was fine. I prefer Juniors but it was fine. What I don't understand is whyyyyy in the world it took 13 minutes for you to pack up my cheesecake, put it in a box , put it in a bag, and hand it to me?? Especially since I already paid for it.  No, instead I had to wait on the side while this man picked up the phone, took other customers, retrieved their items and handed it to them first, checked on other employees, went back to talk to other employees again, picked up the phone some more, took more customers and handed them their items, all the while I stood there waiting.  After 10 minutes had passed, I asked him how much longer it would be and his response: ""oh we just have to prepare it and add some cream to the top"" -HOLY GOOD GOD- seriously???? THIS WAS NOT WORTH 13 MINUTES OF MY TIME. Maybe this is how they roll down south? Either way, didn't appreciate him or his demeanor."
Christina C.,"Houston, TX",135,612,225,3.0,1/29/2017,"We were seated within 5 minutes when they told us it's a 30 minute wait which was awesome. Our waitress was really nice. I wish I remembered her name. The steak was really good. My dad's pizza came out burned and they gladly replaced it. We waited almost 30 minutes for our food to come out so waiting for a replacement pizza took even longer. We got complimentary chicken vegetable soup which was delicious since our pizza came out burned. My husband enjoyed his burger. Overall it was a decent experience. We love The Cheesecake Factory, so we will Â be back!"
Crystal D.,"Katy, TX",0,17,53,5.0,9/20/2017,Shaniqua* was so great and helpful in working with me to pick the right assortment of cheesecake for my mom's birthday! She took her time to explain all the flavors and her recommendations helped us so much. Lisa was great too! Awesome staff representing Cheesecake Factory!
C W.,"Houston, TX",53,6,1,1.0,9/19/2017,"On Sunday evening I went to this location to purchase a few slices of cheesecake, I was so displeased with the entry way, the sidewalk was very dirty and in need of power washing. I started to leave because as the saying goes ""First Impressions Are Lasting Impressions"", unfortunately for me, while waiting for my order, I noticed how dirty the doors were, the hostess, 3 to be exact were just standing around talking, there was trash on the floor a straw near the cheesecake display &'a piece of paper that was stuck to the floor with everyone walking past it, including the Manager on duty, Greg, who was very nonchalant when I spoke with him to make him aware of my observation, he just said ok and left it at that. I'm sure when I left things remained just as they were while I was there. You never get a second chance to make a first impression, not impressed at all!!"
Amrita S.,"Houston, TX",58,72,23,1.0,3/20/2017,"The worst experience ever! It started from the hostess who acted like it was a burden to seat us outside.. very very rude. Throughout our dinner we never had one consistent waiter.. a different person took our drink order a different person took our food order and a different people were bringing out our food. So confusing! Our food took 40 minutes to come out.. and that was just the first plate! They brought out each plate separately and not in the same time frame! We were all done eating ( party if 6) and my husband's food still didn't come! He had to eat my left overs and just take his to go.  A lady came over, I'm assuming the manger to drop off one off one of the dishes. We told her how bad the service was, she didn't even seem apologetic. Ridiculous!!! The only thing they did was comp my husbands meal. I definitely will not be back!!!"
Fiffylicious L.,"Katy, TX",10,42,6,1.0,7/28/2017,This place is a joke. How do you make people wait for over an hour for food to be delivered to the table. The drinks were brought one at a time for a party of four. There was a couple next to us that were sat maybe 30 mins after us and yet got their food waaaaaaaay before we did. Waitress would disappear for a long time before checking up on us. Oh yea... And this place is hot like the devil's armpit!!! You would be better of to go the California pizza kitchen next door. Pathetic!!!
Amanda G.,"Round Rock, TX",54,52,16,1.0,11/10/2017,"This place sucks. We didn't have a long wait (which is literally the only positive aspect of our entire evening) to get our table, but had horrid service once we got seated. Our server never introduced herself and never really paid attention to what we were saying either. According to the receipt her name is Taylor W. Our coffee came out cold and we were never offered a sugar caddy. We never got the bread basket we asked for either. We were never offered refills either. Two of our three plates came out, and the third never came out. We tried diligently to get the attention of any server, but to no avail. Our server casually passed by and said you got your food right. There was no plate there, so the answer should have been obvious. Then she brought it out like 10 minutes AFTER that but without the sides. How ridiculous is that?! My mom had had enough at this point and requested a manager. We told him what happened and he halfway apologized. He got the spinach several minutes AFTER the delayed food and then about 10 or so minutes brought us fresh coffee and sugar. He finally brought the bread basket after that. Who wants bread after the meal? We asked for the DM's info, and he finally got it after we insisted numerous times. We were never offered dessert of any kind and we were rushed after this incident. He did deduct the late meal and the atrocious excuse of coffee, but that doesn't make up for such a lack of service. This place needs to be completely overhauled with new management and a new serving team. Instead of excuses, offer sincere apologies. There is never a need for an excuse because there is no excuse for bad service. Good luck to whoever stops at this location. Go a little farther to the Galleria and you'll get way better service."
Jasmine B.,"Houston, TX",128,6,,1.0,7/29/2017,Horrible service! My food was brought to me wrong twice in a row. The waitress tried to bring me my meal a third time and of course I declined and just asked that it be taken off my check at that point. No manager came over to apologize or anything. Never will I patronize this particular location again. The ladies at the bar were amazing and they deserve recognition!
Tarsha B.,"Houston, TX",53,68,104,4.0,11/4/2015,"Dinner out on a school night! Â I only come here during the week days, excluding Fridays as it gets really crowded and waits can last up to an hour. I have dinner with a former co-worker a few times a year and this is her favorite place. Â Vast menu options, really great waitress (forgot her name, but she was super sweet) and really good food for a casual dining spot. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi with angel hair pasta and cheesecake to go. Our meal was served hot and tasted really good."
