Long P.,"Westside, Houston, TX",0,23,2,4.0,8/11/2017,It is a good place to dine with family . Friendly atmosphere. Good pasta . Fast order on working days .
Emily J.,"Houston, TX",49,28,57,4.0,6/9/2017,"I give this place 4 stars mainly because of the service. My steak was over cook BUT our server was really nice and attentive. My friend sent her salad back as well. Only because she didn't like the salad dressing they put on it ( she asked for ranch, and the server even noted it as well.) My over all experience was pretty good."
Geri K.,"Houston, TX",277,74,18,5.0,1/15/2017,We came here to celebrate our son's 20th birthday. This is our second visit and both the food and the service is amazing. Love this place. Get here early or you will be waiting a long time for a table.
Shelene L.,"Houston, TX",39,256,358,4.0,7/16/2015,"Lunchtime, happy hour or for dinner, this place is a winner.  I visited for lunch at about 12:15 and was delightful surprised that we were immediately seated. The restaurant was quite busy but the atmosphere was rather relaxed.  Our waiter-in-training was very cordial and provided good service. He kept our drinks refilled without us asking which is always a plus for me.  The bathroom was immaculate!  Although I didn't see an attendant, it was clear that management has assigned someone to maintain them.  The menu is big and portions are hearty!  My eyes popped when my food arrived. I opted for chicken sliders with a side of sweet potato fries. It was $9.95 plus $1.00 for the fries which in itself is a good deal. But those same sliders are only $5 at the bar during happy hour.  My meal was topped off with a slice of Dulce de ale he cheesecake. Can you say divine?"
Bern A.,"Houston, TX",119,121,62,3.0,12/8/2016,"If I just rate the cheesecake, this place would get a full 5 stars. Those things are so delicious they are deadly. However, I rated them average (3 stars) because well, the service was average. Our waitress disappeared and for awhile we were left alone. No refills, no condiments. We had to ask a different waiter walking by for help! Now I've been to Cheesecake Factory in the past, and the service we get is usually really good, but for some reason this place failed at executing. Possibly an off day? I don't know, but luckily we can get the cheesecakes to go ;)"
Brittney F.,"Sealy, TX",17,130,150,3.0,12/11/2016,This Cheesecake Factory is located in Memorial City mall which is huge and has an ice skating rink inside. I ordered a California cheesesteak and it wasn't anything to write home about. It was mostly chewy and fatty. I couldn't finish it. I would never order it again. Our drinks were constantly refilled but barely ever any ice in them. I'm docking two stars due to the no ice and the crappiness of my meal. Oh well! It happens! We would certainly come back.
Tony O.,"TX, TX",8,2,,1.0,7/28/2017,Went out for date night . What happen to this place. Even the manager doesn't care . Everyone around got food and desert and then my food appears.  Wtf .  My food was wrong and over done said they would make a new one....brought back out my same dish..really!!!! My wife's plate was so hot she burned her hand! Manager is Julie Greer did offer anything for all the problems...close the door!!!!!!!
Jae S.,"Houston, TX",131,254,575,1.0,3/5/2016,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! I went to dinner with my friend. My friend has an visual disability. She can't see well in the dark. So she uses a white cane. We waited 25 minutes for a table. The host lady who seated us to the table treated my friend like she didn't exist. I saw the lady have 2 menus in her hand when we walked to our seat. The host didn't give her a menu for my friend. I asked ""Why does she not get a menu?"" She gave us a look. Like she didn't understand what I was asking. I asked again. She just stared. She was probably assuming my friend was fully blind and she didn't need it. Sigh. This was just wrong. I know that ADA laws don't regulate rudeness or insensitivity of workers. But they should at least train their employees how to deal with disabled individuals. We were so offended! We have never experienced this from any other restaurants before."
Eric O.,"Houston, TX",220,15,4,5.0,1/9/2017,"Dianei D is a prestigious example of what restaurant bar/wait staff should be. From the introduction, to food/drink choices. She meet my fiancé and I with a happy smile and positive attitude. I could definitely go on and explain the great things, but I'll leave it to everyone to go in and request her and experience it yourself. She accommodated our needs to a perfection. To top it off she made my fiancé' birthday amazing.  Please if management reads and follows this. She needs to be recognized for her outstanding service."
Sammie H.,"Houston, TX",4,20,60,4.0,6/24/2016,"I would give this location a 5 star review, however the service wasn't as amazing as it could be.  I will always love Cheesecake Factory for their abundance of options, portions, and the aesthetics of the food. The food is never disappointing. The atmosphere is incredible, I always go with my home girls outside when the weather is nice and dine like there's no tomorrow.  The problem I'm having with this location is an inconsistency of quality service.  We were not attended to periodically and almost felt as if we had to call a waiter every single time instead of being assisted every 15-or-so minutes.  We didn't get bread, refills, or menus without having to ask. It wasn't much of a hassle, but more of an inconvenience.  This, however, will not stop me from dining at this location since it is closer to where I live, and I enjoy eating here after I shop with some friends."
Milan M.,"San Francisco, CA",18,1,,1.0,9/30/2017,"We went here this Sunday for a lunch, we were really excited to have some good lunch and nice cheesecake, but unfortunately  it was the worst experience. We were seated at the table outside by the host, and at first no body was showing up for 10 minutes which is fine because we had time to check menus and make decision. Then one guy showed up all surprised that we are waiting for that long and asked what we would like to drink, we just ordered water and club soda with lemons. That came out after 15 more minutes from the  different waiter who just put it on the table and left witout giving us any chance to make some order. After few minutes first waiter passed by and told us that ""he will be right there"" which never happened, after 10 more minutes we just  left. The restaurant was not even that  busy. This was the worst service and attitude I have seen in my life and I  would definitely suggest to everyone to stay away from this place because it is not really worth of anything."
Grace K.,"Knoxville, TN",262,255,1084,3.0,2/9/2016,"I've dined at Cheesecake Factory numerous times. There are no reservations available, for it is walk in only.  Huge restaurant with multiple chains around. There is a full bar present located within, different at each location. Despite the number of people, it doesn't feel like you're sitting in a room with strangers. You have your privacy due to the spacing. Servers first come to ask for your drinks and bring a batch of complimentary white and brown bread. I always ask for brown only because I prefer it than the white, trust me. The brown bread slightly has a sweet taste to it. You can ask for refills.  FOOD: Menu is broad and fantastic. There is something for everyone. On a diet? Try the skinnylicious menu. Small plates? Appetizer? Pasta? Burgers? Steak? Vegetarian? Literally great menu and variety.  Skinnylicious Salmon Rolls (4/5): Is this really part of the Skinnylicious menu? The 4 rolls were oily but tasted delicious.  Fried Macaroni and Cheese (4/5): My family goes nuts about this. I'm not a big fan as they are, but we order this every time. There are 4 pieces filled with a bunch of macaroni in cheese balls. Marinara sauce is included. Think of mac + cheese sticks if you need an idea of what it would taste like. Southwest Chicken Sandwich (3/5): I wasn't a big fan of this. Flavors were there but I wouldn't order this again. This reminded me of the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta due to the flavor. Bread was just a little too hard for me. Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp (4/5): This was the first plate I ever tried at a Cheesecake Factory. Definitely a recommendation if you're not sure what to eat. I even tried to make a replica of it at home, Google does wonders. This is a Thai-based entree which is not spicy at all. Great flavor though especially with the peanut sauce! Chicken Piccata (4/5): I love pasta with lemon, and I always seem to order this lunch portioned dish. The reason why I knock off a star is the oil. Too much oil. Pasta may seem bland, but I think the amount of flavor is ideal. Everything balances out when you eat it all together. Also, it is light on the stomach for the most part.  Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (5/5): Literally, best thing ever. My family always orders this when I'm here. If you have not tried it, order it. I would recommend the dinner portion for your lunch the next day. It isn't spicy what so ever, and the flavor is damn good. This is a penne pasta with chicken breast strips with cream based sauce.  A star is deducted due to the service. Service is always unpredictable here depending on when you come and if the server is new. My biggest thing is when my water is already rock bottom, and I have to remind the waiter two times before it is refilled. Fill my drinks and you'll make me (and everyone) happy.  Overall, great restaurant to dine at whether it be business, family, or friends. Although it may get a little loud, amount of food and price together are reasonable."
Brandon C.,"Houston, TX",0,9,1,2.0,7/15/2017,First time here. Not impressed. Food is subpar. Service is under average. I ordered my slice of cheesecake over 20 mins ago. Still waiting....
Julie B.,"Cypress, TX",0,5,,5.0,4/7/2017,Someone in management needs to commend Sandra.  That woman just served us when we weren't even in her section because we were sitting there being ignored.  Tipped her 50% for her extra effort. It's not the first time we've had her and last time she was just as amazing. A gem for sure!
LaToya T.,"Houston, TX",5,64,23,1.0,11/10/2016,Where do I start? The service at CCF has gone downhill  rapidly.  Parking was great today. We were greeted immediately and seated pretty quickly. However once we were seated it took the waiter 10 mins to acknowledge us  (almost making us miss happy hour) and he started serving the guest who were seated AFTER us?!?!?!  Food: We were notified our appetizer (chicken sliders) were made wrong so they were sent back and took forever to come out. When they did come back out they were missing condiments so I had to flag down our waiter....by the time the condiments came the sliders were cold. My husband's pasta was missing in action and the waiter had to check on this. By now everyone else was finished with their meal and ready to go.  I understand being short staffed but this is unacceptable CCF. I contacted CCF and still no follow up. We will not be returning
John C.,"Houston, TX",1,17,,1.0,7/6/2017,"I didn't listen to my conscience.  It told me not to do it.  ""Don't eat there.  Just walk away.""  I didn't listen.  I wish I had.   Service was okay - it wasn't a train wreck, but it wasn't stellar.   Food?  Horrible.  Nothing was good.  My not-very-picky 4-year-old wouldn't even eat much of what we offered him off of our plates.  I had (only two bites of) the angel hair pasta with grilled shrimp.  My wife ordered something that was equally unappealing.   On the positive side, this would be a great place to go if you're on a diet.  You get grossed out by the ""food"" they bring you and you lose your appetite!"
Gina R.,"Houston, TX",1,46,,1.0,9/17/2017,"I usually just run into this place to get a slice and back out and that takes forever. Today we went for my niece's bday celebration and it was terrible. Once we got seated, we waited at least 15 mins before I finally had to get up and ask a waitress if she could find out who our server was,she said she would get our drink orders and then find our server. We got our drinks from her and they forgot my husband's tea. I then after waiting another 20 minutes had to get up to ask for bread. Then after bread came it was another 10 minutes before we gave our food order. When the food came, my salad was wrong, my brother's gf order was totally wrong and when they put it down in front of her they said the right thing but it was a completely different plate. It was over an hour and a half before we got our food. Of course the only time they were on point, is when it was time to pay and our pymt was taken by a mgr. our waitress tried her best but she was working 2 different sections at the same time. I won't be returning."
Sabrina R.,"Houston, TX",205,74,88,1.0,9/5/2016,"If I could give zero, I would. It took 2 hours for a happy hour burger. They were out of the gluten free bun I ordered, and the manager approached my table in a manner that implied it was our fault - saying hey, we run out of things and left it at that. Our orders finally came out- wrong- completely - our fries were not sweet potato or brought out with our burgers. Our to go cheesecake we ordered, came out on a plate, and I think it is HIGHLY unacceptable that the kitchen staff sits out front wearing a Cheescake Cake factory shirt and smokes. Not a fan of anything about this experience."
Amanda T.,"Missouri City, TX",1,33,22,2.0,5/15/2017,"We got here at 11:30, party of four. Still have not received our Nachos as an appetizer and it's now 12:15. We asked our waiter and he said the salad area is slammed right now. Clearly we are on our lunch break and we understand this is not the waiters fault, unless he forgot to put the order in-house we did see him walk back to the computer, so not sure if he forgot to add it to the order. Received no apology other than ""I'm not sure what's taking so, long-can I go ahead and bring your lunch out?"" We cancelled the order for nachos after that. Received our ""lunch"" at 12:20. Spent 2 hours on lunch."
Stephen H.,"Houston, TX",58,2,,2.0,6/19/2017,"My girlfriend and I ate here on June 19th. We were greeted by a very rude hostess.  The table the hostess sat us at was dirty and the silverware and plates were also dirty.  It took the waiter almost ten minutes to even acknowledge​ us sitting at his table. We ordered our drinks and food.  I ordered the lunch pizza and house salad, and my girlfriend are a sandwich and soup of the day.  She was told the soup was French onion.  What came out was definitely not French onion.  They brought me out a Cesar salad.  I told them I had asked for a house salad with dressing on the side. Does Caesar Salad did not have dressing on it. When they finally brought out my house salad they put the dressing on top of it and brought me out sides of the wrong dressing. We ate our lunch and decided not even to have a cheesecake because we were just ready to leave the Cheesecake Factory."
