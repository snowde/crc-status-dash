Anna U.,"Silver Spring, MD",12,12,3,5.0,5/5/2017,"The Hibachi steak tastes amazing and the cheesecake..... too good for words. Amazing place for a romantic date night, or just a casual brunch. Located at a great place too!!"
Kacy M.,"Houston, TX",191,262,466,4.0,3/30/2016,"I normally come here for lunch since it's cheaper but saw a movie and came for drinks and dinner this time around. I split the shrimp and chicken pasta with a friend and had a mai tai (they ran out of red wine for the sangria I wanted originally). Our server was very nice but came around too often for my comfort. It's not necessary to hover, I'll tip you no matter what. The food was great and the atmosphere was nice, though a little too dark in my opinion. We had a couple sitting to our left and a family celebrating a birthday on our right. What I don't understand is that they give you a free ice cream for your birthday but not cheesecake. What a disappointment. The bread is unlimited which I like since they have amazing bread."
Riley M.,"Houston, TX",176,1,,2.0,6/10/2017,"Food was pretty good, but some guy tried to break into my finances car. Not impressed."
Jorge A.,"Houston, TX",415,148,50,2.0,1/16/2017,"Me and a big group of my family came here this last weekend, and my mom had tried to call ahead to try and make a reservation for 20 since we were going to be  surprising my grandma for her birthday, when she was told they don't take reservations. Already a little odd to me, but okay, I guess. Anyway, the whole party was there at 1, and we didn't get seating until about 1:45, but to be fair it was Sunday right around lunch time. When we were seated, we were given the outside seating, and had the tables pretty much set up as if many different parties were going to be using the area, not just our family, so we waited and stood around looking confused for a while until we decide to start moving tables together ourselves, when the person who turned out to be our waiter eventually came out to help. The waiter was overall nice, but nothing stellar as far as service, and getting any drink orders took forever, and the food took even longer. As far as taste, I enjoyed my plate as did most everyone else, but the wait for everything just took so long. I know it's a large group, but I figured with a birthday being hosted there, we would have had more attentive service and it would have been faster in general."
Melany B.,"Katy, TX",0,16,,2.0,9/25/2017,"Came on Sunday at 5.  Went to restroom, all stalls without toilet paper ! At prime dinner time!! Waited for awhile for server to come take our order. She took the order and 20 mins later came back to tell us that they couldn't make the 2 specials we ordered, ""chicken parm pizza style"". How can you not be able to make the special ?? And why did it take you 20 mins to advise us of that?  Meanwhile, my teenagers meal was apparently put in when we first ordered , his meal came out before we even were able to ORDER  our replacement food. Was asked what we wanted to eat ( no menu given!!) and were told "" I can make some suggestions for you"". Nope, I need a menu to decide      duh! One of her suggestions was parmesan herb crusted chicken. My husband went with that.  When we were in mid sentence of ordering, she literally walked away to deal with the table behind us ( they had been complaining all evening about service and had to get someone else to come wait on them) !!! No excuse me, no hold a moment, just walked away.... Finally came back to get our order, meanwhile son was done eating !! Food was good, but not what I wanted. Came here to celebrate my birthday and get what looked and sounded like something amazing , only to be disappointed that I couldn't have it. Finished meal and asked for cheesecake to go. By this time I was done with the place..... Received check, told cheesecake was bagged up and she was grabbing it from the counter, 30 mins later and 2 stops back at table with the same excuse"" Oh I forgot your bag I will be right back with it "" !!! When she finally brought the cheesecake she asked my husband how he liked his meal and if it was ""stuffed"" with anything or if it was just chicken and asked if it was good.... ummmmm you recommended something you didn't even know how it is made and never had??? Yeah glad I asked for a menu and didn't go with your ""suggestion"". Have always loved TCF , but this just ruined a birthday celebration and not sure I would ever pick it for a special occasion again :-( ."
Sametra B.,"Houston, TX",32,11,1,4.0,6/6/2017,"It's pretty much what you'd expect from a chain restaurant. Nothing fantastic, but my four starts are mainly for the amazing cheesecake varieties. So delicious!!!"
Patrick N.,"Katy, TX",0,4,,1.0,6/4/2017,"DO NOT EAT HERE! I am simply appalled by the behavior of ROB COWLE, the manager of this restaurant. Besides misinforming my group about the amount of time we would have to wait for a table, he was extremely disrespectful, passive aggressive, gratuitous, and rude. We have all seen staff at restaurants who do not know how to act professionally, especially in chain restaurants with weak customer service regulations, however, for a SENIOR MANAGER to act the way he did was gobsmacking and unexpected. Managers should act as an example for their staff and treat customers with politesse and respect, especially in this situation where we tried to be cordial with him. His behavior was so shocking we had to make a formal complaint with the company. I advise everyone to avoid this this place if you have the opportunity to visit a more decent restaurant."
Jordan W.,"Waxhaw, NC",0,9,1,2.0,9/17/2017,"Well where to start? While our waiter as very attentive and speedy, the quality of the food was dismal. I can't justify paying $75 for subpar food that even microwaved meals could easily surpass. So in essence we paid $75 for food that was barely edible. I would give one star except for the fact that our server went above and beyond. Clean up your act. Stop having parties on the patio with sketchy characters. Sweep the floors. Dust the windows. Stop getting hair in the food (yes we found hair in our food.) Definitely not returning!!"
Shayla N.,"Chinatown, Houston, TX",148,21,22,2.0,1/15/2017,"I've been to cheesecake many time for years. Today, my pregnant self, husband and along 3 kids and my sister waited literally over 30 mins to be seated. Fine, I get it. It happens sometime. But honestly today was one of my worst experience due to the hostess KATHERINE. Not only was she rude,super unfriendly and not once have I seen her smile at all to anyone that walked thru the door. I wish I had took a picture of her how unhappy she looks! She had that face like ""I hate my job and I hate people kinda face on""  I requested to be seated outside since the patio is open. And her respond was very unprofessional... she says there wasn't any server outside but clearly there was two servers serving outside. I was disappointed because my family and I really wanted to sit outside and enjoy the day. She could have responded back in a friendly manners I would have understand. But what I don't understand is why is there people sitting outside if there is no server serving outside. At this point, I was hungry and tired of waiting and didn't want to make a big deal for not able to be seated outside. Looking back now I seriously wish I could had talk to a manager and point out about Katherine attitude and how unhappy and not so friendly customer services she is. For further better services please approach with a better happy smile manners Katherine."
Trang H.,"Houston, TX",0,4,8,1.0,5/14/2017,"Told us 40 min wait.  1 hr 30 min later, I asked & she said 10 more min. Seriously?!  Do they assume we have all freaking day to wait.  I got patient & try to be understanding but the time u tell me got to be somewhat relevant."
Kevin T.,"Houston, TX",0,35,21,3.0,3/20/2017,"There is usually a wait at this very popular family style restaurant alongside memorial city mall. The menu is extensive and most dishes we've tried have been excellent. However the service can be really hit or miss. They seem to struggle when it gets busy. It can take over 30 - 40 minutes for food to arrive, then the orders don't always arrive in same time frame and some of the dishes were not hot enough. On a positive note everybody loved the cheesecake desert."
Ed S.,"Houston, TX",57,185,110,5.0,3/11/2015,"My wife and I celebrated our 13th Anniversary at Cheesecake Factory.  We simply couldn't have had a  more enjoyable evening.  We were seated promptly and our server, Peter greeted us warmly. He took our drink order and reviewed some recommendations for dinner.  We split the vegetable salad with a pomegranate vinaigrette.   The salad was so large, we thought they had brought us two salads.  Our meals were perfectly timed and served after we finished our salads.  For dinner, my wife ordered a CF Combo of Steak Dianne and Shrimp Scampi   I ordered Hibachi Steak with wasabi mashed potatoes & asparagus tempura.   The meals were simply perfect.  Steaks cooked to perfection-nice sized garlic shrimp.  Not too heavy and subtle garlic.   Here's where the service became exceptional.  The server delivered the wrong combo to our table.   When we pointed it out, apologies flowed and they immediately started to prepare a new meal for my wife. Then, they offered to take my plate to keep it warm and serve with my wife's dinner.  They ended up remaking both of our dinners and again served them piping hot and perfectly prepared.   While we waited (briefly) for our remade dinner, the server Peter, his assistant Yousef and the manager all came by to apologize again.   Dessert was complimentary.  We chose the turtle caramel cheesecake. Decadent.  The evening was perfect.  We simply couldn't have asked for more.  Kudos to The Memorial Cheesecake Factory.  5 Stars."
Anastacia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,132,10,1.0,3/16/2017,"30 minute wait to get a table, 20 mins to get water, another 5 to get bread after water, 20 to get food. We got there at 8:30 and didn't get our food until 9:40pm on a weeknight.  Don't waste your time. Go somewhere else.  And woman at front desk seemed like she was forced to stand there. Frowned face when people walked in."
Vanessa T.,"Houston, TX",0,9,19,4.0,11/6/2016,"The lemon Ricotta pancakes are to die for. You can definitely taste the lemon but not too over powering., they are light & fluffy."
Johanna V.,"Katy, TX",0,1,,1.0,9/15/2017,Horrible experience with the staff. We came for my daughter's birthday. The hostess stated it's an 1hr 1/2 wait which we understood. After an hour our buzzard rang and it was by mistake. Mind you we had 3 little children. The staff did not try to help. I try to talk to the manager and he did not want to hear my concern. This was already pass 9pm. We arrived around 7:30pm (more or less). Needless to say we will not return.
Kristy S.,"Houston, TX",113,33,42,4.0,7/21/2016,"Love this place for happy hour. Lots of food options for $6 or less and great drink specials. The bartenders at this location are very attentive. Get the Buffalo Blasts, Tex Mex eggrolls and Factory Nachos and you will be a happy camper."
Thomas Y.,"Houston, TX",60,81,3,4.0,4/29/2017,First time at the Cheesecake Factory the other day and my experience was alright... 2 drinks and 2 cheesecake for 30 bucks was hella expensive plus tips...cheesecake was good not gonna lie but it was alil to sweet. The down part was that the food there are hella expensive but they all sounded amazing got to go back one day to try it even though it's pricey...and I'll update my 2nd experience when I get the chance to go back...the service didn't impress me at all everything was slow for just 2 cheesecake and 2 drinks...overall my experience for a first time was alright... would I recommend it...idk but if y'all are up for first time experience then go for it!
Margaret B.,"Spokane, WA",21,2,,1.0,8/13/2017,Two people from our party ended up with food poisoning last night after having a dish with shrimp. Won't be back.
Sarah H.,"Houston, TX",406,95,169,4.0,6/14/2016,"The Cheesecake Factory is always a win for me! They have A TON of menu options, a light menu (Thank goodness), amazing cheesecake, and overall good food! This particular location is always packed! If you're okay with sitting at the bar or a high top table, DO IT!! It's full service, and you won't have to wait 20+ minutes just to sit at a regular table. General Cheesecake Factory Tips: 1. When they bring out the bread, make sure you get the brown bread... delicious! 2. Come ready to eat! The portions are HUGE, so either come ready to eat, or be prepared to get a to-go box! 3. The amount of food options is OVERWHELMING. Some might find this to be a negative, I don't particularly care.. it is what it is.  4. If you're watching your figure... don't even bother ordering from the regular menu. Go straight to Skinnylicious. 5. Try the cheesecake at least once! Cheesecake is in their title! You have to try at least once! I didn't think I liked cheesecake, but this place proved me wrong! My last visit, we specifically went just for cheesecake, and sat at the hightop instead of waiting for a table. Thanks to that, we had no wait, we were quickly served, and enjoyed our cheesecake! I ordered the Salted Caramel, and my boyfriend ordered the Caramel Pecan Turtle Cheesecake. I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE SALTED CARAMEL CHEESECAKE! By far the best cheesecake I've had there. The blondie brownie on the bottom was what convinced me, but overall this is just WONDERFUL!!! Definitely a must try for anyone who likes Salted Caramel!"
Sarah V.,"Dendermonde, Belgium",14,139,355,1.0,2/28/2016,"Located near the Memorial City Mall ; parking spots enough. Normally we avoid The Cheesecake Factory (not happy at all with their food) but we decided to give it a chance (better than going to the foodcourt). We ordered an Asian Pear Martini (11.25 dollar) and a Strawberry Martini (11.25 dollar). Drinks were fine but too small for this price ! I decided to go for the Lunch Cheese pizza with a caesar salad (13.95 dollar) and my husband had the pasta carbonara with chicken (16.50 dollar). The pizza : nothing special at all. I can make it better at home. My husband asked for a lunch dish (which is smaller) but he good the normal one... taste : just OK. We ended with a café latte (4.50 dollar) and an original piece of cheesecake (6.95 dollar). I'm sure that once the cheesecakes were very good there, but now... sorry.... that can be much better ! We paid 70 dollar (excl tip) which is too much for the quality of food."
