Don S.,"Chattanooga, TN",86,277,209,5.0,12/17/2017,I live in Chattanooga where we don't have a Cheesecake Factory so its always special for me to eat there. I can't believe how big the menu is. They literally have more entrees than just about anywhere else and based on my visit everything is good. Then comes the desert. The list of deserts is amazing as is the quality of them. Service was great and we were seated quickly. It doesn't get much better than this for the price paid.
MrIndy6984 ..,"Memphis, TN",1,5,7,1.0,1/3/2018,"My initial review was removed, and I was informed:  ""I'm reaching out to let you know that our moderators removed your review of The Cheesecake Factory because it wasn't clear that your review described your firsthand experience as a customer of The Cheesecake Factory.""  There were also pictures removed, as they came from local media, not me. I understand that and will refrain from using those.  Since they want my first hand account, here it is: Location, Location, Location On December 26, 2017, my family and I went to eat at The Cheesecake Factory in Memphis, TN to celebrate my youngest daughter's fifth birthday. It was an experience that will not soon be forgotten. The service was good and the food was wonderful. However, while waiting to order dessert, I observed a fight through the windows. Multiple individuals were fighting inside of the mall, just outside of The Cheesecake Factory. Security showed up and began forcing those involved outside. As they exited the mall (just feet from The Cheesecake Factory), approximately 8 gun shots rang out. I immediately grabbed my family and we got under the table, as did the entire restaurant. Realizing my oldest daughter (10) was in the restroom, I made my way through turned over chairs and other patrons on the floor to get to her. Once the scene appeared to be clear, I brought my daughter out of the restroom and back to the table. We continued sitting there, as multiple police cars arrived outside. I then observed police officers walking around the entrance and inside of the mall, with AR15 rifles. Just when we thought everything was under control, the officers with the riffles began running back toward the entrance where the shooting occurred. People in The Cheesecake Factory once again began screaming and got under their tables. After another few minutes of uncertainty, people began emerging from their hiding spots. Moments later, a female was taken out of the mall on a stretcher, by paramedics. We waited until it seemed as if everything had calmed down, and we paid our bill. On our way out, we observed an individual who had been shot. He was sitting handcuffed on the sidewalk surrounded by police, and was receiving medical attention.  Can I put the blame on The Cheesecake Factory? Yes, they knew the area has been declining and still chose it for their location. There are safer areas nearby that could have benefited from this business.  Additionally, it The Cheesecake Factory has any plan for an active shooter situation, it was not acted upon. The shooting happened just outside of the windows behind the cheesecake viewing area, yet the restaurant never went on lock down mode. Instead, customers were left to fend for themselves and seek their own hiding places. Also, the doors were never locked; therefore, the shooters could have easily entered the business.  As stated before, this was my five year old daughter's birthday dinner, in which she and her other sisters (6 & 10) were forced to hide under tables and brought to tears. She later woke up with nightmares, asking if there were any ""bad men"" outside. This is an experience that my family will never forget. Due to the location, I will not go back; however, I will continue to eat at The Cheesecake Factory when visiting other cities."
Natalie C.,"East Memphis, Memphis, TN",395,15,3,5.0,12/3/2017,"I came here with my work (Painting with a Twist) for our holiday dinner party and it was fantastic!!! I had never been before and the ambience made it feel like you weren't even in the mall. The service was great and friendly, all of our appetizers were delicious, and they had a good selection of Sauvignon Blanc (which not all restaurants have anymore).  I ordered the shrimp angel hair pasta without marinara sauce and they could have easily left it dry and tasteless but it was tossed in garlic, butter, and some heavenly spices. I will for sure be back!!"
Washington E.,"Walls, MS",264,2,3,5.0,12/23/2017,"Excellent everytime Almond crusted salmon salad, Avocado eggrolls,and cheesecake is too die for 4!!!"
Corinthian N.,"Honolulu, HI",2,32,2,3.0,1/3/2018,"This Cheesecake Factory is a slight downgrade from other locations I've visited around the world. The food is sometimes hit or miss. I ordered a Bistro Shrimp pasta, and they gave me NO shrimp. Fortunately, I called, and the manager mailed me a 20$ gift card. He seemed not to believe me for some reason, which was also upsetting. On another occasion, there was a shooting in the mall (this location is inside the Wolfchase Galleria Mall), and we were just about to head there to give them another chance with our children! I can't imagine being caught in a shooting with my children! I think I'll pass on this location."
Patricia J.,"Frisco, TX",556,418,5964,4.0,8/12/2017,Very nice restaurant (very similar to the rest of the chain). The service was great and the food was delicious as always.
Renee P.,"Sacramento, CA",2,11,5,3.0,12/30/2017,"Food was good, not great. I had a standard burger which came charred on the outside and with fries that were on the salty side. The atmosphere was good if not for a few coughing and sneezing toddlers at the table next to us which caused us concern.  So we decided to leave sooner than we normally would have. That said, getting our server to return expeditiously to our table with our meal, with dessert, and with the check, was a chore. My first visit to a Cheesecake Factory in years and most likely my last. A mall visit and gift card got us here this time."
Natasha M.,"Cordova, TN",175,69,91,5.0,8/5/2017,"Who would've thought that you could walk right into a Cheesecake Factory late on a Friday night and get service immediately? That's how it goes when you sit at the bar and then move out to the empty patio. That's how my #datenight went. We received good service and drinks at the bar. But, we took our party outside to sit more comfortably & intimately. My pasta dish was very tasty. The chicken was tender and not chewy and I received just the fuel I need for my long run the next morning. We also received good information regarding the month's featured cheesecakes and pricing. I look forward to returning for more!"
Beatrice H.,"Memphis, TN",0,19,,1.0,1/5/2018,"This location is DANGEROUS! With that said, my 1 star rating because of safety, not the food or service! My husband and I patronized this location in November for my birthday. It was extremely loud and dark inside this establishment. Perfect environment for some shenanigans to go down. As we were seated, we saw a group of THUGS! Yes, THUGS! Wearing all red, mostly Chicago bulls gear. If you don't know what this thuggery means just look it up. They were loud, cussing and causing some kind of scene with the manager. I could not eat my salad fast enough so we could leave. I felt very uncomfortable! My husband is a law enforcement officer so he is always armed. That gave me comfort knowing he is trained to eliminate such threats if the need arises  I was thankful we did not have our child with us. I could not enjoy my birthday dinner because of the atmosphere. I got my cheesecake to go and ate it in our hotel.  It's very sad to see such great restaurants come to such great cities like memphis and these thugs running them in the ground. I would like to see Cheesecake Factory hire off duty police officers as security! I am sure after recent incidents, the security would be welcomed and would help business. I'd hate to see Memphis loose a great place to eat because of unnecessary thuggery!  P.S the Godiva cheese cake is amazing! I bet it would have been even better eating it in the restaurant, in peace."
Loan L.,"Memphis, TN",162,187,90,3.0,6/23/2017,"(Don't mind me, I'm just cleaning out my drafts.) When I found out Memphis was getting a Cheesecake Factory, I was so overwhelmed and overjoyed that I even thought about applying to work here! The fact that it's located in one of the malls I frequently visit also is a huge bonus. Alas, with everything that comes to Memphis, most times, I am let down.  Let's start with the service: it's slow, staff is almost always inattentive, and I'm always missing stuff. The food is the same as other Cheesecake Factories, which is great. I normally order to-go, if I ever decide to come here, which is rare ever since its opening, but even that takes forever."
Donna M.,"Eads, TN",219,693,8364,4.0,7/2/2017,"Ambiance   Service   Food I was greeted & seated as soon as I entered.   Typhoon Punch ($10.50) ~ Absolute Raspberry Vodka with Passion Fruit, Orange, & Pineapple Juices was delicious.   Almost every menu item looks good to me.  A selection to please everyone.   Though the restaurant was about 3/4 full, my Lunch was served in 10 minutes.   I enjoyed a Green Salad with House Vinaigrette & bowl of Chicken Corn Chowder ($8.95).  Server checked on me twice.   Decor & Ambiance are top notch.  & That cooler full of cakes near the Entrance is soooo tempting!"
Samantha H.,"Memphis, TN",210,354,857,5.0,8/30/2017,The cheesecake factory  It's deliciousness is overwhelming. This place is devine I will eat here often. The dishes are wonderfully made. The drinks are on point. I give it five stars total.
Felicia L.,"Memphis, TN",274,96,254,4.0,10/1/2017,The Salads Are Absolutely the best...The Service was Great for a busy Saturday night... The Waitress was Awesome. She was very knowledgeable of the menu items and the tea recommendations was tasty... The Cheesecake was Phenomenal as Always
Jorge M.,"Miami, FL",35,20,40,5.0,9/12/2017,"As always this place rocks!  Awesome food drinks that taste like a drink, and the dessert, oh those decadent slices of heaven.The crispy chicken costoletta was perfectly done, soft chicken delicately breaded and seasoned perfectly. Passion fruit margaritas hit the spot after a long work day. We had a superfood almond crusted salmon salad, a bbq ranch chicken salad,truffle honey chicken all of which delicious. Finish with key lime,snickers, and smores cheesecakes and we were set for the night. Service was great. All in all, a great way to celebrate a birthday"
Tyler B.,"Searcy, AR",20,1,1,5.0,6/2/2017,"California guacamole salad Great food, and great service.  Best salad I have ever had by far. Huge portion size as well. You can add grilled shrimp, chicken, steak, or avocado to it as well."
Tam A.,"Memphis, TN",125,10,3,1.0,7/1/2017,This in the hamburger sliders with a ton of onions and even more ketchup. These were the worse sliders I've EVER had. I mentioned it to the waitress. She said she told the manager and he will make sure it doesn't happen again. I don't understand what that has to do with the plate in front of me. JUST HORRIBLE!!!
Kella C.,"Memphis, TN",115,53,144,3.0,7/4/2016,"The service is amazing! Our waiter Damien was super attentive and definitely on his toes keeping up with the busy weekend dinner crowd.  Personally, I prefer cheesecake factory appetizers over the entrées. Maybe because I love part food,who knows.  My friend had the cajun chicken pasta,which was so good. I had a small Ceasar salad and the buffalo wings minus the sauce...got to keep it low carb lol Everything came out hot and exactly like we asked for it. It's almost impossible to come here and not get a slice of cheesecake....right? Well lucky for me they had a sugar free option. I was a little nervous because when you hear sugar free it doesn't sound all that exciting. I was pleasantly surprised, the sugar free option was wonderful, I couldn't even tell the difference."
Moe G.,"Oxford, MS",0,1,,1.0,11/15/2017,"What a S___ Show! Avoid this terrible restaurant. It's horribly managed, the food is bad, the service poor. I have been a fan of Cake for over 25 years, was so excited when they came to Memphis. At it's best, the Cheesecake Factory can be very good food, good service, in a beautiful setting. Most locations are quite good, a few locations are medium/fair, but the Memphis location is just plain bad. Actually it's the worst, by far, of any in the country. And sadly it seems to be getting worse. I'm done with it. I would rather drive the 180 miles to the Birmingham location than walk across the street to eat here."
Maria P.,"Memphis, TN",99,104,60,5.0,8/5/2017,Love this place. Love the service. Love they have Death by Chocolate flourless cake for us Celiacs. We will definitely be back.
Wanda L.,"Memphis, TN",76,29,17,1.0,9/9/2017,"On occasion, I end up getting a meal that would be best thrown out to the pigs.  Yesterday, a group of friends and I went to the Cheesecake Factory on Germantown Parkway in Memphis.  One of the friends had just suffered the death of her brother, and I have just recently been discharged from the hospital with pneumonia.  My friends and I all thought it would be good for us to get out for just a bit.  So .. . . this is where we chose.   I ordered the shrimp meal.  Huge, drastic mistake on my part.  This meal cost some $17.00 plus tax, plus tip.  Being on a fixed income, it is not often that I can order a meal this costly.  I was, however, quite hungry for a good meal after having been hospitalized and not eating much in the preceding days.  This shrimp was way over cooked that it was difficult to even bite it, much less chew it.  I think I managed to eat only two pieces of it before I pushed it aside and got a box to take it home.  My thought was that, after it had set a while and gotten ""soggy"" and then heated in the microwave, that it might 'soften' up a bit.  That was not the case, however,   Please trust me ---- if you want shrimp, do NOT get it at The Cheesecake Factory.  This was the most disappointing meal that I may have ever had.  I would choose Captian D's shrimp any day of the week over the mess I got at The Cheesecake Factory.  Trying to eat it was a horrible experience.  I most likely will never return there, nor will I recommend it to anyone.  It takes only ONE experience to ruin the party for me.   This was an expensive meal that was not fit to eat."
Brian L.,"Somerville, TN",209,425,2960,3.0,2/23/2016,"Upscale dining, good food, great dessert. Pricey. Made from scratch? Is it really a factory?  I had to come check out all this hype. I'd heard the menu was extensive, so I wanted to check it out online first. The online menu doesn't seem to work really well with an android mobile. I could read a partial description for each item, and see a camera icon, but whenever I'd click on these, it would take me in a circle back to the start again. Also, I couldn't find any prices at all on the online menu. Price is a determining factor in making a menu choice. Remember in Slingblade, Carl wanted to know if they had French fried potatoes? Then he asked how much do you want for them? Only then was he able to make a decision to buy some of the bigguns. Without that information, I cannot make a smart choice.  We walked in and were in awe of our surroundings. It's a big place, modern, and fancy. Of course, you see the dessert counter as soon as you walk in. We arrived at 1:00 Tuesday afternoon to avoid the crowd, were seated right away, and had excellent service. The menu is massive. We all came for a small lunch with dessert. I normally don't eat sweets, but I like cheesecake occasionally, and that's what I came for. I noticed the menu does not list prices for beer and most of the desserts. I also noticed it doesn't say the size of the pizza. It still wasn't easy to make a smart choice. I was hoping the lunch menu would have something in store for me, but even the lunch specials ranged from $11.00 to $14.50. I know it's a nice place, but this is pricey. $3.00 for a glass of tea? Why? Chicken biscuits were $17.00 if I remember correctly! I don't want a complete meal, and I don't want to spend everything I have. Also, the menu is so large, that it takes a lot of research to select something. The honey wheat bread was good. The sour dough was so tough it was hard to eat. The butter was too cold to spread. The crab artichoke dip was good, but the bread was extra tough. Crab balls, Greek salad, Asian lettuce wraps were just ok. The desserts and milkshakes were excellent. We asked what kind of ice cream the shake was made from, and the waitress said it just comes in on a big truck. Hmm. Not made from scratch. We asked the server if she gets to take food home. She said they don't allow employees to take food home and they throw all the extras in the dumpster every night. Funny, the website says under fun facts under FAQ, that they donate all of the extra food to feed hungry people through Harvest. She said they make all the cheesecake daily. Funny, the website doesn't say that. Everything I could find online says the cheesecake is trucked in frozen. Not really a factory is it? More of a restaurant that buys from a factory. I can get frozen cheesecake from the grocery.  Beef? What is American style Kobe? Kobe must come from Japan, period. There's no such thing as American Kobe. What they are selling is Wagyu. Some of the steaks are labeled as premium certified black Angus. Are we talking prime, select, choice? Are they aged? Some steaks are USDA branded, but again there are no descriptions beyond that. An educated diner knows this doesn't necessarily mean that they offer a superior beef product.  What does it mean that your fish are line caught when possible? Is this supposed to enhance the perception of quality? How does the customer know when it was possible? I always thought long lines were dangerous to birds. I'm always skeptical of the marketing phrase      ""made from scratch"",  especially when it is used vaguely. ""Made from scratch"" comes from sports and means to start off without an advantage. The menu is not specific enough to make it mean anything at all. Do they grind flour? Do they make fresh pasta? Do they make their cheesecake from cream cheese, or do they make the cream cheese? Do they make the cream? I can't find any evidence (other than our waitress saying so) that this restaurant even makes the cheesecake. Then you've got Oreos, peanut butter, Graham characters, ..... it's endless. Any fast food could claim that everything is made from scratch daily, because somewhere, it is. Astronomer Carl Sagan said ""If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."" I'm pretty sure we wouldn't even be here if not for the universe, so ""made from scratch"" wouldn't be possible.  The service and food were ok, but this just isn't the place for me."
Molly P.,"Memphis, TN",118,92,133,4.0,5/20/2016,"Being a Midtowner, I rarely make it out to the Wolfchase area. I did want to visit our Cheesecake Factory, so I took advantage of a work errand at the mall to tag on a lunch visit.  Service was quick, smooth and friendly. I was greeted and seated within a minute of walking in. I had not one but two servers helping little old me.  The menu could take years to peruse. It truly is one of the largest, prettiest menus around. Every dish looks and sounds delicious. Watching food come out from the kitchen reminds me that the portions are also enormous. So, of course, I over ordered. In my defense, I did order a lunch portion of a salad. My appetizer was big enough all on its own. I had to make myself stop eating it to have room for even a few bites of salad. I do like that the server takes the leftovers away to box them up rather than doing it at the table or letting Messy Molly (me) do it. That invariably winds up with me wearing some of the aforementioned leftovers. They also offered me a To Go beverage without me even asking.  Since I wasn't going home and didn't have a cooler with me, I skipped the dessert to go. That just gives me a reason to go back out to the Hinterlands. By and large, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but the Cheesecake Factory does what they do very well."
Kontji A.,"Memphis, TN",970,186,1231,5.0,8/29/2015,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory and the new Memphis location doesn't disappoint.  We had a great experience from start to finish.  I like the fact that you don't have to go inside the Wolfchase Galleria mall to access this restaurant. ;-)  I've never been to a Cheesecake Factory that didn't have a wait.  So expect to put your name down, get a pager and wait to be buzzed for seating.  To kill time, some people sit, others look inside nearby stores in the mall and still others go to the bar.  The menu is a million pages so you might want to google it before you get there to save time.  The good thing about the extensive menu is that there is something for everybody! I suggest you save your appetite before you go to Cheesecake Factory.  The portions are hefty and you want to make sure you have room for the delicious cheesecake.   They honestly have the best cheesecake I've ever had.  I get it plain - it has a yummy layer of sour cream on top.   Their cheesecake melts in your mouth and the food is so delicious.  Be prepared to roll outta there!"
Cindy G.,"Collierville, TN",0,3,,1.0,5/15/2017,"NEVER AGAIN!!! That sums up my experience. This was my first time at the Wolfchase location. When I lived in Nashville, I frequented the Cheesecake Factory there and had only positive experiences. I didn't expect the Memphis location to be as great, but I certainly didn't expect them to ruin my afternoon either. I stupidly made arrangements to meet my son for Mother's Day here, and I thought things would be ok if we arrived around 3:30-4pm. Not so much! We were told the wait would be an hour. We waited. And waited. And waited. After an hour, we were told it would take another 20 minutes. It took 30. After 1.5 hours of waiting to be seated (a party of 4), the hostess took us outside to the hot patio and sat us at a table where the sun was beating down on us and there was no fan nearby. I told her that they should ask people if they're ok with dining under the hot sun before assuming it's ok. She made a smart alleck comment and said she puts us where we can fit unless we are interested in waiting longer. I went inside and asked to speak to a manager 3 times. Never saw one. I told them that I actually have Systemic Lupus, and I can't sit out in the sun like that without getting very sick, possibly ending up in the hospital. They finally sat us at a table inside. Overall, it ruined my entire opinion of this place. They don't care about customer service.... not one bit. For their prices, they should treat people with dignity and respect, like any other restaurant in their price range would (considering I dropped $250 there). Oh, before we were seated, I asked why I was seeing so many people leave the restaurant but they weren't seating anyone over the 1.5 hour. She said that they were taking care of the larger parties first, and because I was just a party of 4, it was taking us longer to be seated. Do what??? So they intentionally seat larger parties first because they'll make more money!!??  The only redeeming part of this visit was the service and food after all of that happened. Service was pretty quick. I could have literally fallen out on the floor when the waiter said service would be quick because ""we haven't been very busy."" Honestly, I think they were not filling up their tables and leaving large portions of tables empty, making the waiters think that it ""wasn't busy."" The waiter was responsive and on top of things. Food came out pretty quickly. As always, the portions are always large enough to take home and eat later. Even still, if I ever return to a Cheesecake Factory, it will be the location in Nashville. I probably could have driven to Nashville and been served before the Memphis location could have seated me. Lastly, the fruit flies!! I didn't recall ordering them, but they were EVERYWHERE!!! I literally spent the entire time shooing them away from my food and drinks and trying to smush them. It's a sign of bigger problems lurking behind that we can't see, which should scare EVERYONE who eats there. Never again. Someone should contact the health department. I think that will be my next move."
Joseph G.,"Millington, TN",135,54,43,4.0,1/21/2017,Cheesecake factory is always just a fun place to eat. The environment is very chill and calming. The price always seems a little high to me but the portions are very large and you always take some home. And who doesn't love a delicious cheesecake at the end. The wait in Memphis is very long so just keep that in mind.
John B.,"Memphis, TN",7,62,46,1.0,11/22/2016,"I came here to enjoy a birthday dinner with my friend. I ordered the shrimp sandwich which was ok. My sweet potato fries were burnt so I had to send them back. Still never received them... 5 of my friends (seriously) had burnt food: a burnt burger, jambalaya, fries... the food was very lackluster.  This is my 2nd disappointing experience at this location. I don't think I'll come back."
Mike K.,"Hickory Withe, TN",2,99,55,3.0,7/27/2016,"Good:  Seated in a reasonable amount of time on a Saturday night, simply superb hamburger sliders as an appetizer, incredibly good Kahlua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake (and I'm not usually wild about cheesecake), friendly server and a nice interior.   Not so good:  average shrimp, average chicken and average salmon; slow service; can't-have-a-conversation-loud and somewhat pricey. Tip:  the menu is ambitious - peruse it ahead of time."
Shelby B.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,1,5.0,8/14/2017,"Had a gift card that I needed to use, so I stopped in this evening for dinner. Service was excellent. My servers' name was Hailey (sp?) and she was excellent! She knew I was having dinner by myself, so she gave me space but was very attentive. My drink glass was never empty, which was a first for me at this restaurant. I started with the spinach and cheese dip and my main course was the Ribeye steak. The appetizer was good, a little on the room temperature side instead of hot like I would have preferred, but the flavor was delightful. My Ribeye I ordered Rare and it was cooked perfectly, very juicy and tender. Will definitely be back to see this server again!"
Amanda S.,"Memphis, TN",3,36,55,4.0,1/27/2017,"Wait time is usually crazy long ... But the food is good (but a little on the expensive side). We typically go here to eat for ""special occasions"" haha. Very friendly staff and great atmosphere. I personally recommend the Chicken Madeira entree - Delish!! (posted a photo of it)"
Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516,4.0,9/27/2015,"I adore the location in Nashville so I knew I had to try this one as well for my birthday and my parents' anniversary (we double up celebrations a lot lol). I will admit we had the same problems as other people with the slow service, but hopefully that fixes itself over the next year so when I return it's still amazing. I did enjoy them singing for us and I'm glad we got two pieces of cheesecake at the end so they could decorate our plates with our different celebrations. :) So much fun!  Ok, so something new I realized about this place for me: they do strong flavors really really well but muted flavors not so much. For example, the flavor-laden dish hubby got was as good as it is in the other location whereas the simpler dishes my parents and I opted for were either bland or just ok. I will have to definitely stick to strong flavors here, though that's no problem for me since I usually sway that way anyway.  I thought I heard the strawberry shortcake won some kind of award for best dessert but me and my family were not impressed. I really liked the eggroll sampler as I got to find my favorite sauces and eggrolls. We were surprised the chilaquiles here were just not that great. Chilaquiles tend to taste awesome at restaurants but these were just meh. I did find my new fav cheesecake in the chocolate hazelnut crunch.  We will definitely give them another shot next year, but if it's like being on Hell's Kitchen (which is what Dad compared it to because of the long wait to get our food) then hubbs and I will just stick to going to the Nashville location.  To Try:  - Adam's PB Cup Fudge Ripple - Snickers Bar Chunks and Cheesecake - Mango Key Lime Cheesecake - Reese's PB Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Tiramisu Cheesecake - Key lime Cheesecake - Cajun Jambalaya Pasta  fav meal with angel hair pasta and double sauce Loved: - 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake - Avocado Cream (eggroll sauce)  - Avocado Eggroll - Caramel Cheesecake - Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Cheesecake  - Dulce de Leche Hot Chocolate - Oreo Shake - Samosas - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Penne) - Strawberry Lemonade  - Tamarind-Cashew (eggroll sauce) - Tex Mex Eggroll - Wheatbread  Like:  - Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp (Chicken only) - Eggroll Sampler - Pumpkin Cheesecake - Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (Angel Hair) hubby fav - Stuffed Mushrooms Ok: - Chicken Bellagio - Dulce de Leche Cheesecake - Factory Nachos - Factory Peach Bellini - Firecracker Salmon Eggroll  - Fresh Basil, Tomato, and Cheese Flatbread  - Frozen Iced Mango - Green Chilaquiles with Carnitas and Eggs - Miso-glazed Salmon - Sweet Hot Chili Sauce (eggroll sauce) - Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Galore Cheesecake - Veggie Burger - Warm Apple Crisp Nah:  - Bistro's Shrimp Pasta - Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake (Joel liked) - Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake - Crispy Cuban Eggroll - Cucumber Lemonaid - Fresh Strawberry Shortcake - Guacamole (Mild) - Portabella, Avocado, and Zucchini Fries - Strawberry Fruit Smoothie - Tomato Basil with Pasta (chicken) - Turlte Pecan Cheesecake"
Lauren C.,"Memphis, TN",107,195,619,4.0,9/18/2016,"There are many downsides to dining at Cheesecake Factory Memphis, but there is apparently one huge upside. The Americana BURGER! Today is national cheeseburger day and boy did I celebrate!  I have never been so pleasantly surprised with a quality burger in my life. I forgot to order the burger medium and it still came out the most gorgeous shade of pink. The grilled flavor was also a delicious surprise! The potato crisps added the crunch and the grilled onions added the flavor. It was a big mess of a thing, but for the flavor - I will forgo tidiness.  There are headaches: The crowd, the book of a menu to sort through, the crowd.  The prices can be outrageous, but you get two meals in one basically. The shrimp platter is enough for three meals! The kid's pizza is large enough for an adult. If you invest on a meal you can heat up leftovers of, it's money well spent.  (Next time I'm sitting outside to get decent photos.)"
Michaela B.,"Searcy, AR",0,1,1,5.0,6/2/2017,I ordered Baja chicken tacos and they were amazing. They came with the best lime rice I have ever had! Awesome service! Loved how much guacamole came on each taco. Great portion sizes!
Eliana M.,"Collierville, TN",18,23,19,5.0,12/23/2016,Always a good choice when you can't decide what to eat. The Sunday brunch is amazing especially the brûlée French toast!
Brittany S.,"Cordova, Cordova, TN",0,6,,2.0,10/7/2017,I love the cheesecake factory just not this location. The food is just not cooked well compared to others i have tried up north. The service is questionable and i feel like the prices could be spared based on the fact this is just not a very good representation of the cheesecake factory
Phillip S.,"Memphis, TN",34,78,112,2.0,1/17/2016,"I just wanted to write about the atrocious experience I had at Cheesecake Factory at the Wolfchase Galleria in Memphis.  We arrived at 4:30 pm (you know, to beat the dinner rush) on a Saturday, and were quoted a 55-70 min wait!  That in itself is ridiculous and is a testament that Cheesecake Factory made this location way too small for the size of city that Memphis is.  The decision to not build a larger, stand alone restaurant is down right head scratching.  I've eaten at many different Cheesecake Factories and this is by far the smallest and most cramped.  Absolutely appalling for the size of city Memphis is.   After waiting past our 70 minute quoted time (80 minutes to be seated actually), my party of 5 was then squished into a booth clearly only meant for 4 people max!  One of my party members had to sit at the end in a chair.  I complained to our waitress who brought over this completely monotone, bullcrap answer giving ""manager"".  There was a much larger booth right behind us that was empty that they wouldn't move us to.  There were much larger booths around us that had only parties of 5 as well!  At this point we were so frustrated with the wait that we just wanted to order.   After our appetizers came out, we noticed we didn't even have any napkins.  In fact, when we sat down all we had were a few forks sat next to small plates.  But no napkins or other silverware.  We brought this to the attention of our waitress.....she never did return in a timely manner with napkins, as our hands were gunked with food from the appetizers.  We had to end up stealing the napkins at the empty booth behind us.   Then our meals came out.....we still didn't have a full complement of silverware, so we had to ask for a knife so my friend could cut her steak.  Then my son's spaghetti order came out wrong, and instead they brought out some type of other shaped pasta.  This got my son highly upset and he started bursting into tears.   As I've stated earlier, I've eaten at many different cheesecake factories around the country, and this was the only time I've ever had an atrocious experience.  All the food we ate was good, so I won't fault the restaurant on that, but the customer experience at this Memphis location is severely lacking.  This restaurant needed to be bigger....it's clearly overwhelmed by the popularity, and the staff clearly can't handle the crowds without customer service being in the tank!  Considering it's a 40 minute drive for us from where we live to go to this Cheesecake Factory, I can't say I'm clamoring to come back anytime soon."
Ericka C.,"Arlington, TN",1,6,37,3.0,6/16/2017,"Sooooo.... It's rare that Cheesecake Factory Memphis gets it right and tonight was no exception.  The kids quesadilla and Alfredo pasta were both good per my daughters. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was heavily breaded and greasy and stuck together. My advice to you is to never order this dish. We've tried it twice and got the same result each time. My husband and I both ordered the bone in New York strip cooked medium. The manager came out after several minutes and told us it would be longer than usual because one of the steaks were overcooked but offered to still bring the overcooked steak while we waited on the medium steak. We opted to wait instead. My New York strip finally arrived and it was cooked medium well but NOT medium but quite flavorful. The mash potatoes were lukewarm per usual but the green beans were great. Then about 15 minutes later my husband's steak came out and it was a ribeye instead of the New York strip  that we ordered but he didn't complain. He said it was flavorful but his mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well but the green beans were good. We also ordered Long Island ice teas which were perfection! We would definitely get those again. Lastly, we ordered our cheesecakes to go, one vanilla bean and one banana. The vanilla bean is excellent and it's my go to Cheesecake because I don't like very rich deserts and this Cheesecake has a nice balance. The same goes for my husband's banana cheesecake, it was great! Same thing, very good and not too rich! Overall food was good, service was ok and we will return. I took off two stars for the service and the calamari."
Dana W.,"Monticello, AR",5,145,11,4.0,9/4/2017,"My husband and I decided to venture out to the Galleria to try the Cheesecake Factory during our recent visit to Memphis. We have never eaten at one before. I know, unbelievable right? We normally avoid chains on vacation and stick to local food. I had the bacon truffle grilled cheese and he had the Riesling chicken (which is what I really wanted, but you have to save room for Cheesecake). His was better than mine, but they were both good. The grilled cheese was messy and a little tough to bite into, but still tasty. After we ate the obligatory meal, it was Cheesecake time! I ordered the celebration Cheesecake and he had the lemon meringue. Both were good but the celebration cake was better. The layer of strawberry mousse was the best part. I couldn't eat it all because it was huge, so my husband got to eat my leftovers later in our hotel room. I would definitely recommend the celebration Cheesecake for anyone who likes cake, Cheesecake, mousse and cream cheese icing. It doesn't get much better than that combination! (I could do without the crunchy sprinkles though)"
Jonathan N.,"Memphis, TN",0,2,,1.0,11/25/2017,"Tonight my wife and I went to The Cheescake Factory with our 14 year old daughter and her friend. We were seated quickly and the server was very attentive. We received our drinks and bread/appetizer pretty quick. We ordered our food and about 30 minutes later the server came to verify our order because the computer crashed. After an hour some of the food came out but not all. We asked where the rest was and were told it was coming. The ones with food patiently waited without eating to be polite. Twenty minutes later the rest came out and our food was cold. The manager apologized and offered us all cheesecake. He said it was the least he could do. However when the server came he informed us that the manager had only agreed to 2 pieces. I told him that all 4 of us had been inconvenienced. He said he would ask the manager to agree to a piece for each of us. He came back to inform me that the manager refused. It wasn't the fact that we were only getting 2 pieces of cheesecake. It was that after our food was extremely late and cold, the manager was not even sincerely sorry for our bad experience. He really didn't care that our food was cold and very late. The Cheescake Factory doesn't need to make every customer feel valued. I guess they have more customers than they need and can treat some badly and get away with it."
Jody W.,"Gansevoort, NY",135,643,1575,3.0,4/4/2016,"This review is based on take-out for about 10 people...can't speak to the sit-down dining experience at this location. Everyone enjoyed what they had - I ordered the ""skinnylicous"" shrimp summer rolls. They're only 410 calories and I wasn't terribly hungry - so they were just the right amount of food.  They did bring a piece of chocolate cake and a slice of caramel cheesecake. I tasted both:  The cheesecake was OK...not as dense as I prefer...the chocolate layer cake was really good. Instant diabetes on a plate.  I'm glad to see that they have lower calorie options these days on that ""skinnylicous"" menu (as it has been quite a while since I have been to a CF). Good to know."
Gerald M.,"Farmington, MN",27,7,,1.0,1/10/2017,"I am writing this review as the Lady at the counter is visibly unhappy i made a change in the size of the cheesecake i ordered. They did not have the 6"" on display so when they brought it out i had to switch to a 7"" cake. Cheesecake factory is a franchise restaurant and is one of the more desirable and consistent menus available at every location. Service is much to be desired especially when you politely apologize for the change and receive an answer of ""what do you want"" and clank away with utensils to show how disgruntled she was with the change. Oh well we still got the cheesecake for my kids but its just unfortunate they had to witness and hear the unprofessional service. I still will buy because its my kids favorite cheesecake."
