Adam A.,"Memphis, TN",3,15,,4.0,6/21/2016,"Aside from the wait and it being a chain restaurant, we had a very good experience. Little on the pricey side but the food was defiantly worth the money. And had one of the best peach Bellini's I have ever had. I defiantly recommend the Godiva cheesecake for dessert. It is amazing!"
Yolonda S.,"Memphis, TN",61,45,19,3.0,5/27/2016,"I visited and the food and service was good. I went on a Thursday at lunchtime. Not too long a wait and the waitress was good. The food was good but it not the Cheesecake ambience I'm used to in larger cities like ATL and St. Louis. Overall, it was okay."
Florestela G.,"Memphis, TN",68,108,42,4.0,2/24/2016,"First Time trying The Cheesecake Factory and I am a big fan! I went at lunch time on a Monday and there was no wait time. I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it was the bomb! I got the lunch portion and still had some leftover for dinner. My daughter had the kid's pizza and she enjoyed it. I got the classic cheesecake and was not disappointed. I also had to take half of the cheesecake to go. The entire meal was delicious. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is pricey. Even the lunch menu was pretty high, but I know that will not stop me from coming back and trying some more items on the menu."
Denise B.,"Memphis, TN",6,54,6,1.0,5/8/2016,Have Dessert Only. Our server gave our table to another server after taking our drink order. But she was great. The portions are great but the food was bland and prepared slowly. Probably won't visit on a Saturday night ever again.
Joseph M.,"Memphis, TN",2,11,,3.0,2/6/2016,"Service was great.  Our waiter checked in on us every few mins almost to the point of being needy.  He was great.   The food tasted good but the portions were pitifully.  Wife ordered steak and shrimp, she got 3 shrimp and 4 steak madalions."
Louis L.,"El Paso, TX",17,135,77,2.0,4/1/2016,"Big disappointment. They brought our food on the  heals of our main course. While the Tex-Mex Egg Rolls were tasty, the shepherd's pie and ban ban shrimp were below CCF standards."
Hoang N.,"Memphis, TN",159,30,2,5.0,12/2/2015,"So after reading a few of the reviews on here I felt like i needed to chime in about my experience here. Because either I live in a parallel universe and have been to a completely different restaurant than everyone else or there are a few people on here that are just naturally unhappy people. But going through their reviews it seems like all they do is complain. (I wonder if they ever thought the problem might be with them, constantly getting shitty service everywhere you go? Maybe you should be less of snobby bitch and servers will be nice to you.) I have been here approximately a dozen times since its opening. Including training night. Each time I go the hostess staff always makes good conversation with me and most of them remember me from the previous time. Wait times are never unreasonable unless you go during the lunch or dinner rush but that's to be expected. (Unless you're the type of person that complains about traffic during rush hour, but common sense can't be taught so there's not much anyone can do to help you, yet alone any managers)  I have both sat at the bar for service and gotten tables. There have been times when service was less then spectacular. But these times usually coincide with dining during the busiest times and most of the mistakes were done by the kitchen not my server. When I brought it up to the server she apologized and had my meal remade and expedited. She even went as far as having a manager comp it off my tab. (The things that happen when you're a polite human being and recognize that mistakes happen and you don't have to be a flying douche every time something goes wrong). Even when service was lacking, I once politely informed out server that she had forgotten a condiment request, when she apologized I told her I recognized she's covering a very large section of the restaurant and that I understand how it could have slipped her mind and to hang in there. You'll never guess what happened! She brought us a free slice of cheese cake for being understanding. (Again, don't act like a douche canoe and treat people like humans and they'll take care of you)  As far as the bar goes, only once have I gone to the bar where the bartender recognized me, although they do seem to have a large rotating bar staff so that's understandable. When the bartenders are busy tending the bar and other customers (you know their job?) all it took was for me to open my mouth (that collection of muscles in front of your teeth and contains your tongue) and ask for a drink and service. Low and behold! They came over to help me! I didn't have to sit 10 mins in passive aggressive silence waiting for them to notice me while attending to 20 other people.  As far as the food goes, portions are large unless you're super fat or have a diet of 6000 calories a day be prepared to have left overs or share a meal. Prices are high, it's a fine dining restaurant, that's to be expected. You don't go into dillard's and expect to pay Walmart prices do you? (If you do, refer to my being a douche references and try to refrain from showing yourself in public, the world is a better place when you sit at home wallowing in your own hate, unless you plan on walking in front of a bus, in that case please continue on with your plans)  Summary. Don't be a pain in the ass and you get surprisingly good service. Food is great staff is wonderful. Prices are on the higher side, but you get what you pay for."
Jerry S.,"Memphis, TN",82,133,24,4.0,4/9/2016,We went for a Saturday morning breakfast--they only have brunch on Sunday but there were plenty of omelets and other appropriate options.  I was really impressed with the service and apart from that it was the Cheesecake Factory quality I've come to expect and massive portions: the smoothie was even huge!
Ronnie L.,"Irving, TX",2,12,,3.0,2/23/2016,Service was decent and the food was alright. I have been to better locations in other parts of the country. There wasn't anything to complain about but wasn't anything impressive enough to write about either.
Mark J.,"Cordova, TN",0,17,,1.0,5/22/2016,Service has deteriorated significantly!!! The last two times we have gone the food came out not at once but at different times - we are talking like a 5 min wait between each plate they would bring!   This happened TWICE!!!!   Managers were not very sympathetic at all. Going out to dinner is supposed to be fun and relaxing - right??
Chris L.,"Kingsport, TN",56,20,2,5.0,2/20/2016,Wait staff was very friendly. Seating and wait times are always an issue. We went on a rainy Tuesday night and it was still a long wait. The food and atmosphere are amazing. There menu was like 100 pages long so I am sure there is something for everyone.
Kevin W.,"Memphis, TN",123,17,,2.0,2/15/2016,"Very subpar food at this location. I mean for it to be a chain, it's amazing how much different the taste was here as opposed to Nashville and Atlanta. Service was pretty good but the food quality did not seem the same."
Ankur S.,"Memphis, TN",0,2,,1.0,4/24/2016,Did not want to write a bad review but food from yesterday i am totally disappointed. Uncooked food.
Roland P.,"Oxford, AL",1,1,1,2.0,1/7/2016,I have eaten here twice and this by far is the worst Cheesecake Factory I have eaten at. The service is slow and does not pay attention.
Daniel S.,"Memphis, TN",3,2,,1.0,11/6/2015,"FYI, I sent a version of this to Cheesecake customer service on their website on October 15, 2015 and never received any communication from the company. They do not value their customers... My wife was given a $25 gift card for Cheesecake Factory by a co-worker. We had never been to the restaurant and were excited to check it out. We went there on Tuesday, October 13th but the manager was outside and told us that the refrigerator was broken and that their menu was limited to cheesecake, pizza, and salad. We looked at the big menu displayed outside and we decided to try the next day. The next day we came back. It was very busy, unlike the day before, so we knew the refrigerator must have been working. We waited about 10 minutes and were seated. My wife ordered the spicy chicken sandwich & fries and I ordered the dinner version of Evelyn pasta. The food was brought out minus the french fries. The person said the fries would be out soon. Our waitress walked by and made sure we were getting our fries. Our waitress then came back later and said they'd be out shortly because they just started frying some. She came back again and said that it's taking longer because one of their fryers ""exploded."" By that time, we were both finished eating. The fries were finally brought out at the same time as the check and to-go boxes. We then ate the fries, in lieu of dessert, since fries are not good as leftovers re-heated. We were never offered an alternative to the fries, nor any compensation to make up for the inconvenience that ruined my wife's meal. My wife insisted on speaking to a manager, but I said let's just wait and email the company. As we were leaving, she insisted again, so she asked the hostess, behind the center table, if she could speak with a manager. The hostess said, ""Ok,"" and went on about her job. My wife waited approximately 5 minutes and we left without speaking to anyone. Within that 5 minutes, the hostess never followed up or said that the manager was on the way. The whole experience was highly disappointing, especially when you're spending over $36 (20% tip included) for lunch."
Felicia M.,"Cordova, Memphis, TN",187,17,49,3.0,1/18/2016,The service and the cheesecake was nice. The food was nasty. I had the meatloaf and literally could only take two bites. Management was nice and allowed me to switch out for the pasta but the noodles were under done. The location is very busy. Overall I'd only come for drinks and cheesecake.
Tracy D.,"Memphis, TN",3,29,,5.0,10/25/2015,"Great reviews so far. Our server, Kaylie, was wonderful. She checked in on is, took our order in plenty of time, and always took care of us. Our food arrived in a timely manner, and was hot and tasted great.  I'm not sure of the negative reviews except for maybe because it was new and everyone wasn't trained?  We were in and out in under an hour on a Sunday afternoon. Granted, it was about 4:45.  I ordered the meatloaf and it was wonderful. My husband ordered the chicken Marsala and thought the sauce was a tad sweet but still good.  We will certainly be back."
Tracy M.,"White Haven, PA",163,135,72,3.0,10/3/2015,"Ok , after a 1.5 hour wait, we had the crab cakes, they were very good. I had the mushroom burger, it was cooked to my liking med. it was very good. My wife had the chicken terriyaki, she said it was good. The waitress needed some training skills, but the place was super busy, so I give her some slack. Overall it was okay, not so much to get excited about. It was noisy and very crowded. After the newness wears done, I will go back and try another dish. And we did take home two pieces of chocolate cheesecake."
Frank U.,"Arlington, TN",72,97,28,2.0,9/15/2015,"Food was good, the service was not good at all.  We decided to go on a Thursday night at 1930-hrs.  We expected a wait to be seated so that was not bad.  Took them one-hour to get us to a table.  Once we where buzzed, they sent us to another location to wait to be seated.  So two different waits to be seated.  Once seated, it took our waitress (Rachael C) 15-min to come to out table.  We ordered two waters and the Avocado Eggrolls to start.  10-mins later, the waters showed up.  Then our appetizers of the eggrolls which were the sampler rolls not the Avocado Rolls, which is bad because my fiance is a vegetarian and 50% of the sampler is meat related.  Waitress said she was sorry and that was it on that, no ""can I put the right order in"" or ""can I offer you something else"".  Ordered the main meals..our waters were empty, waitress stated she will get us more and she never came back.  Server came with the meals and she was the one that got our waters.  We were always out of our beverage and it was not until we were complete with our meals and sitting looking around, our waitress came back and asked if we needed anything else.  With the horrible service, I stated check only.  We skipped the cheesecake because we did not want to wait another 30-mins to get our dessert.  We did not walk out until 2300-hrs. To sum it up: 1-hr wait to be seated 3-hrs to get one appetizer, main meal and waters (with only one refill) I gave it a two because of the food being good but if I could place a star ranking for service it would of been in the negative side."
Amy J.,"Hickory Hill, Memphis, TN",0,3,,1.0,10/12/2015,"I had the worse experience at this fairly new location. Well, the hostess was extremely nice!!! But my waitress.... UGH, DOUBLE UGH!! My waitress name was Jenny and she was horrible. Let's begin with the drink order.. I regret to inform you that we waited 20 minutes on straws, only for me to get up and locate another waiter for straws. She forgot to put in our appetizer, which came out a few minutes (3-5) shortly before our entree.  She NEVER checked on us for refills- or for ANYTHING for that matter. I actually had to request more water on two different occasions; not to mention, she had a reaction as if I was bothering her.. REALLY?!? Unfortunately, my salmon was not well done, as I requested. I actually had to find another waiter to locate her to send it back... This was after 15 minutes. After sending it back, she managed to check on two more tables with my salmon in her HAND.... (Are you serious) Needless to say, that I will NOT going back to wolfchase, I'd much rather be going back to Nashville for my next cheese cake factory. Please please please before sitting, request that you are NOT seated in Jenny's section."
