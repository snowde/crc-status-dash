Daniel C.,"Widener, AR",75,2,,1.0,10/7/2015,"I was passing through Memphis while on a business trip and decided to dine with Cheesecake Factory for the first time. Against my better judgement, I ignored the reviews about this particular location. I consider myself to be a foodie, and dine out often. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.  Strike 1 - While being seated, I saw an empty booth and asked if I could have that table, the host told me no. I understand the ""rotation"" policy with seating servers, but a guest should never be told no on a request that is reasonable.  Strike 2 - We weren't greeted by a server for 10 minutes. It took even longer to get drinks out. Or server also did not make a single suggestion or operate by any Step of Service. Being a corporate restaurant, I imagine servers are trained on what a step of service is. What I did see, was servers standing around not working. All congregating around the POS systems and chatting, not waiting in line to ring things in. I saw a staff that did not practice teamwork, or Full Hands In/Full Hands Out. Our server was clearly busy and dealing with more than she could handle. She was triple sat, which is an unacceptable practice and your hosts are setting up your servers for failure. Not once did I see a manager floating around or doing table visits so I could express my concerns. After placing the entree order and waiting 45 minutes, and the appetizer still had NOT arrived, we decided to leave.  In conclusion, my experience was terrible and I will never return and encourage others to do the same. Just because your company name is a chain restaurant, does not mean you have to operate like one. As we left my partner made the comment, ""this restaurant is dead, it can't even be repaired."" We weren't expecting ""fine dining,"" but we did expect to be treated as guests, not customers. A 45 minute appetizer is unacceptable, a 10 minute wait for a greet is unacceptable. A manager should have approached us to apologize for dropping the ball. Our server didn't even apologize. Even McDonalds apologizes if you have to wait longer than expected."
David B.,"Arlington, TN",1,8,3,4.0,4/3/2016,"I've been to the new one they opened about six months ago in memphis, tn four times. Three out of the four visits went perfect with great service and excellent food.  The fourth visit didn't go so well, I tried the orange chicken and had to send it back. The chicken was fried perfectly crisp but that was about the only thing they got right. The only thing I could taste was oil until I dug for the orange sauce, which was almost none existant. Under the chicken the carrots tasted like charr. All around it was a bad dish. I wasn't going to try that dish again so I got the Chipotle chicken and  noodles instead and it was ok. Not all together the best visit. Despite the one poor experience I will be back and would still recommend it to others. The cheesecake is always work the guilt. Prices are a little higher but the portion sizes are huge, plan on getting two meals out of any dinner. If you don't want left overs go with some who has similar taste and share. But not the cheesecake, you never share that."
T B.,"Cordova, TN",0,29,,1.0,1/21/2016,"Too expensive, over $70 for two burgers and two small slices of cheesecake. Service is slow, burgers are good. Oh, and they opened 15 minutes late while people froze in the rain."
Mathew P.,"Memphis, TN",5,35,18,4.0,12/2/2015,"Great great great place to eat. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the sheer amount of items on the menu. They have anything and everything you can think of...Chinese, Italian, American, Cajun, everything lol. But everything tastes amazing. The meatloaf was delicious as was the Jamaican shrimp. But the center of it all is of course the cheesecake. They have so many varieties and every single one of them is so good. They have a convenient counter just to order the cheesecake so you don't have to wait at a table just for desert."
Melanie L.,"Collierville, TN",37,125,29,4.0,10/27/2015,"I'm pleasantly surprised they got the kinks out!  Friendly hostesses, no wait, very efficient and friendly server named Beth, and the food prepared exactly as it should be matching all other Cheesecake Factory locations.  Way to go Memphis!  We started with the calamari, it was hot and tasty but perhaps too salty.  Then I had the chicken club sandwich with a side salad and hubby had the Luau salad.  Our favs came just as we liked em.  Finished with a red velvet cheesecake to go and we had a nice meal out on a Tuesday!  Beth did not rush us but checked on us frequently and was quick to get the check back when our daughter was anxious to leave.  I can't wait to come back with the girls for cheesecake and coffee!"
Michelle Williams B.,"Oakland, TN",4,4,2,2.0,1/4/2016,"It's nice but it's just too busy and too small!  And what's up with the lady behind serving the Cheesecake individually! I mean she is not happy or something she doesn't even smile and sounds like she's not pleased with her assignment,  but she does thank you for coming but her eyes just are hateful to me! Service with a smile is not just a d slogan it should be a mission."
John Z.,"Memphis, TN",6,11,1,5.0,10/18/2015,Went here for my uncle's birthday during Sunday brunch.  The place was busy and we had a short wait to get a table but the staff were all friendly and accommodating.  Our server was great and the food was better than I was expecting.  I would definitely come back.
Victoria T.,"Memphis, TN",2,4,,3.0,9/19/2015,"Food was great, but the service could be better. We had to wait numerous times for our bartender to even check on us. The bar back was better than the actual server."
Adrienne W.,"Arlington, TN",5,24,16,1.0,9/15/2015,"So I decided to visit the Cheesecake Factory for a family members birthday. My experience was terrible from beginning to end. We arrived around 6 to be seated at a table for 7. We were told that the wait would be 60 mins, but over 2 hours later we still were not seated. The hostess decided to argue with me about the fact that she said my table was ready WHEN IT WAS NOT! Then she told me that she was talking to someone next to me?!?!?! Literally NOBODY was next to me. Our server was sweet and had a positive attitude however she was stretched thin. Take my advice and head to Nashville if you want service with a smile."
LaMar L.,"Cordova, TN",185,13,8,2.0,11/15/2015,The service was not good at all. Asked to speak to a manager about the quality of my food and he never showed. Will not be back.
Andrew O.,"Memphis, TN",41,50,9,3.0,10/27/2015,"I had first visited The Cheesecake Factory in Memphis back in the beginning of September. The experience then was decent, but the restaurant had only been opened a week. It was extremely busy, with a extremely long wait as one would expect. The service was adequate, and the food was good. Nothing to write home about, but they had just opened and it takes some time to get everything and everyone working together.  I wanted to wait until my next visit to Memphis, and the Cheesecake Factory to write a review, as it would be unfair to rate the experience on a newly opened restaurant. This review is mostly about my second visit.  When you walk in, and give your name you are either given a buzzer and an estimated wait time, or seated promptly like in many comparable restaurants. When our table was ready we were told to go stand behind the hostess station, this was a bit confusing for us, but we still ended up at our table. Our waiter, who had the same name as me was quick to greet us and drop off glasses of water. We took a while to order, and he was extremely patient, and friendly with us.  This place had become famous for their cheesecake, afterall it is in the name. But I seldom get to enjoy it, because they are also known for their large portions of food.  This trip did not disappoint. We knew we wanted dessert, so we skipped soups, salads, and appetizers (last time we had the Crispy Crab Wontons, and Thai Lettuce Wraps, wontons where OK, Lettuce Wraps were phenomenal) and ordered the Factory Burrito, and the Factory Burger. They both came out promptly and were done just as we ordered. They were both quite large, and a struggle to eat 3/4th of them. We could have finished, but after all we came here for Cheesecake.  We went with the Chocolate Mousse, the cheesecake portion was rich and dense, and the moose portion was light and airy. Just as it should be. The waiter split it in half for us, giving us twice as much whipped topping. Last time we had Key Lime and something that was all chocolate, needless to say we took all of the chocolate and half the key lime home.  In conclusion, this place improved drastically over the 7 weeks or so between our visits. The wait time was nothing almost nothing, the food came out quick and the order was perfect. Our server was very attentive and kind. I look forward to my next visit to The Cheesecake Factory in Memphis."
Velnest B.,"Cordova, TN",2,18,2,5.0,11/30/2015,"I decided to try something different and ordered the Shepherd's Pie. It tasted great. Of course, I had cheesecake. Stayed more traditional and had strawberry cheesecake. It was delicious. Going back soon to try the seasonal peppermint bark cheesecake. Service was good. We were seated rather quickly but had to wait approx 20-35 minutes to get out food."
Bhavana K.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,1,2.0,11/27/2015,Not so good food.  Ordered evelyn pasta and the cook doesn't know the ingredients. She had go back and rebook it and bring it. Not good
Wes K.,"Olive Branch, MS",0,8,,1.0,12/12/2015,DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. Take your little beeper thing and sit down or the hostesses will embarras you in front of everyone.  Don't complain on them either.  Good is average at best but be prepared to wait an hour and half to find out regardless what they tell you at the front desk.  Make sure you ask for ice in your beverage too. We have been 6 times but it's always an ordeal so we have since retired from there this evening.  $15 for a sandwich and specialties run a little higher.  Cheesecake is high but it's pretty good. Wouldn't want to fight the staff though.  It will be you and like 29 others upset with the wait and ect so at least you won't be alone.
Nadeene I.,"Brighton, TN",3,45,5,3.0,8/15/2016,"I have been to many Cheesecake Factories across the U.S but I feel something is missing at this Memphis location. The food has been wonderful with the same great tastes! We haven't had a bad cheesecake as we try a different one each time! I just feel the staff isn't as caring or professional. For the money being paid for the plates, I expect a bit of an upscale service. I feel like the bread doesn't come unless we ask for it(several occasions)"
Amber B.,"Memphis, TN",127,1,,2.0,9/23/2015,"Ive been to several cheesecake factories around the country and this has been by far the worst. Granted, I know its new and trying to get up and running but man. I went on a Saturday night so I expected it to be crazy. We got there at 8:00. Was told the wait would be 80 minutes which was fine. We went into the mall and shopped and went back. We waited about 20 minutes before our buzzer went off. They send you to another location to wait where theres complete chaos and you aren't sure who your supposed to be looking for or whos seating you. It was a very confusing set up. Someone started yelling our name and 8 feet away was the person seating us. We were seated and immediately greeted. Server took water orders and took several minutes to return. She came with no bread and stated that the kitchen as backed up. About 15 minutes later she finally came with bread. We went ahead and ordered our food. She came by several times and would peek into booth but not close enough where I could tell her we need more bread and water. We had our empty bread basket sitting close to the edge trying to give her a hint to ask for more bread. The next thing I know a completely different server walked by and grabbed the bread basket as he walked by so fast that I couldn't ask for more. This was ridiculous. We were thirsty, breadless, and our waitress was no where to be found. Our food finally came. Mine was pipping hot. I got the Cajun pasta. My buddy got the salmon and mashed potatoes with asparagus which came out COLD and seasonless. It tasted horrible. Our waitress never came back and I had an empty glass forever it seemed like. She finally refilled and we ordered cheesecake. It took 20 minutes for a slice of cheesecake to go to come out. Okay food but ridiculous service."
Alicia C.,"Memphis, TN",4,9,33,5.0,3/5/2016,"So, I gave them another chance. We have been back several times and the service has been great each time. The factory hamburger and fries is so good. I also had a salad with grilled chicken and avocado.  Absolutely delicious. So glad we have this restaurant in the mall."
Gayle S.,"Memphis, TN",31,120,33,5.0,9/25/2015,We attended with a very large party and our server was very attentive at all times. Very large gluten free menu that was absolutely delicious. Look forward to returning to try new items soon.
Scott B.,"Memphis, TN",50,54,,2.0,8/10/2016,"First off, if you enter any Cheesecake Factory on a Friday evening around 6pm and there isn't a wait or a catastrophic event happening, it's probably a sign you should eat someplace else. This was the second time in a row at the Cheesecake Factory where my family and I were seated without utensils. Waitress was double-seated so I wasn't worried she wasn't going to get to us. However, upon bringing the drinks and later our appetizer, we had to then ask for silverware. What's up with the hostesses right? Anyway, the chicken in my wife's salad was a little questionable but she got her answer upon her first bite. We had several dishes arrive at our table that wasn't ours that were sent back to the kitchen. I can only guess they made their way eventually to the correct table. Memphis is always the bastard stepchild to anything great whether it might be a department store or chain restaurant. The Cheesecake Factory is yet another example. Night and day difference between here and Nashville. This is not a restaurant where a server learns to cut their teeth but it feels like this is training ground for Waiters 101. In fact, I don't think I've seen the same employee twice since the Cheesecake Factory opened. Just an overall disappointment considering my family knows what the other locations are like. Food isn't bad when it's cooked to the right temperature and the staff is nice and apologetic but you can only apologize so many times. I'll be giving Sara Lee a call next time I want cheesecake."
Scw S.,"DeKalb, GA",0,4,,1.0,9/28/2015,"Worst service ever!  30 min wait for drinks, apps. 1 additional hour wait for food which was cold.  Manager unimpressive with explanation. Been to many of these out of town. Good experiences there. Please hire new management staff for this location."
