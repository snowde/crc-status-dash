Samantha E.,"Cordova, TN",6,1,,2.0,11/6/2015,"The food was really well made but the service was absolutely terrible. It took over an hour for them to seat us. Our poor waitress was completely overwhelmed with all of her tables, it took her at least 15 minutes to bring us our drinks. We recorded our burgers about twenty minutes before we ever had our fries brought to us. When we talked to the manager, he didn't seem to care and stated he was leaving for Texas soon. Overall, the food is not worth such a terrible experience."
Taylor T.,"Cordova, TN",9,4,,2.0,10/2/2015,"I went with My boyfriend on a Friday night at 6:30pm. We waited and didn't get seated until 7:20pm (which was fine being that it's brand new and all.)  They took our order and we waited an hour for our food to arrive. The service was horrible. No one came out to tell us why it took so long to bring us our food, until 5 minutes before Mine was ready. It was just a big waste of time. We didn't leave until 9:00pm. If they had better service , then the money spent would be worth it. Also I got extremly sick after I got home. Save your money. So not worth it."
Rebecca H.,"Memphis, TN",7,1,,3.0,10/16/2015,"Lettuce wraps are out of the world.   Other food is good.  Service needs a great deal of work.  My meal was ice cold, asked to have it reheated.  Waited 30 minutes.  Ridiculous."
Josh B.,"Arlington, TN",5,43,5,5.0,9/2/2015,"New to memphis, the cheesecake factory is delightful place for dates or small gatherings. Food is great and so is the service."
F. W.,"Collierville, TN",39,5,1,1.0,12/12/2015,"The only reason I gave the one star was because of the slice of cheesecake. The wait after my wife and I was seated was over twenty minutes. After we ordered our food it was another twenty minutes before it arrived. I had the chicken alfredo which was cold and the noodles were hard. My wife was less than thrilled with her steak and salmon, but at least it was edible. Our waitress...let me stop here it gets worse. That was our first and last time eating at the Cheesecake Factory."
Lisa S.,"Cordova, TN",0,4,,2.0,6/12/2016,Service was awful both visits. The food is not as appetizing as other Cheesecake Factories and I wonder why. My food is never served hot and piling a bunch of cool food on my plate isn't going to justify for the bad taste and poor service.
Rusty C.,"Collierville, Memphis, TN",0,2,,1.0,5/24/2016,So...sitting at the Cheesecake Factory going on 20 minutes now.  We saw a waiter.  He took our drink order.  Then I think he went home...
Roxanne T.,"Plainfield, CT",10,2,,1.0,3/15/2016,"So sad, this had the potential of being the best place in this area..food is great, mostly. We went for my birthday. It was a Monday at 7:00. No crowd, no waiting to be seated, however they chose a less than desirable location first, so we asked for a ""booth"". Then they tried to put us out in the Mall, we said no thanks, there were plenty of open tables inside. We picked out a small one, (for2, we're not trying to tie up a bigger table than we need), but the ""hostess"" decided to argue with us about it! Unbelievable! Obviously it's the b- team working on Mon! Table was greasy, so we asked that it be cleaned. Our waiter came by but never a ""bus person"", after 10 more minutes we cleaned it ourselves with some lemon juice and a napkin! We had to "" steal"" clean silverware & napkins from another empty table! Waiter was in no hurry to take care of it for us. In fact, other than bringing water he never asked if we needed anything. Once our food was delivered by kitchen staff, waiter did ask if it came out the way we asked. We couldn't tell by looking at it , so he went to kitchen to find out if ingredients we'd asked to skip, were, in fact, left out...they should have told us that when it was brought out! It took a while for him to return with an extra plate we'd asked for, so we just began eating. By this time we just wanted this meal to be over with! Never an apology for the crappy service, never an explanation ( short staffed, whatever!) I think we'll just order "" to-go"" next time. It really isn't worth the trouble! Maybe they don't really want to be a ""nice, expensive sit-down restaurant"". Obviously, they don't know HOW TO TRAIN their staff to an appropriate level of competence! The ""managers"" need to be fired for NOT doing their jobs!"
Cindy Z.,"Cordova, TN",0,14,,3.0,2/22/2016,"I like cheesecake factories a lot, this one is ok maybe because they are so new the kitchen isn't consistent yet. Some days it's better than others. Also service also depends on luck, sometimes you wait forever and other times ur in and out very quickly. I have tried many things on the menu, my favorites are all appetizers. I like the Thai lettuce wrap, calamari is always good too, avocado egg rolls are good and the tuna tatakki salad is good too. I don't care for many things on their gigantic menu, I don't like their fish n chips, chicken dishes, Asian dishes, and I don't care for their burgers or steaks. But again, I have a difficult palette to please. Other people might really love it. I think with such a huge menu it might be hard to keep everything at the same level. I think this is mostly a pasta and appetizer place. Most of their pastas are great. Speaking of cheesecakes, all of them are pretty epic. You would never know they are all frozen cheesecakes shipped from their California facility. So do not freeze any cheese cakes if you buy them cause you'd be freezing them twice. My favorites are the red velvet and Godiva. When I go there I just stick to what I know is and will be good since I've tried so many things already."
Amanda W.,"Collierville, TN",15,191,10,1.0,3/20/2016,"Bad, bad, bad. My daughter and I were out shopping and decided to stop in for a late lunch. They were packed, so we found a seat in the bar area. The waiter took forever just to come and bring us menus and ask for our drink orders. Then it was another long wait for him to bring those back and take our food orders. Once we finally got those out, it was another ridiculous wait when the waiter came to tell me that what I had ordered was no longer available. He asked if I wanted something else. Well, yeah... How about a menu... Another long wait. I asked where my daughter's burger was, and they said they were holding it until my food order was ready. Really?? Seeing as how it had already been 45 minutes, I told them to bring hers out while I looked over the menu again. They finally brought her burger which was, no joke, frozen in the middle. Ugh. So, back it went, with my new order. Another burger arrived, better cooked, but still tepid in the middle. My steak finally came after she was finished, and no joke, cold in the middle. At this point I was done. I asked for a box, because, hell, I can cook it better at home than this place. The manager came over and apologized, which I appreciated. He even comped the meal (which he totally should have after the horrendous experience we had), so I tipped the waiter and left. Will not be back."
Southern W.,"Nashville, TN",2,54,,4.0,1/28/2016,"So I finally stopped by the famous Cheesecake Factory. My curiosity was fueled by the Big Bang Theory as the protagonists often eat there.  The menu is crazy!  It's got practically everything!  If you can't find something to eat, you're not hungry!  I had the bacon burger and it did not disappoint.  It was piled high with bacon and was well cooked and seasoned. Everyone in my party enjoyed their food, but the kid's quesadilla wasn't anything spectacular.  The service was excellent. Our server came by every few minutes to check on us (granted they weren't super slammed).  The only real negative point is the price.  It's pretty expensive.  I don't think we'll go back for a casual dinner.  It's more of a fancy, special place (think anniversary)."
Jason K.,"Collierville, TN",57,281,1,3.0,11/1/2015,"Well, we didn't have any problems with the service. Our server was downright friendly and efficient. Of course, we visited on a slow Tuesday at 5 pm and it was pretty empty...we were seated immediately. In any case, the food was a bit uneven. The special soup of the day, the Mexican Torilla Soup was pretty awful...it was mostly a pile of cold rice, there was hardly any soup, and a scant one strip of tortilla...and it was way too salty. Special indeed. The Fried Calamari was nice, hot, and crispy, but also way too salty. My Chinese Chicken Salad would have been pretty good except the salad included some extremely wilted/decomposed leaves...kind of yucky. My wife had the Chicken Avocado Club which she actually rather enjoyed as I looked on with envy. We weren't big fans of the Red Velvet Cheesecake...next time, we will stick with one of the traditional cheesecakes."
T R.,"Cordova, TN",0,10,2,3.0,1/12/2016,Very strange visit.  Long wait for food.  There was yelling in the kitchen.  I was underwhelmed.
Kelsey T.,"Cordova, Memphis, TN",0,4,,4.0,4/1/2016,LOVE Cheesecake Factory. Food was delicious and our server was great.. Until we watched her get taken away in cuffs. There's a first for everything!
Ken W.,"Memphis, TN",0,4,,1.0,9/15/2015,"After over an hour wait, they brought the food out and it was cold.  I had to wait for over 15min. for my drinks and they didn't bring any water out which I requested.  The service was terrible.  I asked the waiter to take my meal back to the kitchen to warm it up and asked how long it would take because I had been there for over an hour and he couldn't tell anything other than they had been having trouble with kitchen.  A Bad Experience.  I give a one star rating and that being generous."
Rachel S.,"Munford, TN",0,1,,5.0,9/15/2015,I want to start off by saying our server Taylor was amazing! I definitely recommend her! The food took awhile but the restraunt was very busy so I understood. Taylor was very attentive and could carry a conversation well. She made us feel welcome and we will definitely be coming back!
April H.,"Memphis, TN",0,5,2,1.0,9/10/2015,"Daughter convinced me to come back. We started out with a waitress named Taylor.  She spent more time texting than serving.  She then told us she was team teaching. We then spent time with an amazing waiter named Jonathan.  Just awesome! Unfortunately, it didn't help the burnt Tuscan chicken we received. I told my daughter desert only if we come back to this location soon. Disappointed. One of my favorite restaurants... Got to give the m time!"
A D.,"Germantown, TN",0,44,,4.0,6/6/2016,"I was hesitant to try a chain place after I have heard the horror wait times, but we were in the area and had a giftcard so we gave it a try. I was very surprised on almost everything. We called ahead and asked if there was a waiting list (Friday night), and to our surprise there was none. We were quickly seated and ordered our drinks. The place was really busy and pretty loud. After looking over the huge menu, I settled on a Cuban sandwich and the wife got chicken pasta. My Cuban was probably the best Cuban I have ever had, my wife's chicken pasta was plain jane to me. We ordered a slice of the Reeses cheesecake and oh my, talk about rich flavor. It was so sweet as well. Only downfalls were that service was slow once we received our dishes, and that our table was apparently cleared so fast that the silverware was forgotten so we received our food without silverware. Overall I was pleasantly surprised. I probably won't be back anytime soon, but that is because I live 40 minutes away. Overall a A-."
Jennifer W.,"Nashville, TN",0,11,,1.0,2/17/2016,"We went there for Valentines Day. We ate at the bar since it would have been a way longer wait for a table & we don't mind sitting at the bar, we usually do when there is a long wait. We were really looking forward to some cheesecake factory, as it is very far from we live--it was a big deal to drive all the way out there for a special occasion like Valentine's Day. My husband ordered the Chicken Bellagio, and it was missing the prosciutto when it arrived, he let the bartender know right away. I ordered the crispy Chicken Costoletta & it was missing the lemon sauce or had very very little on one corner piece but I didn't let them know as I realized it after the server left and they were so busy at the bar I couldn't get anyones focus. I figured I would let them know when the prosciutto came back. My husband let them know about the prosciutto right away & the bar tender ran back to the kitchen, but nothing was ever done about it. A person a few seats down from us had prosciutto missing on his Bellagio as well. I don't know if they did anything about his either. Food was sucky, and service was dismissive of it. Nobody brought us the prosciutto and we probably paid a few extra bucks on that dish for the prosciutto that we never got. It was very poor service to ignore the problem. A manger never came to address the issue either. We felt like we could have eaten better at home, as our dishes were plain and or dry due to forgotten ingredients. I wouldn't eat at this cheesecake factory location again unless I was just ordering a Cheesecake dessert. The entrees are a rip off as they don't come how they are intended to come out of the kitchen at every other cheesecake location."
Debi M.,"Eads, TN",2,15,,1.0,9/18/2015,"This was my second visit to C.F.  The first visit went fairly smooth, with the exception of the check in desk.  They were really flustered & Laurie was rude!!  I know you guys are still new & working out kinks.  But, the 2nd visit was worse.  Again, the check in kiosk is totally out of control.  There were 6 of us asking for outdoor patio.  It took about 40 mins.  When I arrive at the kiosk ""Laurie"" informs me that it is 2 booths, because you don't have booths for 6!  I asked why we weren't told this on the front end, & she said, ""Because I didn't book you""!  Very unprofessional & the whole purpose of 6 of us was to have lunch together.  Then...our food order took around 50 mins.  We ordered cocktails.  They have gone up from 2 weeks ago!!  Now, it's $12 for a mixed drink & $7.50 for a 16 oz draft beer!!!  That is highway robbery!!  So, your food is not any higher quality than your competition, your hostessing is terrible & your liquor prices are outrageous!!  I'm posting this review else where.  You won't be getting any more of my business till you guys learn how to treat customers & when your prices become reasonable again!!"
