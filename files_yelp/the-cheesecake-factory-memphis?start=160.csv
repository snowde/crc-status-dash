Will C.,"Memphis, TN",0,1,,3.0,9/28/2015,We stopped by the Wolfchase Galleria Mall to eat at the cheesecake factory which is a place that I have never been. Â The wait time was about an hour. the restaurant was extremely clean and nice looking inside.The waitstaff was awesome we had an experienced waitress in a waitress who was apparently being trained. We ordered the Fried macaroni & cheese appetizer. No one at our table really cared for them. I had the Farfalle pasta chicken dish but didn't really care for it either. My wife had a salad and a loaded baked potato tater tot appetizer for her meal.she told me that her salad was OK but she hated the tater   daughter got the kids salmon plate but they brought the wrong signs for her mail however the waitstaff instantly corrected the issue. we ended our meal with a 30th anniversary cheesecake but it wasn't really A hit with us either. The restaurant and the waitresses were awesome that we didn't much care for the food that's why I gave it three stars.
Brandy R.,"Atoka, TN",14,1,,1.0,1/8/2016,"I was told my wait would be 1 hour for a party of 5. We waited an hour and twenty minutes. When we were taken to the table it was a 4 person booth with a chair stuck on the end. That would have been ok but it was in the main isle and my son was constantly tripped over. He was sitting so close to the table to try to prevent being hit, that the people on the ends of the booth had to scoot over to have any leg room at all. It was awful. The waitress came to the table after a good 5 minutes and was just plain rude. We went ahead and ordered our food since we had time to look over the menu and decide beforehand. We thought this would help us get our food a bit faster. We were wrong. It took 45 minutes to get our food. Someone else, not our server, brought our food. The food was not bad, it was just bland. It had no seasoning at all. We ate our entire meal with no drinks. Our server was no where to be found. This dinner was for my daughter's 13th birthday and sadly we could not have been more disgusted with the entire experience at this restaurant."
