Bruna K.,"Memphis, TN",140,166,492,1.0,12/11/2016,"Cheesecake factory has been my favorite restaurant for years. I love it so much that I used to drive out to Nashville and St Louis so I could eat there. They finally opened the one in Memphis but honestly, I don't know what happened. I came here with my dad and our server was all over the place, we didn't have silverware, she got my dad's order wrong, he ordered the alfredo with the crispy chicken and she said that wasn't allowed, my food was really cold and hard. This is super strange to me since out of all these years that I've been going to other locations, this has never happened. Someone from the headquarters should retrain everyone and fix it because everything from the service to the food were terrible. I ordered a $100 gift card a few weeks ago and I'm debating coming back to this location until they fix things."
Huyen T.,"Memphis, TN",9,90,108,3.0,1/20/2016,"I stopped by a couple of weeks after they opened. The crowd was huge, the wait was extremely long, and the experience was okay.  For the meal itself, it was average. I had the tacos, I was surprised at how much asian fusion dishes that were on the menu.  The only thing that was worth coming for were their cheesecake, which were amazing. Would I stop by for food? probably not. I felt that it was a bit overpriced for what you get. Place the place was extremely loud, as I can not hear a thing a friend was saying.  But I will most likely stop by for their cheesecake to go."
Melissa M.,"Trumann, AR",295,260,1801,4.0,11/8/2015,"Sooo happy that we finally have a Cheesecake Factory! Luckily we got in right away, but we sat in the open area exposed to the mall, wasn't too crazy about that. The fried mac and cheese balls were really good! I ordered my usual Louisiana Chicken pasta, it's a spicy dish but it was unusually spicy at the Memphis location. We ordered a red velvet cheesecake and briefly mentioned that we were celebrating my dad's birthday and they decorated the plate and sang happy birthday to him! It was a great time, can't wait to go back."
Lesley M.,"Collierville, TN",28,2,,5.0,4/20/2017,"Came for happy hour, food was amazing and only $5.95 per entree, drinks were also $5.95! Rudy and Michael were excellent bartenders! Great atmosphere for girls night or first date...."
Joy C.,"Memphis, TN",214,96,28,3.0,11/19/2015,"Meh-_.....went straight to the bar, sat at the end. 2 bartenders, and it seems as if they were super busy because we were not acknowledged for at least 5-10 min..so we decided to move to the middle if the bar...waalahhh!!! They do talk!!!!! Anyways, ordered drinks and food.  I ordered a Cosmo and the skinny menu of lemon and garlic shrimp with pasta. Sooooo good!!!! My husband had salmon as usual, he said he has had better! Overall service was OK, food was good not Like other cities. I have been to a few and they are more upscale, but hey they tried!!!"
Kevin H.,"Cordova, TN",0,3,,3.0,10/27/2017,"Every time I come here I say I'll never come again because of the service.  The food is consistently good and the people are friendly, but the host and wait staff are mediocre at best. Today we arrived before 5 pm to avoid the Friday dinner crowd and were seated by a ""new"" host who decided to sit us at a table in a section where the dinner server hadn't arrived yet. Who knows what time the dinner server is supposed to arrive, and frankly, who cares. It's just the latest poor host and wait staff dining experience for my family and I. A very nice server named Jessica greeted us, took our drink orders and said our actual server would be here soon. Drinks and bread came fairly quickly and then we proceeded to wait for almost 20 minutes before Jessica realized our server wasn't here yet.  Almost 40 minutes after we were seated (and 15 minutes after Jessica took our order and said she'd take care of us) our actual server shows up and then I hear her asking Jessica about our table.  Too late. I've eaten at the Atlanta, Nashville and Orlando locations dozens of times and I can't think of a single bad experience, but the Memphis location is a totally different story."
Mark H.,"Jackson, TN",17,63,115,1.0,3/31/2017,"Horrible service. I've eaten at Cheesecake Factories all over the country and this restaurant is the worse. My wife and I love the food here and visit the one in Nashville every time we go but we will never be back to this one. When you go these restaurants, you do so with the knowledge that the food is a little higher but the quality and service makes up for it. Not here. Save the money and hit the food court."
Leon S.,"Madison, MS",0,24,,4.0,8/9/2017,On a Wednesday got right in with no wait. Service was excellent. Food was good except my wife's pasta was underdone. The cheesecake was as good as you would expect. We'll go there again next time we are in the area.
Phil M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",141,244,63,4.0,11/2/2015,"Great cheesecake and coffee.. Well the cheesecake was awesome, the coffee was full of grounds... Not a fan. Service was great! Ambiance was exciting!"
Quita J.,"Cordova, TN",13,87,16,5.0,3/11/2017,"I finally had a chance to stop by since its opening. It was a weekday lunch. No lines. No wait. The only other cheesecake factory Ive been to was in San Diego, CA about 10 years ago. To have one in Memphis was just perfect.  Everything I had at my first visit was just perfect. I went at lunch and had regular size meals. I was caught off guard by the large portion sizes but I wasnt complaining. I finished the rest the next day and will order smaller portions my next visit. The atmosphere was great and of course customer service was great as well. No complaints here. I plan to return again."
Edward H.,"Cordova, TN",210,85,383,5.0,9/2/2015,"The other reviews were spot on!  My wife and I had enjoyed our experience from start to finish.  The waitress we had came by quite frequently, and I don't believe our drinks ever reached the bottom.  In addition, the manager came by a few times in the beginning and asked if there was anything that they could do to accommodate us better.    The food was delicious and came out quickly!  The benefit of having a wait time (40 mins) was that my wife and I got a chance to really look at the menu.  I got the fish n' chips and my wife got a chicken salad.  Both were very tasty!!  The best part was the cheesecake - delicious!!  We each ordered 1 even though we shouldn't have.  We thought of sharing one beforehand, and we will next time.  These cheesecakes that they send out are enormous.  Def could be shared among two people.  Overall, tasty food and good service.  I don't think I could've asked for better!  Highly recommend going at least once if you have never been!"
Chris C.,"Orange, CA",44,77,35,1.0,5/22/2016,Let me start with the fact I love the cheesecake factory  but I will be calling corporate due to this visit. #1. They forgot to put in our order and had to take it twice. #2 There was a pubic hair in my potatoes. #3 The steak that was supposed to be medium was 1 step away from charcoal. I did not eat more than four bites of food and send it back without a replacement. #4 All they comped was the cheesecake my wife got for her birthday which I think should be free anyway. TERRIBLE!!
Mona A.,"Daly City, CA",23,36,49,2.0,3/7/2017,My husband & I waited 15-20 minutes for a waitress to come & the food takes forever to come. They have bad service here & this has happened twice............ oh 2 stars cause the food is good.
Andrea A.,"Memphis, TN",52,46,33,4.0,9/29/2015,"So..is it me or does cf have the hardest bread? I've been to cheesecake factory in Nashville, San Diego and VA Beach. The. Bread. Is. Hard.  Okay anyway, my boyfriend and I decided to try cheesecake factory. It opened a few weeks ago and since it's a new restaurant in memphis it has been super packed. We decided to go on a Tuesday afternoon around 1 hoping everyone would be at work. Nope. It was still alot of people there. We walked up worried about how long the wait would be. The hostess let us know they had two open tables if we wanted to sit by the bar, we obliged.  We sat down and our waiter Adam came pretty quickly.  The Breakdown  Environment - it resembled pretty much every cheesecake factory. Super nice inside. However this one is a little smaller than most cheese cake factories so it feels a little crowded. Service- our waiter was great. He was efficent but not annoying. Which means that he took our orders, checked in on us, kept our drinks filled but wasn't lingering around with annoying stranger convo.  FOOD- we had fried zuchinni as our appetizer and it was super yummy!! I ordered the cajun chicken Littles which is essentially chicken fingers, mashed potatoes and corn succotash. My boyfriend got southern fried catfish which came with mashed potatoes, green beans and corn. My food was food, the chicken fried well..right amount of breading and not all breading with no chicken, loved the corn succotash. The mashed potatoes were okay, just not hot like the rest of the dish.. a little weird.   My boyfriend liked his fish, seasoned well, the green beans had no seasoning so he didn't really enjoy those.  We ended the meal with a shared slice of salted caramel cheesecake. It was the highlight of the meal. So good!! Please try it lol All in all it was a nice experience and the food was good. I'd come back!"
Susan A.,"CORDOVA, TN",8,22,16,4.0,9/4/2015,"Lovely experience except for the wait time. We thought going after 1:00 would be less of a crowd. Waited longer to check in than we waited to be seated. Checked in at 1:59 and were seated at 2:15, very nice surprise considering how busy they were.  Waited for service, waited for drinks, waited for dressing for my salad, waited for a to go box. My husband was done eating before I started on mine. We asked for our cheesecake to go and waited for that. We had to ask for our check. I had the; SKINNYLICIOUS® FACTORY CHOPPED SALAD A Delicious Blend of Julienne Romaine, Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Bacon. Blue Cheese and Apple with Our Vinaigrette. My salad was delightful, fresh, chopped up in bite size pieces.  My husband had the SKINNYLICIOUS burger. He said it was good. It came with a nice side salad.  I know this is their first week, but I think we will reserve this restaurant for special occasions and certainly wait a few months for the novelty to wear off before attempting to go back. Make sure you have plenty of time for the wait. The food was worth it."
David E.,"Memphis, TN",28,232,45,4.0,11/1/2015,"I had not been to ""The Cheesecake Factory"" before - but have wanted to try out the cheesecake. (Oh, Penny was NOT working that night - BBT). Boy, was I not disappointed with the Cheesecake. First, as you know, there are 33 different flavors. Trying to decide which was not easy - I narrowed it down to about 7. I went with the Godiva Cheesecake. Wow! Smooth, silky, succulent - dare I say, indulgent? One problem - I had to eat my dinner first.  Although we did have a large group and had to wait awhile to be seated, it was crowded and our server managed to get everyone taken care of and kept our glasses filled. There were many good choices of ""real food"" as well, but I went with the Chicken Pasta for my first visit. Although my pasta was not thoroughly cooked and there was little chicken in the dish, it really wasn't bad. The rest of the group enjoyed their meals. I do want to come back to try the Crispy Cuban Rolls, Fried Mac and Cheese, Chicken Bellagio, Louisianna Chicken Pasta, and others. ""Mmmm"". But, I digress. The Godiva Cheesecake was a great first choice! I will have to return to try out the 30th Anniversary, Reese's Peanut Butter, Tiramisu, Chocolate Tuxedo, Kahlua Cocca Coffee Cheesecake, Hershey's Chocolate Bar and so many more. Did I mention, ""Mmmm"" already? You know I will be back!"
Tom G.,"Atoka, TN",27,215,267,3.0,11/1/2015,"Stopped in for a HH recently. I heard it was almost impossible to get in, but, at 5:30sh on a weekday, no problem. Sat at the bar. Ordered a well drink - bourbon & 7. It was not too good. Not sure if the mix was flat, diet, but did not taste right. I ordered the crab wontons which came out quickly. They were perfectly cooked, about 10-12 of them. But, honestly, the cream cheese wontons we get at our local little Chinese restaurant were better than these. They looked good, and were cooked perfect, just lacking some flavor somehow. Had a draft to finish the HH. PS, Cheesecake Factory, thanks much for you HH menu offerings. But, ID what drafts are included please so we (others I saw also asked) which drafts were part of the HH. On the way out, I bought a Reese's Peanut Butter cheesecake slice to bring home. I will say, this was the most amazing desert I have ever had, EVER.  I look forward to my next visit to explore more options. I think the HH menu and prices are the time to visit."
Kasey H.,"Jackson, TN",17,5,3,4.0,1/31/2017,I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a couple of times now and I have always had a great time eating here. Food is good and the Cheesecake is AWESOME! Will be coming back for sure!
Regina C.,"Cordova, TN",40,142,69,4.0,1/11/2016,"Went by on a Saturday afternoon. There were tons of people waiting but we were told it would be about a 15 min wait. But the wait time was about right. I have been to many other Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and this one was right in line with decor of the other ones. Maybe its a tad bit smaller than other ones however. The food is still as good and the portions are still huge. My mother ordered a burrito and could not get through half of it. It was almost larger than the plate. We also tried the eggroll sampler and thought it was very good. Service was good, just a tad bit slow. But overall, my anticipation of this place was right. The menu is massive and there is no reason you should eat the same thing twice (unless it is just that outstanding). This place will be in monthly rotation."
Robbie L.,"Memphis, TN",46,2,,1.0,3/17/2017,Just horrible service and a wait for no reason.  The food isn't even worth it. I've been waiting for  25 minutes to place my order. This place is horrible. Bad location for Cheesecake Factory. Should have put it in Collierville.
