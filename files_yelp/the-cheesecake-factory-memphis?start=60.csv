John C.,"Nesbit, MS",5,4,,5.0,3/13/2017,We had a great Sunday afternoon lunch here-BUT stupidly left our credit card on the table. Got home hours later and realized the mistake-called manager Tony and was told that they had the card. Thank you Brittany T for being honest and thank you Cheesecake factory for a happy ending. We'll be back for sure!
Tyler M.,"Memphis, TN",0,4,,1.0,3/7/2017,Took our daughter there for brownie and ice cream. the ice cream is melted we asked three different servers for spoons no one brought any and then when we brought it up to our regular waitress who finally showed up 10 min later she said it's not her fault normally they set the tables no one fixed it so then we left with a cryingthree-year-old who got no ice cream because all the restaurants ice cream had melted. We just went there for dessert God help anyone that goes there for a full meal
Jack I.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",6,5,1,2.0,12/29/2016,Great menu! The execution suffers as this restaurant is in Memphis. Service is never predictable or reliable. Be sure to wear Kevlar as this restaurant is located in Hoodchase Mall.
Claire P.,"Oxford, MS",0,4,,1.0,3/15/2016,"I'm not one to typically leave negative reviews on Yelp. However, my experience on Saturday was noteworthy, and I feel like people need to know what they are about to spend a pretty penny on.  I was at lunch with my mother in law and sister in law celebrating the soon-to-be addition to our family. For those of you who can't read between the lines, I'm 9 months pregnant and about to pop. Our waiter was more than pleasant, and the meal started out well. Appetizer (avocado eggrolls) was okay, but a little on the cold side.  Next, our lunches were brought out. During the course of my Cobb Salad, I found 2 gnats. Again, like I said, I'm not typically one to complain. So, I picked those bad boys out, squashed 'em, and kept on feeding baby and me.  Here's the juicy part of the story. I look down at my next bite, which turns out to be a hunk of chicken that is so pink it's practically bleeding still. I laughed (which I do when I've reached an extreme point of aggravation), called over to the nearest waitress and asked her to go get the manager immediately. Approximately 8 minutes later, our waiter approached the table and asked if we needed refills... No. I don't need a refill, I needed your manager 10 minutes ago. Go get him/her, please.   Almost 15 minutes after my initial complaint, the manager comes up to our table, and offers to ""take care of us"". He took my plate with the still squawking chicken and my napkin full of gnat guts back to the kitchen, allegedly. Never offered to replace my meal, never came back to the table and simply wrote my meal off and offered us a slice of cheesecake for free. I'm sorry, but I don't want your stupid cheesecake. I want your job because you're incompetent. I'm spending well over 100 dollars in your establishment on a lunch table, your kitchen served me RAW MEAT, and all you want to give me is 15 bucks off of my bill? Interesting, thank you.  Cheesecake Factory has forever lost a customer here in Memphis."
J Penelope S.,"Memphis, TN",69,113,178,3.0,11/23/2015,I'm giving it a three because I don't know how to rate in half stars and two stars would be unfair. I ordered the firecracker salmon and a house salad and a pork chop dinner (to go). None of these items where rich in flavor (which is a polite way of saying it was bland) even the ranch dressing was disappointing. I'm going to chalk it up to they are still new. Cheesecake factory has a really large menu and I do understand that recipes take a while to perfect. The waitress mentioned they had 300 employees. If that is the case perhaps the chef that prepared my meals hadn't fix them enough to get it right. I'm actually a big fan of the chain. I've been known to drive to Nashville just to fine there so I'm holding out hope the food will improve. I'm going to wait about six months and go again and hopefully I can give them some more stars.
Mike G.,"Cordova, TN",0,3,,1.0,2/4/2017,"So, while I usually save a meal here for a special occasion (due to the high menu prices), I did take advantage of the Christmas gift card promotion, where you receive a free dessert card with every $25 GC purchase.  I was soooo dissappointed just now, when I went to pick up my free cheesecake, only to find that Cheesecake Factory has decided to reduce the size of their slices. I wanted the Tiramisu but it was almost half the size it used to be. Then, when I decided to look for the tall 6 layer cake instead, I see that they have shrunk to 2/3 the height of what they were. When I mentioned the smaller slice size to the cashier, she just nodded in agreement, but had no response. Hopefully this downsizing is a management decision at this Memphis location only.  Needless to say, the price of the cheesecake is still $8.69, while the cake is $9.29, so the prices have not gone down! I don't think I will be back anytime soon, given that I can buy a whole cheesecake at the store for less than $30."
Ashley F.,"Memphis, TN",72,5,8,5.0,9/11/2015,"Awesome, Awesomeness, and Awesomely delicious....  The service was great, staff was awesome, and the FOOD WAS RIDICULOUSLY GOOD!!!!!  Our server Mikki, was awesome and attentive.... Our time there was simply amazing....  Try the Vietnam spring rolls, New Orleans Cajun pasta, Chicken enchiladas, and the Salted Caramel Cheesecake... Will definitely be going back!!!"
Ric F.,"Cordova, TN",13,16,48,2.0,2/20/2016,"Amazing decor. Clean accommodations but that isn't much of a compliment considering this location is less than 6 months old. A staff that is not properly trained. Unfortunately, in a corporate atmosphere, that's usually one thing you can depend on. The knowledge and personality of our server was severely lacking. Huge menu selection... too huge. Maybe if they focused on a few great things rather than trying to be everything for everybody, they might be better. The cheesecake selection is out of this world. Kudos.  Slim down the menu and be great at everything you offer. Train your service staff to be knowledgable of your products and the art of proper service. You can't teach manners and personality. I strongly suggest you implement looking for these qualities during your hiring process.  The Cheesecake Factory has such potential. My wife and I were anticipating your opening date, however, we hope our next visit is much better."
Tina T.,"Memphis, TN",2,35,38,1.0,1/29/2016,"Save yourself some time and a whole lot of money, and just go somewhere else.  Our waitress was rude, inconsistent, screwed up a very basic order, turned out to be condescending, and in the end mixed up our to go boxes (which was fine with me since my food made me sick for 2 days and I threw it away before walking in the house). Anyway, my LUNCH was $30. That is OUTRAGEOUS in my opinion, considering I had a lunch portion of pasta, a slice of cheesecake, and a cup of hot tea. The pasta was bland, cold, and not good at all. I ate less than a quarter of my meal. The cheesecake was okay, but just that, okay (and still quite a bit frozen!). The hot tea would've been good if the water wasn't lukewarm but actually hot. Oh, well, the ice water with lemon was delicious, would've been nice to get a refill at least once.  Honestly, it may have been the worst meal and overall dining experience I've had in years. I'm not even exaggerating. Needless to say I will stick to East Memphis local joints and avoid this chain crap. Dine at your own risk."
Chelsey C.,"Memphis, TN",0,1,,1.0,5/11/2017,"They have fruit flies ALL OVER the restaurant. They're all over the glass, all over the tables. It's disgusting. We moved from one table to get away from them and they were at the next table. The service is extremely slow and the food isn't nearly as good as the one in Nashville. I've currently been waiting almost an hour for my food, and it's not busy right now. They need to totally revamp their cleaning procedures. They also need to revamp manager response to complaints."
Chris J.,"Memphis, TN",122,134,38,5.0,11/20/2016,"What can you say about The Cheesecake Factory, but the fact that it is The Cheesecake Factory so you know its going to be good!  Everything about this place is good from the time that you walk in and enjoy the décor, to the friendly staff, to the entrees and of course the cheesecake.  The only criticism that is not really a criticism is that there is so much on the menu that it takes a while to figure out what you really want because everything sounds tasty.  Everyone needs to try The Cheesecake Factory at least once, and of course save room for the cheesecake.  The last time I went, I tried the Banana Cream Cheesecake!  I think my favorite entrée of all time is their Chicken Madeira.  The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp is also very good."
Justin S.,"Memphis, TN",110,113,463,5.0,1/9/2016,"Finally was able to check out the Cheesecake Factory and it lives up to the hype. Wait time was around 30 minutes, which wasn't bad for a Saturday night. My girl got the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce. She loved loved it. I got the pasta da vinci. I will be the first to say that I usually hate pasta but this stuff really had a wang to it that made me like it. The portion sizes are huge too. Last but not least we had to try some cheesecake. Now my girl can make some pretty good cheesecake so this place had some major shoes to fill. I got the 30th anniversary chocolate cake cheesecake. Mind=blown. One of the best cheesecakes I've ever ate. My girl got the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake. She said it was almost as good as the ones she makes. All in all, one of my new favorite spots to eat."
Mary S.,"Arlington, TN",14,7,,1.0,6/20/2017,Great server! Poor customer service. When a server turns in an order for a dessert they should be advised quickly if the dessert is not available! Don't make a customer wait 15 to 20 minutes just to find out that they can't get their order and then serve the other person with them. This is the second time it's happened here and not sure there will be a third chance. Only came for coffee and dessert
Beautiful D.,"Cordova, TN",4,39,,3.0,9/10/2016,"I've gone twice for lunch when there is no wait however the service is still slow. The servers I've had are very pleasant and the food is good. I gave it three stars because of the slow service, but I'd definitely return. The cheesecake is awesome!!!!!!"
Nicole M.,"Cordova, TN",0,6,,3.0,6/17/2017,"Not the BEST CF I've ever been to, but also definitely not anywhere near the worst. Have had some trouble receiving correct orders (the waiter had it right, so I assume some wires got crossed in the kitchen) and another person in my group got a rather low-quality burger once, but other than that it's been relatively solid. Just expect to wait awhile for food during busy hours (standard procedure for any CF, really). Definitely worth visiting if you've yet to experience a CF or are in town with a craving."
Deborah D.,"Cordova/Appling, TN",26,72,,5.0,1/27/2016,"I finally got a chance to try our newest restaurant and it was great.  Luckily, I got in before the dinner rush and it only took 20 minutes from walking in the door until I had my food!   My server, Michael, was very pleasant and attentive.  In fact, he apologized for the delay as he thought my food looked too well done the first time.  My crab cakes were cooked perfectly and I had a side order of fried zucchini to top it off. All the servers I observed were busy and helpful as the dinner crowd started coming in.  I am glad to say this is a great addition to Cordova and I will be back many times in the future."
N N.,"Somerville, TN",0,36,2,1.0,1/27/2016,"Yummy!  I must admit that the choice to come here was out of curiosity to see what this new location was like. (Low expectations.) I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. It was everything described and really yummy. Hit the Asian spot, the Caribbean thing and my love for coconut. Best of all the shrimp had no annoying little tails!  In my group someone had a sandwich with really good fries. The nachos was a hit. Most important the Mojitos were exemplary! Update - recently I made a return visit to this Cheesecake Factory and was disappointed. A party of four we were seated quickly and began perusing the enormous menu. It takes a few minutes to figure out given the number of options available. After fifteen minutes with no one coming to the table to say hello or offer water even we left. Whatever they had done right is now wiped out."
Karol H.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,,4.0,5/25/2016,"The restaurant's interior is beautiful. The atmosphere of the decor and staff give off a elegant, yet homey feeling.  The staff was very polite, as well as our waitress. She was really fun and sweet. Even though it was busy, she checked up on us multiple times. The food was very good. We really enjoyed the Fried Macaroni Ball and the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake. We really recommend everyone getting the macaroni ball. It's a must try! The reason for the four stars is that the taco came out flake and a bit unappetizing. It worked out because I ate the rest out with a fork and it was delicious."
Melanie S.,"Memphis, TN",0,6,1,5.0,11/21/2016,My only complaint - too much to choose from!  We waited forever - because our pager was broken. But the staff was great. The food was delicious.  The price okay.  ;)
Terri O.,"Memphis, TN",9,8,18,4.0,2/18/2016,"I've been here several times the past month. The service has always been friendly and top notch. Someone has always checked on me, since I tend to dine alone, to make sure my glass is filled and if I need anything. The first time I visited was during weekend brunch so service took a little while, which is fully understandable, I got the stuffed mushrooms, cajun chicken pasta, and tiramisu.  Any complaints I had were promptly fixed.  The second and third time were both their soup and salad.  The cream of corn and loaded potato were amazing. Ask for Chris, Kira, or Cameron they are awesome!"
