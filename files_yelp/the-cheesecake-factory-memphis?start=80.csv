Bob B.,"Southaven, MS",43,53,26,5.0,4/17/2016,"First time here and very impressed with our experience. They promised us a 20-minute wait on a Saturday evening and got us inside in 10. Our server kept us supplied with water and bread as we waited. My wife had chicken Madeira and she enjoyed it. I had culotte steak done medium well and it was very tasty, one of the better steaks I have had. And the cheesecake we had was delicious, cheesecake we enjoyed when we got home. Overall a delicious visit and we will definitely be coming back."
Rodney G.,"Memphis, TN",1,18,,2.0,3/12/2017,"I got the Cheesecake Factory to go and it was ready super fast for a crowded Saturday night. The food however was pretty sloppy and average. I got the bistro shrimp something I always get and was very disappointed pasta had no flavor and hardly no sauce, then I only had 5 shrimp Wtf!!!"
Rob T.,"Atoka, TN",45,31,,3.0,12/22/2015,"Not overly impressed! What was supposed to be a 30 minute estimated wait, ended up being closer to 45 minutes - which honestly is not that big of a deal. I give the restaurant 3 stars because they definitely need to step up their customer service experience. It was like it was a chore for the waitress to do her job, like we were a burden being in her restaurant. That was how I felt. I won't grade the food, because all I had was a piece of cheesecake and coffee. The cheesecake was good, not great, certainly not something to write home about, but it was decent. The atmosphere was very nice, a very clean restaurant (which it should be - it is brand new). Their menu is very cluttered and offers way to much. Perhaps they need to break it down better and get rid of certain things. Perhaps a little overbearing! But I would easily give this restaurant 4 stars if the customer service were better. I will give it a try again, after the holidays."
Rhonda P.,"Cordova, TN",50,114,168,3.0,1/12/2016,"After watching and waiting for the new to wear off, I finally tried this place.  Love the decor, especially since it's in the mall.  The menu is huge, maybe a little too big. There is SO MUCH to choose from.   Don't let the prices scare you, the portions are huge.  You'll have enough 2 meals.  Of course, it's all about the cheesecake and its awesome.    More than two pages of dessert to choose from.   A great addition to the lackluster Wolfchase Mall food selection."
Jess P.,"Whitehaven, Memphis, TN",104,4,,4.0,3/27/2017,Loved it. The service was great food was good. And the drinks ... perfect!!! They only down side was the silver wear was sitting on the table with no napkins under it
Pedro A.,"Memphis, TN",24,78,34,4.0,11/5/2015,"Went here during the first few weeks with some coworkers. Service was alright but could improve, and going during busy times is always a big risk if you have plans for later. The food was generally very good and came in cool presentations. I had the salmon with mashed potatoes and other than the potatoes being slightly cold, everything was great. The cheesecakes are to die for. I bought the Oreo Dream to take home and it was a hit among everybody who tried it. My issue with TCF are the prices. The food is good, but not AMAZING and not in portions big enough to warrant such prices. Our table ordered 4 entrees, 1 appetizer, a couple of small soups, and 2 slices of cheesecake, and the bill was $130 plus tip, a very prohibitive price if you go with a family."
DeAnne G.,"Memphis, TN",3,3,,1.0,9/16/2016,"Table was had sticky caked on ketchup on it, and staff was extremely rude.   Extremely.  And that was the manager. Horrible. Will never return. Oh... And would not refill tea."
Melissa F.,"Orlando, FL",22,95,136,3.0,9/10/2015,"I've been to different Cheesecake factories and I even served Corporate and the president at my job a few weeks ago, so I had high hopes for this location. My boyfriend and I were pretty optimistic after hearing bad reviews from coworkers.  The wait time was quoted only 15 minutes (but ended up being about 30) so we decided to grab drinks from the bar while we wait. We waited there and were never acknowledged, so we decided to wait at the lobby again. They looked weeded from making drinks for the pub/service well. We were being buzzed shortly after so we went to our table.  Our server (assistant we soon learned) greeted us with a smile and began pouring out the specials of the evening.. Before getting our drink orders.. So I didn't really pay any attention to her introduction, I just wanted a water and something with liquor. I ordered a strawberry martini and my boyfriend ordered Sam Adams beer on draft. We tried the fried macaroni cheese bites. They were surprisingly  delicious! We waited a while for the drinks to come to the table, they came right before our food came out. I ordered the ribeye and wanted it with a baked potato instead. She kept saying they had potatoes or half potatoes, but not baked potatoes.. I was confused so I said spinach instead. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Madeira.  We are both in the service industry so we noticed a lot of things.. Like 1.) lack of silent service. I shouldn't be asked if I want more water, when my food hasn't even made it to the table yet. It's just common sense. 2.) Servers not knowing their table numbers. We had people auctioning our food at other tables and coming back to us asking if it was ours, even the server delivering our drinks from the bar needed my thumbs up to sit it at our table. I normally don't mind, but if I'm spending at least 60$ on myself, I would like to know my servers are trained accordingly. I sat there for awhile waiting on my spinach and a knife to cut my steak with. 3) Lack of management involvement. My boyfriends' chicken was undercooked, so we waited and waited for the recook. Our sever asked if he wanted it to go since I would probably be done with my food.. If we wanted it TO GO, we would have went through TO GO. He even mentioned how the manager would come to the table and we never saw a manager. We never even noticed managers going to tables and checking on anyone. We DID notice managers standing around, doing nothing. We didn't ask for our server to take care of our food, but our server made us think they took off the chicken because of the inconvenience. He worded the whole "" We took care of the chicken Madeira for you both"" wrong. They took care of the re-ring for the cook up, not our meal. He shouldn't have said they took care of anything, I know what a comp is for a recook. I would be more understanding if our server was busy, but he only had us and one other table in a 3 table section. I was just happy to get my check.  The experience was definitely not a pleasant one. It was definitely the first and last time in Memphis. Maybe in 6 months they'll work out all the problems and train the staff better, the staff all had good, positive attitudes."
Ramona P.,"Memphis, TN",702,181,1034,5.0,8/29/2015,"Definitely exceeded my expectations! I have had Cheesecake Factory in other cities and was very excited to hear we (Memphis) was getting our very own! My coworker has her own blog and was invited to do a tasting. Luckily, she invited me as well! The staff was amazing...very friendly. Mikki was our server and she did a marvelous job at explaining the menu, and making suggestions. It was extremely crowded but you would've never known due to the fast service!! For the appetizer, we ordered the Vietnamese egg rolls..excellent choice to get the meal started. I had the chicken enchiladas for my entree and it was very tasty! My choice for beverage was the Georgia Peach...it tastes just like a peach! It's an alcohol beverage...not for the kiddies! Dessert!!!! Awww...the best thing ever... We got a chance to try their new flavor...salted carmel cheesecake...to die for!!! If you want outstanding service and good food this is the place to try!"
Gina L.,"Somerville, TN",73,40,15,4.0,11/1/2015,I went to check out The Cheesecake Factory today.   It was very busy which was encouraging.   The decor was nice and sitting inside the dining room I felt under dressed in my jeans and t-shirt even though it is inside the mall.  It was very clean inside even with how busy it was.  I did have to ask for a clean knife because the one I had looked dirty.  I wasn't terribly hungry so I only ordered an appetizer.    The sweet tea was perfect.   Having grown up drinking sweet tea I am very picky.  You don't want it sugar shock but you also don't want it to taste like unsweetened tea.  I ordered the crab and artichoke dip.  I had to wait a little while for it but they were very busy.  When I received it it was delicious.   It was light and flavorful.   I could taste the crab and artichoke which was pleasing because some places add too much of other things that over power these delicious ingredients.   The people next to me complimented me on my daughter and we began a short conversation.   The lady had some asian wraps that looked amazing and her husband has a mushroom burger that made my eyes bulge.  It was huge. I will definitely have to go back to try the items they ordered and possibly some other items off the menu. My review would have been 5 stars if my silverware had been clean and service had been a little faster but I didn't take but a tiny bit off for that because they were packed.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.
Larry S.,"Arlington, TN",0,6,,4.0,11/9/2015,"Great all around..!! Extensive menu,generous portions,friendly efficient staff,excellent service & food..!!   Only complaint is the appetizers/cheesecake are a bit pricey but still very tasty !!"
Jennifer C.,"Memphis, TN",9,35,15,4.0,10/22/2015,"I've noticed lots of complaints about the service at this location.  I didn't have this problem at all.  Granted, my date and I hit this spot up around 11pm after a wedding because we needed to soak up the adult beverages in our system and wanted something a little classier than the Waffle House.  Obviously we had no wait.  Our server was great.  The only complaint is that they were unable to sell anything containing turkey because the freezer was broken and turkey wasn't back in stock.  I found it odd that a freezer had already broken in this brand new location, but whatevs. The menus are a little overwhelming, and I knew what to expect as I had eaten at a Cheesecake Factory before.  There are just SO MANY things to choose from. We both ordered sandwiches.  I had the Cuban with fries.  The fries were hot and cooked perfectly.  Believe me, you can really mess up fries, but these were delicious.  The Cuban was pretty tasty for a chain restaurant.  The serving was large and I left with half of the sandwich in a to-go container.   Of course, I took a slice of cheesecake to go:  chocolate chip cookie dough.  Pretty delicious.  I shared it with a friend for breakfast the next morning and she agreed that it was tasty."
Marcus J.,"Memphis, TN",62,51,67,3.0,11/26/2015,"It's typical chain restaurant food, only at a higher price. You can get the same dishes at different chains at a lower cost and shorter wait time. The staff was friendly and the cheesecake menu has a lot of variety and they are all quite good. Go for the cheesecake. Also, note that it is EXTREMELY loud in this location."
Eva B.,"Memphis, TN",70,15,4,3.0,8/13/2016,Ordered 3 slices of cheesecake to go. Shouldn't take 30 minutes to put some cake in a box. Need to get a better system. Hopefully it's worth the wait.
Jennifer C.,"CORDOVA, TN",25,5,,3.0,11/14/2015,The food? Wonderful. Awesome. Amazing. Worth every penny (and prepare to spend a lot of pennies).  The service? Gross. Lackluster.
Schneidogg ..,"Memphis, TN",0,61,7,5.0,10/5/2015,My wife and I ate in this time around at this location (rather than picking up a to-go order the previous time).  The wait was spot on for 2 people (70 minutes when they told us 55-75 minutes).  The food was great again; the ambiance was good; there was a wait for the cheesecake we ordered (which sounded strange).  We are absolutely going again.   For groups larger than 2 people at dinner you can expect 2-3 hour wait easily.  it's a small version of their restaurant.
Andrea V.,"Memphis, TN",1,26,8,2.0,3/20/2016,Service took forever. Had to send back my daughters order and still couldn't manage to bring it without tomatoes. Won't be going back soon. But my daughter did like the cheesecake
Gina N.,"Cordova, TN",0,11,,4.0,2/11/2017,"The Cheesecake factory has a book filled with different types of dishes. They have excellent mixed drinks too. The atmosphere is loud at times, but the service is usually great. The food is delicious. They have so many different types of Cheesecake, and a few cakes. I like Cumberland, and Perimeter locations."
Lillie S.,"Raymond, MS",0,1,1,5.0,7/11/2016,"Amazing drinks, amazing food, and amazing service! Wait time was a less than 15 minutes and hostess was amazingly pleasant . What more can I say!"
Mark D.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",23,5,1,2.0,12/20/2016,"My best friend wanted to take me out for my birthday. She wanted it to be a special visit to show appreciation for me. Haven eaten at another Cheesecake Factory we decided to give the one in Memphis a try. First our server seem to be inexperienced or new so service was a little slow to start, then he was sat a nine person table right next to us. He took our order, then came back because they were out of one of the entrees we ordered. I ordered a salad with no olives and an entree. About 30 minutes later our entrees were delivered then my salad came after the entrees arrived...with olives (lots of them). Finally we call manager over and told her situation, even told her we were there for my birthday. She asked if we wanted a different server....at this point only thing left was dessert to order ...we said no (giving server every chance). Another server came and checked on us even discussed my birthday (how they were gonna embarrass me). We ordered dessert (cheesecake go figure). Our server brought us the check before our desserts were delivered, ran the credit card still before desserts arrived. Then brought our desserts over and dropped them off. My best friend started to cry...this build up to special night and you drop off our desserts and don't say (or sing happy birthday) Now the night is ruined and we are both stunned. I am half way through eating my dessert when server asked my name... with a group of servers to sing happy birthday...I was almost done eating....seemed they missed the moment. Missed the whole concept of ""Special Night"". The food was good (except salad) but I can find that type a food in plenty of other restaurants. My recommendation is NOT to go here if your celebrating anything that is important to you or your party!"
