I enjoy the  ... great view of the mall & warm heaters (for winter). I got the Thai coconut chicken last night, it was incredible! My hubby loves the orange chicken!

Jennifer S.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,17,8,4.0,4/13/2015,"This was my first time at the Cheesecake Factory, and I really enjoyed it. The environment was classy, and the waitress who waited on me was very nice. There is  , but I thought the inside was just as good. Finally got to try a prickly pear margarita, which I had been wanting to try for a long time. They have a lot of good options for both food and beverages. The choose your own omelette I ordered was nice and fluffy. Would like to return in the future."
