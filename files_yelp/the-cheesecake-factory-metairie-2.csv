Jasmine H.,"New Orleans, LA",32,39,47,5.0,12/31/2017,"Don't know why there are so many bad reviews! This restaurant is amazing. The atmosphere of this location is very intimate and welcoming. The restaurant is spotless; from dining area to the restrooms. The waiters are always so polite. Now the food... the food is amazing. I've had the steak Diane, spicy chipotle chicken pasta, farfalle with chicken, Louisiana chicken pasta, crab dip, avocado eggs rolls(my favorite), stuffed mushrooms, and a variety of cheese cakes (not all in one go LOL). Everything I have had was amazing and cooked to perfection. Let's not forget the complimentary wheat bread... oh, I could just to eat that all day.  Overall I think this restaurant is a great and I will continue to eat here and recommend others to do the same!"
Todd B.,"Covington, LA",20,21,,2.0,12/29/2017,1) At 5:30pm men's room was already dirty. 2) Service is ridiculously slow. 3) Need a flashlight to see my party across the table. 4) you have to park in BFE because the restaurant was built using a 1/4 of the existing parking lot that was already too small to start with. 5) $11.50 for a mixed drink. 6) too many other really good restaurants to waste your time and money at this place.
Michael B.,"Ocean Springs, MS",10,13,4,4.0,12/21/2017,"Really good sit-down lunch spot while out shopping. Arrived at 11am on a Thursday so there was no wait at all and we were seated immediately. Lunch specials, on menu page 8, were diverse, fairly priced for the amount of food, and tasted great. Finished everything with a piece of peppermint bark cheesecake (split 3 ways) which was fabulous."
Kate D.,"Kenner, LA",228,185,2653,2.0,12/26/2017,"I've been to this location a few times, and it's ok.  That's all it is though, just ok. I normally try to avoid this location because it's attached to the mall and it's always busy.  The food itself is just way to rich and over the top. Sometimes that's just what you're looking for and that's fine, but mostly that is what keeps me away. They do have a lighter fare menu, and I still find it to be too rich.  My biggest complaint about this location is that everything takes forever. If you want to eat here make sure you have time to spare because you will be here a while no matter what you decide to order. I've never had anything bad to eat here, but I have noticed that the food itself will be luke warm and the plate it's on is scalding hot. I don't understand that at all. Anyway, it's never going to be my first choice to eat here. There are just so many better options, but once in a while I do stop in and waste some time and calories. It's worth it once in a while."
Michelle B.,"Fairgrounds, New Orleans, LA",81,330,6800,5.0,11/7/2017,"So normally I would give this place 4 stars but the service from Alex and Mary plus the food (definitely get the Pasta Napoletana and the Pasta with sausage and shrimp, and of course the Godiva chocolate cheesecake!) pushes it over to 5 stars! I remember when this joint first opened and it was packed! Hehe we're slow in getting things in Louisiana and Cheesecake Factory is no exception! I have very fond memories of going to the Cheesecake Factory in the Hancock Building when I lived in Chicago. I don't even remember what I ate but knew it was always good, the menu was ridiculously long and the Godiva chocolate cheesecake was divine! So for this visit one of my best friends and his friend and I enjoyed a relatively quiet Monday night. We didn't have to wait which was fantastic. I didn't even realize how huge this place is with two huge areas for outdoor seating. This is fantastic for down here bc patio seating is life! I definitely recommend asking for Alex as your waiter. He had great recommendations, refilled drinks before they were even empty and was attentive! And Mary was very kind in checking on us too asking how everything was! As for food I really enjoyed the Pasta Napoletana which Alex described as a dish trying to be a pizza. And if you're like me you're pouring the grated fresh Parmesan on top of it! And hey, my bestie didn't use all of his Parmesan cheese so I got the other half of his too' hehe can you tell I love my cheese?  I would also try a regular on the menu which is the Pasta with sausage and shrimp. Normally I don't like spicy things but this dish has the right amount of kick to it!  And of course we came here for the cheesecake but were so full we took it to go. My personal favorite is the Godiva chocolate cheesecake but my friend's white chocolate macadamia nut caramel and salted caramel one looked amazing! They also have a bar and a large circular table at the end! This would be great for large groups! Happy cheesecake eating!"
Yeashan R.,"New Orleans, LA",159,104,420,2.0,11/5/2017,"Idk why we do this to ourselves. I made the joke of saying let's go to Cheesecake Factory. I'm guessing because we spent like $100 the morning before we were being economical. But tid was a mistake.  We both ordered from the brunch menu. I had Green Chilaquiles with carnitas and eggs, pork version. My partner had the Fried chicken & Waffles  Benedict. In both orders the eggs were ... I mean I don't mind a soft scramble but this was gross mush. For the chicken and waffles my partner asked for scrambled eggs on the side. They put the wet mushy eggs like yellow stuff on top of the waffle. The syrup taste like butter. The chicken batter was nothing. Like not seasoned. Just bland.  Green Chilaquiles with carnitas and egg. I'm not trying to be gross but as I tried to eat it, it started to look like a thrown up omelette. It was like omelette soup. It also lacked flavor. And structure and I asked to the sever to take it away because it made me want to throw up. And I'm sure if I had it's look just as it was presented to me.  The two stars are for the host and wait staff. They were cool."
Lisa S.,"New Orleans, LA",112,74,216,4.0,10/31/2017,We love coming to Cheesecake Factory during happy hour. Happy hour runs from 4-6.  You can get drink specials and many food items. All food items are 5.95 and regular size portions. They don't cut the size of the appetizers just because it's happy hour food.  #greathappyhourprices Usually there is not a wait because you can sit yourself in the bar area. #nowaitinthebar My favorite is the corn tamale appetizer.
Deanna R.,"Chalmette, LA",31,26,9,5.0,10/28/2017,I ate here a few times before and was very pleased with the large selection of entrees. Service is always great here. The atmosphere is very nice. Plenty of seating is available and wait time for a booth is no longer than at the most 5 minutes. This is a great location for a restaurant like this one because it is conveniently located near Lakeside Mall. Eat here after a long day of shopping you won't be disappointed.
Brian S.,"New Orleans, LA",104,50,116,5.0,11/4/2017,I have been eating at Cheesecake Factory for years. The  food is excellent and always ample portions. I especially like the Happy Hour specials on Monday through Thursday from 4-6 pm featuring craft cocktails and the great bar menu. The sweet corn tamale cakes are my favorite and the burger is great as well. The regular menu is huge with many choices. Main problem is I am always too full for dessert and the cheesecake is pricey.
Rosa C.,"Belle Chasse, LA",8,15,15,2.0,1/6/2018,The food was good. The service was AWFUL! We were here around 30 minutes before our drinks came & over an hour before our food showed up. Just awful!
Keshante A.,"New Orleans, LA",17,41,9,3.0,12/2/2017,"Went here for dinner last night. Most people already know the menu is huge. We started with the buffalo blasts as an app which were kinda salty, but tasted alright. For my entree I chose the cashew chicken, which is an Asian-inspired rice dish. It tasted good, but I've had better from Chinese take out. My boyfriend had the shrimp scampi. We are the type of people that look at the menu online before we eat out, and the scampi looked nothing like the picture on the website! It was very buttery, but he liked it. We loved our cocktails, Irish whiskey coffee & typhoon punch. Excellent chocolate cake. Serve Bitney was attentive and checked on is regularly. I just think Cheesecake Factory needs to scale down their menu and only focus us a few specific foods, instead of trying to be everything for everyone. Not to mention, my boyfriend got sick as a dog a few hours after our meal."
C C.,"LaPlace, LA",0,5,26,5.0,12/29/2017,"The wait time was less than 15 mins as it was not crowded. Tried the typhoon pinch which was not so good, crab and artichoke dip w chips, and salmon and asparagus. Food was good but ambiance was dark!"
Nikkie N.,"New Orleans, LA",402,215,993,4.0,7/13/2017,"""bacon-bacon cheeseburger"" - it exceeded all of my expectations. Honestly, I'm still thinking about this burger. The bacon-bacon cheeseburger resembles my favorite burger of all time (Au Cheval in Chicago). The beef patty was cooked to a perfect medium. Slightly pink and juicy. The bacon.. OMG the bacon. Smokey, sweet, tasty.. YOU MUST TRY IT!! ""fried macaroni and cheese"" - yas. just yas. ""pasta with shrimp & sausage"" - spicy red sauce pasta, a little salty for my taste but very flavorful. definitely left over worthy! first time dining, the menu was extensive and overwhelming. the server was very helpful!"
Yseven N.,"New Orleans, LA",0,3,,1.0,12/22/2017,Well I just had my phone stolen by one of the bus boys. Not to mention worst service ever. Beware of this place. You might get your wallet stolen
Donald J.,"Covington, LA",5,18,14,3.0,9/24/2017,"I went here on a first date on the night of 9/22/2017. Since it was a first date I did not whip out my phone and start taking pictures. We arrived at 7 P.M.. There was not a line so our table wait was very short. This was my first time here but my date had been here before. I found the atmosphere quite pleasant. We were escorted to our table and shortly after being seated our waiter arrived. Everyone was nice and our waiter was prompt and attentive.  We ordered our food and drinks and received them within a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the seared Ahi Tuna dish and my date ordered the fried shrimp dish. She was not too pleased with her choice. She said it was alright but that was about it. The Ahi Tuna on the other hand was very good. I felt like the amount of tuna was a little small and it did not come with a side dish. All-in-all it was a good first experience but certainly nothing to write home about.  I tried to make a reservation but was told that they do not take reservations for Friday and the weekend, only for Monday thru Thursday. So on a weekend you just have to take your chances with having to possibly wait in a line to get seated. I would say that this restaurant is about on par with other chain restaurants to which I have been."
Javanti G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",12,8,2,5.0,11/19/2017,I always enjoy coming here!! Love the pastas! The honey chicken is amazing!!! And it's cheesecake heaven! I recommend eating here!
Theresa N.,"Gretna, LA",248,42,252,2.0,4/11/2017,"Expect the service to be slow. Nothing more. Nothing less. The waiters aren't as attentive as I'd like them to be, which means I'm constantly trying to flag down any waiter to get MY waiter to get a refill, to-go box, check, or to order. Last time I dined in, the waiter forgot to put in my order so I was the only one out of my table who didn't have food. By the time everyone was done, he finally confessed to having forgotten to put in my order. Not only that, but he was consistently rude throughout the night. He seemed bothered to be serving us for no reason at all. Ok, whatever. But as soon as the manager came by to see why the food was taking so long, his attitude did a whole 180. The manager, however, was nice enough to comp my dish and apologize for the inconvenience.   The food is okay. It's a chain restaurant so it's not amazing but it's not bad either. I like their crab cakes and pasta dishes. Overall, I'll probably never dine in here again due to my past experiences but I'd definitely consider ordering for takeout."
Nicole P.,"New Orleans, LA",17,49,80,4.0,11/2/2017,"Dined here twice and have never had a problem with either service or my food. We're always seated right away, but maybe that's because I always come during the lunch hours. Today's service was nothing short of excellent. Our server introduced herself as Kelly and she was very attentive. Took drink orders and came back with that and the bread they give you with the slab of butter. We ordered the crispy crab bites as an appetizer and our entrees came off the lunch menu. My mom got the herb crusted salmon which comes with a lemon glaze underneath and a bed of mashed potatoes w/ asparagus. I got the Cheesecake Factory famous meatloaf which also comes with mashed potatoes and corn maque choux. The app was basically little ball sized crab cakes with a side of I think they called it mustard sauce? These were good, really crispy on the outside. My lunch portion was HUGE. It came with 2 slices of the meatloaf smothered in a mushroom and onion gravy. I really liked it and I'm pretty picky so that's a plus. My mom liked her salmon a lot and ended up finishing it. We had a slice of fresh strawberry cheesecake to share and that topped of the meal. The prices are very reasonable esp for lunch and those portions! I can imagine a dinner size then. My tea was always refilled and we were checked on often. I will be back again to try something new on that super long menu with endless choices!"
Rhonda F.,"Metairie, LA",0,35,,3.0,8/5/2017,"I haves visited this restaurant on several occasions.  CF offers a wide range of menu selections, which is the best part of eating here. The downside is it is inconsistent, the service is hot or miss, and some items on the menu are too salty for my taste. My favorite items are the Tex Mex egg rolls, omelets, and the cheesecake, of course.  The chicken salad was the least favorite item I had, too salty. The chicken pot pie had a strange flavor, and lacked CHICKEN.   I think the place has atmosphere, and potential, but the service is usually sub par, ."
Chrissy F.,"Gretna, LA",1,45,11,1.0,12/24/2017,Do not order a whole cheesecake from here ever. First they recommend that you order it ahead of time so I did that and then I called to make sure my order was ready on the day that I was supposed to pick it up and the person who took my order did not even put it in. Their website also does not tell you that the half of a cheesecake for $25-$30 is per half not for the whole thing. I ended up having to pay $65 to get a half-and-half cheesecake after believing that it was going to be $30 as the website indicates. I could not even get the flavor that I ordered because of the incompetent person at the bakery who did not put my order in I had to choose something else. I will use my free slices and never come here again.
Clara D.,"New Orleans, LA",0,6,,5.0,11/5/2017,Best place I've eaten in a while. My first time here. Well worth the cost. Service was wonderful. I cannot say a bad thing about it. I will definitely return here again.
Vy T.,"New Orleans, LA",17,3,,1.0,7/14/2017,Sitting here and got no bread no service other than the drinks that got dropped off. Table next to us just sat down their waiter dropped off their bread real quick.  Bull shit service.
Michael W.,"Covington, LA",97,70,13,2.0,3/23/2017,"The menu is huge!! So much food, huge portions, and none of it has any flavor. This is a perfect example of why I avoid chain restaurants. Great atmosphere, average service, but the kitchen is an assembly line that pumps out tons of bland food. Notice, I did not mention the word ""cook"" because they obviously just warm up prepackaged components to each dish. They may have a good reputation in other parts of the country, but in this area there are too many other restaurants that offer the same atmosphere with far superior food."
Ashley P.,"New Orleans, LA",44,33,,1.0,5/22/2017,"(1) We were seated in the ""children"" section again--and the child in our party is 13 (2) There were small insects all over our table (3) No offer was made whatsoever when the bug-infested table was pointed out to the manager or server (4) I cannot say whether or not the food was good because we clearly did not eat it.  We've been to this restaurant many times in the past and always loved it. Not sure if management has changed or what. We won't be back, at least not anytime soon. The health department needs to make a surprise visit. I can only imagine what's in the kitchen if there are bugs on the tables."
Dracen P.,"LaPlace, LA",3,3,5,3.0,12/21/2016,"Food Was Great , By The way Great Bar Tender My Long Island Tea Was Good    Our Server was Friendly Over all Great place ."
Candace H.,"Arabi, LA",57,65,62,5.0,11/4/2016,"I am amazed by how consistantly good the food is here.  Tonight we tried the firecracker salmon app and the clam chowder soup of the day. I had my standard bang bang chicken and shrimp, always well done. And today i had the lemon meringue cheesecake.  Amazing!!!"
Adrienne F.,"New Orleans, LA",0,48,75,4.0,10/17/2016,"Amazing Cheesecake and Food... Most of the time. I have dined at this restaurant several times in the past two years. Most of the time the food is excellent. The one time it wasn't good it's like they didn't have all of the ingredients - and the food service took forever. But like I said that only happened once. The only other problem I have with the restaurant is that the menu is too large. Think EPIC Novel. The other night we had their SUPER ANTIOXIDANT SALAD - and as a salad love this is always amazing - sooo many veggies and greens. My kids had the meatloaf and SHEPHERD'S PIE and my husband had the Bacon Burger. OMG the Bacon Burger was the best ever - they had some grilled medallions of something bacon on top that was closer to a soaked roast bacon. NOTE: They don't take reservations on the weekends so normally we shop, drop by and ask for a table near the time we want to eat, have them text your phone when your table is ready - otherwise you have to mill around with the little plastic buzzer. I'd rather shop a little more while we wait."
Gretchen T.,"Arabi, LA",3,5,,4.0,7/21/2017,"Tried the loaded tots like most people were recommending.. they were EXCELLENT. The wait staff took a while to get to our table, but it was worth the wait. It was a busy night so it's understandable!!! For the entree, I had the crusted chicken. It was great, definitely 5/5 for flavor!"
Amelie M.,"Uptown, New Orleans, LA",142,78,54,3.0,8/23/2016,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend for lunch. By the time we were seated (after not a very long wait) we were famished. We each ordered a drink and those came quickly.  An omen of good things to come? Not so much.  While our food was very tasty we had at least three different waitresses throughout our meal. Service took quite a while. My boyfriend was served free bread as an apology for the delay, but I am gluten free so I had to be hungry for a while. When we finally got our food, it was what you would expect from Cheesecake Factory: a good meal at reasonable prices. I even got the gluten free pasta which was one of the top 5 pastas I've had since I've had to give up gluten.  In conclusion, the food was good. The service needs improvement."
Adan G.,"North Central, San Antonio, TX",74,9,14,5.0,7/14/2017,"We had great service for the amount of people that there was, and the food was delicious. I ordered a Smoke house BBQ burger and it was so delicious. Probably one of the best burgers I've had. I also got to try the dishes my family ordered and they were all very delicious. The price of the food was not too bad and you get HUGE portions. It's pretty hard to finish the food. I recommend this place."
Katherine D.,"Southeast Houston, Houston, TX",118,3,,5.0,10/1/2017,"Initially read some reviews that were poor, not clean and only 2.5 stars average. They are wrong. Great food, as we get at every CCF. Service was great. It looked and smelled very clean. All on top of it. So glad we chose to come in. We almost didn't because of the reviews. And very friendly too. Great place to eat!! Thanks CCF for a great meal!!"
Michelle Q.,"New Orleans, LA",142,188,613,3.0,1/17/2017,"We got to the restaurant before the lunch rush. The hostess took my name and advised us that we would be seated shortly. We were seated 3-5 minutes after that. Our waitress then greeted us immediately. She took our drink order. We also ordered a tuna appetizer. The restaurant was out of Tuna completely. So we ordered pot stickers. We also ordered our meal. I ordered the bang bang shrimp and chicken with brown rice, while my husband ordered a skinny burger cooked med well. The waitress was friendly. She asked if we wanted bread and brought it to us soon after. She then asked me, ""oh you wanted white rice?"" I corrected her and said brown. She asked my husband how he wanted his burger cooked. He reminded her, medium well.  The appetizer came out timely. I noticed that the restaurant started to fill up. We waited over 30-35 minutes for our meal. They brought me orange chicken and rice instead of the bang bang chicken and shrimp. I was disappointed and advised the food runner that my order was wrong. The waitress came to the table and said that she would get me the correct order. That it was the kitchen's fault. I asked her for a box and the check. I had to get back to work. I also told her to bring the orange chicken back. I couldn't wait. Low and behold, the check comes out and it says, orange chicken. She put the order in wrong. I wish that servers would write all of their orders down! No manager was in sight. I was extremely aggravated."
Tanya T.,"New Orleans, LA",14,3,5,5.0,12/7/2016,"Delicious is all I can say!!! Yummy.  I had the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it was great.  Bow tie pasta with like a creole creamy sauce.  It was sorta like the sauces at Copelands but better in my opinion. They were not stingy either when it came to the sauce. I also had a delicious Lemon drop drink, our server was very polite as well, but I don't remember his name. We will definitely be back."
Lacey D.,"Metairie, LA",159,418,1720,4.0,7/9/2016,"My husband and I had a good meal here- good food, great service. We had two excellent appetizers- the chicken samosas and the beet salad. He got the chicken littles which were delicious and I got the beef dip sandwich which was pretty good, with Mac and cheese on the side which was also delicious. Our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly."
Levanzell H.,"New Orleans, LA",165,1,1,3.0,4/27/2017,"My Fiancé and I just finished having a meal here. Compliments to the chef because the Crab Cake Bites were amazing. I had the Ribeye and she had the shepherds pie, both were perfect.  However, our Server Sarah was lacking. We ordered alcoholic beverages and if it were not for me stopping her to check our IDs she would have forgotten. The drinks took about 7-10 minutes to get to our table. Once they arrived, I could not locate Sarah quite sometime because we needed waters. I've been here before so I know the service can be better but this time was a mess."
Kimberly C.,"Ponce de Leon, FL",50,17,56,2.0,2/10/2017,"Menu is entirely TOO BIG.  Pages and pages of choices.  A little ridiculous.  Egg roll sampler was good, no complaints.  And my crispy chicken sandwich was good as well.  I chose both sauces - buffalo and chipotle mayo.   The speed of service was AWFUL!!  Had a server named Zak S.  Extremely slow!!!!!!!  From the drinks to the check!  Very nice guy, but no pep in his step AT ALL!!!   Requested Splenda for my tea, took about 8 mins.  In that time, I took it from another table that had gotten up.  Never checked on us once during our meal.  Had to track him down to ask for the check.  Asked if they had a senior discount for my parents.  Said he didn't think so but he'd ask.  Never got that answer either."
Saja O.,"Metairie, LA",5,6,23,4.0,2/10/2017,Food was good but took too long to come out. My favorite is the Factory nachos. The cheesecake was very delicious and was big enough to share. Overall not a bad place to go for a Friday night.
Jena S.,"Paradis, LA",39,93,249,4.0,1/7/2017,"I wish they had half stars bc this place isn't a 3 but it isn't a 4 , to me they have too many things on the menu like and everything is just ok like nothing is amazing where I'm like omg let's go to cheese cake factory , except the cheesecake of course now they got that on the spot ! I mean nothing's more perfect than like 30 different cheese cakes ( if that's what it is it might not be that many but that's what it feels like ) the other negative place about this place is the bar , every time. I get a drink their it sucks and not no elaborate drink nah , margarita and Bloody Mary ! My 2 go to favs! We're disgusting ! The Bloody Mary was like straight up tomato juice with no add ins to make it a Bloody so basically it was v8 with I'm sure a splash of vodka bc that drink was so thick u kno they didn't add much liquor. Another thing is the decor . We like to eat so we plus size ppl and them little wicker chairs are so uncomfortable like do u want ur guest to stay and enjoy and order more dessert and coffee and drinks to make more profit ? lol I guess not"
Linda S.,"Violet, LA",39,8,,1.0,1/27/2017,"Waited 15 minutes after sitting down for someone was to wait on us. I asked the server his answer was,"" couldn't I see how busy they were"".  He brought my tea and I had to ask for lemon and sugar.  Placed an order for the steak sandwich on French roll. My friend ordered a hamburger w bacon and sauce only. We again waited a long time. They brought out my food only. Instead of a French roll it was served on a hamburger bun. My food was also cold. My friends food came out after and was also wrong as it was fully dressed. We waited so long as we just ate the food instead of waiting another hour for the right order.  I will never be back. Bad service even worse food."
Marielle S.,"New Orleans, LA",182,1981,4511,4.0,4/5/2016,"I was actually pretty surprised by Cheesecake Factory. When someone mentioned we were eating here for dinner, I wasn't super excited. I didn't really know what to expect from a national chain, but I kept an open mind. We came on a Thursday evening and the place was PACKED. Seriously, there was a 20 minute wait and I was pretty surprised. I guess because it's attached to the mall it gets a lot of action. Anyway, after waiting for a bit we were seated and given the huge super long menu they have. It pretty much has everything on here you could want from burgers and fish to ribs and their version of Thai food- no kidding. I decided to get the fried catfish which came with sides of mashed potatoes, corn and green beans. When the food came, I was immediately impressed by the portion- three good sized pieces of catfish and generous amounts of sides. The fish was cooked nicely with a thin crust and had a good flavor. The sides were okay- my favorite was the mashed potatoes but I could have done without the green beans as they were a bit under cooked for my liking. All in all, dinner was good and more than I expected from a chain. Since we were at the Cheesecake Factory, naturally I had to try some of the good stuff. I got the Hershey's Cheesecake and not only were they generous with the portion, but it was delicious! It was basically a chocolate bomb and I had to stop myself from scarfing down the entire thing. As for service- our waiter was a bit slow, but that was only because the dining room was full. The guy was still very sweet, so it wasn't a huge deal. While I wouldn't rush back to Cheesecake Bistro, I wouldn't balk if I ended up here for dinner again."
