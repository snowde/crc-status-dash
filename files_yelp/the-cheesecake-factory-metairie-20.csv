Shawn K.,"New Orleans, LA",400,2,,3.0,6/26/2014,Food was really good. Waiters were overstrained and kept coming over to obnoxious degree.
Jeremy S.,"New Orleans, LA",1,9,,1.0,8/2/2014,"We had a party of 14 for a friend's birthday. We got here at 3:00. It took until 4:30 to be seated and another hour and a half to get our food. It took speaking with a manager to get our orders correct. The food, when it finally arrived, was delicious and with generous portions. I, however, will not be coming back."
Emily D.,"Metairie, LA",9,1,,4.0,6/24/2014,"The menu has a lot of items and is pretty confusing if you've never been there before, but the food was delicious (the avocado egg rolls get an A+). The food took a while to arrive and there were some kinks, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened. Loved the ambiance outside, the fans made it comfortable even though it was a hot day."
Jerry G.,"Kenner, LA",0,90,,1.0,9/21/2014,"Went there last night service was terrible no clean glasses,no silverware loud customers food was extremely over cooked,everyone screaming on cellphones,my God wouldn't,t bring my dog to that place what has happened to Metairie when we told the manager what was going on he shrugged his shoulders and walked away!He said he was aware of the dirty dishes and service issues but had no solutions!The servers all were complaining about the certain customers not tipping that leads to poor server attitudes! I had high hopes for this place but they went straight out the window!"
Kenneth C.,"Milton, FL",22,13,1,1.0,9/20/2014,Food was great. Service was VERY SLOW. Took 1hr and 15min to get our food from the time we sat down.
Jessica C.,"Slidell, LA",0,2,,4.0,5/14/2016,"I look forward to going to Cheesecake Factory.  We had been to one, several years ago, in King of Prussia Mall.  Back then, they had more choices of burgers, including some with goat cheese and avocado.  It seems they've scaled back on the burger choices, which is disheartening.  But I had fallen in love with the raspberry lemon cheesecake, which they still have.  They also have a great mango key lime cheesecake.  I am one who prefers a tart cheesecake as opposed to a very sweet cheesecake, so the lemon and key lime choices are great.  I have ordered the Bistro Shrimp Pasta several times.  I have also gotten the Cobb salad and a few of the burgers.  I do enjoy the food and the bread.  My mom enjoys the salmon.  If you're a fan of bleu cheese dressing, make sure to get a salad.  Not everything comes with a salad, but, if you don't like a particular side item that comes with an entree, you can usually substitute a salad.  For example, you could choose a salad instead of the mashed potatoes.  They sometimes bring out a sizable container of dressing for the salad.  If your salad comes with dressing already on it, it's no problem to ask for extra dressing.  As for the service, it is kind of hit or miss.  We had gone after a Saints game, one late Sunday afternoon, and there was a shift change, so it seemed like we were temporarily forgotten.  My mom put in a complaint about the service through email, I think, after our visit.  Probably a few months later, they were just getting to read the email!  But someone did call and offer a free slice of cheesecake.  When we went back, the service was fabulous.  The next time, good service, but then, yesterday, back to slow service, again. And that was at an earlier lunch time.  The waitress was very pleasant, but the food took forever.  My mom ordered a salad to substitute for a side item that came with her salmon, assuming the salad would come out first (which it had in the past), but it didn't.  In fact, the waitress brought out the salad dressing about 20 minutes before the salad came.  Then everything was coming out at once.  She is a slow eater, so she ended up giving me some of her salad so that she wouldn't feel so rushed.  One special perk, though, we got a survey on our receipt to do online, and we get $5 off of our next visit.  We will definitely go back!"
Tricia O.,"Metairie, LA",0,6,,1.0,8/27/2014,"There is no way that this place deserves more than 1 star!!!  We literally waited 1 hour after ordering just to get our food.  When it came, my enchiladas were ice cold and the meet in my daughter's Philly Cheese Steak was very overcooked on the outside and completely raw in the middle.  Also, the bread was so hard that it could have been used as a baseball bat.  I sent my food back twice to be reheated.  Each time the porcelain plate came out hot but the food was no warmer than room temperature.       Also, I have talked to three other couples who also went there for lunch or dinner separately and at different times and they ALL HAVE THE SAME HORROR TALE TO TELL!       You'll most probably want to go try it for yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you."
Sarah P.,"Metairie, LA",0,13,1,1.0,2/1/2015,"Cheesecake is big portions and any flavor imaginable. Food is ok, drinks were good. Service was horrible. Our waitress took forever with everything that the manager had to come over twice to get us things. She was also very rude. Overall, I would definitely get cheesecake to go but will not dine in again."
Brittany K.,"New Orleans, LA",0,28,,3.0,4/27/2015,"When I was a kid, and lived in a place that only had chain restaurants, this used to be my favorite restaurant (South Florida for those curious). I would always get the chicken salad sandwich or the lettuce wraps and always left extremely happy. After living in a city where chain restaurants are snubbed, I can certainly no longer say cheesecake factory is my favorite. Food elsewhere is just far superior. There is nothing wrong with cheesecake factory and it's still a solid chain, but the food is just kind of ""meh."" I will say, I think the chicken salad sandwich at this particular location is no where as tasty as I remember...could just be my taste bubs improving since I had not had it for some years, or could be (as other reviewers commented) that this one just isn't up to par as others. I've been about 3-4 times to this location and can say the lettuce wraps and salads are good and the pancakes for brunch were actually delicious. I saw a lot of reviewers commented on poor service but I actually had amazing service all the times I went. The servers were extremely friendly and attentive! They were great with refilling water, giving more bread, and bringing extra condiments so no complaints there!"
Sheila L.,"Kenner, LA",0,1,,5.0,7/23/2015,"We went in and the hostess was friendly and seated us quickly. Our waitress, Sarah was excellent. Didn't take long for her to come and take our drink order which she kept filled the entire time. Food came out in a decent amount of time and was delicious. My husband's steak was cooked perfect and my bang bang shrimp and chicken was superb. I can't say enough about how friendly and attentive Sarah was. Contrary to the other bad reviews I see here, our experience was wonderful. Definitely going back. Have many more dishes I want to try."
Nhi P.,"Marrero, LA",26,9,24,1.0,10/11/2014,"This is my second time I gave this location a try. Once again, I am disappointed. We had to ask for utensils to eat with and complimentary bread. As for entrées, they messed up my brothers order and by the time they brought out the right one everyone else was finish with their food. Was never asked if we needed refills on our drinks. We had to ask for refills and they even refilled a cup with no Ice. When dessert was brought out once again, no utensils!"
Nini N.,"Slidell, LA",3,14,62,2.0,12/15/2014,Not a place to go if you are hungry because it will make you HANGRY for waiting so long for your food. Its been an hour and no food yet. It's not even a busy night. The server is poopoo as well... Taking forever to take our order! But the food was good.
J L.,"New Orleans, LA",0,7,,2.0,2/12/2015,"Large portions, nice ambiance, but very poor service. I had a coupon which the server lost. Server was pleasant, apologized but did not offer any discount."
Meghan P.,"Marrero, LA",2,10,,2.0,12/3/2014,"place is gorgeous on the inside, however we waited and hour and fifteen minutes because the host forgot to buzz us... manager was very apologetic and offered a free appetizer... our server was very nice but the food was just not good, in my opinion. it was bland, the pasta was hard , just not a good food experience. the server was great, even though it seemed everyone had plenty tables to tend to, she did a good job."
Cynthia K.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",8,55,4,2.0,8/31/2014,"Ok seriously,  all three of my children have worked for this chain over the years. In Ma. And Ca. This review is for the service only. The food is good. No hostess in the front.  Went to the bar to eat. Bar tender took the order. Food comes out from the runner.  No set ups. Bartender says she has two forks and a spoon.  Gives us a choice. I ask for napkin and setups. I get none. I have two forks and a spoon. Paper napkins from the bar. Now I get no sugar for coffee. I have to ask. Did they train these people???? This isn't one person but three different people. Get some training!!!"
Amy N.,"Kenner, LA",0,7,15,1.0,9/21/2014,"Waited over an hr 4 a table , server was more attentive 2 the other table than ours , didn't get any refills on out drinks , We had 2 wait over 30 minutes 4 utensils , like really !!! They ran out of to go boxes also , like really ??  This place is not worth the time r money , we spent over $160.00 , I don't recommend this place 2 anyone"
Cinnamon G.,"New Orleans, LA",4,16,,1.0,6/23/2014,"We came here for dinner last week, the day after it opened. I had never been to The Cheesecake Factory anywhere else before and I thought I would give it a try because cheesecake sounded good that day. Food was OK, similar to what you'd get at Olive Garden, TGIF, or similar chain restaurants, but The Cheesecake Factory costs twice as much. The decor feels very much like an old hotel restaurant that has had many renovations and has an ongoing identity crisis. The service was some of the worst customer service I have ever had. We waited much longer than the ticketed estimated time, and I noticed that the hostesses kept telling people that the wait for a table would be less than it actually was, despite knowing that the wait would be longer. We were told repeatedly that the wait time would only be five minutes longer. Their ticketed waiting system is weird and inefficient.  Once we were ready to be seated, an African-American man with a purple shirt whom I presumed to be an assistant manager led us to our table, and when we arrived after a longer wait than we'd expected, the table had not been cleaned and had dirty dishes all over it. He asked us to wait our turn for the table to be cleaned and I saw many open tables and booths nearby that were cleaned and ready. I asked the man in the purple shirt for a different table and he stated that those tables were being reserved. As we continued to stand there while the busboys cleaned other tables before they could get to ours, I watched people that were behind us in line being seated at the clean tables and their drink orders being taken. After we were seated, we waited over fifteen minutes for someone to acknowledge our presence. It felt like we were being purposefully ignored. I noticed that we were the only Caucasian people in the vicinity and while we were being ignored, the African American man in the purple shirt was coming by and asking the tables of African American people around us if they needed anything. I've never felt the kind of blatant racism at a restaurant that I felt at The Cheesecake Factory. It was terrible.  Finally, a server from another section came by and asked us if we had been helped. She promptly took drink orders and brought us drinks. About fifteen minutes later, a man who was assigned to be our server came by and took our dinner order. We ordered garlic bread and zucchini and both of these appetizers were better than our meals. I should mention too that the menu at this restaurant has ads for other businesses on every other page. I've never seen anything like it, it felt cheesy and classless. I come to a restaurant to eat, relax, and enjoy myself, not to have more advertisements for other businesses tucked into my menu and flashed in my face. It's irritating and I felt disgusted that this restaurant thinks it's OK to intrude upon my leisure time out with more marketing. Are they not making enough money as a chain restaurant? Ugh... Offensive and presumptuous to say the least.  The meal arrived after about an hour and it just wasn't good enough to justify the price. The menu here has as much of an identity crisis as the decor. A little bit of whatever is popular right now, toned down and made palatable for the masses. ""Asian flavors"" are all the rage right now, as most foodies know. However, most foodies eat authentic Asian food regularly and this menu is very loosely inspired. Your palate will not be surprised and intrigued. It will be tricked by focus group tested entrees that are unadventurous and rather bland. Passable, but not memorable. A disappointment for any foodie. Trying to get drink refills was nearly impossible. We had a hard time flagging down a server. The tables near us though, seemed to be receiving excellent service.  After very little service throughout the entire meal, we were suddenly pressured to order dessert before we'd finished eating. When my friend finished his meal, the server tried to take his order for a dessert instead of waiting for us both. I felt rushed to finish, I really got the feeling that they wanted us to hurry up and leave. When I did finish, I had to flag the waiter down. We ordered two strawberry cheesecakes. Simple enough, right? Five minutes after we'd placed the order for the cheesecakes, a man I thought to be a manager or some corporate manager of one kind or another came by to inform us that they were out of strawberry cheesecake. We asked for cherry cheesecake instead. Five minutes later, he returned again to inform us that they did not have cherry cheesecake either. Day two at a restaurant called The Cheesecake Factory and they didn't have either. Absolutely perfect! The manager came out ten minutes later with two unappetizing slices of warm, melted cheesecake topped with cherry pie filling. We ate them quickly and left. The warm cheesecake was good, but certainly not the best.  You can eat better in NOLA and eat local, I do not recommend this restaurant for service or food."
Jimmy C.,"Metairie, LA",2,1,,1.0,12/21/2014,I seldomly complain because I been in the service industry for 3 years but the service I had here was horrible. Our drinks was empty and no refill. My brother and I ordered steaks but there was no steak knives. I had to get up from my table to ask our waitress for knives to cut our steak because we sat there for a good 15 minutes without anyone coming by to check if we needed anything. By that time we were eating cold steaks. Oh guess what? She never apologize or anything. So my family and I aren't coming back.
TrevAnn G.,"Pensacola, FL",0,15,16,3.0,12/6/2014,Good customer service. Horrible food. The worst Cheesecake Factory I've ever been to.
Nikki D.,"Metairie, LA",2,5,,4.0,12/16/2014,"my husband and I have been here twice and we really enjoyed it. the wait was not long at all and the service was great. the first time we went I ordered a steak and it was the best steak I have ever ate in my life, it was so tender and good. the second time we went I ordered the catfish and was really disappointed on that bc that catfish was very very soggy. my husband enjoyed all of his food also. the only thing is that the restaurant is pricy, but it's totally worth it."
