Lien L.,"New Orleans, LA",24,20,53,5.0,7/20/2014,"Came for dinner today and was a little disappointed. Came in at 5:30ish and was seated at around 6:10. Waited around some more until our waitress came. Our waitress was super friendly bit food came out so slow. We finished bread and appetizers wayyyy before main entrees came out. For a Sunday dinner service, they were out of a lot of things. Our waitress had a giant list of things that they were out for the night. Pretty much everything that the table next to us wanted to order was out. It was pretty bad.  Wanted to order the fried Mac and cheese but they were out. Settled for crab cakes. They were delicious!  I wanted the chicken Madeira....but they were out. Got the grilled salmon instead and it was pretty good too. Friend got the biscuits and chicken and she said it was very good. Like ""it came out of mamas kitchen!""  And the portion was huge!  Definitely a sharing meal. Grabbed an Oreo milkshake and a banana cheesecake for dessert. So so so good.  Besides the incredibly long wait for food and being out of food, everything else was wonderful. Especially our waitress. Hopefully they can pick up the pace as it goes along and have better approximation on how much food they are going to need for each nigh. Can't wait to come back again."
Jerry D.,"Jupiter, FL",1,4,,1.0,8/18/2015,Sitting here waiting for my food for 1 hour with nothing else to do.   And then being told the meal is now held up because of bad potatoes     The general manager comes over with such an attitude he makes it sound like its our problem.   This is a management problem.  Our waitress is sweet and feels caught in the middle Time to find a different dining establishment.
Trisha W.,"Belle Chasse, LA",6,35,1,1.0,4/29/2015,"Worst CF experience ever.  We've been to other CF's in different cities, but this one needs a lot of help.  My family was visiting so we decided to eat here.  We gave our cell number to the hostess and were told it would be about an hour.  Two hours go by and nothing.  I go in and inquire only to get a sorry it will be another thirty minutes.  Three hours go by and nothing.  We left and went to Red Lobster across the parking lot, where we received wonderful service.   Went back on another occasion to get cheesecake to go.  The cheesecakes (banana cream and red velvet) were very good, but the whipped cream they used tasted very stale. Oh, and no one ever called to let us know our table was ready that night!  Shame on this CF!"
Stacy R.,"New Orleans, LA",14,30,24,4.0,8/22/2014,"I had to give them a positive review, because I have read so many negative ones and we truly had a great experience. We arrived for lunch, right at 11 when they opened, and were seated right away.  Our drinks and appetizer (fried Mac and cheese) came out promptly and was delicious! Our entrees took about 20 minutes, but were very good. The Luau salad was great, and my mom had the Kobe burger which was fantastic.  All in all, it was a great and I  am excited to go back!"
Amanda P.,"Metairie, LA",154,90,260,2.0,5/11/2015,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night and we were seated immediately. The service was okay and the food quality was mediocre. The moment I looked at the menu I thought it was too large, and knew they would not be able to produce a quality meal. More options rarely means fresh and quality food or ingredients. It typically means the food has been frozen or prepared days in advance, and that's just the type of food I recieved. I ordered the chicken and biscuit which was very bland and the chicken was fatty. I couldnt force myself to eat it, so I brought it home to my English Bulldog since I didn't want to completely waste my money. I had a slice of the Tiramisu Cheesecake which was pretty good, but completely overpriced for a piece of cheesecake- Whole Foods sells an entire Tiramisu cake for about the same price as a slice of this cheesecake. I won't be visiting this restaurant again."
Jane A.,"Metairie, LA",0,3,,1.0,7/1/2016,Worst service ever!!!! We waited forever for a waitress that we had to flag down each and every time we needed her.  Apps and salads came out WITH our meals about 45 minutes after ordering.   Then the waitress brought the check before she even asked us if we wanted cheesecake. Which everyone in my party did  She seemed aggravated.   Never ever ever again.
Brandon T.,"Shreveport, LA",352,150,324,3.0,6/9/2015,"3.5 Stars  Well, the service is excellent! Some of the entrees are amazing. I've had the Kobe Beef Burger and it was very delicious. Juicy, thick, and seasoned well. Also I've had the Shepherd's Pie which is omg amazing. However, I will forewarn you to look up the nutrition facts of each entree. Apparently these dishes were made to be separated into two different meals, meaning the calorie count is skyrocket high. The restaurant itself is beautiful and I felt very comfortable here. Overall decent experience."
Quinntina D.,"New Orleans, LA",1,6,13,5.0,10/6/2015,"My husband and I stopped into The Cheesecake Factory, unexpectedly. The host was very pleasant. She informed us that it was happy hour. Great. We headed 2 the bar and was greeted by Jacob. Jacob was THEEEEEE BESTTTTTT. His service was awesome and very attentive. What really thrilled me with Jacob is that he DID NOT sterotype my husband and I and that means a lot to me. We ordered 4 appetizers and I must say, THEY WERE AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG. The Tuna Tatare damn near gave me an orgasm. Omg. It was the best Tuna I've had in my life. This will be my all time happy hour spot. #2thumbsup #keepupthegoodwork"
Alice C.,"Palmdale, CA",1851,280,506,3.0,2/24/2015,This was my first time at this cheese cake factory in orleans the waiter at the bar was kinda slow the drinks was pretty good. The wait time for our table was about 30 minutes they take your phone number and text you when the table is reday.I fell the food could had been a lot better .
Christopher L.,"Mandeville, LA",0,5,,1.0,12/10/2016,"We waited 1 hr and 10 mins for a table when they told us it would be 20 mins.  We had a party and 10 and we told them we didn't mind if they split the table up in order to speed up the wait time.  They keep us waiting outside in the cold weather for over an hour, NEVER checked on us, NEVER offered us a drink, NOTHING.  We finally gave up and went eat somewhere else.  They NEVER apologized just let us go away.  This is by far the worst customer service I have every seen.  Poor service."
Ryanne A.,"New Orleans, LA",331,4,9,2.0,2/14/2015,"Being in the service industry can be tricky. As a former hostess, I always thought of my customer first, sought out their needs before seating, and performed an analysis on where they would prefer to sit. I'd give them options. I tried to group parties with children together.  That was not what happened on that particular night. Perhaps it was an inevitable arrangement. However, I was surrounded by children. Not that I mind- but when they are loud & crying, it is not very pleasant when dining.  That being said, the food was okay. We ordered a pasta dish & chicken tacos. The dishes were definitely large in portions as our wonderful server stated before we ordered. Which, although I forgot his name, he was absolutely the most pleasant part of our meal.  I'm unsure if this was supposed to happen, but when the bread was brought to us, there was no silver in order to butter my bread. And it wasn't until after the meal was dropped to us by expo (moments after) that our silver was brought.  Luckily, the wine was delivered in more than a timely manner, so that was fantastic.  I do not believe I will be returning again unless it is to tell our server to find a different establishment."
Rana F.,"New Orleans, LA",107,85,315,4.0,2/20/2015,My initial visit was horrible but I have visited this restaurant a few times afterward and I have had nothing but great service. I visited this afternoon for Happy Hour and I actually enjoyed myself more than I have in past visits. The happy hour is from 4-6 on weekdays and it offers discounted drinks and meal specials. I had the factory burger and crab bites. The food was wonderful. My only negative is that I hated my margarita. It was too sweet and weak in reference to alcohol. My other drinks were wonderful. Service was prompt and effective. I highly encourage people to give this place another chance. It seems as if they finally have their act together.
Kristine H.,"New Orleans, LA",0,3,,2.0,11/30/2016,"Dirty, dirty , dirty! Silverware all had food on them. The menu was covered in food pieces. My glass had stuff caked on the side. So gross. I don't care how tasty the food is."
Katie K.,"LaPlace, LA",59,2,,2.0,11/22/2016,My husband and I ate here today at 4pm. Our server (maybe Kelly?) can to our table only to take our drink and food order. She did NOT RETURN! Someone else brought us our entrees. We flagged down another sever to refill our drinks because our server was nowhere to be found. The food was just okay. The women's bathroom was filthy! It needed to be cleaned. Another sever came to our table with the check and informed us that our original server had to leave. We paid and left. Hopefully this will result in better service....
Tommy W.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,,2.0,11/21/2016,"Worst kitchen service ever! The food is ok for the price and atleast you get a lot of food our waiter Reggie was phenomenal, he tried his best but the kitchen was horrible and the food Runners just as bad. some food was brought to our table, when we told them that that was not ours they left it on our table anyway. the manager had to throw it away and remake it for the table sitting behind us my burger came out way undercooked when it finally did come out. we went to the restaurant at 6 p.m. after a 30-minute wait to get a table we did not leave the restaurant  till 9 p.m.  in that time my tea was only refilled once. our waiter did try to make it right by comping our to go desserts which did make it a little bit better .I will give them one more try, but in a city like New Orleans when you can go to so many different restaurants service goes a long way."
Phillip M.,"Central City, New Orleans, LA",4,5,9,4.0,2/14/2016,"Overall good experience. Food was pretty good, service slow because we came on Valentines Day and the prices were to be expected. Just don't come on a weekend or holiday! But I will come back during a week night."
Megan W.,"Hamilton Township, NJ",12,92,15,2.0,12/22/2014,"We usually LOVE CF, but this particular one is just missing the mark. Came in at 4:30 on a Monday. Tons of empty tables, but we still waited 20 minutes. Asked for a high chair 3 times amongst two different employees and it never came. We finally just ran out to the car and got the stroller. We both ordered the garlic noodles with shrimp. The plain garlic noodles was $14.95, but we decided to have the shrimp added for an additional $4. Yeah, we each got THREE medium sized shrimp on our plate that were nothing special. THREE. Come on Cheesecake Factory, really? Our server, Phillip, was very nice, prompt, and accommodating. No complaints there!   I guess this is what we get for breaking our ""no chains"" rule, though. Tisk tisk. Slight correction: We actually got the lunch version of our meals. It was $15.95 each... but it still seems like we were skimped some shrimps!"
Sonya S.,"New Orleans, LA",30,147,94,1.0,11/20/2014,"I've been here twice and both times the food was awful as was the service. The second time we went it was about 9:45 as the in-laws plane had just arrived and we needed a place to eat late, so the place was 3/4 empty. It took them 45 minutes to bring our food and when they did it was all wrong! I ordered a salad with chicken and Blue cheese and it arrived as a bowl of lettuce with dressing- nothing else! For $15?? When I complained they brought some chicken and told me that they were out of Blue Cheese. Umm, in 45 minutes you could not have stopped by and mentioned that? The salad only had 4 ingredients and they couldn't get that right! My Mother in law received her overcooked chicken with freezing mashed potatoes and after complaining finally received another batch after she had finished her meal and my partner and his Dad had the Shepard's Pie which was too salty for either of them to eat- and that my friends, was a $75 bill with just coffee and water ordered outside of the main meals. No apologies from the staff or the manager who came by. With that kind of food and customer service, we will sadly never be back and I have really loved Cheesecake factory over the years, but this place is run so poorly and honestly the food is truly awful. I don't know if the entire chain has slipped down hill with frozen, prepackaged food that they heat and serve, or if it is just this particular branch, but both times we have been there we have been really unhappy with both the food and lackluster service. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Go to the Red Lobster across the parking lot instead. We've been there 3 times and every time the service is prompt and friendly and the food is stiff really good."
Gladys L.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,5,,5.0,11/11/2016,Food was prefect and great service! It seems like the previous bad reviews have gotten the management's attention! A positive experience!
Jackie M.,"Metairie, LA",25,98,48,4.0,4/19/2015,"I have been here a few times.  I have not gotten anything bad or anything I did not like.  I usually find a couple of things on the menu then ask the wait staff their opinion.  Which helps in the decision making since there is a large selection.  And its always nice to know the staff is knowledgeable.  Polite staff, clean and delicious food,No I not going to talk about the cheesecakes or deserts! Because that's my little secret and I'm not sharing.  Shhhh!"
