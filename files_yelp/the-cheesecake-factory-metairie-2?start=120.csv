Michael K.,"Dallas, TX",27,113,32,4.0,2/5/2015,2nd time at this location. Had the lower calorie (hard to believe at Cheesecake Factory) salad (under 590 cal) that was huge and excellent. Easy in/out for lunch at bar area that is first come/first serve.
Mildred T.,"Metairie, LA",0,9,3,1.0,3/8/2015,"Haven't been here in a while and know why. The restaurant was 1/2 empty and when we left no one was being seated. Could this be because there wasn't anything left on the menu? Why be open if you can't get anything you want to eat? The server had to carry a list with her of what wasn't available. The manager came out to apologize and said something about the truck being short? They had to go to the store? So is this why when I finally ordered ""a hamburger"" it came out 40 minutes later without any tomato and with a soggy bun? We usually sit at the bar but decided against that after waiting 10 minutes to be recognized. I think corporate needs to take a look at the management of this restaurant."
E b.,"Kenner, LA",23,69,588,2.0,1/7/2015,"DO NOT ORDER EVELYNS FAVORITE PASTA!! Sorry, but I had to put that out there first. I have been here twice. 20-30 minute wait both times. The first time was for my birthday with my bf. We waited by the bar and ordered frozen drinks while we waited. Delicious but not very potent. Seating:  I hate the seating! The lighting is intimate but the seating is not. They have everyone seated so close together, I could hear the people next to us smacking their lips as they ate. We were seated next to a group of cackling hens. At the table: They serve nice warm bread with pats of butter first. We order mac and cheese balls for appetizers. I have to say that was so good!!!  I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering Evelyns favorite pasta. Its like a mixed pasta with veges in it. I actually gagged at the first bite. Thinking maybe I probably needed to stir it up some, I took a second and third bite. It tasted even worse.  I told the waitress how awful it was and she was very accommodating. I was allowed to order something else (and agreed that that dish was just nasty).   Meanwhile, my bf was chomping on his KOBE BEEF BURGER with swiss. As I waited for the waitress to return with the menu, my bf looked like he was enjoying that dang burger way too much. So I asked him for a bite. This burger was yummy...wait let me say that again...YUMMY! It was big enough for two. So when the waitress finally came back with the menu, I said ""I already know what I want! I want exactly what he's having...except with sweet potato fries!""  Well, we were full off his burger and just took mine to go...which ended becoming his lunch for work...kobe beef lunch. Must be nice. Yaaaaas, thank you, it was. Anyway, we couldn't get that kobe beef off our minds so we decided to go back a second time... with a game plan. It seems their servings are ample enough for two, so I find the prices somewhat reasonable for the amount of food you get. We got seated in a different area but it was still too close for comfort. Im beginning to believe that the dim lightning isnt for ambiance,  but so you dont see the people next to you chew their food!  We got the same sweet waitress and I was straightfoward, "" We're gonna split a kobe beef burger and a cheesecake."" Just like that. She even gave me an extra plate for my half. I filled up on that dang bread they serve in advanced. So when i got my burger, I couldn't even finish half of that half...bummer. (Not for him, though. He ate the rest.) We sat around talking, letting the food digest and then ordered BANANA CREAM CHEESECAKE. Im glad we only ordered one, bc that sucka was big. It was good, but we were hoping the banana slices were in it...not around it. It also had ALOT of whipped cream with it. Whipped cream is good. Heck, it's great!!! In this case, it only serves to fill the empty spaces on plate...which is ok. Overall, the food is pretty good. If you dont like it, they will accommodate. (That doesnt mean eat half way through the dish you didn't like!!) The server we had was very nice. Pricewise... I would say it would have been worth it if I wasnt surprised and dissapointed with it being a 'nice..but not really' restaurant. The atmosphere is set up to give you higher end expectancies, but the crowd and seating are not what you get. I go in there dressed for a nice evening out and there is a mish mosh of heels, work shoes and flip flops walking around. It's off putting.  My friend had to remind me that CF is attached to a mall so I should expect the mall crowd to show up.  Oh and did I mention..don't order Evelyns Favorite Pasta and seating sucks. Yes...I just wanted to make sure. That's why this place gets two stars...GET IT TO GO."
Yara M.,"Ocean Springs, MS",0,8,3,1.0,6/11/2015,"I usually love coming to The Cheesecake Factory, especially this one. I was excited for a amazing lunch, but was very very disappointed. I ordered the Veggie Burger(posted a picture of it) which is what I love to order every time I come by. It is my ultimate favorite burger, it's just so good. Though I love it, Ii usually don't finish it sadly. But this time when I ordered it was so bad. The burger to bun ratio is 4:1, it's too much. I had to pick the sides off so I can pick it up to eat. And this time it was very raw and soggy. So I cut it into two and the toppings all fell out all raw and just too dry. The fries were extremely salty and cold. Nothing about this dish was good. I wasted $12.50."
Jacqueline G.,"Davenport, IA",8,23,5,2.0,11/23/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is my favorite place to eat typically anywhere I go- but this one, eh.  My food was fine, I get the same thing every time, but the staff was awful. I wanted to place a Togo order and I was on hold for 15 minutes.  The hostess who took my call named Dejah has the worst voice and 0 customer service skills.  She truly shouldn't be doing her job.   I went in to place my Togo order and the girls at the cheesecake counter were so caught up in their personal convo that I waiting as the first in line forever!  I heard them cursing and hackling with each other. Awful."
Bryan P.,"Westwego, LA",82,3,,2.0,8/9/2014,"Where do I start? I've been here twice since it opened in Metairie and plenty of times when I was out in other states on business trips.  My first time here was when it opened and it was good! My date and I were promptly seated and my waiter was really nice! Mind you we went at around 4 pm. I had an okay experience. Food was a little pricier than I remembered but, what the heck?  There's complimentary bread slices with cold butter- who the f does that?! If you're serving bread, make sure it's room temp.  I ordered the Southwestern Eggrolls, buffalo wings and a burger- don't remember which one (wasn't that memorable). I established that I liked the place enough and would come back with friends to have them try it. 2nd time we went was on a Friday night. Dear sweet baby Jesus was that the worse idea ever. We got there early...and I mean early at 6:30 and get this... We didn't get seated until 8 O'FREAKING CLOCK! It was only 4 people, mind you. Okay whatever, I had a good time catching up with friends We were sat at the veryyy back. Literally the window overlooked a brick wall. Our server, bless her heart, was an Indian girl for whom I could not, for the life of me understand. I felt so incredibly bad because none of my friends or my date could understand what she was saying either and had to ask her to repeat herself multiple times.  So, 15 minutes in, we still didn't get our drinks. The waitress finally comes back, gets our drink and finally our orders... We wait. And we wait. And for goodness sakes, we wait. It's now, oh idk, 8:35 ish and she comes back to tell me that my entree is out- seriously?! I pick something else, French Dip sandwich I think? Who cares, whatever...  During this whole escaped, we see 2 separate tables being seated... One was  a large group of women, about 6-7 seated at a round table next to us, another 4 party group, seated a little farther from us.. Well, it's now been about a 45 minute wait and our food has still yet to come out and our waitress has yet to check on us. BUT, OHHHH, the 2 tables that were seated much after us received their drinks, apps and entrees before ours even came out. WTF?! Literally at this point I wanted to just walk out of the restaurant, but I figured I waited this long and I didn't think my friends and date would have done the same. Lol. Finally, it's pushing close to 10pm and we get our entrees. Never again will I go here. We ordered 2 macaroni burgers, French dip, and a breakfast omelet combo. No one enjoyed their food and we were all pretty tired from waiting so long to eat an overpriced, sub par, chain restaurant. By the time we left, we had seen our waitress about 3 times. Once for drinks, second it take our orders and 3rd to give us our check. The runners brought our food out... Oh, and for clarity, we left the restaurant at around 10:45. The worst dining experience I've ever had. You do the math on how long it took for this subpar meal to end. Hint, it was +4hours Please, please, please, don't waste your money here."
Dana P.,"Metairie, LA",175,283,8,2.0,7/28/2014,"Ok first off, I have been to plenty of Cheesecake Factories in California. So, I know what to expect from them. That being said, this location seriously needs help. Get some new management and staff pronto because this place running at it's current rate is completely unacceptable. I really wanted to leave a positive review since there are so many negative ones and I hoped to give them a chance. I seriously can not give a positive review after our experience yesterday though. We went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a total of 4 in our party. We were given a wait time of 40 minutes. Every other location I have been to always has a long wait as well, so I already expected that. They are just a popular place and always have a crowd. What I was not expecting though, was the inepptitude of the host staff. There were at least 4 of them ""running"" the front desk and they seemed to be unprepared at the overwhelming process of all the people. When our 40 minutes passed by, we went up to make sure we had not been forgotten. They said we still had 4 groups ahead of us. It took at least another 15-20 minutes before we were actually seated. One person took our drink orders. My table all ordered water, except for me. I ordered their iced tea. The iced tea alone is one thing that draws me to the Cheesecake Factory. They serve Paradise brand Tropical Tea and it is one of my favorites. Our ""server"" showed up a bit later. I use the term server loosely here because this guy's future actions depict him more as just a ""player"" looking to pick up phone numbers from women at other tables. He had no interest in conducting the duties of a server...mainly delivering food. He had his flashy watch and tie and seemed to spend the whole time we were there hanging out a couple tables away with 2 other women, just socializing the afternoon away. We gave him our order and asked for our comlimentary bread, which should have come out with our drinks and had not.  He never did bring the bread. We had to ask someone else passing by. I had ordered the Avocado Eggrolls as an appetizer. Some other person brought that out. The Avocado Eggrolls are always a favorite and they were just as delicous as I had remembered them. After some time passed, yet another person brought out 2 entrees for the other couple we were with. They were starving and said they wanted to start eating rather than wait for our entrees to come out. We understood and that was fine. My boyfriend received his entree yet from another different person. I never received my entree. We never did see our ""server"".  The other couple we were with started having doubts about their meal. Their pasta was supposed to have chicken in it, but it didn't have any. Our ""server"" finally showed up about 10 minutes asking how everything was. I said well, I never received my entree. He didn't seem to care much. Nor did he care that the other 2 people in our party were missing their chicken. He instead argued with them and said they must have ordered the wrong dish. He told me he would go see what was up with my missing salmon. We also asked for a refill on our bread. We never did get any. We asked 2-3 times over the course of the entire event, and he never brought any at all. When we looked over to see if he was finding out about my missing entree, he wasn't checking on my missing salmon, he was over hanging out with the women at the other table again. My boyfriend had to try and flag him down again. I told him to just forget the salmon, that by the time he ever would get around to bringing it, I would just need to take it home. I just finished the Avocado Eggrolls instead. We were never offered any drink refills by anyone. I had to wave down busboys a few times to help us out in that department. No manager ever came by to apologize for the missing meal. Looking back now, we should have demanded to speak to the manager.  At that point, the ""server"" just wanted to get rid of us. I guess we were interrupting him too much from his women. He wanted us to just pay and leave. We said we would like to have some cheesecake. He begrudgingly took our order. The cheesecake was very good as I remembered it to be. I know this place has been open for over a month, and yes they may still be trying to figure things out. But, you can't have this kind of horrendous staff ""working"" there. Please hire some professionals who are actually interested in doing work.  We won't be coming back here for quite awhile I'm sure. We might get take out and see how that goes, but it's doubtful. I'm thoroughly disappointed with the place. They do have good quality food, but the service is the pits. As for the prices, they are on the higher side, but they do serve large portions. The entrees are usually large enough to take the leftovers home for another meal. In my case for yesterday, I was not given that option since I never received my meal."
Mindy P.,"Covington, LA",0,1,,1.0,9/27/2016,"Got to the restaurant at 5:20. Ordered no appetizers just entrees, after forty minutes we were told our food was coming up. Manager came over and apologized and asked if we wanted anything. Just out good! Ten minutes later waitress brings us each a side salad to hold us over. Sister and brother in-law ordered side salads as their meal side. So thanks for the two free salads. Finally got our food and asked what happened??? Our order was never put in. Manager should have come back and waitress had the nerve to try to get us to order cheesecake! No one in my party will ever go back!!! Horrible management!"
Billy F.,"New Orleans, LA",76,121,44,3.0,9/9/2014,"Not that impressive. I went at about 8:30pm on a Tuesday night and sat at the bar. The bartender was decent. She forgot to give me a napkin, but no biggie. She refilled my water on time and checked on me. The food was very bland. I ordered the chicken & ""biscuits"", even though it only came with one biscuit. The chicken was a little thick, although it was pretty moist. It was just bland. The ""pan drippings/gravy"" was just ok; again bland. The mashed potatoes - excellent! The biscuit was stale. It comes with mixed veggies, but I asked to substitute broccoli. Unfortunately, the broccoli comes covered in mushrooms. I wish I would've known that. I I HATE mushrooms. It also came covered in onions, of which I had no problem. Just not worth $16 in my opinion.  Also, the ads in the menu book are annoying. I'm paying decent money at a restaurant, the last thing I want to see is ads on my menu."
Daniel C.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,,1.0,7/12/2014,"Terrible service. Just terrible. We did not receive any silverware whatsoever for literally 23 minutes after we were seated. App was cold (it sat there while we waited for silverware.) It may have been better hot. Maybe not.  When we finally got silverware, there was only one spoon and a knife was dirty. Really dirty. As in the sauce still on it from last person.  Napkins came ten min later. No joke.  Fries tasted like gross fried fish. This is usually a result of dirty frying oil. Awesome. Pasta was ok. I didn't say it was good. Sandwich was way overly toasted. Some would call that ""burned"". Like me. And you.  I'm tired of reliving how bad the experience was, but I must include this comment: for 80 bucks (we tip well) for dinner for two, we didn't enjoy a single bite. Not one.  I should have learned years ago that just because a place is busy doesn't make it good. Or even passable."
Jane M.,"Northport, NY",15,19,8,4.0,8/5/2014,"What's with all the negative reviews? This is how TCF has been operating for 30+ years. When we lived in NY it was the same story.  You can't just decide on a whim to come here, unless you want to wait an obscene amount of time.  If you're a larger party it's going to take even longer. The later you go the less stuff they'll have.  Don't feel like waiting a long time for a table? Go sit at the bar or the high top tables near the bar. At least this was an option while living in NY.  Sounds like Copelands is sending in some negative reviews ;)"
Leonel P.,"Kenner, LA",3,7,11,4.0,11/2/2014,"Came here for Sunday Brunch and didn't know what to expect. Waited around for 45min to get seated but, worth the wait see definitely. Brunch is Great and I definitely suggest you make Reservations ahead of time if possible. Great for both dates and family atmosphere. I'm going back for sure. Service is great, seating is comfortable, only negative I saw was the wait!"
Shannon S.,"Garden District, New Orleans, LA",348,1780,617,2.0,6/25/2014,"I'm not the biggest fan of chains and generally I think in the New Orleans area we can get far superior food at a much better price than most national chains can provide.  It has been several years since I last ate at a Cheesecake Factory so I caved in and gave the new Metairie location a try (mainly because I was hankering for some cheesecake).  I've eaten at quite a few Cheesecake Factory's across the country from Nevada, Texas and Georgia and they are all pretty consistent as you would expect a chain to be.  As a chain comparison the Cheesecake Factory's food and ambiance is better than an Applebee's but less so than a Houston's. My theory on chains was proven as for my lunch portion of the shepherd's pie, iced tea, and a cheesecake the cost was $25 so I could've just gone to Commander's for a way better experience at a comparable price (that would've also included 25 cent martinis at Commander's so that bonus blows Cheesecake Factory out of the water).   The shepherd's pie was a hamburger patty broken up into the gravy and vegetable mix with mashed potatoes put over the top and while it was ok it was one of the least flavorful shepherd's pies I've ever had and probably one of the least well executed dishes that I've ever had at a Cheesecake Factory.  I had the chocolate mousse cheesecake and it was decent but I've definitely had better cheesecake locally and from Whole Foods.  The real price shocker is that the iced tea was nearly $3 which is ludicrous for plain unsweetened tea.  Their are some definite positives here as they do have a very large menu with a selection of items that should make most people happy.  The staff provided great and friendly service and were literally tripping over each other providing attention to my needs.  Clearly their reputation has proceeded them and there is frequently a large line waiting to be seated at this location as at many of their locations I've seen around the country. Other than the wide selection of cheesecakes and some tasty burgers I'm not sure what would really draw me here on a regular basis and put up with the crowd.  Personally I prefer the food at local establishments and find that at the Cheesecake Factory's price point I can have far better dining experiences elsewhere.  The good news is that now out of town tourists and suburbanites can now have a place to go to and leave my local gems unsullied by their uncouth and overly casual habits so I hope they enjoy waiting in their line."
Natalie S.,"Kenner, LA",0,4,,1.0,12/5/2016,"That moment of horror when you hear about someone finding a bug in their food...well it finally happened to me and it happened in my salad at the Cheesecake Factory.  This was my third time at the restaurant and it will finally be my last.  My husband and I had the crab and artichoke dip, which was good and the waiter was kind enough to bring us more toast because there was no way to eat all that dip with the few toast bites on the plate.  I ordered a tossed salad and was about 10 bites in when I flipped over a piece of lettuce.  There was a brown bug that looked similar to a roach, about the size of a penny, in my salad.  I was grossed out, let the waiter know and he took it away immediately.  I am not one to make a big fuss about stuff..but YUCK!!!  A woman came out, I am assuming a manager, and apologized and offered me free food.  I declined the food because I didn't want to risk the chance of almost eating another animal!  They took the salad off the bill but I was disappointed in how nonchalant they were about the mess.  A hair in food in one thing..but a BUG?  Plus, the croutons were very stale in both mine and my husband's salad.  Thanks, but no thanks and NEVER AGAIN."
Argeau B.,"Slidell, LA",0,47,11,2.0,7/18/2014,"In an attempt to give this new restaurant a fair shake I've eaten here three times. my conclusion at this point is that the managers have hired mentally retarded people as hostesses. When they are not distracted by something shiny or talking to each other about their hair while a line of people wait, they stare at you like a deer in headlights if you destroy their world by requesting a particular empty booth that isn't adjacent to the Tyler Perry family reunion.  the menu is so ridiculously full of every conceivable type of food item under the sun, it makes you wonder if they've got a food replicator from star trek in the back.  and what is up with this bread and frozen packaged butter?  on the plus side, if your 17 year old daughter is finally looking for her first job, have her apply here. it appears cheesecake factory has a waitstaff with zero prior food service experience so she has  a great chance of being hired.  regarding the decor, this place has all the charm of a Roman bathhouse.minus the nice acoustics. as far as the food, the portions are good, the food appears to be fresh and we'll prepared.. theres nothing special here though.. typical Jack of all trades master of none except for the cheesecake which is debatable...  ultimately this is 'mall food' but not in the same class as pf chengs at the other end. people who like outback, olive garden, cracker barrel or red lobster well find the place acceptable if not a tad pricier. in New Orleans this chain will be subject to higher scrutiny.  the boh looks to have their act together, but not the front."
B B.,"Destrehan, LA",3,18,2,1.0,7/8/2016,"Took my daughter to lunch...It was NOT busy, whatsoever. There were plenty of waitstaff standing around, chatting with each other because they obviously had nothing else to do. That being said, we waited 20 minutes for drinks, 40 minutes for an appetizer, then around the 55 minute mark, I received my entrée, which is the same entrée I ALWAYS order bc I'm basic like that, ok? Up until this point, our waiter ONLY came to the table the 3 times he absolutely had to...fcuk me for being thirsty in a restaurant, right?! My entrée, that I have ordered at this and other locations approximately 15 times, was INEDIBLE. It was lukewarm, at best, and tasted like windex smells... I took 2 small bites of the chicken, only taking the second bite to be sure I wasn't mistaken about the awful flavor. The waiter finally returned to our table at an hour and ten minutes. I told him the entrée was inedible. I did not want anything else. I was VERY polite. A manager came over (I did not ask to speak to a manager) and proceeded to address me in a condescending manner and as if I didn't know what I was talking about. I let her know that I ALWAYS order this dish; I know what is supposed to taste like. Again, I was pretty damn polite. The waiter finally brings the bill. The motherf***ing entrée is still on there!!! At this point, our waiter has obviously evolved from his human form into a celestial being that cannot be contained by bricks and mortar bc he has disappeared. I pay the bill and leave zero tip, which I have only done about 3 times in my life bc I.HATE.IT.  We won't be back. RIP Crispy Chicken Costoletta. You never deserved this!"
Ann N.,"Metairie, LA",5,15,3,1.0,7/14/2014,"This will be my first time trying a Cheesecake Factory franchise. My bf and I went there on a Sunday night around 10pm. Place was not crowded. Four hostess was standing in front but did not greet us. I guess standing around talking to each other is more important than acknowledging the customers. Eventually we got seated. We sat there for a good 20 or so minutes with no service. Finally our waitress came by and took our drink orders. Waited another 20 or so minutes for drinks to arrive. So 40mins wasted just to received service and drinks We then ordered calamari appt, French country salad, and ribeye entree.  -Calamari appt was too greasy. Calamari were small and batter too thick. $11.95 -I had the salad appt which was decent. $9.95 -Bf wanted the herb encrusted salmon but was told they were out of salmon for the evening (Really!?!? lame). He order the ribeye instead. Now, I know that ribeye are suppose to have some fat in it but his steak was half meat and half fat!!! $25.95! Wth. His entree is suppose to come with fries but our waitress didn't bring it out until after we both finish eating! Talk about bad service.  Overall, this was a pretty bad dining experience. Terrible service and overpriced mediocre food. Definitely won't be going back and highly Not recommended."
Sara D.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",7,36,15,2.0,6/24/2014,"BLAND! I know that this restaurant is a chain and I had eaten at one many years ago but I don't remember being so disappointed. I stopped in yesterday afternoon for a leisurely lunch and to get a fix for my raging sweet tooth. My husband and I were seated immediately and service was way better than I would have expected for a place that recently opened. 4 stars for service.  The menu is ridiculously large. One page of small plates, two pages of appetizers, one page for salads, one page for pastas, one page for burgers, ect, ect.... What is on the menu is all over the place as well. Want Mexican? You are covered. Italian? Got it; pizza AND pasta. Asian? Plenty of choices. Seafood? Anything you want! Comfort food? But of course, the Cheesecake Factory has it all. With a menu this large though, everything has been toned down in flavor. The crab dip that I had ordered was so lacking, that I almost sent it back. It was crab and flavorless cheese served with hard, toasted bread. I had to swipe some fried onions from my hubby's burger to mix into the dip just so it would taste like something! And there was not enough bread for the amount of dip served.  My husbands burger was just OK. Not good enough to justify the price. He was going to get the chicken and biscuits, but at $17, that seemed a little outrageous. My sandwich was boring as well. I wanted a fancy pants turkey sandwich with a good spread or compote. I got a plain ol' turkey sandwich with wilted lettuce and a grainy slice of tomato and a tiny side salad. How dull, especially considering it was $11. The cheesecake was good, although we did not order the standard ones. Mine was a pineapple upside down cheesecake. Good, but not great, and served with two enormous poofs of awful whipped cream (tasted just like ready whip). His was a lemoncello torte. That was very good, nice and refreshing, however also served with the awful whipped cream and some tasteless strawberries. Tip: do not get the strawberry shortcake. The same tasteless strawberries are used for it. The table next to us ordered that and was complaining about the lack of flavor the whole time.  The set up of the restaurant is weird. There are so many tables crammed into the space; it is very difficult to get around with out knocking into servers, hostesses, the table next to you or other patrons. There should really take out about 20 to 30 of the small tables. I don't think I will go back again. Like I said, service was good, but that was just not enough to make up for the overpriced and incredibly bland food."
William N.,"New Orleans, LA",161,19,4,1.0,2/28/2016,This place is extremely disorganized. The silver was given to us hot and by the fist full.
Ann K.,"Kenner, LA",2,20,5,2.0,7/10/2014,"Way too packed and noisy. The music was very loud, but all you could hear was an unpleasant base line. We couldn't understand the waitress at all. On the other hand, the food was very good. I had their chicken madiera. The chicken and mashed potatoes were great, but there wasn't much asparagus."
