Hong N.,"Raceland, LA",52,2,2,1.0,8/16/2015,"first time ever coming here, the hostess forgot about us.. we ended up waiting over two hours watching countless people being seated before us until I got up & reminded her. she didn't apologize. she simply said ""oh"".  once we were sat, the waitress handed us dirty silverware. we asked her to replace it. she did .. but with another set of dirty ones. the food was fine. definitely not worth the wait. we received our bill shortly after our food. it was like we were rushed in and out. if they wouldn't rush so much, maybe their silverware would be clean, and their customers would be happier.  months pass, we decide to try to give this place another shot. giving them the benefit of the doubt--maybe it was just one bad night. WRONG. we were sat right away this time. the waiter took our order for our beverage. my water was warm and had maybe four cubes of ice in it that melted. the table felt sticky. we waited about an hour.. watching other people receive their meal while we didn't even get bread! my salad was actually decent. the greens and the seasoning were fresh; however, the croutons were soggy. the waiter maybe appeared two or three times during our fine. once to take our order, once to give us warm water and food, then once to give us the bill. it took a good 10 minutes to get his attention for a to go box.  after the second chance, I think that it's safe to say that we will not be returning here. the service is mediocre and the food doesn't make up for it. come here if you want to be rushed for the bill and feel like a burden."
Mathew W.,"Metairie, LA",4,27,1,5.0,6/20/2014,"Went on opening day and I must say that I am BEYOND thrilled about it's new presence in the area. I've eaten at Cheesecake Factory many times before, but this is the first Cheesecake Factory in the tri-state area (Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana). It's in a great location and the dining room is bigger than many other CFs I've been to. As always, the menu selection was amazing and the food that was ordered was flavorful and nicely presented (Dynamite Shrimp, Buffalo Blasts, Greek Salad, Chile Rillenos). Id also add that the service was exactly what I expected: phenomenal. Cheesecake Factory attracts a certain clientele that is sure to really make the area flourish. I really hope this resturant does well and I hope it continues it's success!"
Aaron F.,"New Orleans, LA",92,46,110,4.0,6/18/2014,"Good opening day. Great for business lunches to impress clients. The portions are huge. The waitstaff still needs gone tuning but it was the first day and it was really busy. Hostess were extremely nice. The decor and the menus are fancy. Plenty of seating. It's like any other one, but at least we have one here now. The happy hour deal is great. Still it's a bit on the expensive side. I think I made the first check-in and review."
Robin G.,"Biloxi, MS",4,39,77,5.0,10/11/2014,"Saturday night with excellent service and excellent food. For a party of 2 we did not have to wait for a table at 7 pm. Food and beverages came out at reasonable times and were fantastic.  We ended up purchasing 6 cheesecake slices to take home to family members who loved their prizes. Great experience and was worth the hour and half drive there for the food (we are from biloxi, ms)"
Katie T.,"Metairie, LA",0,11,17,5.0,12/29/2014,"First time ever eating Cheesecake Factory, my boyfriend and I enjoyed it! Got here at rush hour, with a couple of family waiting for a table, hostess told us it was a 10 minute wait and we can leave our phone number and they'll text us when our table is ready. Waited less than 10 minutes. Sat down and our waitress is extremely nice. Ordered Fried Mac & Cheese bites & Louisiana Chicken Pasta. It was both delicious to me. My boyfriend loves the Mac & cheese bites, he thought the pasta was a little hard. I like this place, service is great, food was good, decor is nice, and music was good"
Erin M.,"New Orleans, LA",349,176,,2.0,5/12/2015,"I went here last night with 2 friends.  We sat for a while and no server come to the table, so I just asked the waiter that walked by.  He did get our water orders. The service is just awful.  My friend wanted a Mai-Tai and said they didn't have the alcohol to make it. The waitress comes by with another gal that she was training.  We ordered crab and artichoke dip.  It was ok.  They also brought fresh bread which was decent.  I had the Fafalle pasta.  It had peas.  I am not sure why that was added.  maybe for color, but could be left out.  My friend got the chicken quesadillas.  She said the guac was delicious. My other friend and tomato basil pasta she said it was ok.  She took 2 bites and that was it.  I will not be going back anytime soon!"
Debb W.,"Collierville, Memphis, TN",5,35,7,2.0,11/15/2014,"This was our party of five's first first to a Cheesecake Factory.  Having heard so many good things from friends visiting the Nashville store, we decided to give it a try in NOLA.  What a HUGE disappointment.  First an hour wait for a table - to be expected for a party of five on a Friday night.  We were then overwhelmed by the size of the menu - first red flag!  Any restaurant that tried to do everything, does little very well.  But we quickly ordered the fried mac and cheese balls for an appetizer.  They were very good. Our entrees were huge, but terrible.  I had the bang-bang shrimp and chicken.  All I could taste was toasted coconut.  I even tried pushing the coconut to the side, but then the shrimp and chicken was bland - not the curry flavor I was hoping for.  I could not eat it.  My husband had the Spicy Chicken Cashew.  All he could taste was heat, but little flavor.  If fact, it did not even taste fresh.  One son got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta - again heat, but very little flavor.  My daughter had the Margarita Pizza.  The flavor was OK but it was room temperature when brought to the table.  All four of us could not eat our meals.  The only one that did eat the entire entree was my other son that got the Grilled Ribeye Steak. I will say that our server was great and immediately got the manager when he saw that four of us had barely touched our meals.  The manager had no personality.  Made no apologies except to say that people either love or hate the bang-bang shrimp.  Why serve something that so many people end up hating???  But he did not charge us for the entrees not eaten. Bottom line, go for appetizers and cheesecake, but skip the cafeteria quality entrees.   Signed,  Our first and probably last visit to any Cheesecake Factory."
Natalie L.,"Metairie, LA",33,7,6,1.0,10/16/2015,"We ordered two slices of cheesecake to go, they literally made us wait almost 30 minutes. They kept taking and giving their orders to everyone else. All they needed to do was cut our slices and give them to us. The wait time was ridiculous for what we had asked."
Amber W.,"New Orleans, LA",13,19,109,4.0,7/7/2014,"I decided to come here for my birthday even though I called in advance & was told that they do not take reservations. I was also told that any size group could be accommodated. I came around 6pm with a group of 11 & was told the wait would be 2 hours. We ended up splitting up the group to get seated quicker. I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory before in Houston & San Diego & the food at this location was better than I remembered. We tried ordering 2 different appetizers & was told that they were out of certain ingredients. We ended up getting wontons, hot wings, & spinach dip to share. All were tasty. Everyone enjoyed their meals & drinks & we ordered cheesecake to go. I can see myself coming back but I will wait for the newness to wear off."
Alessandra T.,"New Orleans, LA",0,9,,1.0,11/21/2015,"If you're looking for a restaurant with 5 star service, you definitely won't find it here. I've been to this Cheesecake Factory 3 times thinking that each time the service might get a little better. I was wrong!!!! The servers seem very inexperienced & not knowledgeable of the menu whatsoever. The wait is always a minimum of 20mins & waiting for your food will take 40mins or longer! Horrible horrible service & the food isn't even worth the wait. I suggest you goto Zeas."
Robyn G.,"New Orleans, LA",2,2,1,1.0,7/4/2015,Worst CF experience ever! We were seated for 20 minutes before anyone came to greet us or take a drink order. Two tables around us finished their meals and we were still sitting without service. When Monique finally approached our table she stated she did not see us sitting there! Although she was waiting on the other tables around us. The manager Jason Lopez did not offer help. We decided to take our money elsewhere. Very disappointed!
Leroy O.,"New Orleans, LA",0,5,3,5.0,11/15/2015,The service was fast and the food was outstanding. My wife had fettuccine and alfredo. I had the 5 cheese pasta. Definitely look forward to eating there again.
Maulike A.,"Florissant, Saint Louis, MO",667,48,12,4.0,10/2/2015,"Ordered the  spicy cajun chicken pasta. It was a little over sauced, but good nonetheless. The best part of the meal was that Phillp B. our server did an excellent job. This guy was attentive, didn't have to ask for anything, made sure to check in on how our meal was. Definitely appreciated him being an excellent server."
Tami R.,"Metairie, LA",0,7,1,2.0,5/24/2016,Went there last week and was very disappointed in their food. Very bland not to mention frozen shrimp. So if you order stay away from the seafood
Brad S.,"West Hartford, CT",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2015,Just had the worst chicken salad sandwich  ever.  Mind-blowingly poor and interminably slow service. Waitress asked the manager to come over. He didn't. We will never go here again. Native New Orleanian
Huong H.,"New Orleans, LA",259,95,990,2.0,7/1/2014,Food is okay. A bit salty and worst service ever!
Terry S.,"New Orleans, LA",3,3,13,3.0,12/23/2014,I had the fried catfish and my girlfriend had the nachos the nachos were really good! Yet the catfish didn't have a taste to it so I really didn't enjoy it but the waiter was really cool so I'll be coming again jus not for the catfish lol
Cook A.,"New Orleans, LA",19,6,1,1.0,6/4/2015,"Terrible. After the 40 minute wait on our food to told be they had messed it up, no manager came to check on us. Then after 1.5 hours I had to approach both manager and waitress inquiring as to where my check was, you would think they would have tried to comp a free app or take one of the wrong dishes off the check. Nope. Just got an attitude from BOTH.  Avoid this place if you value your time."
Jennifer S.,"Covington, LA",1,8,7,1.0,10/28/2014,"The server was nice Nd attentive, but the food was bland, and my grilled Chicken Parmesan sandwich came With Semi-raw chicken. Ugh"
Jonathan S.,"Metairie, LA",224,139,,4.0,7/25/2014,"As far as chains go, Cheesecake Factory is tough to beat.  I don't think I've ever had a bad meal there.  I like the avocado egg rolls, the Louisiana chicken pasta, bang bang shrimp, a multiplicity of other things, and any of their cheesecake.  The downside is their service is a little slow."
