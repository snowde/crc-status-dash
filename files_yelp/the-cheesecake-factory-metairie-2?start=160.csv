Tony R.,"Kenner, LA",0,4,,1.0,7/10/2016,"Horrible. Endured over an hour wait for two menu entrees and nothing else. Flatware was filthy. Completely indifferent employees toward the customers. Almond crusted salmon was not almond crusted. In fact, it wasn't crusted at all. Lettuce that was to compliment the salmon, was thrown in a bowl with little else. The entire entree was boring and mostly tasteless. Manager came to the table and apologized, but, nothing else. Here, you can have our place. We won't be back."
Rossana P.,"Guntersville, AL",0,13,,4.0,11/23/2015,"I was hesitant to go here after reading the reviews.  But we decided to risk it, on a busy Friday night.  We already knew there would be a wait, so we took that into consideration.  After a 35-minute wait, we were seated (table of 5).  We only ordered small plates or appetizers, since we wanted to get dessert.  The food was good- no complaints.  Service was good (Jada), there was one instance of having to wait a bit longer than avg.  But it was so busy that it was par for the course. Overall it was a fun experience, with good food and friendly service.  BTW, none of us could finish our cheesecake, in spite of only getting appetizers.LOL."
Wesley D.,"Marrero, New Orleans, LA",0,4,13,3.0,11/21/2014,"Great place for lunch , the goat cheese and beet salad was delicious as were the avocado egg rolls but the menu is way too big over 200 items."
Ryan W.,"New Orleans, LA",204,490,24,1.0,1/18/2015,"Being a national chain, ranked #1 for highest Calorie per serving count, I went in with pretty low expectations; they still fell short of those. After making my way through a short novel of a menu (with advertisements for other businesses in it). I ordered The ""Chicken and Biscuit."" When it arrived, I saw mushrooms on the plate, and being allergic to mushrooms, I asked if there were any in the sauce. The waitress said ""no"" but my allergic reaction just minutes later said otherwise. I do not plan to return."
Samantha L.,"Metairie, LA",274,7,2,2.0,6/28/2014,"Usually not harsh about food but I have not had a poor experience in a while. Started off with the roadside sliders. It was hotter than normal, took the bun off and looked like it came out of the microwave. The meat inside was mediocre. I tried the Mac n cheese burger. The Mac n cheese component is fried. I think if it was hotter it would have been okay. As for the burger, you could tell it was not fresh. I would say the only thing that was enjoyable was the cheesecake. Should this be a place you should bring your family? Probably not. It's super loud and the quality of the food does not meet the standards in terms of price. I'd rather go to Cheesecake Bistro."
Rosemarie G.,"Kings Park, NY",26,29,17,4.0,6/1/2015,The food was the amazing! Service could have been better. But it was Sunday lunch. Odds are our server was probably hung over from the night before
Bentlie L.,"New Orleans, LA",0,4,,1.0,10/8/2015,"Have come here many times, but this last experience was not good. Let's starts with food, I got the eggplant Parmesan and the pasta was undercooked. My boyfriend got the Ribeye medium rare, which came well done. Note both of our entrees were incorrect and a manager was not sent to the table. The atmosphere started great, we sat in the patio, but after other guests left I was surrounded by dirty tables. I don't blame my server for the food issues, but isn't it server 101 to send a manager to the table when there is an issue with an entree? Very disappointed."
Craig B.,"Monticello, MS",21,111,225,3.0,6/5/2015,This place is ok at best. The service was slow and the drinks were watered down badly.  The cheesecake was amazing but this place has got to step up its game on the resturaunt part.
Ashley P.,"San Diego, CA",45,45,17,2.0,5/7/2015,"I was surprised to see such low ratings for a Cheesecake Factory. In CA this is a go-to restaurant for any occasion. After coming for a work lunch with 6 people,  I will never eat at this location again. Rude servers with no sense of urgency and cannot seem to multi task. One person in our party asked to have their app on a separate check. Of course they forgot to. And then they put my cheesecake on a separate check when I reminded to bring it out since I ordered it with my meal. Food was good but with such poor service I do not feel the need to come back. Plenty of other fabulous restaurants in NOLA that offer exceptional food and service."
Lauren C.,"Metairie, LA",66,10,2,1.0,1/4/2015,"Absolutely terrible. Had a gift card so we went on a Sunday night. Tables were so close I got to hear about the experiences in childbirth from the people next to us. Server was an idiot. When I asked if he would recommend the fish tacos he said ""yeah they are good"". I ordered them and they were the most tasteless fish tacos ever. After 2 bites I asked for some salsa or something and he decided to add ""I actually don't eat fish so I really wouldn't know if they were good"". My husband's pork chop was raw and under-everythinged!  As we waited for our check I noticed that every other table had a nice basket of bread at their table. When I asked the server if we would need to ask for bread for our table, he responded ""the kitchen takes like a million and six years to put it out so most of the time you don't get any, but you want some in a box to take home?""  Seriously, this place is awful. The table setup is the worst, the food is sub-Applebees quality and the service is....well, what service....?  WILL NEVER GO BACK AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND."
Tiffani A.,"Oakland, CA",24,43,8,1.0,1/1/2015,"You guys need to get your seating under control. Everyone was told it was a 15-20 minute wait this was regardless of the number of ppl in their party. The wait was over 40 minutes. People were walking out. It wasn't until ppl complained and pointed out that there were a number of empty tables in plain view of customers. A manager that was already in the seating area was able to immediately get ppl seated. This location has been open long enough and is always crowded no matter what state, so this should not still be a glitch with a new location."
Dana J.,"Metairie, LA",95,8,6,4.0,11/7/2014,"I finally stopped in at the latest Factory to open their doors. Dining alone I had no problem dodging the wait at the door and opted for the mostly empty bar. It's been a while so I picked up the book on the bar to find out it was their menu. Just kidding,  I knew the menu was extensive just making fun of how extensive. Carly behind the bar easily guided me telling me where to look, by page number no less, for what I was in the mood for. I asked her favorite burger and she mentioned the Americano(sp) burger which I happily went for with a side of sweet potato fries. I also started with a side salad as I felt really piggish today. Since I'm in the industry I had several questions which Carly was more than happy to answer. As we were talking I told her I work just down the street. That's when she informed me we had actually met when she was having dinner at my establishment.  The salad and burger was everything I was expecting. However, I would have like a little more time between the salad and burger. The burger arrived before I really had begun to tackle the salad.  The gluttony continued after the burger with a piece of upside down pineapple cheesecake.  Needless to say I'll be walking this meal off for the next few days.  Overall it was a great lunch. I will definitely be back for another burger and cheesecake once my pants fit again. Thanks again Carly."
Caroline M.,"Metairie, LA",3,23,16,2.0,2/27/2015,"I've been to several CCF in the country and have had plenty of great experiences from them all. As a matter of fact, never a bad one until CCF in Metairie . I don't even know where to begin from the long wait, dirty silverware ( twice in same visit !) , no bread baked to offer before meal , out of several menu items that my husband and I wished to have, and then as we leave there's puke in the outdoor wait area. The food was mediocre. Service not bad but not great . And the only thing I will say that is worth getting here is s dessert to go bc they are made in a factory somewhere else. This location has ruined my love for CCF. Maybe it's a good thing . All these chain restaurants are good for is taking your money and delivering mediocre chemical and sugar  filled dishes."
Melissa O.,"Pace, FL",53,6,5,1.0,10/17/2015,"We walked in last night 35 minutes before close. The bartender was not happy. She had the worst attitude it was apparent she was no longer in the mood to do her job and provide good service. The food was fine. Nothing great but we just wanted a quick burger after a long night. We left 7 minutes after the restaurant closed. We weren't planning on staying all night, even if we had been welcome. Worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever."
Amanda M.,"Metairie, LA",74,6,2,1.0,10/27/2014,"When the server flirts with your boyfriend and pays you NO mind; makes me never want to come back.also, when they refill his drink within 3 minutes without even asking and then forgets my drink TWICE. I sat there with a empty drink for at least 25 minutes"
Mari W.,"New Orleans, LA",50,4,8,2.0,4/11/2016,"I have been here twice. First time went pretty smooth, but everything was a terribly long wait. Second time? A nightmare. Seated quickly, waited on quickly, drinks came quick and always stayed full. App was delicious, although pricey. We got the meatball garlic bread. Our entree was where it went downhill. My Husband's porkchops came and looked delicious. My carbonara came and smelled delicious. But the carbonara tasted like nothing but grease. Im not one to send food back, so i was going to try to eat it, but I just couldn't. It was awful. Well, the floor manager came up to apologize that my husband's side of corn had taken nearly 30 minutes, and thats when i told him i couldn't eat my meal. He gladly convinced me to choose something else, which i choose the parmesan crusted chicken. I got it fairly quickly, and soon after my husband finally got his corn, which was bland as hell. My new meal was delicious, but i felt too disgusted to eat. Ordered 2 slices of cheesecake, which are pretty dense and oversized. After all was said and done, 2 hours and $100 later, I dont think I will be back. The price just isnt worth it the trouble, but the server and floor manager being so polite and wonderful made it almost bearable."
Bankyy C.,"New Orleans, LA",0,1,,1.0,3/31/2016,Cheesecake need to close there doors when they suppose to because if we gonna be let in just for you to make the order you should be rush to order wether you take and hour or not just say your closed yall close at 12:30 if i dont order till 1:15 you shouldnt get upset just tell customers you are closed pls thx
Camille P.,"New Orleans, LA",103,131,89,4.0,11/8/2014,The cashew chicken was very good and the serving size was generous.  But the highlight of my evening here was the red sangria. The waiter Errol warned me of its deliciousness I thought he was upselling. But he was looking out! I could bathe in that stuff!
Amelia R.,"Kenner, LA",94,71,6,3.0,1/14/2015,Food is great if you know what to order service is typically sub par little attention is given to the table. On our last visit we weren't even brought the bread that comes with our meal and it took roughly 12 minutes to get a water refill and the place wasn't even very busy at all.
Natalie B.,"Navarre, New Orleans, LA",15,3,,4.0,8/27/2014,"I've been here 3 times since their opening and although the service still needs improvement the food is great. It's a brand new restaurant still working out the kinks and I think they're doing amazing. So far I've had the Chicken Medura....to die for! I've also had the Eggplant Sandwich, Skinny Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Crab and Artichoke Dip which were all very good. I've tried the guacamole and Skinny Enchiladas which I wouldn't recommend. I also had many of the cheesecakes including the carb conscious -made with Splenda- amazing!!! If your in a hurry or looking for superior service they aren't there yet but good food they have that :)"
