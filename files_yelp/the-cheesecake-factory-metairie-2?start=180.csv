Sohaira M.,"New Orleans, LA",262,29,13,5.0,7/28/2014,"Not big on chains but... it's new in Metairie and we figured why not?! The menu is great!! Theres like 10 pages of different stuff you can get. Everything looks and sounds amazing. My inner fat kid loves it. :-) Today I went with my daughter, best friend and her daughter. Our appetizer was the crab and artichoke. Heavenly!! Children had grilled cheese w fruit on the side. Fruit as a side.. great idea! My spicy chicken sandwich was good. Server was very nice. I'd recommend this place."
Sam S.,"League City, TX",22,31,101,1.0,10/4/2014,"I'm actually shocked that this was the worst experience I've ever had with a Cheesecake Factory ever!!!! This service was Blah! The food was even worst! Almost ever order we had was wrong, and things went extremely slow! Maybe because it's the only one in the city and surrounding areas. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING!!!!"
Eric D.,"Austin, TX",7,73,5,2.0,10/26/2014,"This was the worst Cheesecake Factory that I have ever experienced. It felt like nobody cared and the morale was low.  Walked into an empty reception, sat at the bar for dinner, and waited 8 min for someone to appear behind the bar to serve.  When I got my drink, my glass was dirty.  When I asked for a clean one, the bartender replied that they all looked that way, probably because the sanitizer was getting low.  Found me a clean one though.  The food was ok, not your typical delicious meal that you have at most other Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Was never asked how the meal was...  When I paid my bill and left, not one word of thanks for coming in, have a good night, etc.  Guess the football game on TV was more important than a paying customer.  Management needs to step up and make some improvements to the team and customer service here."
Flora S.,"Metairie, LA",0,12,,2.0,1/1/2016,"This is a hit or miss dining establishment.  Today was a miss.  Service was ok however, could have been much better.  Husband's dishes, clam chowder soup and garlic pasta were both tasty and came out on time. That was the hit.  My Mother's and my dish, both egg dishes came out late and cold. (Nothing worst than cold eggs that are supposed to be served HOT). Also the bacon was served cold. This was the miss.  My husband's dish came out first and ours 10 minutes later and cold at that. You would think that if the restaurant has a plate runner, the dishes would come out at least hot. What about the time gap.  We had the same plate runner and the waitress didn't respond to anything other than make excuses as the restaurant was busy.  This place needs to get their act together. Every time we dine here, at least once every other week,  we notice that most of the waiters and waitress are new.  We've had some good ones in the past, but every now and then we get one that is clueless. Why can't the kitchen turn out a tables food all at the same time. I've noticed other tables experiencing the same problem.  Please get on track as we like your restaurant however, with over 1,400 other restaurant in our area, if this continues and the problems not addressed, we will not be returning to your restaurant. Good Luck!"
Natalie C.,"Warehouse District, New Orleans, LA",9,10,1,2.0,7/31/2014,"My family and I came here for day 2 of national cheesecake day and we got here at 8... It is 10:15 and we are still here. I ordered the smokehouse burger which was good . That was the only thing appealing to me on the menu. My husband ordered some type of chicken sandwich and it was burnt so we just took it off the menu. All and all I won't be retuning here, but on another note the place was beautiful"
Amani J.,"Saint Bernard, LA",65,26,24,5.0,7/2/2015,I honestly dont get why this place does not have 5 stars. My husband and I go here for our anniversary. We went last year and it was amazing and today we went and it was still amazing. When we went last year it wasnt as busy as today but the service was still really good. We had macarroni cheese bites and crab & artichoke dip which was amazing! For dinner we both had a pasta dish. Mine was a louisiana pasta dish and my husband had garlic noodles with shrimp. For desert we took home the 30th anniversary cheesecake and the chocolate mousse cheesecake. We were so full from dinner that we had to take it home. I was impressed with how smoothly everything was running considering how busy they were. The wait wasnt but 5 minutes and were greeted by our waitor within 5 minutes who appoligized for the wait even though it wasnt that long. Everyone there worked very well togeher which made it a great experience. I would say this is probably one of my favorite restaurants. We will be back next year for our anniversay dinner. Hopeully before then...
K B.,"New Orleans, LA",1,35,6,5.0,8/16/2014,Husband and I ordered the spinach & cheese dip and the crab wontons for apps. Really good. Spinach needed a lil salt but otherwise good. Nice size portions to share. For entree I had the Jamaican black pepper shrimp. It was so good!! Husband had the herb crusted salmon and shrimp scampi. The scampi was a bit spicy with garlic but good. The salmon was good but rather small. There was a good selection of wine also. For dessert we had the red velvet cheese cake. It was so good!!! Service wasn't bad either waitress was really attentive. The wait however was an hour but not surprised for a Saturday evening. Killed it by walking around the mall. Overall we were satisfied. Definitely returning!
Phillip P.,"Five Points, Denver, CO",20,9,1,4.0,9/22/2014,"This place is getting a bad rep from when they first opened and were slammed. I suggest you ignore the bad comments from then and go try it. If you like Indian cuisine at all, the chicken samosas are a great small plate to start off. The turtle cheesecake is one of my favorites out of the huge selection that I've barely had a chance to work through."
Fred H.,"Saraland, AL",0,1,,3.0,7/26/2014,"6th visit. Happy with food as always. Service is still not good. Too long to wait for food. Servers have been very nice, but can be slow and not well trained.  Still early in the game though. Lots of improvement needed but will definitely be back."
Gary R.,"Glen Burnie, MD",1,35,17,3.0,12/27/2014,This place is really busy. Seating is the biggest issue. You can see a lot of open tables but are told there is a 30 min wait. I like the pasta carbonara because I like bacon. Strong smoke taste. The add-ons are expensive for what you get. $5 for four shrimp is really pricy. The value for your money isn't in the food. It's more for the atmosphere.
Katie L.,"Metairie, LA",14,11,6,3.0,8/17/2014,"I wasn't too impressed with this restaurant. We had a large party of 7. I expected to wait awhile for a table, which we did. While we waited we enjoyed a piña colada on the patio enjoying company, which were excellent    We were then seated in a large booth with a chair at the end. I was like okay we have a seat and can order. Well I didn't know I was going to play server all night. I sat in the middle and was passing food and drink, plates and trash back and forth all night. The plates when they came out were on fire with no assistance I had to pass not one but 2 hot plates, which burned my hands, that didn't even phase the waitress. Who ever designed the layout and seating arrangements of this restaurant certainly didn't have large parties in mind.    The food was good. No complaints. The service was subpar. I ordered a plate to go for someone else when I ordered our entrees thinking it was taken care of. When I asked for our check and the to go plate I was told ""oh I forgot, we are out of the Cuban sandwich."" Really, it takes you over an hour to tell me that. This is in excusable, especially with her mannerisms. Also to get a refill on our drinks was apparently unheard of at this restaurant. It took from appetizers to dessert in order to get a refill. The servers seem to be understaffed and their service shows.    Food and drinks were slow to come out, the food a little over priced, and the wait time from the time you get in to the time you get out is a little excessive. Will think twice before eating here again."
Cali K.,"New Orleans, LA",0,10,1,1.0,9/13/2014,"This is my second time coming here and the service  is horrible yet again.  I understand that this restaurant opened fairly recently,  but it's been here long enough to work out the links. The bread is always hard, you have to request side plates and my order was incorrect,  so that added onto out wait time. We have waited well over 45 minutes to receive our meal and it's not that crowded. When our meal came out it is nothing like it should've been and I've ordered the same thing from CF all over the U.S. I will NEVER COME BACK! HORRIBLE...."
Chris H.,"Derita, Charlotte, NC",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2015,Worst dining experience EVER!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for ruining my Father's Day 2015!!!!!!! Total incompetence!!!
Karen L.,"Plantation, FL",0,20,,2.0,10/3/2015,"Very disappointed in our server, Andrew, and the manager.  Food was okay; however, we had an issue with our togo order.  Ordered a burger to go and the waiter made the decision that we did not want fries since they get cold and most people do not want fries.  When asked, the waiter said well most people do not want them.  Let that be my decision.  The manager was not much better when he approached the table and said ""I understand you are upset you did not get fries.""  Do not think that was why I was upset.  We waited for 30 minutes for the burger and then not to be asked if we prefer fries or a salad and the server decide for us.  Highly disappointed in Cheesecake Factory and more disappointed in the way the situation was handled."
Blaba B.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2014,"This was truly the worst restaurant experience I ever had. Hostess was extremely lazy and rude and was just standing there gossiping with another hostess (there wasn't a wait time or anything). When she finally seats me, she just flings the menu my way. NOT A WORD. It took about 15 MINUTES to be acknowledged by my server and only because I stood up and asked one at random ""who is my server?"". Turns out, she is my server. She passed by my table so many times by the way, and not so much a glance came my way. She very nonchalantly said ""Oh, it's me. What do you want?"" like it was normal for a customer to approach her just to get a freaking glass of water.  I completely understand when a restaurant is busy and the service is slow. But when you see your server just stand there talking and laughing with her coworkers while dishes are piling up everywhere and people are waiting for their checks, it is extremely off-putting.  Worst service. Employees lack common decency."
Aimee S.,"River Ridge, LA",10,1,,1.0,8/22/2014,"Came here for late dinner (after 10pm). Bathroom was disgusting & out of toilet paper. Two of the menu items that I ordered were not available. Pretty slow service. Food was fair. Cheesecake was the only good thing here. Used restroom before I left, still disgusting. Tried to wash my hands & there is no longer water running in the bathroom. This place is awful."
Angela M.,"New Orleans, LA",5,2,1,1.0,8/17/2014,"I came here for a bday dinner for a friend,  and waited for over an hr for a table when we were told 25 mins. After being seated we waited another hour for our food. Which was brought out sporadically.  One of our friends had already finished her meal before I got mine. We ordered cheesecake for the ""birthday boy"" and they gave us a list of cheese cake they were currently out of. The whole dinner was almost 4 hours!!! We were here so long we went through 2  servers....Both of them were nice, but over all the whole experience was unorganized and frustrating.  I will not be back."
Alan J.,"Metairie, LA",0,26,4,1.0,7/10/2014,I was hoping for at least an edible meal but it was just as expected. Food was awful.  They try to make up for the poor quality by giving you hundreds of choices. The menu was 21 pages. No kidding.  The only good thing was the basic cheesecake.
Michael F.,"Houston, TX",47,6,,3.0,7/7/2014,This is a very new restaurant that needs to  improvement on a lots of things be compare to the other Cheesecake Factory  hopefully after being open over a month or two the will get better work out  the kinks but so far after being open only two weeks the staff and management & cooks has to get better with more training but the food i got was good with the  crab spinach dip Nice pricing I Will Go Back just to if they have gotten better to point where everything flows naturally after about open   Ps. We when for late dinner and the wait to be seated to a table was like 5 min.not bad After Essence weekend
Chino G.,"Metairie, LA",0,2,,2.0,9/27/2014,"Long wait for a new restaurant is pretty much the norm around here, but it took an hour and a half before we got our food or even any bread for that matter.  Only two sets of utensil for four people and the waiter must have found forks somewhere as he dropped off four and then disappeared again.   Ordered the baked potato soup and you could smell and taste that it was burned. Still no napkins or drink refills. Really really disappointed. The cheesecake factory's in Houston are not this bad.  The manager did come out and offer to get me something else on the house, but at this point I'm so frustrated and its so late (10:30pm) i just didn't care for anything else. Only reason this review gets two stars."
