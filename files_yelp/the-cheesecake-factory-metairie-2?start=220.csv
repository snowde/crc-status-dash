Helen S.,"New Orleans, LA",45,6,1,1.0,7/30/2014,"I was really looking  forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory since I've been to one years ago and loved it, I waited for a month and a half to go by so it wouldn't be insanely busy and picked a Wednesday after the lunch rush at 1:30, but there was still a 50 minute wait! It took us two hours from the time we got there until we got our food, I had an appointment and had to get my food put straight into a box waited another 15 minutes before they brought me dessert and when I got to my appointment and finally got to eat my food it was awful, don't order the fish tacos! Never going back! Way overpriced, food not great, service is a mess! There are so many better choices in this city for great food don't waste your time on this chain!!!"
Courtney F.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,11,,1.0,2/3/2015,Cheesecake Factory is different and disappointing. Something has changed since they opened and it isn't a place I would recommend anymore. Much better local options available!
A. B.,"Metairie, LA",0,6,,2.0,1/13/2016,"This place is a hit or miss. Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The place wasn't packed and we were seated quickly. Our waiter came and got our drinks. Our complimentary bread took forever getting to us, but when it did, it was warm. I ordered Steak Diane medium. When I got the steak, the outside was burnt and when I cut into it, it was super dry. When our waiter came and asked if everything was okay, I asked for steak sauce. I usually don't eat steak sauce but I was hoping it would help with the dryness...nope. I stopped eating and when our waiter came back, he asked if I needed a box. I asked him if they could make this meal again since my steak was dry, the waiter goes, ""I came by and asked if everything was okay earlier."" Dead silence. Then he went to get the manager. The manager came over and I explained to her what happened. Everything was fine till the steak came out, I ordered medium and it was well done. She explained that since the steak was cut in small portions, the steak gets dry fast. Um, okay. I told her I usually eat my steak well but ordered my steak medium in case they cooked it too well. I cut the rest of the steak on my plate to show her how super well done it was. Also, I told her I didn't want to complain to the waiter so I asked for steak sauce hoping that would help me finish the steak. She wasn't rude and offered to make me a new plate, which I did take upon that offer. I was surprised by the waiter and manager's excuses to my problem before handing it a better way. I had 80% of food on my plate before I complained, its not like I ate everything and said something. We skipped out on dessert and went elsewhere."
Amanda M.,"New Orleans, LA",39,42,16,4.0,7/18/2014,"Went here last night and it was the the good ole Cheesecake Factory I'm used to. I usually don't like to eat at chains since I moved to New Orleans but I made an exception. There isn't much healthy on their 25+ page menu but most everything I've ever had at a CF is pretty tasty!!  I got a frozen peach Bellini to drink and it was so yummy, I want another one right now! Our table split the fried Mac-n-cheese balls as an appetizer and they were pretty good. I had a salad for my entree since I knew I would be ordering cheesecake. The portions are huge here! I took half my entree and half my dessert home and had a whole other meal. I had the lemon raspberry cheesecake and it was sweet and really tart. It was sooo good. There are definitely better places to eat in New Orleans but if you want to eat at a good chain restaurant with literally dozens and dozens of entree options this is your place. Not to mention they probably have 50 different cheesecakes."
Gretchen G.,"Metairie, LA",0,50,,2.0,8/23/2014,"Completely and Totally NOT Impressed!  I hope this is still new restaurant kinks.  The food was pretty good, and I would probably return for it.  The service was worse than terrible and will probably keep me from returning.  Our waitress completely ignored us.  We had to get a menu that was left on another table.  We had one for 3 people and she wondered why we weren't ready to order when she was.  I had to ask for silverware.  She brought it.  Then I had to ask for napkins, and she acted like I was asking for something special.  Still waiting for the sweetener for my tea.  Never saw her during our meal so no drink refills or cheese for my son's pasta.  The crowning blow was the cheesecake we took to go.  She changed my son's order and brought something different than what he ordered.  Note to wait staff, when in doubt, ask the customer exactly what they want.  Don't just assume and bring what you think they want.  The cheesecake department is heavy on the nuts.  They seem to put them on everything, note to those with allergies.  Also, be prepared to wait when you go.  The line tonight was a doozie.  We have eaten in the Cheesecake Factory in other places and have enjoyed it.  I hope this one steps it up as I would like to go again."
Troy D.,"Metairie, LA",1,14,,2.0,7/18/2014,"Food may be good (for a chain restaurant); however, service is horrible.  No silverware on table. Very slow to get drinks and take order. Even slower to get food.  Everything is a wait."
J L M.,"New Orleans, LA",0,16,,3.0,9/3/2014,"The food was great!!!  It missed 5 stars because of the very poor service and wait time for our food.  Our waiter Cory K was attentive at first, then he pretty much left us high and dry.  We had to ask for water a couple of times.  When we asked for some additional condiments, it took forever to get them.  I asked for ranch dressing and he never delivered it.  By the time it came, I was done with my meal.  I do have to say that there was one woman server that was doing her best to make things right.  I only wish I knew her name.  She was great!!!  Now a comment on the ""leave your name and we'll call you""process.  We put in our name and waited at the bar.  After 20 minutes or so, we were called to the front.  We thought we'd be seated right away, but NO!  We had to wait for all the others they had called before us before we got seated.  We stood there for nearly 10 minutes with our cocktails in hand.  I would have much preferred to be seated at the bar until they were really ready to seat us.  Not sure if we will be going back.  There are so many other great 5 star restaurants to eat in NOLA."
Skr S.,"New Orleans, LA",0,4,,1.0,4/26/2015,"ew not cool. i got the bbq ranch chicken salad and found fried calamari among my onion rings. so grossed out, how does that happen? someone needs to inspect their kitchen"
Rachel C.,"Metairie, LA",0,1,,5.0,6/22/2014,"I have been to cheesecake factory many times (forida girl) and have been waiting for them to come here since ive moved here . Glad they finally did cause their food is amazing. Its a great place to choose when no one can decide on what to eat , since they have a little bit of everything, also the cheesecakes are delicious , cheesecake bistro does defenitley not compare. Dont let price be an issue ,,. Its worth it."
Skylar C.,"Metairie, LA",0,5,,2.0,8/7/2014,"We have now eaten here twice, and both times turned out to be a disaster. The first time, we had lunch here. Our waitress was incredibly slow and inattentive. We waited for nearly an hour and a half for our food to come out. When we complained, the manager kindly told us that our food had been sent to another table by accident. (lol nice try. the waitress forgot to put our order in, but ok.) So after another 25 minutes, we received our entrees and a bill for the entire meal. Classy. Wanting to give it another try, considering the large menu, we decided to go for dinner this time. To begin with, we arrived at 9:20pm. Due to the incredibly slow service, we did not leave the restaurant until 12:35am. (how was this possible, by the way? Your restaurant was at about 30% capacity and you had more waiters and bussers running around than I've ever seen in any other place. Seriously....) Anyways, after being seated and handed menus by the hostess, we waited..... and waited.... and waited some more until finally, after about a half an hour, I got up to ask the hostess where our waitress was. Cut to 10 minutes after that when a girl who had passed us about 50 times before came walking up to our table apologizing because ""she didn't know it was her table."" sigh..... I decided to order this incredible eggplant sandwich, which turned out to be the least incredible thing I've ever consumed. It was practically oiled up, chewy eggplant with about two pounds of cheese on top of it and thrown on a soggy bun so that when you go to take your first bite, everything falls out and you're left with a pile of $12 slop. The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the cheesecake is good. Also, $7.25 for a beer? REALLY?"
Nola P.,"Elmwood, LA",1,44,,2.0,9/23/2014,"I'm sad to give this Cheesecake Factory two stars. We are from Boston and currently live in New Orleans. Unfortunately, this place sucks! Not so much the food but the staff is completely a mess. We came in and  sat down waited 15 minutes for someone to approach us.The manager came up and apologized and took our order and we finally got our appetizer. Then we realized we waited longer than usual for our main dish. The waitress comes up and asks us what we were waiting for? We then realized we were sure they did not put our main dish order. It's like wow really! I come up to the manager and she looks embarrassed. We decided to leave because this was just freaking terrible and beyone unprofessional. As much as we love the Cheesecake Factory we will never go back to this location. It was our 6th time coming back and we were hoping the service would get better but it seems to get worse. We are moving back home in a few months and will go back to the Boston locations. Besides the terrible service it's always dirty under the tables. French fries and left over pieces of food on chairs as well. They need better training."
