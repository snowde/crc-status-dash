Gabe R.,"Chalmette, LA",89,560,156,2.0,3/30/2016,"This is not the place that Leonard and Sheldon go on Tuesday nights and Penny waits on them.  This place is waaaaaaay busier and much louder.   Ok so the server starts us off with free bread.  3 different styles of bread which were pretty good but came with cold butter.  WHY do restaurants do this?  You can't spread cold butter!!!  Anywho.  I started to look at the menu and was instantly overwhelmed.  It has more pages than the King James bible!   My daughters ordered their food and then I felt rushed so I just ordered 2 apps.  I got the Tex-Mex eggrolls that were ok but got kind of greasy and a chicken quesadilla.   Again just ok.  The girls seemed to like their food.   We then ordered cheesecake which is good.  I got the banana something or other and it was...banana-y.   There is every kind of food imaginable here which usually means they do no one thing great.  I believe that to be true.  The place is always packed and there is always a wait, and it's not worth waiting for in my opinion.  It's also really expensive.  I know I got dessert but lunch for 1 adult and 2 teens shouldn't cost over 100.00 in a place like this."
Larean N.,"Gretna, LA",8,10,28,5.0,12/19/2016,Food was delicious.  I had the almond crusted Salmon salad and my friend had the Bang bang chicken and shrimp.  Bothe were delicious! !
Joseph P.,"Marrero, LA",116,6,,1.0,6/16/2017,Unattentive waiter unknowledgeable manager ; whole party did not receive food. My sisters recital celebratory dinner was ruined. If I could leave zero stars I would !
David W.,"New Windsor, NY",30,14,4,4.0,1/16/2017,"We were supposed to go to Juan@s flying burrito, but of course the wife wanted Cheesecake Factory. Well that was a huge mistake the Mexican lettuce wrap was awful. It was bland, the chicken was rubbery, they forgot the avocado. We had to send it back it did look good. I did have the sausage flatbread with feta cheese and bacon, and that my friends was the bomb! For the main course I had the Chopped Cobb salad. The flavor was pretty good and the salad had no avocado. What's the deal with the avocado? Lol! The cheesecake of course always great! Our server did an awesome job."
James D.,"Elmwood, New Orleans, LA",0,27,10,2.0,6/24/2017,"Expensive for what it is, overwhelming menu, decor is less exciting than other Cheesecake Factories I've been to.  Service was exceptionally slow, and waitress offered to sub a salad which actually meant she charged me for a full side salad in addition to the cost of my item, which is not ""swapping,"" as far as I am concerned.  Took waitress 15 minutes to show up and another 15+ minutes to bring the beverage.  Took a half hour to be offered bread.  Got chicken, which was decent, but I had to cut it with a spoon since I didn't have a knife and waitress was never around to ask if I needed anything.  Do appreciate that they have specials and a ""light options"" menu, and overall it was clean.  Thank goodness I had a gift card to waste.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have come and am definitely not going to return."
Dylan M.,"Lake Forest, IL",254,479,2357,1.0,2/17/2016,"I have been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant or 5 in my day and generally really enjoy them. I'd  go as far to say they are my favorite chain restaurant. BUT... this location is severely lacking on all fronts. When I walked in the door, no wait the hostess was off in space and then started screaming at a woman across the way...over and over ""MISS LORETTA MISS LORRETTA"" who also apparently was good at ignoring people so the hostess was forced to do her job a seat us. The restaurant was pretty empty so we had a choice of seats but the hostess tries to put us right in front of the bathroom. I kindly said would it be possible to sit away from the bathroom and she said oh..how about here...the table also next the the bathroom on the other side of the entrance. I wuzzz like ummmm is there a difference???UMMM AAAWWAAAYY from the bathroom in your empty restaurant pahleezzz.  Next our waiter greated us and was nice although the drinks seemed to have been forgotten a few times and we got that look from him (you know the one) ohh YEAHH...their drinks.  That nice.. yet forgetful attitude carried it's way thru the meal.  Finally the veggie melt I ordered came out and half the ingredients such as avocado, goat cheese artichoke, roasted red peppers were not on the sandwich and I guess they figured they could just put mushroom, zucchini and bell peppers instead. Not that it couldn't be a nice sandwich but I hate mushrooms and it's not what the ingredients listed on the menu were. I went and grabbed a menu and showed the waiter what I had ordered and showed him the sandwich. He was like Ohhh did u want them to remake it? Yes..yes I do. 30 minutes went by and no sandwich and finally just told him I needed to go. A manager of sorts came by to apologize and said he would bring the sandwich right back to go and take it off the bill  I said ok. 10 more minutes the waiter comes back and hands us the bill but still no sandwich. Finally got it and left and went home. Checked the box when I got home and although it was closer to the menu description it was still not as described on their menu.  I even mentioned it was my birthday and you would think maybe they would do a little something to make it a little less horrible. NOPE! Id hate to see how this branch operates when they are actually busy. They defiantly need to work on things. Happy birthday to me!!"
Typmoe M.,"Atlanta, GA",22,45,65,4.0,4/10/2016,I would have to say good food and good service on Friday. April 8th 2016.  Our waiter Andrew B. Was pleasant and very attentive.  The red crush grapefruit cocktail was wonderful out dinner plates were delicious the Thai salmon with rice was good.. The rice good have been cooked a little longer.  My husband and daughter enjoyed their dinner. And we all shared a lovely cheese cake with fresh strawberries.
Hoa K.,"New Orleans, LA",252,289,1540,4.0,7/31/2015,"We were greeted upon entering this establishment.  Put on the waiting list with our phone number so we can recieve a text when table is ready.  I like that! I always lose that black pager thing. Rather than wait to be seated on this busy night of National Cheesecake Day, we opted to stroll to the bar and take our seats amongst the ever drinking crowd.  Mind you, I got Strawberry Creamsicle which comprise of purée strawberries, vanilla icecream, vodka and amerreto.  Topped with a whipped topping and a whole strawberry!  Like a spiked-up milkshake! Yummy!  For my meal, I went with a Grilled salmon with mash potato and broccoli. Sure I could have gotten it from the skinnylicious menu with would be fish and vegatables (tomatoe and green beans) but nah...I'm out and about already... Might as well get something good. Salmon was good and doesn't lack flavor esp after the squirt of a lemon wedge! Love homemade mash potato but no gravy.  Broccoli was bland but when eaten with the salmon, it balanced.  We didn't receive bread which was sad.  But I got cheese cake for half price and took them home! Yay!!   Will update on the cheesecakes I ate lol. Be back for more cheesecake later!"
Anthony B.,"Biloxi, MS",195,22,34,5.0,5/19/2017,"I love this place! It's called the Cheesecake factory for a reason. If you visit here try any of their cheesecake, literally, any of them. They are to die for! The waiters and waitresses here are friendly the cooks are superb, and the food is amazing. I came here late before they closed at 12am. They never rushed me out. The food is really pricey but you get what you paid for which is a good thing ! The servings are generous and the atmosphere is very intimate. You have to try their four cheese pasta. It's REALLY good and end it off with a cheesecake of your liking. They have  many selections of different types of foods like really, a book for items! They offer bread as complimentary before your entree, and the bread is hands down amazing as well ! You wont be disappointed visiting this cheesecake factory, or any other cheesecake factory! 5/5."
Linda Rose L.,"Harvey, LA",86,3,,1.0,5/24/2017,OMG this place so bad service had my daughter graduation dinner and the waiter was so rude came there at 8:30 didn't get our drinks til 9 we didn't get to order til 9:45 so finally the food came at 10:30 and they forgot my brother food had to wait another 30 mins for it horrible service forreal . Never going back
Latasha L.,"New Orleans, LA",1,20,8,3.0,1/21/2017,"The food was ok, the waitress was sweet. However the food was slow to come out and the waitress completely forgot about us for about 25 minutes. We spoke with a manager and she moved things along faster for us. I also hate that the prices are available for everything on the menu except for the drinks. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."
Maria R.,"Mandeville, LA",0,3,,1.0,5/20/2017,"Service was horrible!!! Waiter was rude and in attentive. Steak was overcooked, missing items from our order, glass in our drink and he didn't seem to care. Just a horrible experience from beginning to end. Will never come back"
Kacy S.,"Houston, TX",45,42,4,2.0,6/11/2016,"Worst service of any Cheesecake Factory I've ever experienced. We came in at 9 pm. 15 minutes later I flagged down a busser to order drinks. Our appetizer was cold. We've been waiting 40+ minutes for our entree. (Still no dinner or explanation so far) I don't know if the staff is lazy or just doesn't care. I worked for Cheesecake in FL 10 years ago; I remember my training to this day. I don't know that these folks were trained the same way. The food was tasty, but only eat here if you have 2 hours to waste and you possess the patience of a saint."
Bob H.,"Metairie, LA",0,1,,1.0,5/12/2017,Awful service for decent food Culture problem w poor management and zero oversight Will not ever return
Savannah Lynn S.,"Mobile, AL",59,5,1,1.0,10/7/2016,"You can see the pic of my ""chicken bellagio"". I drove 2.5 because I was craving it. It had no arugula.... Like what??? And the ""prosciutto"" was two huge hunks of nasty fatty tough ham... Really bad food."
MyLinh H.,"New Orleans, LA",60,53,390,4.0,3/13/2015,"During today's lunch, service was on point and pastas we ordered came out delicious!  It's a very convenient location since girls get hungry post-shopping!  On other occasions, service was not good. Once on a Friday night, I believe the kitchen ran out of several appetizers and other entrees we wanted. Like uh, really? And it was just not a good dining experience.  I'm glad today's lunch went well and I will visit again."
Becca D.,"Metairie, LA",107,10,2,1.0,2/14/2017,"Awful service. Period. We came bc we had a gift card to use. They forgot to seat us for 30 mins & still seated other people, they ran out of food we were interested in (multiple), kept forgetting silverware & side plates, never refilled our waters, forgot side dishes, our server was clearly in a rush to hurry up take our order, brought our food out when we mentioned something & it was wrong. It took us 2.5 hours to eat. Food wasn't bad but definitely didn't feel customer service."
Lee-Lee Y.,"Westwego, LA",111,7,7,1.0,4/15/2017,"I wouldn't even give them one star if the first one wasn't required..... took my mother there for her birthday.... the restaurant was barely filled... the wait was long to get our first drink, food was blah... This New Orleans no taste...... server was nice, just over worked w/ no help I wouldn't spend another coin there"
Teneha B.,"New Orleans, LA",1329,889,5324,2.0,8/11/2014,"What a disappointment. Average to good food & God-awful service.  This is the first time I have ever intentionally left $0 as a tip; believe me she earned it.  Out with friends to celebrate a birthday, we decided upon the Cheesecake Factory for two reasons: it's newness in the area & proximity.  The wait was 35 minutes; we provided a cellphone number, as requested, for notification when our table was ready. We asked for 1st available with a preference for outdoor seating.  *****Reasons for less than 5 stars***** More than 5 items we attempted to order were unavailable or the kitchen was unable to prepare (for 1 reason or another) A bread basket was promised before the meal, however, it arrived AFTER our food was served.  Drinks were not refilled even after the server visited our area on more than 6 occasions, yes I counted, she managed to steer clear of our table - maybe she was embarrassed, idk.  Three in our party & one person received her meal 20 minutes prior to the other two of us  We had to request silverware, which arrived 5-7 minutes after the 1st person in our party received her food.  Appetizers were NEVER delivered or even spoken of until we had to remind her NOT to place them on the bill.  The manager brought our food out & apologized for the error; as he stated he was just made privy to the disastrous issues & he comped our desserts; however even though she was aware of the freebie, because she reiterated the plans of free dessert as stated by the manager; little miss sunshine STILL charged us for the cheesecake (crickets); we felt like this should've been an episode of Punk'd!!!  *****Reasons for AT LEAST 2 Stars***** Extensive menu, lots to choose from. Great selection of cheesecake. New to the area.  I'll be back, but I pray the experience isn't as such; this is a great restaurant as I've been to other locations throughout the US. And I know this location has the same potential."
Vassili M.,"Washington, DC",24,2,,1.0,3/9/2017,"45 minutes wait for two burgers. Bread was put on table in basket with butter but without bread knives, plates or napkins. When I asked our server why this happened she just said that these things are usually on the table. She didn't correct it and just walked away. We asked to cancel our order and just pay for our drinks. A manager type came over and said that he'd like to take care of us from now on. I explained to him what happened and that we'd like to quietly pay for our drinks and leave. He grabbed my debit card and left with it. Don't come here. I usually don't complain about a restaurant experience unless I'm very disappointed."
