Brian K.,"Jackson, MS",58,3,2,1.0,4/2/2017,"Service was slow and terrible, the lettuce wraps were great but that's as far as our meal went. We left before outlets entrees even showed up. Luckily we live no where near so we don't ever have to come back."
Greg H.,"New Orleans, LA",103,110,327,3.0,7/31/2015,"I am not a fan of mega-chains like this but I decided to give it a try with two friends. I ordered the crispy spicy chicken sandwich which came with fries. They bring you two types of bread with butter both of which were pretty good.  Our server was attentive and we never had to ask for anything. She was funny as well, several times we heard plates crashing and she was like 'it wasn't me' she was just fun. One thing that I am still unable to wrap my mind around is the fact this place has a 21 page menu! That was not a typo----21 pages!! This made choosing what to order more than overwhelming and when I see places with such giant menus I can't help but assume there is no way a restaurant is going to do that many things well. I mean, I feel like these type of menus are all about pleasing the pants off everyone in the universe verses (like I said) making every single dish amazing in its own right.  I prefer places that have smaller menus that do what they do on a smaller scale but that do everything really really well.  On to the food.  The presentation was well above average for a mega-chain. The sesame bun was fantastic and the plate just looked really nice all around. They give you some blue cheese dressing on the side and it was just ok, nothing amazing. The sweet potato fries were great and they were presented in a little metal canister with wax paper which was a nice touch.  I did not order cheesecake because I pretty much don't like sweets of any kind. However my friend is a cheesecake aficionado and he really enjoyed himself.  All in all it was not a bad experience, I was actually surprised at how good the chicken sandwich was because I really enjoyed it.  This place is basically Chili's on steroids."
Stephen C.,"Schulenburg, TX",33,7,,5.0,2/17/2017,"Had a shrimp pasta dish that was awesome, with a side of green beans that were fresh and cooked perfect. Girlfriend had chicken tortilla dish and it was good. Will definitely eat at this place again and I do recommend trying it."
Joy J.,"New Orleans, LA",5,28,7,4.0,11/21/2016,Best place for a gluten free turkey burger.  The food and service is consistent.  Of course I order a cheesecake slice to go
Aaron M.,"Bethesda, MD",220,351,98,3.0,7/30/2015,"Service: Awesome.  Our server was on top of everything and was really friendly.  She made the whole experience a pleasure.   Food: Just fine.  Since I knew I was gonna order cheesecake, I ordered the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  It came with a bed of greens with some dressing that was pretty good, with some avocado that was clearly past its prime.  The pieces of tuna it came with were seared perfectly and were spice crusted-I could really taste the spice, which was a nice surprise.   The brown bread they give you is delicious!   LOVED the Salted Caramel cheesecake, with its multiple layers of caramel goodness atop a blondie ('MERICA), although cheesecake here only happens a couple times a year: their cheesecake is beyond decadent, with many slices exceeding 2000 calories by themselves.   I'm not making a special trip out to Metairie for the Cheesecake Factory, but it's a decent choice for a restaurant near Lakeside."
H A.,"Toronto, Canada",0,5,,1.0,4/10/2017,"E. Coli!!!! Beware!!!! Went here with two friends, they ordered a veggie burger and beef burger, both have E Coli now! Beware!"
Huyen N.,"Metairie, LA",0,43,34,3.0,6/26/2017,"Nice place for a date night. Big menu but mediocre food. Only thing we really enjoyed was the cheesecake, hence the name."
John S.,"Metairie, LA",0,38,4,1.0,12/1/2016,We have eaten here on many different occasions. We have noticed that the quality of the food seems to be inconsistent. However the speed of the service has been SLOOOWWWW!!! for us. What should be a 30 minute meal ends up taking 1 1/2 hours or more. Not friendly for a business lunch because the meal takes too long.
Shercole K.,"New Orleans, LA",291,423,734,4.0,3/27/2015,"This experience dining at The Cheesecake factory was a solo bar effort. The bar was very peaceful specifically for a Thursday night. No issues sitting at the bar or being served.   The bartender was very knowledgeable about her drinks and gave me proper proportions for my simple drink of Jameson and Ginger Ale (Which you won't believe is sadly a problem at times). For my meal I decided to try out the Steak Diana, which was wonderful and included a medley of steak, onions, mushrooms, wine sauce, and mash potatoes. It was delicious and filling! One thing to keep in mind here... Their food is not normally meant for the calorie counters (which my meal calories made me sad, but worth it.) Make sure to skip to the skinny meal plans (I forgot the exact name) for the lower calorie counted foods. They pretty much have options for everyone. Parking is definitely available; it's connected to Lakeside Mall so no issues there."
Hank H.,"Metairie, LA",1,19,3,4.0,7/1/2017,first time been at this place....food was pretty good and waitress was very attentive...I was so full didn't get to try out the cheese cake...had a great lunch.
J'me W.,"Phoenix, AZ",677,202,989,1.0,1/2/2015,"This is the worst cheesecake I have ever experience and believe me I have had Cheesecake from Hawaii to LA and all in between. The service was lack luster and I order soup-Clam Chowder-Flavorless, coarse base texture and an insult to Clam Chowder, my favorite soup. Main Shrimp Scampi-I have ordered this dish coutless of times over the years. It typically is jumbo shrimp scampi sitting upwards around the plate with a bundle of pasta in the off center of the plate dry, Angel hair. This dish came to me looking like soup. It had zero flavor just like the soup and served heavy sauced and sloppy. I was just working in Sephora that day and a cast member never had Cheesecake Factory and I raved to her about the consitancy and great ness of them all. Needless to say when I came back I told her it was not on point. The way I see it is this is my punishment to be eating Cheesecake factory in the city with the best food in the world originated. COME ON NOLA GET IT TOGETHER."
Kris H.,"New Orleans, LA",0,12,1,3.0,12/7/2016,The food is good but the menu is HUGE! My favorite this here is the Cuban sandwich most of the time I end up ordering it because I'm just to overwhelmed by all the choices on the menu.
Corinne W.,"New Orleans, LA",34,5,3,1.0,1/6/2015,"This place is honestly the biggest ripoff in the entire city of New Orleans. I order the shrimp scampi and steak diane combo and it was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. For 19.95 there were three shrimp and TERRIBLY cooked ""medium"" steak. The steak was dry and flavorless and the shrimp were a just ok size. Cheesecake Bistro is a much better investment of time and money. The food took 45 minutes to come out! The service is an absolute waste as is the cood. It is truly a disgrace to bring this establishment into our great city of cuisine and culture."
K F.,"Metairie, LA",0,28,6,2.0,5/7/2017,"I've only ordered take out twice here.  Service here is horrible.  Food is average, called in to place an order waited a min then got in my car to head over to this Metairie location.   I walked in still on hold thinking ""they must be busy"" nope, 3 people at the hostess stand doing nothing as I walked in one of them ask may I help you?  I say yes I've been on hold almost 15 mins now can you take my order?"
Adrianne R.,"Atlanta, GA",924,239,295,3.0,2/24/2015,"I can only review so much on this CCF because I was not really feeling well upon going in..... We waited about 40 mins to be seated which is the norm on the weekend. Had a Mojito at the bar on the wait and it was awesome! Love their mojito's! After we were seated I didn't have much of an appetite because of my Bronchitis , so I ordered a buffalo blast with lemon water, my sister ordered garlic noodles and shrimp and my niece.....I can't remember I was pretty out of it. I didn't finish my food because I was so sick that I had to visit the bathroom .... I'm sorry about this review.  Anyway bathroom was nice and clean. I was just ready to get back to the room.   I do remember our waiter was a bit too Chatty Cathy that night, he spent most of his time at our table talking, maybe it was my sister and niece that had him talking so dangon much.... I was so annoyed. LOL!"
Evelyn V.,"Kenner, LA",1,29,3,1.0,11/20/2016,"If I could give ZERO stars I would! Usually love this place, however tonight we walked in and were treated so rudely! They close at 11 and we came in 45 minutes before closing time and were ignored by the host and three waiters, we stood at the door for about ten minutes without anyone giving us any attention, then finally a manager came over and said they would get a table ready for us, when he told the waiter you could see everyones annoyance,  we didnt walk in 5 minutes before close, but we certainly waited until 10:30 ... So disrespectful.. And while we continued to wait the waitress cleaned our table as slowly as possible, we ended up leaving of course.."
Whitney J.,"New Orleans, LA",1,32,4,1.0,8/5/2016,Worst employees ever. This is the second time I came to sit on the patio and was told they don't have servers staffed outside EVEN THOUGH every table was set with plates and napkins. The hostess was rude BOTH times I attempted to be seated outside. Do not bother coming here. Waste of time. Their manners need improvement as well.
Sara P.,"Saint Louis, MO",18,3,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Sat down at 6:30pm and waited an hour and a half to be served dinner. Drinks were never refilled and food came out over cooked. Terrible service. When the food did come out, we were given 2 plates at a time for a party of 6, 10 minutes apart. Some of us were finished eating before the last person received their food."
Brittany G.,"Metairie, LA",129,148,419,1.0,10/26/2015,"Yikes! This was the worst dining experience I have had in some time. I do not like giving bad reviews and this is my first 1 star review (I've written around 60 reviews). This restaurant makes me sad because it has so much potential. I've gone to The Cheesecake Factory in other states, and I have had great experiences. The really sad thing about this place is that it seems to be getting worse. Right when a restaurant opens, it is expected that there may be some confusion/mistakes happening. I went here a few weeks after it first opened and had a good experience (4 stars). My grandma and I came here a few months ago and had a mediocre experience (3 stars) due to lackluster service and wilted lettuce for my chicken lettuce cups. This most recent time, last Saturday, is what is making me give the restaurant only 1 star because of how bad it's slipping. I went with two of my friends and one of them brought their child (a 3 year old). My friends did take awhile to order due to the complexity of the menu. I ordered a lunch special which was a half chicken salad sandwich/soup/and a side salad for 11.50. I saw on the menu that if you wanted a the side salad to be a caesar salad then it was an upgrade, I decided not to do that and chose a different dressing. My two friends both ordered salads for their meals. My friend ordered her daughter chicken strips off of the kid's menu. About 20 minutes later, the waitress comes up and tells us that because a dish broke that they could no longer serve salads? We would have to re-order. I didn't feel like going through the long menu, so I told her to keep my order and just not to worry about the side salad. Both of my friends re-ordered and chose the turkey-guac sandwich with fries. Twenty more minutes go by and a young man, who I am assuming was the manager, comes up and tell us that they actually can make salads, but they do not have any turkey. They have been out of turkey for a month. What?!?!?! Why are these items still listed on the menu if you've been out for a month? So my friends go back to their original order of the salads after being in this restaurant for almost an hour. My friend's daughter was getting very antsy at this point. About 5 minutes later, the kid's meal comes out. Five more minutes go by and my food comes out with a side caesar salad. Ten minutes and my friend's salads come out. I tell the waitress that I did not want the caesar dressing (I really didn't feel like being charged more). The waitress takes it away and tells me that she will pack me the one that I ordered to take home. The baked potato soup was pretty good (it was different but still yummy), but the chicken salad sandwich was nothing to write home about. We got our checks, but I never got my salad to go. I didn't care about it enough to wait another 15 minutes. Overall, we spent entirely too long and too much money. Next time I will go to La Madeleine's if I want chicken salad, soup, or salad. Much cheaper, faster, and better tasting!"
Ashley B.,"Halifax, Canada",37,106,31,5.0,2/25/2015,"Wow! I've never been here before, and I can't wait to come back. I wish I came on a empty stomach because the cheese cake was... mind blowing. And the amount of flavors they have.. amazing! I had no idea they had real meals like breakfast and lunch, and a full bar.  I didn't need anything but the cheese cake. Highly recommend for any sweet tooth craver!"
