Lauren N.,"New Orleans, LA",46,32,24,3.0,1/3/2015,"My first time here and eh it could've been better. My boyfriend and I came in around 9:20ish for dinner and waited about 5 mins for our table which wasn't bad at all! First thing I noticed walking in was the decor, it was gorgeous!!  We ordered:  the fried mac n cheese balls for appetizer, which I expected to be more tasty but I guess I'm not into powdery textured mac n cheese?  entree: Fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp (waitress suggested).. it honestly tasted like a basic pasta I could've made at home that probably wouldn't have been so overcooked and tasteless! NOT WORTH $22 BUCKS A PLATE! For my boyfriend, he got the Luau Salad and IT WAS DELISH! I took a bite or 5...  dessert: we took a regular cheesecake topped with strawberries for togo and it was really good as well!  Our waitress was super friendly and always checked on us. I might just return one day and try something else."
Martina O.,"San Diego, CA",369,30,23,3.0,7/31/2016,Got the apple streusal cheesecake and it was good minus the 35 minute wait and the server forgetting to put a fork in my bag lol.... so I shall be eating cheesecake with my hands while driving back to Atlanta. Great.
Tiff D.,"New Orleans, LA",355,631,380,2.0,9/22/2014,"I have to take it back... Although Cheesecake factory was my favorite chain in Boston, this location just isn't good at all and sadly, it may be my last visit.  First, the brown bread is the best at CF, but they overcook it here.  Its so hard and dry.   Then the wait.  Good god. The wait is aweful.  The kitchen must just be slow here.  Food takes forever and service isnt good either. The food is definetly not the quality I remember.  The fries weren't the same.  The chicken enchiladas had gristly chicken. GROSS.   Prices are high at every CF but I somehow justified it in Boston because the food was good and portions were huge.  Portions seem smaller here and the quality isn't there. So for $100, LUNCH for a family of 4 is just not acceptable.  Sorry but I have to say I do not recommend CF."
O M.,"Metairie, LA",0,4,5,2.0,2/27/2016,"I love the Cheesecake Factory but this one is something different!  The silverware were dirty and we had to request two different sets.  We ordered the Santa Fe salad which we love and always get. It was mostly Lettuce stems :( and had no Parsley!  Also we got ""break bread"" welcome and our drinks awhile the appetizer!   We were very disappointed:("
susan e.,"Metairie, LA",35,49,6,5.0,11/7/2015,"The last we visited Cheesecake Factory was in 2005 Houston,yes,Katrina.That being said,we went to our town's CCF earlier this evening and I have nothing but good to say.It was crowded,however we were seated within 15 minutes.I was familiar somewhat with the menu,Party of three,we ordered 2 Mac and cheese balls,crabcakes 1 and order of salmon kinda wrap,everything was delicious and delivered hot to our table.I had a huge salad, the others I think had Chicken parmesan,and some kind of sandwich.Lastly,I'd like to point out that our waitress was the bomb.She was filling drinks checking but not bugging us.Definitely will go back,asap .."
Lauren L.,"Uptown, New Orleans, LA",276,249,454,2.0,7/10/2014,"Describe the Cheesecake Factory in the first three words that enter your mind! Go! Noisy Bread  Overpriced I have never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before, so this is solely based on my experience at the lakeside mall location.  First of all, there were an extreme amount if people gathered in front the restaurant, and immediately inside the front doors. People were blocking the door so badly at 530pm this Thursday night that we could hardly avoid knocking people while trying to get to the hostess station. The hostess! Oh my, the hostess. Have you ever heard anyone speak after inhaling helium? This was WORSE. 200 times worse! Her voice could PEEL the industrial PAINT off of an aircraft carrier.   We were told the wait would be a half an hour even though there were plenty of open tables; thank goodness it didn't take that long. We were seated and could barely  hear the waitress over the overbearing base line of the music playing. That is the only bit of the music you could hear over the cavernous echo-ey space filled with the voices of patrons, staff, clinking plates and cups.  We were brought bread pretty quickly. Free bread appetizer! I'm always a fan. Their pumpernickel and French bread earned one of these nifty stars. Very good. Our waters (water is a very complicated drink), were brought to us after we had finished the bread almost a half an hour after we were seated. Then, they brought out my brother's entree, about 10 minutes passed before our waitress came and asked US where the rest of our food was : I Really, lady? We are all sitting here waiting patiently for our food while his is getting cold.  So, here's the breakdown of the items we chose. (We all usually share) Spring rolls - pretty good. My brother was a fan of their peanut sauce. They had the Asian noodles on the plate and also wheat spaghetti = strange. Spicy chicken sandwich -not spicy, but still good. Chicken Madeira - picture here is about half because I was splitting it with my mother, and we ate some while waiting on an additional plate. And yes, I ordered specifically stating we were splitting it. Poor service on 2 counts now. She did refill my water glass frequently. Perhaps these two things were not within the waitress's control; it didn't affect her tip. It was delicious. I loved the potatoes. I had to ask though - ""are asparagus very expensive?"" There were two chicken breasts, and abundance of potato, but only 4 asparagus on the entire dish...ok...  While the food was acceptable, I found it very overpriced for the chain restaurant quality of food we received. I will not willingly choose to go here again."
Me W.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,13,,2.0,1/31/2017,"Very poor place to eat. Good way over cooked, my meat loaf was crusty and black from over cooking. Manager took it back and then brought me a over cooked and crusty hamburger which I still paid over $13.00 for. The waitress was good and also upset about our food."
Greg H.,"Lake Terrace & Oaks, New Orleans, LA",31,29,91,3.0,8/20/2015,"Not a bad place if you're not exactly sure what type of food you're craving for. Lots to choose from. Leave with a satisfied feeling but nothing more. No ""oh wow!"" moments."
Daniel E.,"New Orleans, LA",0,21,3,2.0,3/6/2017,"Went there yesterday with my mom, ordered drinks and got an 8$ nicely presented, however badly watered down mai tai that tasted like the punch at a high school dance. Asked the waitress if she could get the bar to make it less sweet and she brought back and I barely noticed a difference.  Ended up having to order a shot of Myers rum for like another 5$. My Cuban sandwich was good and so were the servers, but this is NOT a cheap restaurant and they are totally ripping ppl off with these drinks; playing off the assumption that many people don't actually like the taste of alcohol. I recommend you order from the bar off the top of your head rather than consider the drinks on the menu."
Jessica N.,"Gretna, LA",285,133,121,3.0,8/5/2014,"Normally I'm not a fan of chains but I do really like CF (have eaten there a few times in other states), so I was thrilled when I saw that the Metairie one had opened.  The BF and I went here on a Monday night around 7:30. It was our third attempt trying to eat here because each time we had tried, it was super packed with a crowd of people waiting outside to be seated. I figured Monday was typically a slower day for most restaurants so it was our best bet. The hostesses were friendly and initially quoted us a a wait time of 15 minutes but ended up seating us right away. I did see a couple of available tables but for the most part, it seemed to be a full house and very busy. The interior is beautiful and on par with other CF locations: same design, setup, menu, etc. Our server (I believe his name was Andrew or Andy) did an excellent job. I'm in the service industry myself so I'm usually particular about service wherever I go. He was very pleasant and checked on us several times to make sure everything was okay. Our appetizer, entrees and dessert came out promptly and we never had to wait long for food. Also, refills came steadily and complimentary bread was given to us without us having to ask (which I noticed wasn't always the case with other reviewers). We tried the bite sized crab cakes, crab and artichoke dip, Kobe burger and buffalo blasts. No complaints on the food at all. The side that my BF ordered didn't come out with his meal but Andrew/Andy was quick to take care of that and brought it out soon afterward, nice. The entire dinner took about an hour and we left feeling stuffed and satisfied. We'll be back. My thoughts overall after reading some of their bad reviews on Yelp: keep in mind that this location has only been open for a month. If you choose to dine at any high volume establishment this early on, you should realize that there are going to be kinks to work out with the food, staff and kitchen. Instead of going on a weekend where the wait and food times may take longer than expected or they may be out of certain times, I would recommend going on a weekday/night towards the beginning of the week. I'm sure this place is going to be a great addition to Metairie and will do very well here."
Brit B.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,2,5.0,8/5/2016,Amazing options with good service. Drinks were great as was our dinner. We ordered Chicken & Biscuits and Factory Nachos which were superb with huge portions. Great place for dessert as well.
Katie S.,"Metairie, LA",194,116,711,2.0,9/6/2014,"So I went here once and had a pretty good experience. Since then I felt the need to update my review because the last few times I've been here they have ""run out"" of my favorite menu items, which I found a bit odd. The bartender explained to me that they pre-make everything in the kitchen the day before to a certain quantity, so they only have a limited supply of certain menu items for that day. So, if you go anytime in the late afternoon or at night, there's a big chance they will have already run out of a few popular menu items. I have came here 3 times since, and 2 of those times I was told that they had ran out of my favorite item of macaroni and cheese bites. Such a shame! I literally go there specifically for that crispy fried macaroni and cheese fix! But that's not the only thing that runs out, apparently several other items tend to run out pretty frequently as well. You would think this should be a pretty easy problem to solve. Just prep for more orders on popular menu items that constantly run out right? Well....nope....corporate has rules apparently that prevent that from happening. The staff is usually pretty apologetic about it and sweet but it sort of turned me off a bit knowing that if I come for something in particular I have a 50/50 shot that they might not even have it. Sort of a bummer."
Heather T.,"Phoenix, AZ",25,31,97,4.0,10/21/2014,"I don't know what the negative reviews are for. I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner at the bar area.  Lunch was a pleasant experience. There was no wait and my server greeted me immediately. The Sangrias here are really good along with the Shrimp Club sandwich which is HUGE.  For dinner me and two friends say at the bar because it was slightly crowded. We ordered appetizers (a salmon dish, Mac and cheese balls, calamari, and a southwest egg roll style dish). Again we had THREE rounds of their Sangrias.  Next time I'll be sure to actually try some cheesecake lol."
Kevin G.,"LaPlace, LA",1,1,,4.0,1/29/2017,"It was my mother's 8th birthday, we had 22 family members there to celebrate. Everything was great food the sitting and most of our waiter Gregory C thank you very much for your hard work."
Melanie Y.,"Kenner, LA",0,10,,3.0,2/20/2017,I'm on the fence about this place. I love the pecan turtle cheesecake and that's the only real reason I go. The menu is so long. I usually get a pasta or sandwich and nothing has really impressed me as much as the cheesecake. Service is hit or miss.
Malia R.,"Dallas, TX",498,673,1405,2.0,8/9/2015,"I think after counting the number of different Cheesecake Factory locations I've been to in different states, I'll need more fingers.  I guess that means it's my favorite place? I didn't realize.  But anyway, while visiting NOLA, we decided to stop in to the only Cheesecake Factory in the area, which is located in a mall in Metairie.  It's a very nice location, very inviting.  When we went in, it was pretty much empty and we were seated immediately.  We weren't offered any bread, which is the norm.  We didn't realize it until after we had gotten our entree and realized some bread would go really well.  We asked the server and he didn't bring it until we were about done, and it was super crispy.  I think they had left it in the oven for too long.  My husband had the orange chicken and he didn't really care for it.. it was mostly chicken and rice.  No veggies as promised.  I ordered the skinny chicken enchiladas which wasn't good either.  Sure, it was under 600 calories..but it was loaded with salt.  Yeesh. Service wasn't terribly slow, but it was slower than it should have been considering the restaurant was a ghost town.  Our server Ayren N. rarely checked up on us for refills and what not.  We were going to get cheesecake, but we just wanted to go already.  Plus, Cafe du Monde beignets sounded like a much better plan."
Trang D.,"Marrero, LA",43,42,127,3.0,10/30/2014,This place is gorgeous in the inside! This is a big restaurant and they had a lot of staffing. With that being said the service was great! You can enter from the inside of the mall and there's a walk way or park outside by the Red Lobster restaurant.  For appetizer we got the crab and artichoke dip. The flavor was good but wish the consistency was more thick.  I went with the safe choice and got the Louisiana Chicken pasta. It was a big plate and I couldn't finish half of it.  My girlfriend got the fish and chips and that look tasty.  They offer the honey wheat and sourdough bread as you wait but I recommend you to double up on the sourdough. It tasted better.
Kellie J.,"New Orleans, LA",57,1,,1.0,7/31/2015,"Horrible food, horrible service. We went for my daughter's birthday and let's just say that I have to make it up to her. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait and it was an hour and 15 minutes. When we finally got to the table, the waiter was horrible. Everyone's drinks and food came out at different times, the food was bland, and when we complained to the waiter, his response was, ""well what do you want me to do about it?""  I have never experienced anything like this before! My family will never return to this location...EVER!"
Kaitlin T.,"Norco, LA",105,101,63,3.0,3/19/2016,This place just isn't worth the wait and the price. The big menu means there's something everyone in your party can find to order. Almost everything I've ordered has been decent but nothing's been spectacular. Service is hit or miss. The Thai salmon and chicken bellagio pasta are the best dishes I've had here besides the cheesecake. This isn't a place I'm in a rush to go back to.
Sharett L.,"New Orleans, LA",24,119,129,4.0,6/20/2014,"Visited this location during the weekend of their grand opening. Had the Steak Diane and Shrimp Scampi combo. The wait was almost 1 hour for the entree however 3 of the locations big shots (I'm guessing managers and regional managers) kept visiting my table to assure me that my food would be out promptly without me calling them or suggesting that I had been waiting a while. I'm sure this convenience will end 2 to 3 months from now once the location isn't so new.  The steak and scampi were fine (4stars) it was just alot of mushrooms! The service was fair for the amount of patrons in at one time since it was the lunch time rush.  I must admit that the busboys are very meticulous keeping the tables spotless and giving great detail to how they arrange flatware on the table. I just honestly hate how all the franchise locations don't put the silverware on plates or napkins, but directly onto the table."
