Judith M.,"Davie, FL",19,71,92,4.0,8/21/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is known for their really good cheesecake but they do have really good food. Add the fact this is located at Dolphin Mall along side other great restaurants, it is impressive to see how full it is.  We came here to celebrate a coworker's birthday. Trying to find a parking spot took a bit, but when we got walked inside the restaurant, we were greeted immediately and seated fairly quickly. The waitress, Ashley, was very pleasant and very knowledgeable. We ordered a variety of foods. All were fantastic! But none of us ordered any cheesecake! Go figure! The shrimp pasta was delish and highly recommend it although I feel like they skimped a little on the shrimp.. great floor plan, great staff, great location!! Highly recommend!"
Annie A.,"Montreal, Canada",7,44,69,3.0,11/30/2017,"I was excited to try the Cheesecake Factory as we don't have any in Canada and have heard so much about it. The actual restaurant is nice and well maintained. I was happy we were seated on the outside patio as the weather that day was perfect. We tried a few different appetizers that were all to die for: the crispy fried cheese, the avocado eggrolls and the fried zucchini. The mains were a different story. I had Evelyn's pasta, although it was good, it didn't justify the price tag. Others in our group had the salmon, fish tacos, grilled cheese, fried chicken strips and a veggie burger. No one was wowed with their food, all of the people who ordered fried dishes commented that the food was oily making me think their oil wasn't hot enough. I tried my son's chicken tenders and they were bland along with having absorbed way too much of the frying oil.  Service on the other hand was outstanding. I'd be willing to give them another try but I think I'd just order appetizers and try some dessert next time."
Valarie G.,"Savannah, GA",74,42,58,3.0,10/28/2017,The service was great and the wait time was short considering the crowd.  The Truffle Honey Chicken was very average. The Chicken Parmesan pizza my husband ordered was too spicy. I was a bit disappointed as I have had really delicious food from Cheesecake Factory in other locations.
Lynette M.,"Miami, FL",224,98,258,4.0,7/31/2017,"I found out from some co workers that it was national cheesecake day, and they explained to me how it works so pretty much when you purchase a slice of a cheesecake you get half off the price of the cheesecake. So I was amazed from hearing about that so I decided to go after work, and gave it a stop by on my way home. But what I did was I called to order a sliced of the "" raspberry white chocolate truffles "" when I was about 3-4 mins away from the location. As soon as I got there they charged me immediately, and hand it to me even though it was extremely packed inside.  -The location is in dolphin mall, and regarding parking you have more than enough spots to station your car including a parking garage.  -Another thing is that amazed me was hearing from one of the employees that this is their 9th year doing this event."
Jonathan R.,"Coconut Creek, FL",0,5,1,5.0,12/24/2017,I just have to say that the waiters were super friendly. the food was delicious and the ice cream omg the ice cream cup with chocolate is the best...
Maria R.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,5.0,1/4/2018,The food is delicious  I love the strawberry  lemonade  The waiting time is what o don't like
Angelica K.,"Miami, FL",56,105,315,5.0,8/23/2017,This is a very common place for Hispanics. Their menu is so extensive that there is nothing on the menu that your picky family member won't find. They have common pastas and delicious cheese cakes for everyone to taste. Service is usually very friendly and the food portions are usually big.
Kevin J.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,5.0,1/10/2018,"I love this place! Never disappointed  I went with my group of friends, we had a birthday party and our server was super helpful and had great knowledge of the menu! 10/10"
Rox B.,"Miami, FL",196,4,3,4.0,12/22/2017,Had the special- Thai coconut curry chicken with brown rice- and dammit I swear I've never had a bad dish at Cheesecake Factory. The dish was sweet and spicy with mango chunks in it! Went on a Wednesday evening and service was a little slow...they weren't that busy (only reason for the 4 star rating). Other than that the don't get full on the delicious pumpernickel table bread or you won't have room for the large dish coming your way.
Mallory A.,"Miami, FL",0,14,2,5.0,10/26/2017,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but his one is amazing, I've been there a couple times but this time everything was perfection which is great because I was celebrating my birthday! I had the hibachi steak that came with mash potatoes and asparagus tempura. The steak was definitely one of the most tender I've ever tried, the mash was amazing tasted like fresh real potato not box mix like a couple other places and the asparagus tempura was also great. And the perfect end was the hazelnut cheesecake which I think is my new favorite. The ambience is laid back yet modern and cool. And the service is quick and friendly."
Betty H.,"West Lawn, Chicago, IL",62,2,,1.0,12/8/2017,It was my birthday so i was excited. First our server got lost. We had to wave another server down and send a message to our server.  We placed our order and 40 minutes later our room temperature food arrived. Doing the 40 minute wait no server. When he came back to give us the check we ask for dessert totally interrupting his plan. He told us he was training someone and he couldnt keep up. Even though we never saw the trainee. Our food was horrible  we didnt take a doggie bag. My first bad experience at cheesecake factory.
Brian C.,"South Miami, FL",319,1,,5.0,1/2/2018,Went with friends and the food looked amazing but I didn't eat. The water was amazing tho.....
Emily H.,"Miami, FL",307,91,103,3.0,3/10/2017,"Had a very average experience here the other night. Pros: my food was yummy, lots of options (maybe a little too many), and was very happy there was a lower calorie ""skinny"" menu Didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table on a Thursday night. Have been on a Saturday for lunch and didn't have to wait too long either Cons: When we got to our table (outside on the patio), the bench was dirty and the table looked like there was debris stuck to the glass. The service was spotty and inattentive. The food was pretty good, but took a long time to come out."
Yancomilanes ..,"Miami, FL",0,14,16,5.0,11/20/2017,My favorite place. I know pretty much the whole menu. Sweet tamales are good. White chocolate rasberry truffle is at another level.
Supawat J.,"Miami, FL",1,67,421,5.0,8/19/2017,Stopped  by for lunch.Food is great as usual.Try new menu...coffee and cream supreme cheesecake. .taste so good.The service is awesome as well.
Victor M.,"Doral, FL",1,17,26,4.0,7/30/2017,"One of the best all around chain restaurants locally to go to. They have a big menu which is good and bad because if you're like that i can never make up my mind you'll take forever to make a decision they also have a light menu which is very long as well. I had the mac n cheese burger med temp, it was pretty good nothing to die for my wife had a greek salad and my girls gad a kids burger slider and a shrimp and pasta. The shrimp and pasta was kinda of dull on the flavor but the shrimp was good. The service was good regardless the fact they were extremely busy Sunday night primetime 8:00pm my server was really good and attentive. The line for the cheesecake was ridiculous so i took mine to go. Red velvet cheesecake is . Personally i like the sister restaurant GRAND LUX if you guys like the factory go ahead and try the lux i go to the one in Aventura. Super fire!!"
Ivy L.,"Miami, FL",204,28,45,4.0,7/15/2017,"I'm giving the location four stars because you can embed really go wrong with any of the food at Cheesecake. It's ALWAYS delicious. I've probably had everything on the menu and never have complained. Great service! However, since dolphin mall is always packed there is always a wait of at least an hour."
Scarlett U.,"Miami, FL",11,12,83,3.0,10/11/2016,"I love eating at the Cheesecake Factory.  The food is always delicious, I haven't been disappointed with that yet.  My disappointment comes from the service I got this trip. My server wasn't horrible but wasn't great. He took forever with our things and never brought us our bread which I enjoy lol.  My mom was asking for everything since we were waiting for our drinks and appetizers since well that's before our food. We got both at the same time by which at that point I was starving.  My mom asked about the bread and the server said they had run out, which was bull.  Everyone around me was getting bread and there food way faster then us and we were there before them.  I will not be coming back to this location but will be going back to my regular ones, out of Miami that is."
Pokai M.,"Doral, FL",85,141,390,3.0,3/18/2017,Cheesecake Factory is an above average as far as chain restaurants go. This location is just average as far as cheesecake factories go. The Thai chicken coconut curry special was a bit dry and too sweet. The jambalaya (my usual favorite) was surprisingly lacking in flavor and the pasta was overlooked. The calamari (another fav) was crunchy and delicious.
Carine N.,"New River, AZ",57,162,,3.0,4/9/2017,1st:  We love Cheesecake Factory-just NOT this one.  We were at the Dolphin Mall as part of our pre-cruise adventure and decided to have our early dinner there b/f we got back on our bus to go back to our hotel.   It was actually our first disappointing experience w/ any of them!  Waiter treated us as if it was a burden to do his job and barely spoke to us.  Payed more attention to his phone (which we have never seen any employee ever do at one before!).  We sat outside and the upholstery on the seating looked as if it was way past its prime.  Food was just okay-not the usual Yum! we've always experienced from Cheesecake factory.
Victoria A.,"Miami, FL",21,26,24,5.0,6/5/2017,"Came here for my brothers high school graduation lunch with a family of picky eaters. Everyone was happy with the options available and even enjoyed a few of the frozen drinks. Monica, our waitress, was very friendly and welcoming, offering suggestions when my grandfather could not make up his mind."
Chiyon Y.,"Miami, FL",218,216,750,2.0,9/14/2016,"I have a love/hate relationship with Cheesecake Factory. It's consistent... always busy, never clean, mediocre service, good food but terrible presentation, etc. etc. etc. Food-wise, the flavors are there. I mean, with all that fat, there better be flavor. I pretty much like everything I've had at Cheesecake, again, Fat = Flavor.  This review is a reflection of my last visit this past weekend, in which I had the worst items I've experience in 15+ years at dining at Cheesecake.  --- The Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls were the worse I've ever had. They were pre-rolled and sitting out for a loooong time, because those rice wrappers were hard as a rock. Each roll had 1/2 a shrimp!!!  --- The Eggroll Sampler... oily as expected, but there's a right way to fry food that won't taste overly oily. Not complaining about the oiliness, but the Firecracker Salmon in the sampler was extremely disappointing. Salmon in only 1/3 of the eggroll, and definitely not as advertised on the website.  I felt like I was robbed on both these items, not worth the price & definitely never ordering these again! 1 star for the service, better than most time. Kudos to our sweaty server!  1 star for the bread... I could eat their bread all day, every day."
Sara A.,"Miami, FL",0,6,4,4.0,1/23/2017,"Usually go to Cheesecake factory for dinner, but went yesterday for some brunch.  I was extremely impressed with the prices, I ended up getting the Brunch Combo (2 eggs, bacon, and 2 pancakes) for $10. Great value! However, I could not find the mimosas on the menu! Regardless, it was really good for the value! Will be going back with my friends more often."
Karlos A.,"New York, NY",585,103,204,3.0,2/20/2017,The food is ok. I mean. Its no gourmet restaurant but it does its job. Good service. Good portions. I'm satisfied.
Alexandra F.,"Miami, FL",32,6,1,3.0,9/24/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is one of the restaurants I like to go back as I am rarely disappointed. Menu is very large and there is something for everyone. My personal favorites are tuna tartare and the flatbreads. They are fresh and flavorful. Since this restaurant is always busy, the turnover makes every ingredient the freshest. The cheesecakes are awesome. But let's be honest, service is sometimes good, sometimes bad, depending on your server.  The place is always always busy so it is very noisy inside but they have a nice outdoor terrasse, where I prefer to sit. The cleanliness is not always good, when you visit the bathrooms or see how the bussers clean up the tables. Overall, good value."
Maria G.,"Miami, FL",0,20,17,5.0,4/14/2017,Staff was great and the food is always good at chz cake !!  We love it here the outdoor dining was nice..
Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",936,1403,6924,3.0,10/5/2015,"It's the Cheesecake Factory, what's not love?  It has gluttonous portions and tasty desserts. That's all I ask for when I go there and this location is no different than the rest. Located in Dolphin Mall, this location has indoor and outdoor seating options. Parking can be a little tricky because of its location but just think, you're gonna need to burn calories after this meal. The service was good. Our waiter, Paul was very friendly and helped us pick out an app which was the Mac and cheese balls. They were amazing. Our meals arrived sporadically as if they were made in different kitchens. My order of chicken nachos were pretty tasty- and I'm telling myself they are calorie free. The bathrooms though were absolutely disgusting. Toilets stuffed with, well, you get the idea. Filth everywhere. That won't stop me from coming back, but it'll make me think twice about going into the restroom. Just go outside to the public restroom- they are clean."
Imani P.,"Miami, FL",0,6,19,4.0,4/17/2017,Cheesecake Factory is always my first choice for birthday celebrations as well as holidays celebrations. Choosing to attend this year was Easter was a no brainer. Food is great many options (gluten-free) is also available upon request. Service is always prompt though the place is usually packed so except about a 15 min wait. I initially ordered jambalaya pasta but it seemed under seasoned so I sent it back and got the char grilled steak w potatoes and mac & cheese it was great. Definitely a place I'd frequent with friends and family.
Jadhai C.,"Miami, FL",11,81,187,2.0,5/13/2016,"I had been looking forward to trying out the ""NEW"" Cheesecake Factory at Dolphin, not too sure if it's worth a second trip when Texas de Brazil is right next door with the oozing smells that creep up on you in all the right ways. It was my birthday Brunch. We got seated at the ending of the outdoor patio next to OTHER people eating when there was multiple empty seating in between. The waitress asked us mid way through leaving through the door ""do you want bread?"" I wish she would of just brought it instead of asking the way she did so casually. We were brought sourdough and another type of bread. It was so stale it could break a tooth, and oh boy did it. Mid chew... I realized that a tooth I had a root canal on had completely chipped off. That's how freaking hard that bread was. Super disappointed. We ordered Evelyn's Favorite Lunch Pasta and a Chipotle Pasta from the Lunch special as well. For some reason my Evelyn's pasta was nowhere near evenly coated. The noodles looked dried, and the sauce to one side. And it was extremely room temperature. Yet the Chipotle Pasta was super HOT. So obviously mine was left out to wait for his pasta to come out. I believe if I remember correctly... The waitress only asked us once if we were okay. I don't know, but there was not anything special about this place. Sorry."
Jorge N.,"Miami, FL",18,38,140,3.0,1/9/2017,"Service was superb. Our waitress, food runner and busboy were trained as champs. The food here, like all TCFs, is not bad but it doesn't standout. We love the decor, the ambiance, the presentation and the general concept but the food is ""cookie cutter""; meals remind me of something prefabricated or in an assembly-line spirit. It lacks originality and it is average in flavor. It's a good place to go to enjoy time with the family. Yes, we will be back for our relatives who don't have an open-mind or sophisticated palette, but I will return with no excitement for the food."
Vinny A.,"Boston, MA",143,116,131,2.0,1/16/2017,"I've been to this location before and haven't had problems, but today just wasn't good. First of all, we went around 12 so the place wasn't packed at all. The server was attentive, but he never brought us the complimentary bread. I ordered a few things, and one of them was the factory nachos. Today they were just awful- over fried and greasy chips, and really salty. I did not enjoy the meal at all."
Letty O.,"Miami, FL",5,5,,4.0,7/10/2017,"Cheesecake is a great place to eat. It is located at the heart of the Dolphin Mall so it is surrounded by music, people milling about, or just sitting listening to the music playing in the main courtyard. It is spacious, so usually the wait is not too bad on a busy day. The food is very good, reasonably priced, and you get large portions so you will leave fulfilled! But do not leave before trying one of their signature cheesecakes. They are simply the best! It doesn't matter which you try, but the chocolate ones are the richest and most satisfying, in my humble opinion. This place will not disappoint!"
Jennifer D.,"Miami, FL",5,32,107,5.0,7/15/2016,"Had an amazing night with my husband thanks to the amazing waiter that attended us --WILLIAM--!!! Seriously if you ever visit the Cheesecake Factory @ Dolphin Mall you need to request him as your server!!!! He took our dinner from 0 to 100!!! Amazing, fun, beautiful, joyful personality!!! Make sure to ask specifically for him, and let him know you heard about him on Yelp  like always thou does the Cheesecake Factory ever disappoint?"
Annie C.,"Miami, FL",18,5,6,4.0,3/28/2017,Really good service and large portions of food but waiting to be seated took a while for me.
Mark T.,"Miami, FL",0,14,2,4.0,11/5/2017,"Cheesecake Factory food at its best. Had the Mac and Cheese burger which never disappoints. However, the waiter was a little pushy when it came to dessert when I politely turned down her offer due to being too full. I understand Corporate probably demands a quota of cheesecake to sell from each guest but I definitely did not want dessert after the large portion sizes of our food and to feel pushed to buy it felt a little sleazy in my opinion."
Cameron C.,"Daphne, AL",86,14,,4.0,6/9/2017,I went to eat at the bar while on a business trip alone. The bartender was very nice and attentive. The burger was really good!  I had never been to a Cheesesteak Factory so the menu was a bit overwhelming. There is so much to choose from!  I enjoyed my pick though and I would go back again for sure.
Don M.,"Miami, FL",102,118,103,1.0,6/28/2017,Stopped in for a working lunch with a business associate. No Wi-Fi. Almost zero cell reception. So annoying that you have not addressed this problem.
Denisse S.,"Miami, FL",2,21,42,4.0,6/12/2017,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory whenever it's a large party/group because there are a lot of choices/something for everyone. However, I had not been there in a couple of years and decided to visit because I was craving their Louisiana Chicken Pasta. Getting there is a struggle because this restaurant is located in Dolphin Mall and if you've never been there, beware! Parking is always a mission, especially on weekends. We spent about 30 minutes trying to find parking. When we finally got to the restaurant we were lucky enough to be seated quickly because there were two of us and we were willing to sit outside. Luckily it wasn't too hot. The waiter was kind but because there are so many items on the menu (over 250!) or maybe they were new, it took us a while to order. I also love that they now have the calorie information for every item. This is something we took into consideration as well when making our choices. Our food took a reasonable amount of time and I am very appreciative that they were able to remove mushrooms from my pasta as I cannot eat them. Overall it was a very good dinner but I feel their outside area could use more attention since it is so hot in Miami and the booth we sat in was a bit dirty."
Leo N.,"Frederick, MD",10,79,255,4.0,6/19/2016,Had full 4 part meal Their chicken artichoke soup had no flavor so i had it returned The fire cracker salmon appetizer was good. Had the filet mignon with asparagus. Flavor was delicious. Server was slow and never offered refills. Had to ask for more bread. The temperatures were wrong on both steaks ordered. 4 stars for quality of food. satisfactory quality of service.
Mike C.,"Miami, FL",305,32,9,1.0,9/21/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory, like ""don't fight with me at Cheesecake"" kinda love but this location is by far the worst.  Don't let the outside crowd fool you, you will be seated right away. I know the menu inside and out so I was ready to order but nah the server decides to grab my drinks first.  I was fine with this. The problem begins after you place your order. Prepare to play the game of ""Where is Waldo?"" with your server. Mind you, there's a stampede of servers running around this place so it's a mind boggling experience.  10 minutes after placing the order, the bread comes, server leaves but the drink he brought me 20 minutes ago needed a refill.  Where is Waldo? I found Waldo but he's at the other end taking another table's order. I wave him over and he pretends like he doesn't have peripheral vision. I am watching ice melt at this point and a puddle forming from the condensation. Where is Waldo? 10 minutes later, the appetizer comes but it's colder than my ex gf. Not to mention, Waldo never brought me utensils.  Where is Waldo? Waldo comes back with the entree but I didn't get to address the appetizer issue because Waldo leaves again. Where is Waldo? So I'm there sitting with my date without utensils, cold apps, and literally cotton mouth. Waldo reappears and asks me how the food is so far? I address the issue and he finds the audacity to ask me not to tell the manager about what happened.  My take: Watching paint dry might actually take less time than the service at this place."
