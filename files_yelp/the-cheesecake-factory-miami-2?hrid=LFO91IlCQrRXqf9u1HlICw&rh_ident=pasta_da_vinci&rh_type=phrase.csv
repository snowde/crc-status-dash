Bennet M.,"Austin, United States",224,236,423,4.0,21/5/2014,"YES PLEASE!!!! I'm a big fan of cheesecake and in love with their Dulce de Leche one. Believe it or not, their pumpkin cheesecake is so scrumptous!! Takes just like pumpkin pie if you're into that stuff. They only have it during the holidays so try it out if you can. I try to get something different but I'm in love with the  . This plate is huge so I end up sharing with someone else. Always on point! Customer service is pretty good. They're always friendly to us and never leave us with a glass that is half empty. Not a big fan of their drinks so I stick with wine. Try not to go here during the weekend, if not, just be prepared to wait for a while. I mean it's Dolphin Mall, this place never sleeps. Yes the food is good but I come here so I can complete my order for what it is known for. CHEESECAKE!! Haven't tried a better one so until then, I would continue to get my Dulce de leche cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory :)"
