Silvia C.,"Hialeah, FL",2,57,35,5.0,7/26/2015,"The service is awesome, yes it is always busy even on a tuesday at 3pm. But the staff, the food, & the cheesecake it well worth it. They seat you as soon as possible & are very attentive during your dinner. Food always tastes great & is hot when served, the waiters/waitresses are always on top of anything. Must go if you love this pace. Only thing that sucks is the parking."
Paul R.,"Fontainebleau, FL",2,13,4,3.0,12/21/2015,"The food great and place superb, however the customer service lacks, first the waiter doesn't bring water to the table, and when she did it was because I personally had to ask her for water, Second our drinks showed up about 25 mins in by then I think I should have gone to the bathroom and drank from the faucet to be honest WHAT'S THE POINT?!. I truly would have gave this place a solid 4 close to a 5 if it was not for the customer service I did not receive I definitely try this place again because I truly did enjoy my meal maybe the second time would be better."
Claudia J.,"Miami, FL",278,403,675,2.0,4/23/2013,"Service has gone down... I don't know what it is... but the server we got had partial amnesia.  He forgot about our drinks, our lemon for our water - we had to remind him.  When we asked for a replacement of our food because the rice was not cooked enough, we had no silverware - we had had to ask another person for them.  When we had our dessert, no silverware again.  No attention to detail at all. Service at Cheesecake used to be better.... gotta improve!"
Gaby S.,"Miami, FL",756,328,153,4.0,4/7/2013,"Just what dolphin mall needed to have added!  Cheesecake factory at dolphin mall is really beautiful inside and the service has been great so far the two times I have come to this location. Prepare for a wait though on any weekend night, especially the fact that its in dolphin!  Not really easy to go into depth for this review because it is a chain restaurant but the food is delicious and the portions are huge."
Michelle H.,"Miami, FL",59,55,88,5.0,2/14/2015,Monte Cristo Sandwich for brunch! The best! Keeps me coming back.  Fairly large portion so I either share it or take half home.  Good servers and honest staff. I left my daughters tablet at the table. Didn't realize I had lost it till hours later. I called and they had it in their safe.  I was able to recover the tablet.  Our top choice for brunch.
Ingrid R.,"Miami, FL",307,245,530,3.0,12/17/2013,"Slllllllllloooooowwwwwwww sssseeeeerrrrrrrvvvvvviiiiiccccccceeeeee. It really was painfully slow and the waitress didn't seem to be concerned by her negligence. Other than that, this location is the same as all others.  Four cheese pasta and an ultimate Margarita please."
Keith P.,"Washington, DC",563,629,328,4.0,12/12/2012,"THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!! YES!!!! Known for their classy, delicious, and trendy desserts! ................................ Before I continue with this review, I would just like to say that it is very difficult to review chain restaurants because they are the same. They are all run the same, have the same setup/décor, and most importantly serve the same food. And that is the truth at all of Cheesecake Factories +100 locations. However, since I would like to offer as much information as possible, I would like to compare this Cheesecake Factory to the other popular Cheesecake Factory in South Florida--- the one at Dadeland Mall. (Note: there is also one in Coconut Grove.) _______________________ DADELAND CHEESECAKE VS. DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE: Which one stacks up better? Which one is better? Where should you go? Location: Dadeland is the mall for the classy and those who want to spend money. Dolphin Mall is the home for those who like to shop on a budget--they do have outlet stores after all. Also, since the mall is bigger it has more parking for its cheesecake enthusiasts, so ONE POINT easily goes to DOLPHIN MALL CHEESECAKE. Service: When I went to Dolphin Mall Cheesecake, they were really slow. I am not sure if it was because they just got trained or were nervous, but our food was slow to come out. I think someone may have made a mistake in the kitchen. But my water glass was always full because once I took a sip, the waitress was back to fill my cup. At Dadeland Cheesecake, service is relatively fast, but they have messed up my food order a couple of times which made them take longer. TIE IN THIS CATEGORY! Food: Same food, love their cheesecakes. My favorite dish is the Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Superb taste of coconut! The Skinnylicious menu is offered at both locations for those on a diet. TIE AGAIN! Space: It is rumored that the Cheesecake Factory at Dadeland is expanding. But even without the rumored expansion, the one at Dadeland definitely has more space. The Cheesecake Factory at Dolphin has more outside space, but the seating in the inside just doesn't match up to the one at Dadeland. ONE POINT goes to DADELAND CHEESECAKE. AND WHAT DO WE HAVE?! A TIE!!!! In conclusion, I would say both of these Cheesecake Factories have their pros and cons. Both have good food. If you are looking to shop for a day, go to the one at Dolphin Mall to take advantage of their prices. If you want a faster reservation due to amount of space, go to Dadeland. Space at this Cheesecake Factory may be especially limited because the mall gets really busy at night, but overall, I like how this chain is expanding because I do love my Cheesecake! I would definitely come here again."
Christy S.,"Miami, FL",3,78,23,4.0,2/12/2016,"Great ambiance, nicely decorated and new location. I love the Gumbo and my husband loves the chicken Marsala. Their plates are huge so you could easily go for dinner and save the rest for lunch. The service varies depending upon whom serves you. The wait is always intense on the weekend but great during the week. Love their deserts, you could never go wrong ordering any of their cheesecakes."
Abby D.,"Miami, FL",219,11,,2.0,5/20/2016,"I am giving this place two stars not because the food and drinks were bad, but because the service was not good. I came here with my coworkers for our monthly happy hour, and when we entered we were immediately seated in the dining area without even being given the choice. When we spoke to the manager (Freddy) in regards to charging us happy hour prices in the dinning area he said no; understandable, but the way he came across was not pleasing. Once in the bar area, we got our drinks, appetizers, and food, but felt a lack of attention from our waitress. Our waters were not refilled and we had to ask multiple times for the status on our drinks and food. Once the bill came, we had to send them back because all happy hour specials were priced at regular price. In addition, a coworker of mine ordered a virgin mojito and was priced the same amount for an alcoholic one! When we brought this up to our waitress' attention she stated that the manager was not going to give her a discounted price. She received a discount on the drink ONLY when I asked for his name. In conclusion, we will not be coming back to this location for happy hour. You should not have to beg for good service to be given. However, the food and drinks were very tasty."
Katherine G.,"Miami, FL",53,13,,5.0,8/11/2016,"Great experience! The food was fantastic and the service was fast and efficient. I love cheesecake, it is one of my favorite places and I go to this particular location very often. I've yet to have a bad experience in this place. The wait can be long depending on the day of the week but once you're seated, it is worth the wait. I'm a very picky eater and they make sure to meet my limited menu expectations."
Greg M.,"Freeport, ME",3,6,,3.0,1/5/2016,"Pretty good food, large portions.  Don't overeat or you'll never finish your cheesecake!"
Mario R.,"Miami, FL",32,188,80,4.0,9/23/2014,"I want to give them 5 stars for their lettuce wraps and cheesecake alone, but some of their entrees are hit or miss. One day you'll have a pasta that tastes amazing, yet the same dish will taste like garbage during a second visit.  For the most part, you can't go wrong with the apps. I've tried almost everything on the menu and always find myself loading up on apps. If you do decide on an entree, the portions are enough for 2 and then some!  Regardless, always save room for dessert when you come here!"
Andrea 3.,"Miami, FL",3,39,19,1.0,1/23/2016,Well let me begin by saying that the service was great the food is awful both my husband and I got very sick after we ate at this location eater beware of the handling of food the bathrooms are awful very dirty.
Naveen N.,"Midtown, Detroit, MI",7,348,,4.0,12/3/2015,Standard Cheesecake Factory menu. Waitstaff was quick and friendly. Outdoor seating was great.
Mariana P.,"Brooklyn, NY",333,31,574,4.0,6/29/2015,"There food is always on point, I came on a Sunday afternoon with my mom and my cousin and ofc we had to wait for about 45 minutes but it was totally worth it! We got the best table where you can comfortably fit six people!! The service was friendly and efficient and the general ambience was pretty   mom ordered the harvest salad its lean and healthy (if you take out the dressing) which is what my mom did, my cousin ordered the Mexican salad from the skinnylicious menu which let me tell you IT IS HUUUUGE but really satisfying, and I ordered the Tuscan chicken without the farro and I really like it, it is not so big but once again very satisfying. Overall it's a good restaurant for a family meal. We loved the brown bread it is just sooo good so we ordered to take the rest home and they gave us more for free! Once we were finished with the food we were debating whether or not to ordered a dessert but sorry not this time, it's just way too much sugar and fat in once single slice. They should have smaller versions of their desserts."
Jamie C.,"Miami, FL",5,41,1,4.0,7/4/2015,"So I went as part of a group and keep in mind this is a chain. This review is based on this restaurant. They had a few quality control issues - some corn in my spinach, and one order was lost. I ordered a steak medium rare but it was well done, although not bad. The grilled broccoli was almost raw. It was a holiday and they were rushed and dos accommodate a large party and I am sure on other occasions they will do better. It's just ok as far as cheesecake factories go, and it's decent but not great. The server was very nice and attentive. For the price it's probably worth the money. The main course food was hot and cooked to order ; but the appetizers were not (nachos) and looked like they had been under a heat lamp. The salad looked fresh. They did accommodate small children ."
Betsy A.,"Miami, FL",3,4,,1.0,2/5/2015,"I went today for lunch and was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with the service. And the food. I ordered the Thai chicken lettuce wraps, the size of the chicken was that of a tender ( I get more chicken in a McDonald's nuggets) oh and my water had food particles inside. Than I ordered the shrimp Blt the shrimp were not cleaned at all, and we had some sort or stick object that we couldn't make out what it was. I informed the server and showed him what we found and he looked baffled did not know what is was either. He went and told the manager and the manager came and just said can I get you something else with a smile on his face.  I will never visit this Cheesecake Factory again!!!!!"
Tammy A.,"Miami, FL",306,115,71,4.0,3/17/2015,"Ok, so it's been awhile for me, first a foremost when did they go to only the brown sweet bread in the bread basket? That is genius! That white sour dough was unbearable. Next, the Chicken Santa Fe Salad was out of this word! I got the lunch portion and I barely was able to finish half of it. It was so refreshing and toppings and textures were perfect! With lettuce, pico de gallo, beans, tortilla strips, chicken and a yummy sauce you cant go wrong! The hubby had the chicken chipotle pasta, which he said was great! To finish off the meal we had the Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake was is out of this world! Cheesecake and red velvet cake combined! Delicious!!!!!!"
Frida T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,10,7,2.0,7/13/2016,"A Caesar's salad with 4 small chicken's pieces, very expensive for a big plate of green salad !!!"
Vanessa D.,"Zürich, Switzerland",1,19,8,5.0,1/8/2016,"Really good food, service is usually great and only had a unpleasant server once. The waiting time is not too bad, especially knowing it is located at this busy place by the mall. I would recommend to eat here - my personal favorite dish: bang bang chicken shrimp!"
