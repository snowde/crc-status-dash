Kristine A.,"Miami, FL",41,116,18,2.0,10/17/2015,"To be honest I probably won't Come back. I'm not usually a huge fan of the food at these chain restaurants. This particular experience was not the exception. We thought we'd give it a try since it's a relatively new space and we weren't happy. Service wasn't good at all. Our food took way too long, no refills at all through out the night, and my chicken Marsala was not good at all. It was soooooooo greasy. Like the bow tie pasta was literally dripping oil. I would have to let it drip before I ate it. It was super sweet, the salt shakers don't work at any tables either and the actual chicken itself just tasted old."
Yaremi M.,"Hialeah, FL",0,1,,3.0,12/27/2015,I was disappointed with this cheesecake factory because there were a few things that i did not like. The waiter took forever to bring us even water. There were a few things in the menu king of expensive according to the size. I definitely not coming back to this location.
Iris C.,"Miami, FL",203,49,288,2.0,1/22/2014,"Came here twice, and you would think it would be like any other cheesecake factory experience, but it's not. First of all, the service here is super slow, I understand that the restaurant is located at Dolphin mall which has more foot traffic when compared to Dadeland, but still the service and quality shouldn't change.  The first time I came here, we ordered the tomato basil pasta, and the pasta was under cooked. The waitress tried to play it off stating that it was ""al dente"" but it was far from being ""al dente"" so the waitress took it back to the chef, and they supposedly made us a new plate. Unfortunately, when the plate came out, it literally looked as if they dumped our plate of pasta into boiling water and just pour sauce over it again.  On the other hand, the ahi carpaccio was delicious, the fish was fresh, and I would definitely recommend this dish.  The second time here, we ordered the buffalo wings, and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was delicious, and it was very light and not heavily battered. Before we ordered the wings, we asked our waitress how many wings the plate comes with, and we were told 10 wings. When the dish came out, it was 8 wings and half were burnt. . We asked the waitress if she could exchange the burnt ones, she told my boyfriend to eat one, and she took the rest back. When it came back out, it was only 5 wings on the plate. We confronted our waitress, and she immediately asked, how many wings we have already eaten, and even checked under our plates. She then took it back it back to the kitchen again, and when it was brought back out she said that they weigh the wings by 10 ounces...after she already said it was 10 pieces of wings...so we paid $11.50 for basically 6 little wings. To replace the 4 missing wings from the order, our waitress brought out fries. meh.  Overall, this cheesecake factory needs to improve on their service and quality."
CJ R.,"Miami, FL",64,71,125,3.0,5/19/2015,"Oh well here I am again, as always back for the food because service is a hit and miss, more a miss than a hit... Our waiter a bit confused so I told him that much knife was dirty (this happens so no big deal) and dudes takes and never brings another knife; then soups came before the bread which we thought it was weird, I asked him about an item and while he did answer my question he did not explain the item so not cool at all..... 3 stars for the good food but service is compared to a midnight experience at Denny's or ihop..."
Nestor G.,"Miami, FL",1,17,58,3.0,3/19/2014,"Three-star restaurant. Service is good, fast and friendly. Received a well done steak instead of a medium-well, the manager did offer to take it back and cook me another one medium well however I rejected waiting any longer to eat."
Nicole W.,"Miami, FL",106,248,571,2.0,6/3/2015,Great service from Mecha!!...great food! But the plates are gritty and greasy. Even the replacements! My water had a black spot of God knows what...Yuck! Please replace your dishwasher!
Sofia K.,"Miami, FL",0,26,28,5.0,6/20/2015,Absolutely perfect! Had the Louisiana pasta and it was just a touch of spice to make it flavorful but not overpowering at all. Chicken was fresh and tender ! Highly recommended! It was pretty late but the service was still good and everyone was super attentive
Michael A.,"Carver, MA",81,269,275,3.0,5/22/2014,"Ok the food was awesome but they need some wifi in there. I brought a date who spoke no English, and I don't speak Spanish. There was absolutely no signal in there for our phones. Our plan was to use a translator app. Obviously we couldn't. It was awkward"
Jose P.,"Miami, FL",78,20,6,1.0,10/21/2013,"Avoid this place at all times!  Run if possible. I can't stress enough how bad this Cheesecake factory is. I have been here several times but as much as I try to like it they don't make it easy.  The waiters either are rude or lost, for instance I once asked for an extra plate and when I say that the guy threw it on the table I'm not exaggerating even the surrounding tables turned their heads.  And the food,  for a chain that is known for good food and xl portions this is apparently the black sheep. Even the burgers are bad, how can they mess up a burger. The pastas are saggy, tasteless greasy, I wasn't even offered cheese.   Stay away,  unless you are doing a paper on how to not run a restaurant."
Kristin G.,"Miami, FL",102,127,56,4.0,4/20/2014,"For being a chain restaurant, the service and food was pretty darn good (at least at this location). They just opened the Dolphin Mall location fairly recent, and it's pretty awesome because you can sit outside and people watch while you have a nice lunch. So, that is exactly what we did.  When you open up the menu, it kind of overwhelms you. There is page after page of delicious food options. To start, we order the sausage and ricotta flat bread. Wow, that was good! Since it was lunch, I ordered a Cobb Salad, nothing fancy, but geez the portion was huge (I dig that, get my money's worth) my husband ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, which he enjoyed (and I did as well lol)  We decided to skip dessert cause we were stuffed, but don't!! They have such a huge variety of cheesecake desserts that will blow your mind."
Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,9/12/2014,This Cheesecake Factory in Dolphin Mall is pretty new it used to be a BORDERS book store and they opened it in this old location it's really nice and big.Our waiter ROBERT was nice one of the best waiters I've ever had.I went to The Cheesecake Factory in Dolphin Mall with the family we all loved our food.
Elena I.,"Miami, FL",222,183,493,2.0,1/5/2014,"Sitting here as we speak with my family for Sunday brunch. My eggs Benedict had to be returned twice. The first time the egg yolk was over cooked and MIA.  The second time it was frozen in the middle.  3rd time is a charm right? WRONG! Now my eggs come out doused in paprika (paprika was not present in my other 2 orders)  which I happily ate because after almost 2 hours,  I was just starving.  With that said,  the manager was extremely apologetic and comped my meal. She was awesome.  However, our waiter was completely aloof. He never once came by check up on me,  never once asked if there was anything he could do...  In short,  he could give a s**t. Oh,  and my cousins meal was the last to some out.  It took forever.  I won't be back to the dolphin mall cheesecake factory....  No way!"
Carolina L.,"Miami, FL",1,4,23,1.0,9/6/2015,I had the worst service... Thos Sunday and since they are full they dont care too much. Jorge E. was my waiter and I was his face 2 times.. When i asked for the food and check. No bread at the begginer. Food the delicious. Service is worst.
Maple P.,"Miami, FL",0,21,47,4.0,10/10/2015,"One can never resist the desserts at The Cheesecake Factory. Try one and you will never regret the calories that were gained. Came with a party of 8. The hostess said the wait would be an hour long and gave us one of the beepers. It toke exactly one hour for us to get seated. Got here at 6:05pm and got seated at 7:05pm. Our waiter was a very sociable and energetic person. He immediately toke our drinks. I got strawberry lemonade. It was $4.95, the glass holding the lemonade has cystal sugar along the top lining. When ordering the entrées, the waiter would make a positive side comment on how the food choice we were making was excellent. Got annoying after he got the 5th order out of the 8. The waiter gave us 1 basket of bread with butter on a side plate. The bread basket comes with 2 mini loaf of wheat bread and 1 mini loaf of white bread. The white bread's crust was too hard, not burnt hard, but the hard that results when the time between baking the bread and eating it is long. On the other hand, the wheat bread was crispy, I could easy cut into this bread, and the inside was still warm and chewy. We got our food around 7:45 so it was like a 35 minute wait from ordering to receiving food. I got the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Note: the lighting is weird inside the restaurant. The lights give off as a shade of orange so everything in the restaurant looks like it's a shade of orange. When I got my pasta entrée I could not tell if I had gotten chicken or shrimp as the meat because the lighting made my entire dish orange colored, but once I tasted it, I could tell that it was chicken. Also, when it says SPICY Chicken Chipotle Pasta, it literally means spicy. I love spicy food no matter how extreme the spiciness is, but as a warning, don't get this platter if you do not like extremely spicy food (from 1 to 10, this is a level 9 spiciness). The waiter was around every now and then to make sure everything was good. When it came to getting boxes for our leftovers, we 1st asked for 3 boxes, but then realized we needed more. Gladly, the waiter didn't seem to mind making 2 more trips for boxes and bags. The food and service was excellent, I enjoyed my experience here overall, with the exception of the long waiting time."
Elizabeth G.,"Miami, FL",1132,104,,5.0,4/25/2015,"Went to eat with my clients and the food was awesome.  The service was excellent. My clients left the restaurant very happy.  Customer service, hot food and making you feel special is what it is all about.  Thank you Cheese Cake Factory and personnel."
Rodney W.,"Miami, FL",397,97,1085,4.0,10/7/2014,"The service here is awesome and the burgers are hand crafted!!! Sometimes it takes a bad experience to appreciate a great one.  Since I was off, I decided to take my daughter to lunch and some light shopping.  We started out at TGI Friday's, which is usually a safe bet.  NOT THIS TIME!!! The service and food was so bad, we packed up and left and ran to Cheesecake Factory. Talk about an 180 degree change!!! My only complaint were the two young hostesses took too long to seat us.  There were several available tables and I felt we should not have had to wait. But my server was awesome.  He was quick, knowledgeable and courteous.  My daughter was torn between the burgers, pasta and my recommendation. Eventually, she decided to go with the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and I got the Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger.  Both were excellent!!! The service was fast and came out piping hot.  I ordered my burger medium, but it was overcooked.  Our waiter apologized and before I knew it, another burger was being prepared.  We ended our lunch with a couple pieces of Cheese Cake, some laughs and another Father/Daughter moment."
Daylen D.,"Miami, FL",0,20,2,5.0,7/23/2015,"This location is a million times better than the one in coconut grove! Faster, friendlier, and better service overall!! The cheesecake was fresh and delicious, even on a weekday!! I always order the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake!!! It's delicious and I absolutely recommend it!!!"
Lonna R.,"Wilmington, DE",7,19,6,3.0,3/7/2014,My waiter never refilled my glass of water and tables too close together.  My thighs were touching the other couple to my right and left..lol btw Im not fat! Parking garage was hard to get out of
Ashley C.,"Miami, FL",49,17,7,3.0,4/28/2015,I can not say i am satisfied. The pizza i ordered for my daughter from the kids menu was soggy. And the food wasnt great. Only thing i will go there for in the future is the cheesecake..
Simon N.,"Miami, FL",1,3,8,2.0,6/10/2014,"Usually, i like the cheesecake factory, but tonight was an utter disappointment. Got sat, the waiter would walk by, nobody greeted us. Sat there for over 10 minutes with not even so much as water on the table. Finally this guy shows up, he'd been to all surrounding tables, looked at us, then back to whoever he was chatting with. Talked to them a little more, then finally came over to greet us , failed to mention his name and said that he would take the order now, all of a sudden he was in a hurry. I knew at that point that a manager would be involved by the end of the night..."
