Tony T.,"Miami, FL",22,45,1,4.0,3/15/2015,"There's an absolutely enormous amount of variety and the menu can definitely feel overwhelming as you look through the dozens of options. I finally settled on the four cheese pasta and the serving size was large enough for two people, which is great for sharing or taking home. Service was friendly and quick considering how packed the place was."
Mima A.,"Miami, FL",10,172,327,1.0,12/17/2014,the service today was terrible .our waitress was horrible.never brought water when she did it was warm no ice.bread was cold.we asked for more half hour later more cold bread.second  visit my last.i tried calling the company they don't care.
Cristina W.,"Hollywood, FL",594,262,206,2.0,7/10/2014,"For starters, i got attitude when i brought in my Smarte cart from Dolphin Mall, being that we're in a Cheesecake Factory located inside the Dolphin Mall vicinity.  I was told that they were not allowed inside at all, and they were not responsible if they were taken outside.  Ok, then why rent them out to people in the first place?! Aside from that, we were seated at a very busy area, so it seems.  Our food took forever to arrive, and forget about asking for extra drinks.. I particularly care very much for this chain, but will certainly not be visiting this location again."
Stephanie D.,"Miami, FL",33,85,66,5.0,6/11/2013,"My gf & I, along with a couple of her friends met up at this newest restaurant addition to Dolphin Mall. With a large array of meals on their menu, the only problem I for see when dining at the CheeseCake Factory is NOT knowing which plate to chose. In any case, my gf & I began with alcoholic beverages. I had the Strawberry Creamsicle, which in essence was a heavenly ""spiked"" milkshake, while my gf enjoyed ""The Ritz"" martini.      For our main course we ordered their ""most famous dish"", Chicken Madeira, for myself, & the Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken for my gf.. As usual, our dishes were bursting with flavor and go highly recommended. As our dessert, we selected the traditional strawberry cheesecake (which was enough for 3 people) topped with their own ""in-house made"" whipped cream. We weren't a huge fan of the glazed strawberry flavor, but it didn't stop us from cleaning the plate. Next time, we will be sure to try one of their other 20 plus varieties of cheesecake.       Overall, our waiter was attentive, the ambiance was relaxing & the food was delicious. So, if you're looking for a reasonable ($15-$20) flavorful meal with a generous serving portion, we highly recommend this restaurant.  ""barriga llena, corazon contento"""
Jose S.,"Miami, FL",450,302,541,3.0,1/28/2013,"A lot of people come to the Dolphin Mall. A lot of people want to eat in the Cheesecake Factory. You must have patience to wait 20-30 minutes, but worth it if you have a lot of hunger! Lunch with my girl for her birthday, tried to make reservations, you can't. Then we arrive and were told to wait 15-20 minutes. 15 minutes later beeper went off, 5 minutes after that we were seated. By looking at the 3 hosts and the manager walking in and out of the hosts booth, I can tell they were very busy yet organized. Other than that, everything else went well. The Cuban Sandwich was delicious, and the Chicken DiPana was amazingly exquisite. I stole the left overs from her. When she left them in my fridge and I ""Forgot to remind her."" UP side: Huge menu selection, huge plates, very tasty and good service. DOWN side: Can't make reservations, always busy, no prices on the cocktails until the check and it's in the Dolphin Mall."
Karolyn M.,"Miami, FL",37,28,186,1.0,1/20/2013,"Love Cheesecake Factory!! However service and food wait time are something to be desired at this location. We waited over 35 minutes for our meal to arrive. The only solace provided by the server was to tell me ""this happens a lot here"". The manager came over and discounted our meal by 20%. I've been to this location twice. First was great, second was horrible. Won't be returning for a 3rd - especially before trying to catch a movie."
Yindrys I.,"Miami, FL",20,3,1,1.0,3/1/2015,"Being the pasta lover that I am, I must say that today I had the most disgusting pasta ever! Let me start with the beginning, the bread, It was hard and burnt. The fried calamari appetizer was undercooked and chewy. The silverware was dirty. Our pasta was undercooked, watery and the chicken in the fettuccini looked like it was boiled rather than grilled and my husband's pizza was chewy. Not even my kids liked it, they didn't have the crayons and coloring paper that they usually give to kids in restaurants to keep them entertained. I am very disappointed and I will never go back, I rather eat at Olive Garden or Macaroni and Grill. And to top it off our bill was $100 for just 2 items from the kids menu a small personal pizza for my husband and my chicken fetuccini all from the lunch menu with no alcoholic beverages. This place is a ripoff! Oh I forgot two slice of cheesecake that were ""ok"" I've had better before. They are very overrated to be called the Cheesecake Factory."
Leo B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,3,1,2.0,1/12/2015,"Never been there before. BTW, my first time at TCF. I've had a slice of red velvet cheesecake. I'd say it was just ""OK"". For me, it doesn't seem to be right to pay about 8 dollars for a chunk of cream cheese almost without red velvet cake in it. And besides, Starbucks at Kendall sells the same slice for almost half the price."
Christina T.,"Miami, FL",18,2,4,4.0,5/21/2014,"I needed a quick bite and Cheesecake Factory was so much more appealing than the mall food court! I sat at the bar for dinner and had great service from bartender Carlos. First off, I savored their comp bread - yummyyy lol, then I ordered one of my favorite dishes, turkey and avocado sandwich from their skinnilicious menu with garden salad switched for a Cesar. It was absolutely delicious!! I definitely recommend trying items in their skinnilicious menu to save some calories and not sacrifice flavor! I always find their Cesar salad to be amazing; however, this time found it was way too heavily dressed so heads up if you order one at this location."
Natali V.,"Miami, FL",4,13,8,5.0,11/19/2014,The best cheese cakes of my life! And the food very good and services as well.  Very nice place and romantic to have a date with my boyfriend. Love it!
Belkis G.,"Miami, FL",0,14,,4.0,1/16/2013,"FINALLY! A cheesecake factory nearby. Came by on a Saturday night recently and the wait was about 45 minutes, not a problem since we went and had a beer at BWW. Where i did encounter a problem was in my beloved (always order the same thing) pasta. I always order the Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic...mind you this time around it came with pieces of shrimp and the tomatos were in big chunks (and this is after the meal took forever) I usually dont complain about food, because God knows what they do back there when you return the food. But I did mention to the server about the meal and she immidiately told the food manager (did not catch his name), who was just AWESOME about the whole ordeal. So because of that I will go back and order my pasta again ;) Oh and the Sweet Corn Tamale cakes were on point! YUM"
Sady A.,"Homestead, FL",9,10,5,1.0,5/31/2014,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. Went here on a double date last night and we had the worst service ever. Our waitress didn't even come back to ask us if we wanted refills, more bread, how the food was, or if we needed anything. She didn't even pick up the dirty plates from the appetizers. Overall bad experience."
Jacob C.,"Miami, FL",512,463,184,4.0,2/13/2013,"I don't generally like franchise places because they are all the same terrible quality food and they are terrible for you. Now I'm not saying that the food at Cheesecake Factory is good for you...because it is far from that...but it is freakin' delicious! I came to this new location with some friends and I was slightly disappointed because the dish I really wanted was no longer on the menu (Chicken & Biscuits).  So I looked over the menu for a while, which is a bit daunting because its pretty extensive...but I finally landed on a burger. This was not just any burger though. This particular burger had one of their deep fried mac and cheese balls smooshed on top of it and then more cheddar cheese is drizzled on top of that...then they add the other bun. When I read that on the menu...the little fat kid inside me started doing cartwheels! Needless to say, the burger was a mess...but that was expected..and welcomed. All in all...I can't wait to go back to Cheesecake Factory."
Juan S.,"Miami, FL",89,1406,31,3.0,2/11/2013,"Hadn't been to the Cheesecake Factory in a number of years... This is a relatively new location at the Dolphin Mall taking over the former Borders Bookstore space. As with most Cheescake Factories, the place is huge.  The menu is huge.  The portions are huge.  The crowds are huge.  The calorie counts are huge too! For a restaurant on steriods, this is the place."
Robert V.,"Miami, FL",75,63,11,1.0,8/30/2014,Absolutely the most horrible service ever. I ordered dinner portion and they brought me lunch. Took 10 minutes for a waiter to attend our table.never again.
Donald P.,"Columbia, MD",1,44,18,4.0,12/2/2015,I am not a fan of the Cheesecake Facory and came here as part of a group. I was very plenantly surprised. The beef medallions were delecious and served piping hot. The mashed potatoes and veggies were great as well. The waiter allowed us to each have individual checks even though there was 12 of us. The cheesecake desert did not disappoint.
Kelly L.,"Miami, FL",0,26,10,1.0,5/6/2013,"Dolphin mall is a great place to shop and the Cheesecake Factory could have not chosen a better location.  However, this location is much smaller and the wait time is longer. Even the bathrooms are less unique. There's only 3 stalls and there was a line waiting to wash hands. The good was not the best I've tasted from the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my usual which was the bistro shrimp pasta and the taste was awful. There was no zesty flavor and not enough cream. My nieces order the four cheese pasta and it looked like pasta mixed with a can of tomato sauce. My second ordered the chicken Romano and the chicken tastes like it was boiled with bread crumbs on top.  The good thing about this place was that our server was nice and very attentive. I think I will stick with Dadeland Cheesecake Factory until this location gets there food straighten out."
Shay P.,"Irving, TX",13,42,10,4.0,5/11/2014,"This is a regular go to for me.  I can always find something I like.  There food it always consistent, no matter what city I'm in.  My favorite is the jambalaya.  Its spicy and full of chicken and shrimp.  mmmm mmmm"
Natalie A.,"Miami, FL",0,15,,3.0,8/2/2015,"I usually have wonderful experiences at The Cheesecake Factory, but I had never been to the one at Dolphin and it was a very underwhelming experience, unfortunately. First off, too many tourists. They walk in with the enormous suitcases that they just purchased at the mall and take up all the room in the tiny lobby of the restaurant. The doors are opened so frequently that the lobby is more of a sauna; full of hot air and it feels disgusting. Plus, the constant wind from the door opening does nothing good for your hair. Don't ever wait for your table in there; it's better to wait outside. Second: Dirty, dirty, dirty. I joked with my boyfriend that the restaurant was so dimly lit because they wanted to try to cover up how dirty everything actually is, and I probably wasn't too far off. The floor by our table was disgusting; crumbs and God knows what else all over the place, and my boyfriend said his side of the floor felt wet. Two bussers came to clean up the table next to us after the family had left and did what can only be called a mediocre job. My boyfriend used to be a busser, and he was shaking his head the whole time as he watched in horror how they ""cleaned"" the table. What looked like a dirty cloth was carelessly swiped across the table a few times, and then the CLEAN utensils were placed directly onto the table (with no napkin or plate beneath them) by the bare hands of the second busser, who was grabbing the utensils by the part you put your food on. Gross. My boyfriend said that bussers probably have the dirtiest hands next to the dishwashers (because they are the ones that pick up the dirty plates and cups when everyone leaves), and these were the guys touching the clean utensils people were about to eat with. Why not wrap up the utensils in napkins like every other restaurant? Needless to say I was a little disgusted.  Granted, we went on a Saturday night to Dolphin Mall (always a mistake because of parking, crowds, and wait times) so service was not the best. I told the waitress to give me max five minutes to decide on what I wanted to order, and she avoided our table for the next fifteen minutes. She was kind, always made sure we had water, and brought me extra cheese for my pasta immediately. But, she took a long time in coming around to take our orders and it was hard to get her attention to come to our table. I can only complain about one aspect of the food; the complimentary bread that they brought was stale. We were given one of each bread, and the white one was hard as a rock. You could tell it wasn't made fresh, that loaf had been sitting somewhere for hours and that's what they brought us. The other loaf was warm and soft; that's how you know.  Our meals were delicious because you can't go wrong with anything at the Cheesecake Factory. The plates are enormous and you will definitely leave in a food coma. The cheesecakes are delicious and big enough to split between two people (although my boyfriend claimed he could have finished the mango key lime cheesecake all by himself). I have no complaints about our food, it was great, but the overall experience was not what I had anticipated from this restaurant. I think it's just the location and the fact that it was a Saturday night, but the mediocre cleaning done by bussers is something to worry about. I'll stick to the Dadeland location for future outings."
Melyssa S.,"Makawao, HI",52,15,137,3.0,10/24/2013,"This Restaurant is nothing like the Cheesecake Factory at downtown Waikiki. Food not so great. Dimly lit, greasy floors (almost fell). The plus is that our waitress was extremely pleasant which is why I gave it a 3 star. Everything else rated only star."
