Connie S.,"Miami, FL",9,3,,5.0,5/7/2014,Wait for table was acceptable -Service and Food were spectacular;) extremely accommodating for semi-large group of 6 adults 3 children under the age of 3 & an 8 year old. I will definitely return!
Sandra M.,"Miami, FL",154,12,43,2.0,12/7/2014,"Last night my boyfriend and I decided to go out to eat at Cheesecake Factory. We have been to this chain of restaurants numerous of times, for the most part the services and food is always great! Our experience last night was terrible, the service was worst than going to Chilis (that in my opinion is bad), I'm very critical of the service I get because both my boyfriend and I worked in the restaurant business for about 10 years combined. Honestly, the food was great, and the restaurant was not very busy we went around 6:30pm. Our server took 30 minutes to bring out our cheesecake and then about another 15 minutes to bring us our check. The only question she asked throughout our meal was ""would you like split checks?"", WHAT!? Not once did she ask about our food, or our experience. I don't think I will be coming to Cheesecake Factory at Dolphin Mall, I'd rather go to Cheesecake Factory at Dadeland Mall where I have always received amazing service!"
Megan G.,"Miami, FL",9,40,,5.0,5/11/2014,I've been to this C&F twice. Haven't experienced any problems yet. The staff is super cool. Food is delish! Fast service too! Highly recommend!
Rosaly C.,"Miami, FL",140,13,3,5.0,3/31/2014,Hands down THE BEST CHEESE CAKE FACTORY! It meets the expectation of the name & price for food. Everywhere you sit is pretty spacious and comforting. The servers are awesome I've been here over 6 times in less than a year and that says a lot. The food is served in time. Just a great experience by far. And I think I will remain going here.
Jeenee Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",2336,572,5843,3.0,12/30/2013,great vibe...good food. plus was seated quick! ^_^
Leslie G.,"Miami, FL",200,204,708,3.0,6/25/2013,i love this place! the menu is so large i never know what to get. on this visit i ordered the fish and chips but was not thrilled about it :( however the tuxedo cheesecake was amazing!!!!!!
Liz L.,"Miami, FL",1,15,34,4.0,1/2/2013,"Love this place. The service was great tonight. Our waiter ""sean"" was excellent. The food...to die for. The restaurant is small so there is always some wait to be seated. Luckily for us we were seated just after 10 minutes."
Mickey W.,"Miami, FL",288,22,3,1.0,12/23/2014,"Slowest, least attentive service I've ever experienced. We waited 45 mins to place our lunch order. We waited nearly 50 mins for our food (3 salads) to come out and one of the salads was missing. It came out 5 minutes later and was not even the salad we ordered (!). Had we not been starving with a baby, we'd have left and cancelled our order. Will never return."
Sarah S.,"Spartanburg, SC",33,39,27,5.0,4/17/2013,I always leave here regretting eating a much as I did. But geeze everything I've had here is yummo. New location so its very clean. Very nice bar and tons of adult drink choices ;)
Joe W.,"Justin, TX",132,525,300,4.0,5/4/2013,"The regular food is just average, but the desserts are as good as it gets."
Usm U.,"Miami, FL",0,16,,1.0,5/14/2013,"This cheesecake factory at dolphin, is not at all unto the standards of the other cheesecake locations. the food is terrible. the shepards pie was not how it was supposed to look. it looked like mashed potato dumped with beef at the sides. horrible. and the chicken fajita was bleeh. no taste -no flavor.  The table did not have knives available. i HAD TO ASK THE WAITER.  If you want mall food, then this location is perfect - the quality is just like foodcourt  quality. not worth the money !"
Barbara O.,"Hialeah, FL",0,1,,1.0,1/25/2014,"Hi, Ok I had been dying to try out this restaurant because dolphin mall is closer to us than dade land, however after tonight I have to tell you I rather take the drive. We were seated outside as asked with 40 minutes of our arrival, when we were seated we noticed a table of like 20 pre teens being loud and disruptive, now I have nothing bad to say about loudness because I'm pretty loud but they were over the top and no one told them anything this is supposed to be a romantic restaurant and to me that's unacceptable shame on the manager!  We ordered the crab wontons, and I must say the filling is delicious it is well cooked soft and has plenty of crab but the outside was extremely burnt. Then the pasta my husband and I both ordered pastas and when they came to the table they looked more like soup, this restaurant is known for big portions and I have to say the plate was huge but it was all sauce followed by a spoonful of pasta and a couple of pieces of chicken.  The only good part of the dinner was the cheesecake, which unfortunately had the macadamia nuts frozen!!!  At least I enjoyed it once I took off the nuts. On a good note out waiter tony was very nice and made sure we had plenty of bread and that are drinks were always full. Thank you tony!!! Managers:step it up, this is not Cheesecake Factory material Word of advice to consumers go to the one at dadeland!!"
Layne R.,"Philadelphia, PA",124,4,,1.0,5/13/2013,"Terrible service. I came in on a monday morning at around 12. No waiting time so this was a plus. However, I waited 15 minutes to be greeted once I sat down, it was as if I wasn't there. This place was not busy... AT ALL. By the time my waiter came i was ready for my full order. They had just opened so I expected some fresh warm bread my favorite at any Cheesecake Factory. The bread was stale and cold. I asked for a water no ice with lemon instead I was given a glass of water that was appropriate for some tea boiling. Took another 30 minutes... 30 whole minutes for my food to arrive. This literally made my blood boil, I had just ordered a plain seared tuna salad. How they managed to make this take so long I will never understand this isn't even a cooked menu item. When i finally got my salad after my waiter, who was quite nice, apologized for the delay I couldn't wait to dig in. Until I realize that the tuna was old. I just ate the greens and left the tuna untouched. I pointed this out to my waiter who ten proceeded with a crapy excuse. Seriously the worst Cheesecake Factory I've stepped foot on. I will not be coming back here. The best part of this whole experience was walking out of this place."
Stephanie H.,"Hialeah, FL",0,4,,1.0,3/25/2014,"I love going to the Cheesecake Factory because of the variety of food choices. However, on my last visit my waitress was someone who wasn't attentive. She was very sarcastic and rude. She took forever to bring the appetizer which was something really simple. Also she never brought water to my table until I asked her to. I waited 50 minutes for my entree and she wasn't the one to bring it to my table because right when I asked her she told me it had a few more minutes left and as she walked away a different waiter came to bring my food which was cold! My waitress wasn't even aware that my meal was ready so it was sitting there getting cold. Her name is Melissa P. To be honest i don't think my family and I will ever be going to Cheesecake Factory again because this was my worst experience at a restaurant. We were really upset."
Wendy H.,"Miami, FL",75,93,20,3.0,4/21/2013,"you know it is the cheesecake factory...sometimes good, sometimes not so good...like any chain restaurant."
Rosa J.,"Miami, FL",90,26,5,5.0,6/12/2013,"This is the newest location in miami. Dolphin mall gets very busy so do all their restaurants hence, putting a cheesecake factory here does not help with the parking.  I have to say tho the wait was not bad at all. We came in a Monday to meet up some friends for dinner. My gf had the strawberry popsicle, she discribes it as a milkshake spiked w rum..and I had the ritz which I think was too strong to start off with. The mojito on the other hand is very refreshing and should of ordered that instead. Moving to the food, I ordered the chicken lemon herb. I did not read the discription and this was a quater chicken and i was expection a chicken breast, but not to worry because the dish did not disappoint at alllll!  The perfect seasoning to the chicken of lemon and herb was magnificent!  The chicken was not dry, the mash potatoes were a bit cool but the vegtables were very good. My gf had the chicken marsala, i have to say that it was good but not my favorite dish. We had an amazing time and the waiter was GREAT, i am a hard customer to please, but this young man was on point at all times. I will def go again."
Marcial R.,"Houston, TX",52,67,10,5.0,3/16/2013,"It's always hard to review a place I love. So, I will try! First I will list what I had to eat. I had the best waitress in a LONG time! Bobby was friendly fast and very knowledgeable ! I had the Chicken and biscuits with coffee and THE STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE! Yes , I yelled it! It was that good!   First the entree , this once was a monster of a meal. There was enough for two meals and drenched in thick awesome gravy.  This time around, the size was pared down but all the classic ingredients were still present, the pan fried crusted chicken breast, the house made biscuit, fluffy mashed potatoes and tastes carrots, peas and mushrooms lightly covered in a thinner less creamy gravy. I am sure my waistline appreciates the smaller portions and so does my taste buds. They were screaming for mercy  later after the decedent short cake. A tower of sweet candies strawberries atop creamy vanilla ice cream placed between a huge fluffy biscuit and topped with a pyramid of whipped cream that a pharaoh would envy. Who should think that a dessert this great would rival the namesake of this establishment? and the proverbial icing on the cake . My sweet Bobby, she was such a joy. My coworkers salad was not as ordered and she didn't even let the plate touch the table before she took it and replaced it with the correct item. All with a smile and a speed of cheetah!  I have never ever asked to be seated in a waitstaff area. When I return, I WILL ask for Bobby.s section! Even if I have to wait longer."
