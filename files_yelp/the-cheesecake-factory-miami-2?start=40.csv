Alana A.,"Miami, FL",583,358,893,5.0,3/2/2016,"Came here for a staff lunch on a Friday afternoon - about 15 of us. We were seated within a matter of minutes. This location felt very clean and well-maintained. I ordered the crispy Cuban rolls and the chicken sliders appetizers. Both were fresh and delicious. Everyone else in my party seemed to have been happy with their meals as well. Service was very quick, attentive, and friendly. This has been my only experience at this Cheesecake Factory location, but it definitely won't be my last! Everything was great."
Grace B.,"Washington, DC",170,122,437,5.0,7/11/2015,"Lately, I have been getting their cheesecake often. The oreo is my favorite. But the last dish I had here were the Baja Tacos. They were a little spicy but this dish can easily satisfy two people. The diced tomatoes, cool lettuce and sizzling chicken tossed in my mouth delightfully. I couldn't get enough. The small side of rice and beans weren't necessary to satisfy me but they tasted great!  I selected this dish because as soon as I walked into the restaurant a waiter walked passed me with two orders and the aroma flared my nostrils, watered my mouth and I just HAD to have it. No regrets."
Joe T.,"Dyersburg, TN",3,25,8,4.0,5/19/2017,Nice place to relax and eat. The service is great and the food is good. We really enjoy coming here whenever we in town.
Matt G.,"Morrisville, NC",36,630,,3.0,2/21/2016,"Location is good right inside the mall, I enjoyed taking a stroll inside the mall before and after my dinner. I had only had the cheesecake before but never tried a main course at the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is like a book, too big, when there are so many dishes I wonder if really all of them can be made with good quality.  Service was friendly and attentive and I liked the atmosphere inside, lighting music etc at the right level. But, the reason I give 3 stars instead of 4 is simple, even if the food is good, the price is too high for what it is. My shrimp pasta did not have enough shrimps in it to justify the 19 dollars. Also I expected more flavor.  You would think a chain restaurant would be cheaper, but it's not. At least this is the case for the pasta dishes, the others in my group had salads that were reasonably priced and big portions. Cheesecakes are obviously good for sure, but food might be a bit hit or miss."
Stan D.,"Miami, FL",0,194,15,4.0,6/12/2017,"A place to get a variety of food and a large dessert menu, especially Cheesecake."
Leyani L.,"Boston, MA",230,257,10,3.0,3/22/2016,It was simply OK! nothing stood out and nothing was bad. But here are some things I can list for your knowledge: 1. Come early because by 1:30pm on a Thursday the line was getting crazy.  2. Plenty of food at reasonable prices.  3. Outdoor seating.  4. Huge dining room area so big parties are welcome.  5.  waitresses are VERY cute!
Stephanie R.,"Miami, FL",5,2,,2.0,6/7/2017,Ok type restaurant . In blue collar neighborhood . PLEASE DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS . This is where many CHEATERS MEET THEIR HOOKERS ! Omg !  Cheesecake Factory dolphin mall
Vero L.,"Doral, FL",61,30,35,4.0,5/29/2017,"There's always parking, the food is excellent (you can share them all they are GIANT) I give it 4 stars just because is always full and you have to wait but it is worth it"
Brenda R.,"Townsend, GA",108,135,278,5.0,4/5/2017,We are lucky to have these all over.  The quality of food for consistency of ingredients is outstanding.  I hate to spend a lot of money and you are letdown.  There is a time and place for chains like this.  If you have ever walked into a locally own restaurant and could smell odd odors you know what I mean.
Anabel M.,"Hialeah, FL",151,72,116,4.0,2/20/2017,"I usually come here for lunch whenever I'm at Dolphin Mall. The wait isn't too long, considering it's always packed. The only dish I've been disappointed by is the veggie burger. It started falling apart the minute they placed the plate on the table. Other than that, the food is yummy and the service is decent. Sometimes it takes a while to get a hold of a server because the place is always full. Every piece of cheesecake I've tried has been delicious. I recommend going during the week when the mall isn't filled with people."
Andry M.,"Miami, FL",4,9,18,5.0,11/2/2015,"Cheesecake Factory is always a good idea, you can find almost anything in their menu and they never disappoint.  Note: the Dolphin Mall location recently expanded their patio section, which is awesome!"
Alyssa G.,"Miami Beach, FL",55,18,30,5.0,10/22/2015,"Always great service with even better food! Large selection could be overwhelming, especially if you're as indecisive as I am! The Pasta Da Vinci is my favorite, and definitely enough for two people.  Tip: save room for their cheesecake!"
Sanita M.,"Tampa, FL",125,383,2135,3.0,7/27/2015,"I have always been a fan of Cheesecake Factory - great food (dinner and cakes) but I came in for breakfast and this was one of my least favorite meals. We stayed at the hotel right next to the mall, and usually we do have breakfast at the hotel were I enjoy potatoes and scrambled eggs. This time we decided to go to the Cheesecake Factory. I never had breakfast here before but I absolutely love their dinner dishes like salads, tamale, etc., and of course the cakes. Anyways, in my opinion this is not a good place for breakfast. First, breakfast items on the menu are pretty expensive, the portions are small and the quality (plus, the wait!) is not worth the money. Breakfast cost about $12 and it had 2 eggs (scrambled, my choice), 3 slices of tomatoes and brick hard, over fried potatoes, that were very oily. I love potatoes, I even order mash potatoes on the side, but I think these were the worst potatoes. Not only they were oily, they were almost burned, so hard I could not stick a fork in them. When I asked the waitress why potatoes are so hard and tiny, she said ""That's the way they are here!"" Hmmm.. ok, good to know. As for my husbands dish, he ordered Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and it came out with oily (I guess it's American style) bacon with almost no meat, just fat. She did apologize though and bought out the right bacon on a side. So I'm giving two stars for my visit here because I liked my scrambled eggs. We also ordered a cake to go. Have to admit, that Oreo Cheesecake was way, way too sweet, so no extra star here. P.S. I think that Cheesecake Factory should learn how to cook breakfast potatoes. I prefer Denny's potatoes that are crispy from outside and soft from inside. I can actually chew them without breaking my tooth."
Indiana M.,"Miami, FL",107,11,23,5.0,9/17/2016,"I am a big fan of their entire menu my goal is to try everything on it. This one at Dolphin is always super busy and it's a little hard to get a table right away. However, I don't see a problem with waiting because the food and service is worth it. I discovered the meatloaf and it was to die for. It was tasteful and I was wanting more and more."
Yvelin R.,"Miami, FL",1295,413,2255,4.0,7/30/2014,"Love this place! I might not enjoy how crowded it usually is and how long it sometimes takes for the whole experience, but I still like their food and desserts. Who am I kidding? I'd prob be happy if I only had their breads (I love bread and theirs is pretty yummy) and desserts!  Their menu has so many things to choose from, it's def hard to pick a favorite item. We've tried their burgers, pastas, quesadillas, shepherds pie and several appetizers. One of my fav dishes from here  is the Parmesan crusted chicken Romano. It's a great dish to share since it brings 2 chicken breasts and enough pasta for two. When it comes to desserts I have to go with their dulce de leche or carrot cake cheesecakes. Omg! To die for...and I don't event like cheesecake!"
Julia G.,"Miami, FL",0,3,1,5.0,8/12/2016,Love this place. The teriyaki chicken was so delicious with the pineapples and bananas on the side. Sooo good! Plus the Godiva brownie dessert I ordered was by far the best. So rich and decadent. Could eat that 24/7
Orlando R.,"Brooksville, FL",0,19,2,2.0,7/15/2016,"I have been coming to this establishment since it open and it has always been a pleasant visit, except for today, we were seated near the bar so our server was the bartender ""Danny"" it was not crowded since we arrived when they open, it took 30 minutes for our food to arrive I order the Rigatoni with Shrimp and Sausage unfortunately the Sausage was burnt since I  was  in lunch time and it took a while to get our food I worked around the burnt Sausage and ate the rest."
Lexis G.,"Hialeah, FL",462,17,78,5.0,5/15/2016,"The service is always a plus every time I come here! I must warn you it is always full but you get seated quickly and it's worth the wait!! The pasta here is just perfect and the cheesecake is simply the best! I recommend the red velvet cheesecake, and the chocolate tuxedo if your a chocoholic like me!"
Giovanna H.,"Miami, FL",174,233,343,1.0,2/16/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I have many many years of being a regular at this chain restaurant. But I really dislike this location and it just disappoints me every time I go back. There's always an issue with the service or the food. My food always turns out cold, incorrect or just plain bad. And then there's the service. They're not very attentive and they're extremely careless."
Jorge R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",30,36,104,2.0,2/17/2015,"Cheesecake Factory!! Why did i mention to my wife to go there!! I am giving 2 stars because i like the Crab cakes.To begin with we waited 15 min to be seated which is ok because is a very popular restaurant so it remains busy!  We order Crab Cakes (our favorite), the guacamole and the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. We got only the first 2 and the mushrooms never came. Our server took our order then he didn't show up back to the table until it was time to pay. We were really thirsty, never got a water refill. And the best one was that they were charging me for the mushrooms i never got! I was wondering where was the manager. We really don't want to go back with that kind of service."
