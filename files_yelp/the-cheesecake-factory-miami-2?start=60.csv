Kiki I.,"Doral, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/1/2017,"Loved in the past tense I how I describe how i feel about the Cheesecake Factory.  The 12th St restaurant provided one of the worst dining experiences I had in a long time:  Waited 55 minutes to get our food and only after I got up and asked the manager if there was something wrong in the kitchen and when we did get our food it was truly bad.   Some details of the night - We sat a table that was not clean.  The waitress was friendly but knew nothing about service.  We got our drinks but never asked again if we wanted others, our water glasses were empty until we asked for more water, and our salad was served after we had our main course which was an hour after we sat. The chicken Madeira looked like it has been dropped and then sat on the hot lamp for 50 minutes, which is probably what happened.  The cheese which normally sits on top of the chicken was melted on the side of the plate and the Madeira sauce was so dry it did not want to come off the plate (I actually took a picture of how bad this presentation was).  Very few time in my life have I sent back a plate, but this was bad enough that I did and lost my appetite.   My wife order the usual Jambalaya which was not as usual - this one was dry and the noddles were stuck together like when pasta is overcooked.  I think this plate sat under the hot lamp too long as well. The manager tried to make up for the dining experience by offering us free cheesecakes but lost the meaning of the apology when she and the waitress were laughing and pointing at us when she did not realize we were watching her. I will never return to this Cheesecake Factory and if others go via this same route, I will easily take my business elsewhere."
Yanet B.,"Miami, FL",116,10,27,4.0,3/10/2016,"First time visiting this location and it was absolutely amazing! I went with a group of friends for my boyfriends birthday. My friends got a table and we joined them later. Let's start off by saying that the server greeted us as soon as we sat down and took our drink orders. We then ordered appetizers and our meals right before the drinks came. I'm not sure if it was because the restaurant was full (mind you it was Tuesday) or the kitchen was under staffed but out food took really long. We got another round of drinks by the time the appetizers came, and another before our meal arrived. What saved the night was that our server was being super attentive and was nice enough to bring us more bread and butter refills. I ordered a Cobb salad with crispy chicken and it was very delicious but it was HUGE! None of my friends had any complains about their food either. Tried their salted caramel cheesecake for the first time and I'm ranking it on top of the Oreo one. They even wrote happy birthday on my boyfriend's cheesecake! Overall a great experience. Will definitely come back"
Kimberly K.,"Miami, FL",933,183,389,4.0,5/20/2014,"Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE restaurant! It's reasonably priced food with large amounts! 4-6pm it happy hour, and ironically I happened to be there for that. My boyfriend and I shared the Chinese chicken salad (or maybe it's called Asian chicken salad?) as an appetizer while waiting for our friend, Priscilla to arrive. I ordered the lunch portion, knowing the dinner is ginormous. I never order salads anywhere else except THIS particular salad at cheesecake cause it's literally THE BEST SALAD IVE EVER HAD! Wonton crisps, fresh romaine, crispy stringy chip things, mandarin oranges, almond shavings, lots of chicken, cheesecake's exclusive plum dressing, SOOO AMAZING.  as the entree, we ordered their Parmesan crushed chicken Romano. I've had it before and it's delicious but for some reason... It was too salty today :/ not sure if it's the chef or location... But I'm disappointed. Anyway, cheesecake only does happy hour at the bar so we paid at our table for our meals and moved over to their bar for dessert and drinks :P I ordered their lemonade which had skyy vodka and YOWZA they sure were friendly with that vodka and I for $5. Haha! needless to say, I definitely needed to order a cheesecake to take care of that drink. Also, I never leave without ordering a cheesecake! It's so worth it. I love trying a new one each time. Today, we all shared their Godiva. YUMMMYYY. The top is powdered with cocoa, the middle is a layer of dark chocolate cheesecake and a cream. The bottom is moist chocolate cake. All made out of Godica chocolate, of course. And there was a PERFECT Godiva chocolate sqaure to garnish the top. I would order this cheesecake again and recommend everyone to as well! Same goes for the Chinese chicken salad. As for the Romano dish... Eh... Try it at another location hahha"
Alexia N.,"Miami, FL",16,23,6,2.0,5/7/2017,"Food is mediocre, the entrance mainly has a terrible oder of a dirty rag!!! It stinks horrible and turned me off from the moment I walked in. I told the hostess on duty and she just blew me off. I often go to Dadeland location and like it there and enjoy the service. Dolphin needs to step it up and start by not using smelly rags."
Gaby F.,"Miami, FL",224,184,810,3.0,2/2/2015,"I give it almost a 3. Chain restaurants might not be my all-time-favorite but sparingly, i go there. Of the three times ive gone once i had great service, Tony; the other two times i had others servers and they just appeared very tired, still there for us but not too helpful or attentive. The appetizers were pretty good, yummy sweet tamales. So was the tuna tartare. For the pastas its a hit or miss, i ve had great pasta and I've had the blandest of them. Some pasta with shrimp in a tomato sauce that tasted like nothing, i think it didnt even had salt. The salads are tasty though, and good portions too.  As of cheesecakes well, you can imagine. Large variety, several of them delicious.  If its not a day to spend too much id come here, id just be careful to make good choices. Hence, i suggest you ask your server for recommendations. And if you can try to have Tony as your server; you wont regret it."
Martin S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",5,10,,3.0,6/27/2016,"The lowdown on the Cheescake Factory: A plethora of menu items, acceptable quality of food, and sub-par service.  Sometimes it is difficult to decide what to order at this restaurant chain because there are so many items to choose from. Don't get too bogged down in the menu, and choose whatever you feel like eating. I had the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. The sauce was overly watery, but didn't detract from the meal too much. It lacked that explosion of flavor, though. The thing that irked me the most was the service. I got to the restaurant around 4:00 PM and was seated within five minutes. About ten minutes later, another party was seated next to mine. Their server took their order before mine, who didn't come for another ten minutes. I also had to ask for utensils and bread, which should be commonplace among all of these restaurants. Hopefully, I will get better service next time, but all-in-all, the experience was simply average."
John P.,"Magnolia, TX",189,124,468,3.0,1/27/2016,"Cheesecake Factory is one of those places we don't visit often, but when we decide to everyone gets pretty excited. There seem to be high expectations given the size and scope of the place and their menu. Unfortunately, it's also a place that seems to always let us down. The service is mediocre, even if they're happy, because they're so overworked. And the food always takes too long to come out, and is only ever mediocre at best.   The Miami location is no different from any of these perspectives than any other Cheesecake Factory. Overall, it's edible. But also regrettable."
Helen C.,"Miami, FL",222,11,2,5.0,1/13/2016,"I came here today for lunch for my boyfriends birthday, our server was named (alexandra) she was extremely attentive and came by our table several times to ask how our food and drinks were! my boyfriend had a lunch pasta with chicken and i had the chicken tacos, so good! huge portions we left with a to-go bag. without me even mentioning to her i guess she noticed it was his birthday on his ID when he ordered a drink, she brought over a couple of staff and they sang happy birthday and gave us a free little ice-cream desert. defiantly will be going back and she left with a good tip!  nothing beats good food and good service!"
Julie C.,"Doral, FL",1,33,36,5.0,2/13/2016,I had never been to this location which i always tend to go to this mall . The wait wasn't long I sat outside which it was nice . The staff was so nice my waiter was Mario super nice . The food and drinks was so good I had a fruit passion margarita and chicken pasta tomato and basil and how can't I left with no dessert I tried the snickers cheesecake the bomb
Maria A.,"Miami, FL",197,377,1064,4.0,3/26/2014,"Went there today for lunch with my sister. I didn't know that they had opened a location at Dolphin Mall. The restaurant is nicely decorated, surprisingly there was no wait time, we were seated immediately. Our server was very attentive, we started off by ordering crab bites for appetizers. It was small but tasty. For the main course I ordered a Kobe burgers and my sister ordered their jambalaya. I think I ordered My Kobe burger over cooked as it was dried, the onions were burned and it just didn't taste good. My sister's jambalaya looked really good and she loved it.  Overall for me the food was ok but not their fault as I should have ordered my beef rare. Oh well!"
Hilda H.,"Miami, FL",570,339,7455,4.0,4/13/2013,"Booth 101 best seat in the entire restaurant!!   Another venue has opened to our convenience at Dolphin mall. Cheesecake factory has turned out to be like a Pf Chang's, hey are pretty much in every important mall you may think of. I have come many times to the Cheescake Factory but hadn't expedience the one at Dolphin until  a few days back. They are known for good food, spacious interior, big booth and delicious deserts, and of course their cheesecake. I usually don't venture off my favorite dish, so i usually have it every time i go. I will venture out and try the wines and appetizers. I usually order the five cheese penne pasta with jumbo shrimp. I love their New Zealand wine (Matua). This time i was feeling adventurous and tried the crab stuffed mushrooms with their small arugula salad.  The mushrooms were very delicious, the caps melted in your mouth and they were overstuffed with crab which its always a great compliment. This venue has a good sitting area and the inside i recommend to sit at table 101, its the most private and intimate setting in the entire restaurant, come and you'll see why."
Jordan T.,"Miami, FL",50,80,161,3.0,2/23/2016,"Like any other Cheesecake Factory, this one is large, busy, and upscale with beautiful interior design and knowledgeable, attentive staff."
Kate V.,"Miami, FL",58,22,28,5.0,6/6/2016,"I have been to many locations through south Florida, this one is the best by far, the staff is friendly, the food never dissapoints. The last time I went for a work lunch I had the Thai salmon and it was cooked to perfection laid on a bed of mashed potatoes and curry sauce, I also ordered a side of grilled asparagus and they were scrumptious. We tried 3 of their cheesecakes, and we were not dissapointed."
Katrella S.,"Miami, FL",157,124,272,5.0,8/16/2015,This was a good date night dinner.  After watching Straight Out Of Compton we ventured to the Cheese Cake Factory for dinner.  Instead of waiting for a table we opted to sit in the bar area.  Service was fast and allowed us time to make decisions about what we wanted to eat.  I had the crispy crab cakes and salmon shrimp scampi combo. I was so full I had to take home a carry out over half of my dinner.
Jessica W.,"Miami Beach, FL",116,317,499,4.0,1/1/2016,"The huge variety of menu options makes this place great when going with a group of people with different tastes.  They have a spacious patio section, which is nice to sit outside and enjoy the weather.  The food is good and the service, friendly; a solid choice in Dolphin Mall."
Jeanine M.,"Miami, FL",133,102,110,2.0,6/27/2016,"We ask the wait time on a Sunday at 4:30 and the girl at the front tells us 20 minutes so we decide to wait and get some drinks at the bar.. Should've known it was going to be a disaster when I noticed there were more people standing waiting for tables than there were people sitting at tables.. (SO MANY EMPTY TABLES) anyway, It had been 40 minutes and still nothing so we went to the girls at the front and told them it's been a while and they said that they called us but the buzzer never rang... So then they said they would call us next but they call 4 other parties before us so we tell them something AGAIN and we finally are walking to our table (passing plenty of empty tables) and she decides to sit us in a booth for 4 people when we're 5... So I mention that I had seen a few booths for 6 people and she had to go ask so as we wait some more, she sits us at a table that was better for a party of 8.... Made no sense at all. Total time we had been waiting to finally get seated was an hour and 24 minutes. Ridiculous. Girls in the front need some more training."
David C.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,4,,1.0,9/3/2016,"Waited in booth 15 minutes with no server, no eye contact with multiple passing servers, finally flagged one down. Food fair at best. Stopped to by dessert on way out. Again, service slow, no greeting, no smile, no thank you.  Dessert was tastey for later treat back at motel. The service at this restaurant was truly terrible. Entree's poor."
Gustavo S.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",1,150,146,3.0,7/30/2016,"I love the selections they have on there menu. So, far the times I have come here the service and food have been great. The last entrée I tried here, I wasn't impressed the catfish tasted muddy. The cornmeal batter was perfect and also the sides. I'll stay away from this dish next time. But, I would like to complain about one thing, they took out the pineapple upside down cheesecake. Hopefully they would bring it back."
Heidi M.,"Miami, FL",164,114,404,4.0,5/18/2015,"I have been to this location multiple times. It is a great addition to Dolphin Mall as TCF has a menu that can please just about every palate. Generally, the food is well-made. However, the last time I went my spicy cashew chicken was not spicy and way too sugary. I was in a lunch rush or I would have sent it back. In all fairness, whenever I have had a problem with a dish before they always corrected it. The white wines are always served perfectly chilled and the bar menu is fairly extensive!"
