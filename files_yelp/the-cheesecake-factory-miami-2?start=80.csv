Mark K.,"Miami, FL",71,1,1,1.0,1/16/2017,Service was good. But there was a very large lizard that would stroll the area. It seemed to have some type of issues and was attached to one of the waiters. But it continued to agrivate my date. She was very confused by the situation. I don't recommend this place. I'd you don't like Lizards.
Bennet M.,"Austin, TX",224,236,423,4.0,5/21/2014,"YES PLEASE!!!! I'm a big fan of cheesecake and in love with their Dulce de Leche one. Believe it or not, their pumpkin cheesecake is so scrumptous!! Takes just like pumpkin pie if you're into that stuff. They only have it during the holidays so try it out if you can. I try to get something different but I'm in love with the Pasta Da Vinci. This plate is huge so I end up sharing with someone else. Always on point! Customer service is pretty good. They're always friendly to us and never leave us with a glass that is half empty. Not a big fan of their drinks so I stick with wine. Try not to go here during the weekend, if not, just be prepared to wait for a while. I mean it's Dolphin Mall, this place never sleeps. Yes the food is good but I come here so I can complete my order for what it is known for. CHEESECAKE!! Haven't tried a better one so until then, I would continue to get my Dulce de leche cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory :)"
Melisa M.,"Miami, FL",43,10,6,5.0,4/24/2016,"I have come here several times, and every single time I'm amazed at the amazing quality of this restaurant. I have ordered several different dishes and the food is always amazing, and the service is always on point. There are very fee restaurants that leave me wowed every time i go but this is one of them."
Ruben G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/26/2016,"I unfortunately have to give them only one star due to their policy of not taking reservations for large parties. To not take a reservation for a party of seventeen is BEYOND RIDICULOUS. We're here at the moment and all seventeen of us have been waiting for two hours and counting, and the hostess just told us that she has no idea when they'll have a table available for us. Making matters worse, the service at the bar while we've been waiting has been incredibly slow. The food may be very good, but it's not good enough for this..."
Larry B.,"Miami, FL",92,48,219,4.0,2/9/2013,"My great friends J.C., A.C., and I decided to come have a late lunch at this establishment after a series of text messages that involved a list of plausible locations to eat at.  I reluctantly agreed to come to the one at Dolphin Mall. Why reluctantly? Because I dislike the mall. It's always packed with children, tourists, and the worst thing.... the parking it's a mission! I was thinking ""Ok... we will be waiting for a good 40 minutes or more."" and... .Oh was I proven wrong! They told us the wait was going to be 15 minutes and it literally took us like 10 minutes to get seated. I ordered the soup of the day ""Cream of Chicken Soup."" It was EXQUISITE! But that was not all. I also ordered the ""White Chicken Chili"" which I've had one other time in the past along with a passion iced tea.  My friend J.C. ordered the Island Grilled Chicken. When she read the ingredients and saw that the chicken was glazed with soy she became skeptical. I told her to give it a try. That if it tasted bad to blame it on me (as if that would fix the problem if it truly tasted bad right?). Anyway, she was really pleased with her selection and the chicken was actually very flavorful, tender, and juicy. HEY J.C.! - JUICY MOUTHED! LOL Her husband A.C., ordered one of his favorite plates Chicken Alfredo (it suits him right) lol. He said it was great as well. Although it was literally showered with grated cheese because he did not tell the poor waiter to stop grating cheese until after what seemed to be like a whole two minutes. Poor waiter!  When it came time for dessert nobody really ordered any except me who ordered a Cappuccino.... in all honesty... I've HAD BETTER. If the cappuccino would have rocked my socks I would have given this review 5 starts. lol Maybe next time they'll be worthy of 5 stars. I am very stingy with my stars. I must be impressed!"
Alex G.,"Miami Gardens, FL",153,3,,5.0,7/13/2016,Went during a shift change earlier today and the service was ...alright. I'm not one to complain but It would have been horrible had it not been for an older man named Carlos who was bussing at the moment. He was the only one who didnt ignore my eye contact out of the rest of the staff that kept walking by while I was waiting for utensils. Shout out to Carlos the busser for holding it down when the rest of the staff (managers included) failed. He saved my dining experience.
C M.,"Miami, FL",2,188,383,4.0,8/13/2015,"Well I'm back at this location, son ask to go & I could not decline.        On 8-5-15 we go with son, granddaughter, Wife & I. We had lunch & started with Appetizer. Crab & Artichoke Dip, for the little one son order Kids Sliders. Later son order Lunch Orange Chicken & Wife had Skinny Veggie Burger with Skinny Caesar. I had Lunch Chicken Piccata.       Now for the service, food taste & quality was improve from last time that we have attend this Establishment.      The sad part was that we did not have dessert because we where running late for  an appointment. Next time it will be :-("
Maylin G.,"Miami, FL",15,28,37,3.0,2/17/2015,"I was craving for crab cakes and this place has good ones. The place is always crowded, food is ok.. we ordered the wacamole which was acceptable ( we have to remember this is not a mexican restaurant so) the crab cakes excellent as always. Also ordered the carbonara with chicken and it was good. Service wasnt good I ordered something and they never brought it but they included on the check I bet our server had a bunch of tables and that was why... he was nice but I felt unattended."
Cassie Y.,"Dumfries, VA",0,20,5,2.0,12/15/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory. I've been to this Location twice and both times service was absolutely horrible. The first time (I wish I remembered the waiters name), he asked if we were ok once. Brought out our appetizers with the meal, and never even acknowledged it. I was sitting outside during this experience, so the second time I sat inside and thought maybe it would be better. Nope. Our waiter, Paul, was completely absent minded. He checked on us, again, once and literally walked around and paced the restaurant instead tending to us. Had my drink filled once, had to ask another server for my check, even initially coming to take my order took fooooorever. The waiters here defiantly need some training. Hopefully it was just the two that weren't so great because I really like Cheesecake Factory."
Lino V.,"Miami, FL",26,116,30,5.0,2/22/2016,"Man what's not to love about this place! Portions are huge, the dishes are always delicious, and the service is good. Been coming to this location since it opened as it's close to my house and it's always great."
Sonia A.,"Miami, FL",1196,378,810,3.0,6/3/2014,"My dinner last night was not the best but I have had better dishes here before so I won't go less than 3 stars! I had the Marinated Skirt Salad.  The steak tasted ok but the salad was made with iceberg lettuce!?!?! Yuck!  And of course it wasn't listed on the menu that way.  It said leafy greens!  Last time I checked, iceberg lettuce is not even that green! In their defense, the waiter was really attentive and nice.  Their bread is always great and cheesecakes are amazing!"
Samantha M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,11,,1.0,6/10/2016,"This is the worst location I've ever been to.     Service in most of Dolphin Mall is usually bad.  But this was unusually bad.   The waiter took our order and we didn't see him again for another hour.   We finally got the food an hour too late, and the food was cold.  We were so hungry we still ate the food, but it was a horrible experience."
Neal R.,"Miami, FL",19,23,133,4.0,3/24/2015,"Funny that while I compared the restaurant I went to yesterday to Cheesecake Factory, I happened to come here the very next day! I've always loved eating at The Cheesecake Factory...well, almost always. You'll love eating here; that is, if you can bypass paying a few dollars more for dishes including those you can find at other restaurants. It was an early Monday evening, but my family, friend and I got a table in seconds. Expect most of the tables to be taken when you come in the evening. Huge parties of people would come here for birthdays. Our party sat at a four-person table while I took an extra chair. The restaurant interior is one of the most intricate and distinctive restaurant interiors I've ever seen - so classy and top-notch. I also like the Picasso-style art over the kitchen. The Cheesecake Factory has the widest variety of food I've ever seen in a menu: burgers and sandwiches, pasta, tacos, chicken, steak, seafood, salads, as well as reduced-calorie SkinnyLicious options. I like that most of their dishes are unique - maybe that explains why their menus are so big, and that people come here so often. It's unlikely that you'll find these dishes anywhere else. Dad had the Avocado Eggrolls. My brother had pasta. Mom and our friend Francesse had the Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad. I had the Baja Chicken Tacos with rice and black beans. All the food has been artfully and well-prepared, and it all tasted great. However, I don't understand why the portions are huge! We talked amongst ourselves, saying that while the portions are huge, they have gotten only slightly smaller from the last few times we've been at the Factory. For dessert, we, of course, shared a slice of cheesecake - the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cake Cheesecake. Again, unique and delicious. The waiters are studious in their jobs. They are to be commended for being focused at all times, accurately following instructions, and being courteous of the customers: as I was sitting in the extra chair, the waiter forgot to get me an extra fork, knife, napkin, etc. When I brought it up with him, he apologized. I needed cutlery and a napkin, so I vaguely asked another waiter to bring me a ""fork and knife"", but that's exactly what he brought me, so I also asked for a napkin. Our party didn't want refills, but the good thing is our waiter asked if we wanted any. The Cheesecake Factory is one of the best places to eat at in groups - maybe celebrate your next birthday here? That way, you all can share the dining experience together. To save money, I recommend only coming here once in a while. Expect to spend about $20 to $30 per person, which includes an entrée, drink, then consider an appetizer/dessert. It's well worth your money, though. It's one of the best restaurant franchises I will ever eat at."
Megg S.,"Miami, FL",22,50,124,5.0,3/7/2015,"There is a few places that I enjoy going to for a full and big portion meal! The Cheesecake Factory is a place to be at for a big appetite without going to the beach. This place for being a franchise is a must go to restaurant. It's a must go not only for there food but for there big slices of cheesecake!        First, let's talk about when you come in you get greeted by happy hostess/host always with a smile on their face! Second, the food I would recommend is endless here! Between the Louisiana chicken pasta and the chicken fettuchini with sun dried tomatoes is amazing and mouth watering. The appetizers the stuffed mushrooms is so good of the small plates part of the menu! Last but not least the cheese cake! The red velvet cheesecake with some nice hot coffee is so good and complement well with each other!   Come on in to this restaurant you won't regret it!"
Lacey C.,"Columbia, SC",335,556,173,3.0,11/27/2013,"I'm Elite, so I'll just say it: Sometimes selling out feels good. That's how I feel whenever I am convinced by friends to go to the Cheesecake Factory before a movie--our circle is diverse, and it's hard to please everyone.  But apparently everyone's pleased by The CF. Or ya know, mostly pleased. I'll admit--I have never had anything I disliked here.  I've even had stuff I loved here.  Service is always great--and for the Dolphin Mall especially they do a great job on ambiance..   Still.  It's just a CF at the end of the day. And the wine list sucks and is seriously overpriced to boot. I'll still go back.  Probably.  And not by choice."
William L.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",31,11,57,5.0,2/15/2016,I went for valentines with my wife for lunch and to be honest our server was a 6 out of 10 but wow the server William which wasn't even our server helps us like I have been help in a very long time he is the best at this location hands down. He normally works near the bar. If it wasn't for him this would of been a 3 star review
Tami V.,"Miami, FL",0,12,12,4.0,7/26/2015,"Love the fun drinks and the atmosphere! I got mozzarella sticks, and i must say, they are the best mozzarella sticks I've ever had. Also got the spaghetti and meatballs, which were soo yummy and really nice garnish on top. The only reason i didn't rate this place 5 stars, is because the service was slow."
Hector G.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,3.0,11/23/2016,"Second time consecutive that has problem with the service, they fix it in a good way but I don't go out to relax fixing problems."
Markus D.,"Vienna, Austria",70,370,365,1.0,3/17/2015,"Disappointing. I was always a fan of Cheesecake Factory but the steak I got served here was ridiculously bad. First of all, it was way overcooked. And then they served it in a kind of broth - very far from a sauce - that made the whole thing watery and took out even more of the flavor. This is how you don't cook a steak. Complete fail, I won't come back."
Sonia C.,"Miami, FL",14,92,257,3.0,5/18/2015,"I specially come here just to indulge on their cheesecake.  Love this restaurant is kid friendly with a nice kid menu. The food is always good, nice atmosphere & fast & friendly service."
