Rolando G.,"Miami, FL",304,209,373,5.0,12/27/2017,"Four Cheese Penne Pasta with Chicken was delicious. Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken was excellent but had too much sauce. Despite this place being utterly full, Olivia was an outstanding waitress - taking care of getting our food on time and always greeting us with a smile. 5 Stars for sure!"
Brandon L.,"Miami, FL",63,162,148,3.0,1/8/2018,"I have a love/ hate thing with this restaurant.  I think things have drastically changed with this chain over the years and has gotten to big to keep consistency. One of the main problems is they make way to many items to keep up with quality and consistency. The menu is like a mini novel. You can literally spend 20-30 mins looking through it and wonder what page to reference of the other thing you thought about getting. That being said, it's nice when you go with a group that wants a wide range of types of foods. As for the food, there are thing I really enjoy. I can't say I've ever had anything bad, just lack of overall consistency. My favorite, which is not on the menu anymore is the Portobello on a bun. They will actually make it most of the time if you ask.  It's kind of a sin to go here and not have Cheesecake... I have noticed the size of the slices have gotten smaller (back to my consistency argument). One a good note the taste has remained the same.  The staff is always friendly, but they seam to be running around a lot. Long waits unless you sit by the bar. That area is first come first serve."
Alyssa G.,"Miami, FL",238,149,15,2.0,9/2/2017,"Wow where to begin... So to start off let me just say that I was here literally a week ago... I went to lunch today with my family and we decided to come here. We were seated right away which was surprising for a Saturday on a long weekend.  Our waiter Jonathan came to introduce himself and take our drink orders with bread in hand ( which was great). Once we ordered or drinks it took him a good 10 minutes to come back with them. Mind you, we ordered waters and coca cola's, nothing fancy that had to be made at the bar.  When he finally came to drop off the drinks we ordered our food. I ordered the same thing I got one week ago- the Louisiana Chicken Pasta but instead of the sauce the pasta comes with and the veggies I wanted a white sauce (I cannot tell you how many times, in the history of my existence I have ordered this- but since cheesecake used to be my all time favorite restaurant let's just say A LOT). I'm not sure if Jonathan was new but he seemed quite confused with my order. We asked him to bring more bread as well.  20 more minutes passed and our drinks were empty and watered down and had just then received the extra bread we had asked for. After 20 more minutes of waiting (still with empty drinks) he finally returned to the table to ask if it was okay with me that the pasta had Cajun butter on it (which is normal to the Louisiana Chicken Pasta dish), which makes the dish spicy, after I had clearly stated I ONLY wanted white sauce. No veggies, not the sauce that it usually comes with, white sauce... Obviously this was not okay with me. He returned to nowhere land or wherever it was that he kept hiding out for about another 20 minutes. We were all starving at this point and had been here for an hour already...He finally started bringing out the dishes 2 at a time. Of course everyone else got there food before I did. And when my dish finally came it wasn't even Jonathan that brought it out! He had someone else bring my dish for me (even though he had brought everyone else's out and we were 5...)  Anyways, the food was good. He got my order correct. He finally brought new drinks after we got our food. My grandma complained that her pasta was not cooked enough-it was pretty hard.  At the end we ordered the smores cheesecake for the table which was delicious!"
Alyce K.,"Coral Gables, FL",54,84,222,3.0,8/8/2017,"I really like the Cheesecake Factory, but this location is always SO BUSY! This time, I happened to come on national cheesecake day, when cheesecakes are half off, and the wait was ridiculous. I was told that it would be 40 min, and that I would have to wait within 10ft of the restaurant for the buzzer to work. The women's bathroom stalls were completely out of toilet paper and really messy. However, I still waited, and other than that it was good. I ordered the chicken bellagio (my go-to) and a slice of cheesecake. The portions are huge and I had enough leftovers for two additional lunches. Â I also got to try the celebration cheesecake, which was fun. It has chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry mouse and some birthday cake. Doesn't top the red velvet, but still yummy!"
Jose P.,"Miami, FL",23,85,118,5.0,9/2/2017,"WOW! I love this place! Every time I come here with friends or family. We are never disappointed. The food here is to die for and let's not even talk about the cheesecake (you'll die again!). I usually come for lunch and have the monstrous chicken cali club sandwich. But this time I wanted to try something a little bit different. I ordered the coconut chicken and shrimp on a bed of rice with pineapple and other veggies. This was very tasty, it was featured on the ""specials menu"". My son had the kids spaghetti and meatball, and my girlfriend had the hibachi steak. Later for dessert we ordered the birthday cake cheesecake and the chris cheesecake!! Wow.  Can't wait to come back here again!  Would like to give a special thank you to our waitress for being so attentive and helpful in our decision making."
Seana M.,"Miami, FL",78,52,499,5.0,8/23/2017,"Been coming here since I was little and still one of my Go-To favorites. I mean I think this menu has about everything and can satisfy even the pickiest person you know. With such a large menu you can never get bored with the food. Even though for years Ive been stuck ordering the Miso Salmon because its just so good. Some days im feeling a little more sponaneous and order something new.  Either way, for sure a five star for me. Yes its a popular restaurant so depending on the day sometimes it will be crazy packed and you have to wait. A little tip, if youre with a small party and you see a table open in the bar area then that seating is first come first serve. So you can seat yourself and dine from there. THE BREAD IS FIIIIIRE. I always end up just asking for double ""brown bread"" because that one is my favorite. Just be careful not to kill it all and stuff yourself too much before your meal. Their plates tend to run a little on the bigger side.  I know its called cheese cake factory.... but I love their strawberry shortcake for dessert! mmm I'm hungry."
Amanda P.,"Miami, FL",149,72,34,5.0,7/14/2017,"If you're looking for options, this is the place to go. Menu is endless and has options for any dietary needs.   A group of my co-workers and I went out to lunch but not all of us eat the same. We had a couple of vegetarians and a few others that were looking for a ""low calorie"" meal so we all agreed on TCF.   Went in around 11:45 AM to avoid the lunch rush hour. Thankfully the restaurant wasn't packed so a table for 9 was available within 2 minutes.   Our server, Michael T, quickly came to our table and gracefully offered water, took our drinks order, and brought some of that delicious bread. A few minutes later we ordered some appetizers: avocado rolls, fried mac and cheese, and edamame. The three of them were fabulous. (My favorite were the avocado rolls... yummmm!!)   After debating for 30 minutes on what to eat (no kidding!), I FINALLY decided to try the bang bang shrimp and chicken with brown rice. Presentation was a plus and portion was big enough to feed 2 people. However, I was a little disappointed when I came to find out that the ""bang bang"" sauce was not the one I had in mind. This one had a curry/peanut butter taste to it as opposed to the mayo/chili one from Bonefish and PF Changs. Although it was not what I was expecting, dish was still flavorsome and I took the left overs home.   To finish our ""food coma"" meal, we decided to order TWO cheesecakes: red velvet and s'mores. All I can say is that life was a lot better after that."
Carol M.,"Miami, FL",514,294,3142,3.0,4/21/2017,"My husband loves this place so sometimes we come here for dinner. I find that the restaurant has a lot of items and would be a great option for large groups because everybody can find something that they like in the menu. The place offers salads, appetizers, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, large plates, brunch, and any type of cheesecake concoction you can think of. I usually order the Americanah burger which has lettuce, tomato, bacon, crispy potato fries, and pink sauce. The burger comes with fries or with a salad. It's usually very good and I love it. It's huge so every time I eat it I feel very full. Sometimes we order the Vietnamese summer rolls which is a very Americanized version of this traditional dish but enjoyable enough.  Overall, the place is a good option for a large group, prices are reasonable and the menu is very varied."
Gerry L.,"Miami, FL",26,98,284,4.0,6/26/2017,"For me Cheesecake Factory is one of my to go places for good comfort food during any type of occasion. Even though Cheesecake factory has expanded to other locations the quality of the food its not what it used to be, but regardless we are still loyal fans. We decided to have an early dinner last Monday, and went to the location in Dadeland Mall, and we were lucky to be seated right away. Depending on the day there can be long wait times, so plan accordingly.  Once you are seated they bring you complementary wheat and sourdough baguettes, which are amazing especially when they are bring it out nice and warm. I also take my time looking at the menu which looks like a mini bible, but don't get overwhelmed just pick different plates to share. This time we decided to order an old time favorite pot stickers and something new the avocado toast, and then the main entree we choose the Ahi Tuna with brown rice.  The Pot Stickers are pork dumpling steamed and then fried to give the brown crispy bottom, and then they soak it with a delicious soy vinegar. The avocado toast is a baguette toasted and then cut in half with a amazing spread of mashed avocado with red onions, olive oil, Â tomatoes, and basil leaves. It was a delicious appetizer and healthier then other options. Then the main entree arrived and it did not disappoint, the tuna was rare as I requested and very fresh, they used a miso based sauce that went excellent with the brown rice. Come and try it and you will understand why it one of my favorite."
Barker M.,"Ramsey, NJ",0,16,,1.0,12/31/2017,The slob who gives tables is so rude and full of herself it's not worth worth it and is such a time waster  Avoid at all cost 0 stars deserved as they will lie and waste your time
Lazara R.,"Homestead, FL",9,32,64,5.0,11/17/2017,"My food was delicious and my husband also enjoyed his dish. The portions are huge, so it's a plus to always have leftovers for later. We also love the bread and the service was great."
Blanche K.,"Miami, FL",70,116,230,3.0,8/5/2017,"Always a filling meal when craving Cheesecake Factory.  Food 3/5 The menu is overwhelming at time because it's so extensive! Fave dish is the white chicken chili- comfort food yet light on calories, doesn't make you feel blehhh afterwards! The portions at cheesecake are huge!! Once had the chicken parm pizza and leftovers were enough for like another 3 servings! The food itself is never too memorable though, nothin really unique to their dishes.  Tried the new coffee n cream cheesecake, quite yummy!  Service 4/5  The wait is always unbelievable whether it be weeknights or weekends! They definitely try to be efficient, it's just the shear number of people there that causes this. Our server was friendly and advised us to put in our cheesecake orders before our food because it was taking 1hr to prep cheesecakes- good call!  Ambiance 3/5  It's really loud all the time and hard to hear conversations at your own table. The kithchen staff are also a bit rowdy (at least they are enjoying their time!)"
Danny W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,5.0,12/26/2017,"Excellent Food Excellent Customer service Busy, but wait time was 10 mins....can't really complain. Portions sizes are huge, and the cheesecake is to die for."
Dania D.,"Miami, FL",3,34,104,5.0,11/17/2017,Always packed but amazing place. Last time I went it took a little long to get the order but everything was delicious. wait time is usually not that long. its a big place. love it here!
Robert W.,"Miami, FL",31,45,44,5.0,10/24/2017,My daughter's birthday party was awesome at the Cheesecake Factory. We had a party of 11 and only waited 15 minutes to sit. The service was fast and the food was delicious. The server was nice and communicated with everyone in my party. Wish I could remember his name. He had a big beard and short hair. He was awesome
Ashley C.,"Hollywood, FL",55,69,78,4.0,7/15/2017,"Went to lunch here on a Saturday. The wait was not long, less then 5 minutes. Once we were seated the waiter, Frank, came over and introduced himself. Frank was amazing, he was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped me find a tasty vegetarian option. The table next to us was rude to him, but by the end of the visit they quickly turned their negative attitude around as they noticed he did not change his mood. The food did take pretty long to come out. Frank did continue to check on us, but when our food did come the appetizer came out with the food. Overall good experience here, Frank was amazing but the wait for food was too long."
Jim D.,"Norwood, MA",0,115,2,5.0,1/4/2018,"Never a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory. Â Prices are cheap at this location coming from the NorthEast. Â Filet Mignon, mashed potatoes, and green beans for a meal and tuna tartar for an app. Â All that for $39 plus tip. Â Everything was cooked perfectly and the service is fantastic. Â It's always busy though."
Jonathan C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,19,33,2.0,12/11/2017,"Hi, the waiter didn't ask why our plates were barely halfway finished. I asked for two drinks to save time. I actually had to ask a passing waiter to get a refill. It didn't even seem that busy considering multiple tables were open around us during lunch. I have been here before, albeit a couple years ago, and wanted to give it another shot as last time the food (normal) didn't justify the cost/experience. It'll be my wife's choice if we go back. You should really consider including a first responder, officer, firefighter, and military discount."
April W.,"Miami, FL",64,150,350,2.0,4/16/2017,"At one time Cheesecake Factory was a great spot. Sadly, it has really gone down hill. I came for lunch to celebrate my birthday and overall it was just a disappointing experience. To start, the silverware was FILTHY. Disgustingly so. There were hard pieces of food stuck to almost every fork on the table and the knives had film on them. We brought it to our server's attention and the manager Linda promptly came to our table to apologize. She offered a complimentary entree or dessert, which was nice. However, the lunch experience continued to go downhill. The wait for our meals was entirely too long and the food was mediocre. My husband had the chicken teriyaki, which was dry, bland, and barely had any sauce on the chicken. For almost $17 it should be better... My chicken quesadilla was just ok. The cheesecake is always good, but don't think I haven't noticed the slices getting smaller and smaller- yet the price remains the same. Tsk, tsk. At the end of the meal, we had to remind the waiter of the comp the manager had promised.  I have not been impressed at all my past few visits to Cheesecake Factory (Dadeland location and Grove location) and I think at this point, I will not be returning further."
Natalie V.,"Miami, FL",128,22,24,4.0,5/13/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory because of it is always consistent in delivering the same flavor every time. Although they have many amazing dishes, my absolute favorite is the Pasta Davincci. I order it every time!  The place is always busy, by service seems to be pretty good most of the time. They always try to accommodate and if they notice themselves falling short, they make up for it. We the Sunday brunch has a become a regular for us. The fried chicken eggs Benedict is amazing and our 2 year old loooooves the kids pancakes with bacon! Our go to location is normally the one at Dadeland."
Maria D.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,13,6,3.0,12/2/2017,"I've been to The Cheesecake Factory many times but this was my first time at this location. My friend and I went for lunch. We were seated the the patio area. There seemed to be a shortage of servers, as our server was barely attentive. We ordered a salad to spilt and an appetizer. We asked for lemon for our water, bread for the table and plates so share our salad. The app and the salad come out pretty quick but we had to wait to eat since we didn't have plates. We had to ask the server a few times to give us plates. The bread and lemon wedges came way after the food. I love the food there but the service was not impressive."
Omari B.,"Santa Monica, CA",6,16,14,5.0,9/16/2017,"I love it that anywhere you go you can always find a Cheesecake Factory and find your favorite meal. I knew the food was going to be quality, so when you get good service it just makes the experience that much better! Shannon was awesome! Witty, smart, and knew the menu inside and out to where she was able to decode what we wanted to find it on the menu for us. Of course I will be back, and of course I'll ask for Shannon!"
Ivy L.,"Miami, FL",204,28,45,5.0,9/15/2017,"I prefer this location over the one in Dolphin only because it's always extremely over crowded @ Dolphin Mall. I can come here 100 times and always have something different. This time I ordered the new Thai coconut chicken. Very flavorful. However, I think cheesecakes BEST dishes are definitely their pasta. Avocado egg rolls for appetizer are always a must have! Lastly, for dessert they now have pumpkin pecan cheesecake for fall and it is incredible. I wish I could have a slice every day during the fall season! Tons of yum!"
Rebecca R.,"Miami, FL",229,44,237,4.0,8/14/2017,"While not my first option, Cheesecake Factory doesn't disappoint. With an extensive menu, there are options for all dietary needs (a bit overwhelming at times). Although there is usually a long wait, this is an ideal setting for family dining. The pumpernickel bread always tastes like it's fresh out of the oven! My favorite meals are the Chicken Madeira and Pasta da Vinci. (If you order the lunch portions you won't feel as guilty, hah!) And while I'm not a fan of cheesecakes (gasp), the ones I have tasted are yummy. Overall, I would recommend Cheesecake Factory whether for a date night or your next family celebration!"
Jhonatan L.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,2.0,10/29/2017,The service was good but the dishes and wait time was really bad. THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF CLEANING ! Tables were dirty and spoons and forks and knifes where just really dirty man. It's not that hard to clean them correctly.
Daniel D.,"Miami, FL",4,11,56,3.0,8/7/2017,"To start off right, I came here because of a gift card to burn. When asked for a table, they sat us outside of the restaurant but inside of the mall (literally outside of the doors of the restaurant in a gated area less than 20 feet from a kiosk with crowds walking by). I asked to be moved and they accommodated me.  I ordered the steak that came with two sides, breaded green beans and mashed potatoes and requested that the mashed potatoes be subbed with roasted broccoli. The person with me got their food before me and the server brought out the steak 10 minutes later with the ""breaded side"". We're talking 5 pieces of 1"" long green beans and a big empty space to the side. I waited another 10 minutes for the broccoli that looked like it was boiled and thrown in the oven with extra heat to make it roast quicker and was dry and tasteless on top and soggy and soft on the bottom. I asked the server to try another side and went with asparagus.  During this time, a manager came out and asked if we wanted them to take the steak back to keep warm while they prepared the asparagus. By this time, my friend had started his meal. When I asked about the side of green beans, he said that's exactly the portion they give and apologized for the empty space on the plate because since I ""asked for a substitution,"" they had to plate it separately. He was right. But why on Earth would you bring a half completed meal to the table? He acknowledged that was their mistake and offered me dessert to which I declined (damn you KetoDiet!). Eventually the asparagus came out and I had started eating the steak and had finished my gerbil sized portion of green beans (by this point people around had arrived after us and left already). I commend the manager for trying to make it right but not for low key blaming the wait on my request for a substitution."
Javier S.,"Miami Beach, FL",1,6,5,2.0,11/12/2017,"fried macaroni n cheese is ok the chicken littles is huge enough for two people, but i always feel like the place is dirty with the sluppery floors and nasty silverware right on the table"
Jordan S.,"Miami, FL",9,101,176,4.0,2/15/2017,"Went here with my family on a Sunday night. Only waited ten mins to sit. I ordered the Farfalle pasta with chicken and roasted garlic. Not too salty, fulfilling and very yummy. Huge portions!"
Suzan M.,"Miami, FL",68,38,96,2.0,1/10/2017,I always really liked this location but service this Sunday was abysmal. When ordering to-go I was placed on hold indefinitely and completely forgotten about. That should have tipped me off but I called back and placed my order for curbside pickup. When I arrived I was again placed on an indefinite hold. I went inside to pick up my order which was sitting on the side and getting cold. When they handed it to me they told me I could not pay because they didn't have my ticket (even though it was a very simple order to charge)-understandable.  But while waiting I looked at my order of shrimp scampi with herb crusted salmon and mashed potatoes. It was smooshed together in a big lump of mash. Horribly packed and definitely thrown around. The salmon was overcooked yet the whole dish had gotten cold. Total waste of money. Should have been free. Very disappointing.
Thien H.,"Riverbank, CA",648,639,2941,2.0,6/17/2016,"Dadeland Mall's Cheesecake Factory is weak. It is especially weak when I compare it to Aventura's Cheesecake Factory. I had a pretty good experience at Aventura recently. Their happy hour foods were surprisingly good overall and it inspired me to try Dadeland's.  While the Chicken Sliders $5.50 were big and appetizing at Aventura, at Dadeland they were a joke. As you'll see from one of my photos, one chicken patty was hastily ripped in half to make two sliders. One of the chicken pieces was so small, it was basically a single bite. The Portabella, Avocado, and Zucchini fries $6.95 are extremely greasy. I couldn't continue eating them. The Guacamole $5.50 on our first visit to Dadeland was okay. The Mojito $5.50 was fine. The S'mores cheesecake $7.95 was the best dish. ______ On our second visit to Dadeland's Cheesecake Factory, the Guacamole $5.50 was very unappetizing looking. It had a very obvious brown/oxidized color to it. I thought that it was only brown on the top layer, but it was brown throughout. I dug deeper in several spots in the dish and it was all oxidized. I'm guessing they had a vat of old guacamole and made sure to send it to anyone who ordered off the happy hour menu. To top it off, I bit into the little nub of the avocado. That was unpleasant. This time we ordered it mild and it still had a bizarre spicy taste. It didn't taste like any type of chili I've tried before. It wasn't black pepper either. It tasted like it had been seasoned with pepper spray (the self -defense kind) or something. Very strange. The grossest thing we ate were the Beer Battered French Fries $6.95. Avoid this dish. It was nothing like we expected. I expected beer battered fries like those that are served with fried fish at a British pub. Instead, it was like they slow cooked the hefty potato sticks in barely warm oil first. Then they battered them with a thick and strange breading and fried it at too low of a temperature. The outside of the ""fries"" was technically crispy, but they were somehow not tasty. I usually love fried food, but the thoroughly oil-soaked fry was a huge disappointment.  I had tried the Ahi Tuna Tartare at Aventura and was looking forward to it here. The miniscule amount of tartare $7.95 was insulting. All of the tartare could fit inside one of those little plastic cups they use for ketchup. I still can't believe I just didn't send the dish back upon seeing it.  The Happy Hour Burger $5.50 was pretty basic. The only redeeming part of this particular meal was the Oreo Dream Cheesecake $7.95. At least the kitchen doesn't touch this dish. The cheesecake counter people just put a little bit of whipped cream next to it. I didn't think chain restaurants could vary so much. Dadeland Mall's location is skimpy on portions and the food is not properly cooked and/or their recipes are bad. If you really want Cheesecake Factory food, then I would suggest the Aventura or Dolphin Mall locations."
Jennifer P.,"Homestead, FL",1,23,12,3.0,7/15/2017,"We went on a Friday night at about 9pm, we were a group of 5 with 1 child. We waiting about 15 or so minutes which we thought was amazing to begin with. The menu really is packed so I recommend maybe browsing the menu online before you come to decide what you more or less might want (most have pictures online). When we sat down, our server, Anthony, was amazingly attentive and such a joy to have visiting our table. He was very helpful when he realized half the table had never been here before and offered suggestions and ideas. We knew about portions but he reiterated again because we went crazy with appetizers and entrees. He was not kidding.  The food was both a hit and miss. Some of the food was good like the BangBang Shrimp, Guacamole Salad, and the Mac&Cheese burger and our appetizers (spinach dip, nachos, and deliciously amazing fried calamari). But some were misses like the tostada salad which had both the chicken breast and the tostada that were burnt and some stuff was missing a touch of seasoning. The drinks we good (need more ojito variety though).  The cheesecake of course was amazing. No complaint whatsoever on the dessert menu. So overall if we could divide the rating it'd be 5 for the server and ambience but 3ish for the overall good."
Daniela V.,"Miami, FL",0,13,20,3.0,7/31/2017,So yesterday was national cheesecake day and I made a point to visit Cheesecake Factory since they had 50% off every cheesecake. Sounds great right? I self sat in the bar lounge area with no wait. The lobby was beyond backed so luckily the bar tables were available. I ordered the celebration cheesecake since I kept seeing it all over social media. Gotta say it was the first time I did not like a cheesecake from this place. It tasted like boxed cake and very artificial. I basically left it and nibbled at my sisters salted caramel cheesecake which was phenomenal.
Chris L.,"Miami, FL",0,7,,1.0,11/18/2017,Arrived at 11:30 on a beautiful Saturday in Miami. Â Asked to sit outside and was there was only one server and it was a 15 minutes wait. Â Literally 15 empty tables outside. Â I asked if they could seat us or get an additional server for outside and was told they all come in later. Â I left and will never eat another Cheesecake Factory in my life. Â Such a simple thing ruined the vibe on a nice Saturday.
Cynthia C.,"Miami, FL",11,45,27,5.0,10/1/2016,"By far one of the best places to have a creamy delicious pasta bowl.  They have a pretty long menu which at times makes it hard to decide what I wish to eat, but whichever dish you choose you will NOT be disappointed. The service is usually fast (weekends do expect long wait times and many people) but nonetheless, everything here taste great. To start they serve fresh warm bread (I love the dark one) and also monday- Friday they have great happy hour deals.  As for dessert..... you just need to get here NOW and see for yourself. The cheesecakes are delicious. Every possible creation handcrafted ready for a delicious taste."
Beatriz L.,"Miami, FL",2809,280,1987,4.0,2/20/2016,Was shopping at Dadeland Mall and decided to go have dinner at the Cheesecake Factory because it's always been one of my favorites.  I wanted to order something light because I'm trying to lose some lbs. I was surprised that they now have a skinny menu that also tells you how much calories each meal has.  My order was simple a small ceasar salad and from the skinny menu a tuna tartar that was delicious in a reasonable portion. My son ordered the chicken teriyaki with white rice (his favorite) and he felt that the chicken was a little dry and was not made with love. My partner ordered the almond salmon salad that has Kale but he was not so thrilled with his meal. We love coming here but we stepped out of our comfort zone from what we usually order. The wait for this restaurant is forever long. Please try to reserve. Prices are also reasonable.
Alia A.,"Miami, FL",159,109,210,4.0,10/31/2016,"If there's no wait I don't mind either here (that's why the 4 stars), the food here is always consistent- always good! With a lunch portion salad you will be more than good or the yummy Thai lettuce wraps, those two items are my go to! Service is very good here and I've found that when they tell you 15 minutes, it's 15 minutes not 30 like most mall restaurants tell you!  You can never go wrong with any of their cheesecakes but I always love to ask the waiter there favorite and decide from there!  There's also great coffee here"
Luis ClÃ¡udio M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",98,5,1,1.0,9/26/2017,several empty tables and make us wait for 30 minutes for a table. Bureaucracy unnecessary Good food and terrible service!
Scott S.,"Miami, FL",0,8,8,2.0,6/25/2017,"This review is for take out ordering ONLY!! Not for dining in which has always been a pleasant experience for me Since I live close by I call in to order all the time but I don't know if it's their employees or their system of taking in orders that makes this place horrendous!!! I am not bashing their food because it is always great but below are two examples of MANY that I have experienced when ordering out from here. Once again... if I didn't live so close and if their food wasn't so good I would never order from here! I called once and was put on hold for over 15 minutes... Â I ended up hanging up, and called back and explained to the person who answered the phone what occurred only to be put on hold again. This was ridiculous so I got in my car and drove there (still on hold) there only to show the manager how long I've STILL been on hold and requested to show a manager how I was still on hold and my call history of how I had been on hold 15 minutes even prior to the call I was on. Â The place wasn't even busy that day.  Another time I ordered (again I had been on hold forever) and I went to pick up my meal. Â When I arrived, I watched 2 employees stare at the phone ring and each look at each other and tell one another to answer it... they refused. A manager was walking around the pick up/order area and heard the phone ringing and asked one of the two aforementioned employees, ""do you hear the phone? Are you going to answer it?"" They employee responded that he didn't hear the phone and proceeded to roll his eyes and answer it! This pissed me off because I am the guy that's always on hold FOREVER because of situations like that so I pulled the manager aside and told him everything I observed. Â Don't know what happened after I left but he was appreciative that I brought it to his attention! Cheesecake Dadeland really needs to do something about this!"
