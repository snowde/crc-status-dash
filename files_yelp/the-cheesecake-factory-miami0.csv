Supawat J.,"Miami, FL",1,67,421,4.0,1/11/2015,"My favorite one is always Thai lettuce wrap.  There are more choices on healthy menu as well. It was raining that day, we sat at the patio so they closed the automatic windows. Service is always good."

Jimmy N.,"Miami Beach, FL",42,40,87,4.0,7/1/2014,"This is a great cheese cake location. For a Saturday night the wait was only 2 minutes. I was totally expecting more. We literally walked in gave our names turn to see cheese cakes and bam we were being seated. Our server was attentive, straight to point and gave us space. Points to him. I believe his name was Curtis, nice guy. He didn't linger and was there when we needed him. The food came out fast and was totally delish, the drinks were great but a little light. I will definitely come back. Everything was grade A, I especially loved when only one of appetizers came out and the manager came to apologize and give explanation. I haven't even though about the other appetizer. We were sharing everything anyways that I just wanted to eat period it didn't matter to me when anything was coming out as long as something did :) but it was such a nice surprise."
Allison D.,"Miami, FL",291,193,256,2.0,4/27/2015,"I use to love coming here!! But after much deliberation and several visits this year, i have come to the conclusion that I'm gonna give the cheesecake a big break!! Lately every time I've been there the experience is the same...dirty floors, nasty restrooms, dirty or stained plates, glassware, utensils and napkins, sometimes the service is good sometimes its terrible, and most important the food has gone down the drain, what use to be delicious and gourmet, now sucks!!! greasy and poor quality ingredients, prepared cafeteria style, yuck... the only good thing they still have is the cheesecakes...that from now on if i crave them, i will order it to go, because they ain't gonna see my pretty face there in a long while!"
Alexander B.,"Miami, FL",425,46,47,4.0,7/8/2014,"Exceptional service by Alejandro! Our server was very well versed on the menu and he explained all the specials. He works like a server should: quick, knowledgable, and kind. Food took a bit long, but he made sure we were good with constant refills and bread. We ordered the orange chicken, pretzel chicken, fried veggie fries (eggplant, avocado, and zucchini), and a sausage and ricotta flatbread. The flatbread could have been a bit crispier, but overall a great meal. We'll be back, hopefully with the same server!!!"
Jessica A.,"Miami, FL",354,325,364,4.0,8/31/2012,"Yum! I love coming here when I'm with a few friends and none of us can decide what we're craving. So many options and everything is delicious! I've never had an issue with the service here. Everyone is attentive and clear.  It can be crowded on weekends, so if you're with three people or less try aiming for the high tops or the bar."
Yadira N.,"Miami, FL",0,4,1,2.0,1/19/2016,This cheesecake factory in Dadeland Mall was not clean at all.  Bathrooms were disgusting!  Floors slippery and food was cold when it got to the table.  I understand they were busy that is unacceptable.  No bueno!
Grace P.,"Miami, FL",0,33,,5.0,6/17/2016,"I love the fact that the Cheesecake Factory is consistently good.  We usually go to the Dadeland location and find the quality of their food always very good. They also do their very best to accommodate your seating requests.  Their menu is huge and now they added the small plates that also tells you the calories they have, their portions are usually big enough to share,its the place one can always count on to meet our expectations"
Ghostcritic ..,"Miami, FL",0,21,7,2.0,7/12/2016,"Aside from great cheesecake that already comes made frozen, service is only seems to be good when it's slow. Catch these guys while there Busy and you will encounter a slew of issues. Undercooked and overcooked meat and pasta, garnishes missing and at times little sauce or brown rice mixed with white rice, even fingerprints on the plate. I'd love to give them more credit but it proves to only be superb service when not that busy and that...is inconsistent."
Javier I.,"Miami, FL",0,26,,4.0,7/11/2016,Plates are massive and the cheesecake is amazing as expected. Can get pricey. This place has everything one can ask for but the drawback is there is not one amazing plate. Service is good and the atmosphere is great and classy. The popcorn shrimp is good and the salads as well. Another chain restaurant and without the cheesecake it would probably be getting 3 stars as it is just another chain restaurant.
Odeiciv1 ..,"Miami, FL",0,6,1,1.0,12/30/2015,"Have been waiting for 45 minutes for bread and when it came, they said they only have given us to pieces  of white bread they didn't even have the brown.   1 hour and 25 minutes my wife got here food and I don't have mine,  then my wife's was raw after she said she wanted it well done and they took it back. They serve me mine so I ate my meal without my wife it hurts after I was done, I had to wait for her to finish and then they showed up with the bill with nothing discounted after in 2 hours and 20 minutes my wife complained I stood up and left they tried to pass off with two pieces of cheesecake , I find that insulting and ridiculous. Over priced to get ignore. Not both spending your time. Do not bother waste of time and you will come out with your butt asleep from waiting so long!!!!"
Abigail P.,"Homestead, FL",57,63,24,4.0,9/7/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory definitely has a menu that can practically satisfy anyone's cravings. The portions are rather large, of good quality, and almost never disappoint in taste. As far as customer service, each server I've had tries their hardest for a positive experience. I appreciate their attentiveness and knowledge of the menu. That's rather very important to me when I am deciding what to have that meal since I'm very indecisive. The price is reasonable for the quality, presentation, and overall taste."
Frank S.,"Miami, FL",18,27,31,5.0,9/30/2015,The service was great. Even though the restaurant seemed extremely busy and full we were sat down in 5 minutes. We were a party of 7 so not bad at all on the wait time. The food was also served timely and the temperature was perfect. We will definitely visit again
Dennis T.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,,1.0,6/29/2016,"Food was great but I was charged almost seventy dollars on top of what I already paid. I called management who spoke down at me and insulted my intelligence. I was told it was my bank's fault. After admitting that I was charged by mistake, they failed to extend any form of courtesy.  I now  have to wait five business days to get my funds returned to me. Will not being go back to Dadeland! Promise you that!"
Jorge M.,"Miami, FL",693,498,5495,4.0,1/29/2012,What can i say. This is one of the rare  chain restaurants that i like! Its located in Dadeland mall. Parking is everywhere if you are one of the Lucky's ones who find it. Just come before 12 if you can for lunch and theirs plenty of parking.The restaurant is large plenty of seating and bar area is a nice size. When I Go I normally sit at the bar and catch up on sports on their TVs. People dont like to eat their food at the bar but i do.Great service and food comes out quicker I have noticed. The restaurant and bathrooms are kept clean.The staff and bartenders are great. My favs to get are the stuffed mushrooms on their small plate menu and their Crusted Chicken Romano with Spaghetti. Sooo Good. Then comes dessert. Its the hardest thing to chose on their menu in my opinion. I go for their Dulce de Leche Cheesecake. Mmmmmmmmmmmm just getting hungry writing this review. Lol Enjoy People!
Virginia M.,"Miami, FL",427,350,404,4.0,12/6/2012,"I've been coming to this Cheesecake Factory since it has opened and though it has changed their menu a bit, they still deliver great food and service. The reason why I only gave it 4-stars is because our server was a little pushy on getting our order in but with so many options, it's hard to just choose something!!  On the other hand, there is always a wait to come here...it doesn't fail. So I understand if he was trying to get us out in order to accommodate those that are wait but still... The calamari was delicious and plentiful! We had the Jambalaya Pasta and though spicy for the common man, it was so good and addicting as someone that likes spicy food! No cheesecake this time around but my boyfriend and I plan on going back just for that!"
Sarah F.,"Miami, FL",1,10,6,1.0,1/31/2014,"Let me start by saying that I've never really been a fan of this place: gargantuan off-putting serving sizes, mostly subpar food (except for the Cheesecake, of course) and bizarre Egyptian Art Deco-y unidentifiable themed decor. But, the last time I went there really took the cake (or should I say, ""cheesecake"" buh dum tiss) for terrible experiences.  I ordered the Evely's Favorite Pasta, which tasted kind of sour and wasn't very good but I was starving, so didn't complain.  Two of my friends had the Fettucini Alfredo... big mistake. We leave, and go along our merry way to hang out at a lounge. About an hour into our fun girl's night out, my friend runs to the bathroom and gets sick. Mind you, we didn't drink and we hadn't eaten for hours before going to cheesecake.  About two hours after that, we decide to head back to my place and head our separate ways. My other friend who had the Alfredo, says she feels fine, says good bye and gets into her car. As soon as she turns on the car, she swings open the car door and yacks violently all over my driveway. Coincidence? I think not!  The next day, we call to complain. Well, that didn't work out initially. The manager who I spoke with was extremely dismissive. He had the audacity to tell me, ""Well, we make all of our sauces for each plate from scratch, it's not like they're sitting there in one batch."" Really? Really guy? You're going to tell me that you people make sauces from SCRATCH for each individual order you get on a very busy Friday night and yet manage to take only 10 minutes to get it to your customer? You must think I had a botched lobotomy, or something. Even if you did in fact, make each sauce individually, it doesn't negate from the fact that the ingredients may not have been fresh. I highly doubt it was pure coincidence that both of my friends got sick from the same exact dish when they hadn't eaten anything but that in several hours.  Luckily, we called later that day and the second manager was extremely professional and apologetic. He gave us the information to report the incident to corporate.  Moral of the story: Stay away the Fettucini Alfredo!"
Gaby S.,"Miami, FL",756,328,153,5.0,4/21/2012,"I really thought this location was losing its great service and good food. I had not come in a long time and went last night for dinner. The beauty of an early dinner at 6:30 pm? only a 5 min wait! This place can get really packed on weekend nights, the wait ranging between 45 minutes to 1 hour. Come early for lunch or an early dinner so you dont have to wait so long.. anyways, the service was great and the food was excellent, warm and fresh! Didnt get to have any cheesecake though :( i got way too full from the bread! Best appetizers: -fire cracker salmon rolls - crabcakes -Entrees: Always big enough to split! Chicken Madeira: the best! Pasta: Crusted chicken romano is also great and the louisiana chicken pasta."
Iliana R.,"Miami, FL",281,117,282,4.0,3/7/2014,I love coming to cheesecake because it's consistently good and there's something for everyone. No matter how many times I go there I can always have a different dish and never get bored. They also have a full bar which is great especially for Sunday brunch (mimosas).  This is one of those places that you just don't get tired of going to. Prices are reasonable $15- $20 per plate.
Luz P.,"Miami, FL",43,6,,1.0,5/4/2015,"Went today to eat brunch with bestie, ordered avocado and chorizo omelette. When the omelette came it did not have any chorizo, or avocado it was a plane omelette with veggies, not even cheese :/ called the waiter over, showed him the inside of the omelette and he says ""there's the avocado"" -_- clearly doesn't know what avocado is. He sends the manager, manager looks at the omelette as well and doesn't even apologize's for the error or says anything. Just a blank look on his face. Says so you want chorizo as well. Waiter brings the avocado first. Got little chopped up pieces of chorizo after we finished our meal. Again never excused themselves just gave a look like we were being bitches. Sorry if I'm paying $12.50 for an omelette it should be what I ordered. I'm a chef, I know what avocado and chorizo look and taste like. Smh. I've come here plenty of times, first time this happens."
