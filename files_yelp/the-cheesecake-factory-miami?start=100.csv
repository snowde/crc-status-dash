MickeyBlue I.,"Hollywood, FL",225,672,3129,4.0,8/4/2015,"I started off hating this Cheesecake Factory  based on the horrible parking and the insane amount of people there. It's like nobody works! Surprisingly our wait time was only 10 minutes for a booth and we were greeted promptly by an EXCELLENT server named Colleen.      The restaurant itself is VERY noisy and crowded, undisciplined kids running all over the place and selfish parents that think it's cute. However we noticed that it does die down after 3PM (mental note) Colleen our server was very friendly and wore a genuine smile throughout our lunch.      Their was a slight hiccup with our order, but the manager was kind enough to inform us on the mistake and made every effort to accommodate us while we waited. Even with the slight delay in our food I have to say I really enjoyed it here, mostly due to our great server and the funny Manager who made our experience a pleasant one.      The Cheesecake Factory has always been a consistent place to eat with reasonable prices and generous portions. My Chicken Carbonara was excellent! And their Chicken Picatta is wonderful! Make sure you take advantage of the lunch portions served until 5PM, unless you have a big appetite then go for the dinner portion.      As usual I cannot leave without dessert so being the wild, crazy and spontaneous guy that I am I ordered the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake! Yum!"
Sandy R.,"Homestead, FL",0,4,,1.0,3/28/2017,"I was recently told that this particular restaurant has gone down the hill. It's been one of my favorites in this area. Definitely not coming back. The service was awful, my husband's meal, an omelette, was cold and I had already eaten my small meals when his arrived. Nothing on my beets salad was fresh and the portion was super small.  Waitresses did not even apologize for the delay in the food. What a shame..."
Aries C.,"Miami, FL",2,16,,4.0,8/4/2017,"Service here is much improved recently. My hubby and I started going here again in the last few months after a couple years off. We have been able to get seated within 15 minutes or so even on a busy Saturday night, and servers come take care of us in a reasonable amount of time. That was definitely not the case several years ago so whatever you're doing to keep things operating smoothly, keep it up! Food is still good, I love their great guacamole and Thai lettuce wraps:)"
Andrea S.,"Miami, FL",2,9,1,3.0,1/21/2017,"Food is okay, service is okay. But that whole grain bread is what drags me here every time."
William M.,"Miami, FL",38,74,,2.0,5/30/2016,"Sunday evening, restaurant not that full yet waited over 45 minutes for my food and sides after sitting down.  Either hire more employees or cooks or a present manager to interact with customers and make sure their satisfied."
Ashley M.,"Miami, FL",149,5,7,5.0,7/5/2015,"Went for Fourth of July with my Cousin and his gf for a few slices of cheesecakes. Lol why not? We ordered  the Chris's outrageous, snickers and white chocolate macadamia nut. Chris outrageous was amazing as always white chocolate macadamia is a favorite of mine and the snickers didn't disappoint either. Then again  a lover of all things sugary. Will I be back? Of course this place always satisfies when a sugar craving hits."
Wendy L.,"Chicago, IL",107,229,368,4.0,8/8/2015,"Always a safe bet for a fun atmosphere, decent food and drinks, and amazing cheesecakes. We came to pick up a whole cheesecake. They have most of the options available and our cheesecake was ready within 10 minutes of placing the order. They also gave us complementary whipped cream to go. We got the Godiva chocolate cheesecake and it was a hit with everyone! Super rich, dark chocolatey, and the perfect balance of sweet and bitter-- will satisfy any chocolate craving."
Lee Z.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",22,323,688,4.0,12/8/2015,We had a large group (about 16-19 persons) and the wait staff did a fantastic job.  The dishes we ordered was good. The only downside was the wait to get seated.  It was a Friday night and extremely crowded
Giovanna H.,"Miami, FL",174,233,343,2.0,3/28/2016,"The more I go to cheesecake the more disappointed I get. I've had an issue with the one in Dolphin Mall since it opened up and now I've noticed the Dadeland Mall having the same issues. Dirty and stinky restrooms, distrust cups, utensils, and plates. And problems with the food the majority of the time. And not only a problem with what is ordered but the quality of the food has gone way down.  My family and I headed over yesterday for Easter Sunday. 8 of us and half had a problem with our orders. It was absolutely not the waiters fault he was more than wonderful with us even after all our issues. It was absolutely not the waiters fault he was more than great with us after all. My sister and I also noticed that the white bread has changed.  We have been regulars at cheesecake since we were little girls back in the 90s so we notice the change tremendously. I did notice the managers walking around a lot... apparently a lot of customers had complaints yesterday.  I'm so disappointed with Cheesecake Factory mostly because this is the place I've gone too for so long and it's picked first automatically by my family and friends. It's a no brainier and now we have to second guess it. I've always believed chain restaurants have all the same problem. The more you grow the less quality and service you give. 20 years ago Cheesecake Factory locations were not everywhere and sure enough not more than 1 maybe 2 locations in each city as I remembered. Chain restaurants have been out my options for a good 6 years now. As an adult I've learned to not waste my money on them and when I find a dead end and must step foot in one it hurts. There are a handful amount of chain restaurants I am okay with and Cheesecake Factory was definitely one.  ."
Isaac C.,"Unionville, Farmington, CT",0,7,,3.0,8/6/2017,"They were about to seat us at a messy booth but noticed it and moved us to another booth that was too messy. After a few mins we ended up going to the first booth we were originally going to be seated in. We waited a while for food, and they got one order wrong. Food tastes the same as other restaurants. Waiter didn't come very often making us wait more than usual. Overall nice atmosphere."
Juan C.,"Miami, FL",0,11,,1.0,8/26/2016,"Normally a good bet but not this time.  We were seated right away but it took over 10 minutes before somebody came to take our order.  He explained he was not our server. Our appetizer came 10 minutes later.  Drinks cane 10 minutes after that.  Entrees came 30 minutes after we sat with no refills of water or explanation as to the subpar service. The food was ok, not like at other times.  I overheard the location was under new management or ownership.  I did not confirm that.  Hopefully next time it will be better."
Marina S.,"Miami, FL",6,47,43,3.0,7/4/2015,"As you walk into the restaurant, it Greets you with a wide variety of cheesecakes on display. The menu has a wide variety of different foods from hamburgers to pasta. What we got as an appetizer was the avocado egg rolls. They were delicious! Our waiter on the other hand was very dry and rude. He didn't seem to like this job. The portions of food are huge. The hamburgers are great, the pasta da Vinci's really good, and the cheesecake is even better!!  We got the Oreo cheesecake and the White chocolate raspberry cheesecake (I believe that's what it was called) The cheesecakes really light and wonderful! When you order ask for extra whip cream!The whip cream there is great, it's so smooth, and great to put on your cheesecake! the Oreo cheese cake tasted more like chocolate , I was hoping for a more Oreo   looked as if they had taken the Oreo cheesecake and dipped in chocolate and then sprinkled Oreo crumbs over it. The chocolate overpowered The Oreo cheesecake.  The other cheesecake that we got, the white chocolate raspberry,was excellent. I don't like raspberries but this cheesecake change my opinion about it! Ha ha ha! The reason I'm giving this place three stars is because our waiter was rude and it's kind of expensive. I mean, $54 for a whole cheesecake, I can buy one at Publix for $30. If your going to come here it's mostly going to be for the desserts."
Iloveanimals N.,"FL, FL",0,10,,4.0,7/18/2017,"Always love the Cheesecake Factory - this time, one person in our party got a cold plate though - it was send back and redone, but also taken off the bill at the end, which was nice of them to do (and a surprise to us, as we hadn't asked for this)  since he had to eat his meal after all of us were done. The manager also came by after the cold food was sent back, which was a little overkill and embarrassing,  since we weren't freaking out about it, but we appreciated the gesture."
Giovanni I.,"Miami, FL",0,7,,5.0,2/14/2017,"I loved this place. I really, really did. I went there for lunch in honor of my graduation from high school. And it was worth the price that we paid for the whole meal. The wait time was only about 10 minutes long, and my family and I got seated right away. My family's appetizers included the brown bread with oats, an order of fried mozzarella triangles, and some buffalo chicken. For my entree, I enjoyed the chicken Parmesan sandwich with no marinara sauce, a side order of sweet potato fries, and a small side order of broccoli. To drink, I simply had ice cold water. For dessert, I enjoyed a nice big slide of the ""Oreo Extreme"" cheesecake. The cheesecake was cold, cheesy, and even chunky with real Oreo cookie chunks inside, as well as an Oreo cookie crust at the bottom. I loved this fine dinning lunch experience. The service was fast and efficient. Our sever was very nice to us. It wasn't that crowded at lunchtime and it was the best lunch I've ever had in honor of a big accomplishment of my life...high school graduation. I hope to come back again soon. I would highly recommend this place to ANYONE who wants to enjoy lunch or dinner in style."
Anthony D.,"Coral Gables, FL",36,23,1,5.0,3/2/2017,"This is a go to restaurant of mine. The food is great, the service is great, the prices are great, the menu is enormous so I can either go with one of my favorite dishes or I could change it up a little. Large restaurant with great seating. The waiters/waitresses always make you feel welcome and there is something for everyone to enjoy. From Asian to Italian, there is nothing not not on the menu! My favorite dish here are the Thai lettuce wraps. It's a little taco bar at your fingertips. Juicy warm chicken and lettuce and phenomena sauces to choose from. A, sweet, thick peanut sauce, a spicy, sweet Asian sauce, and a zesty cilantro sauce. I also really enjoy the tuna tartare and the orange chicken. At the end of the day, this retardant never fails to satisfy! I would highly recommend!"
Ericka G.,"Miami, FL",546,355,3120,4.0,3/3/2016,"You can never go wrong coming to Cheesecake factory.  Their menu is huge and there's so much variety even a vegetarian would have trouble trying to pick something out. The complimentary sweet brown bread (I want to say it's pumpernickel but I'm honestly not sure, not really a bread person) is just so warm and delish with butter that begins to melt as soon as you spread it. Omg that bread is so damn good but watch it, you can get sucked in and ruin a bit of your appetite because you can't seem to stop eating it ( it's happened to me plenty of times). I came here on a Saturday night with my parents so be prepared, the place was packed. We chose to skip the wait and found a tall table top in the bar area. I wish I remembered our waitresses name because she was dynamite!!! But she was quick, helpful, and just a sweetheart all together. I asked her a million questions about different menu items because of course anxiety kicked in and I wanted everything. She helped me make the best decision and we were all satisfied with our meals and  our bottle of red. I must say out of our three meals my stepfather had the best miso salmon I've ever tasted, I must come back and order it, it was really good. If you plan on coming here over the weekend try and come early or be prepared for a wait but trust me, the wait is worth it!"
Diane M.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/21/2017,Worst take out service/experience ever. I came 20 minutes after i placed a pick up order and waited OVER AN HOUR. The restaurant was completely empty with a FULL staff and i find it hard to believe that it took them 1 hour and 40 minutes to make one entree of pasta. The staff wasn't even remotely apologetic. Won't be ordering takeout from here ever again.
Marcella R.,"Miami, FL",17,37,1,1.0,7/18/2017,"Wow, I was so disappointed. I had the Chicken Pot Pie and found strands of Plastic or some sort of String. That stopped me eating instantly. The air conditioning was not working on one side of restaurant. It was Happy Hour and you can only partake if you sit at the bar. How ridiculous. I won't be going back. The thought makes me gag."
cristina b.,"Miami, FL",160,138,451,4.0,9/1/2016,"I remember how much I enjoyed  this restaurant when it opened up over 20 years ago. I hadn't eaten here in quite a while but have to say that I'm thoroughly satisfied when it came to food and service.  The offerings on the menu are varied enough to suit even the pickiest of eaters. Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the kids version of pasta Alfredo. I remember the sauce being much thicker than what they served my little one. The selection of cheesecakes is just as extensive as their menu and definitely didn't disappoint. Yes, we waited a while but not any longer than expected for a popular restaurant on a Saturday evening. We went back on a Tuesday evening just for some cheesecake slices to go and the place was far less busy. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and tasting some other menu items that caught my eye. Only four stars though because the floor was a bit dirty and the decor made the place feel a bit more cramped than it already was. They need to do something about trimming some of those palm trees!"
Allie P.,"Lake Worth, FL",27,12,,1.0,1/12/2017,"Not a friendly environment at all and the staff has no hussle. Waited for a table for 1 for 10 minutes, meanwhile 3/4 of the restaurant was completely empty. Unfortunatley, there aren't many choices in this mall, so if you can head to Nordstrom cafe."
