Kenny Z.,"Miami, FL",28,68,48,1.0,4/29/2017,"I am a highly upset frequenting customer to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been blown away with the awful hosting/customer service you have working here. The unorganized manager named Dora is classless and disrespectful. She has had my party of 26 people waiting for about 4 hours at this point, when she originally quoted 2. She got a very distasteful attitude because I have requested a status on our table repeatedly. I was not even offered a buzzer. I have never in the multiple years I have brought my family to dinner have ever experienced service this horrible. None of the hostesses wanted to tell me a timeframe they just told me to speak to the manager. The manager just repeatedly said there was nothing they can do. They tried to split our party because they did not properly start making room for a table for us. Then I spoke to her manager named Greg who acted very surprised but ALSO DID NOTHING. Then went to go hide in the back so he wouldn't have to give me a status. I have never experienced such horrible service. McDonald's would be a better dining choice."

Ryan L.,"Miami, FL",130,62,23,2.0,2/6/2016,"Say it isn't so...1 hr ticket time, completely forgotten orders, incorrect items, lack of appreciation on server's/management's part as it concerns the complete downward spiral of an experience, manager had nothing more to say than ""I'm sorry"" when I expressed our disappointing experience (and he struggled with that), consistent and continuous disorganization throughout the entire experience, and it just continued to the bitter end. This is particularly sad considering I am a huge fan, and the one to speak highly of a chain that is generally consistent a B+, which is more than many in the restaurant business can say. That said, I'm hoping that this was just their ""bad day,"" and not the beginning of an unfortunate trend. We shall see.

Natalie S.,"Miami, FL",90,69,16,4.0,5/6/2017,"I love coming here to celebrate special occasions. Recently we came after my college graduation and the food was delicious as always! The service not so much... the waiter wouldn't let us finish our sentences before he dashed off... which is very aggravating. I gave it four stars because this isn't the first time I've had bad service here. The food is wonderful tho I love the fresh bread and for an appetizer my favorites are the avocado egg rolls & tamales. As main dishes I like the chicken madeira, chicken piccatta and orange chicken. As for desert you can't go wrong with ANY cheesecake but my favorites are the tiramisu, Godiva chocolate, and Oreo cheesecake! Yum! I do have to also mention yes, I've gone a few times where the silverware wasn't cleaned properly but usually I just mention it to the server and get a fresh new set. On Sundays the wait time is always horrendous so I try to come to this Resturant during the week. I would recommend it just have patience because you might not get the best service it's always by chance!"
Ana R.,"Doral, FL",0,7,36,5.0,6/16/2016,"I come every month because its a lot of food and I can share and try different things. BEST black bread of life, I need order double ! My favorite plate is the meatloaf, yum! Always take cheesecake to go! Its a must!"
Kar L.,"Vlaardingen, The Netherlands",0,6,5,4.0,5/18/2016,The best veggie burger I ever had. The strawberry cheesecake was delicious as well. It has a very family kinda atmosphere so that's great. The prices are kinda high though....
Shannon S.,"Miami, FL",0,13,,2.0,8/7/2016,Sssslllllllllooooooooooowwwww take out. Every time. Asked ahead of time for extra dressing and of course it didn't come with. Another 15 minute wait. 1 hour 10 minutes total.
Frank P.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,2.0,5/15/2017,Right after rush lunch time. This place was empty and it took forever to get our food.  I've given this place various opportunities.  These restaurants have gone down in quality and service.
Niecy B.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,6/9/2017,"This use to be one of my most favorite restaurants,however the food taste horrible. I would never recommend this restaurant to any one. The shrimp scampi I order was very dry. The Mex Egg Rolls was good but the sauce was watered down and horrible."
Datzy L.,"Homestead, FL",26,4,15,5.0,12/3/2016,I love there desserts and one of my fav is there mac and cheese stuffed balls everytime I go I order them!!!
Meylin P.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,5.0,6/1/2017,"Chris is amazing! He went above and beyond. He paid attention to the smallest of details, making my dinner experience exceptional."
Dorothea P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",269,104,331,4.0,3/10/2015,"I went close to closing time and I felt bad because of waiter seemed rushed but halfway through our meal they relieved him and our new waiter was awesome! We were craving something sweet late night and we wanted to try something new so we looked through the menu and the lemon merengue looked awesome.  I loved it but the person I was with thought it was too sweet, I guess she was expecting something more tart flavor but nevertheless it was still good. We also ordered a smoothing the tropical one with passion fruit even though the waiter said the best one on the menu was the mango one it was still delicious!"
Juan G.,"Miami, FL",48,11,35,1.0,2/8/2016,"Worst place I've  ever visited,  Service was great I'm not going to throw the waitress under the bus because she did her best. It was my daughters birthday and she decided to come to this place; Beverages came on time but we had to wait 50 minutes for the food, my Pasta was dry and crusty of been sitting under the heating lamp and the fries stale !!!!  No more business with this guy."
MICHELLE C.,"Plantation, FL",2316,2081,4444,2.0,10/12/2013,"My daughter and I were shopping and she wanted to come here. I was in the mood for a nice salad so I was ok with it. I have always enjoyed how large their menu is especially when you have no idea what your in the mood for. This menu helps satisfy any craving.  From the moment we sat our server took our drink order ASAP. He was rushing us for some reason. I was not digging his energy or attitude at all.  After finding a salad that seemed like a great choice I ordered the Carlton Salad. The menu stated balsamic dressing. I asked the server for extra dressing.  We ordered stuffed mushrooms to start and they were delightful.  The server had brought over a small cup of the dressing.  Immediately I was like oh that color, texture does not look good. I dipped my fork in it and ugh it was awful. Creamy texture with a robust taste of peanuts and sweet.  I'm like WTH. Minutes has passed when I called our server over to the table. I first asked if possible he gave me the wrong dressing. He said no that's the balsamic. I asked if he could make sure the dressing was not poured on my salad and I would choose another. He rudely said well I'm sure your salad is done so nothing I can do. Mind you this is after I told him how awful it was.  Ok long story short my salad came out with the awful dressing on it. I asked for another dressing to pour on top to try and mask the flavor. The salad was fresh, it would have been perfect if not for the peanut dressing,  When a manager came over she said yes that's the right dressing. I explained to her either they should specify peanut dressing on the menu or explain what it taste like to guest if they order it. Luckily I don't have a peanut allergy otherwise I would be dead.  This just really put a bad taste in my mouth how they handled it. She did say if I disliked it she would replace it with another salad. Well my daughters food was out and I did not want to wait for another salad.  For me this was a case of really bad word choices on the menu. Obviously this chain does not care about Customer Service.  Blah, pass on this place!"
Paul W.,"Miami, FL",876,1200,548,2.0,12/2/2015,"While I hadn't been to any of the Cheesecake Factory locations in at least 4 years prior to coming here, I'd normally had good experiences at their restaurants.  On this day, the service was sorely lacking, however. I came here with a friend on a recent Sunday at around 12:30 for brunch.  We were seated at a table for 2 in front of the place (in other words, in the cordoned off area that juts out into one of the main interior corridors here at Dadeland Mall), and we were then basically neglected for the remainder of our time here.  We placed our orders and we noticed that nearby tables who'd ordered after us received their food several minutes before we did.  The glass of water I ordered with my beverage never came until I asked for it again when our food was finally delivered.  Once we were done with our meals, we sat there for quite a few minutes with no one checking on us before I finally asked one of the other servers for the check. After the check was delivered and we placed our cards inside the pouch, again, it was quite some time before she finally returned to take our payment.   We noted that most of the tables around us had one particular waiter, and our waitress was kind of the ""odd man out"" in our section, so I'm unsure if we got there before the other guy started his shift, or if she had several tables to tend to inside and was only taking care of us when she remembered to come out front to check on us, or what the situation was. Aside from the poor service, our meals were fine - the potatoes I'd ordered were quite good and my omelet was so large I could barely finish it (this isn't surprising, considering The Cheesecake Factory is known for their gigantic portions).  If the service would've been better, they'd have probably received another star.  Total for his breakfast sandwich, my omelet, a glass of milk and a glass of OJ came to $31.43 before gratuity."
Andrea D.,"Miami, FL",0,13,2,1.0,11/13/2016,"Was on hold for 20 minutes to give an order to pick up. First person I spoke with could not write down what I ordered. Put me on hold and never came back. I called back again and finally got someone who took my order. Hopefully it will b correct.   We arrived at the pick up parking spot in Dadeland. And no one answered the phone at Cheesecake Factory. We called back 3 times and finally someone answered and couldn't tell us if our food was ready and coming out. It was very busy at Dadeland so we canceled the order and left, never getting our food."
Zoe L.,"Miami, FL",49,5,3,1.0,8/15/2016,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!  I was here yesterday for a goodbye dinner for one of my friends. I get there at 5 pm, request a table for 8. I know I realize that's a big party, so I tell the hostess that we don't mind waiting for our table, so she says wait about 30-45 min. If anything make sure to check back in in 30 min. So we wait 30 min and go back. I check in to see where we're at in the waiting and the hostess said that they gave our table away?!? So I'm already a bit upset at this point so I tell the hostess that that's unfair since they hadn't even buzzed me to go back!? She apologizes and says 20 min more max we'd have to wait. So she then gives me a new buzzer because the first one didn't even buzz!!  So we sit in the restaurant this time and wait about 10 min. We get seated by a waiter called Sebastian, says a few things for organization since we're a big party. Just as I thought things couldn't get worse, throughout the course of the rest of the night the waiter takes 20-40 min in between to give us our bread, drinks, take our orders, give us our food, collect our plates, take our orders for dessert, collect our plates, give us our bills.. He didn't even come back to the table to apologize for the wait, or check to see if we were doing okay, if the food was okay?? My plate of food wasn't even filled up all the way!! If I'm paying for $20 worth of food, I'd expect it to at least be filled up nicely not just spread out to make it seem like it's served right. WE WERE THERE FOR ALMOST 4 HOURS!!!! We got there at 5 and left at almost 9!!! The most terrible customer service I've experienced at a ""so-called nice restaurant""."
Brian C.,"Key Biscayne, FL",0,38,1,3.0,7/28/2016,Good food in general especially shepherds pie. But SERVICE EXTREMELY SLOW. Even bringing the check and returning was slow. They need to improve.
Keith S.,"Westfield, IN",69,380,117,3.0,1/22/2015,"I hate to give a bad review. But this trip deserves it.  I found the one item on the menu that is not a gut buster, their grilled salmon. The best part of the meal was the steamed carrots. Salmon was so over cooked it changed color.  Tasted ok but I know why they serve it with tartar sauce.  ""Salad"" was about 20 pieces of fancy lettuce with a splash of dressing and it was served at same time as the hot food. Is this a Miami thing? Start to finish was almost an hour. Took so long I didn't think cheesecake was worth another hour."
