Osmy J.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,5/8/2017,"Saturday night at the cheesecake Factory, well it took more then 1 hour for us to get r food (4 of us). the other 4 tables around us got there food before we did and they got their after... we spoke to the manager Steven and nothing was done... all he said was I will look into.. :/   and I think at this point, I will not be returning in the further."
Aurélie V.,"Washington, DC",10,21,12,4.0,12/9/2014,Really good cheescakes but a little bit too big for me.  And some of the waiters aren't very nice !
Chris W.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",6,3,14,3.0,12/26/2014,This restaurant offers a wide variety of food options. This place is crowded almost every time we go and they do not take reservations.  The greatest entree I ever had here was the wasabi crusted ahi tuna. I was disappointed that they no longer have this on their menu. They have great drinks and lots of cheesecakes to choose from so It can also be a great stop for just drinks and dessert.
Emily J.,"Miami, FL",10,4,,2.0,4/30/2017,"One of the worst. It was so loud that we had to shout. Then after waiting 45 mins for our food, the manager said that  they were backed up at the egg station. Food came 6 to 8 minutes after that statement. They offered desert even though we had ordered off light menu. So unware of what was happening in there restaurant."
Josette S.,"Miami, FL",421,238,1390,2.0,1/3/2015,The wait was awful! They sat a group before us with The same number of people who came after us. The server was ok. The food though is always good we just had to wait a while for the food also. I do recommend the hibachi steak.
Nick A.,"Miami, FL",1,5,,3.0,10/28/2016,I love cheesecake factory but they never get my order right when I place an order to pick up. The Food is great but double check your older before you leave the establishment!!!!! It's very annoying to get home all excited then to find out it's not what you ordered.... I still ate it because I was starving but I wasn't satisfied :/
Stefany E.,"Hollywood, FL",48,20,25,5.0,9/16/2016,Amazing food and service! Carla who handles the curb side take out is amazing! Always gets the order right
Lissy N.,"Miami, FL",68,102,1,1.0,2/22/2017,This place used to be good but it's gone down the drain. Don't even attempt to place an order for pickup! The phone will ring and ring and ring
Angie L.,"Miami, FL",11,79,233,5.0,1/24/2016,"I dined here, last night on a busy Saturday night, and surprisingly the wait was only 20 minutes. After 20 minutes I was immediately seated and greeted by my waiter Jason. Jason was very kind, pleasant, and very attentive! My daughter wanted shrimp as an entrée so I got her the dynamite shrimp, I never knew that Cheesecake Factory had a kids menu until last night (which has a variety of items to choose from) except for shrimp, which was ok. I had The Tex Mex eggrolls, which came with the salsa and sauce, it was so fresh and crispy that it tasted as if Jason had deep fried the eggrolls right in front of me! I also had the chicken Madeira, steak Dianne and mash potatoes, it was good as expected no complaints other than I wished it came with more four pieces of steak. As you can see I didn't have room for dessert, but the cheesecakes are a ""must have"". This restaurant never disappoints, the food is always fresh, the staff is always nice, and not too mention it's not expensive and they have a very large variety of food menu items to choose from."
Jose M.,"Miami, FL",12,102,16,1.0,12/21/2015,"This restaurant has been on my goto list for many years because of quality food served consistently, but all good things must come to an end. Slowly food quality and presentation have declined. Visited yesterday and crowds are still there, but not as bad as expected. They still have the fastest table turn over rate and was seated promptly. The food was mediocre to average. Ordered the onion rings which I've never had and will never again. They  came in a horrible batter badly fried and greasy. They didn't come with any dipping sauce to redeem them. Ordered my favorite Chicken Madeira which never disappoints, but today it was awful. Came with a red sauce which I have never seen. Like it was suppose to be something else and they ""fixed"" it.   The Shrimp Scampi Bistro was Average, although the shrimp quality is not there anymore.  Skipped dessert which still looks good.  During the long wait for my meal which would usually automatically trigger a manager visit, I noticed a little fruit fly hanging out. I thought it was odd, but that just might be a reflection of the restaurants cleanliness.  This place went from ""oh boy going to Cheesecake"" to another chain restaurant that is losing its way."
Yuniesquy H.,"Miami, FL",6,9,8,5.0,10/14/2016,"Food is always good here, huge menu but it's all good, and they have red velvet cheesecake....."
Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",903,1367,1441,3.0,9/12/2014,"Do you want a 100 page menu and big portions? Then this place is for you. I was out with friends and we started out with a few appetizers. I think the thai chicken lettuce wraps were delicious and would recommend. The spring roll was very bland and just a wrapped salad.  I ordered the salmon which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The portion size wasn't that big compared to the rest of the menu which was great for me.  I wish they would have asked me how I like my salmon since it was very dry. Others at the table ordered steak, veggie burger, regular Kobe burger, etc. None of the meals stuck out besides the portion size.  Our table couldn't decide on dessert so we ordered a few different ones to share amongst the group. We had the Kailua and coffee  cheesecake, ice cream sundae, and chocolate cake. The cake was very rich and a bite or two is all you need. The cheesecake was the perfect combo and  lighter.  This place is very crowd and doesn't take reservations. With that please keep that in mind because the service will be slow"
Autumn A.,"Miami, FL",0,10,,2.0,4/5/2017,"The service is great, the bread is to die for,and the food taste good as well. Just know after you have that great experience you will probably end up with food poisoning."
Pricila G.,"Miami, FL",12,46,62,4.0,8/18/2015,"As a true Miamian, I understand parking anywhere is a bit hectic . I went on a Monday night and although it was packed I was able to find parking at the front of the mall where cheesecake factory is located.  When you walk in you are greeted automatically by the host . The atmosphere is vivacious but also romantic since they tend to dim the lights at night .  My server seemed very busy from the start and rushed . I understand it's a fast paced industry but you must always give undivided attention . Aside from that , his service was great ! For an appetizer , I had amazing crab wontons and they bring a good portion definitely enough for two people. As my main entrée I ordered the veggie burger ... it was DELICIOUS . Alcoholic drinks are made strong or maybe it was because I had cognac on the rocks... :)  This place is a must try !"
Lisa S.,"Miami, FL",0,6,1,1.0,2/3/2017,"Tonight I am actually giving this place one star. The service was slow to start and then to wait over an hour for our food to come and some of the dishes were ice cold. We asked our waiter to get the manager and before he walked away , he said they had several people call in sick and the kitchen is really backed up. The manager came over and did not apologize about the wait. He said it is taking 25 minutes to get food  out of the kitchen. Our response was well that's fine but we ordered our food over an hour ago. Again no apology, nothing. This was real sad., so that's the reason for one star."
Gerald Z.,"Miami, FL",140,1,4,5.0,8/21/2016,I had dinner here a few times. 2 out of those times we were served by Anthony Lafontaine. This waiter is what has made our experience here significant. He goes beyond and above to make us feel special. He made great recommendations. The water never reaches the bottom of the cup nor does the lemonade. My wife is very particular in how she wants a certain dish (angel hair pasta w/ shrimp) and anthony makes her feel like its no issue at all.
Julie M.,"Miami, FL",8,160,19,2.0,7/24/2015,"It's not that I enjoy bad service, but sometimes I like to give certain places the benefit of the doubt, especially when there is potential. This Cheesecake Factory has potential, but the service here is absolutely awful. I can't even count how many times this place has let me down.  This past Sunday, I went with a group of friends. The hostess and one of the servers seemed to be feuding in front of us. What we received in terms of a welcome was far from warm. Speaking of warm, our food wasn't - everything was cold.... And speaking of cold... Our server's personality was cold, and about as stale as the potatoes that came with my breakfast. We didn't catch a single smile from him, nor did her even make an attempt to seem engaging. At a certain point (about 5 minutes in) we started feeling like he was annoyed with having to serve us.  If you're looking for mediocre food, crappy service, and an uncomfortable experience, this is your place. I'm done giving them second (and 10th) chances."
Abisai H.,"Miami, FL",671,166,692,3.0,7/19/2014,"This location is a hit or miss. You can either have the best experience or the worst.  The waiters are very knowledgable and they can all speak greatly about the menu and will recommend you very good plates depending on your cravings.  One of the best things at cheesecake is the complimentary bread they bring you, but at this location, most of the time it comes stale or old. This is definitely someone they need to work and improve on.  I will say tho, they have one of the best caipirinha in town. Be sure to ask for extra lemon because it will heighten the taste and you won't feel the strong liquor as much.  It is after all cheesecake and the verity is excellent! Be sure to leave some room for any of the flavors, but I can never get anything else than the Oreo cheesecake! It is one of their best."
Donna D.,"Melbourne, Australia",206,302,395,3.0,10/16/2014,"I honestly think Cheesecake is an appetizer and dessert kind of place. To me, the appetizers sound much more tastier than the main meals, and I've never been disappointed by them. Try the avocado rolls or the lettuce wraps. Plus, order a few and it will fill you up leaving room for dessert! And who can come to Cheesecake without getting cheesecake?!  There are so many to choose from, and they are all delicious! Just forget the main dish, it nothing to brag about. Although I must say that their mashed potatoes are good. This past time I went, I was not impressed by the meal, Chicken Madeira. I know it's one of their most popular selling dishes, but it just didn't do it for me. Just keep in mind that their portion sizes are HUGE! You can easily share a meal, or keep half for tomorrows lunch.  As far as service is concerned, this place is always busy, and you will always wait for a table. I don't mind eating indoors or on their outdoor patio, and that sometimes speeds up the wait time. On the downside, the last time I was here, the server and other staff were unprofessional about their coworkers and their responsibilities. Maybe they were comfortable serving our table, and therefore let their work-guard down, but it left a sour taste in my experience here."
Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97,3.0,7/23/2015,Yeah... I had to be pursuaded to go back. Not a huge fan of this place. They are all the same and just can't seem to get it right. The food was bland and needed seasoning. Our server would disappear. Just not a happy visit.
