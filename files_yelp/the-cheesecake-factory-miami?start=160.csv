Lauren M.,"Miami, FL",127,30,165,5.0,7/3/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is a go to restaurant for me. They are open late, which is great when my boyfriend and I are looking for places to eat after we see a late movie. My favorite dish is the harvest chicken salad."
Tara M.,"Miami, FL",0,1,1,4.0,8/23/2016,"I absolutely loved my lettuce wraps, as usual, although the vegetables in my friends Shephard pie was undercooked. Our server Jesus was awesome, and the ambiance in always warm and inviting here. I highly recommend the steak Diane or the shrimp scampi."
Mirtha G.,"Miami, FL",6,17,7,5.0,7/15/2015,"Dinner date with my daughter and we have the best waitress I've ever had here, Jessica !! She has made this feel like a 5 star gourmet restaurant.."
Gea B.,"New York, NY",1,27,,1.0,11/6/2016,"The worst management of any Cheesecake factory I have ever seen. We were originally told there was a 10 minute wait, after twenty minutes and seeing that there were at least 10 empty tables, I asked what was going on, we were told that they could not sit us because there were no staff to sit people. When they finally call us and take us to our table after a total 30 minutes, we arrive at the table and are told that we cannot be seated because they have not finished setting the table and we have to go back to the front, when there were 3 fully set tables ready. Needless to say, we left the restaurant and do not plan to go back anytime soon."
Danielle M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",98,1,,5.0,8/18/2016,Have been going there for years; always have a great experience.  This time we ordered pick up and I just wanted to recognize KeKe from pastry/take out and her manager Jessica. KeKe really went above and beyond her customer service duties! She's the best!
John K.,"Melbourne, Australia",0,27,,2.0,11/7/2015,"Here's a blow by blow account: Arrived at opening time and were told a 5 min wait even though there were only 2 couples ahead of us.  Finally seated. Had to ask for water twice. Took order after 20mins. Waiter came back 10mins later and said they can only do poached eggs on a Sunday.    Coffee has been empty for 20mins. Took 15mins to clear empty side plates.  Food finally came 15mins later. Wasn't bad but my wife's toast was burnt and there were onions in the potatoes which isn't on the menu. That's a problem for me as I have a physical intolerance to them. This is our second time at a Cheesecake Factory this week and both experiences have been the same. Very poor, impersonal service and you have to ask for EVERYTHING throughout the meal. There is absolutely no proactive service like you would get elsewhere. We won't be back at any of their restaurants."
Cara J.,"Miami, FL",0,9,2,1.0,5/8/2016,"I ordered their Shrimp scampi. The very small portion of shrimp for the price was ridiculous and had ABSOLUTELY no flavor. No amount of salt could have saved it. It was almost as if the dish had been made without any butter whatsoever. I wasn't sure that was even possible for Shrimp Scampi, but somehow Cheesecake made it possible. The service was adequate with attentive servers and hosts but the quality of the food has significantly decreased over the last few years. This used to be my favorite place to eat in Dadeland Mall, after the unacceptable service my party received the Sawgrass location, but the franchise has become a non-option for dining in South Florida all together."
Mercy D.,"Miami, FL",8,107,21,3.0,8/11/2015,Food is usually very good and the service is OK. I had lunch there today and noticed that their suggested tip located at the bottom of the receipt is calculated including the tax. This is the only restaurant that does this. We eat out a lot and no other restaurant has done this. Shame on you.
Tatiana E.,"Miami, FL",1,42,,4.0,7/15/2016,The food here is awesome! Anything you order will be great :) But the cheesecakes are even better.. Worth going just for dessert
Danny P.,"Miami, FL",0,9,,2.0,2/3/2017,Cheesecake Factory is hyped for no reason. We were a large group and one person ordered a pizza and digorno would have been better. Then my chicken Romano wasn't to good the chicken was a bit bland. I've gone a few times the only thing that actually tastes good is the orange chicken. Also ordered burger sliders and they brought out chicken sliders. Service is slow. But I feel like they need more waiters
Mauricio V.,"Miami, FL",68,98,48,1.0,7/18/2015,"FILTHY. This place is one of the DIRTIEST restaurants I've seen. First off, the menus we received were full of grime from who-knows-what, and bread crumbs. Secondly, our edamame arrived with a strand of spaghetti. Now, whether the plate it came in previously had spaghetti from a dining customer or the strand flew from the chef's utensils we will never know. Food was wayyy oversalted and overpriced. I will never eat here again."
Yanitza G.,"Little Havana, Miami, FL",3,27,31,5.0,8/3/2015,If there is one Cheesecake Factory I'll always come to its this one in dadeland. It never fails to have a staff that goes above and beyond to serve the public and I see the potential here. Especially with my last server Jessica who was so wonderful and pleasant. I actually enjoyed my time here because of her and servers like Akeem and Alex who sadly just left the restaurant. Servers like these always make me want to come back again and again. Thank you for being so wonderful and your staff is full of winners! Your cheesecake is phenomenal and I cannot wait to come back. Great job guys!
Savannah C.,"Miami, FL",32,7,,2.0,12/13/2016,Good food. But I ordered the pasta and marinara and was given the kids portion of the food. Good times good times.
Concerned C.,"Miami, FL",0,84,1,2.0,5/24/2016,The food is good but the service isn't. Why does everyone working here look so depressed? And why do they look pained when you ask for bread or water? Unfortunately it feels like this is a place on it's way down...
Oliver G.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,10,6,1.0,4/11/2016,I wanted medium well cheeseburger. It took half an hour and came nearly uncooked. Than i complained they brought again. This time was cooked but fries was very bad. Horrible cheeevake factory.
Emily R.,"Germantown, TN",40,253,623,5.0,3/26/2015,This place has the best meatloaf I have ever had in a restaurant. It has lovely little bits of vegetables mixed in with the ground beef. The seasoning is perfect. It comes out a little toasted on the edges with a crispy caramelized top with a tomato based sauce on that top then they cover it with a brown mushroom gravy. The mashed potatoes are so home made that they ga e a few whole chunks of potato in them. The corn and veggies on the side are perfect fly cooked and seasoned. The server was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is inviting and celebratory.
Treasure F.,"Mableton, GA",119,20,8,3.0,5/10/2016,"I really liked the place for the first time being there.I brought my mom there mothers day that just passed. She's been there before, though still enjoyed herself. She had the fish and chips. I had the club with fries.Everything was great. I had to take a strawberry cheesecake home.I will definitely be returning to try some more entries there."
Tina L.,"Miami, FL",2,56,28,4.0,5/17/2016,"Really can't go wrong coming here. Obviously it's nothing ""different"" but I do like to come to a place where it's familiar that I know it will be consistent. Prices are so reasonably, portions are larger than normal (some sharing portions) and ambiance is nice. The servers are very friendly. Will always keep coming back as long as it remains to consistent."
Daisy H.,"Miami, FL",17,28,12,4.0,5/29/2016,Amazing Hibachi steak better than most Japanese steak houses out there and if possible their chocolate tower cake is even better than heir cheesecake...a chocolate cloud on a plate.
Rosita B.,"Casselberry, FL",36,2,,2.0,6/20/2016,"Service took forever.  The appetizers were late.  Didn't even serve the kids food first at least.  With a 3yr, 4yr and 5yr, at least bring out their food so that they can eat.  Waiting forever, usually means that the food would not come out right, and I wouldn't return it because they will do something to it.  Was hungry, but because the wait was so long I lost my appetite....ugh they take forever....never eating at this location again."
