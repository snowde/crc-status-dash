Ayesha H.,"Miami, FL",0,20,,5.0,12/14/2016,Good food and drinks. The Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake is incredible
Kimberly K.,"Miami, FL",933,183,389,5.0,3/13/2014,"Started off with a strawberry lemonade, which was freshly made. You can even see the strawberry seeds in it! Since I dined with a group of 7, we devoured the bread in a few seconds! But the server brought us more brown bread within seconds, which was fresh and warm. I ordered a spicy chipotle chicken pasta to share with my sister, the portion was HUGE! Which I'm happy for because it makes the price worth it. The pasta was thrown in a creamy redish sauce, hence the the ""spicy"" part, and tortilla chips were added in for a crunchy kick, which was enjoyable. It was yummy, but not as yummy as the regular chipotle pasta they used to have. I guess they took it off the menu unfortunately, still a pleasant  entree though! To end the meal, we ordered a tiramisu cheesecake. I absolutely love the way they fused tiramisu cake with cheesecake, with the powdered top, bottom tiramisu cake texture, and cheesecake middle. It was light, the chocolate whip cream on top wasn't too heavy but a fluffy cream. Perfection. Definitely try this cheesecake and their flavored lemonades!"
Melanie M.,"Miami, FL",297,28,18,3.0,8/9/2016,"Came to cheesecake to celebrate my daughters birthday. Our server Giordi was great. Once we sat he brought water right to the table and bread. He took our appetizer orders which we got the corn tamales which were amazing and so addicting! The loaded nachos which are also great.. And the Mac and cheese balls which I wasn't to much of a fan of. I don't like much fried food... Anyways after the appetizers came we decided to order our main entries... 1.5 hours later still no food.. The food took forever! The kids were already half asleep, by this time you barely even want to eat. We spoke to a manager and I'm guessing he had several tables complain and he took care of the problem super quick and assured us we would not get charged for our main entrees. I ordered the 4 cheese pasta which is usually much more cheesy, but it was OK. We than ordered my daughter the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream to sing her happy birthday and it was really so rich and amazing!! I am giving 3 stars because normally service Is a big deal when coming to the restaurant and the food took way too long...."
Steve D.,"Miami, FL",0,9,,1.0,5/29/2017,"Well well well, very much disappointed with the overall service and food. Went there this Memorial Day on a Monday and I saw the average volume of customers. We must of waited over 45 minutes to get our meal while the server kept passing us by and saying anything till the last10 minutes. The food was barely warm and had another plate of barely having barely any sauce. Had to ask for extra sauce of which apparently was opened from the jar and not hot or warm sauce. We were so disappointed that we had to take the food to go. Also watch out for the drinks they tend to be over charged alot. Cheese Cake factory apparently is understaffing in not having the appropriate staff and need more food runners so that they can deliver the meal in appropriate conditions. It seems that they put all the responsibilities on the servers while the volume of guest increase of which they cannot provide professional and timely service to the customers."
Cesar M.,"Miami, FL",62,3,1,1.0,8/19/2015,"So I was so excited about ordering the Bam Bam Chicken and Shrimp plate, sadly when I got it it tasted like a bad mix of sweet lemons and plain chicken. For a Wednesday night it was a bit packed but no excuse for the bad service, our waiter was taking his sweet time checking in on us. Finally when we got our food wear to steal silverware from the table next to use because our table had none and after asking 2 different waiters (15 minutes later). Not worth the $20 plate and doubt I will be coming back."
Dini G.,"Miami, FL",325,10,8,4.0,5/21/2016,I'm a regular at Cheesecake Factory. It's a restaurant for anything from grab a bite with a loved one or big parties. I've always gotten the fried mac and cheese and it has yet to fail me. The servers are always kind and easy to get along with. I wouldn't change a thing about this location. Love it.
Lorin G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",289,168,482,1.0,12/17/2013,"Bar service sucks during the day! I ordered a Mojito and he didn't even muddle the mint! No lime! Didn't get the bread we were offered,appetizer was ran to the wrong table and didn't come back out until we said something about it! Mind you,we got half of it because the ""runner got bumped and knocked it on the floor""!!! So we waited for the rest to come out! Drinking our water down drinks while the bartender just sits chatting it up with a girl at the bar! Hasn't even asked how our meal is! We finally had enough and asked for the Manager. He came over and when I showed him my Mojito, he replied saying that they don't muddle lime and mint there! So maybe you should change the name from a Mojito to a drink with garnish!  He didn't comp, didnt apologize, nothing!  Never again.."
Tere F.,"Miami, FL",72,8,,1.0,7/9/2016,"Do you like cold calamari and charred pasta? Also, a restaurant that can't make a simple $14 chicken sandwich.  Then Cheesecake Factory Dadeland is the place to be. Order PastaDaVinci. First one came out salty, second one burnt, then a simple chicken sandwich had no chicken.  I give it 1 star because you can't screw up bread and they managed to serve cold water."
Nicole W.,"Miami, FL",106,248,571,5.0,2/15/2015,5 stars for Gina and her awesome service! 5 stars for the delish Tex-mex egg rolls and the creamy potato bacon soup! 10 stars for the Chocolate Tuxedo cheesecake!!
Megg S.,"Miami, FL",22,50,124,5.0,1/11/2015,"This is the best Cheesecake Factory hands down! I recommend the Louisiana chicken pasta and the stuffed mushrooms. But, the best part is the red velvet cheesecake. Good service and big portions!  I recommend this location over any other locations that they have."
Liliana L.,"Miami, FL",91,87,144,2.0,2/1/2016,"I really like there menu.  The waiting Is terrible at any time any day.  Service is awful. . Don't bother in complaining,  sit and wait.  Management is never around and waisted time. This cheesecake is the only one down south , that's why we have  no choice. It's a shame that the management don't care about customer service."
Sandra A.,"Miami, FL",82,46,136,5.0,3/8/2014,I love coming here. Everything is amazing from their delicious breads to the legendary cheesecakes. Their salads are also great and have an enormous portion.  This place is great for a group lunch or a company lunch. It's also a great happy hour to dinner place. Five stars all the way!
Aimee R.,"Miami, FL",105,83,158,5.0,2/11/2015,"I don't come here too often. Today I decided. Shopping so I wanted to just relax and have a little lunch. I sat at the bar, Jerry was great. Very polite and attentive. I chose the chicken slider apps. Oh my god so delicious. Perfect for a chilly day. For an app was pretty generous with the portions. Came with 4 fried chicken slidders accompanied with fries, but that was extra. The sauce was divine. A kind of thousand island type but much better. I accompanied with a glass of Pinot Grigio. I'm so excited to find out that they have happy hour M-F 4-6 and this app is on it for under $6. Very pleased with y experience today. And since it was during the week, no crowds!"
Victoria H.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,2.0,10/2/2016,"We have been regulars at the Cheesecake Factory in Dadeland and Coconut Grove for many years.  The Dadeland location consistently disappoints in the quality of its food for Sunday brunch.  Eggs were cold, bread hard, and coffee luke warm.  Service too was incredibly slow, which we would tolerate if our food were at least hot."
Deborah L.,"Miami, FL",2,16,34,5.0,8/21/2016,"To add on what the previous comment my husband made, Anthony Lonfontaine's customer service is what you define as excellent customer service. Not only is he funny, provides excellent options, but he goes above and beyond to make sure that our food arrives exactly how it is ordered. My biggest pet peeve is when you go to a restaurant and order a dish with specific modifications and when it actually comes out, the server did not make those modifications so you have to wait for them to correct it and bring it again. Every time I come here and Anthony serves us I can rest assure that the food always comes out exactly how it is ordered. I can honestly say it is a pleasure every time we come here and get served by him. Excellent customer service is taking the time to know your customers and explain the menu items with such detail that it gets them excited for their order. We just want to thank Anthony for once again making our dinning experience special."
Christopher C.,"Gaithersburg, MD",6,72,195,1.0,8/26/2014,"I have always enjoyed the food at the Cheesecake Factory - most recently the Greek salad has become a favorite with the Teriyaki Chicken and the Pepperoni Pizza. Of course I love the desserts!  I have eaten here several times when staying at the Marriott Miami Dadeland. It's an easy walk from the hotel.  The reason a 3.5 star establishment gets 1 star is the absurd corporate policy of sending out kids menu food on plates to hot to the touch. Why they cannot simply plate on regular plates is beyond me. Every time we are there with our kids, we have to send their orders back to be re-plated. As long as this continues to be corporate policy at the Cheesecake Factory, I will give everyone I eat at 1 star reviews despite the level of the service."
Michaelangelo D.,"Fairview, NJ",0,1,,5.0,1/26/2016,Such a great place - wonderful customer service.  Our food was taking a while and Jose (the manager) came by our table and apologized.  Can't remember when a manager at a restaurant did that.
Lasse L.,"Tampere, Finland",2,58,114,4.0,8/21/2015,"What a great place for lunch! It's very peaceful and disconnects you from the surroundings. The restaurant itself has a nice enough feel to it for dinner (it's a Cheesecake Factory after all), but Dadeland Mall does not really do it for me. It probably also gets noisy at peak hours. Parking can be a bit tricky, but the location is anyway convenient when you're zapping up or down Palmetto. The service was very friendly, and I enjoyed my visit a lot. I only had the lunch size pizza. For dinner, you just can't leave without having some cheesecake. Next time!"
K D.,"Miami, FL",8,37,1,5.0,12/19/2014,"I've come to cheesecake factory for years and it has been a personal favorite for my family and I, but mostly just me.  Let's be honest, its actually for their complimentary bread, but i digress.. i love everything about cheesecake factory and their options. They are endless, ranging from apps to entrees, drinks or just desserts. Prices are so reasonable based on the amount of food you get. There is an option for everyone, which is why its a no brainer choice for dinner. Apps to try : Lettuce wraps, spinach & artichoke dip, avocado egg rolls. The Louisiana chicken pasta is what has brought me back for years...."
Kyriakos P.,"Miami, FL",13,11,2,2.0,12/1/2015,We were doing some shopping at the mall and wanted to try it. Overall bad quality of food and bad service. Will not return
