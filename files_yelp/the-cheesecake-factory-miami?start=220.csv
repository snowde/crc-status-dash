Christina T.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/18/2016,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service!!! Got seated at 930. Water came to the table at 1000. That already was upsetting. Good was ordered at 1030. Food arrived at 1130. They blamed the kitchen but every other table was getting their food. Not to mention the food came cold. The server knew we were upset and called the manager to speak with us. We than ordered a cheesecake and that alone took 20 minutes. After such a horrible service you would think that atleast dessert will arrive quickly. No. It's midnight and they see us leaving and chase us to give us the cheesecake. Horrible horrible. We will never come to again to Cheesecake Factory!! Stay away.
Gokarna K.,"Charlotte, NC",3,42,31,3.0,8/8/2015,Great place to go and enjoy the food of your taste.. They tries to keep more option to attract more customer but i think they failed doing so.. I like there desert which is always the best but not there food.
Carlos g.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,1.0,5/8/2015,"We just order our meal and I order a chicken Alfredo pasta, and once I receive it. It had a long black hair. I was so disgusted. The manager came and said I'm so sorry. All she did for our family was take my plate off of the bill. This place sucks."
Belinda B.,"Miami, FL",38,316,165,1.0,6/18/2014,"Decided to drop by for a quick lunch..kale salad-overdressed...grilled chicken-bland and dry...table and utensils and chairs and floors-dirty....service - limited. Clean up everything!  Note: With the addition of new restaurants in Dadeland, you really need to step up your game. IJS"
JC T.,"Miami, FL",50,77,57,5.0,8/1/2015,"Quality here is always good.  I have being here several times , chicken Marsala is amazing and one of my favorites.  Filet mignon is as good as most of stake houses, highly recommend.  This is a place where the whole family can eat, large variate of items to chose from"
arturo c.,"Miami, FL",454,23,1659,4.0,12/26/2013,I recomend this place for every once in a while. Good quality price nice atmosphere and a variety menu
Clelia C.,"Miami, FL",61,44,3,5.0,7/15/2015,I really like this place! Food is real good and cheesecakes are to die for!!!! Wide variety of food choices to fit every stomach and budget. Just wish it was not always so loud and crowded! A must try!
Adrienne L.,"Homestead, FL",92,50,52,4.0,5/24/2015,I like Cheesecake Factory on lazy weekends . I like more of the lunch and dinner menu. The lemon chicken and the miso salmon are my favorites. The patio is to sit and people watch. I enjoy the cheesecake on birthdays my favorite are the snickers and the red velvet.
Sirmugen,"Miami, FL",2,22,56,2.0,6/22/2014,"Had dinner here with my wife and kid.  Everything started off fine and service was great.  I've eaten here million of time and always been great.  This time for some reason the food took forever (1 hour) sitting next to us was another couple who sat down 30 after us and got their found at about the same time.  Both waiter and manager came by to tell us our food was coming out and they had an issue with the angel hair pasta.  Ok, I continue to wait.  Then when the food came out it was not what I was expecting.  No where on the menu stated it had heavy cream, just says it has lemon sauce with capers.  This was like a thick fettuccine sauce.  I could not eat it with my cholesterol issue.  The manager stated that he would make me something else but that it would take some time.  It might take another hour so I didn't want to wait and ask for the check.   I might not come back.  Since now they open so many other restaurant in dadeland (Earls, Aoki, etc)"
Alex B.,"Miami, FL",56,217,50,4.0,6/22/2015,"Really enjoyed the skinny menu. Was not aware that Cheesecake Factory created a lower calorie menu. It has a nice variety of mixed drinks, appetizers and entrees. Unfortunately, no skinny cheesecake but with the calories saved on your meal go ahead and splurge on your favorite cheesecake"
Gabriel Q.,"Miami, FL",24,61,89,2.0,6/21/2014,"Stopped by for lunch with my wife. Have dined here before and was looking forward to a great experience. I was wrong. Service was disappointing. When the time came for lunch entree orders the server only asked me what I wanted after my wife had ordered and prompted him to ask (he has already begun to walk away). Only after it became clear I was upset (well after my wife's salad has been served) did he ask if everything was ok.  As for the food - the avocado egg rolls had an overpowering sundried tomato flavor; they were crisp, but with an off putting metallic aftertaste. Wife enjoyed them (she loves sundried tomato, so their heavy handed inclusion didn't faze her). The tuna carpaccio was pretty dreadful; wasabi aioli with little flavor (might as well have been mayo), and a sweetness to the dish that totally overpowered the tuna.  As I write this I'm still hungry, and heading somewhere else for food. What could have been a wonderful lunch was very disappointing; so much so that I left my Blue Moon Ale untouched, paid the bill and left.  With all the options nearby I hope CF gets it right next time!"
Melissa G.,"Miami, FL",2,8,2,4.0,7/30/2014,"I have enjoyed every dish I've ever had here. Especially their bistro shrimp pasta! Would recommend it to anyone (even though it's a little high on calories). Also most of the pastas I've had have been very tasty and unique. Not to mention their appetizers, salads, and drinks!!! All come in very fair sizes for their price.  Atmosphere is great, service is great. Staff is very well trained and helpful.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. Would go back any day."
Sarah C.,"Miami, FL",0,40,2,2.0,1/4/2015,"First and last time coming here. I came out with the family for what I hoped to be a small, quiet, birthday dinner. We ended up being disappointed with just about every part of the meal. First of all, a 40 minute wait in heels with absolutely nowhere to sit was terrible. The entire waiting area was a circus. It looked like the entrance to some kind of overrated night club. The hostesses were attempting to yell names over the roar of the crowd. Apparently the pagers they give you are completely pointless because if you stray out of yelling range you'll never get sat. The experience didn't get too much better once we eventually were seated. It was still incredibly loud at our table even though we were sitting in a separate dining area from the main restaurant. Our waitress was barely ever around and every time she was at the table she seemed like she was in a rush to get away again. I ordered the baja chicken tacos. They were so soggy that they fell apart completely every time I took a bite. Thankfully the tortilla chips I had leftover from the spinach dip actually made the dish edible. Another person ordered garlic noodles with shrimp which was just overly greasy pasta with 4 overcooked shrimp. The other people at the table were happy with their salads. Dessert was the best part but they couldn't get that right either. We ordered 2 different cheesecakes which were delicious and an apple crisp that looked like ****. It was literally swimming in melted ice cream and had a huge exaggerated dollop of whipped cream in the middle. Not to mention ""Happy Birthday""  written in chicken scratch on the plate. Horrible presentation. Once I got rid of 80% of the whipped cream and swam through the ice cream soup to get to the actual dessert, it was delicious. I'm only giving it the 2nd star because the spinach dip and the cheesecake were good. Other than that this place was a complete disappointment."

Danieska S.,"Miami, FL",0,11,,1.0,3/25/2014,"Let me start off with the fact that I actually like Cheesecake Factory, but the one in Dadeland Mall is really skeevy. I went for brunch. The table they sat us in was dirty (syrup on the chairs and table top).  I ordered a plain Belgian waffle and 2 plain scrambled eggs. The waffle tasted like cardboard and the eggs had ingredients from someone else's eggs. What is SO hard about PLAIN eggs? Needless to say, I left hungry and disappointed. I will definitely never eat there again."
Mar M.,"Hialeah, FL",0,3,,4.0,4/28/2016,Great for Cheesecake! I'm not a big fan of the entrees usually disappointed with the meals but I love the cheesecake it's always good and so many types to choose from! The slices are really bit enough for 2 people to share!
Molly A.,"Miami, FL",166,5,13,1.0,5/4/2015,"Bestie and I ordered a chorizo and avocado omelette.... Instead they brought us an omelette with veggies...we were confused! There was no sight of chorizo or avocado's, so we asked our waiter if he gave us the right omelette and the guy assured us he did..we were like ""where is the avocado? cause we don't see it"" he's like ""oh it's in there""  I feel like we were getting pranked lol. His manager came to our table and he also seemed lost. Do they not know what chorizo and avocado look like?!? Or am I going crazy?? I failed by not taking a photo!! At the end, he brought us a sliced avocado and chorizo...those two things were definitely not in our omelette! So yeah, I'm not crazy!"
Alex B.,"Orlando, FL",18,36,9,1.0,12/26/2014,"This chain is been always one of my favorite and specially this particular location because the amount of years living in Miami and the fact that every time I come to Miami my family and friend meet on this location. Unfortunately this time the service couldn't be worse from the moment that we put our names in the waiting list till the moment that we were seated. When I called the manager Casey he listened and then told me ""I perfectly understand because when I go out with my wife twice a week it means more to me than the rest of the week at work"" and left. No acknowledgement of the issue, apology or addressing the issue. I guess that for him he doesn't care about one customer when he have a 45 min waiting time at the door. As a manager of a hotel, for me is extremely important that every single customer is happy and extremely satisfied with their experience in my hotels regardless how good I may be doing in revenue. For me one single unhappy customer is as important as 100 happy ones.  I guess at this point I will be going to someplace else when in Miami and I'm sure Casey doesn't care. The only good thing during this stay was our server Bobbie she was great."
Carlo G.,"Miami, FL",2,43,5,5.0,6/19/2014,"Service: 5/5 Our waiter came by our table every 10 minutes and always had a nice smile on her face. Check came quickly and the waiter actually said she was pleased to serve us.  Decor: 5/5 The restaurant is big, clean, will lit, and in a great location. The Renaissance theme goes well with the food. Food: 4/5 All of the plates we ordered were very good (fried cheese, 4 cheese pasta, pizzas, salmon pasta, and cheesecakes). The variety is also excellent, pizzas, pastas, appetizers, meats, fish, vegan... Value: 4/5 Expect about $30-$40 per person. It is well worth it given the quality, variety of the food and being right in Dadeland."
Amanda F.,"Miami, FL",29,87,32,4.0,4/4/2015,"Although getting a table is always a mission, I always walk out with a full and happy tummy. The fried mac & cheese is a must. I almost ALWAYS order the Cajun Louisiana pasta. The burgers are pretty good too!"
