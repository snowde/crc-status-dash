Ivette R.,"Miami, FL",268,1047,251,5.0,8/31/2014,I love Cheesecake Factory and I always have.I ordered a Salad and a strawberry Cheesecake they were both great and delicious but the Strawberry Cheesecake is the bomb also our waiter was nice and not pushy and it's in Dadeland Mall and is packed but really clean and fast and great service
Jadine R.,"Miami, FL",142,70,227,4.0,7/31/2011,"Not the healthiest restaurant to go to, with it's oversized plates of food and undeniably tempting cheesecakes, but delicious nonetheless. :D Favorite dishes hands down: Crispy spicy beef-Thin tender cuts of beef deep fried and tossed in a mild spicy savory sauce served with white rice.  Hibachi Steak-Good juicy piece of steak, mashed potatoes with a wasabi butter over top and tempura asparagus.  Bang Bang chicken and shrimp-Chicken and shrimp tossed in one of the most creamy and succelent sauces ever, served with white rice. It's got a hint of coconut-y sweetness. Yum Vietnamese Tacos-Asian sauced pork with fresh cucumber salad in a bao. Delish Ahi Tartare-Yes please!!! Factory Samplers-4 plates full of different Cheesecake factory appetizers as a meal or shared with a big group of people. Unfortunately this item was taken off the menu! :(  $25.00 for a plethora of their appetizers in ONE! (Unfortunately they've removed this wonderful variety of foods from the menu) Cheesecake Favs: Red Velvet Cookie Dough"
Leo G.,"Inglewood, CA",5,7,23,5.0,5/24/2014,"This is a really good restaurant, great service and good food. Nice atmosphere and décor."
Connor T.,"Miami, FL",9,28,28,4.0,4/2/2015,"I really enjoyed my experience here. The servers that were attentive to our table were outstanding. They were very friendly and went out of their way to connect with us. I can't give a full 5 stars because the meal I had was just okay- I had the chicken enchiladas. They were good, but not outstanding. The cheesecake at the end though was definitely delicious though. Overall a good experience this evening."
Kiki B.,"Greenville, SC",196,135,48,1.0,7/30/2013,"Ok, everyone knows the food here is fantastic, with huge portions and the most variety EVER on a menu.  This review is about the server that we got today.  We went in for the half price cheesecake deal they were having since we wanted to taste the s'mores cheesecake.  We were seated right away and the waiter came over and immediately put bread on our table, which was hugely appreciated since we had two small children with us that we could entertain with the bread and butter:)   He came back over to take our order and when we said we were just ordering cheesecake and lemonades for the kids he looked super annoyed and stalked away from our table.  A few minutes later he puts the two plates of cheesecake on our table and yanks the bread basket (still full of bread) and the butter plate off of the table and walks away.   So, we eat away at our cheesecake while pining away for our bread and butter, that we were enjoying immensely by the way, and lo and behold, toddler number one spills water all over our booth and my daughter, her mother's lap.  My daughter jumps up to clean up the mess and catches a glimpse of the waiter standing a few feet away rolling his eyes in annoyance.   When he sees that she saw him he breaks eye contact and runs to get some napkins to give us to clean up.  To his credit, he seemed embarrassed and did try to be more helpful the rest of the time.   I'm still a little bitter about the bread incident which is why I am writing this review."
Jorge D.,"Miami, FL",107,183,54,2.0,10/27/2014,"I will be honest that i find it very hard to review this place. There are a million things on the menu so tasting a critical mass is impossible, the wait staff is all over the board from really great to just plain awful.  So I guess i will give my over all critic.  the food is good, nothing to write home about.  I did try their new skinny menu and it was rather nice with lots of healthier options.  The place is always very loud and for unknown reasons the floors are always amazingly slippery. Its an OK chain, but there is much better food out there."
Carlos D.,"Miami, FL",43,28,8,3.0,3/15/2014,Food is delicious but this time the service was just terrible. We sat down at a table and the waitress brought us water and bread. She comes back we order and we tell her to please bring my daughters food out first. So she can start eating right away. Then a couple sits next to us on the next table down. They order and get there food before my daughters food ever even comes out. By the time the food came out I was already full from the bread and water settling in my stomach. Need less to say I had to ask for the rest of the food to go. I ask for a to go box and they check and she brings the box and forgets the check. Then I had to wait another 5 mins. for the check. I know cheese cake factory is normally a great experience but this one waitress was apparently lost. Normally I have a 5 star experience here.
Denise G.,"Miami, FL",0,13,14,5.0,7/13/2015,"Cheesecake Factory makes me happy! Everything was delicious today - luau salad, Thai lettuce wraps, tamale cakes, avocado egg rolls, and of course the yummy passion tea and brown bread - food coma after that but if I had room then the tuxedo cheesecake would have been mine."
Helen H.,"Duluth, GA",290,703,850,4.0,1/21/2014,"Can always rely on this place for take out, lunch or dinner while shopping, place to go eat dinner with friends or family. And of course, the cheesecake."
Paul C.,"Miami, FL",13,16,,4.0,11/22/2013,"Finally got a chance to eat here. I have no idea why its taken me so many years to go.  Good service. Had the avocado eggrolls to start. Very good. Ordered the Habachi steak. Good steak, not as rare as I would have liked but soft and full of flavor. You cant go without trying a slice of cheesecake or at least thats what they tell me. I went with the pumpkin cheesecake (its that time of year, lol) Very good. Would I come here all the time? No, but its a solid place to eat."
Katy S.,"Chicago, IL",486,333,383,3.0,10/10/2011,"Whenever my friends/family can't decide where to eat and everyone keeps going back and forth saying ""I don't care, wherever you want""...I always suggest the cheesecake factory. You know why? Because there truly is something for everyone.  You want a huge, tasty salad? Sure. You want a burger and fries? Sure. You want tacos? Sure. How about fish? Sure.    The menu is endless.  Now is the food AMAZING? NO. but it's mediocre and satisfies. I always always get the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and it never disappoints me. MY boyfriend loves the Shepard's Pie. The cheesecakes are pretty good. I would hope so since it's called the damn Cheesecake Factory, lol.  Anyways...I do suggest this restaurant if you're in the area and want something better to eat than Chili's."
Mario R.,"Miami, FL",32,188,80,4.0,11/6/2014,"They now have happy hour specials! :-) however, the entrees are still hit or miss and the drinks are very limited on the happy hour menu. Aside from that the appetizers, cheesecake, and quality of food and drinks are at least 4 stars. Currently, it's head and shoulders above any other chain that doesn't charge $40+ per person."
Elizabeth B.,"Cutler Bay, FL",8,6,5,3.0,4/9/2015,Sitting at Cheesecake Factory right now. We love this place. The food is always great. The Happy Hour is fantastic. The reason I give it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because of the service in the bar area. It seems like every time we go it takes forever to get someone to notice you in the bar area and take your order.
Alessandria R.,"Miami, FL",5,19,13,1.0,4/17/2015,"Hostesses at the front were completely rude and ""mean girls"" , they lost our name and kept calling people that came in after Us. We never got bread until our entrees came which came before our appetizers so we had to send those back. The manager came by and I told him what happened and he just apologized and went on his merry way. He didn't even comp a soda. Not that we needed him too ... But damn ... Your restaurant is completely failing at the moment and all you can say is ""sorry"". A multi million dollar franchise and they couldn't even comp 1 soda? The restaurant is completely understaffed with servers so they're having to do the work of 3 servers at a time. I'm not coming back here for a while. My husband and I were excited to have a nice calm meal and we got the exact opposite. At least the food tasted good... But I was already in a bad mood. Blah...."
Michael C.,"Wayzata, MN",3,4,,5.0,4/12/2015,"Very solid place for an enjoyable dinner for people of all tastes. The menu is HUGE, but it is still relatively easy to find what you want. I had the avocado egg rolls,  which were incredible. The service is also excellent. Our drinks were always full and all of our questions about the menu or recommendations were answered very well. The worst part about this place is the consistently long wait time to get a table."
Saily L.,"Miami, FL",228,138,565,5.0,11/11/2011,"I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY! I always get so excited when I come here. I love the service, the ambience, the food, the drinks, the CHEESECAKES! Everything. The plates are huge, more than 2 people should share. The price is good for the amount of food being served. I will never stop coming here. Everywhere I go I always look to see where is the nearest restaurant."
Jennifer D.,"Miami, FL",77,105,31,5.0,1/14/2015,"We celebrated my mother's birthday at this location, and we had an excellent waiter! I believe the receipt read Mound as his name. It simply does not get better than the service he provided us with. Thank you!"
Liset W.,"Miami, FL",6,10,3,3.0,5/17/2015,"Great food like always, however they have to change their alcohol rules. Who has brunch without mimosas????  If you want to have a real brunch please come after 12, is kind of like Cinderella but fun begins after 12 not before!!"
Bianca B.,"Miami, FL",13,3,,4.0,10/2/2014,I love the Louisiana Chicken pasta. I also love the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer :)
Anita C.,"Miami, FL",0,2,7,5.0,4/26/2015,"Amazing food!!!!!!! I never thought we would get 3 gigantic specialty dishes, drinks and dessert for $60 something. Plus our server was a total sweetheart, waited a quite time before this indecisive girls choose something and she was always trying to talk in Spanish (she did it really well). I order the Chicken Madeira, my sister  Carbonara Pasta and my mom, the pasta with chicken and scampi sauce! My dish was an exquisite combination of soft-tendered chicken breast soaked up in a red-ish delicious sauce and topped with lots of melted mozzarella cheese and also accompanied by mashed potatoes with prosciutto on the top. Of course i only got to eat half the dish bc it was HUGE, but besides all was probably one of the best chickens i'd ever ate!! But the best part for sure, was the dessert. We couldnt leave The Cheesecake Factory without trying obv their famous and signature dessert, the cheesecake, but we were kinda full so we decided to order one cheesecake for my sister and I (my mom just took a bite). And then we found ourselves in the front of a 30 plus cheesecake menu!!!!! We wanted a classic one but they all looked amazing. We ended up choosing the most famous one, Oreo Cheesecake. I was speechless, i really mean it. It was one of the best things i'd ever had in my life. It was huge too, topped with a gigant oreo and had like these lawyers of oreo, milk chocolate mousse and some other delish things! Ps: bc it is a famous mall like Dadeland, we had to wait close to 15 minutes but it was nothing to die for or complaint about. We just stand there and wait like everyone else did and it was allllllll worthy!!!!!!"
