Green L.,"Homestead, FL",1,117,,5.0,3/4/2015,Chicken alfredo w sundried tomatos w a red velvet cheesecake for desert and a few Stellas=SATISFIED
Maja I.,"Miami, FL",0,9,,1.0,4/25/2015,"I would normally leave at least 4 stars but this time that's not possible. I used to frequent this location bc it's very close to my house and the service is always good. But last week I went there, requested a booth. I sat down and immediately saw a dead roach, followed by its very much alive friend. I asked the waiter to kill it and she kinda just froze and called the manager. He looked bothered that I was disgusted by this occurrence. Paying 20 bucks a plate and this is what I get? He never apologized and just walked away saying that someone was going to sweep it up. Never again. That's gross on so many leaves and where there's 2 there's more."
Sabrina C.,"Miami, FL",370,698,193,4.0,11/23/2010,"I've always loved the cheesecake factory! Although I had not visited for quite sometime, my friend and I decided to do brunch on a Sunday morning.  Our waiter was very polite and attentive. I ordered the breakfast that comes with scrambled egg whites, wheat toast, potatoes and orange juice. Quite a healthy combination!  My friend ordered the french toast and orange juice. Our waiter also brought us that yummy bread they always serve, I'm a fan of the wheat one! Overall, a nice experience, laid back atmosphere. We didn't have room for dessert this time..but I got my eye on one of those cheesecakes!"
Carolina M.,"Rockville, MD",85,72,52,2.0,11/9/2014,"Worst curbside pick up service. My bad experience started in my call to place the order. I was on hold for over 10' and had to call a second time and finally someone picked up.  I got there, called and a girl brought the food with the check. Another 10' went by and I decided to step out of the car (which defeats the purpose of the curbside pick-up) and went to the front desk to complain). The girl finally brought the credit card receipt and acted like she didn't care about the delay. I'll never use this service again.  Food was ok"
Sydney M.,"Pinecrest, FL",4,49,39,4.0,12/16/2014,"The line can get very long here. They offer curb side pick up so if you don't necessarily want to dine in the restaurant you can get your food to go. If you're willing to wait, you'll experience the typical Cheesecake Factory experience of huge menus, portions and lots of calories. They have good salads, but even their salads aren't that healthy. The service is good but sometimes slow."
Madeleine C.,"Miami, FL",77,125,28,4.0,4/1/2013,"Why wouldn't you like this place?  It's no 5* restaurant with a hand selected wine list but it's not supposed to be.  The portions are huge, the dishes are flavorful (and absolutely the most fattening you will find out there) and the selection is vast.  I like Cheesecake factory.  The only thing that keeps me away is how I feel after I eat - heavy and extremely full. For every 3 lbs I lose, I let myself eat here once =)"
Janeisie R.,"Miami, FL",50,18,2,5.0,7/21/2014,"This restaurant chain has always been one of my faves. This location specifically has improved since the renovation. Unfortunately, it will always have a long wait time but it's worth it. My fave drink is the Georgia Peach. Their Chicken Madeira is awesome. Any cheesecake is delicious but i love the oreo one and the dulce de leche."
Adry G.,"Miami, FL",242,247,243,4.0,7/13/2013,"Great service and amazing food. I had tried the pizza flatbreat and Parmesan chicken that was listed in the ""small plates"". I was originally skeptic to try it since my waiter said it was really small but it was so full that I had to take food home."
Illy S.,"Miami, FL",70,3,3,1.0,3/20/2015,"I would soooo rate this a 5 star if its about service. But i just left like 5 minutes ago and saw the manager Anthony Rine screaming at an employee IN FRONT OF AT LEAST 10 COSTUMERS. im sorry but that's so not professional. Its horrible to see how these ""managers"" belittle their staff. Im really disappointed..."
Monster R.,"Miami, FL",16,13,12,1.0,8/3/2014,"Had lunch with 2 friends. Waitress was horrible! No napkins , no refills,  never checked in on us. Saw her twice the whole visit.  Once to take our order and second when she brought the check.  Really rude and unfriendly. We mentioned it to the manager Bruce and he was really defensive .  He didn't hear us out not did he try yo fiX it. This has to be by far the worst Cheesecake Factory experience ever!"
Maria M.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,1/31/2016,"Do not do takeout on a Sunday night...and if you must do not pay until you receive your food. I waited 45 minutes for 1 appetizer & 1 pasta entree ...only to be told our order was not in the system. The same server that took my order told me ""No, you must have placed it with someone else."""
Stephen G.,"Miami, FL",112,42,21,4.0,6/29/2012,"""But mummy I don't like cheesecake"" - 10 year old me.  Today, I actually love cheescake and am thrilled to share that you have way more than just cheesecake to choose from.  Try the following: Sautéed Mushrooms Lettuce Wraps Chicken Madeira Fried Macaroni and Cheese Jiaozi (Pot Stickers) and of course, Oreo Cheesecake! Honestly, the menu is endless, you're bound to find something you'd like. It is a bit on the pricey side $15-35, but you get huge portions, so it's worth it. You'll definitely be taking some home with you.   It's very nice inside, almost has a early 1700's European look to it. Lots of pillars. They have a small cafe inside that makes excellent coffee. There's also a full bar inside that's great for Happy Hour. I usually wait about 10-15 minutes before I'm seated. Not too shabby for a busy place like this.  Don't listen to my 10 year old self and go visit next time you're in Dadeland."
Becky T.,"Fishkill, NY",5,7,7,1.0,10/12/2014,"They ran out of fresh bread, served old veggies in the salad, wouldn't serve us a glass of water until the 3rd time we asked. Finally, a HUGE RAT came up from behind our booth and scaled up the wall. We got a free dinner. This was an awful experience after a few bad ones there before... Never coming back!!"
Mari C.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,5.0,1/24/2015,We took my husband to celebrate his birthday had a wonderful time the food was great  excellent service will come back for sure !
Milochka M.,"Miami, FL",28,3,,4.0,11/29/2014,"Great food, specialy now with the Fit menu I can go more often and not feel guilty. But I must have my pasta once in a while. The service is good even though they are always packed.  They bring the food in time at the right temperature."
Jamie S.,"Miami, FL",371,257,435,4.0,1/24/2013,I never get tired of coming here. I always sample new items on the menu...the only constant is my Godiva Cheesecake. Heaven on a plate.  Waits are usually awful and they totally over serve but I don't really mind.
E D.,"Miami, FL",0,10,4,1.0,7/15/2016,"I have been to another location which was always excellent however this location was terrible! came to this location Wednesday 3/15 around noon with my sister. They sat us in the outside tables and we waited for our waiter for awhile. When the waiter finally shows he doesn't greet us with his name and only asks ""what will you have to drink"". We reply water and he just leaves without even asking if we want an appetizer and are ready to order. I'm from miami so I don't scare easily and just thought maybe he was having a rough day. I decided to be patient. The waiter proceeds to attend to both tables next to us wth a smile on his face. This goes on for about 15 minutes until he comes to take our order. We ask for bread since we're starving and again he seems in a  rush. We receive 4 breads (smallest basket ever) around 10 minutes after that and our waiter is still in a rush and doesn't even ask if we are ready to order. He again goes to serve and converse with the other two tables. At this point, both my sister and I are noticing that he definitely has an issue with us specifically. We get his attention and he reluctantly takes our order in a rush again. We barely get a word in and he seems bothered to answer our questions. He rushes off again. We waited about 45 minutes for our burgers and of course the order is wrong. During this time we didn't have any contact with the waiter ( not even to refill water). He continues to skip over us and go to the next table. We decide to leave our food untouched and just let the hostess know that we had a bad experience and would like to leave. I asked her if she needed me to pay for the bread and she said no. We left hungry and headed to Bobby's burgers which was awesome!!!. I was so disappointed because I do love cheesecake factory and have many great memories there. I don't know if he didn't want to serve us correctly because we look young and he wasn't expecting a tip or if maybe he just broke up with his girlfriend and hated women that day. Just an overall horrible experience and I didnt really like the way the hostess handled it either."
Stephen M.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,1.0,1/7/2016,"just had a horrible lunch at this site.  The Asia Chicken Salad had almost no chicken.  One guest had to return their pear salad because it had no pears.  The french fries were old, dry and soggy--inedible.  The so-called classic hamburger was sad, tasteless, dry and the bread served upside-down.  All is all a sad experience.  This is now the 2nd or 3rd bad experience in recent time.  I will never return!   By the way----the cheesecakes here have become mostly air."
Betty A.,"Miami, FL",52,78,8,4.0,7/8/2012,"Yesterday Saturday my boyfriend and I were going to the movies nearby but before, we stopped by Cheesecake factory in order to have dinner. We were impressed. First of all, we got there around 8 p.m. and saw that there was a big line just to place our name in the list. We waited in line for about 7 minutes and then we were told there was 10 minutes wait for our party of 2. That was fine for us compared to what we heard to other parties waiting in line: 25 minutes. However, our name was called in about 5 minutes. Very fortunate. We were seated and we perused the menu until our waiter Jose came to greet us. He told us about the specials for the day and we proceed to order. I wanted to drink something refreshing with a little alcohol and decided on the while Sangria. Jose truly recommended it and even told me that if I did not like it he would gladly exchange it. Usually they bring out a basket of white and pumpernickel bread. My boyfriend, knowing we had the same taste, told our waiter to bring out only white bread.  While we were waiting for our drinks and decided on our entrees, our water and bread with butter immediately came. I ordered the chicken teriyaki which consisted of chicken breast charbroiled with teriyaki sauce, served with steamed rice. My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken which was deep fried pieces of chicken breast covered in a sweet and spicy orange sauce. Served with white rice and vegetables. Ok so my White Sangria was delicious. Very fruity, sweet and refreshing. My teriyaki chicken was great. What I did not know is that the chicken is served with the skin which the teriyaki sauce is on it. I don't eat chicken skin,  and if i known that I would have ordered to take the skin off and place the teriyaki on top of the skinless breast but it was tasty after all. I rubbed my meat on top of it just to give it the teriyaki flavor and the steamed rice had a bit of the teriyaki sauce on the side of it just to make it sweeter. I tasted a piece of my boyfriend's Orange Chicken and it was great but glad I did not ordered that plate as I was not in the mood of eating fried food that evening. He said it was very good.  All in all, we got in an out in a good amount of time and our waiter rocked!!"
Ciro M.,"Miami, FL",29,10,2,1.0,10/14/2015,We love The Cheesecake factory but this cheesecake factory at Dadeland Mall really stinks. But first of all the floor is always super greasy which makes us feel like we're going to go ice skating on marble floors.... complete liability. I decided to take the family out to dinner and the waitress build ketchup all over my white shirt and that became a fiasco.....  she brings her hot water to get the stain out which didn't work. And luckily the the manager is really nice and he try to do everything in his power to fix the situation. We visit the cheesecakes around town a lot since I have a big family and everybody always can find something they like and are in the mood to eat but this specific cheesecake just can't get it right. This is not our first incident at that specific cheesecake. I hope they get it right because in the meantime we're at Dadeland Mall we're going to have to hit the other restaurants for that I'm not mad....lol
