Aggy O.,"New York, NY",614,123,51,5.0,5/23/2012,"I usually am VERY critical and don't usually give a full 5 stars but they made my experience enjoyable! I had never been before and this was my first time trying this amazing place! First off the wheat bread is delicious! I kept asking for refills!  The spinach dip was amazing! Dip your honey bread on the spinach dip, its the best thing you will ever do! I got the delicious Fettuccine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes! It was amazing! Huge portion too for a lunch special! I had a good amount to take home!  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, no complaints. Pleasant experience. Will come back to this location again!"
Michael R.,"Miami, FL",44,37,1,3.0,4/12/2013,"We came here last night and our waitor, for the firs time ever in any Cheesecake Factory, was a total douche. He barely checked in on us, had a weird attitude about even taking our orders, and rushed us out.  Other then the douchebag waitor everything else was great. My wife and I ordered from the 'Skinny' menu and both our meals were great.  We even splurged on a slice of cheesecake and it was heaven. A little too bitter (dark chocolate) for me but right up my wifes alley.  I would come back. I'm sure the waiter situation was a fluke."
Jan N.,"Miami, FL",340,241,94,4.0,6/30/2012,"I know, I know.  It's a chain restaurant - but don't act like you don't eat at any.  They're everywhere.  What are you going to do? I'm a whore for Cheesecake Factory, and I don't care if that's not the cool, hip, obscure thing to do.  I like this place, and I will come here forever! Fried Mac N' Cheese.  Yes.  Parmesan Crusted Chicken with white sauce.  Yes.  Kobe Beef Burger.  Yes.  Oreo Cheesecake.  Yes.  Will I come back for more? Yes. Case closed!"
Jeff S.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,5.0,12/16/2015,Love this place always very good service and food. I chose this over that dump Earls tonight. If im going to be paying for something I better enjoy it.
Michelle M.,"Miami, FL",245,39,2,1.0,3/30/2014,Last time I was here a huge cockroach walked right across our table. Manager came to apologize and had a busboy wipe down our table with a dirty rag. This place is disgusting.....will never be back again.
Natali D.,"Miami, FL",129,43,27,5.0,7/2/2012,"This is my favorite restaurant in Miami. I LOVE THIS PLACE. Everything i've ever tried is delicious. My favorite salad would have to be the chinese chicken salad, the peanut ginger sauce is incredible, they add some white fried noodles on top that gives it an extra crunch. The fried mac n' cheese is a must!  Last time i went i tried the Hibachi steak, DELICIOUS. they serve it with mashed potatoes and with asparagus tempura.  In regards to their drink menu, a little pricey but they are amazing. I love their blueberry mojito. they serve it with blueberrys inside =) The oreo cheesecake & the red velvet cheesecake are to die for!!!  Definately the best restaurant in Miami, great service!"
Amanda S.,"Miami, FL",36,7,,5.0,12/24/2014,the staff was amazing  great service and the food was o die for  i had the dulce de leche cheesecake and ended up buying a whole cheesecake tot ale home
Svetlana J.,"Acworth, GA",7,162,89,5.0,6/17/2014,"My parents and I came by here for dinner. The service at this location was the best service I have ever experienced OR expected from a Cheesecake Factory. The server tended to the table like a fine dining restaurant- quite impressed. I had the Four Cheese Pasta, my mother had the Fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp instead of chicken (specially requested without any problems, thumbs up!), and my father had the Grilled Pork Chops. The food was outstanding. I recommend this restaurant in this location 100%!"
Lisa V.,"South Miami, FL",20,14,368,3.0,7/22/2014,"Favorites: Avocado Eggrolls, Crispy chicken costolleta, white chocolate caramel macadamia cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake and for brunch on Sunday Montecristo sandwich"
Suzanne P.,"Caguas, Puerto Rico",27,58,12,5.0,4/19/2012,"Five stars! Yayyy! I love this restaurant! This place is just so good from the moment you step in. It never feels like there is a long wait even when they are packed. I have never had a problem with the service even when they are jam packed so A+ to the servers and the hostesses that seat everyone. The food is great and I love that they are always switching their menu. It makes me try new things and there is always at least three to four things that have me salivating (which then causes me great grief since I only have one stomach to eat one of the amazing entrees and plus I have to save room for dessert)... Dessert! The reason why this place gets a five star rating. Their phenomenal selection of cheesecake! Be prepared people because they have not one but two pages of cheesecake flavors. All the flavors are mouthwatering, I always have to play eenie meenie minee moe with the cheesecakes just to pick which one to eat that day. I have yet to find one that didn't leave me begging for more. But I don't like cheesecake...**collective gasp**...besides that being impossible in my mind, (ok ok it is possible, I just really like cheesecake, it's ok if you don't like it.) they have a whole array of different non cheesecake desserts which are sure to appeal to the non cheesecake eaters of the group."
Analys C.,"Miami, FL",106,48,10,4.0,10/24/2013,"I love the skinny options menu, good place, lots of choices!"
Zanoza K.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,5.0,10/10/2015,"huge portions !! I could not eat half))) very tasty !! a lot of people, but served quickly and friendly!))"
Rosaly C.,"Miami, FL",140,13,3,4.0,3/31/2014,"Oops wrote a review thinking it was dolphin mall. Anyways, this cheese cake factory makes me feel like I'm in a different country maybe Italy. Very pretty and quiet. A solid 4 stars from me. The food is the same but it took longer to cook. But pretty nice experience."
Andrew S.,"West Hollywood, CA",638,646,106,4.0,12/2/2009,"I love the CF.  Anyone who think it's just standard bland chain garb is missing the point.  NOTHING is standard, when a restaurant offers such an extensive menu, and everything comes out tasting awesome.  I just don't know how they do it... Yeah, the brown bread kicks ass.  Their menu is so extensive.  My fiance and I always seem to get similar things.   For Appetizers (or we get two for dinner), we love these: 5/5 Buffalo Blasts:  Crispy, fried delicisousness 5/5 Avocado Eggrolls:  Great dipping sauce 4/5 Buffalo Wings:  Yummy 4/5 Factory Nachos:  A mountain 3/5 Spinach and Cheese Dip:  Not too far off from what you'd imagine it to be, but still really good. Salads we enjoy include the: 5/5 Chinese Chicken Salad:  my favorite 5/5 Santa Fe Salad: crispy, crunchy and refreshing 4/5 Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad:  Nice tortilla on the bottom Entrees that we like (although we don't usually eat them) include: 4/5 Lemon Herb Chicken 3/5 Meatloaf:  probably my least favorite of all these dishes.   Cheesecakes: 5/5 The Oreo one... yum 5/5 The Pumpkin and Pecan one was very, very good 4/5 The Key Lime was surprisingly good... I'm not a huge fan of Key Lime 2/5 Adams Peanut Butter Cup Fudge isnt so great. The margaritas are strong, thank god.  I always have a great time here."
Bill B.,"Miami, FL",80,345,6,3.0,5/15/2014,I always have a good meal at the Cheesecake Factory. The place was very busy as well so I sat at the bar. I had the pan seared salmon with angel hair pasta which had great flavor. The portion size was good. The staff and service was very good as well. I would recommend the place.
Alejandra A.,"Miami, FL",397,203,74,4.0,1/9/2012,"Can I just say that I truly appreciate that they now have a ""skinny menu""...I stopped going there because the portions where so incredibly huge it was just ridiculous but now with this new small menu, they have redeemed themselves. Now, if they could just do the same for the cheesecake portions---WOW! but I don't think the world is ready for a normal slice of cheesecake. It was total chaos though. 40 min wait, dash to steal a table at the bar, kids running around everywhere, it was so dang loud we could barely hear ourselves talk. tsk tsk tsk.. Here is the worst part..can someone pls tell me wth happened to the presentation of the avocado egg rolls? If I didn't know what they tasted like, I would have sent them back. White Chinese noodles on a white plate and a poorly cut hot mess I got! Come on people, get it together- food attracts through the eyes...Thank God they are so good otherwise I would have though twice before diving in. Our server was real pleasant, always checking up on us, quick to help and that is a must. Whenever I go back...I must remember- lunch only! or better yet, I can make those egg rolls and that cheesecake at home."
Tiffany B.,"Waldorf, MD",6,6,,5.0,5/23/2014,"The food is always good, and the service is great. Even on busy days we are usually seated within minutes. Our waitress Colleen B. Was awesome!"
Mark H.,"Monterey Park, CA",367,25,,1.0,10/28/2013,"Waited for almost 1 hr, for my food to come out.  When I asked for the waitress to check on my food, she tells me, ""i'll check when i have the chance.""  My Garlic Noodles come out melted together in one huge mushy clump.  I tell her that I can't eat this because its disgusting, so I reorder. Which takes another 30 minutes for my food to come out.  This restaurant gives a bad name to the Cheesecake Factory."
Shairy G.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,21,,3.0,8/28/2014,"As with any Cheesecake Factory, the food is quite tasty. They have an extensive menu that will satisy any appetite.  Their drinks are delicious. However the service at the particular location is hit or miss. Ive dealt with extremely rude servers. Luckily their parting words usually go to the tune of cheesecake,  so thats always nice."
Tricia S.,"Overland Park, KS",8,85,,1.0,6/27/2013,"Hmmm....why did I go here? Moment of weakness? Probably.  Their menu looks so tantalizing, but in reality the descriptions are always better than the food!!! I have to remember this, so I will save myself some money!  I can make better lettuce wraps at home, so that is what I will do next time!  This place is SO OVERPRICED and the food is always below average."
