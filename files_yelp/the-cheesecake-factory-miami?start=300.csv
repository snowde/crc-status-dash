Joan S.,"Seattle, WA",15,139,12,1.0,12/15/2013,"i hate to give bad reviews - but what is going at that restaurant we were one of the first to walk in, we got seated immeidately  it took our server maybe 5 minutes to greet us,  went over the menu with her,  -here is what she did wrong 1- breakfast not correctly made,  bagel hard as a rock 2) took forver to get a second cup of coffee- i thought aout getting it myself-  even getting water was hard to get. 3) she picks up the bagel- goes to another table with the bagel, puts it on their table, takes the order, and now i have to wait another five minutes to get a toasted bagel..... really? 4) i think the server cassandra needs to be re-trained  extensively.  the bill came to 35.00 and i did not want to tip her but i did 10% :( server slow, food not that great, waited for coffee too long mananement start reading yelp!!! their are a lot of new restaurants in dadland mall. you are losing the battle... joan miami & seattle resident"
Jennifer M.,"Miami, FL",27,25,24,4.0,9/16/2011,"Cheesecake factory is an awesome choice if you want a superb dining experience and are will to pull a little bit of money out of your pocket. First of all, be sure you understand that it is almost impossible to go there and not have a three course meal. Im typically one not to order apps, desserts, and coffee; but their menu is so huge that you just can not help it!!!!! Service is great, and the restaurant is very clean. It does get a little noisy during peak dining hours because they get so busy. Also, if you do not sit in a booth, the tables can sometimes feel a little close to the pont where you want to pitch in on the peoples conversation next to you. but overall its amazing and pleases dont forget to order cheesecake before you leave!!!!!!!!"
Gabriela D.,"Miami, FL",1,4,1,5.0,7/15/2015,I had a dinner date with my mom and we had the most wonderful waitress named Jessica T. She made the visit worthwhile and it is her that truly makes this a five star review. I'll be asking for her next time!
Nicolas B.,"Miami, FL",8,15,,2.0,7/12/2015,"I dined here Friday night with 7 other people so we were a party of 8, we arrived around 10:00 PM and there was a bit of a crowd but we could see a few empty tables. The hostess said ""I don't know how long it will be, check back in 10 minutes I need to ask my manager"" (how unusual) meanwhile every other group that walked in, even a party of 5, were seated immediately. So after 10 minutes I went back to the hostess and asked for an update and she said ""I haven't asked my manager yet, please check back in 10 minutes"" by that point I was very annoyed. Another 10 minutes go by and finally we had an answer, I don't understand why but it was 30 minutes. By that point it was 10:30 and a lot of people were leaving. After 30 minutes they said ""we're setting a table for you"" they were literally waiting for one table to get up so we could sit there, meanwhile there were plenty of open tables, the waitress finally showed up to the table after about 10 minutes of being seated and by that point we were ready to eat so we ordered our meals when she was taking our drink order. The food came out in a timely manor and it was tasteful as Cheesecake Factory always is. However, I will not be coming back to this location. It was my first and only, I will be going back to the one in coconut grove as I have before."
js r.,"North Miami Beach, FL",0,14,,3.0,12/4/2013,"I came with my husband for dinner. We ordered the chicken quesadillas as an appetizer and those were fresh and delicious! My husband ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and that was also good. I ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich and I was not happy with it. It was missing the bacon, and the wheat toast was dried out and not edible at the crust, so I just tore those pieces off. Also there was not enough turkey in the sandwich. I told the waiter that they forgot the bacon and asked if he could get me some. He said sure. Later when we asked for the bill, we were charged $4 for a side of bacon. When I asked the waiter why we were charged for the bacon when my sandwich didn't come with the bacon in it, he said that The Club didn't come with bacon. I had to show him the menu where it showed bacon in The Club. Anyways, it was just kind of an annoying experience..."
Lizette Q.,"Miami, FL",60,72,18,4.0,8/6/2011,"Cheescake Factory a Cliché? Well some might say that Cheesecake Factory is a cliché given their populartiy and convenint  locations at most major malls. However, even with its cliché, popularity and always packed restaurants, I  love Cheesecake Factory. Cheescake Factory offers something for everyone. Their portions are always heafty and priced accordingly.  They have numerous options and their selections are sure to please everyone.  Everytime, I've gone I have received great and efficient service.  Their desserts/cheesecakes are delicious and there is not one that I have tried that I have been dissatisfied with. Overall, Cheesecake Factory continues to be one of those places I will always go back to."
Tricia K.,"Miami, FL",165,478,683,5.0,8/10/2013,"Okay, guys you know I am always complaining of poor service but man, I have to give credit where credit is due when I have great service.  A great server really makes everything so much better!!!  Our waitress, Melissa, really nailed it tonight!  We were a large party of seven with lots of demands.  She took our drink and appetizer orders immediately and got them to us right away.  Our entrees came perfectly thereafter.  We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and had brought our own ice cream cake.  Melissa took the cake out 1/2 hour before it needed to be served and brought us plates, spoons and a knife in hot water so that the cake would be easier to cut.  She was on task and on time with everything!  It was almost unbelievable how good the night turned out, especially on a busy Saturday night at the Cheesecake Factory!  Thank you Melissa for making my daughter's birthday extra special!  Oh!  Have the hibachi steak with the mashed potatoes!  The potatoes are soo delicious!!!  It's big enough to share if you get appetizers and want room for dessert.  The Oreo cheesecake was delish too!!!  We all know that the food here is not gourmet but I'm soo happy that I had to give them 5 stars!"
Jose P.,"Miami, FL",78,20,6,4.0,5/21/2013,"Me and my girlfriend come to this place at least 2 times a month. The ahí tar tar is really good as a small appetizer if you go with a bigger group the fried calamari are perfect for sharing. As for the main course you can't go wrong with a burger, but if you want something a bit different the chicken Romano and the shepherds pie are really good. Things to avoid are the burrito, the fish tacos which are incredibly bad, the pasta with sun dried tomatoes is Bland. On most days the services is great but like everything if you go enough times you are bound to have a bad one"
Hoilda B.,"Hialeah, FL",56,102,126,4.0,2/26/2012,"I must say that this is the best Cheesecake Factory I have visited. We were told the wait time was 35 minutes but 20 minutes later we were seated. The server was very polite and helpful, took her time to answer our questions about their new skinny menu, which I may say it's great. The food was very good and my daughter's Oreo shake was the bomb.  The managers stop by our table to make sure our service was good. I think more restaurants should do this more often. I mention to my husband that even the girl that brought our food to the table made sure we were set before she left. Yes it might be a little loud but who cares when service and food are great. Overall I recommend this Cheesecake Factory and will be back."
Lyn B.,"Miami, FL",1,67,5,5.0,4/7/2015,"awesome brunch!The food was delicious, Huevos rancheros my favorite. great service"
Cecile S.,"Miami, FL",172,225,208,5.0,2/16/2011,"Wow Cheesecake Factory my favorite! I really mean it. I work across from dadeland mall so I tend to go during their lunch hour, which is still busy, but easy to get a spot at the high tables.  I wish I could say I typically order the salad(Chinese Chicken Salad or Cobb!! Yumm). But with so many great things on the menu I can't do it. We usually get two appetizers or an appetizer and a meal to share since the portions are huge and we do unfortunately have to go back to work.  My favorites are the Mexican egg rolls, avocado egg rolls, chicken quesadilla, factory nachos, and the sweet corn tamale. They have also added small plates. I've had the pizza and its a decent size and really tasty. As for meals I love the chicken madeira, chicken and biscuits, baja chicken tacos, vegetable pizza, and chicken piccatta. I haven't really gone for their meat dishes.  Dessert: Snickers Cheesecake hands down takes the prize,  but at this restaurant when is their ever space for dessert? I have also had a seasonal mango cheesecake that was fantastic.  Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything you order everything is awesome! I've always had great service very quick and on point. Thank you cheesecake factory for making my taste buds jump for joy!"
Cara N.,"San Diego, CA",34,123,9,4.0,2/28/2014,My favorite things at this popular chain: avocado wraps and Thai chicken lettuce wraps. So good.  Key lime cheesecake too. Lots of food so you can share. Menu is huge. There is something for everyone.
Will R.,"Miami, FL",5,24,,5.0,4/8/2013,I have been coming to this location since forever. I always seem to leave pleased and they do a great job of running such a large restaurant with a huge menu. The selection is ridiculous and you can come here everyday of the week and not get bored. Great for large parties and special family events. Usually a small wait on weekends. Brunch on Sundays is great. My favorites:  Jambalaya over Rice or Pasta Louisiana Chicken Pasta Burger Thai Lettuce Wraps & Godiva Cheesecake!!
Caitlin C.,"Miami, FL",14,25,5,2.0,2/27/2012,"While I'm a fan of the food at The Cheesecake Factory, the service at this particular location the last time we went was pretty pathetic. It was so packed with people waiting for tables that even the waiters had trouble moving around. We weren't allowed to be seated until our entire party had arrived (fine...) We had to give up our table. When everyone was ready, the hostess (don't know her name, but she had about a pound of dark eyeshadow on) promised we would get the next available table. Then she seated a different group and refused to acknowledge her mistake. She got pretty snappy, which I thought was incredibly rude, but that's Miami for you, I guess... We won't be returning to this location anytime soon."
Damon R.,"Miami, FL",1,3,,5.0,4/24/2014,Best cheesecake factory ive been to and i heard they have a cute whiteboy for a fry cook ;D
Cristina G.,"Miami, FL",9,33,10,1.0,12/14/2014,Today I went to cheesecake factory for an early birthday dinner with my fiancé. I was so excited to eat here because it is my favorite restaurant but unfortunately it wasn't a great experience. Once we sat down we waited about 15 mins before anyone came to even take our drink order or say hello. Then we ordered an appetizer. Again about 15-20 mins before the waiter came to take our dinner order. Then we asked when our appetizer was coming and he said he was going now to get it. About 20 mins later our dinner came out and yet the appetizer never came. So we had to cancel it which was a disappointment. We never got refills on our water. The best part of my dinner was the dessert at the end which took 30 mins to come out. Then we were given the wrong bill and had to wait again for the waiter to come back and ask for the correct check. I just wish that there would've been some sort of apology for forgetting us the entire time we were there. I never thought that at a restaurant we needed to be searching for the waiter the whole time in hopes of being noticed. We are very disappointed and I hope it never happens again. I would love for my experiences here to always be pleasant because now I feel like we paid for bad service.
David V.,"West Flagler, Miami, FL",255,8,,3.0,2/18/2014,Cheesecake factory is one of my old time favorite restaurants. Its been almost over a year since ive been to one. I went with my friend to try out the one in dadeland where i literally had to wait 1 hr. They mixed my dinner order. Didnt bring butter for the bread and the meal it self was a disappointment. I gave it still 3 out of 5 because of my past experience and hope it was just a one time bad experience.
Kathryn S.,"Miami Beach, FL",140,322,64,5.0,7/29/2011,"I don't know how anyone can give this place a bad review. The Cheesecake Factory has pretty much everything on the menu. I don't think you can go and not find something that you'd like to eat. Everything I have tried there has been delicious. From the Fried Mac n' Cheese, to the Cajun Chicken ""Littles,"" everything has always been great. My newest favorite is the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta with chicken and it is outstanding! I recommend it to anyone who likes spicy food. I also make it a point to try a new cheesecake every time I go, and the latest discovery has been the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It is honestly, to die for. One of the best cheesecakes I have ever tasted. It has since become one of my newest obsessions."
