Michelle C.,"Miami, FL",687,975,237,4.0,9/26/2008,"The Sunday Brunch is the really the best thing they do. Their french toast (really french toast on crack) is the best I've ever had. Plain, or with the strawberries and pecans and Chantilly Cream. (It was even better when it was walnuts and bananas and warm apple pieces that they put on top) I'm actually not a huge fan of the cheesecake. Too thick for me. I like a lighter cheesecake. The dinner menu is good, but the portions are ridiculous and I just don't see the point of that. Come with lots of people."
Gregory N.,"Miami, FL",63,190,1,3.0,1/26/2011,"Been awhile since I have visited this place, but my son wanted to go there on a recent visit back from college.  It is located at Dadeland Mall, and parking is ridiculously bad.  Brain dead mall management has annexed even more parking spaces nearby the restaurant entrance for valet parking, so there are lots of empty spaces that you can't park in!  Instead, you have to battle other mall customers for very limited spaces a couple hundred yards away from where you want to go. What can I say about the food?  This place is always packed for some reason, must be the food.  I have never been seated immediately, there is always a wait.   They have a menu with enough items to fill up a season of TV cooking shows.  Even so I have settled in on the Chicken Madeira and that's all I ever order.  It's a tasty invention of boneless chicken breasts with cheese and aspargus served with mashed potatoes.  This last time I went, the mashed potatoes took over the plate as the chicken has been reduced in size, and their corporate policy must be to not let any bare plate be showing. I don't get the cheesecake any more because I want to avoid the calorie overload.  But if you must, you can be assured of a tasty slice of cheesecake dressed up in multiple different flavors or toppings.  Be kind to your body and share a piece with someone so you don't have to schedule a five mile run the next day. Finally, this is not a bad place to go with a group of people, or if you and the family have been shopping at Dadeland all day.  You'll get good service and a wide selection of food options.  And like I said, it's always crowded, so they must be doing something right."
Haronyd M.,"Miami-Dade, FL",228,140,362,3.0,1/27/2013,"Cheesecake Factory is a place that is consistent.  I can always go here and know that I'm going to have a huge meal and good cheesecake.  I can't give this place more stars because I also know that every time I come here, I'm going to wait about an hour for a table.  My favorite appetizers: tex mex eggrolls, avocado eggrolls, sweet corn tamale cakes, and buffalo wings.  My favorite salad: Santa Fe Salad. My favorite meals: Chicken Madeira, Steak Diane, herb crusted salmon. Favorite cheesecake: used to be oreo but they recently changed it and now it's the chocolate coconut cream.  The other great thing about the cheesecake factory is that there is just about every kind of food you can imagine, so anyone can find something they would like here.  Lately, whenever I'm going to have food from here, I prefer to order as take out."
Dubhe M.,"Miami, FL",7,44,9,4.0,9/19/2011,"Oh Cheesecake! Always a Yummy outcome. Here - I come with room in my stomach. Appetizers: Avocado eggrolls, Thai wraps, and Fried mac and cheese - highly recommended! The meals are awesome too; Meatloaf, and Shepards pie are delicous! Don't forget the Grilled chicken & avocado club Yummy!! ... If ur having drinks - their Martinis do justice -2 words "" Ritz or Blackjack :) TIP: Dinner portions easily for two; for no crowds, during the week is best"
M K.,"Miami Beach, FL",162,25,,2.0,1/7/2015,Slow service and tasteless food. This place stays open simply bc of the foot traffic from the mall.
Drea T.,"New York, NY",1,52,2,3.0,8/27/2013,"Cheesecake Factory never lets you down! Always has lots of variety to choose from but watch out with the portions, they are rather large. Not the best quality but still makes for a good lunch. The staff is friendly but a little slow due to the chaos of the restaurant. Its constantly packed and always has a waiting line."
Jackie S.,"Miami, FL",333,332,144,2.0,4/12/2010,"I am not a fan!!!!! After several visits to the cheesecake factory, I have come to the conclusion that the food here sucks!! The cheesecakes are amazing, the service is good, but the food is bland and flavorless.  Perhaps if they cut their menu in half they could concentrate on the quality of food not the quantity!"
Sandra M.,"Miami, FL",56,78,2,2.0,1/3/2013,Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that I actually order a different dish every time I go. However I'm never really wowed by anything. My husband loves their burgers which is the only reason I keep on going back.
Bianca B.,"Miami, FL",8,3,,4.0,3/22/2011,I love the cheesecake factory! Their pastas are amazing! My favorite dish to get there is the Louisiana Pasta with the breaded chicken...LOVEEEE!!! All of the appetizers are delicious and their portions are HUGE! I have to share everytime I go and even have to take half of my meal home! Their prices are fair I have to say that because of this there are certain times when you have to wait a LONG TIME to get seated (this is why they got a 4 star rating from me also the LACK of parking because it's in Dadeland mall...) but I think it's worth it! If you want to have a good time in a nice place with nice service (so far I've only had good experiences) then eat here.  :)
Judy D.,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",2,190,,3.0,1/13/2015,"It's difficult to rate the different food chains because there are so many layers involved.  We had lunch at this location yesterday and it was a mix of food and entertainment.  Thank goodness for valet parking at Dadeland or nobody would choose to use a quarter tank of gas looking for parking.  We were seated quickly, which was somewhat unusual.  Often, we've had to wait a half hour or more during peak times.  Our server was a cheerful blonde gal who seemed to actually enjoy her job.  She was slammed with tables but soldiered on with a smile.  Keep her!!!  Better yet, give her some kind of promotion or bonus!  Now to the food....  We ordered the Caesar salad, tomato/basil pasta and espresso.  IMO, the Caesar has always been good as it's not dripping in dressing which is something I REALLY dislike.  The pasta was cooked al dente and the chicken and sauce were tasty but too oily for my liking.  Something too cheesy and wet killed the stuffed mushrooms for me and hubby's arugula salad was a mess of stems and difficult to get on a fork but it tasted good.  For me and for many other customers, if you guys don't clean up those super slick floors, somebody is going to own a big chunk of corporate, if you get my drift.  Customers shouldn't have to ""skate"" around the restaurant!  A one star for safety/greasy floor issues. A five for service and a 2.5 for food equals 3.  We'll go again as we have for years, unless Nordstrom's bistro is open.  Carry on!"
Marilus S.,"Miami, FL",1,9,,3.0,11/10/2014,"Waiting for the food was kind of long.  They forgot to add tomatoes to the Chinese Chicken Salad.  The Cheesecake Factory is usually better with the service.  Perhaps it was  an off day,  I will give it another try since it was a holiday and they were quite busy."
Kirsten L.,"Miami, FL",12,68,,4.0,5/14/2010,"Been here many many times since Dadeland is ""my mall"". LOVE this place! Took one star away because the floor is always slippery. Why is that?? This seems to be at all Cheesecake Factories I've been to. But some days it's really slippery, and I'd be surprised if they haven't been sued by someone who fell and broke something. Now, of course you gotta have cheesecake for dessert, right? WRONG! If you are a frequent customer like me, please try the non-cheesecake options. The Lemoncello Torte is my new favorite, not as heavy as cheesecake. If you are a chocoholic, their chocolate cake is also to die for. Plus you can take a whole cake home, as they always have a frozen supply. Dangerously tempting!!!"
Keith P.,"Washington, DC",563,629,328,4.0,6/18/2012,"I went here tonight for Father's Day, and the service was superb. We came around 7:30 and were sat in 10 minutes. (There was a Heat finals basketball game on television, so I think that resulted in an empty crowd). I got the chicken marsala, and it was delicious. However, I would have to say my favorite chicken dish is the chicken bang bang and shrimp because of the distinct coconut/peanut flavor. They have some of the best chicken dishes I have ever tasted. The only reason I did not give a 5 was because the table felt a tad bit sticky."
Felicia R.,"Hollywood, FL",155,306,241,4.0,10/16/2012,White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is the best
Mary e.,"Miami, FL",124,204,77,3.0,1/29/2010,"I went there for a late lunch on a weekday.  This is the first time I've been here where I didn't have to wait 45 minutes to be seated.  The place was nearly empty but we still had a 10 minute wait.   After perusing the 10 or more page menu, I settled on the mini Greek salad and the wild mushroom pizette.  Excellent choices, both.  My daughter had the farfalle with roast garlic cream sauce and chicken.  The sauce was delicious but the presentation of the dish was like something I would put together in a hurry. Not worth the $16. For desert, I got the blueberry and white chocolate cheesecake; pretty good, but it had only 2 blueberries in a giant slab of a slice. The service on this visit was not good at all.  The server appeared promptly when we first sat down and from then on made rare appearances at the wrong times. Our lunch took over two hours due to the waiting and waiting and waiting.  Seems like when the place is jumping the service is quick as a whip, but when the place is slow everything takes for ever.  What is that all about? The bus people (I guess they're called?  The ones who bring the condiments and who grind pepper and grate cheese in your dish), were not happy to be there at all and made sure you knew it.   I have been to this CF many times and have always had good food and good service, however today was not one of those times."
Rickie G.,"Homestead, FL",15,133,10,3.0,8/3/2014,This is probably more like 3.5 stars. For lunch or a weekday dinner it's like 4 stars and dinner time 3. The problem is on the prime time dinner hours the place is crazy packed and the food just doesn't justify an hour wait.
Bill V.,"Miami, FL",30,10,2,4.0,6/30/2013,Love the cheesecake but hate the service there. The servers don't acknowledge you when u walk in and they ignore you when your standing in line to purchase cheesecake. I just recommend this place for the cheesecake but not their service.
Andrea F.,"Miami, FL",178,269,63,2.0,11/6/2009,"Overall, this place is all hype.  There are positives, they have a nice restaurant aesthetically and the service is pretty good.  The drinks are good and the drink selection is great.  The cheesecake is amazing (and overpriced). But the food sucks.  There I said it.  The food is bland, chain restaurant garb.  There are a few menu items that are delicious, but less than a handful on a menu with what feels like a million options meet this status.  In fact, that is the exact problem with this place.  You can't be good at Everything.  Keep what you're good at and get rid of the rest (ie 85% of your menu).  Then you'll get 5 stars."
Luly R.,"Miami, FL",46,121,10,5.0,3/8/2012,"So here we are again , one of those lunch adventures and braving the crowd. We were told there was a 20 min wait but thankfully it was way shorter than that. We had a menu while waiting for a table so by the time we got seated we ordered.... Fried macaroni cheese balls, soo yummy , avocado rolls: the best, papas bravas comes with aioli sauce : very tasty and slider with cheese: you can't never go wrong with that . The server was quick and attentive: a plus for such a busy time. We were in and out in less than hour."
Tania G.,"Miami, FL",128,430,324,3.0,10/27/2011,"when i was a young warthog, i used to think the cheesecake factory was the best of the best. now, as a wee bit older warthog, i know better.  don't get me wrong, they have some yummy meals, they're just not 5 star worthy. the bread, as usual, is so good. this time around we had the southeast asian caramel chicken and it was pretty good. our waitress was so unenthusiastic it was almost annoying. on another note, the strawberry lemonade is still on point!"
