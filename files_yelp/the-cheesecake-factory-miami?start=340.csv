Ikam A.,"Miami Beach, FL",81,187,4,2.0,2/8/2012,"Not a big fan. It's a good place to go for drinks and appetizers with friends, but the food is kind of bland and unhealthy. The portions are huge, but what do you expect for those prices. The factory burger is good. The bread is good, the salads are a heaping mess and it took me 20 minutes to find the chicken buried underneath. I used to like this place better years ago. Don't know if my tastes have changed or the restaurant has slacked off, but this is not a favorite place of mine."
Eileen P.,"Miami, FL",62,275,1,3.0,5/10/2014,I won't lie the cheesecakes are delicious but to wait to a seated just takes forever the pod could be better best appetizers are the sweet tamales must try !!!
Jordan N.,"Austin, TX",510,2062,1649,3.0,2/7/2006,"I have to give it four stars based on my one experience at Dadeland's Cheesecake Factory.  Service: BAD BAD BAD. Miami BAD. Food: Better than the Grand Lux Cafe I've had in Houston, so I would give it 3 stars. Maybe 4. Price: TOO HIGH! But for some, it's alright. For me, the prices doesn't really justify it.  What did I get? 2 appetizers. Yup, that's it.   Calamari was good, and with the free bread I received, I made a New Orleans style calamari po-boy out of what I got. :-D  The chicken quesadillas were good as well.  EDITED*** (2nd visit) Best appetizer so far are the avocado rolls!  Dessert: I got the cheesecake with rasberry and chocolate. That was good, although it may be a tad bit too sweet. But hey, it's a dessert!  I probably wouldn't hesistate coming back, but only if someone else wants to go. I would only come here for the appetizers and the apple dumplings (with ice cream please!)"
Martica B.,"Miami, FL",119,39,3,4.0,9/27/2011,"I have gone here twice already. I have only gone to the Dadeland one because its much closer. The service is excellent! Our waiter was very attentive at all times and he was very patient. The ambiance is romantic. The food is delicious!!! I ordered pasta and my fiance ordered a meat plate and we both loved our food - everything tastes different here. However, I do find the price a little too high for the serving size - this is my only complaint. For the price that we pay, I would have liked to have more food. The cheesecake is to die for!!!"
Mari H.,"Miami, FL",6,51,23,5.0,10/17/2012,"Always packed for lunch and dinner but wait is never too long. Has a dish for  every taste bud, Italian, Mexican, Asian etc. Belagio pasta was delish! Can't leave without desert either. Every flavor you can put on cheesecake they have it.  Mango keylime cheesecake was a great end to a yummy meal."
Shenika T.,"Hollywood, FL",114,325,71,4.0,6/8/2012,"I finally found something that taste good on the menu. New Orleans Shrimp, minus the mushrooms."
Megan D.,"Miami, FL",45,84,97,4.0,12/22/2011,"Not much to say that everyone else hasn't...but I definitely prefer this place for brunch or lunch rather than dinner. It's a little quieter and the portions make more sense - so, I mean, there's that..."
Brett H.,"Rochester, MN",68,320,,4.0,5/28/2012,"What can you say about the Cheesecake Factory that people don't already know. I live close by so its easy for me to just walk over and pick up some cheesecake to go. If you are looking for the best cheesecake, its the Godiva Chocolate. However, if you are in the mood for something lighter, then I suggest the Tuxedo Chocolate or Chocolate Mousse. The place is always packed so know that ahead of time. It takes time just to get cheesecake to go. *Added 11/21/12 My recent trip to this Cheesecake Factory warranted an addition to my review and the loss of a star. So while I enjoyed a great meal, I decided to go to the cheesecake counter and get a slice to go. With 5 employees there, I figured it wouldn't take too long. I waited probably 5 minutes before anyone even said a word to me. They never acknowledge my presence. Finally, I asked one of them if I could get an order in and they said the cashier would be right with me. Turns out the cashier was none of them but another girl who finally came back. Now I can understand that they may be busy but here is how you handle the situation properly. If you are getting the cheesecakes ready and you see a customer standing, waiting for service, if you can help him, you do so. If you can't, at least tell him ""sorry for the delay, someone will be right with you"" or something to that extent. DO NOT IGNORE HIM. It really pisses me off when I get poor customer service and I guess I this place, you might run into that."
Christine d.,"Miami, FL",128,14,14,2.0,6/28/2009,"I dont get why everyone raves about this place...  The waitress we had was nice enough... But between the long wait and mediocre, overpriced food, so not worth it.  I find little to recommend here.  The menu is unweildy.  They dont even know what cuisine they're about.  I think this must be made for middle America where they dont have independently owned international restaurants. We're in Miami... Skip it and go to a real restaurant...  (ok, the desserts are pretty darn good!... grab a piece of chocolate cake for take out)."
K J.,"Miami, FL",0,7,,1.0,7/18/2015,"It isn't the food, completely. I ordered sweet potato fries with my meal, they charge an extra buck for, no problem.  They came out ice cold, that's the problem. I told them I did not want replacements and even told the manager after he came to my table. So I ate the rest of my meal. After I was done eating, a side of sweet potato fries arrived at my table, approximately 20 minutes later.  They were hot and good, but I was full, and had asked that they not be made.  Then the bill came, which I paid. Upon looking over the bill, I found that the restaurant had charged me for the sweet potato fries, and when I questioned the server, it was not an oversight. Afterwords the manager offer to take the dollar off the bill. If you think this is about the dollar or the cold fries, you are wrong, this is about good old fashioned customer service and accountability, neither of which this location has."
Kristen C.,"Washington, DC",220,329,12,4.0,9/15/2009,"Yummmmmmmm. Aside from the soggy noodle in my father-in-law's Coke, this place is great!  (As long as it's not a bug or creature of some sort, I usually can get over ""oopsies"" like this)  My sister-in-law and I shared the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta (There's no way I can eat an entire entree by my lonesome!) and my husband and his dad shared the Fettucine Alfredo with Shrimp and Chicken. Perfection.  Both entrees were great. The chipotle pasta was nice and spicy but not overbearing. The fettucine also had a terrific flavor.  OH, wait! We had the avocado eggrolls as an appetizer. SO good. At first, I thought- Hmmm, warm avocados, that's going to be weird - But, NO! They were very good. We topped off our gluttonous meal with a slice of heaven. Or, vanilla bean cheesecake - another menu item that I can't finish by myself.  Good times. I guess the only ""bad"" thing about the experience would be how full you feel about ten minutes later. (EVEN when you share plates! Their portions are ridiculous!)"
Jackelyn P.,"Miami, FL",163,96,174,4.0,3/23/2012,"Always love the food here. The service was great and the Avocado egg rolls are a definite must try as an appetizer. However, i think the red velvet cheesecake is probably the reason I go now. amazing."
Arleen C.,"Miramar, FL",74,276,17,5.0,2/11/2010,"I just loooooove the Cheesecake Factory and we went there on Tuesday night at about 10pm with some friends. We were all tired and starving since it had been a loooong work day. They sat us at one of their wonderful round booths and we had MISSY as our WONDERFUL, GREAT, NICE, ATTENTIVE and AWESOME waitress. We started with 3 amazing Ultimate Margaritas for the girls while the guys had beer, water or iced tea (boring...lol!) they were the designated drivers anyway. We went ahead and placed our orders and they went from white pizza, basil,tomato and cheese pizza, salads, chinese chicken and two chicken romanos. All the orders came out promptly, perfect and totally delicious. Our Margaritas were to die for so we went ahead an ordered two more ""to share"", they were equally wonderful. And, of course, for dessert we all shared the chocolate tuxedo cheesecake and it was mmm mmm good. All in all a wonderful and perfect way to end the night after a looooong day at work."
Fern B.,"Miami, FL",20,75,165,5.0,4/25/2012,"I've been in this place several times, actually is one of my favorites places to eat, for some reason I find this restaurant cozy and nice to be with my wife. Prices and attention in my opinion are very good for its class and if I have to say something bad about it, it would be the waiting time (which after all, is a good indicator that the place is good), but I always say yes to wait, it's totally worthy"
Tom G.,"Miami, FL",6,72,8,3.0,9/15/2011,"I've got to say that we don't really love eating at chain restaurants, and this one is like any other. The food is generally consistently good, however the wait service is like riding a rollercoaster. Sometimes good, sometimes marginal and sometimes very poor. Now here's two things I noted when we recently visited; they have a new 'skinny' (low cal) menu and our young waiter (who claimed to have been there for one and a half years) was the perfect waiter. Although he watched our table when passing he never interrupted our conversation to ask if we wanted something. Sometimes wait staff interrupt you so you think they are attentive. This young man was attentive without being intrusive. He also knew everything on the menu and how one might want to substitute items. We called the manager over to complement him, and the manager said he wished he heard that more often. Hmmm. I guess, well..."
Henry S.,"Miami, FL",0,76,,3.0,8/30/2012,"The food here is good and fairly priced. My only complaint is that you are jammed into the place. Most of the tables are right next to each other, but you will get to know your neighbors.  Between the noise, kids, etc., it's not exactly a relaxing experience. If you don't mind the chaos, it's not bad."
Kaleena S.,"Miami, FL",86,136,2,4.0,4/30/2009,"Ah the cheescake factory,  my solid back up for a decent place to go to celebrate a [insert random thing to celebrate here]. The one thing i can say about this place is come hungry! The portions are huge! and if you come at lunch you might be able to get the lunch special. The lunch special is described as a lunch portion for a lunch price.. but my insiders tell me its the same dinner portion for just the lunch price. Good buy! For almost all of their dishes you can split with some one, if not plan to take home some of it. I love food but ive never been able to finish one of their dishes by myself.  You really need to go with a ""how hungry am i?"" plan when you go here. My food-game plan? i plan on just meal and cheesecake and i take home half of each.  If you like green tea they have a sweet green tea you can get, it comes with mint, so if you can do with out the mint, make sure to ask.  Ah the Cheesecake.... i have gone time and time again and the one rule is everyone orders a different cheesecake. I have been there more times than i can count and i still have not tried them all. Cookie dough, tuxedo, brownie sundae, banana, vanilla bean are some of my favorite regulars. Tip: Always ask if there is something not on the menu, a lot of times the servers forget to mention they have seasonal specials that are just delish. Some seasonal faves that i have enjoyed include  a white chocolate blueberry, and pistachio. YUM! Some ppl think its pricey, i think its fine for the service and food you get. If i dont come up with a plan for my birthday soon ill probably have this place as my back up. Yay cheescake! oh side note: they have pick up so if your just passing by and dont want to eat in.. it may be an option. Also ive heard delivery is available through 3rd party delivery services in the area. UM students love that idea. hehe"
Jessica B.,"Miami, FL",251,257,,3.0,3/4/2012,"Well i have to say normally im a big fan of Cheesecake Facotry but today was different.  Went with hubby for Sunday Brunch and we had their complimentary mutigrain bread which was excellent straight from the oven. Then we started off with the pear and cheese flatbread which was delicious and some coffee that was spot on.  On to the main entrees, I had the montecristo which was not that good, they do it on french toast bread which was soggy and not properly toasted making it not that flavorful as i was hopeing for, the only good twist was they brought strawberry jame as most places give it with raspberry compote and hash browns which were cold, I left them completely.  My husband had the hurvos rancheros which the tortilla(quesadilla) portion to me was horrible.  We then proceeded to go with the pina colada cheesecake which was a first for me on the menu, i defeintely did not like and nor my husband and he usually likes anything sweet, we left a piece of it, that tells you a lot, as most cheesecakes are so good that you have to eat it all.   Service was excellent and atmosphere was great as it wasnt too full since it was before 12.  Defintely will be back but not ordering those plates."
Frank P.,"Miami, FL",0,6,,2.0,6/15/2014,"I went there this morning for breakfast, the place was packed. nowhere to sit and wait. The hostess was rude to my daughter, she had to speak tot he manager. The wait time was unreasonable. I know the food is good but I just didn't get to taste it since I got tired of waiting and left. I am not sure how it went for the rest of my family but I just refuse to wait and then be answered in a rude way."
Alina R.,"Miami, FL",120,148,2,4.0,8/14/2009,"I've come to this particular location a countless number of times throughout the years.  As with any restaurant you've been to many, many times, the service, wait times, and food may vary.  But the overwhelming majority of my dining experiences here have been above average.   One particular draw for me is the varied menu which will satisfy all kinds of cravings.  There is really something for everyone here.  While obviously not authentic, you can come here for Asian, Italian, American, whatever.  I can't even begin to list all the food I've eaten and loved here, but I'll put in some of my favorites:  Thai Lettuce wraps with three different sauces, Fish Tacos, Chicken Madeira...mmmmmmmm. Yesterday, I ordered their ""Weight Management Chicken"" which is a good portion of thinly pounded grilled chicken breast served over a (small) bed of white rice, arugula & tomatoes dressed in a bit of balsamic vinaigrette.  This has been my go-to dish for some time now when I'm looking for something on the healthier side. I also love their brunch, particularly the California Omelet (avocado, garlic, shallots, cheese), and their Belgian Waffles with fresh strawberries and cream. Oh and we shouldn't forget the cheesecake!!  Godiva Chocolate, tuxedo, white chocolate macadamia nut are some of my faves. To sum it up, it's pretty good for a chain restaurant.  The food is tasty, portions are big (except I remember they used to be bigger, if my memory is correct) and I know I'll be back here."
