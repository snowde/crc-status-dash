Adolfo L. F.,"Miami, FL",8,35,1,3.0,6/23/2009,"I've been here. It's OK for being a nationally recognized restaurant. The service is usually good and the food is better than most. I wouldn't classify ""The CheeseCake Factory"" as a ""dining experience"" but I would definitely drop by the place if I'm hungry and looking for a drink. Prices are OK. They are not super cheap but also not the most expensive place you can go. Overall this is just a generic national restaurant located inside a mall. It's not bad... But it sure as hell is not fantastic."
Carlos B.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,9/22/2013,"Second time in a row that we have been back to this place and true to the saying, be prepared to wait! 21 minutes first time, 17 today. Lots of staff walking around but very disorganized. Food (if it ever arrives) is good as everyone knows so it seems that they focus more on this than their service. Being that I'm in the hospitality industry, I look for great service and so when it isn't given (second straight time), its clear that it's a huge management failure!! Failure to train properly, to staff correctly and/or to correct these errors when brought up to their attention. Lets hope this management team takes this as constructive criticism and improve their service to the level of their food."
Christina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,101,2,5.0,3/9/2009,"I come home from Cheesecake with the best leftovers.  These days I'm feeling even more, if it was possible, like the sad-broke college student that I am, and Cheesecake gives you tons of really good food that you can take home later and it is a little pricey sometimes but totally decent. And the cheesecake, every time, is really everything it's cracked up to be. This past time I went, I got the jambalaya. It really is perfectly spiced. I went with three other friends, and we split the guacamole, which for ten dollars is just avocados and tomatoes and salt and pepper. They give you a ton of tortilla chips...this sort of ""bigger is better"" concept applies to the soda glasses too, cuz why are they so big? But I love it. Service was also really good. Two of my friends had the shepherd's pie. Mixed reviews: N is this tiny skinny New York boy who never ever eats. In the three years we've been friends, I kid you not, I have never seen him finish a meal.  Much to everyone's surprise, N ate the whole thing! He said it was amazing and comfort food and even then he ordered the tiramisu cheesecake (which he ate two bites of. go figure.) The other friend who had the shepherd's pie took a couple of bites and then took the rest home to her roommate. She had the strawberry cheesecake which is good...but it was plain cheesecake with literally three strawberries on it. C had an avocado chicken club (big, with fresh avocado, but otherwise nothing special) and the chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake. Devoured both, and I got to try her cheesecake, which was super chocolatey and delicious.  I had the banana cheesecake, and it's now replaced white chocolate raspberry truffle and the carmel macadamia nut white chocolate cheesecake as a favorite.  Everything came out really fast (I have no idea how they do it) but the wait at the Dadeland one is always silly on a busy night...but you're at a mall, so you can go powershop at Zara while you wait. Good stuff. Five stars, mostly because every time I eat there, I leave thinking I never want to eat again, and then the very next day, I want to go back. I can't, though, or I'd get broke and huge...but it's okay, cuz I got leftovers."
Laily B.,"Miami, FL",2,21,17,4.0,8/13/2009,"I hadn't been to this location in over a year.  The last time I went, the food was not good at all, the service was awful and I stopped going.  I returned recently to indulge a friend from out of town.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the food was pretty good.  It's not the most amazing food ever, but they do a good job.  I had the Thai Chicken lettuce wraps.  It's an appetizer, but it's so large that you can actually make a meal out of it and still have room for dessert.  Other times when I've ordered pasta or some other entree, I just can't even think about having dessert.  Our server was very pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed without being pushy.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Cheesecake was sinful, but a little too sweet if you eat the whole thing. Dislike:  Portions are obscenely large.  Sometimes the wait for a table is ridiculous. Like:  Desserts are on display so you can actually see what appeals to you the most.  Bread basket is awesome..warm and freshly baked.  Iced tea is a passionfruit blend (unsweetened), very fruity and refreshing. Price: In my opinion, it feels like the prices are a little bit high, almost as if they're justifying the humongous portion, which could easily feed 2 people.  So it does annoy me because 1.  You're not always in the mood to share with someone (maybe you want different things).  2.  It's too easy to stuff yourself.  3.  Either you take it home, or it goes to waste."
Scarlette U.,"Miami, FL",24,11,1,4.0,4/23/2012,Easter Sunday brunch and seated within 10 minutes. Gotta love the efficiency of a chain.
David C.,"Miami, FL",55,88,13,4.0,2/22/2009,"Oversized portions, is the first thing I have to say.  You can get away with ordering one plate for two people.  The whole wheat appetizer bread is AMAZING.  So you are left with trying to leave space for dessert if you ordered an entree for yourself.  Plus the fact that you have to have an appetizer.  Best way to solve this conundrum, bring plenty of back up ! Bring hungry folk and chow down. Began with the crispy crab wontons, Fresh Crabmeat Blended with Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Water Chestnuts and Sweet Chili Sauce, they were awesome.  Followed by chicken and biscuits, Breast of Chicken Served over Mashed Potatoes with Shortcake Biscuits, Mushrooms, Peas and Carrots. Covered with Country Gravy.  I could not finish my plate.  Might be due to the fact that I stuffed my face with bread before the appetizers got there...  Needless to say I didn't have cheesecake. Lesson learned split an entree if you want to make it to dessert."
Lisette M.,"Miami, FL",77,18,,5.0,4/15/2009,"This is my favorite restaurant so I have to say, its AMAZING!  The food is great, especially the pasta! There is more than likely always going to be a wait, and they don't take reservations. I think some of them do take call-ahead seating, though. The waiters are for the most part really nice. Most of the waiters seem to be out of state college students looking for a job. The last time I went I had the Parmesian Crusted Chicken which was delicious. I've also had the Four Cheese Pasta which is also amazing! The portions are very big, just as in most of Italian restaurants, you can share it between two people and be more than full.  The dessert... If you go to Cheesecake Factory and didn't have a cheesecake... you went for nothing! The Cheesecakes are spectacular!!! Everytime I've gone I've tried a different one and till this day I have yet to find one I didn't like!"
Rick M.,"Miami, FL",135,140,64,4.0,7/31/2011,"Nothing like  stopping at  this restaurant for lunch or dinner after a hectic day of shopping at the Dadeland Mall.  This restaurant has consistant with good food and service for as long as I can remember regardless of the thousands of people that eat there everyday. My favorite appetizer has to be the fried calamari and shrimp scampi pasta will keep you coming time and again... Yeah, I know that sounds nasty but it's true."
Somtip B.,"Miami, FL",0,1,14,1.0,4/22/2014,"Worse service overall with all the food servers and bartenders. Need a lot of training, how sad because other Cheesecake Factory locations are decent with their services. Brought wrong food for me, not even apologized and made it like it's not a big deal.... Seriously"
Elias G.,"Miami, FL",295,100,29,5.0,9/10/2009,"We come here about once a month, and the service and food are always consistently good. Especially for a place with such a huge and extensive menu, where most items are good. Last night my wife tried one of the new menu items, the tomato-basil pasta, and it was really good. It was light and fresh, and the grilled chicken was tasty, too. Try the pomegranate Mojito, it's excellent!"
Monica B.,"Saint Johns, FL",93,194,82,4.0,3/5/2011,"Well this review will be a short one. What can I say about cheesecake that hasn't been said before? Great prices, consistent both service & food, always a crowd pleaser! Took one star off due to this particular location being a pain to find parking then wait time."
Gracie S.,"Miami, FL",4,52,315,3.0,10/14/2011,"Ehh, it's a chain restaurant. I come here when I'm at Dadeland since I know what to expect. Don't get me wrong, I've never left disappointed but it's not a place I would go out of my way for."
Tessie B.,"Miami, FL",115,257,42,5.0,4/28/2011,"This place gets so packed!!! Went for brunch and got there super early expecting it to be empty but boy was I wrong! The Eggs Benedict were heaven. Someone in our party ordered pancakes and seriously just because they came out about 3 minutes after all the other plates, the manager came over and told us the pancakes were on the house. That always makes a meal better! Only downfall was that we couldn't order mimosa's or bloody mary's since no alcohol served before 1pm on Sundays. Now I know for next time. :)"
Jonathan J.,"Miami, FL",206,50,11,4.0,11/15/2008,OK lets start with this... If you are going on any given weekend night you will have to wait for a while but its worth the wait! What i like the most from here is the Cheesecake and the Mojitos they do a very good job on the drinks all together.  The Food is very good portions can feed 2 people they are very big but very good I recommend The Chicken Crusted Romano or the Chicken Marcella to very good meals! For dessert if you have any room left I would recommend the Godavia Chocolate Cheesecake its to die for!
Terrance T.,"Miramar, FL",7,13,5,5.0,4/8/2014,This is my FAVORITE restaurant! Some people are talking all this hoopla about the fettuccini Alfredo but that is my favorite dish and with chicken it is to die for. Anywho their Reese's Peanut Butter and Chocolate( I love both peanut butter and chocolate) Cheesecake is simply amazing. I suggest you come here
Regina B.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,1/8/2014,"Ok, we all know that the food is good, extensive menu, etc... I have been to The Cheesecake Factory in many places in the U.S, but the service at this location is terrible. I've actually been there about 8 times because it is so close to my home and I like the food. But I go knowing that I won't be satisfied with the service. It's like they just want to get rid of you."
Gustavo A. L.,"Orlando, FL",832,1180,136,3.0,10/14/2008,"I discovered the Cheesecake Factory back in So Cal in Redondo Beach, almost 20 years ago - fast forward to South Florida 2008 and the trip down memory lane reveals an unfortunate downward slide-  They are still pretty good and the portions are still more than what we really need to eat in a couple of days - One full portion of any entree in CF will pack enough calories for 2 or 3 days according the recommended daily allowance from the FDA - Specifically, I think the place can use some brightening up it is a bit dark - the service tends to be decent, with the occasional disdainful waiter especially when they get busy but overall OK.  The Balance is positive but there can really be too much of a good thing.  Try their Pumpkin Cheesecakes in the fall - they are hands down the best."
Ashley G.,"Picton, Canada",0,9,3,4.0,2/12/2012,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake factory.  I must say, I do not care for cheesecake (however I was with my parents, and they loved it).  We went for lunch.  The service was just excellent.  Great food, I had a turkey sandwich which came with a large cesar salad and a clam chouder soup.  I found the sandwich a little bit dry and plain, but still good.  Everything else was quite good."
Maria A.,"Miami, FL",2103,779,1333,4.0,8/23/2008,"There's an old song by The Byrds Turn, Turn, Turn that says there is a season for everything and a reason for every time. And so I must say there is a reason for the popularity of places like The Cheesecake Factory.  Yes, it's a chain, but it tends to give people what they're looking for especially people who don't have the time, money, and energy to constantly search out the hottest, hippest new restaurants or maybe just want to rely on an old familiar standby.  And so for the size of their menu, their prices, their service, and their food. People should maybe look at the positive, the glass is half empty, the cheesecake portion is twice the usual size and sometimes it's ok to head to chain and enjoy a meal."
Emily V.,"Ellensburg, WA",210,347,109,4.0,5/28/2009,"I really love this restaurant. My boyfriend says all the plates are good but not great, but I don't care, I just LOVE it! Out of all the things they have on the menu, we always get the avocado rolls, which is, honestly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The avocados are SO good and the salsa they serve with it is AMAZING!  I love the brown bread they serve. It's so rich and the butter just melts into it. YUMMY! I always get the mango daquiri, which is awesome. Sometimes I'll have the 22 oz Blue Moon, but only sometimes.  Also, they have a Jamaican chicken and shrimp dish that is absolutely incredible! I have never tasted all those flavors combined in that way at any other restaurant.  And, last but not least, the cheesecake. HEAVEN!! We always get the strawberry cheescake because we can't decide on any other (I don't like chocolate, he LOVES chocolate. Complicated, eh?).  And, the service is always outstanding. Never, never had I had an issue with the service.  I cannot say anything negative about this place, except that I have to agree with my boyfriend: even though I love said dishes, I only really like the rest of the menu. I've had better food elsewhere. Still, I loves me my Cheesecake Factory!"
