Nimal N.,"Chicago, IL",0,39,,5.0,11/6/2013,"Really good service and I usually sit at the bar. Eric and Jose are awesome and treat my really well. The food is excellent. I'm vegetarian and they really accommodate me. For example, there is a chili rellano burger, but I do not eat beef, they replace it with veggie burger for me. They make excellent cappuccinos as well and it goes well with desert of course."
Max T.,"Miami, FL",8,32,49,4.0,5/16/2011,We decided to have a quick breakfast at Cheescake this Sunday.  Secret for this on the weekends is getting there between 11am-12pm just after noon it really starts to get crowded.  We ended up sitting at the bar since there were 2 empty chairs on the end.  The bartendars were extremely attentive and I like eating at the bar when possible anyways...As usual the food was great and the portions very large.   We started with the Ahi Tuna Tartar and I had steak and eggs with a side of avocado which was great.  Mich had the vegetable wraps which she said were great as well.  We finished up with the Turtle cheescake which was not my choice by surprisingly good!  I really love this place the only headache can sometimes be the wait so go early.  I have never gone wrong here if your in the neighborhood and hungry I definitely recommend stopping in for a bite.
Alicia V.,"México, D.F., Mexico",24,72,1,2.0,6/18/2008,"The Cheesecake factory is so overrated. Why do people insist on coming here on special occasions? There isn't anything ""special"" about this restaurant.  So your portobello mushroom burgers are good, so what? I can make them at home for 1/2 the price and twice the flavor.  and please... stop contributing to the obesity problem we have in America."
Jorge P.,"Miami, FL",73,54,111,4.0,3/19/2009,"This is one of my favorite restaurants, however, let me warn you that the place is usually pretty packed and there is always a wait.  Having said that I will also say that the wait is worth it.  The food portions are what I call oversize, two can usually eat an entree.   Today I went there for lunch, and after the usual wait got to enjoy a great Portabella sandwich.  I will also recommend the Pasta Bolognese and the Chicken Marsala.  Another good thing about this place is that you can usually go home with some pretty good leftovers.  As far as the service, I must say that even though they are busy the are pretty prompt and accommodating, you just have to ask nice."
Simon P.,"Miami, FL",13,22,5,4.0,3/6/2011,Great place to dine with friends and family. I especially love there pot roast with mashed potatoes and veggies
Laura R.,"Hollywood, FL",2,8,,3.0,6/24/2013,"The food is ok, but the waiting is too long. Next time, I will choose another option at the mall."
Janie L.,"Miami, FL",0,26,1,4.0,8/14/2013,good food and big portions.  they have a high turnover and there is a huge selection to order.
Vicky W.,"Fort Worth, TX",77,47,1,1.0,9/9/2010,"My new fiance took me there for my birthday this week.  I ordered a burger medium well.  It came out medium rare.  I sent it back to be re-cooked to order.  Had to wait so long that my fiance had already finished his dinner and I asked for my re-cooked burger to go.  Told it was correct this time.  Got home, starving, opened package and bit into the burger, and it was so overdone that it was charcoaled and crispy black all over the outside.  Inedible.  Birthday dinner ruined :(  Sad too because I chose the restaurant  for my birthday because I LOVE Cheesecake Factory!"
sarah a.,"Miami, FL",6,41,,1.0,5/17/2010,"Since the other review we revisited. I had a nice chicken marsala and it was more than enough. At first the waitress was attentive, but then we waited and waited for our second drinks and she came with them AFTER dinner. I was floored to find out that 1/3 glass of wine was $9. It definitely was not worth the wait or menu to go back again."
Lola M.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/21/2013,"I understand that servers hate getting large parties of young adults because of the idea young adults don't tip,but as a server you should treat ALL your guest with respect. I went for my birthday and my server was very unhelpful. My table was treated as if it were just a hassle and because gratuity was already included I guess it wasn't worthwhile to provide amazing service. I notified the server it was my birthday he shrugged, and ever after mentioning that It was my birthday several times I guess my table wasn't worth a handclap and song that we literally had to ask for. I love cheesecake but after that experience I will not return . People want not only great food but great service as well. It's always a plus to keep in mind you never know who you're serving."
Valentina A.,"Miami Beach, FL",71,107,94,2.0,12/28/2009,"The food here has really gone down in quality since it first opened some years ago. The menu tricks you with all these amazingly described wordly gastronomical dishes, but when it is brought to your table, the food does not live up to expectations.  In fact, I think the MSG flavoring in all the dishes gives some mildly annoying side effects like bloating and headaches. Most of our party of 9 felt the same.  The cheesecakes remain the best around though, especially the Godiva, but I'm rating the restaurant since most people go for the food.  I'll pick up my cheesecake to go or have one at barnes & nobles next time I'm in the mood for some."
Tiana F.,"Miami, FL",10,143,10,4.0,3/9/2012,"this place is a machine. always packed, plates are huge. been coming here for years and service is always good, sometimes due to high volume a little slow. if you sit at the bar area, then do so and avoid the table wait. the godiva cheesecake is my fav. and the my fav appetizer are the avocado eggrolls. all very healthy you know ;). I am a fan of their drinks, apps, and desserts, but not a fan of their wait sometimes. that's good business tho. also, place is loud of course and great for kids and families."
Samir V.,"Miami-Dade, FL",19,35,19,1.0,10/11/2009,"This chain sucks.  This is the same as eating at Friday's, Chili's or any other chain that sucks.  The ONLY thing I can say is good are the avocado rolls for appetizer, and the cheesecake.  Other than that, this is probably one of the worst places in the county.  You want a good chain restaurant go to Bonefish Grill."
Kristie C.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,5/6/2014,"I usually love eating here, but I had the worst experience when I found a curly black pubic hair in my pasta. When things like this happen, managers usually get involved and try to compensate for their mistakes. After I sent the food back, the manager came over, said sorry (not sincerely at all), and asked if there is anything else I would like. He made it seemed like he was ready to give me something on the house due to the situation. We asked for a cheesecake to go in hope that I would gain my appetite again later on in the day. When the check came, we noticed that they didn't charge me for the pasta that I didn't touch, but they did charge the cheesecake and everything else. Im all for paying for my food, but it's extremely annoying to deal with deceiving people who act like they are going to take care of something when they are in your face, and then not go through with it. The manager completely made us feel unimportant. We weren't looking for him to not charge us for an item, but we did expect it after the horrible ""apology"" he delivered. I really feel like he was more sorry that I spotted the hair than anything else."
Gloria G.,"Miami, FL",2,11,,3.0,1/8/2012,"Excellent service, best salmon salad &  highly recommend guacamole. Not intimate but more suitable for lunch or happy hour than dinner. Try their blue cheese stuffed olives that they stuff there for a treat"
Luis P.,"Miami, FL",0,10,,5.0,3/6/2010,"Cuando tengo ganas de comer PASTA este es mi lugar preferido!, en verdad este lugar me encanta... los platos son abundantes y preparan la pasta como unos campeones!"
Robert W.,"Miami-Dade, FL",0,111,188,5.0,9/10/2009,"Been here many times. It is very consistent with all the other Cheesecake Factory locations. This is one of my favorite restaurant chains serving good food, large quantity at a good price. Good service and they have an incredible selection of cheesecakes and cakes. I tend to get the cakes rather than cheesecakes as I feel the cakes bring more for the same price. If you like this but want something slightly more up scale, you can try Grand Lux Cafe."
Paul S.,"Miami, FL",2,53,,3.0,3/6/2009,"The food here is pretty good and the servers are usually very good and professional.  I have eaten here many times and have only had one bad experience where the waitress completely forgot about us.  Other than that, the service has been good.  I completely agree with the other reviews that the portions are much too large.  I usually get an appetizer or a salad and that's plenty of food.  Either that or share. Their coffee is very good but they charge a lot for it, I think.  Their desserts are very rich.  The pumpkin cheesecake available in the fall is really yummy. The crowds and the waiting time to be seated are ridiculous at times.  There are many times that I look at the crowds and go someplace else to eat.  I hate waiting for food, no matter how good it is."
A F.,"Miami, FL",0,34,,3.0,3/2/2014,one of my favorite restaurants but the service in this one is horrible and never go there on weekends they always mess up my orders. the one in coconut grove is much better.
Diana L.,"Miami, FL",21,95,,5.0,9/23/2008,"I love Cheesecake Factory! The food is good and the portions are pretty big. I always have a good time here. They have a variety of foods for basically every taste and the service is good all the time. The only negative part about this restaurant is the wait time, it tends to be pretty long and they don't accept reservations."
