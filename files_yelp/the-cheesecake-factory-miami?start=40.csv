Vanessa P.,"Miami, FL",3,18,8,1.0,9/6/2017,Service was quick and waiter was very polite and knowledgeable.The quality of the food vs.  the price was questionable though. My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken alfredo pasta and an order of cheese pizza. Pasta sauce was very watered down and the pizza tasted like it came from a chucky cheese. The food was expensive and of low quality. Not worth it.
Beth M.,"Miami, FL",25,8,1,1.0,7/28/2017,Food cold and service very slow. I will think twice before returning. Don't sit at the table outside in the mall. They forget about you. Too bad they turned a nice Friday night into a frustrating evening.
Lauren V.,"Miami, FL",174,19,8,4.0,6/7/2017,"Can't go wrong with Cheesecake factory! Literally a bible of food. I never make it through the whole menu but I always try something different and yet to have a bad meal! Can't even get me started on their cheesecake list, I always eat one there and take one because I have to savor every bite!  Jorge R. Has been my server many times and he is always on point with recommendations because I never know what I may want to try next!"
Steve H.,"Miami, FL",1,71,,5.0,4/22/2017,"I wasn't sure whether I should give four or five stars, because The Cheesecake Factory is not perfect, but it's so much better than most local joints, I felt five stars were justified. What can I say about it? It's The Cheesecake Factory. It has about ten million dishes and fifty different cuisines, and all the recipes are excellent. They prepare everything very well. When was the last time a restaurant served you pasta al dente? The Cheesecake Factory does it. You can have Chinese. You can have Mexican. You can have Italian. Got a party of people who can't agree on what to have? Take them to The Cheesecake Factory. Everyone will be happy. The last time I went, I had the pasta with shrimp and sausage. The sauce was wonderful. Very balanced. Lots of character. They didn't skimp on the butter or cheese. The lady who grated even more cheese on the pasta wasn't a miser, either. I hate it when they give you half a teaspoon of cheese and then stare at you, like you'll tell them to stop if they embarrass you. The Cheesecake Factory doesn't play that. They bury you in cheese unless you stop them. They also served fresh bread. A nice chewy sourdough and some kind of sweet brown bread, with butter on the side. Very nice. Can't beat it.  I've eaten there many times, and I've never had food or a mixed drink that was not excellent. The down side: parking is horrible unless you want to walk, and you WILL wait for a table. That's the price you pay for consistent quality. The atmosphere could be better. The restaurant is very busy, so sometimes you really do feel like you're in a  bustling factory. If you hate huge portions, you can order lunch portions. Very helpful. The lunch pasta I ordered had over a thousand calories, which is more than enough for a sane person. My companion had the dinner-sized spaghetti and meatballs, and I could barely see him over the top of it. The cheesecake is very good. Mine is much better, but then I have to cook it, whereas The Cheesecake Factory will cook it for me and bring it to me. If you don't mind a busy setting, a wait, and a bit of noise, this place will make you very happy."
Nathy M.,"Homestead, FL",0,29,5,1.0,5/5/2017,My food was completely burnt and my boyfriends was cold. Our server would disappear from time to time. It was hard to get a hold of her.  Never coming again.
Angela A.,"Coral Gables, FL",109,4,2,5.0,5/22/2017,"My daughters and I went here for a Mothers Day lunch. The wait wasn't too bad, but it was also 11am. It seemed to be getting crazy when we were leaving. We had the Honey Truffle Chicken and it was AMAZING. All 3 of us shared it and still had leftovers, that's how huge this thing was. One of the best batters I've ever had. The service was fantastic. And I know sometimes servers get frustrated when one of their 3 tables ends up not ordering a lot....usually means less tip. But you wouldn't have known, she was so attentive and nice. She got a 40% tip for not making me feel cheap  (really I just didn't want to carry around leftovers) It was an overall great experience"
Sonia E.,"Miami, FL",0,8,15,4.0,4/22/2017,"Love their menu!!!!!!!They have a little or everything and are willing to accommodate your order in chases changes can apply. Turkey burger, spicy cashew chicken, fried mac and cheese, corn tamales, thai lettuce wrap are amazing!!! I can keep on going. Oreo and the salted caramel cheesecake are to die for. Recommend for big and small parties. They have lots of variety!!"
Karen M.,"Seminole, FL",28,1,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Usually one of my favorite places to eat, this was one of the worst dining experiences ever! The food wss bland but that was the best part of the visit.  The noise was terrible and the majority of it was coming from the wait staff and kitchen. They were yelling and goofing off. Our waiter screwed up our check so we tried to find him.  After about 15 minutes we flagged down another server. She took off looking for our waiter. Another 10 minutes probably went by before I had to get up and go find her. She was all flustered saying that she couldn't find a manager and that our waiter had an emergency. Finally, a young manthey said was the manager came up to the table and we explained the situation for the fifth time. He was very unprofessional.  He was wearing a necktie around his neck but not around the colored shirt. The collared shirt had two or three buttons undone. Anyway, he finally fixed the check for us and explained that our waiter had been in a fist fight with another employee over a female staff member. All in all we probably spent an additional hour waiting for them to fix their error. It was astounding to me that the manager would let the employees behave in this manner. The kitchen crew was unbearable. They were singing and dancing and yelling and the manager was standing right there. He had no control over his employees at all. I will never go back to this Cheesecake Factory!"
Sabrina G.,"Miami, FL",107,3,,5.0,2/1/2017,"Amazing food and fantastic service by Kevin.  Farfalle pasta cooked to perfection, and to finish our meal with the amazing Godiva cheesecake.  Thanks to Kevin for our quick and great service."
Alana A.,"Miami, FL",583,358,893,4.0,11/9/2015,"This Cheesecake Factory is very good! I've never had a negative experience other than the wait times. This place gets packed and there's no calling ahead or making reservations, so just be patient and wait it out. Waiting has become more comfortable now ever since they expanded the restaurant and put more benches in the new waiting area.  Now onto the rest of the experience.... The food here has never disappointed. I've had a variety of things and have come with lots of different people and everyone is always very pleased with the food. On my last visit, I tried the Crispy Cuban Rolls ""snack"" plate as what I thought would be an appetizer, BUT it was more than enough to fill me! Be aware that the portions are proportionally huge (for a snack, it was a pretty big plate; don't even get me started on how humongous the entrees are). The bread of course is also amazing. I had a drink at the bar once and it was also very good. However, I usually have the strawberry lemonade and it is SO good!! If you're a lemonade lover, you will NOT be disappointed. It is very sour and sweet -- it's an absolute ""must"" every time I come here! Service is always absolutely excellent. The restaurant and its restrooms are always very clean as well. If it wasn't for the long wait times, I'd be coming here a lot more often."
Jana K.,"Miami, FL",5,42,318,4.0,3/11/2017,A great restaurant. We did not have a reservation and were seated in less then 10 minutes. The food was excellent and our server was very friendly. She recommended some appetizers that were really good. Will be back!
Jorge L.,"Miami, FL",26,13,42,2.0,3/10/2017,Arrived @ table 5:50 no service till 6:01 so denied happy hour menu prices by server & manager because of their slow server.
Stephanie S.,"Miami, FL",63,236,262,3.0,12/19/2016,"Had lunch here this past weekend with my aunt. The restaurant looks like any of their other locations, nicely decorated and packed of course. The restaurant was clean and orderly, and the service was good. Our waiter was very attentive. We started off with some cocktails, I ordered the mule, which was awful. A good mule should have a decent amount of ginger flavoring in it, whether it be ginger puree or ginger beer. This drink barely tasted like ginger at all. It tasted like tonic water with some seltzer. I then ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. It is located under the small plates, appetizers section, and boy is it small! The amount of goat cheese given was a joke, and the beets were cut up into tiny little cubes, very disappointing. As my main plate, I had the thai wraps. This was delicious. It is fresh lettuce leaves, cabbage leaves, grilled chicken, cilantro, carrots, bean sprouts, and 3 sauces. You build your own spring roll. Very light but filling. I loved it. The chicken was flavorful, and the peanut sauce and chili sauce were so yummy. I do not recommend ordering this though if on a date, because it is very messy lol."
Rachel S.,"Miami, FL",23,15,1,2.0,1/15/2017,"Disclaimer- never been a huge Cheesecake Factory fan, however this visit was by far one of the worst I've had. My dislike has always come from the value perspective. Way too many dishes that they seem to heighten the prices, but nothing they serve is any better than what I can quickly make at home or get at another casual dining restaurant for 2/3 the price. What sent today's visit downhill was the service. I don't expect to wait over 10 minutes for a server to come to my table, yet I did today. It was then another 10 minutes to get water at the table. Knowing how slow everything was I told the waitress the additional requests when I placed the order (mayo for a burger, parm for the pasta) yet nothing came with the food and again 10 more minutes after, so it was almost useless. Definitely not a place trying to earn my business- go elsewhere with all the options now available at Dadeland! I would have given it one star but the waitress was courteous- I'm assuming they just are given too many tables. If I had the time I would have asked for a manager, but who knows how long that would have taken."
Janna R.,"Miami, FL",1,8,13,3.0,3/2/2017,"If you request modifications to your meal, check when the food arrives that they followed your simple instructions. They tried to offer me a salad for my trouble. Yeah cause that's what I want, a freaking salad when I ordered a burger that they couldn't remember to take off the onions. Glad I only ate a quarter of it and noticed. They took it off the bill as I was so irritated as I have not eaten all day and the only thing I ordered came screwed up.  I'm not allergic, thank God. But I can't help but worry for my friends who do have allergies.  At least they didn't screw up my boyfriend's food and the waiter was nice. It was the kitchen that screwed up. Proceed with caution, especially if you have allergies."
Ana Maria R.,"Miami, FL",32,15,,3.0,6/29/2017,The last few times I've been to Cheesecake Factory I've had the same problem.  The plates are very hot but the food on them not so much.  I had lukewarm food.  It's a pet peeve.  The taste is good but it just ruins it for me.
Rotem K.,"Washington, DC",676,90,35,5.0,11/6/2016,"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Cheesecake factory never disappoints :) This time I had the veggie burger - it was a bit too oily, but still great. My waitress was very nice and kept on filling my glass with coke :)"
Mathew M.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,1.0,11/6/2017,"Really?!? you hope I give you another chance. Your question is as out of touch as you are obviously as manager. My wife and I both work, we took the time to come in to your restaurant in order to celebrate our anniversary and it was a shit show. I will never come back and will tell as many people as I possibly can of how poor he service there is!"
Ratchel D.,"Miami, FL",340,419,737,3.0,8/3/2015,"Had an ok experience. The Cheesecake Factory used to be my favorite restaurant growing up, now, I feel like the food and service can go either way. There is always a wait, weekday or not, and it is just a bit too packed and loud for my taste --depending on mood. This last visit went just ""ok"". They walked us over to our table, to find that it was not been whipped down or set. Bread was not offered, turns out that for lunch ""one must request it"". Ordered a vegan salad, dressing was a bit overpowering but ok, overall. Shrimp dish was a bit overcooked, tasted ok, overall. Had cheesecake to go, and that was pretty good.  I don't love it, but I also don't hate it."
Adriannan N.,"Miami, FL",1,11,10,3.0,2/14/2017,"When I first arrived the setting seem kind of lazy, the plates and the folks, and knives were laying out there on the table, and of course they looked kind of dirty. Not dirty as in filth but dirty as in it looks like when they washed them they let the water sit on the silverware and you could see the water stains. In all the other places I went to they had the silverware wrapped before giving it to you and never let a plate sit out in the open like that. We had the crab bites-- It was so good it was gone in 1 minute.  My dad had a huggeee bowl of chicken and shirmp gumbo with rice, it cost like 17 dollars so I was hoping the bowl would be huge. He said it was good. I had fried catfish, mashpotatoes, and a tiny bit of green beans... That catfish was the best catfish I have ever tasted, it was SO buttery and soft. The only downside is that it was not enough, but I paid like 18 dollars for that so it should have been at least two pieces. I also had the nutella cheesecake to go, it tasted pretty good.. But I think the traditional taste better."
