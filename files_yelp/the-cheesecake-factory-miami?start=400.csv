M L.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,3,,3.0,2/23/2012,"This used to be one of my favorite places, but i just dont think the food and prices justify the wait time and service.   Slowly over the course of time the service and food  has gotten worse.   Their cheescake is still the best, if you can  manage a weekday escape for cake and coffee without the wait."
cindy w.,"New York, NY",118,462,148,4.0,4/8/2007,"This is my local Cheesecake Factory and, for good or evil, I have to say that it performs well  for what this chain delivers: 1. Diverse range of food. It's the only restaurant I know whose big menu doesn't translate into sub-par offerings. I know that their Italian pasta dishes will be pretty decent along with their Tex-Mex, Southern, Asian dishes.  2. They are open relatively late, ya.  Till  12:30AM, Friday-Saturday! In the Dadeland area! If I am too lazy to venture far, this place will do when I have some free money to spend, especially for luxe take-out. In the  Gables/S.Miami corridor, the only things that late that are open are Dennys and TGI Fridays (yech). Hey, who wants some pasta carbonara or chicken-biscuits with some cheesecake to go? Hells yeah. 3. The wait staff are no worse then the service you'd get at Miami Beach, in fact, I think they are not that bad, perfunctorary, and look, the long waits are because it's CHEESECAKE FACTORY! There's a reason for the long waits, they do decent grub -- anywhere in Miami on a weekend night, you're going to have to wait for service anyway."
Santi C.,"Miami, FL",16,114,6,4.0,6/4/2010,"So I was with my girlfriend, brother, and friend and decided to go out on an adventure for food. We had no idea where we were gonna end up but hopped into the car anyway. As we're on our way to kendall I suggest cheesecake factory and everyone's faces lit up. As we walked into the place, I felt like we were going to have to wait forever but were only stuck with a 20 minute wait. I can live with that. As we sit down, they bring us our bread and drinks and we begin to look through the menu. The menu that has over a million (not really) options. This is going to to take a while. 10 minutes later, I decided on the shepards pie and my brother and friend got the da vinci pasta. They were both extremely good. For appetizers we got edamame, onion rings, and some rolls. I don't suggest the onion rings. They weren't crispy enough for my liking. When we were done we got the white chocolate caramel macadamia nut cheesecake and I was super excited to eat it. I might get shot for saying this but I was kind of dissappointed. I expected a lot more from the dessert, seeing as the name of the place focuses on it. Oh well, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this restaurant.  Good service Good food Good prices Extensive menu A bit loud Decent wait"

Monique H.,"Miami, FL",91,20,,3.0,3/29/2012,"The ambiance, food & location of this facility is enchanting however they could use much better work on their service quality. I came in today during lunch with 7 other of my coworkers for a birthday event & we already knew our orders & requested to put them in prior to coming as well as leaving credit card info to hold our reservation being that we only had an hour lunch & we were denied the service. The woman on the phone said she couldn't do that & that we would be served & seated promptly which was NOT done causing us all to rush through our meal we couldn't finish in time & caused us to run late on our commute back only a few minutes away from this location. If mom & pop restraunts can accommodate their customers in this fashion, than a larger commercial one should far exceed that ESPECIALLY if credit card info is placed as a deposit in the event the party doesn't show which is NOT what transpired."
Marc H.,"Key West, FL",0,16,,2.0,8/19/2012,"Took the family after a long day of back to school shopping.  It was pretty crowded but while the kids waited in the waiting area my wife and I sat at the bar and had cocktails because we were told it would be about a 45 minute wait.  The Sour Apple Martini's were more Sour Apple than martini, way too sweet for my liking.  After about a 30 minute wait our buzzer went off and we went to be seated.  However, the hostess had us down for a party of 2 when we were actually a party of 4.  The exact same thing happened to a party of 4 behind us.  After we had given up our seats at the bar, we stood waiting for an additional 30 minutes.  We should have left then.  Once we were seated out server was pleasant and efficient.  The Tuna Tare Tare appetizer was very good but our entree, Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp had no ""Bang"".  It was too sweet and was very ordinary.  Most definitely not worth the wait.  I don't think I'll be back to The Cheesecake Factory."
