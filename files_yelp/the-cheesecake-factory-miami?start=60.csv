Jack L.,"Greenville, SC",22,535,342,3.0,6/15/2016,"Visited in April 2016.  I went here a while ago with a coworker while we were training together. I was not in a good mood going into the restaurant (Miami has a tendency to do that) so I may be a bit biased and jaded in this review. I have been to the CF in Pembroke and have always been pleased.  The service here needs significant help. We pulled up to the bar, and it was hard for the tender to provide any service. I guess she was busy supplying the whole restaurant with drinks so she was unable to take care of us. Our drinks, water and alcoholic, remained empty for the duration of the night. The food was solid, as it mostly is, but the service needs help.  Parking is an absolute joke. It looks like this ""mall"" was built in 1920 when only 10% of the population had access to a motor vehicle. There is no parking anywhere and if you find a spot, consider yourself lucky. We arrived at 5:30 pm and the only available spots were occupied by the racket known as ""valet parking"". Makes me sick.  I wouldn't waste my time with a visit here or any other restaurant in this shopping complex due to parking and overall inconvenience."
Ana H.,"Miami, FL",34,26,45,5.0,2/6/2017,This place is always full but you wait just a few minutes and they will find a table for you and your group! The good is the best!!!! Any plate you order will be delicious! The amount of food is good enough! I love eating here on the weekend with my family! When it's the time to chose a cheesecake for desert it becomes a hard time because they all are amazing!!! Recommended 100% it will be with it every penny !
Andrew J.,"Miami, FL",100,1,,1.0,8/7/2017,There was sticker on my banana which means they didn't rinse or inspected these bananas before cooking. And server was quite rude.
Gaby R.,"Miami, FL",232,140,394,5.0,12/5/2016,"Can never go wrong with Cheesecake Factory! Their menu is so extensive and they have a little bit of everything to satisfy everyone's cravings. If you're craving Italian, American, Japanese , almost anything  they have some of each cuisine which is what makes this place so great in my opinion and no to add it all taste amazing too ! Everything from a burger , to a salad to their pasta are all so good my favorite appetizers however are the avocado egg rolls and the corn tamale cakes , both so so so good !! I love the chicken Romano and he orange chicken from there as well ! Ofcourse can't brag enough about their brown bread , it's the best and they bring you as much as you want , even to take home if you want some, all you have to do is ask! Service is alway awesome when I go too , and after they opened up the patio area and extended the outside for more seating the wait is no wher near as long anymore , actually haven't had to wait the last few times I've gone . And being that my favorite dessert is cheesecake I can't pick a favorite because they are all amazing , but snickers , pumpkin and Oreo one are top 3 !"
Memi C.,"Miami, FL",7,52,47,4.0,12/20/2016,"Haven't been here in 10 years , this time around , I can honestly say that this time around , everything was delicious , not so much of a pasta person , so went with the herb salmon , it was so delicious and full of flavors . Staff was friendly and there was no wait which was a plus !  Will be returning here"
Sabrina A.,"Miami, FL",15,72,148,4.0,6/29/2016,I love Cheesecake Factory  never really had a bad experience here. It's a great place for dinner there's options for everyone . My favorite dish there is the kale salad and chicken costeleta omg delish. The miso salmon is also amazing. And the brown bread is my favvvvv. The staff here is very nice compared to the aventura location  One thing I must say about Cheesecake Factory and I'm talking about ALL locations something I find so weird is the fact that the floor is soooooo slippery. In everyone I've been to.  Must go!
Amy B.,"Miami, FL",70,120,166,4.0,6/23/2016,"I am not a chain person and it's not often a chain gets 4 stars from me, however, we went here for a birthday celebration and had a wonderful evening experience.  The cheesecake is located inside the Dadeland mall, off of 88th towards the middle of the mall.  We had a group of ten and pretty much got seated right away. The waiter was friendly and very quick with drinks and food.  Our group sampled many items including the Mac and cheese hamburger (was ordered well and arrive a red medium) several pasta dishes and a kids pizza. Except for the mishap with the cooking of the burger, all were made to specifications (no cheese or extra bacon, etc). The pizza was surprisingly big for a kids meal.  We all know he stars of Cheesecake Factory is the cheesecake, and ours did not disappoint. White chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake is my favorite, but the Godiva and the Hershey chocolate bar cheesecakes were tasty as well."
Adriana V.,"Pinecrest, FL",4,47,19,3.0,6/6/2017,Do not order take out they make you wait about 30 mins and the service is awful it's just a shame
Kelly-Ann D.,"Miami, FL",86,2,2,1.0,7/7/2017,Dadeland Mall Every time I have gone to this location there is an issue the first time it was cold food the second time my mom had broken glass in her drink today I had hair in my food and I was offered a replacement who the hell wants to eat after they almost ate someone else's hair. Danny was the manager
Mimi P.,"Miami, FL",1,50,4,1.0,6/16/2017,"The wait wasn't long despite of it being packed. Once seated I noticed our utensils were dirty and there was food under the table. We requested  new utensils and to have someone sweep under the table. Once we got our food,  my shrimp was burned and the pasta was cold! I did  have my food  replaced, but it wasn't any better. The service was ok despite of the waitress that didn't do much to accommodate us. Oh, can't forget the prices- this place is overpriced! Terrible.. Needless to say we won't be retuning. Time to replace it with something better! I left Hungry, I'm disgusted! I wish I can get my money back. After all , I left the whole meal."
Alex V.,"Miami, FL",361,169,22,5.0,4/19/2017,I used to work here and I still love the food. They always keep it clean and they have such a wide selection that you will find something you will like. Didn't really like working here but love eating here lol Renzo is the best. Thanks for the great service!
Bill D.,"Miami, FL",59,14,2,4.0,6/24/2017,"Ubered to the Cheesecake Factory in Dadeland Mall last night because of the recent closure of the Coconut Grove location.  The bright spot upon arrival was seeing Brent a bartender form the Grove  Cheese.  The place is massive compared to the Grove and lacked a certain vibe that the Grove Cheese imbided.  Brent more than made up for the lack of personality the  Dadeland location has compared to the Cocowalk Cheesecake.  He is professional, attentive, and a major reason we will "" Uber"" back there soon.  He is a definite positive addition to that location."
Eugene D.,"Miami, FL",154,32,1,3.0,7/15/2017,"Ive been to This place since the day it opened. They sat our party quick but it took 20 minutes just to get water  and an hour and a half to get our food last night. We ordered 3 Appetizers and   2 soups and they came 3 minutes before the entrees. Tables around us were ""flipped"" twice with different guests with the same waiter.   They were nice to us and we didnt even request to speak with a manager. Oh and the beers took about 30 minutes. Very disappointed after being a loyal customer. Ultimately 3 hours being there was too much."
Destiny N.,"Miami, FL",0,11,6,5.0,12/16/2016,"I went here on a Friday for my birthday celebration and to sum it all up- it was an awesome experience. I read previous reviews and expected a long wait especially with the weekend rush, but surprisingly I got lucky and was seated almost immediately. Our waiter, David, was so friendly and patient with us throughout the evening. I ordered the Classic Burger with a side of fries (it was sooo good). My hunger was already satisfied (I stuffed my face with bread before the meal), but what's a birthday dinner without dessert? I have a peanut allergy so I'm thankful David informed us that every cheesecake has a trace of peanuts. Therefore, I decided to get a slice of Linda's Fudge cake. They decorated a birthday plate for me and sang happy birthday. I need to describe this delicious slice so you understand the awesomeness: chocolate chip frosting with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and sprinkles on the side. Need I say more? Overall, it was a great night and thanks again to David for a fun and chill birthday dinner."
Amber E.,"Homestead, FL",0,1,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Let me just say this, I LOVED the Cheesecake Factory until this experience I just had. I am absolutely in shock about how my service was, my server Cameron was very rude and didn't seem to care about my gluten allergy at all, he did very little to help me find food that's actually gluten free and when I asked him if the bread was gluten free he responded with a sarcastic remark. Through my dinner I hardly saw him and actually had to get up to find him. That being said I won't be returning to the dade land location again and I'll make sure my family and friends will not  either."
Maggie R.,"Miami, FL",19,4,3,5.0,1/8/2017,Very good brunch green chilaquiles & the sweet corn Tamales very good I recommend these two for brunch
Jana A.,"Miami, FL",20,63,438,4.0,9/5/2016,"Doing some shopping so decided to have lunch w the fam, ordered from their small plates menu and it was just perfect. The only thing is that the did not have any high chair available for the kids, kind of weird that there was none available. I love this restaurant but not a fan of cheesecakes, ai always ask for the black out cake, it is amazing."
Raul David A.,"Miami, FL",1,4,,1.0,7/3/2017,"This Cheesecake Factory really sucks. Don't waste your time and patience coming to this resturant located at DeadLand Mall.. We signed up at arrival for a Table for 4 people in the outside area and after waiting for more than 30 minutes, and looking and more than 4 tables right there available, the frontdesk representative just pissed me off saying that the table will be ready whenever they say so..  Monday 3rd at 4:15pm.. I complainted about this situation and they didn't really care about.. If you don't want to receive the poorest service of your life and piss your life off, then just avoid this place!  - 45 minutes later I asked to talk to the Manager, and he apologized by this situation, but 20 minutes more to ger somebody at our table.. Manager name: Daniel"
Heidy A.,"Miami, FL",0,5,,1.0,6/3/2017,I just place an order to pick up and it's awful!!!! I came here before and it's fine but if you're going to place an order to p/u just don't do it!!!! I ordered steak Diane with mashed potato and guess what the steak is not what i expected and came without the mashed potato. What a night
Roger V.,"Miami, FL",278,1,1,1.0,8/20/2017,"I usually don't call people out for poor service and even worse customer service especially with what is going on in society now a days, people have bigger fish to fry! I am honestly blown away at the total lack of any customer service @cheesecakefactory today! I was in the biz for many years and understand that mistakes are made and people have bad days. I was on hold for 17 minutes to place a pick up order. I actually arrived at the restaurant while still on hold when the manager picked up and I was standing next to her. At this point the manager did not offer any type of apology. She took my order and arrived about 20 minutes later for takeout. No apologies from the manager or the staff. No sense of urgency or customer service. I did not expect a free meal but did expect some kind of customer service from not the only the manager but the staff. It's simply ridiculous where customer service is now a days. I still know people that work at this location and nothing against them, but it's extremely poor management period! #thecheesecakefactory #poorservice #nocaring #lackofcommunication #totaldisappointment"
