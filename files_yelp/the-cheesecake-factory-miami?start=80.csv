Jonathan F.,"Miami, FL",1,12,,4.0,2/18/2017,"Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake? You know I love to go there. Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere. This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney."
Harold C.,"Homestead, FL",26,2,6,3.0,6/8/2017,"I love this place when it comes to cheesecake but the food is not so great . The service is good during weekdays but for some reason not so great on the weekends , maybe because they are busier on the weekends"
Karen V.,"Miami, FL",0,8,,1.0,5/27/2017,THIS DESERVES LOWER THAN ONE STAR BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT ISN'T AN OPTION! The service is horrible! The food is mediocre! The waiter was missing half of our food and it took two hours to receive our food!! Not only that but it took so long for our food to come that we barely had time to eat because the valet was already closing!! I will never be eating at this location again! How disappointing!!!! They hadn't even started on the fish tacos so we canceled or order. And my husband had to eat off of my plate !!!
Michael A.,"Miami, FL",35,8,3,1.0,2/25/2017,"I came to this location with my wife because we had a 25 dollar gift card and we have generally had good experiences with each visit. The food and service has always been good. The location at Dadeland was a horrible experience and my wife and I don't care to ever go back to a Cheesecake Factory. It took about 20 minutes for the waiter to even notice that we were sat down, after which we were already frustrated seeing people being sat and immediately helped. Then the manager asked us if we would move because he needed the table for a larger group. Once the food arrived (hibachi steak), which took a while, the meat was burned on the outside and the vegetables were still raw. I've had the dish before and it was nothing like how it was before. Overall it was a frustrating experience and mediocre food."
Allison M.,"Miami, FL",0,12,3,1.0,8/5/2017,"where to begin... my family and I have been coming to the Cheesecake Factory for as long as I can remember. I've been to many locations around the U.S and never have had such a disappointing experience here at the Cheesecake Factory In miami, dadeland mall. First I want to say the hostess don't know what they are doing. They completely over quoted me when it wasn't even that busy and had my family and I wait over an hour and a half for a party of five adults. We finally got sat at a table which the floor around it and under it and the sliverware were completely disgusting and filthy. When our waitress arrived, we told her about the sliverware and he didn't say anything just grabbed it all and left. She came back with another set of sliverware and took our drink order. She was then gone for about 15mins while we were waiting. She came back and took our order for appetizers and we also were ready to order our main courses aswell. We ordered Nachos with chicken, Avocado egg rolls and the sweet corn tamale cakes, it took 25 mins till it finally hit the table. Our main courses hit the table 10 mins after we got our appetizers. The server didn't let us know and communicate what was even going on throughout the waiting process. On top of that all our main courses were cold. The steak my sister ordered was suppose to be medium rare and it was well done. She had to wait an extra almost 20 mins for another steak to be prepared. The manager Linda wasn't helpful at all so we asked for another manager because she had such attitude. Dora stopped by the table and was completely careless and said sorry, offered a cheesecake at the end but it was never granted to us. The servers in the restaurant just hangout around the computers talking and on their phones and neglecting guest around them including our server. My family and I couldn't be more disappointed. We ended up paying full price for everything when it all was a complete disaster. This place will go down hill just like coconut grove did. The most disappointing thing was the service. Our server Pearl didn't not care about our experience nor her job. Never coming back here."
Alexa S.,"Washington, DC",0,5,,1.0,5/26/2017,"I ordered the ALMOND-CRUSTED SALMON SALAD. Here is how its described on the menu: Pan Seared and Served Over Kale, Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Arugula, Avocado, Quinoa, Cranberries and Radishes. Tossed with Our Vinaigrette. Here is what I got- it was more like salmon lightly sprinkled in almonds with a bed of kale. I couldn't even find the brussels sprouts and there was absolutely no arugula. The avocado equated to about 5 bites, there were 4 slices of radish, about 5 cranberries, and a spoonful of quinoa. Considering the description, I expected more than kale and salmon with a few garnishes. I would have complained had I been in the restaurant, but I ordered it to be delivered though another vendor."
Nasha W.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",45,453,281,4.0,12/26/2014,"Cheesecake factory  offers consistent quality of meals each time we go :-) this particular  location is very crowded and busy so goodluck squeezing I  through the door and finding the line to check in.  My go-to plate is the thai  lettuce wraps. They are absolutely delicious and do not make you feel terribly full afterward. Try your wraps with the peanut sauce, yum! On this particular visit our waiter was very helpful. Although he seemed very busy he still tried his best to help us with what we needed and with a positive disposition.  I recommend  eating here on a weekday at earlier hours otherwise prepare to be pushed and shoved out of the way by fellow patrons. They have got to figure out how to make the check in process more efficient because right now it's a mess."
Juliete R.,"Miami, FL",1,11,,1.0,5/23/2017,"Aside from this location, I've also attended the Dolphin Mall and Coral Gables Cheesecake Factory. I assumed this restaurant was going to be exquisite because of all the competing food spots around. I ordered a chicken alfredo pasta which only came with six small squares of chicken. I also ordered a frozen strawberry daiquiri which had a small shot in it, you can HARDLY taste the alcohol; only all the way at the bottom of the drink. Definitely won't be coming back"
Ivonne F.,"Hialeah, FL",28,8,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Our waitress Carla was very nice, food tasted good except my husbands side alfredo pasta, it was just boiled fetuccini no oil, butter,salt NOTHING! They brought two entrees first the next two 10 minutes later side pasta 15 minutes later so much for having dinner together. No, i don't think we are coming back to dadeland's cheescake factory any time soon."
Silvia O.,"Miami, FL",46,20,17,5.0,1/8/2017,I have been coming to this cheesecake factory since it opened and today the chilaquiles were awesome. I recommend there brunch on Sunday's it is great!!!
Yanelys M.,"Miami, FL",42,8,13,5.0,3/29/2017,"As usual, place was packed. It as well worth the wait! Loved everything they served. Their pumpernickel bread is the best, the calamari and fried cheese, to die for. Highly recommend the combination dishes, great value."
Marta R.,"Miami, FL",42,80,419,4.0,10/12/2016,"Food is always good,  but portions are smaller and price is still as high. It's become pricey!  Our server though,  Jesus B,  was awesome!  Skinny sangria was ok,  super expensive!  Prices are challenging because I haven't seen the restaurant full."
Vee W.,"Laveen Village, AZ",12,48,34,4.0,3/24/2017,I love The Cheesecake Factory. We are staying at the Marriott across the street from here so we decided to eat here. Service was great and the food was wonderful as always. Only thing I would say is that this place gets really packed so be prepared to wait a bit especially on the weekend. One downfall though was the size of the pieces of cheesecake. They have gotten really small for the price but I guess that the way it goes.
Mickey C.,"Miami, FL",0,30,11,1.0,9/15/2017,"I have been to most Cheesecake Factories in Miami in one time or another. The waiters and the food is pretty much almost the same at all locations. Unfortunately this review is about their front of house staff. I cant say anything good about them because they will have you waiting for 15 minutes for a table for two people on a non busy day when there is plenty of tables available. Next, we wanted to sit on a booth for two and instead, the lady sat us next to a loud family of six. Where we were so crammed up in a corner that their shopping bags were crushing me. Completely unfair. Then our waitress comes after 10 minutes of us sitting there and ask her if we could move to the booth for two people right in front of us that was available and she says ""idk you have to go to the front and talk to them."" What kind of response is this? This is YOUR JOB, you go talk to your coworker, I PAY YOU. YOU WORK FOR ME. This is part of being a server. I decided fine, I go up to the front and the lady acts confused and decides that she doesnt want to understand that I want to sit at another table. Then makes me wait all over again when I already waited and then talks to other people. We walked out of this restaurant. No service. No real food. Disgrace. Do not come here."
Taina T.,"Miami, FL",58,4,1,3.0,4/26/2017,The food at this location was all right. I ordered the chicken Madera and I was completely unimpressed I'm not sure if you guys change the recipe for the sauce but it was definitely not what I expected. I ordered a bloody Mary from the bar extra spicy and was given a regular bloody Mary I ordered a second one extra spicy and was given a regular Bloody Mary. All and all drinks were ok food was ok. I would say a good spot to go after church on Sunday.
David D.,"Miami, FL",40,4,,5.0,4/22/2017,"Always a pleasure to dine here. A;ways good service the food is great. Crispy chicken costaletta is a family favorite, we always share it because its so massive. As for the cheesecakes, mmmm worth every penny. Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple is the best in existence."
Monica F.,"Miami, FL",0,9,11,5.0,4/15/2017,"The good was absolutely delicious. Our waitress was extremely sweet, smile on her face the whole time and super attentive. I wish I remembered her name. Entrees were the four cheese pasta with chicken, really yummy. Hubby had the salmon with mash potatoes and asparagus. He usually has salmon when we got to a restaurant and he said this salmon had been the best he ever had. The dessert was also delicious I asked the waitress to recommend which one of the chocolate selections was the best and she recommended the Hersheys one it really was wonderful we also tried the Natala one which was also very good. We haven't been to the cheesecake factory in a long time and it was our first time visiting the dolphin mall location we will definitely go back again and we hope to get the same waitress we had this time she was excellent"
Bernardette S.,"Miami, FL",950,177,357,1.0,10/29/2016,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I placed an order for pick up. Called to see the status of my order and was left on hold for for over 27 minutes. We waited 30 minutes to pick up the food, attempted to speak to the manager they had us on hold once again. Only to finally get our food with no apology. I was extremely disappointed."
Sabrina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,1,,4.0,4/1/2017,"Drinks were so so,  I ordered a classic margarita and it tasted like juice. But our waitress Jessica  (who is  ) suggested a Mai Tai  and I still wasn't please but made the best of it. Now my appetizer  the crab dip was delicious. I ordered the Jamaican pepper shrimp and it came out cold, so I returned it. I then ordered the NY strip and that was delicious. Overall the food was ok. We stayed mainly because of our waitress Jessica. She was a blessing. I I'd like to mention the manager Steve who also helped out."
Ernie E.,"Homestead, FL",3,9,14,1.0,8/20/2016,"Just WOW! It is amazing the HORRIBLE service we've encountered here today! BAD,BAD,BAD!! Waiter, in lah, lah, land!  I am a local coming to this place for a long time, since Dadeland mall has grown and hence Cheesecake Factory has gotten busier the service and portions have DECREASED!  I had the shrimp sandwich! It is  stated on the menu as ""lots of shrimp""! Huh!! What!? Are you kidding me?  Literally (5) small shrimps in the whole sandwich? PLEASE DO NOT MISLEAD consumers, say it like it is! If it doesn't come with lots, then say so! That's all. Last time for me! That's for sure!"
