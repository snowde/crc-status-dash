Charlene L.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",166,91,321,5.0,10/6/2017,"I've decided to start trying chain restaurants to see if they are the same or similar in quality.  Like In & Out Burgers!  They are trained to be worker bees all the same Personalities dedication to work and great. I really only had one bad experience and from that point on I really have enjoyed my meals and the environment overall.  I really appreciate the different kinds of menus. They're over 2 or 3 menus. I love their skinnylicious menu well of course cheesecake menu and their regular gianormous menu. I think it's important to have options for everybody and in your family. Making it a wider selection.  I've Gone to many other cheesecake factory restaurants. The one in La Jolla and San Diego was maybe a 2 overall food and experience. The one in Irvine spectrum was OK, but our server was on spot. I choose to go to Mission Viejo location because I find their food drinks and service to be superior. Today we decided to go have lunch in the mall and of course had lunch at Cheesecake Factory. I ordered off the Skinnylicious menu. My lunch was a turkey avocado sandwich. Served on a round soft bun with turkey tomato and avocado. I ordered onion and it had mayonnaise on it, which I believe was a light version. I put my bacon on the side. The sandwich came with a side salad tossed in a tangy balsamic dressing.  Very enjoyable, great flavors. I  will be ordering that again.  My friend ordered their Crusted Parmesan Chicken dish.  To be honest he gets that all the time.  It's a great meal with 3 or 4 - 1/2 chicken breasts. Pan fried with very light gravy.  Order extra gravy on the side to use on the yummiest mashed potatoes. Also the meal comes with green beans. I prefer my vegetables a little softer if you want them crispy or ask them to be prepared differently.  The chicken is moist and flavorful. Pan seared with parmesan cheese and breading which they have a layer of gravy on the bottom.  Of course he ordered their strawberry lemonade which is dipped in sugar on the rim and always a second one is ordered.   Overall a very pleasant experience. Located perfectly in Mission Viejo mall where you can shop and eat. Our bartender Oscar as always is on his game and is a wonderful bartender and server."
Heather B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,20,5,2.0,12/20/2017,"Ordered from them, via Door Dash. Was not as pleased. I hadn't had Cheesecake Factory in years. But, would have expected food to be as good as it used to be.  Unfortunate."
Kailyn S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",1,2,2,3.0,11/15/2017,"So far I have been waiting for 45 minutes on a Wednesday night. The worker at the front gave me attitude and informed me that it had been ""38 minutes"" . Of course they don't wear name tags, so i took the photo. I come to this location every year for my birthday, never have been this disrespected and treated so poorly. Think it's time to find somewhere new. I raised my score by a star only because our waiter was phenomenal!"
Megan H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",19,195,327,3.0,11/12/2017,"I ordered from the Cheesecake Factory on Grubhub and chose the Skinnylicious shrimp spring rolls. I was expecting at least 4, but when the food came I opened the box to a measly 2 medium-sized spring rolls. This was my late night dinner and I was disappointed for the amount I paid for. They were delicious, though. The peanut sauce is sooo good. On my most recent visit, I came with friends at 10:30 PM. I guess people like eating late because the restaurant was still bustling at this late hour. We waited 20 minutes to be seated. Our server was lively and friendly and was able to give us each individual checks! I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, Chinese style, from the Skinnylicious menu because the majority of their menu items have a lot of calories. It was yummy-the chicken was tender and it came with my favorite peanut sauce! I was happy with my three tacos for the price I paid. You get free bread, and I am obsessed with that brown oat wheat bread, I don't know why. In general, their menu is pricey. Some slices of cheesecake are almost $10 and unless you order an appetizer as a meal, it's easily $20 per person. I stole some bites of my friends' Oreo and cookie dough cheesecakes and they were quite delicious. Be careful, though, a single slice can set you back 1,000 calories."
SallyAnn M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",31,21,2,5.0,1/6/2018,This place is awesome every time I go here! One of the best food chains around - their quality is consistently very good & excellent service!
Maria A.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",263,682,293,5.0,1/9/2018,"Love this place.  I like coming here because of the consistency of great food and great service, plus it's close by."
Bay M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",186,201,884,4.0,7/19/2017,"Always a good choice. For some reason, this is always the go-to whenever there's a birthday. Not too fancy, but nice enough. The menu is huge, but then again we always go back to our favorites. Food is good as always. Service is always on point (my bad on forgetting our server's name but this gal is so bubbly you can tell she enjoys what she's doing). Ordered their egg roll sampler, their cobb salad, the chicken parmigiana (pizza style - almost like a country fried steak, but topped with an alfredo pasta, see photos, LOL) that was oddly good, the steak with mashed potatoes (good!). Last but not the least... a slice of red velvet cheesecake and a slice of the tiramisu cheesecake - death by sugar but I don't mind once in a while. SO GOOD. But let's talk about that complimentary bread basket, that brown bread though... if I could, I'd probably go to a Cheesecake Factory and just order water and keep eating that brown bread with butter. Forget the entrees and the cheesecake. Give me bread and butter!"
Kathy G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",216,130,478,4.0,12/23/2017,I had the original strawberry cheesecake here and I enjoyed it! It was the first time I actually savored it. It was okay for me but might be too sweet for people who can't take sweets.
Cecilia H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/7/2018,Always great service an amazing food! Today I came with my husband. We ordered the shrimp scampi and pasta with shrimp & sausage!  For dessert we had lemon raspberrie cheescake....Sooo yummy! Our waiter was great! He even came over an let us know he was going on break an would have some else help us. She was great too! I recommend it!
Amber L.,"San Clemente, CA",41,4,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Worst ever.  I got the stuffed chicken tortillas.  The chicken was so dry, it was like jerky.  I basically had some nasty tortilla with petrified chicken.  Some salsa in top didn't help.  Why would anyone serve this??"
Hana S.,"Front Royal, VA",5,8,7,1.0,10/29/2017,"My boyfriend and I had spent the day searching for steals at Macy's and by 7 o'clock, we were starving. He was craving some fabulous American comfort food, or in his words, ""chicken and mashed taters."" I hadn't been to The Cheesecake Factory since high school, but remembered their large portions and mammoth amount of menu options.  Unfortunately, our dining experience was a tremendous let down from the start. We forgave our very tiny table on the patio, but should have left after the hostess picked up my napkin and shoved it under the table leg in a failed attempt to stabilize our dining experience. We waited for about 20 minutes to be greeted by our server who finally asked if we wanted anything to drink. Another 15 minutes passed before we were blessed with water and bread, but still no cutlery, napkins, or plates.  We finally placed our order (calamari to start, followed by two chicken and mashed potato dishes), and crossed our fingers that our poor waitress was just slammed, and that our food would alleviate our already subpar experience.  After our waitress brought us a second basket of bread, I asked if she had by chance forgotten our appetizer. No, but the kitchen had burnt it. After finally receiving our entrees, we were ready to demolish the mashed taters we had patiently waited for! A few bites in, and my boyfriend fell silent, frowning with horror as he began pulling a very... very long hair from the depths of his throat.  We put our forks down and were ready to leave. However, our waitress was nowhere to be found. We sat for some time...until we finally recruited an alternative server to ask our waitress if she could possibly make an appearance at our table.  Our waitress took my boyfriends plate and left. When she finally came back she asked if I wanted my plate to go. I said no, and she again disappeared somewhere between the labyrinth of sticky tables. Luckily, upon her final return she comped our two entrees. Unfortunately she still left us with the bill for our long awaited drinks and calamari.  To be fair, our waitress was a nice girl. My thoughts are that management assigns too many tables to servers therefore they are are unable to adequately assist each party. I do like The Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location is embarrassingly chaotic and failing all around."
Vicki Z.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",32,53,25,4.0,11/6/2017,We come here regularly and normally enjoyed the food here. Our waitress today is very sweet. However the fruit from kids menu is not so fresh today. You can see the grapes were almost rotten.
Jennifer C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",5,56,23,3.0,7/30/2017,"Sunday Brunch at Cheesecake Factory was just okay. We were seated quickly but it took awhile to get our food. The waitress let us know that my daughter's fried chicken was burnt and it would be out shortly. The manager came to apologize and I also told him that my omelette was dry and overcooked and I was turned off. My son ordered the French toast which was hands down the best French toast that I've e we had!!!!! The manager was nice and didn't charge us for the omelet or the chicken sandwiches that arrived late. Lindsey, our server was very friendly and welcoming. Overall the experience was good, even thought we had a few issues. Management handled it well and we will definitely be back.  Oh and the cheesecake is always delicious!!! A must have!!!!"
Alexis S.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",1,31,28,1.0,11/29/2017,"Such a disappointment!! I usually love coming here but the awful service will definitely keep me away. I work in the mall so it seems convenient to place an order to go, pick it up and go but not this time! For starters, I was on hold for ten minutes just to place the order! I was quoted 20 minutes so of course, I made sure to clock out on break at the perfect time. Once I arrived at the restaurant, I waited almost a total of one hour only for my order to be wrong! So now I have to wait even longer for them to correct my order. Once I had expressed my frustration, the manager came out and said to me, ""I'd make this right but i don't want to keep you on your lunch break any longer"" WHAT!? I spent $40 on cold food and horrible service! I wish the manager was more sincere and accommodating. Next time, I'll be sure to go up to the food court, thanks!"
Greg C.,"San Clemente, CA",1,20,2,2.0,12/14/2017,"We were seated quickly and drink orders taken. Waitress promised to bring our drinks and some bread and then take our order. Two hangry grandkids were waiting for the bread that didn't come for nearly 30 minutes. I guess they ran out and were waiting for a batch to come out of the oven. Had to wait for the waitress to come back and take our order and then it took a long time to get our food. Some of us got our meals the rest had to wait about 10 minutes. Food was ok, but my daughter had the egg roll appetizers and got sick when she got home. The cheesecake was delicious and my grandson enjoyed it when the staff sang happy birthday. Granted this bad impression was magnified by the hungry impatient youngsters, but overall it was a disappointment. I am not blaming the wait staff, I think it was more of an issue of kitchen management and I could tell the wait staff were stressed."
Tallie A.,"Orange County, CA",7,180,37,3.0,5/3/2017,"Nt to keen on the dark decor. Its seriously depressing. Lk hauntingly so. Kinda relates to Disney's Huanted Mansion...Idk it jst does. Anyway, wait staff is friendly enough and service is on par. A full water glass is ALWAYS appreciated-thank you for that. Too bad it wasn't so full I cld actually drown myself in it-ys. My date ws THAT boring.  Ordered the steak Dianne. Ws a tad tough. Portion ws enough to feed half of Africa-good Gods! Who eats that much food?! Impressive. I dont even knw wht the hell my date. All I knw is it ws thr one minute-gone the next! I ws lk ""wht the hell? Whr did your food run off to?""  Wine selection and suggestion ws fabulous. Paired well w my entree. Did nt appreciate the seating. Nor did we appreciate an icky sticky table. I hd to fight for the right of my napkin! All and all, Im nt a cheescake lover and doubt Ill return however I wld suggest others gv it a go...maybe in daylight."
Miji G.,"West Covina, CA",54,31,24,4.0,10/17/2017,"Even if there are other restaurants at the Shops at Mission Viejo, it's difficult to say no to Cheesecake Factory. They have everything I want, from appetizers to desserts. I just wish I didn't have to tell the server the same thing twice, whether asking for bread or grated parmesan cheese. For lunch, I picked the lunch-sized Bistro Shrimp Pasta, which is officially one of my favorite dishes. The freshness and taste of the mushrooms, tomatoes, and arugula harmonize with the basil-garlic-lemon cream sauce. The symphony of fresh flavors don't end there because the crispy battered shrimps add that wonderful crunch, texture, and shrimp flavor. I'd order this again for sure. For dessert, I got the 30th Anniversary Chocolate Cheesecake--layers of their original cheesecake, fudge cake, and chocolate truffle cream--and it was the perfect ending to a great meal."
dave b.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Absolutely horrible service and food ! Took 30 minutes to get seated and then 30 minutes to get burned and dry food . Pasta had no sauce on it and the waiter said to me "" I'll get some sauce and you can put it on the pasta "" seriously ? 20 bucks for pasta with no sauce but you will let me put my own on it. Lol burgers were ordered medium and came out like charcoal . They did get the other two meals right so they have that going for them . Manager did comp the three meals but was much more interested in making sure I "" knew they usually get it right"" than anything else . At least she apologized which the waiter never did."
Alexis M.,"Irvine, CA",69,2,,1.0,11/1/2017,"Came in around 10 and there were only a handful of other tables filled. We were seated in the populated area and given menus. We then waited for 10 minutes with bread and no water. Multiple waiters walked past us and saw that we hadn't been helped, but they didn't stop to take our orders. Only two of the tables around us got service, a group of girls and a large family. The rest of the tables were waiting for checks and to order, but no one was getting service. We left and came to BJs and were served immediately."
Chris B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,5.0,11/22/2017,Very nice restaurant! Enjoyed the food and atmosphere! We ordered the shrimp platter and the louisianna pasta chicken. Very good and filling.
Lola B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,21,1,2.0,11/14/2017,"Food was ok but the worst part was the service. Our server literally had 7-8 tables and was constantly running around. She took our order and then brought us refills, without asking because we were on our last bites with no iced tea and she probably felt bad. But that was pretty much our only interaction with her. No checking on our entrees or asking if we needed anything, which we did. The lady manager just seemed to stand in the back, smiling. Being a restaurant manager myself, I know the importance of touching tables and helping a server who's completely slammed. Just a disappointing visit overall."
Victoria C.,"Fallbrook, CA",425,240,177,5.0,6/23/2017,"We just went here. There was no wait. Maybe because it was early for dinner. We opted to sit outside on the patio. It was a lovely evening so this was an excellent choice even though you are technically sitting in the mall parking lot. No matter, they still have it laid out nicely. We had appetizers first. They were Tex Mex egg rolls. These were served promptly. Extremely hot ( not just warm like some restaurants serve). Very tasty.   For the main course, we had a Tostada salad and some sort of chicken dinner. The amount of food that arrived could have easily served four. It was excellent. Great service. We even took a slice of Oreo Cookie cheesecake to my mom.  She said it was excellent."
Howard A.,"San Clemente, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/11/2017,"Normally, I would rate this restaurant a five. The food is consistently good and the well-trained servers very attentive. My problem has to do with the check. We had lunch there Sunday with friends and we gave the server two credit cards to split the check. I like it when the receipt shows various tip amounts. I automatically used the 22% thinking I was leaving a well-deserved, generous tip. As it turned out, the dollar amount alongside the 22% was based on the entire bill. Therefore, I left a 44% tip! When I realized the mistake, I came back, was able to change the tip amount and spoke to the manager. He was not very interested in this issue....which I would call a SCAM. I'm writing this as a warning to other unsuspecting diners."
M J.,"Dana Point, CA",0,42,,1.0,12/22/2017,Absolutely disgusting and overpriced.  Terrible service. The clam chowder taste like carrot sticks with some spoiled milk and clams in it. The Rene special chicken salad was all bread and about an once of chicken salad. The portions were small.  Stay away from this overpriced trap.
Haylea K.,"Bethel, AK",1,22,17,4.0,2/10/2017,Cheap and cheerful. I don't normal eat in chain restaurants but like to try something different every Now and again. The food was delicious and plentiful. Service was prompt and friendly even though I was rude and it was busy.
Hyemi C.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,4,4.0,8/15/2017,"Fettuccine Alfredo was much tastier than we expected. It really had a strong parmesan and butter taste, which I really liked. It was a very pleasant quick lunch fix."
Stephen W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",191,134,169,4.0,1/27/2017,"It was very busy this Friday night and took about 25 minutes to get seated.  The bread was nice and warm and fresh. I started out with the loaded baked potato tots, which were great. They are deep friend with cheese, bacon, and chives baked in with the potato. I also had the chicken potstickers which are always good.  For my main dish, I had a chicken Parmesan sandwich with a side Caesar salad. I asked for extra croutons but there were still very few croutons on the salad. The lettuce also was a bit dry because they were a little stingy on the Caesar dressing. The sandwich was very good, but I think they may have changed the tomato sauce that comes on the side for dipping with the sandwich, and the old sauce was better (or this was a bad batch of the same sauce).  Then for dessert I had the Oreo dream extreme cheesecake which is definitely my favorite. It is so rich and sugary Overall I would definitely come back to this Cheesecake Factory! Good food and good service. Great for dessert as always."
Francine H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",372,201,1524,5.0,3/28/2016,"First time here for Sunday brunch, and it was also Easter! I got here early to get a booth and a high chair for a toddler and a sling for a baby. It was Perfect for us! They went out of their way to get us all set up and comfortable.   I had the crab hash with hollandaise sauce and it was delicious!  We also got the brulee French Toast, and I have to say it's the best French Toast I ever had! Our waitress was so sweet and attentive.  We never felt rushed even though there was a long wait to get in by noon time.  We will all be back, hopefully,  soon! :-)"
Milk C.,"Irvine, CA",947,3,5,1.0,8/7/2017,"Each dish was small and looked off the staff was depressing and grumpy , the humid air made my lunch horrible don't waste your money comming here I get better service at Buffalo Wild Wings."
Claudia T.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",67,17,7,1.0,3/19/2017,Bad service manager put me on hold for a long time. Found plastic in my cheesecake. Would not come back!!
Samantha S.,"Lake Forest, CA",137,5,,1.0,3/29/2017,My friends and I went to Happy hour on the 23rd of March 2017. It was our first time going to happy hour. The first gentlemen who was serving us at the bar was nice. I personally am a bartender and so if my friend so we like to meet other who are nice. We got another bartender in the middle of happy hour and he wasn't so nice. His name was Bryan D and was extremely rude especially at the end when we went to go pay. There was 4 of us and 3 of us had cards. He was very snarky about my one friend having cash and after we paid at the end very rudely told us to let him know (when he wasn't our first server) that if we're splitting the check and then took off cause he was mad. I was extremely pissed and honestly will not be coming back to happy Hour there.
Laura Q.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,16,3,4.0,10/6/2017,"I ordered tonight through deal Dash. And I have to admit that Cheesecake Factory is my guilty pleasure. Usually all is well. I've liked most of what I've ordered but encountered a few fails too along the way. Tonight I got a chicken quesadilla. I've attached a picture of it looking forelorn all by its little lonesome in the plastic box it came in. No garnish at all. Where is the guacamole, sour cream and salsa? It's good but those garnishes are not in the quesadilla, I checked even though I knew they should have been on the side. Fail! Someone put the lid on the container and I'm thinking how the heck did you NOT see that? No, really. How? I got the chicken taquitos too and those were good. Really good. And I got the lemon raspberry cheesecake, which, though I was tempted to just start with that, I haven't but I'm sure it will be, as always, delicious. I'd requested bread and butter as I always do, and in probably 5 orders now, I've gotten it maybe 1-2 times. Not a huge deal as clearly I keep ordering from there.  This is the first time I've written a review for this restaurant. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but the key lime, lemon meringue and lemon raspberry are all delicious and are responsible for me thinking a little differently about cheesecake. I got the Oreo extreme last time and did not care for that at all. But enough about cheesecake. Some other things I've ordered. Chicken samosas. Not good. In fact, really bad. They were actually tasteless. Keep the taquitos, lose the samosas. Crab and artichoke dip, chicken lettuce wraps, zuchinni and steak tacos were all ok but nothing that I got really excited about and likely will not order them again. The avocado egg rolls though...YUM! Tonight is the first time I have not ordered them. They are delicious and I love the dipping sauce. I know I've had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls when I've dined at the restaurant and as I recall they look good and sound good but are a bit of a letdown. I keep toying with ordering them but haven't in a long while. The thing is while I recall not being excited and maybe a bit disappointed in the actual taste, I cannot remember what exactly it was that didn't do it for me. I'm sure I'll eventually order them again and hopefully I'll enjoy them more this time around because they really do sound good on the menu. I'll continue coming back even if it's for nothing more than the avocado egg rolls and lemon raspberry cheesecake. It really doesn't get better than that."
Jules J.,"Newport Beach, CA",23,10,5,1.0,5/28/2017,I got raw chicken on my curbside pick up order! Totally unacceptable! Please check when you order from this place to ensure that the chicken is fully cooked!!!
Julie P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",253,106,78,3.0,8/18/2017,"The food is flavorful and presented nicely. It is predictably good food. The menu is extensive and has something for anyone. The wait staff is pleasant and responsive. The big issue seems to be the wait times. Although we put our order in the very moment the server came to the table for the first time to take a drink order, we still waited over 49 minutes and drank two full large glasses of iced tea.  It appears that they do not staff to the demand. The servers seem to do the best they can, but if management is not staffing adequately it means the wait for a table is twice as long as they estimate because servers cannot take orders quickly enough.  I did not see anyone bussing tables and heard servers apologizing often for the wait times.  It is good that they acknowledge it, but an estimate of 20-25 minutes to wait to be seated was actually 48 minutes, then it took another 8 minutes after we gave them the buzzer to get to a person to walk us to the table and another 25 minutes before the server arrived at the table plus the 49 minutes after the order for food to arrive. A bit more thoughtful staffing would result in a better guest experience.  Clearly it is still a good experience evidenced by all the people willing to wait two hours to have dinner. Try the bang bang chicken and shrimp or the miso salmon which are both excellent.  Plan around the wait."
Jannette P.,"Tustin, CA",0,17,6,1.0,5/30/2017,"So I go to The Cheesecake Factory with my daughter and 2 coworkers for dinner. I ordered the plate which has chicken, shrimp, sausage and rice. I probably ate about 1/4 of the plate (bc they are pretty big portion size for dinner). Finally before leaving, my waitress asked if I wanted a box to go for my food. I said, yes, please. I take it and I get home. Realize that she gave me a very small box with only 2 tiny chicken pieces, 1 shrimp and just the bottom with some rice. Where the hell did the rest of my food go?! I paid a total of $28 for this dinner/ service! Did you guys throw out the rest? Did you run out of larger boxes? Honestly, I've been to other Cheesecake Factory restaurants and they don't throw out your left over food when you specifically ask for a to-go box! Don't come to this location. Just don't!"
Delilah B.,"San Clemente, CA",126,137,294,3.0,2/15/2017,"I feel we always have great food and service here. Chelsea was the perfect server, very attentive and knowledgeable. I always get the chopped chrome salad or the orange chicken is sooooo tasty!"
Maggie B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,44,1,3.0,5/15/2017,"We went here for Mother's Day yesterday and it wasn't great and wasn't bad. As to be expected, there were long lines and the wait for a table was about 45 minutes. After ordering, however, the wait for the food was an additional 50 minutes.  We did get bread, and when we asked for extra, it took awhile too. Our waiter kept coming by and saying something like ""right! Your bread"" or ""it's coming up let me go check"" about 3 or 4 times. I don't know, I just figured they would keep pumping out bread baskets. We asked for the heater to be turned on (we were on the patio) and the waiter said ""sure thing!"" Left and promptly forgot. We asked again 20 minutes later and he apologized and switched it on. He was a really nice guy, but they seemed short staffed for the crowd that was there.  The manager did come by to apologize for the wait but it was half hearted and made it sound like a chore.  Everyone liked the food, except me. The nachos i ordered has this weird cheese sauce on them that had an awful texture and strange taste. I expected just regular melted cheese.. I thought about sending them back but didn't want to wait another half hour for something new. I think we'll stick to the Huntington Beach location from now on. I understand that it was mother day, so this probably wasn't an accurate representation of their day to day operations."
Yurie H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",49,188,218,4.0,8/25/2016,"Came here with 3 of my friends for dinner. It wasn't too crowded, probably because it was a Thursday night. We were immediately greeted by our server, who was super friendly and brought out bread and poured water many times. My friend and I split the farefalle chicken pasta. The portion sizes are huge~ So I recommend splitting with a friend. The sauce was super creamy and garlicky! Love me some garlic and mushrooms~ I was too full to have cheesecake, but my favorite is the 30th anniversary. Super chocolatey and not too sweet compared to the other ones. I was really impressed when our server split the checks for us. My only complaint it that the seat was uncomfortable. I've always had a good experience every time I come here :)."
S. G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",16,6,2,1.0,3/22/2017,"I don't usually yelp anyone, however tonight I ate at the cheese cake factory at the mission viejo.  I ordered my food and it took 30 minutes for them to bring it out, They weren't really busy.  When I finally got my food my fries was cold so I told my waiter very nice guy he apologized and got me a fresh fries. When I started eating my burger that I ordered Medume well it was Medume rare. I quietly told him about it and showed it to him, and I even told him it's not a big deal just want it to tell him. Did not ask for the manager nor asked for them onto comp it. He offered to have the manager come by and talk to me. I even told him they don't have too. The manager (she) did not even stop by to apologize. I did not eat half of my food and she had asked the waiter if I ate my food just to give a cheesecake. What a management she should not work there is she does not have time to stop by just to say sorry for what happened. I was not asking for anything and rest a sure I will never go back to that place again. We go there once week and not no more. I will spend my money where they appreciate my business."
Jojo P.,"Bakersfield, CA",11,27,25,4.0,5/20/2017,Great food got the Louisiana chicken pasta it was delicious with a little kick of spicy really good ... try it you won't regret it .... customer service was ok not great but ok that is why I knocked a star off .... but overall really delicious and don't forget to get a slice of cheesecake lol...
