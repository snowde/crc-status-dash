Era W.,"Las Flores, CA",66,89,12,4.0,1/23/2014,"I always like going to the Cheesecake Factory, there are a lot of dishes there I really like.  The NEW BEST Cheesecake they have is their SMORES CHEESECAKe. ITS AMAAAAZING!! Its definitely my new favorite and just so good!! Its there for a limited time, but I hope they add it to their permanent list!"
Sarah J.,"Buffalo, NY",40,77,101,5.0,1/2/2015,"I came here today for lunch we arrived around 11pm and were seated promptly. Our waiter was sweet and knew about the menu items throughly. We ordered the fried cheese and they gave us a complementary plate because the pieces were smaller than usual they said. All of our food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. Restaurant was clean and had a great atmosphere. I ordered the beef dip and my husband ordered the lunch size fish and chips (still a very large portion) and lastly we ordered the Adam's peanut butter cup fudge ripple cheesecake, the serving was large enough to split with my husband and I. :)"
Connor C.,"San Diego, CA",224,5,,5.0,3/20/2016,"Would highly recommend any of their pasta options! Had the cajun jambalaya pasta, and it was beyond my expectations.  The meal was expensive, but definitely worth the quality of food; the portions were large and well worth the price!  Would go again any day!"
Marilyn E.,"Irvine, CA",24,78,203,4.0,4/8/2013,"Louisiana chicken pasta is my favorite! I came here yesterday with my daughter and we ordered the same thing.... Louisiana chicken pasta, Coke and a chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake to split. I know what you're thinking....Holy calories and fat! I know BUT every so often you gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, the hostess was pleasant, service was good, my food was good but my daughter found a black hair in hers.... after she had eaten about 1/4 of it. She was getting ready to cut into the chicken when she saw something dark.... moved a pasta noodle and saw the black hair covered in sauce attached to the chicken. I pushed the hair to the side of the bowl, showed the waiter and asked if we could just give this dish back. He took the plate, a manager came out within minutes, apologized to both my daughter and I.... he asked her if he could get her another one or fix her something else to eat but she declined. He apologized again and had the dish removed from our bill. Yes it was gross, but it happens. The kitchen staff is only human and these things sometimes happen. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to go.... I was hopeful that since my daughter didn't have her food replaced that they would comp our dessert but they didn't. Perhaps that was just being stingy on my end. I'm giving The Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because they have one of my favorite pasta dishes and overall I do enjoy coming here. If they would bring the prices down and not charge $8 for a slice of cheesecake, I would give 5 stars."
Stefan N.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,3,,5.0,10/6/2016,"I probably visit a Cheesecake Factory once a week and Thai Lettuce-Wraps are my all time favorite. I eat out a lot and besides good food the staff is the best trained staff out there. Today our server was Brian S. what a nice young man. He was so respectful, fast and spot on, but the reason I'm writing this is because he was witty. It makes such a difference if one can banter, lough and converse with a waiter similar as one would with a friend but at the same time being professional about it. Stefan N"
Marc H.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/2/2016,Waited 45 minutes for appetizers at the bar we never got. We cancelled them because we ran out of time. They removed them from our bill and sent us on our way. Last time I set foot in any Cheescake Factory.
Kaytlin K.,"Newport Beach, CA",304,207,280,5.0,10/16/2014,"If you haven't tried their strawberry shortcake, you should!!! This place has everything possible to eat. Cheesecake (of course), great bread, fun drinks and a large menu! Worth bringing the whole family although it gets a bit pricey."
PJ W.,"San Diego, CA",311,33,15,3.0,1/25/2015,Tons of food to choose from. Anywhere from guy food to healthy food when your out with the wife. Not 5 starts because over the various visits the consistency of the food isn't always been there and the service is hit or miss.. still coming back here. The cheescake is awesome but I have to take a second mortgage to afford a slice of heaven. Even the manager girl shouldn't even be qualified as a hostess.
Sarah T.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",200,36,97,3.0,12/30/2014,"I've been going to this Cheesecake for 3 years now and it's always been consistently good! Service is super friendly and the portions are massive (we always end up sharing or taking it home). Weekends are generally super busy and on some weekday nights it get pretty busy too. I usually order either the 4 cheese pasta, shepherds pie, famous factory meatloaf, or the Renee special! Mmmmmm! I suggest coming here for lunch because they have lunch specials which are smaller portions and slightly cheaper."
Melanie W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,18,26,5.0,6/12/2014,The cheesecake factory is an awesome restaurant the ambience and the food are fantastic Are the name the place the  desserts are terrific and the portion sizes are just ridiculously big you always take home an extra meal.   They have a full stock and very nice bar with TVs and a very classy knowledgeable bartender  The waitstaff are very professional and they are dressed particularly well they know what they're doing and they have a good energy In particular I find their salads to be wonderful the dressings are just fantastic and you can always count on the lettuce being fresh I strongly recommend the Cheesecake Factory  in Mission Viejo for groups or just for a casual lunch
Mariah A.,"Vista, San Diego, CA",145,182,540,4.0,12/10/2014,Huge portions! Really busy on a Wed. night but still good service! Everything was tasty!
Sunny T.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,41,3,1.0,12/30/2015,"Terrible customer service. The lady charged me $3 extra on my salad for ""substituting"" avocado for chicken because I don't eat meat. So overpriced and ridiculous. Couldn't even enjoy my food after being disgusted by their greed. Not returning."
M. W.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/13/2017,"This review is solely on the atmosphere and cleanliness...not the food.  I want to like this restaurant but unfortunately, this restaurant seems to be neglected.  It's very dirty.  I think the reason they keep the lights so dim is so you can't see all the grime.  The plastic cups they put your water/drinks in are so scratched and old that I'm not sure if my water is dirty or it's just the cup.  The silverware is also very scratched so you have to do a double-take to make sure there's no old food stuck in the scratches.  The menus are filthy.  I had to use hand sanitizer after flipping through the menu because of all the stickiness and filth.  The booths are so gross!  Take a look next time at the wood and the walls where you sit...disgusting!  I had an experience awhile back at the MV location where a friend of mine and I were eating lunch there.  As we were eating, I noticed a ""bug"" crawling along the wood by her head!  She did talk to the manager and they said they would have someone out immediately to handle it and do a thorough cleaning.  She was satisfied with that and loves this restaurant so she asked me not to write a review.  I never went back after that until recently when my daughter wanted to go there for lunch.  Reluctantly, I said ok.  We were seated at a booth that was so dirty I asked if we could sit outside.  This restaurant definitely needs an update.  It's too dim and dingy.  The bathrooms also are so dark, I don't know if there's water on the floor or urine because you can't see anything.  They need to brighten this place up, clean it and bring it up to date."
Popi M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",187,22,16,1.0,11/20/2015,"I usually have good experiences here but this time I'm sad to report that I didn't. After ordering appetizers and finishing them, the waiter (who wasn't the one who delivered them and never even came over to ask how we were doing) just cleared my plates and silverware and without saying a word (would you like anything else?) just plopped down our check. Even after paying we got no attention. Smh"
Frank B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",122,7,2,1.0,9/6/2015,Worst restraunt I've ever been to hands down my order was wrong and waited an hour for an appetizer asked 3 different employees for bread and never got it. Don't go here this place is crap.
Viann C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",220,124,287,4.0,1/23/2015,"We came here for a birthday celebration!  This is one my favorite places because of the lemon drop martinis. They are to die for and of course, the cheesecake.  I got the Baja Chicken Tacos with rice and beans. The portions are decent!  I got 4 tacos and only ate a couple so I had some for lunch the next day.   The service is always great and they go above and beyond."
Nick D.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",119,72,49,1.0,12/19/2015,"Just had worst experience ever! Took forerver to get food in first place. Wife's salad was missing cheese, was drenched in dressing and a soggy mess. Server never came by the whole time. Got the menu again, orders and took another 20 mins to get that. Get it together Cheesecake Factory!"
Manny H.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,10,1,2.0,1/10/2016,I had dinner with my family yesterday  Not happy with the sever name Steven We sat down and Steven show up he never introduced him self help was short and dry  Bad attitude and very cocky  And told him to leave and have someone else's to server us .. I also spoke to the manager and had to report him  I hope I never see him again Good luck
Mimi S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",651,497,522,4.0,11/17/2012,"I came here Friday night with a hot date- my brother!  We went after 7pm and the place was a zoo!  They gave us the lighting thingy to notify us when our table would be ready and we were doing jumping jacks after it went off....only to be told by the hostess that our table wasnt ready.  A lot of people were made to wait after their lighting thingy went off....IF THE TABLES ARENT READY DONT TELL US THEY ARE!  Anyways, the server was Dean he made up for it.  He kept it together and was very attentive, polite and all the good things you'd expect....I totally would have asked him out on a date if he weren't wearing a wedding band...dang!   Anyways, I had clam chowder soup and it  was delicious.  I also ordered a pineapple mojito and it was ok.  My brother ordered Extreme Dream Cheesecake which has the oreo and it was a dream....while I ordered the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake it was sooo yummy!!!  The total came to about $30...pretty expensive considering we only ordered dessert but its Cheesecake Factory....not known for its cheapness!"
Dan H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,13,4,2.0,6/17/2014,I was there last week with my girlfriend everthing starred to we had ro wait 30 minutes to get in although we order a table.
