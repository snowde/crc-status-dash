Lance S.,"Dana Point, CA",6,26,22,5.0,8/5/2016,We always have a great meal at Cheesecake Factory but this one was even better but this was not just because of the food it was the server we had Andrea D. She was absolutely incredible. One of the best servers we have had and we the six of us eat out a lot.
Jhosselyn J.,"Riverside, CA",79,9,3,2.0,4/2/2017,"Took the waitress half an hour to give me a straw. Nasty mosquito on my food. The food was really good but the waitress sucked, stick to the cheesecake"
Amanda G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",6,84,48,1.0,4/27/2016,"Gave them a second chance and of course they failed horribly!! Worst location ever!!!!! Ordered the chicken sandwich with no avocado, the sandwich was thrown everywhere and was so rough you couldn't chew it.. They only have me a half piece of chicken, half of the sandwich just had cheese on it!"
Ana G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",2,17,23,4.0,11/6/2016,"Well, our family LOVES The Cheesecake Factory!!! We now specifically ask for Jason (our favorite South African server).  The only reason I'm giving this review 4 stars is because the other staff members are ""fine"". I would give Jason 10 stars if I could because he is extremely pleasant, gets our orders correct 100% of the time, and engages with all of my family members at the table. It's funny because when we place our orders he always makes it sound like it's the delicious selection we could've made hahaha- we LOVE him!!! We hear him interact with other tables around us, and he is pleasant with them as well. Cheesecake has a ""gem"" with Jason as part of their staff!"
Dragonfly P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,39,,2.0,4/2/2017,Too bad they take off my fav Luau salad.   they dont take reservation.  Food now are ok and pricey. Long line of waiting.
Adam S.,"Newport Coast, CA",0,1,1,1.0,1/9/2017,Horrible frightening experience! Uncooked slimy chicken hidden under the cheese in the Chicken Madera dish. Disgusting! I'm sorry is unacceptable! Zero stars and very disturbing waiting to see if Salmonella sets in.
Amanda K.,"San Clemente, CA",91,68,6,2.0,6/30/2016,"Overall a standard Cheesecake Factory. Sometimes bread is more stale and cold, sometimes not and fresh. Food is okay. My favorite dish is the Thai lettuce wraps. I have always had great service here to their credit.  Yet, yesterday as I was eating my coleslaw I found a short, black hair in my food. It was disgusting to say the least. My server and manager were quick to come apologize and offer another coleslaw, but it was hard to stomach. I was offered a free dessert for the hair. They tried to remedy the situation, but I won't be going back any time soon."
Cheriyon T.,"Irvine, CA",1,3,1,1.0,4/25/2016,"Fellow foodies, this post is simply out of concern for us who may be eating out too much or take comfort in not taking extra time to cook at home. ...yes I'm guilty as well.  I ate lunch at the cheesecake factory then took my remaining lunch home to give my daughter for dinner only for her to find what looked like a small worm. The bummer part was that she ate most of the plate before she noticed but as a mom I'm mortified. I feel terrible still.  I notified the manager who offered a giftcard for $30 but after witnessing the bug in our food, I knew I wouldn't be back for a while therefore I simply asked for the $20 plate to be removed from my $70 bill. Parent to parent let's try and spend more time cooking at home and rely less on restaurant chains."
Aleks B.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,5.0,7/23/2017,Been to many CK factory restaurants but it my first time to this location.  It was too cold inside so they seated us outside with no issue and it only took a few minutes.  The staff was great and the food good as usual.
Katie S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,30,,5.0,7/30/2016,"I'm here on National Cheesecake Day (by accident) so I just got the food to go because it's so busy and the girls at the To Go/Dessert counter are KICKING ASS!!!! These girls are running around, working so hard. And they have the best attitudes ever. They are all so nice!  It's insane in here and they are doing a great job! Erin was the sweetest and she was hustling!"
Shir Y.,"Irvine, CA",58,43,9,5.0,8/24/2015,"Came  there with a group of friends tonight and had a lovely time. The drinks were served quickly as well as the appetizers and the meals. Dallis was our waitress and she was very sweet, polite and helpful! Recommended me a good salad and I loved her choice! Thank you for giving us a fun quality time!"
Jana M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",28,6,,2.0,1/5/2017,"This place is steadily becoming a disappointment. The last several times I ordered for pickup they have forgotten items and the food was subpar. We thought we would give it another shot tonight and again dipping sauces were left out and the chopped salad I ordered was a total joke. It was all lettuce and hardly anything else so I ended up ""fixing"" my salad at home with stuff I had in my fridge. For the price you pay for food here, it's just not worth the money spent. I don't think I'll be spending my $$ here anymore."
Kathleen B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,10,,4.0,7/8/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory and always have a great meal there. However, I just don't know why they make it such a hassle to get a straw for your water!  Every time I go there I have to ask for a straw and often have to get up and go to the station to get it myself, since the server rarely remembers to bring one. Such a lot of fuss for a simple thing."
Nelly C.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/1/2017,"I went to cheese cake factory after shopping with my daughter, we were celebrating her birthday, we asked for patio seating, it was about 8:50pm, we got a nice table, it took a while before a waitress came to our table, to introduce our waiter, young man, who probably was being trained, we order, took then a while to bring us water and bread, he left on the table, no silverware, so we couldn't put butter in the bread, started to get very dark it seems that after 9:00 they turn off the light and only the lamps from outside were giving us a bit of light, the food was brought the waiter was leaving as fast as the food was put on the table, we asked him to stop and bring us silverware, he apologize, brought us silverware, disappeared again, were ready to pay, finally he showed up again, asked if we needed anything else, dessert, we said only the bill,  we actually have to turn our phones flash light to get light to eat, honestly after I left the amount we consume + $6 tip, they never came back to the table, we walk away, by then we were the only ones there, as I was walking to my car, I feel that I should get back there and not leave any tip, which at the end I don't even know if they remember we were there.  The only reason for given them 2 stars is because the food was delicious and that's why we went there to start with, because where ever we go we always look for The Cheese Cake Factory, for their good food, so disappointed with their service, I don't think we should go back there!"
James S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,14,3,5.0,2/1/2017,"Always good food. Do yourself a favor and sit in Johnathan B. (Waiter) section. Been there a few times in the last month and both times he rocked. Prompt, friendly and professional. We will be back."
Anna G.,"Orange, CA",0,10,,5.0,6/27/2017,Excellent service! Wait staff were very attentive and even asked if we wanted a refill of our drinks to go. Super clean atmosphere. The Louisiana chicken pasta is super fabulous! My husband had the miso salmon and lived it as well. Thank you Cheesecake Factory! Keep up the great work!
B R.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",9,221,187,5.0,10/28/2016,"Came here with our family who are visiting from New Zealand. There were 9 of us in our party so we had to wait a bit to be seated but once we were service was really good, friendly, and attentive. Everyone in our party enjoyed what we ordered which included for appetizers Nachos (super BOMB) and guacamole and chips. Gumbo (oh soooo good!!!), Burritos (good but not great), Chicken Teriyaki (also good but was drowning in teriyaki sauce), Spaghetti and meatballs, salad, two different pasta dishes and two other entrees that I can't remember anymore.  Almost everyone ordered their strawberry lemonade which is so good is addicting. We got 2 orders of oreo cheesecake (super yum), banana cheesecake, and key lime cheesecake....as always, all the cheesecake were very, very good. I love the Cheesecake Factory in whatever city and state I visit, it never disappoints."
Roger F.,"Glendale, AZ",0,7,,1.0,5/19/2017,"Went to lunch yesterday with friends and the Meat Loaf lunch, ordered by two people was terrible:  meatloaf was cold and the sauce was bitter and not blended, the rest of the plate items were cold also.  Hated to complain because we didn't want to embarrass our guests.  Service was good.  We will not go back to this location,"
Vickie M.,"San Clemente, CA",0,3,1,1.0,8/19/2016,"It is apparent Cheesecake in Mission Viejo, CA doesn't get it or care. I am not going to your place early or later. Stupid  suggestion come later, I can at 6P and got seated at 9P with young children. So, why come later, if seating people late. Your food is not that good to eat early; not that good to eat late; and not that good to eat anytime."
David C.,"San Diego, CA",390,677,372,4.0,5/19/2015,We celebrated a birthday here which is probably a popular thing to do. The menu was much more in depth than I thought it would be. There are tons of pages and you may want to study ahead to be prepared. After many minutes of Flipping through the pages we went with the grilled chicken tostada salad and the Thai lettuce wraps. The portions are huge so be prepared me ready to share. I recommend if with a big group trying as many items as you can. Also ask the waiter for help if needed because there are over 259 items to choose from. As far as the cheesecake that is obviously a must. Close your eyes and point to a couple to try! I recommended the Oreo one and maybe a seasonal option you can't get year round. A great place to celebrate that has big portions with an affordable price!
