Tabitha S.,"Valencia, CA",4,29,5,5.0,9/29/2016,"Love the fact that I can order lunch, and drive over and get curbside pick up. This mall is always crazy busy, so curbside makes everything better. I probably order once every other week and I have never had an order error and they are always so kind and efficient when coming to bring out my food."
T B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",11,20,3,1.0,10/7/2016,"So...I filled out their form online as requested.. And not to my surprise, no response at all.  I submitted the form 2-weeks ago.  What a waste of time and effort!"
Amber F.,"Riverside, CA",1,3,1,1.0,1/21/2016,"Worst service and sloppy food. My burger was brought out messy and disgusting. The man who dropped it at my table said I had to wait on the fries, but he ""didn't want my burger to die in the window"". Fifteen minutes later, the fries arrive and are cold. I will never come back to this location!"
Kittyy M.,"Fullerton, CA",302,100,155,4.0,1/17/2016,This is a sweet spot to go to when you are in the area or just got finished shopping at the mall attached to the restaurant. Its a pretty big location and the food is delicious! I feel like this is one of the better location in OC. Its not only big but I've never had a problem here as i would have at the one in Anaheim. The one in anaheim sucks and I've gotten sick from them before so i try to stay away from that location. Anyway i usually get the pasta and lettuce wraps here and they are so fresh and always makes my pasta the way i want it! I know i can be picky sometimes but they never hesitate to make anything i want. I love coming here!
Julie B.,"Irvine, CA",1060,731,427,4.0,11/15/2013,"There isn't much to say about the Cheesecake Factory that everybody doesn't already know about - it's a chain, they have great cheesecake, and wait times at peak hours can be as atrocious as the calorie/fat/sodium levels in their dishes. But every once in a while, it's a nice treat (that you will be paying hours at the gym for). I particularly enjoy their BBQ chicken salad, avocado eggrolls, and their beef dip. Oh, and their bread basket is definitely a yummy, carb-y filler. Their cocktails tend to be on the weaker side, but they've got a decent wine list. Really, who isn't a fan of Cheesecake Factory?"
Rose B.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,478,1780,4.0,2/22/2015,"Honestly over good experience. Great service & food served hot & fast :) Ordered spinach artichoke dip with warm tortilla chips as our appetizer.  Chicken Marcella amazing, in a white wine based sauce served with mushrooms and chicken breasts w/bow tie pasta. It's a large portion, you will Most def. be going home with left overs.  Also, Hibachi steak served with teriyaki sauce & size of wasabi mash potatoes :) I don't know which was better. Fast service on a  busy Friday night, great service & amazing sangria & fruit !!!   This location rocks. Not as packed as others."
Jeff H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",35,30,6,5.0,3/30/2016,"Amazing food and exceptional service by Saul, & the toasted marshmellow s'mores cheesecake is highly recommended!  Thanks Saul!"
Kelley R.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",0,14,,5.0,10/28/2016,"This is our go to place for a nice meal. ""Chain"" or not, Cheesecake Factory is damned delicious! From salads to burgers to pizza-there isn't anything bad on the menu. Some of my favorites-crispy crab Wontons, the endive pecan & blue cheese salad, and my new favorite--pasta Da Vinci!  If you can get in, the happy hour is one of the best in town. Great prices! If I had one minor complaint, I wish they hadn't converted the half dozen or so bar tables to dining tables... Along with amazing food, the service at the MV location is excellent. From the bartenders to the wait staff, I've never not gotten less than excellent service regardless of how busy it is. Erin B. has taken care of us many times. What a sweetheart! You can't go wrong with Cheesecake Factory!"
Tristan L.,"Irvine, CA",1,8,127,4.0,7/6/2015,Happy hour is always great. Mojitos for 5$.  Servings are humongous! Our new fave is the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake
John M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",2,51,1,5.0,7/24/2016,I always enjoy coming to the cheesecake factory although it could be pretty pricey Tamara provided outstanding customer service which made the meal a delight. We were a party of five and sat on the patio and really enjoyed our outing due to  our  great food server.
Desi Girl 7.,"Bakersfield, CA",62,22,1,2.0,8/1/2016,"I use to be an avid Cheesecake Factory eater, but not after what happened the last time I was there. I had ordered a strawberry smoothie (which I always order when I go there). However, this time I found rubber in my smoothie, I called the manager to complain and all he had to say was, ""are you sure it was rubber"". I assured him it was rubber and even put the pieces into a plastic bag. The manager told me he would send me a gift card (which I have yet to receive). When I spoke to the manager he didn't seem surprised nor concerned that there was pieces of rubber in the smoothie. It was like nothing was new.  After this incident I am turned off by Cheesecake Factory!"
Sue T.,"Irvine, CA",68,78,6,3.0,10/24/2016,Service level going down a little bit more every time We go there.... Today's lunch visit no exception.  And because I love their food.
Vina O.,"Downers Grove, IL",473,679,22,4.0,11/20/2015,"This place gets BUSY, yet whenever we go our server always seems to stay composed and friendly amidst the chaos and demanding patrons. It's a smaller Cheesecake Factory than most, so it seems a bit cramped. If you want to eat here, I recommend going at an ""off"" time to avoid a long wait. Don't forget to order the red velvet cheesecake at the end! Worth the $9!"
Jonathan V.,"Irvine, CA",130,1,,1.0,6/12/2016,"Ruined the rest of our night - poor customer service. I want to preface this by saying, I know everyone will have a different experience eating here. You may experience no problems whatsoever- with perfect food and a friendly waitstaff. Heck I've even experienced great service here before. However tonight was different.  Now I never write reviews, but the events of this evening have inclined me to do just that. -Hopefully by the end of the review you will have a better judgment of if you want to eat here or not.  The evening started off on the right foot with the waiter asking us for our drink orders and also offering bread. We ordered the Calamari appetizer we always order as well as a dip. For our entrees, I was happy to know that they could still make a Barbecue Salmon even though it was no longer on the menu. The person I was with ordered their favorite dish that they ALWAYS get: Lemon Crusted Chicken with Couscous.  They appetizers came out fine however the the Calamari portion seemed smaller than usual. When the entrees came out was a whole different story. My entree came out fine and a portion I expected. However, the Lemon Crusted Chicken with Couscous came out about half size portion or less. We are used to the dish being fairly big and fulfilling, and it usually is a dish that can be shared. There are usually two pieces of chicken strip about 4oz each. If you have eaten at Cheesecake Factory before, you know how big their portions usually are. There was BARELY any couscous and hardly any chicken. There were four total smashed chicken pieces and appeared to be less than a half portion.  What was worse was that it appeared they tried to compensate the lesser chicken and couscous with just more spinach and other vegetables to fill the plate. Since the person I was with normally orders the dish they soon realized that portion was much smaller than usual. Here is where things started to get ugly. - we flagged down the waiter and carefully explained to him that the portion of chicken AND couscous appeared to be much less than usual. My first impression of his response was that he was speculative but he then too ACKNOWLEDGED that the chicken also to be much less than usual. But we were then underwhelmed by his offer. He offered to just bring another chicken and asked if that is what would make us satisfied or if he had to do a re-fire. We explained that the chicken was not the only problem of the dish but that the whole PRESENTATION of the dish was UNSATISFACTORY. He obliged to do a refire but also told us we were now going to be taken care of by another waiter as he had to step away for 10min - he NEVER came back to our table after. The waiter who replaced him was fine and she served us the rest of the night.  But this is when things really got out of hand for us. 10 or so minutes later the manager Amy Wright delivered the redone and corrected dish to our table. However, rather than acknowledging and APOLOGIZING for the mistake in portion size, her first comment upon delivering the dish was ""I just want you to know that we in the kitchen normally do not put this much chicken on this dish, so in the future don't expect this much."" She also then proceeded to explain that this dish comes with 2 4oz pieces and that we were getting more this time. Are you kidding me? We then explained to Amy that that was not the portion that was initially given and we know the usual portion because we order the dish a lot. It appeared to us that she had not even seen the original dish. She then walked away.  However the fact that we had to defend ourselves was incomprehensible and unforgivable. Amy, as a manager, should have deescalated the situation by coming to the table and APOLOGIZING for the kitchen's mistake and offering to make the situation better for the customer. She DID NOT ONCE APOLOGIZE the entire night. And as a customer, all I know is what I'm used to-  I do not care about the logistics of my order. I just want the situation resolved. Do not make me feel like the bad guy if it is your kitchen that is not making the dish correctly. We were not asking for the moon. We just saw an inconsistency and wanted it resolved.  Unfortunately the person I was with was no longer hungry due to the wait and we ended up asking for it to go. What overall made it worse and what was the nail on the coffin was that Cheesecake Factory DID NOT initially COMPENSATE us on the bill for the Chicken and Couscous meal and for the inconvenience. WE HAD TO ASK. Oh and we later saw our initial waiter, however he was helping the BIGGER party next to us.  We never once made an outlandish request and we were initially understanding, however Amy Wright the manager did not deescalate the situation and instead escalated it. They never made an attempt to correct their wrongdoing and just took the easy way out. Overall an unnecessary unsatisfactory experience and a bitter end to the night as I am stuck writing this. Buyer beware"
Chiara M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,4,,5.0,11/12/2016,Walter! Great service and very outgoing! We all had a great night and we could not of asked for a better waiter. You rock man!! Keep up the good work.
Kristen E.,"San Clemente, CA",0,8,2,4.0,4/16/2017,"I LOVE this place.  Great food, drinks, ambiance - its got it all!!  Its always crowded - probably bc everyone else thinks its great too - but its well worth the wait.  I wish the would open a restaurant closer to where I live."
Silvia L.,"San Clemente, CA",58,49,5,5.0,5/9/2016,"We just came to get our usual pasta davinci, omg I'm in heaven. This food is absolutely amazing. Me being a chef and restaurant owner - this is my day off, do nothing and be served. Our server is absolutely fabulous.  We couldn't be happier"
Pearl T.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",5,169,43,5.0,8/28/2016,Always very tasty food.  Service was proficient.  Had a very enjoyable lunch with my little man.  Outdoor covered patio seating was perfect.
Rita J.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,12,,2.0,7/18/2016,"I love Cheesecake Factory! But lately when u order a meal with meat in it, it's hardly there!!!!! Sunday my daughter & I order a Mexican salad w/ chicken, it was a lot of lettuce &  4 very small pieces  of chicken! I asked our waitress  where's the chicken?

When we told our waiter that my moms dish had no shrimp in it  he brought out 4 pieces of small shrimp! Hello Cheesecake Factory in mission mall location!!!!!!! Where's the meat!!!! The meal w/ meat are not cheep! So when ordering a salad w/ chicken , I would love to see at lease a mouthful!"
Ray V.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",153,164,307,4.0,2/26/2015,"Known for having a ridiculously large menu, Cheesecake Factory serves up some tasty treats in an upscale casual setting.  They have 20+ chicken dishes and a menu spanning 10+ pages.  I've been to this location at least 10 times with my most recent visit just a couple of days ago. Here's my breakdown... TIP 1:  Call for a reservation or to check on wait times.  This place gets packed TIP 2:  They offer curb side pick up for phone orders.  Yes they walk it out to your car and handle payment and everything.   GOOD 1:  The food is good.  I'm not saying it's going to blow you away and be a unforgettable experience but it is good.    My wife ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and really enjoyed it.  I ordered a Breaded Chicken with a lemon sauce and it was excellent. GOOD 2:  They are very kid friendly.  This is the reason I have them the 4th star.  We have a 18 month old daughter and once we were sat we were immediately asked if we wanted a ""baby plate"".  We said yes and it was on our table in 2 minutes.  For those that don't know what a baby plate is... it's a small plate of tiny bread pieces and cut up banana.  It's perfect to keep your little one busy for a few minutes while mommy and daddy go over the menu and make selections. GOOD 3:  The staff we fast, friendly, and accurate.  We were checked on every 10-15 minutes like clockwork.  I asked for a minor customization and they happily obliged.    BAD 1:  The menu is just silly.  It's way too big and doesn't really draw your attention to anything.  It's always annoying to me when I have to read a menu like a novel just to know what my options are.  In retail it's called ""paradox of choice"" and in a nutshell it turns off customers.  That's how I feel about their menu. BAD 2:  Parking is a nightmare... it's in a Mall so it's not their fault but it is part of my experience as I only went there for Cheesecake Factory.   Overall it's a nice place to eat and has lots of choices.  It's clean and the staff is friendly.  The thing that stands out for me and why it's on my regular list is the effort they put in to make dining with small children enjoyable."
