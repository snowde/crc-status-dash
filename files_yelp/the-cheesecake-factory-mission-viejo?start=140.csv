Sadia M.,"Irvine, CA",16,18,8,1.0,1/8/2017,"I love the Cheesecake Factory--let's just start with that. It's like our go-to family restaurant whenever we need a quick bite to eat and we're roaming around in the mall.  We typically go to the Irvine spectrum Cheesecake since we live right across the street, but we had to run a few errands at the mission Viejo mall today so we came to this one instead.  It was a Saturday afternoon so I understand that the place was busy, but we literally waited over an hour to get our entrees. Finally, when we were tired of eating of eating the bread, I let the waitress know that it's been an hour and asked if we could just cancel our meals now because everyone was tired of waiting. She said she'd check on the food again, and it finally did come out, but I honestly expected the manager to come apologize or at least acknowledge that it wasn't ok for us to have to wait that long. We were just a party of three so it's not like our order was complicated. Nobody acknowledged anything and we just ended up leaving afterwards. I probably won't come back to this location because of the service today."
Celine S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",23,97,171,4.0,2/20/2015,"Had a nice late lunch here. We were seated promptly and served by a very friendly waitress. We ordered from the SkinnyLicious menu - ahi tuna tartar, grilled salmon and grilled steak medallions.  Order came out quick and we cleaned our plates! Steak was cooked perfectly alongside some yummy asparagus, tomatoes and mushrooms. The salmon was a touch over cooked, but still tasted great. Ahi tuna tartar was fab, would definitely order that again.  Conveniently located, great variety and solid service."
Mylinh S.,"Oxnard, CA",49,133,471,5.0,11/27/2015,"Love the service at this restaurant, hence the 5 stars. Even though it was  Black Friday and the mall was packed, we were seated within 7 minutes. Our waitress Jenna took our orders right away and the food arrived just a few minutes later. The servings were huge and the food was good."
Patti G.,"Burbank, CA",5,24,12,2.0,9/8/2016,"Overpriced CRAP!  Haven't been here for a long time and now I remember why.  We came here because I received a gift card.  To start with, they were out of the appetizer we ordered the loaded tater tots.  We ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, not great, just ok.  I ordered the comfort food of chicken and biscuits, way too salty with cold potatoes.  The manager came over and offered to get me something else.  I ordered the soup which was a vegetable soup, mostly rice and charged me $6.95 for the soup!  Granted he offered to get me a replacement for the chicken, however the classy thing to do would have been to comp the soup.  The only reason this place is getting two stars, is because of the cheesecake.  The moral of this review, skip the meal and eat the dessert first!"
Margo C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",48,8,,5.0,10/17/2016,Great food especially for gluten free menu. Great place for take out or eat in.  Beautiful earring area and nice staff.
Samantha B.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,14,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Service and new management is terrible. Been going here for years but it has changed so much, for the worse. It's a shame because it was one of my favorite restaurants!"
Evelyn T.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1118,915,518,4.0,4/17/2013,"I like their cheesecakes here. So far I've tried Dulce De Leche, Pineapple Upside Down and Fresh Strawberry Cheesecake. My favorite so far is the Fresh Strawberry, I found the other ones too sweet for my taste. That's probably a good thing for most people, I would guess other people don't find the flavored cheesecakes too sweet. There are so many choices on their menu - over 200 menu selections according to their website. A huge variety of cheesecakes, salads, appetizers, burgers, and a lot of other items are on that menu. I'm pretty sure they'll have something you want. They even have a Skinnylicious menu for people who are watching their weight.  The place gets packed on the weekends; I think you are better off going there Monday through Thursday. The wait for a table on a weekend can be long. Service is usually pretty good, although the waiters can be very busy and may not be very quick to come by your table."
Parastoo C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",20,17,83,5.0,5/31/2015,The food is delicious and same as service  And the food came on time and it was very good and of course who can forget about the bread that they bring it is hot and delicious
Kris D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,20,1,2.0,9/12/2015,"Allthough this restaurant has been one of our frequent visited places, we had a rather unpleasant experience tonight. I ordered the steak Diane and my spouse the factory burger protein style medium cooked with the sweet potato fries. When they brought the food to the table, her burger was not a full patty but 3 chunks of meat, still raw inside and cold. We told the waitress and she was unexperienced and did not know what to say or do but finally realized she had to take it back to the kitchen. After 5 minutes or so, the manager came to apologize and admitted the meat was raw and told us he would bring another burger. 12 minutes later she received the now well cooked burger, no fries and no requested mayonaise. By then I already finished my plate and she had to eat the burger with cold fries. I would have at least expected that they would offer a desert or take something of the bill, but no extra apologies, no desert, no deduction and the manager that walked by us and not even apologized. TCF Mission Viejo just lost 3 stars to us."
Jason H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",48,6,4,2.0,9/10/2016,"Poor service, waited a good while for a table, which was tolerable, but waited over an hour for the food to come for the three of us while others around us had no such problem. The manager didn't seem concerned with the wait time and simply asked us if we would like more bread while we wait. The food was average, the waitress was fine, but the rest could use work."
Jess C.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,9,4,2.0,3/28/2016,"Quality control has gone downhill. We came here Easter Sunday. My favorite salad had wilted lettuce and hardly any chicken and avocado. Then they dimmed the lights where it was suddenly too dark. When you spend $250 entertaining people with a nice meal here, you have certain expectations, like for meal/service/ambiance to be consistently the same.  This hasn't been an issue before.  New management?  Also, the bathroom was horrific! Ranking just above a gas station bathroom -default by location. There were seat covers all over the floor to cover what appeared to be a leak, and both trashes were overflowing.  On a good note, the service was great as always, but come on guys. I'll happily change my rating when you change back to the way things were!"
Gabbie R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Wow I have never been so disappointed with this place!! Have gone to Cheesecake Factory for years and always had great food and fun. But seriously, WOW I walked out of there tonight more furious than ever. Absolutely terrible overall vibe, overpriced, food was bad, and astoundingly awful customer service.  Even after explaining our bad experience we still had to pay $35!!! I didn't want that food, I didn't want any free stuff, I didn't wanna be there and I certainly did not want to pay for my awful night they caused!  Not going back again, which is honestly disappointing.  On the bright side, we saw two people noticeably trying to fix it! The female server helping our table out at first was obviously putting in work and she was great! Also Sean the manager was a big help in getting the situation done with.  Just sad it had to be that way. (Oh and -$35, spent on a bad dinner) :("
John M.,"Santa Barbara, CA",68,28,8,5.0,7/28/2016,"Best angle hair pasta with Parmesan chicken, with Alfredo sauce, after that salted caramel cheese cake, I am talking about heaven. Great food."
Zoe Y.,"San Francisco, CA",952,213,239,1.0,6/20/2015,"I am a HUGE fan of the Cheesecake Factory, let me be clear. However this location is sub-par. If I see the Cheesecake Factory on any mall directory I am usually eager to say ""let's go here!"" however I think I will review my choices more carefully from now on. This is not my first time here, as I have been here dozens of times. However, tonight was one weird experience. Service: 1.5 stars Hostess at the front (short brown bob and blue eyes - couldn't catch her name) was really rude and short with us. It was a Friday night and graduation night, so I understand she was swamped. However my friend and I were shopping and taking these two factors into account, we decided to put our name down a little early. When she handed us the buzzer, I politely asked her, ""If I go to Nordstrom, will this still buzz?"". She completely ignored me and talked to her co-worker. Okay, I thought, it is loud in here. So I repeated my question. The co-worker heard me but walked away quickly while the short bob-lady still did not acknowledge me. I finally said with a firm voice, ""EXCUSE ME"" and then proceeded with my question. She finally heard me and said, ""Nope"", just like that. Not only did she briefly answer my question, she did so with an attitude that made me feel far superior than herself. Sorry I am not familiar with your pager system, lady.  We were sat outside and our server seemed to rush us. I never caught her name because I was using the restroom when she took our drinks, but she made me feel extremely rushed to put all of our orders in. I understand you want to flip tables and make x amount of tips, however that is no reason to treat customers with a rushed feeling. She was so rude to us at the end when we asked to split the bill (before she even brought the checks out) and I over it really quick. Food: 1 star I usually order the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps (super awesome and delicious), however I decided to go outside of my comfort zone and try something different. I ordered the Club Sandwich and it was very dry and bland. I could have had a better sandwich at Subway or Togo's for far less. Ambiance: 3 stars I don't mind this location because it is in a mall and they seem to keep it quite nice in here. It is super clean however the bathroom was really tiny and messy. I know it is Friday night and graduation night, however it seems that a large corporation like this would have a sufficient staff to keep things nice and tidy on occasions like this.  Overall, I probably would not visit this location again. I would much rather drive the extra 15 mins to the Irvine Spectrum location and enjoy a nice meal there. I have never had a bad experience there."
Keycee D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",444,524,2877,3.0,8/3/2013,"My little cousin and I happened to stumble upon Cheesecake Factory at this location. We were just shopping and got hungry and decided to eat here. It was a weeknight and the wait was 5 minutes for us. I then realize it's been more thatn 5 minutes, people started to get seated that came in after us, i started to get irritated. I then went up to the person taking reservations and told me they had given my seat to someone else. They gave my seat to someone named ""JESSICA"" how the hell do you confuse a Keycee to a Jessica!???! Ugh!  Other than that, our waitress was very good. The food is always good, I tried their flat bread for the first time and it was Yummy-Yum Yum. My cousin loves their four cheese pasta."
Larry W.,"San Clemente, CA",0,10,6,1.0,1/21/2017,"My wife and I called in and ordered food to go for pick up at curbside. They forgot a few things and had to go back in to get the missing sides. Took 12 min. Got home, I ordered the chicken and biscuits. Tossed the biscuits in the trash as they were over cook. We asked for extra sauce for each of our meals and the containers for the sauce wasn't even filled half way. Guess they wanted to try and save $0.00001.  I have never been a fan of The Cheesecake Factory but my wife loves one of their meals. Wife now knows she's on her own if she wants to go back there."
Cameron M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",303,10,1,5.0,8/5/2016,"We frequently visit this cheesecake factory and I have not to this date had any negative experiences of any significance. Tonight, however, the power for the whole restaurant went out for about 20 min. This was right after we were finishing our apps and before entrees had been delivered. During this time, the waiter informed us that the kitchen was down and only half of our dishes were finished, the other half of our table did not receive any of their entrees that they had ordered. The manager was very cooperative when we spoke to her and made sure that some of our bill was taken care of as well as adding on a few pieces of free cheesecake. She did what any good manager would and made sure her customers were taken care of and left satisfied. Will definitely be returning."
Aerial A.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,604,67,4.0,6/14/2016,I came here with a friend and it was a good experience. It was my second time eating at a Cheesecake Factory and my friend's first time. My friend order a bacon burger made with Kobe beef and an old fashioned. The Kobe beef bacon burger was amazing! I wasn't a big fan of the old fashioned and my friend said it wasn't the best they have had. I ordered from the SkinnyLicious menu. I choose the enchiladas. I really liked the enchiladas and the side salad that came with it. The free bread and butter is quite yummy and our server was great as well. For dessert we got the chocolate chip cheesecake which I didn't really like. My friend liked it though.
Matt D.,"Columbia, MD",1,9,1,5.0,8/25/2016,"So this place has some of the yummiest food I've ever eaten. Go for happy hour, because the apps here are literally to die for. The avocado egg rolls are a must, and I truly mean that. In addition their fried Mac n cheese balls are incredibly gooey and delicious. Cheesecake Factory also makes the best mojito I've ever had, and by far. Like I said, go for happy hour and just about everything you get will be 5.95. And let's not forget about the cheesecake at the end..."
Alma R.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",9,33,39,5.0,9/3/2015,"It's me again lol!  :D  Loved this place! It's my second time here and I still love it. As usual I get the sliders with cheese. I also tried their tortilla soup and it's pretty big. Our waitress was super sweet and the lights are soft. I really enjoy it here. I brought a light sweater... for me it was a little chill, but not too much. I've had great experiences here and I'm sure I'll come back again. Our orders were taken out on time and our server assisted us with quickness and always smiling. Thank you for again making my experience here awesome ! :)"
