Rae E.,"Dana Point, CA",6,11,5,2.0,12/26/2015,"Tonight we called in a picked up curb side, when we got home our macaroni cheese balls were so burnt they were not edible then on top of that they had no sauce to break down the burnt outside. Then we had two orders of four cheese pasta which they were both extremely dry. These two items are my favorite items and only get them when I want to splurge. And I was not happy."
Greg J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",18,8,13,4.0,3/22/2015,"This was my first visit to the Cheesecake Factory of Mission Viejo Mall and both visits have been great! Tonight me and a friend were comfortably greeted and sat right away. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful. Our drink orders were taken right away followed shorty by warm, fresh bread. She answered many of our questions about the menu with excellent suggestions. Our food was brought out within 10-15 minutes and all three dishes were absolutely phenomenal! We weren't very hungry to begin with, but finished every bite due to its deliciousness. We were constantly checked up on, asked how our food was and if there was anything else we needed. Also our drinks were topped of consistently which, personally, I find an excellent waiter/waitress quality. The place was beautiful and relaxing. I will surely be coming back to this location! Keep up the great service guys! You made my night :)"
Marcos C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,25,2,3.0,7/3/2016,"Service here is whatever. I get you don't want to be at work on a weekend at 11pm...but at least pretend you are ok with being at work so I can give you a better tip. Like why offer us bread if you aren't even going to bring it out, and when we ask you about it you look at us like we are the ones who are making your life horrible. Luckily the food was amazing, ordered a salad & a turkey burger. Cheesecake is Always great, expensive, but delicious. Definitely a place to come like once every 6 months."
Elham B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/13/2016,This place is awesome & the cheesecakes here are the best. Also they were so sweet and attentive . We will definitely be coming back very soon.
Lexi K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/12/2016,"The customer service was very good, our server Chelsey was wonderful. Our food came out very fast, and she was very consistent in re-filling our drinks and checking up on the table."
Ali S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",176,455,27,3.0,8/26/2015,"Solid 3 stars. The cheesecakes are obviously awesome. The food is so-so, some dishes are better than others, nothing spectacular. In my younger days I could eat an entire full BBQ salad, which is huge. All the portions are huge, but now we try to limit the portions and share. Typical south OC crowd here."
Amy A.,"San Clemente, CA",160,20,20,5.0,6/8/2016,Food is always great! I love the Santa Fe chicken salad and the strawberry martini. I always sit at the bar if mikes working. He's a great bartender.
Ahmed E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",278,41,20,4.0,7/1/2015,"Been here a few times before.  It is actually between 3.5 and 4.0 stars. It is located inside the mall so it's perfect to visit after a long day of shopping. Fried calamari are a perfect appetizer. The filet mignon is delicious and never disappoints (well done).  Fettuccini Alfredo also very creamy but sometimes the sauce is a bit too dry. The original cheesecake itself is alright but it isn't anything to be amazed by. The staff are decent, try not to go on weekends and especially after 5:00 PM because you may have to wait over an hour sometimes to be seated."
Jeff S.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",104,152,36,2.0,7/28/2015,"Cheesecake factory is known for their extensive menu, great drinks and great service. This location seems to be below par. Service is hit or mess. Most of the time it's a mess. The staff is quick to turntables since it can be busy, bartenders are friendly. I was a huge fan of a burger that I no longer have on the menu but have all the things to make it. I was advised that the cost with double to have them add coleslaw to a burger. The server did not seem willing to check on other items to see if they can make those. Food came out cold and had to be reconnect. This happened the last two visits and I will probably skip this location in the future"
Ray H.,"Rancho Mission Viejo, CA",0,15,3,2.0,6/20/2016,"This Cheesecake Factory is always my number one choice to go to if I am going out. However today has been unreal. Food tasted fine. But service was unreal. First we waited over an hour for our food. Second when our food was delivered one salad didn't make it. Then it took 20 more minutes to get the salad, we were told the manager was going to come talk to us. Yet not once did anyone come apologize. Then we sat with empty drinks and had to stop our waiter to ask for boxes and the check and then had to wait again for that. I will from now on be going to a different Cheesecake Factory."
K B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",42,61,71,2.0,9/8/2015,"Usually we have good experiences here, especially with the wait staff, but I had to say something about our last visit. We just dined here about 5:30 Monday night, Labor Day. While service was with a smile, there was obvious poor planning by management for a holiday and it needs to be addressed.  Extra staffing was desperately needed. The hostesses didn't seem to know what they were doing (don't train during the dinner rush), our waiter was managing eight tables and running around like crazy, and he was double seated twice. While the table next to us got their order in, it was another half hour before our order was taken and another half hour for the food. Then our waiter disappeared for a good 15 minutes. By the time he got back, we were ready to leave and waited another fifteen minutes for our check to be paid.  On our way out, we picked up a slice of cheesecake, which was another flawed process. There was ONE girl and a random guy in and out, taking the orders and also filling them for the entire restaurant. My husband stood there for another ten minutes just waiting for a piece of cheesecake sitting right in front of us. We thought ordering at the counter would expedite the process of getting it since the waiter kept going MIA but there was just no getting around the long wait.  This was a NIGHTMARE considering we had our 3 month old with us. She is an excellent baby, which is why we take her everywhere, no problem. But when dining out takes over two hours due to understaffing, and the table you shun is the one with the baby, you're asking for a problem. Management needs to plan better coverage for holidays! Maybe you'd have happier wait staff if they had a fair balance of tables. It felt like the regular Monday staff wasn't supported with any extra holiday help, and the restaurant suffered because of this."
D C.,"San Clemente, CA",15,128,45,4.0,4/10/2016,It was Saturday night and the places packed with people. I selected to sit outside and this gave me a chance to sit faster than people who wanted to sit inside. It was nice looking patio area and even it was busy the service was fast. Customer service is great and the potion size way enough that we brought left overs. I will return again.
Marissa L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",254,503,1089,2.0,7/20/2015,"I don't like this place to begin with, but I came here for my Aunt's birthday dinner. Even my soda was bad. I got a Dr. Pepper and it was flat and watery. I have no idea how that happens. The only ok thing was my Mom's dynamite shrimp. Crunchy fried shrimp with a nice spicy mayo sauce. I got orange chickens my entree. The batter was soggy and the sauce was too sweet, not enough spice. I'm not coming here for my birthday."
L I.,"San Clemente, CA",30,28,25,5.0,6/8/2016,"I visit this location at least 2 times a month to have lunch with my mom. Today I had their turkey club and loved it. Perfectly toasted bread with mayo to the edges that is stuffed with turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. I had the side salad with ranch but don't hesitate to get the fries they are great as well. The burgers are juicy and almost too big to take a bite. I also had their iced mint green tea a must for every visit. Of course their cheesecake is unbelievable!!!!!"
David G.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,7,5,1.0,4/3/2016,"They told us it was a 10-15 minute wait which turned into more than 45 minutes. Â I complained to the manager but he was obviously overwhelmed (at 6:00pm) and offered no explanation or apology. Once finally seated, the waitress was nice but the food was just average. Surprised and disappointed when the salad came out with processed meats. It's definitely gone down hill over the years. Don't understand why people still flock to this place."
Emma M.,"Stafford, VA",0,4,1,3.0,1/14/2017,"I love Cheesecake Factory, but this definitely isn't my favorite location. I've had one or two problems before, but usually I let things go. I'm a college waitress so I know Friday nights can be busy, but I was in tonight with my cousin and we were sat at an awkward location. Her seat was where two benches connected, I swapped seats with her and realized right away it was quite uncomfortable. Hadn't even taken off my jacket and popped back over and caught the (manager ?) an older gentlemen who sat us and asked to be moved. He said nothing else was available. And looked too busy to talk to us. I get it was busy, we waited 45 minutes, was told it would be 30 (went back up and the were told it was actually 30-40, totally fine). So busy, is cool, but if you don't have a second to care maybe point out someone who works there who might care. I just felt that if I didn't look like some ditsy college girl, than he would have maybe taken a second to ask me why. A simple ""Is there a problem with your table."" He didn't, didn't attempt to fix it, or see if he could move the benches so the were even (still would be awkward). I would have let this go if it weren't for the fact there was a booth across from us and a 2 top in our row open when we were sat, so I just felt like there were options. When I went back to sit down it was another couple minutes before both tables were filled. Then when I sat back down the women at the table next to me laughed and said the gentlemen before me had complained of feeling squished next to the pole and other one was uncomfortable in the bench seat. So maybe it had nothing to do with my gender, but either way, maybe not the best place to have a table. My wait wasn't worth sitting there, it was distracting. This location is the meeting point 1/2 way between my school and home so I pop into this location with my parents and always have felt I get better service with them. Whether it was because I was some girl or young, I just hate that I only get this feeling from this location. I tip 20% plus every time, I try to be polite to the busy hosts, and I'm just a customer who loves her cheesecake and comes in almost every week, but don't always feel welcomed by staff. Just something to maybe consider."
Missy B.,"Huntington Beach, CA",156,83,13,5.0,5/30/2016,"Chelsea is such a gem. Â Today is Memorial Day and this beautiful server paid for my mothers lunch (my mom's a veteran). Â Thank you for a great experience. Â Thank you, Chelsea."
Steve C.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,204,2788,2.0,4/14/2015,"Not very good. The server was absent the entire time. I've been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting for a check. I was going to order something to go, but not after the serious lack of service.  The chicken samosa app was good, but the fried mac balls did not taste right; not as good as they had been in the past. The server did refill the soda, but came across as cold and inconvenienced. Really, why the attitude? You're a server! You are at the bottom of the totem pole! Your job is that of an ignorant person; requires no skills and no education. So again, why the attitude? Still sitting here waiting for the check; just asked another server for the check.  Not returning."
Maria B.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",61,6,3,1.0,3/20/2016,I have eaten here several times But I was surprised the utensils were pretty dirty and I asked the sever to call the manager. The manager came and I showed him the utensils and he did not seem to even care and just said will get u new set. We received the new set same thing dirty. So we asked the server to either give us a hot towel or take time and wash it and she did wash it. She then brought the salad and again was very disappointed. Oh well I guess they are going down in service. I doubt if will go there again.
Lala Ines I.,"Santa Ana, CA",158,51,167,5.0,4/26/2015,"Best Place ever !!! from A to Z.... the customer service, the food, the attention, the decoration of the place, everything is great about this place.... the only thing that i REALLY THING THAT CHEESE CAKE FACTORY HAS TO CHANGE IS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T RUSH THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE EATING.. !!!! beside that everything is just wonderful!!!!"
