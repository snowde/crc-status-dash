Brian M.,"Irvine, CA",16,12,,5.0,4/20/2015,I love the servers here.  I have very very specific dietary restrictions and it's NEVER been a problem. In fact the servers seem to enjoy making sure not only do they take my order correctly but they follow up every time to make sure it was right when it hit the table.  The staff is always happy and amicable. And the food is delicious
Marc P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",6,12,28,1.0,6/12/2016,Worst service and the manager Elizabeth was rude . They told us the wait was 10 minutes.  They asked us 3 times if we had 4 kids with us .  We were 4 adults and 4 kids.  After 10 minutes they said the wait was an hour.  Not going there again.
Melissa K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",348,211,1286,4.0,2/20/2014,"I frequently visit the Cheesecake Factory for dinner, but this was the first time I actually went for breakfast. To my surprise their breakfast items were very good. Not only well presented but also very delicious.  Our server was very attentive and frequently visited our table although the restaurant was very busy. Although tempting I was able to abstain from ordering a cheese cake for dessert as their cheese cake is to die for. My favorite is the simple cheesecake with strawberry sauce on it. Delicious rich and absolutely decadent. The menu as cheesecake is very diverse and robust. I recommend their breakfast items for anyone that is traveling to the mall for a shopping spree.  All of their dinner items are great, but the must have is obviously their huge selection of cheesecake. Please do not go into a Cheesecake Factory restaurant without ordering their cheesecake. Hello it's in the name, you will be doing yourself a dis service."
Shabnam N.,"Oakland, CA",13,41,18,5.0,1/20/2016,I think this is my favorite Cheesecake Factory in The OC came here and our waiter who looks like Adam Levine immediately asked me if I wanted a drink while I was waiting for my friend. I even mentioned to him on what my friend wants but I'd rather wait until she comes in. 15 min later when we ordered he still remembered what she wanted and what I wanted!!! He checked up on us every 10 minutes and made sure we were well taken care of!! What a great experience !
Joy G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",128,121,110,2.0,1/9/2015,"Awesome food, great wait staff...horrible front of the house staff. Cheesecake Factory, you oughta do something about your reservation and seating process because waiting over an hour when we can make a reservation is ridiculous.  Why don't they take reservations?  Uh, because it makes sense? Front staff review:  AWFUL!  Granted we came on a super busy evening, New Year's Eve, at 5:30 to get a head start on dinner and the crowd, and it was already a madhouse.  We spoke with the girl in front (short brown hair, sour face, looks like she hates life and everyone alive) and my husband put his name down for 4.  She rudely tells him ""It's going to be an hour, do you still want to wait?""  She pretty much implied that we need to leave!  My husband was a bit astonished with what she said and told her ""Uh yeah, we're hungry...?"" She retorted with ""It's STILL an hour."" and unceremoniously waved us off and called the next group behind us.   After waiting an excruciating hour, our buzzer finally went off and we went to the front table, handed the buzzer to the sour girl...and she just kept looking down and didn't even acknowledge us at all.  We stood there staring at her, waiting for her to look up but NOTHING.  She's a freaking mute or perhaps a robot.  All the other hostesses were busy but were actually assisting people to their tables!  Not this chick.  After standing for another two minutes, my husband finally pounded the table to get her attention; ""HEY!  We've been standing here..how long after we've been waiting for an hour do we have to wait again after our buzzer went off???""  She looked up and GLARED at him!  I felt like giving her a piece of my mind but she wouldn't like it.  She grabbed the menus and shoved them into the hands of another hostess  She didn't even say anything, man she really hates her job.  Sour girl with short brown hair..get a job as a PRISON WARDEN.  You're not cutting it as a restaurant hostess, not even close. Now to why we keep coming back:  the wait staff and the awesome grub!  Our waiter was an older gentleman by the bar area.  He profusely apologized for the long wait and wanted to get things started for us right away.  He was already laying down the bread basket as we were seating our son on the high chair.  My husband exclaimed ""I NEED A BEER, STAT!!!"" And he was on it like a bonnet.. Cheesecake Factory's menu changes constantly so it's hard for me to pin down a favorite, but so far everything they have is so delicious!  That evening, we ordered calamari, jambalaya pasta, chicken madeira, pepperoni pizza, a hibiscus martini and two beers.  Of course, you cannot go to Cheesecake Factory without ordering cheesecake! The Godiva cheesecake is so rich I could only eat a few bites at a time and I always save the rest and still have desert for at least after two meals!  My husband loves anything with peanut butter and my daughter ordered the strawberry.  So good!  Worth the $150 we spent that evening. With that said, I think Cheesecake Factory should re-train their front staff and re-evaluate their reservation process."
Dave S.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,25,,2.0,5/28/2016,"Terrible service.  Came for a light dinner just after 4 pm.  First server took our order in the usual course and then turned us over to another server as she was going off shift.  That's where the trouble started.  Although we only ordered eggs, 50 minutes went by and the food came only after we asked.  Unfortunately, we had 3 diners, but only two of our choices arrived.  The runner left in a rush and no one came to check.  We had to flag down the server (took 10 minutes) and then the third entre came.  We had to again flag down the server for the check, which took another ten minutes when we were seated.  No one ever refilled our water. Food was good, but the service makes this two stars"
Tammy F.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,18,3,1.0,2/27/2016,"Ordered to go food at 5, still waiting and not one person has asked me or told me anything. But if I was sitting down in the restaurant I'm sure I would get my food in less than 30 minutes. There is 20 Indians and No Chief! Smh  so I just went to go ask if my food was ready and the bag has been sitting there for a good 13 minutes that she didn't even know was my bag!"
Alyssa M.,"San Clemente, CA",237,9,2,3.0,6/20/2016,First time at this Cheesecake Factory location. Ordered the fried Mac and cheese balls which is my regular dish but this time they were served like warm and I could tell they were sitting under a food warmer for a while. Service was okay but could have been better. Water wasn't filled once and the server wasn't too busy so there wasn't an excuse. She was nice but just not on top of her game. Might try this place again and will write another review based on the service of a second trip.
Nette C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",6,46,82,4.0,6/7/2015,"My husband and I came here on Sat pass 6pm there was a wait, it wasn't that bad we waited for 15mins to get seated. We ordered 16oz: Blue Moon $6 and Pyramid Hefeweizen Draft $6.50 22oz: Sierra Nevada and Stella Artois $8.50  Crispy crab bites and Ahi tartare for $6.95 each Skinny salmon rolls $10.95 and soy-glazed edamame $4.95. The food was good and our server Mark O was friendly and did an awesome job serving us."
Aj P.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",3,1,,5.0,2/13/2015,"The Manager, Kirk, helped me to put together the perfect marriage proposal last night. My gf flew in late from LV and we weren't able to show up until 5 minutes before closing. I was able to take balloons and gifts before hand in which he stored in the back and had it all set up in a private room for us. My fiance was so surprised and wanted to cry.   Our server, Paris, was unbelievably kind and accommodating and the kitchen put together an amazing meal for us.    They had our seating set up beautifully and came out with great food and closed it all off with dessert that was to-die-for. And add in a wedding proposal that was just perfect.   I cannot thank Kirk, Paris and all those that helped to make this a memorable evening for my fiance and I.    Everyone needs to go visit these guys because they rock!!!"
Jessica L.,"Irvine, CA",0,23,11,4.0,6/28/2014,"I really like this place. The service is good...nothing special about it but it was good. The food is really nice! My personal favorite is the miso salmon with brown rice and broccoli (instead of snow peas). I get it every time I go! The salmon is so soft and moist. The sauces (one brown one white) are delicious together with the salmon. There's a nice little top of green onions which I personally can't to without. And all this is on top of some white or brown rice. I usually go for the brown rice for the nice texture difference it adds to the dish. If you don't have enough sauce, ask for more! It's such a delicious dish if you like cooked salmon! A must have! The scenery looked really nice too. There are pretty painted designs on the arches and ceiling that are nice to look at.  I just really hate how crowded this place gets sometimes. It's a popular place which makes me want to avoid it during eating time. Oh well. It can't be helped. Overall, 4 stars for delicious food, okay service, nice ambiance, and being located right in the mall (so one can go walking right after eating!)."
Joy L.,"San Diego, CA",389,71,39,2.0,4/11/2015,"Mehhh...really disappointed with the menu changes recently. My favorite shrimp and bacon club has been taken off and the waitress suggested the chicken club...mehhh. It was dry and lacking the flavor like the other sandwich. Cheesecake Factory has been going down for years in general, so I doubt we will be back. Good iced tea though"
Dawn A.,"Irvine, CA",1805,336,869,3.0,2/13/2014,There are a lot of good things on the menu here but nothing great that stands out. I had the chipotle chicken sandwich today my girlfriend had the kale salad (new item) and we shared the avacado egg rolls. Everything was good. Service was excellent and there was no wait.
JD R.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",486,86,13,5.0,1/30/2016,"I hate chain restaurants. Cheesecake Factory is the exception. They have very consistently good food and a few exceptional items on the menu. Funny thing is that their actual cheesecakes aren't all that spectacular. Swift and smiling service, not too loud... that's how I like it. Get there early on weekend nights."
MaryAnne B.,"New Bern, NC",32,14,9,5.0,4/13/2016,"Great service.  The restaurant was packed with the lunch time rush and my husband and I sat in the booth tables in the bar area. Michael served every table and worked the bar by himself without leaving anyone waiting or wanting. Great service,  thanks Michael!"
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,4.0,11/25/2013,"While Christmas shopping with the hubby, we were starved and were pleasantly surprised to see The Cheesecake Factory.   There was a 20 min wait.  We got buzzed in 25 minutes.  Our waiter Mark was pleasant and helpful even though he seemed super busy (covering a huge area).   We ordered... Beach Bellini - yummy! Pomegranate Mojito - pretty good White bean hummus - I liked it but my husband loved it and the flat bread the imitated pita bread. Ahi Tartare - smaller than other locations but still tasty Crispy Crab Bites - Delicious!! Basil Tomato Flat bread - yummy as always! Since it was a super busy night, I'll not let the rating be skewed by not having the pizza cut when it arrived to the table and one item we ordered never came.  It was still a good experience.  Will be back again during this shopping season."
Mosellé R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,4,,2.0,3/31/2016,"Use to love this place, but the quality has really derailed. Extremely sour cheese on the pizza, and the avocado eggrolls did not have consistent taste. Some were extremely sour and others were too sweet. Won't come here again :("
Stacey S.,"Long Beach, CA",686,491,1742,2.0,10/21/2013,"This place caused my boyfriend and I to have serious waiter envy. We had Diego as a waiter, but really wanted Sophia who helped the table next to us. Sophia was a ray of sunshine and rainbows. Diego was so dull and lifeless. He really didn't seem to enjoy his job. It was as if his brain went out to lunch and didn't come back. Whenever he talked to us he had his feet turned and would leave before we were done talking, he didn't tell us specials, he didn't ask if we wanted dessert, we had to ask to have our food boxed up, and he was gone most of the night (yet clearly visible). The food was good, but that's the chef's job, not his. You'd think such a big chain would care more about how their staff present themselves."
Christopher S.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/20/2016,Their service is little slow. Hard to get server's attention. I stick with what I always get. Food is pretty good though. My wife loves cheesecake here.. although it seems like size is keep getting smaller and smaller..
Yasmin N.,"Bellevue, WA",164,35,5,4.0,1/24/2016,I just love the food.  It is so good.  The waitress was very kind and a pleasure to have.
