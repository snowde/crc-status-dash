Rob W.,"Huntington Beach, CA",327,441,710,2.0,10/17/2012,"Went to celebrate a few birthdays.  I tried the Fresh Ahi Seared and Served Rare with Avocado, Tomato and Mixed Greens Tossed with Wasabi Vinaigrette.  The salad was excellent, but there wasn't much of it.  The pieces of seared ahi tuna looked nothing like they show on their website.  The pieces were very small, unevenly cut, but we're still flavorful.  The tomatoes were very hard and the waitress brought out three sets of tomatoes.  They were still hard and mot tender at all. This salad was featured on their SkinnyLicious Menu and was supposed to be under 600 calories.  I did try a small taste of the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake and it was light and flavorful.  I guess I expected a bit more from Cheesecake Factory, but then again it's a chain and it seems things are not as good as they used to be. *Featured on our SkinnyLicious™ Menu *Featured on our SkinnyLicious™ Menu"
Diana P.,"Orange County, CA",271,84,24,5.0,10/9/2015,"We come here almost every other day we love it!! Cheesecake has the biggest menu ever. Pretty much anything you order is delicious. What we love about cheesecake is its doesn't matter what location you go to even out of state. We have been to cheesecake in Las Vegas, San Francisco and Oregon the food all taste the same."
John P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",101,102,161,4.0,9/15/2014,The Cheesecake Factory is always consistent both with service and food.  The Chicken Madeira and the Miso Salmon are my two favorites.
Julia R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,24,1,1.0,8/11/2016,"Came here because it sounded good and the other locations are great & satisfying, but wow were we wrong. Took a really long time to get our food, they were out of a main ingredient on my sisters meal, & my food was almost cold. Oh, and the bread was hard and stale-not appetizing! Plates were dirty too. We usually want cheesecake after a meal here and we were so put off by the food that we decided against it. Disappointed."
Jeff B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",585,81,109,5.0,10/12/2014,"Great Cheesecake Factory location. Kid friendly and adult friendly. If you are watching your weight, they have a skinnylicious menu with some awesome low cal meals. I get the Asian lettuce tacos, similar to the Thai lettuce wrap plate, but only $6.99! If you have kids, they have free baby plates. This location has indoor and outdoor seething. Probably will have to order your cheesecake to go because the meals are so big, and the free bread fills you up."
Anamarie T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",32,109,26,5.0,11/6/2013,"We got seated right away. Minus points for dirty dishes on the table. The server James is on his game. Refilling drinks, clearing the table and bringing to toddler plate for my 13 month old son. Food was served nice and hot. Added points for not putting the hot plate on front of my 4 year old. This was were our first date dinner wa. As always a great anniversary dinner. Thank you  cheesecake. You rock."
Jerry M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",98,16,9,2.0,7/25/2014,"Typical chain restaurant... Food was good.  Waiter was clearly annoyed we didn't order an entree.  Like he knew it was not going to be a big bill. Overall service was poor at best, even for a mall restaurant.  Biggest mistake of the evening... No appetizer plates... And no plates for the artichoke leaves.  Seriously, I would have paid a healthy tip for good service, maybe a water refill, and a plate... Not too much to ask, no?"
Mike B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/3/2016,"Ordered two salads ""to-go"" on a Sunday night. When I arrived home, we realized they gave us a wrong salad. Full disclosure- they did show me the salads but I didn't really inspect them. Bad mistake. My wife called to request the salad she wanted and spoke with Amy whom said she was the manager. Amy was extremely rude and defensive over the phone, I could feel my wife's blood pressure rising which is hard to do. We didn't care if we had to pay for the 3rd salad, but Amy almost made it impossible to order and made us feel as if we were deliberately lying to her. It's too bad as we like TCF but will drive the extra distance to go to the one in Irvine from now on."
Carrie P.,"Dana Point, CA",6,18,2,5.0,1/31/2016,Had 2 new items on the Brunch menu-chicken & waffle eggs Benedict yummie plus the small plate meatballs with sauce & cheese toast.  Omg. Loved them both
Dawn F.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",123,94,72,5.0,9/25/2014,"This is always our go-to family restaurant.  There is something for everyone and the food is always good, the cheesecakes rock.  I try to order something different each time , since we go so often.  Yesterday we tried the shepherd's pie.  I have had it before once, years ago.  It is absolutely delicious, great sauce, just enough meat to veggies ratio and the parmesan topped potatoes are yummy.   We had enough room for cheesecake, so my husband and I split the banana cheesecake.  Its absolutely delicious! I recommend anyone who hasn't eaten here, do it.  You won't be sorry!"
Nate M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",114,107,67,4.0,5/2/2014,"Shopping at the mall and very hungry. Luckily The Cheesecake Factory was near by. So we ducked in for some grub. Two glances of Melbec, the bread (very good and very unhealthy - packed w/ sugar), and one bang bang chicken and shrimp dish (it's massive so one is all you need for two). It comes with rice in the center, surrounded by a spiced curry. Sorry no picture. My wife dug in before I could pull out my phone and snap one.  You always get a pretty good service regardless is which location is what I've noticed. They are very well run and very process oriented. Good for work dinners or to bring the family. Not the most romantic or unique place, however. But still good."
Darlene J.,"Gig Harbor, WA",48,309,25,5.0,8/12/2015,"This is by far the BEST Cheesecake Factory around! Mike is fantastic (in the bar) along with Oscar & they know exactly what we like to drink! I use to get the house cab but lately I've been enjoying the Raspberry Mojito's. This is no longer on the bar list, but Mike will always make it for me. These 2 are super they always have the time to stop & talk. OK, now the food....Always good never a complaint from me & the skinny menu is really very good. The Tuscan Chicken is delicious!"
Ali B.,"San Dimas, CA",81,76,262,3.0,10/6/2014,"It was my first time trying a Cheesecake factory out of Texas. I found the portions much smaller and the quality lower. However, the servers and the ambient was OK."
Ryan M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",45,87,20,3.0,9/3/2014,"Everyone knows that Cheesecake Factory serves large portions, has a huge menu, and doesn't take reservations, so I won't address either of these things in my review.  This location is part of the Mission Viejo mall, and as such is frequented by many mallgoers including myself. If you go there any day after 5:30pm for dinner, expect that there will likely be a wait to get a table. Plan accordingly or go earlier. There isn't much sitting space either for the wait, so you might have to stand if there are a lot of people in front of you. Luckily it's at a mall, so you can shop while you wait as long as someone stays within range of the radio device.  The waiters and waitresses are all friendly that we have had and most of the time the food comes out quick. I really enjoy the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken - it comes with a generous amount of Chicken. I also enjoy their Shrimp Scampi when I am looking for a change of pace.  With the size of the meals here, it always surprises me how anyone has room for dessert... =P Tl;dr: 3 Stars and of course I would come back if I was hungry for a large meal."
Nicole R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",268,11,7,1.0,12/8/2015,Eating here and the server wasn't very tenant. When I chased her down for butter her supervised accused me of drinking too much. Lol I've had two cocktails. Fuck them
Andalee M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,5,4,1.0,1/6/2016,Absolutely terrible. Don't order the shrimp tacos for $14.50 you'll get a hard shell you can't bite through and frozen shrimps that have been over cooked. It was spicy and dry....had to ask for a sauce so I could bite through the dry shell. Waitress didn't even take it off our bill when I told her it was terrible and sent it back. Steer clear of this dish....
Ashley D.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",426,7,,1.0,4/18/2015,Love the food (then again it's nothing special) and most waiters are good but I have had so many mishaps at this Resturant from messed up orders and mis recently after THEIR employee told me I could eat my TO GO order at the bar was grabbed by the back and rudely told to leave.  The manager at this location and her higher up boss are terrible business people and have been so unbelievably rude to us that my family and all my friends refuse to support this business any longer.
Michael R.,"Oceanside, CA",6,124,95,3.0,10/2/2015,"Great pie, service good, grandpa  likes it so we are good.  Large  menu so allot  to chose  from."
JG T.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/12/2015,"Don't know what happened to this place. 4pm, restarán half empty and our food took 40 minutes to come....and returned not made well!  A freeking burger and some tacos. Any way, it took two managers and and general manager to finally bring some sanaty to all this. It felt like I was at a car dealership trying to strike a deal. Unbelievable."
Craig H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",15,87,3,4.0,12/9/2015,The same C F fare in the MV Mall.  a great choice when it's raining; park in the garage!
