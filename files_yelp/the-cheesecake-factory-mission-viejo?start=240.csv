Jason M.,"Lake Forest, CA",4,18,2,2.0,1/8/2014,"My wife and I just celebrated our 8 year anniversary and decided to go to the Cheescase Factory for dinner. I know that it is not the most elegant location for an anniversary dinner, but we wanted to go somewhere that held a special place in our relationship, and ironically, all those elegant restaurants that did have a special place in our relationship have all gone out of business. Having just returned that day from vacation with my family, we felt the Cheesecake Factory would suffice, until the staff ruined our customer experience. This is a place I take my family on a regular basis, but this particular location struggles with service.  Tonight was the perfect example of why I intend not to return to this particular Cheesecake Factory. The experience began by sitting at the booth for 11 minutes before we were ever greeted by anyone. And that initial greeting was a bus boy dropping off some bread at the table without even uttering a word and then running off to the next task. More than 5 additional minutes passed before our waiter introduced himself. At that time we placed our order which included waters with lemon. He returns with the water but of course no lemon - not a huge deal but certainly the first clue that our waiter was not listening to us. And he dropped them off so fast that we did not have an opportunity to even ask for straws. I found it odd that straws were not automatically included, and they expected us to drink from the big mugs that they serve. When he finally returned, and we asked for straws, he said it no longer their policy to automatically include straws in the drinks, and that we would have to go find some. After he finally returned with straws, and my son's strawberry lemonade, we placed our order - this took almost 25 minutes from the time we sat down! When our order arrived, both my son's and wife's orders were wrong, but we were so annoyed by the service and time it took to get food, that we simply accepted it.  What put me over the top and inspired me to write this review was when my son had finished his strawberry lemonade, the waiter asked if he wanted another one, and we told him that a glass of water would be fine - instead of returned with a water glass, the waiter poured water into his strawberry lemonade glass!  There are other Cheesecake Factories in South OC, avoid this one because their standards, service, and obviously management is extremely sub-par."
Kylie R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/20/2016,Just discovered they have curb side pick up. Bread Chinese chicken salad Mac n cheese and butter for lunch! Yum! Passed on the amazing cheesecake this time.
Sarah F.,"Anaheim, CA",2,20,26,1.0,6/23/2015,"So I have always had problems with this cheesecake factory for some reason. If it wasn't for the chicken belagio I would never return. I ordered on the phone and the lady fought me on the fact they don't have a ""secret sauce"" when in fact they do. Its on their menu. Her response was ""we definitely don't have a secret sauce"" in a rude tone. I then asked for thousand island and she put me on hold to check about the secret sauce and I already was moved past that and asked for thousand island. She then comes back after I was put on hold again just to tell me they do have a secret sauce. So I told her I would just take thousand island like I requested earlier. I asked to speak to a manager and she said in a rude tone ""I am a manager."" Wow cheesecake factory, I thought you hired good quality workers not low class rude ones. I also was told pick up would be at 8:30 (20 minutes) i waited a total of 45 minutes for my food and i already gave my payment!! Won't be returning after this visit."
Layla B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",212,28,5,4.0,1/12/2014,"Update -  Came back here for my friends birthday and DIDN'T get pasta. Better choice for sure. I got a bacon cheeseburger (my favorite) since I decided to stick to my basics because of my experience last time. It was very good. Service was kind of lagging and that was very annoying. We got ""Chris's"" cheesecake and it was basically like a German chocolate cake. Pretty good experience & food all around except for service and wait time"
Michaela F.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",2,1,,1.0,1/2/2015,"In my life I have never had such rude service at a restaurant. The standard I expect from Cheesecake Factory is high due to the price you pay for your meal. Therefore, a nice hostess would be much appreciated for this not-really-worth-while place. Also, after waiting 55 min for a table to be set on a Friday afternoon, it would be nice not to be seated in some stranger's lap. Although sugar coating it with a snarky ""take this or wait longer"" was a value added touch. Bravo, hostess of the day. I say take your hard-earned money somewhere  that actually would like to have you as a loyal customer. Peace out Mission Viejo Mall Cheesecake Factory."
Aimee P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",39,53,24,3.0,4/30/2015,"After the aweful experience I had at thus location, I would like to say I did give them another shot not to shabby. They seemed to be on less of an emotional roller coaster and more ready to provide good customer service. Improvements appriciated."
Reeko T.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,17,,2.0,2/10/2015,"Came here for our daughter's birthday and they gave us patio sitting. Apparently that's where all the employees of the restaurant and according to the manager employees of the mall have their designated smoking area is within few feet is as well. Although our dinner was way past mall hours and I saw a bunch of servers go out there and smoke, she said there is nothing she could do about it. Well, how about at least asking your own employees not to smoke out there or let your customers know in advance that if you sit out here you will smell smoke."
Vicki E.,"Brawley, CA",82,201,62,4.0,4/1/2015,Huge menu - maybe too big. Luckily our waiter told us to look on page 8 for the lunch menu. (There's also a brunch menu and a dinner menu and a skinny menu - you get the idea). Service was quick and food was tasty.
Eugene H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",72,6,2,1.0,8/25/2015,The worst taco plate I've ever had in my life. The only thing good about that dish was the bread that came before the meal
Akiko I.,"Orange County, CA",1460,1443,13972,3.0,7/15/2013,"- Locale Destination -  It's on Marguerite Pkwy and Shops Blvd in Mission Viejo.  It's in the ""The Shops at Mission Viejo"" - shopping mall. They open till 11pm, which is later than other places in the mall! Decor is like any other Cheesecake Factory. Little dim, heavy and rich decor. Bar and counter for cheesecakes. Lots of seating. Prompt service, but not so considerate enough to warn me about the ridiculous portion sizes..  - Gluttony Expedition -  It comes with lots of breads (free).. The food was so big already and do you still need breads??? Lots of gym time even if you had a high metabolism...  Crusted chicken with basil spaghetti: The chicken was breaded and deep fried. Well cooked (big 2pieces). Pasta was lightly seasoned with pesto sauce. Good dish! So big - it's good for 2 adults! Santa Fe salad: It was gigantic - literally a BOWL of salad. I could barely finish the half. Corn, black beans, chicken, and decent dressing with LOTS of crunchy string chips. Not bad.  - Conqueror's Deduction -  I had a cheese cake before at Cheesecake Factory, but never eaten the meal here. Foods were unexpectedly not bad for the big chain restaurants (though I'm not a fan of those chains). It was a lot better than PF Chang or Denny's for sure. I wondered why they always had a long line.. Now I know!  But the ridiculously huge portion is definitely helping this ""obesity"" nation. I wondered why they had ""half salad"" on the menu... I didn't think ""Regular"" size salad was an enormous BOWL of salad. Great to share, but the server should have mentioned it when she saw me I wasn't a gigantic person. I've never come to eat here and didn't know about this crazy portion.... Pasta dish was for 2 people, too. Entrees are like $14 to mid $20. You have no problem sharing one plate with 2 adults. These ""popular for people in general"" restaurants should be more concerned about the healthy diet. One order doesn't need to be ""TWO ADULT"" size. If the size were intended for one person, it is as bad as ""McDonald's"" diet..  I use a ""doggy bag"" but am not a fan of it. I don't wanna eat ""left over"" meal because the taste quality would totally sink compared with the ""fresh"" one. They should cut the portion and price so that we can avoid using a ""doggy bag"" and control the amount of intake.   I don't mind coming back here to eat, but I'll share the dish definitely!  Great for a big party since it's so easy to share."
Diana K.,"Irvine, CA",43,38,3,3.0,8/20/2014,I love the cheesecake but ever time that I am there the service taking to long.  And the staff  never know what to recommend for.  For my luck I always enjoy the food.  Hope that the taking this to the good way and learn from it

D H.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/11/2016,Everyone knows this place is great!!!!  That's why there are always lines...  Check out the Chinese chicken salad or the Chicken scallopini with pasta!  Sooooooooooooo Good!

Amber H.,"Agoura Hills, CA",234,97,49,4.0,10/21/2014,"Gotta love the Cheesecake Factory! This one is attached to the mission viejo mall so depending on when you go you could have some issues finding parking. Other than that...friendly staff, delicious food (get the shrimp scampi...trust me. It's amazing!) and awesome drinks. The decor is always super nice in there and makes it feel just a bit fancier than it really is. Great for a date night, girls night or family night. Will definitely be going there again!"
Michelle M.,"Irvine, CA",1220,350,2397,4.0,6/13/2011,"Awesome service here!! And it also helps that it is located right inside the Mission Viejo mall where shopping can be done either before or after your meal! I used to come to this Cheesecake all the time when I was in High School and will be visiting here again more often now that MV mall has practically every store that I could ask for in one place and it is MUCH less of a wait here compared to the Spectrum.  On a Saturday night at 6:30 pm, wait was only 10-15 minutes.  Not bad at all! Service is amazing- they greet you with a smile, efficient, consistently refill drinks w/o even asking, our waiter didn't miss a beat.  Awesome! If you love meat- get the Kobe burger with swiss cheese, the mushrooms on the burger tastes so sweet and yummy! I would love to give this place 5 stars, but they can never seem to un-stick-ify the menus.  I don't like feeling grease when I'm flipping through the menu.  Other than that, great location, great environment, great service, great food!"
Sharon H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",2,59,21,4.0,3/15/2015,"Great happy hour, just crowded and popular. If you get there early, you will enjoy your time. Otherwise, you may wait for a table and may not get one by the time happy hour is over. Everything on happy hour is good and of course the bread they serve beforehand is yummy. I recommend the brown bread over the french white bread. Parking is more difficult as it gets more crowded as well, but they do have valet of  course if you are desperate."
Tony L.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",132,46,23,5.0,5/7/2013,"Always consistent on food quality and service. Try to avoid lunch rushes and also table 15.  When the air conditioner is on it shakes the roof and the light that is on this table and gives it a blinking effect which can be annoying. The food, service, and choices are top notch"
Kt G.,"Laguna Beach, CA",7,90,42,3.0,12/27/2014,"What to say? Busy chain restaurant with a menu full of high calorie interpretations of comfort food that we've all enjoyed through the years. Food is good, portions are ample. Cheesecake Factory is not the place to come for a gourmet meal. Having said that, it's a fun place for a large group."
Sara B.,"Wheaton, IL",12,1658,13,4.0,10/30/2011,"I am not the biggest fan of chain restaurants that being said....The Cheesecake Factory is a place you can go. The menu although is too large, so thank you to the people that made the ""skinny"" menu. One a healthier option and two a much more condensed menu to choose from. Still many items to ponder. The veggie burger was pretty good. I like the flavor combos they have with it. The tuna takaki salad was also pretty decent, a little flavorless on the wasabi but still yum And as always the cheesecake is great. DON'T order a slice alone. We shared one slice and still took 1/2 home.  There is NO need for anyone to eat a whole slice of that stuff on their own..."
