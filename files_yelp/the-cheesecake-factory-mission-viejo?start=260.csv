Brianne J.,"San Diego, CA",54,38,,1.0,8/23/2014,I usually love cheesecake but I don't know if I will go back.. We waiting 20 minutes after we were sat just to be greeted for drinks.. 30 minutes later the waiter shows up to take our order and 40 minutes (maybe more) our food finally comes.. So the appetizer never came and the food plates were hotter than the food. That tells you the food stayed under the lamp for quite some time and the food was actually luke warm.. We were so hungry we ate but definitely let the waiter know it was a pathetic dinner.. He had no problem getting the manager who comped the kids meals and offered dessert.. Really! It was horrible food and she knew exactly how long we waited.. She apologized have no reasons why our food was so bad and just offered us a dessert and free kids meals.. Oh and the women's bathroom was flooded to which she just said it was a problem in the entire mall.. Ugh! Won't be going back
john g.,"Irvine, CA",2,19,9,3.0,1/2/2014,3.75 stars for overall experience. I like sitting at the small bar.  Couple flat screens and Sierra Nevada on draft. Good free bread too. They serve everything you can think of.  Boss paid for meal so I had a real good time.  Cheers
Margaret K.,"Seattle, WA",88,2,,1.0,3/9/2016,"Our server was definitely rushing us so she could leave.  She asked about the check several times shortly after dropping it off.  Then she disappeared after she'd been paid, without even filling up our drinks or asking someone else to check on us.  She definitely left for the night while we were still seated."
Kathleen S.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",43,149,388,4.0,8/21/2013,"Big portions and good food if you pick the right items. Since the sizes are so big, I generally stick to the small plates and appetizer pages. Here are some recomdations: LOVE: Beets with Goat Cheese - yum, light, refreshing and tasty Fried Macaronis and Cheese - yum, on the heavy and rich side Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes - I can't ever finish it, on the rich side as well Good: Roadside Sliders: These use to be better, sometimes they are overcooked and dried out now, but they are nice and thin and make a good meal if you get some fries with them too Tex Mex Eggrolls: Not outstanding ,but good, liked the green sauce with them Firecracker Salmon: Salmon in deepfried wantons, good but unlike every other dish at Cheesecake, this one doesn't fill me up at all.  So So Sad Cheesecake Took Off the Menu:  Vietnamese Tacos - I have reviewed these before and was so upset to learn on my last visit they had been taken off the menu! They were soooooo good. I was craving them, they were the only reason I actually went to Cheesecake that day. The rivaled much fancier restaurants."
Catherine H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",25,18,21,4.0,9/6/2013,Big portions and reasonably price food. Simply grilled salmon are my personal favorite. Their chicken soup is very filling and tasty! Their four cheese pasta is amazing cheesy and yummy. Bellagio chicken is good for two and is refreshing yet tasty! Overall a great place to eat for a lunch but nothing really special.
Yessi L.,"San Clemente, CA",0,11,6,5.0,3/2/2015,"I was there last night! Party of five , our waiter/waitress was Zack and Ellen everything was awesome from the moment they sat us down to the moment where they packed our dessert to go! Ellen was funny and super nice and Zack was fast and attentive  food was super good too try the Factory nachos!!"
KD M.,"Orange County, CA",2,73,129,3.0,1/19/2015,"My boyfriend finally decided to use a Cheesecake Factory gift card we received for Christmas, and made the decision to go to the Mission Viejo location, which would be less crowded than the Spectrum's location. We ordered their fried cheese appetizer, which was not as hot as we'd like, but we didn't complain about it. I ordered their catfish plate, and it seemed as if the fish was overcooked, making the crust a little dark and crunchier than it should have been; same with my boyfriend's fried shrimp. I had a card for a free slice of cheesecake, and boy, have the slices gotten way smaller than what they use to be. Granted, I hadn't been to CF in probably 5 years, and it's not as great as it use to be. We had cocktails, which was good, but I'll probably go back, but order different entrees."
Sophearith K.,"Laguna Hills, CA",98,43,31,5.0,11/19/2014,"I always come here and sit at the bar, the shepherd's pie is really good.   There are actually a lot of entrées that is really good, like the Cuban pork sandwich it is one of my favorite.   Most appetizers and small plates are around 5 bucks,  cannot go wrong there!"
Mikah B.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",8,5,1,1.0,9/19/2015,I would give zero stars if it was possible. Honestly my husband and I always go to Cheesecake Factory for date nights at the spectrum and will continue that. This was the first time we decided to order from his location. I called to order curb side pick up and when I  spoke to the employee AMY she was so rude and rushed me to the point i couldn't even get what I  wanted out of my mouth. Amy went on saying they were really busy and curb side would be 15 minutes or longer and the same if I were to just pick it up inside. She ending the call by saying are you going to order or not? I hung up I was so mad. I decided to go in to pick it up and there was 3 people in front of me ordering cheesecake from the bakery and was still out in the matter of 7 minutes. This will be the last time I go there.
Roya K.,"Anaheim, CA",16,5,5,4.0,5/15/2015,"The best costumer service, the guy with a British accent was the nicest. The plate was sooooo big but the dish was pretty good , got the Louisiana chicken pasta"
Carolyn A.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",3,16,,3.0,9/21/2015,I love their food so of course I come back. This last experience however has me second guessing. I took my family and multiple pieces of silverware had food and debris on them. The manager was very apologetic but the waitress could care less and was not helpful at all. She most likely was new at serving so hopefully she will improve one day. Cheesecake Factory check your dishwashing system and tell your staff to check items that are supposed to be sanitary BEFORE putting them on the table.
Nick S.,"Dana Point, CA",4,15,4,2.0,3/22/2013,"This review is mostly to serve as a heads up to management who may be reading. On Saturday the 16th I went to The Cheesecake Factory with my wife, our 2 year-old son and 2 other people. Things started out great. We were seated quickly, the server was a friendly young man who gave us quick and courteous service. He brought my son a child-style cup with water in it, as well as making his meal into the child version (even though we hadn't asked for it, or known about that option). So far so good. We ordered some appetizers before the main course. Ours came out, but there was some issue with our friends' app (we were told it was made wrong at first but then someone else said it was sent to the wrong table...weird). We waited patiently. The appetizer came out in about 10 minutes, and it WAS delicious. At this point, though, I personally would have expected the main course to have come out pretty soon after that, considering this last appetizer was late and we'd finished ours (plus we have a toddler, and ANY server worth his/her salt knows that parents don't want to entertain kids in a restaurant for any longer than necessary). So we waited. And waited. We were offered more bread at one point, which felt like the server KNEW things were taking too long. Bread AFTER the first round AND appetizers. For me, it took long enough that I felt like we should have been leaving, and not getting a main course. It just felt awkward...like we'd been through all the steps, except we hadn't. I had originally considered dessert but I didn't even really want to be there anymore. I ended up leaving with my son, and taking him to the play area, while the others finished up. He was tired of sitting (and honestly so was I). The food arrived as I was getting up, but at that point I was just over it. If I'd stayed I would have asked for some sort of discount or something. I'm not typically that guy but it just wasn't a smooth experience. You know those when you feel them. This was one of them. When I finally got to eat my chicken caesar salad later that night, it WAS good. But the in-restaurant experience left much to be desired with all the waiting, the two different stories about the appetizer, no acknowledgment or apology that things were taking quite long and the general feeling that we'd been forgotten about . If there's a next time maybe I'll get to try some cheesecake."
David M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",55,49,11,5.0,5/12/2015,Great place for lunch and dinner whether it be a group or just two...food is great and there's outdoor patio dining as well.
Alex J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,50,2,4.0,9/9/2013,"19 times out of 20, this place is great. My grandmother lives really close to this place so we come 3-4 times a month. It's either here or PF Chang's pretty much. I've only had a problem when I come here when they've just opened. This happened a couple of times, I felt like the head chef hadn't showed up yet and an assistant was overseeing the cooking of our food. It just wasn't right. Usually the staff are very attentive and the food is excellent. I'd give 4.5 out of 5 stars if I could. Almost perfect!"
Catalina Z.,"Newport Beach, CA",41,33,21,4.0,7/31/2013,"One of my boyfriends favorite restaurants, I'm not going to lie I've only been here a couple of times where as people who dine here come numerous of times, but the place is slowly growing on me.   Last night we came in, and this location at the Mission Viejo Mall is always packed but never too packed you feel uncomfortable, the atmosphere is just right always running smoothly. Luckily thanks to Yelp found out that not only was it National Cheesecake Day, but we would be one the first people to ever try there new S'mores Galore Cheesecake, okay but we didn't try the new cheesecake, we got something just as decadent though, their Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, holy moly so good melts in your mouth,  For Dinner I tried their Egg Plant sandwich, hands down perfection on the grilling of the red onions and bell peppers, the aioli sauce was delicious too not to much to drown the flavor of it all, my boyfriend is a fan on their sliders each and every one of them but last night he had their stuffed chicken tortillas a mixture of enchiladas/quesadillas/tacos, talk about stuffed"
Amy L.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",25,6,8,4.0,12/14/2014,"Here right now. The food is great, waiter is great. The staff is very professional. I give them 4 stars because the bartender took forever with our drinks because I ordered a draft beer and I'm not sure if he knows how to pour it. The ranch tastes different also. Other than that it's great :)"
Laina A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",483,696,935,3.0,8/13/2012,"It was scorching hot at The Shops at Mission Viejo, think over 90's outside.  When asked by the host at Cheesecake Factory if we wanted to sit outside, I gave him a look of are you kidding? But apparently there were others that enjoyed baking and roasting, but I was not one of them.  I prefer the Irvine Spectrum location, don't know why ... just do. I tried a new item, one of the burgers and it was ok-fine, but not really for the price.  When paying $10 and up for a burger, I expect a lot more.  I also do not like the overly dark golden brown crispy fries. I saw nobody in my small group ranting over their food, in fact one barely ate.  Luckily, service was awesome and our waiter was quick on the iced tea refills, including getting all who wanted a to go cup of iced tea, so he was definitely rewarded with a great tip!"
Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2246,2841,1478,5.0,9/13/2010,"I still haven't learned how to fairly rank chains. So much of the rating is based upon the decor, the menu, the 'business model' if you will... and since the Cheesecake Factory is so standardized, you've been to one, you've been to 'em all. That being said, there's some damned good stuff on the menu! Tex-mex egggrolls are badass. The Louisiana chicken pasta is amazing. The Bistro Shrimp pasta is perhaps even better. Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp is a homerun. I STILL miss the Shrimp Po' Boy and wish they'd bring it back. Nothing left to review it on except service. Both of the ladies attending to our table were beautiful, personable, attentive, and prompt. Really couldn't improve upon their performance. Great lunch, great time, great location."
Gabriel C.,"Long Beach, CA",26,5,,1.0,5/10/2014,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. the service and management are terrible. my party and I called in advance to let them know we would be on our way with our party of eight. they informed me that they didn't take reservations which was fine, so I asked for the wait and it was about 25-30 minutes. my party and I arrived and they told us the wait was 2 hours. they also were not problems solvers so we ended up leaving. I will never come here again."
Cat A.,"Orange County, CA",131,47,7,2.0,12/8/2015,The worse Chicken Marsala I have ever had. Bow tie pasta just tasted like butter noodles also very dry there was very little sauce on the dish and the little sauce I could taste had absolutely no flavor at all not even a hint of Marsala flavor. I was super disappointed with this dish. I did ask the server for more sauce and she said it would take about 5 min because they make it from scratch she didn't ask how we liked our dinner and it was late we were tired so I just asked her for a to go box thinking I would just had my own Marsala sauce the next day so it wouldn't be wasted. Also order the steak Diane and Salmon my fiancé said Salmon was good but the Steak Diane lacked flavor and sauce was bla. We were very disappointed. I do love the bread and apps here. Also salads are good.
