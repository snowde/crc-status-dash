B T.,"Irvine, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/23/2015,"Worst experience of my life! I've been going to Cheesecake for as long as I can remember and now I will never go back. Martin has to be the rudest individual I've ever came across. I ordered a glass of wine right when I sat down and I ended up getting my food before my wine. I had to ask for my wine again.. Martin proceeded to roll his eyes at me as if I was annoying him. Then we ordered dessert with extra fudge. We got our bill and there was a charge for the fudge which we were never told about. I told Martin and he ripped the bill out of my hand, rolled his eyes then walked away. I was so furious at this point I was shaking. I asked to speak with the manager Patrick. Patrick came over and was just as bad as Martin.  Patrick didn't do anything to make us feel comfortable about the situation. I'm a new mom with a newborn baby so when I have time to go out its a treat and I expect to be treated with respect. I will be writing a letter to corporate! I'm convinced that Martin and Patrick are buddies. Beware of this place."
Alana T.,"Irvine, CA",9,179,115,5.0,9/25/2014,"This location seems to have the best staff and food out of all the other locations.  Especially if you have Lucy in the bakery make your sundae or prepare your dessert.  She is warm, friendly and sweet as the desserts in that pasty showcase.  We had a great meal, topped with her Godiva brownie sundae.  Let's just say, I never had a dessert this good in  my life!!  Try it, and ask for Lucy!!!"
Ashley V.,"Lake Forest, CA",2,23,8,5.0,12/18/2013,I was in here for lunch yesterday with my sister! We both had the jambalya which is by far my favorite thing on the menu. Our server PARIS was an absolute sweetheart We had amazing service I could not have asked for anything better.
David J.,"Bellevue, WA",9,117,,3.0,8/3/2014,"Good overall, seated quickly, decent menu, service reasonable and food decent so just as expected really for a quick serve mall restaurant, really more 3.5 stars as no real issues just basic good overall."
Tatyana Y.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",130,14,4,4.0,9/8/2013,"Loved it! A definite place for sharing dishes since the portions are so big. This afternoon I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.They are soooo delish!! They are these buttermilk thin, lemony, sweet pancakes with lemon zest, powdered sugar & fresh strawberries on top, served with warm, real maple syrup on the side. I think I was in heaven when I was eating them. I wished I had room in my tummy to finish them all but I couldn't. I'm even craving them while I'm writing this! Now that's sad! LOL. I already need to work out extra hard manana for eating that today but I cldn't help myself ; ) My other fave are the avocado eggrolls. There are a lot of them and I was on a date there recently & I ate all of them. There was nothing left. I had no shame ; ) Even though they are an appetizer, you can definitely just order those for a meal.  PLUS they have Blue Moons which makes me a very happy girl.  Sometimes they do not have the best timing when it comes to the service of the food. Recently we ordered appetizers and specifically said we wanted appetizers before the actual meal but they came out at the same time to us. Then today, it was 4 of us and 3 of us got served food while we waited for my other friend's food to get her food. It was literally 10 minutes later that it finally came out. BUT all in all, it is a good place to dine"
Nerissa P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",22,43,86,3.0,8/22/2014,I have to write a review about Jillian she was an exceptional server. :) I would say the food was a 3 but the service deserves 5 stars. Thank you Jillian!
Justin T.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",3,23,,2.0,6/10/2014,"Gluten Free Menu - I went there a few days ago and I must say I was very impressed by the Gluten Free Menu and the dish I ordered.  The service was great and it was a good meal.  The waiter even boasted that they have the largest Gluten Free Menu in existence.   Sadly, I wanted to try something else on the menu yesterday.  I call in to have it curbside so I can take it back to my office.  After getting transferred to a few different people I talked with the lady at the bakery counter.   I placed my order and she asked to put me on hold.  A few minutes later she came back on the line and said that they do not have any Gluten Free pasta anymore and hung up.   I guess that menu was not as successful ... time to look for a new Gluten Free place to eat."
Maddison B.,"Lake Forest, CA",247,25,,4.0,1/7/2016,"Went here last night with my boyfriend. Great service (by Alyssa C)! I am a waitress so when I go out and there's outstanding service I appreciate it that much more. We started with the Chinese chicken salad, then onto the pasta de Vinci, and a sausage flatbread. Everything was delicious!!! The only negative was that they sat us at a joint wall where they probably store extra high chairs and booster seats, so the whole dinner I had to compete with the banging of that. But all in all, great food and amazing, attentive service. Thank you!!"
Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",750,678,46,4.0,5/27/2012,"I really can't complain about Cheesecake Factory. Can anyone? I mean, sure their menus of both entirely-too-largely-portioned mega meals and sinfully delicious but similar-tasting-looking-and-sounding cheesecakes haven't actually changed in decades, but... it works, so, eh? I've definitely fallen in love with the caramel chicken. It's so bad for you I'm sure even breaking it up into two meals will still do some numerical damage to your body and maybe a bit to your pocketbook. But! It's so so SOOOO so good. The bf can't stand the mac 'n' cheese burger though, so I suppose if anything Cheesecake's more polarizing than your average cookie cutter chain restaurant. The one thing that has always made this particular branch stand out, however, has been the service. On Mother's Day, when I'm sure all service workers would like to do is generally punch every single celebrant's family members in the face, we were treated so kindly and patiently. Bread, drinks, silverware, napkins, food, sides, to-go boxes, checks, everything so efficient and top notch. Kudos to the servers and their managers at this Cheesecake. As a proud Godmother to my four young men, I imagined Cheesecake to be kind of a bad choice on Mother's Day weekend... but it turned out awesome and it was lovely to celebrate seeing my friends at this fine establishment. Four strong stars for sure."
Heather B.,"Tustin, CA",92,19,1,3.0,8/24/2012,3 Other times the service sucked! My family and I raved about this place and used to go at least once a week. After being disappointed over and over again (here and irvine spectrum).  Yesterday for there happy hour and my husband got the  Chicken sliders-4 count and good... would order the beef sliders instead next time. i had the Spicy ahi tartar- rip off and no ahi tuna more the size of a normal size avocado and thats really all it is.... Crispy crab wontons- good but no crab to be found and after 2 out of 8 your good. Have had the Corn dogs which i recall being just good not great. Can't beat the prices and the service was just okay towards the end the server had no interest in us after he realized we weren't drinking.
Ashley M.,"Fair Oaks, CA",13,214,12,2.0,4/13/2014,"Tried something new today I had the Chile rellano burger and a salad.  The burger was horrible , not a good combo at all.   The salad had way to much ranch on it.  The only good thing was the rocky road sundae we had it was very good, and very big.   We did have the fried mac and cheese ball appetizer which was just ok.  Did take home Adams peanut butter ripple cheesecake for my lunch for tomorrow."
Alana H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",82,26,57,1.0,2/27/2014,"worst experience ever! waited 45 min to be seated because the hostess messed up and gave our table to another party of 6. Finally got seated and wasn't waited on by our server for at least another 10 minutes. Thanks to ""Kathy"", who wasn't our server, we finally got attention when she noticed we were sitting at the table without any drinks, etc. and she took our order. We received very fake apologies from the hostess who then lied to the manager about why we were waiting for so long."
Hannah K.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",148,85,21,1.0,1/24/2014,"I cut into one of my crab wontons and there was a black hair right in the middle, like it had been cooked in the wonton. EW!! I have blonde hair so it obviously wasn't my hair... Enough said, I Won't be back to this location, everytime I come here there's something wrong with the food"
Dave S.,"San Clemente, CA",13,27,42,5.0,7/1/2014,"Came in for some drinks and had chicken spring rolls , the ranch with the bread is good as we'll . The drinks we are sippin on include vodka tonic and brews nice set up on drinks !! Enjoy"
Al A.,"San Diego, CA",1032,765,1723,4.0,1/13/2010,"This particular branch of the CF chain is an exact clone which I would give a typical 5 star to.  Except my wife's Miso Salmon wasn't perfect, the rice was undercooked, there wasn't much sauce and the fish was not moist. I asked her to send it back but she wasn't feeling well and was too tired to complain.  A one star penalty.  Otherwise, with everything else, this place is flawless. I'd go back again. The valet parking and mall entrance directly next door is very convenient. Don't let my wife's Miso Salmon tragedy stop you."
H M.,"Orange County, CA",0,63,,5.0,6/28/2015,The best Cheesecake Factory. The chefs/cooks are on point. Way better than the spectrum location for sure. Servers are great. The reviewers giving bad reviews are whack
Daniel D.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/14/2015,Disappointed on the table and the service....it appears their to busy to care about service.
Yelper Y.,"Bakersfield, CA",297,155,201,4.0,3/7/2014,"I come here for their appetizers and cheesecakes.  APPETIZERS:  AVOCADO EGGROLLS: crispy and served with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce.  THAI LETTUCE WRAPS: chicken strips with carrots, bean sprouts, curry noodles, and lettuce leaves. Love the sauces: spicy thai sauces, peanut, sweet red chili and tamarind cashew.  SWEET CORN TAMALE CAKES: my favorite!! I can eat this entire thing by myself. topped with sour cream, salsa, avocado and salsa verde.  STUFFED MUSHROOMS: fontina, parmesan cheese, garlic in a wine sauce. so flavorful.  CHEESECAKES:  MANGO KEY LIME CHEESECAKE: this is the only one I can recall ordering. You can definitely taste both the mango and the key lime. Its a mixture of sweet and sour. Not bad if you like mango."
Zoe B.,"Santa Ana, CA",301,6,,5.0,11/10/2014,"We had Ryan as our server! He was funny and really friendly. I love their grilled fish tacos! They are really tasty and I didn't feel too guilty eating them. The rest of my family got sliders, guacamole, and salmon and all of it was really great! No complaints. The Cheesecake Factory were on their feet last night!"
T O.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",71,173,18,2.0,5/19/2012,"First off, I've been a fan of Cheesecake Factory for over twenty years.  However, this location i subpar. For starters, the hostess lost us in que, several parties that arrived after us were seated first, and finally one of her coworkers walked over to me and whispered, ""What's your name?"" then walk back over to the hostess and told her my name.  Just poor.  Then it took another several minutes to get seated...no apology.  I guess the high school staff is not trained on manners nor customer service, just cover your ass. Was seated on the patio outside. It was a nice warm night so great idea.  Only problem: the walkway between tables is not even shoulder-wide for workers to walk by.  Result: nearly every worker AND customer walking by my table bumped me when walking by -- not pleasant.  It got a little chilly so my wife asked to turn on the heater above, and apparently they are either on off position or wide open at full blast, nothing in between. A few minutes later a large party was seated at the table next to us.  They added more chairs around their table so now there's NO room for people to walk between our tables...even more bumping into my arm/shoulder!  The best part was when some of the overweight staff and customers would try to ""squeeze"" by, or when staff would wait on the other table while their behind is right on my shoulder.  WTF?  What's up with staff walking by every minute here?   To top it off, the large party had a very energetic woman whose voice was synonymous with a fog horn...seated facing me...full volume with no control (like a typical 1st grader but louder).  I remember her whole conversation that night. In summary, THE PROS - good food and our server was good.  CONS - poor hosting, tables placed too close together (fire hazard?), staff had no problem repeatedly bumping customers while trying to enjoy their meal. This place lacks the environment consistent with the $100 check."
