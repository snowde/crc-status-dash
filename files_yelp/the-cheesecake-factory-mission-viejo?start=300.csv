Rhonda P.,"Dana Point, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/30/2015,"From day to night, The Cheesecake Factory is the perfect place to eat out. Although, I have visited only a few locations such as the Mission Viejo and Irvine location, this restaurant has nearly 200 spots all throughout the U.S. Whether you're with your family, friends, on a date, or even by yourself, The Cheesecake Factory has a numerous amount of mouth-watering options and caters to anyone that loves food (and of course, cheesecake!). The Cheesecake Factory has the mood set with dimmed lights and trendy music. The beige and brown walls compliment the granite tile and the high ceilings give off a modern and elegant feel. Seating options range from indoor booths and tables to an outside patio. Once you are seated, you will be handed a menu and a basket filled with warm squaw and baguette bread (which by the way, is so addicting, you won't want to leave until receiving at least 3 servings). Inside the menu are endless choices of lunch, dinner, and desserts. And for the early birds, happy hour occurs from 4pm-6pm. I suggest ordering the Roadside Sliders; 4 mini burgers consisting of juicy meat topped with your choice of condiments all inside a flavorful bun. If you're trying to aim for a healthier meal, try out the Skinnylicious Menu. Gluten free? No problem! There is even a gluten-free menu! Whichever menu you decide to order off of, make sure you come hungry, the portions are huge! It's no mystery that The Cheesecake Factory is known for selling their award-winning cheesecakes. The cheesecake is served by the slice with whipped cream and/or other delicious toppings depending on what flavor you choose. For those that have a rich and creamy palette, The Oreo Dream Extreme and Reese's Peanut Butter are superb, or for those that enjoy more sophisticated and simple flavors, opt for The Original with Fresh Strawberries. I have tasted most of the flavors, and I have to say they are all crowd-pleasers.  The Cheesecake Factory has increased in a larger amount of sales every year since 1978. Not only do their cheesecakes win over the customers, but it's their large variety of lunch, dinner, and everything in between that gets customer's attention. There is something for everyone from the Skinnylicious Menu to the gluten-free menu. The customer service is outstanding and I have never encountered an unpleasant experience. I walk out more than satisfied every time I eat there."
Linda M.,"Westminster, CA",63,304,190,4.0,1/14/2010,"I LOVE CHEESECAKE FACTORY!!!  My bf and I live fairly close to this Cheesecake Factory so we frequent this restaurant a lot.  This is also one of our default restaurants when we can't think of a place to go.  This restaurant is located at the Mission Viejo Mall the majority of the time it is crowded and the wait is long.  The only time it isn't crowded is late at night towards closing time.  Anywho, when I come here I always order about 6 of the same items in rotation.  I usually get the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, Boston House Salad, Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic, Garlic Noodles with Chicken, Shrimp Scampi,  Shrimp with Angel Hair, and the Ribs.  All of those items are delicious.  I can't say anything bad about these items.  The complimentary bread they give you is a hit or miss for me.  Sometimes it's nice a hot and other times it seems hard.  Overall, the food here is yummy.  My sister gave me a gift card here for my bday so I can't wait to use it!!!  The only problem I have is the crowd and the wait.  The crowd is always the same.  It's either stupid teens/young adults or old people who think they own the place and are better than anyone and everyone."
Angela N.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,20,,3.0,8/3/2015,Disappointed in slice of cake size.. It was tiny and they charged 8.50 for it!  This is the chocolate fudge cake.   What happens to the good old BIG piece of cake?!
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,4.0,4/23/2012,"Cheesecake's menu is both a blessing and a curse. It's so extensive you're guaranteed to find something good, but at the same time, there are so many good choices it's sometimes impossible to decide on what you want to eat. My only complaint is that this location can get very very loud which makes having conversations difficult. I wish they would install something into the walls or ceiling that would dampen all of the background noise of everyone else in the restaurant."
Lorie S.,"Tustin, CA",0,9,,3.0,9/2/2014,"I had dinner with my daughter on Labor Day with her significant other at this location. I have eaten at several The Cheesecake Factory locations and enjoyed my meals. This one I had the fantastic Fried Mac N Cheese (the reason for the 3 stars) and the Chinese / Asian chicken salad (the reason there is not 5 stars). I admit the service was top-notch but my meal was so-so. the salad was soggy with too much dressing. The iced Green-tea was refreshing. I did not want a heavy meal, just wanted to enjoy my family. Very disappointed in the salad, but my daughter enjoyed her meal."
Dara S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/26/2015,"I love coming here for any occasion because their variety of dishes are great, & of course all the different cheesecakes are a must have!"
Sawi I.,"Laguna Beach, CA",84,31,26,4.0,8/7/2009,I had a great dinner here tonight. Started with the Boston house salad. It is delicious and only 400 something calories. Then I had firecracker Salmon rolls for dinner. It is so good and filling and pretty healthy too.  Our server was great. Attentive and nice. They now have a nutrition value menu. A major plus for me. I was happy.
Ann F.,"Bowling Green, KY",135,73,111,4.0,1/2/2012,"The food at cheesecake... well, the menu is too large and not enough things on it are outstanding, but they're known for the selection of both food and cheesecakes so that's fine.  If you find something you like, stick to it.  That's what I do.  This is the only place they lose a star.  I just don't think the food is that great.  I do love their lemonade and wheat bread though. Why am I bothering with the review then?  Because the service is stellar.  Krista and Andrea are both people that have waited on my boyfriend and I more than twice (he loves the place) and they are both superstars.  I work in retail and I was really impressed with both of them.  Incredibly personable, remembered our orders exactly, checks back as needed for refills and whatnot without being annoying.  I'd hire either one of them in an instant. I actually stopped objecting to the chain when we started coming to this location.  The service is the main reason I come back.  I always appreciate good service."
Kaitlyn S.,"Lake Forest, CA",1,55,,2.0,7/5/2015,I've been to this location several times and it just doesn't meet the standards of other Cheesecake Factories. The waiters at this location are very slow and only come by to take your order and bring the bill. The food is also just ok and usually on the cold side.
kim C.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",2,59,1,3.0,2/22/2016,"Food delicious, but I will ask for the more experienced and mature wait staff because they know how to give exceptional service. The young newer wait staff needs more training or needs to care more. Their service has not been living up to the cheesecake reputation . I live in the area and I frequent this restaurant regularly. This has been an on going problem since last year. Actually it's usually the young men who are slow and not on top of things. Cheesecake really is fine dining in a casual style. And these young men don't measure up. You've really got to do something about it. They just don't care or they aren't trained well. Please step your game because the sub par service has become the new normal at the mission Viejo location. I'm going to ask for the more mature seasoned wait staff from now on. I'll asked to be seated in their section from now on. It's just not fun or special there anymore and hasn't been for awhile. The wait staff vibe is blah. Please train them better. Also I always get cheesecake to go and you guys have gotten a bit stingy with the amount of whipped cream and the size of the slices."
Lori A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/4/2015,"This review is for my take-out food only as Amanda provided excellent customer service. I ordered the Bacon, bacon hamburger. Sounded so good but I couldn't eat it because it was EXTREMELY salty, and that's just the burger not the bacon. If I were there, I would have returned it. Next time, I'll need to remember to say NO salt, please."
Tito B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",379,15,,4.0,5/15/2015,"I'm not updating my last review because I still stand by the 1 Star I provided last year. However, since my wife insisted that we eat here since it was Mother's Day, we came back and had quite a pleasant experience. Thanks to Samantha and her support crew for being so awesome. She's a great server. Perfect balance between personal and professional: very attentive, responsive, and personable. She didn't ignore us, and she didn't make her home at our table.  8 Stars for Samantha, 1 Star for Cheesecake Factory = 4 stars overall. The end."
Zack P.,"Mission Viejo, CA",3,5,10,1.0,5/13/2014,Ok so I came here for lunch and got the margarita pizza and it made me not fell good the salad was good over all I will never come back
Kailey H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",11,19,9,4.0,3/1/2014,"Conviently close to where I live , but it's always busy so you have to go pretty early to get a table without waiting a long wait . The food is amazing , and the service is excellent always ."
Dave K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/26/2014,I ordered the Wasabi crusted Ahi tuna. Looked good when it was delivered to our table. I took one bite and the tuna that I was served was spoiled. The server took it back and the manager came to our table and asked what was wrong. I told him that the tuna tasted spoiled. He apologized and removed the tuna from our bill. We will not be returning.
Drannab V.,"Irvine, CA",3,114,18,4.0,11/11/2013,Good food.  Service was good.  The wait to get in left us questioning if we want to come back.  The wait for this chain is consistently long.  Please add more stores.
Robert P.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",56,100,22,2.0,9/6/2011,"This place is seriously going downhill with their food. I ordered a Parmesan Chicken sandwich the other night and the bread came out burnt.  I came in another night just for cheesecake and the server was unhappy about it. Why? You're the cheesecake factory for a reason. Drinks take a long time to get refilled and management just seems lazy about dress code for most their servers. If they don't care about dress code, and the server doesn't care about looking nice, what's the chance the servers gonna care about you? I give it a 2 for the cheesecakes. They're corporate, so they have to be good. Food on the other hand. Terrible. Everything is either too salty, too sour, or just bland.  Take my word for it, I'm not even kidding you. I've been coming here as a regular since 2010, and now I'm done. Food: 2/5 Service: 2/5 Atmosphere: 3/5"
Erica G.,"Dana Point, CA",36,64,31,4.0,10/28/2011,"Good 'Ole Cheesecake Factory! This place is always busy. It could be a monday night and you still have to wait 10 minutes just to get a table, but I don't mind. I always enjoy my meal and environment at the Cheesecake Factory. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. They bring the delicious bread and take my order efficiently. Plus the entrees are good and the menu is huge!! Good place but just be prepared to wait and wait and wait....."
Jeremy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",39,154,137,3.0,12/8/2013,"Massive portions as usual, BBQ salad and tamale appetizer were pretty good. my friends from the UK all love this place, they think its very american. A large menu, everything is pretty good and the portions are made for an NFL lineman. When I go I do like this place though its a known quantity and always motivates me to work out the next day."
Mike G.,"Dana Point, CA",0,8,,4.0,5/14/2014,"This is a great chain.  The people are usually great and the food comes in LARGE portions.  I have one small compliant and for us it is a deal breaker. We loved the old way they made there veggie burger, best ever.  The problem is they changed the way they make them.  They are so bad now, we can't even finish one.  We do not go there anymore for this reason.  IF SOMEONE FROM THE RESTURANT READS THIS PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU LOST AT LEAST TWO CUSTOMERS FOR THIS REASON.   With the exception of a bartender with a bad attitude which caused us to walk out of the restaurant (what a jerk), we think this place is OK."
