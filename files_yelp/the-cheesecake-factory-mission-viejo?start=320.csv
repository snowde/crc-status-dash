Alexandra W.,"San Francisco, CA",144,428,43,4.0,9/16/2013,Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. I got the Brunch Combo and it was yummy! The pancakes were really good and the syrup was slightly different from your usual syrup and was really delicious. I tried a couple bites of my dad's brioche french toast and it was SUPERB! Service was good and attentive and we had a great time.
Michelle C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,2,1,5.0,9/23/2014,"Tonight was a great meal at Cheesecake Factory. Our server Jason was fantastic! He made the whole meal very enjoyable and anticipated and provided everything we needed and did so with a smile. He knew the menu very well and was able to help out with out dessert selection... The new and DELICIOUS Lemon Merengue cheesecake. The overall meal was very good. We enjoyed the meal so much, we will request to sit in Jason's section in the future if we can! Thanks for awesome service tonight!!!"
Paul W.,"San Clemente, CA",11,16,,1.0,1/24/2016,"my visit was at 6 pm on 1/23/16. the wait was quoted at 40-50 min. after an hour I went to the manager who when he had his moment to make a difference failed miserably. the staff here should be better trained on quoting accurate wait times, but I imagine it would be difficult with a manager like who was on duty this night. after 10+ years going to this location, last night will be my last."
Jen R B.,"Lake Forest, CA",46,183,83,3.0,2/22/2011,Came here late Monday night with a couple of friends.  It wasn't crowded at all. I ordered soup and some items off the small plates.  I wasn't too impressed with anything but the crab and artichoke dip was yummy!  It came with some pieces of bread that were toasted and were pretty rough.   We ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake for dessert and that was yummy.  We finished the plate!  Mmmmm good. Service was pretty good. Our waitress was pretty lively. She had another lady cover her on her break and she wasn't quite as personable but she was efficient with refilling out water.
Maria B.,"TRABUCO CANYON, CA",1,18,1,4.0,1/31/2014,Wonderful service! Staff is always friendly and there is a great variety to pick from. Thank you as we are regulars :)
Claudia Z.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",154,374,200,4.0,8/12/2011,"Didn't know the Cheesecake Factory has such a sick happy hour! $5 appetizers! I got the fresh guacamole and fried calamari, ordered 2 plates because I thought it was going to be small plates at only $5 each, but no, it's the regular CF sized plates, turned out to be more food than I can eat! The guac was a little bland, but that's what the salt & pepper shakers are for. Service is a bit slow because they are busy, but good nevertheless. The waitress brought my friend the wrong drink, she ordered an alcoholic lemonade but got a regular one, she didn't realize it until we got the bill... they took it off with no problem. I think everyone is pretty familiar with the Cheesecake Factory menu (all 50 pages of it...), not gonna go into taste details, it's always pretty good as long as you know what you are ordering."
Chrissie O.,"Escondido, CA",251,807,857,4.0,1/9/2011,"5pm Sunday me : ""how long is the wait for two?"" hostess: ""I can actually seat you now.""   like seriously?  wow.  That has never happened to me before at a cheesecake factory.  Ended up sitting in the bar area anyways but wow no wait at 5pm on a sunday is spectacular!  I still can't believe it.   It's a nice location.  Close to the freeway.  I was only up in the area because I was meeting my cousin there.   The service seemed fine to me.  The girl checked up often to see how we were doing, brought our refills for drinks, and bagged up my food.   Had my usual fettuccine alfredo and pineapple upside down cheesecake which are my favorite.   very delicious and creamy.   It was a nice experience.  Started to get busy when we left.  I would definitely love to go back to this location.  It wasn't crazy busy like the one in san diego where you can't even walk in since there are too many people waiting."
Michelle Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",350,575,17,1.0,12/13/2010,My family used to love cheesecake!! This was our go to place when we felt like going out until our very last experience which resulted in us never returning. My mom ordered the lettuce wraps and my dad ordered the fish tacos. Both meals they consistently get. Fortunately by the time the food got to our table my parents had already finished their adult beverages...the food took forever! Regardless when the food finally arrived my da had a hair in his and my moms lettuce had rocks and dirt on it... So 2 out of 3 meals had to be fixed. The manager didn't even apologize or really say much of anything. When the food finally came it was about an hour after we ordered which is ridiculous. We ate and left with a bad taste in our mouths
Matt D.,"LADERA RANCH, CA",15,19,2,1.0,12/10/2014,"We used to really like this place. Last 2 times the ranch dressing has been rancid. Service has been marginal at best. Order was wrong, weak drink and overall felt as if we were in a cafeteria based on the full press to get you in and out. After years of frequenting we won't be back. Must be under bad management"
Jennifer Z.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,9,,5.0,4/8/2014,"Yum my favorite restaurant.  The entrees are on average $15, and you get A LOT of food.  The menu is HUGE and they have some of my favorite dinners here.  Not to mention the cheesecake!  - wish the cheesecake was a little less expensive. My favorites: - Chicken Costeletta - get it if you love lemon cream sauce! - Farfalle with Chicken and Roasted Garlic Pasta - Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pasta - Wow!  Did not expect it to be this good! Pretty spicy! - Thai Lettuce Wraps  - Artichoke Appetizer - Shrimp with Angel Hair - lemony and rich"
Dancer A.,"Laguna Beach, CA",64,37,11,5.0,1/5/2012,"My family loves the Cheesecake Factory and so do I. I have never had a bad meal at any of the ones we have been to. Last week we went to the one in Mission Viejo and again it was wonderful. If your a steak eater do have the steak Diane. This is so yummy. I don't eat steak to often so I got mine in the combo plate with the shrimp, which was great also, but this steak is so good I think next time I will get just the steak. My son also got this steak and his comment was-""-Why can't I cook steak like this at home."" Well, we'll just have to back to the Cheesecake Factory for some more. Oh, and by the way, our waiter was outstanding."
M A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,14,,5.0,2/7/2015,"The five stars are for service and being so family friendly.  I went here for lunch with my toddler daughter.  As soon as we were seated, the waitress brought a complimentary plate of bread and bananas just for my daughter.  Which was perfect because we were behind on her normal lunch time. And this was the first time I have ever gone to use a public changing table and there were disposable covers for the table.  These little things make a mom's day when she is dealing with the stress of eating in public with a very active toddler!"
Jamie M.,"San Clemente, CA",4,1,,5.0,12/6/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory at the Shops of Mission Viejo has a wide variety of consumers. With the location of this Cheesecake Factory being inside a mall, it attracts many families of hungry shoppers who are picking up a last minute bite after a long day of shopping. With the dimed lights and quiet music playing in the background it is a superb place to end your extensive day. Not only is it a lovely family restaurant, with their huge flat screen TV's plastered against all the walls it is also a great place for a girls or guys night out. They can take the time to relax and enjoy the latest games with a nice cold beer or wine at the bar together. It is also a great place for a special occasion or dinner for two. The Cheesecake factory is a casual dining restaurant with a suitable price range that is perfect for any family dinner night, game night, and even fancy date night. The service there at The Cheesecake Factory is as lovely as the looks of it. The waiters and waitresses have knowledge of the menu and are extremely helpful in recommendations. Even with the overcrowd of tables and swarmed amount of people the workers still take the time to make sure your time is pleasant. With that your time there is more comforting. Cheesecakes Factory has something for everyone. With over 200 selections on the menu made fresh everyday you will be sure to find something that will fulfill your starved cravings. However with so many mouth-watering items to choose from, it may be hard to decide which one of the great choices to get. I suggest their Four Cheese Pasta. Penne Pasta submerged in mozzarella, ricotta, romano and parmesan cheeses, topped with their glorious marinara sauce and fresh basil. After your journey of engulfing yourself in mountains of pasta, you are left with your tingled taste buds. Another entre that may suit you is their Chargrilled Coulotte Steak, U.S.D.A. prime sirloin topped with creamy butter. Also with that, thick, full-mouthed steak, you are served with boasts of golden brown french fries and crispy onion rings. These and the numerous other entrees of the menu are excellent choices.  Not only are their entrees the bomb, they also have many spectacular appetizers and appetizing salads. Their Fried Macaroni Appetizer has to be one of my ultimate favorites. Crispy crumb coated macaroni and cheese shaped into circular balls, topped over with a tongue tingling marinara sauce. Just the description makes you hungry. And you can never go wrong with salad. My recommendation is the Santa Fe Salad. Lime-marinated chicken, fresh corn, black beans, cheese, tortilla strips, tomato and mixed greens with a hot peanut-cilantro vinaigrette. All those elements mixed together are heaven on a plate. Sometimes it is the little things that make you happy. Saving the best for last is the famous Cheesecake. Even after your entire dinner, and you are already slipped into a food coma, you cannot resist the temptation of these jaw-dropping cheesecakes. From 30 different cheesecakes to choose from, this could be one of the most difficult decisions one must make. Original, strawberry, chocolate, lemon, low carb, key lime, vanilla, and pumpkin are just a few of the many cheesecakes. I would have to say my top pick would be the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. Layers of flourless Godiva chocolate cake, Godiva chocolate cheesecake and chocolate mousse with whip cream as the final touches. This cheesecake is too good; it can make a vanilla lover turn to a chocoholic. You may be thinking, this is a chocolate concoction, and this must not be good for you. The answer to that is you are right. Most of the cheesecakes range 1000 calories for a slice, but everyone deserves a cheat day once and a while and I am positive that you will not regret it after you take in the masterpiece of flavors. These cheesecakes at The Cheesecake factory are to die for. The Cheesecake Factory is a happening place, and there is no surprise that it is. With such a comforting feel everyone is welcomed and enjoys their stay. And the food is just superb. From their Santa Fe Salad to their Chargrilled Coulotte Steak and everything in between, it is all cooked to perfection with only the best of ingredients. The cheesecakes are to die for; you can't ever go wrong with one to end an amazing meal. On top of that the pricing is seemly and the quantity is overwhelming. I definitely recommend this restaurant and next time you are deciding where to dine for the night, go to The Cheesecake Factory."
Tash K.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2,7,,2.0,1/29/2015,"I rarely have the urge  to write a review, however  after reading some of the others, I had to include mine (Thanks Joy)  If you are a party of 5 or more be prepared to wait for a VERY long time.  I think the front of the house staff needs better training for sure.   On a Wednesday evening, we agreed to wait the 1.5 hour wait to celebrate my nephew's birthday.  However, after approaching this time line and the kids being hungry and screaming, when the front of house staff was approached, she had the audacity to tell me ""sir, that table may want to stay there for 7 hours if they choose"".  This is not how you win over loyal customers.  Thank goodness the manager was pleasant and was trying to alleviate the matter.  I feel that the corporate office needs to revisit their front house training, and their timeline tactics, if they are not to take reservations.  NO party should be allowed to sit at a table for ""7 hours"" unless they have a private room in that  restaurant location.  It does not matter how good the food, or the wait staff is .... our experience was already ruined by the time we got to our table!"
John W.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",173,43,2,4.0,6/27/2011,"You can never go wrong with CF. They have something for everyone and everything is good. I have been to different CF's all over the place and have never had bad food. It gets pricey but you have to know that going in.  The avocado eggrolls are a must for us. Try the spicy cashew chicken with shrimp added.  All of their cheesecakes rock but my favorites are vanilla bean, banana cream, tiramisu and dolce de leche.  This review has made me hungry. Gotta go...."
Edrees H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",63,128,,2.0,9/30/2010,"First, a confession. For the first 18 years of my life, I thought that this place only sold cheesecakes. I scoffed at people for coming here for dinner, I was a real man, and didn't have dessert for dinner.  Then someone told me they served food, and in huge portions. I learned my lesson, and also, learned a valuable lesson in marketing. 7 to 8 years later I've never told anyone this, but confessed it on yelp. Now that I've established how honest I am, you can take my review legit, I'm willing to admit anything. This location sucked major cheeseballs. The food came out the wrong way, and the waitress was rude and, I suspect possibly racist considering we were the only non white people in the entire building. Also she was VERY nice and happy and smiling to the people next to us, who were not a minority, but around our same age. So you can decide for yourself what that means. I doubt it was my shirt because I was wearing a pretty slick shirt..ahem, okay.. I bet most of these reviews are giving it high ratings because it's Cheesecake factory - which is a great restaurant - but as far as how I rate chains, I just rate them comparitively to other locations. And I far prefer the Irvine Spectrum location. Go there if you can, avoid this rotten hate zone. -I asked for salad dressing on the side, she said ""dry?"" I said no not dry, on the side. She said oh okay, and instead it came dry with no salad dressing. -She was frowning everytime we requested anything.  -I asked if I could substitute a different type of soup into my meal and she said no. Other locations usually say ""I don't think so but if you want that soup with a meal can I recommend this item?"" Didn't really get that. I don't mean to sound like a brat, but if I'm gonna pay extra to be served, I'd rather not be frowned and constantly been given the run around. Food itself is typical cheesecake factory and very good."
Carina C.,"Glendale, CA",91,39,86,5.0,9/9/2013,"I just love the Cheesecake Factory!! Anywhere! It wasn't any different with this one. Super friendly hostess and waiter. A huge menu to choose from. Clean restaurant. Cozy and dim lit atmosphere. Delicious food, no matter what you choose. Giant portions, so you have some more for the next day. ;) And if you can handle more in your belly the most delicious cheesecakes and sooo many to choose from. I love it here! If they could add some vegan options... I would give it all the stars in the world! :D"
Gabriela N.,"Moreno Valley, CA",3,3,,2.0,3/2/2014,My husband and I have been here a couple of times and they always manage to mess up our food. the servers need to check the food out before it gets to the tables.. Figure it out guys!!!
James I.,"Temecula, CA",5,14,1,4.0,4/4/2014,Love the food. Great cheesecake. The only bad thing: Long lines. Need mor employees. I do recomend this place if you have time to wait.
Rick H.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",24,124,2,4.0,9/28/2014,huge menu they need to shrink it and make it simpler Foods ok high calorie food though
