Leo D.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,10,2,1.0,10/3/2011,"Really had a bad experience with this restaurant I went for my birthday  ordered lunch got the order in a timely manner after that ordered dessert ""a linda's fudge cake"" just to share after eating it half way my daughter noticed a small insect crawling on the cake, told our waitress about the problem she apologized brought us another cake after minute later we notice another insect crawling on the cake.  After seeing the second insect we just decided to pay for our bill.  I ask for the bill, I gave our waitress ""Suzanne P."" my debit card then she brings it back to me but it wasn't my card but somebody else's card (the other person already put away my card in her purse"", told our waitress  about the card problem she apologized again. The next day I checked my account our waitress charge my card twice our meal and the other party's meal.  I finally complained to the manager ""joey"" and told him about the problems I had in the restaurant  he said he will fix the problem and told me that they'll  credit my card (only credited the other person's meal) and send a gift card."

Jose T.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,28,,4.0,11/16/2014,"Ordered the miso salmon with mashed potatoes instead of the rice. The meal came out nice and hot. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The sauce delivers just the right sweet flavor to enjoy with both the potatoes and salmon.  The green peas were crisp. The iced green tea was a tasty drink to complement the meal. Ordered the lunch portion, and it is a good value. Plenty of food for a lunch portion. It's nice that lunch can be ordered on the weekend.  Located in a nice mall to walk around and do some shopping."
Taylor B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,18,,2.0,1/2/2015,Wow! After over a decade of eating at this location I can admit we're done. The service has steadily gone down. Not sure what the Managers are doing cause they're no longer training the servers. Food has also become hit or miss. Ordered a salad with white meat chicken on it (according to the menu) what I got was chewy dark meat. Not sure the manager cared-I didn't care about paying at that point. So I left a token tip and said my good-byes.
Elyse L.,"Laguna Hills, CA",3,59,12,4.0,4/17/2013,Absolutely delicious! We've always had great service and good food. With a book for a menu you never run out of deliciousness to devour.
Clarice H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",64,28,3,5.0,9/2/2013,The service is always great here. So many food options you can't go wrong. Always yummy.
Steve C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",5,70,2,2.0,8/2/2010,"After numerous visits to this location over the last couple of years, the only conclusion that can be made is that it's pedestrian and inconsistent, at best.  Most visits have been because we received gift cards to come back after complaining about how lousy the food is. People generally go to chain restaurants for the consistency but not here. On three separate occasions we've ordered some type of noodle/pasta dish and each time the noodles were undercooked and literally sticking together. I'm all for al-dente but this was just blatantly undercooked. No attention to detail.  I've also sent two other dishes back because they were way over seasoned with salt. You don't need to cover up good food with too much salt and it just looks like the people in the kitchen don't have a clue and there's nobody checking what they do before it goes out. The last incident was last Saturday for lunch. I ordered the Thai Chicken Pasta and it was so salty, it was inedible. I ordered the Orange Chicken as a replacement which is usually great but even that was dry, stringy and had almost no sauce.  It's even more disappointing being a shareholder but once or even twice I could maybe get past. 4-5 times is unacceptable. Hopefully they eventually turn it around but I'm not holding my breath and I'm not going back.    The only redeeming quality is the service which is generally very good and the strawberry lemonade is awesome."
Gemma H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,7,,5.0,1/14/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory it's so good the cheesecake is to die for its soooo delicious and the waiters there are so joyful and happy and they gave my aunt and I amazing food loves it and I highly recomded it
Rachel F.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",71,10,,4.0,5/9/2013,"I've never had a bad experience here... the menu is huge so its easy for a big group to get their favorites.  The happy hour, is yummy and a good price!"
Kevin S.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/24/2014,Me and my girlfriend went to cheesecake factory ordered a garden salad an had a piece of sharp glass that I bit into. For your safety I do not recommend this place.
Rod K.,"Coto De Caza, CA",10,84,1,4.0,11/20/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory is an ""OK"" place to eat.  We enjoy eating there when at the mall, but certainly nothing to rave about."
Mathew R.,"Newport Beach, CA",134,213,22,3.0,9/18/2012,"Since going there on a Saturday night probably wasn't the smartest thing in the world, I had the pleasure to sit down with the love of my life and have a nice dinner. We sat outside which was a little hot, but bearable. The food here is ok but I think it's over priced. There's no difference between this Cheesecake Factory and any others in terms of food since it's a chain restaurant. The service here was good, even though the girl was swamped with a lot of customers she made a great effort at making sure everyone was taken care of."
Jessica B.,"Ware Shoals, SC",0,3,1,5.0,10/20/2014,I will do it very quick!! One of my favorite restaurants in California. The salmon miso is soooo good!!! Love that place. Don't miss the avocado rolls for appetizer they are great!!
Vuitton P.,"San Diego, CA",5,132,6,4.0,11/18/2012,I like this place cuz it's next door to the Nordstrom. Yeah!
Rosie K.,"Orange County, CA",4,259,4,4.0,10/10/2012,"Had never visited this location and hadn't been in a long, long time but ordered the Lunch Miso Salmon, and though not as good as The Grand Luxe Cafe version, it was pretty good.  Great service, our waitress was very patient, one of our friends got stuck in traffic for 30 minutes and the waitress never made us feel rushed!  What a customer service concept, other restaurants won't even seat you!  xoxo"
Jack F.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",0,18,,1.0,7/31/2014,"On the 1/2 off cheesecake night, I paid more than the other half of the cheesecake because we waited a long time and they ran out of the dark bread.  The service was poor, and the manager did nothing for us.  I shouldn't have left such a good tip.  Wait till they finish the apartments on Crown Valley in which more humans will inhabit."
Sarah Z.,"Maricopa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,4/15/2013,"I used to come to this Cheesecake Factory all the time and loved the cheesecake.  Unfortunately, I recently found out that I am gluten intolerant and stopped coming here. But last night, my friends wanted to get cheesecake and I figured I could find something gluten free here. Our waitress was very nice and helped me pick out a gluten free entree. I ordered the sweet corn tamale cakes without the sauce. They were pretty bland, but not horrible. When it came time for dessert, my friend asked if they had any gluten free desserts. I was so excited when they told me they had gluten free flourless Godiva cheesecake. It was delicious, and we left the restaurant full and happy. Unfortunately, I woke up at 1 a.m. and was extremely sick. I called the Cheesecake Factory and was very upset to hear that they cook their ""gluten free"" cheesecake in flour.  If you don't have dietary restrictions, then this is an okay place to eat; however, the managers and waitresses are not informed enough about the food so it is definitely not safe for people with Celiac's or any kind of food allergy. Next time I will stick to eating at restaurants with a gluten free menu, or at least an allergy list. EDIT: I received an apology from the manager and a gift card. The apology letter was very sincere and I will probably come back here simply because I am impressed with the way she handled the situation."
ali a.,"Lima, OH",0,59,79,4.0,5/25/2014,Long line on the weekends always. good food and service.
Cat L.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",194,402,491,4.0,8/30/2007,"Ahh, this Mission Viejo location is where I relinquished my Cheesecake Factory virginity. I was on a date, so I ordered some stupid salad (the Thai one), which was good, but I ended up devouring like half of my date's Chicken Madeira instead. Oh man THAT was good! My date kept referring to it as ""Madee-era"" instead of ""Madera"" hahaha. To this day, he will pronounce it MADEE-ERA. I blame it on those useless Hooked on Phonics tapes that never did a damn bit of good for him. The cheesecake menu can be a bit overwhelming, so let me make it easy for any of you undecided's...GET THE CHOCOLATE TUXEDO. You won't regret it! Unless of course, you are chocolate-averse, in which case you shouldn't waste another breath living your meaningless, chocolateless life altogether."
Hyodong A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,6,1,5.0,7/31/2014,"Much improved. Salad is quite fresh this time.  Service isstill little bit slow, but not bad. One waitress was so kind..Will return with my family."
