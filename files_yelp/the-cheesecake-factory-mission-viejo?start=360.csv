Kay N.,"Corona, CA",27,51,1,4.0,9/3/2011,"Went there with my great friend to celebrate my birthday.  We had wonderful service, from a nice young man.  We went on a Monday for lunch, it wasn't too crowded and no wait for a table.  The food was excellent and our order came out just as we wanted.  We didn't have to ask for anything, it was all there!  They had a very cute ""birthday dessert"" and the waiter, didn't embarrass me with singing, just a nice candle so I could make a wish!"
Nick V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",4,10,1,1.0,6/8/2014,"We ordered take out from here which we do all the time. This time our pasta didn't come with any sauce. We called to let them know about the issue. I spoke to the manager, I think her name was Amy. All she could say was ""You should have ate it right away"". I let her know every time I ordered the same pasta takeout it's been perfect, but she would just continue to be rude and unhelpful to the situation. Terrible Management."
Ilanna W.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,4,,4.0,6/3/2014,This location is amaizing! I got my dinner in delay a little bit but it absolutely worth it!
Laura G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",34,100,1,4.0,4/12/2012,The tables are too close together.  I love that evenlyns pasta but watching carbs ive been getting the salads and they are good.  Their chicken madera is excellent.
Shannon G.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",135,249,161,3.0,9/3/2011,"This review is for the new skinnylicious menu.  I never go to the cheesecake factory.  This is the second time I have ever been.  I had a gift card.  Anyway I was happy to see a new healthier menu.  I got the Tuscan chicken and it was pretty good.  It came with three big chicken breasts, tomatoes and capers.  It could have used more brocolinni.  It was a little dry but I applaud them for offering these healthier selections."
Ana B.,"Lake Forest, CA",35,39,11,5.0,3/13/2012,"I love this place! Great food and of coarse great Cheesecake. Back in the day during my Saddleback College days, my friend and I tried every Cheesecake on the menu. Our favorite is the White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle...yum!"
Mike K.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",106,52,9,5.0,1/31/2010,"Hey, I give out a lot of high ratings but what the hell its places I like. Cheesecake factory is delicious. The decor is very ornately done in italian style. The 4 or 5 cheese (can't recall hehe) Pasta is very good. My friend has told me the fried mac-n- cheese balls are the best high food hes ever eaten, so thats pretty cool. But you know what? This place isn't called the fried Macaroni Cheese Ball Factory is it? The cheesecake is F@$%ing insane! The menu has 40 different kinds or more!! Holy dulce de leche, that caramel is delicious! The PEPPERMINT BARK is a masterwork. The Godiva chocolate is absolutely decadent. The Tuxedo cake is fancy and shmancy. Everything rocks on that last page of the menu. Yumm I want some like now, Peppermint Bark is what id go for now, but I just had it last time, I dont care."
Aerin L.,"Hawaii Kai, Honolulu, HI",2,185,38,4.0,4/7/2014,"As good as all cheesecake factories... good food, atmosphere, drinks etc....  Favorite is the bang bang chicken and shrimp.   The burger is good too.  Overall good go to restaurant."
Kristine C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",13,88,10,1.0,8/18/2011,"So sad...wrote a review almost 2 years ago on how awesome the experience was. Not sure what has gone on with the way this place is managed, but seriously has gone downhill in service.  The servers obviously provide that extra special attention to those they believe they will benefit from the most. I get it, they are trying to make a living. Perhaps this was just our particular server the last time, but I am highly disappointed in the level of service especially for a restaurant that is so highly regarded with respect to Chains.  If I am wrong then how is it that a couple that was seated after us received bread, and was checked on during their meal at least 8 times while my husband and I sat there in the heat with our drinks melting, didn't receive any bread (not even acknowledgement that the server may have forgotten to bring the bread to us) and were only visited when our food items came out. It was clearly understood that we were not given the same level of service as the other couple who I hoped tipped the server $100 they way he was waiting on them.  Service is SO important and as I've read in some other yelp reviews, there is an area of inconsistency and concern. Unfortunately I will no longer be returning to this location as I now prefer Irvine or Garden Walk, Pasadena, Victoria Gardens because they know how to provide good service. I hope they can address and increase their service level. No problems with the food as long as it's prepared properly, it's just the inconsistent SERVERS!"
Carmen M.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",1,34,,2.0,6/27/2014,"I used to love going to Cheesecake, but lately I have found the service is terrible and food is not up to par.  My daughter went recently with 3 friends.  First, it took about 40 minutes to get seated.  Then once seated, it took a while for a waitress/waiter to come around.  Finally, when they placed their order, it took an hour before their food came.  This is unacceptable.  Another time, my husband and kids came for dinner.  Service was average and the food just wasn't as good as I remember from other times.  Anyway, very disappointed and not sure I'll come back any time soon."
Nance M.,"Las Vegas, NV",40,21,14,4.0,9/4/2013,"I'm a big fan of cheesecake factory. It's missing one star cause the hostess had a bad attitude when we first arrived. She asked us if we wanted to be seated inside or outside, so we specifically told her inside since it was really hot out there. About 15 minutes later she called our name and the server brought us to our table but it was outside. We had to return to the hostess and she gave the server a dirty look like it was the server's fault or something. We waited for another 5 minutes, a different server came and took us to our table which was outside again... my husband and I was about to blow up.. how could she mess up twice in a roll and still had that bitchy attitude like she was the best looking girl in the whole restaurant? Finally we got out correct table inside, the food was real good like usual. I order the sun dried tomato chicken pasta, it was so good. Hopefully they will do something about the hostess. I don't remember her name but I remember she was a young fake blondy."
Brendan M.,"San Marcos, CA",0,18,,1.0,4/16/2014,"We took my mother in law here for her birthday last night.  Service was terrible.  We sat there for 20 minutes before our waiter arrived, then had to wait another 45 minutes after ordering.  I ordered the mushroom burger and it tasted awful...bun was soggy, mushrooms were hard.  My wife and I had upset stomachs in the morning.  Avoid this place."
Tom C.,"Trabuco, CA",1,56,29,4.0,7/4/2009,"We got here later in the afternoon, for lunch and waited less than 5 minutes for a seat.  The service was very good and the food was fantastic. My wife had the lunch Miso Salmon and it was out of this world, VERY good. I had the Caramel Chicken, excellent. Th eportion size on both lunches was generous. We have the Fried Artichoke Hearts as an appetizer and they were awesome.  We left happy and satisfied. It is a bit costly, but you do get your money's worth."
Jessica B.,"San Clemente, CA",0,32,1,1.0,2/22/2013,"This evening my family of 5 decided to try Cheesecake Factory...BIG MISTAKE!  I know it was a Friday evening and the place was crowded.  We put our name on the list, was given a pager and told it would be approximately 30-45 minutes.  We stood right inside the restaurant by the front door when after an hour my husband walked up to the hostess and asked how much longer for our party to be seated.  The hostess stated that had called our name about 5 minutes ago and had since given away our seats.  When asked why our pager never went off, she replied with a snide ""sorry.""  She was the one that seemed annoyed!!!  We heard EVERY party that was called but somehow didn't hear our own and the fact that our pager didn't go off raised some red flags.  We were told that the next table to seat 5 would be ours.  We waited a little bit longer before going back up and telling the same rude hostess very politely that we were leaving and didn't need our name on the list to which she rudely replied ""fine, sorry.""  There was no sincere apology and felt like they could care less about losing customers as they know someone else will fill that table.  For that very reason I will never dine in this or any Cheesecake Factory establishment!"
Joaquin Z.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",2,26,26,3.0,1/8/2014,"Went here on date night with wife. I'd give 5 stars but it wasn't quite there. We arrived and they weren't busy, the host/hostess didn't even acknowledge the fact that we were standing there. Another couple decided they would just go in front of us while I turned and said something about the cheesecakes they had ok display. The host/hostess sat them right away and we were still standing there. I finally stepped right in front of the host and said I need a table for two. There was no eye contact, just an ok it'll be a few minutes stick around. We were like ummm ok..... A couple minutes went by and they sat us in a booth. Our server was Ben, he was informative abut the items on the menu. We ordered the factory nachos as an appetizer and they were great.  The chips on the nachos Were perfect, they weren't soggy and the cheese was very cheesy, it was perfect. For my main dish I got the  chargrilled coulotte steak and it was cooked a perfect medium. She got the lemon herb roasted chicken and it looked really good too. We were stuffed at the end and didn't have room for dessert. Maybe next time we'll try the banana cheesecake that was recommended by Ben. The only reason they get 3 stars and not 4-5 is because of how they are when you walk through the door. If they were m a bit more friendly or would say hi this would've been a completely different review."
Cody C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,112,5,5.0,1/3/2012,By far the best Cheesecake Factory. Food was so delicious and cooked to perfection. Loved the Meatloaf and they grilled the corn so yummy.
Matthew T.,"Irvine, CA",3,21,,4.0,3/7/2009,"There is one big reason to come to this Cheesecake Factory over the one at the Spectrum: it is usually much less crowded. The crowds here are directly related to how busy the mall is, so when the mall is really busy, I'm sure this place is packed. However, because the Spectrum stays busy much later than the Mission Viejo Mall, coming here for dinner on a weekend usually means you won't have to wait for a table at all. My experience is based on going out to dinner at 8pm or later. Even on Friday and Saturday night, when the Spectrum Cheesecake gets huge crowds and ridiculous wait times, I have never had to wait more than a few minutes to get a table here. Coming here instead of the Spectrum could mean the difference between a wait of over an hour, and being seated immediately. As far as other differences between the MV location and the Spectrum, I don't think it is much different. After all they are both Cheesecake Factory. I have had friends insist that the Spectrum location was better, but for me, I really didn't notice anything significant. The only time I came here where I had to wait for a table, was on a Sunday during the day, when the mall was full of shoppers, and the place was packed for lunch. At those times, the Spectrum location might actually have less of a wait than this one."
Dan F.,"Irvine, CA",47,20,35,5.0,11/25/2010,"Don't let the 3.5 star rating fool you, there is a reason this place is always packed, it is a FIVE STAR restaurant at a mid-price! I am in the restaurant biz myself, and a huge fan of Cheesecake. This location is my all-around favorite restaurant in this area of South County, and it doesn't get as busy as the Cheesecakes in the tourist areas, like the Spectrum and Newport Center.  IMHO Cheesecake is THE BEST CHAIN RESTAURANT PERIOD, even better than most independents! If you have ever worked in a restaurant, then you know that what they deliver on this grand scale is amazing for the reasonable prices they charge. The quality of the food is constantly outstanding. The portions are huge, always some to take home. The menu is gigantic, the size of a telephone book, and it has the widest range of different dishes in the biz. The dishes are very creative. If there isn't something you like here, well, "" then there is no pleasing you, Mr. Powers."" The staff is plentiful, friendly and very well-trained. The bar is great and has many unique drinks. Try their Mojito. And of course, the desserts speak for themselves, if you can manage to somehow save room for them. The decor and atmosphere is very upscale and comfortable for such a mid-priced restaurant. They do a good job of making it as private as possible for such a crowded place.  The low ratings of some of the reviews here seem to be related to the kind of service/order issues that always come up in a big, high-traffic operation like this one. But, I would say that because Cheesecake is so used to high traffic, that in general they do a much better job of dealing with it than most restaurants. Of course, with staff turnover, that can vary in any restaurant. I've also noticed that very busy restaurants tend to get slammed with more low reviews on Yelp than your regular locals type place. I think it is because people who wait a long time for food tend to get cranky and have a lower tolerance for even the slightest issue. Every minor problem suddenly gets magnified!  Also, at ""Special Occasion"" kind of places, expectations are much higher, and a review may be based on a only single visit, often during a major holiday when the restaurant is slammed."
Allison H.,"Redding, CA",7,12,,5.0,4/29/2012,Love this place! Great atmosphere and loved our waitress. So sweet and helpful and I'm sad I forgot her name. Loved my pasta carbonara. The bacon in it was delicious! And of course the cheesecake was awesome. I recommend the red velvet cheesecake.
Mitra K.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,764,25,4.0,8/1/2011,"I mean - you can't really go wrong with the C Factory.  I love the addition of ""small plates"" to their menu! It makes it so much easier to share a bunch of things with friends!"
