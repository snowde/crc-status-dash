Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1251,506,242,4.0,7/4/2009,"I've travel throughout the Western US, and have eaten at the CF in Tigard, OR, Marina Del Rey, Tyler Mall Riverside, Irvine Spectrum, Huntington Beach off the 405, (just last week), Mission Viejo, and Mission Gorge (?) off the 8, in San Diego, just to mention a very few. And when in Scottsdale recently, at the Grand Luxe.... already mentioned as an ""upgraded version in the CF rest. family."" My 4-stars really goes to all the CF's I've ever visited. I must be lucky, because I've yet to have mediocre to poor service at any of their locations. And I highly respect corporate for maintaining consistency and quality in their menu, store to store.  I've gone here (MV) with my wife and business clients for lunch several times. It's always been good service and consistently good food. I know that this is one of the last decent rest. chains left, and while I respect other reviewer's 2-star reviews as having occured, I tend to think it's more an anomolie. (sp?) Sometimes stuff happens. But I also know that if one contacts any of the restaurant managers with a fair issue, their concerns will be address, and they'll endevour to ""make it right."" That's the power a retailer has when they have a reputation to maintain. That's a good thing.  My favorite menu items right now? I like the stuffed mushrooms in that cheese sauce, followed by the chicken madera and BBQ chicken salad or Santa Fe salad. I find it's great to split both entrees, as the chicken madera usually comes with two breasts and plenty of potatoes. The full salad portion is huge. It's like a family-style meal. I highly recommend trying that approach."
Donna K.,"San Clemente, CA",1,10,,4.0,4/5/2012,"I would NEVER pick Cheese Cake factory for a meal, thinking that there are no healthy choices for me there...just think of the name! Well, much to my surprise...pleasant surprise, I had the healthiest most delicious lunch off their Skinnylicius menu. Fantastic! Give it a try for a clean, healthy yet delicious meal."
Jack G.,"Fontana, CA",111,178,7,3.0,9/25/2008,"Sunday night was my second time for this location. My first experience involved a long wait and unmemorable food. This time we were seated immediately and I can at least recall what I ordered. First off, the service: 5 stars. We wanted for naught the whole 60 plus minutes we were there, and it was accompanied by a smile and excellent suggestions. The appetizer: Tex-Mex Eggrolls. I could make a meal of those beauties alone. Their description: ""Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese. Served with Avocado Cream and Salsa."" The salsa was fresh pico de gallo, and was delicious. The avocado cream was green creamy stuff that seemed to disappear fast as soon as the green creamy stuff lovers discovered its green creaminess. 5 stars for this app. The mains: I had the Shepherd's Pie, which is misnamed. It should be called Cottage Pie because it's made with ground beef. Shepherd's Pie is made with lamb.... but I digress. It was pretty good... but nothing to flip over. It is described as ""Ground Beef, Mushrooms, Carrots, Peas, Zucchini and Onions in a Delicious Sauce Covered with Mashed Potatoes and Parmesan Cheese."" It was a bit salty for my taste though. Still, I put a big dent in it, and had enough leftover for next day's lunch. 3 stars. I won't be ordering it again, however. N had the Chicken Madeira. It is described as ""Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese, Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce. Served with Mashed Potatoes."" She enjoyed it immensely. I had some of hers, and would give it 4 stars. It would have gotten 5 had the asparagus not been so tough. This is what I'm ordering on my next CF outing. T had the Santa Fe Salad, which is described as ""Lime-Marinated Chicken, Fresh Corn, Black Beans, Cheese, Tortilla Strips, Tomato and Mixed Lettuces with a Spicy Peanut-Cilantro Vinaigrette."" He seemed to enjoy it, but I didn't sample it as I'm not a fan of vinaigrette. Or lettuce. Or salad. For afters, I ordered a piece of banana cream cheesecake, and they split a piece of key lime cheesecake. Mine is described as being topped with Bavarian cream, but it wasn't. It was mounded with lots of what I call ""Corporate Whipped Cream"". I know from Bavarian cream, and that ain't what was on there. All in all, the desserts were uninspiring. Good, but not worth what they charge. I would give what I ordered 2 stars and the key lime 3 stars. Mine lost half a star for lying about the Bavarian cream. All in all, decent corporate food, lots of choices, nice surroundings, clean restrooms, and prompt, friendly service."
Wendy L.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",1,21,19,4.0,4/27/2014,"Permanent restaurant all very fun to eat very convenient but it is not high quality food, but I'm used to this place.,"
Judy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,766,552,2.0,11/11/2012,"used to love  this place!  we were here a couple of days ago because my best friend was visiting & wanted to eat here.  they seated us immediately because we chose to sit outside under the heat lamps which was great. our server was pretty quick to take our orders for our drinks then must have forgotten us as we waited quite a while for him to come back to take our meal order... in fact, the drinks were about gone :( not good.  then I find out they got rid of the Thai chicken pasta!!! WHAT?? So sad, so I ended up w/ my 2nd favorite.. chicken marsala. Too bad my pasta was dried up & the dish salted a bit much. maybe it was an off night but I'm pretty sure I'll be taking my business elsewhere from now... cheesecake was delish but it didn't make up for my bad meal!"
Sedat O.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,5,,4.0,3/5/2014,"Just moved to Mission Viejo and ended up earing dinner at this Cheesecake location several times.  Servers are very nice, polite and helpful, but there is always a long waiting list and getting your table often takes longer than they predict.  Overall it is a nice restaurant, but be prepared to wait a little longer than usual for your table"
Jannae B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,8,,1.0,12/28/2013,Wait for 10 was 2 hours & service was terrible & manager was rude. I NEVER COMPLAIN but I won't ever go back. After spending $300 on a bday dinner it was very disappointing...go to any other location of Cheesecake or another restaurant
Justin W.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,10,11,5.0,12/6/2013,This is the best place to eat with the best service... Other restaurants need to model themselves after Cheesecake Factory... Always pleased to eat here!!!  The servers are always giving you re-fills covering each other. Food comes out warm and delicious and prices are reasonable...
Jill C.,"Trabuco, CA",1,5,2,5.0,7/4/2009,"I've dined at this location several times, always a positive experience. Like mentioned in other reviews it's best to go during slower hours otherwise there will be a wait.  For lunch we usually go around 2:00 and get in quickly. Food has always been delicious with huge portions, expect to bring some home.  Yesterday I ordered the Miso Salmon hoping for a light lunch. While I was able to finish it, it certainly wasn't a small portion. Fabulous flavor. As I said earlier, I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.  My personal favorites are the Crispy Spicy Beef, Miso Salmon, Tortilla Soup with Garden Salad, Fried Artichoke Hearts, Firecracker Salmon is the best appetizer! As for service, we've always been happy. Servers are attentive and quick. Food is always served very hot and fresh."
Tet W.,"Portland, OR",44,225,90,3.0,10/8/2012,"Today I came for lunch after shopping for a dining room table.  I've been to the Cheesecake Factory a number of times and usually ordered their chicken fettuccine alfredo or their chicken and angel hair which is good.  I diverged from ordering pasta and had their club sandwich.  Hate to say it, it was a disappointment.  The missing ingredient they didn't have was the avocado and it made a huge difference in this sandwich.  The avocado brings richness, flavor and helps to tie the turkey and bacon flavors together.  The absence of this key ingredient made the sandwich bland in flavor and relative it tasted like any other sandwich you can make at home.  With a price tag of $12, I don't think this is something I would recommend ordering.  I think next time, I'll stick with their pastas.  This lunch sized pastas are huge and are more than adequate for lunch or dinner.  Their bread is great but it would be nice if they kept their butter at room temperature so that you can spread it easier.  Overall, it's in a nice location, our server was nice and attentive and seating was prompt.  This is a nice place for a nice casual lunch with friends or family.  Portion size is large so be okay with eating leftovers as you'll likely not finish your plate. The ambiance is classic traditional with a modern Italian flair and if you muster enough space after consuming your gut busting entree, I would highly recommend trying one of their many excellent variations of their cheesecake.  It's huge so it's perfect for sharing."
Jonathan Z.,"Cypress, CA",595,1179,1175,4.0,8/29/2008,"Cheesecake Factory is solid.  Well, this one is.   Do not go to the Irvine Spectrum one on a busy night.  They really suck at service there.  The one in Mission Viejo mall is great.  They have good service and good food.  The menu has a huge variety.  I love the sliders for appetizer.  You can also get them as an entree."
I M A.,"Long Beach, CA",0,14,,2.0,6/17/2010,"Here is the letter that I've forwarded to the Cheesecake Factory's MV location and corporate office, from which I have not gotten a response:  ""On June 5, 2010, we visited your restaurant in Mission Viejo. Our visit did not start out well. We arrived at 1:00pm after 3 runners (in our party of 7, plus a baby of less than one year old) completed the Camp Pendleton Mud Run. We were greeted at the front desk and given a buzzer and told that the wait would be  1/2 an hour for a ""first available"" table. After waiting 40 minutes and watching EVERYONE (approx. 30 people) in the waiting area being seated before us, we decided to check on the status of a table.  The hostess informed us that the table that we were waiting for had received their check, and that we would be seated shortly.  A party of similar size then walked right in and was seated before us.  We again waited, but not before one of our party members talked to the manager -on- duty (female, blondish, tall, early thirties).  Our party member (he) noticed an end booth in the bar area was available, but the manager stated ""that table can be tight for large people"". As I stated before, 3 are runners, marathoners in fact, and one is a baby! Let's put that aside, the fact is the statement was inappropriate and rude. He told the manager that we could fit there and put the baby on the end where no other diners would be seated.  We were finally seated after over an hour wait. Perhaps your staff, management especially, needs some training in how to deal with the public.  On a good note, our waiter, Hutton, was excellent.  Just after we were seated, a small plate of sliced bananas and bread came out for the baby-that was a nice touch. Although it took awhile to get bread and butter, all of our orders were correct, came out timely, and were delicious.  Our entire party works in the service industry, and was appalled in the wording in which your manager chose to inform us that a table would not suit our needs because of her perception of our ""size"".  It is our hope that bringing this issue to your attention gives your staff the opportunity to avoid this exchange in the future."""
T A.,"Ventura, CA",0,26,,3.0,3/18/2013,"As always, the cheesecake selection is incredible (the Oreo one is delicious), the food is decent, and the employees are friendly.  This chain is very good at what it does. . . but their menu is a little too extensive and bloated with a lot of mediocre dishes.  Sometimes what I get is excellent but often it is just average.  Maybe they should consider narrowing the menu a little bit and focusing on improving the wow factor of the main courses to match the cheesecake."
Danny E.,"Costa Mesa, CA",61,39,1,4.0,1/9/2011,Food is always good as is the service. Just a pain to get a table during the holidays. Huge menue and the cheese is always great! They only drawback is getting a seat at night....but overall a nice place to go out and have a good eating experience with friends.
Devon B.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",120,243,103,4.0,8/4/2008,"Everyone has been to a Cheesecake Factory at some point or another.  This one is like all the others.  The reason I am giving it four stars is for the cheesecake and the service. I ordered the never-fail delicious chicken Madeira.  You can't go wrong with mushrooms and melted mozzarella over a tender chicken breast, served with asparagus and fluffy red mashed potatoes. The dulce de leche caramel cheesecake is to die for.  Seriously, I tried everyone else's' cheesecake and told them theirs was good too so they wouldn't feel bad, but mine was the best.  It was so light I swear it must have been more cream than cheese.  The amount of sweetness was perfect, and it came with the obligatory mountains of fresh whipped cream.  *sigh* :)   The entire side of my hubby's immediate family was there (20 people) and the server handled us excellently.  She was so patient with us and so accommodating - she made a routine night out at ""the Factory"" fabulous."
Dmitry Z.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,5,,4.0,4/5/2011,Nice and good atmosphere on the patio. I always enjoy grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich!
Dave B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",14,47,,3.0,3/29/2011,Cuban poorlboy.  One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Good service and nice atmosphere.
Ash L.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,34,,4.0,8/16/2008,"This Cheesecake Factory is extremely reliable.  You can always count on the parking lot right in front being full so you have to park in the next lot; you can count on there being a wait (especially for groups), you can count on a HUGE menu, you can count on most the the things on the menu being really tasty, and you can count on lots of cheesecake, and you can count on helpful servers. I like this place because it is reliable and I know what to expect.  I have always had great service at this location (not true of other CF locations).  It's a nice place for a dinner out, a date, lunch with the girls, or to grab a fancy drink and appetizer at the bar.  Solid, unoriginal, gets the job done, good food, lots of choices. If there is a long wait you can walk around the mall for a bit - so at least there is some way to pass the time."
Kraven R.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/1/2010,"We've been to this location dozens of times as well as other locations a few times...we have a lot of experience with this one!  The vast menu ensures most everyone, if not all, in your party will find something they like.  There are a number of appetizer options (not that you need appetizers before your main entree as the portions are generous) including the southwestern egg rolls which are awesome!  There are great sliders here for the kids and we always special order them for our finicky little eaters and the order is correct about 98% of the time...pretty good!  You can count on the servers changing shifts in the time you are eating your meal...it's become an inside joke, no other restaurant in our experience has those shift changes...a non issue, just funny. The location is such that it draws a lot of traffic...peak meal times means you can wait up to an hour or sometimes more with the little remotes they give you.  Even in a down economy, this place is busy!  Go in the off hours and you'll be fine however. The salad choices are very good, the Mexican and Italian inspired cuisine is OK (not great compared to the best Mexican or Italian places you go to) but you can't really compare this to the niche restaurants as this is offering such a wide selection of food. The dessert is amazing...it is the Cheesecake Factory after all!  Every type of cheesecake we've tried has been great.  They will also have seasonal cheesecakes during the year which are also very good. If you are looking for a reasonably priced outing for your family, finicky kids, larger groups then you'll do well going here!"
Ashley T.,"Laguna Hills, CA",66,25,,5.0,9/19/2012,"I went here for lunch today with my friend and sat on the patio... I stop in here quite a bit but decided to finally write a review today. What I love about this place is that it is always consistant, in both service and food. And I NEVER give 5 stars for chain restaurants. I love the variety in the menu as well... makes it a perfect place for everyone to agree on. I tend to stick with their skinny menu... there's still a good variety on there to fill you up.  Love the flat breads and appitizer variety! One of the things that made me want to write a review today was Robert, our server on the patio for lunch. He was very knowledgable and detailed in explaining the specials and items on the menu, but most of all, he was so NICE! Something about him really made me enjoy my time there more. I definitly recommend asking for him."
