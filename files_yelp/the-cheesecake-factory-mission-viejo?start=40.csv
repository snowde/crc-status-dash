Janelle J.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",922,393,925,4.0,7/18/2016,"Nom nom nom cheesecake factory is yummy! Ordered the buffalo chicken strip small plate and it was a lot! I was excited because the strips were less-breaded than last time I had them at the Spectrum location. It came with ranch and a veggie boat. Their strawberry lemonade is great too if you are feeling like a yummy non-alcoholic beverage. Favorite cheesecake would have to be the key lime, and second the tuxedo. If you are going for something more basic, I would recommend the original drizzled with raspberry sauce."
Henry Q.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,19,26,1.0,2/20/2017,Very disappointed!  Drove to The Cheesecake Factory at The Shops in Mission Viejo specially just to pick up two slices of Linda's fudge cake to take home for my family. When I got home and opened the bag; the cake slices were half their normal size. I PAID $18.32 FOR THIS?  NOT COOL AND NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!  I doubt it was a mixup in the order because the young lady at the counter did call out my order by the items.
J. G.,"Lake Forest, CA",9,11,2,4.0,6/21/2017,We always get great service here. The chicken marsala never disappoints. Our waiter suggested the chicken riesling which was delicious. The Expresso Chocolate Cheese Cake was devine. Can't wait to go back!
Susanne K.,"Orange County, CA",61,178,391,3.0,8/8/2016,"*PLUS: A Large menu with a ton of choices. Have always loved this place, so it pains me to say... *MINUS: Slow- not so good service!!! Twice here in one week & 'without' a crowd both times. Try, Try again... OR SHOULD we say, ""TRAIN, TRAIN again?!"" Tutoring is free, as patrons are not.  We've supported this establishment as long as they've been here. ""TCF"" Please come back to your original 'WOW' factor - we miss you!"
Jasmine C.,"Northern, VA",0,101,6,1.0,4/16/2017,"It's difficult to write a review for this location. Sometimes you go in and there's no line, and half the tables are empty, so you get served promptly. Other times, you go in, there's a terrible line (not surprising for Cheesecake Factory), terrible service because the kitchen/bakery are slammed, and/or the server is inexperienced/just bad at their job. It's almost like I need to write a separate review for each time I visit this location. For this review, I'm just going to leave this gem of a photo, and a brief description. This is the kids dessert strawberry platter. It's $4. For 4 strawberries that were past their prime, and a sad little plop of cream. After tax and tip, that's $5.11. That is beyond highway robbery, it's basically a slap in the face. Might as well have said ""Thank you for being stupid enough to bring your kid here and order dessert for your child."""
Joseph T.,"Mission Viejo, CA",53,5,11,1.0,2/12/2017,"This location can not figure things out. I've restrained from writing a review but after getting 9 out of 10 bad experiences it's time. I order the same thing every time I place a curbside pick up order. It's even written on the receipt as to what I ordered. Tonight's order took 36 minutes ticket time when I was quoted 20-25. When I tried to pay, the bakery Togo girl said my gift certificate that my sister purchased for me for Christmas that had a balance on it was quote ""a zero balance"". To which I then had to get out of my car which is parked curbside and go in to talk to a manager. I went on to the cheesecake gift card balance website to which I indeed have a balance. The manager fixed the payment issue. But when I got to finally eat my meal, it was not prepared as to my order. There was not 3 extra sides of sauce or the napkins & utensils to eat the food as noted by the server who took the order and wrote on my ticket. Pictures to show what I received compared to what my ticket order said.  Bottom line, line location has failed me on the same order curbside 9 out of 10 times. Pretty sad for a corporate service industry company that has over 150 locations."
Dm C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",4,164,19,1.0,7/28/2017,"4th times a charm? It's an epidemic at this place. Slow service, mediocre food, they remain busy because of the name- not quality. Again sat there too long before someone approached- tho the water and bread came fairly quicker than usual after that my tiny appetizer salad took 35 minutes.  I decided to look at my phone when I ordered and when I received the salad 35 minutes.  The Beet and goat cheese salad always tastes dirty like I'm eating it straight from the dirt. Do they wash the lettuce and beets? Why the gravel in the teeth- what's gravely? The management are dressed like they just don't care and are seeming burnt out no pizazz or joy listless, so I see where it's trickling down from. I forgot to add this is the 5th time, forgot to report of yet another time two weeks ago I sat down at the bar and waited as the brunette bartender guy didn't give me the time of day for way way way too long it was so uncomfortable- I was embarrassed that as a single woman in my 50's to sit at a bar hoping to grab happy hour meal and drink and I sat there like a dope for an uncomfortable amount of time when he wasn't doing anything!  I left. I've given this location three times, well three strikes and you're out. I'll stick to my last visit... Got sat on pretty quick- I immediately told the host that I knew what I wanted no  need for me to look at menu--and no waiter in-site for 20 minutes. Finally Mr. Cool comes over and says he'll be with me. Another 10 minutes go by and the bread came from a bus boy. I got up and found my waiter and told him I just wanted a small plate.  No food came out for another 20 minutes! Finally the salad came and it looked like it was someone's plate that they began eating from- a total gross mess! I left."
Jessica O.,"Moreno Valley, CA",6,125,1,5.0,8/17/2017,Solid service at the end of closing time. Good food and prepared fast. Plate was hot and food was delicious. This one is by far the best cheesecake I have been to in a while. Usually customer service  slows down towards the end of the night but with these lovely gents and gals it was tremendous!!!!  Thank you!
Stacy S.,"Orange County, CA",280,456,2487,3.0,1/8/2016,"I'd give this place 3.5 stars but round it down to 3 because it's closer to a 3 than a 4.  I received a gift certificate and this was the closest location, so we went there for dinner. One of the reasons I don't like it is because they don't take reservations and the wait is typically long during lunch and dinner... at least it is whenever I walk by it while I'm at the mall.  It's also very loud inside. They certainly have a large menu with lots of choices, including lots of different cheesecakes!  On this particular visit, I got the Chicken Madeira and I asked for linguine instead of the other pasta it normally comes with.  The plate was HUGE!  I made 3 meals out of it (not kidding).  The flavor/taste was good, the chicken was big and they gave lots of mushrooms and sauce, so no problems there! The service (waitress) was also friendly and efficient.  Drinks were refilled and she came around often to check on us. Overall it's a decent restaurant to choose if you're at the mall and don't mind the wait.  Their cheesecakes are really good, too!"
Gavin C.,"San Clemente, CA",116,6,,1.0,9/6/2017,"So today I went to Cheesecake Factory looking for nice afternoon snack with a couple of my friends that are girls. Well the food wasn't to great the buffalo blast had hardly any chicken in it just fried wrappers. Well other than that the service was appalling the server (Rosani) was very rude to my friends saying ""well done"" after finishing their food. I didn't finish my buffalo blast after she asked if my friends wanted to finished what I didn't eat. I felt that it was very rude and if you do came here to eat request to not have Rosani as your server. Hope my review was helpful."
Chiara M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,8,,5.0,9/17/2017,"Logan H. was very kind and courteous!!! Great service and was really attentive without being over bearing. Stopped by to grab dinner after a long work day, and the food and experience was fast paced and welcoming. Thanks Logan!"
Tammy H.,"Irvine, CA",103,94,273,4.0,9/11/2016,They have everything for all taste buds.  The burgers and pasta to the low calorie menu.  Friendly service and helpful staff that can assist you. The cheesecake what an issue about the cheesecake?  Diet before you eat here.
Nicky G.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,58,,5.0,9/17/2017,"Lunch was great today, and the drinks too. Best of all was our waitress Jenna B. Did an excellent job. It's good to see someone so young working a pretty decent job like that. She knows what she's doing and hopefully will move forward in life. That goes for the young Kardashian hostess as well. Excellent crew today.  As for the restaurant, the food is always great and the service too, I have no complaints."
Brandon J.,"Dana Point, CA",1,15,,3.0,7/26/2017,"I don't know how anyone can give any Cheesecake Factory 5 stars. It's very ""ok"". It's not terrible by any means, but on the other hand it's most definitely not amazing either. When you have a thousand things on your menu, I'd imagine is pretty hard to master them all. They did over cook my Kobe burger (I know it's not Kobe) which was kinda a bummer, didn't stop me from eating the whole thing. A place like that shouldn't mess up a burger tho, that's textbook cooking 101. Service was good, but I don't really care about stuff like that. I came to eat, not make a friend."
Moses Y.,"Irvine, CA",41,17,30,3.0,9/12/2016,"I finished my order 6:10Pm, almost 40mins past, still not see my order . Long waiting time Although i know it's peak time for dinner, really need such longtime to preparing food"
Daphne L.,"San Diego, CA",1382,1153,1103,4.0,5/17/2016,"You can never go wrong at Cheesecake Factory! I love the Cheesecake Factory because it has my favorite dish (Chicken Piccata) on its menu. This is your typical Cheesecake Factory and the service is always decent here! We came for my birthday and they sang for me (yay!) and gave me a really, really tiny complimentary sundae (really, it's super tiny). Of course it was a nice gesture but we ordered  a strawberry shortcake dessert because that tiny sundae wasn't enough for even half a person. Overall, my experience here was good."
Jonathan D.,"Irvine, CA",715,300,2014,5.0,5/24/2016,I truly enjoyed my experience today at the cheesecake factory. It's been a while since I've visited this location it's about time I give it a review. I brought two clients out today and glad we came in. We ordered the Bubbly hot Cheese and artichoke dip as an appetizer. I ended up getting the four cheese pasta with chicken. I enjoyed both of my plates and was excited to be able to take some home since it was too much for me to eat at the restaurant. This place definitely gets five stars from me.
Sam M.,"San Clemente, CA",189,9,,5.0,8/26/2017,Food was great! Timing was great! Server Logan is highly recommended! Will be going back for sure! Great time with my husband.
Angela V.,"Pico Rivera, CA",607,351,2558,5.0,7/27/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory is my place to go when I want a slice of yes Cheesecake. Being that I was on respite from my no sugar diet for the weekend well yes I had make a stop and indulge on one of my favorites, cheesecake and pasta. I started with the Thai Lettuce Wraps which were very good and very filling that I didn't eat my pasta and had it packed to take home. My two youngest that were new to this restaurant took a while to ponder the kids menu and ended with a choice of sliders and corn dogs that came along with fries and a drink. Yes they enjoyed their food and the waiter was super patient and kept cracking jokes with them. When it was time for dessert well me and my son Stephen truly indulged and were in a cheesecake coma by the end of dinner. Yes they both highly approved and both enjoyed their meals."
Sara B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",14,23,6,3.0,8/8/2017,"came here for national cheesecake day, fairly busy but was seated within 5-10 minutes. When the hostess took us back to our seat, she was about to seat us when she noticed the table was dirty. We asked us to sit at another table and she proceeded to take us to another table, dirty again. I just ordered the cheesecake while my friend ordered food. Service is pretty much mediocre here, quality of food is about the same. I love the cheesecake though!"
