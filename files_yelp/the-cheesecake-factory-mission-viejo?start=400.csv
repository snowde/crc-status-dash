Beverly T.,"Chino Hills, CA",191,560,7,4.0,5/20/2008,"This is your typical Cheesecake Factory. Nothing really stands out. I work across the street and we always order from here for lunch. The service is pretty attentive. There's always a wide variety of food here, and I've never had anything bad from any Cheesecake.  The cool thing is that they have curbside to go, so you can call in your order, park in the spot, and they'll take payment and give you your food. It's pretty convenient. I usually get their miso salmon."
Natalia I.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,14,9,2.0,1/6/2011,"I went for lunch there on last weekend with kids for the first time.  the food is ok.  nothing too special.  they have mini burgers for kids but it didn't look too yummy.  my child normally eat everything but she didn't finish her meal.  the famous cheese cakes are way too heavy, too sweet, i don't think i'll have another one for a long time.  i checked the calories for the cakes, they were all over 600 calories.  some of them were over 1000 calories - a piece :O !!"
Dan L.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1,3,,2.0,4/7/2011,"The last two times I've been here they have gotten my order wrong. The food is alright, and the restaurant is kept clean. They just need to get the orders right. Not impressed."
Devon H.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/5/2012,"The Cheesecake Factory  Operating over 150 restaurants in the United States, The Cheesecake Factory is the place to go if you want a savory meal. Inside this high-class diner, there are plush seat cushions and flat screen televisions to enjoy your favorite sports games. The dim lighting and chandeliers create an intriguing mood making your dining experience unforgettable.  The Cheesecake Factory is recommended for all ages, but the food can be a little pricy. Although the food ranges from $3.95 to $40.00, every meal is worth the price.   Every time someone steps into this friendly environment, one thing is for sure. And that is that no one can ever pass up on a slice of cheesecake. With twenty nine different flavors, you will never be disappointed. The number one, most popular cheesecake, would have to be the Fresh Banana Cream. Baked with a vanilla, waffle crust, and topped with rich Bavarian cream, this cheesecake will leave you speechless.  You may want to carefully choose your meal because if you miss out on dessert, you will most definitely regret it. You can never be too full for a slice of their exquisite cheesecake!   If you're looking for a mouth-watering meal, one of the signature dishes is the Chicken Marsala.  This chicken breast is sautéed with fresh mushrooms, slathered in a creamy, Marsala, white wine sauce, and served over bow tie pasta. Grilled perfectly right, the chicken breast is tender and sides well with the bow tie noodles. The richness of the sauce corresponds well with the rest of the dish and makes the meat moister. The large portion of this meal fills you up, so you may want to take the left over's home with you.   Another favored dish is the Chicken Madeira. This includes seared chicken breast topped with crisp asparagus and freshly grained mozzarella cheese. Not only is it coated with luscious mushroom, Madeira sauce, but is also served with a side of soft, golden mashed potatoes. Customers are encouraged to order this dish because it is highly praised and almost all waiters recommend it. You get your money's worth from this tasty meal and won't want to order anything else the next time you visit.   I am always more than satisfied after I leave The Cheesecake Factory and never disappointed. Every meal is delicious and every slice of cheesecake is worth waiting for. Whether you live close or far away from this restaurant, you should try and dine here at least once. The employees will make you feel comfortable and just at home whenever you step inside. The amount of hard work that goes into all of the dishes is impeccable and with every bite, you can really tell. The Cheesecake Factory is a definite yes on my top list of restaurants, and I think it should be on other people as well!"
Elizabeth L.,"San Francisco, CA",48,44,5,1.0,12/30/2008,"I used to go to the Cheesecake Factory a lot, but I haven't gone in a while. Maybe it has really gone downhill or maybe it's just this location, but when I went yesterday, both the food and service were extremely disappointing.  We started off with Buffalo Blasts for appetizer. I had Buffalo Rolls at Grand Lux (also part of the Cheesecake Factory chain) and it was really good and I thought this was similar. Boneless buffalo chicken and cheese deep fried in crispy skin - how can you go wrong with that? Alas, it was really greasy and there wasn't much chicken or cheese or flavor. I ordered Miso Salmon for entree, which is one of my sister's favorite dishes. The salmon itself was fine, but the bed of rice underneath was overcooked and hard. Dessert was the only saving grace. We tried their 30th anniversary cheesecake, which was basically the original cheesecake layered with their fudge cake. It was really good - the texture of the fudge cake was a nice contrast to the cheesecake.  If I only rated this place on food, I might have given it 2 1/2 stars because of the dessert (although I've had much better food at other Cheesecake Factories). However, the service was also not great. I had a late lunch so I wasn't that hungry so I only ate about half of my entree. The waitress came by and asked if we wanted to get a box. We were still talking so my companion said that we were still working on it. My waitress looked at my plate and said in a somewhat snide manner, ""you know, if you put your knife and fork to the side, it means you are done."" I wasn't paying any attention to my plate and I was actually done, but even if I wasn't, I didn't need a lecture from my waitress on etiquette. I thought that was rather rude. Minus 1 point for that. We didn't finish the cheesecake so I took it home and the box was not closed tight so when I stopped a little too quickly at a light, the cheesecake box flew open and the whipped cream tumbled onto my car carpet. I had to scrub really hard to that oil stain off my carpet. Minus another point for that.  It's really too bad because I normally like Cheesecake Factories but this one was just disappointing."
Charles H.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,59,13,5.0,8/3/2011,Favorite restaurant. Biggest best menu around. Great service. Nuff said.
Jennifer W.,"Orange, CA",1,38,,2.0,4/1/2011,"We've been here many times and have decided that we will no longer to patronize this establishment.  The service has always been variable--everything from ""excellent"" to ""what the?"".  However, after 3 visits in a row with poor service, we will not waste our time.  This is a chain restaurant and not worth the having to ask the waiter twice for EVERY item we request, nor is it worth waiting 45 minutes for a take-out order that was said to be ready in 10-15 minutes and was cold when we received it from the manager who finally acknowledged us after we loudly voiced our frustration."
Sonya W.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",2,15,2,4.0,1/20/2012,"The service is great.  The food is delicious and the portions are large.  I never skip out on the cheesecake.  There is an wide variety of desserts so if cheesecake isn't your thing, you can always find something that strikes your fancy."
Erika T.,"Glendale, CA",42,26,3,5.0,12/29/2007,"THE POSITIVES (there's a lot!): This is the best Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to. Hands down. I know you might think they're all the same, but they're certainly not. I've had the one in Pasadena, I've had the one at the Grove, Spectrum, etc.. and they're just not as good. I still love them, don't get me wrong, but the Mission Viejo location is the best. THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT CF IS THAT YOU CAN GET ANYTHING MODIFIED EXACTLY HOW YOU WANT IT. my sister works there, thankfully, or else i would have never known this. You can change practically anything on any dish to be prepared exactly how you want it. Change the bread on a sandwich, use a different dressing on your salad, etc. they make it so easy and are very used to changing things for people and really don't mind. my sister says it's better to tell your server any and all changes you want right away, because that way you'll be happy with your meal and it'll be easier for her to make sure you get it exactly how you want it.  Cheesecake factory isn't too pricey, but it isn't cheap either. Most menu items will run you 11-16 dollars, but of course there's the exceptions-- most things steak or fish will be much more expensive. But the portions of any items make the price worth it. You can easily split a salad or sandwich between two people. Whenever I go with a friend, we order a salad and an entree, making sure to split each and we walk out of there at about 15 dollars a person, plus tip, so around 20 a person, which really isn't bad for two people eating a big lunch. If you want to go but aren't sure what to order, I highly recommend the following-- Thai Lettuce Wraps, An Oscars (technically it's discontinued, but they still know how to make it at most locations) or any of their burgers or pizzas.  I cannot stress enough that most all their items are delicious. Thanks to my sister, I've tried at least 2/3 of what's on their ridiculously large menu, and I have yet to be disappointed.  The cons: I wouldn't buy alcohol from this place. Their drinks are really expensive (6+ dollars for a beer, 9+ dollars for a drink) and are pretty weak. There can be a wait most afternoons and nights, but they try and get you in as quick as possible. People are starting to bring their kids there, not realizing Cheesecake Factory doesn't have a kids menu and isn't meant to be a place for kids to hang around. But that is never too big of a problem. THE BEST: happy hour!! It's from 4-6, i think just on the week days, but I'm not sure- it could be every day. Avocado eggrolls, hamburger sliders, lettuce wraps, mac and cheese, side salads (that can be modified however you want), etc are all 4-6 dollars. So cheap, pretty good portions and delicious. i would definitely recommend. (longest. review. ever.)"
Marjorie M.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,107,1,4.0,12/18/2009,"We were using an early Christmas gift card from a friend,and  were really excited to go as I recently got out of the hospital after a five month stay after major surgery. Still using a W/C, so we were a little apprehensive about crowds, long waits, being able to maneuver the chair etc. No worries, as there were no people waiting! (Economy, ya think?) Service was quick & pleasant, if a little off. Hubby had the Charbroiled Flat Iron Steak. He thought it could have been hotter. His French Fries were way too salty. I had the Herb Crusted Fillet of Salmon. Both were delicious, cooked perfectly. So delicious we couldn't believe it  was a chain restaurant. All fish is advertised as fresh. New York Cheesecake for dessert. It came covered in whipped cream (Yuck!)) That was the only letdown. The cheescake itself wasn't as great or fresh as I remembered from a previous visit..Service became a little odd as our meal wore on, nothing major, just a loss of attention from our server to get extra lemon for the Salmon. After asking three times and being assured it was coming,  It  got delivered finally to the neighboring table by the busboy, who then saw us staring at the lemons, picked up the plate off that neighboring table and quickly plunked the lemons down at ours. Fortunately, they were not touched .Both of the tables were a little surprised at that one! Otherwise, overall, better than the average mall restaurant! Oh, and in December, please turn down the  A/C!"
Kelly I.,"Dublin, CA",50,341,1,3.0,2/12/2008,"It's a Cheesecake Factory.  It's a great location, well staffed, clean and professional.  I have still as of yet to order both a meal and a slice of cheesecake at the same sitting.  It's always one or the other.  The portions are huge, as usual, but it's got something for everyone.  I've even met people here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by my California inspired omelet.  I tend lean toward the fish and chips, club sandwich or orange chicken.   Definitely a good wait on a busy night."
May C.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",0,54,,4.0,6/9/2009,"I'm not usually a fan of chains but this place does a pretty good job.  I've been here a few times.  Once I came for a light dinner.  They have this small plate menu that really hit the spot.  We ordered the pizza, the tuna, the sliders and a few other things.  I really liked the variety and the portions were a lot less overwhelming than their regular dishes.  I've also been here for weekday lunch.  I like their lunch portions.  Tried the burger and a pasta.  Both pretty tasty.  The cheesecake speaks for itself - yummmmm.  The hostess stand cant probably use some improvement.  It's kind of chaotic and unorganized, but overall, pretty solid!"
Jenny D.,"Westminster, CA",31,48,21,2.0,6/27/2009,"This was my first time at this particular location.  It was Friday night at around 8:30.  We got seated right away at a table for two.  They have a new menu of small bites.  I have had gastric bypass.  I can eat only little portions.  I asked the waitress how big the pizzaettes were and she showed me with her hands how tiny they were.  Basically she made it seem like they were only slightly larger that a stack of cards.  My friend asked about the ahi and the waitress told her it was only one small bite and that this menu was designed for a lot of sampling with a group of people.  Because of my bypass I decided to go with the small bites menu and ordered the sausage pizzaette and the crispy artichoke hearts.  As we waited, they delivered us lots of bread.  My friend and I ate quite a bit of this - assuming we didn't have much food coming.  When the food arrived I was quite surprised.  The pizzaette is actually a good size.  It was about ten inches long and four inches wide in an oblong shape.  The plate of artichoke hearts had at least 15 on it.  Needless to say I could only eat one piece of the pizza.  I got it boxed and my friend had her's boxed as well.  We advised the guy that took our food who got what.  He gave us our separate bags and we didn't think to look inside.  Since my friend was ordering cheesecake, I decided to try one of their latte's.  They said they had soy milk which I had to have because I'm lactose intolerant.  It was expensive though at five dollars.  She didn't mention that the soy milk would be extra.  On the way home I started to feel very nauseated and bloated.  I think they gave me regular milk as I'm still feeling the after effects.  I opened my box a little while ago to discover I didn't get my food.  There were about three onion rings in there.  I had a whole pizzaette and like 15 artichoke hearts that I didn't get.  I'm pissed.  I guess I should have looked, but I've never had them give me someone else's food before.  So 17 dollars later, I got a small slize of pizza and a coffee.  This place bummed me out."
Jamie A.,"Irvine, CA",10,55,,3.0,11/15/2008,"The ladies and I are happy hours fanatics. . . I'm not a huge drinker but when I meet up with the girlie's I'll have a cocktail, two at the very most. I was out furniture shopping with a girlfriend earlier at the Shops and we decided to have some friends meet us at The Cheesecake Factory for some cocktails. I knew the one the Spectrum had a great happy hour on food so we thought we might be able to get some good drinks as well. I guess my three stars is mainly due to the fact that during HAPPY HOUR drinks were full price and we were spending around 10$ a drink. . .OK I'M NOT VERY HAPPY during HAPPY hour. But it does get a high five for the good eats during that time. We always do the lettuces wraps, pot stickers (which are OK but I have a special place in my heart for them) and the tex mex egg rolls that rocks. . .I'm addicted to the sauce. WE share so we save room for the Adam's Peanut Butter Ripple (or something close to that) I'm not a Peanut Butter fan unless it's in a PB&J but I'm addicted to this cheesecake. I have to sneak it in since my bf would kill me if he saw my diet of cheesecake and booze (since I'm on a new Holiday Diet) but I think it was all well worth it."
Annalisa A.,"Dana Point, CA",54,144,1,4.0,3/12/2007,"Cheesecake Factory is a classic!  I've always loved Cheesecake Factory, even despite the ridiculously long waits.  This particular one, located at The Shops at Mission Viejo, always provides great service.  Everyone in your party can find something they like on their vast menu.  I haven't had a bad meal there yet, and I've probably tasted over half of their menu items over the years.  I tend to get the Chicken Madeira or the Chicken Marsala a lot - they are great!  The Pasta Da Vinci is also good if you like the Chicken Madeira, but feel like having pasta.  They also have great appetizers - some of my favorites are the Avocado Egg Rolls, the Thai Lettuce Wraps (which are also good as your main course), and the Firecracker Salmon Roll.  Of course, the desserts are to die for at Cheesecake Factory, so take half your meal home for leftovers and save room for dessert.  If you can't possibly stick another bite of food in your mouth after the large portions you just enjoyed, make sure you take some dessert home for later.  My ultimate favorite is the Chocolate Tuxedo Cream Cheesecake...it is so amazingly good."
