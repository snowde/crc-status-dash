Tim B.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/10/2017,I had the worst experience. When we first arrived and sat down the waiter disappeared for 30 minutes and didnt acknolodge us at all. The food that I order hurt my stomach all night and wasnt that good. Will not come back.
Taylor A.,"San Clemente, CA",390,8,2,3.0,2/25/2017,"Love cheesecake factory and have come here for many meals but this experience was one where I would think twice before coming again. The food was really good, and we got a couple ""Georgia peach"" cocktails that were really pretty and tasted great. But our whole experience here took a total of two hours, so we're lucky we weren't in a rush. We put an order in while we were waiting for someone in our party to decide, and once she did, her order came out before ours. And after that it took even longer for our food to come out. I'm a server and understand the time frames and run around of a restaurant, and we hardly got checked on, food was forgotten to be put in, and to top it all off, once we got desert, the cakes were tiny! The server was really nice, and like I mentioned, the food was yummy. But over all experience was disappointing."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,10/11/2016,"Enormous menu, way too many options, you get bored with the menu, way too much reading and way too overwhelming. Service was rushed, they are way too busy to offer great service. Prices are a bit high for the quality that you get, don't expect great meats, best to stick to the basic dishes. You can tell the food is mass produced and while it is a bit better than some of your run of the mill chain restaurants, it's not a place I would chose to return to."
Kayla M.,"San Diego, CA",170,3,,3.0,3/15/2017,Super awesome staff and love the food unfortunately I just bit into my avocado egg roll and pulled out a good sized avocado peel  Mistakes happen but those egg rolls ain't cheap!!
M H.,"Newport News, VA",1,24,6,1.0,5/3/2016,Horrible. I actually work in this mall and will never eat here again.  I wanted to treat one of my employees for making her goal.  First time.. Last time.  And you don't know the rest. So Disgusting
Marie Y.,"Dana Point, CA",0,21,8,1.0,1/8/2017,"Oh Cheesecake Factory, how disappointed I was with today's food. Had the greasiest Americana cheeseburger to the point that I was so gassy and felt horrible after I left the restaurant.  I only hate half and it was just awful. My friends had their usual and it was not like before. One had the jambalaya and the other had the crab hash. Both were bland and not seasoned right.  The potatoes were so crispy hard, and the bread was buttered to the point that it was oily. My fiance had the beef dip and once again, so oily.  My fiance's dad had already returned his Bruleed French toast after one bite, so we didn't want to return all our plates. What's going on Cheesecake Factory? It can't be that all our food is bad. You're slipping. Maybe it was just today, but please make your food better."
Chris L.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",246,12,14,4.0,5/4/2017,Went here to celebrate our sons birthday.  The miso salmon was perfectly cooked (surprising with how big there menu is).  Also the Louisiana chicken pasta was amazing. Service was good and the restaurant wasn't overly crowded.
Jesse P.,"Orange, CA",61,285,330,4.0,4/6/2016,This is a review of their restroom clean courteous staff very clean urinal urinal cakes excellent and I was very please with the door and opened it swung wide and I was very happy with the low flow year and also didn't waste a lot of water because of the drought here in Southern California I went on I would give the cheesecake factory a wonderful restroom review All I give it a thumbs up for the restrooms
Rhiannon R.,"Apple Valley, CA",9,13,1,5.0,2/5/2017,"My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and having never been here, we weren't sure what to expect. But we heard good things, and we were definitely not disappointed. Wait time was about 45 minutes, which wasn't too bad. After we were sat down, we ordered an appetizer and drinks, which came back in decent time and were really really good.  It took a little longer for our main entree's to come out, but a supervisor came out and let us know that there was a mistake in the kitchen and they were really professional. When we did get our entree's, the food was phenomenal. Oh and you bet we got cheesecake. Service was excellent, food was amazing and the price wasn't TOO bad. You get what you pay for, and I can honestly say that I would definitely go back there."
T A.,"Laguna Woods, CA",0,26,,1.0,8/26/2017,"Had dinner with a friend tonight and food was fantastic, but management was totally unsympathetic when I accidentally left my credit card there. The manager, a blond heavyset woman, claimed that the credit card was in the little black book with the bill but it wasn't. Just disappointed because they wouldn't even acknowledge that they *might've* forgotten to return it to me and that I was inconvenienced for having the drive back all the way to the Shops at Mission Viejo to pick it up. I spoke with two managers--one on the phone and a second when I arrived (blond heavyset woman)--and neither were sympathetic or even acknowledged it could've been server's fault. Would recommend going to a better restaurant with better customer service."
Sammi G.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,30,20,1.0,2/20/2016,"We have gone to this restaurant for many years. We know managers, waiters, bartenders and customers that frequent this location.  We enjoy the food, and usually the experience.  Everything has been good except without fail, the women's bathroom.  The women's bathroom has been disgusting each and every time we have been there. The floors are wet, paper is everywhere, trash cans overflowing, and often there is no toilet tissue.  It does beg the question- if they take so little  care of the restroom, does that follow through to the kitchen?"
Kiana B.,"Capistrano Beach, CA",134,5,6,4.0,7/23/2017,"I ordered from their lower calorie menu, the steak medallions with Sparagus and mushrooms.  It was delicious, slightly sweet. I would give them more stars if it weren't for the fact that with the exception of taking our orders and bringing our food the servers were no where in sight. No refills unless you asked, had to get up and get small plates on my own for the dessert cause the server disappeared again. But great food!"
Abby K.,"Dana Point, CA",52,2,1,1.0,7/9/2017,"Went there this morning for brunch. And I ordered it to go, and I was expecting much better then what I received. I ordered the Brûlée French toast and it was awful. I've had it a couple times before and it was nothing like how It was before. They usually have a really good syrup and they powder it in sugar. But when I got home and looked at it it was just two pieces of bread. They didn't powder sugar on it and they threw cheap, sugar free, Smuckers syrup that tasted like cheap sugar. Now a couple hours later I'm sitting in bed with food poisoning. Thanks for a great start to my day Cheesecake Factory!"
Wendy W.,"Dana Point, CA",0,14,5,3.0,3/15/2017,"I order delivery from here about once every few weeks. Sometimes the food is good, many times it's cold and they forget food or condiments as requested. Today I spent $60 on the order and asked for ranch side- the container had about 1 Tbsp of ranch in it. Ridiculous considering this ruined my dinner salad as an entree. Someone in management needs to monitor more closely the employees handling to go order. We may not be present, but we live locally and order more regularly, pay more, and expect the same quality of orders as if we're dining in house."
Wendy B.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",9,124,1,1.0,2/24/2017,"Very disappointed..been coming here done the original Cheesecake opened in Beverly Hills many, many years ago! This time was awful...bad service...mushroom soup was over salted & over cooked..we were told they were out of soup spoons...it was 6:00 pm what??? Missing a place setting so we asked & never received...then server told us to use one that was sitting at end of table by another patron..order 3 entrees from Skinylishous menu, 2 cups of soup, Sweetcorn Tamale appetizer which was a lukewarm pile of mush, 5 glasses of Ice tea & 2 very small slices of cheesecake (used to be a good size slice).... for $120.00 +tip are you kidding???  Side note: We never complained..it was a special planned dinner & did not want to ruin the mood..we just smiled through a terrible dinner!"
Bobbi B.,"Las Vegas, NV",3260,235,536,4.0,1/22/2016,"I've eaten at this location for many years and the one thing I can say is that The Cheesecake Factory is pretty consistent. Even from location to location, the food tastes pretty much the same. I've never ordered anything that I hated or had any experience stick out in my head as being unpleasant. The service at this location is always excellent. Pretty much everything I've tried on their menu has been good. Their bread is addicting but keep it away from me. I'm partial to the dark brown loaf and I could eat tons of it if given the opportunity. That's why I don't even let them bring it. I know myself too well! A few personal favorites are the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Fire Roasted Artichoke for appetizers... Spicy Cashew Chicken on Spaghettini instead of rice, or their Cobb Salad for entrees. They had a really amazing Pineapple Jalapeño cocktail on their menu that got the axe recently. That sort of pissed me off but hey, what can you do?  The menu can be a bit overwhelming but as the saying goes, ""variety is the spice of life"". If you subscribe to that theory, I have a feeling that you will like The Cheesecake Factory. THE BEST cheesecake EVER is their Godiva Cheesecake. It's truly heavenly. Last meal on earth, I'm ordering that for dessert. I back up that fact by putting it in writing on my Yelp profile."
Michelle M.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,23,,2.0,5/6/2017,"I used to love going here because of their delicious and refreshing luau salad. I was disappointed to find out that the item had been discontinued, especially because servers said it was one of the most popular. At my waiter's suggestion, I tried one of the replacement salads and it was lacking in flavor and freshness. I was a regular here, but don't think I'll be returning until they bring back the luau."
Dawn K.,"San Clemente, CA",0,21,,2.0,5/3/2017,"One of our favorite places to have dinner at the mall, but!  The although service is great, the FOOD TAKES   F O R E V E R . . .  Do NOT eat here if you are in a hurry."
Jennifer B.,"Orange, CA",0,2,2,4.0,12/6/2016,The staff are incredible !  Every time I'm in town I take my girlfriends to the shops Cheesecake Factory ! And we order the entire skinny- lissios menue ! It's great !
Mark C.,"Laguna Hills, CA",95,9,29,5.0,10/29/2016,"The waiters service was on point. There were certain circumstances where one order came out later and it wasn't correct when it did, but that was more a cook issue. It was quickly rectified and handled with a free slice of cheesecake. The guy waiter who was outside tonight was a hard worker and his skills as a waiter definitely have him set in an example that every waiter and or waitress should strive to set. Thank you."
