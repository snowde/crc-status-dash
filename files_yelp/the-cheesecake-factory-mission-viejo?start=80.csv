Randy B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",21,18,10,5.0,12/3/2016,"Stopped in for dinner because we haven't been here for awhile. We got lucky with a table in the bar, because the wait for the dining room was over an hour. Lindsey was our server and she was fabulous! What a great personality eventhough she was extremely busy. We asked her for some recommendations and they were spot on. Lindsey is who every restaurant owner/manager would want on their team.  Keep up the great work Lindsey K."
Christine B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",464,214,611,3.0,1/19/2016,"One of the things that I really love about the Cheesecake Factory is their consistency. It doesn't matter which one you go to, you'll get flavorful food, attentive service (usually) and delicious desserts. On my last visit I got the Caesar Salad with Chicken from the Skinnylicious menu. It was HUGE!  I was expecting a small, appetizer sized salad but this was a full size and full flavor salad. On the minus side we had less than stellar service from our server this time. We had to ask for bread twice and she didn't ask if we wanted coffee with our dessert. That would have been an easy boost to her tip but she didn't ask and we didn't order. And speaking of bread, what happened to the bread?  For one, the last couple of visits it's been dry and second of all, why are they not slicing the sourdough?  What's up with that? Here's hoping that we get better service next time!"
Leigh Anne G.,"Carlsbad, CA",31,50,4,2.0,5/7/2017,"Typically I am a HUGE Cheesecake Factory fan, eating at one at least twice a month, sometimes more.  However, this location is the worst I've ever encountered.  My firecracker salmon roll was burned, the sauce to cover the cabbage was non-existent, and the bread was served rock hard and cold.  When the waiter came to pick up my uneaten plate of food, he ask ""Would you like a box for that."" After explaining information above, he responded with ""ok"" and walked away.  My glass nor my husbands glass was never refilled..... DON'T go there!!"
Danny B.,"Irvine, CA",0,9,,3.0,9/30/2017,"With a party of 3 it took us nearly 1.5 hours to get in and out. We arrived at 4:45pm on a sat. and was seated right away. Not sure the delay. The food was average. The cheesecake is always good, but entrees were just average."
Sean T.,"Beverly Grove, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,5.0,6/12/2017,"We dined this evening after a long day in the hospital and I wanted to give a very special shout out to Dallas. My mother is a vegan and her orders can be complicated. She ordered a dish that ended up having egg in it and Dallas (who was not our server at time) went out of her way to catch this before it went out and personally came over to our table to inform my mother. Aside from the good catch that my mother was very thankful for, Dallas was so sweet, kind and brought a lot of positivity and good vibes to my mother on a tough day. So thank you Dallas! We will return specifically because of genuine people like you."
Kristin Leigh M.,"Las Flores, CA",702,1127,1788,5.0,1/4/2015,"I love Cheesecake Factory for its variety (though I usually order one of two things). Particularly, I like the Mission Viejo location. It is considerably less crowded than the nearby location at The Spectrum. Sure, you'll still have to wait a bit on a busy night - but 10 - 15 minutes is much better than 50+. Service has always been top notch here (and at any Cheesecake Factory). Last time we dined at this location, the server forgot to put our order in, but was very remorseful, and apologized profusely.  If you're struggling to find something to eat in the novel of a menu, I recommend the crusted chicken romano or the chinese chicken salad. Crusted chicken romano, if you're in a hungry mood or the salad if you're feeling healthy. If you get the salad, I recommend you get the noodle straws on the side (they are a bit overbearing) and the dressing on the side, too, as sometimes they can douse it. I love the complimentary bread that they serve; I could LIVE off of it! If you're looking for cheesecake (which I actually don't eat), my husband adores the cookie dough one. You can get it to go if you're just too stuffed after your meal. Indoor and outdoor seating available."
Kari S.,"Laguna Hills, CA",4,23,6,4.0,8/27/2016,"Went with friends for lunch yesterday, it was about 11:15 am and by noon they were pretty much full. Service was good at first, by the middle of our meal are waitress seemed to be overwelmed, she had by that time 7 tables she was working. It seemed like we were more of a chore and not a job.   The food was really good , it did take a while to come out. I had the mushroom burger and yum full of flavor cooked perfect. I had a salad with it that tasted like weeds, hated it. My daughter had the lunch salmon which was such a good value and a good size.  Of course we had cheesecake never can go wrong there, our table had kona coffee, red velvet,  and oreo."
Molly M.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/9/2017,Don't ever try their curbside pickup. It took 6 minutes just to get through on the phone to tell them I was here and then another 4 minutes before they came out and then another 4 minutes to come back with the credit card. They really don't support this offering at all.
andrea s.,"San Pedro, CA",0,22,2,2.0,10/20/2016,"So typically I really enjoy Cheesecake Factory. Last night it was just awful. We called in an order for pick up. The girl on the phone was terrible. We ordered the soup of the day, steak Dianne, cheesecake and some bread on the side. We picked everything up and the bowl of soup was half gone?! It was the biggest waste of money! Almost $9 for a small scoop. I was really disappointed. The steak Dianne was ok my husband said. The cheesecake was their saving grace. The pumpkin cheesecake was a sure winner!!! Hoping next time we go back the service is better and the soup is less measly."
Bill Y.,"Seneca, SC",0,369,135,4.0,2/15/2017,I had the SkinnyLicious hamburger with a salad. It was good but they added too much salt while it was being prepared . The servers were great and the meal came in a short time. It's a large restaurant and the tables are far enough apart that you are able talk to others at your table.
Matt R.,"San Clemente, CA",142,85,25,4.0,7/15/2016,"Always good and the portion and quality of.food.for the price is always a us for me. Cheesecake has a brand of quality food for a good price and drinks as well, and they always live up to that in my experience.  Although it's not generally my first pick for dinner or lunch, we seem to end up here often and I'm never dissatisfied."
Jeff K.,"San Clemente, CA",472,246,619,4.0,12/28/2015,"It's always good.. expect a wait! So I've been coming to MV location for years. It's consistently great for brunch, lunch  or dinner. You'll should expect a wait as they are always busy. But keep in mind, if you see a tall table open in the bar you can order dinner from there as well. LOCATION & AMBIANCE (Rating 3.75) The location is a bit hidden, but if you're been to the mall a few times it's not hard to find and there's valet parking right next to the door. The interior is large (as most Cheesecake factories are) and well appointed. It's a bit noisy so it's not easy to carry on a conversation with people that aren't sitting close to you but depending on where you sit it can be quieter.  The patio is actually pretty nice and well heated as well.  SERVICE (Rating 4.25) Their servers are always well trained and do a pretty good job. From time to time they'll be a bit busy so they can get overwhelmed and a bit harder to find your specific server but there always seems to be 5-6 others running around that are happy to help. SUNDAY BRUNCH ITEMS ============================= CALIFORNIA OMELETTE (Rating 4.25)  So this thing is big! It comes with avocado, mushrooms, green onion, tomato, garlic, shallots, jack & cheddar cheeses and sour cream. The only thing missing is ham. So I usually fix that by having it added. Their potatoes are always good, but sometimes (like today) get a bit over-cooked. The sour dough bread is amazing as is most of the breads they serve. CARAMEL ROYAL MACCHIATO (Rating 3.75) This thing is typically just a little to sweet for me and it usually isn't very hot due to the amount of cream put into it. It's a double espresso, hot caramel, vanilla and steamed milk. It's super tasty and I sometimes will just add some coffee to it to make it less sweet and hotter. They should really pay more attention to the temperature these come out at IMO though and my rating would have increased."
Sylvanah W.,"Long Beach, CA",112,25,39,5.0,3/1/2016,"I called on a previous day to ask if I could make reservations and at first I was told that they did not take any reservations. As soon as I was able to speak to a manager, I was able to make a reservation for my wedding reception for 20 people. They had two long tables for me to pick from and were very helpful. On the day of, we had more people than planned to come to dinner. Instead of 20, there were now 30 and even with 10 more, they were able to seat us outside in one big group. The staff here was so friendly and interacting with the guests to make sure that everyone had what they needed. They were on top of everything and I couldn't have asked for better service.  My step mom and dad were even able to come early to store a cake in their fridge till it was time for us to cut the cake. After this, the staff was kind enough to cut the rest of the cake and serve it to our guests.  I couldn't have asked for better service on this special day and everything was so amazing from the music, to the area we were seated to the staff who accommodated our every need. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for a place to eat."
Cameron P.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,8,3,1.0,5/6/2017,"Just picked up two pasta dishes to go. My boyfriends filled the entire container. Mine didn't even fill half of the container. Yet, they cost the same price. Also, he paid to add chicken and got exactly four small pieces. Extremely disappointed considering how much it cost."
Lamita M.,"San Diego, CA",2,29,11,4.0,3/1/2017,I don't remember a time where I had something that I didn't like..The fettuccini Alfredo is tasty and of course the cheesecake BUT they're not a place that I would ever crave !
Mike L.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",332,134,401,5.0,1/30/2016,"You can never go wrong with this classic eatery. I came here on a Saturday night and expected a long wait but pleasantly surprised to find they were fast efficient with the service so kudos to cheesecake for making this wait short. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp with the carpachio yellow tail dish on the side.  These are a must!  You'll love the curry peanut taste of the bang bang and the fish is fresh as can be. The rice was perfectly made and each time you visit, your greeted with as smile and fresh complementary breads that are delicious. .  Lastly, the prices are very reasonable and when you end your meal with a huge selection of cheesecakes, you can't go wrong.  Order the white chocolate macadamia nut cheeseca6and you will be happy..."
Cory K.,"San Clemente, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/4/2017,"My wife and I just had one of the best dinners in our life at the Cheesecake Factory in Mission Viejo. We were seated and greeted by our server very quickly. Bianca was very friendly and extremely attentive - would definitely recommend asking for her! Our appetizers came out in a timely manner and as soon as those plates were cleared from our table the entrees were brought out. Let's talk about these portion sizes for a second - I just got three meals in one when they brought out this massive plate piled high with pasta. What a great value for your money! We were so stuffed even with taking three quarters of our meal home, and of course we had to snag a cheesecake to go! We will be back, in fact I think we just found our new favorite date night stop."
Lauren H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,43,2,2.0,8/16/2017,"Ate in the bar area last night. Walked in and wasn't greeted by the hostess, she was preoccupied. I finally asked her if I could sit in the bar area. She told me that the bar and high tops are first come, first serve. I asked her about the regular seats in the bar area, she said I'd have to put my name in (this was after 9pm). I asked her if I could put my name in for the regular bar tables. She seemed slightly frazzled and told me that she'd be right with me, she said this just as another hostess walked up. The second hostess asked if she could help me. I told her that I'd like to wait for a regular table in the bar area. She told me that that section was now closed, and that they weren't seating any more parties there because there isn't a server assigned to that section anymore, even though there were people sitting there with menus. Fair enough. I used to work in restaurants in college so I know the drill. I took a seat in a high top in the bar area. It was almost 10 minutes before I was greeted and given a menu. The couple in the high top next to me had several questions about the menu, and then when the bartender placed their order, they needed it modified because they forgot to mention no tomatoes in the salad. This made a frazzled bartender even more scurried and frazzled. He had to go back to the kitchen and tell the cooks. The couple next to me wanted to read a menu again even though they had already placed an order (I get it, they were being slightly high maintenance) that's when I finally got a menu. I eventually had my order taken. I wanted the Santa Fe salad but without chicken. I asked the bartender if I would still get charged full price even though I didn't want the chicken. Without even asking his manager, he told me ""yes."" Fair enough. I was just hungry and tired of waiting at this point. Both of the bartenders were older men, and they both scurried around the whole bar area all night, very frazzled, speed walking, etc, and the well nor bar were slammed. Two high tops down from me a woman even complained to one of the bartenders. I could hear her say something about ""adderal"" which I believe is a Rx drug to treat ADD. The whole vibe was just awkward. Then the other bartender zoomed past me not once, but twice, and didn't hear me when I shouted ""excuse me!"" Because my cup of water had been empty for more than 5 minutes, which is an eternity while you're eating. The couple next to me heard me try to get the bartender's attention to no avail, and the husband shouted ""Eric!"" On my behalf To get the guy's attention. Again, the bar area was not that busy at all. 3 high tops were occupied and there were two patrons sitting at the bar. Tickets printing in the well were scarce, so it's not like they were slammed. I've sat in the bar area several times in the past, and usually there's younger guys working, and it's like a well oiled machine. Young or old, I don't care. I just want decent service and to be checked on once in awhile. But watching these guys zoom around frantically the whole time made me anxious. Again, there were other tables complaining too, so I'm not just exaggerating. It was uncomfortable. The next time I sit in the bar I'll check to see who's working first."
Keith C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",21,18,13,5.0,10/8/2016,Had chorizo avocado omelette wanted my wife had The Farmhouse omelette and the kids had and hamburger and Services was great and a short wait to come
Chris C.,"San Clemente, CA",6,19,2,2.0,3/14/2017,It's great. It's Cheesecake Factory. But honestly the menu is a bit tired. The bread is never warm. It's like I think my expectations are just lower cause you know what you are getting. It's not bad. It just isn't that great anymore. It's all super bad for you and it's all really expensive. I mean fish and chips is $17.95. Come on man. That's a rip off.
