McKenzie B.,"Provo, UT",128,115,128,5.0,12/15/2017,"Here's the deal... The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant and although I typically try to stick to smaller, local joints, I LOVE eating here. It's just a classic chain choice. The menu options can be overwhelming but if you know what to get ahead of time, you won't be disappointed. That's why I'm here to tell you what to get! The avocado egg rolls are a MUST when it comes to appetizers and I love the Thai lettuce wraps as a meal (even though they are listed as an appetizer). The orange chicken is also a hit but make sure you ask for extra sauce since the chicken can sometimes be a little dry. If you're wanting something heavier, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also delicious if you are wanting something heavier.  The pros: HUGE portions, warm bread before your meal, lots of items to choose from and TONS of yummy dessert options, duh! The cons: dark, loud, and the menu options can be overwhelming, a little pricier than other chain restaurants. And most importantly, you can't go wrong with any of their cheesecake flavors (especially any peanut butter / chocolate combo)."
Kyle C.,"South Jordan, UT",1,11,,3.0,12/28/2017,"I have mixed feelings about this place. I enjoy it for what it is, but sometimes I really don't have the best experience when I try new things. I learned to stop trying different menu items and just stick with the three cheese pasta, or the spaghetti and meatballs. Those two dishes are very consistent and really good. You get large portions, and I'm always full with leftovers. Unfortunately, the steaks really aren't worth it (except Steak Diane, which is just okay). I had the filet mignon, and my wife had the ribeye. They were both mediocre, and I wouldn't order them again for the price we paid. It reminded me of a ""nicer"" Applebee's steak, which is the last place you should be getting steak from. They were cooked alright, but the meat was a bit stringy and tasted lower-quality (perhaps even lower grade) than other steaks in the area. Like mentioned above, neither of us have been overly impressed with any dish other than the pastas. Still, we find ourselves back there after shopping sometimes.  The waiters are friendly but usually a bit stiff due to how busy they are (being right next to the mall) we often don't get refills on drinks until it's too late, and the limited interactions we have with them feel rushed  The desserts aren't great unless you get cheesecake (go figure, it's in the name). I would skip dessert unless you're dying for cheesecake. Even then, there are way too many choices and I would advise sticking to tried and true flavors. I recently tried their chocolate layer cake, and it was dry and boring.  Despite other reviews, I love the dark ambience of this restaurant. To be honest, I think it makes the experience better, and a semi-romantic place to take a date or spouse. Basically, the darkness makes this restaurant seem way nicer than it actually is. This is a great ""stepping stone"" if you're just getting into nicer restaurants, because it's pricier and better than, say, Applebee's, but won't completely break the bank. We eat here when we want pasta, but definitely not when we want to eat at a super nice restaurant. The menu is way too jumbled and confusing, and they need to cut out a lot of random dishes that I can't imagine a lot of people are ordering.  My biggest negative about this restaurant is that I feel like it hasn't figured out what it wants to be. Is it...an Italian restaurant? Is it...a nicely disguised diner? Is it a literal factory where they make black-market cheesecake, and the restaurant is just a clever attempt at distraction? We may never know."
Lee B.,"South Jordan, UT",198,79,347,4.0,11/30/2017,"Ok, so I have been going to the The Cheesecake Factory since I can remember. Growing up near several in Southern California gave me the opportunity to watch the restaurant grow and evolve. This Cheesecake is a great example of what it has become.  While the wait always seems to be long at this location, the staff is pretty welcoming and there is a good of space to sit inside, or you can wonder over to Z Gallery (another review coming). I love how the indoor seating has a nicely located cheesecake display, giving you the opportunity to decide what cake you want, before you indulge in bread and giant sized portions.  The restaurants design is very similar to most other Cheesecakes I have been in, with the exception of the bar area (that's a whole other story though). The seating comfortable and spread out. Tables are large, as they have to be for the ginormous plates.  Service is very structure and always seems to be by the book. I am always impressed with the team work atmosphere of the staff. You never feel like you are being ignored.  The food is always pretty consistent. I have never had an item that deviated greatly from the norm. While it is not exceptional, it is always good. The menu offer more then enough options to satisfy a small army, let alone your family.  The Cheesecake Factory has changed over the years, but it seems to have found its place and is staying there for the time being. If you want a lot choices and big portions, and willing to wait for a table, you have found your place."
Evan A.,"Orem, UT",47,56,97,4.0,11/11/2017,"Love coming here. Closest Cheesecake Factory in Utah county. The staff is always friendly, wait times are fair.  The good is incredible. Today I had the salmon and it was cooked to perfection.  Was juicy, had the right amount of crisp to it and the lemon perfected the meal.  I ordered the side of asparagus as always because it comes out cooked perfect!   Our service is always top notch and love coming her in special occasions."
Kimberlee S.,"Mirrormont, WA",10,8,,1.0,1/6/2018,"This particular Cheese Cake Factory has the worst customer service ever.  From the girl at the front tonight straight to the condescending, rude manager.  They make it obvious they don't care to have our large party of 9. This has been our favorite gathering spot for our family celebrations for years.  Time for New traditions I guess."
Barbara P.,"Honolulu, HI",30,100,131,3.0,9/22/2017,"Stopped by to grab dessert, why is it so dark, in here?!  Does the food look that bad?!  They can have ambience w/turning most of the lights off...have to use my flashlight on my IPhone to read my menu.  There's nothing romantic about a dark restaurant, not knowing if that's what you really ordered. Thank goodness, all I'm having is carrot cake..."
Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",992,1005,3062,4.0,10/18/2017,"Cheesecake Factory has a spot in my heart.. or shall I say stomach haha. They have such a huge menu that is the same no matter where you go. One problem with that is that it can't be all delicious when you have such a large menu, but I have a few favorites that I love and can count on. Their cheesecakes are delicious too! So good - everyone of them! Customer service has always been good here. Like all Cheesecake Factory's, there is always a ridiculously long wait time - especially at this one! Everyone and their moms come and eat dinner here haha so allow time, or you will find yourself walking around the mall or going somewhere else!"
Jared K.,"Riverton, UT",213,72,11,1.0,1/6/2018,"Do not come here on a Saturday night, totally not worth a 1.5 hour wait for mediocre food or overpriced desserts. They really should get a reservation system or a cell phone alert system."
Oulie T.,"Sandy, UT",450,1158,1005,4.0,1/1/2018,What?! Only an average rating of 3 stars? What's up people? This little Cheesecake Factory spot totally deserves 4 stars at least! I dock them a star for being too dimly lit inside and not having a happy hour. In CA we loved hitting up Cheesecake Factory during happy hour but I suppose with Utah's weird liquor laws Happy hour isn't a thing here.
Louisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",890,1080,6699,2.0,5/26/2017,"I love The Cheesecake Factory but this location never fails to provide a disappointing experience. I just stopped by for a late lunch today and everything just seemed to be a little ""off."" First, it was close to 2 pm and there were two dozen customers just hanging out in the lobby waiting to be seated in the nearly empty restaurant. Never a good sign. I promptly approached the hostess stand and the hostess was very short tempered and actually quite rude when asking, exasperated and with a loud sigh, ""how many?"" I told her two, and she literally snapped back ""give me 10 minutes okay?"" Um, wow, if you are having such a bad day, maybe you need to go take a little break and chill out. That's a surefire way to run off customers.  We were seated and finally approached by our server, and she too seemed to be really annoyed like she really, REALLY hated her job. She wasn't even remotely pleasant. I've rarely had servers that are so unhappy and unpleasant; it was so noticeable that we almost got up to leave, but we were so hungry (and I was craving avocado egg rolls) so we opted to stay.  The appetizer was good, but was haphazardly flung on our table by some other waiter. When our lunches arrived almost 20 minutes later, the plates were messy and carelessly thrown together. Talk about unappetizing. A kitchen should always take great pride in presenting a pretty dish, but both of our plates were as sloppy as they come. I had asked for sauteed spinach instead of mashed potatoes with my herb crusted chicken dish, and I was served a handful of RAW spinach just slapped on my plate! What? I had to ask for sauteed spinach and of course our waitress was annoyed but come on, RAW spinach? The vegetables were all poorly cooked, from my minuscule portion of green beans to my husband's barely steamed asparagus. I think the cooks on duty need to be trained on how to properly prepare veggies, stat! Even worse, my chicken was SO rubbery, to the point where I had to get a steak knife just to cut it and I nearly wore out my jaw trying to chew it. I am not exaggerating. I know I should've sent it back to the kitchen but at this point I was just so hungry and wanted to be done with this disappointing meal.  I never, ever complain about dining experiences but I feel like folks need to be aware of the problems at this location. Maybe corporate will take notice? This location needs some serious help!"
Jade B.,"Lehi, UT",15,215,25,3.0,10/25/2017,"It's been a long time since I've been here. I came years ago and it left a distasteful experience last time hence why it's been so long. I wanted to leave a review though where I could remember my whole experience. So first off Saturday night super busy. So we try to plan to go little early like 5pm maybe the wait will be less. Nope still a 55 minute -75 minute wait. So we put our names down and wait. Get a booth seat which is nice and look over the menu.  Looked over the menu for a long long time before we were helped by our waitress. I've come to the conclusion too it's not there fault. There understaffed. They need more waitresses and waiters to turn tables over quicker. So the wait would always be less for those wanting to eat and they could make more money... just saying.  Anyway she takes are full order because we are beyond hungry and ready. Avocado Egg Rolls for appetizer, I got the Thai Lettuce Wraps as my entree, and my husband got the Enchiladas. Ended with a banana cream cheesecake to share.  So Avocado Egg Rolls! A+ they were amazing and actually like the highlight of my meal. My Thai Lettuce wraps were decently good too. My husband said his Enchiladas were good but not as good as a Mexican restaurant of course. He said the rice was terrible no flavor. The Avocado Egg Rolls $12 pretty pricy for a appetizer but possibly worth it in my opinion. Thai Lettuce wraps $15? Eh I've had better for cheaper. My husbands $15 Enchiladas. Also had better for cheaper.  Cheesecake worth it and yummy!  My conclusion is this... this place is lacking in service and needs some help with that to get people in and out the door quicker. Next is the quality of food vs the price isn't matching depending on the items. So overall experience is probably would only come back if someone I knew really really wanted to go."
Emily S.,"West Jordan, Salt Lake City, UT",54,82,67,1.0,10/24/2017,"Over priced for okay food.  The wait was ridiculous and I've walked by a lot the line is always long but I really wanted to try it so we excepted the wait time. I figured well if there's a long wait then the food must be great! It did not live up to my expectations at all. I ordered the gumbo and it just was blah, I like the Bayou's gumbo a whole lot better. The prices were stupid expensive and I will not return nor will I ever recommend this to a friend."
Elijah E.,"South Jordan, UT",3,13,3,3.0,11/25/2017,"I have tried this place many times. Every time that I have gone, I have never liked the food. I have tried many items and they just aren't that good. The noodles taste like plastic and tap water. Not to mention the price is way to high for the quality of the food.  The cheesecake and staff is the best part about this restaurant. The staff is friendly and always doing their best. The cheesecake is also amazing. If you go here, go for the cheesecake.   The atmosphere is not the best. It is way to dark and way to loud. I can't even have a conversation with the person across from me. The lighting is way to dark. I had to use a flashlight to just read the menu. It's not efficient to have the customers struggle to read the menu.  I don't think I will be returning. Every single time I've tried it, the food hasn't been good and the wait is way to long. Food quality is not the best. Only reason to go back would be for the cheesecake."
Daryl N.,"Provo, UT",46,64,58,4.0,7/2/2017,"I have never had a bad experience whether in SF, SLC or San Jose. I don't recall ever making a reservation but they do have a buzzer system that works from far away. My favorite time to go is on Sundays for brunch. Also if you read the first page on their menu you get a sense odntheir humble beginnings. American classics are offered with a twist. Prices range from $7 for kids to $13 for adults. They have alcohol (bloody Mary, mimosa) and They also have ethic specialties like plantains, southern fried chicken or fish and Italian. They menu is large but I love trying new things and having options at different price points. Consistently good food, great staff dessert."
Ryan M.,"Draper, UT",492,15,48,5.0,12/3/2017,Place is just good. Everything on the menu is good food. That is if you're into chain restaurants. If you're not don't go there. I'd appreciate it too because the line is already long enough.
Rachel C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,16,,1.0,1/10/2018,"Now I know why I never come here. The service is absolutely awful. My friend and I came here one night after shopping at the mall. We came a little later than I would usually go out, but we were hungry and the first thing we saw was Cheesecake Factory. We walk in and I immediately ask if they were still serving and the hostess replied with a ""yes, we still have a few hours until close"". Perfect! We get seated and we literally just sat there waiting for our server for 10 minutes before someone finally came. He took our drink order, and another 10 minutes past before we see him again. We get to ordering out meal and waited 45 minutes for our meal to be given to us. Mine was half cold, while my friend enjoyed hers. At this point I just want to go home. Anther 10 minutes to get our server to get us the check, another 10 minutes to get our cheesecakes, another 10 minutes to have the server correct a mistake on the bill, another 10 minutes for us to pay....you get the idea. We arrived around 9:00pm and left around 10:45pm. The food wasn't even worth the wait."
George C.,"Sandy, Salt Lake City, UT",6,94,108,3.0,9/17/2017,"I have been a fan of the Cheesecake Factory for years and I was glad that they finally made their way to Utah. My wife is a fan of their chicken piccata. I know it's a simple dish but they do a really good job with the lemon sauce with capers. I like their kobe burger and the smoke house BBQ burger but I normally go with their lunch pizza (margarita) and salad. I have tried a lot from their menu by try to save room for a cheesecake. I haven't had a bad cheesecake yet or one that I wouldn't order again. Tonight we came in for desert and have their newly updated recipe for carrot cake and I got the Dutch apple caramel streusel. Wow, both were really good. The service has always been great here and Holly tonight was no exception, she did great. And that goes for any Cheesecake Factory that I have ever gone to, the service makes or breaks the dinning experience . The only reason I am give them three stars is for the fact that this has to be one of the smallest and loudest of their restaurants that I have been to. Maybe they didn't think they would be as big as they are in Murray, Utah? The other restaurant in salt lake is a pretty good sized restaurant. But still, it's one of my favorite restaurants to go to.  09/17/2017 Today we came for the brunch and I had their chicken and waffles with eggs Benedict and I'm stuffed and didn't finish my plate. Everything was good except I wasn't a big fan of the maple syrup. It tasted like butterscotch, a bit too sweet for me. My better half had the skinny chicken pasta and she that was pretty good, it looked good. It almost made me feel guilty for having the chicken and waffles."
Veronica T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",184,113,546,5.0,11/25/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory has always been one of my favorite places to be at. So we had a large group last night so the service was good for such a busy table. Honestly, I usually get the same thing but it's always good hahah! The enchiladas are always so amazing. I just love the food here in general. Including the bread that they usually have. Personally I like the brown one lol. We got the nacho appetizer this time and that was amazing. The cheese and portion was perfect. I always love the portions, flavor and price here. Cheesecake Factory is a go to."
Lucius C.,"Fruita, CO",0,4,,3.0,1/3/2018,"This is a really okay choice for a restaurant. It's nothing special (of course, being a chain), but the food was decent and the service was alright. The wait time was almost excessive, with nearly an hour for our lunch (on a wednesday afternoon) and another 15 minutes for two slices of cheesecake. Overall, it was a bearable experience, but not one I'd soon repeat."
David T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",192,38,55,3.0,9/18/2017,The food here is consistent and good this is the one good thing this chain has going for itself. The service at this location on the other hand needs some serious work as the manager and the servers seem to not pay a lot of attention to alterations of items due to multiple food returns I can back that up.
Saynatry P.,"Orem, UT",53,113,218,4.0,8/5/2017,"Came in for lunch on a Tuesday and was PACKED. But it was also national Cheesecake day so not sure if it was busy because of that. I was with my friend and we were able to snag a seat at the bar. Our server was attentive and friendly. It's been a while since I've been but just as I remembered, portions are still just as huge! Come in hungry and leave with Cheesecake. Don't expect to have an intimate environment. You are almost always elbow to elbow with a stranger no matter where you sit in the restaurant. Food has always been good and made great left overs. I have never been disappointed with any of the many cheese cakes I've tried!"
Vida A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",228,783,39,3.0,10/4/2017,"This place is still going strong but we walked right in for lunch today.  Our server was awesome, didn't catch his name.  Bread came out fast with drinks.  I just always go with Rene's special.  It has a salad, the soup, and half a sandwich for $13, well worth it!  Wednesdays they serve mushroom soup and its the best!  Hearty and tasty.  The ranch dressing here is also phenomenal.  I know the cheesecake here is what to order but calling all my carrot cake peeps, the best! here! i know!  Why a 3 u say?  Always busy, bustling, and left wanting.  Service is hit and miss.  Food is usually, inconsistently, good."
Sage B.,"Aiea, HI",152,148,613,4.0,4/15/2017,"Cheesecake Factory is a affordable place to go to where you can enjoy beautifully plated items but not break the bank. I have been trying to get a chance to eat here but every time I come the wait is about 2 hours so I made sure to come around 3:00 pm so I was able to be seated quickly. If you come before 5:00 pm you can order off of their lunch specials menu which is a smaller version of their entrees, I also like that hey place the calories content next to the entrees. We ordered the fire fracker salmon for an appetizer, it was delicious and rolled in a thin wonton paper and sat on a miso sauce. I ordered the miso salmon with brown rice, the salmon was cooked perfectly and the lunch size was enough to keep me full. I'll admit I'm not a cheese cake dessert fan but I'm in love with their tiramisu cheese cake slice, it's a must if you are a fan of tiramisu."
Shirley Z.,"Salt Lake City, UT",257,127,449,3.0,2/14/2017,"Always crowded, the food is okay, and the service is slow.  I waited about 20 minutes on a weeknight to be seated. The restaurant was full and dim, so not my type of ambiance. I ordered the alfredo and it took another 10-15 minutes before it was served. The pasta was just okay, a little bland for my taste. I came mainly for the chocolate mousse cheesecake but took it to-go to enjoy my cheesecake in peace.  If you're here for the cheesecake, I'd recommend takeout. If you're here for the food, then good luck waiting."
Chantel H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",136,183,270,2.0,9/18/2017,"It's sad more places don't offer vegan/dairy free options, especially with how popular it is becoming. Of the four items considered vegan on the menu (with a menu that is 30 pages you'd think they'd offer a few more), I got Evelyn's favorite pasta which was pretty good. It is full of different vegetables, olive oil, and rigatoni pasta. The waiter brought me out extra olive oil because he knew the dish is pretty dry. There was a ""mix-up"" in the kitchen so my brother had to wait until our food was pretty much finished before he got his meal. My sister ordered gluten free pasta and found many different noodles mixed in with her pasta that was not gluten-free. That was very upsetting for her and resulted in her getting sick. You would think the chefs would be more considerate of someone's dietary needs especially if ordering their meal a certain way. I am never very impressed with Cheesecake Factory. It's a place I would never crave when wanting to go out to eat, there are far better restaurants in Utah. Check somewhere else out."
Meghan S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",85,65,46,4.0,10/30/2016,"First off, I want to state that I don't like their brunch. It's always cold and pretty bland (besides the caramel syrup), and I usually get items on their regular skinny menu for breakfast. The service is usually mediocre but today was fantastic! She's partly why the 4 star rating, i would give her five stars, so thank you so much, Ann B!!!!  Busser Nicefero and some other bussers are always cruising around the place every time we are here! I regularly get their bang bang chicken and shrimp, the ahí tar tar, beet salad, and Asian lettuce wraps (messy but fabulous). Can't forget to mention their desserts! I love the chocolate and carrot cake. Their cheesecakes are spotty. Sometimes they hit the spot and sometimes they're boring. This place is expensive but has large portions!"
Marv M.,"Pullman, WA",1,13,,5.0,11/22/2017,"Good food, great service, excellent (as in extensive) array of choices. Moderate pricing. Be prepared for a 12 page menu, plus a kid menu and a lower-calorie menu. Take the time to preview them online."
Kit D.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",31,8,5,4.0,9/6/2017,"What can I say about The Cheesecake Factory?? I think everyone likes this place. My boyfriend & I went here with his daughter during Labor Day weekend (Saturday) It was very busy, but surprisingly the wait was not very long. Only 15 minutes. We got there at 1pm. Our server was very offish, cold, bored, over-it. It was hard to read him, just not a very friendly guy but I can understand -maybe he was just very busy. He was however, very attentive & after fixing my bf's drink order from a Diet Coke to a regular Coke we never had to ask for a refill on our drinks or water. He just automatically picked up the glasses & returned with full glasses. So that's good. Our food came to us in a timely manner. Not a very long wait. It also arrived exactly how we requested it. Nothing out of the ordinary, just tempura fish rather than grilled fish in the tacos. My bf had his usual of Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo, I ordered fish tacos, & his daughter had the Alfredo no chicken added. All the food was delicious as usual. Our experience was overall good."
Angie N.,"West Jordan, UT",0,8,,4.0,12/27/2017,"The food is phenomenal!  If the review was based on food, it would definitely get 5 stars!  This restaurant is extremely dim inside.  When we dined there last night there were people getting their cellphone flashlights to read the menu!  Crazy dim!  Our waitress was incredibly kind. She was punctual and made sure everything was going well.  At the end of the dinner she took my husband's credit card and disappeared for several minutes.  Apparently she set it down and left it somewhere, her manager picked it up.  Needless to say that was uncomfortable but, it all worked out.  We will be watching our credit card closely for fraudulent transactions."
Stef A.,"West Jordan, UT",27,108,99,4.0,8/13/2017,"Pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. Our wait on a Sunday afternoon was nonexistent and the service was great. The menu can be daunting, I mean there's over 13 pages of options so it can be a little difficult choosing your meal. On the plus side even the pickiest eater can be happy dining here. My friend ordered the avocado egg rolls which were delicious with a nice sweet sauce. I ordered the chicken parmesan pizza style entree which was basically all chicken. It was chicken parm in the shape of a pizza topped with slightly  under-seasoned garlic pasta. Overall it was good, different but good. A little salt on the pasta and it really hit the spot. My friend had the chicken and waffles Benedict which was also really good. The chicken was perfectly fried and the waffle was nice and fluffy. The hollandaise sauce wasn't the best, but the maple sauce was delicious. Bonus is that the serving sizes are so big you have enough for another meal. I'll definitely be coming back again and trying some of their many, many options."
Tara R.,"Riverton, UT",149,2,,1.0,10/25/2017,"I'd leave zero stars if I could. Took over an hour to get our food. We had to different servers who were both very rude, I've been a loyal Cheesecake Factory customer, I will not be coming back. And I'll make make sure not to return, customer service and food was horrid."
Lata T.,"West Jordan, UT",3,38,91,2.0,7/8/2017,"Service was slow due to amount of people that come here. If you spill water,  plan on cleaning it up yourself,  it's hard to get somebody here that cares. Our server seen me cleaning up poured water & didn't try to assist. Regardless of how busy you are,  waitors/waitress should still be attentive.  Big pet peeve of mine. She doesn't fill up my glass until I was ready to leave. If I could do it all myself I would. This restaurant charges a lot for poor service & food that is just alright. Thus the 2 stars for the alright food & restaurant facility. Won't be returning here anytime soon, possibly ever!"
Doug J.,"Cottonwood Heights, Salt Lake City, UT",2,74,51,3.0,2/24/2017,A solid 3. the food is good but expensive. Not a place to take kids when you have to pay regular prices for them. I ordered the Baja tacos. The flavor was good but you get 4 mini and I mean mini tacos with only 1-2 chunks of chicken per taco. I thought they were appetizers but I was wrong. For $14 I expected at lest real sized tacos. Wife got a $14 bowl of chili. Really good but chili costs $14? For the 4 of us came to $75 includes tip and we all ordered water. I'm sure there are better things but tonight was not it. It will be a while before we go back. (Maybe after I get a raise) Our waitress was really good but when the kitchen brought the food out it was 2 plates at a time with about at 2 minutes in-between. Not terrible if you are 2 or even 4 but we were a table of 7.
Dilya S.,"Westpointe, Salt Lake City, UT",7,5,,1.0,10/19/2017,They mess up my cake and food was horrible I order farfale chicken pasta no souse in pasta
Dust C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,37,13,4.0,7/28/2017,"The good, the bad, the ugly.  The good: -Great food! I have only had the healthy options but they use fresh ingredients and it's well prepared.  -Cheesecake! I stick with traditional which is always good. We often share with each other. Many of the options are too rich for my taste. You cannot go wrong with the classic options.  -The staff has always been nice and upbeat.  -The atmosphere can be hectic. It's a big place. Yet, it's always clean and comfortable.  The bad: -This place is always busy. Seriously, I have been a few times and I've yet to wait in line. Typical in a good restaurant.  -The price is a bit much for what you get.  The ugly: Nothing to report here."
Nicole C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,16,76,4.0,11/7/2017,"If you're looking for a place to satisfy a number of different tastes, Cheesecake Factory is the place. They have a vast menu that hits anything you could possibly be in the mood for. The Chicken Waffle Benedict is fabulous for brunch. The syrup for the waffle tastes like buttery toffee, it's incredible. I enjoy the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls are fresh and full of flavor. I really enjoy the Fried Macaroni and Cheese, it's the perfect consistency of cheesy goodness with a light panko coating. You can definitely feast on appetizers here. As far as entrees go, you can't go wrong with the Miso Salmon or Chicken Picatta. My sweetheart loves the Cuban Sandwich and he gets it with Sweet Potato Fries. His favorite dessert is Linda's Fudge Cake. I've tried a number of the cheesecake selections and am doing my best to try them all though the Key Lime Cheesecake is one of my absolute favorites and the Pumpkin Cheesecake is my favorite during the holidays. Give Cheesecake Factory a try, you won't be disappointed."
CJ M.,"West Valley City, UT",1,89,105,1.0,9/12/2017,"I told myself I would never come here again and because of time im here smh. Go DOWNTOWN to city creek! I ordered curbside to-go because I hate the service here. And they messed up the to go! With no apology! I'd rather starve then come here again, I would've left but my husband was hungry after a long day of traveling internationally"
Paul C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,6,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Bad service. Bad service. Bad service.  The food was decent but quite expensive. Lots to choose from. Too much.  Jack of all trades, matter of none."
Ben G.,"Hampshire, IL",9,13,,1.0,9/2/2017,"Seriously, Cheesecake Factory, you've been in business how long and you still don't know how busy you get??! BUILD A BIGGER WAITING AREA! People are LITERALLY stepping on my toes. Your food is not worth that kind of hassle!"
Amy T.,"Provo, UT",188,87,164,3.0,11/19/2016,"Let me first say this, NEVER go to Cheesecake Factory on  a non-weeknight. The weekend rush will ruin your night. We waited 1 hr 45 min for a table for TWO. Just two people. They told us originally the wait would be 1 hr 10 min. Also heads up, they do not take reservations on weekends.  Once seated, our server took a lengthy time in approaching us. However, when she did we immediately put in our order and she was back with drinks and bread in only a few minutes. Appetizers and our entree came out quickly, too! Which was a welcomed sight after our long wait.  We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls. Pretty good, but they are absolutely MADE by the sweet dipping sauce they serve with the dish. Seriously, we almost ate it by the spoonful.  We ordered the Lemon Garlic Noodles. We added shrimp ($5 extra and they gave us probably 6 small, measly shrimp.) Next time just add chicken. It's cheaper. The noodles are spaghetti, but next time I'd change it for angel hair. The thick noodle seemed odd without a marinara sauce. The garlic sauce is light and buttery. The dish was reminiscent of buttered noodles my mom would make me as a kid. The added asparagus, tomatoes and mushrooms were great.  We finished it off with a slice of their Pumpkin Cheesecake. Seasonal, so get it while it's hot!  Decent meal. C+"
