Jean W.,"Riverton, UT",225,365,428,2.0,6/24/2013,"Another visit to The Factory. Breakfast this time...Father's Day, with a reservation. We were seated quickly, and promptly given the list of everything on their relatively small breakfast menu that they were out of that day.  The breakfast food looked pretty, but was well beyond dismal: my California Omelette was virtually tasteless (including the fresh avocado -- ??), the cubed breakfast potatoes, with their only flavor being ""burnt,"" landed somewhere between gluey-chewy and rock-hard. The coffee, including all two refills, was lukewarm. The scrambled eggs were rubbery. The fresh-squeezed orange juice and the hot chocolate, however, both received loud praises.  Our waiter was the only truly flawless part, with his Osmondesque smile, and his delightful personality. No missteps on his part at all - he worked his butt off for us. He even quickly fetched the Manager when things went South, so he could come out and apologize personally. He also comp'd one meal that took forever coming out. The two stars are for the service. For the first time (and likely last time) ever, I walked out of The Factory without being full."
Mary L.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,6,9,2.0,6/17/2015,"I'm from Las Vegas and I'm here for medical reasons with the family. We ate here because it's relatively close to the hospital and I love the Cheescake Factories in Las Vegas. That being said, I was a bit disappointed with this location. They were veryyyyy slow and it took us multiple times to ask for the same things, (refills and whatnot) I think I was most disappointed with my Steak Diane. I always get this plate and this time, it was very unappetizing. It was verrrrrry over cooked. (I asked for medium and got welllll well done.) and there was barely any sauce. Needless to say, I'll stick to Cheesecake Factories in Vegas."
Charles S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",928,1298,1079,3.0,7/26/2011,"The best thing about Cheesecake Factory is that it's always free! At least for me it is. You see, I really never eat here unless someone invites me and offers to pay. This most recent visit was no exception and it did nothing to change my opinion of the place. ""Hit or Miss"" is a perfect description of CF. Case(s) in point. In our large group we ordered some things that were great (crispy spicy beef, burrito grande, salmon) and some things that were bad (overcooked pork chops, pizza with not enough toppings and undercooked ""doughy"" texture). The service, as usual, was very good. And the salads, as usual, were fresh, crispy and humungous. Cheesecake Factory never ""wows"" me, but usually doesn't totally disappoint, either. It's A-OK, I guess... especially when I don't have to even look at the bill."
Andrew N.,"Austin, TX",38,165,1381,2.0,2/1/2014,"Went here while I was visiting Utah for a few days and I was pretty disappointed. As most people can tell from my reviews, I'm not a foodie and don't typically go to fancy schmancy restaurants. I like the Cheesecake factory, but this location left me a bit sour. There were two issues - the wait was atrocious and since it was a bit cold outside, everyone just stood inside elbow to elbow, with people walking in between everyone trying to get their name in or just leave after eating. The second issue I had was the proximity of our table to other tables. I went here with a buddy and we could hear almost word for word the conversations on both sides of us. I don't mind a somewhat noisy restaurant, but I shouldn't be able to hold hand with two total strangers on both sides of me without even trying to reach."
Valeen A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,19,1,3.0,3/15/2015,"The menu items taste exactly the same as every Cheesecake Factory restaurant. I admire their consistency in taste- they have great quality control. Nothing here will taste bad and you will have the exact same dining experience every time you eat here. Unfortunately, this means that it will be very loud and noisy, and service will be super slow. There's a reason why their menu is 20,000 pages long- to give you something to read while you wait, and wait.  And wait. Sitting in the bar, or going here super late at night will earn you no reprieve- you have slow service even after 9 pm.   To be fair, no one seems to notice the slow service much. Parties are raucous and boisterous and having a good time. Lots of parties of women celebrating impending nuptials, or birthdays. But if you are desperate, I suggest you order a bunch of appetizers. They come out a tad faster, and no matter which appetizer you order, the quality will be good and the taste will be fine.  I suggest this place for large parties with a lot of time to kill. The extensive menu will guarantee something for everyone, and you won't notice the wait if you have lots of news to shout about across the table. If you're still sober at the end of the night, I recommend examining the decor. It's lush and over the top and completely disproportionate to most other restaurants in Salt Lake City which have more spartan settings. But fun to look over to get design ideas for that mansion that you'll probably never build."
Ryan C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",299,185,69,4.0,11/12/2013,"I've never tried anything except for the crusted chicken parmesean.  I was lucky enough to order something I loved on my very first visit and I see no reason to risk it.  This last trip was even better than normal because in addition to the always amazing chicken parmesean and delicious dulce de leche cheesecake, we had a really awesome server!  It was just a quiet night out and she was the most memorable part of the dinner.  Kudos!"
Adam M.,"Draper, UT",6,19,11,5.0,2/9/2015,"Food is so good. Portions are big. Great service, especially Crystal. We have been lucky to get her twice now. She is very nice and fun. I will be requesting her from now on."
Nickie J.,"Salt Lake City, UT",28,24,43,1.0,6/13/2013,"First of all... our server was TERRIBLE.  I think one of the worst servers I have had.  I had to ask several times just to get a refill on my water. I mean COMEON MAAAN.  The food was ok but waaaaaaay over priced.  I got a quesadilla and it wasnt even worth taking a picture of.  $9.95 for cheese and tortilla.  I asked them to hold the green onions, in translation that meant also hold the green chilies I guess.  Then when our server brought our food back that he boxed up, he threw it on the table and walked away.  Not here you go and set it down it was a throw on the table and walk away.  It took everything I had no to make a scene.  If I were you.... go to Olive Garden (which is in the same parking lot) instead."
Sam M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",118,215,87,3.0,4/25/2011,"I know that there are a lot of food snobs who scoff at the idea of eating at a chain restaurant, but you can't help but give some props to Cheesecake Factory.  Nowhere else have I ever gone into a restaurant and gotten mentally tired from reading a menu.  Okay, that may not seem like a perk, but the novel-esque menu just shows why it's such a wonderful place to take a large group of people who happen to have very differing food preferences.   Personally, I get overstimulated when reading the menu so I typically a) determine how hungry I am, b) shove the novel, i mean menu, aside and c) choose one or two of the following:  - fried macaroni and cheese balls  - ahi carpaccio  - miso salmon  - the navajo  I know it seems kind of lame that I stick to the same things on the menu, but sometimes I really enjoy tried and true foods.  While I enjoy my meals here immensely, it's not enough to justify waiting between 1-2 hours to get seated.  Luckily, it's located close to the mall so I can get some shopping done in the mean time.   Now... I've mentioned this before, but I still have yet to try cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.  I know it seems wrong, but after the tremendously long wait, I have a tendency to down my food fairly quickly and find myself far too full to have cheesecake.  Or... in those rare cases when I'm having a huge sweet tooth craving, I get Linda's Fudge Cake.  I know, it seems wrong, but haven't you ever seen Matilda when Miss Trunchbull makes the fat kid devour a huge chocolate cake?  Well, this cake is what I imagine that cake tasted like, I just prefer eating it in smaller quantities.   Maybe one of these days I'll see what the big hype is over the cheesecake?"
Brandon K.,"South Jordan, UT",187,32,33,3.0,2/3/2015,"The Cheesecake Factory here is similar to any other location with delicious cheesecake and an overly complicated menu of entrees. However, the Spicy Cashew Chicken is quite delicious, and we cant resist ordering it every time we end up visiting. I would highly recommend it if you find yourself at the Cheesecake Factory."
Michelle S.,"Sandy, UT",84,100,110,3.0,1/12/2015,"The terrible management and inconsistency keeps me at bay. For being a corporate restaurant, you'd hope for better service, as the ones in Vegas offer far better food and hospitality. The menu isn't adhered to and lies are spewed from managment' mouth about the kitchen practices and how food should taste. Specifically, I'm told that eggplant SHOULD be solid green and really crunchy when thoroughly cooked, odd, since I eat a lot of eegplant and only have issues with it at this location.."
Beverly N.,"West Valley City, UT",0,4,,1.0,4/5/2016,"My experience was not good the waiter never ask us what we wanted to drink just gave us water. When our order came my daughter ordered the burger on wheat and guess what they sent the burger out on some hard crusty bread, we told the waiter he said ""they were out of whole wheat so they put it on that"" then he took the the burger back and within 5 mins brought it back. They put the burger on the whole wheat bread and sent it back out. We spent more than $100.00 for dinner and let's just say we won't be going back to that restaurant.No apology was made about us getting the wrong order."
Lindsey K.,"Sandy, UT",46,21,11,4.0,1/15/2015,Usually pretty good. Love the miso salmon although that one  can some times not be the freshest. But huge meals. And always have left overs. The sweet tamale cakes are good!!
Jennifer K.,"Cottonwood Heights, Salt Lake City, UT",0,60,3,1.0,11/6/2015,"I have visited this cheesecake factory location at least 8 times this year, after the first visit it was never my choice again. I dont know why this location is so popular/crowded. just the fact that its connected to a busy mall? It's a huge chain? Other locations are fine but I dont see how such a dirty place with terrible service, neglectful and avoidant staff can have so much business!   EVERY time we've gone they seat us at a table with bits of food on the chairs and table (pet peeve). Time before last I stepped in a pile of rice on the floor. The time before that a glass was dropped and broken by a server, she asked a busy busser to take care of it but he didnt even hear her cause he was soooo busy! When she came back to the area and saw it still hadn't been cleaned up she just threw a napkin on top of the broken glass and liquid, walked away and started giggling with a coworker in the back corner. These shards of glass were on the ground for almost our entire meal. I was actually concerned about a toddler who was running back and forth by all the glass, but no one else seemed to notice or care.  They have no problem serving with dirty glassware and silverware. I am always so surprised by how terrible the service and quality of food is, especially since the place is often packed and ridiculously overpriced for the quality of food. They seem to have an abundance of staff but they rarely want to go to their tables. I have watched with my own eyes as servers hurriedly walk back and forth up and down and looked extremely busy, but they weren't doing anything! They were seemingly powerwalking to random corners of the restaurant, shuffling around some glasses or just standing at card readers then they'd rush to another side for some more shuffling and the illusion of being too busy to wait on their table.  Finally, the last time my guy made me go he ordered one of his favorite entrees (chicken and biscuits...that dish is WHY he wants to eat here) When his entree arrived and he tried to put his fork into the biscuits they were so hard that one biscuit repelled the fork, flew off the plate and sounded like a rock when it landed! He waited for our server to come back, he just wanted to replace the biscuit but after about ten minutes he resigned to not having any biscuits. She NEVER came back to check our food, refill our glasses or do her job at all until she decided we needed our check. We showed her the biscuit and she blew it off like, how was I supposed to know? It was completely inedible, like fossilized dinodroppings. She asked if he wanted another, he said he didnt want to risk it and he was done with his chicken, he said he would have taken one earlier but she never came back. I requested for her to bring some biscuits anyway. A few minutes later someone else with crazy person  makeup came with biscuits and said she heard about the rock biscuit and hoped it didn't happen again. She didn't offer any compensation. In everyone's opinion, if you have to pay nearly twenty dollars for everything on the menu then the food should be at least edible, period. Quality control is not an unattainable mystery. I really hate this cheesecake factory location."
Shannon E.,"O'Fallon, IL",27,88,82,3.0,9/3/2014,"Love the cheesecake but if you order at the counter they take forever to just hand it over. You would think they are making it from scratch by how long you wait for them to hand it over. All they have to do is grab a slice, box it and hand it over."
Monica V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",661,516,1252,2.0,2/16/2012,"I was craving pasta the other day and it was kind of late, so we went over to The Cheesecake Factory, because it's been a few years since I've eaten here and they were open. After about a 15 minute wait, and almost falling during the walk to the table lol (very slippery floors and I was wearing heels) we were seated. I forgot this place had such a huge menu with different types of cuisine, but I didn't want to go through it all so my boyfriend and I just ordered a flatbread app and the farfalle with chicken and roasted garlic to share. The flatbread was okay. The pasta would have been delicious if it weren't for the overpowering saltiness. We also ordered the classic cheesecake with cherries which was the highlight of the meal, but not awesome enough to want to come back here for another couple of years."
Margaret L.,"West Jordan, UT",36,80,38,4.0,8/17/2013,"As with all cheesecake factories, the menu is huge, so it's a great place to go with a group. The service is good and staff is friendly. However the atmosphere is loud and it is pricey. Overall, good option for picky eaters."
Thang T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,6,,5.0,5/17/2015,Every time I come here I'm never disappointed. Great service great food and I would recommend the steak Diane and the chicken Marcella.
Jami C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,10,,2.0,9/3/2014,So there was one piece of chicken in my four cheese chicken pasta the price to add one piece of chicken was outrageous! The server you could hardly understand him. But he tried. For the price we paid for the food I would say not returning . If it's based on our server Daniel maybe we would return
Robert B.,"Ogden, UT",200,150,227,3.0,6/15/2013,"The environment is fun and eye catching but the food is starting to go downhill in my opinion.  We use to really look forward to coming here but now it seems like we go if we have no other option.  I feel like the menu items are geared around taste and high caloric intake and sometimes they win. No longer a favorite.  I especially do not like being treated like a less than for not consuming alcohol.  I am fully aware that your tip will not be near as high, but please have some respect for water."
