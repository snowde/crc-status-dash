Julie B.,"Midvale, UT",0,3,,4.0,3/6/2017,"Went to the Murray Cheesecake Factory with my family Sunday Afternoon.  There were 5 of us.  Unfortunately the waitress misunderstood my order and brought the wrong dish.  They were very nice and gave me a salad while I waited for my meal.  The manager came and apologized and compt the meal.  We asked for a takeaway for the part I didn't finish.  She said she would box it for me.  She brought it back in a nice container with a bag to take home.  When I went to have it for dinner tonight, I found that it was not my dinner!  They gave me the wrong meal!  The parmasian herb crusted chicken is excellent if you can get it.  I will never let them box my leftovers again.  Now I need to figure out what to have for dinner. Update.  Called the restaurant and told them what happened.  They wanted to make it right and are mailing us a gift card.  I guess I will get to try it again."
Sindee N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",6,49,171,1.0,4/11/2016,"Third time being here and will be the last. Ribeye steak wasn't as good as the last two visits; lacking the marinated flavor. Chicken lettuce wrap is nothing compare to old Cafe Trang and on top of that, the lettuces still had dirt on them. Yuck!"
Scott H.,"Cedar City, UT",1,7,,1.0,10/16/2016,"By far the worst CheeseCake Factory around. Took 35 minutes to get drinks once ordered. Burger was over cooked, they asked and I told them med rare. Burger was well done. What's the purpose of asking if no one is listening? Fries are worse than Arctic Circle, strawberries were rotten, avocados were black, and to top it all off we had to fight fruit flies the whole time. Won't be going back anytime soon."
Juan S.,"Miami, FL",89,1406,31,5.0,6/19/2016,"Year after year, you can't go wrong with the Cheesecake factory. Who has a bigger menu in town?  Noone.   The food is great and always fun to eat here."
John C.,"Sandy, UT",405,613,3994,3.0,6/8/2014,"Since we woke up late today we knew we would be too late to get Dim sum since the best time to go is right at 10:30am to avoid the long wait/line. We ordered the eggs benedict with fresh spinach and bacon and grilled tomatoes. Then had the Brioche breakfast sandwich, and then the Brûléed french toast.  The eggs benedict weren't that great. the muffin was very soggy, the potatoes were deep fried and over cooked.  The Brioche breakfast sandwich wasn't bad, the bread was delicious and the eggs were cooked just right.  The best part was the Brûléed french toast. They were light and fluffy and had a nice syrup with it. They were dusted with powdered sugar."
Rich W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,2,,1.0,2/6/2017,"This was our first time there and was told 1 hour and 45 minutes for a table. I was able to get 2 seats at the bar after 20 minutes. The bartender hands you a book of a menu and the restaurant is so dark inside that I had to use my phone flashlight to read the menu. I  looked around while there and noticed 4 other people reading the menu with their phones also. The price of a  pint glass of Bud Light was $5.75 each. I  ordered the gumbo pasta and it was not good, wrong kind of noodles if you ask me.  We did buy a piece of cheese cake which was the only thing good about the visit. Over rated restaurant and I won't be back anytime soon"
Heather H.,"Payson, UT",0,17,,2.0,1/15/2017,Ordered the cheese steak sandwich to go. It was the most horrible cheese steak sandwich I've ever had and the fries were ice cold. $14 for the sandwich I will never go here again. I know they're known for their amazing desserts and they are good but the prices are so outrageous why would you buy them? Costco has an amazing chocolate cake that's just as good as theirs and their caramel cheesecake is only fifteen dollars for the whole thing
You X.,"Salt Lake City, UT",24,33,27,4.0,5/2/2016,"I came here with my friends for my early birthday dinner. The server was funny and friendly. The good was good, and the server had a candle on my cheesecake which was really nice. The only thing I didn't enjoy was when we walked in nobody came over ask us anything, and we had to find server to say we are here to eat which was kinda awkward.... But after that we had good experience. I would choose the downtown location over this one."
Peggy C.,"Layton, UT",30,95,49,5.0,6/19/2015,"Absolutely fantastic! The Miso Salmon was unique, full of sweet flavor that hit my palette in all the right places!!! Dessert, Lemon Meringue Cheesecake was light, lemony and the best New York cheesecake!  Just great!  And of course their Lemon Drop Martini was the highlight of my dinner!"
Ben H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,12,,1.0,2/22/2016,"I doubt you are reading this to determine the quality of the food. For service, one star is being nice.  First, the host was jerk, sorry for coming. The waitress was slow. It appeared they gave her three new tables at once. So slow to get drinks to us, which then pushed out order out.  The worst part of the night came from being seated on the West side, in perfect position for every car's headlights to shine right in our eyes. We asked to have the blinds lowered, the manager said no as they turn off the lights at night. Really, lame excuse. There is no light switch or dimmer?  He somewhat offered to move us, but you could tell that was not going to happen. Again, sorry for coming.  The food was the same old Cheesecake. Three stars at best."
Angie L.,"Long Beach, CA",31,424,2762,4.0,7/19/2015,"i've been here a few times, but this was my first time coming here since they updated their menu to mark gluten free items.  i came with my cousin and it was a 20 minute wait.  we were told they were not seating anyone on the patio, so instead were seated in a nice booth inside right next to a window.  which was weird, because an hour later we saw like four tables outside on the patio eating.  besides that service was excellent. i chose to get the GF pasta carbonara and it was seriously so good.  very creamy, rich, and savory.  it was a large portion and i ended up taking half to go.  my cousin got the thai lettuce wraps which she loved.  we decided to pass on dessert, but they have quite a selection if you choose to enjoy dessert."
Shannon R.,"Orem, UT",13,4,,3.0,1/22/2017,"I feel like it was just okay for the price, I would rather eaten at Carrabbas or something. food was kinda bland and the noodles didn't really have any sauce, the shrimp I had still had sand in it, the Manger said it's not possible because they devein it but it was obvious that there was sand, the waitress was really nice, attentive and understanding, the cheese cake is really good, probably will only come back for the cheesecake, the cheesecake and waiters are the reason I give this place 3 stars, in my honest opinion way over hyped, overpriced and not worth it."
Maxwell J.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,4,,3.0,1/1/2017,"Typically a great stop. My wife and I usually get take out and have had fairly good luck with getting the correct items that we ordered. However, there have been times where we didn't get what we asked for. Also, they are sometimes out of bread.. what restaurant runs out of bread? Overall, super yummy, somewhat over priced, and service is meh."
Bec G.,"Draper, UT",52,20,51,5.0,7/20/2016,My favourite restaurant in Utah! The wait times can be quite long but are totally worth it! The menu is huge and caters to ALL tastes. I have never ordered anything that I haven't really enjoyed. The chicken costoletta and the pasta DaVinci are my favourite dishes with the salted caramel cheesecake being my favourite slice! Avocado egg rolls or factory chicken nachos are the best appetisers. Serving sizes are HUGE - you could totally share a meal of you aren't big eaters.
Heather B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,11,,2.0,11/11/2016,"I recently went here to celebrate my birthday with a co-worker.  To my surprise, there wasn't a ridiculously long wait.  We even got a booth!  Yes!  We didn't have to sit at one of those tiny tables that is so close to the next you feel like you're having lunch with the people next to you. However!  Our excitement quickly dwindled when we received the slowest service possible.  After we received our drinks and placed our order it felt like oserver disappeared.  We saw other servers going back and fourth re-filling drinks, but not ours.  On several occasions I wanted to switch servers. In addition, my co worker and I were joined by several flies.  I counted nine at one point.  I'm not sure if these flies came in when the doors were open, but they were desperately trying to get out using the window at our booth.  After many attempts to escape, they refueled their bodies with microscopic portions of our meals.  Or, just left us gifts of exhaustion. Overall, it was an unforgettable celebration."
Jeffrey B.,"Palisade, CO",24,13,9,1.0,6/18/2016,"Just walked out of the restaurant without eating.  I wanted to take my mother and father out for an early father's day lunch.  I asked if we could get a booth as my mother is hard of hearing.  The hostess tried to seat us in the general area, I asked if we could be seated at a booth and was told that the booth was reserved for parties of 4 or more... even though I counted 5 open booths.  CONGRATULATION CHEESECAKE FACTORY of Midvale, UT, I won't be back. Thank God I have alternatives. California Pizza Kitchen, our lunch and atmosphere were amazing and it's right next door."
Ti D.,"Sandy, UT",273,76,99,5.0,5/20/2016,We have business lunches here once a month on Fridays. How can you go wrong with such a vast menu everyone in the group can order different items that are high quality and gourmet! It's always busy and bustling here. I'd suggest you hit the bar area where you'll typically find seating when tables are a considerable wait. You can order anything here and you'll enjoy it. I trust this brand so much that when I do promotions for the business I'm in I'll buy thousands in Cheesecake gift cards! Also I've never ordered a bad dish.. Gotta get back to work.. So I'll keep it short!
Zuhadi Z.,"Draper, UT",268,192,427,4.0,6/8/2015,"I was in the mood for pasta and my friend conveniently recommended Chicken Jambalaya Pasta. I heard this is the dish she always order every time she is in Cheesecake Factory. So I thought, well, worth a try, and boy was she right. It was so good I wanted to give her a hug. Heck, I even wanted to give The Chef a hug.   The chicken was tender and juicy. The cajun spices were spicy enough to add zing to my taste buds without overdoing it. Ok spicy is not actually a taste but a form of pain, which then confirms when people say there is always pleasure in a little bit of pain. The pasta was done in perfection. The shrimp was tasty and together with blends of vegetables (onions, tomatoes and green peppers with parsley sprinkles), they complete this whole heavenly dish.  I would give a 5-stars review if I had not made to wait over an hour to get our table on that Saturday evening. I know that is the busiest time of the week, and I don't mind the wait but we had to wait almost 20 minutes to get the bread served (and another 20 minutes to get our orders).  At least, they should serve the bread right away after we were seated since everybody was surely starving after all that long wait. Sounds doable enough right?  I will be back, probably with a little snack to munch whilst all that waiting. 4-stars."
Tammy N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",43,94,110,3.0,3/24/2015,"This place is always busy no matter what day you go. Always expect some kind of wait, but it gets ridiculous on the weekends so plan ahead. I have been to this location many times and I finally found a dish that actually tastes good! The steak medallions are great! It has taken many trials and errors to get to this conclusion. Everything else is ok, nothing special in my opinion. Although their food may only be alright, their cocktails are pretty good. I would suggest their flavored mojitos to be the winner of the night. You can't come to Cheesecake Factory without ordering cheesecake. We had a voucher which gave us a free slice and I have to say, it was more than enough. Yes their cheesecake is delicious but personally I don't mind sharing with at least 3 other people because it is just too rich. Now that I've found something that I actually like, I don't think I'll mind coming back. This place is great for birthdays because you can always expect at least 3 songs throughout the night."
Lori K.,"Lehi, UT",56,1,,1.0,6/2/2017,Worst service ever!  Food was terrible. We had a party of 5 and we all ordered something different and we were all disappointed. They weren't overly busy so that is not an excuse!!!
