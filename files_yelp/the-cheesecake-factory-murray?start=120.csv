Bryce G.,"Murray, UT",87,79,26,5.0,5/14/2016,"Cheese cake factory can be really hit and miss but tonight was a 5 star experience. Kurt was an awesome server. Our appetizer took twice as long to arrive so they gave it to us for free. We jade the sweet corn tamales. Please don't come here without getting them, they are that awesome. We had the chicken madierra and the Louisiana chicken pasta, both were incredibly delicious. And then to top the whole night off with a big fat cherry, the Adams cheese cake! Holy moly that cheese cake tickles my belly from the inside. Tonight was worth the wait to get in."
Marge L.,"Prescott, AZ",0,34,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Yes, it was Mother's Day.  The restaurant was busy but the wait was only 10 minutes.  My husband ordered pancakes and poached eggs.  After a 30 minute wait for food, everything on his plate was cold.  The waitress apologized and reappeared about 15 minutes later.  The eggs were still ice cold and the middle of the pancakes were now uncooked batter.  If a restaurant is unable to adequately staff for a holiday, don't bother to open.  We won't be back."
Jesse Y.,"Midvale, UT",4,67,16,3.0,1/30/2016,"The cheesecake factory is fun place to visit once and a while.   It's always takes 1/2 to an hour to get a table and the noise in it makes it hard to talk to anyone.   The menu is really big and makes it hard to decide what to pick, especially when you are hungry.   The food is good but read the descriptions.  They may do things a little different than what you are expecting. If you  have the time and the money take a trip to the cheesecake factory."
Greg M.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",186,253,5,4.0,4/23/2016,"I don't like this place in Utah!!! The wait on a Thursday night was 50 minutes!!!  It's like Mormon Nirvana.  They love this place!!!   I don't get it.  Sean our server was excellent!!  I ordered a mushroom burger and not trusting their medium to be medium I said medium well and got medium rare.  Terrible burger!!! The meatball appetizer and breads were excellent.  I sampled my sons Mac and cheese and it was good,!while my daughters pizza was average!!! Sean was so good I bumped them up to four stars.  This restaurant isn't worth the wait when I can walk into cpk next door down and sit immediately for the same quality food!!!"
Chuck S.,"Murray, UT",145,55,6,5.0,11/10/2016,"Good experience, very good service and the food as always is on point. Rich, comfort food. Don't come here complaining about its not healthy, that's not what they are about. Only thing for me personally, I prefer a booth here and not a table. The tables are too close, the people next to us were staring at us at times while we were in conversation. Get a booth."
Carla H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",149,21,15,3.0,8/16/2015,"I ordered the old fashion burger, I've had a better burger and fries at 5 Guys. Nothing special about this one except you're paying $13.00 for it.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken stuffed tortillas. He really enjoyed the sides, one being grilled corn cakes. The chicken was very flavorful and moist.  Our server was great, he even steered me away from ordering the cucumber lemonade. The restaurant is spacious and kept clean.  I know we will be back eventually for some of our favorites on the menu (avocado egg rolls, fried mac and cheese.)"
Kay P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",521,279,823,5.0,1/20/2014,"Habachi steak with onions, mash potatoes and a nice sauce to pair it together .. Doesn't tickle your fancy? Try the pasta devinchi  with sautéed onions and mushrooms in a Marsala wine sauce, it's just as Divine.  Now for the appetizers.. Fire cracker salmon with Asian slaw and sweet spicy sauce wrapped in a fried wonton wrapping is my favorite as well as their tuna tar tar . The avocado is fresh and the fish melts in your mouth .  Now martinis ! Can't go wrong with their Asian pear martini . Light, crisp and pairs well with fish dishes."
Lance M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",126,320,306,3.0,7/10/2016,"We waited for an hour to get seated and when we finally did, it took another 2 hours to get ordered, get our food, get our dessert, and pay the check. I don't know why it took so long. Our waitress was moving like molasses. It felt like ages waiting for her to bring back our cheesecake. It was weird though cause some of the people she was also waiting on got seated after us, and somehow got out before us. It just seemed like we were her last priority. The food was good though. I got the grilled steak tacos. They were fresh tasting and the chipotle sauce with the guacamole on top was a nice touch. I always enjoy the bread they bring out too. A nice place to eat, when I'm in the mood to have a long dragged out evening."
Stephen L.,"Boise, ID",233,193,1324,4.0,3/22/2014,"I like this restaurant from overall food, service and, of course, desserts (its cheesecake). The only tip is to come on Sunday, whereby there are not as many people, so you do not need to queue very long. So we came here the last time for Sunday lunch. The price is cheaper because the portion is smaller. We need to understand that their ""lunch"" portion is still pretty large & comparable to other restaurant. Their dinner portion is gigantic. They provide bread for appetizer. There are two types of bread (chocolate one and normal one). I prefer the chocolate color one (it does not taste like chocolate, but it is still delicious) with butter. The waiter is very kind and providing another one, after we ate them out in 5 min ... (yes, it is that good). I got fish & chips that I shared with my six-year-old boy, both of us like it. It is crispy with 3 pieces of fish and fries. It filled both of us. My wife has fettucinni (pasta) with roasted potato and chicken. We like it and  I stole a couple of bites from my wife's plate. Yummy... We closed our lunch with cheesecake. We asked the waiter of her favorite cheesecake and she told us the caramel one, so we ordered it... it is truly delicious, you'd love it !"
Walter C.,"Layton, UT",11,194,21,4.0,6/19/2015,"Service and food are excellent, as always.  It's still crowded when you get here on a weekend.  The only fault I find is the seating arrangement is so tight.  Not an overly huge fan of the people on the next table being able to lean over and put their elbows on my table.  I get communal dining, but not a fan of it. The food is still good.  The Salmon Roll appetizer is worth it.  The Bistro Shrimp Pasta is still good though I can notice the change in it to reduce the calorie count. The cheesecakes of course make this visit worth while."
Riki C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",5,63,444,4.0,2/18/2016,Not a big fan of chain restaurants but I always enjoy eating at The Cheesecake Factory! The Paris Bistro is my favorite dish  The angel hair pasta with the shrimp is delicious! Sit at the bar to avoid the long wait at the Fashion Place location
Navnav M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",23,25,10,1.0,11/2/2015,"They never have what we want  Never have fresh ahi tuna  Never have apple crisp Never have fresh ice tea  It's becoming a joke It's tarnishing the name "" cheese cake factory "" Bread always cold ! Butter expired  Next time if anyone goes ck UR butter"
Stephanie F.,"Midvale, UT",66,1,,3.0,4/27/2016,"Went for my sons birthday. We were greeted in a somewhat timely matter, drinks took over ten minutes to receive. The drinks from the bar were phenomenal but they didn't have ingredients to two drinks I wanted to try.  Appetizers were tastey, food looked and tasted delicious. But my son didn't care for his kids meal and we sent it back. Unfortunately, the waiter did not get the meal taken off the check. My husband paid, otherwise I would have said something.  Although the food was delicious, we didn't get a check back until we were almost finished.  I will come back with my husband to enjoy a quiet romantic meal next time"
Bryanna A.,"West Jordan, UT",52,13,5,1.0,2/18/2017,"The Cajun jambalaya was horrible and cost $18. The carrot cake cheesecake was not great and the red velvet cheesecake taste like cream cheese and bread, these was very little flavor. We did order the fried mac and cheese bite and those are amazing! But basically the rest of our meal sucked!! I ordered the Louisiana chicken pasta and ended up puking everywhere when we got home... stir clear of that. For $95 this meal was the worst!! We ended up going to sonic later because we were hungry."
Coco S.,"Herriman, UT",3,128,308,4.0,11/1/2015,"We came on a Saturday around 4pm and it was pretty busy during our meal, but our server was very friendly and our food was great. Love the fried mac & cheese! So crispy on the outside and really gooey inside. And the sauce it's served with is delicious! My only issue is the cost. I know it's a little silly to complain because their prices are known to be high, but $10 for an appetizer is a little steep. You can't really consider the free bread ""free"" when meatloaf costs $16."
LaNay V.,"Magna, UT",1,4,3,4.0,10/7/2016,"Today me and my boys went to the cheesecake factory at the fashion place mall. We came during lunch time and didn't have to wait for a table at all. We were sat upon walking in right to a booth. Our waitress ( Nicole) was very accommodating, loved her service! I'm allergic to tree nuts and I had ordered the Thai lettuce wraps. I have never tried it before but she recommended this dish as something light and refreshing. She talk to the cook about my allergies to tree nuts and had different sauces served on the side that I could try. It was really good and I recommend it! One of my sons had the chicken Marsala and the other had the three cheese chicken pasta. Our males were served in a timely manner within 15 minutes. Now that to me as service. We all loved their dishes we had ordered. My sons each ordered a dessert, I was to full! one ordered the strawberry shortcake and the other the chocolate tower mousse cake Yum.... the boys were happy!!"
Yan P.,"Kihei, HI",0,3,1,5.0,3/17/2017,Amazing service... amazing options... Jordan the manager rocks!  Our waitress was super nice and fast...
Dan S.,"Kaysville, UT",0,8,,5.0,3/9/2017,Always good and a crowd pleaser. Waits are long on the weekends but not too bad during the week.
Elle B.,"Washington, DC",0,3,1,3.0,9/4/2016,Not the best Cheesecake Factory experience we've had. Food was OK. Service was good. The state of the women's restroom was abhorrent and it smelled.
Adam A.,"American Fork, UT",0,9,3,3.0,9/21/2016,"We came to celebrate a birthday and found it to be ok.  It took a very long time to be seated, served, and to get our bill.  The food was ok.  We have been here when it was better, but tonight struggled.  Several in our party actually sent their food back.  Overall I would say it was ok, but we won't be rushing back soon."
