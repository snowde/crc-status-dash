John W.,"South Jordan, UT",1,5,,4.0,10/3/2016,Always good food and usually always good service. My only complaint (if you can call it a complaint) is I only wish they had a few newer items on the menu. But overall always a good option for a nice dinner with the family.
Shauna S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",51,1108,595,4.0,2/8/2014,"Oh, my. I have a new favorite meal. The beef kabobs with goat cheese and tahini sauce are SO good!! I also liked the beets with walnuts appetizer.  Ordered chocolate mousse cheesecake to go."
Sarah M.,"Midvale, UT",297,54,17,4.0,5/9/2016,"I love coming to this cheesecake factory on random nights just to pick up a slice of cake, or an order to take home.  They are very good with their ""curbside pick up"" and I am usually very happy when i get home and open up my food!   Some of their appetizers and food are on the greasy side, but then again I when I order from here I am ordering with that expectation of getting a rich meal.  I creature of habit, and always end up getting the same things that I love (Chicken piccata and the Hershey's chocolate bar cheesecake).  No need to change it up when i know what i like :P"
Aubrey A.,"Millcreek, Salt Lake City, UT",61,6,,2.0,9/2/2016,"Service, service, service and I am not saying the kid didn't try. I too work in a kitchen and it seemed the server was overwhelmed by the amount of tables given to him on a Friday night, he struggled to open wine for the table I was at and luckily a neighboring server jumped in to show him how to do it, I could tell the guy was trying though, he was friendly and enthusiastic. The chicken and biscuits didn't come like I had ordered it prior to this dining experience (at this same location, same menu item last summer) the carrots were severely undercooked and still crunched when you bit into them, the crab and artichoke dip was Luke warm and the bread was severely (cut the roof of your mouth) stale and dry. I knew the kitchen was swamped that night so didn't send anything back or complain. Just sourly paid my $40 bill for an app/main and left, a bit dissatisfied"
Rigs R.,"Clovis, CA",348,102,1065,5.0,7/1/2014,I love the Cheesecake Factory.  The food rocks. I love the Jambalaya Pasta with Jumbo Shrimp and Chicken.  This time I added the Andoulie Sausage.  I wouldn't do this again as it was a bit greasy from the Sausage. My bad though I love the Cheesecake here and this time I ordered the Key Lime. On my next visit I will try the  Steak Diane.
Shane R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",74,110,84,5.0,1/8/2016,"Not only do they have any kind of cheesecake that you can think of, their food is amazingly delicious. They have something for everyone. There menu is probably an inch thick with everything from pastas, burgers, pizzas, steaks, seafoods literally anything you want. I love the jambalaya and the carbonara is great too. If you are looking for a good appetizer the Mac and cheese balls are awesome. The lemon raspberry cheesecake is a perfect finish to the awesome food. To full to eat desert take it home. Don't leave without a slice of cheesecake."
Sarah B.,"West Jordan, UT",0,4,,2.0,1/16/2017,"Extremely long wait every single time I'm here. It's really disappointing that Cheescake Factory could care less about this problem. If you want to wait at least an hour before being seated, this is the place for you!"
Kathryn M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",19,37,67,5.0,12/21/2015,This place rocks. Everything I try is awesome. I've never been disappointed. It's all so good. Can't wait to go back.
John P.,"Tomball, TX",0,13,4,5.0,9/16/2014,"My wife and I came in within in the lunch special hours (before 5:00), and we had some awesome entrées.  My wife had crusted Romano chicken. I had some of it and it was quite good. Pretty basic, pounded chicken with pasta and I think Romano sause. It was good.  But what I got totally blew it out of the water!  If you like salmon, then prepare yourself for the beat salmon you'll ever have. Its called salmon genovese. Amazing, that is what it should be called. The salmon was grilled with roasted tomatoes and artichokes, anyway it was plated beautifully and the service was great. Now my wife and I arrived before 5:00, so obviously our wait time was long enough for them to grab menus, and our service was above average, and we didn't wait too long for food, which tasted amazing. Low wait time + Service + Food quality ++ Why? Probably because my unborn child inside my wife was screaming for food at 4:00 in the afternoon. If we had gotten there at 5:30 or later, I would expect a longer wait time, less service quality, and possibly lower food quality.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
Amanda G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",23,25,2,1.0,3/28/2015,"This place is consistently, straight up bad. We avoid coming here because the food is lackluster, below even average for a restaurant chain, and the service here is usually awful. Sometimes we may join friends who like the enormous portions (and terrible costs associated with mass amounts of lousy food) but we don't go here on our own for the most part. The only thing even vaguely good about this place is it's titular dessert and then, only if someone else is paying for it. That's right, only if the cheesecake is literally bought by someone else. Today, though, takes that cheesecake and craps all over it. After all, how bad of a screw up do you have to be if you cannot manage to pull a single cheesecake for pick up so it can be ready to serve? You had seven hours and literally only one job where this order was concerned, but lo and behold when we arrived at 7pm, that cake had never ever been pulled and our order ticket had been lost in the shuffle. They found our ticket, but that ready-to-serve cheesecake? Did not exist. They had screwed up taking a cheesecake out of the fridge. That was it. The whole of the job. They couldn't even do that right! Now I have a $25 dollar gift card that will never be spent, because this is the last straw. This place is a blight on the mall clogging parking and apparently services only  people who enjoy mediocre everything. We are never giving it business, ever again."
B T.,"Walnut Creek, CA",7,106,12,1.0,2/13/2016,"My wife and I came at me here yesterday. We waited the one hour wait time to be seated for our valentines dinner date. Our food was satisfying. The bacon bacon cheese burger was awesome.  The reason for the one star is because we paid with a gift card and paid our tip with the same gift card, there was suppose to be a remaining balance enough to put towards a piece of cheesecake. I went to order the cheesecake at the front where it's served. When I gave the cashier the card it was denied. I checked the balance and it was at $0.00. I asked for the manager. The manager checked the balance and told it must have been some miscommunication or computer error. He wasn't able to put the credit back to the card but did get me my piece of cheesecake. For the service received I will not be returning to this location."
Rachelle W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,14,11,4.0,11/23/2016,"Love their Dirty Martinis as they come with blue cheese stuffed olives. Got their Chicken Picatta as it is one of my favorite Italian dishes. It would've been enough to split, honestly. The only downfall was service. Would've loved another drink, but the waiter didn't even come back till the end to box up the left overs..."
Emily J.,"SeaTac, WA",95,168,233,2.0,4/20/2015,Shorter menu. I feel like I am reading the bible. Too many choices. Do one thing right. I like the avocado spring rolls and the shrimp scampi. The chicken Madeira is good but honestly the portions ate huge and I can never finish even half my meal. I am always too full to order cheesecake. Isn't that why people go there?
Jordan T.,"Sandy, UT",65,3,,3.0,12/8/2015,"I went there for my mom's birthday last year, really good customer service but wasn't all that impressed with the food.  Kind of over priced for little portions and a strange sweet flavor on EVERYTHING."
Nicole F.,"Salt Lake City, UT",116,198,37,3.0,4/1/2015,"A little over-priced, the menu is extensive, and the food is mediocre. The cheesecake is obviously delicious, and the food portions and drink portions are very large."
Wynter M.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",3,15,1,1.0,4/3/2016,"The food was mediocore...not too hot, not too warm. They dropped off my daughters kids meal without fries so they could bring out ""fresh"" ones then the waitress didn't even check back with us for drink refills OR bring the fries to her. So at the end of the meal, she asks us if we want dessert, we tell her about the fries and she says well do you want them to go? No, I want it off my check. Meaning, the kids meal...she got the manager to take $1.75 off our bill. Poor service, poor food, I won't be going back. Such a disgrace to the chain. BLAH!!!!"
Jessica T.,"Vineyard, UT",0,2,,2.0,6/15/2017,"Really, really???!!! For the price you pay it is not worth it!! I ordered a simple to go order and somehow you forget the pasta in my shrimp scampi! Nothing but three pieces of shrimp! I live really far. I can't just drive back and tell you that you somehow forgot my noodles! I mean really. This place has gone down hill. You use to be my favorite restaurant. I am so disappointed. When you do dine in they hardly give you any bread anymore, the food is cold after waiting for 30 min, it is so loud and strangely vaulted that I can not hear my company speak but can clearly make out what a couple across the room are talking about, and not to mention the music you play in the background is terrible. Why not play some classical music?? Your cheesecake is still amazing! But tell me am I suppose to drive 45 min away to get my pasta that you forgot? You obviously don't know what customer service is, too expensive for what you get, and strip mall quality environment. You are obviously ripping people off. So why not give back that money and get your act together. Try to bring back a touch of class. You have lost my service and respect as a business.. makes me sad cause you were my go to place."
Chloe H.,"Lebanon, OH",182,16,2,3.0,2/15/2016,"Being President's Day, we decided to get there early, and we were glad we did! For a party of two our wait was still an hour, but we expected this to be the case. Luckily the mall attached has some great stores. Our waiter was great, extremely friendly and accommodating. After perusing the 50 page spiral-bound menu, we finally made our decisions. About half an hour after we ordered, the complementary bread came. Long wait, but at least the bread was warm. Shortly after we received our appetizer - the factory nachos. Holy massive plate of food batman! Unfortunately, the chips were grease-laden....literally dripping in oil, and the cheese was hard and coagulated, and also incredibly greasy. On the bright side, the guacamole tasted fresh and the pico de gallo was pleasant. Four chips in and we were already full. When our entrees finally came, the California Guacamole Superfood Salad had to be sent back because the order was incorrect, but the waiter was accommodating and friendly about it. Once the right salad came, overall I didn't have any complaints. It wasn't anything that would wow you, but at least it was fresh. My husband ordered the Factory Burrito, I believe it was called. It was literally 14 inches long and 5 inches wide, so he of course was initially thrilled at how much food there was. However, the burrito ended up being a soggy mess of a tortilla smothered in tepid red sauce and wrapped around a massive, mushy mound of flavored rice. Unfortunate. I will say though, both of us agreed that the endless lemonade was fantastic. It's too bad they changed their policy and don't let you change flavors once you order.  When we asked for our check, the waiter looked sad and asked if everything was alright, looking and the vast array of food still left on our plates. Of course we told him it was okay, we were just full. Since we were paying with gift cards, we weren't about to complain about leaving with full stomachs and wallets. We also got some Oreo cheesecake to go.  Overall, it was your typical chain restaurant experience. An extensive menu and huge portions typically means low-caliber food, so we weren't surprised."
Shareen K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",265,244,80,4.0,7/15/2015,"Even though this place is a chain, I still like their Cajun Chicken littles,which are not so little. Mmmmhmm yum!! Talk about good fried chicken with great flavor, you have to try this dish out! They also put a lot of food which I end up taking some left overs of the not so littles with me.  I usually order it with their fries and that dish turns out always always good!  I am not a big fan of their cheesecakes, it is often to heavy for me, and too rich. Customer service is often good, just like any other restaurant sometimes there is a bad apple, but not usually."
Shauna D.,"Lehi, UT",6,35,62,5.0,5/14/2015,Always love this place! The menu is so huge.  So many choices & types of food for every mood. I do love the Teriyaki Chicken & Chicken Madera are my personal favs! Drinks are also yum! Perfect for Birthdays or Anniversaries. Also makes a great date night! I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but they have a lemon tort cream cake to die for!
