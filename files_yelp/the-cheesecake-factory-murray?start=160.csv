D. W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",798,1407,,3.0,4/26/2015,"Salt Lake City has grown up a lot, in a culinary sense and nowhere is this more in abundance than this chain electing to finally land in this market. The city, in addition to badly needing an enema, also needs more upscale chains like this. The interior was nearly spot-on to a lot of the East coast locations I've hit up and the only flaw I could find was the black coating peeling back on every one of the benches. Despite it being jammed, this location was also the least amount of time I've ever waited to be seated at any of their restaurants. It's overall borderline artsy and tasteful and apropos for the lofty pretensions this chain has for itself. This is a very good representative restaurant of that, overall.  This extends to the food itself. Tons of alcoholic drinks on the menu and their annoying habit of including the Sunday-only stuff in the regular menu, but refusing to make any of it, unless you happen to be there on that day. That menu is extensive, but mostly a hodge-podge of standard Americana stuff, along with a bevy of questionable fusion ideas executed mostly poorly. The hallmark of this chain, to me, is that everything, including the cheesecake, is one note off. This extends to the Coke Zero mix, to the soy ginger, remoulade, Thai peanut and Dynamite mayo sauce, to the ""tempura"" batter on the shrimp and on down. The warm bread basket was nice and the bread was flavorful. This, along with the perfectly done fries, was probably the best part of the entire thing. The shrimp batter tasted slightly off and refused to go nicely with any of those 4 sauces I mentioned. The Cuban rolls was an intriguing idea; combining a Cubano into a spring roll. In execution, though, it's basically like they stuck everything in to a blender, stuffed it into a rice wrapper and fried it to death. This also refused to go with sauces, but the idea of a Cubano, when done well, is that it wouldn't need to. In case it's not clear, this was not done well. The mango key lime cheesecake was another disaster. Topped with artificial sugar whip, gloppy mango syrup, incredibly overdone key lime flavoring and next to no actual cheesecake taste, then mounted on a crust with bits of coconut that was itself a dense, overly thick chunky mess, it nearly defied eating. In fact, I bailed on it well before the end. This is a place I meant to get to since it opened and while it took longer than expected for the stars to align both with me having opportunity and the lines dying down, I finally made it and now it's done, probably never to be repeated again. Given that it will typically be busy (wait line was out the door when we left), know going in this place will be rather loud and service will be very put upon and performance will drop accordingly."
Matthew B.,"Riverton, UT",4,4,2,4.0,9/11/2015,"Come expecting tasty comfort food, a casual but noisy environment, and 30-minute or longer wait on Friday or Saturday nights and you won't be disappointed. The menu is epic, and the cooks deliver well on a surprising variety of foods. My favorite is the Shepherd's Pie."
Brittney G.,"South Jordan, UT",0,10,,5.0,11/17/2016,GO! You WILL enjoy!! The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorites! Great service and excellent food! The cheesecake is unbelievable!! Oreos cheesecake is one I recommend :)
Garrett N.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,77,7,4.0,7/16/2015,"I've always liked Cheesecake Factory. It just seems to be one of those places that fits any ""special"" occasion, whether it be a birthday, graduation, or a family reunion. In addition to its eclectic decor and snappily dressed staff, the restaurant's menu boasts more items than a Vegas buffet with a smorgasbord of dessert choices (not limited to cheesecake). This time we went for my wife's birthday and there were 7 of us in tow. I am always anxious about going to restaurants in large groups as I tend to be the one on top of things who knows what he wants and knows that the sooner everyone orders, the sooner everyone is feasting. My sentiments do not seem to be universally (or even commonly) acknowledged, yet the staff at The Cheesecake Factory was helpful, patient, and responsive. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce. It was delicious but no better than what you'd expect at a sit-down restaurant. My wife had the salmon spring rolls and shrimp summer spring rolls. She initially ordered the ahi tartare (all of these items are on the Skinnylicious menu), but they were out of tuna. Odd for 4 pm on a Wednesday, but she decided on the rolls instead. She loved both of them. The rest of the orders were similarly enjoyed (eggplant Parmesan [huge!], margarita pizza, herb-crusted salmon, steak medallions, and chicken bellagio). We also ordered seven slices of various cheesecakes, and there were no complaints there. The lovely waitress was cordial, quick with the drink and bread refills, and helpful to the finish. Nothing worth complaining about on this visit."
Lo D.,"Miami, FL",2,60,23,3.0,3/26/2016,"Service was very average. My soup and sandwich were good. The cheesecake I ordered here was below average. No, I wouldn't come back."
Kimberly L.,"Sandy, UT",1,3,,1.0,9/28/2015,"I have never given any restaurant one star, but the Cheesecake Factory in Murray is very deserving of a one star review  My husband and I went to Cheesecake for dinner because we had $100 in gift cards there. We paid for our $44 meal, only to find out that they lost our gift card before they ran it, leaving our meal unpaid for. We sat for an hour and a half, waiting for some action to be taken. Finally, the manager said that she was sorry they lost our $100 gift card, and ""we would just have to take our losses."" After we explained that we thought that was very unacceptable that they weren't willing to replace what was left on our gift card, she said the best she could do was give us a $25 gift card, and it would come out of our waiters pocket.  Wow. Just wow. Our waiter looked tirelessly for our gift card, and was stellar at taking care of us. I find it awful that a SENIOR manager would ever be so unwilling to replace our gift cards, and then later say she would do it at the expense of her own employee!!  After some discussion, she gave my husband the $25 gift card, and he called to see the balance of the card. It was zero-- in fact she had never even activated card, which the employee on the phone told us must happen in order to add money on the card. So not only this SENIOR MANAGER refuse to replace our gift cards initially, and later said she would give us $25 after losing $100, but she never even put money of the gift card!!  I'm extremely disappointed in the management and cannot believe that they would treat customers like that. We will definitely never be going to Cheesecake Factory ever again, and will be sure to share this story freely with everyone and anyone that wants to hear it.  The one star is for the delicious food and awesome server we had. Cheesecake management gets a -5 stars."
Ad S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",44,47,41,1.0,10/30/2015,The worst fish and chips I've ever tried to eat. Greasy greasy nasty disgusting. Tempura fried grease. Fine dining prices for low quality food. Service is desperately lacking. I really don't know why anyone comes here more than once
Ken B.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",7,8,1,1.0,11/22/2015,"My wife and I haven't been out for a night out in a long long time and we came here because it was good the last time we were here. Tonight the wait time was 1.5 hours and when we got our food the bread was hard as a ROCK seriously I tried to break the bread with my hand and it was as hard as a rock! Also my orange chicken was very dry and tasteless. Probably won't be back, one to somewhere else..."
Jana A.,"Arvada, CO",55,138,41,4.0,12/14/2014,"I like to visit the Factory of Cheesecake when I want something a little better then average on the food scale and I'm willing to drop $60 in the process.  This happens about 4 times a year. I have never had a bad server, they are always professional waitstaff. I assume this is because of the average price per plate.  This last time we ordered off the Sunday brunch menu and I had a fabulous crab hash and my husband had a sinful French toast sammich of doom.  Of course both were amazing. I was a little annoyed by some burned peppers in the hash but it was overcome by yummy poached eggs and real chunks of crab.  The decor is dated and very Las Vegas but who really cares as long as it's clean and the food is good?  One beef I have is the community seating. I HATE the long bench and the tiny tables spaced out by a foot. It's really difficult for the servers, it's gross to be so close to strangers when you're eating and quite frankly whoever invented it has probably never had the flu.  But I've learned to tell them up front to seat me at a booth and that I'm fine waiting. Though I've never waited at this location. Probably because I'm a scary intimidating bitch that happens to be very polite and authoritative with my demands.  Of course I'll be back."
Mike M.,"FOOTHILL RNCH, CA",77,130,749,4.0,12/31/2011,"Our server, Jessica, was fantastic and very helpfull. She steered us to some great appetizers. The two appetizers we had(sweet corn tamale cakes and Tex Mex egg rolls) were fabulously tasty. This place was very busy but our service was great. We split the chicken Madiera shrimp scampi combo and still could not finish it. The food was very good. We had a lemonade that was much too sweet we could not drink it without diluting it with our water. We had a very good time and I will be back."
Jessica W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,25,,4.0,1/18/2016,Umm. I love Cheesecake Factory! Such a big menu that there is something for everyone.
Tony S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",64,23,1,1.0,10/24/2015,Typical overpriced so so food.  In Any other state rather than Utah the full bar would make a difference however here they actually serve 1oz instead of the legal allowed 1-1/2 oz. they charge roughly the same money as rather would in other states for a watered down cocktail. I had a steak. Much better meals around for about 20-30% less. Also it's very noisy.
Jason N.,"Alpine, UT",37,10,5,2.0,5/15/2015,"If you like to wait for a long time for food...come here.  Food is okay. I have definitely had better.  Always crowded.  It has been several years since my wife and I had been here and decided to give it another try. Last time she ordered the miso salmon and the rice was crunchy.  Still a disappointment.  They need to work on service, the speed of serving food and the quality of the food."
Brittany F.,"Salt Lake City, UT",11,12,,2.0,12/29/2015,"I am really not a fan of the Cheesecake Factory. There are so many better places to go just in that shopping area. I dont like their huge menu and I feel like because of that they don't cook anything excellently, everything is mediocre."
Jacob G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2016,"Bad service, bad food!! Place has really gone down hill. Ever since around February this place has been horrible.. Dirty dishes, grumpy servers, bad managers and undercooked food.. Not clean or friendly don't go here... Also they always tell you about there cheesecakes but here's the real story... Frozen for months and months at a time, people walk on them, shuffle them in and out of freezers and then touch every slice without gloves... After touching mo way, hair, cleaning supplies... Gross"
Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102,3.0,12/1/2012,"You have to admire any chain restaurant that will outright admit to being a factory that mass produces food items.  Sure, we know this is the case with all chains, but heck I'm going to give them a pass on this and one other factor - they do really have cheesecake (as is also suggested in their name) and plenty of it! I've been to the Cheesecake Factory maybe 3 times.  And it has always been okay, but not really anywhere I can say I am likely to actually choose to go of my own volition, I've only really been for group or family events.  In fact my criteria for going is simple: 1. Someone else is paying. 2. I can get a couple of bites of cheesecake mixed into my dining experience. 3. (And most important) - If it prevents any chance of having to visit the Olive Garden I'll throw all other criteria straight out of the window. So with the stage now set, I can say that today's visit really was not too bad.  What I do know about this chain is the portions are HUGE, so I generally order the 'lunch' items, which are more moderate portions if your definition of that is a medium sized banquet.  And of those, the meat loaf is the best one in my experience, it is actually pretty darn good and ultimately why they get 3 stars here.  Fish and Chips is definitely somewhat MEH - so avoid if that's the fix you are looking for! I also must say, I'm a fan of Cheesecake, however deserts in general are also a fan of my waste line so I try to avoid as much as possible.  But the ones I've tried here, particularly the seasonal and specialty ones do hit the spot.  Peppermint candy cheesecake anyone?  Yummy.  Lot better than it sounds! Service was very friendly, and overall prompt considering how busy it was, certainly nothing too much to complain about here.  The overall ambiance is also pretty good - if I have one complaint - it's that the music can be a little too loud and overwhelming at times.  I'm not however going to take a star for that, I tend to be a bit of an audiophile, and I think that, combined with age is making me somewhat sensitive about what I tend to consider 'irritating' background noise.  For the younger crowd it could be great. If you've never been, definitely give it a try.  Just beware of those portions if you're on any type of diet (and I suspect, not just portions, but all the other food pyramid busting goodness lovingly cooked in at the factory!!!!)."
Sande A.,"Portland, OR",0,4,,3.0,2/21/2016,"I just wanted some cheesecake to go and thought I could duck in, grab some desert and duck out.  Poor organization made this impossible. Customers waiting for a table are forced to stand in front of the case and register. There is no signage to say where to order or pick up take out, and the congestion of people behind the counter are in each other's way. It was a total mess and took way too long. I tipped when I ordered and paid but seriously felt like I paid for service I didn't get. 20+ minutes to pick up a slice of cheesecake, after I ordered is ridiculous!"
Robert B.,"Grantsville, UT",1,20,1,4.0,7/25/2014,"Any American dish or pasta is always done right. I love their steak Diane, it's cooked in a red wine reduction sauce with their delicious horse radish mashed potatoes.   Anything Asian I've noticed is good, but not amazing. Service is very friendly, but this place usually has a long wait on the weekends. Good place for a birthday party or a date. If you have a massive zit on your face, the dim lighting will make you appear more attractive ;-)"
Rich G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",36,40,9,3.0,12/1/2014,"When I walk into the Cheesecake Factory in Fashion Place,  I am struck by the high end ambiance.   This is supposedly just a family restaurant,  but it does not come across that way with the lighting,  the marble table tops and the art. I am also impressed by the extensive menu selections with the wide variety of food and what a big job the food preparers must have to keep everything so fresh.  I will start with the drinks.   We arrived at about 9pm.  The place was 75 % full.   That being said,  why does it take 15 minutes to have a glass of Pinot Noir delivered to the table?  I want to be able to relax with a drink and have a great conversation with my gorgeous date!   There needs to be more time to talk with a drink before we eat.  Bring the drinks within 5 minutes and let us talk for 15 minutes or so.  That is part of the enjoyment of having a drink before dinner. This is a problem with many Utah restaurants not just the Cheesecake Factory.   Ok, so we order our food,  which was just the chicken nachos.   They were very good.   We really wanted to save room for the main event. ..the delicious cheesecakes!  After finishing the nachos,  we ordered the blueberry cheesecake and the snickers cheesecake.  The blueberry was very light and anything but ordinary.   Perfect finish when the meal is heavy cheese and chips.   The snickers cheesecake was the exact opposite!   Very rich and very heavy but oh so scrumptious!!   Overall,  the food here is pretty good,  but is still just family style food with portions that I have found to be ridiculously large. The price is also a little high.  Service is ok, but not spetacular therfore,  I can only give it three stars."
Ashton C.,"Herriman, UT",0,2,2,1.0,8/14/2015,The Google page says that they take reservations so we decided to get a group together to go today at 6:30 with 13 people I call to make the reservation and they refuse to make one say they don't take them. I told him it shows when you google the Murray location it says that they in fact take reservations. But if you call to make one its not going to happen.  Now we have to change plans with the party.
