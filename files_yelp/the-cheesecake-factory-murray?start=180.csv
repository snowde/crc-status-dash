Tony L.,"Sandy, UT",636,1069,4491,3.0,12/13/2010,"This place is still one of the most popular teenage dating spot in Salt Lake even after the initial opening hypes die down over the years, so expect a wait longer than steakhouses.  The dim light and classy decors both sets the mood for your romantic conversations.  The service has been quite consistently good for all of my visits here. As for the food, I truly believe they wanted to bring out your indecisiveness with the excessive number of items on their menu.  Every time I came here, their menu always overwhelmed me, and it took numerous processes of eliminations to figure out what I want to order.   If you are limited budget, I would recommend their Sunday Brunch, it actually has more food than dinner for lower price, and I personally enjoyed their Egg Benedict.  It is healthy, delicious, and I sure love a perfectly poached egg. For dinner appetizer, I would go for the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll.  It is not exactly a traditional Japanese dish, more like a Chinese-Japanese fusion with western plating, which to my surprise turned out very well.  Crunchy like egg rolls with texture like sushi~   The portion is huge, you may consider substituting that for the main course. For those that just want to get a salad, I recommend the Seared Tuna Tataki Salad.  The fish and fresh vegetable just went well together.  For the actual main course, I would go for the Wasabi Crusted Ahi Tuna.  I could not tasted any spiciness in the wasabi, but the crust goes very well with the tuna, and the miso sauce rice underneath seem to go well with the dish overall.  I do believe they need to enhance the wasabi flavor more. Now for the bad...  the steak is pretty bad here, I never had a single good experience with their meat dishes here.  They seem to have a tendency of overcooking them with poor seasoning... bland is the word I would use to describe them.   The pasta is next bad choice I experienced here.  I tried the Shrimp with Angel Hair and it was painfully flavorless.  I would however recommend the Thai Chicken Pasta, which was delicious.  Other dishes I tried tasted pretty average. Cheesecakes are also hit or miss, the Tiramisu and Wild Blueberry cheesecakes were very good, but ones like Cherry, Key Lime, Pumpkin, and the Low Carb ones were very hard and bland. Overall, if I only tried the good things in this place, I would be a fan, but after experience the bad, I have to average down the overall score.  I guess with a menu this big, you are bound to experience vicissitudes in your visits."
Chase G.,"Midvale, UT",65,3,,3.0,10/28/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has amazing food, service, ambience, and a wonderful overall experience. You're probably curious as to why I rated it as less than satisfactory, it is the lack of a digital presence in this ever growing digital age. Most restaurants of this calibre have advanced to the point that they accept digital reservations through services such as OpenTable, not The Cheesecake Factory. Most provide free wireless Internet for those of us that prefer to do business while dining, not The Cheesecake Factory.  This may not seem significant to most, but in time, it will be the determining factor in the overall success of a business, especially with the launch of services such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet as they innovate the convenience of payment. Apple Pay is my default form of payment due to its ease of use and security features, The Cheesecake Factory is the only premium restaurant in Salt Lake that lacks progression, this is why I limit my rating to three stars. Only those that are with or ahead of this digital game are worthy of five stars."
James H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",28,244,135,3.0,9/10/2014,"I like the feel of The Cheescake Factory (busy, clean, and nicely decorated) but was more impressed with the presentation than the actual taste of the food.  My lunch companion's chicken parm sandwich looked incredible yet he only ate half of it l.  The miso salmon I ordered looked delicious but the sauce could have used more miso and the white rice could have been stickier.  I however at least finished my plate.  We passed on dessert but I suspect the experience would have been similar.  Lots of flash with little substance.  Good thing I like flash..."
Sabrina W.,"South Jordan, UT",0,35,1,1.0,6/21/2014,"This review is for the location and service.  The food tastes the same no matter which location you eat at, and is always decent.  We went on a Saturday around 2:30. It took over an hour to get our food.  Other patrons that came in after us were served before us. My husband had a salad and I had a salad, soup, sandwich combo.  No excuse. The waitress kept coming back and saying she'd go check to see what was taking so long, making comments about ""are they growing the lettuce back there?""  Finally our meals came out.  Mine was wrong and my husbands was missing the dressing.  Took another 10 minutes to get the correct meals. He still didn't have dressing.  He was so upset by the time it came out he told them to just take it back. I ate mine because I was starving.  Thank goodness our kids weren't with us. Never going back."
Jennifer G.,"Draper, UT",57,33,118,5.0,7/19/2014,"I always order the Louisiana chicken pasta with no mushroom and extra cayenne pepper! It's a huge portion and tastes good the next day! My bf orders the chicken Madeira and everything about that dish is tasty the freshly  mashed potatoes, the asparagus and the chicken is so fresh! Once in awhile we'll order the Mac and cheese burger and THAT is amazing if you love Mac and cheese!"
Elle P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",6,149,41,5.0,4/18/2014,"I know it's a chain.   But it serves some of the most amazing food ever.  And if you have a special request or dietary restriction, they not only honor it, the well versed servers will offer tasty suggestions! I have NEVER been disappointed with any meal I have ordered at any Cheescake Factory.  That is why we keep coming back!  The servers are always friendly, knowledgable and aware of your table.  Never seem to run dry, which is a pet peeve of mine. I have read some reviews that were frustrated with the wait time (which can be long, but  shopping at ZGallerie cuts down on that and is a pleasant distraction) and the closeness of the tables. It's a franchise people, you will have similar configurations at all Cheescake Factory locations.  Hardly seems worth complaining about.  You know what you are getting when you choose to dine at a Cheesecake Factory.  Now if want to wage a complaint against the 50 page menu...  Just kidding! Oh, and did I mention the cheese cake?  To die for.  There."
Michael V.,"Ogden, UT",4,5,2,5.0,9/26/2014,"Hands down my favorite restaurant chain! I love their food. I've never tried any desserts but heard very good things.  Their raspberry lemonade is amazing! But pricey ($4.50, free refills). So far I've tried the wasabi crusted ahi tuna (also pricey at $22.50) and the Kobe burger (~$15). I was impressed with both dishes and would certainly go back again!"
Robin A.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",16,114,17,4.0,10/16/2015,"You really cant go wrong with the cheesecake factory,I try to come at an odd time to avoid the long wait. I really haven't explored much of the menu because I have my favorite go to meal. It starts with the mac and cheese balls which are amazing, I've tried to recreate this with no such luck, next I get the chicken madera, it comes with two huge chicken breasts and a large portion of mashed potatoes with asparagus all toped off with mozzarella cheese, this dish is definitely one to be shared. Cheesecake is a must here even if it's to be taken home for later."
Rocio H.,"Carlsbad, NM",2,12,,1.0,5/2/2015,The hostess people are worthless. We waited an hour. I knew it was busy so I was OK. After the hour I reminded them and was told they paged me forever. I was freaking sitting next to them. Why the hell do you take names if you don't use them? The waiter service was excellent and the food was superb but the hostess need better training. I will not go back to this location.
Brenda P.,"Rigby, ID",51,10,,2.0,7/26/2015,"Food was great, the service was awful. One of our party has a severe garlic allergy and when we asked about specific ingredients our waiter rolled his eyes at us and was rude.Bottom line this is poor customer service. We also were not offered refills on our iced tea. This is the first time ever that I have not left a tip."
Kori L.,"Cumming, GA",0,43,27,5.0,9/5/2015,"I don't get how you can go to Cheesecake Factory, order a cheeseburger like you're in some Applebee's or something, and then rate the entire restaurant two stars. We got two small plates, the crispy cheese and the pretzel crusted chicken, which were INCREDIBLE, along with a main dish split. We ordered the Chicken Bellagio, which is a basil pasta with crispy chicken cutlets, prosciutto, arugula and Romano cheese. So good. Perfectly paired flavors. Totally kind staff.  You can easily split an entree here. And for an appetizer, a huge dinner, and chocolate mousse cheesecake to go for later, our bill was $30. You can't argue with that. It's heaven."
Lily T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,27,3,4.0,11/1/2015,"I definitely love food and ambience at this place, I always order bang bang shrimp and chicken and margarita for my dinner. However, we had to wait for at least half an hour to get a table"
Bill J.,"Sandy, UT",12,39,2,1.0,8/28/2014,Had the chicken tacos the tortillas didn't hold the chicken it fell through the chicken didn't taste good it dripped all over my expensive shirt they didn't give my salad to me correctly they brought the salad back three times before they had it right. They said to make up for the problems they would give me free cheesecake. But they only brought the bill and scattered. Not planning on going back!
Ryan L.,"Sandy, UT",77,162,55,3.0,1/16/2014,"Restaurant: 2 stars. Cheesecake: 5 stars.  Lots of hype for this restaurant, and I was disappointed.  First of all, they don't take reservations, which comes off as pretty arrogant for a restaurant. So you have to wait for what's usually quite a long time. Then they give you the famous novel of a menu, which is chock full of a huge selection of mediocre food. I've tried a lot of it over the years at different locations across the states, and never found anything to write home about.  The service has never impressed me too much, and more than once I've had a negative experience.  BUT (and this is a big but) that cheesecake is awesome. Fantastic. Delicious. Divine.  So here's what I do & what I recommend: go get a slice of Cheesecake to go. Then you experience all of the good and avoid all of the bad. Mmm, cheesecake."
Johnny M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,7,1,1.0,10/7/2015,"My wife and I went here to celebrate our anniversary, we loved the one in downtown Salt Lake. So we thought this one should be just as amazing. Boy were we wrong! First we ordered our food then the power went out, which is fine, things happen. We sat in the dark for about 45 minutes before our waitress came up and told us that our food wasn't going to be able to be made. I don't know why it took so long for them to tell us. Because by the time they came out and finally told us, all other restaurants were closed and we couldn't have dinner anywhere. To top it off instead of comping our future meal to come back another time to compensate for what happened, they told us that if we wanted to, we could BUY some cheesecake! I asked to speak with the manager and our waitress went to get her. She never came. So I asked the person at the front desk to speak with the manager and they said that the general manager of both stores was there and asked if I wanted to speak with her, I said enthusiastically yes that would be even better. We waited for about 15 minutes and she never came but instead after 15 more minutes of waiting, kid came out from the back and told us to choose 1 piece of cheesecake to share between the two of us for free. We didn't want cheesecake, we want to dinner. We were starving by then.  I asked if they would comp a future meal for us to make up for all the waiting and no food and they said no. I will not be returning to this cheesecake factory ever again. And I will make sure that my family and friends know that the only good cheesecake factory in the valley is the one in downtown Salt Lake in the City Creek Center. Do not go to this one. It is nowhere as nice on the inside and the employees are way worse!"
Amy K.,"Tucson, AZ",269,109,798,3.0,11/14/2013,"So I'm kind of big on good customer service, being noticed and feeling special even though I am only here to have thai lettuce wraps. The couple of times I've been at this location(because it's close to where I live) I have been disappointed deeply in the host/hostess staff.  First don't make me say something to you, all 3 of you standing there, and don't ask me to wait for two people when the restaurant is almost empty. I don't get that.  The food is usually good...tons to choose from. I'll keep eating here and I realize it's a chain sooooo I'll get over it."
Kira S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,2,,5.0,5/8/2016,"Just had an amazing lunch at the bar and the two girls working the bar we're amazing. They had amazing team work, dedication and great work ethic. They we're on top of what everyone needed, fast and sweet. Beat service ever. Thank you."
Sky T.,"Melbourne, FL",137,213,554,5.0,7/19/2011,"Okay, I may be a little bias but I love The Cheesecake Factory. I, Sky Thai, LOVE The Cheesecake Factory. Absolutely love, love, love it. Maybe because my favorite dessert is cheesecake and it's part of the name and I loved everything I ever had here. (Not to mention that many memories of birthdays and friend's birthdays were held here.) Not sure why I love it so, but I love The Cheesecake Factory. I think if I were a restaurant, I would be The Cheesecake Factory. Best chain restaurant in existence. LOVE IT! - - - - - - - - - - Anyways back from my fanboy moment, it has a slightly elegant but comfortable and relaxing feel that just works to bring the best of the upscale and comfort of a lowscale together in harmony. What more can you ask for? The lunch specials are seriously good for what they get you and are so very delicious and yum-yum good. The dinners are the same way and you get a hefty, tantalizing portion of whatever you order. They like to pretty up the tasty food so big points for plating design. (You do know you eat with your eyes first.) I have not had anything bad here and I don't expect to but hey, if you have a problem with the meal they will get another one for you at no cost. That's what they did for a friend of mine and that's what I call good customer service. Yes, it is crowded in the evenings and the waits can be atrociously long but go on the ""off days"" (Sunday-Thursday) in the afternoon or early evening to get a seat. If all else fails, just go shopping at the Fashion Place Mall or at some other store nearby to kill time until the wait ""should"" be over. You just gotta play the waiting game sometimes but I think it is worth it. Oh, and how could I forget about the cheesecake itself? In a nutshell, there is a huge assortment and array of the decadently guilty pleasure. I am pretty sure you will find something that appeals to your wanting tastebuds. Just go to the gym and work it off later, indulge a little. I definitely recommend this restaurant to go to because I think it is a pleaser for just about everybody."
Maxfield W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",764,42,8,3.0,6/13/2015,"Good food, huge portions, but the staff isn't my favorite. Turning too many tables makes them tired and clumsy. Have had multiple mess ups with my orders and even had a manager come over who argued with me about how my experience was... Say what?"
