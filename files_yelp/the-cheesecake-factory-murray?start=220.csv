Lily W.,"Sandy, UT",1,3,,1.0,8/14/2014,"The Cheesecake Factory has been my favourite place to eat ever since I was a child. My girlfriend flew in from Japan and naturally I wanted her to try it. The food is spectacular and great at every restaurant but this location's management is horrid. We tried to order a cocktail to share and they didn't accept my girlfriend's Irish government issued ID, nor her European Union health insurance card to prove her identity and age and instead dicked us around and put her down about it. I will always recommend the food here but never go to this location again. The waitress we had also gave us attitude about the whole situation. Afterwards we just went to Red Rock in the same plaza for drinks, go there instead, the service is fantastic."
Kimberly D.,"West Bountiful, UT",23,35,,4.0,12/19/2012,"PRESENTATION: I always want to dig in so fast before I could admire it. TASTE: Everything always taste so good when I come here. I've been here several times and I never leave disappointed of the food we get. SERVICE: Here comes the service... The last time I came here for a birthday, we pretty much waited for like 3 hours for 14 top and it was driving us crazy, cause every time we asked when will be up they always told us 15 to 25 minutes. I've never had to wait that long for just a table and they blamed it on the ""bachlorette party"" because that's we were getting sitted at, you need to realize you have a lot of other places to sit us then that spot. Servers are excellent at their job though, always tending us on what we need. VALUE: For the price you pay, you won't walk away unhappy."
Matt T.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,88,6,4.0,10/22/2014,Always great service here the food is quality and plentiful. Wish they would have built it bigger so you didn't have to wait in line so long sometimes.
Tesia V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,14,,3.0,4/1/2015,"This place takes aaaages to get food on the weekend. It was 2 hours of total time on Sunday afternoon. It was so packed and loud with chatter. The food wasn't terrible, but not great. If you're really determined for a slice of great cheesecake, then this place is for you. Just want a quick lunch? Not so much."
Meg J.,"West Jordan, UT",1,20,1,4.0,3/15/2015,"Food is great, very large and tasty menu. Wait times are often very long and service hadn't been as good at this location lately."
Kathryn L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,35,2,2.0,1/13/2015,"Over priced, over crowded,  underwhelming food. I am not sure what it is that makes this place so great. The food was mediocre. The cheesecake wasn't anything better than what I can buy at Costco.  It is SO loud in here that trying to have a conversation is pointless. I won't be back."
Kelie H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",263,689,222,4.0,2/4/2011,"Cheesecake Factory is a chain that I do enjoy dining at from time to time, mostly on lunch while at work during the week. I have visited this location maybe 3 times in the past 2 years, most recently today! The wait is always long. I was surprised that there is still a huge line out the door even though they have been open for some time now. We opted to sit at the bar where we found 3 seats readily available and enjoyed some great lunch conversation and hijincks with some older gentlemen sitting off to our left. The bartenders gave us exceptional service the entire time and were attentive and talkative, but not overbearing in their recommendations. I feel like the menu at Cheesecake Factory is incredibly overwhelming with too many choices and the ads especially bug me, but the dishes I have tried are delicious and prepared well. My favorite is the lunch portion (which is still enormous) of the pasta da vinci. I also like the stuffed mushrooms on the small plates menu and the passion iced tea is flavorful.  I never order cheesecake because the slices are humongous and the calories in one are probably two days worth of your daily allowance, but it looks very, very delectable."
BeckyLynn W.,"West Jordan, UT",90,96,15,5.0,11/12/2015,"The hubby and I went for an early dinner last night to Cheesecake Factory.  We shared an appetizer of Guacamole Eggrolls and then split an entree of Chicken Madeira and to top it off we shared a slice of the Salted Caramel Cheesecake!  I'll start from the beginning.  We didn't need to wait very long..just about 10 minutes.  We knew what we wanted so we quickly placed our order of Guacamole Eggrolls to start off with!  Oh my....I'm always surprised on how FANTASTIC these are!  You cannot get anything like this from anywhere..the flavor is crazy good and that dipping sauce...I could drink it by the gallon!!!  What a great way to start off the meal!  Our entree came right after, perfect timing and it was so good.  It's a huge portion so it's always great to be able to share that meal!  The chicken was pounded thin and cooked perfectly!  Oh their mashed potatoes are a great texture and super yummy! They brought out fresh warm bread and it was wonderful! Our server featured the Salted Caramel Cheesecake and immediately we went for it!  That is my all time favorite one now!  It was spectacular!!!!  What a great meal from beginning to end!  I love this place!"
Spencer C.,"South Jordan, UT",74,4,,1.0,12/8/2014,"This place has the worst customer service of any restaurant. They won't take reservations even for very large (18-20) people. They won't tell you the wait time until you show up and then you find out it's going to be 4 hours before you are seated with a few kids in tow this is far less than ideal. I get that they like the image of the insanely pretentious restaurant but they've taken it way too far. The food is pretty good but it also takes about 20 min to get through the menu that is chock full of advertisements. I won't be going back, and next time I get a ""gift card"" there I'll be posting it for sale since it isn't worth the energy."
Doug F.,"South Jordan, UT",93,16,1,3.0,5/18/2014,"We ordered 2 rib eye steaks, one of their more expensive items on their menu and were disappointed. The steaks had a lot of charcoal on it. It was not the money! The service was good, just not the food."
Joseph S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",58,64,,4.0,8/14/2014,"For a restaurant that has so many options,  Cheesecake Factory is incredible.  Great appetizers,  drinks,  entrees and desserts.  The ambiance is very nice too.  The only thing I don't like is the wait,  but it's a long wait because it's good."
David G.,"Taylorsville, UT",18,9,5,1.0,11/21/2015,"Table, silverware, and drink cups were very dirty. Even after bringing us new silverware. You'd think that they would pay attention when you request a new set due to the original being dirty. Ruined my appetite there but reluctantly ordered dinner since the kids and wife were starving and didn't want to go somewhere else. We ordered a chicken Bellagio and it was very bland, realized after we'd eaten most of it that was missing the cream sauce. The kids didn't eat half of their meals, corn dogs were soggy, Mac and cheese was runny like a soup, and the slider buns were also soggy. We ordered buffalo blasts as an appetizer and they were good but we avoided the buffalo sauce as it appeared to have pieces of something in it and we hadn't dipped at all. This isn't the first time that things have lacked in the department of cleanliness. It's a shame because we typically love this place but I am finding less and less reasons to return."
Mrs D.,"American Fork, UT",0,41,16,2.0,1/21/2015,"WINS Avocado egg roll appetizers are so insanely yummy.   The Cajun jambalaya pasta was awesome.   Baja chicken tacos were amazing but are 3 small tacos & not filling for a grown man FAILS Kitchen failed to have any of the dressings on the side Kitchen also failed to exclude requested ingredients e.g. Tortilla chips off of the Santa Fe salad, Bacon off of the Cobb salad Ligthing is so dark at night that we used our phones flashlights to see our food & to pick out the crap they forgot to leave out of our salads. Chicken Di Pana is a total let down.  You really could get something better at a Cracker Barrel ONLY's    Food is amazing when they can actually deliver your order correctly which still doesn't make up for 1 to 2 hour wait times to be seated along with hidden allergens left"
Bryan C.,"Lehi, UT",0,3,3,5.0,8/22/2014,Service was good chad did an excellent job and the food was good and it was good size portions
Abigail K.,"Indianapolis, IN",12,21,2,4.0,6/20/2014,I have been to this location several times. Everytime they are very accomodating for such a large group that we show up with. Also at one of my friends birthday's the server remembered all of our names and addressed each one of us when speaking to us. I am not a fancy schmancy lady but I thought that was super nice. Aside from that the food is always soooooo good and portions are huge so you can share with anyone and every one!
Jo L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,18,7,2.0,10/29/2015,Overrated restaurant... Foods were okay but do not worth the price that they are charging.... Cheesecake just terrible... No different than the cheesecake that you can buy from the supermarket.... Basically super sweet and lack of flavor..makes you think its made out of cheap ingredients
Ando N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,4,,4.0,4/30/2014,"Cheesecake factory is my wifes and my favorite location no matter which state we are in. Their menu is enormous and has something for everyone. The only complaint I've had with the CF is the kitchen smell. Though it is not the case for all the 15 locations I've been at, it is for the location here in Murray. The smell spoils the good aroma of food. Perhaps keeping the kitchen room door closed would help."
Darren W.,"Draper, UT",62,10,,3.0,2/25/2012,"No chain-based restaurant is worth an hour and a half wait. TCF proves this to be true. We finally gave up waiting and turned our wives loose on finding us a bar table. Our server was great but the food did not make up for the incredibly long wait.  That being said if you end up there and have persevered try the hummus and pita appetizer it was the best thing we ordered. The shrimp tacos off the skinnylicious menu were good, the tuscan chicken was tasty but nothing made up for the long wait in a crowded foyer. Sadly we were so late getting through dinner we skipped the one thing that might have rescued the meal: Cheesecake!"
Prissy S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,32,,4.0,7/4/2014,"Ahhh The Cheesecake Factory.  I've been a fan of this chain since way before it landed here in UT.  Whenever I was out of state on vacation I'd ""hunt"" for one so I could enjoy some good meal. I took my family to the Murray location this past Sunday for dinner.  I was really happy to see there were no crowds or huge waiting times to get seated.  We were able to get a table within 5 minutes.  Score! Our server was very, VERY nice.  He was friendly, attentive and would come to check on our drinks and on us often.  He definitely deserves 5 stars!  The service we got from him was great! The four star rating goes to the food.  I can't remember the exactly name of the dish I ordered but it was some type of pasta from the light menu.  The dish was good BUT it had way too much pepper/hot spices added to it.  I felt like I was eating a mexican dish and not italian.  I was able to finish it but it would have been a much better dish if it wasn't too spicy.   I got the pineapple upside down cheesecake for dessert and that was the BEST cheesecake I've ever had at the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm always afraid of ordering a slice of cheesecake because they are usually too sugary or too rich for my taste.  But not this one.  It was deliciously perfect.  Give it a try. This wasn't my first time at this location and certainly not my last.  I'm a fan."
Wei H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,23,4,2.0,4/18/2014,"I have been to this place a couple times whenever I miss their start bread, not sure about the name but pretty heavy and dark color. Their food is so so and poor service, their desert not as good as whole foods, not sure why so many people like to go there."
