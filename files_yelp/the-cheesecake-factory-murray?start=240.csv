Larissa V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",123,76,134,4.0,1/14/2014,"Delicious.  Yum.  More.  I'm going to puke, I'm so stuffed. Those are words you will often hear when at The Cheesecake factory. Unfortunately, at this location I also tend to feel like you hear: The wait for a seat is over an hour?! Where is the waiter/waitress? How long could this possibly take? It's been twenty minutes since my water was gone - where is someone who can refill it? We can all appreciate the charm and allure and familiarity of an extremely popular chain restaurant...especially once that is just about one of the best out there, but for the amount of time it takes to get service here, it's just not worth it for me.   That being said, I always, always, always enjoy my food at Cheesecake Factory.  Their appetizers, entrees, and desserts are all heaven on a plate.  My experiences have been much better at the City Creek location, but if you have a hankering, this'll do in a pinch...a really, really long pinch."
Jeff C.,"Orem, UT",115,230,37,4.0,5/2/2014,"The Cheesecake is awesome and I don""t even really care for Cheesecake. The portions sizes for the entrees are enormous. One the of the strengths can also be one of there weaknesses. They have a huge menu and a wide variety of dining options however that can cause one thing you try like fish tacos to be very average and a pasta dish like Chicken Madeira was fantastic.  Our favorite appetizer are the avocado egg rolls they are full of yummy real avocado. A good idea if you would like to enjoy all the courses is to split the entree. The wait is usually long so get here early."
Alexandra M.,"Sandy, UT",9,9,,2.0,3/18/2014,Chicken Alfredo was extremely oily. How does that even happen?! The food is over priced and cheaply made. Stay home and make spaghetti instead.
R. R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,24,,5.0,5/26/2015,"Such a great place to go.  A little on the pricey side (when a slice of cheesecake costs more than 1 beer...really?!)  We tried the Habachi Steak and the fried calamari.  Amazing!  Would suggest this meal to everyone!  Very busy, so plan on having a little bit of a wait for dinner, but I would say its worth it!"
Jenner B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",42,12,,3.0,10/5/2014,"What a disappointment! If you want overpriced food, sub par service, lots of noise and long waits this is the place for you! The 3 stars is for the food because it is very tasty. I had a factory burrito that was huge, packed full of meat and veggis, and very flavorful. However tasty it might have been it did not equal the hefty price and poor service.  We were lucky to get a booth but man some of those tables are crammed in so tight you might as well ask the people next to you join you. Due to its layout the place is very noisy. We also got a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go which was $7.50 for one slice and a mistake. I didn't see the slice until I got home, but it was tiny and the taste was pretty bland. Save yourself the trouble and find somewhere else worth your time and money."
Ivan E.,"Woods Cross, UT",38,36,6,3.0,7/12/2012,"The food here is always great, as long a you don't mind longer than usual waits.  Excellent selection of cheesecakes, of course."
Chris M.,"Sandy, UT",59,259,1,4.0,2/23/2014,Cheesecake Factory has good mainstream mall food.  I've been to the Salt Lake location a couple times.  Food was excellent and tasty.  The restaurant itself is very loud and crammed (especially if you're a party of two).  Our service this last time was a little slow and it seemed the server had too many tables.
Lauren S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3,30,,1.0,6/4/2015,"The wait on a Thursday evening is forever long. The booth we were given had so many food crumbs on the seat. After a long wait, it took a long time for the server to get us water. The server was nice and friendly, but overall, the service was almost non-existent. Waiting for the food took forever long. The bread, quesadilla, salad wraps and tiramisu cheesecake were good. The Tuscan Chicken, however, was beautifully described on the menu, but turned out to be dreadfully horrendous with too much sauce. I love sweet potato fries, but there was too much seasoning. After the meal, I realized how much MSG was in the food. I drank so much water throughout the meal, but I am dehydrated now. The non-stop atmospheric noise is a headache. The dark cave of lighting feels similar to a prostitution house. You might as well sell your soul to a soulless monopolization of food. This is no fancy place to have a dinner or to celebrate a birthday. Over this overrated place."
Amy W.,"Livermore, CA",70,51,1,4.0,11/28/2011,"I've been to several Cheesecake Factory restaurants and they are always consistent.  I like knowing what I can expect when dining and having meals that are reliable in flavor & quality.   So, why am I reviewing this particular Cheesecake Factory?  I'll tell you.   The background:  My bf and I went to UT for our usual ski/snowboard trip.  We have never enjoyed dining options in old Salt Lake City (or Provo, Draper or even Park City).  We decided to go to a chain restaurant to decrease the odds of disappointment and Cheesecake Factory was nearby. The experience:  when we got there, there was an hour wait (at 6 om on a Saturday night).  I was amazed because it is a chain and the night was young.  But, knowing the food crisis in UT (nothing is good, really!)- I understand.  This is why I removed 1 star- no one should wait an hour for a chain restaurant at only 6pm.  Thankfully, we were able to find seating at the bar right away. This is where the service magic happened.  We were greeted immediately, even with the crowd.  The bartender & an assistant were attentive, funny and helpful.  Our food- chicken madiera & steak diane- was the usual quality/taste/etc which is a blessing (yes blessing- it is Mormon country folks).  The bartender made a custom drink to my bf's request & did so confidently and kindly.  I had the apple martini.  The highlight- we substituted well liquor for top shelf (Chopin Vodka & Grand Marnier) and we were not charged extra for this nor for the unique custom drink. I WOULD RECOMMEND this place if you are in the Salt Lake/Draper area and are frustrated by the stand alone rip off poor quality restaurants that are abundant in this area."
Dylan R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,3,1,5.0,3/2/2014,"I've been here twice now. Once three months ago. Both visits I was very impressed with the food as well as the staff. The portions are big. I've never left hungry. Quite busy both times, but only a 10 minute wait."
Jillene A.,"Herriman, UT",1,17,,2.0,1/9/2013,"The wait is ridiculous. I wish there was more seating for the waiting customers. We went there early to hope to avoid the rush, but no luck. There was still a long wait. I don't like the seating... I feel like I am in a ""speed dating"" setting. I didn't even want to talk to my husband because there were people right on either side of me.  The food was alright, but nothing to write home about.  It's pretty expensive too.  I do love the cheesecake however.   We'll probably only go back once, and that is because we have a gift card we got for Christmas. But you can bet your bottom dollar we won't be going on a weekend, or at night...."
Chelsea G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,4,,2.0,6/3/2015,"I have had good service here from time to time. The wait is always really long. You wait forever on the food. The quality of the food is so so... I think it's way too expensive for what it is. Nothing is all that special about the Cheesecake Factory. I liked this place when it first opened, but the food has gone way down hill. I think they have cheapened it somehow and the prices keep going up on the food too. I don't know why people like this place. I think Red Rock is way better than this place. If I had a choice Red Rock will always win. So if you are thinking of eating here, I would suggest walking over to Red Rock instead."
Julie H.,"Midvale, UT",42,7,,4.0,1/20/2014,Eternally long wait to get a table most nights. Food is worth it and beyond fantastic though. Customer service is great once seated. Portions are huge.
Dylan L.,"Denver, CO",134,450,39,3.0,10/16/2011,"Good food, good service, but definitely on the expensive side. I've had lunch here a few times when I'm at the Fashion Place mall, and it is a nice addition to the area. The interior is very nice, and the patio is a great choice for warm, sunny day. Even on cooler days, they have heaters going so you can enjoy the fresh outdoor air. The wait staff is consistently nice and speedy, no issues there and actually, these guys have some of the best service I've seen. Alas, this place is pretty expensive. The last time I was here for lunch, two entrees without a drink or desert came out to be $23...yipes! It's worth coming here every now because the service is great and the place itself is really nice, but it certainly isn't cheap."
Drew T.,"Provo, UT",23,36,8,3.0,10/19/2011,"The Cheesecake Factory has a lot going for it; good food, good service, nice atmosphere, and great dessert (as the name would suggest).  The problem is that is also has quite a bit that does not help it; long lines, expensive prices, also the menu is ridiculously long( due in part to the full page adds it sells but by no means would the menu be anything but excruciatingly long with out them).  To go along with this the portion sizes are big enough to feed a medium sized family.  I understand that people want to feel full after they have eaten at a restaurant they have spent some of their hard earned money on  but these portion sizes are just laughable. On a side not this las visit we had a waitress that was not so great.  She took ten minutes to get our drink orders and that was only after i had to ask somebody to find her.  She also told us the special of the day was ""So so"".  Not exactly the best service but i would dare say that this is by no means the norm."
B A.,"Spanish Fork, UT",0,16,3,1.0,4/15/2013,Did not make it past the hostess. When seated at a booth near the restroom and kitchen we asked for a different booth (there were six others empty next to the one they wanted us to sit at) we were told it would be ten minute wait. There were only two other couples waiting to be seated. We decided to leave and will never go back to this location. City Creek is the only one I will go to in Utah.
Scott R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",69,404,11,3.0,1/28/2013,"It seems the only time I dine at the Cheesecake Factory is when there is birthday or on vacation? I can't say I hate this place by any means. But I really don't understand everyone's devotion and love of it? The menu is so overwhelming that if you don't know what you want when you go. You will be scanning the menu over 30 minutes. So I always have to tell myself what I really feel like before showing up here. The service is always good and friendly staff.  I do like the option of lunch size portions.  This place just offers huge portions, that no regular human should be able to eat. I am sure I will be back and patiently wait 30 minutes to an hour to be seated for lunch. And YES of course I will have a gigantic slice of cheese cake! On top of two days worth of calories in one meal."
Robert Z.,"Salt Lake City, UT",46,22,,1.0,11/28/2012,"Horrible wait time, slow service time for food that's not that good. Don't eat the fish! My wife did and 2 hours later was violently ill with food poisoning! Management claims it was impossible, yet it happened. Lost wages cost us 4x what the meal did so definitely not worth it! Avoid this location above all others, we're not the only ones sickened by our experience there."
Codicho Z.,"Salt Lake City, UT",3,53,,4.0,7/22/2013,"Wish I could put 4.5 2/3 times great service. If I were manager I would tell someone to go home if they had a poor attitude.  Great that I know things are fresh because it seems they run out of everything I want.  I wanted the Mahi Mahi & they ran out two times in 1 week. Also they ran out of a cheesecake I wanted on the same night & no discount.  Dirty spoon, slow service, waitress forgot everything I asked for & I always had to ask her for water.  As opposed to Troy &  Lindsey who were very attentive."
Becky S.,"Seminole, FL",0,155,,4.0,3/23/2014,Had valentine's day brunch here. I was amazed how many people had left work early as the place was packed.  We were able to sit at a bar table after a shot wait.  WE ordered the tuna tataki salad and it came out fresh and delicious after about 40 minutes. Didn't mind the wait as we were wqtching the Olympics on TV and our server kept refilling our drinks promptly.
