Tiffany L.,"San Francisco, CA",224,423,7,4.0,5/19/2010,"I always love the cheesecake factory, every time and it never feels.  Its hard that a place like this can go wrong with its intense menu and fast service.  Even if the service is a bit below par, the managers always step in and make sure you are completely happy.  I'm surprised with the rating for this place for Utah considering it was insanely packed when I went on a late Friday.  We didn't want to wait so we sat at the bar which was perfect!  The bartenders are quick and super friendly.  We ordered off the small plate list which was a great deal and the portions were crazy (of course).  We had the corn fritters, the endive salad, a side of fries, and the strawberry shortcake.  The corn fritters were pretty big, the size of the balls (haha), and sweet tasting.  The endive salad I always order and it was perfect as usual.  Everything tasted great and I left completely happy!  Tip: Order off the small plate list because its a great deal for all the food you get and the variety is right too.  Also, if you hate waiting, never ever go here unless you want to sit at the bar."
Sam S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,17,3,4.0,9/8/2012,"Great food huge menu. A couple things I don't agree with however.....I hate trying to spread cold butter on bread and I would like my ""server"" to serve my food not some random guy from the kitchen. After all they are called servers not just order takers."
Antonio L.,"Anaheim, CA",553,552,825,5.0,10/9/2010,"Just gonna review on the cheesecake. I've only been here 2 times just to get a slice of cheesecake. First time I was here, it was the Red Velvet Cheesecake. Love it! Definitely would come back for this. Today, it was the Kalua Cocoa Coffee Cheesecake. OMG, another great slice of cheesecake. It was pretty rich though, especially the chocolate on top. Cheesecake Factory never seems to fail as a great dessert to end the evening!"
Kari M.,"Boise, ID",10,25,,2.0,6/29/2011,"This was the worst food/service I have ever gotten at a Cheesecake Factory!   The only thing that saves this from a 1 star review is that our crabcakes and our crab/artichoke dip were FABULOUS!  My ""seared"" ahi was dang near fully cooked.  They took it back politely and brought back a chinese chicken salad.  It was huge, but part of the huge-osity was the fried rice noodles that almost broke my teeth.   The cheesecake is always scrumptious, but for 7 bucks a slice, it should be."
Natalie R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",53,92,5,2.0,3/26/2012,"Ugh. Why? Why does the majority of this great state think CF is the cat's pajamas? The wait is always ridiculous, no matter what time of day or night you go. The decor is tacky- what is it even supposed to be emulating? The music is way, WAY too loud, making the noise level unbearable. You can't even have a conversation with your dinner companions without shouting. The menu is huge- it's in a spiral bound book peppered with advertisements. Am I the only person who thinks it's odd to sell ad space in a menu? As I was saying, the restaurant has an extensive menu and the food is pretty okay, but it's over-priced. The cheesecake is good- some are pretty over the top, some are more traditional and simple. The environment in this place is enough to keep me away. If I absolutely must have Cheesecake Factory, I think I'll just order takeout."
Dustin B.,"Salt Lake, UT",28,144,18,4.0,3/15/2010,"Like many others I've been avoiding this place under the assumption it was all hype.  I just figured that when people went the the Cheesecake Factory in Vegas and raved about it was because they were half drunk and high on the Vegas experience.  I was wrong, this place has really good food. My first misconception was that the hype was all about cheesecake and not food.  But one look over their humongous menu lets you know they aren't just a place for desert.  Seriously find the menu online, it's 20 pages long! I got the Steak Diane, steak medallions in a mushroom wine sauce, basically my favorite dish so I figured it's a good measuring stick for restaurants.  It was delicious, maybe a bit peppery but not much more than other places that advertise a black peppercorn Angus steak. The portions are huge, it's best to just plan ahead and divide the dish in half and eat the rest for lunch the next day.  Especially if you have desert, if you eat it all you will be over-stuffing yourself way beyond the safe comfort/health point.  During the long wait for a table you'll notice everybody walking out with huge bags of take-home leftovers. Speaking of the long wait.  I was there on a Thursday and waited 45 minutes; this is considered a short wait here.  You cannot reserve ahead of time so stop by, get your name down, and then try to find something to keep you occupied for the next hour or so. This is also an awful place to have a conversation, the noise level really is out of control.  You have to shout to be heard over the rest of the diners which just leads to an even louder restaurant.  Considering how many people are packed in it's not really surprising why this happens. The service is also average, the waiters and waitresses are working a full speed but there are just so many people to take care of that you'll only see them a couple times during the night.  They're friendly but don't expect them to be attentive to your every need while dining.  I prefer they stay out of my way anyway so this wasn't a big deal to me. Overall I don't plan on going back there unless it's on somebody else's whim.  It's not the food isn't great, I really liked it; it's just not the atmosphere I want in a dining experience.  Dinner is where you go to talk before or after doing something with family friends or loved ones.  Cheesecake Factory is like a loud, rowdy, communal dining experience.  The decor may be a bit fancier, but I don't feel like I'm spending intimate face to face time with people here."
Brad S.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",35,441,223,3.0,8/7/2012,"Yeah, my review of this location is pretty spot on.  The Cheesecake is great and the Chicken Madera is really good as well but to have a really good experience you need set your expectations a little lower."
Hunter S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,15,,4.0,10/10/2013,"the food was very very good, and the service was great as well.  It is quite noisy in there though if you're looking for a quiet place for dinner"
Freddy C.,"West Covina, CA",7,19,9,4.0,7/11/2012,"Josh our server was great kept or drinks coming and the food was on point, kept my kids happy"
Tori A.,"Sandy, UT",7,38,7,3.0,7/8/2012,"My parents love The Cheesecake Factory, so we go here more often than I would otherwise. Never had a bad experience, but never had anything that knocked my socks off.  It's always noisy, crowded and the service can be iffy. I've tried many of the cheesecakes and they are all very good and that's why you come there anyway!"
Paul T.,"American Fork, UT",5,10,1,2.0,7/4/2012,"On, my experience was terrible.  We didn't have to wait long to get seated, but then the wait began.  Our dinner took 1.5 hours for three appetizers and cheesecake.  We had three restaurant personnel drop by and apologize for the slowness.  Even the couple next to us was surprised that how long it took.  Oh, I forgot, one of the appetizers they brought out was wrong and had to be redone.  To top it off I was sick for two days following."
Avi D.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,11,,5.0,3/13/2013,Amazing place! Love the avocado egg rolls!!!! And the bread! Wow it was perfect!
Ili M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",17,72,18,2.0,8/14/2012,Food taste good but the aftermath was no good.  Can't handle it.  A bit expensive too for what you get.
Ryan R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",2,19,4,1.0,12/13/2010,"I didn't even get to eat at this location!  But the fact that you can't call ahead and put your name on the 90 minute waiting list is complete crap.  My wife and I frequented the Cheesecake Factory in Waikiki....HAWAII!  Surprisingly we would get in that location with no more than a 20 minute wait and the service was great! Unfortunately, for some reason they overshoot your wait time and under deliver at this location.  I would have had better luck getting seated by buying a plane ticket back to O'ahu before I ever got sat at this Salt Lake location."
Laura C.,"Sandy, UT",23,35,,3.0,3/6/2014,"This location is always very busy, and they should staff accordingly. The service is slower than all the other CF's I've been to, and I've been to quite a few as we've lived a lot of places and we travel a lot. The food is consistent and it is kept quite clean, but yeah, their service needs to be kicked up a notch."
Matt S.,"Seattle, WA",0,18,,4.0,4/18/2012,"Miso Salmon was great, as was the reeses cheesecake"
Faroe R.,"Draper, UT",10,2,,5.0,3/7/2012,"Always really busy, so put your name down and go shop. Favs are the Luau Salad, Chicken Madiera, Bang Bang Chicken, Chicken di Pana, and Orange Chicken."
Newman J.,"Cedar Hills, UT",1,18,,2.0,8/19/2012,"Very noisy. You can't have a conversation. I sat within arms length of another couple. No privacy. Packed like sardines. So don't go if you want a quiet night out. Cheesecake is amazing, I had chicken Alfredo and got sick. Won't be going back anytime soon, except to buy a cheesecake."
Erika S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",135,21,7,2.0,7/16/2013,"Huge over-salted and overpriced entrees that are lacking in flavor and creativity.  Their cheesecake is the only saving grace, the service is meh."
Craig N.,"Clearfield, UT",4,25,,5.0,7/20/2013,My wife and my favorite place to eat. So many choices and all done to near perfection. Not sure how they pull it off but glad they do. One of the few restaurant that we don't mind waiting an hour or two to get seated and it seems like others don't mind also. Not sure why so many seem to slam them with poor reviews. The lines and buzz  speak for themselves so if you have not tried it I would ignore the negative comments here and try it for your self. IT IS THAT AWSOME!
