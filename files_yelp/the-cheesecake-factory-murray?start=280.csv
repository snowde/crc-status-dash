Camille C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",50,30,,3.0,5/28/2011,"I have only been to the Cheesecake Factory like three times in my life... and each time I went, I swore I would never be back, but then I would try it again because so many people seem to like it, but not me, not until the 4th time I tried it.  I think anytime you have to wait in line for over an hour for food... well, you will always be disappointed, because after 45 minutes of standing in a crowded lobby being pushed by a zillion other people who are also waiting in line, well, you just get grumpy and really too annoyed to enjoy the food.   I was also annoyed on my previous visits, that after waiting in line for 90 minutes, I then had to then read through a menu that was about the size of a Harry Poter novel and attempt to choose something.  Fortunately for me, I have now found my perfect Cheesecake Factory companion who did all of the navigating and hard work for me, so I could just show up and enjoy the food.  He had been to the place dozens of times, and seemed to know just the right time to go so we wouldn't have to wait and just the right thing to order, so I really didn't even have to open that ridiculously obnoxious menu.  His recommendation was the Crispy Chicken Costoletta, and I must say, I am a fan.  It tasted much better than I expected it to and the portion was so large that I had enough for lunch the next day.  My favorite thing though was the small plate Endive Salad, it was delicious, and when I got home I searched the internet for a recipe for the dressing... but did not find it, so I will have to go back again, just for the salad.  We also ordered a piece of the Red Velvet Cheesecake, and it was good, but honestly, I could give or take the cheesecake, what I really cared about was that yummy Endive Salad.   Aside from the food, we also had one of the best waiters I have had in a really long time.  He was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and seemed to know what we needed before we had to say anything.  I wish I could remember his name, but he was great and we made sure to let the manager know how much we enjoyed his service.   Overall, I am giving The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars, I would go back there again, but only with my Cheesecake Factory Companion ..... because I don't think I would have had such a great experience without him.  So, 3 Stars to Cheesecake Factory and 5 Stars to the friend I went with!"
Isabelle S.,"West Jordan, UT",2,42,1,1.0,1/8/2014,"So I came here last week and after the experience I had I just felt like I needed to update my review. I went in on a Monday afternoon, 20 minute wait. It took 15-20 minutes for the waitress to even notice my mom and I to ask us what we would like to drink. When we told her we needed an extra minute to decide what to eat, she took 20 more minutes to come back and check if we were ready to order. I ended up getting the Teriyaki Chicken, it's my fave. It took 30 minutes for our food to come out. I started eating and couldn't help but notice that the rice was rock hard, the chicken tasted off, and there was hardly any sauce. It honestly tasted like it had been sitting around for a while. The restaurant was just really unorganized and nothing was going right. The couple next to us waited 45 minutes for their food. In their defense, the manager came over and offered to take my meal off the check. Overall, my mom and I spent 2 hours here. That's a little much for lunch on a Monday afternoon."
Abraham G.,"Provo, UT",3,58,,4.0,4/28/2013,"Great food, but as always you get what you pay for. Is there anything wrong with this place? Yes, there is just too much to choose from"
Jodi C.,"Filer, ID",7,71,13,4.0,7/23/2012,"The cheesecake is to die for! The rest of the food is good too. But the place is so loud and I feel so packed in, especially when I'm seated at a 2 person table. Everyone is on top of each other at those tables. And don't try to get in on a Friday nite or anytime Saturday because you're gonna have a very long wait!"
Max S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,69,7,2.0,12/21/2010,"Meh, what a great word to describe this place.   If McDonald's tried to get into ""fine dining"" this, is what it would be.   The food is greasy and bland."
H X.,"Draper, UT",0,69,12,3.0,5/28/2010,"After reading all the reviews about the wait, we ate dinner someplace else, and visited for dessert.  With the name focusing on Cheesecake, why not go just for dessert!   It was good!  I ordered the Godiva Sunday.  Rich and yummy!  Could have had one bit and been satisfied.  Paying $10 including tip for a bite of chocolate didn't make me too happy.  Great dessert, could have shared it with 4 people, it was that big!!!  Everyone on our table took home at least 1/2 of their dessert.(no one wanted to share.)  Didn't like the recomended LEMONCELLO CREAM TORTE too dry!!! Not enough strawberries.  The GODIVA CHOCOLATE BROWNIE SUNDAE is really good IF you like Chocolate, very rich and thick.  KAHLUA COCOA COFFEE CHEESECAKE is really good, heavy on the coffee flavor, but still really good!    Would suggest going for dessert around 7:45!  We didn't wait at all! Althought it was a Tuesday night! :)"
Grace C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,26,,4.0,4/2/2009,"As I said before, I am from the bay area (Northern California) At home i LOVE this restaurant. but the one in salt lake could stand to change. First of all. In general, there are wayy to many children in this state. This totally ruins the dining experience. This is not a family restaurant. (but i guess everything here is family) Take you and your five kids to denny's or whatever. please.  That aside, I do absolutely love the food here. The service is good and the atmosphere is nice. (on weekdays when the families aren't there) One main downside is that they don't take reservations and there's usually a long wait.  However, If i could, I'll just go home and eat at the cheesecake factory there. Save myself from the chaos and long waits at the one here. If you've never eaten here I recommend giving it a chance."
K J.,"Murray, UT",8,58,,2.0,7/31/2008,"First visit impressions: Like said before here - pretty much like other huge chain restaurants. Food is flavorful and handsomely prepared. Waiter was very nice and helpful in assisting us with our selections. Portions are indeed gigantic! I believe I witnessed EVERYONE leaving the restaurant with a bag. I was no exception, and I only ordered a salad. I was stuffed after eating only 1/2  the meal. It was good enough to think I might eat some more of it the next day. (More than 1/2 the folks I watched leave the place were packing around several dozen previous meals on their hips and waists.) I have to say too that the screaming kids were annoying and the wait time was ridiculous. The herding of patrons in the seating process is reminiscent of an attraction at Disney World. Our waiter said they hadn't switched over to the 1.5 oz. liquor metering yet so I opted out of the $7.50 Mojito. $7.50 is just WAY too much to pay for only 1 oz. of juice in a drink. After the meal I was too full for any desert. Our waiter told us you can buy some of the cheesecakes (all made in California and shipped frozen) at Costco for cheaper than you can get them at the restaurant. So, if you want to avoid the trough-feeding experience and just get a cheesecake it may be a good idea to try out Costco."
Eugene F.,"San Jose, CA",161,667,147,4.0,4/17/2008,"Admittedly, I avoid going to chain restaurants because I prefer to enjoy local, smaller places to eat. When i was at home this weekend, my mom said she really liked The Cheesecake Factory and wanted to have lunch there.  So, being the obedient son, I went with her.   They have these all over California, and I have never set foot in one.  The ambiance of the place is reminiscent of any large chain restaurant.  However, this one has really high ceilings giving it a really nice, open feel to it.  The one thing that I noted that was nice was that they had a partition that went from floor to ceiling (half of it being glass) that separated the kitchen from the dining area.  I thought that was really nice because often the kitchen area can get a bit loud.  I ordered the half turkey sandwich, salad, and soup lunch, and my mom got the miso glazed salmon.  The portions are really large here, so be prepared to come with your appetite like I did.  The soup was black bean and actually fairly tasty, the sandwich was on a baguette and really nice and crispy, and the salad had a nice vinaigrette on it.  I tasted my mom's salmon and the glaze was actually decent, but she found it a little bland and had to add some more salt and pepper.   Becky, our server, was good about checking up on us and gave me refills quickly.   Also, of note, there's a full bar here, too.  Not sure if you have to a membership, or not, but probably can just head in after a hard day of shopping at the mall.  ;-p Overall, a decent first-time visit to The Cheesecake Factory.  Would I return, probably not, but overall a decent experience."
Gerardo C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",25,74,17,3.0,12/21/2010,"I wasn't impressed with the food here. I had heard great things about this place, but think it is overpriced for the quality you get. I doubt I will eat here again."
Joshua S.,"Midvale, UT",2179,590,967,4.0,3/15/2010,"after numerous visits ambience A- frenetic, noisy and crowded, but it works. the decor is decent, if a bit too 'las vegas' for my taste. but, again, it works. service A up to this point, i've never had a bad server. accommodating, prompt, and polite. food B+ to tell you the truth, i did NOT want to like this restaurant, because of all the hype and trend. but they have pleasantly surprised me ALMOST every time i've visited. i walk away from the restaurant, take-away in hand, thinking, ""how did this happen again? dang."" thai lettuce wraps (satay chicken strips, carrots, bean sprouts, coconut curry noodles and lettuce leaves with three thai style sauces - peanut, sweet red chili and tamarind-cashew.) it's fresh. it's simple. it's always the same. and they let you assemble your own wraps. i believe in choice. thank you. avocado egg rolls (avocado, sun-dried tomato, red onion and cilantro fried in a crisp wrapper with a tamarind-cashew dipping sauce.) decent. not my favorite. probably because wanted lime and salt to make it pop.  firecracker salmon rolls (spiced fresh salmon rolled in spinach and fried in a crisp wrapper with a sweet hot chili sauce.)  decent. delicious, until the slight salmon aftertaste kicks in. not my favorite. but it's still delicious regardless.  pasta carbonara (spaghettini with smoked bacon, green peas, and a garlic-parmesan cream sauce) it's difficult to get carbonara wrong. i love the cheesecake factory's carbonara. the peas were fresh, and the sauce wasn't too thick and clingy. meaning, they had enough olive oil to loosen it up. (my secret hope is that the days of the table side cracking of the raw egg on the pasta returns.) stephanie's ultimate red velvet cheesecake (moist layers of red velvet cake and our original cheesecake covered with our special cheesecake factory cream cheese frosting) i can only handle cheesecake in very small doses. BUT, i CAN handle this cheesecake all by myself. the red velvet cake breaks up the monotony of cheesecake's richness and overbearing weight. i know, how can cake lessen the weight? trust me, it does. overall: A- a solid 4 stars. as far as i'm concerned, cheesecake factory is doing their job. churning out pretty good food, good service and a nice backdrop."
L V.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,31,,1.0,7/24/2011,"I was simply shocked at the terrible lack of cleanliness- we were seated at a table where the appetizer plates AND silverware were dirty ( I don't mean they had been used, somebody had rinsed them but clearly had not cleaned them). The menus were dirty (smudged, dirty fingerprints). I usually really like the cheesecake factory (though I've never been to this one before and never will again) but I had to just get up and go after the waiter told me it was ""no problem"" when I pointed the dirty dishes. No problem?!? Really ?!?"
Joseph K.,"South Jordan, UT",1,4,1,4.0,12/10/2010,My wife and I like to try a new cheesecake every time we come here. We especially like the Godiva cheesecake.
K M.,"Los Altos, CA",0,13,9,1.0,9/7/2013,"This location should be shut down, it's a disgrace to the brand.  Also, it's one of the worst restaurants I've been to, service-wise.  CCF was one my favorite restaurants to go to regularly in the Bay Area, for date night, to hang with the girls, for special occasions, or just because.  But THE first week I moved to Utah, I visited this location and I was so disappointed!  The service was HORRIBLE!  The waitress was slow, not friendly at all, and did not pay attention to us or the table next to us.  I was so mad, but the food was good, so I gave this place another chance and came back a month later.  Something is wrong with the waitresses they hire, they don't know that they work for a tip!  I always tip well and add extra if you're good, but if you don't deserve it, you don't get it.  I boycotted this location for the next month, but decided since the service sucked I would just do curbside take out.  The first time I got curbside, they told me 20 minutes, after 25 minutes my food still wasn't ready.  The waiter was apologetic about it, but I was still upset.  The second time I ordered curbside, the same thing happened!  After 30 minutes still no food, I asked the waitress nicely why did it take so long.  She had the nerve to have an attitude with me, no apology, just snapped at me saying something about the kitchen.  I yelled back at her and told her she needs to get some customer service training and a new job, and left no tip of course.  Since then, I have not been back to my once favorite and frequently visited restaurant.  I wrote corporate about closing this location and the bad experiences I've had or possibly getting new management or retraining the staff on customer service, but I have yet to get a response.  Do NOT eat at this location, once I get over it, I probably try downtown Salt Lake City, maybe.  Hopefully their service is better than this stupid restaurant's."
Carla A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",26,13,38,1.0,6/17/2013,"""Fathers Day Brunch Blunder""  Stay clear of breakfast. Epic failure on the kitchen staffs part. Our food came out 45 minutes after we ordered, our food was cold under cooked and hard. I ordered French toast, to my surprise it came out soggy and un cooked dripping with egg all over the plate seeping from the bread. The potatoes that came with breakfast were hard, over cooked and cold. The eggs that came with the steak and eggs were all cold and rubbery. We sent back our food and ordered a bagel salmon platter, we thought that this would take a couple of minutes instead it took another 20 minutes. We cancelled the platter and then finally the manager came by and offered us free dessert, which we turned down and told him it was ok we just wanted him to be aware of the problem. We then had to wait again for 20 minutes for our bill. The server was awesome and should not be blamed for the kitchens epic failure or the management's. STAY CLEAR OF THE MURRAY LOCATION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Virgo M.,"Bay Area, CA",221,767,81,5.0,8/1/2009,The 30th anniversary Triple Chocolate Cheesecake is a lil slice of life and love.
Todd B.,"West Jordan, UT",0,6,,3.0,5/16/2013,"The food was good, but the service was not what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Our entree's made it to the table before our appetizers."
Michelle E.,"Issaquah, WA",60,50,26,2.0,1/8/2008,"Okay, it's the same menu as any other Cheesecake Factory so... yay.  (Me likey.)  But there are 2 things seriously wrong with this Cheesecake Factory:  1) Be prepared to wait way over an hour.  2) There's no bar in the bar (!) and the bar area is assigned seating.  (So what's the point of having a bar?!) I won't go back for a very long time.... or unless I need to eat at 3 O'clock in the afternoon. If you do go, though, I suggest the guacamole.  YUMMERS!!!!!"
Anne-Claire C.,"Logan, UT",7,10,3,3.0,8/19/2010,"The service was pretty good. They for sure serve you a ton of food, just a heads up don't order too much! By the time we got to dessert our stomach was stuffed! And we couldn't fit the best part.. the cheesecake. I do recommend the red velvet that one is delicious. Dessert is definitely better than the actual food though."
Sarah B.,"Murray, UT",9,37,,4.0,2/9/2009,"Yet another difficult one to rate: I opted to be positive and go with 4 stars.  Let's break this down shall we? Bad news first: Bad:  Ok, so I was tempted to only give it 1 star based on the choice of background music alone.  At times it sounded like we were on an episode of Love Boat and at others, in a porno in Vegas.  It was horrible.  Luckily I went on a Sunday so there was no wait.  Every other time I've attempted to eat there I gave up because the wait was over an hour.  Seriously Utahns, it's great but no restaurant is worth waiting an hour.  Call me impatient...  Basically the overall feel of the place was that it was trying to be something it was not.  The attempt was made for it to be a classy restaurant (building style, food, bar, etc) but it can't hide the fact that it is a family friendly chain restaurant.  Not necessarily a bad thing, if that's where you want to go. Now for the good part! The reasons why I'll go there again. Good:  The food is surprisingly tasty and is nicely presented.  The artichoke appetizer was probably one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten.  Obviously the cheesecake is phenomenal and I definitely recommend the Chai Latte!  The service was great and even though the guy was a little creepy (the fact that I was sitting and he was standing and he looked directly into my eyes way too often possibly could have contributed to my uneasiness), we tipped him generously because he was very nice and very good at his job.  The menu is ridiculously long and there are a lot of choices.  Basically everyone could find something they like here.  The building is decorated nicely and the seats are comfortable, although the windows face the ugly parking lot which leaves something to be desired in the view.  I enjoyed myself thoroughly and I liked the food, so therefore I give it 4 stars."
