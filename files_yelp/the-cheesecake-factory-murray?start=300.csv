Jason F.,"Holladay, UT",46,235,119,4.0,4/15/2009,"Food is as good as the others in the chain which is a plus. The mood is ruined by the throngs of children running around and screaming. Usually a long wait on weekends except Sunday. Whoever selected the music should be fired. Our waiter was very nice and actually pointed out the music to us which was a little odd. Our experience overall was fun and the food was good. Portion size is very large, be sure to take that into account when order appetizers and desert."
Tell Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,103,,1.0,6/28/2008,"When you're with the family, you got to do the family thing.  I don't know what I am mortified by more: The screaming babies and mess-making toddlers at every table or hearing an easy listening cover of Depeche Mode's Enjoy the Silence sung by an unknown female vocalist. Everyone's meal looked appetizing, but the servings were gargantuan. All dishes where good for two people. It is sad if the huge portions are a selling feature. These people are just as responsible as McDonald's for obesity. Even if patrons don't eat their whole portion, it is a lot of waste. I can't help but think if portions where smaller, 1) prices could be lower, 2) profits could be higher, 3) waste would be lower. G and I each ordered a salad--we could have ordered one and shared it with some left over. I liked my beet/spinach/goat cheese/and other things salad but... I lost my appetite just a few bites into my salad when I heard the Depeche Mode cover."

David K.,"San Francisco, CA",49,18,,1.0,7/19/2009,"Cheesecake factory is nothing but pure disappointment.  Over the past three years, I've been to three different Cheesecake Factories around Colorado and Utah.  Every time my food and my wife's food has been gross, period.  Here's some examples: sticky and hard pasta that was way overcooked and raw (and not in a good way) tuna.  I'm not sure what the appeal of this overpriced chain is, but after our last visit we said never ever again."
Hola M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,1,,2.0,4/23/2012,"I've had prior experiences with parties for 2-4 without reservations and been sat within 30 minutes without any problems. However, we had a large group this past Saturday and had made reservations for our party of 18. We called three hours prior to our arrival time and added 4 people to our original party so 22. They said that it would be an hour longer wait time. We said fine and told everyone we would be sat at 7:30 PM instead of 6:30 PM. We all arrived by 7:00 PM. We did not get sat down until 9:00 PM, despite our reservation and confirmation!! Worst service, they did not apologize, they did not offer any explanation, just said that the other party prior to us had not left yet, then what would they have done had we had our original plan. The food is good, the cheesecake is okay. The service at the host stand is awful. The ladies look like they would rather be somewhere else. They are not helpful.  So, the moral is, if you have a 2-4 top, you'll be fine, but don't EVER plan a family or work celebration because they are not equipped to handle it."
Jason K.,"Collierville, TN",57,281,1,4.0,12/13/2009,"Yes, it is a national chain, and yes, there is always a long line...this location is no different than others around the country. I marvel at how much money this place must rake in. However, at the same time, we always enjoy our visits here, that is, when our blood pressures can take battling all the other hungry customers. Service is very friendly, but ultimately you do feel that they are trying to move you along so they can seat the next customers. The food is the main attraction, or rather, the voluminous quantity of it. Prices are not cheap, but the selection is huge and they do most choices quite well. Usually, we are not able to save enough room for desert, but sometimes we splurge and take a slice of their wonderful cheesecake home."
