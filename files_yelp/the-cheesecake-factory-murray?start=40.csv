Becca P.,"Herriman, UT",2,14,2,2.0,12/16/2017,"Decent food, but SO overpriced. I'd rather spend this kind of money at a fancy, nicer restaurant. The cheesecake is good, but the price for everything else is still ridiculous."
James D.,"Herriman, UT",59,71,2,4.0,7/1/2017,"Solid experience overall. Wait time is awful, but that's pretty status quo for the area on a Saturday. We tried a new appetizer, some truffle oil bacon cheese sticks and they were great. She got the salmon+shrimp and seemed to love it, I got an Italian combination plate and it was decent but nothing out of this world. Speaking of out of this world, the cheesecake was divine, as always. Will definitely return, albeit on a night where we're not in a hurry."
Carissa F.,"Anaheim, CA",151,31,50,4.0,7/8/2017,"Our food hear is always yummy, I had the vegan conn salad and it is one of the best salads ever!!! It is healthy and tastes wonderful! Healthy or not I am will be getting a cheese cake! Stilling trying to decide!"
Suleiman K.,"Sandy, UT",0,31,4,1.0,9/16/2017,"Food is cold, service is horrible!! Today they told me my food will take 20-25 min, it took more than 45 min and it was cold!!! Tooo cold!! I ate cold fish and ship,!"
Mike H.,"Austin, TX",190,64,189,4.0,12/6/2016,"I love this place. I don't even like cheesecake but the food here is awesome. The menu is huge and all the food is great. My favorite appetizers are the Stuffed Mushrooms, Avocado Eggrolls, and the Factory Nachos. I love the pasta, the burgers and the steaks. The milkshakes are delicious as are the lemonades. My wife loves their Oreo cheesecake."
Steve K.,"Draper, UT",0,64,57,2.0,5/8/2017,You can find better foods in the fashion place food court. First time the entire family left more than half of our food unfinished. They also forgot our appetizer. My daughter had  only 1 or 2 bites of her spaghetti and meat balls ( her favorite choice of food) and tossed it on the side.
Garth S.,"Holladay, Salt Lake City, UT",31,12,2,3.0,7/8/2017,"Super great food and reasonably priced for the serving size. I tasted all four meals and all were flavorful and well presented.  The reason there is a 50 minute wait is because the service is so slow they can't get the tables turned. I wasn't in a rush and it was ok that it took 90 minutes though, that's a long time for a restaurant experience."
Jenny G.,"Pleasant Grove, UT",638,103,278,5.0,4/12/2017,"I always love eating at the Cheesecake Factory. I love their huge menu and massive portions. I just don't love all the calories, fats, and carbs that go with them. However, when it's date night anything goes. I'm especially fond of their Steak Diane, Chicken Madera, their Chopped Salad, and their Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake. But I could totally go on. I've never had anything I didn't like."
Annie D.,"West Jordan, UT",46,14,6,4.0,3/17/2017,"I went here on a Tuesday, around 3. It wasn't busy, but we still had to wait a few minutes to be seated which isn't a big deal at all. The first thing I notice is the absolutely beautiful interior it's super spacious and I love the display cases of the cheesecake by the door where you can get some to take home.  After I was seated, i took a look at the menu and, boy oh boy, is it huge. You definitely get a lot of options from orange chicken to steak. The cheesecake list is super impressive.  Now the portion sizes are large. I knew this place was a tad bit pricier than average but after seeing the portions, it makes sense and is reasonable. I ordered the Bang Bang Chicken and Shrimp. Seriously, it was the best meal I've had in ages. Rice was cooked perfectly, the chicken and shrimp were so flavorful, and the coconut bits were a perfect touch.  The cheesecake. Honestly. Best thing ever. I have no words. I had the Toasted Marshmallow S'mores Cheesecake, would definitely recommend.  My only gripe is the service. It took us forever to get water, and then it took even longer for him to come back for our order. Seems he was switching shifts and just left mid way. A waitress took out our food very quickly and my next waiter was absolutely amazing. So it all depends.  Either way. I'll be back for sure!"
Tyler M.,"Provo, UT",72,27,10,1.0,8/4/2017,Don't get the mashed potatoes. They don't clean the potatoes properly and the last 3 times I've gotten the potatoes there was sand in them. This most recent time I took the potatoes home and ate them there and chipped a tooth. So just stay away from the potatoes and you get to keep your teeth.
Leah B.,"Las Vegas, NV",34,625,82,5.0,5/2/2017,The place was super busy for on a Tuesday night. Had to sit up in the bar area or else it was going to be a 30 minute wait for a table. The drinks and food were delicious. Service was good too. No complaints. A+
Ratestuff J.,"Portland, OR",7,158,25,1.0,2/28/2017,"Bring your own flashlight ask to be sat by a window that is lucky enough to have Mall Parking lot light shining in, because unlike EVERY OTHER  CHEESECAKE FACTORY, the Murray Stores inept Manager forces the staff to keep the lighting at or below candle light levels.   Good luck reading the menu or seeing what you are actually eating. Our waiter tells us they get 50 complaints or more every night. I say, ""fire the damn management  and get a clue Murray store!"""
Justin D.,"Magna, UT",14,51,31,4.0,3/2/2017,Good food big portions. Don't miss the fried macaroni and cheese. It is easily the best thing on the menu. The tai lettuce wraps are a great second choice. If your feeling like chicken the chicken costaletta or the chicken belagio are very good. The nice thing about this place is that they have a huge menu. You can get almost anything. The down side is the noise level and the menu is so big that you can look through it and by the time you get to the end you've forgotten what you chose to eat. The tuxedo cheesecake is my favorite but you really can't go wrong.
Howard M.,"Sandy, UT",137,136,1358,3.0,1/3/2016,"New Year's weekend is over now, so you know that can't be their excuse. We dine here often, so this must be an isolated issue. The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded today, besides that they can handle huge crowds at cheesecake factory.  So here are my observations: 1.  Service was slow. It took an unusually long time before we got our main course and again a long time before we got our dessert. It even took a long time to get the bill. 2.  They were out of the desert we ordered, they offered substitutions, we accepted a substitution; however, they made no concessions in terms of a discount on our dessert or on our meal. 3.  At The server's suggestion, we ordered the dinner special and found the portion to be much smaller than the usual main course portions. As I've mentioned in prior reviews, their portions are typically big enough for two people to split. I'm sure we'll give the cheesecake factory another try because the food is consistently good, but we're not heading over there for dinner anytime soon. Salute!"
Valencia V.,"Ogden, UT",23,1,,5.0,2/19/2017,"I ""talked"" everyone into coming here for a birthday celebration amongst other places because I wanted it to be special (someplace they have never been before). First of all we were given a 35 minute but it turned into maybe a 10 minute wait . Our meals were delicious! The cre'me de la cre'me was our waitress Michelle; not only did she make the night wonderful BUT she took the EXTRA time to understand what I wanted and how I wanted it. Losing my voice 2 weeks ago has been so frustating, bursting into to tears, stuggling to communicate, at times dealing with people who become agitated trying to figure out what I am try to say but Michelle my girl you were the best and I hope the management reads this and recognize you as I have.  Kudos To Guys"
Ivory E.,"Salt Lake City, UT",58,5,,5.0,6/9/2017,"The food is the best! Especially the lemon sauce on the herb crusted salmon. Seriously amazing!!! I don't love the hour wait, but my family has accepted that going there means waiting and we always plan for it. Also, there is not much privacy. Try asking for a booth. You wait longer, but it's worth it."
Ryan P.,"South Jordan, UT",9,70,28,4.0,8/25/2017,"Came here on a Saturday about 3:00pm, took 2 hours to finally get seated, I guess that comes with the territory when you eat at the Cheesecake Factory! The food, like always, was in point and for the quality and amount of food you get is really good, I will def come back but probably only for certain occasions due to the long wait time almost all the time."
Joe D.,"Sandy, UT",2,25,6,5.0,5/27/2017,Great food and great portions sizes. Our family comes here all the time. My wife gets the red velvet cheesecake and she loves it
Blaze T.,"Orem, UT",5,105,20,2.0,6/23/2017,"Really disappointed with our experience tonight. I've always enjoyed Cheesecake Factory, but after tonight's experience I don't think I'll be in a hurry to be back. It was really busy, so I'm not that put off by the long wait times in between drinks, appetizers, entrees... but the service just seemed extremely forced, and I'm not sure if it's based on location, but we never got our usual bread and butter WHICH I LOVE! The bread is a huge reason I keep coming back, and by the time we got the waiter around to ask about the bread our food was out and I didn't feel like being more of nuisance"
Rosalyn P.,"Salt Lake City, UT",23,6,1,2.0,1/2/2017,"So... went there to celebrate... the wait was expected. We were seated right next to where the waiters put in the orders.  Problem 1- one waiter smelled like some serious herbbage.  Problem 2- the table felt like it was meant to be pushed together with the couple who sat next to us (spacious table), which made our table way too small for two people. Problem 3- my card wouldn't ""authorize"". It didn't decline. I tried it that morning and later on that evening. So it wasn't my card. They just brushed it off as my problem, when it was their machine. We were lucky we had the cash between us. Tips. Take cash! Their machine might not work, and then you're stuck with a $60 bill for a very greasy meal.  Avacado egg rolls saved you this time."
