Page H.,"Tampa, FL",39,76,103,5.0,8/31/2016,"Came here for lunch to celebrate my birthday! I have been here many times over the years and they have consistently been good!  We always start with Tex mex egg rolls or Buffalo blasts. Both are excellent choices. Chicken Bellagio is probably my favorite dish on the menu but you always have to request extra Parmesan cream sauce because it can be rather dry.  Cheesecake, cheesecake, oh cheesecake!  So many wonderful choices! My favorite is the 30th Anniversary cheesecake. Yum! Yum!"
Nichole A.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",541,149,560,2.0,4/6/2016,"Hmmm....my recent visit to the Murray cheesecake factory, was not exactly amazing.  Pros: Large portions, amazing cheesecake and clean restrooms. Cons: High prices, bad service and long wait times. I am a huge fan of the cheesecake factory chains. Mostly because of the red velvet cheesecake. We arrived this evening around 10 pm (one of the few choices open at 10 pm for a full service meal). There was a 10 minute wait (which we found odd since it was 10 pm and there was no one in the lobby). Once we were seated, we waited 15 min to place our drink order. Our waiter ""forgot"" to bring out bread until after our appetizer was delivered to our table.  We ordered: Pot stickers: Piping hot, crispy and seasoned to perfection! The sauce was addicting! I kept dipping my bread in the sauce. I would definitely order this again. The only con- they only give you 6 small dumplings. So, for the price of $10.95....you are paying for quality not quantity.  Chicken Madeira: This dish was so disappointing! Ice cold, lacking in flavor, gluey cheese and overcooked asparagus!  Disclaimer: We have ordered this dish before at another location and it was wonderful.  We complained to our waiter and expressed our concerns about the dish. He acted annoyed and told us he would get a manager and have it remade. The manager brought out the remake and seemed annoyed with us. She did not even apologize for the mistake. If you are going to pay $18+ for chicken, it should at least be hot! The new one had been microwaved for a few minutes (rubbery!). We basically filled up on bread and pot stickers and took our dessert to go.  BTW: We paid full price for everything, even though they took 25 minutes to replace a messed up item.  Lemon raspberry cheesecake: Out of all of the desserts I have tried at cheesecake factory, this one is by far the sweetest (tastes like pure sugar). I would not get this item again.  Craigs crazy carrot cake cheesecake: Very tasty and not too sweet! This carrot cake had a subtle sweetness and was moist!  Overall I wouldn't come back to this location. I was not impressed with the way they handled a complaint and the cold/overpriced food. If you have a hankering for cheesecake factory, hit the one in city creek downtown! Fin'"
Suly G.,"Salt Lake City, UT",15,5,,2.0,7/2/2017,Two stars only because I really enjoyed the cheesecake. I went with a friend at around 9p & our 1st server was excellent. Then she left & the 2nd server who was supposed to take care of us never bothered to check up. She was dancing around & flirting w the male servers & cooks but not ONCE came to ask if we needed refills or wanted anything else which we did! We stayed till midnight & couldn't get anyone to bring us takeout boxes. We asked for some twice till we finally got them. The service was beyond poor.
Chuck S.,"Logan, UT",35,87,109,5.0,1/21/2017,"I know the wait can be unnerving but they're popular for a reason. So we went on a Saturday morning at 11:00 and still there was about 20 of us coming in the door. The service was excellent with a waiter named Steve. He brought extra Madeira sauce for the chicken Madeira not asked for but definitely appreciated. Extra anything we wanted was brought and anticipated. The lettuce wraps are just the best anyone's ever made. The banana cream cheesecake with hot fudge sauce on the side is uniquely phenomenal. The Chinese chicken salad is fantastic. All entrees can easily be shared. This place just does unique and delicious and presentation as good as any upscale restaurant without the upscale costs and much better volume! There is a reason there is a crowd, just go on off peak demand hours."
Drew R.,"South Salt Lake, UT",64,378,897,3.0,6/1/2015,"This place if you haven't been here is a restaurant mostly famous for their different variety of cheesecakes. Even though their cheesecakes are wonderful their food here also if very good. The only problem with this place is that during the weekend the wait time is super long ESP if you have a large party of 6 or more.  Their food menu has a little bit of everything. They go from asian to southern food. I would recommend the gumbo or the mediera chicken. Those in my opinion are the best. This time I thought I would switch it up a bit and got the lemon herb chicken. It was good, and very flavorful, the only problem with it is that the lemon flavor over powers everything on it. Even my carrots and mash potatoes started to taste like lemon after a while. **disclaimer** the portion size here is huge...so if you are not a big eater and want dessert I would recommend eating half on your plate and then order cheesecake. All in all this place is great. The servers are friendly, the food choices are huge, and their cheesecake is delicious."
Nikki M.,"Riverton, Salt Lake City, UT",39,96,43,4.0,12/21/2016,"If you're ok waiting for a table for an hour then this is the place for you! Other than long wait times, the food is amazing and so is the service. Portion sizes are huge and I've never been disappointed with anything. The sweet corn cakes are my favorite as well as the cheesecake."
Amanda R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",8,18,12,3.0,2/16/2017,"The floor is always such a slippery hazard. I don't know if this is because of oil spilled or what they are polishing it with, but it's scary. The waiters were very nice and the food was great. The hostess at the front desk was snotty  and didn't listen nor care to try. Wait time on a holiday is 2.5 hours. So...last time I'll do that. If the range of the buzzer was farther it wouldn't be as much of a problem. I have always liked the entrees here.  I don't care much for cheesecake though. The Dallas location was more open and less crazy busy feeling. Maybe we need more locations in Utah."
Chyryry ..,"American Fork, UT",49,60,130,3.0,1/5/2017,"Love the food as always, portions are large and it's always cooked well. This visit, we waited and waited and waited for our food to come out. It's a Wednesday you wouldn't think that it would be like an hour for our food. Anyway, nothing but love for this place!"
Travis B.,"Ogden, UT",101,391,201,3.0,2/24/2016,"I have a theory. If your menu is large enough to sell ad space in it, and large enough to confuse with the King James version of the Bible, it's too darned big. For me, it tends to frustrate as too many choices confuse what I may or may not be hungry for. C.F. seems to be a favorite in the Salt Lake valley and there is rarely a night without a bit of a wait. That's saying something since this place is huge. The food is usually pretty good. Not great, not bad. Pretty good. I like that it is reliably good and you're going to have a decent meal no matter what you order. Pricing is in line and you aren't going to break the bank feeding a family here."
Tina S.,"Salt Lake City, UT",70,246,46,4.0,3/30/2015,"Boy do I love Cheesecake! I don't always like their menu, but their stuffed mushrooms and pasta are really great! And the cheesecake, oh the cheesecake! I love their cheesecake. Since we visited on Valentine's weekend, we just got some cheesecake to go with a gift card I had to spend, and ate the cheesecake the next day after our homemade dinner, totally holds up!  We also came here on our Wedding Anniversary and had great service! I enjoyed the Pasta with Chicken and Scampi sauce! Our waitress was very nice and very quick with refills and made sure to check in with us without being a pest. The tables are a bit too close together for our comfort, and we basically had to wait for the chatty girls next to us to leave before we could enjoy our own conversation, because they were very loud, and since the tables are so close together we couldn't enjoy our conversation, but their was quite interesting, I wonder if the one girl was ever able to get her boyfriend to propose LOL"
Chandler S.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",55,15,16,5.0,4/16/2016,I simply love going to this place. They have a large and varied menu that has something for everyone. The service was great and we were seated by the window under a beautiful decorative chandelier. I had the bang bang chicken and shrimp and my wife ordered the fresh grilled salmon. Both dishes looked and tasted great. I can also recommend the chicken bellagio and chicken Madeira from previous visits.  No visit to the Cheesecake Factory would be complete without saving room for cheesecake dessert. I love the fresh strawberry. The only complaint is that if you guy during a normal eating hour you will most likely need to plan for a lengthy wait. We've run into this problem enough times that we usually try to go at times that wouldn't be as busy like an earlier afternoon time.
Rebecca L.,"American Fork, UT",32,65,38,5.0,12/31/2016,"We have only been to this location once. The server we had was amazing! She was very attentive even though she was obviously very busy. My only complaint was the wait at an early dine time and really no place to wait in the cold snowy evening of Utah. The wait area was part of ""to go"" area for cheesecake. The food was wonderful, well prepared, and they have an extensive menu with many choices for the family."
Anna N.,"Carson, CA",695,256,1510,3.0,4/24/2016,"The biggest negative for me is that they will not take reservations. The entire group has to be there to be seated.  As for the food, the Chicken Marsala is amazing."
Yen L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,22,41,5.0,6/5/2016,"So thankful that since I'm pregnant, I can digest lactose again (hope I don't have to go back to dairy jail after delivery). Of course, cheesecake is on my list of must haves while I take advantage of eating dairy.  Haven't been here in a while and it is as good as I remember. Guess I'll start with first things first before getting to dessert. I love the complimentary rye bread (the sour dough is ok). Our favorite appetizer is the portabella, avocado, and zucchini fries- resembles vegetable tempura. Calamari & Thai Lettuce Wraps are also good. Think the avocado egg rolls are overrated though. My go to entree is the Luau Salad; THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL SALAD. Between 2 or 3 layers of over-sized wonton squares sit chicken breast, mixed greens, pineapples, cucumbers, bell peppers, carrots, green beans, nuts, and more, all dressed in tasty house vinaigrette. Such a delicious combination and it's eye appealing. Now the dessert... I like the cheesecakes with different layers and different textures so my favorite at the moment is the Oreo cheesecake.  They are always busy and weekend dinner times = ridiculous wait times. Despite long waits to get a table, food arrives relatively fast."
Richard G.,"Highland, UT",0,15,,3.0,6/11/2017,"The food I got was great, mac and cheese burger, wife got Belagio chicken and that was great, daughter got shrimp scampi and that was not good. She ate a shrimp and then wanted my wife's food, my wife took the shrimp and had one and said it wasn't good. I of course already finished my burger and always will finish theirs. So I took the plate and had one shrimp then did not eat anymore. The shrimp was way over cooked and dried out. Didn't even have a good flavor. I didn't bother telling the waitress. We won't get the shrimp there again. 1:30 pm 6-11-17"
Mary Lou B.,"Sandy, UT",0,21,,1.0,6/26/2017,"What has happened to the Murray, Utah Cheesecake Factory?  The front line people that meet, greet and seat customers need a crash course in manners and need to be taught to be polite.  There is a true lack of customer service in this restaurant!  Not too sure we will go back"
Jennifer J.,"Draper, UT",145,121,257,2.0,4/9/2015,"We don't typically eat at The Cheesecake Factory; I still remember when it first opened how long the wait times were. But yesterday night, my husband suggested we go there, and I thought it would be a nice change from Olive Garden or McGrath's, where we normally go. They were a bit disorganized with seating people. Rather than using a paging system, the host and hostesses would yell out the name and number of people in a party. They heard me wrong when I gave our last name and said party of three. They were calling our name, but for two, and it took a few extra minutes for them to sort that out. The host was apologetic and friendly, though. It wasn't a big deal, but having worked in a restaurant before, I know that something like that would probably set off a different type of personality and the restaurant workers would get yelled at. Our waitress was Jen, and while she was nice enough, I'm fairly good at reading people. She seemed annoyed, and I'm not sure if it was with us or if she just didn't want to be there at all that night. We all have those days, I know. I ordered the fish and chips with the sweet potato fries and she gave me a ""you're kinda stupid"" look when I asked if there was any other sauce besides ketchup for the sweet potato fries. My options were ketchup and fry sauce. I asked for fry sauce, but I wonder if there are other sauces she could have recommended. Most places have something sweet to go with it, or something with a kick. Either one of those would have complemented the fries better. When it came time to get the check, she gave us another table's check that didn't even closely resemble what we'd ordered. When she dropped the check, that was pretty much the only time we got a huge smile out of her, as well as a ""it was my pleasure serving you tonight"" (which, sorry to say, didn't feel genuine at all.) I had to catch her while she was walking by, or it might have taken us another fifteen to twenty minutes to get the correct check. She wasn't apologetic about giving us the wrong check, and didn't even seem surprised that she had.  I'm sure I'll eat here again, but I'm a bit put off by how pushy the servers are with cheesecake--if you don't want to eat it there, then they try to push you to order it to go--and the lukewarm service we received from the server. I also wish she'd been thoughtful enough to include a container of tartar sauce for my leftover fish and chips. They are going to taste plain without it, as well as soggy, because she also included the coleslaw and only separated that from the rest of my leftovers with a thin piece of paper."
Melissa D.,"Provo, UT",68,4,,4.0,5/23/2017,"My husband and I went for on a Thursday for lunch and the service was AMAZING! We felt truly valued as customers. Even though we had a newly hired waiter on his first shift, he did an amazing job of making sure we were comfortable and that the food was to our liking. He was extremely knowledgable of the menu items and gave good recommendations. There were a few hiccups with getting menus but they quickly fixed the problems. My husband's hamburger was absolutely to die for and the chicken thai curry I had had just the right amount of sweetness and spiciness. The chicken was so tender! We had a wonderful experience here and will definitely be coming back to this location!"
The R.,"Boise, ID",0,37,6,4.0,4/28/2017,My family and I love this place! We always have great service and great food. The only downfall is there is normally at least a 30 minute wait most of the time more then that. But atleast it's in the mall so you can do some shopping while you wait.
Jessica A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,2,,2.0,3/11/2017,"This was my first time ever eating here and I had a gift card. I would not have stopped by without it and honestly will not be back. First impressions: way to dark!! Bring a flashlight with you. Music way to loud, you'll be yelling just to have a conversation. Decor is weird, not very inviting. The tables are really close together!! Not only did I have to yell at the person sitting across from me, I also had the privilege of hearing 3 other conversations of the tables around me since we were pretty much sitting on top of each other.  The staff was pretty rude right from the start. The girls who take your name down were so condescending. We waited almost 15 mins for even a ""hello, would you like some water?"" from our waiter. Menu is way too big!! Maybe it's just me and I believe in the beauty of simple, no nonsense, good eating.  Food is pretty medicore. My husband ordered fries with his hamburger, and the waiter forgot them. When we informed he, he seemed like he didn't care. It took 20 mins after he got his hamburger to get them. I had the carbonara. I have had much better for a better price.  I think the waiter only checked on us once after the fries and that was to ask if we wanted to order dessert! We had run out of water.  The only good thing was the cheesecake!! I would order that again!! But next time, I will just pick it up and go home!  All in all, bad service, bad atomsphere, and really over priced mediocre food."
