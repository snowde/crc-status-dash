Devin E.,"Provo, UT",128,49,25,3.0,8/4/2016,Great cheesecake with an average meal.
Christine L.,"Flagstaff, AZ",191,65,25,4.0,4/25/2017,"Delicious cheesecake and I loved it. But it was more like the service I wasn't completely satisfied. Front desk or the cashier guy looks like he wasn't happy or smiling. Other than that, great location, nice and clean, great food! Just the service wasn't over all nice but it's okay."
Ben P.,"Orem, UT",0,15,3,3.0,5/7/2017,Only gets 3 stars because of the Cheesecake. Otherwise it would probably get two stars.   Very average steak.  Fish tacos were ok.  Meatloaf almost made it redeeming.  Not what it used to be.
Chase H.,"Draper, UT",10,51,8,1.0,1/11/2017,Not so great not sure what all the hype is about? They are always super busy though. Went in had the philly was sub par as the service was. I probably won't return but the place as far as cleanliness and nice looking goes is all there.
Traci M.,"Addison, TX",53,3,7,5.0,11/15/2016,Most amazing restaurant and staff. Never fail to deliver a dining experience with excellent food and dessert.
Maggie L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",43,243,618,3.0,3/5/2016,"Food and service by Tracy/Tracie was excellent!  Our table...nnnnnnot so much. The restaurant is really dark,  too dark IMO. Our table was on the southwest side by the window.  We had dinner under a glaring parking lot light....how romantic. Every minute or so we'd get a shot of headlights in our eyes. HIDs are great when you're driving, but suck when you're eating a hibachi steak."
Nats L.,"Orem, UT",0,5,3,5.0,4/24/2017,Delicious every time with good service and usually not an incredibly long wait. I've been to this location several times and it never disappoints. Generally I take cheesecake to go if I actually eat dinner there because their portions are gigantic. I also tend to bring home a doggie bag. I definitely recommend it!
Kepler R.,"Rexburg, ID",3,4,,4.0,3/31/2017,Their portion sizes are huge! But if you ever go on a weekend evening prepare for a wait that is more than likely over an hour! The biggest down side is the long wait every evening. And they got rid of the apple streusel cheesecake :(
Celina P.,"Carlisle, PA",5,13,9,3.0,2/18/2017,"I had a horrible experience (read prior) but have since been contacted by the manager and received a gift card as an apology which I highly appreciate. I will leave this at 3 stars for now as I appreciate any company that tried to make amends, and will try again soon and post my experience. Thank you Cheesecake Factory for taking the proper steps thus far."
Curtis C.,"Lehi, UT",162,429,81,2.0,9/8/2015,"Another friends birthday, another visit to the Cheesecake Factory, another disappointment.  This time I went with a Mac and cheese burger, fries, and a side of both the buffalo sauce and chipotle mayo. We were in a group of 11, so of course it took a while. While waiting for food I had a hibiscus lemonade that was actually really good. It was $5, but with unlimited refills and the option to switch it for raspberry or strawberry I found it worth it. The food eventually made its way out and I began the meal. The burger was okay, but I've had much better Mac & Cheese Burgers for less money and less of a wait. The real reason I have to ding this place down to two stars is the fries. When I'm paying ~$25 after tip for a lemonade, burger and fries, every element of the meal better be excellent. The lemonade passed, I'll let the burger slip by with a pass, but the fries...the fries...the first thought when eating them was wonder at how old they must have been. I ate a few, from the top, then the middle, and then the bottom, all in hopes that I could find one worth eating. I never found one.  Eventually I offered fries to friends just to see what their thoughts were. The reactions were, ""old"", ""gross"", and my personal favorite....""these taste like fries that you left in the car and then tried a couple of hours later and regret"" Much like old car fries, I regret this meal. I've tried a decent variety of things here and only found a handful that weren't awful. Maybe 1 or 2 that were good, but in the end, regardless of what I eat, I think to myself, ""why didn't I go to that local place that makes a better version of this meal for less cost and less time?"""
Daniel M.,"Sandy, UT",0,3,,2.0,3/15/2017,"We had to walk out!  Customer satisfaction here is apparently of no real interest to the staff at this location. It's a beautiful sunny 75°F day here in Salt Lake.  We asked for a table outside.  They told us it would be a 30 min wait, because they only had one server outside and he already had 5 tables. We only went out to eat so we could sit outside and have an appetizer in the nice weather.  We explained this to the staff and asked them to check with the server if he would be willing.  They told us no and then said the wait would now be 55 min.  We could not wait for that because the sun would be down by then.  Instead of accommodating us they showed us the door.  As we left we could see that everyone on the patio was done being served and we could have been easily accommodated. We love this restaurant, but feel an apology from this establishment would be in order."
Johnny L.,"Salt Lake City, UT",159,122,36,3.0,11/10/2015,"You're out of Hennessy.  Ok next option,  do you carry ciroc? Grey goose it is then.  Pretty much an unprepared bar to start. Our bartender was great though.  It was an appetizers and drinks kind of night with friends. I ordered the fried calamari and sweet corn soup. The soup was okay, nothing to rave about.  My fried calamari was very salty. I made everyone try it and they agreed. Had I not been drinking I probrably couldn't stomach this. My friend had left over lettuce from his lettuce wrap and I actually took bites out of it with each bite of calamari and balanced it. That salty.  The cheesecake will always be delicious. At least I can count on that."
Coco B.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",60,76,212,3.0,2/15/2016,"I had the chicken Romano and the crust was too eggy so much i couldn't eat the chicken, the pasta that accompanied it was tasty though. My hubby ordered there orange chicken it was fantastic! Best orange chicken across the board. If you come here bring your appetite bcz the portions are huge! And be prepared to wait bcz it's normally a lengthy wait. But you can always kill time at the mall."
Granda M.,"Sandy, UT",23,79,638,5.0,9/4/2015,"It's refreshing to go out to eat and know that the food is fresh, tasty, and a good portion size.  Trying the Grilled Salmon tonight and it was cooked perfectly and the herbs added a layer of flavor to enhance the fish.  The potatoes and asparagus was a complement to the salmon, and the portion was enough to split.  I am hooked on any salmon dish at Cheesecake Factory!!"
Kristina R.,"Orem, UT",3,11,,2.0,4/5/2017,"Food is delicious but the service is way too slow. These servers have too many tables to take care of any of their guests.  My waitress forgot to get us bread 3 times, didn't put the appetizer order in before my main course and took forever to get us anything.  No refills. Ever.  Then I ordered dessert and it took 15 minutes to get me the check and then 10 more after she took my money to get us the desserts.  Who is running this place? Seems like inexperienced back of house managers.  I'm usually not such a harsh critic, but my girls were there so long they could not stay awake waiting for the check.  The food was amazing but the expierence was poor. If you have an extra 2.5-3 hours then it should be okay for you."
Darcie P.,"West Valley City, Salt Lake City, UT",37,13,1,5.0,4/3/2017,"We visited Cheesecake Factory for the first time tonight and we WILL be back. Great food, great drinks and great service! Lacey was great!! Oh, and the cheesecake is great too!"
Tony L.,"Herriman, UT",152,280,1021,4.0,11/29/2015,"Where is the love? I dont know why there are too many haters here. Cheesecake factory has always provided good food, good selections, good ambience, good service. Sure...prepare to wait an hour or so and the place is always crowded. Its a good thing.  I don't think i was unsatisfied with any of their selections. Steaks are good, pastas not bad, delicious appetizers and great salads. The only complain I have is their cheesecakes are overpriced. But other than that... Solid 4 stars. I am just happy to have a Cheesecaje Factory here in Utah."
Emilee C.,"Provo, UT",0,2,,5.0,8/20/2017,"The Cheesecake Factory is to die for! This is a great place for any occasion, whether it be a family meal, get-together with friends, casual lunch, or fancy date! Though I haven't tried nearly everything on their menu, I can't imagine any of their dishes taste less than extraordinary. And don't get me started on how amazing their cheesecake is. My favorite is the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch cheesecake. On my last visit I tried the Marshmallow S'mores Galore cheesecake which was really yummy, too! Aside from the food having outstanding taste, the servers are almost always super friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful, even when the restaurant is busy and hectic, which I really appreciate. There are often long wait times in the evenings (I had about an hour wait on my last visit for dinner) and the food is more on the expensive side, but I'd say the wait and the cost are very well worth it considering the great service, delicious food, and huge portions (I almost always have extra to take home and eat the next day). I'd recommend the Cheesecake Factory, and especially this restaurant, to anyone any day of the week! Pro tip - make a reservation if you're going in the evening...you'll thank me later ;)"
Angel B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,5,,3.0,3/7/2017,"I have been to this location a few times and every time it was definitely a 5 star visit but the last time I came in was awful. The food was really good, but we received horrible service. We were seated almost immediately and were greeted not long after by, I guess, a manager because they were not in a server uniform. They got our drink and food order. Our food came out fairly quick but I never got a beverage I asked for even asking and reminding them several times. The entire time we had no idea who our server was and felt ignored. I still left a $7 tip because I, myself, am a server and realize sometimes when you go out you just get a bad experience once in awhile. Don't know if I'll be coming back as it wasn't worth the $50 I spent here."
Nathan S.,"Mesa, AZ",1,14,,1.0,12/16/2016,"Wish I could do negative Stars!!! This establishment was unfriendly and unprofessional to the ""T"". I called on a Monday for a Thursday reservation. I confirmed on Tuesday to confirm address and my party's # of people to attend which was 18! This was a Christmas lunch for my largest client, with the President and VP in attendance. I show up at 11:30 with all 17 guest to find out they had not written down my reservation, the manager remembers discussing with me but could not find where she had written it down..... extremely embarrassing for me, we had to go to Brio(Amazing Restaurant with the best staff amazing food, 10X better than this place) wait another 30 min. I will never take any of my clients to the cheesecake factory again or recommend it to my staff. Thank you for ensuring I nor my clientele to attend your hypocrisy of a restaurant again. Good Day,"
